I'm not following, and I'm sorry if I came off sarcastic I didn't intend it to be. Brawlers currently wait a 0, a kiter warps to plex and takes the gate and lands at 0 then tries to quickly get out to kite range. In my suggestion none of that changes. The kiter would still land at 0, on a ab brawling frig, who is waiting at 0. Or are you suggesting the extra time on dscan gives the brawler more heads up? Because if he's looking for a fight how is anything changing the kiter would land in the same spot no? Again I don't see where this affects anyone but botters or people looking to avoid fights. 
---
CCP still not tracking anything entosis related after committing to it for nearly three and a half years. No records of Infrastructure hubs being destroyed, nor TCUs. Even with the launch of this back-patting system for newer players they've chosen to still ignore any sort of tracking system for it as well.
---
This just in, CCP allows siege modules on supers, more at spod o'clock.
---
In large plexes, you can warp to 40 you will land 40 off the beacon 
---
&gt; What people hated were specific capture mechanics that were entirely CCP's idea.
---
a lot of people were loudly screeching for fw mechanics actually
---
10 years? Why so long?
---
I am disabled.
---
ok?
---
Are you in NPC null sec or your own space? Does your Corp have structures like an astrahus? Of course they’ll follow if you leave system. The idea is to warp to a safe structure or at least a safe spot in system and theyll just move on. 
---
it is
---
They warped in at 130km it took all of 60 sec them to died
---
Awesome job! I still haven't made it there but I keep doing stupid stuff to stay entertained.
---
There is still a full new player experience to go through. Don’t think that’s CCP. 
---
Yea but I said in my post 
---
&gt;You land on the beacon the same way you do now from the gate 
---
I guess I should have been more specific in the post. I meant the same as novice, small and medium. Make it so you always land at zero, no warp at range allowed. I'll the sentence to make that clearer. It would essentially be the same but less time to warp off if you're running. 
---
Nope. Now you only get 6.4 clients. ;)
---
Is there someone in game that I can talk to about some questions? I have a few specific questions. 
---
I hope your building placement is better than your text alignment.
---
Did he tell his fleet to hold fire on the pod, then tell them to shoot it, but only after he had his guns cycling on it? That's shitty af
---
One of my accounts still has one fitted and docked in highsec. That aside, happy krabbing!
---
I believe he/she is saying they have a disability that makes it difficult for them to play EVE or other games.
---
Sure, wouldn’t mind blowing up some scorpions and abbadons again.
---
Bomber should be priced to 300m instead of 30m tbh, so cost effective than most HAC or even bs at the right hands
---
I haven't tried playing with it yet, but it seems to launch fine on Linux too.

Moa,Merlin,Eagle,Harpy, yeah in fleets they use rails cuz range but because theyre meant to fit rails that means if you fit blasters youll have hella room for tank for brawling
---
so is everyone in goons, didn't stop them from being at the top of the  monthly PVE charts.
---
They could probably do the lower level ones no problem, though if you want to run higher difficulty levels in nullsec you will start to have problems. the tengu can beat even 10/10s, so you might consider training for that. Gila-&gt;rattlesnake is also a good way to go.

6 Years Late with this one... did you just wake up from coma ?

does caps like carriers and dreads seeded? i want to practice with my fighters

Yes

You should train the "Desires" skill, it's pretty much the opposite of what the Angel Cartel stands for, but you'll be able to ask anyone "What is it that you truly desire?" And they'll have no choice but to answer

What’s the best place to find data on up-to-date isk/m3 values for various ores? Fuzzworks and cerlestes give conflicting values.

I have this only with temperate planets. I just dont do temperate, all other works alright ( all potatoe settings, window mode 1600x900 ).

Try tinkering with settings, maybe it will work for you too, if you really like the PI.
---
It’s NPC null but the times I died I was attempting to get back to our HQ station when I was warp bubbled. 
---
Yes that's all well and good. I think you're missing the issue. Problem isn't the new player. The problem is the vast majority of alphas are existing player bots or dick nosed RMT isk farmers.

a properly fit rorq for 3 bill? you contradict yourself. what does it have T2 toilet wrapped around it? and it takes you 20-30min to take it into panic. man your Leshak fleets must be one of the weakest in the universe. If you spending that much on a ship you should atleast be able to afford the specialization book. yes I do lack the experience of killing a rorq, but I ve seen alot weaker fleets then what you describe take down rorqs alot faster. And those were not cheap fit T2 rorqs that you fellas can only take into panic after half an hour. I now understand why you go after ships that can t fight back. You wanna feel elite but fail miserably. So you come to the forums and demand easy kills for ships that can t fight back. Tell me one thing, what is the satisfaction of such a lop sided fight? Do you feel any challenge at all? or you just enjoy the grief you cause?
---
Eve runs fine on Linux with wine and DXVK.  And, who needs any other game.  :)
---
Steam has Proton (Wine + DXVK + Valve's per-game tweaks) built into it now, so many games will just work - no hassles.
---
There's probably inefficiencies is how things are stored in memory so depending on which order your client loads thing it may or may not fit into the available memory.

Congrats!  A carrier is a total game changer.  After I got mine a year ago, I never wanted for isk for any dumb thing I wanted to buy on whim.  100mil/hr bounties on the low end, plus loot, rare drops, and escalations, you'll have your hull paid back in a week or two and can start upgrading the mods or buying PvP ships for roams.  I really kind of regret how long I lived in Provi putzing around in Ishtars and docking up multiple times a night.  Living in deep null with a solid income is the life.
---
Upvoted because it's a John Deere. 
---
Just because they say you can pay for the game with in-game currency, doesn't mean they tailor it to the communities best interests.
---
This is a common practice in many online games to sign people on. But the reality is the payouts are either way too low, or not worth the time investment as opposed to real life alternatives.
---
It's really basic economics if you take a moment to look at it.
---
You'd think so
---
legit answer for anyone curious, no. 32bit refers to memory addresses. I.e. you can have 2^32 memory locations. You can then store an integer across as many of those locations as you please to store anything of any size.
---
Imagine a street with an 8 bit address, thats 256 properties on the street. This tells you nothing about the size of those buildings.

Day 4: My long time friend and fellow newbro who I recruited to the game on my second day just received his official welcome to Eve.  We were Banting over discord and I was giving him some tips on how to do the intro career missions and the like to make money and get ships.  He started doing the military mission line and I warned him to READ the missions carefully to which he sarcastically replayed something along the lines of "I dont have time to read when im blowing everyone up".  
---
Bout 30 minutes later I was off mining some Rich Plagioclase and we were talking and I was telling him about some of the reeeaaallly close calls I have had (especially lately during the Sisters of EVE missions) and about how my paranoia has caused me to purchase insurance for every ship I take out I recommended he do the same.  He replied with "Man, I dont need no Insurance, I got tons of money (3 mil or so). All I need is my guns and that ammo you made me.".
---
Not even 5 minutes after that particular conversation "MAN WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?! I JUST EXPLODED!" Being the good friend, naturally I jumped in to console him "... At least you have insurance right?" To which I was promptly told to go fuck myself. Fair enough.
---
At first I thought he got ganked or something but he mentioned he was doing a mission killed a few pirates and then approached a station thing. Turns out he had neglected to read the big red letters in the mission text that told him NOT to bring his own ship on a SUICIDE RUN.  To make things worse, his hold was packed with all his fusion ammo (which I had JUST made him) and ship fittings because he was planning on moving to a system closer to where I am currently based so he lost pretty much everything.  
---
Once he got over the shock and realized exactly what happened and why, we cracked up.  We laughed about the incident for about half an hour. The timing couldn't have been more perfect, especially since we had JUST talked about insuring ships and him not doing anything dumb to lose all his stuff. 
---
This game is gold.
---
What a choice of "skill packages" at 5 mil SP. Skills grouped around activities like "Combat", "Tycoon", "Explorer", or "Miner." They player gets free SP for skills in a package that are already trained.
---
Congrats on being a cunt to a disabled player
---
What if cynos didn't work inside bubbles? There would be some counter play to the "light cyno get rescued" mechanic. Defenders would have to pilot and think about cyno placement, and dictors/hictors could try and stop the incoming rescue team
---
I like the trailers. Therefore I think you and your opinions are stupid
---
Following CCPs track record, im guessing the 64bit version will be buttery smooth in huge fleet battles and have tidi in small gang fights.
---
In all honesty, I do feel that new players are more f'd than ever while being more blessed than ever.
---
Skill injectors, no sp loss if you don't update your clone, more sp after getting through the new player training(been a while since I had a new toon.  Don't know what it's called anymore). 
---
At the same time can a real noob spend a decade training skills?  Will this game even be around then? 
---
Balance of the bitter vets who stomped through the muck and the noobs that could fly a Titan in a few months.
---
Either way, we all F1 be it a frigate or a super.
---
No he’s trying to argue that cinematic trailers cause false expectations for new players. Like a moron
---
Don’t worry everyone, I have this under control! 
---
HURR DURR YOU DON’T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT BOTTING EITHER
---
Remove skill training, let the isk decide who can fly what.
---
The recording is not from the PoV of zarvox the FC making the call to hold fire, it's from the perspective of one of the scouts/hunters who jumped the gun a bit on shooting the pod. In fact, at least back when these were inty fleets zarvox usually FC'd them from an overtanked no-gun ship, so if he's kept to his usual pattern he *couldn't* have done that.
---
I actually like this idea despite the abuse people would do for alts.
---
At one time Defender Missiles worked as a missile system that auto-targeted hostile missiles fired at you (AFAIK; I'm not sure what the specific targeting mechanics for old defenders was), and could be loaded into any missile system in the game. Usually this meant that Interceptors would- if possible- fit a Rocket Launcher and load it with Defenders, since IIRC missile application has *mostly* always worked based on some measure of explosion radius/velocity compared to ship signature/(current) velocity, so missiles could always put some slight amount of chip damage onto basically anything (this is incidentally why brawling torpedo battleships- *when correctly fit*\- are really great for styling on frigate/destroyer blobs).
---
Except of course that even with that in mind basically nobody used them. Ever.
---
So that got changed to the current iteration of an anti-bomb weapon that is exclusively fit to destroyer hulls.
---
Similarly, missiles being an entity that is in space- like ships- means that even though you cannot directly target them you can still damage or destroy them with AoE damage sources- for example, smartbombs, which at one point (as noted in another post) were used so specifically- and in well organized fashion- that it became a distinct doctrine called "firewalling" (AFAIK this does still technically work it's just that most of the time missile ship blobs tend to be much more specific in usage so I don't think anybody really does this anymore).
---
My own supposition is that anti-missile systems do technically exist, and the missiles that we actually use are basically the minimum size needed to pierce whatever softkill countermeasures are employed, while dedicated hardkill systems seem to have gone out of vogue. Which isn't necessarily unthinkable, since even today softkill systems are probably a better defense rather than outright intercept of an incoming missile, as it allows you to skip the problems of 1-10 tons of flaming wreckage flying at you at anywhere from Mach 0.5 to Mach 3.
---
Which would be pretty inconvenient to be hit by.
---
ITT Peeps jelly of Zarvox vape skillz. Ya'll wish you could blow phat ones like him.
---
I'd play the shit out of Eve if it wasn't a Microsoft Excel simulator.
---
Eh. The single best change I can imagine (regarding barriers to entry) is a functional default overview.
---
Oh also, maybe they could just pay /u/Wollari to integrate Dotlan into the client or something because the default ingame maps (even the old one) are straight shite.
---
Earning anything in Eve is dead.
---
great, so now people will be able to cram twice as many pilots into the large fights ensuring even more load on server 
---
Nullsec importing though is a serious endeavor requiring multiple accounts (2-3) and at least 20 billion isk investment (jumpfreighter), safe citadels, and a few million skillpoints for jumpfreighters and freighters
---
Mate, are you actually serious ? I'm the one who have taken this screenshot and posted on the Eve Online facebook group, you've used a wrong title and stole my screenshot.   
---
proof : [https://imgur.com/a/TpK50Me](https://imgur.com/a/TpK50Me) (screenshots taken at the same time, check timestamps)
---
Try the new abyss content or maybe burned missions, they’re pretty cool
---
Lol what!?
---
I've recently made a new alt and played through part of the new NPE, and while I have a number of issues with it (the lack of voice acted sequences gives a lot less soul to the Seeker Investigation) I do like how skills are doled out immediately after each phase. 
---
I would prefer to see a new kind of accelerated skill training like this so new players would get rewarded by learning the game, possibly integrated with the Agency and Activity tracker. Combine that with the referral SP (250k sp) and it would be a lot easier to get into the game, and a lot less time to jump into more complex ships and playstyles. 
---
Of course not. Just SC, ever.
---
At least it gives new players a little direction. Maybe one of the packages could just be "Custom" and be free SP.
---
liar
---
But you don't, in fact, need to have these skills to 5 to fly ships.
---
It was more of a point out that the BR needs work. The capital stack being the indication to me. 
---
Low effort/10
---
or maybe you shouldn't fly HACs at 130km...common sense isn't common though.
---
Actually, it looks like your post is standard definition, whereas OP's  is in high quality 4K. I think you may be mistaken
---
Yup, that's a bit more accurate. 
---
Yeah, that is what I mean. I pretty much missed the first brawl.
---
I am absolutely sure I am the one that took this screenshot, I still have the original on my pc. 
---
Yet somehow front of r/eve
---
wtg guys
---
Seriously, was so good and then...
---
I won't get any achievements with activity tracker....oh wait wut?
---
Just give all new players any skill they want on day 1 so they don't have to put any effort into the game.  Bring back learning skills i say (well maybe not).  Many new players in those days are still plating today.  Just gamers today want everything now and instant gratification instead of setting goals and working towards them.
---
What the absolute fuck?? How does he afford losing so much?
---
Idiot posts “bullship” to r/eve for fake internet points?  Surely not.

Thank you, Ralph! Very cool!

Downvote for 'op' and upvote for OP.

        Ten years is a tad to long for a cap even if one stayed in highsec the whole time
---
Over 600 in local before we stood down... so yea.  Prove me wrong.  Give me some low effort photoshop like OP.
---
Ym new account? ... oh no, somebody somehow decided that was worth to "steal" somebodys "story". This is so not worth the drama, so congrats ymenoa, hope you feather stuff with your fighters and have a good run.

Mods? I am being brigaded.

wow you are pretty upset about property that doesnt even belong to you. This is all ccp's property. Fucking dweeb.
---
doesn't necessarily mean anything. facebook nukes pictures' quality
---
That's everyones reaction when any large alliance says they have no bots
---
rmt
---
Those were fun times.
---
- Don't accept ANYTHING from Jita local. That said, I'm willing to double your isk for you and you can totally trust me.
---
- Have specialized alts. Being new, your main is going to be a jack of all trades, which means you'll be the master of none. So have alts that are masters of something that you use constantly, like hauling, mining, PVP, ect.
---
- You'll hear a lot of "don't fly things you can't afford to lose". Fly it. If you save up for a cool ship and then don't fly it for fear of losing it, what good is it when it just sits in the hangar 24/7? Secondly, after you lose say a 500mil ship, losing that 35mil ship feels like nothing anymore.
---
- Don't give up. There will be times you'll want to rage quit, but don't. Play another game for the day and come back. Because in a years time from that event, worse will have happened and you'll laugh about when you were going to rage quit.
---
- Dont join one of the major corps/alliances. Find some small group that you can get to know. Larger corps have clicks and it starts feeling like highschool all over again. But when you're one of like 10 guys (not counting alts), the jokes are funnier and achievements are more worth it. And yes the larger groups can school you on how to do things, but learning the hard way with friends always sticks more.
---
- Don't be a jackass in local. Might just be me, but it's awesome to have a decent conversation with someone even if they may be hunting you. When you get that jacakss talking about "20bil and I let you live today" or just about anything CODE says, it really kills the game for myself and many of my corp mates. Like we're all human, so act like it.
---
- Finally, do crazy shit. Sacrifice things for the lolz, pick a fight you probably won't win, purposely shit fit a ship, just have fun. If you lose at whatever you did, it was still fun. You win at whatever you we're trying to do, it's that much better. Just always remember, this is a game.
---
Lol. leaking private chats. I thought you were a man but I guess you are amouse
---
The lower the security status, the better the ISK making opportunity. Don’t stay in Hi-Sec, move to either low sec or join one of the many Nullsec corps like Karmafleet and enjoy the isk making opportunities 
---
I mean I haven’t logged-in in 2 weeks so yeah 
---
i would definetly like to see a change to the accel gates

oh and please fucking please remove accel gates for FW missions

make them all ungated like Roid(dier,diest) Rage missions

Checkout Pandemic Horde if you can’t find any decent group yourself

but seriously... it'll help stop crashes because out of memory has been the bottleneck issue in most of the recent structure fights. Less crashing, means less relogging, which hopefully means less transactions from inactive pilot not in system to active pilot in system. Which as we've all seen jumping a full fleet into a system, is at least a bit more intensive than a dude waiting for his module to deactivate.
---
Almost anything can play Eve if you turn down the graphics. 
---
don't forget SiSi is NOT a way of testing for CCP, it's merely a way of easing you into changes, can't get to character screen you say? expect to see that on TQ in a week or so, nothing will change...
---
very disappointed in this community right now... all these ppl harrassing and vote brigading a disabled player over a similar picture... despicable

I guess its good you stay away, since you're so dumb you think its an excel simulator.

I'm new but I noticed how easy it was to run immediately.
---
A good job.  
---
Hey maybe my comment was harsh. I like eve. I just wish it had more gameplay.
---
Is the blood-stained stars worth running for isk or nah?
---
How did you get scammed?
---
I made a new alpha and got a trade skill or some such to lvl 1 while my other character got some skill to lvl 5 that would have taken a week to train. I think I read if you already have that skill trained beyond a certain lvl it gives you the lvl 1 skill that took 40 minutes to train. Oh boy.
---
I can't see the link, what is it?
---
umm. What?
---
If neither of you can kill the other, then neither of you are 'the better one'. "The better one" would have killed his opponent.
---
Congratulations! Have fun with it. Feels so good when you can finally sit in the ship you wanted. Watch intel btw
---
Is it weird that on a low-end Mac, macOS runs EVE better than a Boot Camp Windows?
---
It's also not announced as released yet. :) if I had to make a guess on why it's there, it's an artefact of their build process, rather than being a release, which happens not to work.
---
Armor resistance is  locked at 100% for kinetic, 0% for thermal. When they get through the armor the ship blows up and turns into a capital butterfly.
---
First, your chances of that happening are zero because the existing players would flip out. "Fuck giveaways to new players. I suffered to learn this game, they have to suffer too." has been an EVE mantra for a decade plus.
---
But even if you did it, your idea wouldn't solve the fundamental problems new players face in this game. On that list, giving new players a couple of million SP is in the 20s somewhere in the top 50 problems new players face in this game.
---
oh wow, look at this shit-stain, Steals a man's facebook post for easy reddit points, you sir are pathetic
---
Attention all personnel we got a savage
---
Downside: 64 bit processes tend to take up more ram than an equivalent 32 bit process.
---
Upside, they _can_ take up more ram.
---
This isn't going to touch the server side, as that's been 64 bit for a fair time, but there are a number of instances where people have had client crashes, due to using more memory than their Eve could manage. straight to desktop crashes.
---
Isn't it Planetary Production now?
---
This isn't going to do a thing to Tidi. Client side only. Server side has been 64 bit for years.
---
So what do we do for new players who don't want to train for a month to even be able to fly a ship and drones and another 3 years to fly it well?
---
He isn't ragging on the trailers. He's ragging on the new player experience.
---
Oh, it'll still be awful due to tidi. Just not client side crashes.
---
Fuck em. We did it? Why don't they have to?. Or buy a character in the bazaar.
---
You must have a mustache. 
---
I thought this game was always about finding the right type of players instead of finding all players.
---
Or if it is actual footage, it's carefully editted and coming from a monster machine so that it still doesn't look much like the game. Even if CCP put actual footage in a trailer, it's not like they'd show you potato mode max zoom with overview and fleet window and watchlist taking up 3/4 of the screen like a real fleet battle would.
---
u
---
How about we start brainstorming ways to keep players from leaving the game first? In case you haven't noticed, there has been a mass exodus of players from EVE since id say 2013/2014. Myself included. While I love the concept of EVE....the game is a steaming pile of shit atm.
---
He’s saying the trailers look “look cinematic” and when new players play the game they are shocked that the gameplay doesn’t reflect what the trailers showed. 
---
All games have cinematic trailers which is why you insert the word gameplay after the game title on a search engine. 
---
So ransoming/enforcing the glorious will of James 315 the savior of highsec is being a jackass in local? Someone didnt buy a mining permit
---
Mostly true, with a couple exceptions. Some people will plex an account if 500 cost 1.3b but when 500 cost 1.9 they may very well be buying a month sub instead. So CCP makes $15 instead of $17+, or even less if they buy multiple months at once (though there's something to be said for the upfront cash). Some people will let alt accounts fall to alpha when plexing them gets to cost too much isk. Etc.
---
Supply and demand work to push a price towards an equilibrium. If that was all that was going on with the price of plex, then we'd be near an equilibrium, not watching plex prices climb steadily higher and higher for months at a time.
---
Good analogy!
---
They had a sale like every other day before they sold to the Koreans, there has been like 3 since then, you can see them on the graph.
---
Imo they should remove the one time use on the bundles.
---
The equilibrium would be the max amount a player is actually willing to pay for a plex. So apparently, no we aren’t  plus it has taken years for it to get to this price. 
---
You don't need to worry your little head about that. Once the plex is in your hands CCP has your money already. It would actually be ideal for you to pay for it and let it sit on your account and never do anything with it.
---
The system always gives the best results because the slack of the player base unsubbing is taken up by the people who buy more plex.
---
....what kind of cunt does shit like that just for some internet fa...oh okay yeah.  
---
Thank you for the information!
---
If only :-\\
---
Games have to be fun to survive. Games have to pull in new players to survive. 
---
While I don't think lowering skill queues will make a hell of a difference (the biggest barrier to entry is knowledge anyway) the game does need new blood to freshen things up.
---
Good luck with that idea. Shit tons of people opposed CCP nerfing wardecs even after CCP said that they are one of the biggest factors in new players quitting the game.
---
Those same people also think that spending 5 days on power grid skills somehow makes the game hardcore and weeds out all the baddies. They'd rather have a game with fewer players than a lower barrier to entry.
---
Don't put all your eggs in one basket, and bring a (of your standard) cheap basket with you to whatever you think would be interesting

Does it really matter if it is his screen shot or not. She/he is clearly disabled and you do not know what form that takes. If She/he wants to believe this is hers/his, then that is OK. You are the kind of person that makes the world a bad place.

Then Let's see that baby in 4K!!!!!!
---
I did a meta analysis of the stars in the background and the OP's is in 4k and this init fag's facebook one isnt
---
EvE has NEVER been fun. 
---
The draw is it's savagely challenging. With a ridiculously difficult learning curve. Now it's not.
---
 So what is it?
---
That’s been done already
---
Lmao 
---
not sure what a cochlear is but okay 
---
Clearly you have never dealt with anyone disabled in your life, that is ok but I pray for you 🙏🙏🙏
---
Clearly you're gullible and retarded and dont know shit about anyone
---
Eve Online is hardcore because of permanent loss and un-instanced PvP without limits on escalation or who can participate.
---
Waiting 14 days for a 2% damage increase with turrets does not make it hardcore.
---
Just because we suffered through it and survived does not mean it made us better for it. You sound like an old man bragging about how he used to walk to school uphill and downhill IN THE SNOW. We get it Grandpa, you remember training skills, but instead of forcing players to suffer as a rite of passage like we're some backwards nerd tribe living in the Amazon forest, maybe we can remove some of the bullshit to keep new blood coming into the game.
---
That's like saying dark souls isn't fun. The satisfaction you get when you finally win is the fun. Being challenged is fun. Now it's a challenge with no fun
---
You are supposed to believe victims in 2019. It's called being a better ally. 👍🏿 👍🏿 
---
Hmm, I dunno. I started 6 months ago now, and much as I hate the required 'train basic skills' gating, I don't think it's as discouraging as you think it is. 
---
When I started, the stuff I was looking at was tiny, so I could fit a ship with Meta4 stuff and get out there in no time at all. It was only when I got a bit further in and wanted to get better fits or better ships that I discovered what those 'needed' skills were and had already trained like half whilst I was flying about doing other stuff. 
---
Now, when I look at making another alt, I groan about how it'll need to sit in station training those basic skills before it's worth flying, but that seems to only be a second character issue: your first, you take longer to fuck about working out what you want to do, so you need some generic training time. 
---
Imagine being a new player. You land in the game, big sprawling mess o' crazy that it is, and immediately get collared by Aura going "HOW DO YOU WANT TO PLAY? TELL ME NOW, SPACETARD!" like you should have any notion what the options even are. No. Just no. You need to have that buffer zone at the start where you can go "well, this looks like it'll just be overall useful!" and plonk CPU Management or what have you in the queue, then go bimble about being dumb and awestruck in your shitfit frigate that you think is all kinds of epic because it was _almost a million isk!_ Once you've got your bearings, you can be more targeted in your training, but new players do not start out like that, and don't see it as 'unplayable' or 'wasted' time: only alts do, and they can wait or inject til the cows come home.
---
100% agree sir. Well said 
---
That's exactly what I'm saying, because it's hard as hell it's fun. Now it's not as hard anymore.
---
Lmao don't believe shit without evidence.  Its called being a critical thinker 
---
they already start with so much SP, are we going to start new players at 10m sp someday because it's too 'hard'?
---
Odd I dont see POCA anywhere
---
you must be mistaken, this picture is in 4k.
---
You sound like a douche who wants everything easy and for free. 
---
Where's the the accomplishment in buying a shit ton of skill injectors day 2 start super farming?
---
Do without the challenge. Where's the fun?
---
Let's face it. EvE is not coded well. Doesn't have flashy graphics or twitchy controls. It's not fortnight, pubg or overwatch and it never well be.
---
So where is the draw? Used to be the challenge of it. Now what is it?
---
you can start by stopping with this random shitpost )))
---
You wont lose drones either, get back on grid and "reconnect to lost drones" given they havent been destroyed or stolen.
---
Not unless you're brand new. The SOE epic arc missions are designed to be doable in a frigate with entry-level skills, and pay out accordingly. IIRC there is a ~100m ISK item drop near the end of the 50-mission chain, but other than that the arc's primary worth is in the +7% standings gain to empire faction of your choice without the usual derived standing penalties with the opposing factions.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page is your friend. The wiki helped me out immensely when I started and I still reference it 5 years in.
---
We've come full circle.
---
See I always want to but I’m far from the point of knowing anything about the game in that aspect. I have skills trained that I know I could pvp with but idk which ship to fight in or anything like that. Frigates seem nice but I’ve also heard that frigate fights are nothing like being in a cruiser or battle cruiser.
---
if that makes you happier then sure
---
One of the most shit newbie advices I saw so far.
---
episode 3 : [https://imgur.com/a/DVBoFYm](https://imgur.com/a/DVBoFYm)
---
gotta make the game fun to get people to play it
---
currently PvE: Online offers fewer incentives than ever to get out and do things and benefits the crabbers using intel programs and botters abusing local.
---
It's essentially Mobey Dick, getting mercilessly hunted down bu Captain Ahab, over and over, dropping a lot of space lubber to make some sailors very happy.

---
OK... 500 vs 100, what are you fucking missing here?  And our shit is out of that station with no issues, ez pz.
---
We only lack posts how to fix fixposts.
---
Bad idea.
---
There is some situation that you must scout militia plex first by warping 100km.
---
Always warping to 0m means you can’t scout beacons which spawned far from celestials If you don’t have proper bookmark.
---
Your worst idea is making plex to a unprobeable area, which will only benefit fking curse or recons at 0m medium/large plex.
---
I think your idea only benefits recon campers and super bling garmur pilots and atron bots.
---
I'm interested to hear how so? If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but after playing for 2 years, these are a small number of things I've learned.
---
Being ambushed by 10 dudes in pirate faction ships who kick the shit out of your solo Rifter is brutal.
---
Losing your brand-new Citadel to a siege by a massive alliance who forces you to bend the knee or die is brutal.
---
Being scammed out of billions of ISK through a contract scam due to your own carelessness and having no recourse but to nut up or shut up is brutal.
---
Wiping an entire fleet because of a single spy in your midst betraying you to the other side is brutal.
---
All of these things make Eve Online what it is today, and they are why our game gets coverage in major news media whereas no other game could ever hope to have the same legacy.
---
With all that said, can you really not sleep at night unless a new player has to sit on his ass and wait for Power Grid Management V?
---
victim of what? he took credit of a shit image to get shit internet points, i got no reason to pretend to like him or care about him.  
---
He's probably dumb enough ot think he can get away with this and that MIGHT be a disability but that's a strech and probably another lie. But once again, he's not a victim, he's just a karma thief.   
---
But last time i checked being a mythomaniac is not a disability.   
---
I miss it too, i rarely used it coz of the load time but it was super immersive and it was fun to explore the different stations as a new player, or just chill as an old one.
---
Just replace rookie ships with ‘quals at this point. Who fucking cares
---
Honestly, I know this is controversial but.
---
Make alliances no more then 500 plays total. 2 corps 250 people max each. Remove local and asset safety. Disband the csm.
---
For me it is:
---
F1 -&gt; Prop Mod
---
F2 -&gt; Disruptor/Scram
---
F3 -&gt; Webs
---
F4 -&gt; Pewpew
---
Works better than it looks like ;)
---
You're selling short the people who will decide to stick around. The game's not designed around low attention span twitch kids so there's nothing you can do to attract them to stay. For the rest of us, well nobody enjoys long trains but we're patient enough to stick around knowing the wait will be worth it.
---
One small thing I would change is to make multi-train free for all three pilot slots so you don't need to split training.
---
you forgot the poor delvegoon feroxes getting dragged across the game for 4-hour armor timers
---
otherwise good job!
---
"delete your post it looks like you took my picture"
---
delete yourself irl
---
Wow, is that a threat ?
---
Pls no. Iam all onboard for more newbros but if you remove the complexity from the game ... well i feel you are removing the soul and core of Eve. And the various skills a part of it.
---
 I started the game in 2014 and up to this very day i still discover new stuff about it. And i like that, it makes my brain happy, i dont know why. ;) 
---
Just my 2 cents
---
They would rather see Eve Online shrivel up like a prune and die than have new players not suffer like we did.
---
We cherry pick sites because we know it pisses you off...
---
Well when it comes to any of the fitting based skills (i.e. cpu/powergrid/weaponsupgrades). They really have the same problem as the learning skills. That being they are a necessity.
---
When you start training for interceptors or missles skills, shield, or armor you are deciding to focus your pilot on a certain playstyle. When you are choosing to train cpu and powergrid management you are just making sure you aren't gimped. The same was true for learning skills
---
If the game is to feel engaging for a new player Skill training should feel like you are customizing your character into what you want it to be. Taking your first steps in developing your playstyle. It should not mean spending the better part of a month getting the character to square one.
---
Yep
---
Well damn, looks like you win this one. 
---
&gt;a functional default overview.
---
Fucking this.  It's not a difficult thing to do, and it's a huge impact.
---
This is the most pathetic local salt. Why would you think anyone wants to read this?
---
No. It change a lot.
---
Kiters will never warp to plex that brawler is waiting if their bling kite ship don’t have 8000m/s and hyper agility.
---
Your idea will make people more risk averse.
---
Be the change to want to see in the world
---
wtf completely red killboard with those fits??? o.0
---
I bet we can fix that with a fix post
---
CC warrior prob
---
I’ve had my own threads on this issue along with promoting stalemate fits people can use on the cheap specifically to both die and cause grief for the other party.
---
I agree more needs to be done in this space and I’ve passed along some ideas however so far none have been implemented.
---
May look at offering a presentation on abyss PvP and the state of true 1v1 combat at EDU should my topic be chosen however the core issue is that there are fits in which after the 25% resist penalty they are able to tank enough to withstand the max theoretical dps from any setup.
---
Why calling me a faggot though
---
gottem!
---
Edited original comment, see above.
---
Yes it is, please try not to trivialize mental health.
---
I could tell it was 'shopped.     The pixels.   
---
Not really.  While hypervisor tech has gotten a lot better they still take up a lot of resources essentially simulating another computer.
---
Is that you chungus?
---
Was, being the operative term, but has not been for quite a while now simply because it ran out of the "right type" of players to find and the new players nowadays are not what would fit that category. So either the game adjusts or dies out. It is a slow death, but it is.
---
Inb4 the great ban wave
---
So, in your opinion Linux is to blame if people don't  write portable code? That would be completely bollocks.

CCP could just make Eve Online II or simply a different server with different ruleset, let the old folks stay on TQ with their old ruleset.

I watched some of his early streams and he used to be ok. Now seems he's learnt that insufferable try-hard style in which he feels the need to yell every command and call everyone a retard or threaten to kill them. A shame to be honest, I can't watch stuff like this.

Maybe best to just delete this whole thread...

This is itself a shit post from someone with no idea what they're talking about but wants to fix something. Delete pls

Can I come back now? TIDI solved? 
---
Off topic.. I have been itching to install linux, how hard is it to get eve to work there? Will a basic install of Ubuntu and Wine do the trick ? 
---
I'll point out to you its full of shit farmers and bots because so many of the regular normal people have left it. The multiboxers / bots have evolved either indirectly from the need of the "hardcore" for example renter corps etc. or directly from the hardcore, cuz moar caps ....
---
Thanks! Any particular reason why you say compressed ore?
---
fuck off moron
---
mother of god
---
Proof that EVE truly isn't p2w?
---
I like how all your responses are same. 
---
i mean dont get me wrong that fit is insane but its not a shitfit
---
how does a tank like that die to 2 dreads??
---
I was unsuccesfully trying to help out a newb the other day. like literally maybe about a week or so ago. he was asking for starter PvE so that he can get the gist of the game, and some idiot on the official forum told him wrong fits and wrong ships to fly, got him to train into T1 interceptors and the guy wasted his month+ of training on putting everything he could into scrams and webs. While what he wanted was mainly PvE with some simple T1 frig PvP combat on the side.
---
Needless to say it didn't turn out well for him when he tried to PvE , I pointed it all out to him and gave him a couple correct fits to train into etc. but he has not logged back in yet, so no idea if he will or not.
---
I'm not sure giving out SP is a good idea, this guy was already at like 6.5 mil, but what would have been nice is some correct pointers from the start so that at least he didn't feel like he completely wasted all his time and has to start over.
---
you're such a fucking mongoloid 
---
I would come back in a hot minute if EVE made these changes. 
---
Right. 
---
It's mostly a thing where alliances don't want to maintain 5 different fittings for new-players or to manage SRP for all the different fittings, OR to add the extra complexity onto FC's when they try to evaluate a potential fight.  It's easier to just tell everyone to train CPU management V first. 
---
Fitting skills have a place in EVE, but they add extra costs to big organizations. 
---
A couple random suggestions: 
---
* If the fitting simulator could also adjust the skill-rankings so the fitting wizards can test stuff
---
* Fleet-bosses could see the DPS/EHP from the fitting window in the fleet.
---
* Corp/Alliance fittings could have skill-requirements attached to them (This Ferox fit requires Power Grid V, Weapon Upgrades IV...) 
---

---
Maybe,
---
But I mean you could always buy a character before. So if this is true why the proliferation now?
---
And when they did adjust the T3Cs they didn't even bother to finish it. Loki reigns supersupreme, Tengu is OK, Legion is below average and Proteus is shit that is unusable in most situations now except some buttfucked egypt WHs and occasionally cloaky jumping a newb here and there.
---
This is yet another aspect of their "balance" they fucking abandon it and never finish, like fucking PvE shit too, same as Resource Wars, abandoned, not finished, never brought up to what it could be, just shit now and it was / is an actually somewhat solid concept / idea.
---
how is a long skill queue complex?

Even though I saw both this thread and the other, I somehow still thought they were going to finally nerf my rapid jesus launchers. Thank god.

Nice upvote bait

Yeah I liked him years ago but it's my humblest opinion he's now an insufferable greasy elitist douchcanoe
---
#Its finally happening
---
:thinking:
---
That too, the only reason I even bother with Sisi ever anymore is to test my own fits, not to test the content. I did mass and mad amount of time on Sisi before Abyss went live, and look what happened, not only did they let it go to TQ with all the shit we reported but then on top of that they needed a fucking event, to collect the data, which exactly and precisely fucking confirmed for them all the shit that we all reported on Sisi. Seriously, how fucked up is that ? Where is some sort of fucking management here ? 
---
Most companies I know of jsut flat out fire people for this sort of shit, quite literally, and not just in software industries but all across all sorts of industries. Shit I even did a bit of that firing myself. Its not like there is a lack of replacement candidates.
---
don’t think it’d help you 
---
People do write portable code when it looks profitable. If most games does not have Linux versions it shows that many or most game studios do not see Linux as real platform for selling games.

Wait what? So they could utilize quadcores with multithreading on the server side? Man I thought the servers were the thing that needed upgrading to 64bit

kinda like the old character creation system where different races/subraces/professions had different attributes and different gave you different base skills?
---
Hell yes
---
I mean capitals are proliferated are we really going to tell them, yeah you're gonna get wrecked and skill points matter more than the pilot always till you get into capitals and then the person with the most caps wins? Like these aren't pretend issues, veteran players are decades ahead in many cases than new players and there's no incentive for a new person who can't even begin to fit his ship till he spends a week-2weeks getting cpu/powergrid/cap management to 5.
---
You'd still get the same amount of people in coalitions, you'd just have way more alliances in each coalition
---
I feel like the issue here is that over the years CCP have tightened up things like fitting and bonuses to try and force ships into ever smaller niches. With this it often seems to mean is that there then becomes one "correct" fitting for that ship and only one or two ships that you should be using for a task at any given time.
---
What the long grinds should be for is getting that last few % of performance out of your chosen ships rather than just getting to a point where the ship is actually viable.
---
It would be a logistical nightmare.
---
Spaceship Command starts at 4, along with science, gunnery, power grid management, and cpu management.
---
&gt; skill points matter more than the pilot 
---
factually incorrect, there's tons of solo alpha pvp videos where players with like 3m sp are beating 2+year old characters
---
some players I fly with started in 2016/2017 and are some of the best pilots i know, with skill injectors the only barrier to getting good is yourself
---
Having mandatory skills to train isn't hard, it's literally just passively taking time to complete before you can actually fly anything at the same pace as anyone else
---
When I started I thought fitting skills were dumb as fuck, and I still do. 
---
Free to play was a mistake
---
I don't see it as a logistical nightmare, it'd probably get more irritating and would maybe make eve coalitions a bit smaller but if they're determined it's probably just a matter of standings to sort out the whole issue
---
well, what about aegis sov do you not like?
---
I like it as one of the best features when contested. it's boring if uncontested, but everything is boring uncontested.
---
about the capital changes: I really hope ccp wont let themself be influenced that much, and I trust them in that.
---
there is a crucial problem about caps, and ccp should listen to the players. but when it comes to the solutions, most popular opinions do not solve the problem at all.

What's it feel like to suck so bad, you couldn't even do that.

You do realise that limiting alliance and corp size like that just means that you'll have a Coalition of 70 Alliances that makes up Goons instead of one Alliance. Less of an issue for big entities that already have shit setup for working within coalitions but it now means that any new entities have a harder job setting up infrastructure than currently. Remember, when eve started there was no in game management for alliances, it only came with Exodus.

Exceedingly smug and vauge. I bet your a blast at parties.

I think part of it is the attitude a lot of eve players have that the only correct way of playing the game is PVP, and then shit on anyone else's efforts to do anything else despite that being a form of content people like to shoot
---
I mean, how many questions of "how do I make money in eve" are met with "work IRL" just on the subreddit alone
---
Imagine being so seething and obsessed you come come to this post over and over 🤐
---
And you could probably run skillbooks into nullsec space too, correct? I was thinking ceptors moving small volumes of higher value commodities. Then you learn the ropes and know whether you want to scale up or change careers. My goal is saving as many people as possible from the highsec burnout and get them into nullsec. It’s good for the health and the wallet 
---
If you're going to join a corp that will teach you things, go with EVE-Uni. Good people to fly with, and they'll have a course on hand for pretty much any aspect of the game that you can think of. As well as five dozen you've never heard of. 
---
Learn as much as possible before you decide where you want to go. Talk to people about the various benefits and drawbacks of the high, low, null, and wormhole life. Figure out how *you* want to fly, and then pick a corp that fits with that style. And if it turns out that you're not a good fit with that corp, it is perfectly acceptable to dump them and find a new one. 
---
Finally, hone your paranoia. If you're in a bad corp, it becomes obvious with the way the leadership behaves. If you're swanning about in someone else's system and they wake up, GTFO with all undue speed. Look at every offer in a trade hub chat as being a complete and total waste of money until proven otherwise. PvP is everywhere in this game, not just with standard weaponry. And the easiest way to not fall victim to that PvP is to pay attention to the details.
---
P much the nicest way I've seen someone say "please stop posting" ever.

I have a shitty idea - and i know it probably will never happen - but what if they did something like wow - but instead of going back to legacy eve versions rather just created a new empty shard where everybody would have to create new chars?
---
(Participation optional)
---
Skill injection would still be a problem - but atleast it would take some time before enough materials was mined that the cap proliferation was at least postponed. It would also give new players a chance to matter.
---
The amount of capitals that are proliferated atm means there's virtually no way you are going to avoid them. How do you explain a ship type to a new player that basically says they can't interact with them in any real manner without a massive fleet, or other capitals, or their own, but they can't get their own without over a year of training?
---
Look I don't have all the answers, all I'm saying is super blocs are bullshit,
---
They aren't helping the game at all.
---
What they are is huge lumbering massive entities that provide far too much safety. They gobble up everything, get old and craggy and stagnation, boredom, and massive farm fleets and blue doughnuts is the result.
---
It's NOT good.

Vexen then gave reason that PGL has his knickers in a twist here: cause hes pandering to the small gang pvpers who think 2 ONI , 2 ceptors and a deacon should kill a capital . He just wants more votes for CSM.

That is in no way, shape, or form, an argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent.  He merely answered the question.

PGL is after capital changes purely because he wants the small gang idiot vote.

Now that you have been properly educated, please step aside and let the adults chat.

so why is the issue the SP players start with instead of the caps???

games can be top-balanced, if HACs were the best subcap for solo, gang, and doctrine would that also mean newbros need more SP?

Perception is reality. Do you think people start a game with the idea that they will be playing it for a year for certain? No dude, that's not common. People play and can perceive plans on a monthly-couple month basis, you can train almost any subcap besides blops and mauruders in under 2 months. What capital ship has that bar of entry? No normal person goes into a game going "right well let me get my yearly planner out for my goals in this game"
---
its ez, i injected to hel from vni and all you do is fit for speed and click like madman to keep up with the constanly dying rats.
---
You also shouldn’t be able to volley a keepstar with titans. Without damage caps you could just cyno them in right before DT, doomsday the keepstar, lose one or two to the defenders, and extract the rest a week or two later. 
---
I still tell Bandwidthh he's always revenant on facebook.
---
*cliques not clicks
---
Thing is that the slippery slope fallacy is entirely real, and you definitely are invoking it.
---
Will upload it later
---
The way to combat that isn't to try and put a cap on player groups though, you need to look at tearing apart the safety net that drives ever increasing numbers of players, corps and alliances into these monolithic blocs.
---
As it stands you're at such a disadvantage by not being part of a huge bloc that it's not worth the hassle for most people, why bust your ass scraping by in lowsec when you can just join a big coalition and run a fleet of rorqs to fund everything while buying cheap caps/supers/titans produced from the flood of minerals being mined locally.
---
I'm not saying that the idea itself of trying to fragment the playerbase more is bad, just that I think you're coming at it from the wrong side. Rather than punishing people from trying to group together, what I feel needs to happen is removing some of the benefits granted by ever increasing group sizes i.e. nerf high end income generation from rorqs and super ratting and make the supercapital umbrellas less oppressive.

What to do about it though. : Shrug: CCP fozzie tried to break em up but that didn't work. IDK.
---
not really surprising, against a sniping battlecruiser fleet with T2 links and Logi... I m sure that Legion lived very long on... I m not saying a HAW dread can wreck any 50 man fleet. But they are certainly super effective against normal cruisers and dessies.

Compressed ore is the universal standard. It's got everything that regular ore does, plus portability. Buy orders for uncompressed ore are usually lower due to the extra work that needs to be done hauling it to be compressed.

I am not an expert programmer but I would suspect that if they wanted to utilize multithreading or whatever they'd have to rewrite the message queues for events as well as the memory manager for Tranquility.
---
Yeah, it sucks that it's got to the point we're at now. The answer is that they're probably not going to do shit about it until subs start dropping off harder because all those rorqs and supers are extra subs bringing in money for CCP in the short term.
---
Keep in mind that you need a large amount of expensive materials to build them. Most mid-grade Ascendancy implants will still sell for more than what the materials cost you, so you'll still make a profit. But the mid-grade Ascendancy Omega sells for right about the same as what it costs you to buy the materials, so it's not worth it to build and sell - in fact, it's not worth anything unless you decide to plug it in yourself.

I actually really like the Mach, i wish it was a bit straighter (lol) but i like the look

They should just explode like normal, I don’t see any reason why they would act differently

Thats actually the first time I've ever said those exact words to anybody.  Thats how dumb you are.

You want 70-80% resists, and either a t2 medium shield booster or a 100mn AB + t2 medium armor rep. Make it cap stable with good resists, then fill the remaining slots with drone damage amplifiers and tracking links
---
gotta make sure you're fully landed and then hit recall though, otherwise they'll land thousands of kms away. personally I will instead hit 9 then f2 which is my keybind for recall all fighters, mwd on. as i tend to be paying attention while i rat ill also warp to less than 100km so they have a shorter travel to get back to me.

jfc garbage advice here.
---
eve is OLD. its design is from another era, don't expect a typical game that gently introduces things. you will need out of game resources. there is more to see and do then near any other game. do what interests you, don't waste time doing something unfun. also don't give a shit what other people call unfun or 'right way to play'. the best part of the game is the player interaction. don't play solo you'll just get bored. new player alliances are a good way to learn things but are like joining a gang and mostly push 'their way'. don't be afraid to bail if its not a good fit. scamming and trickery is legal and complaining about them will only get you mocked. ships are ammo, not gear. use them up, expect to lose them, enjoy the pretty explosion.
---
&gt; you can train almost any subcap besides blops and mauruders in under 2 months.
---
this isn't true at all unless you completely ignore support skills
---
is your proposal to just give everyone support skills for free  theN? 
---
also eve is literally a long term game, I hate to use the term but it seems like you want to make this game way more casual than it is rn
---
You can do it with just 6 planets.
---
How much you can do will depend on which P4 product you're trying to make (there are eight different kinds). Some P4's require more P0 than others. Some require so much P0 that you'll only be able to do 15-20 P4's daily (***on a single account in nullsec, which I assume you're doing***); with others you can do about 20-25; and with others I've been able to do 25 up to 36.
---
As far as how you set up the chain - there's quite a bit of wiggle room there. The answer is really "whatever you can squeeze in once you start extracting" and thus it will again partially come down to which P4 you're making. Some resources will be scarcer than others depending on, for example, whether you need a lava planet and whether you're using a storm or plasma planet.
---
***My advice***: calculate how much P0 you need for your target production, get enough extractor heads down, then step back, see how much powergrid room is left on each planet, and build your line from there. Try to get P3 and P4 production on planets with low customs taxes. 
---
I.. might not be against that. Two servers, two different sets of toons. 
---
Tq stays the same, new server.. maybe call it Clarity or whatever, has more starting skills, maybe even slightly faster training, but no injectors. If you're plexed in one, youre plexed in the other.
---
Also the new server would start from zero, full wipe.
---
I fear it would kill pop on tq though and make content sparse, that might be the killing blow for eve..
---
Fun but spodbrained idea imo
---
You do ignore support skills, once youre in the ship, you can feel the power increasing with each support skill as you level it up. No I don't think support skills should be included. You've shifted the goal post here. I explained my point of perception and you go off spiraling into a further rabbit hole that estranges my entire point.
---
Yes eve is a long term MMO, but you either want to get people hooked and willing to invest in it long term, or you want to have the current state of affairs where we never get above 40k accounts all online at once anymore. Does it make the game a bit more casual? sure why not. 
---
Explain why having those skills at 5 destroys the entire concept of eve.

Us Australians were shafted on Blaze Squadron skins because we were literally in the offices, working.
---
not for normal players no, but maybe if you're in CODE. 
---
&gt; oh and I almost forgot, buy new skins only $29,99
---
dude, i love shitting on ccp for their 'offensive pricing' but lately, the last couple of rounds of skins haven't been as expensive. still not what i'd call cheap or reasonable, but they're certainly not offensive any more.
---
look at the last lot to be released, anything smaller than a battleship is what, 110 plex? that's not as offensive as the near 400 plex they kept peddling for gila skins etc.
---
&gt; Us Australians were shafted on Blaze Squadron skins because we were literally in the offices, working.
---
i thought downtime for you was literally the middle of your evening, after office hours had passed?

i know for EU it's literally lunchtime, and for US it's first thing in the morning.
---
I know that as an EU person, i'm glad i could snag some by connecting to my pc remotely - cos by the time I got home they had all pretty much gone.
---
it doesn't but it solves none of the issues you were talking about
---
you were complaining about caps before - how does this change the newbro vs cap experience at all?
---
yeah, they need CPU V to not have to fit an IFFA instead of DCII, but does that really change anything? and if it does, what about skills like rigging supports or WU/AWUV? these are skills that don't change the "power" of your ship, but adjust your fitting resources
---
i dunno dude, it just feels like this doesn't actually improve anything for their experience much. I fc'd in Brave for quite a bit and the complaints were never that they had to train CPU V but instead that they couldn't afford anything 
---
This cunt is correct.
---
Dude, we're talking about a major core architectural change. Something breaking isn't a "fuck up," it's not "CCP is so shit can't even get this right," it's an expected effect of enormously complicated changes. 
---
Sometimes you have to go deeper into the tunnel before the end, and the reality is shits gonna break.
---
And here we have my example of how not to act in local.
---
I mean look at league trailers, very cinematic with little gameplay, and those trailers usually do very well
---
Sure it is... Didn't you hear? In EvE exponential growth is actually _linear_. because 64 is 32 more than 32 /s
---
If you say so.... But i am wondering, are you planning to say something intelligent in near future? Or it will be just "you are dumb, hurrrrrr" 
---
You enjoy waiting two weeks - half a sub - to be able to properly fit anything? Not like, fit well, literally just fit adequately?
---
Sauce?
---
Well, part of that problem is that CCP has taken their eye off the ball and left the economy as an afterthought for too long and it is a mess. Since the dedicated economic team disappeared the in-game economy has deteriorated, not to mention the active steps CCP has taken to encourage the player base to buy power/resources, it only makes sense to inform new players how more efficient it is to buy ISK than grind it as a new player. 
---
Giving new players more SP isn't going to solve that. Sending them off to run L1 missions isn't either, nor is that a viability form of ISK making, even if they climb the ladder to L4s in a game with AFK VNIs, super ratting and thousands of Rorquals. I'm not sure what the answer is, but this mess is the predictable outcome of flooding your game with wealth and shoving it full of microtransactions.
---
May Bob save our souls. 
---
That is true
---
it is baffling why the skins are on sale for such a short period.
---
there's literally no reason why you'd want to not sell a product....
---
not like keeping it on the store is going to really cost them anything compared to the outlay of creating the skins to begin with.
---
Not difficult? That's a massive understatement. They would get it completely for free! Just ask the players for proposals and let the CSM decide.
---
64bit doesn't have anything to do with multithreading.
---
Thanks, I do hope that it'll work well, and if so the other ear will be done later in the year or in 2020
---
this has nothing to do with tidi
---
No don't I'm already nervous..... 😅😅😅
---
I do not agree with this. Sure, if you are looking for 1v1 fights, a new player will be obliterated. But its like that IN EVERY GAME if a few days old player tries to go pvp.
---
E.g. if you join Horde, you could more or less use a salvaging destroyer from the go for PVE iskies and use tackle frigates or e-war frigs almost immediately. Meta gun caracals, trashers, canes, feroxes take few days of training (2x for alphas).
---
Sure, optimal fitting, optimal DPS takes a lot more time, but so it does in every other game. How long does it take in a regular MMO to grind for optimal PVP fits, max stats etc?
---
Besides, a newbie won't be flying fleet battleships etc after a few days. Its normal that he should start with a tackle/e-war frig, see whats going on, understand whats going and eventually move up.
---
A NEWBIE SHOULDN'T BE FLYING BATTLECRUISERS IN THEIR FIRST WEEK.
---
This will probably put in me in the minority here, but I think that barrier to entry has been a factor in the staying power of EVE from a player quality and community standpoint. Looking at other MMOGs of its era, they're all dead or gone to shit pretty much. The corporate imperative for infinite growth is bad for this genre of gaming. I'll take a small, dedicated few with low growth over large growth with a transient community (if that).
---
so that people dump a bunch of plex into them to stock up.
---
You create demand by limiting availability, even though it doesnt matter at all because the next, even cooler skin is gonna come out in 2 months anyways
---
&gt;  the complaints were never that they had to train CPU V but instead that they couldn't afford anything
---
See this is something I thought of. My experience is just killing newbie guys at gate camps and talking to them, so perhaps it's a different vector of players than the ones you met but even so, why can't they afford it? Because the bar to entry is insane on making good isk, there should be package plans that you can choose that give you decent sp for that specific thing. 
---
Explorer, what's wrong with giving new guys astrometrics 4, and hacking for both skill trees to level 4? Normally that's a over a month plus of training, but now guys become equipped with the ability to actually become self sufficient in a meaningful way early on.
---
ratters, pick a faction type determines what bonuses you get to what weapons you'd have access to. etc. The starting player experience is not one of autonomy it's one of being helpless and constantly taken advantage of and having no recourse other than invest half a year to actually feel like you're playing the game 
---
and somehow you still make our shit posting look intelligent
---
It does work the same in wormholes. Wormholes are also split up into regions and constellations. But the chance for a wormhole to connect to all others in the same constellation are very low so you just don´t see it. That´s why you sometimes have jackpot holes with 20+ sites in it.
---
There we go, the voice of reason...
---
CCP:"64-bit will give us more power to do lot..."
---
"I'm gonna stop you right there and ask a question. Have you written or augmented any clientside code to take advantage of the new found power that will pander to both 32-bit and 64-bit client adoptions or is it all 64 bit or bust only?"
---
CCP: "No, POS Code was real..."
---
"Ok ok, fix Jita local ffs.."
---
He deserved to die.
---
What activities do you want to do? If you want to run missions in NPC nullsec, then what you are describing could work. Same thing if you want to try nullsec exploration. I kinda hate giving this advice, but with the game mechanics as they are now local is a better intel tool for you than dscan. Hostiles might be in a dscan-immune ship (e.g. the Lachesis with its 60+ km tackle range) or they might be cloaked up watching you. Get to know your neighbors' habits, and that will give you some day to day safety, but of course we're not talking about highsec level safety here. Thankfully the rewards are also much better.
---
fuzz is on the csm, he is as good a source as you can hope for with regards to specs of eve server hardware. 
---
no dude, its not because of the SP, like im not even opposed to the package plans but they dont do anything
---
we're talking stuff like 
---
"why aren't i making any money from exploration" 
---
"what are you doing atm"
---
"well i go to catch and scan down relics and do the hard ones for the good loot"
---
then you explain to them that they're lowering the amount of relics in the region by cherry picking, that some regions are over filled, that they need to get good at the mini game
---
same for ratting, its not that they dont have the sp, anyone can train a newbro vexor in like a week tops that works fine, they just don't know how when to not rat (neutrals in local) or are doing sites that aren't good for their current ship 
---
none of these issues are sp related, they're knowledge based
---
If they're providing a safe environment, then they're teaching *some* of the various mechanics and lifestyles. They definitely aren't covering all, or even most of them.
---
How many years playing means nothing. How many hours (actively) playing does. How many hours did you play?

Yes.

64 bit code deployed.
---
32 bit code retained.
---
Won't the 32bit code hamper any progress in the 64 bit code gains? like in the end... if the server and client can't both leverage the 64 gains wont't hat continue to create a fork in the POS code road?
---
Shhhhh.. go to sleep... take this thanny police skin...it will make it all better now.
---
Perhaps I'm disconnected with reality here, or the issues i'm speaking of are tertiary, but I'd definitely would like to see what you're mentioning be resolved as well. None of the wikis for eve are ever up to date, information even the basics of missile mechanics and transversals take months to find out about to know where to even begin looking. Information is a constant issue. I still don't know how the abyssal sites choose  their spawns or track etc. 
---
I'm doomed to die? That's what I thought I was just wondering.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to this if we just shut down certain regions for a while or reduced the numbers of systems. I have no clue how to even travel to the interior null sec systems without getting slaughtered on the way.
---

But knowlege aside, is there anyway a low-skil alpha player (who hypothetically knew everything there is to know) could beat a high-skill omega in a specialized combat frigate.
---
You're the fucking retard that came up talking shit without knowing anything that he was talking about, sorry you dont get to pass that off to anybody else dip shit.
---
yeah, but as in any other MMO game - you can pvp relatively fast, but is it optimal? Ofc not... Sure, you might not be able to fit a medium shield extender on your frigate due to fitting space, but that doesn't mean you can't fly the damn thing. Sure, you will die in a 1v1 to a pro with maxed skills, optimal fit, drugs etc., but so you will in any other MMO PVP with suboptimal gear... Eve is more gang/fleet style, you can still be productive in those.

pretty easily, but you have to get a favorable matchup.  you don't even need to be in a much larger ship, you just need to be in a frigate that specifically counters what they're trying to do.
---
* Bigger doesn´t mean better
---
* Rock - Paper - Scissors
---
Two basic principles of eve. You can shoot with a shotgun at a bird but it doesn´t guarantee that you actually hit it.
---
First you need to identify what you are up against. Every ship has traits. Together with its slot layout it often gives a direction as to how to fit the ship. Start learning the frigates traits (each day take one frig of an empire and look at it exactly) and their slot layouts. Shield frigs are usually faster while armor often tankier, generally speaking, this is not a 100% rule.
---
Almost every ship has a few way on how to fit it. Finding out what your enemy is flying is often key to an engagement. If you can get the pilots name you can look him up at [zKillboard](https://zkillboard.com/) and see what he usually flies. If you can see your opponent on the same grid but far away from you you can take your time and look at his ship very closely (depending on your graphics settings you might have to zoom in on his ship) and use [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/Wsf2ban.jpg) to identify his weapons system.
---
Last step is to counter your enemy, if possible. If he is in a kiting frig you want to get right up in his face with a brawler. Also ewar like weapon disruption helps a lot. If you are in a kiting frig and go against a brawler you want to stay away from his guns as far as possible while still be in longpoint range.
---
Of course you can also engage kiter vs kiter or brawler vs brawler. Sometimes it helps to keep your brawling enemy on 6-7 km distance and shoot him from the get go with more range ammo like Null for blasters. This way you can waste his time and mitigate incoming dps long enough to win a fight.
---
There are many deciding factors in eve pvp and there are hardly "one-fits-all" solutions.
---
Learning to pvp in bigger ships is bad. You will lose a lot of ISK not knowing what you do and thus only get frustrated over time. Grab a certain ship you like with a certain fitting. Lose 30 of them. Best thing would be to have a recording software so you can watch the fights afterwards and analyze what went wrong. Then go out and lose those 30 frigs. They´ll cost as much as a signle VNI and you will learn from every encounter.
---
The learning process isn´t an easy one but we´ve all been there and with every won engagement it gets more satisfying.
---
i'd like to add this: everything in eve online is basically the same couple of things, but with different mechanics at the base:
---
1) killing people who don't know how screwed they are
---
2) killing people who don't care
---
3) mutual stupids fighting each other
---
4) baiting people into thinking they know, when they don't
---
Hmmm, but would the energy neuts on a big ship work?
---
a fact of the matter is our breed is dying and the breed of fortnite is now. We can either try and bait and switch people or accept our minor numbers and be happy with it.
---
Like in the old days you mean :)
---
When POSs are removed, I suspect they will be converted into the small structures CCP plans to introduce at some point.
---
I think new players should be directed towards a single storyline (epic arc?) where they can, over the course of the storyline, accumulate SP until they hit the 5mil cap. Don't hand them out in injectors, just basic unspent skillpoints.   
---
So, the idea is that they will have 5 million SP at the end of it and are, more or less, free to go after that.   
---
The problem would be: would make it easier to set up skill farms. Not sure I want that, but is rather trivial as it takes only a month or two to get there at best. Maybe we don't need 5m SP, but one can tune that.   
---
Ideally, the storyline would teach you all you need. Combat, Overview etc. If it's a static storyline that end at specific locations, then we, as players, could enforce PvP in there too, like we are supposed to do. 
---
No problem I love when people pretend to be retar...

You sure do
---
Fuck you guys. I didn't get shit when I started. 
---
"Welcome to Eve! Here's your new ship! Get Fucked!"
---
That was my tutorial.  
---
But can I possibly beat someone with 100m sp even if it's a favorable match?
---
Depends on the reason why the plex price is going up.
---
If it's because the paying players are leaving, then it's a big problem for CCP, cause the players who could barely afforded to buy plex with isk might leave too.
---
If it's other reasons, players will buy more plex from ccp to sell it to players and the prices might go down, stop inflating.
---
The prices could also inflate because of players are gettinf better at earning isk from either ratting or buying it from players with huge stocks.
---
Won't affect ccp in any way if not the first reason I mentioned.
---
Healthy for what? What are you on about? It's a free market, the price is regulated by the players, not CCP.
---
Ohh boy
---
Well, you are right that a neuting cruiser/bc is a great counter to frigates. And with decent skills the heavy drones on a VNI will easily apply to a cap dry frigate. 
---
However, your enemies know this. If you bring something expensive and big, they’ll either bring something that’s bigger and more expensive, blob you with more people, or just ignore you. And good luck chasing down a frigate with a cruiser, because that’s not going to work. 
---
You should probably find a low/null sec Corp to join, to give you resources and advice on how to do well, as well as to provide backup when you get in a fight. It’s also a lot funner than playing solo, especially if you get on comms. 
---
I’d recommend Pandemic Horde, as you can probably tell by my flair, but Brave is also pretty good. I don’t know much about the other newbro friendly corps, but dreddit and Brand Newbros also exist. So does KarmaFleet, but their recruitment process is still broken last I checked. 
---
If you really want to go solo, get a ship like a Vexor, and go to lowsec and attack npcs in a belt. Be fit with neutralizers, scram, web, and a 50mn AB. I’d recommend a medium ancillary armor rep, a meta medium armor rep, and then drone damage amplifiers in the rest of the lows. Don’t run both reps at once, and make sure to load the ancillary rep. You should be cap stable with both reps and all but one neutralizer off, and everything else on. Use a 10mn AB if the micro warpdrive uses too much capacitor. That should work if you put a cap battery in the free mid slot. 
---
When you get attacked, burn away from the frig, prop mod off. When he is directly behind you, hit approach, overheat prop mod, and turn it on. Overheat scram and web, and land those when you can. Then turn the heat off, approach it, and heat your neuts until you are at about 30% capacitor. Then turn all but one off, turn off heat, and you should be able to watch the frigate die to your drones. 
---
You’ll want to use only medium and light drones here, not heavies. 
---
This also isn’t full proof, a good frigate will be able to kite you and stay out of scram/web range no matter how you fly. But it’s the best plan I can think of for a new player 
---
Don’t ever change grath.
---
I think telling people to train fitting skills first is generally a response because those players aren't sure what they want to do in the game just yet. Telling a new player to train bombers, for example, is just a waste of training time if they end up not liking it.  
---
As I wrote that I just had an idea: what if a new player was able to add/remove skillpoints (up to a certain amount) to specific skills with no penalties/isk cost? Like you could remove points from small blasters and they would go into your "unused new player" pool, where you could then spend them into small artillery or rockets or something. That way they'd be able to play around with different modules without having to waste time constantly training things just to see if they like it.
---
Exclusivity is a thing. It drives prices up as it makes things more appealing IRL. Thus, ofc it's a thing in Eve too. 
---
How would this work with skill extractors? They’d be 3x more SP being generated...
---
Well you don't see and nazis, do you?
---
I wonder why that is?
---
Why two reps? And can you link me to a complete fit? Also, will this work with a normal vexor? That would definitely be better, given that it costs way less.
---
that's what i thought i remembered, but couldn't find anything backing it up.   maybe just leave it sit in system and hope something good comes from it soon.tm
---
The same "issue" was around when EVE was at its peak. In fact it was way harder for new players at the time. Around 2010-2012. When EVE would regularly hit 50k players online. But new players were joining back then. So the new players need a helping hand is bullshit. Also malcanis law. You want to refund these skills which all vets have trained. Well now those vets have millions of sp to put anywhere they want compared to the newbies. More rorqs, more supers, more titans. YAY. 
---
I would rather see new accounts accumulate skillpoints by doing things.
---
Fire your gun and kill a npc frigate, gain 5 min worth of skillpoints, split over eauipped gear.
---
It's not news that NC continues to be shit. Funny but not news worthy.
---
I've tried to get into eve online a few times - I love the idea of it, but after a certain point training skills takes literally months which is uuh.. not ideal
---
As a delvegoon multiboxing feroxes in that fleet: worth it.

---
Evemon Works for me right now, but I had issues when CCP's services were down while I tried to add characters before.   
---
Can your each CCP's services (like: account management)? If you can't, it might be the problem.   
---
Agreed fully.  The core skills take up a lot of my time when I would rather be training things so I can get to combat with my corp.
---
Everybody sitting in either rorq or ratting super is simply dumb.
---
Can you give some examples of these fits that are impossible to fit?
---
When loaded, your ancillary rep does more. When it is empty, it’s terrible. But it’s reload cycle is a minute. So, while it’s reloading you run the second rep. Its also good in emergencies where you need to stay alive just a bit longer. 
---
Against a frigate, frights should be over before you run out of charges. So, while you still want 4 drone damage amps, you could put in an engineering equipment module to make up for your lower fitting skills. 
---
And yes, use a normal Vexor. If you win it will be because you are underestimated, so you don’t want to start flying an 80 mil ship and cause your enemy to call in some backup just in case. 
---
For Horde, our public channel is called “Join Horde”. Go there and ask questions in game, it’ll be a lot easier to talk there than in a Reddit thread 
---
for me f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 -&gt;&gt;&gt; SMART BOMB
---
ha ha should have played it back in 2008 that would have ben fun for you
---
just because you have a stethoscope (100m sp) doesnt mean you are a good doctor.
---
training a skill to lvl4 is usually around 1/5 of the sp it takes for lvl5.
---
a single skill lvl usually gives you a bonus of 3-5% (with exceptions ofc).
---
while it is nice to have those few % it usually comes down to acutal piloting skills/knowledge for winning a fight.
---
so yes, it definetly is possible and happens all the time.

iirc theres a clip in there of suitonia killing a 200m frig in a 10m alpha kestrel..

Ah, I see. I'll check it out.

Well done Squishy, I had to mute the audio though, I couldn't stand the high-pitch screaming and the constant yelling and swearing.
---
Can you just not include zarvox's voice on  the next one, will make for a more enjoyable video I feel :P
---
that'd be cool to have a skill point remapping but ccp says skill extract yourself obv
---
it plateus, you get to a point where so many people on the market, they will either not be covering the cost of the account with injectors anymore and the prices keep dropping, or they stop skill farming and less people are doing it so prices go back up.
---
I can use the mobile manager but I'm having trouble with evemon

Gonna add to this,

• Brave newbies     
---
• Karmafleet

• Eve University

There’s plenty of new to friendly corps that can guide you, look into each and determine what will fit you.

Just to be sire, have you updated to the newest ESI supported version? https://github.com/peterhaneve/evemon

For the last year or so this is the required version after the old API was removed.

Otherwise yes it is working fine for me right now.

That includes virgin ears too, I guess. Swearing gives more expression and color to the speech. He just has to diversify his swear words. That's all. :)

The thing is, I don't buy skins for ships I'm not flying much at the moment.

The amount of time I've started flying a new ship and I look at the skin selections and there's basically none of them available... ccp are missing out on a sale right there.

No way I'm going to bother weeding through every single change myself, but anything before that shit should be good.

You don't rely on isk/hr when you explore, its not some ratting with timed ticks

except he didn't  
---
his scout did
---
Let's be fucking real.
---
Drone mechanics don't leave a lot left to be automated anyway.
---
All a bot lets you do is farm isk for more hours of the day than me. At that point I may as well complain that the unemployed need to be banned for being able to farm more isk than me.
---
Like sitting in TEST’s space with 300-man bomber fleet while they are on CTA and do absolutely nothing!
---
Great fun 10/10

You could have 100.000Sp and be in a frig and kill someone who has 240.000.000sp and sits in a bling fit battleship, atleast if he is afk, for a long enaugh period of time. Its not about the fcking SP someone has. You could have created an account, when eve was released. always kept your skillq running, and never undocked before. or nowerdays (sad to see it happen) just invest tons of money to buy plex/skill injecors. Just because someone has a lot of SP, it doesn't mean he knows what he is doin. 
---
I know a lot of people in eve, who are stupid AF. Dropping a single Ratting-Carrier into a group of Leshaks. Happy birthday. Carrier died in less than 2 minutes. Why did they do so? They bought their sp with rl-money (Money-&gt;Plex-&gt;Injectors), and thought they knew what they are doing. But hey, they learned the hard way. 
---
Some weeks ago, we were roaming in some Battlecruisers, and there was this pilgrim, that crossed our way twice. We got him tackled, and were about to kill him. What we did not know about, he had a FAX and 2 titans. As soon as we landed our tackle, he lit his cyno, dropped the 2 titans and well... the rest is history. Mistakes were made. Should have noticed, it was a bait. 
---
You could set up something like a battle Venture, or something similar. They see you on dscan, warp to you, expect a dumb little newb mining unprotected in lowsec, and suddenly they are scrammed, neuted, and punished. 
---
Eve is very situational. 
---
&gt;You want to refund these skills which all vets have trained. Well now those vets have millions of sp to put anywhere
---
Lol yeah that'd be crazy, remember that event where all the old vet pilots during christmas ate like 30 of those 3 free injectors with no reduction booster and took total advantage of it? How is that not bad but this is a nightmare?
---

---
Would be nice if it's finally released
---
aren't there buyback traders for POS stuff?? 
---
they will remove pos stuff by offlining in on a patch day to allow you to scoop them and sell them before they will be finally gone
---
but last info i got is, they will be removed without replacing them parts you can still work with now, so you should get rid of it either to some enthusiast or find those traders (dunno where to find em)
---
I support this change. I train newbies a lot, and having to explain the magic 14, it's like grinding my face against sandpaper. Nobody ever believes me when I first mention how important they are, they end up ignoring things like rigging skills, and then they think the problem is isk, so they buy plex and throw blingy fits at things.. when they could just train what I told them.  
---
But I don't really blame them. It's kind of hard to believe the game is built this way, where you get into game and have to do 2 weeks of training to even be passable in literally any ship. It's stupid. New players will give a game less than 2 weeks to evaluate, so most players have made their minds up before they've ever actually flown a proper ship.
---
I am fully aware.  I am also fully aware of how badly this can affect the entire game.  
---
CCP's recent track record with architectural changes to the game hasn't been great as of late, and frankly, seeing how they've handled the chat issues, I am dreading the eventual phase out of 32 bit.  
---
TY. Better than the first way I spelled it.
---
They have already changed the reprocessing rate to 100%
---
You don't do P0 to P4. The options are P0 - P2, P0 - P3 (for a very small amount of products, which means lower prices) and P2 to P4. Well, you can theoretically do P0 - P4, but not with 3 toons. The reason is, you need at least 2 P3 inputs and another that is either P1 or P3. That means at least 2 toons running P3 and another running P1 or P3. And then you need a toon for P4. And good luck finding a guide for it.
---
Evemon works for me so far
---
[There is this guy](https://zkillboard.com/character/90519767/) who proves that sp or expensive ships do not matter at all to kill shit. It is knowledge and experience that matters.
---
no they're not, because they already cashed in on that skin. Thats what Im saying. Release a cool skin for 1 week only. Ppl invest a couple dozen bill into them &amp; slowly sell them for far more than the original plex value. If you want that skin you gotta get the ISK, which again is great for CCP, because now you pay MORE ISK than the original PLEX was worth. And what if you sell PLEX to afford that ISK to buy the skin? Well, you now paid premium. What was a 10€ skin for a week ended up costing you 20€.
---
/u/chel0007 just sounds bitter as hell. I can think of only a couple skins that came close to $30, and those would be super skins. I believe even the baller Machariel skins cost 800PLEX last I checked. You usually get a whole pack for $30 for multiple ships.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if you had to spend well over $30 to get the good skins in games like Overwatch.

It was working for a long time before this and yes I did use that version. I tried adding a new client ID and secret key but now it's saying the required scopes aren't available. 
---
Not to mention you could cherry pick it, leave the one can untouched, and/or wait for others to come and give them surprise, flying pvp…..But nobody ever thought of doing that.
---
Exactly! lol 
---
In all seriousness though, these past 2 years CCP has done a great job at helping the new players. BUT I just had a coworker join, and he still had 10000000000000000000 questions. Luckily I was to point him to horde, and now he's on a path. (Meaning learning the game with a group vs. solo and quit)
---
&gt;But knowlege aside
---
knowledge lets you know what fights to take and not to take, knowledge is unironically everything in eve online. a low skill pilot with knowledge can beat a max skill pilot who knows nothing
---
knowledge is always the bottleneck
---
Says the OP repeatedly responding, over and over, obsessed and seething.
---
Maybe its blocked for some reason. You at work? Or maybe it doesn´t work on smartphones, idk.
---
Its a guy who flies ships under 1m worth and regularly punches above his weight and wins. Imo an inspiration for every pvper out there, especially alphas.
---
My problem wasn't even the new player experience. It was the whole zerging mindset in nullsec and the sov system. 
---
For all the shit I gave CCP, Karkur and Co are outstanding in my book. Working with legacy code is one thing, working with undocumented legacy code that is pretty much written during beer&amp;brezel sessions is a whole different universe. I don´t even want to imagine how much of a pain in the ass the EvE code once was and to some extend still is. If you´re able to implement core changes to EvE without breaking things you´re a GOD amongst the"code monkeys".

Yes but how will you catch them? You have to realise that if you bring a cruiser someone brings a cruiser to you and it’s the same problem. Buy 20 if your favourite frigate and use some tips from ”2019 novice frigate yearbook” to determine if to fight or if to run.

Again, you don't have to align.  You dscan with a 5 degree variance, not 30, for best results.  You can check several anomalies this way, so if one is taken already, you don't have to then realign to another.  Scan, then align.
---
Yes. It’s about setting up the right engagements rather than anything else.

I'm actually very impressed he has 0 kills. There have been many times I will attack someone and they will die to someone else long after I'm dead allowing me a kill I don't deserve, I feel like he has to actively try not to get kills.

Outside of Jita, from my experience, it's 50/50, especially in null if a deal is too good to be true. I've placed offers and taken offers that were made because someone wanted to get rid of something fast. Guy I fly with found a carrier fully fit for 300mil less than Jita price. On the reverse side, I've played the PLEX market and lost a bil. 
---
Alts may not be for everyone, but for me, they've really helped out. My mining alt gets FAR better yield than my main, reprocessing too. My transport alt can fly a jump freighter that my main can't, but my main right now is better than what was supposed to be my pvp alt. That all said, starting out you're not going to know what you do or don't want to do, and thus your skills are going to be all over the place. Having a toon that specializes allows them to train into said thing faster as they can be mapped for it and are targetting that one thing.
---
I don't care who you are, everyone has some ship they love the looks of and want to fly it. For me, it was the Stratos. And so many times I've seen people bum rush into one, just to have no clue how to use it, so they're afraid to lose it because of how long it took them to get into. Reddit talks like this about Titans once in a while when someone didn't inject into it. Well, if you don't fly it, and it sits in your hangar, then what good is it? Even going with your smaller simpler ships statement, if you never use a carrier, then how do you get good with it? Everyone has a first time using a new class of ship, and this is where my statement applies. 
---
As for don't give up, that may be motivational, but I don't know how else to put it. When I got my "nullsec welcome" and lost my VNI on day two because no one taught me how to use DSCAN, I almost swore off null and pvp. When CODE killed my toon with full genolution implants, I rage quit that week. Yet now, I laugh at those times as the money lost those times was nothing to what I spend 2 years later, and I pursue PVP. That's the message I was trying to get across with my "strong argument". 
---
And where was the "hurrdurr about CODE"? Literally was just using them as an example. Actually please explain where the butthurt happened in "or just about anything CODE says ". I must have missed where my bitching about them was in those few words...
---
And again, you must have missed the part where I said: "**purposely** shit fit a ship"...
---
I care

i can say same things about WoW for instance - they show you amazing raid fights and PVP, but when you start the game forces you to kill rabbits and pigs for hours.

What's the big deal with caps?  Aren't they supposed to be the top of the pyramid?  Seems like the 10 man elite pvp gangers are upset they can't wander through the home space of an active 100 man alliance, delete a multibillion ISK capital ship in 5 minutes and leave.
---
Roaming nano gangs can easily kill any subcap targets of opportunity they counter.  If you want to kill properly supported big toys you're gonna have to bring more people and commit more resources.  Caps should be useful for more than just grinding structures.
---

That is the point though. I will not pay 2.5b on something that costed 1.2b and I'm still wondering what is wrong with me to pay even that much on a skin. So if it was in the shop I would shell the plex, if not I won't buy it and they are losing a sale. Your argument is valid if you presume that a lot of people bought it for investment purposes which would otherwise not buy so many, but that is where my market study jab at ccp comes into play .. are you sure the lets say 300 skins that were bought for investment are more than the number of skins people like me would buy over time?
---
Realistic ransoming is one thing. Demanding 2bil for a 300mil ship then getting blown off-grid because you were on-grid with the station while making this demand, is another. Especially when you then start claiming in local that you're new and didn't know what you were doing and thus start insulting me for killing you. Like I start losing brain cells at that point. 
---
lmao the server core is like 32 cores.

Thanks for the helpful info you guys. Most of you recommend to just play the game for what it is and not mind the negative reviews.
---
I'll do just that and see for myself.

Gonna modify this

~~Hello new, i'm dad~~   
---
what is iportant to know depends ENTIRELY on what you plan on doing, i reccomend reading into EVE uni articles or join eve uni and hang out on voice chat there to get all your questions answered 
---
Modify again.
---
\- E-Uni &gt; Tgrad.
---
Damn seems exploitable. Does this work with one skill or multiple too?
---
Your opinion adds nothing to the game but hate.

I used this guide ([https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Installing\_EVE\_on\_Linux](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Installing_EVE_on_Linux)) and two instances run OK at the same time in 4K. I am looking forward to 64-bit client, but I would love a native client and it the game engine ran on Vulkan. But most of all if CCP servers could run a star system on ultiple CPU's...
---
Looks like he ran out of cap boosters.
---
What are you doing where it impacts the fun you are having? Sure, flying bigger subcaps well takes a long time, but you dont need them to do most stuff.
---
For exploration covert ops or T3s are nice to have, but T1 hulls or astero works just fine. For combat pirate ships and T2 ships are nice, but T1 and navy hulls are pretty good most of the time. Same with mining, exhumers are kinda nice, but T1 barges are usually better to use.  For industry skills only let you do more jobs at the same time.
---
also, add collision damage. Bumper Spaceships: Online; or, Griefing Capitals with Corvettes Online
---
Depends on how many you mean by most and what type of games you play. I'd say most games have Linux  versions. 3 of my top 5 games (hrs played) on steam run natively under Linux: Kerbal Space Program, Dota2, Rocket League. For my top 10 games it's 7 out of 10.
---
Last i heard, it finished only one skill. That why people stuck in long skills, like fighters 5 or dread 5
---
For which bit? The server stuff?
---
Well, there's https://www.eveonline.com/article/64-bits from 2005 with them looking at doing it ;) Though it took until 2008 to get the the stage they were happy to release. (Found a forum post referencing a devblog, but the link no longer works)
---
Ok. I'm one of these "*super refined frigate fighters you talk about*".
---
It's what I've had most fun doing and over the years my sp just went towards it.
---
Although I haven't played much for about 1/2 years, the fundamentals of the frigate game (this is gonna have a massive Fw lowsec slant btw) hasn't changed.
---
________
---
Frigate 1v1 fits have 3 major properties.
---
Offense - the ability to kill your target
---
Defense - the ability to not be killed by your target
---
Control - the ability to secure the kill or disengage from a fight that is going badly.
---
------
---
In reality, these 3 categories bleed into each other to a massive extent. The more you learn the more you will realise this.
---
Foe pilots who have minmaxed their skills, fits and implants, it is possible to have "jack of all trades" fits that have a massive engagement envelope (i.e. they can successfully take on a wide range of targets, meaning you can take more of the fights that present themselves to you.
---
The premier example of such a ship is the federation navy comet. With the proper fit, you are faster than almost all other t1s, do  a very respectable amount of damage out to the edge of scram range, and have a tank good enough to give you some margin for error. Not to mention the popularity of blaster fits means people won't always know what you're flying and might blunder into a fight they didn't want (kinda like neut Tristans).
---
My personal favourite is the beam tormentor. My minmaxing means I'm still fast enough to get by if I'm smart about what I fight, and it's amazing 8.5km DPS means it can burn through pretty much anything.
---
The thing is, if a new player tried my beam tormentor fit, they would be utterly crucified. It works because absolutely no compromises have been made in the things that matter. As an example, I take a T2 web and meta scram. Because I can overheat the scram for range but not the web for strength. A meta web Vs T2 is an effective ~10% speed boost to a webbed target. That's huge. That's like a lowslot speed mod. When I fight a comet that did the opposite, I win or escape because he didn't think about that.
---
----------
---
What am I getting at? 
---
As a new player, you can't take this approach. Instead of making jack of all trades fits that can take on lots of targets, you need to make fits that specifically target another archetype. You need to go all in on a niche and accept that your range of targets is smaller than a more refined character.
---
For example:
---
A TD slasher will beat a lot of popular turret fits. It won't do it fast. But it has a good chance.
---
A neut Tristan will massacre anything that needs cap to survive and doesn't immediately make the perfect decisions and have the mimmaxed fit to back it up. And even then they may only escape.
---
Tldr. Sp gives you the luxury of pursuing versatility in your engagement profile. But a newer account can still compete when they narrow theirs.
---
Yeah that sounds like an exploit 
---
Join a noob friendly Corp after learning the basics of navigation and combat.  
---
Brave Newbies, pandemic horde,  goonswarm, rvb..  just to name a few.  
---
Unlike many other mmos, you can't easily get away with being anti social. 
---
Once you have access to socializing with Corp members,  everything else should fall in place. 
---
basically anything. even a shitty tackle slasher is hard to fit with all-0s. put a point, mwd, and medium shield extender onto a slasher with all-0s, and even if they're all compact modules, you'll still be at 114% PG used. no guns, no low slots, nothing, just those 3 rigs.
---
with all-5s you're at 76.6% PG used and have enough space left over for some guns pretty easily.
---
why change or add things, just run an old version of eve and done     
---
there is no point in "classic eve" if you patch it w/ modern stuff 
---
How many brexits of ram will be needed for this new client? Asking for a friend. 
---
Really? Because for me this problem has been going on for a while
---
But I do wish he still streamed solo roams :(
---
Thanks, this helps a lot.
---
Doesn't look like he brought cap boosters. Or ammo. 
---
just rollback to Revelations I or RMR with modern day graphics and 64bit client. That's it :D
---
Shut ur whore mouth. Mach is so sexy
---
Been a while since I was there but when I started there were no "Newbro Corps" as of today and I had enough to do with reading shit, flying around and learning some basics. So the training into certain things were by no means a barrier to me. After that I flew cheap shit and tried not to die. But it seems nowadays a lot of newbros are grabbed and thrown into the F1 grinder so there is a need to make them "combat ready" within a few days - not cool. 
---
Shit you're right, didn't even think about that.
---
The servers already use multiple cores.
---
The single core limitation which people talk about, is for the physics simulation, per solar system. You have multiple solar systems per server (as Eve isn't running on a cluster of 7000 machines)
---
The problem with multithreading the solar system simulation, is that concurrency is one of the hard problems in computer science. All the threads would have to be affecting the same data, which is troublesome. An example:
---
I have 10 HP left. You hit me for 12 HP. Bob reps me for 12 HP. What happens? 
---
Now, I might explode, if your damage goes through first. Or I might end up with 22HP, with your damage entirely ignored.
---
How that would happen (you and bob refer to the server threads applying your actions):
---
* you request my current hp (10)
---
* Bob requests my current hp (10)
---
* You apply your damage . (10 - 12 = -2 HP)
---
* Bob applies his reps (10 + 12 = 22 HP. the processes is working with the predamage hp because it has no way to know it changed)
---
* End of tick processes go round and blow up any ship with negative HP. I laugh.
---
And the worse thing about this is that there's no way to know what should actually happen here.It's become what's known as non-deterministic. 
---
This is why, at the moment, Eve runs everything in a single thread, first action in, first action out. It's orders of magnitude simpler to program and model.
---
SO hes who?
---
I can actually taste the salt 
---
It's more the point that people are obsessed with getting new players into PvP above all else and not often guiding them into careers and where to start with that if they wanted to
---
Some are outright toxic to the idea of not paying for the game IRL and have been that way for years, but it's not really something new players necessarily want to be doing when they're just getting started 
---
Hi new im old
---
I've always been in favor of starting the support skills at higher levels.
---
Not a good idea, get a group, else it won't work, I suppose you speak about assault frigates.
---
You are up against players with more skillpoints, omega , more experience and some mean little ships that can outtank, outdamage, probably outmanuever and escape id they really need to. 
---
They won't even engage if they think you could beat them and with a big ship you are exposing youself to other ships they, their friends or random pirates could bring.
---
If he engaged your VNI(assuming decently fit) and you couldn't win, stop trying to do it alone.
---
Imagine a smoother potato mode :D
---
“stop with the how to fix random shit posts” guy should be summoned here
---
I was using this online trading tool for haulers, and I naturally shop for most profit. So it turns out i'm not the only one using this tool and the ones selling the most profitable good were actually selling crap and they sold to eachother immediately after I had purchased it. I was quite a noobie and the only other time I had found trouble in my hauling mission was a suicide gank.
---
I lost close to all of my capital and days of hard work and then I decided to ditch it.
---
“stop how to fix shit posts” movement 
---
Change SISI to Eve second genesis 
---
Actually that F1 grinder/combat readiness is the only thing that kept me around this time, when WWB was happening. I was bored to tears my first time trying EVE because everyone told me not to undock unless everything for that ship was at V or at the bare minimum IV on only a few things. 
---
I don't understand why someone would bot in a rorq... Indy core makes them immovable - they can't run. Also the mining drones do all the work automatically... I'm not saying "there are no bots" I'm just wondering who in their right mind would bot in a rorq. 
---
  The one thing I can agree on is a high chance of input broadcasting which is just as scummy as botting.
---
Just because NC. are shit at using muninns doesn't mean bombers should be 300mil you tool. A half asleep and retarded FC would wipe the floor with stukas in a muninn fleet anyday.
---
If everyone sat at their pc staring at their client every waking moment they were ratting in a haven, the hunters would hardly land a single kill. 
---
I may be wrong but I don't think client performance has anything to do with server performance. The workloads are vastly different. 
---
The server doesn't have to render models for example. 
---
YES
---
almost all my fits involve swapping shit out to make it fit cpu/pg requirements - and I have maxed fitting skills (bar some small ones for rigging, cap systems etc).

I can fit this, but someone without level 5 fitting/module fitting skills (x x operations, etc) can't, unless you swap things for t1/compact versions (in which case you get less cap power thanks to mwd, less scram range - weaker vs kite and less shield).

basically every fit I make revolves around cutting down pg/cpu to make shit fit, and that's with max/near max stats.
---
Can't imagine having to gimp everything.
---
You could argue that newbros are naturally weaker due to having lower gun skills, etc; that is correct. But even once they train for t2 equiptment, they can't fit it unless they spend another two weeks training fitting. Kinda annoying.

what if the high plex prices are actually a complex market manipulation scheme by CCP to encourage bums to go get a job instead of nolife grinding
---
Used to be so, but now you have entire storylines to follow while leveling.
---
Storylines that tell you nothing on how to be a good Raider or PvPer though and that postpone the very thing you bought the game for (dungeons and raids... and, God have mercy on your soul, WoW PvP).
---
EVE gets to that level only when you join a good corp, until that it's that problem with WoW but way worse!
---
When your Space Truck gets "hobo´ed". :D 
---
It's a market. If people truly find it not worth paying to buy with ISK, they won't. The plex sellers will still need to offload it, so they'll lower their price until they find buyers.
---
That's.. that's how it works. The only reason the median price has reached this point is because both buyers and sellers are still willing to trade at this price. People speculate at the 'ceiling price' but ultimately that depends on how bad the ISK faucets in the game are.
---
And they're currently ridiculous, so I suspect that's the reason why it has gotten so high.
---
okay listen up. It takes roughly 2 hours in a normal job to make 11$. And how many hours does it take to get 500 PLEX ingame? To me, if you mine and rat, you spend way more time in eve mining and ratting, up to weeks and weeks more, instead of just paying 11$ for this damn PLEX. Just buy from MarkeeDragon shop 12 months of GameTime, it COMES A LOT CHEAPER, than on Eve Online store + you save LOTS of bucks. It's not that expensive, and if you can't spend 130$ a year, so you can play eve online freely for a whole fucking year, well... go back to bot ratting I guess.

---
And I'm probably not too far off, considering his choices in ammo the first time he got ganked and the last time......
---
It's not that what you're said is absolutely wrong (although I would strongly disagree on some points), it just won't fit for total newbie and could lead him to bad practices. It's better to give more objective and generalized advices.
---
I don't see why "don't trust people in Jita local" should be apart of "don't trust anyone unless you have proofs they are your friend", especially I don't see why last part not in list.
---
Alts is a handy tool, yes, but only when you use it with benefit for yourself. Just distributing roles amongst your characters is not a good enough reason to make alts, it just adds excessive complexity to your gameplay. Most newbies don't need them, the game is already too complicated. And by the time they need them they usually know why exactly they need them.
---
Favorite ships is okay, but it sucks when you spend most of your money to buy hull and shitfit for it, and then you got stupidly killed because of lack of any experience. It will make you poor, it will make you feel bad, probably will make you send toxic messages, and possibly could make you hate eve community and leave the game. This happens. That's why it is considered a lot better to spend on your ship only part of your money, so losing this ship would not fuck you up too much. About your example with Stratios - first I'd start with drone ships in general (Tristan), then depending on what I'm planning to use Stratios for - Vexor/VNI or t1 exploration frigates. I would take Stratios only when losing one won't make me dirt poor and when I'll be confident enough that I can effectively use most of its functions. Set a goal, learn how to get to it.
---
Purposely shit fit is a strange advice for a newbies, because they already do it instinctively.
---
No u don't, bad bot!
---
Well, stupid you for listening to those people. 
---
It "romantic past" now but back in the golden age of low-sec there were tons of newbies flying around in cheap frigates and didn´t give a fuck about skills trained to IV/V. You saw a lot of shitfits, some really funny ones, some where you thought "You clearly put some thought into your fit but sadly this doesn´t work like this in EvE" and some decent fits of course. 
---
My first fits were Merlins and Condors and I got wrecked by off-grind HG snake pilots and couldn´t figure out why the fuck these guys are so crazy fast. It was a fun experience non the less. 
---

---
Stupid me? I was a brand new player. The first people you meet who give you advice in eve have a disproportionate effect on how you play the game.
---

Nobody "got owned" by any supers. Just pointing out how ridiculous it is.
---
dute morti mati de pula ce esti
---
The best thing they did in recent times was tying this SP to the tutorial quests. 
---
The core skills, all told, are about 1-1.5m SP I would estimate, and represents a negligible sum for Alpha accounts (because (1) it is tied to actually playing the tutorial through, and (2) it's still far below the 5m SP threshold; you could have a billion accounts training in Alpha to 5m SP). It would affect the injector market till they actually go Omega thereafter.
---
There will be an issue, like the previous version of the free skills taught in the tutorial (which was giving players 200,000 - 250,000 free SP unallocated if the skill had already been trained), but on balance I think the effect would be negligible in the long run.
---
Uhhuh.
---
just seed dreads and adapt 
---
A proper solo frigate elite PvPier is just going to not engage if the match is not in his favor ...
---
Do not forget drones 5.  
---
It is essentially for pretty much any major ship, almost everything uses drones.  
---
I do agree with the cpu/capacitor though as it makes fitting a nightmare for sharing fits.  
---
Or have, in the case of NCdot
---
Have been doing cosmic sig (mostly relic sites) just to get the blue mats for T2 indy building.

I think I’m going to make some enquiries in to finding a bigger, numpty friendly corp in a WH or null 👍

Listen to reasoning not just to some random stuff people tell you? :) 
---
I mean, it´s reddit and I am not free of throwing out random shit but come on, don´t be a sheep and think for yourself. 
---
&gt;The first people you meet who give you advice in eve have a disproportionate effect on how you play the game.
---
This might be true for you but again, question things and ask those people for their reasons. I´ve met people who were telling me you need dedicated scanning alts to have fun in w-space and that you need to have certain scanning skills at IV and so on and so forth. I present you mister no-life who enjoys scanning whole chains with pretty much non existing skills. He is not time efficient nor is it a fun gameplay to me but hey, he´s doing it and doesn´t care for the other people telling him he has to have certain skills at IV/V. 
---
Stop, pls stop
---
Just play the game
---
&gt;Learn as much as possible before you decide where you want to go. Talk to people about the various benefits and drawbacks of the high, low, null, and wormhole life. Figure out how you want to fly, and then pick a corp that fits with that style. And if it turns out that you're not a good fit with that corp, it is perfectly acceptable to dump them and find a new one. 
---
Take this to heart /u/snoot-p! Like really do. 
---
When you start a new char no matter if new player or simply another char for your needs you will be spammed by the "Newbro corp recruiters" and some others entities. Ignore them for now and figure things out. Joining EvE-Uni as suggested is not a bad start for sure. Those folks exist to teach you not to keep you and make you another cog in their mashine. If you end up joining a newbro corp after a while that´s fine just try to make up your mind before you join the "meatgrinder". :)

On average, the hull of a super is 11.5-13b, then a proper fitting + fighters adds around 3-5b. A proper pod adds another 3-10b (Armor heads cost more \*Cough\* HG-1008)
---
So, on the cheap end, they are 17.5b, on the expensive, 28 ish. (This is goon price btw, where they are cheapest. 
---
So yes, they are quite expensive, if you don't enjoy them being able to kill you, stay away from them. 
---
What kind of drink?
---
Come to wormholes, no supers, less goons, more freedom, randomized map, never the same flanders.
---
I sent this to CCP months ago and I think I even posted on here and CCP Falcon said on the board it had been fixed...but to send in another petition if it was still happening.
---
This all stems from the fact that CCP does not update the training status until your next login.
---
Speaking from your extensive small gang experience or just as a typical goon krab?
---
&gt; CCP trailers are so damn cool.
---
Do you not feel at least a little bit sorry for the voice actress who got handed that script.
---
Cherry Pepsi max. I'm addicted to it. I drink way too much of the stuff.
---
I would absolutely love to be able to pulp the useless skills I put in when I was a newbie and knew nothing, and put them towards something with the same SP value.  And that's as someone with a healthy amount of non-injected SP on multiple chars.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
I like this idea.

I was expecting something alcoholic but I'll accept Pepsi as an answer

The default overview is cancer to work with, if you need any more overview tabs such as mining or whatever you can add the default mining tab or another preset (make new tab, right click new tab, load presets/defaults). I personally add an 'all' tab on my alts since sometimes you need to click on objects that you normally wouldnt.
---
Also, I would suggest enabling all brackets on combat (not big fleet combat since that would lag your game out) and misc. This is to allow you to see all ships, including certain npc ships not enabled by default that would be nice to see if you are doing faction warfare, as well as make objects in space easier to click. To do this, be in the relevant tab, on the top left of the overview you will find a square of horizontal lines, click that, &gt; show all brackets.
---
Speaking as somebody who has played this game for many years, and seen meta's come and go. A small gang should not be able to threaten a supercapital. Does an Aircraft Carrier run away from a gang of rowboats?
---
every corp's welcome mail has a link to download some botting software mittani spent 200k usd on getting developed
---
OP, its not April yet. Nice attempt though
---
You can't really do anything about Coalitions, people going to work together if they want to, although this would likely limit super alliances from controlling huge volumes of space and just throwing supers all over it since Alliance A couldn't help defend (outside of ship to ship combat) Alliance B's assets. Although 500 is kind of small id say 1-2K max.  
---
Remove Local and Asset safety, hell ya. 
---
Except Alliance A couldn't defend Alliance Bs space when they weren't there.
---
I have a few keys from Eve a long time ago, and I'm thinking about getting back. 
---
1. I have 30 day trial key from 2-3 years ago. Will I get anything if I redeem it?
---
2. I have code for 4 ship skins. Is it still working?
---
3. Also, I have a Steam purchase, but it was bugged, CCP said I should delete the account, then I will be able to log in, and I will lose nothing. What if I lost everything?
---
4. Is there any sale right now which I must buy? :)
---
It will be very difficult to find frigates to fight when you are flying a battlecruiser. Destroyers are better suited as frigate killers ([for reference](https://zkillboard.com/kill/67362465/)). Start with algos, then try other dessies and find out which one suits you the best.
---
i got plenty of kills on small gangs before sirens and dromis with my super, the way i drop hasn't changed. tackle t3 and cyno
---
It was before noon, unfortunately.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
&gt; A small gang should not be able to threaten a supercapital.
---
And a super capital shouldn't be able to web, point and kill cruisers down as easily as they can currently.
---
My advice would be to reprocess it. Most likely the M3 is far smaller. CCP made it so you get 100% of the materials back.
---
Some people do use still use poses however. They are great for leaving ships in without a fortizar/citadel. Don't want to put down 20 something bil in a fort? No worries, get a POS.
---
Why rowboats?
---
Does an aircraft carrier run away from a bunch of cruisers/ destroyers?
---
He could try but die in the end. 
---
But Zarvox didn't make the vid, you moron.
---
Now we start to see the pattern in EVE’s Reddit...
---
Wait, that means we commenting ‘“blabla” guy should be here’ are also part of the pattern?
---
* starts worrying and grabs head *
---
In times of access lists not much is left to standings. 
---
Most important thing that comes to mind is contracts with doctrine ships. But coalition already face those problems and either use public contracts or access list controlled markets where people buy the ships in pieces.
---
Maybe it would destabilize coalitions for a short time, but who is there to benefit from that? All groups have to adapt their structure of organization.
---
The difference is ghat evryone has to keep perfect range, booshers actually do have to have a brain and coordination bewtween booshes has to be spot on. 
---
Otherwise you boosh only half of the fleet and the other half feeds etc. Because it's not a brawling doctrine
---
&gt;	“Don’t be a jackass in local.” - actually a good advice too until you started hurrdurr about CODE, no one cares about your butthurts.
---
Are you fucking 12?
---
And what, either roam for hours and see nothing but dead space or randomly run into a 20 man gang and get blapped?  I keep trying wormholes and they keep being terrible.
---
This is client side. Server side has been 64 bit for a decade now.
---
It should help eliminate certain kinds of client crash. (when the client tries to use more than 3GB of ram. some fleet fights can cause this, with some settings.)
---
In addition to this, the best new-player friendly ways of making isk in my opinion (I do not have experience with missions) is faction warfare and exploration. Mining is too mind-numbing and unprofitable, industry requires a ton of skills, and ratting skill and ship prerequisites are too expensive and time consuming for beginners (unless you do belt ratting in a destroyer, but then that is not very profitable).
---
For faction warfare (by my method you can start on day one, as well as be somewhat pvp viable), you can always use your main accounts referral link (you can find it at [secure.eveonline.com](https://secure.eveonline.com)) to register a new account to get those free 250k skill points, start as caldari, buy some gallente frigate drones skillbooks (drones interfacing is a must) and first get drones to lvl 5 and then skill gallente frigate and 1 or 2levels of drone interfacing and at least 1 lvl of light drones. Then you spend the rest of the skillpoints on other prerequisites for the fit you use. I recommend gallente frigate because the tristan is a great fw ship, less worrying about ammo. The other option, which assumes you do not enjoy pvp, requires a venture, which is easily obtainable from career agents after the tutorial. Then you fit it to have enough damage to destroy a npc frigate, you can find fits online. The first method costs a few million isk to start off, not too hard to obtain, even through mining.
---
To get money off faction warfare, you join your faction through being in a station and clicking the faction warfare icon either in the station interface or in your neocomm. Then at the bottom of the following screen you can enlist yourself. The faction warfare window also shows systems that are active, you get the most points in enemy systems. The rest can be explained in the Eve Uni article: [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Faction\_warfare](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Faction_warfare).
---
A helpful tool to use is [https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/buy/10000002/1000180](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/buy/10000002/1000180) (adjust for isk/lp) I recommend caldari since it is the easiest to sell as the main market hub is Jita which is in caldari space.
---
Exploration is also explained through an eve uni article: [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration) . Just do not access anything with covert research or sleeper in the name. 
---
Another unmentioned method is salvaging, which can earn somewhat decent isk. To do this, you can join any of the newbie corps that other people have mentioned, and equip salvagers and ask for salvage.
---
FW can pay as much as ratting, that is 50 mil isk/hour, except redeeming the isk is a hassle
---
Exploration is inconsistent in pay, you can earn as much as 100 mil in 5 minutes (just be sure to explore in sanshas or guristas space: check here: [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region) since they are the highest paying places)
---
I don't have much experience on salvaging but I heard you can get up to 60 mil isk/hour
---
You know, i don't even give a fuck about this exploit anymore. I just want them to have a dedicated balance team.
---
The scale is off. The AC, being the super. Cruisers and Destroyers would be more like dreads. And ya know what? Dread bombs kill supers. Normally for less than what they are worth. 
---
Meanwhile your here saying. "I want to be able to shoot it, but it not be able to hurt me" 
---
Hating PI!!! But for some reason I always make all my ales doing it when I have a chance 🤣
---
i actually wish ccp made the skin look on a nyx just like it looks on the preview picture. white color seems to be a bit dull in reality
---
I assumed we were talking about xtrasquishy here
---
love it 
---
It's beer o'clock somewhere in the world 
---
Add innertia damage too, sure you can ram your corvette with 5km/s and destroy a capital ship but you must first get to that speed with survivable G forces.
---
*for everything else, there’s MasterCard*
---
More times than not, a super without support dies. You must just not know how to fight them effectively. 
---
I have owned two supers, (Only the nyx made it to combat though) They truly arent hard to kill or defang.
---
No officer, I prefer adults.
---
Rejoining the game with already blocked implant slots... Welcome back! 
---
Alot has changed, other things are the same ol'. 
---
I see other people ITT talking about Fortnite and how EvE doesn't attract those types of players.
---
Those types of players would never be into EvE anyways. There's always been twitch shooters available while MMO's were. The players who are on those games isn't a problem. 
---
My 2 cents is a) PvE sucks dick (which many folks do like to do because we like the RP in RPG) and b) 'late-game' big fights between large alliances have some issues that I don't fully understand but lots of folks bitch about constantly.
---
If PvE was more attractive, than the story of EvE would attract/keep newer players around longer. The world building and lore is what brought in and kept many folks playing WoW or FFXI/FFXIV. Those games are still very populated. I think it's a big deal.
---
As far as the 'late-game' shit goes, I hear people say something about umbrellas being too effective and that titans or whatnot can be dropped in anywhere in an instant as some major issues. 
---
Here to unironically downvote a Seraph thread. 
---
EVE Online 2019 &gt;_&lt;
---
That seems like a feature to me
---
don't worry man, i'll drop mine on market in a year or two 
---
I will add to my comment, Carriers can be stong considering their low price tag (Around 1.5-2b for a avg fit. 1-1.5 for a cheap fit) but the counter to this is that they are made of cardboard and their tank turns into jelly when their cap reachs zero (Void Bombs)
---
Yes, when you black out in your pod your screen goes back, except for local, so you can still get some damage in there.
---
Hey that sounded exactly like nullsec. Beside that its 2000 man gang with 1000 supercaps.
---
but people do. and as long as people do CCP won't change it
---
Skins are not supposed to be always available either, there would be no point in having a skin if everyone have it
---
At this point everyone and their dog has 14 super alts so I'm not even sure I care
---
Take a look at [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) if you want a slightly easier way to deal with Wine - it's a Linux game launcher/manager that supports Steam, Wine, emulators etc. with a bunch of user-maintained scripts for various games. Once you have the application, you can just browse their website for a game and click "Install" and it does the hard work (well not that hard) of setting up Wine for you.
---
No I'm talking on grid support with tackle. The only thing a super need to not die is a FAX and more caps to kill what's on grid.
---
Sure you can defang a super when you have a few lokis, but let's be honest there's going to more carriers and supers coming and that's how you end up with a swarm of fighters that you can't defang in time and is going to catch more of you if you try to defang, so you end up sacrificing a few ship because why should carriers and supers need tackle like every other ship in the game right ?
---
Ditch that list and add only 1 item instead:
---
\-bots
---
A Gnosis will annihilate any frigate it can catch, but unless the pilot is AFK or tackled by something much smaller and faster first you won't catch them. Trying to solo in losec, or anywhere, as a Alpha is playing Eve on ultra-hard mode. Find a corp or join in some NPSI roams, or I fear your time spent will just become more expensive as well as continue to be just as frustrating.
---
So were back to, you want them to be able to shoot and tackle them, but they shouldn't be able to do this to you? Would also like to point out, supers have mid slots to, they fit points in there to.   
---
At X47 (Armor Timer) I was in my nyx with a heavy warp scrambler trying to point titans lol. 
---
More ISK InGame due the Rorqual und Super making money option - so PLEX goes up... its a normal thing.
---
More Money means higher prices.
---
How were the events failed events exactly? 
---
You'll still want to go nearly full potato, this isnt likely to help framerate much
---
Where have you seen that I wanted them to be able tackle ? I said they should web and point and they shouldn't apply as well as they currently do on cruiser and down.
---
&gt; they fit points in there to.
---
I have no issue with that.
---
&gt; At X47 (Armor Timer) I was in my nyx with a heavy warp scrambler trying to point titans lol.
---
Good, no issues with that.
---
But why do subcaps need a way to fight supers?
---
CCP did the right thing to make the start easier for new players.
---
When we started we were all new, now it would be a lonely experience for a new player to go through all that.
---
Isnt boot camp just dual booting, not virtualization?
---
Turns out there weren't enough of those and now chat is broken while the servers are on fire. CCP also squandered over a decade's worth of earnings on multiple failed projects along the way, but 17 years of being largely unconcerned with expanding the player base kinda has consequences.
---
My bad, I thought you were the OP. Apologies. 
---
They don't actually apply very well to cruisers as long as the cruiser isn't MWD'ing everywhere. L. Fighters do, but thats barely 2k dps. Thats basically 2 battleships. (or 1 Vindicator) Long-Range bombers ( Restricted to SuperCarriers) can apply decent damage, but those are massive and slow and can easily be killed. 
---
Oh, is it gone?  I've got one in Jita.  Can't decide whether to activate it on my super pilot or sell it in 12 months time. :p
---
What the fuck is this 'we' shit?
---
A Drake
---
Nothing says he would remain if you did not do that.
---
However everything says you make the site spawn later, thus you lose some money.
---
Yeah but you know folks will bitch about that fix so there will need to be a new fix for the fix for the fix posts.
---
Alright, thanks for entertaining this caplet question of mine.
---
200k USD? Shit I woulda made it for 15 rubles and a pickled herring sandwich.
---
Start by removing remaps and possibly learning implants

---
&gt; fighting outgunned and outnumbered is what lowsec piracy is all about 
---
i thought it was lvl 5 missions
---
I completely agree the base skills that apply to all ships should be fast to train *(Thinking 5 hours to get to level V)*.  Being cap stable and getting the most out of any ship you can fly in terms of basic operation I feel is important.  In regards to the weapon skills my stance is that the basic operation should be faster, but not as fast as the basic ship operations.    
---
You pretty much summed up my experience as a new player fairly well.  As in hating the fact I was spending so much time on basic passive skills instead of skills that work me towards a new ship / fitting.  
---
Except you need to MWD to not be pointed but sirens and what ever is coming, or you use 100MN AB and then dromis are there to catch you, get his friend siren to point you, and then you're pretty much ded because the fighter are going to apply to you. And if logi try to save you, they also get pointed, webbed, and they are also going to die.
---
Been there, done that. I'm fine with it when there is a few tackle frigs and AF coming to scram or web us, but it doesn't seem balance to me that a couple of ships can do all of it. Defanging 3 / 4 sirens or dromis is still going to cost you a ship or two. 
---
wts nyx police skin 2.8b
---
By the time you can afford skill injectors (in game) you are not really a new player anymore. 
---
When I started I couldn't even imagine anyone spending a fortune like 700mil+ on just &lt;10 days worth of SP.
---
I think all sites should be on a timer that starts as soon as the hack attempt starts 
---
i'm gay
---
Sirens/Dromi's run in packs of three and they have fairly large sigs. A cruiser should be easily able to kill them quickly, and are you trying to tell me that with logi on grid, you, or they cannot tank 2-6k dps? Incursioners tank 10-15k of dps that is applied a whole of a lot better than supers. Sounds like you just need more/better logi. 
---
nope, 32b refers to the operation code of the processor. Among them is the move of data to/from memory, which takes a register as parameter. The registers have same size as the operation codes, that allows you to put and get them from the registers.
---
Of course, 32 b for memory address refers to the number of houses in a STREET, not in a town. if you refer to another street, another town, each with 32b too
---
Ok, let's make this simpler:
---
**The way skins normally work**
---
1) CCP releases skin
---
2) People buy skin as they need it
---
3) New skins come out, people lose interest in the old skin
---
4) Old skin sales plummet to nothing, repeat for every new skin
---
**The way** *limited* **skins work**
---
1) CCP releases *limited* skin
---
2) People buy it quickly because they know it's going soon
---
3) More people buy it because they know they can't get it later in case they end up using the ship
---
4) Marketeers buy it up in larger quantities because they know it will be worth a lot later on when people want it and can't buy it
---
5) Next time a limited skin goes on sale, people buy it even if they don't want it because FOMO.
---
**Why CCP likes this**
---
1) Faster, and often larger, cash injection from people using PLEX to buy the skin (or at least getting PLEX - which is essentially a liability - off their books)
---
2) They know they can release it down the track for another fast cash injection
---
3) The metrics look way better on paper - high uptake over a short period is far more attractive to investors and stakeholders if you can replicate it regularly (see below)
---
4) It encourages people to buy the latest flashy skin - skins are getting nicer over time, and instead of long burns where people will wait to see what comes out, people are more likely to buy while they can
---
4.5) CCP can make skins fairly quickly, so they can keep cycling through the 'limited skin' loop and keep getting high player investment from short skin sales.
---
5.75) This is also why they do those regular "skins being removed permanently from the market" sales - people invest in skins that won't be available, and it frees up more space for them to release new skins as above.

The one thing that turned me away were alts. And how often the system is implicitly or explicitly balanced around having alts. From my understanding, the game has such a unique system with trade and real distances, real leadership with groups forming around real people, lifetime learning, unchangeable character name and reputation linked to it etc etc etc. 
---
Allowing one person to have multiple characters and multiple accounts completely took the fun away for me. All of the above have ways to “cheat” the system on your own, to various degrees.
---
Of course I understand there is no way ccp could survive without all the people paying for multiple plex. What a shame
---
So I guess it remains that way until someone comes along and creates a similar game mechanic
---
okay
---
The biggest difference between EVE and most other MMOs is that in those other games actively playing improves your character and you can reach "end game" in a matter of days if you spend the time to grind it out.  In EVE all the cool stuff they show in trailers takes months of time to reach the SP required and by then new players get burnt out because they don't get a chance to experience any of that cool stuff organically.    
---
EVE is a great game, but being a new player with no SP is painful.  Can a new player spec into a decent ship fitting within 1 - 2 months? Yeah, but that is only that one fitting / ship type... and that is still 1 - 2 months of real time that they cannot affect through actively playing the game.  
---
i think him screaming and sperging for 30 minutes instead of going "well fuck, GF" is hurting the game more than him getting turbodunked 
---
Yeah, and they had good reasoning, and were good players. Problem was, like many eve vets, they can't separate their prioritize and knowledge levels from new players?  
---
Also I'd like to point out your trashing someone for being trusting and naive.. AS A NEW PLAYER. 8 years ago. Seriously fuck right off m8 with the "maybe u bro" shit
---
F1 siege , F2 Shield Booster , F3 Cyno , F4 Panic 
---
Look outside of your scope please. 100MN web lokis are the only thing that have a chance of surviving because they can web fighters and have some drones, but once you're get outside that you're just going to get swarm by fighters and die, and even in 100MN lokis it's still going to happen and you're going to bleed ships worth more than a carrier. There shouldn't be a single doctrine barely able to escape the counter escalation in the game. Carriers and supers shouldn't be the one most polyvalent tools in the game, because clearly right now, there are.
---
Courier missions, they're another trade commodity, same as many others.
---
One of my favorites is "A lot of money."
---
YOU GOT THIS!
---
I have a couple sitting around in hopes of exactly this
---
Players here keep repeating that skill points don't matter, that an expensive ship won't necessarily mean you'll get the victory royale, but that's still bull between a 100,000 SP, 1,000,000 SP, or hell maybe a 5,000,000 SP.  There will be a disadvantage between two droneboats fit the same but with different SP totals in drone skills.  That's the point of training the skills up; they increase the capability of your ship's attributes.  A droneboat with a drone skill average level at 3 is going to have a distance disadvantage against someone with an average of level 5 just because the attributes add up in versatility.  Extremely likewise, if a T1 destroyer goes against a destroyer rocking T2 guns (gauging the player skills at a similar level), then the T2 fit destroyer will have a field advantage due to the disparity between T1 and T2 modules.  Excessively likewise, having low fitting skills will put you at a horrible disadvantage soloing a max-fitting-skilled ship, as they can fit better modules/more modules.  Of course skill plays a big point, but it's still a major disadvantage between new players and old vets.
---
Judging by the questions being asked here, you're going to get caught and die in a fire.
---
\- Speak to your new corp mates and ask for recommendations (dont ffs rely on reddit)
---
\- Fly a VNI for a while while you get used to operating in your new space (not sure if you're new to null)
---
\- Master fighter AND carrier control, including understanding the blue circles and how to move/command fighters and not your carrier and vice versa.
---
Warping in at perfect boosh + bomb distance... 10/10

the "we" is the 74 other toons of yours that you ~~imput broadcast to~~ tab really quickly trough, pressing F1 on each one of em 
---
You must relize that just because a Loki excels at defanging, its not the only ship that is capable of doing it. 
---
Actually, small boat swarms are considered one of the major threats to American super-carriers. The Iranian Republican Guards regularly drill speedboat swarm tactics in the Persian gulf and China has developed the 56-boat (that’s the name, not the count) drone boat swarm to attack them. America is also said to be developing a drone boat swarm attack option should it ever end up in a peer state conflict.
---
American ships have actually been forced to maneuver to avoid harassment by Iranian swarm boats. So yes, super-carriers do run away from speedboats.

how to ghost train
---
1) train skills as omega, set massive queue
---
2) let your toonie lapse while logged in
---
3) log off quickly after your account lapsing
---
4) skills queue will continue training, just remember to reomega ur account before you login
---
how i've been doing it for about a year now
---
why not make newbs fly battleships w/ large guns on day one?   
---
the game teaches you to be patient, and thats GOOD 
---
I ended up writing far too long a comment on this, so I guess I'll chuck it here for those who aren't aware why CCP does these (there seems to be at least a few people around who think they're throwing away money):
---
**1)** CCP releases skin
---
**2)** People buy skin if they really want it, but lots of people just wait to see what comes out next.
---
**3)** New skins come out, people lose interest in the old skin
---
**4)** Old skin sales plummet to nothing, repeat for every new skin
---
**1)** CCP releases *limited* skin
---
**2)** People buy it quickly because they know it's going soon
---
**3)** More people buy it because they know they can't get it later in case they end up using the ship
---
**4)** Marketeers buy it up in larger quantities because they know it will be worth a lot later on when people want it and can't buy it
---
**5)** Next time a limited skin goes on sale, people buy it even if they don't want it because FOMO.
---
 * Faster, and often larger, cash injection from people using PLEX to buy the skin (or at least getting PLEX - which is essentially a liability - off their books). *This means more sales.*
---
 * They know they can release it down the track for another fast cash injection. *This is good for end of quarter balance sheets.*
---
 * The metrics look way better on paper - high uptake over a short period is far more attractive to investors and stakeholders if you can replicate it regularly.
---
 * CCP don't lose that much by limiting it, because skin sales drop when new ones are released anyway. Same way old iphones don't sell very well and drop in price when the new ones come out.
---
 * It encourages people to buy the latest flashy skin - skins are getting nicer over time, and instead of waiting to pick and choose, people are more likely to buy while they can.
---
 * CCP can make skins fairly quickly, so they can keep cycling through the 'limited skin' loop and keep getting high player investment from short skin sales. This makes the strategy long-term viable.
---
 * This is also why they do those regular "skins being removed permanently from the market" sales - people invest in skins that won't be available, and it frees up more space for them to release new skins as above without it looking like there's a saturation of the market and preventing people from picking and choosing too much (see point 5). 
---
*To answer OP more directly:* CCP don't care if they lose a handful of sales from people who didn't buy it in time. It's more than made up for by the people who bought it even though they didn't want it really bad (because they knew it'd be gone soon - FOMO in action), marketeers (knowing they could cash in on it after it left the store) and knowing that next time, you yourself are more likely to buy the next limited skin because again, FOMO.
---
It's reasonably likely, given how popular it's been and the market inflation, that they will indeed release it again down the track. Just don't expect it soon, if they don't wait until people forget about this initial sale, it ruins the illusion of limited skins.
---
Well said sir
---
did he forget to online his weapons? or did he try to hit 75km kitey stuff w/ Multifreq in Pulse lasers? 
---
Please join any WH corp then, scrubs there seems to need a dude like you able to define doctrines we've somehow haven't looked at able to  not turbo die to fighters, without the DPS of a wet noodle and able to defang fighters faster than the next siren MWDing toward you.
---
This is awesome because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Go 'head, go roam in a small gang in null and watch how fast they drop supers on your ass. Frankly its rather annoying that  how well one ship can kill a small gang of small ships. We don't mind capitol mechanics but when it bleeds into ruining a style of play its an issue. Just change the application to subcaps, what's the big deal? Not everyone is trying to win eve with capitol supremacy, some of us actually like to have fun.
---
Current Ghost Training method:
---
1) Train skills as omega, set massive queue
---
2) Let your account lapse as you're logged into one of the non skill training characters on your account
---
3) Log off quickly as soon as you've verified that your account is now alpha
---
4) Skills queue will continue training, just remember to Re-omega your account before you login next (on your skill training character) 
---
This is how I've been doing it for about a year now on 60 accounts for about 700 bil totally passive with only a 150b investment. I made a fuckton more 2 years ago when the initial ghost training exploit came out, and I wasn't banned for either.
---
CCP honestly don't care, no point in playing this game honorably any more.
---
&gt;Do this between sites as well to get better ticks. Warp to the next site, once you land hit recall fighters. This is the best way to get the dank ticks you're looking for. 
---
only with a super, its faster to recall light fighters before warping off
---
Correct, Boot Camp creates a partition and allows for a multi-OS boot.

I like the idea, but how would you balance the hp of the cyno item?
---
Too few and attackers can easily destroy it. Too much and the only thing it does better than current mechanics is a 60s cooldown to let other capitals jump in. This changes nothing for Rorqs, supers and titans that get tackled.
---
ehh
---
One refurb'ed stick of whatever amount, whatever speed. Also don't worry about a backstop... live dangerously!
---
I'll try that install guide again, but the missing "lib" dependencies had me searching all over the place to get it to work.  Ultimately, enabling DirectX 9 was the kicker for me when the game wouldn't launch from the account selection screen.
---
That's how the old ghost training worked. The exploit I posted requires you to be in Alpha state, but you can still use it to train a long skill like racial Cruiser/BC/BS to V if you don't have it trained to IV already.
---
I've had absolutely no luck with Lutris working for any game.  EVE installation always freezes somwhere in the process.  Can you tell me which release/version of Linux you're using Lutris on successfully?
---
fugg :D how I delete somebody post
---
Please don't further gimp new players by forcing them to use awful civilian tier ships and modules.
---
People naturally do not want to waste their time, and suboptimally flying an even more sub optimal ship is exactly that.
---
If new players want to PvP this forces them even further into joining large gangs or straight up getting zonked, if new players want to PvE they need to wait even longer to fly the meta ships for whatever PvE activity they want to do.
---
0/10 idea.
---
They do not fail, will detonate and do damage as normal.
---
Let me get this straight. His excuse is that he's actually retarded?
---
You see the same words as I do
---
Sure, there are always elitist pricks who act like their way to play Eve is the only one. But that said, it is true it is harder than ever before for a true new players to make a decent living, let alone pay for their own game time. PLEX/month is up three times since I started playing years ago, and highsec missioning payouts haven't changed at all, while mining profits have only gone down as a result of the Rorqual menace. Telling a new player that it a reasonable for them to PLEX their account, and least in the first months, is setting them up for failure and most likely burnout. 
---
Playing Eve to do PvE or industry, even exclusively is perfectly fine. But they should be doing those things because they like them, not spending 80+ hours per month suffering to 'play' for free grinding ISK as a new player. I don't think it is "toxic" to warn them that and suggest maybe they buy a PLEX or two to fund some PvP early on to see if they like it. It's better that, than have them drift away from the game when they question why they are wasting so much of their life starting at a mining laser or saving the Damsel for the 20th time. 
---
Why do people post stuff like this? You're talking about something that's at least 2 levels of abstraction below what you know full well I'm talking about.
---
The address size has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the size of integer a program can store.
---
yes let's put development time into a gimmick that has no true effect on the reason new players quit eve or want to play eve
---
:(
---
As if disabled people are incapable of petty theft.
---
I really, **really** hate people that use being disabled or anything really as an excuse to be an asshole. They deserve all the shit they get and more.
---
Step enabling shitty behavior. Nobody is above criticism for crappy behavior.
---
Thats completely untrue though. In EVE it all depends on what you wanna do. If you wanna start big fleet fights from day 1 you can. Wanna explore wormholes and make good ISK exploring and running away from hunters, you can. Wanna hunt other people with some friends you can jump right into faction warfare from day 1. 
---
Big problem is people are too cowardly to risk their space pixels and too stupid to read...
---
Also the krabtards in the rookie chat giving useless and misleading advice...
---
Never put all your eggs in one basket.
---
if I had to basically pay another set of plex to use dotlan as my in game map I would 100%
---
it's absurd how much better it is compared to the ingame map
---
You can. Grind isk and buy injectors
---
all of the fitting skills should be tied into several hour long missions that teach players how to play, not this cringey ass tutorial that tries and fails to woo the players into wanting to play
---
Where do you need to reprocess them in order to get 100%?
---
No, enabling bad behavior from disabled people is a very bad idea. It's not good for them and it's not good for anyone else.
---
Take a look at [this blog](http://evefrigates.blogspot.com/) it has a lot of information about frigate pvp and what counters what.
---
This is some next level trolling. Congrats
---
You know you are actually doxxing me here, right ?
---
I was thinking the same thing in that doing stuff in game actually produces unallocated skill points.
---
I think it's more that he's a jerk who uses being disabled as an excuse.
---
Mainly because I'm jealous. I wish I had an excuse to be an asshole all the time. It'd be fun as shit.
---
Honestly through something that will unlikely happen. Feedback and interation. Make it so it would take 2-3 ships at a minimum to chew through the EHP before coming online, where as a medium gang can prevent cyno being lit at zero.
---
If the general  consensus is that one side or the other is too weak / strong then buff / nerf the ehp. If no one is happy it’s probably about right :)
---
While this is interesting, it'd take a lot of time. It'd be far easier to just have the Magic 14 start at IV.
---
Oh well in that case shadow running another OS is even worse lol
---
Explaining things I already know doesn't allow me to purchase something that isn't on sale.
---
&gt; Why do i think this way?
---
&gt;Because it will just move what we consider the "initial skilling" to new set of skills. For those who are not aware - initially you started EVE with 30-50k SP depending on race - and this was adjusted to current levels (not long time ago ... but i guess it was quite a while ago and most of the current players don't remember it)
---
Actually, the original system gave you about 850k SP and where that SP was allocated depended on your faction/bloodline/school choices.  This amount has changed a lot over the years.  It just happens that I assume you started playing during the period where new players got 40k.
---
Im not 100% sure but a do not think Aegis Sov is the worst (though some work on it might be nice), I think its because we have a problem with the amount we can mine and produce, capital imbalance and citadels being what they are if you mush them all together they create a pretty oppresive system where fights are really few and far between with the obvious rorq kill or blob on a fort. im not sure if im looking at it correctly but it all runs slightly deeper than 1 thing being a problem.
---
Caps and supers should be removed from the game, o ly exception are dreads 
---
How would this work with asset safety caused by unanchored structures?
---
It's one of those things that needs work.
---
the seekers investigation NPE used to give you CPU Management 5, but they changed it recently to give you Industry 1 instead lol
---
&gt;...  we would see much more activity in New Eden. 
---
More like: you'd see more characters sitting in station, logged in but AFK 24/7, for the SP bonus.
---
CCP added skill injectors to let people get around the 100% passive skill training that existed before that. That was done, supposedly, for similar reasons you are describing in your post. Of course the real end result wasn't quite like that.
---
I think what he actually means is that they doubled the reprocess yield so that (at 50% rate) you get out 100% of the original build materials.
---
Kill someone's T3C, loot his skillpoints.
---
tennoheika, banzai!!!!
---
Thank  you kind sir; time to get rich now.
---
&gt; Imo, this should be gone:
---
- you
---
Before capitals tbh. Subcaps online.
---
 I have been playing for a few hours and I have gotten 4 ships for free not including the starter one by just doing random quest. There is no point in getting a ship using it for one missing and then dumping it because you got a better one. The biggest problem for new players is the enormous amount of stuff that you have to wrap your head around to do anything. It took me 3 hours to figure out how to get another gun on my ship. 
---
Yup, we're working on putting all the bits in place at the moment. It's still in the very early stages of the QA and acceptance process though.
---
To anyone who is interested, feel free to play around with it if you want, but be aware that it's totally unsupported for the moment so if it eats your cat or whatever that's on you. Otherwise please stand by, more as it happens :)
---
&gt; Because it will just move what we consider the "initial skilling" to new set of skills.

---
iirc you originally started with about 850k SP, and where that SP was allocated varied based on your faction/bloodline/school choice.  So, you could start off with a pure combat character, trade and manufacturing, etc.  They've changed starting SP/skills quite a few times over the years.
---
They're great for anything up to 3/10. After that you might start having issues. 
---
I expected a Razor post.
---
No point playing yet you are the problem. You also tried to make it seen by ccp, but you also continues to do it. Foul. 
---
Active means playing the game and doing something in-game related to the skills you want top raise.  Not sitting AFK
---
&gt; Low sec FW change ideas
---
no
---
Yeah. I'm in a small corp with some friends and right now I'm just hauling what we mine to the markets. Also the salvage we get from lvl4s.  Any web/apps that can be recommended for this to help. 
---
No. Because among the sea of turds and brain farts, occasionally there'll be a half decent thought worth putting into words.
---
It seems like you didnt actually read the post at all since OP very specifically said to make mission sets to get specified basic skills, not just be online for increased SP gain
---
you just want to make it easier to train sb alts
---
I'm not actually referring to people trying to Plex their own accounts, sorry
---
I don't think any new players should be trying to Plex themselves as it's always been a bit of a waste of time unless you're really set up
---
I meant more for players who would normally just pay for their account but wanted to gradually get money in game too 
---
It's like people forget that not everyone with all 5s in their skills are colossal morons
---
As a new player that will only take 6 weeks for a single injector.
---
&gt;but as in any other MMO game
---
Other MMO's make the act of leveling up and gearing up an integral part of the gameplay loop. EvE does not do this. Outside of sinking a massive ammount of isk into skill injectors your interaction with your skillplan is largely uninfuenced by your gameplay.
---
Because of this you need to find other ways of making the progression system feel engaging for the new player.  It is my opinion that the way to do that is through customization. EvE has after all always sold itself as a game based around player choice.  When when you choose a skill to train you should be customizing your character to fulfill a task. One that is hopefully in line with your play style.  Focusing on a certain faction type, weapon type, tank type ect. these are decisions that allow the player to shape their playstyle.
---
However, in the case of fitting skills we have a set of skills that are an absolute necessity no matter your playstyle, they can't really be called choices anymore. Instead these skills become roadblocks inevitable time sinks that the player at some point is just going to have to wait or pay their way through.
---
&gt;Eve is more gang/fleet style, you can still be productive in those
---
It is true that you do not need to operate your ship at max efficiency to be able to play EvE and have fun. But that isn't really the point here. The point is if EvE is looking to improve player retention then placing a major roadblock in the way of a new players progression isn't going to be helpful.  You can tell a prospective new player that you don't need skills to have fun all you want, that doesn't mean they are going to find the prospect of waiting multiple weeks to train required skills to be a thrilling prospect.
---
You'd have one hell of a time defining what is related to each skill, and preventing it getting abused to hell.
---
What if I'm training CPU Management, or one of the other core skills? Those are skills that affect basically everything, regardless of activity.
---
What if I'm training a market related skill? Technically sitting in Jita 4-4 station with the market window open is about the most in-game related activity for that skill, so that would count? - I'm not sure Jita will be improved by having tens of thousands of SP farm characters sitting in local 24/7.
---
Grind isk, buy injectors. Endgame in a month or two)))
---
&gt; Yup, we're working on putting all the bits 
---
All 64 of them?
---
I like the idea of time consuming and relatively challenging missions that reward level 5 core skills. As long as these skills cannot be extracted or count towards the 5.5 extractor cap.
---
I've read the post over several times again now, since I read your comment. At no point does he mention that.
---
If you know you can't purchase the skin, understand why CCP did what they did, and are aware that it's not being rereleased in the immediate future, what on earth was the point of your comments? 
---
welcome to /r/eve
---
It's almost like this sub isn't just one person.
---
Yes, more ships that need a purpose (design-wise) and need to be balanced and all other ships need to be balanced against. This isn't a terrible idea at all.
---
You forgot one of the most important topics: Compaints about the content of /r/Eve.
---
and it was fine until they stopped calling it a subscription and are advertising it as [add game/omega time](https://i.imgur.com/ft2bhu1.jpg) where the only hint that you are in fact subscribing to a service is the "/mo" after the price which doesn't have to mean so and the fine print on the paypal payment page that no one reads
---
We hardly populate one server. Do you really want to split that?
---
But speaking hypothetically, I'd like to see dominion sov with the current state of jump fatigue and ADM modifiers.
---
I can't decide on how I want my fighters. I'd like the old fighters back but in reduced quantity. 
---
Nah mate, only the 32 that aren't there already :engineering:
---
i dont have a rorq and my carrier got DDed by NC. last week
---
Tbh, everyone who bitches about carrier/super OPness in small gang has never actually flown a carrier or super vs a decent small gang..... 
---
Try and fight the SkillU Loki gangs with a super, lmk how it goes.
---
If you’re tired of super dropping on you, then bring the proper tools and fuck um. Webs, damps, jams. Bring those and you’ll fuck a carrier (just a single ship for each). Bring a few ships for each of those roles and you’ll dumpster a super. 
---
Oh shit, looks like we'll have to nerf capitals after all. Sorry bro.
---
Think you mean cordite blossom
---
I can sell you some blaze squadron skins if you missed those, there's mountains of 'em lying around since they weren't limited :(
---
My point is - there isn't necessarily a roadblock. Its more of an issue people not having proper guidance. Even in other MMOs that have talent/skill build trees - without a proper guidance you make a shitty character that's terrible at everything. Than you either end up stuck with a shitty character or you can reset your talents for a fee or something or start over again. Its the same thing really. In Eve at least you can skill up everything, you are not capped at some max SP on a character limit (apart from alphas ofc).
---
Those skills are not an absolute necessity, at least for newer players. Sure, if you want to run with T3C wormhole hunter groups, or join PL, NC, SkillU etc they will probably ask you to have optimal fitting skills. But that's the same as joining a highskilled clan in any MMO, they will ask you to have the mathematically perfect, maxed talent build with optimal gear you grinded 100s of hours to get... But for newer players - just jump in a ship, downgrade from T2 to meta and blow shit up.
---
It's seem highly unlikely to me that lacking CPU Management 5 or whatever has any impact at all on new player retention. New players don't even understand what that is or what it does and aren't going to quit over it.   
---
I can see it being an issue for people making alts which is where most of these complaints come from. But there are way more impactful, confusing, and boring aspects of the NPE to which we lose true new players to. That said, sure, some sort of active way to earn these skills as part of the NPE is fine with me. It's already in the current NPE, so expanding that with some measures to minimization exploitation by alts is fine by me. Just don't expect it to budge retention rates very much. 
---
&gt; Oh well in that case shadow running another OS is even worse lol
---
That's just not true.  Mac hardware drivers are loaded with the creation of a Bootcamp partition purely for the devices, so I'm not sure what "shadow running" you're referring to.  Windows typically plays very well with Mac hardware.
---
They want to flex their knowledge and they're too autistic to understand the purpose of simplified analogies, generally
---
Yeah that's fine. People are jerks who tell people that all they should do is PvP. :)
---
Systematic change does not come from the innocent, but from those willing to break it and speak up
---
An now you can jump to Jove space / CCP space
---
I sort of assumed people would understand what "active" means in the context of this topic.  Players are not active while sitting in a station.
---
Wait... are you implying that this subreddit is actually filled with a lot of different people that voice their different opinions of different matters without actually following one or two dude's agenda?
---
That's probably why they bot in Skiffs instead dude.
---
Infinite content!
---
No one complains about cloaky campers anymore?
---
The agenda isn't changing. There's just more than one issue that needs addressing, and if everyone kept making posts with a complete bulletted list of all the shit that needs fixing, people like you would sperg about that anyways.
---
He's claiming something a whole hell of a lot more specific than that tho. Something you definitely did not say.
---
&gt; OP very specifically said to make mission sets to get specified  basic skills 
---
It's times like these I think ofher players are actually paying each other to whelp big shit
---
I'd say "ccpls" but they obviously don't give a fuck.
---
Well said friend. 
---
They would just counter him by dropping some of dem faction dreads.
---
Learned it the hard way.
---
/r/eve is the most contested sov in the game right now
---
One of the most helpful posts for the op in here imho. Needs more votes 
---
It's good to see that there's some visible progress though. 
---
Add a player made overview management and selection interface. Anyone can upload one, we can all use any we want and also vote on which is the best. 
---
I've said it before the overview and well the whole ui needs a complete overhaul.... 
---

nobody fucking looks at your ship anyway
---
PI Question. 
---
Why do I need to create multiple routes from an extractor to a basic factory? 
---
I seem to only be able to route 3000 units at a time? 
---
I honestly don´t even understand what you are trying to say. But whatever you´re trying to say, let me make one thing clear, I don´t use this "u bro" slang whatever that means. 
---
Where do I trash a newbro for being naive/trusting someone? If you mean that I said, you should always listen to reasoning and not just to someones opinion, yes, I will throw that at you. Not for being naive, that´s fine but just listening to someones opinion is plain out  retarded. There is a difference between questioning someones knowledge and simply asking for detail/reasoning. If that was misleading, well, happens all the time time to me. My social skills are barely above non existant so more often than not I "insult" people by being honest and not thinking/careing about some subtle or not so subtle messages. 
---
exhibit A: chris chan
---
I've a better idea, make these skills only be needed for t2 ships and BC and above (or similar) so t1 frigates and cruisers, then buff T1 frigs and cruisers inline with that they would have been with lvl5 skills.
---
The bandwagon has upvotes. Welcome to reddit.
---
The reality is, eve is eternal grind.  I have played for 7 years and a billion isk is still only a dream unless I spend countless hours.  Why?  I dont get into pvp.  
---
You wont get rich hauling or mining or with industry.  Missions unless you are L4 dont pay much and the L4s are so so.  I get bored after a while, leave for a few months then come back.   
---
It would hurt the larger corps/alliances, too. Only the very largest can hope to defend their stuff.
---
The main disadvantage is, that removing asset safety would not address citadel spam at all. Most citadels are mostly empty, while a few staging ones contain huge amounts of stuff. These and only these would be picked out (they're not hard to find). Corps would even spam more structures, because this would be the only somewhat effective counterplay.
---
Does it matter if a pet makes the tackle or not?

This is on Monday when many veterans have hangover.

I imagine that switching all of EVE Online from 32-bit to 64-bit is the programming equivalent of completely removing and replacing the foundation of the Empire State Building all at once without disturbing the upper floors too much.
---
Yeah that's fine. I'm not exactly the most sensitive person myself. My only point with all this, is that it's very important to give new players the proper guidance and give them opportunities to experience cool stuff early on. If you look at the numbers, the new players that go into groups that encourage them to be useful in fleets early on, are amongst the most successful eve players in terms of retention rates.
---
Nice downvotes scrub

This not apply to all the things yet. I think. Only to moon mining stuff.

---
Fellow quin69 viewer? 
---
&gt;Im OK-ish with this idea up to Level 4 skill -- I think that becoming "the best you can be" at something ought to require some (more) sacrifice.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Plus changing this up will probably piss off all of us who spent real time training up.
---
It is all about if you prefer to see rant or a funny kitten picture
---
Wait... isn't it what Internet was all about?
---
Everytime I see "ccpls" in any form of a title I discredit it entirely as a problem because I just perceive it as a meme and some hickock wrote up something about it.
---
How so? Im just suggesting a new interface to share overviews, we just vote out of 10 for the ones we like. Just like online shopping... Ain't complicated at all
---
Some tips and what I have been doing:
---
\- Go for low volume, high price things
---
\- Import something that is probably going to sell quite good. Not going to give away my market but think about things that are being constantly used  up, lost, destroyed etc.
---
\-Import from HS to Null not the other way. Importing to HS has only one advantage and that is shorter time between sales but in HS you get waay lower profit margins than in NS
---
\-Best join a Null Sec corp. Doesnt have to be in sov null. Can be a NPC null corp as well but they have less people thus fewer customers
---
\-Use a fast aligning cov ops cloaky ship (Astero is the only option imo). I have one fitted for exactly this small volume courier job. It has a 1.9s align time with 7k ehp and a standard frigate warp speed. It can tank 1 cycle from approximately 17.5 Smartbombs so you should be absolutely fine.
---
I am still doing this but not as often as before. I made around 5B each month in profits. The ship cost me 100M and each month I imported on average 20B worth of goods @Jita price
---
Making a thread with a link isn't rocket science, but this link is rocket science so eeeeeerh ...

---
&gt;1 With fatigue, the ease of saving things with FAX, and the balance point between Dreads and Titans + Triage, large EVE polities have "Capital Umbrellas" in which they can abuse their capitals with minimal risk.
---
That's why players have FAX alts within jump range.  Don't like it?  Don't bring subcaps to an area where they have a "captial umbrella".
---
&gt;2 Within a capital umbrella, capital movement is way too fast. Cyno -&gt; Jump to cyno -&gt; Arrive anywhere in seconds. This particularly punishes subcapital skirmishers.
---
Works the same for covert cynos.  See #1 - same anser.  Skirmish in areas that aren't under a "capital umbrella".
---
&gt;3 "End game" capital combat between large capital fleets is very boring and static. The titans try to load grid, and then focus doomsdays. Play-counterplay is limited to a few gimicky tether effects, the Capital Emergency Hull Energizer, initial positioning, and gaming resists if the enemy has only brought armor or only brought shield titans.
---
Another complaint without a suggested solution.
---
&gt;4 Rorquals are too safe under a capital umbrella with their panic invulnerability.
---
See #1 and #2.  Rorqs die every day, even under the umbrellas.  Bring more friends next time, maybe?  Subcaps are capable of destroying carriers/supers/FAX.
---
&gt;5 Skill injectors hypercharge EVE balance problems, and synergize with ratting and mining capitals under a capital umbrella to create runaway economic effects.
---
Agreed.
---
That's actually pretty amazing. Not sure if in the second video the engine had issues because of the fire burst but still amazing. And that pretty color pattern omg. kawaii af OwO
---
What would be the benefit of this besides being tedious. 
---
I think it's a Gallente engine \^\^
---
Never got the hang of it actually. Really should if I want to make skillfarms.
---
Last I checked all Boot Camp does is prep the drive for a hybrid GPT/MBR setup that allows Windows 7 to be installed in a separate partition and gives it some drivers. Other than that it's just Windows as another OS you can boot into.
---
Yeah that's how it goes, just not getting why it still runs EVE slower when on Windows as compared to on macOS which is really just Wine.
---
Would you mind if I charge you for going outside?
---
haha XD
---
nothing changes Tglam, still an RMT apologist little bitch even now ;)

He got ganked by a pack of taloses in a 0.8 system
---
I can agree on the proper guidance thing, no question. Non the less, just following some stuff someone said is not advisable in my book. 
---
I had my fair share of people telling me I have to train this or that, do this and that and whatnot. Ignored them all because no one could explain me why except for "We need you in this ship." 
---
Stuff like EvE-Uni, Suitonias blogs, Finatarue when he was active and a few others are what I like to follow if it suits me because they actually explain the "why´s". That being said, simply jumping into EvE and just "roll with it" is a good experience too just not for everyone I guess. 
---
While making changes like this, can we have the old agent finder back? I've tried to like the new one. Honestly, I have, but finding mission agents with it is such a pain I've essentially given up on using it.
---
I shouldn't have to turn to an out of game tool that doesn't work quite as well as the one that was replaced by the turd that is the agency window. I'm sorry to anyone who worked on designing it that I've offended by saying that, but it shouldn't have gotten past testing due to the reduced functionality of it. 
---
You only need one route 
---
it s just rmt
---
Thankfully money can't buy skill in this instance.
---
There was a time, years ago, when I wished CCP to listen more to the playerbase.
---
The last two years, but especially the last month of idea, suggestion and rebalance posts changed everything. Now I treat the deaf ears of CCP the last protector of a game I like.
---
Simple he didn't try
---
He could easily just englarge and upscale the image... not hard to do...
---
Let me correct you here. Doing a task like removing the ESB foundation without disturbing the upper floors should be technically possible without too many problems. It comes down to money and how much you are willing to piss off the surrounding "people" building owners. Where hacking EvEs legacy code into the 64bit era without breaking it, seems to be impossible withing a reasonable time. Ok, one can argue, that you can simply throw tons of money at the problem and solve it this way, but then you need some crazy good code monkeys who are available, willing to jump on the task and of course the money. Pretty much nothing of this is available to CCP so well, let´s hope they don´t "fubar" it up too hard. :) 
---
Eh, that would only help a little. Back when I was a newbie and running DED complexes in nullsec, I'd drop a can at the acceleration gate's exit to decloak anyone who came through. Murdered quite a few stealth bomber initial tackles this way.
---
Don't forget the pointer size has doubled.  That will hurt the instruction cache somewhat.    In practice I doubt it'll be noticable though.
---
When I've benches math-heavy code between 32 and 64 bit (C++) the difference between them has been of margin-of-error magnitude, i.e. they're pretty much the same.
---
I post because you are wrong on your first sentence. 32b does not refer to the memory address, it refers to the bits of the operation in the processor.
---
You are right that the range of values of types is often de-correlated from the architecture type. Yet, 32bit does NOT refer to memory address. Propagating this is just wrong.
---
PS. here's a picture of me wrecking bad dudes
---
It looks great, but compared to any other capital ship it’s kinda awful.
---
Wish someone would explain why you keep doing shit vids.
---
Uhm no ty
---
Another more low-level video that's aimed towards people who aren't hyper-familiar with the game. If you have any things that you find people discovering EVE are always curious about, let me know, I'd love to try and break it down.
---
You can use a keybind that makes one button push do this (in one account, not over more, that would be bannable broadcasting)
---
Man how much did I inject then to go to my Nid in less than a year &gt;.&lt; 
---
Join a newbro corp. Horde, karmafleet, brave, just join one.
---
In Horde at least (I literally know nothing about the others sorry), we have a whole team of like 45+ people called the ‘NBI’ (newbean initiative) where they basically are always looking to help newbeans (new horde players, horde are beans basically) by giving out skillbool packs, free ships, and to answer whatever questions you have.
---
Moreover, we have a whole channel just for pings for newbeans. There are newbean ratting fleets, newbean moon mining fleets, newbean gatecamps and roams, pretty much anything you can do in EVE. 
---
I joined almost two and a half years ago and honestly back then the NPE in horde was nothing compared to now. We didn’t have a discord or anything as an alliance, we used PL’s forums for help resources and SOTAs were sent via alliance mail lol. Don’t get me wrong, there were still great resources, but now there are literal newbean focused fleets and activites. Pretty great stuff.
---
the revelation would like a word with you
---
&gt;complains about rotating door of agendas
---
&gt;supports rotating door of agendas
---
guess we'll see who will have the last laugh when the 64bit client gets released for TQ and r/Eve gets flooded with "can't log in" "can't see character screen" posts for days (at best).
---
you don't have to believe me but I never paid real money for cosmetics in games and never bough ingame money with real money for those or other purposes.
---
Holy shit - I did not come here expecting a logical, common sense based comment.
---
&gt;13.3” IPS Full HD 1920 × 1080 display
---
If you have young eyes and grab some dollar-store reading lenses, yes.
---
&gt;Impressive N4000 Dual Core 2.4Ghz processor
---
Probably not, but you can try it.
---
&gt;64GB Flash Storage + M.2 2280 SSD Expansion slot
---
&gt;4GB RAM
---
&gt;Intel UHD Graphics 600
---
Again, probably not.  
---
The game will certainly load and log in at minimum graphics.  You could easily do station trading and try out less-busy areas.
---
Fleet combat - and you could get into that easily if you want or avoid it easily - is likely to drop a ton of frames or even disconnect you.  And then you die.  So some of the more fun parts of the game won't be practical.  But other fun parts are doable.
---
Don't spend money on the game yet but give it a try.
---
Hex skin... 
---
I for one am disappointed that this wasn't a link to braxus rolling moros. 
---
Sure - you just have to promise to only engage 1. other small gangs 2. with same ship types 3. With same loadouts because that obviously how you want the game to be
---
Ok, sorry, I should get actual language lessons someday
---
This was a test firing of one of the new engines from SpaceX. Like, first test firing after being assebmled from the drawings. This is cutting edge rocket engine design here.
---
You would have far better luck making a ticket directly with CCP for stuff like this, there's so many codes and nonsense from the old days it's really hard to say without specifics. FWIW generally 1) No, unless it came bundled with some other redeemables and 2) skins are a relatively new thing so there's no reason why they shouldn't be fine.
---
... wait they don't?
---
It's a capital ganking catalyst...
---
All the skins available through the NEX store and not as NPC drops will have come into the game because somebody paid real money for them somewhere down the chain. If you bought any of those skins for ISK, you would still support spending real money for those items, and CCP gets their share.
---
Either way, OF COURSE 64bit client is coming to TQ - people have been asking for it for years now. It's obviously first hitting SiSi so CCP could test it with some stress, as it has more people on it than Duality, where the really new things are tested internally. You seem to be complaining that they are putting it on a test server and won't be testing the client before it hits TQ, which is not the case.
---
For the guy who wanted to apply "drive me closer, I want to hit them with my sword!" to space combat
---
And CCP could charge dollars or euros for these travel fuel blocks. Genius!
---
&gt;just seed dreads and adapt
---
You meme, but there is a very recent example of someone doing exactly that, and having a lot of success with it.
---
I think you can get into a dread with targeted training in like 4-5 months.  
---
I've definitely seen both running at the same time maybe that isn't bootcamp then.
---
I don't know who that is :)
---
I think he got burned out like a lot of people such as Chessur due to the state of the game (Supers/Rorqs online). Not much you can accomplish aside from killing AFK VNIs and killing the 10% of the player base that actually brings something that isn't a capital ship to fight your frigate nowadays.
---
Exactly! Also, fun fact it actually goes faster in siege...
---
only if you dont know how to hide the thing
---
I used to watch him from time to time. But I'm not interested in PoE, so I'll have to wait and see what he's up to next.
---
Short answer, no. There's no reason the server side couldn't be 64 bit already, and any remaining 32 bit clients will only hamper themselves. That said, 64bit capable CPUs have been around for a long time so I'd be a little surprised if there are any/many players out there who aren't ready to use a 64bit client already.
---
This is what Ive run into. Ive been playing almost 6 months and all I run into and which is why I dislike the "keep using frigs until youre better" idea. Running around in a t1 frig youll only find t2 frigs with much more experienced pilots with much more skill points. If you stay solo Id recommend t1 cruisers as fights will be longer and youll learn more and actually have a shot at a win once in a while.
---
Nah, only for standings. If you need quick isk the best one seems to be the Sansha tree on the Amarr one but even that's only like ~500m. If you have no soul left to crush Amarr Cosmos then cherry picking the Caldari one will pay 3-5 bill after buying all the unfarmable shit. So ends the story of highsec PVE.
---
You sound like the guy trying to recruit people into some space police group who judge people.
---
Sure it's not stolen from somewhere on Facebook?
---
Nope
---
More like afterburner but yeah, that was nice showing off for sure. :) 
---
Yes I meme but it's not one example but plenty. Even i did it only a few weeks back. Blue scout, dreads, logged of sabres etc. Scored a soup kill. Nice. Didnt logged in for an extended time after cause it's so much aids to setup. Don't give me the  "work for ur frags" card. It's an unreasonable amount of commitment needed to dread bomb anything and even more so it's a playstyle not many want to do. I usually hard core pvp this game but I felt burnout for the first time after that. 
---
supporting spending real money ≠ spending real money. you can do whatever you want with your credit card, CCP isn't getting a cent out of my wallet for virtual ship paint though...
---
Outstanding video. When I first came into nullsec your videos helped me a great to deal to understand a lot of the things I'd been missing in high sec. As always ty for the great video!
---
It was a joke.....

What's the point of posting a trailer from 2013?
---
..... Yeah I know. Was /s
---
Yeah that's probably virtual desktop or something. Mac has Parallels Desktop for that.
---
Thanks! It means a lot to know these sorts of things help people understand the game. Are you still in Hisec or did you move out to null?
---
Oh yeah parallels is what I'm thinking of.  Did apple really name dual booting?
---
Olmeca, there is a much easier way to fix this, without messing with cyno mechanics at all. The biggest issue with nullsec capital umbrellas is the population *within the jump-range of a single capital staging system*, that current anomaly spawning mechanics can support. There are hundreds of rorquals within the range of a single jump from 1DQ1 at any time, and using less populated systems outside the range of a single jump is heavily discouraged, the risk heavily outweighs the benefit. If rorq mining is the playstyle you're into, Delve is unquestionably the best and safest place to do it, despite all the competition. That's what needs to change.
---
The saturation point of regions is what's broken, not cyno mechanics.
---
Delete this plz, you are wrecking my RMT
---
It really just depends on how much you value your time. If you do still buy the skins for ISK, you are creating demand, and someone else will spend their money to buy the skin and put it on the market.
---
PLEX is currently 20Eur for 500, which would sell on the market for ~1.8bil ISK. Even if you are making 300M/h in ISK, that's 6 hours of grinding. I value my time at more than 3.33Eur/h, so I wouldn't grind for vanity items I can just spend some spare cash on.
---
Sorry, I should have had my coffee before posting comments on the internet. 
---
I realize this comment has nothing to do with the validity of any discussion of capital nerfing and I have no strong opinions about the capital meta. I just wanted to talk about real-world drone boat swarms.
---
But does it do local chat?
---
Just curious, are you disables like the last guy?
---
Sorry. I've seen people asking that question without the /s so I work from the assumption it's not :)
---
It’s my post you simpleton 
---
I was reading quickly on break while at work, yeah I did confuse that as part of the post. Still, as OP responded to you, he did say active which is what lead me to link the comment in my head
---
New players don't use Corvettes because they're redundant literally as soon as you can afford anything better
---
An intermediate rookie ship will be skipped by most of the playerbase given rookies can, even at their newest, still buy a frigate or destroyer without too much of a problem, but usually can't fit it very well or with decent modules
---
What little experience I have is from defending our pos into corps wormhole actually. Once I can get some time I’ll have to try and get into the pvp scene once I have the money for it lol. Thank you for your help and input I appreciate it!
---
I don´t think they get payed to whelp more like they are stupid and ignorant. Back when I was in Horde to have some relaxed pvp fun and a staging area ... I´ve seen things man, I´ve seen things. Stunt Flores was actively hunting newbro ratters and yet they kept dying over and over again. Undocking with him in system, not joining "home defense fleet", warping to belt and let the drones loose. Minutes later the crying in local was real. Then there was a pretty decent roaming fleet around and no one organised a proper response so the poor guys in "home defense" fed them hard. With all that going on a guy undocked a carrier to gate it three gates to the main Keepstar because he didn´t want to accumulate fatigue or some shit. But then it´s not just Horde, you can find the "drunk, high, dumb and/or ignorant" people everywhere. 
---
I get what you are saying. I neglected the fitting skills for a long time, since I was in shit corps for a while.  
---
But you are showing T2 fits, those should take extra time.  If the fitting skills only helped out with fitting PvP ships, I would agree they should do something, but since they effect all ship those I think it is fine.
---
Now I think it comes down to having better direction for new players, they don't need CPU management 5 for a beginner pve fit, but to hone it in, then maybe 
---
Jin I'm curious on what your feelings were on the new Eve gameplay trailer. What did it do good and what did it do bad?
---
Well put. 
---
Only hope for you is cyno velators or 3 day old characters in mining ventures but they are all bait. 
---
Good.
---
Now go ratting.
---
the graphics team doubles as balance, right now they're really invested in making dope skins (it's the space police woop woop)
---
i like you videos , but i hate that you talk in them , your voice just drabs on terribly. Any chance you'll try one a bit drunk , maybe shake some of the monotone off ?
---
I'm not suggesting you have to work for your frags, but if you want to frag people who have spent a lot of time, effort and Isk to make and keep their space safe, you also should have to invest a lot of time, effort and Isk.
---
Again its not worth the risk to my ship and my cargo to clean up sites. 
---
If you are going to do that the best way to do it is to leave the site untouched. Upon seeing one or most of the cans have been opened should be a signal that the site isn't worth finishing in hostile space.
---
This is exactly the card i meant
---
Fitting skills shouldn't be in the game. Same goes for Corporation management skills. This kind of basic stuff where you literally cannot fit modules onto a ship, or fly a ship that is fitted for you, or even start a corporation with your friends until you have trained certain skills, is just really stupid.
---
Don't get me wrong, the advanced fitting skills like rigging skills and whatnot are fine. But the basic stuff like you have outline in the original post, is ridiculous. It feels really bad to have to train that stuff.
---
(please try to see beyond the grr goons nature!)
---
Another issue is the community/domination of eve. If a newbro watches a rooks and kings video, joined this sub and asked about starting eve, he'd be jumped on by recruiters from Horde/Karma and Test. They would skip the learning experience and dive straight into Nullsec life.
---
While most people on this sub believe thats the be all and end all of eve, by doing that straight away you are missing out so much. What gripped alot of people was the nature of risk. Working hard to fly your first destroyer... only to jump into rancer and learn what being podded is like. It makes you mad, but it also gets you hooked.
---
Experiencing tidi before small fleet fights is a crime :)
---
Okay, so I'm overestimating how hard it is to replace a building foundation.  I stand corrected.  :P
---
yeah, that's what im saying - it should take time to train guns, not guns AND fitting. It has no effect on old players, just gimps new players another two weeks. IMO in the age of injectors it's kind of meaningless
---
No, not like him.  Differently.
---
all 3 point you say are bad ideas are purely large fleet fight, nullsec approaches to the problem.
---
if you had any idea what small gang, solo super droppers would need to do to achieve dunking on the small rom gangs it would seriously change the game in that extent.
---
like true CCP fashion, just frekin change somthing, anything and see wtf happens. if not enough happens, change somthing else. keeps things fresh.
---
They have batteries, it's called the Capacitor. Try flying a new pilot in a low cap ship through one of those systems where the gates are 100 AU apart. They'll run out of cap and only make it partway.
---
But the game would be drastically different if Cap could only be recharged in station. Neuts would be one of the most destructive modules. Active tanks and active weapons would be a death sentence. Passive shields and passive weapons (proj / missiles) would become even more common. 
---
Still the guy admits to using an exploit for a year. That’s not okay and the part I don’t like. 
---
That has to be really disappointing. 
---
I've seen this happen, but it corrected after a day or so (did not login to any characters on this account) 
---
You're what's wrong with this game 
---
Welp. I don't know what to tell you.
---
That whole "I don't even want to play anymore because what I just had to endure was AIDs" feeling you described is basically every single sov op or structure bash I've even been on.
---
So why is it unreasonable for you to have to put forth the same effort to attack the fruits of that labor?
---
Not with fittings. You need like 140 days of training just to get in the ship itself.
---
Lasers are the one true religion
---
I think it would be best if not every skill was able to be increased by the activity, especially if activity would be defined as broadly as in this comment. Trade skills definitely shouldn't be linked to it as it would be abused no matter how specific you try to make the activity. Example, if you only gained sp on completed buy and sell orders, which is the peak of successful market activity, you'll just have a bunch of people posting sell orders on an alt, buying it out with a second, then repeat in reverse.
---
The best deterent against it being bot farmed would probably be to make it not worth the effort. Make the sp gains low enough and nonrepeatable so that it's insignificant for purposes of extracting but helps genuine newbros get through the most basic, universal ship skills a little faster so they can start training towards what they find exciting
---
Now camp a novice at 0 with a buddy in a cloaked Navitas.

&gt; I know the classic "if you dont know the anwers to these you shouldnt be flying it" well im just trying to have fun in this game
---
I mean, I guess you can have fun being blown up...
---
To be fair you post that there was a method but did not provide it in the thread. If only 3 people know about it I doubt CCP cares. 
---
So we all need to keep an eye out for eatcat.ini - got it.

You are either running an old version or the application hasn't been updated since CCP moved ESI to a different address.

Understandable. I fell in love with poe from watching one of the races and started watching more and more people involved in the game on youtube/twitch. Used to watch quin 2/3 years ago when he was streaming wow if i remember correctly, or it might have been diablo 3.
---
Are you comparing your undock, take bridge, anchor up, press F1, and go home to...
---
Creating a blue scout that doesn’t get burned. Warping around for a while to find an appropriate target. Then building multiple dreads. Then gathering all your players together. Blue scouting. Then getting your neutral toons in place to get tackle. Likely quad boxing at this point. Getting tackle. Dread bombing. Then either being smart enough to safely extract or have to lose 5-10 bil on dreads for a RATTING super kill? 
---
Lmao. F1 monkey.
---
It might be related to CCP having issues with ESI. Everytime i get issues with Pathfinder i also get the notification on Zkillboard that there are issues with the ESI System.
---
turn off notifications and stop moaning
---
Hahaha wow thats so cool
---
Is he? What if he is just constantly ratting/exploring and has a good pi set-up?
---
Wow I comment on a feature and you have to be a toxic fuck.  I know I can turn it off, did I ever say I couldn’t? I was commenting on how annoying a feature was fuck off.
---
I moved to null as a renter in FCON. Afterwards, well you know what happened, it was interesting to see your take on the invasion of the area. After mulling over whether to join Horde or Karmafleet I ended up with Karmafleet and remain there to this day.
---
Haha, well done 
---
here's to another 20 so you can put guns on it
---
my comment was not toxic, and it was as aimed at informing everyone else who doesnt like the dinging of the activity tracker (like myself) but to post on reddit stating your complaints on somthing that they have already given you the ways to stop. frustrating.
---
turn off message notifications, and stop moaning?
---
Why are you always so angry... 
---
Ahhh. So to be precise here, your argument for dealing with a single player. A single not pvp oriented ship. Is to bring a fleet large enough to light up intel and make every super pilot in tactical supremacy to log on? Lmao. 
---
I fundamentally do not understand what is wrong with 6-8 guys who are in 600-800mil ships being able to fuck up a carrier that they caught. Especially, when that carrier was dumb enough to get caught. Nah...instead you need 20 guys flying expensive ships with webs, jams, ramps and then you have to pray he doesn’t light a cyno. If a single fax comes in your 20 man Loki fleet has a zero chance of breaking and go home. 
---
“Bring a few ships for each of those roles and you’ll dumpster a super.” - your right. Again, if he gets a single fax or even 2 or so more supers, gg. 
---
I’ll drink to that!
---
There really isn't much you can do to spark a fight lmbo

So edgy I obviously cut you.

Cry more about something on shitbook that isn't even your intellectual property, although you are claiming it is, haha.
---
A twitch streamer who uses the word sperg way too much. And the word cooked. XD
---
That's actually super cool - I'm glad you weren't turned off by being on the losing end of a war!
---
I suspect this is BS.
---
Based on what people have said, you can do this on 2 Chars at the same time, with the cost of Omega+MPT, which is cheaper than Omega+Omega.  
---
Now lets take a best-case situation, where you can train multiple skills this way.  Lets also assume this is a perfect case situation, and you can train the entire que this way.  The maximum alpha que length is (iirc) 47h + skill.  The best possible skill to use an x8 skill (BS or Scanning).  
---
This gets you 23h + 362,039 sp.  With +4's (2,700/h), you are getting 786,178 SP stead of 424,139.  Since we are double training, you are getting in total:  
---
786,178 + 1,944,000 times two, for the cost of Omega+MPT.  
---
5,460,356 SP instead of 4,736,278.  724,078 'free' sp.
---
The only case this gets higher is if you break the Alpha skill que limit, and from what I have seen you cannot.
---
Hey. This is the same post that I put on Facebook 2 hours ago! You criminal. It is in fact I that have wasted 20 years of my life only to just manage to fly a Merlin. 
---
You absolute screenshot stealing glory hunting chode!
---
If you can only train alpha trainable skills, this gives less than 15% extra SP when maximized.
---
&gt; I think it would be best if not every skill was able to be increased by the activity 
---
Question then becomes: what activities do we pick and choose to be expedited by this kind of feature? How do we justify giving combat pilots this kind of boost while holding those advantages back from traders, miners, manufacturers, etc...
---
&gt; The best deterent against it being bot farmed would probably be to make it not worth the effort. 
---
One flaw I can spot in this line of thinking tho is that botting takes practically no effort. Aside from a bit of an initial setup cost, a bot can just sit there 24/7, every day until CCP's annual random bot sweep, and rake in the ISK/SP. Even the smallest of rewards will add up over time when done like that, not requiring any human input.
---
To put it simply: any reward worth the effort for a player will be worth it for a bot. Unless you make it impossible to somehow convert that reward into ISK.
---
Isn't that a lot of raw HP? (not EHP!)
---
Don't forget we also started with a lot less beginning SP. For all the complaints about having to train, it was harder ten+ years ago.
---
You don't like the area your wh leads? Just roll it.
---
I thought the same in our discord discussion on this dude, but his pods are 3b, 10b etc. RMT usually wouldnt include frivolous pod expense.
---
Prometheus it is clear that you don’t small gang pvp. You have never taken the time to learn how to effectively manually pilot.
---
Here is a point I don’t get - why should 7-8 exceptional pvp’ers in a small gang not be able to solo a supercarrier that gets no support? I am not talking about one that is smart and lights a cyno or gets help. Let’s just say - 2 orthrus, 2 zealot, 2 ceptors, a Deimos, and maybe a osprey navy issue catch a super. More likely than note, every non-hac ship will just get alpha’ed or 2 shot by the super. Lol your L-range fighters can apply 2 battleships worth or DPS. 
---
I get it is expensive. 17 bil. But if you buy that expensive of an asset you shouldn’t be able to be able to yolo it around. In fact, maybe the exact opposite? If you are going to buy a super powerful weapon like a super you are a more veteran or experienced player. Require them to have SOME support.
---
I guess that analogy kinda makes sense if the trains are carrying quantum entangled cargo that  another train's passengers can change?
---
What would this accomplish besides annoying the shit out of everyone?
---
Do I have to engage the Ranger Regiment fleet with a huginn, 3 lokis, and a rapier cause not gonna like - my ass is runnin from that lmao. 
---
Where do you live? If you undock a small gang to fight a small gang I will look forward to fighting you every time I come over. 
---
Ah, so I can ignore the "Not Routed" in red letters then? Is that a bug?
---
Do you drop a revenant? 
---
Not anymore. Had a couple, lost one, sold one. Just rocking peasant supers atm
---
Dang you got me!
---
Felt more like 10 seconds lol 
---
NPE is different, they pulled the Drifter fleet stuff. Instead you get an Agency-style tree of tasks to carry out. 
---
This has to be a troll post
---
Wow, congrats, absolutely blown away by your progress. I'm so proud of you son. Amazing job, can't wait to see how you grow in the future.

Wait so again, your counter to fighting a 1-1.5 bil carrier is a lot of void bombs? Again, carriers do enough DPS they can 3-4 shot a non-hac cruiser. They also don’t turn to jelly after void bombs. Check the ones that die. Most don’t have a tank. All they need to do is light a cyno in under 60 seconds and if a single fax comes in they are saved. A 6-8 man gang can likely fight a carrier with a lot more ease. But I really think 6-8 guys who fly small gang a ton and invest a TON of time and effort into theorycrafting, flying their ships right, and learning the mechanics of the game should be able to kill a super that doesn’t light a cyno and gets no support. I also don’t think a super should get instant safety out of a cyno but that is a different story haha.

Any one else sick of this sub~~s constantly chaning agenda~~? 
---
Fixed
---
Yo, I'm looking for a contact over at SkillU to come on the show, Talking in Stations.. could you have someone ping me? RonUSMC#5465
---
You should file a bug report for this.
---
I'll pass this thread to the relevant people :)
---
Look at this guy’s losses, he does a lot of stuff with very cheap ships. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/90519767/
---
Granted, a lot of that is because he is smart about what he engage, but the ventures are super cheap so you have room to mess up a lot. 
---
Also, ventures have two free points of warp disruption resistance, so you can usually warp off if a fight starts going south 
---
Another huge faucet instead of a small to mediocre sink?
---
&gt;Are you comparing your undock, take bridge, anchor up, press F1, and go home to...
---
How is that different then an F1 monkey in a Dread bomb? You jump instead of bridge? Set siege instead of anchor?
---
You're trying to compare an FC to an F1 monkey. It doesn't matter what you're doing, the FC is going to be putting in a lot more effort.
---
I guess the difference is, if you do everything right, you kill 8 supers and 2 rorqs.  If our FCs do everything right, they save an I-hub.
---
So whatever. I could go on.  It takes pretty much 4 accounts to safely mine in a single rorq, and all four of those accounts are active during a save, so I'm not sure what your point there is. 
---
Lose 5-10 bil? Lol. Don't be poor. It's pretty easy as an individual to have 75 bil on field (even at Esotaria prices) during an active save, all of which is at risk.  That's what makes your 5-10 bil risk worthwhile, right?
---
Building dreads and getting players together?  I'm sorry you have to play the game to kill people who are playing the game.
---
Easy frags are out there, but to think you're entitled to just fly into prepared and secured space and just start fragging nerds isn't really realistic. 
---
We have carriers in lowsec too my man.
---
made me laugh hahahahaha
---
Lots of words. 0 information. Thanks for wasting my time. 
---
I posted the method and later edited it out 
---
Or a loki
---
&gt; I have informed CCP of this bug in November, but it's still not fixed.
---
Did you do it through the correct channels and file a bug report? 
---
What's the EBR number and we'll look into it.
---
I liked that concept. What you picked give you a little flavor but didn't really matter in the long run.
---
Welcome back comrade!
---
Generally if a frigate decided to engage BC or VNI, they know what they are getting into and ready for the engagement. You must fit your ship to specifically kill those frigates. For example, dual webs and guns/launchers that can track/ apply damage to frigate. A VNI with 5 heavies is easier to kill for a frigate than one with tons of Acolytes or Warriors.

/u/ccp_falcon i assume that you already noticed this - but just in case you didn't and this is truly the case and not just some troll ....
---
Easy tough guy
---
love the space police :)
---
10 years? Wtf you been doing running level 1s ??
---
Given the pve is shit, idk. I like playing the game personally. I don't enjoy ratting, so that much grind sounds like a second job 
---
Yeah right.
---
/s
---
I take it all back why would you do this. probably a shit scam attempt 
---
Nevermind. Go back to pressing F1 and mining. Your posts make it clear you don’t understand much of this games mechanics. That is not what anyone is posting about. People do not want an unsupported capital to be able to destroy with ease. If a cyno goes up and support comes in - hell yes that thing should not die. But a single ship - that gets no help or a single super dropping without ANY support should not decimate a gang is my point. 
---
It should not take 10 dreads to kill a ratting super that was not going to get help. It should take 6-8 pilots that understand more about this game then what the ping says or the FC tells them. 
---
Ugh not even worth it at this point. Btw I wasn’t in that beacon bomb but I still watch your video a ton. That fight (despite you guys dying) is like the epitome of great execution lol. 
---
It amuses me that he thinks you guys do QA

&gt; the default ingame maps (even the old one) are straight shite.

literally the only thing i even use the ingame map for anymore over dotlan is to see active cynos and fleet members

Yeah I agree with that, in fact I've said it before. An hour to just to make a timer is way too long.
---
You want to root Extractors to a LaunchPad or Storage, and then further distribute your t0 to all factories.
---
If you plan on setting up PI rather active, few days up to a week or so you don't need storage and can work with launchpad instead.
---
If you root to something that can hold the goods you can save up the production in case there is something influencing your extraction longterm.

lmao, jumped the gun on that name. Didn't you bud?
---
Yeah I understand that eve is "hard" and cruel but some players are just assholes when it comes to new players with questions.
---
Is that in 4k ?
---
I did that when I was carrier ratting and it wasn't so bad but as soon as I started super ratting you have to learn that keybind fast
---
&gt; despite the abuse people would do for alts.
---
back in the way back, characters used to start out with somewhere between 30-60k sp, depending on choices you made in character select with no way of knowing the impact on your start in the game - you also got to choose your initial attribute allocation, again with no idea what the impact would be, and back then with no such thing as remaps
---
over time the initial skill pool has grown by leaps and bounds every time ccp reviews the new player experience, and now people are starting with like 300-400k?
---
bruh
---
malcanis' law applies to individual players too - what's good for new/small groups is better for larger/well established groups. what's good for new players is better for vets starting new characters. that's the price you pay
---
it's a good idea. vets might use it to accelerate alt training. so be it
---
about 2B in isks, about 15B in assets.
---
we started with less beginning sp and lower attributes as well
---
Why do you assume people have some responsibility to be nice to you? Especially if you didn't earn it?
---
Eh? What do you mean? Don't they all go in seige as soon as you click the button?
---
Wew lad this was a colossal waste of time
---
Sorry for your wasted time
---
What are you Pee Wee Herman?  Is this your haha meant to do that moment
---
The problem are the bad default settings. A new player doesn't know they are bad, he doesn't know that they can be fixed and how, and he can't make an educated decision anyways if he gets a choice between alternatives. It's about giving a good default for people who start the client the first time.
---
What you want would be aimed at more advanced players, who already know a lot more about the game. But there is no big problem now. After some time in the game someone will recommend a better overview, someone will show you a link to some recommendations how to setup your windows etc. Sharing overview settings alone is very simple already - one can put them in chat or send them by mail, installation is done in 2 clicks.
---
To be fair, the we saved one rorqual in the end.
---
I'm pretty sure I forgot about the game when I first started, because there was absolutely nothing to do for the first 2 months.
---
Is this real life?
---
It was a joke... Siege module stops your ship... But the Moros is so slow, the -100% velocity penalty makes it faster... Get it... I'll show myself out...
---
Iunno, I just thought it was using multiple rail lines when before you only had one line to transfer any cargo with.
---
OK, real talk. You will most likely never see the Angel capitals in game after the disastrous release, reception, and balance attempts of the Sotiyo sites. The reason Blood and Gurista Sotiyos are spawning all over EVE is because they were horrendously broken at release, and the loot could be stolen by a frigate. CCP was upset that GSF refused to run the Blood Sotiyo because it was so broken that they let it spawn outside of Blood space. It's easy to cheese with supercaps but that basically means that you're not going to do it if it spawns in your space as a renter.  
---
CCP hasn't iterated on Sotiyos in quite some time, and they've pretty much abandoned the concept altogether. The easiest way to fix faction caps is to add them all to LP stores at sensible amounts, and make the Sotiyo drop 10/20 BPCs. 
---
&gt;Your posts make it clear you don’t understand much of this games mechanics. 
---
You say that, but you're the one comparing the effort an FC puts into setting up a Dread Bomb to a normal line member.
---
Those Brave supers we're unsupported. They died. It took a lot of work to kill them, but it took a lot of work to get (even) unsupported supers onto the field, and it takes even more to get fully supported supers on field.
---
&gt;they have to create ISK sink
---
they did, they're called skill injectors
---
The same bullshit... I want to kill a capital with my Small gang....
---
If you want to kill a capital. Fly fucking capitals! Or massive blob the capital!
---
Done. Look at the initiative fleets. 150 bombers. Can obliterated any capital ship. Or invest into shinny battleships.
---
It's always the same thing. OMG can't kill a rorqual with my nano shit gang
---
the person doing the recording is 45km from the pod, and he's cycling his guns once as a hack to get on the killmail
---
the guns have no chance of hitting, and it's the only thing he can do from that range to get on the mail before the pod explodes
---
`I have informed CCP of this bug in November [...]` makes me think he did. And here is [the other thread from one year ago (I think)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7h8aax/a_ghost_training_20_exposure/). Keep up the good work!
---
Race condition and not locking the variable while working on it
---
So you went straight for the tier 4 frig ah? Brave
---
HELP
---
Tja last one apparently. 
---
The worst is when the can aren't even empty/50,000k isk. I have cleaned up plenty of sites where there are 1-5mil isk cans left behind. People just don't know how to do math on isk/hr. If it takes me an extra 60 seconds to get 5 million isk, I should do it, because that's like 300mi/hr. Is that lower than if every can had 80mil in it, sure, but it's higher than my isk/hr of flying three systems and scanning 6 wormholes before finding another site. I guess people just think it's funny/mean or something, but really it's just dumb. I've been meaning to do some math to see if they're really just shooting themselves in the foot by hurting respawns, and I'm pretty certain they are.
---
Look at his whole km.. there are more gems. Seems to be a creditcard warrior, but no realy shitfits. His Dread loss was postet a few days ago..
---
Contact your friendly locator agent.
---
You all are gonna make me want a naglfar so I can boast about vertical supremacy too
---
The spawns are region based, if you move out of your region after leaving a can in each site you get fresh new spawns. The people left with the shitty cans make less profit, which actually makes you more profit because they will have less to sell, reducing the market supply and thus driving up the prices of your own loot
---
Probs just didn't want a capital. And if his flare is true he probably isn't mission running 
---
In my humble opinion,
---
Change new pilots to have 8m sp, assorted skills to 4, multiple ships and they have a tutorial mission system that takes a few hours, the preloaded skills let them dabble...
---
After a graduation to a capsuleer they get remapped given core ship CPU power grid skills to 4, 4 million SP a graduation set of ships from their faction academy.
---
Unallocated SP can then be spent how they choose allowing them to get into a T1 close to T2 role of their choice..
---
Caveat, that sp can never be extracted you can use a lore reason of the initial 8m sp skills were first training simulations and they graduated into a real pod not an academy loaner *shrug*
---
Aren't the advanced rookie ships called T-1 frigates and Cruisers?
---
I'd definitely get on the Make T-1 Great Again bandwagon.

If it's in range witch can be a challenge with its short range. (With haws ,/  blasters)

I'm simplifying, of course. Yes, locks can help. But do you lock and have people wanting it wait? skip and come back? Allow for preemptive locking or maybe latches? How do you deal with deadlocks? (I'm unsure if there'd be any changes which require this. maybe something that's doing reps or something. Or maybe duelling nos.)
---

&gt; It'd be far easier to just have the Magic 14 start at IV.

CODE. lol
---
Then you really don't know business and why things are the way they are. Your 1 sale doesn't really mean much, CCP is going for the most sales for a skin they can get and there is a reason backed up with historical data that says that this strategy is the best way to do it.  
---
And just wait until you die lol 
---
In red space it's best to not close the site and alert potential hostiles your there, especially if their is another site in the system.
---
YES!!!!!!!!!!
---
I am sure this is partially by design to encourage people who let their accounts lapse into Alpha to resub at some point in the future; and if it is not intentional, it certainly functions that way. Ergo, I do not think fixing it will be high on CCPs priority list. 
---
So either a rich madman or a wizard at RMT'ing killmails. Or... both, I guess?

After playing eve for a hundred years, I finally realized that the flash of light followed by me floating in space in what looks like an egg is not, in fact, me leveling up.

Hey Logan, I’m new!

EVE is not fortnite. A twitch shooter with building elements is nowhere even remotely close to a strategy mmo. And trying to twist the strategy mmo into something that would appeal to that audience would break it fundamentally.

I don't think your original idea is bad but this comparison definitely is.

oof, I flew my first cap after maybe 2 years?   Grats though I suppose.

I would light an out cyno, but it appears to be jammed. 
---
i disagree.  jump a carrier or titan or super carrier into enemy space.
---
have the reinforce fleet on standby ready to jump in.
---
and wait for the enemy to notice the cap/super cap/titan ratting their space.
---
course...if escalation comes your gonna be at a disadvantage cause of tethers being so useful if the enemy decides to disengage or go for repairs

i agree with your sentiment, but "it wasn't even that hard to find" is the argument that got boat permabanned from reddit so
---
They tried this some time ago did they not? I remember sometime around 2009 new players were given a significant boost, and each new character made had roughly 700k+ skill points. 
---
It appears this was toned down significantly when they decided to do ftp alpha clones. 
---
I guess I'm just a line member now, sometimes skirmish fc, in a large null sec alliance, I have 3-4 bil in cash, maybe double that in assets. been playing for almost 3 years, have 3 active(omega) accounts, but I do 0 isk making activities I just buy plex and pew pew 
---
You just lost the game.
---
big tip first. upgrade the rail guns.   i don't mean to faction or t2 unless u got the skills.   but upgrade it to something like(not sure what railguns called) the equivolent of arbalest, or scout.  aka t1 but higher meta level.
---
that way more range/dmg.

also i'd really advise having at least 5 to 10 light drones to deal with frigs that get to close or that sentries struggle to hit.

---
The original root of most operation systems is Unix. Here's some quick gaming-related OS family trees off the top of my head:
---
Unix-&gt;BSD-&gt;FreeBSD-&gt;Orbis OS (Playstation 4 os)
---
Unix-&gt;BSD-&gt;FreeBSD-&gt;Darwin-&gt;macOS
---
Unix-&gt;BSD-&gt;FreeBSD-&gt;Darwin-&gt;macOS-&gt;iOS
---
Unix~&gt;Linux (linux is a re-implementation of the unix interface. There's some history there that doesn't matter)
---
Unix~&gt;Linux-&gt;Android
---
Unix~&gt;Linux-&gt;SteamOS
---
and then over here screaming in the corner about how special it is we have:
---
Windows 9x-&gt;Windows NT
---
Windows is actually very much the odd one out implementation-wise, but it obviously has a lot of inertia in the desktop games industry. Saying that linux doesn't support most games is straight up wrong though. Some quick stats googling suggest there's ~2.3 billion android devices in the wild to 400 million windows computers, so linux definitely supports games fine.
---
The primary problem with releasing games for linux desktops is not compiling, which even the big engines like unreal have done out of the box [for around 5 years now](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/41-update-preview), but packaging for all the various slightly different distro variations out there. Tools like [appimages](https://appimage.org/) can help with this a lot. In addition to clever packaging solutions, most linux game devs only guarantee support on specific distros, usually ubuntu, to simplify their distribution mechanisms and support costs.
---
In any case, I've been gaming on ubuntu with no windows machines at all for like three years now and I'm happy as with my setup. You couldn't pay me to go back to windows.
---
&gt; Corp/Alliance fittings could have skill-requirements attached to them (This Ferox fit requires Power Grid V, Weapon Upgrades IV...)
---
This is a genius idea right there.
---
The ship itself refusing entry if the skill conditions of your corp or alliance are not met.
---
You should propose it to CCP!
---
I for one, am disappointed that this isn't Braxus rolling moros. 
---
Reinforced Bulkheads II and trimarks are wasted on a mission boat. You can capacitor and resist mods for tanking. Microwarpdrive is probably killing your cap regen, better put in an AB instead and accept the fact you will be slow.
---
Excellent write up, +1!
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll take a look tonight :)
---
I think the greenish color is the lighter fluid they use to get it started
---
Ah yeah you're right, still learning these types of damage/defense, I'll swap the modules as you said :)
---
then bring a fleet to geminate, pop in and out of O-V.  set up a gate camp in VSJ,   or try to attack the gate camp usually set up in BWF.
---
Horde usually forms response fleets(and large ones) fast,  unless theres a strat op......or unless ASP took us on a wh trip down to the south of EVE to trash talk local with a tethered wyvern.
---
what rigs you recommend? someone told me to put armor rigs for this ship
---
Wouldn't be surprised with elons stuff not working / working properly it seems to be Common
---
Are you ONLY ever using sentries? Kind of pointless to use a drone navi computer for drones that don't really move at all. Trimarks don't really belong on a ship using an active repairer; you'll get more mileage out of reps with resist or cap rigs or nano pumps, etc. The damage control is ok but you might be better off with an EANM (or fine-tuning your two slots for active hardeners from mission to mission for the exact damage types you'll be running into). A cap battery might be a better idea than a cap recharger. The sebo may help locking stuff to be less annoying but it probably doesn't really help you finish missions faster; seems like an application mod to help your sentries track/hit further or more cap stuff so your tank is stronger or an MJD to nope the hell out if you're being overwhelmed by rats would be a better idea. Use a quad life MWD for a lower cap penalty. The reinforced bulkhead is just like the armor pumps, wasted on an active tanking fit; you don't want to mix hull and armor tank anyways, and you don't want to mix buffer and active tanks in PVE (or too often in PVP, depending on your ship).
---
A battleship is generally too big and slow to run level 3s ideally, unless your skills can't handle them in something like a hac or a bc. Level 4s you probably would be in a world of hurt depending on which mission and if all the rats come at you at once; your tank wouldn't be enough all the time.
---
But take my advice with a grain of salt. I haven't done highsec missions in a long time. But when I did used to do them, some level 4s could kill a ship a lot tougher than yours.
---
Literally impossible to have a conversation with 60 different people about ASIC miners without input broadcasting.

He's just retarded
---
It will still be the usual slideshow. Chances are this will hurt things server side since we will (hopefully) disconnect less. Be prepared for more UALX-style node crashes. 
---
I'm not only using sentries, I forgot to paste here the rest of the drones, I bring sentries, hammerheads II, Hobs II, etc ... 
---
I'm new to the game and I'll try to understand all the terms and abbreviations you said haha, thanks for he help

Jin, I used to enjoy flying with you in Provi.  Now you're in the alliance but -10 for being extremely silly.  When will you officially not be considered extremely silly anymore and start running skirmish fleets for us?
---
Also good vid, thank you.
---
best of luck
---
oh, and i do have to call you a gallente scumbag cause caldari for life =D
---
Been away from the game for a spell, got a couple questions.  
---
Are there any new playable races/factions?  
---
Worth even playing without Omega?  
---
Jita still the hub?
---
I'd suggest dropping the railguns entirely and focusing on drone damage. 
---
Fit one or two Drone Link Augmentors instead. Drop the Omnidirectional Tracking Link II and fit a Micro Jump Drive. Drop the Reinforced Bulkheads II for a 2nd mission specific hardener or an Omnidirectional Tracking Enhancer. 
---
The idea being that upon landing you MJD out to very long range from the rats and snipe them with the ultra long range of the sentries (carry a set of wardens for this) you won't have any problems tracking even frigates at 100km out. 
---
In lv3s you will probably be fine but you do not want to face tank the damage output of lv4s like this. If your friend in the megathron wants to be in close and brawl with the rats you should make sure he has very strong resists because he will get melted otherwise.
---
If you want to stick with the style you are using right now definitely meta up the guns. Drop the bulkheads and fit a 2nd hardener and carry more kinds of drones. Sentries, heavies, mediums and lights. 
---
Doesnt this exist? 
---
Kill shit. Make Isk. Buy injector.
---
So Brave.
---
I'm not assuming anything. It was a simple question I asked... Answer it, or don't. But if you go through life being angry at anyone and everyone simply because 'they didn't earn my respect' then I am sorry for you.
---
I wasn't mean to you, I didn't hurt your feelings or call you an asshole, I merely asked a question.
---
Have a wonderful day. 
---
That really isn't the same.  More so when you consider how little ISK / hour a newbro can make even after they do some basic research on the game.
---
Who do you think I am?
---
Maybe just be smarter and put a huginn on the next site they're going to run and wait for them to land right on top of you?
---
What a great AAR

How did you like training a bunch of "Learning" skills just so you could train those faster? Or new characters starting with 25k SP.

&gt;Its more of an issue people not having proper guidance
---
&gt;Those skills are not an absolute necessity, at least for newer players.
---
The NPE being lacking and fitting skills not being 100% necessary doesn't make them a positive addition to the game.  You aren't focusing on the main part of this post which is how do fitting skills influence new player retention.  You can tell a new player they don't need perfect fitting skills until you are blue in the face but the reality is those skills are really important. If you want to play on anything close to an even playing field you need those skills.
---
&gt;join PL, NC, SkillU etc
---
When I joined TEST at the start of my EvE career I was directed to a 120 day skillplan and right near the top of the list of things to train in that first 120 days was fitting skills. [Goons have something similar ](https://wiki.goonfleet.com/Recommended_Skill_Training_Guide) (in particular check their core ship skills section). Check [EvEuni's **minimum** recommended skillplan](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Basic_skills) they have most of the fitting skills up to IV at least. Fitting skills are not just for "elite pvpers"
---
I'd be OK with Alphas but definitely no SP injecting. Upwell structures are OK but remove automatic beacons for structures to pollute the overview and limit them to anchoring on a single point to celestials (one per moon, planet, and I guess gate). Also change asset safety so that, rather than paying 15% of cost, you lose any given item on a 25% chance and that item follows existing loot drop rules. 
---
its like auto-asphyxiation but you dont touch yourself
---
Most alliances know the moment there's any significant capital movements around Eve.  It's very difficult to set something like this up.
---
1. Not yet! (No clue if they have plans to).     
---
2. I personally don't think so because I hate being restricted.     
---
3. Yea it's still the hub. Amarr is becoming relevant but not everything is a good price to be careful
---
It takes more to get fully supported supers on the field? Light cyno. 10 minutes to jump 2-5 fax and supers in. gg. 
---
Yeah good standings boosts from those too, and they are an integral part of [the Plan](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/faction-standing-repair-plan-aka-the-plan/8008). Note that data centers can only be used once, require expensive tags, and have minimum standings requirements. The arc has no standings requirements and can be repeated every three months.
---
When was the last time you fought a double or triple injected rorqual with leshaks? Please link it to me. Again, you act like you know how it works when you have never done it. 
---
this offends me
---
wormholer btw
---
Thanks for the fitting, just a question: Isn't a Large Sentry Damage Augmentor rig recommended, once I want to focus on long range sniping?
---
I alwats pick up carbon from data/relic sites just for this reason.
---
sure they'll know.  but most will usually jump for a fight,  even if its just responding with a ferox fleet that runs the moment caps come in.
---
all about providing bait, then slowly escalating it on both sides from subcaps on up
---
Hah, dopy me, bet I'm the only player with implants real and ingame 😎😎😎
---
I'm not limited to 3 toons :)
---
I did it on a surface 4, and after a while, it started to really fuck things up, but I think that was due to temperature because when I let my air conditioner blow directly onto the tablet it lasted much longer before fucking up.
---
Serious question anyone has a good solo fit for a rev relatively cheap?
---
Is this so CODE can claim that they are the Space Police?
---
Nothing beats Supertwinkey dub. 
---
Yep also this :D
---
Then perhaps the skill rewards could be integrated into NPE and made to only set certain skills to for example level 3, if they are not already trained to that level or higher. If they are, oh well, no skill reward for that mission. Also make those particular skills unable to be extracted to lower than level 3 or whatever the reward was so it cant be extracted out. If the reward skills are comprised only of fitting skills, navigation, spaceship command, and perhaps some others that aren't coming to mind right now, it would universally help all play styles that actually undock. The only ones who wouldn't have anything to gain would be the particular breed of trader that sits in a single station forever and never undocks, but they'll run out of trade skills to train soon enough and dont need to be rushed. I cant say I've heard of any new players who aspire to station-sit though, honestly.
---
You can train omega skills. Jist pop it in 30 mins before you go alpha, log into different slot on same account to make sure alpha. Then resub before it expires.
---
Lol. Actually, yours is the "same bullshit" we get from nullbears all the time. It's always the same thing. OMG can't kill a rorqual with my nano shit gang
---
&gt; I want to kill a capital with my Small gang.... 
---
Who says anything about small gangs? 150 man bomber fleets and dreadbombs don't work in umbrella regions. The people dying are either people outside the range of umbrella, or people who are too brain dead to get inhibbed.
---
&gt; Look at the initiative fleets. 150 bombers. Can obliterated any capital ship. 
---
Initiative fleets will work when people respond in muninn fleets. They won't work when people counterdrop 50 titans. We are trying to introduce fixes for the second scenario.
---
&gt;  If you want to kill a capital. Fly fucking capitals!
---
Dreadbombs don't work because there are enough FAXes in umbrellas. Crowded fleets already don't work. So you want people to drop titans to kill ratting carriers. That already makes you insane but let me take that seriously for a second. People will see titan fleet movements from miles away and move theirs accordingly. That makes a few regions with the most titans, like Goon and TEST space, "privileged". If you have 600 titans, and the enemy has 300, the enemy will never drop it in your space. That will make your space open for risk free krabbing. That is exactly the situation we are trying to fix.
---
&gt; Or invest into shinny battleships. 
---
You can equally boson bomber fleets and dreads and anything in between. Battleship fleets are the worst to operate under an umbrella. Your very suggestion says you don't know jackshit about what you are talking about.
---
Wormholers disgust me.

Yes I know who you are but I wanna know why this guy thinks I input broadcasted

What about the dumb drunk and high ignorant ones ? Got any of them
---
The new preferred testing system is M-0EE8, but watch out for Bodies.
---
No worries. It looks like you're getting similar advice from everyone in here, so you'll be able to piece it together and have twice the ship you started with :)
---
Good video, could you talk more about how there are continously less and less reasons to fight in EvE? I have a feeling that fighting now is almost only based on who hates who the most.
---
thats sad to hear :(
---
good job admitting that you are a retard 
---
You need to upgrade your route so it can handle more capacity. 
---
I [already have](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/) arguments on anomaly respawn mechanics. I think umbrellas are an independent problem regardless of how many people you can stack under a region though. It's just too lazy a way to defend space.
---
it really shouldnt matter much, drop an eanm for another dda if youw anted extra deeps though
---
They also make small injectors that are like 1/5 of an injector. So 1 week.
---
In the olden days, yes. In 2019? Not necessarily. Drone Damage Augmentor stack with the rig. The CCC rigs mean you will not have enough calibration for the T2 rig. The T1 rig would add 30 sentry dps (all 5 skills) and really hurt your capacitor/tank.
---
If you're overtanked, consider replacing the Damage Control with another drone damage augmentor. That will drop 40 ehp/s of tank in exchange for an extra 70 dps.
---
Proteus hunter with plate and istabs , i dont think i can bring myself to do that...
---
Atleast your not posparty btw
---
He'll get the credit.  He doesn't even have to be in the same star system as the mission to get credit.
---
Some people will use this to retrieve a lot of missions at once using alts, then have one character complete all the missions.  When the mission is completed, the person who got the mission will get a pop-up asking if they want to share the rewards.  This will share the ISK and rep gains.
---
So did you tell them about the WH before the veganism or before the P90?

And this is how a meme is born
---
Sorry I will commit suddoku
---
Judy please :D
---
Why fight?
---
To get more corpse !
---
The time to complain was when when the rorq was changed into a mining super.  At this point the game is broken and when it comes to fixes we've already crossed the Rubicon.  Complaining now won't fix Eve's problems.
---
Why on Earth would you sell it if it was so special to you that you never wanted to fly it?
---
While we’re on the topic can we get good minnmatar skins? Like wtf is the HFI color scheme.
---
Always believed he could steal pictures from facebook?
---
hah, that dude doesnt seem to be winning much of anything
---
Giving you mins works for normal pos, but what about faction pos? Can’t tell me the value is the same for mins....
---
Being a wormholer is like walking around times square with a buttplug in your dingus. 
---
Fucking amazing.
---
I'd roast your corp but looking them up on zkillboard they appear to be dead
---
That's about as long as Shekel lasted dude
---
What about this, it has a little less EHP but is a bit faster and way easier to fit? It also costs a little bit more cus of the T2 rig. Should still be cap stable. You could also swap one extender for an invuln if MWD cap stability is not needed. I dunno I feel like there is always something to be done but of course max skills gets you even better results- shouldn't that be how it is? If you just want to give everyone a level 5 character I don't think it would be as rewarding to fly something that you've been planning.

yes there is, the point is to make your ship look different.

tbh, I never use heavy when I run missions with a domi. Sentries or mediums/lights. I prefer two flights of Sentries (Garde + Warden) to fine-tune the range. If the Gardes can't track anymore even with 2 OTL with tracking speed script, it's time to pull in the drones and MJD 100km away.

Fair, but does that make this guy the thing that's wrong with the game?

Oh yeah, if you consider going gun less, put a couple remote armor repairers in the high so you can rep your sentries if they get agro'd. Sometimes you can even use the sentry with remote reps to tank a whole room.

With unlimited mins, in a couple years you won’t be able to tell the difference between sisi markets and tranquility markets....

Good, may she serves you well until her destruction o7

So all those Supers and Faxes, and fits, and fuel and the sov/I-hub upgrades to build them, and the structures they are built in and the characters to fly them and cyno/dictoralts...
---
Since apparently all that shit just materializes out of thin air...
---
Yeah, I guess spending some time to pre-stage a few dreads is a lot to ask to kill a super.  You should totally be able to get frags in sov space with some kitchen sink bullshit.
---
And you accuse me of not understanding game mechanics.
---
This is why Eve is dead
---
hot it ty!
---
Why train for 10 years when you can just lolinject in a few months and fly whatever you want

Ah, I always wondered what caused the excess SP in a skill. I've only had it happen with Omega skills though, so perhaps it's more complex.

Or just credit card it. Pay to win. Eve in a nutshell.
---
If you want to be even more annoying add high class wormholer btw 
---
Have you even flown "kitchen sink" bullshit more than 10 jumps? Have you ever successfully nano'ed a carrier or enemy fleet? Or is your version of "kitchen sink" just flying to brave space drunk on coms?
---
Have you ever attempted to fly a ship manually? With more than 5 enemy ships on grid?
---
I always carried them all because i didn't have anything else to put in the bay.
---
Maybe that's the problem? People feeling like they have nothing to do while they "catch up"?
---
Dont haul to player owned stations from the large trade hubs. 95% of this contracts are scams and you will be banned from accessing them preventing you from finishing the delivery and causing you to lose your ca lateral 
---
The Gnosis you are describing will work for a very limited engagement profile: short range frigates that don't warp off in the relatively long time it will take you to lock them. You will probably lose more Gnosis to things pointing you at 20k+ than you will kill frigates, by a wide margin. Typically a solo Gnosis is either easy prey or bait. You will get preyed upon, and quickly.  
---
If you just want to gank frigates then use a sensor boosted destroyer on a gate. You can jump through and warp away from things that will kill you as defense.  
---
Solo frigate PvP is the most difficult and least forgiving PvP in the game. You will lose ships because you didn't know the engagement profile. You will lose ships because you were one second late in activating a module. You will lose ships due to variations in range, speed, direction and transversal. You will lose ships because someone clever has fit their ship in a way that goes against the game meta and tricks you. You will have to fly the ship nearly perfectly with alpha skills your margin for error will be even smaller.  
---
**D-scan is the most valuable tool you have for PvP.** Get good at that. Learn the short cuts and hot keys for D-scan and practice until you are proficient. A huge reason why veteran players always seem to show up and win is because they already know what they are fighting before the fight begins. They know where their prey is, how it is most likely fit, and what it is capable of well before they have landed on grid. Winning and losing in EVE is most often determined before the fight has even begun. For solo and small gangs, D-scan provides the information upon which most or all of the decisions that determine that outcome are made.  
---
I would HIGHLY recommend joining a corporation that has PvP players willing to teach new players. Faction Warfare and RvB come to mind.
---
FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
Nice job, solo can be ball breaking at times, it's good to take a step back and celebrate just how awesome it can be.
---
Yes, but for free also. 
---

Welcome back, the three mentioned in the top comment are all solid mappers - see which suits you best and enjoy! 
---
That was oddly specific man...

Sounds awesome, will watch after work ) Maybe see you in black rise

Ohohoho!

---
hah
---
no booshing doctrines do not work enough. you can place longrange titans/dreads around a structure for example and those have easy pickings. Even jin'taan with provi! was able to fend off booshing doctrines from panfam with that tactics. The only way booshing doctrines work good enough, is when you feed distractions.
---
So any other ideas how caps and supers can be defeated?
---
As defeated does not mean that they lose the objective, but that an enemy fleet is able to cause substantual losses. This attacking force can be perfected for this job, and suck for any other job.
---
I already hear in the future how the north whines about supers and caps are too strong, when your so-called Taperium marches into war with enough titans to block out the suns of a whole constellation... I have no idea why you guys fend off the push for a cap rebalance while it's 100% obvious that you guys are clearly on the losing end if titans stay the same...
---
Wasn't referencing eve, but it definitely doesn't apply here.
---
You have to be setup to deal with the horde form-up it means knowing there doctrines very well then watch them form corms and warp off ( because you can't engage corms ). 
---
Like just popping into horde space without a plan how your gonna deal with being out formed like 10 to 1 is just feeding ships, nobody is gonna enjoy that. 
---
I like the 1008 implant in a dual rep setup
---
Feeding free caps to a alliance isn't a fight, a fight or the idea is that both sides have some form of victory condition, eating shit isn't a victory condition. 
---
It also means you have to be in a alliance that trust you to move the super fleet around for some fun. 
---
If you were right, neither scourge, nor "the holy league" nor any other organization like that would be so successful.
---
Yes, high-number groups are meant to lead in eve. because, as we always praise, in eve, everyone has a useful role. Well, you know what?! in large super/titan battles the only role such high number alliance had, was crashing the server. Now, an alliance like PH can actually do something, without always having to rely on parents NCPL...
---
"a small group of high sp players lack options..." BOOM SNUFFED yourself.
---
cmon, open your eyes, PL died because they are shit, nothing else
---
I'M NOT CRYING YOU ARE CRYING!
---
If they watched RnK then getting into null is the proper way to go
---
How the hell else are you supposed to kill rorqs and the inevitable cap response?
---
Its like a Sisyphus Moby Dick
---
This is a really nice picture for very nice ship !!
---
By saying "people", you mean those who get kicked out of the very alliance they build, or those who get kicked out of alliance's leadership due to shit talk? XD
---
BTW, I believe the thing you believe I have is paranoia, but not hypochondria. Also it's called "mentally sick" not "mental sick". You guys do suck at everything, right? 
---
Read some books before you want to show off, 手动滑稽你这个谐星。

Congrats! A dread is a total game changer. After I got mine a year ago, I never wanted for isk for any dumb thing I wanted to buy on whim. 100mil/hr bounties on the low end, plus loot, rare drops, and escalations, you'll have your hull paid back in a week or two and can start upgrading the mods or buying PvP ships for roams. I really kind of regret how long I lived in Provi putzing around in Ishtars and docking up multiple times a night. Living in deep null with a solid income is the life.

---
I am shocked by you, r/eve . A post about highsec mission running, and nobody has told the OP to join a nullsec alliance instead? Consider my faith in you restored (for the moment).
---
The tips given by everyone else here have been spot-on, OP. When running missions, you need to focus on enduring the NPC onslaught for several minutes. That means being able to repair damage as fast as they can dish it out. There are plenty of ways to reduce the incoming damage, like signature or range tanking. Or just DPS tanking, where you just kill them before they can do enough damage. Armor plates, bulkheads, and trimark rigs are generally more useful in PvP, where a fight is going to be short and brutal, measured in seconds rather than minutes.
---
A solo dominix, well-fitted and -flown, can run L4 missions solo. As a pair with your Megathron buddy, they shouldn't be a huge problem. I'll second the declarations from everyone else that your railguns should be the first thing you sacrifice if you ever run into powergrid or CPU problems. I still refuse to fly without a damage control, even on my PvE ships, just because they saved my ass so many times when I was a newbro. I feel naked without one.
---
As you get more experience, you'll learn that your tank and capacitor don't need to last forever. They just need to last longer than the NPCs. You'll be able to cut a capacitor control circuit or two, make your ship a bit leaner and meaner. And if you get comfortable with signature tanking, an Ishtar can put out just as much damage as a Dominix, while being faster both in and out of a fight.
---
Sorry that's a cop out, the original guy came at me like an asshole for literally zero reason, so I treat him like the asshole he is and your response is to ask *me* why *I'm* mad, and act like I'm the one who's wrong so let me help you out:
---
Fuck You.
---
&gt;Like just popping into horde space without a plan how your gonna deal with being out formed like 10 to 1 is just feeding ships, nobody is gonna enjoy that.
---
=D
---
&gt;You have to be setup to deal with the horde form-up it means knowing there doctrines very well then watch them form corms and warp off ( because you can't engage corms ).
---
aye or you could look for gate camps and engage them.  
---
and yeah you did bring up a good point. fighting horde means your gonna lose if you give them enough time to start rolling.  so its best to fly in, hit the standing fleet responders,  hit the gate camps(we had 6 hours of back and forth gate camp brawl with a goon jackdaw fleet. hella fun!),  and leave before the main response fleet rolls out.
---
unless your BL....in which case you munnin rock at range and do hit and run skirmishes.
---
its guarenteed content, but...like that meme said "Pick an enemy, no thats to many, put some enemies back" you only engage until the nubmers become a problem, then you run.
---
Thanks Falcon
---
&gt;Have you even flown "kitchen sink" bullshit more than 10 jumps?
---
Uh yeah, pretty much exclusively the first 4 or 5 years I played, and from time to time now.
---
&gt;Have you ever successfully nano'ed a carrier or enemy fleet?
---
I don't nano. I don't enjoy it.  Brawly was always more my thing.  I had a blast with the old Polycarb Vagabonds and Ishtars before they got nerfed really bad in like 09 or whatever it was.
---
&gt;Or is your version of "kitchen sink" just flying to brave space drunk on coms?
---
Shit is mad fun yo.
---
&gt;Have you ever attempted to fly a ship manually? With more than 5 enemy ships on grid?
---
From time to time.  Solo MJD phoons were my shit for awhile.  I just frag tackle and bounce.  I was chasing VNIs with a Legion not too long ago, but killing ratters gets boring fast.
---
So yeah, how about you don't judge me, and how I choose to play the game after spending years playing the game several different ways.
---
And stop acting like there is no counter to supers when Skill U literally just demonstrated exactly how to counter supers.  Yeah, it's work. So is maintaining and defending sov, and the super umbrella that protects it.
---
You just proved my point, thanks I guess. 
---
It's not hard to just ignore someone who 'was mean to me on the internet'. Yes the original dude was an asshole. Ignore the twat and move on. By getting angry and spewing froth everywhere just makes you look like an idiot. I asked a simple question. 
---
I'm not responding now, it's pretty clear you a) can't answer a simple question and b) can't have a civilised conversation with someone without resulting in you attempting to insult them. Lighten up my man. Lighten up. Enjoy the rest of your day. 
---
really makes you think

i paid by paypal back when i used to have to pay for plex (back in 2015/16 or so). Then i got big into trading and kept playing by paying with plex i bought in game, for several months. 
---
Then i decided to take a break from eve. I had forgotten (or not noticed) that i had signed up for this subscription, so a month later, they took 15 euro or however much from my paypal (and or bank via paypal), and at the time i really needed that few quid.
---
Anyway, i opened up a ticket, i think my first ever to CCP, told them the situation. They got back to me right away, told me they would cancel the subscription and refunded me the money back to my paypal account within a day or so. I found them quite helpful throughout the whole experience.
---
I did however have a little freakout at their wording " I have now closed your account ". I thought they just deleted my whole account and all my assets etc, but they got back to me again to clarify very quickly :)
---
Just a little story about my experience

https://m.imgur.com/H6Ynnww
---
1) Be an Alpha
---
2) Put a skill that an Alpha can't train to V in queue, let's say Gallente Battleship (of course the skill must not be trained to maximum Alpha level)
---
3) Log off and don't log in that character again until the time that is needed to finish training the skill to V with Omega training speed
---
4) Upgrade to Omega and then log in
---
5) You now have Gallente Battleship V, maybe you've even overtrained it past 2048000 SP

Honestly, the *vast* majority of l3s can be solo run comfortably in a battlecruiser, some a regular cruiser once you're confident and your sp is higher. Fit wise, I'd drop the mwd for an afterburner, swap the bulkhead for an armour plate, and the drone rig for either another armour or a warp speed rig.
---
Not sure if you've seen them yet but the blockade and the one with krull (name escapes me now) have pretty high dps at times. There's a couple of others that can get a bit heavy but those two are the ones to watch for. Keep flying with your friend, this game is best played with people. Have fun!

So again, judging from your answer, you don't nano. You don't "enjoy" it. You should consider taking your own advice and stop judging my gameplay. You view our gameplay style and actions as less worthy of yours. You have not nano'ed in the modern meta. You think our gameplay style requires no skill or low effort, when in reality, it requires more than your effort. You anchor and F1. That's it. 
---
And again, your idea of countering supers is needing 60-70 loki's that in acumination cost more than the number of supers dropped on them. You need webs, logi, ECM to kill a ratting super and his friends. That is dumb. Why should you need an entire fleet to kill a SINGLE pve carrier? Because it costs 17bil? That's a dumb response.
---
Effort in maintaining and defending SoV? What is the consequence if you don't? You have asset safety. I would definintely say that as far as defending and maintaining something - the wormholers seeking easy frags have it a tad harder. Our fuck-up's or mistakes have consequences. We lose it all. Again, you seem to think we are asking for easy frags. For an easy kill. We do not play this game for easy frags. That is why we don't anchor and F1. Do you know how easy it is to get a green good-looking KB if ALL you do is fly in big fleets? We are looking to be able to tackle super-carriers and hold the grid so we can fight the subcaps that should be required to support capitals. However, if nothing comes, sure we want a lop-sided gankg of a supercarrier which again would take an extensive period of time due to their EHP.

Tldr is that damagd is reduced beyond optimal range. You'll do half damage at optimal+falloff and like 10% at optimal+2*falloff
---
battles of 800+ will almost always have people smallganging at the fringes, probing for disconnected ships or hunting people who got split off their fleet
---
Yeah sure
---
I mean it's a player ran economy so it's on the players isn't it?
---
To be fair, that's like having a favourite strain of herpes.
---
Also to clarify; I would rather not join a huge Corp such as goons or test, I really enjoy the personal atmosphere of a smaller Corp and the feeling of actually being a part of it, instead of a cog in the machine. 
---
"the holy league" is successful mostly because nobody bigger can be asked to the remove them, let's ignore that they have NC/PL backing. 
---
&gt;Yes, high-number groups are meant to lead in eve. because, as we always praise, in eve, everyone has a useful role. 
---
Nobody is meant to lead, because there is no fundamental nature of eve, the idea that group X should be stronger then group Y comes from how it is not how it odd to be.
---
&gt; in large super/titan battles the only role such high number alliance had, was crashing the server. Now, an alliance like PH can actually do something, without always having to rely on parents NCPL...
---
Wait your want the judge the current meta based on the "freeness of newbro's"? 
---
Karma GSF pet, Brave Test pet, PH i guess NC doesn't order them around ( they do to some degree but w/e ). 
---
The idea that right now newbro's are off great because of the skill injectors rather then the fact that Test/GSF/NC run there protection is a joke. 
---
&gt; "a small group of high sp players lack options..." BOOM SNUFFED yourself.
---
The absolutely lack options right now, engaging outnumbered even before the escalation is a massive pain and means depending on snake/nano setups to refuse to commit.
---
Like back when 3 triage archon made a massive fucking difference, you could commit a small battleship force into a brawl and expect to get a majority out alive.
---
like sure it went wrong from time to time and you lose 1 or 2 of your archons shit happens, but the odds of getting them out alive where honestly not all that bad ( regardless of ticker ). 
---
Now unless you are in a massive blob committing triage is feeding the fax meaning you can't battleship brawl meaning you go for bullshit nano. 
---
&gt;cmon, open your eyes, PL died because they are shit, nothing else
---
I have no idea why PL died ( because i wasn't internal in PL ) i can suspect they had a problems that was the same as the old BL. 
---
This isn't about PL because PL doesn't really matter, there ironically they mostly rolled into NC. and are fine ( and those they didn't care for null rolled into there own wormhole groups ). 
---
The thing i'm missing isn't those nobody gave a shit about them anyway, the fights that i'm missing are the 2/3 triage archons with 10 battleships against like 40/50 dudes, those fights are near impossible to setup now because the 40/50 can switch 10 dudes to triage and well you just lost your triage. 
---
Your "kernel" friend is kicked. 
---
So you are imaging that I don't dare to debate? Let's do it?

It's the idea of endgame.   People are so used to now even in MMO's racing to the end game, they feel like Caps or above are the endgame, and that they are missing out if they aren't there.  That's not what what EvE is and some don't get that.

About 10 years ago, my first T2 ship was a Harpy, I won it from the crew at Eve Radio, I was so happy! Thanks Eve Radio!

yes it is.

It's down to how you get them they didn't like that they all mostly ended up in one blocks hands. An now well most just don't bother with the structure kills for meant reasons.

Brought to you by the corp that can't afford anything but cormorants...

Ah, thanks.    Due to the number of people who talk straight out of their asses I was wondering.

As for avoiding sites with blues, have a system ratting chat set up where everyone announces which site they are in.

---
&gt;You view our gameplay style and actions as less worthy of yours. You have not nano'ed in the modern meta. You think our gameplay style requires no skill or low effort, when in reality, it requires more than your effort.
---
When did I ever even imply that?
---
&gt;You anchor and F1. That's it. 
---
I already answered your questions about how that's not all I do. Mostly; yes, only; no.
---
&gt;Why should you need an entire fleet to kill a SINGLE pve carrier?
---
You don't need an entire fleet to kill a single super, you need an entire fleet to defeat the escalation you'll get trying to kill a single super in space belonging to anyone who isn't shit.
---
Because the alliance owning the PVE carrier is organized and has put in a lot of effort to make sure they are capable of responding to threats against a single PVE carrier. If you are more organized and prepared, you can kill it. If you're not, you can't. That seems pretty simple to me.
---
&gt;Effort in maintaining and defending SoV? What is the consequence if you don't?
---
We can't build supers for you to try to kill.  We can't build Faxes to save supers you're trying to kill. 
---
&gt;We are looking to be able to tackle super-carriers and hold the grid so we can fight the subcaps that should be required to support capitals. 
---
Find softer targets maybe. I don't know what to tell you. If we spend months, and tons of Isk preparing to defend against a specific type of threat, I don't think it's all all broke that we are successful in doing so.
---
And yeah, all you want is easy frags and GFs. Sorry, but that's the facts.  The tools exist to kill supers, but all I keep hearing is that it's too hard to stage some dreads.  That's how this whole stupid subthread started;  Dude memed about adapting and staging dreads, yet that is exactly what Skill U did, and they got an outstanding result out of it.
---
So adapt. Find shittier groups. Find softer targets. Put more effort into having an escalation path that might get you the fight you want.  Stop thinking everything that you personally can't counter needs nerfed.
---
Thanks for the reply... due to the number of people who talk out their asses on reddit/discord/forums it is hard to tell who actually knows what they are talking about and who is just good at sounding like they do.

---
10 years??!
---
I mean injectors haven't been around that whole time but ya
---
Join others to PVP together, it exponentionally increases you chances and knowledge. 
---
Yes you made a mistake by resubbing
---
I would recommend joining the Goons. They an have endless supply of isk thanks to their bots running 24/7.
---
Drones also have a tracking stat. Sentry drones have terribad native tracking but you can compensate that with the appropriate tracking mod and only shooting frigates/destroyers when they’re farther away. 
---
I'm stationed near them that's who I tend to shoot on most occasions. That's what I'm trying to avoid is the hey guys hit f1 game 
---
Ok then, you could probably run it, but I have no idea how it can be done and tbh I've never seen a guide for it. I'd suggest checking E-Uni for the basics, then check youtube for P2, P3 and P4 production. I suggest Pandemic Horde's vids. They had a guy do guides for them, he was supposed to be PI king, running about 10 accounts for PI. But even he was running the P3 chain.
---
When I first played Eve - I was told to look at a picture of the 4 major races frigates.
---
When my eyes landed on the Merlin - I knew that would be my ship of choice.
---
I had a plan, I was going to fly a LAZER Merlin!
---
But than someone explained to me why putting lazers on Caldari ships are bad.... and I was very sad.
---
Confirming I have lost the game.
---
For two players running battleships in high sec, what's a good next-step in PVE from level 4 missions?
---
Why not?
---
Sorry I wasn't specific. Local works as normal for everyone. ”Hunter” specific hulls have a delay to ”broadcast” to local giving them time to catch bots. Not all hulls have a different delays based on sig radius. We both know ccp would fuck that up. 
---
Right now the only people getting ”punished” are people actually ratting that may have a delayed reaction to local changing.  So 5 ”hunter” hulls shotgunning a system have as much chance to kill a bot as a human as the first xx secs the hunter doesn't show up and bots can't autowarp.
---
Wrong.
---
It depends how good the roll is.
---
A .1% increase will be less than a perfect roll.
---
Very cool!
---
AOE DOOMSDAY WEAPONS!!!!!
---
The thing is for most groups that don't depend on blobbing numbers are literally always an issue, like unless your part of the big empire blobs your often fighting with 10/20 dudes. 
---
Now sure part of that is play style, but eve does slowly become more and more of a game of what is still left to engage, and the answer is honestly slowly becoming less and less. 
---
Awww why
---
Officer mods are worth more than Abyssal mods because they are purple. Regardless of stats. 
---
I regularly check for ships in random spots while fighting battles, you won't believe what you'll catch. I found 5 procs mining a moon anom with 1k in local in null, battleships blowing up left and right. FC just pulled us out, we alpha'ed the procs and back to the meatgrinder.
---
You’re correct. Why should I pay 15 billion for your abyssal mod when I can also spend 2 billion on trying to roll my own?
---
That's the general theory but it's pretty much impossible to verify. But I've never seen a site respawn in the same system in J space, and sites of all races appear everywhere in wormhole space, so I don't think it's actually the same. I suspect that a respawning site in J space will go anywhere in the same class of hole, which gives a vanishingly small chance of being in the same system again, unlike nullsec.
---
How about no you crazy dutch bastard. New players are no the issue. The skills are not the issue. The alliances and corporations that the new players join that have their fittings not catered for brand new pilots is the issue.

My old account used to be up in the few hundred bills, my current one that I’ve been on and off with over the past years is fucking broke, like 50mil~ currently 
---
My kestrel disagrees. If only novice plexes existed.
---
I wanted to fly it, I really did. But as I’ve only played EvE on and off since 2007, currently main toon at 51mil sp, I’ve never had huge amounts of isk. And flying this huge craft with no real skill to use any modules, it was just too overwhelming. As we all know, flying expensive stuff in EvE can be very intimidating because of the real sense of loss that looms over each craft we shape. To be fair, I was in goon rent space at the time just before world war bee. I don’t do politics, I just go where my friends are at the time. And I knew it was a crazy time to try and learn to fly capital. So I sold it. I’m guessing it got blown up, as goons lost that area of space quite quickly after I left the area with my tail between my legs XD

The drifter hive missions are gone. There's a new NPE chain, and unfortunately, it's just awful. It's six or so missions given through the Agency, all of them intended to be done in a noob ship and 100% focused on "get close and shoot", "here's some basic information about tracking", "here's how to dock"... and that's about it. The rewards are wretched and the understanding you get about EVE is pretty much nil. Then you get dumped into the standard starting career agents. There are also some side missions you can also do for 50k ISK each, but they're just repeats of the main missions. If all of this wasn't bad enough, some of the rewards are super confusing. In a couple of cases, it appears that your reward will be a level of skill training in X skill, but you are not given the skill book beforehand and there's little to no training given on how skill training even works.
---
In short, NPE is in the worst state it's been in in the entire time I've been playing EVE.
---
Shame on you.

我不是被联盟踢出去的，整个妇联的丢失是我的责任，邂逅为了自保狗急跳墙，加上我太仁慈被黑三小草钻了空子丢了联盟。不过邂逅这个假妇联也就活了1年完蛋，验证了什么叫生于不义，死于耻辱。我们妇联选择来到欧服一样发展迅速，无论华人社区还是老外都认可我们实力。

---
Ehh whatever. Dude, it is clear that you haven't been on a grid with a supercarrier without logistics, ECM, and webs. It is clear that you are not the person who puts the effort or isk into your own SoV. 
---
Finally, stage "some" dreads? No. Lmao. You mean stage 250 guys to frag one rorqual and the escalation? 277 guys to be exact. Again, it took 277 guys to frag like 5 supercarriers. That does not curb this ongoing issue of overpowered and oppressive supercapitals making most of this game unusable for content.
---
I also note that you didn't address my final question. From a balance perspective, again due to the escalating growth of rorqual and capital presence in eve it should fall in favor of 8-10 ships being able to EXIST on grid with a supercarrier without getting annihilated. Right now, that is NOT the case. An unsupported supercarrier should not be able to alpha through a subcapital without the dromi or sirens even applying dude. 
---
I am done arguing. You believe that because you own a supercarrier it should be powerful. You used a VNI and farmed for several months and should be invincible. But wait, you put in ALLL that effort?! You afk'ed your VNI or rorquals and earned a lot of isk. You cry when someone wants a nerf because you think it takes a lot of effort. Lol, I have owned multiple supers. Earning the amount of isk to get a super is beyond incredibly easy. There is not a lot of effort involved in getting a super. I am also guessing you are in either Goonswarm or Test.

Remember when you lot gave a few dozen legit multiboxers the witch treatment over ghost training to appease the mob, even neg walleting them because they passed an arbitrary threshold of SP per e-mail address, then left 99.9% of the surplus SP in game including on virtually everyone that intentionally abused it (One wouldn't register their ghost training alts on the same e-mail address, now would they) and half a dozen ghost training bugs that the actual exploiters continued to use?  That's still up there as one of the most pathetic, lazy, and transparent acts of appeasement I've ever seen a game company pull.

Excuse me I'm  a peaceful explorer I only run relic sites and I don't consent to pvp.

For me, at least, exploring is more about going on an adventure in hostile space with the potential for some big profits if I make it home safely. If I want reliable money, I can just go ratting or moon mining.

That's more an end-game-ish goal. I would say next step is C3 sites. And definitely not Nestors :)

The rush, the shakes, adrenaline bursting, heart racing, blood pumping, sweat breaking on the forehead, teeth clenching, eyesight tunneling, breath pausing for the few critical seconds of the fight... few things provoke such reactions nowadays.

Beautiful vid, nice going OP

Totally fine. Some people do isk/hr. I was asking the commenter above why you can't do isk/hr when exploring.

nice circle jerk u guys have in here. ye the usual small ish super hunting group has no fc. mostly its not even the same corp/ally. mostly its friends that trust each other, ppl with similiar playstyle. i wouldnt invite ppl that only f1 push. 2-4 boxing is standard. its multiple times more effort to setup than building a super or solo rat/mine in sov space. as a linemember us basicly didnt do anything in regards of establishing the infrastructure anyway. we safely extracted all dreads but sadly had to burn the blue eyes. anyway dont bother with this dino brain he clearly is doenst know much. also stop circle jerking on reddit.

---
I play the game the way I enjoy and have time for
---
&gt; Again, it took 277 guys to frag like 5 supercarriers.
---
No, it took 277 dudes to fight a huge ass alliance. As it should. You shouldn't be able to just roll up to someone's front door and fuck shit up unless you are prepared.
---
&gt;8-10 ships being able to EXIST on grid with a supercarrier without getting annihilated.
---
 They should not be able to just chill on grid with a super carrier, but they should be able to bounce for the most part.
---
Actually, I'm pretty sure 100mn Lokis can just chill on grid.
---
&gt;You believe that because you own a supercarrier it should be powerful.
---
No, I believe that because I'm part of an organized alliance that is prepared to deal with the threats we encounter we should be powerful.  What are you going to cry about when they nerf supers and we just shit all over you with something different?
---
Eight  to 10 dudes in a wormhole can have fun and find frags, and maybe even punch above your weight.  However, if a group is prepared for you, you're gonna get shit on, as it should be.
---
&gt;Earning the amount of isk to get a super is beyond incredibly easy. There is not a lot of effort involved in getting a super. 
---
Then the same is true of getting the Isk together to pre-stage a Dread bomb.  What's the issue here?
---
Does it come with functionality to light cyno, use PANIC, use pre-recorded comms of you reading out the list of every possible thing on grid, send discord pings and update on your status every minute or so. If it does, that's a pretty good bot, I hope it also says "fuck this alliance wtf  why didn't you help" into alliance chat when you die 16 LY away from the alliance staging too. 
---
This was good advice. Also somthing that a lot of solo guys have is 2 different fits. Navy comet with blasters or with rails allows the pilot a possible surprised attack with the next fight. People look at killboard. Use this to your advantage to create traps.
---
And what ever you do record your fights using OBS. Watch your fights and learn from them. See where you made mistakes but also where you stayed and should have gotten out. Alot of people go in and just fight untill someone dies. Most great solo pilots will know when its time to warp out.
---
Blitzing burner missions if you guys have spare alts would be a big step up in isk. 
---
So we are totally out of English now?
---
I do believe Eve has political career in it, such as CSM or leading an alliance. Yes, someone shit talked me, and my reaction was "should I bite back when a dog is biting me?" My answer is no, and yours is obvious a yes, good on you. In the end, I don't respond by mouth like you do, I responded by action which is forced him into a good retirement.
---
You said many foreigners admit your skills in eve, that I agree. I believe you are good at fighting part, not playing part since you don't think there is politics in EVE.
---
Yes, two or three years ago, Crimson is the best FC and I admit it in many place. I have never said in any place that I lost that fight because of connection lost. We could take a bet on it. And you are making up this "connection lost" story to make yourself right as always.:))) I even put that fight into my PIBC annual video to warn myself. https://www.bilibili.com/video/av19593490
---
But you? You were just driving one ship, not even FCing. You are now proud that you beat me once? So in your logic, everyone in your fleet could say they are better than me, right?
---
But remember, it was 2-3 years ago, eve changed and I improved myself, it seems that you are still enjoying the old days.
---
In TQ, I just need to make a good story, and I did. Silvitni is still inviting me to go back and lead PLA even today. So Silvitni force me to step down is just another story you made up to make yourself right. We could take a bet on that too if you like.
---
In the end, Northern PIBC has no one who dares to shit talk me, Avenger Alliance is totally dead. And you could keep going to have your hallucination to make yourself comfortable. 
---
You made my day, thank you XDXDXD

Because you avoid bricking your modules 10x before you roll a good one?  There is value in skipping that...
---
&gt; then slowly escalating it on both sides from subcaps on up
---
You must be new. Everyone knows you start with the super fleet and work backwards from there if things go south.
---
That's pretty much what I do on a combat ship. Then reps/resist mods on F5/6/7.
---
Haha, omg, they deleted my post with this same question. At least they didn't hide yours as well.

100% agree with your approach though. At this point, if you can't beat them, might as well join them, until CCP decides to do something about it.

For me its about teh gudfite! Its about winning the fite by the slightest of margins. 
---
My Dominant has a 4th DDA II (suggest swapping out the bulkheads).  Still bumps the DPS.
---
Also, high slots are mostly drone link augmenters to increase the drone control range.
---
Finally, I use Wardens for long range and Gardes for closer in plus, as mentioned, a few lights for frigates.  If you can afford faction sentries they are a good stopgap until T2 sentries.
---
This would eliminate the fitting requirements of every item in the game....   
---
And if you think that grouping with people to do things is inaccessible without being in a face-rolling solo ship, you aren't doing something right.  
---
This idea would destroy the EVE economy even worse than it already is.

If a target is *within* the optimal (in this case, at 50 km or less) you will do more or less full damage. Beyond the optimal range, the damage starts to drop off and you get more misses and glancing hits. At optimal + falloff (85km in this case) you do approximately half damage, and once you get to optimal + 2*falloff (120km in this case) you do essentially no damage.

This is all assuming you aren't having tracking issues, of course. Your chance to hit is modified not only by range, but also by comparing the target's angular velocity (sideways motion) to the turret's tracking stat - this is essentially asking 'how good are your turrets at hitting moving targets?' in addition to 'is the target in the turret's range?' The whole chance-to-hit formula was linked in another comment, but here it is again [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tracking#Tracking](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tracking#Tracking)

And as we all know, purple is the color of royalty. That's why these mods are just the king of all other mods regardless of stats.

Trying to cater to newbros over the last 4 years has brought us to a point where our PCU is incredibly low, and alt usage is at a peak.
---
The solution to that isn't doubling down on easily-exploited "for the newbros" concepts...
---
Okay, Now this is the Epic CVA content I was looking for.
---
By the way I use Arch.
---
Was never banned. Said publicly he wasn't banned but was going to be away for a while. Has been back for days. But hey, with your level of situational awareness I can see why his status would matter to you.
---
I miss wormholing
---
Why do we need alts for that?
---
If you can't see who's getting screwed, you're probably getting screwed.
---
Read up on basic fitting. Simulate fits, and don't fall in the trap of trying to make a ship that would be good for anything, you'll just suck at everything.
---
Train skills at least to 4. Skill of 1 is not the same as being effective.
---
Don't rush to bigger ships too fast.
---
Learn the basics of agression mechanisms before you turn off/lower the safety or before you go to lowsec space.
---
Do the basics career agents missions, they're quick, you get a fair bit of freebies, you'll get basic intro to various systems (though realllly abstract.)
---
\*\*Join a good corp, if the corp does not seem good after joining it, leave and join another.\*\*
---
Man that salt you alone passed my daily content. And uh no a super is still 20 full for and easily more depending on fits or refits. The tackle fighters make sense and you can kill them. Decries are great for that. Cruisers to. Also in an empire building game times change. As with real life. 
---
Yeah his army is around in Delve and carebears are teasing him. It's fine.
---
Why would they ban him, when they haven't banned any of the botting rorqs?
---
Something something evidence
---
your story ends.  I establish a good alliance. My team made 100+ videos and render the truth to earn good fame. while your video is just your self-joy but camouflaged with RNK's reputation.  Everyone knows you are the barking dog in severity. You have bad fame there,  you are just a dude sheltered by the empire PIBC. Leave it, you are nothing but a normal FC.
---
Also, talk about CSM as a reference in the debate is extremely ridiculous.  serenity is serenity, tranquility is tranquility. you reference CSM as your claim of politics in serenity?? Like you claim you are in the management layer of PIBC?! I guess your politics is making ISK for your leader and pleasing him as the chairman. Serenity is ruined by your kind of conniving bot abuse, so shameless and make me disgusting.
---
You like to live in your world and make daydream, go ahead.  Don't wake.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.
---
TEST has a sig deployed to Stain, you can be in a large alliance but still get that close knit small gang stuff from SIG's
---
&gt; dates
---
eve player btw
---
I know I am after reading this post.
---
something something, no evidence. Something something, lots of evidence against botters and still not banned. See? Works both ways.
---
Whut
---
I'm not a support for wh but you can often roam for hours in non wh and still have that happen. You sound like someone who would say hacks or they cheated in an fps when you get killed out of sheer stupidity or lack of comparing skill.
---
So much this. And tbf the rorq should be a beast. It's an industrial capital that previously served no purpose. What's stupid about them is the panic.
---
My logic here is, if that tech exists why would (in game) no developers or scientists want that on their supers or titans - perfect invulnerability.... its dumb and should not have been put in play. Remove that and the rorqs are just as dunkable as the next ship.

My story ends?Is this your next story to be made up?

Again, by saying everyone, you mean 1)those who got kicked by their own alliance 2)those who got kicked due to shit talk? 
---
Btw, our server is called "Serenity", please don't be too angry, it makes you just as stupid as the time you lost your alliance. 
---
When I joined PIBC, there is only a Delve left for it. You are asking me to build an alliance again?
---
FYI, the CSM of Serenity is established, and you are claiming there is politics in TQ but not in Serenity?

Now, you are claiming that the commander in chief of PIBC is not even in PIBC leadership?

You are keeping say shit about me and claiming you have prove, where is prove? Everyone could do the shit talk part.

ALL BOTS lead to PHORDE.
---
Oh they've spent plenty of time trying to expand the playerbase, they're just retarded and remake the NPE 30 times instead of fixing any of the ACTUAL issues that everyone brings up.
---
On top of it, they're chasing away the vets by sinking all of their profits into said failed projects while leaving things broken/untouched for literal years.  It's just finally hemmorhaged enough people that it's  catching up to them hard and fast.
---
Yeah, see I struggle to see why this is a big problem. People who are in Alpha, and do not log in for a prolonged period of time, can come back and re-sub and their queue was treated like an Omega queue. 
---
I mean, I would be more concerned if the exploit allowed active Alphas to train at Omega rates; however, personally I just find it hard to care that someone who is not currently playing eve might get skill points at the Omega rate--in a single skill--when and if they pay for a subscription in the future. 
---
My sense of injustice does not go off because "hey I'm paying and she isn't, so she shouldn't get to train the same as me *if she pays again in the future* for ***a single skill***." 
---
If you want to get back into lowsec pew, I'd be more than happy to get you involved with us! Always looking for new pilots. Hit me up in game if you wanna know more. 
---
That's the problem, though.  CCP is neglecting "our breed" to try to chase the console kiddies and whales, but the core of the game would have to change into something unrecognizable in order to keep them.   Ever since CCP seemed to start chasing that market they've been eating shit hard, yet don't seem to get it.  It will always be a niche game at it's core, they should probably focus on keeping (well, regaining now...) the loyal playerbase instead of neglecting them for years to chase the new shiny.  It may be too late at this point.
---
1. Popping and looting is pretty much what you want to do. Even you get pretty much as much databases out as you put in. The Datastreams may be usefull in the future, but no raredrops to be found.
---
2. They only drop materials and databases. I kill them inbetween, better flying around and getting extra loot then waiting around at the gate while killing the npc's.
---
3. The rewards are noticeably better, but the site are reasonably harder, with 10mins spare you should be fine. 
---
4. Pls tell me if you know
---
No, all pvp is fair game, my personal experience is wormholes are not worth the trouble looking for content
---
Pathetic part is that CCP actually has gone BACKWARDS on this.  2 or 3 NPE "remakes" ago, new players got CPU management 5 for completing the tutorial chain.  In the last fail remake, they removed this and players get Marketing 1 instead.
---
Hell, even before that, players got a bit of  unallocated SP so they could train some of the basic stuff quickly, but they removed that too.
---
1. No, just shoot the cache.
---
2. The idea is that you'd spend spare time, where you'd otherwise be orbiting the exit and not doing anything, by burning and collecting that extra loot. If you only orbit the gate for a short period, just speedrun the sites over burning to the extra loot.
---
3. The difficulty jump is decently big. Just try them out on SISI first.
---
4. The t1 mods can be made and invented into t2. The meta mods are trash.
---
Pmuch. Not only that but fits can be weird. One whole its op, next its paper thin.
---
I used to use catalysts to take down dreads in a c5 wolf rayet. They would bring in to siege and I'd undock a small 10 ish aman fleet and wreck them due to the insane dps you could pull. That 10m ship was pumping I think around 1k dps non bling.
---
Its only an exploit if CCP agrees that:  
---
1. It is an unintended use of game mechanics; AND if it is 
---
2. One that is a problem, or provides a player utilizing it an unfair advantage. 
---
I would question both premises in this case, and *certainly* the second one. From CCP's perspective this actually ***encourages*** people to return later and become paying customers again. Since we live in a world dominated by capitalist economics, and CCP is a capitalist entity who exists to generate revenue and profit, it is hard to see why they would want to discourage people to come back and spend more money on their product. 
---
Furthermore, CCP's lack of action, despite being informed of this as long as year ago, to correct the 'issue' telegraphs that the company and the game's developers are not concerned that this is giving anyone an unfair advantage. 
---
Or players could follow the normal progression?
---
Longbow cormorant/coercer/talwar/algos should be every noob's first npc combat ship, later they can train into interceptor, bomber, assault frig, or t3d
---
Not quite sure how you'd really combat the spam though. Goons have proven you can't balance anything around cost, so having a tax rate multiplied by the number of structures your corp. owns wouldn't really be an effective solution.
---
CCP Abyss only did the injector thing cuz it was $$ directly in their pocket, balance be damned.  It was a terrible idea but that's who CCP is now.
---
If I’m not initially interested in PVP, what are my PVE playing options, just to learn and get a feel for everything?
---
BTW, I hope you do know the meaning of "render the truth" XDXDXD.
---
You are so incompetent in English.
---
So something should happen without anyone doing anything about it?
---
Great vid dooood. 
---
Honestly, joining a newbro corp in a null bloc is WAY better for retention than following the terrible NPE and ending up high sec mining in an NPC corp or running high sec missions until you die.
---
The NPE needs to focus almost exclusively on funneling players into finding a corp that fits them, instead of giving them a Venture and saying "GO MINE VELDSPAR UNTIL YOU GET AIDS!"
---
can confirm
---
You had your chance like everyone else. 
---
You have earned it, enjoy 
---
I used to do L4s with the domi using only sentries. 
---
Get in a room, use a micro jump drive to go 100 km away from rats, drop sentries, clear the room, move to the next room. 
---
If dps from rats gets too high, just MJD away.  I think it is a very safe way to do L4s
---
well "end-game" isint really a thing. eve is a sand box and you get to make your own end game. and i didnt specify what class he should go i but yea c3s or 4s. and yes there a quite a few ships you could take out  i still think a pair of nestors at just over a bill for the pair is a really good option.
---
Didn't CCP say they had a plan for what to do with POS after they fully cut over to citadels? I've held out reprocessing because I vaguely remember them saying that.
---
I thought that was basically the joke...
---
He gets it
---
How are skill injectors an isk sink ?
---
Anal masturbation with a curved object? Nice.
---
gdi 
---
Sandbox game
---
Got it now, I thought if they were too close, like &lt;10km, the chance to miss would also increase, because my sentries started to miss all the time when they were too close, when it happened I swapped for hammerheads and problem solved
---
thanks!
---
As I said earlier, I don't think that caps are balanced however fatigue generally limits there movement. Make sub caps that are able to just ignore the damage output of supers/caps will remove them as a force escalation tool and the game will become a simple game of numbers.
---
And subcaps can easily traverse the map in wh and JB.
---
And dread bombs done well can counter capitols. 
---
Why the fuck would they remove a decent tutorial they had?
---
Dude I'm literally gay. Every day I read your post history, stroking my cock slowly as I read in your voice. It helps soothe all the pain I'm in, as I blow my load tribute-style across a printed out page of your killboard. Fucking faggot.
---
That's a capital balance problem not a new player problem. 
---
removing the support skills will remove like what a month of that year. 
---
unless you include skills like JDC 5. 
---
Ironically the best solution is a complete skill injector rollback, but CCP will never do that. 
---
Skill injectors aren't an ISK sink. They remove zero isk from the game. 
---
LP stores, bans of players with large wallets (and dev neg wallet transactions), and isk costs for industry are all examples of isk sinks. 
---
they're missing because at around 10km the transversal velocity is too high and your tracking can't keep up
---
You can Lance them iirc
---
Otherworld Enterprises came to mind first
---
Except he didn't get banned. And I'd assume ccp would start banning the endless string of nullsec rmt botting bullshit first before taking a look at people who are actually trying to stop that. 
---

[You probably are new and not properly doing evasion tactics correctly, if at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecYUk66Pu2c).
---
This would be much cooler, OP, if the Moros could still field drones and got their old drone bonus. Then you'd have a dread whose drones could out DPS a Thanatos's fighters.
---
It amuses me that your alliance thinks they "PVP". 
---
Lots of funny stuff happens in EVE, you'll get used to it.
---
Blitzing burners involves declining a lot of level 4 missions. The more alts you have to abuse the free decline every 4 hours (no standings hit for declining) the more isk you can make. 
---
yawh, that hurts, comrade (
---
You are moving the goalposts from wanting to kill a single super to wanting your small gang to kill multiple carriers and supers?
---
You are basically complaining that people defend their space lmao.
---
So the orbit at a distance of X km is 2\*pi\*X km in length, basic geometry. The angular velocity is based on speed and the length of the orbit, the closer the rat, the faster they look like they are orbiting you. And yep, sentries are more or less useless withing 15km or so if they're Garde and 30 or so for Warden.
---
actually true
---
(ANY TRUERS hehe xd)
---
I'm surprised about the r/Eve community, I get downvoted to hell for advocating using bots because CCP doesen't give two shits, you tell everyone how to use an exploit and people are fine with that and you get upvoted...

Do enemies in burner missions pod-kill?
---
Maybe look at v0lta. Not sure if we're recruiting now or if you'd meet requirements, you might need to know someone, but pop into the public and see.
---
We need someone to kill the Eve Scout dudes letting the nullkrabs know about Thera holes and that sounds like your jam.
---
and then i get downvoted for advocating the use of bots because CCP obviously doesn't give two shits... where's the "systematic change from those willing to break the rules" in that case?
---
So your talking about abyssal stuff, which I know nothing about, but some meta named items are pretty damn valuable. This is usually because *some* of them are close to the quality of tech 2 with a large advantage in cpu or powergrid costs.   
---
If you are a noob running missions in high its worth your time to at least figure out which ones those are because they can earn you quite a bit of isk--relatively speaking. 
---
Just put them in titans, then after 3 drops they can go the game is boring and leave. 
---
Don't post links to botting websites. 
---
If you disregard tracking completely it works this way:
---
Optimal range = 100% hit
---
Optimal + Falloff = 50% hit
---
Optimal + 2xFaloff = 1%ish hit
---
The further your target is in your falloff range the smaller the chance to hit.
---
To be specific, abyssals are unique in that you get BPs for meta entropic lasers, which are hot trash for the same reason any meta hardpoint is.
---
Because OP wants. He wants to dish all nthe effort of an organization. Keeping everyone at same conn. Planning Jump ranges. Active FCs to respond to attacks. Because he wants to run nano shit gangs
---
I know that Eve is a sandbox game. However there is VNI farming, and there is super-cap farming. You can do first pretty quick after you signup, you can't do the second, unless you spend lots of real ISK onto skill injectors.
---
Same with Nestors. And why would you fly over a billion ships in C3, making 200mil per hour? I am flying 2 Domis (500mil max for both) in C3 and 3 in C4. That's a golden middle for me. I don't see any reason using expensive Nestors (both fit and skill-wise) for anything under C5.   
---
But "I'm just a human, after all" :)
---
Yeah, I figured it out by re-reading the OP. 
---
Gonna go generic here. I'm not elite but I manage and I've got a few years of experience.
---
* Specialize, then generalize.
---
You want to be optimizing a single primary ship and learn what it can do and how you can get it better. As you skill up, the number of ships you can fly will broaden as well. So right now, that means pick a weapon system and focus on that 1 weapon system and train the ship skill for the hull you fly to 4 right away.
---
* Learn what other ships can do.
---
You need to know what other ships can do, at least which one are hard counters. A blaster atron will struggle against a comet because everything the atron can do, the comet does almost as well. A light missile condor can usually safely engage almost all the comets and as a good chance of running away if the comet is rail fit. A Tracking Disruptor / Neut slasher can kill pretty much all the railgun ships in the game and a lot of the laser ones so long as it survives into a tight orbit. It can sometimes take on blasters too.
---
* People who see you a lot will hard counter you.
---
If you fly around in a Vexor, you'll mostly get fights from people who think they can kill a vexor. It's the nature of the game that the easiest fights to get into are the ones where the other party wants it as much if not more than you. Usually for good reasons.
---
* Fly something you can afford to lose a lot.
---
Goes without saying, if you can only afford to lose 2 or 3 ships and then you'll need to rat for a week to pay them, you'll learn slower than if you can afford to lose 20.
---
* Join faction warfare.
---
Faction warfare plex are the best way to level the playing field some. A novice plex will only admit T1 frigates (including navy and pirate ones). So your slasher/atron/slicer does not have to worry about fighting a jaguar or a wolf. A medium will not allow a battlecruiser to jump your vexor. You'll earn LPs which can really help finance your ship loss. 5000 to 10000 LP (which can be earned in 15 minutes) will pay for a T2 fit frigate roughly.
---
* Join a corp that does solo / small gang.
---
They also tend to be FW corp (surprise...) and they will be able to help you. Flying in a group of 2-4 means you can probably take on that jaguar and while you might die, the jag as a good chance to die to.
---
Since you stated an affinity for the vexor, maybe you can also give the tristan and the algos a try. A tristan is a very versatile kiter or neut brawler. The drone skill are fully transferable and you can delay training Tech 2 medium drones in favor of T2 light drones (less SP, faster train) and support skills (especially the HUGE Drone Interfacing.)
---
My favorite tristan fit has a microwarpdrive, a medium shield extender, and a warp disruptor II in the mid slots, a nanofibre and 2 drone damage amplifiers in the low slots and rigs that either benefit speed/agility or shield tank. Along with 8 acolyte II drones (which I find best all around option.)
---
vni ratting please. never subject people to that torture. super ratting obviously out of the realm of possibility here. now the domis thats a great option that i didnt think of initially and you should have said that in the first reply. 
---
but all in all to the op what you should probably do is find you a corp and get out of hs. your not gana find much more opportunity solo or just with a friend to make that much more isk than you already are. (except hs incursions but i dont really recommend that either.) or day tripping into whs which you can def do but its difficult without backup.
---
I transferred 1 ISK to his account
---
Or don't behave like that, and help someone out who might enjoy doing those things, because they're not a jaded "gotta buy supers" bro complaining about the game all day instead of actually playing.
---
Ahh would recommend to use large ones when I got the skills , they will give u some extra dps 
---
I heard that it's dying. It's one of those long protracted illnesses I guess.
---
Well in that case It would be ok to start titan 5 when omega , deactive omega , log that character of for 2 months sup it again and have titan 5 trained without beeing omega .. sounds legit not like an exploit aswell 
---
Disliking capital proliferation is hate speech guys lol
---
Hopefully with the note "there could have been more zeroes, but you were a prick" or similar. Lol
---
No I'm not ?
---
They will miss when they're close, but not because of range, because of tracking. You can think of it in terms of 'how fast are the targets circling you?' If a target is moving in a circle around you, if they're closer the circle is smaller and so it takes less time to move in a full circle, even at the same speed. Therefore, a closer target will have a higher angular velocity and so your sentries will have a harder time tracking it.
---
This idea is common to more than just sentries. In general, if you have larger guns or longer ranged guns, their tracking values are low enough that a smaller target getting close will gain a high enough angular velocity that you will start not being able to hit them. This is known as 'getting under the guns' and is a common concern in both pvp and pve, and you'll see it against smaller npc rats as well as player ships if you're trying to use cruiser scale long range guns.
---
WHat would make them so different from Guristas, Blood Raiders or Serpentis Dreads then?
---
So, the other answers are confused or wrong.
---
You are only able to route 3000 units because that's all the factory input can hold.  The input bins on everything in PI are very limited, so you don't want to route directly to them.
---
Each P1 factory run takes 3000 units of P0.  If you look at the estimated hourly output when setting up your extractors, you can make a reasonable guess about how many factories you will need per hour to process the materials.  The output from the first cycle will be many times larger than that average, and the output from the last cycle will be many times smaller than that average.  Storage/Launch Pads are the key to smoothing that out.
---
If you're doing a P2 planet (two P0 extractors-&gt;launch pad-&gt;6 P1 factories-&gt;launch pad-&gt;3 P2 factories-&gt;launch pad) then you only need one launch pad's storage on 2-day cycles.  If you're doing a P1 planet or some other combinations you may need to use one or more of the storage facilities to hold some materials.
---
I would've responded in kind by blowing up the wrecks... I'm not a very nice person... Though I would've probably also then left him a couple million with a note.
---
20 min after I leave the fleet, a Nyx kill. :(
---
Deus Vulture!
---
Yeah guess so, I've been playing for like 5mo and if anything the average number of online people has went up significantly in that time. When I started was maybe 25-27k online at most, now I'm regularly seeing 35k+.
---
But how would you know about this to get people to come back if it is somewhat obscure in regards to not that many seem to know about it?
---
Yes this is my jam I'll hit you guys up when I get home
---
damm that took long 
---
Yeah that would work too. I mainly say stain cause the money is good. I like the idea of controlling a little section of it with an iron fist. 
---
It would be interesting to know how many of those are alts.
---
I still like low sec and have the most experience with it I'll be sure to save your info. Where are you stationed out of? I used to live in black rise 
---
Also switch the drone nav for another onni, unless you're actually sending drones out to move (sentries don't move)
---
In my opinion the presence of alts (omega at least) is not really a disparaging feature when looking at the total playerbase. More accounts online flying about is what makes the MMO feel massive, feel alive. What do I care if there is some overlap when it comes to faces behind the screen? Additionally, Eve has always been a niche game, and I think I'd rather it be populated by fewer people who pay for more accounts rather than hordes of people who only play one. This is a bit elitist, but there are honestly so few hardcore MMO options left that I'm fine with it. Sorry for the rambling, fly safe.

Between skill injectors and the amount of ISK that vets are able to throw around to newbs like it's nothing, I find it a little bit sad that new players aren't having to work their way through the low-level content. There's something sweet about killing a belt rat, looting it, and salvaging the wreck, and being excited about a few tens of thousands of ISK. It's nice that you wanted to help him, out, but I don't think he should be shamed by experiencing the game in a way that gives a real sense of progression and accomplishment.
---
Wow dude, that's really cool. Love to see people flying their caps. Where do you like to fly yours? And when.
---
They're somewhat expensive to get into but they're really fun to fly

Started mid 2009, joined eve Uni, they gave me a 3 month list of learning skills to train and I was told to stay docked because they were war dec'd. I left 2 days later. Still trained the learning skills. Resumed playing eve 3 months later after logging in and updating my 24hr skill queue often. Joined a mining Corp that built ships for SBing BSs in Rancer. Got a faction rat that dropped a 400m implant. Sold that in Jita. Moved to a LS pirate corp. Accidentally bought a shuttle for 250m. Learned how to make isk via LS exploration. It was slow. Learned some pvp there, wanted more. Flew with bomber bar a bunch. Needed isk. Moved into a c2 wh to make shit idk while doing the PvP with bombers bar. Moved to null sec, made great isk, made friends, made more pvp happen. Had fun. Took me 9 years but the learning occurred. It was tough. Confusing. Frustrating at times. But figuring it out is what kept me coming back.
---
abyssal mods are one of the dumbest features in the game

&gt;It would be interesting how many of those are *bots.*

Should have said I'm donating some isk toward you, placed a 100k bounty, and then tracked his losses for the next few months.

I can totally see all the CODE suicide catas wearing it!
---
Well this kind of ship used to be special. I remember being pretty excited whenever i saw titans/supers on grid. Nowadays I can fly around almost any null bloc space and see them everywhere I go. I dunno, it seems a little broken to me.

We actually just moved up here from The Bleaklands. Loving it so far. We hunt all over black rise every day. Is siren123 your in game name? 
---
So what? How is that a point in a balance discussion? That’s what they added faction titans for. 
---
What is Voltron?
---
Give widow bonus to be able to turn off cynos after spool up? 😂 not just prevent from lightning. Would be interesting. Maybe a bit OP but meh. 
---
I have several tristans, I'm working out how to fit one right now.
---
This is a video game, not the civil rights movement honey.
---
Legacy - test = Voltron 
---
Anyone remember when the first skill you needed to train were intelligence persuasion will etc...? 
---
Re-bind the hotkeys so they aren't overlapping?
---
So you assume they’ve optimized all said and done despite large dosage of evidence to this point says they haven’t .. everything from local crashing, slow uptake of on perm microservicr architecture etc ... moving tech to 64 bit is easy unless you actively refactor and augment your tech up and down the stack to leverage it ..
---
I wager they haven’t at best this is a compiler upgrade 
---
Most newbies are the same as you initially. Some remain that way for their entire careers. There's an entire spectrum of solo players out there. From least to most extreme:
---
1. "I don't know how to PvP yet."
---
2. "I am too poor to afford PvP."
---
3. "NPCs tremble at my wrath but the idea of facing a human opponent scares me."
---
4. "I am a pacifist and wish we could all just get along."
---
5. "PvP is for sadists who murder puppies IRL and EVE would be better without it."
---
6. "I never undock."
---
If you're not too far along the spectrum there may be some hope for you. For now, just do the introductory tutorial, the career agents, and then talk to mission agents. When you encounter  mechanic you don't understand, Google it, because somewhere, somebody has documented it. That'll give you a thorough "feel for everything". :)
---
pretty cut and dry. security missions or anomalies in high sec. if the intention is to learn what you need to feel comfortable so you can then step into pvp then there really no point in doing much pve stuff. your not gana learn much more that like what different modules do. your best bet would be to find a corp and get out there and pew. besides all that find a corp. best way to learn eve is from people.

Old coalition made alliance of lowsec groups that banded together to resist cfc's viceroy program push into lowsec. Not this shit and they shouldn't be using the name. 
---
You can’t lose the game if someone else reminds you of it, so it is you that lost. Everyone who read this won.  
---
You'll notice a faint blue aura around your capacitor wheel (that means your ship is selected and those commands will relate to the ship) your fighters when launched are also selected by default.
---
simply launch fighters, click on tube 1 hold cntrl and click the others. (fighters should now have the blue aura and your ship won't take the hotkey commands.
---
There is a flash player interactive guide who shows it quite nicely. Sadly the original site is down and you have to download it nowadays. if your fine with that you should try it out, it helps allot.
---
Maybe u should theorycraft a way to deal with supers, it's not hard to deal with supers you just have to be smart about it. Or learn to disengage. Quit your complaining, all it shows is that you have a poor understanding of game mechanics and inability to deal with problems efficiently. 
---
Except if you give a command to align. 
---
That said in "Lucifer Morningstar's voice"
---
you know small guns will out track you even with a tracking disruptor on them
---
It's the same command can't remind individually. 
---
You get diminishing returns on ultra specialized hulls.  It has been this way for years and I doubt it'll ever change.
---
can we just stop fucking giving ccp money, let them die already
---
Serious answer:  
---
A part of the dislike from major groups is that players in C4 space tend to not enable certain styles of PVP that higher classes allow, mainly due to mass limits and local capital advantages. That doesn't mean there's no way to blow people out of their homes, but it makes fighting the residents a little harder because you may have to contest with ten FAXs, which most conventional fleets won't break.  
---
Personally I think C4 space and C2 space is the best space for smaller entities to generate content both inside their own chain and outside. It creates massive chains, but also makes it a little harder to do massive fleets.
---
If you kind a key to the "Orbit" command (Settings&gt;Shortcuts&gt;Combat&gt;Orbit) and use that, it will only affect whatever is highlighted. If you make sure your carrier is NOT highlighted, it will not start orbiting.
---
I do this all the time while carrier ratting. I'm practically spamming orbit on living targets or wrecks, to avoid them taking damage. My carrier never changes it's alignment unless I accidentally select it too.
---
It appears to be dying but can't. Eve is undead.
---
So you want even more of an advantage. Maybe try getting good? Plenty of hunters getting kills, maybe the issue isn't local, but you?
---
Hell Yeah Brother, Cheers From Iraq!
---
r/EVE vets: "First thing I teach noobs is not to trust anyone with anything."
---
also r/EVE vets: "Why didnt this new player trust me? What an asshole..."
---
Except if you give a command to align (not approach) your carrier will align regardless. I didn't say anything about orbiting. 
---
Align. Not approach. So needs to be something off grid. 
---
EVE as it was in 2005 or before.
---
no titans

no supers

no rorquals

dreads and carriers at most

i wonder how many of you could hack it with those of us that remember what it was like.
---
People grinding and Injecting all day? Idk
---
It was a meme you vni rat until you inject a niddy, you carrier rat until you inject a hel, then you start Injecting Rorq after Rorq. It's not supposed to be a real thing, and it isn't very healthy for Eve

In what system are you flying that baby?
---
… so I can come and admire it!
---
I wish they'd just gave option to bait tank fit every miner.
---
How they could do is, give them plenty of fitting resources, but increase the fitting needs of miners to compensate. But when you don't use the mining lasers, you could fit a decent tank on them.
---
Procurer only has great tank cause of it's base stats, modules wise you can fit on it about as much as on a frigate.
---
&gt; That was the suprisiest noob attitude I have ever met.
---
A friend of mine, mines with 20 rorquals. He spent like 2 hours a few days ago, doing a lot of trips to buy cheaper components to makes his T2 Rigs for his Nyx.
---
He saved like 30m and spent a time that worth around 4.4b with his rorquals
---
This was the surprisiest noob attitude that i ever saw in eve in my whole life
---
I never said it was. For some reason you asked me if I "want to go back to a time where titans can be op because only a few elite (us) have them?" and I gave you my opinion.  Get some context. 
---
When you deploy to 'PvP', but want to also mine.

Ctrl click your capacitor so the blue circle around it goes away and use w with a click to get fighters to orbit.

That doesn't work with supers.

Did it once. Found a noob in my corps wh and gave him a lecture in local (like, don't go scanning when you see a T3 dessie flying around on your dscan). Got the GTFO reply, found him scanning cans on a relic, podded him and went on with the lecture on evemail. Gave him 10mil after he realized his mistakes (his loot x2).
---
These packages are suspected to contain stolen goods and will therefore be kept for further inspection by Space Police Khanid Division.
---
Power vs projection should be a trade-off, currently it is not. Your straw-man argument is detrimental to dialogue - most whaling fleets have significantly more isk on field than a rorq/carrier, and often more similar to a supercarrier (esp with mineral prices where they are atm...)
---
Caps might need clearer strengths (certainly dreads need to be more threatening), but they definitely need clearer weaknesses.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ZpQ3XAi.png you have taken my content
---
I don't know how "trust" is involved in this situation. 
---
Can’t say I’ve ever had that feeling(started 2007), I guess I learned the game so fast and early, and when I got into a cap for the first time(circa 2009?) I already had three fully fitted ready to go... helped I was also part of an elite Corp and we only used caps when absolutely necessary, and usually always came out on top in fights... I guess everyone has different experiences 💁‍♀️ 
---
Pm me his name ill kill him and send him your regards.
---
Umm why didn't you give him the cash for having the correct attitude? 
---
It's about the same as the DRF's B and C teams were
---
lol why follow the sub at all if that's your stance?
---
After 30 years of paying for eve I finally logged in. 
---
I think you are looking for the Ferox police skin, for patrolling around perimiter
---
what does it matter in the age of Rorquals Online? They're both shit.
---
all hail the kikimora 
---
Actually there was a really cool war game run by the US a few years ago now where fishing boats were indeed used to cripple carrier groups. So the real world is not born out by your point there. 
---
Furthermore, when was the last time an American full-size aircraft carrier was anywhere without an escort fleet?
---
This makes a lot of sense for those that want to larp in HS as they enforce mining permits and ratting licenses etc.
---
Ty man appreciate it.
---
shhh no telling (ya boi got no permit)
---
Oh lol, yea sorry. I read that as orbit. My bad. Disregard my rant plz :)
---
The fucking crossfiters of EVE except they don't look hot...generally. 
---
No running a Marathon is fun.
---
The game has been like that since long before skill injectors and rorquals. Even when I started in 2012 that kind of content wasn't relevant. 
---
The thing that changed was how newbies are "educated". If you put at least a little bit of thought into your isk-making you wouldn't loot and salvage single gate rats for 10k isk or whatever, even back then. But many new players just didn't know any better.
---
The thing that's different now isn't injectors or rorqual isk. It's the new-player alliances that tell new players how to make isk efficiently.
---
Born in wormholes,  killed in wormholes,  died in wormholes, praise Bob
---
Wormholer btw.
---
Lmao. Have you ever fought a carrier or supercarrier while not being anchored out of curiosity? 
---
Also, when was the last time you launched pyfa? Is it installed on your computer? Easy to talk shit when you aren't the person who does theorycrafting, FC a fleet, or hell even help seed a dread fleet.
---
&gt; In my opinion the presence of alts (omega at least) is not really a disparaging feature when looking at the total playerbase.
---
what? every major alliance and important low sec spaceport has one or more sets of cloaky eyes abusing local that do fuck all except inflate the player numbers.
---
That is how winners talk.  If he wanted your charity he would have named himself Dr. Quinn or Medicine Woman.
---
My favourite in bnet were the people who offered an Um'ed Shako for an Um. I traded at least 5 of them, then resold the Um'ed Shako for Um Pul.
---
It works pretty well for something totally unsupported.  
---
I did some small testing on Sisi today (warping, NPC hunting, UI) and everything was as usual, maybe with exception of increased RAM consumption. Looking forward to first mass test.

So what do we change to make it happen?

Oof. Must have been a Goon hauler.
---
Couple things
---
CCP still has not finished teiricide a process that began in late 2012. Expecting they can deliver a monthly, shit lets be even more fair and say bi-monthly balance patch is just a dreamer dreaming.
---
Second
---
CCP is absolutely the last group of people id want to be pushing balance changes out there. Maybe a decade ago when they actually had a development staff that facilitated a group of people dedicated to gameplay balance monitoring, but that ship sailed a long time ago...CCP just does not have the manpower anymore to handle that responsibility, especially in a game as complex as EVE where there are so many variables to consider from a balance standpoint that it is rarely as simple as saying of thats being used a whole bunch lets nerf it!.  
---
Case #1 Drones as a Weapon System.  
---
This was a pet project of CCP Rise, and while intentions are reasonable, implementation was nothing short of a disaster. It led to a consecutive string of ship nerfs because of the weapon system, rather than changing the weapon system its self. Ships that received the old hammer approach, Dominix, Prophecy, Gila, Rattler, Ishtar, VNI....but...that wasn't enough, because in the end it was all because of Drone Bunny mechanics right...no. People despite nerfs to these ships still use Drone based doctrines because the weapon system its self is largely impervious to any other outside influence, short of defanging ships....which is why the Good Old SlowCat saw Carriers get completely overhauled.  
---
Drones primarily Sentry Drones, were just a broken weapon system that had no effective country measure short of destroying the host, or the drones themselves, with insanely good application across the spectrum of hull sizes, and over a very large window of engagement. But yes it was totally the ships that used them...not at all the drones...its why people no longer use drone boats after their subsequent hull nerfs over several years....oh wait.
---
Case #2 Battle Cruiser Nerfs and Changes to Medium sized weapons (namely missiles)
---
This one was a great example of a change for change sake that effectively destroyed the healthy PVP ecosystem in EVE, and we still feeling that change today. The reason for this nerf. People preferred flying Drakes and Canes over the other BCs. So instead of balancing the other BCs around this...CCP just decided to nerf the lot of them, and step on Heavy Missile and Arty platforms to really shake people out of the Drake Cane mindset.  
---
What impact did this have. People stopped using BCs, and thus without BCs to eat, BS dried up to, and we became cruisers online.   
---
Meanwhile an unintended consequence of this nerf to the high alpha long range weapon systems missiles and arty provided...was drone boats no longer having a long range threat against them...see Case #1 for how that turned out.  
---
Case #3. Speed Creep and "we fucked up medium weapons"  
---
So now that we had transitioned to cruisers on line, CCP decided it was best to double down on their removal of the BC from the ecosystem by increasing the base speed of every single hull size smaller than them...doesn't take a math degree to understand why this was legit retarded...but it took CCP a good 6 months to see that when you make target go faster, and don't change the speed that weapons track...it fucks up the entire balance...Cruiser Weapons that couldn't hit cruisers....and which ship tier ate that...why BCs of course, a ship class that by nature counters cruisers, unable to hit these ships with weapon sizes intended for those targets....and certainly not able to keep up...and it wasn't just on grid speed... CCP decided that small ships should arbitrarily just warp faster than big ships...so they made it that BC and BS could never hope to catch a cruiser group or smaller. Baring some huge blunder by the cruiser group of course.  
---
But to their credit CCP went back and spent several patches "fixing" Medium Weapons, extending optimals, increasing tracking, enhancing damages, or rates of fire...all because for whatever reason they felt that Cruisers needed to move an extra 50 to 100 m/s baseline.   
---
With BCs successfully removed by this point from the "food chain" BS died shortly thereafter....and still to this day the old Cruiser &lt; BC &lt; BS &lt; Cruiser triangle is broken. This trifecta of balance blunders started around 2012...and CCP has been chasing it in a circle for going on 6 years now....and they still haven't finished tiericide.  
---
TLDR  
---
Personally I am skeptical of CCPs ability to balance given historical precedent, especially now with their much reduced man power compared to roughly a decade ago. Maybe one day they will finish tiericide so they can get back in touch with gameplay.  
---
Because salvagers are note worthy in 2019 :') 
---
Brave wore it better.
---
What if I don't have the skills for it?
---
I have both flown and combatted supers a lot, if you dot understand their limitations then your too single minded to even bother having an discussion with.
---
If they come in by cyno you have a good I would say 10 seconds to get off field before they can load grid lock you up etc, if that's not enough time for you to disengage your dead. 
---
There have been some good nano gangs out there that have had no issues with supers, main mistake I see people doing is targeting sirens before dromi's as support fighters without their mwds are very slow same with LR fibos so get rid of their webs and u can outrun them permanently. But hey what do I know I'm just some mindless f1 pushed according to you, I'll be quiet now ;). 
---
A single super is both dangerous and easy to combat, if their is multiple, well yeah your probs Gona die, but then you should gtfo before that becomes a problem.
---
I personally think supers are in a decent spot right now, they aren't OP but aren't useless. I think it's a you problem not a supercarrier problem 
---
that noise is awful
---
Is it worth blinging out a cruiser just to PVE?
---
The key has no bind by default, but when I train capital pilots, setting a bind for "toggle ship selection" is one of the first few steps. 
---
I personally use numpad 0 (zero).
---
You can find it in the fighters keybind tab. Having this key bound will allow you to quicky select or de-select your ship, as your needs vary. 
---
The former. While miners have always been forced to make a trade-off between fitting more tank and fitting more mining laser upgrades, the Skiff was megabuffed to allow 100k EHP tanks to allow miners to 'opt out' of being ganked at the expense of inherently lower yield.
---
Brave ONLY has salvagers in the highslots, so yeah they do wear it better. 
---
150 PanFam with caps on standby vs 40 or so test members. But hey, the Loki brought a salvager REEEE.
---
Hi , I want to make a really fast ship so it can dodge any attacks . How fast should I go to achieve that ?? ( I'm kinda new so no omega pls... )  .What kind of  fast build you can do ? I use Amarr ships, Executioner is the fastest one i have  but other kind of ships fitting is also ok...
---
I'm aware of undocks, what's an insta dock bookmark?
---
Depends on how often you want to restart/pick up. I do about 12 worlds set up with 1 max extractor (3 of each p1), 9 basic factories, 3 storage, 2 rocket pads. I do 4 day cycles and do a pick up on weekends. These 12 all funnel to 1 world to make p3s and the load keeps it running the whole week. I also do 3 and 3 of p1s for my worlds making p2s (coolant, etc). They run all week as well between pick ups. Every four days I go through all of the characters restarting the chain. Most of the time I don't move the heads but once every 3-4 cycles.
---
Lol wish they died.
---
PI needs to have saved layouts and have "build all" buttons so all factories of the same type build the same item with one click. Lastly, a supply all button. All factories that need the resource are done with one click.
---
Don't fly anything you can't afford to lose.
---
This chain is making me ir8. I can't w8 for this shit to be over.
---
Rule #1 don’t fly what you can’t afford/stomach to lose.
---
At least the "incapable of" part is correct
---
Learn from the experience, always keep aligned to something, even if it means aligning to different locations to stay in range of where you need to be.
---
You had a rude awakening, brush it off get back out there and get yourself another 117Mil
---
Exploration, mining, ratting (killing npc pirates), trade (requires capital to be profitable), and industry (requires lots of omega only skills to be profitable). 
---
I can give you a better overview of specific ones of those, but those are the main categories 
---

I do not think you answered by question. Have you ever fought a carrier or supercarrier in a "good" nano gang while not being anchored out of curiosity?
---
Also - why would you target the dromi when if the siren points you with super fights on you - your dead? 
---
Again, may I ask when was the last time you launched Pyfa and when is it installed on our computer?
---
You say it is a you problem when you haven't even tried to deal with the problem. You are using supercarriers and so obviously do not think they are a problem. 
---
And just in case you missed it - I want to ask it again. Have you ever fought a carrier or supercarrier while not being anchored out of curiosity?
---
How would I get into Ratting?
---
I hears about that before,that is why i have not dared to buy any more expensive ship and was only flying with heron. I basically lost expensive ship anyway due to my isk balance in loot in my cargo.
---
Anyways,rule#1 - if you dont plan on flying it, why bother buying it then?
---
Ah, yeah thats an important distinction
---

tell me you know Penif has flairbaited CVA forever? he literally wants to be in CVA so bad, he adopted their Reddit flare. He also roleplays. I was on comms on numerous occasions when he roleplayed while he was in Goonswarm ... Penif has repeatedly had his main turned down for membership by CVA leadership. So he flies their flag, hoping one day they will let him in.

The _primary_ benefit from a 64bit client, in this case, is the ability to map more than 2-3 GB of memory per process. Full stop. Anything beyond that is certainly a bonus but I'd be surprised if it made more than a marginal difference, and they still have to factor for the lowest common denominator, ie: people with 64bit capable CPUs that are still running 32bit operating systems.
---
Your "on prem microservice architecture" is just buzzword baloney and has very little application to Eve. I have no doubt they have already broken off as much of the low hanging fruit as they (easily) can into separate processes and/or services, see: chat (for better or worse), BIAB, etc. u/Fuzzmiester had a [good, albeit simplistic, explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amuc4p/64_bit_client_pushed_with_latest_sisi_update/efpqtf9/) for why further work into breaking Eve out in more multithreading and/or microservices is likely to hurt as much if not more than it helps.
---
Depends on what you are doing, you put like 2b into a cruiser and you can probably do t3/t4 abyssals skills permitting. I wouldn't bling something out for security missions or ded sites. You want to look for your return on original investment. Unless pve is your main style of play, in which case bling that motherfucker out, show puffy who's boss.
---
basically it means that you mostly do stuff in wormhole space
---
Caldari 4TW
---
The crucial point here is power/projection disparity. Phrasing that in the terms of the OP, capitals currently don’t fit their niche, they spill out massively into subcap niches as well. 
---
Removing tackle fighters (What is the point of interceptor pilots if you have an ai entity that does their job for you?), heavy fighters (the anti-cap fighters fill that role well, and a full flight of lights is plenty of dps en masse, boson (how anyone ever thought the various iterations of wide aoe doomsday were good gameplay in a multiplayer game is beyond me) and giving dreads a role bonus to plate/extender HP (better chance against Titan blobs, specialises then more vs caps) would be the smallest/simplest set of changes I’d suggest.
---
I’d also look for a complete revamp of cyno mechanics, as I think binary mechanics are fundamentally a bad idea (see also: ECM) and they are the main cause of capital power being too readily projected. 
---
Ideally there would be more ways of modifying cyno behaviour than simply shutting them down, examples that spring to mind as potentially adding texture to the battlefield include making cynos within a distance indistinguishable from all those light years away, or making inhibs have signal strength effects on the beacon and so landing radius error increases, to foster a need to defend a deployed cyno with a proper beachhead. Etc
---
Nice you got the worst dread
---
Don't consider any of the stuff in your cargo as money. 
---
If you are going to be dipping into wormholes the best policy is to get in get out and safe up as quickly as you can in a T1 frigate. So dive into a wormhole scan down the site as fast as you can hack the most valuable can as fast as you can and get back to station as fast as you can to store your loot for future sale. 
---
You can start doing longer outings once you have enough money and training to fly a proper covops ship like the Buzzard or Astero (recommend the buzzard over the astero cus its a lot cheaper.)
---
You can also anchor a secure can in a safe (without a mobile depot) and store your loot in there if you think you are being followed that way you can come back at a later time to retrieve it. That way if you die while scouting to see if your exit is still safe and die you won't lose the loot.

Learn from experience as every else here says, try something new, but honestly, this is eve, you gotta learn to accept this stuff happens, I have lost 600 mil in ships in 4 days before, not fun, but, i took a break, went back to the basics of salvaging, made isk, then bought another ship. The first one hurts, you will get over it, you gotta be hungry enough to bounce back from this, if you arent hungry and cant stomach set backs, this game will be rough for tou

Shrug it off and continue. Soak in the experience and learn from mistakes.

It could be more profitable to shift your exploration from WH to Nullsec areas. Don’t get me wrong, WH space is a great place where fun dudes and great fights can be. But it’s less likely to find mint holes for good explo. Try it in Stain or the other of the calmer Null areas.
---
Continue to play, EVE isn’t that hard and losing space pixels is fun, too. :)
---
That's the wrong attitude. It's not a matter of "I bought it but I can't use it". It's a matter of knowing your limits.
---
If you don't have enough money to afford replacements, then don't buy it to begin with. Fly something cheaper. And do other things to make money. Once you make enough to afford more risky ventures, then you can take chances.
---
But you gambled on not getting caught, and you lost. 
---
Not pvp oriented? Are you describing the supercarrier as not pvp oriented? That would be a dumb fuckin statement if so. A single pilot...in a bigger ship. Yes he's gunna be difficult to deal with. And a fax...ok why do you think a small gang should be able to deal with that?
---
6-8 guys can deal with one carrier. Not supercarrier. In the proper ships and with proper electronic warfare. 
---
I switched to Eve Panda, never going back. 
---
You know that feeling of loss you felt when it all blew up? Remember that. Eve has some of the highest highs and lowest lows of any game I've ever played in my life. The highs will come if you stick with it and it's so worth it.  Learn from your mistake and get better. Next time, leave the wh and enter kspace (non-wormhole space) and dump your loot off in a neutral station, preferably in or near highsec to sell it more easily. 
---
Also, don't play alone. Join a corporation and talk to people. The strongest ship in the game is friendship, and it's free. Pm me here or in game "Legbeard Catfood" and we'll get you back on your feet, no strings attached 👌
---
I am not against it, I just don't think it's particularly unbalanced. You can still fit a decent tank on the mack (for rats at least) so I don't get the issue.   
---
Having 10k more EHP won't get you out if there's a gank rolling, so W/E. 
---
1. Kill, move on
---
2. They're bonus loot for extra time. I bring a mobile tractor unit to hoover them up while I clear the room
---
3. T4 is a major difficulty jump. You'll get more of everything, and the AI will be a little more annoying. In particular, rats will tend to orbit a little wider, so if webs are part of your setup, this is pretty much the point where faction webs become required due to AI behavior on some fits. Just be prepared. 
---
4. The module BPCs are pretty much dead loot right now I think. Although I think the Veles storyline guns are good, but I'm not sure if those drop as BPCs are not. Personally I'm holding all of mine incase they get tuned.
---
What? 
---
Buy PLEX
---
Consider a small container you can anchor in space. They can't be scanned down. Then drop it someplace off a main flight path in the WH, bookmark its location. Then hack a site, drop loot back in your safe spot. Hack the next sites, etc.
---
This way if your ship gets destroyed at a site, you lose a heron and that sites loot. You just come back in another one, collect the other loot.  
---
If you see any probes or ships on D just run it's not worth the risk. 
---
Thx, so how does one acquire a loot can? I saw them many times,they are everywhere.
---
I dont trust wormholes though,  since they may close at different times (i know that description tells basically how much time is left,but still), im at day 4 and they are still scary to me. Rad through maybe 50-60 since i started and even though i was cautious, and was doing the safe spotting and taking loot back when it reached 20-40 mil, I never encountered any hostile player,if any at all.
---
Except for today. Loosing most money I have ever earned and basically lost 3 hours for absolutely nothing broke me.
---
I still cant understand how that guy couls have done that, Im 4 days old acc. From reading forums, ppl were mostly nice towards nice accounts,not this harsh.
---
If you address the core problem of power/projection disparity you also solve (to some degree) the supercapital umbrella issue. A lot of your objections are addressed in the uncut set of these ideas, which I’d be happy to get your feedback on, much as I’d like to get a sense of the integration of your own ideas.
---
Fundamentally capitals shouldn’t be easy to get to a grid directly, given how overwhelmingly powerful they are once they’re there. If capitals are the new ships of the line then the skirmishing subcap fleets should be a required element to prepare the battlefield for them ahead of time. 
---
This approach applies as much to whaling as it does to hotdrops as it does to keepstar fights, and I’d welcome a well reasoned argument to the contrary. I believe that cyno mechanics are currently an example of bad gameplay design because there is no tuning handle (let us agree to ignore the elephant in the room of how frequently CCP uses the handles it already has!)
---
You didn't follow the #1 rule. If you can't stand to lose that much, then you shouldn't have been flying with that much. Don't quit, just dont make the same mistake again. Hightail it to safety when you hit X isk and stop off your loot. Train into and save for a ship that's harder to track (i.e. cov ops ships) than a ship without a covert ops cloak. Etc.
---
You clearly can't read, but incase you want to try, reread the first paragraph from my last post. Actually just reread it all, I think I sufficiently answer your "questions" you just need to have a brain.
---
I both admit that I use supers, especially to dunk retards that don't know how to deal with supers (seems like you might fit into this category). But I have also seen really good nano pilots that have easily, and I mean easily evade supers without a problem. 
---
And why kill the dromis, well I literally spelt it out for you, but again I must realise you are illiterate. They slow u down so sirens and LR fibos can't catch up and track you. Sirens and LR fibos are slow af, almost as slow as you. Like I said you need to have an understanding of ship mechanics, not just the ones ur trying to fly. 
---
And pyfa is only a tool, it does not have a brain so if the person behind the tool is a moron the tool is useless. But to answer your question as that seems to be your burning desire. I use it when I need it, I don't recall the last time I used it, probably a week ago but I was using it to check out the meme fit of the revenant loss in Provi haha XD 
---
&lt;3 
---
It was a deliberately simple explanation :D Didn't want to confuse people, mentioning things like the GIL, for example. 
---
(The Server's been 64 bit for about a decade now)
---
I think you shared your profile instead by mistake 👀
---
Ah man, this is a super hard question to ask. Most other games have linear sorts or matchups, and while that is still somewhat true in eve, there are tons of variables to consider. There is never an end all be all in the sense that you want it.     
---
      
---
Alright now to your question, the executioner is a good speed tanking ship, if you want to step it up one more notch try the imperial navy slicer. Try looking up these ships on zkill to get fits. Both are very good ships at learning pvp because one or two consecutive mistakes can be your downfall. And never forget this is very important.     
---
     
---
If you lose your ship and you learned something, it wasnt a loss, you paid for a lesson :).
---
Doesn't the rainbow Ferox just beg you to exist?
---
I will always pay a premium for convenience. Day before yesterday I needed a specialized hull. I could buy it in Hek for 90m, or go all the way to Jita and buy it for 50m. That would have involved me flying all the way to Jita then flying all the way back, passing Hek each way.  
---
I podded myself to hek and bought the 90m hull. 
---
You have managed to get into my YT recommended, this vid has followed me around all day.
---
Yes you will lose ships and cargo.  And yes it hurts a lot when starting out.  But in another month that 110 mil will look like chump change.  There is a tough learning curve to the game.  Stick with it.  Learn, grow, tweak your skills, train to better fits, and then better ships.  Join a new player corp as they can help you with isk making ideas, ship fits, and ideas of what to do next time.  
---
The career agents are good for making some start up isk and ships if you have not done them and you can do them for all the races if you want.  Mission running gets old fast but makes isk and lp.  Stick with it and soon you will smile thinking about how salty you got over 110mil
---
&gt; I still cant understand how that guy couls have done that, Im 4 days old acc. From reading forums, ppl were mostly nice towards nice accounts,not this harsh.
---
In a wormhole with no local you don't know who you're actually ganking until you're already getting on grid with them. When I kill explorers/ventures/etc I'm usually combat probing them and warping a Sabre to them and won't even know how long they've been playing until I'm shooting them.
---
Also if you leave high-sec you can't expect people not to kill you. Maybe some will reimburse you afterwards when they see you're new, but that's a nice thing for them to do, not an obligation.
---
heavy drinking
---
6-8 guys in the proper ships with electronic warfare are not guaranteed to be able to deal with a supercarrier effectively in the slightest. In fact, your hoping that your ECM drones actually land. If you are referring to an ECM ship - with the changes those don't matter anymore. 
---
I do not think a 6-8 man gang should deal with a fax. I am sorry if that was an implication. 
---
Finally, a supercarrier with max DDA's, mwd, max fighter support units and no tank - is not pvp oriented. 
---
Oh I know, didn't mean it as a shot or anything!
---
We’ll see .. you’re locked into the value proposition of 64bit I’m simply saying there is no outward appearance of actual effective delivery on any technical promise here ... preaching to me the benefits of 64bit is moot as you’re still in the rose coloured glasses story line. Now time will tell if my prediction is right or wrong but we’ll see.
---
Side note I used to manage Microsoft .net and worked on one of the first iterations of multithreaded CLR but anyway that’s appeal to authority on this subject from my end 
---
Gotta stick it to the GREEDY alliance marketeers trying to make a PROFIT
---
Nice!
---
Only thing I might have requested is an overlay of which pilot was speaking somewhere on screen as I don't recognize the voices and had to hop back to the intro's to try and match some comments up.
---
Skiffs were boosted because they were all paper thin. Hulks ruled the belts for a long time but that was because it had the highest yield. 
---
Excellent Nyx Pilot. More tank fit because I am not stupid.
---
Ships are bullets. Reload and get back out there.
---
His body is ready.
---
I main yeah, they've handled/are handling it like shit.  But I really can't imagine monthly minor tweaks to a handful of ships really would take that much dev time.  Seems to be more about their development philosophy, of aiming for huge balance shifts every major patch instead of minor tweaks on a regular basis.
---
I'm using [Solus](https://getsol.us/) (a stable but rolling release distro) with the 4.9 LTS kernel, currently on Lutris 0.4.23 since I haven't downloaded the updates yet.
---
For the Lutris script itself, I use [the one labelled "Wine wrapper (CCP)"](https://lutris.net/games/eve-online/), aka the one with the native Linux launcher. If that doesn't work try the one labelled "Windows version" I guess - the major difference is in the tweaks CCP have made to Wine to run the game itself, but the regular Windows version may work better for you.
---
Note I haven't played in a little while but it's always run smoothly for me. Best of luck in getting it to work :)
---
Deselect your ship.  
---
Literally, first page in "Carriers 101".
---
&gt; umbrella mechanics 
---
Stopped reading here. 
---
Ahh so you don't theorycraft or do anything related to nano. Good to know. Siren's with an MWD are in fact easily fast enough to tackle a ship long enough for "long-range" fighters whose speed does not matter. I am not slow. If you have the DPS to deal with a Dromi - great. However, when your limited in size and numbers (again I am talking about a single unsupported super) it does not matter. The L-R fibo's go out and you will get blapped. GG. 
---
Avoiding Supers is not an issue. You can't go into pipes. You need to be wary using d-scan of sabres and make SURE to keep scouts on gates to make sure you don't get cloaky sabres. I don't want to have to avoid a super around every corner of every system. Instead, supercarriers should not have the power and ability to frag every type of ship from frigate to battleship with only a procurer cyno as support. 
---
You should use Pyfa sometime to see the volley a super will do to a subcapital. The only subcapitals that remotedly tank a super with a solo tank is a 100mn strategic cruiser. Maybe a solid 100mn bling phantasm. Any ship with an MWD will immediately evaporate when a super drops a siren and a dromi. Due to the speed of an MWD's siren is easily able to keep up with a cruiser long enough for the L-R fibo's to blap. 
---
You are ok with the place of supers because you have never attempted to deal with supers with anything short of an FC telling you what to do. Again, when you have to use your own brain to fight a super you will end up on the other side of this equation. 
---
You do not fly nano. You do not theorycraft. You do not do any actual piloting. You light cyno's and yolo a super around. It must be really easy for you to know the mechanics of this game when you have played on one side of it. GF.
---
On the market, it's called a small secure container. assemble it and put it in your cargo hold and anchor it when you want to. 
---
Hold on to that fear you feel. But avoid panicking, simply staying calm and aware of what's going on around you will put you ahead of the game already. 
---
That's why it was so easy starting out. You weren't aware of the danger so you weren't panicking. Now you are on to learning the next step: being aware of the danger without panicking.
---
Shame.  I costs nothing to listen to someone trying to help you.
---
I've had people show up in WHs when I was brand new to them and give me tips.  They could have easily just killed me, but instead gave me some new ideas of how to play, and sent me on my way in safety.
---
There is value in letting people speak.
---
Its funny to watch the same fuckers whine about the same shit, in cycles of 3 weeks.
---
I think bots is next week.
---
&gt; I used to _manage_ Microsoft .net
---
Yeah, I can tell.
