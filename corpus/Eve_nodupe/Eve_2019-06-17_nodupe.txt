I play the same way, I have 1 carrier pilot so in that regard I‚Äôm with you. PL was never good, though, and the only thing that made them any good was an earlier starting date.

Dude, theres so much shit going on in your tz. Pay attention to pings and join some sigs.

Man there are people in current year eve who don't know what T20 is, and think BoB is some stupid wormhole memegod.

Do you have clear vision?

And it took no less than one year of seeding Sdasdasds.
---
Yeah sure, hire some space lawyer, I heard some of them live in Jita

It‚Äôs almost worth it to see PL humbled and exposed.

You've never trained something for a doctrine and then waited ages before ever using it? Or just rushed T2 because you didn't want to half-ass it?

I don't think I've ever fired a T1 laser.

Surprisingly accurate in my experience. It's the tops that are quitting. The line members are either going to migrate a short distance or a long distance, and most people can't be bothered traveling a long distance.

It's not a big thing. But it's enough of a thing that your Nightmare runs two sets of faction/t2 ammo and a spare non-faction set. That way if you happen to burn out one too many faction crystals you can use the normal ammo in the ungrouped gun (or if you are doing missions or something you can just put use non-faction for the entire group).
---
TSM wonned?!

Undefended, doesn't count.

Check out wormhole alliances like Volta.,

Awesome to see this kind of content Blood. I started up "Redboxed" with TruexXx back in the day doing this exact thing. Will give it a listen, but I'm excited!

Praising Mittani is like praising Trump. Most people who do either only do it to piss off the other side.

To many correct spellings and grammar punctuation to be a real goon post.

According to the Chronicles they can be some pretty shady traders. SuVee/Thukker collaboration is totally doable according lore. But Mordus covers fast and missiles. 
---
Hybrids are already overrepresented in faction ships. 
---
You could go with bonus to painters and missile explosion rad/vel, and give them nice agility and very low sigrad perhaps?
---
It's a tough one, and it sucks because Thukkers are the only real believable Calmatari connection.

" Why vote for me?

I  stand firm that we need to keep our new player base and that with 80%  of EVE being PVE base we need to conform to their needs. I will advocate  for the firing of Hilmar an bring in a better CEO for CCP. I believe he  is the reason EVE is a total shit show today. "   
---
Well I can think of at least one reason they ignored you.
---
That's exactly how I started off making money way back in 2013 Delve. Good isk for a new guy.
---
Let me rephrase that for you.
---
0.0 Space is fucked. 
---
Move out of 0.0 and into WHs or hell, Even lowsec for that matter. Become a dirty - 10 pirate. Or a dweller of J Space. Ive always played Eve on and off and lived in null as I thought it was the means to All ends.

Its not.

Heh. Hehe

Look at goons killing yet another undefended asset in space and bragging about it while losing the northern war so terribly.
---
Uhhh nice guess
---
And eliminating the "alliance" tab from overview?
---
Serious question: were they actually good at the game back when? Or were they just the first ones with a super/titan blob?
---
I want you to be CSM... Said no one ever
---
Where are they now then? After NC. is gone then who is next? Who ACTUALLY wants to go empire building with eve today like that?
---
Does this go for all the dunks in Delve too...?
---
Stop huffing ether.
---
Oh wow, some decent effort post for once.
---
WOW 11 PEOPLE WANT ME TO BE IN CSM!!!  
---
See this CCP???!!!??
---
*sits patiently waiting till Goons run out of targets and notice test is still hiding behind their couch*
---
Both. Alot of the pilots that formed other alliances and entities came from there. So they had alot of highly skilled experienced (not so related) pilots. they weren't interested in Sov. They were the Merc force. Their job was services to highest bidder.
---
I hear it was 5 years
---
I usually reserve my comments for quality, but in this case I‚Äôll make an exception.
---
If you were elected to the CSM, how would you spilt your time between the CSM and the Mental Asylum your currently in?
---
That‚Äôs a great goal I hope you make it. üòú
---
lol JFs are not T3, they are the only T2 capital ship.
---
Yeah dunks count in Delve - just know you're AND1'ing without a competing team.
---
this post
---
4 years of planning, one year of seeding scanners, another year of rolling, and a year of logging off Raven alts.  Basically they started a week after the server went live.
---
EVE will die sooner than you run out of these.
---
Fleet warped one titan to a dictor + dreads.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Another Titan had flag exempt, so I kicked him from fleet, re invited him and fleet warped him too.
---
Was just curious tbh you guys up in imperium can't seem to keep a narrative straight almost worse than the North
---
TLDR 2 Titans got warped off their Keepstar and we dropped dreads on them. Also Vert is a hero.
---
Thank you very much for your detailed response! I may give dessies a shot over frigs, but will probably just buy a mix of things and check em out. Silly question, what do you mean by control being in? Do you mean preference for webs over scrams/disruptors? and thank you for the guide as well.
---
I didn't think about the alpha restrictions on my skills... I might have to take a better look at what is suitable as my skills wont be what they used to.
---
I hear they had ravens in there before wormholes were made.
---
Its ok there, they can fix some of those things.
---
Cloudspit, you have a gift.
---
Probably right - that dickhead Brisc got dank CSM leaks that WHs were about to become a thing, so he started the whole thing - that's why CCP banned him.  The ban was literally years in the making.  Give it 10 minutes, and Brisc will be by to tell you how amazing he is.  That guy is great.  Never brags or draws attention to himself at all.  Solid all the way around - just like his president.

So the classic \*insert comment how you did it first so that makes it ok, you killed the game and I'm totally not\*

On my way to the 20m, thanks to that Twitch Prime promotion. I can fly anything an alpha can, maxed on gal/cal mostly, on the T2 weapons side I can use small/medium Hybrids, Rockets/RLML/RHML and small lasers atm.

Other wormhole corps won't satisfy you after you finally drink tiny's kool-aid
---
&gt;You could go with bonus to painters and missile explosion rad/vel, and give them nice agility and very low sigrad perhaps?
---
Minmatar T1 ewar is a painter bonus, and the Golum has it too. Many ships already have missile application bonuses. 
---
And there are agility and signature bonuses on existing ships too. 
---
Part of what distinguishes a pirate ship line is the fact that do something completely outside the norm. 
---
* Sansha AB speed bonuses. 
---
* Serpentis web-strength bonuses. 
---
* Blood neuts always neut. 
---
* Guristas have OP drones, but only two at a time. 
---
If 'shady trading' was the theme, then maybe;
---
* a 100% per-level bonus to the effectiveness of Expanded Cargoholds,
---
* alternatively, +1 extra (independent) Fleet Hanger Bay (to put a cap on the largest object haul-able),
---
* a bonus to loot-range.
---
Weird stuff like this is what needs to happen.
---
Most of this salvage has a pretty tight margin anyway like less then 5% right now
---
 No. That doesn't need to happen at all. Back to the drawing board.
---
Im calling troll on these posts.

can you use a cloak?
---
not really, that was a shit bait post
---
 Unless of course, he forgets too get them out
---
Where will those 1000's of votes you had secured go to now?!
---
I'm not saying that specifically needs to happen. 
---
I'm just saying that missile application bonus is an uninspired option because it already exists in-game. Repeating that role basically means you have two ships for the one job and everyone will just categorically pick the better one.
---
Didn't want those titans anyway.
---
Welcome to the club. To date I had wasted about a cost of an entire fully fitted dread on insurances alone.
---
I‚Äôd say these guy have mastered the art. Cancer to fly through the 2-3 systems they‚Äôve set up themselves in and have optimized their strategy. As annoying as they are, I have lots of respect for these guys.
---
To be fair they camp anything that comes through that pipe.
---
jesus that site is cancer to the eyes. What I got out of it was "I gots the discord logs that show I didn't know some guy I was regularly giving and taking billions in isk from was banned for RMT"
---
&gt;Tbh I did small gang. And tourneys I don't like supers and.blobs.
---
Then you must be in the wrong alliance. PL is a retirement home, now there are high SP people everywhere, so the crutch no longer props you up as high.
---
Is that how it happened?...
---
I guess I worded it incorrectly. Basically the problem with this situation is that generally you get some really weird product of both factions strengths. Cadari/Minmatar are too redundant for anything to make any sense according to the lore. Been thinking about this shit since 2012.
---
They're good and I quite like them, but I like PVP too much to join them.
---
What would this change: literally nothing.
---
ill have you know good posting with a BL flair is illegal and im calling the cops

Well it's not just me, most of my old friends appeared to have stopped playing. I'm dabbing my toes back into it now but I havent been given a reason to resub my accounts.

I do miss being the little guy giving the middle finger to huge alliances though, but now that's nearly impossible.

i give it 6 months until Goons is looking for more people to fight, and notice Test exists

Isn't that about the time WWB was drawing to conclusion?

I've thought about blowing what little I have left and living the nomads life in a wormhole.

Erm, pretty much everyone who is running has a reputation. That won't keep you off of CSM lol.
---
Too much opportunity cost, ecosystem changes need to come first
---
Right? Back in my day it was about getting on grid before the other side so when they jumped in they would black screen lag out. Then we would risk aversely AOE DD their fleet through a cyno.
---
Why is it called the Northern war when it's Delve that's burning?
---
Not really working when it takes ccp 4 months of "investigation" to ban an obvious bot. A brand new VNI Bot made that money for his banned bot back in a single day.
---
control is your ability to dictate the terms of a fight, particularly range. although in lowsec control is mostly defined on the afterburner-scrambler-webifier axis, different factors such as cap warfare and speed advantage may come into play. dual webs in mid slots is an effective way to establish control.
---
flying destroyers is a good idea, not many buttons to press and well equipped to deal with a number of situations, but usually more committed to a fight. it can be the answer to a shortage of skillpoints and experience.
---
thank u/t_sky
---
Distract the player. He's already mining on at least three characters, having a real-life distraction available can keep him from pulling drones and docking up.
---
&gt;if enough people do it
---
So, a grouping of smaller entities banding together to hold off a larger one? Great idea. We could call them 'allies'. Or 'alliances'.

AAR: A friend of INIT (disgruntled NC. member) gets an alt into the Panfam moveop and takes a squad command position. Upon Titans undocking the P3EN Keepstar, insta warps them off to a safe right in front. We tackle and drop dreads. GF.

I promise you most of the idiots jumping half a dozen supers on roaming gangs wouldn't be doing it if competent groups could get a small dread fleet there in 5-10 mins.
---
You joke but an alliance can mean 100 toons - the banding together in this context - or 30 thousand, so perhaps the terminology is ineffective.
---
:bigthink: 
---
:O
---
Goons are  going to have to after this campaign is over! Their going to realise (or prob all ready do)  that no one is going to fight them ever again! its all well and good having more titans that everyone one else, but not being able to fully use them is going to get real boring for line members, i have no idea (beyond shit posting and propaganda) how any goon line member could have fun bashing undefended structures. it would be funny bashing a few structures but after that i just wouldn't turn up
---
Plenty....
---
Its not EVE. Its us.  
---
We get stuck in these ruts where we end up dping only what is "safe" and we hate it. Then we think "I should stop this and do something else".
---
So we do, just to realize that it sucks, that we really don't want adventure and excitement and struggle. We want COMFORT and what we had been doing was comfortable, reliable and easy.
---
So back we to to our routine (in my case, after months of spending money, extracting and injecting skills, hoping corps and 'trying new things'). 
---
Its not the games fault, every single thing we dont like about eve, from blue donuts to war decs to super cap umbrellas, is actaully a problem with PEOPLE. Every twist ccp has tried has resultwd in the same outcomes because no game can overcome the shittier parts of human nature.
---
New?

Started same year. Coudn't care less if it's dying or not - what could be more fun than to live through an end of the world?.. 
---
(that was before they shut down Tabula Rasa and I had actually saw how a game dies for the first time)
---
However, EvE also taught me how good it is to be paranoid and suspect everyone - and I mean EVERYONE (insert Leon video-quote) - is after you or your stuff. Helped me soooo much in EvE and also so many other games or even real life situations. Viva la paranoia! XD
---
&gt;Might contact my lawyer to see what legal action I can take
---
Oh fuck you should totally do this. Like right now. You need to make sure the evidence doesn't get stale or cold. Call them right now and get a case going.
---
Save all your screenshots, emails, logs, anything you have and send them to your lawyer. Literally right now.
---
Keep us updated because this is seriously some major big stuff happening and has the hugely potential to blow up into a proper scandal.
---
Only wen i have my glasses on
---
It was not sarcastic so thanks for letting me know. But now I'm truly surprised since CCP is not exactly stellar in promoting their game and its strengths,so this kind of work I automatically assumed it was done by players.
---
I can use one until 23/06 atm.
---
Before you commit, and join any group, you might want to join Spectre Fleet's campaign against Proviblock. From what I know, they don't use hard assets against them, it's just harassing campaign.

Reset your coalitions, delete renter landlords, and leave your megablobs. It's not hard. The playerbase has decided to trade content for safety in numbers and super umbrellas. You could easily have massive, sprawling grids of independent groups holding their little patch of space but the blobs prefer to consistently crush them and rent it out.
---
That's it. That's literally all you have to do. Complain all you want about game mechanics, timezone tanking, whatever. None of that matters as much as the fact that you cannot realistically play this game unless you have 200+ friends because that's what the most powerful groups have.
---
Go ahead and downvote. Won't change facts.
---
honestly,  NC and PL are used to migrant fleets. so space is easy to evacuate
---
now if goons hits Geminate,  Horde isn't likely to run, but at the same time, its short term fun for Goons.   they'd win, and get some fights. as horde isn't likely to run.
---
but if horde collapses,  we face a real chinese server possibility.
---
so doubt goons will do more than raid gemi.

I might be dumb, but please ELI5 what you not being on the ballot is constitutes *abuse* from CCP?

Dismissive? Neglectful? I could see that being a possibility, but how in hell's name is it abusive?

And this kids is why you always flag exempt in a super/tit before undocking.
---
I meant T2, must‚Äôve fat fingered
---
He didn't invite them to fleet, they were already in it, but from what I have heard yes, he took squadboss and warped them off.
---
I mean, i wasn't aware of a link between the Thukkers and Caldari at all.

Like, they've never had any contact.

Lol a month old screencap of idiots dying in Delve (which as we all know never happens, ever). I guess that makes up for the massive ncpl humiliation and dead keepstars. Whatever helps you cope bro

Still true today.

They are both ultra capitalist, and the Practical faction of the Caldari megacorps are just as sleazy in their "endeavors". 
---
We're there ever to be a Caldari/Minmatar bromance, this would be it.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the dread spawn avengers and cause the shaks to eat shit?
---
i dont get why it's stressful if they don't undock for either
---
"The best way to find a spy is to let the infrastructure do it's job"
---
Yes, there was.  PL always had *more* titans.  And if you had more than one titan in your alliance, PL was there to poach them from you.
---
It's not ALWAYS about minmaxing the isk.
---
Sometimes it's about having a variety and interesting things to do.
---
1 year in the making? Also, I enjoyed the vid where the strong independent alliance begged for goon help.
---
Question, can I be upset if we've still killed more supers/titans than goons this war?
---
the literal alliance bill every alliance has to pay back when they owned most of the south
---
So then maybe people.should have a spine and say I'm good where I am. No thanks. Instead of hopping on the next dick swinging recruiting them.  HAVE A SPINE people. Don't be one of those "I just wanna use my super" dudes. Selling out to anyone asking.
---
Can I follow PH carriers too?
---
But behold they leave the HED pipe, you can get nice fights with them. Or kill them for shiny loot.
---
They are respectable anyway for withstanding the blobs for so long.
---
Jesus suffering fuck!  He has serious delusions of adequacy.
---
Whoosh

It's stressful on their keyboards if they undock. They're being really considerate to their members RSI concerns and hardware providers.

The plural of Erebus would be 'Erebuses'.
---
As a rule of thumb, in English, words derived from Latin are the ones that commonly follow the 'us' to 'i' pluralization. For example, the plural of focus is foci, the plural of fungus is fungi.
---
However, since English is totally a language that makes sense, the exceptions are numerous. For example, the plural of campus would be campuses, the plural of callous would be callouses, even though those are Latin words. Furthermore, English has the habit of using Latin pluralization on certain Greek words, completely randomly. For example, the greek word octopus is pluralized as octopuses or octopodes, however the greek word colossus is pluralized as colossi.
---
TL:DR nothing makes sense in English, just use the 'us' to 'uses' pluralization if you're not 100% certain you should be using the 'i' ending. People will know what you're talking about anyway.
---
Well if you can't do anything outside of what you are told that's your problem. I'm a happy goon who also enjoys looking for his own content and activities. This is a sandbox, do what you want.

I want to believe this is someone trying to make fun of TEST and not an actual TEST member proud of being a slave.
---
Wormbro never died, just waiting to resurrect the low-class caliphate.
---
B-R was 5 over 5 years ago and it had hundreds of Titans. What changed is that now, even whelping an entire Titan fleet won‚Äôt end an alliance, so they could afford to throw them against each other, intentionally, for the first time.
---
Most semi-stablished corps in LS that could attempt to hold sov don't want to, in fact, most people living in LS do so because they don't wanna deal with sov at all.
---
Insh‚Äôallah
---
Newish player here, could this be mitigated by applying the same mechanic of T3C to capitals? Or maybe only to titans? And maybe this could incentivise players to fight for a different resource, say something like, diminishing the ability of the opponent to drop caps, or drain their wallets from the injectors they have to buy in order to keep up with the arms race. And if this could be implemented, there could be space for the relevancy to attack the minners and raters in order to hurt an empire, pair this with the long awaited nerfs to anomaly spawning in 0.0, and hopefully some nerfs to the application of caps to sub caps, and maybe, just maybe you could boost the content a bit, also, citadel bashing being more... ¬ødidactic? or something.
---
Please shine some light in this not so experienced player.
---
As much as I don't like having NIP with Goons, they are quite good neighbors. I don't know of any serious diplo incidents that would infringe that pact. Imperium entities often roam into our space, we sometimes hunt down their Rorqs. It's quite "humane" way of not letting content die out or go sour.
---
Besides what would be their goal? To have more space? They currently have more than they need. There is very little incentive to take each other's space. 
---
Fighting just for sake of content could be solved in other ways, that doesn't involve 10+ hours of 10% tidi that crucial timer battles often are.
---
And if it would happen, this would be fight between 2 largest powers currently in EVE. Difference in power wouldn't be a big as during their current campaign. Test's shield fleet has great defensive potential.
---
Fuck Snuff

Yeah i gotta go with not listening to 1h25m of some lowlife alliance here, someone tldr this shit.

I'm not a slave retard just because we can make friends and you can't doesn't mean you need to emit salt

They aren't any more or less capitalist than Gallente or Matari.

And that doesn't mean they have any allegiances, like wtf you are just retconning a shitload of Lore at that point.

Glad to hear, it was fun to make :D

Also holy shit can whoever this SMA guy is please hold his key down so he doesn't just cut out every other word? Please and thank you.
---
Listening to this I feel a solid mixture of "I understand why you're doing what you're doing to try and build something" but also "that thing you're building is bad, stop it. get some help."
---
Flair baiting. It's sad that some people are more focused on making shit posts on Reddit, than creating content in game. Almost like entire alliance choose to dock up, deny their enemy content, and instead deploy to Reddit.
---
Instead of making a new thread every time you have a basic question, why not use google?
---
You cant blame 3 people for content creation if the other 7 like to orbit a rock while singing ‚ÄúKumbaya‚Äù, but ok.
---
&gt; I promise you most of the idiots jumping half a dozen supers on roaming gangs wouldn't be doing it if competent groups could get a small dread fleet there in 5-10 mins. Before fatigue there was always a bigger fisher, now the biggest fish is just whoever lives there.
---
I believe it. Problem for my group isn't SP or balls to do it. We live in a c2-ns-c5 so no dropping dreads for us unless we seed them in null. Maybe, we'll see.
---
&gt; I agree but your attribution of this problem to fatigue makes no sense. If jump fatigue helped medium sized groups then why is the game still in the same or worse position as far as blobbing up goes?
---
I may be wrong/misinformed. I was under the impression fatigue was reduced quite significantly since it was introduced? Hence I was making a correlation between that and lack of new groups trying things. I think it's fair to say there are many variables contributing to the stagnation in nullsec outside of my blame of fatigue (where it be right or wrong). 
---
Either way, we need smaller groups in nullsec that aren't aligned, and aren't immediately glassed as soon as they try and set something up. I remember back in the day alliances that didn't really deserve space were kept there because at least they gave content / were fun to farm. Now someone tries to setup space in bumfuck no where and someone is going to shut them down even though they may try setting up in area of space that no one is using.
---
I don't know what the solutions are, I've certainly read some interesting proposals from some of the CSM candidates (unfortunately CCP won't listen, care, or even consider them). Something needs to change.
---
Regardless, I am having some fun with my friends in Furnace Redux but I think it's more of a testament to community and a lack of comparable games to EVE to play, than EVE itself being fun.
---
Stay mad about people trashing your peasant sovnull gameplay lmao

You did it to yourselves.....
---
Line-of-sight mechanic. Cant get a clear line to the target? Guns dont fire, or worse, hit whatever is in front of them anyway
---
One rule for one, another for everyone else. Didn't you know all wormhole groups have to fight MCAV on MCAVs terms because otherwise it's unfair. And if MCAV do happen to lose, you are required to go for round two with them or else you are quite clearly dirty carebears that never undock or fight them. Ergo your group clearly need to "git gud" and "Kill urselfsies"
---
So the classic *it was ace amazinballs when we did it but totally bullshit now we're on the receiving end*

&gt;Another Titan had flag exempt, so I kicked him from fleet, re invited him and fleet warped him too.

---
That meta was super popular in 2013, I can tell you for a fact
---
Me and my friend played for the first time today and started in different systems.  How do we meet up in game so we can play together?  Should we be trying to meet up at all at first while we do the beginning stuff and figure out our respective focuses?
---
Thats due to the state enforced homosexuality
---
Yeah, often people are too scared of/ignorant of thrill of PvP. As much as I would like more people to engage in it, there are simply people that would rather munch rocks, then go on corp roam. You can provide them with free ships/ very good SRP, but they would still enjoy PvE more. Sadly, there is little we can do about it. We can only encourage them to participate in it, and made it affordable for begginers.

He‚Äôs delusional, get him out of here

I still haven't forgotten the time they made us agree on a 10v10 in AF/t3d because "too few online for a brawl", and they brought twice of that, 2 minutes into the fight, anyway. Hypocritical to say the least

Its less about you doing thoae dreads, just the the credible threat that a potential batphone would be mechanically capable of this used to make many second guess.
---

Hence I was making a correlation between that and lack of new groups trying things. I think it's fair to say there are many variables contributing to the stagnation in nullsec outside of my blame of fatigue (where it be right or wrong).
---
Ah I see what you meant. There wasn't an actual reduction in fatigue, just a small increase in range (5ly flat vs 6/7 ly for caps/supers) and fatigue can only accumulate up to 5hrs now. The practical effect of this is that before you'd need an extremely good reason to go more than 2 jumps, whereas now you can go 3 to a fight, jump out, then do the 2 remaining jumps back home later that day or tomorrow. Compare this to before where a carrier with 14.3 ly range could go from Deklein to Delve with 4 jumps in a minute and a half, be there fpr 5 minutes, then jump the 4 jumps home again and you can probably appreciate its not quite the same thing.
---
I agree with your point I'm just touchy abour people misattributing blame because it means the real culprits go unaddressed.
---
I'm quite sure everything dies, if you hit it hard enough. 
---
Add more DPS, or prolong timeframe of their vulnerability.

 I despise test as much as the next guy but I‚Äôll take a decently made super kill video over some smoothbrain thinking they know how to save eve vOv

How is playing the game for a longer period of time a crutch?
---
You are an incompetent, self-centred piece of shit with a fundamental misunderstanding of how the game works. You are unfit to run for CSM; I'm glad you never got put on the ballot paper.

Don't you just hate it when you give a beautiful SOTA speech and then lose another 3 systems that very night?

Now losing titans to match the structures being helped in the trillions of isk. Avatar few days ago and 2 Erebus today.

Nothing quite like leaving fleetwarp on in a moveop.
---
Late to this thread, but I'm a new player subbing for the second time for the sole purpose of getting into PvP.
---
In other MMO's, a motivated new player can look up guides on how to grind their way to their desired playstyle in a matter of weeks, if not days. Without skill trading in EVE, new players would simply be damned to "come back later!" if they want to try flying solo.
---
 
---
If I had to wait several months just to get the core skills required to stand a chance(hell, look at the training time for the "magic 14"), I wouldn't have subbed. Call me pay-to-win if you want, but I'd rather work an hour at my day job for 3B isk / ~1.5M SP than burning myself out either krabbing or staying logged off to get my skills trained.
---
Write it yourself, faggot.
---
I would double it. There is clearly a potential in it.
---
They are absolute free market capitalists. They deal with anybody. Thukker and the Practicals like SuVee and Nugo were made for shady deals with each other. Read more.
---
It was kinda ironic that the 2nd titan killed an init fc and then got top damaged by another init fc
---
ualx was a meaningless clusterfuck that only happened because one or two unqualified idiots wanted to swing their big dick egos around some command channels and drag everyone to hell with them.
---
all it accomplished was showing how broken the game is at this point and essentially ruined any chance of a monster fight happened again because of lag, tidi, and citadel mechanics. 
---
nothing was really accomplished on either side besides some cringey reddit posting and chest beating over a single keep star killmail and a bunch of crashed supers/caps getting fragged after the fact.  i dont think it really changed a damn thing, just made existing issues more visible to the masses.
---
Playing ‚â† subbing

Nitpick your nose, Shitdick.
---
he prolly means go kill the site with leshak and then spawn the drifter aliged out and then warp. Then the dread goes and kills it while the leshaks start doing the next site.
---
AMEN
---
For just 1 titan? Misuse of an asset.
---
Aww shit here we go again
---
Please do
---
lmfao...i guess content is one word for it.
---
hahahwhoooooosh
---
do minmatar next
---
So people who spend a longer period of time subbed or playing have a crutch, that makes sense.
---
Shoot the MTUs for a bonus!
---
Good God...the very first thing I do when I put my titan or super in a fleet is mark them exempt from fleet warp. Best lessons are learned the hard way, I guess.
---
Can confirm.
---
Wathc your mowth
---
When we see PH fleet sizes we always take atlest 5 off because we know they are probably blues anyway
---
So would any game that was very similar to EVE but didn't suck.  EVE is a prime example of a great idea with horrible execution.  Hopefully Pearl Abyss will kick the CCP management out very soon.
---
Good response.
---
Your idea is dumb and so are you.
---
Thanks for the quick summary on the jump fatigue, that is insane to me and bad. I am admittedly pretty drastic with what I'd like to see changed. I don't even like Jump Bridges and think those should be removed from the game too. EVE needs to be BIG again, it's way too easy to project power all over. At the same time, I understand  the nullsec argument that "this is our home and we built it up, therefore we should have some advantages to defending it."
---
Fingers crossed Hilmar actually meant what he said when he stated that they would possibly consider major changes that may be too intense rather than sit idly and watch their one hit wonder decay into a slow death.
---
Okay son now that they're shooting you drop bubble and  light the cyno
---
Admittedly it's dumb as fuck, but that's the title and subject of the post you're commenting on my dude.
---
Pardon me for not academically spouting off about the intricacies of ideological economics, in a fucking video game sub, twat.
---
look into small wormhole corps that have a null sec static. There's a few of them I know about and probably a lot that I don't... but that's basically their entire existence.
---

If you have nvidia, you can download "nvidia inspector", which allows you to set maximum frame rates for different programs, including eve.
---
Investment takes time. I invested into Eve over the past 16 years. That's what I'm talking about.
---
Cant tell people they cant have friends, cant force people to not be friends, imagine the backlash ccp will get if they did something to that effect, its a sandbox game remember, as much as i hate the blue donut, its up to the alliances and its leaders to break it up, until then, lowsec is recruiting.
---
I haven't played in 4 years (previously played since 2008) and every one of these threads is like manna from heaven for me. Feels so good.

What‚Äôs the best way to find a small-medium sized corp? I‚Äôm too new to know what I‚Äôm interested in, but I had a lot of trouble finding a corp in my timezone the last time I tried Eve.
---
Also, if I have a character from when the alpha clone system just came out, should I continue on that character or start a new one? I didn‚Äôt have many SP and less than a billion ISK, and I heard alpha clones got a bunch of cool new stuff.

I was trying to keep it casual. Using words normal people understand. YOUR nitpicky bullshit was absolutely unwarranted, troglodyte.
---
Well it depends on how close probes have to be to load grid. Like I hunt down deadspace cargo containers somtimes and they apear on grid at 10kk. So yea it's not perfect with speed but it's still  a hell of a good way to make non standard safe spots.
---

You guys have strat ops?! It's not just sit in a Saber in WD and kill my shuttles when I try to get to Amarr??
---
Odd, I'm scared they'll log off when I see them in chain
---
This. When I carrier rat I blow through sites in \~10 min or so and leave all of the wrecks. I don't even drop MTUs anymore to pick up loot. If a faction spawn happens I'll roll my alt in to loot it, but that's about it. Also PH.
---
If you only gained a million ISK for an hour of work...then yes, you should question it.
---
Well damn. Nice catch.
---
I like the shady trading theme. Have them be industrial vessels. Soe already has the exploration niche covered without going to t2 vessels, so give thukker non-t2 blockade runner type vessels. I like that pirate factions give you advanced ships without having to go t2, give thukker a smuggler type vibe and make their ships look shitty. Think millennium falcon meets a Ford Econoline van. I actually dig this idea a lot. It would hit a role the other pirate factions don't have, almost like a shady version of ORE.
---
Big question: How many sites of salvage was this? When I carrier rat for 2 hours I'll blow through \~12 sites in that time and leave every wreck (doing nothing but Rock Havens and Ring Sanctums).
---
Need it a Spy to get Titan kills.
---
Say a lot about The Initiative. But then again they‚Äôre in the Imperium.
---
Or, you could embrace the PvP that comes to you by having your own trap, a "QRF", if you will.
---
Because nobody else never used spais lmao
---
The best thing is to go out there and just try it. I recommend maybe starting off hunting ratters as that isn't too hard and is some interesting content for people who are new to it.
---
Also join a small group who does what you do already, learn from them, and then go do it on your own!
---
&gt;Perrigren Falls, Oasa, and Insmother were DRF and TRI owned respectively.
---
so xix then
---
What security systems are usually best for ratter hunting? And what ships?(I‚Äôm trained in Gallente and am an Alpha)
---
Imagine typing 2k19 instead of 2019.
---
I don't know what any of those things are, but it looks pretty valuable.
---
Why am I here? I don't even play EVE.
---
My tip is to skill up to covops explos and head down to stain. Sansha sites are fucking great, but it's a bit of a bitch to get there sometimes.
---
No, on TQ, CCP managed to transform humans into bots.
---
I hope that leviathan has battleship launchers instead of capital launchers.... and not a single CSM candidate I saw wants to fix that.
---
Yes, because PL has NEVER used spies to get super kills. They're honorable and above such tactics. /s
---
Really need to get billboard green after the nyx loss eh?
---
We‚Äôd all be better served by a 1v1 titan fight
---
ü§î now if only there was some sort of connection between low security space and sansha space
---
Can i have your stuff?

---
What's the point of a reset if it's just gonna end up the same way?
---
If I roll a wheel of cheese down a hill, it'll end up at the bottom. If I roll the wheel of cheese again, it might bump around differently, but it's still gonna end up at the bottom.
---
So what's your plan to prevent the same end game from taking place?
---
Me too!
---
I am unsure exactly what you are getting at?
---
The video literally shows him pressing the invade button and doing nothing else. Isn‚Äôt this almost exactly what happened.
---
I mean I don't mean to mock dudes, as video content is content  
---
but a 14 minute recording of a 1x grind of a single super w/ coms and no edits, isn't what I would call a decently made super video
---
the same end game will always happen in this game. But likely it would be a different group of people and it would still take another decade
---
What happened? Someone tank the alliance for the lulz?
---
ive been advocating for this/fire up a new server. When ccp decides to address the injector and rorq/excavator. I'll bring my accts back.
---
not a WH corp
---
How many hours did it take to get all that?
---
already got it all, thanks for the 3 tril barra
---
&gt; But likely it would be a different group of people and it would still take another decade
---
Then you're just gonna make this same crybaby post about the new guys. So why don't we skip all that and just accept this result?
---
I only have 50 mil sp and if it was reset I would not see any reason to continue playing.   Im sure that lack of desire would be 10 fold if I had been playing for most of the life of EVE.  Doing what your suggesting would actually kill EVE.
---
Because if we actually decide to reship into some drool on our keyboard shit then there's really no excuse if they have similar numbers
---
Dang! Can i have like 200bil?
---
its not a cry baby post. At the current rate Eve online has been losing 100 Active sub accounts a month for the last 2 year. At the current rate Eve online will be less than 4000 actual player in less than 2 years. from the 60,000 real players it was not even 3 years ago
---
&gt;french connection in pure blind
---
???? was that before they went south and then back i assume? cause their current situation is anything but
---
So wait, are you saying they fight too much even when they lose? How despicable. 
---
Have you suffered a head injury lately ?
---
&gt; At the current rate Eve online will be less than 4000 actual player in less than 2 years. 
---
Good, maybe the game will finally die then.
---
Just nope.  With your plan instead of people injecting skills they would be buying plex to get the skills.  So if you want a true pay to win game and be in the same ‚ÄúEve is broken and not fair to me because of xyz‚Äù keep spewing dumb shit like this.
---
no i mean you're retarded dipshit
---
contrary doing what we are doing now will kill eve in 2 years time. Doing a hard reset will bring thousands of people back who have been asking for this for awhile now. you might want to quit. we might lose a few hundred. but we would gain more than we would lose and the game would be alive again. all you have to do is do basic algebra to see how many players the game has lost in just the past year.
---
I didnt say this was a plan to fix eve it was just a suggestion, albeit one with loopholes. but the point is if we do nothing THE GAME WILL DIE in 2 years.
---
Capitals are almost as boring as they are expensive. 
---
I hate flying anything slower than a cruiser... just bleh...
---
i know i have 22 subbed accounts and im about to drop from the game :/ the game is hemmoraging players right now at an unprecedented rate.
---
I'm pretty sure everyone does this at first... you'll use them eventually.
---
MASSIVE
---
NCPL
---
HUMILIATION
---
A reset wont do, I‚Äôd see no reason to return to it.
---
But CCP should wipe injectors, rorquals and supercaps. Or the means to acquire them. Those 3 things are killing this game.
---
thats literally what a hard reset would do.
---
So it dies.  Yeah it would suck but a reset solves nothing.  It would probably make it worse.  Already folks scream about how uneven it is for new players joining and would probably lose more players that could not afford to pay to get back to decent game play.   
---
If ‚Äúfixing‚Äù Eve was a simple do this CCP would have done it already.
---
in a fleet open to Horde... for fucks sake
---
The point is to bring back life to the game not to kill it. If you dont want to save it why are you playing?
---
&gt;if MCAV lose they want to keep fighting 
---
I guess we can just start staying docked like everyone else if a scary corp or a fleet with a slight slight numbers advantage comes into chain
---
Okay this is incredible looking! The talent of the Eve-Online community always makes me smile.
---
just another night in tosche station
---
Prearranged fights... mcav... ^w^t^f^are^you^on^about?
---
Your day will come.
---
A reset like this would make many current active players quit the game as their years of hard work would vanish into nothingness. Imagine it from the perspective of someone undocking their titan for the first time yesterday.
---
Tight. Thanks a lot!
---
The only way to solve this is to do something drastic and make some drastic changes. They could even make Omega free for an equivalent amount of time that people had as their net value. I believe a fresh sandbox would help vs the one we have. IF nothing else just boot up a fresh server? leave tranquility and start a new server
---
&gt; The point is to bring back life to the game not to kill it.
---
And you think wiping away over a decade of progress will make people suddenly want to keep playing? Yeah, all that time, effort, and money I've invested into the game all gone and there's nothing to show for it. But at least some kid on reddit gets to play EVE fresh from the start!!
---
!remindme 2 years
---
&gt;what we are doing now will kill eve in 2 years time.
---
Good tip. Yes, skill up and come.  Stain is safe for TEST to farm in.
---
you can have my systems
---
not some kid on reddit. Everyone would. The other thing that could happen is they just boot up a new server. They have infrastructure in place to handle a game 4x the size of the current one because there used to be over 4 times the amount of players. everyone gets to keep their stuff. the tens of thousands of players who have been waiting for a reason to come back would come back.
---
Haha all the spooky explo hunters in stain get excited when I mention that. Sure, you'll lose ships. I'm in a TZ when stain is pretty empty, so it never bothered me. Lost one ship there ever iirc.
---
Relying on superior sp was a crutch, yes. Lots of folks can admit they won a fight because of SP imbalance, PL and NC acted as if it was because of skill.
---
Nah, a hard reset would be to start all over. What game needs is:
---
1- much easier to kill rorqs, and they should mine at least 40% less.  Somehow limit number of rorqs per system
---
2- increase the material cost of supercaps, remove massive warp point per lvl shit and nerf fighters even further against subcaps.
---
3- nerf injectors or wipe them out 
---
4- increase the cyno cost and maybe even return the jump timers to old lvls.
---
CCP needs to stop trying to cater to vets retention, and start thinking on new player retention, the alphas you want to convince to omega but are afraid to do so if they see the only fucking solution to to actually be someone on this game is have 20 rorq alts that can feed your EVE addiction.
---
i can imagine that perspective as i just finished and undocked my titan for the first time today. I had the realization that i wont get to use it for anything meaningful.
---
Stop infinite anomaly spawn maybe would fix the problem. Force people to spread out more evenly.
---

Winning is winning. Whether its by an inch or a mile.
---
Check losses of said large alliances.
---
but everyone would be on equal footing. everyone would have to climb the ranks togeather. sov warfare would be freaking trashers and condors and maybe that as the game would be a baby and no infrastructure or minerals would be in place. there would be no injectors to lol inject themselves. there would be no endless titans to stop people. I know its drastic, but doing nothing just kills the game anyway
---
Eve isn't a good enough game to survive a reset.
---
It only hurts if you care.
---
Join a wormhole corporation with a decent small gang kb activity or some 'excavator' booshing group.
---
Using spies to fleet warp titans is just about the most Eve thing you can do.
---
&gt;the tens of thousands of players who have been waiting for a reason to come back would come back.
---
[Citation needed]
---
Just a flat reset isn't enough, I think. I think it's better for CCP to rebuild the game from the ground up, eliminating all the legacy code.
---
TBPH, "reset the server and send everyone back to square one" is going to alienate more players than it brings in. A better option is to start a new server with a full reset and new tech under the hood, then migrate the hardware over as players do. Offer, say, 80% of your SP if you transfer your character. That way people don't lose years of work but also don't just create the exact same situation we would have before any reset.
---
Youre retarded
---
It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.
---
If EVE ends up stagnant again 15 years after a reset then that's a win for the community, because the community got another 15 years of dynamic and engaging play. Then the server can be reset and we can get another 15 years.
---
Sure, stagnancy is inevitable. But until that inevitable end comes, we'll have fun.
---
I imagine that made him feel a lot better about losing his titan.
---
Even starting a new server would do the trick
---
This would be really awesome as a feature built into eve. 
---
I also have both a single high refresh 165hz monitor and 2x 60hz. 
---
All my clients perform worse now because the one on the centre screen is going to run at 165fps even with v-sync on and eats up GPU cycles. 
---
It‚Äôs a g-sync panel and if I could limit the game FPS it would adapt the refresh rate and give me a smooth experience at 60fps.
---
Oh......

[My advice on how to find a corp.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/awzb03/casual_player_here_been_trying_small_corps_but/ehq97k5/) If you want help tell us your TZ, space you want to fly in, etc.
---
I would go with whatever character you like the most. SP is a factor, but you can make up SP pretty quickly. YOu can transfer all the isk and assets to a new character pretty easily.
---
I'll note that the last three are not a real issue. You don't have to know how in order to have fun doing. From my perspective, knowing what you're doing is actually detrimental to fun more than the opposite.
---
One of you click the symbol next to your navigation and set Destination to the others system (top left of screen). Don't bother taking anything. Just start doing NPC missions or whatever you're doing in the new location.
---
A better solution will be starting a completely new server rather than resetting the tq. People who want a fresh start can start playing there.
---
This is often the viewpoint and desire spoken from one that hasn't earned their way to the top and does not desire or see a point in working to get to the top but would rather have everyone brought to their level.
---
this is the viewpoint of someone who just hit 1trillion net worth 4 hours ago
---
What corp was the awoxer in?
---
Welcome to Eve!
---
So what you want to do is type their character's name in any chat channel. Highlight their name, right click, go down to auto link and select "character". You may have to specify from a selection of characters if they share names with others. Once you succeed their name should be yellow with an underline.
---
Next, right click their name and select "start conversation". You then need to type something. They will get a conversation request. have them accept.
---
To meet up you can drag and drop your system name in to chat. They can right click on it and select "Set destination". This will give them a route to you. If you don't want to go through lowsec, then you want then to click on the "A" next to their path and select "prefer safer". Then they can follow the yellow gates to you. From there you two should be in the same system.
---
Buy a few thousand ships. Hand them out to people to go on fleets. Weeks of fun to be had.
---
Have fun playing with yourself.
---
and yet it does nothing to bring people back to the game
---
[Put in your info and hit play](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/range). Dotlan has lots of cool tools in the Navigation tab for jump capable ships. Learn to use them!
---
,,,and Wormhole, accessible from many High Sec systems.
---
What stops the current entities from just reforming after the sandbox has been reset? Other than that no one will have a huge industrial lead, etc.?
---
Others that do not care about becoming spodbrains or something else will not all of a sudden adapt that way of playing the game if it doesn't interest them.
---
v0lta and any of the other thera boys
---
a great question! Aside from current friendships in corps, and alliances, Most of them have no real reason to stay togeather. The current alliances were formed out of need for territory and safety. groups like TEST and BVRAVE and HORDE would likely stay even Goons would stay but a large part of the imperium would go off to do other stuff. Because most of the imperium is there because its the the safest.
---
read comment, it's a stupid uninformed opinion, go to reply
---
oh wait it's seraph
---
that explains a lot
---
you should really post less
---
was an entire video dedicated to fleet warping a couple titans for easy frags really justified
---
this is true
---
Class 5. There are 6 different tiers of wormholes with higher class having more dangerous NPCs but better rewards.
---
IIRC Only class 1-3 will connect directly to known space (k-space), to get to a higher class like 5 requires finding a wormhole in a wormhole system.
---
i agreee whole heartedly. eventually everyone from the old server would trickle to the new server anyway
---
Holy fuck is it possible to find more obnoxious music..
---
world of warcraft is starting up vanilla servers and everyone is going ape shit over it. im positive the same effect would be had on eve online
---
Another Safe PL Move Op Spotted, amirite?
---
Thanks for the info about PIRAT.  I didn't know they are an aggressive corp.  Corp members might be looking for a fight in Jita.  I've heard of test but I didn't know that they own Perimeter. I learned something new.
---
northern bait best bait
---
I mean, world of warcraft is starting up vanilla severs and everyones going apeshit for it
---
I've had a theory that any time anyone types "y'all" on the internet they are a retard who is wrong
---
it's working well
---
Oh look,  
---
  
---
it's a daily "Eve is dying" post.
---
Pretty low compared to the be in nc post.
---
I dont want a hard reset. Just a soft reset. 
---
1. Change everyone's Skill points into unallocated skill points. Remove all skills from a pilot's head. Make them repurchase the books and reinject their skill points.
---
2. Liquidate everyone's assets, Liquidate all structures, even Sov stuff. Have their value converted into isk or plex. Structures go to owning corp's Ceo.
---
3. Then remove 50% of all liquid isk/plex value from everyone. Call this a Bot tax.
---
4. Biomass anyone that hasnt logged in for 3+ years.
---
5. Disband all alliances and corps.
---
Send everyone back to their respective starting systems.
---
6. All markets wiped clean.
---
7. All standings and mission statuses reset.
---
Then just let everyone have a mad race back to how they used to be.
---
It would be chaotically fun.
---
There are no new important starter things that I would miss?
---
this would be literally perfect
---
Is it a bait? Majority of GSF players are thinking like that anyway.
---
Im cool with the warp points per level as that is one of the reasons HICs exist.
---
Yeah that makes a lot more sense thanks
---
Blaster Hecate is good in nullsec for solo/smallgang. It‚Äôs very good at running away and can also punch way above its size.
---
more like 15- 20 rounds per minute.
---
unfortunately if you dove in a decade ago you'd have 20x more fun than if you did now
---
the game has gone from 60k players online daily to struggling to get 20, what do you call that?
---
Sigh..I‚Äôve been running DEDs and other sites with random drops for like 5 years and every few months one of these threads appear.
---
RNG is RNG. Due to random nature, you will occasionally get terrible luck over and over.
---
How hard is this to understand lol.
---
Literal "no u"
---
8-3=x is called just called subtraction you pretentious dumbass.
---
Wiping the game will cause 80 % or better of the player base ghost out. So you have research to show not only 20k concurrent players will come back to march that but more?
---
I mean World of Warcraft is starting Vanilla servers and eveyrone is going ape shit for it. So maybe a wipe isnt the answer, but booting up a fresh server is.
---
That and make the reward Lp based instead of raw isk.
---
Your alliance ran like a bitch after a single cap fight against us. Your supers and titans bitched out of the fight and the war after. Your alliance left its teammates to their fate. You were so much of a bitch that you tried to *petition* your ships out of system lmao CCP even made a blog post about it.
---
Sure go ahead and point the finger at us but you did lose a lot more than some ships that day.
---
&gt; the game has gone from 60k players online daily to struggling to get 20, what do you call that?  
---
It's a good result for a game that is 16 years old.
---
So youw ant the game to die is what you are saying?
---
We have a shitload of issues in the game atm, and not having some thukker tribe ships (apart from the minnie tech 2) isnt one.
---
no, not in this context
---
let me elaborate: typical init posters are pretty cringy, rife with koolaid and a complete lack of the self awareness and irony typical of better posting in /r/eve
---
but even compared to such init posting greats as malcanis, you're really over the top. it's like you have an insulin pump feeding koolaid directly to your bloodstream 24/7 or something, and you're just dim enough that you don't realize the only people upvoting you are hapless bees and other init posters, because your posting isn't good, it just tries really hard to make init look good
---
this isn't in reference to the specific comment I replied to. I read all of your comments in this thread, and I realized I have come to know your brand of badposting by your name, and thought you ought to know. this was just the comment I saw last
---
ease up on the koolaid my guy
---
Just doing PI. Where are my launched goods? What do the "%" mean on the links?
---
For highsec, should I make T2? and also can I just link them all together without a storage facility? And why is my output so small if it says 300k in 22h? Thank you
---
Can't trust awoxers.
---
1. Use DOTLAN.
---
2. You want to use a combination of NPC Kills &amp; NPC Delta. Kills will tell you overall how many NPC have been killed since last ESI check. Delta will tell you the +/- since the last check - http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Vale_of_the_Silent#npc_delta
---
3. Use an interceptor to scout, and find the ratters in anoms
---
4. Have a gang of AF's like a Retribution/Jag/Wolf/Enyo/Hawk be your wolf pack and take down the ratters when you catch them.
---
Seeing as your an Alpha, you could probably still do okay with something like an Algos, or a Punisher. We have people who solo in Retributions and can take down Vexor Navy's or Ishtar's.
---
And then... like... roll that one too? idk
---
As a cloaks proteus I picked a relic site in a system one day and just sat there.  I caught a few herons and a couple asteros.  I‚Äôd say that was a pretty unlucky one.
---
&gt;	and I know having scouts on ingoing wholes is the absolutte best
---
Uh, no. Rolling off all connections is the absolute best.
---
Just limit all corps to 50 people and alliances.to 500
---
You really want to compare instant gratification theme park mmo to EVE? Ok then..
---
Wall of text when you could just understand that I literally meant: you could stop posting as well. Nice self troll there brosky.
---
Welcome to the game! The eve university wiki is a huge help for learning the game, and joining up with a nice corporation usually fills in the cracks.
---
I may be biased here, but I would advise looking into a nice faction warfare corporation, specifically in the amarr/minmatar warzone. It'll help you learn small-scale pvp and get a good amount of starter isk.
---
I found it

Go loser another titan to people that unironically live in Outer Ring
---
&gt; Say what you will about us but you lost a lot more than ships that day
---
Yea, because we (we being used in the past tense since i left PL last year) totally haven't ever  lost a fight before right?  Not like B-R, not like VFK's famous siege, not like Y-2, or the other Y-2, not like when we got steam rolled out of Fountain right?
---
You're trying to battle shame the group thats lost the most titans in the games history, including over 30 in one fight.  It doesn't work like that bud.
---
For you that fight meant something, for anybody in PL it was just another one of "Those" days.  Just because you haven't been playing long enough to be around when those days pop up doesn't make them any more important than they are.
---
I keep trying to tell you its all in you head but I'm not convinced you're an idiot and it might not be possible to make sense to you.
---
How did I miss this? This is amazing.
---
No one has ever been good at eve. there's only varying degrees of sucking
---
this was an amazing video primo beeno shit 
---
and also this is eve litteraly becoming serenity 2019
---
Sure, "look at him he cares", is the exact amount and type of qualification I look for when I'm seeking a fry cook to design a bridge, or treat my cancer.
---
Just because you have a thought doesn't make it a good one.
---
A lesson your parents should have taught you, and applies here, is that sparkles didn't go to live at a farm upstate.  Sparkles died, everything dies in its time, dogs dont live to be 27.
---
whom'st've'ist is this absolute lad
---
Not V0lta
---
We're trash
---
the fact that it's been 3 years since that happened and you still can't come up with a better comeback than that is hilarious to me
---
go post another threadnought about how plated maledictions are the best fast tackle ships in eve online
---
i know i could. but i won't. it takes one to know one, and i thought you deserved an honest critique
---
or you could be flippant about it
---
But capitals aren't expensive anymore
---
praise be upon him
---
Had you not skipped math at school, you'd know that if x is half of y then y is double of x
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Not to mention comparing one thats had tens of millions of players over its life and over 5 million subs at current, with one that has had at best a few hundred thousand over its life.
---
I‚Äôm sure the new overlords that purchased CCP would just love having years of people not paying their subscriptions
---
I remember that guy during the "Burn Jita" Event. He was all over the Rookie Help chat ingame wity his weird conspiracy theories about goons and everything.
---
How is joining the largest coalition in the game earning their way lol wtf
---
Everyone would be on equal footing ......... until someone joins a week later ....... 6 months later after the reset.   So then what reset the server every week?  In every game there will be people who have played longer and have more assets.  Get over it.  Eve like life is not fair.
---
I like eve plus how long have been saying eve is dying I agree I think somethings need work but I have fun
---
the true irony of this, is the fact that this is litteraly what happens for around 60% of the playerbase of eve and 70% of the population in nullsec. This legitamitely happens. all the time.
---
thank fucking god I left nullsec
---
I dont understand why CCP wont mix this up so this shit stops. Can you imagine being a new player and this is the way you play eve? How the hell does anyone join TEST or Goons and think that is a fun game to play at all???
---
Everyone has lost fights, that's not what matters. What matters is how you act before and after a fight. You spent a good while chestbeating about coming south and evicting us, only to lose a single battle and run back home. That's the real shame here. If you're such an experienced and battle hardened group why didn't you keep throwing titans and supers at us after escaping ualx? Why'd you lose all the provi forts? 
---
I'm referring to you as PL, because you seem to be a professional PL apologist.
---
To not completely shit games.
---
Honestly who gives a fuck? 
---
This is the most boring war eve has seen. Yes even worse than watching gotg and goons moral post via reddit for 6 months.
---
This yes this reset the sov map
---
You could try posting less.
---
or if you don't know just use "more than 1 Erebus titan" lol
---
I did not want my Grandmom to die,  
---
but I was not surprised when she passed away.
---
We joined when it was 250 people the whole of INIT vs. The entire north in syndicate. Sorry, not sorry, if we get to enjoy the tables turning.
---
biomass
---
they dropped supers on everything when it was a big fight. not gangs or roams. they tagged on escalations and third partied. thats completley different. you should be afraid of a hammer dropping on your ass when you take a super to ruin some duders night in t1 cruisers.
---
[https://sov.space](https://sov.space)
---
I think it would be more tolerable if they gave you skins and stuff on the new server based on the amount of SP you had. Maybe like a fort or refineries idk. 
---
Maybe have accelerated skill training for the first month for each day you log in as well. 
---
And/or you get to keep a certain number of SP (maybe 5m?) which could make you a big player in the new economy. 
---
I have about 500m sp across my characters and I would love a server reset. The main problem is it wouldn‚Äôt really change the donut situation. The big alliances would still have their out of game infrastructure to rebuild on the new server.
---
Watched them duke it out with novac with an armor fleet, FAX, and nid on each side. Think they ultimately lost but they looked like they can put up a goos fight.
---
Killing the top percentage of the player base might be worth bringing in thousands of new paying players.
---
15 rounds/minute, 500 rounds = 33 minutes  
---
20 rounds/minute, 500 rounds = 25 minutes
---
So like, half an hour of continuous fire?
---
why would you, just use cruise's rather then the shity rapid torps
---
&gt;I have about 500m sp across my characters and I would love a server reset.
---
You can start by resetting your characters. Give me your sp. Start a revolution. It makes so much sense, I don't know why you haven't reset already!
---
Contract all your stuff to Killdozer.  
---
I'll find the cool ways to use it.
---
law of large numbers?
---
Bot Aspirant behavior if you will.
---
Fenrir was thukker based.
---
No?
---
Two years!? Don't be crazy. I'm giving it 5 minutes. Tops. Eve is going down tonight!
---
Give or take. Depends on skills implants and abysall radiation sinks. 
---
Lower rate of fire. Higher ammo use. Base rate is 8 seconds. The above mentioned factors can bring it down to 3 secomds and less with absurd bling. And a officer implant.
---
Assuming every site yields about 7 mil salvage.
---
And takes about 4 mins to clear in a noctis (pre collected by mtu)
---
1300/7 = ~186 havens
---
186x4= 744 minutes
---
So about 12.4 hours of salvaging, which I did in a bit over a week since I have alot of free time nowadays.
---
The main limiting factor is that you have to be on a very supportive corp/alliance that supplies you with enough sites.
---
What do you do now?
---
*i know i could.* but i won't. you're really dense, you know?
---
Nope, wrong again. I say eve has been listening 30,000 players a minute and that's why we're down from our high of 40 million players just yesterday.
---
It's all true because I said it on the internet.
---
You know what bud I have the game for you. Its called POE. You can get all your stuff reset every three months and start from scratch. Have fun over there. It sounds like what you're looking for.
---
Who died and made you king? I'll have you know hundreds of thousands of players have been telling me personally that only I represent their voice and they all say no reset.
---
Since hundreds of thousands beat your ten thousand claim, I think we all know who's won this round. 
---
You're welcome.
---
Yeah that, and crater rim habitations.
---
&gt;im positive the same effect would be had on eve online
---
Yes I'm sure those words will be great solace to every developer who loses their job after following your smooth brained advice.
---
there's a difference between rolling back a decade of mechanics, and wiping out a decade of assets.
---
the two are completely different.
---
I admire your enthusiasm buddy but in this game, you'll eventually get fucking blobbed to shit.  Welcome to Eve in 2019.
---
that's the exact same thing... and if eve isn't good enough to survive a reset it sure as shit isn't good enough to survive a reset AND split.
---
Blood raider nullsec, south of amarr :P
---
Always assume Hordelings are awox/spies... or you get this.
---
When the fuck were there 60k players in the last 4 years?
---
Take a look at the actual statistics you moron:
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
There were never that many people online on average.
---
In game development you don‚Äôt do bans immediately for bots. You wait to see the patterns that emerge for specific bots / scripts so you can be reasonably certain you‚Äôre banning a large % of them at once. This has an added effect of masking what part of the bot you‚Äôre detecting
---
Please don't try to help op understand his stupidity.
---
couldn't help it:  [https://imgur.com/a/Bth7BuJ](https://imgur.com/a/Bth7BuJ)
---
Meh, I haven't looked much into the back lore on the ships. I just like the idea of a line of entry level "smuggler ships", something faction rather than t2. More accessible, like how the astero is more accessible than covops explo frigates.
---
I‚Äôd probably go Algos then since I got good drone skills
---
Currently my preferred PvP fit is a neut Tristan
---
Around 186 blood raider rock havens not including loot (did the math in another comment)
---
Good post
---
And noone will fight you anymore. Sounds boring to me.

Playing with undefended structure bashes as only PvP...

lol wut?

I disagree. Explaining why ideas are stupid prevents the same people from making more stupid ideas.

Education is king.

Congratulations.
---
No, those things are all human nature. You can not stop people from grouping together for safety. CCP needs to introduce mechanics that convince people to spread out. As it is, the game makes it too easy for people to coalesce in to mega corps and alliances. You cannot expect people to not group together for safety when CCP makes it so easy to do so.
---
I played in Krypted Gaming‚Äôs rust group for a bit. If they run eve like they do rust, it should be a fun time with good people.
---
Move to wormholes to find the reason why people still play this game.
---
Volta would be possibly the most skilled group in W-space
---
amazing what webs do to a super  
---
Also there is a module called a Scram, and you only need 13 to reach the scram strength
---
100% nail on the head. I agree with every point here. Especially the one about nullification. Nullification just adds an easy travel mode for lazy people. Even without nullification an interceptor is practically impossible to catch if flown properly.
---
a bil in salvage will fit in the cargo bay of an astero, with room to spare.
---
you are a complete idiot.
---
Everyone is risk averse unless their prefrontal cortex is damaged or are gambling addicts.

lmao this is absolutely false

If you can, subscribe your account. For the love of god dont grind for weeks just so you can plex for more grinding.

&gt; Faction ammo is supposed to last for about 5k shots
---
I think it's about 4k shots actually, but I may remember incorrectly.
---
thukker tribe has a ton of ships that are part of the minmatar line
---
thukkers ARE minmatar. its one of the major tribes that helped in the rebellion, especially in the industry capacity of the rebellion during the early stages on the fringes of space. they are not a pirate faction at all.
---
Consult your Doctor
---
From someone who took a short break from EVE to play Atlas (where you have a max of 8 blues):  
---
Please don't.  
---
It's a nightmare, especially if you want to have a lot of small independent groups.  
---
My group was told to merge into a larger group multiple times, because "all blue spots are taken".  
---
People will blue each other all the time and I really prefer if they can do it with in game tools rather than discord and Google spreadsheets.
---
Many years ago I bought 600 rocket skillbooks, so I could shoot them at bad people.
---
So don't feel too bad. At least you won't run out.
---
I'm looking at like 1.5 bil total loot from ~20 DED 5s and 6s.  At least 10 of those were box only or box + worthless specific resist mod.  No EANM or invulns.  No drop over 300m from a single site.  Just seems far worse than normal where I'd average 1 invuln per 10 sites or so.  But someone has to be the outlier.
---
Oh yeah definetly, i'd only consider plexing with isk if I had multiple accounts.
---
&gt;And if MCAV do happen to lose, you are required to go for round two with them or else you are quite clearly dirty carebears that never undock or fight them.
---
I'unno, a group that actually takes losses in stride and wants to go it again instead of krabbing up after every loss seems like a fun bunch of guys that are making EVE better.
---
This checks out as a shitpost.
---
Reminds me of this video where automated weapons are still fighting a war even though mankind is all dead.
---
It's time for a second instance
---
start playing :)
---
Init video, asking goons to do something within the first minute, classic.
---
the game has developed towards pve, and pvpers find fewer and fewer opportunities in the current meta.  it's a pretty boring universe in the ear of tidi fests, tz tanking, citadel spamming, and asset safetying.
---
And thats when you woke up, and realise, the bully is indeed yourself. Social Justice is bs. And sjw asshats are just terrorists. In game, like real life.
---
&gt; might be worth bringing in thousands of new paying players.
---
[Citation needed] for this claim of "thousands" of new paying players.

World of War craft has had private vanilla servers forever and no one on normal wow is losing anything because of it
---
You think everyone would be going nuts for it if 15 years of collecting and titles and mounts etc were disappearing?
---
&gt;plan ahead for the long haul
---
That's what you use to do , these days you can just join horde or karmafleet or hatever , fly to their space get a free ratting ship and rat in peace.Throw some skill injectors into the mix to be able to max your ratting income faster and done.If shit hits the fan then no prob.Eve as a 'hardcore game' has been gone for quite some time now.
---
Listen guy when your kids are starving you don‚Äôt care about maggots in the flour, you just grind that shit up and make yo bread.
---
Init had to snug about something they‚Äôve been uncharacteristically silent of late.
---
Considering mine is true...yeah. Honest question though, why were you always such a buttblasted retard even back in TISHU? Was it because I had to teach you how to fly and fit ceptors? Or was it something else?
---
It will if you don't run with your main... Its in the csm rules.
---
1000 titans plus we can build them cheap... theres the problem right there...
---
Most people in the gatecamp farmed more in dead caps and HACs than was lost overall. 
---
The isk war on that was pretty solidly in TEST's favor.

Yeah and a max of 8 blues.  
---
That is what Atlas did, stopped nobody from having bigger groups, only with more headaches and small groups of 5-20 players being told to merge or gtfo.
---
And yet this is how everybody in every major alliance plays the game. Doesn‚Äôt matter where you look.
---
Well as a member of old Stainwagon that many members moved to NC or PL i can confirm that line members morale is bad.           
---
Those who joined wanted be the "top dogs" instead of that they fly destroyers(quite often T1) and are running.

Now I know that by being subbed for a longer period of time I have a crutch.

you should really fight more

man...
---
Huh. This is the first time I have heard someone complain that they are getting too many FPS. :D
---
My first thought was V-sync, said before with better advice. Good luck.
---
what narrative are we trying to keep lmao? there is no narrative for losing krabs in Delve who don't realize we are deployed and no one is home
---
Probably not log in.
---
Before the battle both sides were willing to engage in 'monster fights'. After the battle only one side was still willing to engage. How is that not a change?
---
I wonder if Hilmar ever saw this post:
---
Oh look, the reason that guy wants to be on the CSM just to fire me. Nah thanks.
---
Would be nice to have some kind of summary tbh.
---
&gt; . You went down after a single punch to the face. 
---
We lost one battle and lost fountain
---
We lost one battle and stopped an invasion of the north
---
We WON a battle and logged off and lost a war invading VFK and goons, left the war directly after.
---
We lost one battle and left the Halloween war.
---
All the provi forts were lost after one decisive fight where the opponent was obviously superior, almost zero effort was expended after that singular fight.
---
So when I tell you that PL pilots are used to it, I absolutely mean it, there is a string of own followed by a massive fuck up where everything is lost and it all starts over again from there.  Its happened over and over and just because you've personally never seen it doesn't mean it hasn't happened.
---
So when you say they lost something, they didn't, they've lost it all before, they'll lose it all again, its cyclical as fuck and has been through the alliances entire life (most of which i was a part of).
---
Anything you see as being some loss is literally in your own mind, because to you it IS a first, but none of what you think really matters to them, like its ok for you to say that you personally lost respect or fear of them over it, that shroud eventually gets lifted from most players eyes if they play eve long enough.
---
In 2 or 3 years you can watch some other new player celebrate a PL shit stomping as if the world had somehow changed on that day, and you'll be like OOOOooooh thats what he meant.
---
lol
---
I can agree with parts of Infinite local resources and Massive force projection. But other players do not have to cater to your play style.
---
Have you tried to tribe him into it?
---
The funny thing is that when I was in Provi, I managed to convince most of our miners to fit a tank on a Procurer, then we got shield ships, logi included prepared.
---
I can't remember on this occasion if I was in a salvager thrasher cleaning up the belt or my Proc was blown up but Goons dropped on us. I grabbed a scythe as reship, as did some others and we killed bombers.
---
We almost killed some Blops ... and we never saw any Goons again.
---
----
---
I suspect there is one of two problems with your story.
---
* Sometimes a scalpel is better than a hammer.
---
or
---
* Goons are risk adverse cowards.
---
I've been playing Eve since 2012 and you're wrong.
---
Most people who live in W-Space wouldn't count VOLTA. Hell, living in a C2 myself, I wouldn't consider my own corp a true WH corp.
---
"plated maledictions are good fleet tackle ships" -seraph, 2016-
---
nty lol
---
no, but then again i'm not making those posts, and i'm not upvoting them either
---
Personally it would make me quit. Unlike you, I still have goals in progress, I‚Äôve been playing for a few months, plus all my progress will be reset. 
---
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be bothered to go through everything all over again.
---
Well I‚Äôm sure PL asked NC. for a gunner also
---
dpci has been fishing fountain with a significant measure of success and they haven't really done anything but bash structures in the north since goons got here
---
unlike goons i think they think of themselves as actual pvpers and recognize bashing unopposed structures for weeks at a time as the depressing grind it is
---
Just seeing your name again, I understand why is that.
---
You can go fuck yourself btw.
---
The mwd  is not suppose to go offline after jumping it should deactivate.
---
Did you try Provi?
---
Espionage has started some of the best fights ever seen in EVE. We were in direct super range of their current staging and their old one with any friendly support for us 2 mids away. Other than the element of surprise there was a big advantage to Panfam to at least come and tidy us up before we could get any help there.
---
no - lazy people like yourself who can't put a second of effort into the game are killing EVE. Supers can die, Rorquals can die, skill injectors matter nothing when it's only one guy. How about you skill yourself, get some friends, and go drop some rorquals after putting in some effort and I bet all of a sudden you realize your idea is dumb.
---
Ooooh snap dude you back in AIDER?
---
Spoken like a true lazy person who doesn't want to work for anything.
---
Ah, I misinterpreted that, sorry.
---
Travel by Keepstars they said... It‚Äôll be safe they said...
---
True....which is why I didn‚Äôt say blaze of glory.  Just simply a blaze.  Set it all on fire and walk away.
---
If your desire to win is easily replaced with the need to have won you were never a top player to begin with.
---
Well, fucking awesome! Know a few soldiers that need this. 
---
Also, what are the implications for alzheimers?
---
I'm Australian, we spell it as Colour- The proper way. Like *Aluminium*
---
Blood and Fay introduce themselves, discuss how they started playing the game, talk about the goals for the podcast and chat about how to find small scale fights in EVE Online.
---
I submitted a bug report recently (in the last couple of days), after jumping back to k-space from abyssal space.
---
I tried to activate all my mid modules, but received a message saying they were all offline. Tried to connect to a drone I'd previously left behind by accident, and received a message that said I couldn't because I had no drone skills.
---
To make a long story short, re-logging allowed me to connect to my drone, and re-logging again restored the bonuses from my apparently also-offlined rigs.
---
It's not the same problem as your own, but similar enough. I'd suggest submitting a bug report, as I believe I read in recent patch notes that something similar was supposedly fixed already.
---
Same here man, I‚Äôve watched over the years as more and more of my friends pull the plug. 
---
I‚Äôve held out living with some really close friends and roaming buddies in a C2/N but the state of null is just getting increasingly more depressing. We barely play once a week now, partly due to RL and partly due to lack of motivation. Sad really.
---
Would never work. FC doesnt need to see blue to say "dont shoot so-and-so"
---
That happens after you "jump" from a system to another, which is similar to mine.
---
Thanks, now I remember why I wanted to forget thatguy
---
losing sp now wont really change much since any lost sp can be bought back with injectors.
---
Based on my player referral link the citadel expansion brought in a huge amount since I got a couple hundred omega upgrades. And that was just an expansion not a server reset. 
---
The game has gotten more player friendly, so a reset would give people starting a huge advantage over people starting now. 
---
So yea I‚Äôm sure they have the data that says it would be thousands. I‚Äôm not sure how many people at the top pay to play but I sure don‚Äôt. But I would support a reset anyway, at least it would be new and exciting.
---
Careful, you are starting to make too much sense. This sub doesn't like people who make sense around here.
---
I have only seen it when bashing things with oracle, or in one or two small gangs, where we tackled some capital, and took us 30 min to burn down.
---
Its only 80% correct, some of our alts are in WH space
---
That isn‚Äôt a reset. SP isn‚Äôt the issue. It is the assets and isk people are sitting on. Of which I am a tiny percent.
---
Your web handle ... were you only 9 when you started playing EVE?!
---
They were pretty good at it before they settled down. After they won the drone war, I really was hoping that they would go after the next big target. Instead they started a rental empire.
---
But injectors cost money/ISK, so you could disrupt their economy via other means
---
ya dude, you jump your titan in and boson
---
Nature, nurture and environment, they all play a part in shaping what is.
---
yep!
---
You have no idea how they are crying on the SW discord.
---
&gt; **NEW PLAYERS WHO ARE RUNNING** 
---
&gt; I have been playing since 2003 and have countless hours played on this game. I have FCed for many well known alliances such as BoB and other major alliances.
---
Hey! I commissioned this in 2017 and the person I had it done for (secret santa) loves it and has it in their bio! If you're open for commissions again, i'd love to get some more done.
---
not really, 2 gets them out of range. my rorq hits out to 158km with a capital shield booster. however if he is going max yield, im pretty sure you cant fit the capital one, and the larges hit out to 52km. so depending on his fit you can get away with 1 boosher
---
Wow a bit drastic and I am not sure that is the best approach to address some of the issues we are experiencing in our game of Eve online - my opinion.
---
As for you comment regarding flying 40 jumps through low security space in a pod without dieing well I do believe that has always been the case! - my opinion again!
---
I agree.  If you don‚Äôt educate the stupid they stay stupid and breed and raise stupid.  End the cycle of stupid
---
Sorry.  It‚Äôs a habit.
---
That's more of a reflection on stain wagon pilots.
---
If you can seriously look at Eve and not say Rorquals, Titan and Citadel proliferation changed things quite a bit, you're genuinely either thick or lyin', boyo.
---
Wow, such a mean boy. Good that you're in a basement behind the safety of a computer. xD
---
I don't mean it as a big slight on anyone, I think we all enjoy winning more than the grind to get there (if it even gets you there). There's just a difference between doing whatever it takes to win and sometimes flying stuff you don't enjoy vs the alternative. I've flown tons of stuff I hate for the sake of objectives, plenty of pilots can say the same.
---
I see that PanFam found a worthy enemy for them self.
---
I don't think a reset is the way to go.
---
I do think that there ought to be burner clones.
---
These would acquire skills at an increased rate and would not be able to have a death clone.
---
Perhaps a modifier for skill rate based on pvp kill final blows that has a booster like effect.
---
These should occupy a char slot and not be able to use extractors.
---
Final random thought.... They can train skills to a 6th level and have a scaling bounty in line with their SP if you pod them.
---
&gt; This is the most boring war eve has seen.
---
When one side has the strategy of "just stay docked and hope the baddies go away, if not evac" then yeah it becomes a boring war, just like countless of similar wars that PL has orchestrated against lesser entities across the regions of EVE in the last decade. It didn't stop them then, and won't stop us now.
---
It is telling that Shadow Cartel put up a bigger fight over the Aeschee Keepstar (saved it on it's first armor timer) than NCPL have done in the whole of the North. Heck even FCON put up a bigger fight then this :D
---
GaNg BaNg TeAm operate out of NPC fountain and do some ganking and camping around there.
---
Shit dude. Viciate put out a video of us fighting POSPY 5 times in the same chain. We won the first, lost the second bad, the reshipped when we got more nerds on, chain crit, went down the crit chain twice in enyos and traded a lot of enyos for some I think guardians and some other stuff.
---
Spoiler alert, they ain't.
---
Yep, fits right in there.
---
So long as you can stand being alone in TS with hellion for an hour or two you're welcome to join. We're always recruiting
---
Remember when ECM bursts could give you aggro timers inside POSes. Pepperridge farm remembers.
---
I always have fun playing with myself
---
Depends.  Did your supers undock?  I mean except to avoid asset safety when the Keepstar blows up.
---
thats relative, anyone starting the game in the last 6 months isn't flush as all these 10 yr bitter vets
---
Aren't the therabois semi difficult to get into? It's not just "yes I have scanning skills and can fly doctrine ships"
---
yeah\~we finally can finish this game after years waste on shit talk. I am happy we all win in the last
---
Someone in TS said they made one so now we're a solid 4/10
---
Sounds like fun! I've put in my application.
---
Do you have a link to the video, by any chance?
---
Was the nerf bat too heavy or do you think the nerf bat was not required entirely?
---
Lived in WH space for 5 years, never once fought volta. No clue why null bois have such a hard dick for these guys.
---
Do they just dunk null bads?

Soft 4/10 at best

AAR:
---
Reporting for their nightly feed, Provibloc one again became persnickety and tried to take over sovereignty that doesn't belong to them.
---
Sov node warfare went as expected, Rekking allows (even helps) the node war for the extremely important YWS0 system to complete (intentionally losing the node war) to drop a new ihub to try and force an engagement.
---
Provi is reticent to engage, their FC feels that they cannot handle a direct confrontation despite approximately equal numbers (they've fed a lot, almost daily, don't judge them). But he has a clever trick up his sleeve, which he's holding close to his vest and is totally not obviously telegraphing.  Rekking wins the ihub complete uncontested, but provi isn't standing down, they start water boarding and its pretty clear an engaging space battle could maybe occur!
---
Sure enough, proviblock gets into it's mighty mach fleet and jumps into the system where the RC extraction is being water boarded. Rekking Rattles launch drones when suddenly and without provocation an entire Tapi Nightmare fleet arrives to help the poor provibloc fleet.
---
Machs arrive on grid, and start immediately falling over, one by one, ship by ship.  Where is Tapi they shout, We need halp they shout.  Tapi arrives to save the day victory is surely upon them! Now one system out from the provibloc capital keepstar system battle is locked between a handful of rekking rattles, and more than double their numbers in big faction space battleships. With a handful of battleship and only a lone triage for support it looks grim for our heroes.
---
Cyno up, calls the provi fc.  Kill that pesky triage and lets lordmopp the floor with these guys!  Dreads land and start shooting powerful space lazors and space bullets at the poor lone triage. But what's this? The lone triage valiantly holds it's ground against both fleets!  Not only that a counter cyno is lit and another handful of dreads jump in from the rekking heroes and start the easypeazy task of slaying the initial dread wave of the evil provibloc.
---
And then, with both sides undoubtedly prepared to escalate further and mach after mach of proviblock subcaps getting annihilated provi disengages the nightmares pull range and everyone re-evaulates.
---
Tapi holds grid, at range but they hold.  Rekking sits waiting for tapi dreads and provi dreads to land but no! nothing! no support is coming. The rekking dreads coast easily out of seige and warp off grid, because hey, who bubbles caps in nullsec what nonsense is this.
---
Now provibloc lives next door, they have many space weasels stored there and they choose to reship into mighty muninns! But sadly their fc doesn't realize he's not from alberta and warps them into the fight anyway.
---
Muninns land and start laying into the now slightly weakened rekking subcap fleet still only supported by a small logi wing and a lone triage. Although this looks like a stalemate, rekking is woefully outnumbered with the evil tapi holding grid at range and munnins now working towards alpha striking subcapital logistics. What is there to do? Where is there to turn?
---
Oh Yeah, rekking says cyno up baby and jumps back into the fight now with carriers and in short succession annihilate 1, 2, 3 evil  tapi nightmares. Surely now the main provi dreads will land, these are just carriers after all and are super fun to dread bomb, but no.  Immediately realizing they are completely outshipped and out skilled the tapi and provi fleets run for their lives but not before being bubbled and blasted many more times as they run as fast as their adorable legs will carry them.
---
Now with the grid clear and then also as adorable as ever, a brave newbie fleet arrives in 6 entire spaceships! They attack our heroes too but sadly are exploded almost as fast as their can be locked.
---
And then we all went home to think about what we're doing with our lives.
---
GF everyone!
---
whoa whoa whoa, bonga isn't an fc, he is just au tz chief mascot!
---
Nah. There's a handful of systems jump freighters use to get into highsec, he just camps these because there's an endless stream of them coming through.
---
Mostly based off experience, yup
---
Little red rolling hole had 14 docked, refused to fight the 4 people we had on comms. Then tried to roll. 
---
The next 3 times we rolled in they refused to fight, but later when they saw some rolling battleships they tried to gank them.
---
But couldn't fight us. Only try shoot rolling bs. Very odd. 
---
Almost like my shit talk has reason behind it; I'd love to shittalk your corp, but you'd need to do something before I could.
---
Holy shit that sounds awesome! TOTALLY wanna steal this idea!
---
yeah but link is submitted and I don't think I can change it anymore.  Anyway whatevs.
---
I intend to, but right now my computer just isn‚Äôt good enough. I can technically play the game, but it‚Äôs not enjoyable at 10 frames.
---
i wish i had screencaps of this tishu forum thread so i could show them to rive, and see if i could tell when his forehead vein starts bulging partway through reading the thread where seraph tries to justify plated maledictions being better fleet ceptors than stilettos
---
Most do wormhole things. That's a wormhole corp to me.
---
But far beyond the military value of those SIGs, the real strength of that is the variety of things you can do. You don't have to go to another alliance to do a certain activity, just join another SIG ^^

I like what Ehefkae is doing lately!

[https://eve-tracker.org/whkills](https://eve-tracker.org/whkills) is also fun to follow

If you think ppwer projection is still a problem at this point we'll just have to agree to disagree. However I would point out that EVE is 16 years old and those "insane" mechanics were how things worked for most of that time. If projection was really the big problem the game wouldn't have made it so long.

Thank you!

And my main is Jamico Toralen.

Everquest on and off since 1999. So 20 years.

Holy fuck those comms were bad. And the dictor pilots need to get hearing aides.

Soo all the time and money l have spent into this game will be gone ? ..... buddy go back to smoking the spod
---
I use RivaTuner for fps limiting.
---
Very good, will it be on iTunes soon?
---
Eve got worse with citadel expansion, no one likes big changes and Fozzie, Seagull who made it.
---
Hey! They undock... thrashers.
---
I suppose this is the right time and place to mention that there is a sale of fitted ex-skillu buses is 2XI keepstar (Malpais)
---
It was dumb but then this exploiting of alphas as horde Awoxers is getting stale and kind of sad too. It's literally the only play some people have in the game it seems.
---
I don't think the problem with the game is tied to one issue, it's many, and power projection is one of them in my mind.
---
You're kind of an expert on that subject matter Radakos ;)
---
Cos this heavily hyped  PÃ∂RÃ∂ Ã∂eÃ∂xÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂cÃ∂iÃ∂sÃ∂eÃ∂  war has resulted in so little real content to keep the Goon casuals interested.
---
Credit to Init they have actually tried to hit side objectives while mainGoon distracts the NC attention; hitting the P3EN keepstar when they did was very clever, and brought down a 9 day timetable on that keepstar to c.4 days for reaction because they hit the timers well.
---
As much as Goon command may try to take credit for P3EN, Init were the ones that let it happen.
---
That's funny, I dont remember flying the orca through that gate with any problems..
---
Bullshit.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about lol.
---
ty for thinking about us poor goonie line members
---
LOL you are so full of shit.
---
"Oh I was JUST coming to see you dude, but you'd just left, oh dang, I'll catch you next time."
---
You're literally that dumbass friend everyone has at college who borrows 20 bucks from you and spends all academic year ducking you so they don't have to pay up. Literal cretin.
---
Definitely interested in more of this! iTunes when you can please guys!
---
I'm not sure if you're disagreeing or agreeing with me. I don't think you perhaps understand the meaning of the words you are using...
---
How's your AT ship collection doing?
---
Cloak is omega only Helo
---
tldr; some lackey moving one of dooms titans got warped off a keepstar, high probability of it being Hedliners fault, so hardly surprising really.
---
I play with one acc and have no problem keeping up. More accounts also means more krabbing to plex
---
The price for the dumbest suggestion 2019 goes to.....
---
I‚Äôm afraid this has been a thing a lot longer than alpha clones. 
---
The general rule has always been flag exempt in supercaps your fc will order you to turn it on if you need to. 
---
Everyone had horde spy / awox alts a long time before  alpha clones were a thing. And if you think someone wouldn‚Äôt have burned one pre alpha clones to potentially kill several titans and supers then you are deluding yourself. 
---
It wasn‚Äôt even a combat op, the fc had no reason to have free move on in the first place.
---
Well, this surely is a dumb post, hoping to provoke, but Panfam leadership must be extremely dumb to give you any kind of fight, given Goons and Garbage of the Galaxy outnumber Panfam like 3 times, there is no fun in that kind of engagement.
---
Well sure there were always spais but the alpha thing allows basically infinite rinse-and-repeat insertion of awoxers. I do see what you are saying about how an omega spai could have been burned to warp the Titans, but otoh we don't know it was an an omega and alphas make it much easier with their zero cost of business.
---
Another one of our weekly finest moments. Why this is downvoted, is beyond me.
---
Oooh, pick us, pick us!
---
(Though admittedly most of our content is outside J-space)
---
Oh yes the covert research facility. I think literally everyone in eve has died to them at least once haha
---
&gt; If you drop massive amounts of money into anything other than Plex or game time, your part of what makes CCP direct their attension to other areas rather than player retension
---
Tbh dropping more money into alts also may contribute to CCP not looking into whatever may increase *new* player retention.
---
&gt; the guys running elite dangerious have a die hard set of idiots who want ED to be everything EVE isnt
---
Does that really makes them idiots if they consciously decided to fill another niche? Or at least it looks to me this is what may be happening.
---
Use an ishtar in the future?
---
Well as you can see, last 2 days i did come and lost some ships to you, also got some nice kills. But the salt is nice i have to admit. Btw, why r u selfdestructing capitals on your keepstar undock ? LOL
---
right around when i thought i'd long purged all my nostalgic eve feelsies this fuckin week happens
---
I'm getting a Starbound vibe
---
&gt; To Legacy, it was this existential fight where you guys finally proved to the game that you were a Big Deal. You weren't anyone's pets anymore, you were a big alliance that could do it all on your own and by the way you have a lot of supers too and you know how to use them.
---
the best part of this item: from underpinning that entire night with "goons will come; they must come", to goons actually coming, resulting in the node crashing and the losing side being able to extract as a result
---
I play solo. Game is still awesome.
---
Or you know, you could actually run some checks on who you recruit.
---
That's bad for game since it puts off new-bros.
---
You completely lost me with your first sentence. Did not read the rest.
---
We will be getting it on all the major places people get podcasts soon! Thanks for checking it out.
---
Yup! Will be getting it up soon!
---
If sp isn‚Äôt a way to compensate for a skill disparity I guess NCPL can stop crying about skill injectors, cuz you know it‚Äôs about being leet and not leaning on an sp disparity crutch.
---
Try some exploration, check out the current warzones and some npc regions for good availibility of sights
---
After that train into the vexor, its a great ship for missions, ratting, and can be used in the abyss.
---
After you try different things challenge yourself and try living someplace outside of hisec with a group of peepz you like. It may take a few different corps to find the right one. Dont worry.
---
Good luck!
---
It reads like you had a stroke somewhere midthought when planning to write this, but decided to plough ahead with it anyway.
---
It is true that the value floor that makes this kind of thing worth the trouble is much lower since alpha clones. 
---
When it comes to Titans tho, all bets are off as far as awoxing goes. It‚Äôs why I advise friends to not Titan rat, even in ‚Äúfortress‚Äù delve. 
---
It only takes one spy blue character cloaked in a HIC waiting at your next site and a bunch of dreads waiting on login screen and you are sooo fucked. 
---
Not worth the trouble for a super, but disputes how common they are getting it very much still is for a Titan plus whoever jumps to his cyno without knowing what‚Äôs going down. 
---
They could drop 40 T1 gun dreads on your head and you are almost certainly very dead regardless of how fast you cyno up in standing fleet, and they will still come out way ahead even assuming they lose all the dreads which they probably wouldn‚Äôt even in delve.
---
Or our ACLs aren't retarded.
---
Do you need to put in a diplo request in triplicate to Goons everytime something goes down in J5A and you need to use their keepstar?
---
You can transfer all the years of ingame knowledge though and the player groups.  
---
Actually I think the second server would be even worse, because if a big group from TQ switches over, they will have a massive advantage.  
---
N+1 works without titans (besides the fact that you can get one pretty fast if you have a dedicated player group)
---
I would suggest though that the availability of alpha spais make it much more likely you will have one at the right place and right time for this sort of thing though.
---
Are you trying to threaten me lmao ?
---
when you're playing within a culture of deliberate autism, tryharding isn't inherently what burns you out so long as you can still find fulfillment.
---
when pretty much every road you can take that level of effort down becomes unfulfilling, the question becomes whether you should just indefinitely zombie-mode it regardless, or make a quit call.
---
lol no, just messing with you. :D fun fun
---
Thanks for confirming you‚Äôre retarded
---
I bet you would not even be able to explain what retarded means without googling. :D

I managed to cut down my eve time to \~2 hours every other day (more on weekends, still) - it feels good to spend more time with wife/kiddo but at the same time i realize I was using eve as a safe place and I feel the pressure of the real :(
---
You might want to look up the term "soft reset"
---
&gt;I also enables people to do like 15 man gate camps by themselves.
---
Not without input broadcasting. I think you're vastly overestimating how easy it is to run multiple accounts.
---
&gt;**Super capital proliferation**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Honestly i don't see this a a notable problem by it'self, but it does make the multiple accounts thing way worse.
---
Supercap proliferation is absolutely a problem. Supers are essentially broken "instant win" buttons that can be called down on any target at a moment's notice. Compare the state of small gang and small corp action in null vs. wormhole space, and realise that the reason why wormhole space is more dynamic and more fluid is because we don't have supers or titans. Supers are also difficult if not impossible to counter with anything less than other supers or sheer numbers, the former of which requires committing significant assets and the latter of which requires committing less significant assets but guaranteeing you'll take very expensive losses in the process.
---
A good solution to supers is simply to make them not be able to jump to anything but a Pharolux. So no jumping to the middle of fights. Either that, or requiring a 5-min spool-up before a cyno is actually lit. These changes turn supers and titans from tactical weapons into strategic ones which require more careful planning, coordination, and logistics (traditional, not EVE sense) before being deployed.

According to the lore the Vitoc cure is given by *Otro* Gariushi (CEO of ishukone which is one of the big 8 caldari megacorp) to the thukker tribe. Although it is not publicly known in new eden, it is describe in the Empyrean Age novel.
---
Sir best comment on r/eve l have read in a long time.
---
I am truely sad that they closed the door. Having an enemie like them was more then entertaining for the last years. They evicted us (Razor) 2-3 times and were a great source of action and thread. 
---
Having an "arch enemie" like them who line Members can hate, fear, respect or all of the 3 at once was delightful to see.
---
My dearest respect to you guys.

Special thx to sabre pilot and alike for beeing a very special pain in the ass. XD

That is a tenuous link.
---
Pirate ships usually have more linking than that.
---
Gona definitely give this a listen, small gang has always been my thing and with just coming back right now and seeing the state of low sec this topic comes at the right time.
---
actually a good idea
---
Your "PLEX is pay to win" statement is dumb. In actual pay to win games, you can pay cash to buy golden ammo or other overpowered items that give you a direct advantage in the game and cannot be obtained by other means (or can be, but the process is excruciatingly long and/or mind-numbingly boring). PLEX is merely an equivalent for game time, a subscription that you can train on the market. When selling PLEX to other players, you aren't creating any additional in-game assets that affect anyone's gameplay - you're merely buying someone else's grind.
---
Multiboxing 15 windows is not as easy as you might think. If you see a 15-character multiboxed gatecamp, bring some friends and wreck this mothercucker, don't be a pussy.
---
Now, PLEX paired with skill injectors is what has fundamentally changed the game environment. Before injectors and SP farming, running numerous accounts was exclusive to extreme turbokrabs, because one had to grind the full PLEX price for every account. Today, it's trivial. But, again, what they've led to is a complex issue that has a lot to do with the architecture of sov nullsec.
---
I just want to point out my headset's mic is playing up so you can't actually hear me speaking! F
---
Honestly, you might have a few good points in there, but your writing just isn't great.
---
The reality is that CCP re-shuffled the books to inflate its value.
---
I feel like I'm missing something when he says "Winning EVE" what does that mean? Like quitting the game for good?? Or something else??
---
üòÇüëå
---
So the tops took all the money and RMTd it, right?
---
I'm making better isk with a rattle in C3 space than most people make with two supers in Delve. You can make insane isk solo.
---
get more Rorqs and mine more Spod it will fix your problems
---
Pretty sure it's not about other players catering to a playstyle and more about the fact that if you can't N+1 in this game you might as well not log in anymore because there's no meaningful small scale content. You can't take and hold space as a small alliance and the ability to project force anymore under a given umbrella has made solo and small gang gameplay and almost non-existent sliver of what it used to be. Almost nothing has been added in game (Barring Triglavian stuff but even that's pve) that encourages small scale content, everything has been tilted towards the huge Null alliances for years.
---
Oh lol so quite a few. So like 6-8mil per site
---
Just assign all 80 drones to a sebo'd stiletto with a point.
---
&gt; don't be a pussy.

cmon now you know thats impossible.

I praise Mittanni, Wisest and most handsome of all men, before each kill i deliver to his glory.

False news, Spectre and NPSI has never awoxed provi fleets. However, I am not bellow using our many provi alts to start doing so. Its hard being nice when surrounded by pricks. Equi of all people should know the narritive, its clear here even he doesnt have a clue. Ill endevour to catch him up with our ongoings. I would also encourage provi to continue the major stream of shit posting and downvote scrubery. Your PR department is top notch and is providing many smiles for all of us, especially those not involved &lt;3 Standby for the meme retorts of the JB's etc we capped, all the caps provi keeps loosing, all the failed attempts at defence. If we are going to war lets war right? right? over reddit :)

lawl imagine not biomassing your character and starting over, after that corp theft...

Imagine every imperium titan lose = reddit post
---
In that sense it's just like WoW which has also been dying ever since release.
---
What a shit example and completely irrelevant. On WoW you don't have to wait years to have the required amount of skillpoints to do X.. and to reply to one of your other comments, a reset is stupid and would only kill the game.
---
yet... you leadership will fight us over someone elses timers in frat space, you can really see where your leaderships loyalties live, and its certainly not with with the home and moral of the Panfam line members to busy worried about their wallet and renter income to give a flying fuck about their defense and line members

Good man! Now pls explain it in similar, simple fashion to the tards here where we put ' in sentences and words and whether your is the same as you're and ur.

Remember when ccp used to give a shit? me neither...

Every day is a school day

Why would I do that?
---
go to drones/fighters look for heavy fighters.
---
Another thing to remember. Once used, you cannot repair. They only have to be in a gun to be considered used. And you cannot stack damaged crystals. I have 2 containers for all my used crystals. EVE will not let you have more then 1k different items in your hangar.
---
well played init good kills :D
---
I only see a few good solutions about this   
---
1. You can extract your sp as "free sp" with a malus comparable to the injector's diminishing returns (so 20% below 20mil up to 60% past 80mil)  so you can properly re-specialize. 
---
2. (actually 1.1) - have all the skills available to the player so you don't have to "buy them" ffs. 
---
3. if you want to sell your skillpoints you can extract them in an accelerator (instead of straight up injection)   
---
this way you keep the re-spec effect and fuck up the skill farms.
---

Hey,
---
    Semi new player here and after moving to null sec, joining a corp, and investing into some mining boats i now have the isk to invest in some pvp ships. So i was wondering while trying to find out what kind of pvp ship i like i want to know which ships to start aiming for. 
---
Whats a good pvp frig ? 
---
Whats a good pvp deatroyer ? 
---
---Are T3 destroyers good for solo /duo pvp? 
---
Whats a good pvp cruiser ? 
---
-----Should i shoot for T3 cruisers ? 
---
Whats a good pvp battleship? 
---
------- Are mauraders good solo/ duo pvp boats ?
---
Citadel are an issue.
---
For other, you just want to solve symptom and not rootcause
---
It's odd because in the past they seemed to be having plenty of fun having 3 times as many supercapitals as everyone else but now they think it can't be fun. Why would that be, do you think?
---
Welcome to Delve.
---
Because wormholers tend to distrust Corp thieves. Particularly ones dumb enough to get caught stealing on a main.
---
&gt; Before fatigue there was always a bigger fisher, now the biggest fish is just whoever lives there.
---
This sentence before jump fatigue boiled down to "There are always bored PL Super Pilots waiting to jump cross the whole map in a few minutes for any showing of more than 2 Capitals and if anyone dared to touch any Lowsec R64"
---
Whilst true, you can also make your pee turn red and give your mum conniptions. So: worth it.
---
I mean, if they won't have me they won't have me. I'm not going to try and hide anything I've done. I own up to my mistakes.
---
SP disparity shoukd exist, that's what happens when people are in a game for a longer period of time you mango.
---
Returning to the EVE after 2.5y
---
Incursions still a thing?
---
Any major changes?
---
I assume typical missions, incursions, mining, industry, pvping and scanning is the same except new map for d-scan, p-scan
---
I said you want kill eve.
---
Creativity is already reward (true creativity not just make the same action you see on youtube and evryonne know).
---
RISK VS EFFORT VS REWARD: If you want low risk, low effort and low reward hunt outside super umbrella, find someone take time but congrats you do'nt need to think to blap him. 
---
Hunt under space with hight density of player with a lot ready to pvp: Find target is easy, but find a good target need effort. If you spend this effort you lower you're risk for a nice KM in reward.  If you don't want make effort and just rush on first ship you see ... Ok you make no effort you take risk, you could have a reward or simply die.

---
Mainly because asset safety has been introduced to give sturctures the same functionality that old outposts had, where the structure couldn¬¥t get destroyed. Most people wouldn¬¥t move all their stuff to nullsec when there would be a chance to loose everything. Instead they would keep everything valuable in safe NPC stations, and only take the things they really need to the structures. With assest safety they can take everything with them without having to feat that they loose everything when they take a pause or are on vacation.
---
True, there should be different kinds of asset safety, or it only being part of certain structures like citatels, but to remove the safety would only mean that people would move their stuff to NPC stations
---
Volta dont live in W-Space and are not a wormholer alliance.
---
Cries in wormhole
---
Image the boost to Goons if the asset safety will be disabled and all stuff drops.          
---
They have NPC stations in Delve (100% asset safety), same for Querious (you just gate to NPC station) not mentioning the Fountain.
---
please keep telling people how to play their game.
---
They're stupid then, if you want to join the winning side you join the biggest, most powerful empire in history(us) not a bunch of elite-pvpers who cry about blobs.
---
As long as you can have a shit ton of corp in an alliance, and that blueing people is a thing, how exactly can you prevent people from coalescing into mega-groups if they wish to do so?
---
definitely not laughing about this chucklefuck playing pod hockey with a gate camp after ditching his ship cuz he fucked a fleet warp. this isn't lame at all, it's goddamn funny
---
You know that like half of SW also joined Goons?
---
you're right. by the time you are able to drop big space bux on injectors, titan, fit and support toons for it, losing a couple hundred thousand or even a million sp dying in a titan isn't that big of a hindrance
---
i'm talking about the ones crying in nc that you're referring to
---
harsh.
---
It's impossible to limit players forming big groups in any sensible way. But the playerbase as a whole can't really complain that small-scale PVP is dead when they themselves are the one killing it. I'd much prefer the kind of battles I had in 2006-2008 to what they appear to be now. I only ever saw a titan as a directional scan those days. As a returning player from a 6-year break I'm going to see if FW has anything nice to offer anymore - read many conflicting reports on that - but if not... oh well.
---
i've had this conversation before. you've invested time, not money. if you spent money not buying shares, then you only spent it. what you should have said is the investment is time. but i get what you are saying

Wormholers asked for more hardcore mechanics and CCP listened.

underrated comment
---
The games developer wasnt what I was reffering to, but ill go with it. ED had the most potential of any game I have ever seen. Of course its only my opinion, but if the industry and market side of EVE and the player interaction had been similar. ED would have without doubt have been the most epic game to date by a conciderable margin. The idiots I was refering to are the ones who hammered the message home to the developers that ED should remain what it was in the original version made decades ago.
---
what do you disagree with
---
They say Swiper no swipin' But I'mma swipin' this!
---
Playing spreadsheets just feel too much like work rather than fun gaming, yeah. I tried scanning stuff yesterday, and the mechanic didn't exactly feel great. Not to mention the stuff you found? Boring.  
---
Finding good fights has always been difficult, but apparently - having had my last PVP 6 years ago before a long hiatus 'til now - it's only gotten worse. No surprise there. For so many people curbstomping is somehow more rewarding than a challenging fight. In that vein I was just retrieving some assets from low-sec, and you have a Phobos, Thanatos and some other ship camping a station undock in this system with 5-15 people? Seems like lots of fun indeed (and no, they didn't even get me). I just don't understand people. How is shooting fish in a barrel ever fun?
---
Awesome. As a dad myself, I wish my son was interested in Eve rather than Rainbow Six. Then I could hear him cursing and swearing about getting rorquals ganked as he mines for me.
---
Players do that too.
---
to be devils advocate here, I always dock when a neut enters and im rating, so how do you know there a bot? obviously the guys linked here are going by the 100% tax :P
---
So far personally I only extract, not inject. It's just too damn expensive. But at least technically I can support Omega account by pretty much just extracting what I learn during the month. So even if I don't progress skill-wise (my main still has 75mil SP anyway), at least I can fly Omega ships. I can't really speak for the wider effects it has had on the game too much, since what little I've played is solo with a "narrow field of vision."
---
I'm assuming you're corp is not a whole lot into PvP otherwise you should ask them.
---
Easy way to roam null is an assault frigate like a wolf or a retribution. T3D are also a polyvalent bunch. Nanofiber cruisers (Omen navy issue, osprey navy issue, cynabal) are also good ships. T3C are expensive hunters. Marauders ar ebeging to be dropped on by carriers.
---
That's pretty much what mittens real agenda is. Stop being brainwashed.
---
My crying is mostly a joke 
---
Sure it does suck but I wouldn't have it any other way
---
Moon mining in Wildlands.
---
yeah that happens, but that's the fun part sometimes. going in a bomber squad to delve or other places where they have supercap umbrellas to whale can be fun. you know you're going to get bosoned eventually...the fun part is the risk versus reward.
---
It's because pretty much everyone in NullSec just krabs and warps away when someone shows up. There's not much difference between a bot and the average Null-Bloc member.
---
All the functionality [still seems to be there](https://imgur.com/6ibt74g) as far as I can tell.
---
And you call 3:1 odds fair? Jezus you guys are so fucking retarded and brainwashed.
---
Yes, let's keep having 1000 man in different fleet to defend farmers to drop on 2 frigates rather than having supers sit in the belts. That sounds reasonable and nobody will complain form having to be in fleet all the time to defend shit.
---
Ok, but say I am in a position where I've got some spare cash IRL but I'm asset poor in EVE.  If I buy a load of plex and sell that for isk, I've just cut out the boring ratting grind to buy injectors or assets ("*excruciatingly long and/or mind-numbingly boring*" - the perception of what this is will vary from player to player).  How is that not, in essence, P2W?
---
maybe i did
---
Well at least they provide decent info " WE ARE NOT FORMING AGAIN, IMAGINE YOURSELF ...."
---
you'll learn
---
init thought they were elite independent pvpers too, but we've shown them the way
---
haha yeah we would never do that in imperium
---
Doesnt matter the same  knowledge can be found anywhere on the internet.  Eve uni site for example.as all the information you would need.   Big group would not be able to switch over the last the rules.  And if they did the  that leaves the gap on the first server.  But they could not take any assets or isk so they start from zero.  It's all about giving new people the same opportunities.  TQ has been running for years and years its pretty much the same people because they have built up so much control, wealth and capital fleets that no one could.even compete.  I mean look probably 3/4 nullsec is up for rent because it's impossible for smaller groups to control them. All moons are taken and rented also.  The markets are completely manipulated by the larger groups blah blah.
---
This is why all other mmo have multiple instances because it's about giving others the same opportunities as everyone else.  Can you imagine playing WoW on one server and one or two groups just  constantly killed you you wouldnt play and that's what's happened to eve people dont play because what's the point. Why should they invest all their time and effort to play their game only to be controlled by another.  No one wants that anymore.
---
The time for one instance only as past. 
---
Unless CCP grab the balla make some significant balls deep  changes like limitations, stop rental, more expensive longer to build caps and citadels etc then ...
---

---
Honestly if solo and small gang gameplay is non-existent in this game than I'm not sure what I do for 10-15 hours a week. There is plenty of meaningful small scale content going on.
---
&gt; Whats a good pvp x ?  
---
that can be any of them depending on what exactly you want, answering each of them would be spoonfeeding you tbh
---
&gt; Are T3 destroyers good for solo /duo pvp?  
---
yes
---
&gt; Should i shoot for T3 cruisers ?  
---
t3 cruisers are good for cloaky hunting solo or for a blops gang, loki  &gt; legion &gt; tengu &gt; proteus atm
---
&gt; Are mauraders good solo/ duo pvp boats ?  
---
no, if you want to have marauder level tank you have to press the instant supercapital delivery button (bastion module) and if you don't press it, the only thing you have over faction battleships is the mjd spoolup time, which is not worth the price.
---
... and you will leave it the moment it will not be the "obvious place to be" as you did in all previous occasions.
---
it always will be though, we've pretty much won eve
---
&gt; I think you're vastly overestimating how easy it is to run multiple accounts.
---
Just have one sebo'd cepter/t3d you pay attention to and a bunch of drone boats repping it and assist drones.
---
Running multiple accounts can be hard, but it can also be easy as fuck.
---
I do not think that a reset under the same rules would Change the outcome.
---
They most likely won't catch you immediately, but when they eventually do, you'll find your accounts banned for alpha abuse. Is it worth it to work hard to develop your character, have some nice ships and then a few months or years later be banned? If you can live with that, by all means, go ahead.
---
Well if you want to be a parasite that's up to u.
---
To be fair and honest. As an nc roamer (we don't really do stratops cause why feed to goon f1 monkeys) and looking for fights in the pipes against goons and co. i have to say that they seem to be docked more often then panfam. You only see goons when they have stratops, if those ops are over they go back to PVE. Goons really are not PvP players.
---
Most fights in the pipes are neutrals that have come and want some entertainment.

Horde, with the amazing name of [sdadasd adsadasd](https://evewho.com/pilot/sdadasd%20adsadasd/), as explained in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c1glpn/the_story_of_a_young_boy_called_sdadasd_adsadasd/) thread.

It was truly a highly valued deep cover asset, and those PL dudes had no way to see this coming from a char with such an illustrious history, nor could any type of proper fleet setup have prevented this ... ;)

The first half or the second half of the first sentence?
---
so i've a logi 5 pilot who kinda just hangs around not doing much these days, my corp is small and WH based and idk if we are ever gonna expand, what content is good for someone who wants to be a logi pilot, is my best bet nullblobs?
---
Yes you can do it. No you shouldn't as ccp will flag and ban the alpha.
---
Happened with me trying to get my kid into it from bloody roblox. The GM was a prick about the whole thing, got my kid into runescape instead.
---
I know there's different ways of looking at this, but I think people having multiple accounts is the root cause of most of these problems.
---
After reading your running post, I wouldn't have been surprised if they did just bin you off...
---
Waiting for this to end up on Pixel Starships game :D
---
Yes, just go quietly. Don‚Äôt try to save the game. Don‚Äôt tell anyone your reasoning. 
---
Then again, if enough folks say something, Mebbe ccp listens and the game is saved.
---
Ye that's what I am worried about,  like 6-7 years of skill time gone :/
---
How easy is it to make the 2bill a month now?
---
Is high sec mining still viable for it \[t2 barge with t2 stips\]? as I will not have access to any wh/null for pve
---
But there is a sale on skins! Lots of skins!
---
Aww that sucks :/
---
Ye its a shame they don't let you dual account.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Wait is this the guy that made those 1337 structure-bashing videos and then had a total breakdown on reddit and ended up challenging someone irl for an mma fight?
---
&gt; In actual pay to win games, you can pay cash to buy ... items that give you a direct advantage
---
So, pay cash for plex, sell plex for isk, buy fit titian and skills with isk...
---
Isn't paying cash for an advantage, how?
---
&gt; Multiboxing 15 windows is not as easy as you might think.
---
Good bet if you want to do small gang stuff in null is join a WH corp with a null static.
---
Thank you fpr ypur time ! My issue that im facing is that i just dont know where to begin, should i start with Frigs? Cruisers? Battleships? Basically im looking for a starting point to get a taste of what the ship classes have to offer.
---
Hehe. I had played less than 10 days when I got my first Brutix in 2006. I was using it for missions, even shield-tanked at first because I was scared of losing my shields! Then on the tenth day of playing I went to low-sec with it (mind you, I had been to low-sec since the start, just with smaller ships) and got attacked by pirates while belting. After my heart nearly beating itself out of my chest I refused ransom and blew up! Bought a new one soon after with insurance money. Lost it two days later to can baiter Enyo. Good times. Still one of my favorite hulls, currently getting back into things with the Astarte doing some level 4s. Looks like I lost my first Dominix about a month later. I had a Megathron at the time too, but still a big loss for those days especially as it was uninsured.  
---
Heh. On a side note, while looking up that info I ran into an old EVEmail. In 2008 I paid 470mil ISK for 60 days of game time. Previously last time I had Omega it was about 1bil for 30d. Now it's 2bil or more. Times sure have changed expenditure-wise... except my income is pretty much the same unless I extract skills to sell!
---
&gt; Where are my launched goods?
---
customs office or cargo container if you launched them from command center, the location of cargo container should be in the journal
---
&gt; For highsec, should I make T2?
---
idk should you
---
&gt; can I just link them all together without a storage facility?
---
&gt; And why is my output so small if it says 300k in 22h?
---
idk get out of highsec if you need more resources
---
Yea, sorry.
---
Any specific tips?
---
So if he was lazy, what would he gain by starting back at zero?
---
No. You are just whining about it now. 
---
Remember thar you are (or you were) on a full pvp game.
---
If i m killing your game (like you did too remember) it s perfectly fine. It s the game.
---
See you in tribute.

I left and have gone through a dozen games, still looking for something that catches my attention like eve did.
---
Real men keep assets in WH cits.

It‚Äôd be tough to do that in hs I think
---
Even if you don't want to have supers, the space that just got available is hard to reach in terms of logistics, something that is often overlooked.  
---
I have been in high,low, null and wh systems and even if you have the goal to be self-sufficient, you will quickly realise that once in a while you just need to do that Jita trip

Between churn and retirement there isn't a full stable of competent FCs anymore. That tends to dampen turnout and morale. Add to that the backseat politicking from morons who still play discord online and its lights out.

It's possible but you'll be grinding all month long to get the 2.5B you need to plex.
---
Biggest thing is the Triglavian Invasion. Lore stuff etc etc that's pretty neat mechanically we have a new set of ships  (with their own skills, not a pirate faction hybrid skills) called Precursor ships which have the unique ability to fit an Entropic Disintegrator, a weapon system which starts off with below average damage but spools up over time (over 10 cycles I think) to be +50% base damage. Similarly themed remote armor repairers as well, increasing amount of reps.
---
Mutaplasmids added, which can be applied to some modules to randomly improve or penalize their statistics. Theoretically, you can end up with modules better than Officer mods (or---oh God---using it on an Officer mod), but you'll probably just end up effectively ruining the item by randomly rolling into a penalty to the most important stat(s).

Now I understand the StainGuy hype. Definitely the worst shitpost I've ever seen in the comments section.

I think OP just wants missile hardpoints on his Vagabond.
---
Well, you should check  [updates.eveonline.com](https://updates.eveonline.com/) for the major stuff. CCP recently added a new type of event, called Triglavian invasions. I think a side-effect of this is a nerf of the incursion spawn rate in highsec. So incursions are still a thing, but I'm not sure how the recent nerf has / will affect the various groups running them.

Legacy lost dreads. North lost Titans. Dread insurance is good. Titan insurance is shit. The br was basically a wash at a bit over a trillion for each team.

Legacy got to loot the field.

No way North won the isk war.

He is not wrong though.

Having no asset safety really would increase the value of regions with NPC stations in them even more.

---
yeah i accidentally broke it. Will be restored with next release
---
&gt; Currently if you apply 500 of them on a new character you get half a million SP for each one instead of them scaling down.
---
Since when? The last time i checked, total sp included the unassigned pool and properly nerfed my injectors.
---
Damage control changes few years back were good. However anything that players interact less with eachothers or makes ships, structures and assets explode less often were not, such as:
---
\- Hyperdunking nerf
---
\- Awoxing nerf
---
\- Citadels (not really citadels fault per se, just the OP mechanics for timezone tanking and asset safety)
---
\- Orca buff (this buff with combination of damage control changes gave orcas insane EHP, essentially making it the ultimate afk mining/baiting ship in high-sec)
---
\- Skiff buff
---
\- Bowhead was in it's core a good addition, but it's like orca, insane tank without drawbacks  
---
Ofcourse, before these changes going past 6 years there was :
---
\- Ganking insurance nerf
---
\- Ganking boomerang nerf
---
\- Can flipping nerf
---
\- Mining barge/Exhumers goot massive EHP, but this was probably ok
---
And probably some other stuff I might have missed.   
---
Yes, I'm biased since I'm the one shooting people instead of the one getting shot, but IMHO the massive drop in player numbers in high-sec is partly because of these changes. Some of the changes are small, some changes literally killed professions outright.
---
My point is, high-sec was quite boring before and these incremental changes year after year have lobotomized it beyond coma levels of boredom, instead of adding more fun/hr to the game.
---
Not sure what you're talking about, but having been in Wormholes for about 6 months and haven't found a single significant group who runs away.
---
Now if you're dropping multiple supers and Titans when they venture into K-Space with their small multiboxed subcap fleets, I'm not sure what you are expecting them to do.
---
i wish there was PL comms record
---
No, go away scammer of new players
---
No multiple account is not the root cause. 
---
It's human nature. Nerf multiple account ? Spoiler plex price will continue tu increase beacause plex seller will have less account to equip.
---
Abyssal Space
---
Thera. Thera is not a wormhole, it's a system only accessible via wormholes. Normal WH limitations do not apply there.
---
Run combat sites. Escalations in HS can net you a few hundred million ISK on a good night.
---
Add some 8 Bit Music ^^
---
It shouldn't be to hard though should it? 
---
Doing the maths, a 3 day old account can make 25mill in a mining frig for 10h work.. and you need to make 70mill a day for 30 days to get 2B... t2 barge could make that surly?
---
EVE is an interesting game. It is a game where two (or more) sides can fight each other and both end up being winners.
---
waiting for cambion buy order to fill
---
I colonized a C3 with lowsec static, it is not the best space in the game, tiny, not many moons and overall not attractive.
---
Which is perfect for me, I can roll the wandering hole and crab the sites, or leave them open and do some PvP.
---
If I have no sites in my hole I can do sites in another or pop out of my lowsec static and do some DED sites, clone soldiers or do the level 4 FW missions as I stuck 1 char in Minmatar one in Galente so I go options depending where I have gone.
---
I can also go do lowsec pvp and if there is no PvP I can roll it and find a better region.
---
Not immense isk/hr but better and more varied than most none null activities.
---
Nah that was in late April/early May iirc
---
You can still easily do exploration even if you are not in a null sec bloc.
---
Instead of ratting I suggest you go and do Incursions, good isk and a lot more social working in a fleet than ratting by yourself.
---
If you want some solo isk making then abyssal sites are profitable and can be ran from anywhere you base out of.
---
Are you looking for a corp that facilitates all of the above? Join in-game channel Sons of bob and ask to speak to Olli Jokinen.
---
If you do anything medium-gang in wh, you'll always need logi. I'm talking 30+ peeps. Even in smaller gangs it might still be good to have a scimi or oneiros going. Maybe join a wh group with more pvp going on?
---
Since you also have Logi V, you're a part of the way to get a Fax, which is good for home defense in wormholes + if you ever join a null blob.
---
What little I tried so far, the sites themselves are boring as hell, though?
---
In fact you already have FLEETS ready to defend H24 in some region.
---
You think people drop 2 super for the lol with no backup? If yes dreadbomb they and collect kill mail. 
---
People must stop thinking super umbrella are just about super. if you hve super umbrella you have all other shit ready of course, you just don't send they every time beacause easier to jump 2 super as bridge a shitons of subcap.
---
But the shtions of subcap are obviusly ready to help if you try to fuck with suepr who jump. 
---
A lot of people who complaining about super umbrella do'nt understnd how umbrella work ,a nd how they born. They born from a lot of player who start to defend each other. Super are just a tool of that.  Problem is actually to many people are to stupid to make effort when they hunt to find good target. So they go in space with umbrella, attack first ship they see and go to reddit to cry. 
---
If they spend effort to find a weak target they will have kill... and if they do'nt want spend effort ? Just spend more ISK on you're drop, do'nt come only with bomber, take dread, take bigger. 
---
The big advantage of umbrella is : a lot of people make a minimal effort to keep everyonne alive. 
---
The big disavantage is : you need to have enought people H24 beacause attacker choose when and where they attack.
---
I have a highsec incursion alt. I run the abyss w/ my main and also do some wh ratting.
---
There are plenty of ways to get off the nullsec tit, believe in yourself! You can do it!
---
&gt;eventually
---
Wow, almost like a newbro doesn't want to wait weeks for an insignificant difference.

It hasn't been updated for years, it's buggy, but it still has working features that are easy to use, like changing fps cap on the fly.

Let's say I want to start learning how to FC, is it easier to start learning to FC for small-gang first and move on from there to medium and then blob? Are there corps that train you to FC?

---
Thank you
---
sell your stuff, leave your alliance and find your own small, medscale content. thats the best part of eve online!
---
Sounds like fun and emergent gameplay.
---
WH constantly say - disable asset safety ... but their main assets are in NPC stations any way.
---
What were the previously goalposts that I moved?
---
You really are a fucking cretin lol.
---
It's  probably the most boring way to get enough ISK. I just use my hs alt (alpha) to mine, when I'm doing my household and can leave the game alone for a bit. But I'm  not making much out of it. It's just a "get some ISK, while doing something else"
---
If you will buy PLEX through mining, you will probably be doing nothing else, but fly to an asteroid belt, mine, fly back to a station, sell, and fly back. Not really exciting and fun. And as an Alpha, you can just use the Venture and no mining drones. 
---
Exploration can be good for ISK, but it's still about luck. You could fly around for hours and find a few sites with little loot or you find the jackpot in the first 30mins. And as usual in nullsec/wh the sites are more rewarding, but the risk is also higher. 
---
I'm an alphaplayer with my main in nullsec. Theoretically I made over 200mill this weekend with ratting, exploring and trading some of the loot. BUT because I made a few mistakes, I lost two of my VNI and the replacement had cost me almost everything I made those two days. Still made a plus.
---
It would increase the gap on TQ, because an alliance like Goons would not just disband their assets.
---
So you have medium sized groups that are not quite strong enough on TQ to claim sov leaving to the new server. Of course they start from the same zero level as everyone else, with the difference that they have all the out of game stuff set up, like Auth or SEAT.
---
The only thing openening new instances will do: It eliminates the need for competition entirely.
---
If you archieve to be biggest entity on TQ2, everyone will say it is not a big deal, you should try it on TQ if were really that great (like in the old days when everything was better, ....).
---
Everyone else will stop playing on TQ/TQ2 and wait until TQ3 opens (where everything will be *different*, this time your group of 25 miners will totally be awesome and finally build that sov empire you always dreamed of...), followed by a short rush, some alliance claiming number one spot, only to be told TQ and TQ2 was too hard for them, repeat.
---
This is EVE. There is only one server that matters, it has a past and as long as people care about it, it also has a future (for the next 2 months/years/decades, then EVE is totally dead, promise).
---
Is TQ perfect? Far from it, but it was shaped this way by the people before you and if you want the people that come after you to have a different TQ, you should probably start working on that right now.
---
Since you checked the wiki, what's their citation for that? 
---
A reputable source should have their citation available.
---
Thera differs from wormhole systems because it has dockable NPC stations and the key difference - the ability to set your death clone to the NPC stations. It's effectively an NPC Null system, but instead of gates you have multiple wormholes leading to it.
---
I'll send EUni a blurb to fix it, thanks for pointing it out.
---

i'd suggest you to start out flying t1/navy cruisers in gangs as i suspect your skillpoints are on the low side for both small and medium sized ships. osprey navy, omen navy, vexor navy, vexor, stabber, caracal are all good choices. i wouldn't go solo with them until i had my support skills in a good position and could fit t2 weapons.
---
for smaller ships hookbill is a good alternative to train into, check out suitonia's videos (eveiseasy) to learn the idea of it. wolf and retri were suggested but these are kiting ships and kiting is

Real space pirates solo!
---
I guess I really ought to try it soon, been 6 years now. Maybe get an alt to check things out first and if it looks good, go with my main. The alts aren't great, they work in a fleet as tacklers but not really solo. Most of my FW was solo with my main back then, contrary to my previous PVP experience.
---
If you approach it on this level, getting a real job is way more efficient. 
---
Hell, help out your local farmer, get some bux, play eve for fun instead of montly plex.
---
11.44 billion for 2860 Plex at 4 million per Plex. The Galaxy pack gives you 10.88 billion worth of isk in items + Plex, additionally you get a 3 month subscription that is worth 6 billion Plex. So the Galaxy pack is better value overall even if it gives slightly less isk upfront.

---
&gt;That's the real shame here - you only gave us a single fight. You went down after a single punch to the face. 
---
Are you sure you actually were down there fighting or are you just imagining things? Just a few days prior to UALX, PGL led his famous fleet where his Chimera ran out of fuel and couldn't escape after most of his fleet was destroyed. You can search for posts about that on this subreddit. There was also a fairly large fight where the attackers dropped a bunch of supers to defend a fortizar deep in Legacy territory in Impass while Legacy didn't and the fortizar was destroyed anyways. This fight happened almost exacly a year ago, on the 16th of june 2018 in Y-JKJ8, according to my Nyx alt's killboard.
---
There was plenty of fights around that time. Some were won by the attackers, some were won by the defenders. UALX was just by far the largest one that is easy to understand for new players like you. There's nothing wrong with being new - I just wanted to help you understand that UALX wasn't the only thing that happened.

Trig incursions, why risking stuff in trig space while you can make as much in trig incursions 100% more safer with much useful drops.
---
If you're industrially minded you can reduce the 2 bil cost greatly, if you're in nullsec, probably entirely. It's non trivial, but with mining you will be working a lot.

Stares at the hack known as Drone assisting
---
I mean, in the real world there's all kinds of similar things. Tactical victories but strategic defeats being pretty much the same thing. (Battle of Kiev, Solomon Islands Campaigns, Tet Offensive, Battle of Mogadishu, etc). Phyrric Victories also can apply.
---
To me that just makes it even more interesting, though. The fact that complex Real Life military scenarios are just as applicable, it's not just 'win the battle to win the game'.
---
Yes, just register them on 2 different people.       
---
Like you and your grandma ^(that loves spaceships and VNI ratting)
---
The thing about asset safety is it's not really "safety" as such.  Sure the asset lives but the cost to get it back is ludicrous.  I mean it's very expensive to liberate all your things if they've been sent to low sec.  Then there's the pita of moving it all to wherever you want it, or selling it.  
---
So it's still a horror story.
---
Teach your kid to program in roblox instead of running a bot in runescape. I learned how to make games in roblox when i was like 11-13 and it translated really well into my future - i can pick up most programming languages and tasks very easily now since its basically intuitive now. 
---
Eve on the other hand (started playing at 14-15) only taught me paranoia and trust issues.
---
what song is this?
---
Mining and ratting have never been fun for a large proportion of the playerbase. Making them essential for nullsec was a death toll for PvP oriented play. I say this as somebody that hasn't logged in for two years.
---
Good instanced space is a shit idea
---
If having a high-SP character and lots of space assets in your hangar is your idea of winning, then yes, the game will be pay to win for you. But that doesn't significantly increase you chances of winning in other aspects, because all these space assets can be blown up after you undock them.
---
Try looking for a corp or alliance that owns everyone because most its members are credit card warriors. You won't find one, because whales are actually a minority, and self-organization of players is far more important for the corp's long-term success.
---
It depends on what your plans are:
---
If you want to get a few bil extra then this package is of good value.
---
However if you plan on selling the multitraining stuff and extractors to plex your account then you are better off buying the 6 or 12 month subscription plan.
---
If you want to have a bit of a 'cheaper' head start then you could go for the meteor or star pack. If you are just planning to subscribe then you are better off getting a subscription plan.
---
Hope this helped you a bit.
---
Well, there never was a safe way to store your stuff in wormholes, so luckily CCP listened to the players and didn¬¥t introduced this feature there
---
TURN IT UP I CAN'T HEAR IT
---
I'm not talking about winterco and skillu, I'm talking about PL. PL supers/titans were only involved in that one fight. PGL lost a fleet in a wormhole once, people do retarded things what of it?
---
We only used harpies and shit for the skillu fort because we were saving caps for the first UALX keepstar fight. That was the first and only battle of that war where both sides had substantial super fleets on the same grid. I know because I was there with multiple subs and capitals. It was pretty much over after that
---
All my main assets are in the wormhole. Just a random assortment of junk in npc stations. Your main stuff is what you use regularly, so why wouldn‚Äôt it be in your home?
---
I'm a very new player, it is a lot to take in at once but you start picking stuff up.  The starter missions help you get the absolute basics down.
---
If you can fly a Rorqual or a supercarrier and live in a place where you can use those for PVE, it's only a few evenings each month that you have to dedicate for this. Grinding ISK in small ships just to keep playing burns you out really fast and you won't be playing the game within a year.
---
Which one in particular? The YouTube description has the songs in order of appearance, and at the beginning of each song the title is written left of the capacitor. :)
---
Nah, the leader at the time (Karttoon) decided he hated what Goons had to become and tried to kill it before it could go any further. To little avail, obviously.
---
At the time, Goons only had Delve and Querious though, so about ~180 systems, tops, assuming they had every claimable system. They also didn't shed all of it at once, it happened over a week or so.

You do realize that you cannot PvP without income, and you cannot have ships without mining, right?

Welcome to Eve.
---
Maybe.  Not really fond of drone boats, but they have their place.
---
May use an Ishtar for Abyssals, and would be a good idea to learn how to fly it in something I'm comfortable doing.
---
The rules are to run on your main. No matter what reputation the main has.
---
Yeah, more underused ships will solve the problem with a stagnating game for sure.
---
Pretty much any NPSI public fleet feeds off of larger alliances, i.e. Bombers Bar, Spectre Fleet, etc.
---
Ok so how much isk you have in total (by this i mean all asset value + your wallet).             
---
Now how much of this is in WH in terms that it can be lost.              
---
To be precise :          
---
* no one can take isk from your wallet                            
---
* no one can touch plex you have        
---
* no one can touch most valuable stuff you can move out in a single JF load ^(aka you can jump out or logout the ship to wait for moving it out safely or letting CCP do it for you after long absence in WH).             
---
Because if you are at 1T and you have like 20bil assets that are potentially in danger ..... then we have nothing to talk about.
---
&gt; was just a random thought.

There's PL Nyxes on my super alt's killmails from Y-JKJ8 as well so yes, they were on grid with them. I don't remember us (the attacker side) using supers in any other engagements.
---
The reason why I mentioned PGL's chimera is that it's one of the more memorable moments from that fight where Legacy attacked the PL staging fort. No chestbeating or anything like that.
---
Though it's understandable why PL left. Goons were pushing hard up north and they put their own space ahead of a trolling campaign down south.
---

---
It is almost impossible to feed off loot and fund PvP with that on a corp/alliance scale.
---
Not sure, if I know of a group that currently lives of PvP. Maybe some kind of very small scale cheap camping/hunting might pay off win vs losses wise. Maybe if you fly only cheap ships, lose them rarely and scoop all the loot, it might work well. That'd something awesome, if sustainable income in standard space was possible. Maybe more people will stop being spodbrain carebears.

REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I'm not sure where you're getting your history from. No one tried to 'twist the knife' on Goons when the Delve drop happened because nobody was actually at war with them at the time. Karttoon just didn't like GS anymore and decided to implode it. Even if anyone wanted to, they immediately regrouped on TCF's couch and so going to try and kill Goons would have meant invading and fighting the entire Northern Coalition, which at the time was the strongest bloc around (Or at least perceived as such).
---
And BoB died to a spy disrupting everything, but they were still hanging in there prior to that, which is why they came back pretty quickly as IT Alliance. They wanted a chance to actually fight to the bitter end, since they weren't actually crushed in combat, yet. If they'd been completely militarily overwhelmed, it might have gone different. We saw that later anyways, with IT Alliance, where the combined weight of TEST+Goons+NC+DRF completely overpowered them, causing them to boil over into infighting and eventually capitulating, which was pretty much the last hurrah of BoB/Kenzoku as an entity. And not really sure what Rise would have become, they were just minor pets and basically amounted to primordial renters.
---
Anyways, the point of this, besides clearing up some history stuff, is that, while you can't kill players... A player's willingness to keep playing, or a group's willingness to continue, can be killed. You don't even need to crush them in a war for that to happen, you just strip away what makes the game enjoyable for them, this thread being a perfect example. SU lost the motivation to play because of the state of affairs, and so just like that, one of the largest powers of the game disappears overnight.

A general rule of thumb with bundles for games, the more you pay, the better deal you get because that's the incentive to pay more. Otherwise, you'd just get more out of buying smaller bundles.
---
Here's a breakdown of the Galaxy pack to give you an idea:  
---
3 months omega -&gt; Around 40$
---
2x multiple character training cert -&gt; They're 485 PLEX each, so I'll add 970 to the total PLEX at the end.
---
1100 PLEX
---
5 Skill extractors -&gt; 25$
---
Skins and other cosmetics -&gt; They don't detail which skins and how many.
---
Total PLEX: 2070. Closest you can get is 2x 40$ PLEX bundle, so 80$
---
Total cost: 40$ + 25$ + 80$ besides cosmetics = 145$. 
---
Since they advertise a total value of 190$, that means around 45$ of skins is included, which you can keep or resell. Let's say we convert it to the 40$ PLEX bundle, to give us an additional 1100 PLEX.
---
Total cost: 190$ value
---
Converting all of that to ISK (let's assume you want to sell everything), this gives you:
---
3 months omega + 2070 PLEX (8.28 bil ISK) + 1100 PLEX estimated value for the skins (4.4 bil ISK) + 5 skill extractors (2.29 bil ISK) = 3 month omega + 14.97 bil ISK
---
The Star Pack is much simpler to calculate. For half of the price of the galaxy pack, you get:  
---
1 month omega
---
2x multiple character training cert 
---
500 PLEX
---
Which totals:  
---
15$ (1 month omega) + 60$ (970 PLEX value for certs + 500 PLEX = 1470 PLEX. Let's say we it equals a 500 PLEX + 1100 PLEX bundle, so 20 + 40$ = 60$) = 80$ value
---
ISK value: 1 month omega + 5.88 bil ISK
---
So for half the price, you get 1 month omega and around a third of the ISK value.
---
The meteor pack includes 1 month omega and 110 PLEX (440 mil ISK) + skins for the Astero (using my very rough conversions, around 960mil) = 1.4 bil for the price of 1 month omega. so you get a quarter of the price for a quartier of the ISK value, so they're roughly equivalent.
---
The alpha pack includes 60 PLEX (240 mil ISK) + 2 daily alpha injector ( 120mil ISK) and a skin that sells for 1mil ISK. So 361m ISK value for 5$. A third of the price for a quarter of the value.
---
Final note: My estimate for the price of the skins was done by taking the price they would cost according to the remainder of the price (since I don't know the contents of the skins), converting that to PLEX and then using that value as the price of the skins. This estimate is probably wildly off. To give you an idea, since they name the Tristan skin in the alpha bundle and calculating that roughly 3.25$ is left in the given 7$ value, this would give a value of 1.3bil ISK to the skin, even if it actually sells for 1 million ISK. The only accurate estimates are for the Star pack and the alpha pack, since their value is known. It's likely that the galaxy pack includes less than 1 billion ISK worth of skins, which would mean you'd get half the ISK for half the price in the star pack, but you also get 2 more months of omega. So yes, the Galaxy Pack is the best value. Although if you spent 100$ (same as the Galaxy Pack) for PLEX instead, you'd get a guaranteed 11.44 bil ISK, but you'd lose out on the 3 months of omega.

&gt; Star Citizen ~~will feast on Eve~~'s bones!
---
lmao are there still people falling for that scam?
---
&gt; our ACLs aren't retarded
---
There's no evidence this is true.
---
I understand you would rather have it say "quiet", but i wanted "quite" instead as in agreeing. I don't like to translate the words from the original video as best i can. But it is all good.
---
It was actually a lot of fun being BL and fighting PL at that time, too.
---
Next level is to teach the 5 year old to make you isk.
---
fix the economical issues (rorqs, fix injectors, make extractors NPC drop only) and reset the server. it's the only way to recover
---
It's possible that was fixed, i kinda don't intend to test it.
---
you gotta admit, its a pretty smart way to reach that outcome
---
There is no arguing the idea is good. I'd do the same meme, if I had an opportunity.
---
null sov is shit lmao
---
hisec incursions used to be extremely good money running with the Valhalla Project , but I think they are defunct now, kinda sad, leaving as far as I know only Warp To Me. I don't know if that is still true, but I know that concord LP is a lot more valuable now so if you can run the sites as fast as you used to, you will be making more.
---
Back then, warp to me were kinda shitters. TVP was a lot more 'elitist' but because of that we would dominate basically every contested site and just make boatloads more isk than them in general. In fleet was chill, friendly guys -  I hope WTM have gotten better in the absence of TVP. 
---
There are also russian groups but they were never really notable, probably because they ran different incursion constellations and timezones. 
---
PROS:  
---
- Fleet work, if you like that kind of stuff, with no strings.
---
- Great ISK/hr. Can't give a number since I can't remember, but probably more than null ratting, maybe even more than super ratting.
---
- Startup capital is very low. Most fleets will let you in with a poverty fit and skilled hyperion (assuming shields which im assuming are unanimously better because of higher damage) until you can get a vindicator or faction battleship, but you will be low priority in "rush hour".
---
- Selling LP is easy, concord LP is very valuable.
---
- Direct pay to wallet from sites on top of LP.
---
CONS:
---
- Fleet work. If you don't like listening to comms, you won't like incursions.
---
- Sometimes you get cucked in contests, shit happens, isk/hr tanks.
---
- Endgame fits are expensive. Sometimes you will lose them to the site, sometimes you will get ganked.
---
- Skill intensive. You are expected to eventually get T2 large guns and battleship V eventually.
---
- Fleet work. You need to have fleet members, if noone's on, you arent making any isk/hr.
---
- Travel. Incursions often spawn in the ass end of space opposite the ass end of space you just cleared. Lots of travel, hauling expensive mods... it's risky and boring.

---
Which also looks like wormhole region/constellation names!
---
EVE client (code from which i am not going to publish due to obvious reasons) has function "IsWormholeSystem" which returns true for all systemIDs in range \[31000000, 31999998\], and Thera's ID is  31000005.
---
So far it looks like some people have their minds set on opposite, but you have to face it: anyone who lives in thera, lives in w-space.
---
Ok great
---
Yeah, totally this. I'm pretty space poor (by comparrison to most nullsec folk). I left the game for a bit and came back to find all my stuff in asset safety and had to find the 10bill to get it all back. It was a shock, for sure.  
---
If they made citadels drop a % of the loot they contained and destroyed the rest, in the same way as ships, the goons would simply steam roller about destroying all citadels because there would be an isk reason to do so. It would be pretty terrible.
---
So uhh, you tackled two cruisers in a 7km/s garmur until they got blobbed?
---
sure if you don't fly solo...
---
let me guess: wormholer
---
PLEX, abyssal sites, PvP loot. Most areas have there own isk making specificities (HS have incursions, LS and NPC NS have missions, WH have good combat sites)
---
You have my upvote good sir.
---
ive bashed pocos in my time,
---
i remember my abaddon burnt crystals at an incredibly slow rate,
---
burnt through about 3.5 sets of crystals on my Armageddon in the time one set went on the abaddon.
---
both used triple heat sink, both had polerised guns.
---
Provi, we did PVP, PVE, raided WHs, roamed Low Sec, formed little fun fleets, created defence fleets.
---
It wasn't all rage pings, there was loads of content flying into the region all the time.
---
haha ye real job would be nice, my physical health is not so good at the moment unfortunately, so have had to stop work...   ‚Ä¶. that's why I am thinking of eve again as its a good time sink and will stop me from getting bored.

---
Correction.
---
ye i usto make each months plex from doing pve scan sites in a t3... but no access to null or worm space any more :/
---
This game is heavy into the nonconsensual PVP with dick and dash tactics, makeing it so anyone who memes eventually gets memed on.
---
I love the game for that, but it doesn't mean the advantage isn't there.
---
If your point is that people who don't know what they're doing die more often, then sure.
---
If you honestly think being able to buy shit with cash isn't a pay to win aspect of this game then you're wrong.
---
So terrible organizational structure leads to one man being able to rob the alliance. Yes that would make it not fun anymore.
---
all the issues the game has, this is not one of it...
---
Suitonia flew geddon with 2 hyper rigs solo with some success couple of years ago.
---
I think solo BS are barely viable due to reasons other than warp speed, mostly because caps get dropped on your face way too often.
---
Dunno, I must have missed that part. I haven't played super consistently though, so I can only think of them doing that to HERO which must have been 2014 or 2015 or so. Which was shitty and I still don't understand what that was all about, but, I'm not really defending them either. Just pointing out to the guy above that Grath isn't BSing, and that it wasn't even really until N3PL that they were an oppressive force.
---
Strange, I always managed it before. Then again, I didn't need or want 5 titans.
---
He's... Right though? We have NPC Delve right there where our shit would be 100% safe. Not every null entity has this.
---
Nah, next level is to teach the 5 year old to steal the spouse's credit card and do the dirty deed, that way my hands are completely clean.
---
i think what your replyee means is, that CCP noticed this trend you mentioned and started catering to that playergroup. in the process they alienated the existing playerbase (cause niche games have niche communities).
---
I was wondering why it wasnt working. Cheers for the update, and for the shiny new graphs!
---
You know nothing.  
---
Why are you crying for a reset? Set your own goals and achieve them like everyone else before. Just wiping the playing field is like a 5yo who is loosing a game of Risk.
---
I did say that i disliked plex too.
---
I recognize that the game won't change in the drastic ways i just suggested but I think the game might be better if it had a while ago.
---
you can't change player behavior but you can always change mechanics.
---
soo... now?...please?...
---
ye totaly its about the fun and not the grind :D :D
---
do you find its totaly playable with alpha only?
---
haha ye :D
---
I'm gonna need some links here buddy
---
From my point of view, when I was a new player in a High Sec corp, we were having wars declared on us all the time. It was frustrating, we couldn't grow, people kept leaving because we were getting slaughtered and ganked.
---
Finally, we managed to scrape it together and went to a C2 worm hole, if we hadn't have moved out of High Sec, the corp would surely have died.
---
Was CODE. and others simply kicking in the faces of the babies that were trying to learn to swim in the paddling pool?
---
I buy local ice in 3 regions, refine, ship isotopes, produce fuel, profit
---
Yes certainly much easier doing it small first. 
---
I know from personal experience that Karmafleet and Goonswarm will teach. Karmafleet even for a while and maybe still are giving out a fair bit of isk just for fc‚Äôing a fleet and writing up and AAR for it.
---
There is a special interest group for the alliance that is for specifically mentoring new FCs. They have their own chat room and can back seat non-strat op fleets of more senior FCs and then they‚Äôll discuss things in the leadership comms during the fleet to help you along. Then you‚Äôll have those senior FCs backseat your fleets to help if you need it. Eventually if you show promise and commitment to it they start giving newer FCs fleets for organized ops and then working your way up the isk ladder of fleets. 
---
So that‚Äôs how it works in Goons. I‚Äôm very sure many other corps around will show you too. It is quite structured in Goonswarm.

I do have a skillfarm but i cannot be bothered to do all the clicking for such a small profit.  It is actually time consuming and annoying if you have to extract 3 chars per account.
---
The only chars I keep extracting are my specialized toons i actually use.

I multi-box subcaps in C5 sites, 1-2b/hr.

Thank you, I do see that now.

Bit too late for this post, oh well.

It is safe. 
---
When you aren't retarded. Lmao.
---
The only real way to make big isk outside of a Corp is working the market.  Market speculation mainly, watching trends, stocking up on things that will be in higher demand soon, etc.  I made a trillion in Jita before I even left to join a nullsec Corp (over the course of a year and a half, it wasn‚Äôt quick... it was more a ‚Äúhave eve up on a second monitor while I play other games thing‚Äù.  Then a couple years ago, I bought a combat pilot off the bazaar that could already fly everything, headed out for nullsec, and can basically do whatever I want, fly whatever I want.
---
Then again, Mebbe he won‚Äôt. You assumption that he will request another reset is a really big leap
---
Probably for the same reason that we were making a mistake by not using our supercapitals in 2016, yet it's a bold strategic stroke for them to withhold supers today.
---
But balancing everything around what goons could do is silly. Having any sort of motivation to destroy citadels is better than what we have now.
---
because it mines about 600% more than an Orca?
---
and the boosts are about 50% better? 
---
and it can PANIC
---
and it has about 500% the dps
---
and 300% the tank
---
and it can jump out?
---
The orca is pretty garbage.  Basically just a porpoise with better tank which in null is useless.
---
Yep. Catering toward shortsighted KPI's instead of listening to the bigger problems!
---
All good bro.
---
yup, nerf to indy, mission accomplished.
---
I disagree with the other dude, I would say medium fleets are the easiest, and by that I mean between 15 and 30 fleet members. With fleets that size, you need a doctrine, and doctrines simplify things considerably. You will generally have a mainline DPS ship, a logistics ship, and tackle. So effectively, you are only in command of three different ship types.
---
Your main line is much tankier as they don't have to spend valuable fitting slots for tackle or nanofibers. You can get away with flying a cheap doctrine such as T1 cruisers or battlecruisers. And you are harder to pin down, because incoming hostile tackle has to deal with 10 or 20 of your DPS ships instead of just a few. 
---
Small gangs are a completely different type of gameplay. Your composition is not nearly as homogenous - with 8 people in fleet, you might have 8 completely different ships. Each ship has to perform at least two roles - for example, tackle and DPS. You have to deal with all these different roles in your fleet. And if you slip up just a little bit and someone gets scrammed at the wrong time, you lose a key part of your gang, because every ship is a key part. Osprey Navy gets caught and dies? That's a quarter of your DPS gone. Interceptor gets volleyed off? You don't have any bonused points anymore, etc. etc. 
---
Get 15 dudes together, put 10 of them in thoraxes, 2 or 3 in exequerors and the rest in interceptors and you got yourself a handy dandy little fleet that you can whelp without any regrets, as all the ships are basically free.

---
Also let's be honest, in order for that to actually make a change (besides making the blue doughnut even bigger, by making the weaker, but still large groups, even more weak) would be doing this as part of an alliance in the dominant bloc.
---
And then you run into the issue of, why would anyone do that? What incentive do any of them have to throw away safety, prosperity, and a seat at the table that's currently in the dominant position? Especially because currently, the dominant powers aren't exactly hardcore PvPers that thrive off risks and adversity. It's miners, PvEers, strength in numbers type folk, empire builders, that kind of thing. Right now they're getting exactly the content they want and play for, leaving with a small group of people to try and start from scratch and shake things up is the exact opposite of an incentive for them.
---
WH kreb, epic arcs (I just find them fun), loot from pew pew. 
---
So long as I stayed in null, making isk was a grind. I went full-on PVP mode in 2013 and now I've got like 50 bil worth of stuff sitting around, despite untold billions whelped.
---
Any competent PVP entity survives on a solid foundation of isk-making; if you join a good group, they'll hook you up with ways to make isk. Whether it's abyssal sites, explo, WH krabbing, burner or L5 missions. You won't have the same ability to rat 24/7, but then again, you won't burn yourself out ratting.
---
We in our corp do t4 abyssals with 3 hawks, not the best isk but its alright, probs 150m/hr and you dont sit and bore yourself.
---
Was a good fight, originally we were a pure third party but the fight looked over before we arrived so we convoed the outnumbered side (CVA) and said we wouldn't shoot them in the interest of getting a fight.  
---
We took a good few losses but fighting outnumbered wasn't easy :)
---
Combat sites is my big income. Planetary interaction comes in a steady 2nd and then mining a 3rd. I don't count anything dropped as loot from pvp as income. 
---
Thought about doing abyssal sites, even did a few, but then that database error happened and I dropped it completely. Luckily I was not in one at the time.
---
I thought that you were with CVA for this timer

Except for the ammount of isk entering the game. They have to limit inflation titans and super ticks are to to big be sustainable.
---
Settle down, they weren't even your titans.
---
Pirate L4 Burners, Lowsec L5 Missions, T4/5 Abyssals, and combat exploration in the Drone regions. At one point I had a C5 farm, then sold it, and then did the whole hobodreading. Sold those nags eventually, though. Lastly, hunting krab VNIs nets me some decent loot in the form of faction drones and faction modules (Some people choose to pimp their AFK VNIs for whatever reason).
---
I have around 30B in liquid (and around 100b in assets) at any given time. It's not a lot compared to many people, but it's plenty and then some for me as I don't generally fly capitals or excessively blingy ships and can easily replace what I need to if I am ever low on ISK. I only krab maybe a day or two out of the month.
---
I think the biggest difference is that Eve victories are as a rule more about morale then material factors. The battle of UALX did not meaningfully change how much materiel that the Legacy or Fraternity side had available and while UALX itself allowed better supercapital projection that itself doesn't win you a war. Ultimately what happened was that Triumvirate, PL and SkillU didn't want to play anymore.
---
A few hundred million isk an hour is reasonable if you get a lucky streak. I've had a Serpentis Phi-Outpost (4/10) drop nearly 300m by itself, Corelum C-type 50mn Mwd and Corelum C-type Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane. That took me under 20min to run.

This. That's the problem, is something has to put pressure on the big blocks. There are cracks, but they aren't enough to cause them to fragment. There needs to be a big shakeup that makes it MUCH more costly to operate this way, without easy logistical workarounds.
---
Yup. Phoebe made a lot of good things happen.

Not originally - it was just as Dark Shines described it in his reply on this thread

Bots have a very easy time escaping those ganks, but you still run into the occasional non bot in VNIs and Ishtars. Sadly for our standing fleet the easiest place to find nonbots is esoteria lol. How do I know they're not bots? They scream in fleet 6 when they're tackled. Also they're always tackled.
---
My favorite fights were when we'd be in Maelstroms volleying carriers and dreads in lowsec over some random R64 or 32.  Great times

Your t3cs were tough to break!
---
I haven't really gotten a lot of enjoyment out of that war. FRT has started dropping small groups of supers on solo assault frigates, and trying to ragecage every pipe system. They fight boring, and every time we win a timer, or catch a super, or even a damn rattlesnake they adjust to more bots and more boredom.
---
I find maybe one human ratter a week, and no defensive solo roamers.
---
I go roam esoteria in an assault frig and I can get 1v1s with goon roamers all the damn time. Slightly less boring.
---
They live in Thera though so they are fake wormholers.
---
Is your Corp active or accepting new players? I‚Äôve been looking for a Corp to rat/pvevp in for a while. (Only 60 hours in game)
---
Unfortunately or luckily I don't have kids and I'm not sure she'd believe it was the dog
---
Yes, but I'm also limited to the things I can do. Sometimes a pain in the ass, since I can't fly most of the ships for the fleets or being more helpful in my alliance and/or corp. So my help mostly is ratting and exploring for the industry folks. Still, I have fun. 
---
But to be honest, i'm planning going Omega in July. I'm close to the 5mil SP Limit and after a Year I'm still playing. I just didn't want to go omega and then stop after a few weeks. 
---
I could probably continue playing as an alpah, without any problems, but if I would start with a new Charakter now, I would choose a direction I want to go and train for that.
---

As of our fights with them last weekend, French Connection appear to be blue to Fraternity. Not sure why small gangs would temp blue for skirmishing with our small gangs, so...pretty sure they're just pets now. No real idea \_WHY\_.
---
Scalding Pass has guys that aren't blue to Frat? That sounds like a fun place to solo if true. I was not aware of these.
---
Fade is cool. The north is falling apart and could be a great place to be.
---
Funnily enough I recognise the name from a few BB fleets, they sure don't like you trying to catch the stragglers
---
Frig FW is super hit or miss right now. On the weekends in USTZ it's nothing but cloakies, curses, and super drops, and the frigate meta is extremely unbalanced. Cruisers might be fun, but they're very easy to catch. I'm starting to see why a lot of our solo guys going to facwar only fly destroyers and assault frigates right now - if it can win a small plex 1v1, you can evade a lot of the big trouble, and the only game breaker is the kiki at that point.
---
I have thought about moving into a WH, so C3 would be a good start. What sort of statics would be the best to have?

Thanks for such a well thought out and articulate post. I tend to agree with your sentiments. We need more posts of this nature to at least force CCP to take notice.

[Crushes popcorn] "glorious"
---
I live in an area of NPC Null sec which is fairly untouched by the big sov blobs.
---
The way I make the majority of my isk is through exploration, running sites and pvp (although sometimes the pvp can go the other way).
---
Depending on where you do it, exploration can be very profitable, in some areas of NPC Null sec the relic sites can be very lucrative and I‚Äôve had anywhere from 30-150 mil per relic site. With decent skills and experience you can scan these down and have the site completed within a couple minutes and depending on how many sites you find, you can make some good isk.
---
Alongside scanning for relic sites, you can also find combat sites, some you are better off ignoring but there are a couple that are worth running for their loot and bounty value. It depends on the site but you can run the majority in a tengu.
---
Both of these methods depend where you live since the sites vary depending on the region so may not be as profitable.
---
Long time no SHIME, you guys are still alive?
---
Only three options, and they just described why they like low sec. Maybe you could run relic sites out of a null static or hunt VNIs. High sec gets you...convenience?
---
The rule is alphas and omega cant benon the same PC not ip. So in theory you could have a whole alpha farm of dif pcs and still not be breaking the eula.. 
---
Altho im sure ccp is considering how many is to many to have open on alt pc's so in would wager your safe. I use my wifes pc for hauling and havent been banned yet.

Yeah not a ton compared to people that have played longer. Probably like 15-16b of assets vulnerable

I mean I get what you're saying but it sure beats another "Look I drew spaceships" or "O7, alliance x is disbanding" thread. Far too many of those lately.
---
Just what this thread needed
---
I would recommend a C2 or lowsec static, HS statics are great for logistics but attract a lot of traffic from day-trippers. C2 statics allow for the good possibility of a direct connection to HS without the immediate downsides of a HS connection in your home hole.
---
The Lowsec static makes logistics a little bit more dangerous but serves similar benefits as the C2 static while also allowing for FW roaming when the connection is good.
---
Anyone use or have in the past used the full Virtue set (Mid-Grade if possible)?
---
I'm considering it for my scanning alt, but I want to know does it really make that much of a difference
---
My scanning skills are near---but not quite at---max (Astrometric Pinpointing, training, 6 days left to V, still need to train the scan time one)
---
Wormholer btw
---
I really get bored fast with PVE so i need to diversify a lot. I live in npc nullsec and i do faction lvl 4 missions. But after a while it gets boring so i do some abyss for a while or exploration. Maybe get a lucky DED site and so on. By doing a rotation on my pve income i manage to keep it a bit entertaining. So misisons and Abyss are my main thing.

TQ has not been "inching closer" to Serenity as much as it has been "catapulted towards" Serenity.
---
Everyone wants to believe their shitty game is someone else's fault. The great irony is that their desire for a daddy to make everyone play by their utopian rule-set is exactly why they hate the game.
---
The closest I‚Äôve come to making money from salvaging was picking up 5 miner drone 2s after a huge mining op left them sitting there lol. Only came out to like... maybe 1.2 million? It ain‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs honest work!
---
I have several, mostly mwd disrupt web saar dual nos
---
Just throw a VNI into horde.
---
Incursions are pretty easy/boring unless they have been changed since I was still active.
---
I assume beams then since they lack a range bonus? Or are you trying to play in closer with scorch? I may have to try this.
---
Ow, C3's only have one static? I've only lived in a C2 which had two, just presumed they all did
---
How on earth do you get this much? I'm still new and dont have a clue what's going on.
---
CCP puts in gate from stain to nearby amarr space.
---
Gate leads to a single, previously undiscovered 0.3 system named Trollin.
---
The 0.3 system has only one other gate.
---
This gate also leads to stain.
---
CCP be like, "We heard you, and we delivered.  Youre welcome."
---
Have you even thought about this at all?
---
This biggest problem "coalition" right now is the TAPIPERIUM or whatever the name. And as every TEST member will tell you, they aren't officially blue in ingame standings.
---
Your proposal would change nothing. They still would be allied without being "blue" ingame, just like before.
---
Don't the Tuskers live in a WH and do probably solo and small gang roams?
---
And you are wasting my time.
---
Oh my.. Good thing EvE isnt owned and run by the US government. International internet laws hahaha that's pretty fucking cute
---
C2/Low also gets you on the C2/Low superhighway, so if you need to get anywhere, your worst outlook is probably half a dozen kspace jumps.
---
Lowsec is good for me as I enjoy lowsec pvp but dislike nullsec pvp. VNI's and tackle killing is not my jam. 
---
That said a nullsec static opens you up to ninja running nullsec sites and even Ishtar ratting botting space until someone swings by to shoo you away.
---
If you like to blops a nullsec static is solid for that as well.
---
HS is super easy for logistics and you can camp your static to club seals. But also likely to find a lot of nasties crawling through.
---
Only C2s and C4s have multiple. C1s and C3s always have a k-space. C2s are k-space and w-space. C4s are two w-space.
---
BAG8‚Äôs frog eater feel sad not to be here :p
---
Market trading and PvP loot
---
I dunno anything about this and Youtube battles do not concern me particularly, but I do think you should make an effort to make your blog post readable: honestly I'm left with the impression you're a dumb crybaby that can't even make a point in written english.
---
Everyone hoarded them to bloat prices before the new trig ships came out. Now they're selling them off again so prices went back to normal.
---
This is very true. :)
---
does it tho
---
Goons will turn on legacy and finally complete the donut,
---
Yes, thank you for posting today's version of "Eve is dead""goonswarm is killing the game". Take your tin foil hat, and go play a single player game with cheat codes. We all know how you love your power fantacies.
---
Sell them on the market
---
The hole I am referencing is a C3, it only has 1 static connection so you get to pick either, not both and C2 holes have a high chance of landing a HS connection. 
---
My preference of a C2 hole is a C5 and null static, plenty of krab and plenty of pew.
---
Freedom of speech does not mean you get to doxx folk.
---
Aye, very true. Especially now. In the past, a group could be broken, even with high morale if they simply didn't have the isk to wage war anymore, but the amount of assets held by blocs now makes morale the only resource of importance.
---
Given the distance from those 2 power blocs, who the fuck is going to contest it? It's gonna be Mad Max up there.
---
There is no right to free speech on the internet.
---
Wait was skillu eve a player on the board they basically just rented space from what i remember.
---
I got you b
---
&gt;So the tops took all the money and RMTd it, right?
---
Ya
---
You are a nutjob and seriously need help.
---
That's the biggest difference I found between bloc and small alliance gameplay. People are way less focused on making isk and prefer high isk/h activities that may not be as available as rorqs but require less time spent on krabbing, while in nullsec alliances it's "normal" to just have rorqs in a belt 24/7.
---
Logibros were heroes that day.  We had a bit of a trek from Hakonen, but it was worth it.
---
You fucked up, you're banned. Make a new account and go by the rules or shut up. You're making an ass of yourself.
---
Good to know thanks. 
---
Like I put in the edit that's the only part I can find about it, but it didn't say if it was aloud over multiple pc's or not :/
---
Heck I remember when I usto play lots of people would have a 30 day alt for scouting and such... but I guess its changed now you can do more for free :/
---
There are better ways to burn a toon than this tbh.
---
Wormholes, L5 missions, burner missions, abyssal stuff are all ways to make pretty big isk without a corp.
---
Yes, and if you have either a C2 or a Low static, you will be able to find a lot of C2s and C2/Lows and go anywhere.
---
C2 with a C5/Null is interesting, tbh.
---
I feel like there's a Wile E Coyote analogy in there somewhere but I'm too tired to work it out
---
Freedom of speech only protects you against government persecution not privately owner companies. 1/10 bad troll. 0/10 intelligence.
---
This must be something you think about too much.
---
Where does it say "goonswarm" anywhere in the post or title?  Reading comprehension, yo!
---
I dunno, we get a good fight out of them now and again. Mostly RvB and The Russia these days though.
---
Imho the best group are the Tuskers, they know exactly which fights they take. A few days ago they kept harrassing theregion I live in and basically killed everyone they came across. There's only few groups me or my corp runs from by default.
---
i do offer myself as a hat yes but beware i am itching
---
Thanks to the good lord for the silent knights subchannel
---
Only if the catapult says "Acme products" on it.
---
Give me a Triglavian themed Chronicle to record. Please.
---
commenting in a meme post
---
Dont feel bad for bunch of cowards, because cowards never win.
---
thank, off into the rabbithole I go :D
---
It's kind of fun to live in the C2 with the C5/Null links, I can roll the holes and secure the C5 for krab times or rage roll the Null to find juicy kills on Null krabs without instantly getting super dropped or Titan camped.
---
I can also roll the C5's static for wormhole PVP if I am inclined.
---
What tattoo does one merit for losing not one but two titans to a tgrad FC?
---
It's fucking spooky how deep the parallels are.
---
The end times are near!
---
Rage was an inside job! Jump fuel can't melt alloyed tritanium bars!
---
I feel it really difficult to find a corporation to play with, any tipps from veterans?
---
Nah. You can't be ultra safe in WH. It's about some kind of probability. Maybe you have one or maybe two k162 where you are ratting. Maybe they head to c5, or maybe to c2. Maybe they are further than 14 AU to see someone just dscanning. Maybe there is someone there in a T3 cloaky, or just in an Astero and won't engage you, or there's nobody since hours ago. So every detail counts in, and it's hard to know if you're safe or not. That's the best thing of being in WH. But I think that all you do is fine, but you won't be able to be completely safe, accept that. Just try to farm more isk than you will lose, because you will.
---
Yes. A lot of wormhole groups do this, lowsec groups will raid null, and corps/sigs do raiding operations as well. I run small gang ops out of Dreddit that hits the other large nullsec groups. It's a little different since we're part of TEST, but we're a small group within it.  
---
Absolutely exists, people are afraid of it, do it.
---
Yeah pretty much.
---
Oh man, I thought we were rid of your lunacy the last time you made some asinine post in this subreddit. I guess you didn't get the message last time, let me sum it up for you:
---
No one likes you.
---
No one cares.
---
Fuck off.
---
i think weve lost the war Shines we best eveac because we dont have ACLs sorted on every structure
---
Our Logistic wing made a terrific job in that fight. CVA and Init fleets were caling diferent targets primary at the same time so was hard as hell to our logi bros to attend the repair calls from 2 diferent guys at the same time.
---
A horde of mouth-breathers in Atrons can do some pretty cool shit. 
---
Def not from experience.
---
My alliance is, just message me your ingame name and i'll ask them to contact you.
---
I'm just a filthy casual EVE capsulier but i think the triglavian invasion can be a great tool to make some noise in null. With phase 3 (?) triglav caps, titans and maybe even bigger ships just clean regions of null. Burn everything. It could cause power fluctuation in the big corps and incite smaller corps to use this as an advantage. Ofc in time players will defeat the triglavs somehow. Maybe with some sort of story elements.
---
I dont know the meta and i dont have the knowledge of an EVE veteran, but looks like the main problem is the stagnation.
---
And sorry for my english, its not the best. üòÖ
---
Trust me that asset safety will cost me waaay more, and we are talking about stuff that is hard to move.      
---
Like you don't want to move those 140 freighter hauls.
---
Ya but who cares? Only fly what you can afford to lose? A lossmail isn't the end of the world.
---
&gt;Real men keep assets in WH cits.           
---
This sounds just like no one is doing this.
---
I follow around a guy who rats (kills pirate npc's) pretty intensely when he's online. Since he doesn't salvage the wrecks he leaves behind, I get to do it,  it can be pretty lucrative.
---
I ammassed that amount of salvage in a bit over a week.
---
This. 
---
It's amazing how many people think FoS allows them to spout their verbal diarrhea everywhere.
---
Also OP, Eve is probably a better place cause you seem like an unpleasant person.
---
Most fun fleet fight in a good while, thanks to all involved for bringing it.
---
imagine being so shit you're roasted by LORDE and buttblasted into wasting months for a single spy bubble
---
SkillU space was the worst part of Eve.  100% renters and essentially all Bots.  Any change to that is for the better.
---
tldr;
---
&gt;Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
---
&gt;Eleven months ago I was involved, personally with another YouTuber in a copyright dispute over the use of content from one of my own videos in his
---
the person who wrote the article doesnt realize they a hypocrite. 
---
also, he got banned for doxxing someone.  you know, illegal.  hell its illegal in the US,  in the EU its even worse. they have that whole right to be forgotten stuff which means its very illegal to dox.
---
and finally, he never read the game's ToS.  or the fact freedom of speech doesn't protect you from private companies. only government
---
Yea between alphas and injectors/extractors alts are super cheap these days.
---
yeah frat are definitely the ones making eve like serenity
---
Dows this mean they will finally set those pilots who are awoxing their values KOS? Oh wait. That's the list which doesnt matter much since you can just pay ISK to CVA to get off of it should they choose to let you pay.
---

Abyssal pvp
---
Semi-agk VNI rattling. With max drone skills yields you 20M ticks (54-60M/hr) and you should just move it to another anom when it is done or when hostiles are in local. Laziest method.
---
Rorqual yields you 120-135 worth of ore per hour depending on the ore anoms type and their security status.
---
Id love to play on eve classic. It would attract two crowds the newbies because less catchup to do and the hardcore players because of a fresh competition.
---
You'll have to pick that one up with PL lol.
---
Worst PL.
---
ha, dont like the rules of the game then dont play that game
---
C6, lvl 5 missions, unfortunately both require multi chars, multi caps, but isk is nice 1-4b per hour
---
Much worse. Period Basis doesnt get caught too much. Fraternity has been around for what 2-3 years and already comprises of 5% of all of the bots banned since like 2008? Whatever dev showed the graph a few months ago.
---
People really think freedom of speech means freedom from repercussions for what they say. Depending on the countrys laws it usually just means you cant be jailed for what you say, and even then there's exceptions
---
God damn it PL... See what you did? Now we gotta listen to init brag about this for the next month and hear them try to spin it as a story to some gullible no name writer about how this took 1 whole day to plan...
---
Delete this. This is bad. You are bad.

yeeet

Frat Uni and Frat Treasury are just botting corps

Reaction time, behaviour in local, etc.

You did, Alliances cannot.
---
With this brought up would the company home country be the base line for anything on the net?
---
Don't you need to be blue to hard kbocks to rub burner mission?
---
Watch as the goon recoils at the implication that maybe his alliance being a huge part of the growing blue donut might not be what's best for the game! Sad!
---
Are the invasions dropping all the regular trig space loot?
---
We will definitely see more Chinese in local
---
Damn, you're salty
---
I don't. Unless NC. is somehow not a major alliance anymore.
---
SkillU weren't shitty crabs and didn't live in their space since they were more occupied with pvp
---
Woah is this a new br tool? Looks different.
---
Yeah, something more elaborate would of been great, but I'm limited in how much time I can invest, and keeping the spy running was getting tiring. Had fun with the way it turned out.
---
r/evejobs is a subreddit that is for recruitment for eve corps.
---
US didn't even sign it and the clown screeching is a US citizen
---
Backstory?
---
Wow, this seems like a pretty decent BR tool
---
I was thinking that they wont be able fly a titan (as i said in newish, and i dont really know how the T3Ds mechanics work) but also this could work as an effective way to implement an ISK sink imo.
---
Didn't you quit the game? Or was that someone else?
---
no it fucking isn't you idiot
---
i'm in goons and have never mined or ratted in delve
---
rorq isk is fucking trash and super ratting is only decent if you only have 1 or 2 accounts
---
They aren't wrong that they are entitled to use the game mechanics to their advantage.  They are also not right that that doesn't mean the mechanics shouldn't be changed because they are doing so.
---
Jump fatigue came as a response to the titan/cap teleportation by the masters of eve of that time as well.
---
Home of the not free, land of the angry men
---
No, they didn't have to be 'shitty crabs' they rented their space to bots who would do the 'shitty crab' for them
---
:) Months weren't wasted though. The spy got into LORDE by shear luck and zero effort from myself. I hadn't even logged in for weeks before I realised it had happened.
---
wow look at that, You are still dumb as fuck. no way
---
1. Go to a heavily ganked high sec system, put a cloaked hauler on a busy gate and try to steal the loot from gankers. 
---
2. Put an alpha VNI character in a null sec block and rat.
---
3. Trading.
---
lmao stop pretending to know anything retard. 
---
The only viable way to make isk is in null blocs,High,Low and wh just can't compete.
---
Well what else are you supposed to do with 1/4 of the nullsec systems in the game when you're a PVP alliance?
---
muhahahaha.  what?  they ran the biggest botting rental program in eve!  they were terrible for the game. 
---
and SkillU did jack shit for content.  They showed up once in the southern war, lost, and then gave up like a bunch of pussies.
---
Yeah it's a good point I guess those bots will all just unsub now and never playing eve online again.
---
and Planetside
---
I have a dream where one day we can autopilot ships to escalations without needing travel fits.
---
I have a dream where one day every ship from the north to the west will never fit em hardeners.
---
I have a dream where kinetic hardeners have zero market sales volume in the south.
---
I have a dream where T3s only need the covert sub systems to boost hacking and scanning mods.
---
I have a dream.
---
Wow, truth hurts huh boys? -20 in a flash
---
The end war is near. If I was to guess it will be the remnants of panfam and WinterCo vs imperium and legacy. Now the question is where does deadco and the other of the drone lands stand in this.
---
SkillU were shit for content because we kept losing to them on equal grounds, and they would never fight our supers &gt;:(
---
SkillU failing is a step in the right direction.  The last thing we needed was a huge rental area with a shit ton of bots.  maybe it won't change, but anything is better than the status quo.
---
Keep those downvotes coming, I enjoy being right.
---
Or they krab in tinker nestors
---
Highsec moons are as good as WH, and safer.
---
They could have shot the bots
---
There are none on market my homie bro
---
If by "anything" you mean a shit ton of bots with chinese characters.  Have you flown through Frat space?
---
Seems like a waste of time to be honest
---
How foolish must you be to believe there's no room in the game for small scale focused activities? IF it's either go big or go home, THAT'S HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE YOU TWAT
---
We just want to make sure you don't run out of torpedoes.
---
Yup mine is 48 bill isk negative
---
All I could think of was dahmer. i don't think the menu is the same
---
Deploying to ur own space to kill 75m VNIs that can easily just join Goons/Test/Frat/PL rental alliances and bot just as safely is great fun
---
So, you tried to get a low-effort spy into an enemy alliance, and failed.
---
Then you tried again, and got a low-effort spy into an enemy alliance.
---
Then you bubbled a irrelevant fleet once with your low-effort spy.
---
Then you posted on Reddit.
---
"huh."
---
But GDPR still must be adhered to for CCP. Of the servers were based out of the US they could just not comply but unfortunately have to comply since the servers are based out of London.
---
Yea, FRT moving in isn't any better, but also not any worse than it was.  And maybe, just maybe, things will change.  Possibly the Mangos go after FRT in the dronelands.  Anything to shake things up is good for eve.  Boring ass rental empires and RMT rental managers is a big part of what is killing the game.
---
Nicely done!
---
Sadly there will never be that Endgame last battle.  We had that in WWB (where everyone joined for the huge funs).  Without any other change in the playerbase or environment all future wars will look like this last one.  If the dominant entity decides to fight someone or take some space, those people will pack up their toys and go.  They might form some harassing fleets, or annoy people with Corms or something, figure they won if they made someone chase them, but there will be no war.
---
   Which is really sad because the big wars were what fascinated the rest of the world, and how so many of us nerds heard about eve in the first place.
---
the o has an umlaut over it so its pronounced "doener"
---
Have a look in your laptop bios settings and see if you can force it to the discrete gpu, rather than use on-board.
---
No sarcasm tags but, I totally get you üòä
---
So literally only fleets all the way? Isk payout must be abysmal.
---
Get it? Trigs? Abyssal? Abysmal?
---
Ok I'll see myself out.
---
SkillU was about 40 guys and a fuckton of bots
---
Death to pvp
---
The paragraph about plexing is pretty stupid. If plexing for cash is p2w, how is plexing for ISK not? In order for you to plex with ISK, someone must've bought the plex with cash. See the fallacy?
---
If anything, you're at fault, because you're keeping the only form of RMT alive which is allowed by CCP.
---
I prefer to sub my 2 accounts via plex by cash and be redeemed from the necessity of making the game a full time job in order to maintain my Omega.
---
Why did you just edit out that they were pussies vs you in PvP?
---
Nuking their molok would be cooler
---
Asset safety is broken. Yeah, I get it. There are a lot of people who don't want to have all of their stuff disappear when they move to NULL.
---
I get that your assets still technically existed, though were inaccessible after losing a station. You still most likely had to pay someone to smuggle it out or firesold it for a bigger loss than 15%.
---
What I think needs to happen is asset safety should become free to retrieve... IF the assets survive the loot fairy pickings. If your structure is destroyed, your items should be subject to a 20% chance of being dropped or destroyed. Anything that scores 21% or higher in the roll gets transported to a nearby NULL or Lowsec NPC station list that you can select from.
---
Asset safety should NOT be allowed to be used as an NPC hauler mechanic. The only time it activates should be when your structure is destroyed.
---
If loot has a chance or dropping, we might see fewer of the structure spam we have now because it might actually be worth grinding their timers.
---
Personally, I'd just as soon not have asset safety at all and think loot should drop or be destroyed based on current loot mechanics. If Asset Safety must remain, though, it should have a risk of losing your favorite toy, not just paying a small fee to have it returned.
---
I don't think he's necessarily saying that, just that it may be another bad thing for the overall health of the game (a medium-sized semi-independent PvP group has left the game, anyone who remains will merge into large blocs). 
---
All of the things happening lately somewhat swings the balance of power towards the Imperium/Legacy blob.
---
OOOOOH I remember you now... So you were the obvious spy that came in my channel with a 20mill sp requirment, tried to act like a noob while knowing a lot of eve's terminology. So we just told you to fuck off and go back to high sec. Shame that you got in that corp even tho we told them to purge the inactives before joining...
---
tldr; players with low skill points are still valuable and useful.
---
something BRAVE, KARMAFLEET, and HORDE all found out.
---
If they catch you in covops, you fucked up bad.
---
I guess we just need to get better at Reddit PvP ~~propaganda~~ and to start sharing stories of GFs we had with RC &amp; friends in addition to  memes... like the previous clash over YW sov from few days ago [https://br.inyour.space/?s=3706&amp;b=8647440&amp;e=90&amp;t=avafqf](https://br.inyour.space/?s=3706&amp;b=8647440&amp;e=90&amp;t=avafqf)  or yesterday's RC &amp; Spectre engagement [https://br.inyour.space/?s=3769,3486&amp;b=8655590,8655530&amp;e=1470,1535&amp;t=qfuuvubqveeaqaq](https://br.inyour.space/?s=3769,3486&amp;b=8655590,8655530&amp;e=1470,1535&amp;t=qfuuvubqveeaqaq)
---
Bottomline... you win some, you lose some... it's all in good fun.
---
FXR's main activity has been in the north, with a small longbow fleet in Feyth. Why would they have blue standings with Fraternity, who live in the southeast?
---
Scalding Pass entities that are openly hostile to FRAT:
---
- Bright Side of Death
---
- Toilet Paper.
---
- Parasitic Legion (They have a meme system in SP)
---
Well. If you don't see it yourself, I can't help you, I guess.
---
Eve has always been a game, where YOU decide, how you want to play it. Seems like you don't bother to search for fun, but complain nontheless.
---
You're the retarded player here, my friend.
---
I love the idea of shaking things up and I DO think it is good.  But this change looks like you now have:
---
- 1 alliance controlling huge rental space instead of 2 alliances controlling that same space.
---
- 1 less group of dedicated PvP players (and assuredly some will quit since their friends moved on).
---
This but unirionically
---
I have absolutely no idea why they would but they were fighting our small gangs alongside them a few times in the past week.
---
LOL Bright Side of Death is still around?
---
because it was off topic to your original post.  But yes, they did pussy out after one loss.  SkillU were a pretty solid pvp group prior to becoming a fat lazy landlord.  When they jumped in bed with the botting community, they gave up any initiative.  So yea.  they pussied out.  Name me one defining fight they were part of in the last 6 months?
---
Yeah, after watching the video on it I can see why most people don‚Äôt ninja huff, but using a bomber to clear the battleships makes sense if they don‚Äôt rep much
---
Build the wall!!!!! Lol
---
&gt; Another Titan had flag exempt, so I kicked him from fleet, re invited him and fleet warped him too.
---
What.
---
He never said or implied they were wrong for using game mechanics and yes the mechanics/fozzie sov should be changed because who likes to mine nods while grinding down 1bil structures that take a week to destroy
---
Shoutout to the Brave team for their meme game being on point and their brave deaths.
---
Nothing advanced here, just some more risk averse blobbing.
---
I disagree with the pvp part, SkillU has sat on their asses even though they should have some spare isk to throw around.  FRT has constantly been providing content (thank you Elo) in the south while the east has been basically dead other than the clearing out of ER.
---
Someone else, I've been here for a long ass time and intend to be here for much the same.
---
Feels like this guy is trolling nobody who is that braindead can actually type
---
Hehe... We try and rock that Thera boat whenever we can!

We already have an Eve Onion post today.

Its nice to have various things setup like this. What are you running lvl 5s in? How was the hobodreading?

Don't forget all the mission bots

https://i.imgur.com/L5nnQEo.gif

any plan to advance into more complex mechanics or you just gonna stick with basics?

I mean, how big was your "gang" compared to theirs? People can work together on a temporary basis to kill something shiny and then fuck right off afterwards, ya know...

It doesn't get updated though. There are way too many alliances/corps missing there.
---
Absolutely, let me know what you're interested in.
---
Guess his post does not make you happy.
---
You don‚Äôt understand how the sov ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù map works.
---
They had about 10 cynabals with a few support ships, we had about 8 cynabals with a couple logi and a half dozen support ships.
---
Frat doesn't temp blue small gangs just to drop supers on other small gangs.
---
They fired the team that made them to make room for the mobile devs
---
Its neighbours - if only to collect on the rent skillu no longer collects.
---
Curious, do you have any battle reports where you guys took a fight outnumbered and still won the grid?
---
It‚Äôs coded as a wormhole system, but it doesn‚Äôt behave like one with the npc stations and death clones. It‚Äôs really it‚Äôs own thing, you can‚Äôt classify it as something else since nothing else is like it
---
maybe your retarded for missing the point of the post?
---
I started off with carriers but its a lot easier and cheaper to use a Barghest. 
---
Hobodreading is great but you need utility alts for it to work. I would drop a small tower with a DST alt (who also had spare stront and ammo), have a scanner alt logged off who would scout and scan the next hole, and then the two main dread pilots (with replacement scanning ships and interceptors to get loot out). It's easily the best ISK in the game with the least amount of commitment and ISK on field, though.
---
When you're so wrong people don't even bother to reply.
---
Yeah but it was a short run and a cheap sabre alt. :)
---
Sadly, it did not. Mildly annoyed at best :P
---
more like u/gloriousDude! thanks, so pretty.
---
ssssssssssalty.
---
&gt;With logi
---
there you go
---
also you dont need to actually set in-game standings, and it could have been as easy as "Hey bait their cynabal gang so we can drop supers on them". It doesn't have to be some top tier 5D Chess move.
---
Did your mom drop you at birth because she was still as fucking drunk as she was the entire 9 months or what the f is this shit?
---
depends on the boat - 20 crystals is like...2 and a half different ammo types for a navpoc. Really if you're using T2 you need 8x Scorch/Conflag (or LR equivalent), Multifreq, Standard and Radio at a minimum, so that's 40 crystals. Given that you're likely to use navy crystals, then you're looking at around 800k per crystal, so you're still spending about 20+ mil on ammo, which is about what you'd spend on a typical trig load of ammo also.
---
Sound like we need 2004 Eve back
---
Unlikely - the amount of independent corps competent *and* content enough to live on a nullblobs border for extended periods is tiny.
---
The few smaller independent sovnull alliances sooner or later get invaded, either because they're a pushover and should pay rent, or because they farmed the pets/renters/krabs of the nullblob nearby too hard and the nullblob comes to evict the nuisance (hi Unspoken).
---
Not Volta they are trash.
---
Wormholers Btw. on the other hand... Dank, T1 thrasher brawlers &amp; fake wormholers (coz from Thera).
---
The Thera grapevine is lit with their conquests and victories against greater, grander foes...
---
It mines 300% more, the boosts are 37% better, its only has 200% of the DPS. It has no use for me if it can't compress or mine. Id rather just fly orca at that point. I mean, id be running 2 hulks and an orca instead of 3 rorqs at that point. The rorq is garbage without the drones, there is no point in sieging. At that point the boosts are only 5% better than the orca.
---
Nice archer reference o7
---
maybe you're so far deep in your own ass on meta level 193, that you don't register what's going on anymore. but w/e. have fun i guess?
---
No it violates TOS
---
They are very not dead, high class jspace is a little risk averse right now but C2 space is fuckin mad max with small bootstrapping corps.
---
I hate you. Take your upvote.
---
&gt; it has no use for me if it can't compress or mine.
---
why can't it mine? and why are you using the rorq without drones? and are you flying with implants (boosts are about 60% vs. 40% or an increase of 50%).  
---
I don't think you are flying the rorqual the right way. It is miles ahead of an orca.  even without compression, you'd be an idiot to not fly it if you had the choice.
---
I said it wasn't easy, that it was a horror story, that the cost was ludicrous (it is, depending upon what you have in asset safety) and that moving your stuff is a pita.  At no point did I suggest it shouldn't be.  The "spin" on what I've said, if you want to read between the lines, is that asset safety is fine and good.  That is to say, having it isn't painless.
---
What has BL been doing vis a vis Frat?  ( I haven't been active in almost a year, my last flights being with BL doing the UALX jailbreak.  Much much funs!)
---
I have been getting the itch again and would love to see more conflict.
---
Don't listen to the haters; I like this story.
---
Eve is what you make of it.
---
No.
---
Ninja looting/Ninja salvaging the new trig invasions in throw away salvage frigates.
---
Made a billion in 1 day, no joke.
---
Provi already made a thread about the last YWS0 fight.
---
And a CEO who was probably selling said systems via Paypal, yes.
---
Is this a racial, titan proliferation, post or perhaps something else?!
---
I heard the CEO sold systems via Paypal, but it's just a rumour.
---
That is Eve Online in a nutshell.
---
But thank you for participating.
---
Thank you! We really don't have a frame of reference for the shit we do, so feedback (good and bad) is always appreciated.  I'll only stop when other people are so much better than me that I drag it down.
---
Elo has been super active helping FC frat fleets, which has lead to a lot of fighting down south
---
Everything is racist.
---
I buy and sell plex
---
BL hired by FRT (good instance of botting or rental money put to good use!) to annoy Legacy.  
---
Elo flys basically every night.  Marshy is camping legacy (again paid for by FRT) and provides cynos.   
---
Mostly muninns, but occasional caps.  
---
Pretty sure FRT is going to lose the fight, which is why they might just up and vanish into the dronelands.
---
Can't be a super active as I once was and it's very hard to transition from playing at 11 to playing at 5, but I'm still very much around trying to derp around New Eden.
---
I solo colonized a C1 WH with HighSec Static with my alts.
---
I do the data and relic sites spawning in there.
---
Also i am doing PI in there, which alone makes me ~150 mio a week. But i am not finished colonizing all the planets. Once i am done, it is likely to be trice the amount.
---
That would have owned.  Or made it so that to qualify "you just have to have your comp beat some NPCs, more information later" and then just make the Trigs impossible to beat.
---
i watch rick and morty
---
You guys weren't the only ones struggling :D
---
&gt; where everyone joined for the huge funs
---
No, they joined for the huge Casino ISK, not the funs.
---
I was in the fight on PH side. Very fun and somewhat even fight. Loved fighting Init. t3c, they were tough to break.
---
Gf everyone
---
"Mostly muninns, but occasional caps."
---
Some things really don't change.  :)
---
Flying with BL was fun.
---
if CCP crush actuel super umbrella system you will just force people to make less war to be stronger agaist roammer.  
---
It's how super umbrella form. So basically you said "reward creativity" i said "reward effort".
---
can you fuckoff from this game and this subreddit already?
---
I don't see how selling rental systems on Paypal improves the game, ergo if they no longer own space there's less of that happening now.
---
Stop teasing just sue.
---
BL and Elo is what i wish SkillU had become.  They started off that way, but then were corrupted by the alure of the botlands.
---
I get that, except you don't know that now it won't be rented to someone in China.  I flew a lot in Frt space over a year ago.  Bots were EVERYWHERE!
---
It has a pretty cool timeline feature too so you can see how the fight progressed
---
Sigh, the funny thing about this post is it doesn't attack any one particular sov null entity.
---
It's just a depressing summary of what sov null has been for the past 2 years.
---
&gt;Neuts  Bloody Neuuuuuuts   \\m/
---
Alliances definitely could and did.
---
Source: did it.
---
As soon as mining became the most profitable activity, both minerals and isk concentrated in the same people, where before it would be two separate entities that had to trade. Instead of buying minerals and adding value (i.e PvP skill and/or production) it just became a matter of watching said minerals become titans.
---
Remove plex you looze a shitons of player. 
---
The fact is actually it's hard to think "we need to back in the past" beacause if we back to the past with actual state of server you will just kill eve. 
---
Plex and skill injector are fine. 
---
The rootcause of problem of this system is "less noob player come in game, and so less easy target who buy standard ship". The fastest devlopment of new bro make a lot of they brun step ols player haven't burn. But in other hand it's they're way to catch player who have YEARS in game. Remove that and said to new player "ok you will never catch old player, you can be the goodest player ever ... you will never catch old player in skill". And for a lot of player i think it's something who could make they will just go to other game to have a luck. 
---
And yes i know skill don't make everything, but newbro don't think lie that when they just start.
---
retard post
---
There are defensive roamers, they are all just in gangs around SLVP/77S pocket since that is one of the main borders between TEST/FRAT space. Not great for 1v1s though.
---
It's kinda ironic that this is coming from a f1 pusher lol
---
Damn, you guys are depressing.   
---
First off, fresh new space right next to their old space isn't magically going to help FRT's situation against Legacy. If things keep going the way they are there's a good chance they're going to lose their old space. What it does give them is an 'out' of this war, the ability to pack up and move up to the new space they're focusing on in Oasa/Perrigrin Falls should their hold over the southeast finally crumble. But such is the way of Eve, empires rise and fall, evacs happen, alliances rebuild. 
---
Second, FRT only picked up a bit under half of Skill U's space; which I won't deny is a helluva lot (they now top the game for owned systems). However, most of this space is in Insmother, right next to their old space. That other half was and still is being picked up by a plethora of other alliances, especially in Oasa and Perrigrin Falls. Depending on how much FRT wants to press the Drone Regions, some of these alliances may be able to make something out of their space and become a new major player. I'd say that's actually pretty good for the game.
---
Abyssals. T5s with an active Gila; I make about the same isk as when I was super ratting in a big null corp, with a bit less invested.
---
&gt; good instance of botting or rental money put to good use!
---
Don't forget the RMT that [got Noraus banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9ei1lh/noraus_fraternitys_executor_has_main_multiple/)
---
&gt; will keep enjoying the game while I can, see how it pans out.
---
There are lots of enjoyable aspects to EVE that you can't get anywhere else.  So despite people being really Doom and Gloom, this really is the best thing you can do.
---
Yea and that idiot has no bloody idea what to do with that now 100$ *probably more* paper weight. Plex to isk mearly gives you money and the ability to fly stuff. You have no understanding of how to actually play. Game knowlege and player skill is way more important.
---
But yes running multi accs past say 4-5 is to many nvm the gratuitous cloaky alts out there these days and the fact that extractors essentially pay for your account.
---
not really, these are the best eve stories. planning, patience and persistence. i hate it when a spy roasts my fleet because of fleet warp etc, but it sure is fun on the other side.
---
Very true. I did, once. But it was to a smart bombing gate camp, not an explo hunter.
---
&gt; I will advocate for the firing of Hilmar an bring in a better CEO for CCP.
---
he would have had my vote
---
sounds like you should be salty at leadership, not the guy doing his job of screwing you over.
---
BS.  Read reddit from that time.  People joined in huge quantities.  Some in Imperium for the funs.  Some on all sides resubbed alts.  But a huge amount simply "lost" eve when they heard something big was going on and fleets were flying all over the place.  
---
  The proof was in the #'s.  Markets got really active, prices rose well above cost, and most of all, PLEX dropped a lot as every person resubbing either used stored (or bought new) PLEX to sell on the market in order to buy from those same markets what they needed.  IIRC PLEX dropped by about 20% or more.  
---
  Casino money might have started the war, but it also created a critical mass and the thing fed off of itself.  
---
   (The group I was in was busy harassing all the Brave newbies moving North from Querious ...  just because.  We had no skin in the game on either side, but we lived nearby and there was Pew Pew to be had.)
---
not everyone has dedicated trade toons, and not every one has jita/amarr alts so being able to buy skins on direct contract is useful to some people
---
something PL unfortunately found out too
---
too soon?
---
It is if it is not same person that owns the accounts
---
Yea.  IDK what to do about that either.  I hate botters and I hate renting/renters.  
---
If either is possible I think perhaps Eve is just broken, i.e. neither of these things were in on the ground floor when it was designed.
---
Surprisingly the Chinese actually play the complete opposite rule in TQ 
---
Frat might be our only hope from stopping the ultimate blue donut, they are industrious(don't say the B-word) and relatively good time zone tanking
---
Alright but they did it because their leadership wanted to and they wanted to because of the Casino ISK.  I'm sure once the pile-on got past some threshold, like an avalanche, it snowballed regardless of the ISK.
---
(is something the snowballs like an avalanche?  I don't think it is...)
---
You really are missing the point.
---
Whatever I did in the past was in fact very stupid, I caused a lot of issues and I angered a lot of people, I do not dispute that, all, I have apologised over and over again. 
---
The bottom line is, freedom of speech and the right to an opinion is covered on all social media platforms, for CCP Games to take action against players is basically stating "if you say something we don't like, we will ban you". 
---
Now yes I know I have come across in the past as very unstable and this was mostly due to the medication I was really not working for me, this situation has been rectified. So now I am thinking very clearly. My English may not be very clear and yes some times I do in fact say things in correctly. 
---
I have raged before, made stupid posts and caused a lot of you offence and again, all I can say is, I am very sorry, I truly am. If I could turn back time, I would go back three years, get stronger medication and never have started on the very slippery path I took on social media and this sub reddit towards all of you and I say again, I am very sorry, if I could undo it all, I would in an instant.
---
But my ban from Eve Online for actions out of game was unfair and borders on illegal in many countrys, I am not American, I am English.
---
Again, what I have done before is the past and I am so very sorry I behaved in this manner towards a lot of you on here and in-game but this being said, I am still very angry with CCP for banning me for a flimsy reason and then releasing stats about war decs which showed I was correct all along, no I did not present my in the correct fashion, I was stupid, dumb, psychotic and I acted like a complete asshole and again, I so very sorry for my previous behaviour.
---
But CCP Games need to realise, they do not have the right to tell people what they can post on social media, I am very sorry if this blog has come across as hostile, it was not my intent at all. 
---
Again to all of you on this sub Reddit, for my actions in the past, especially to the moderators, I am very sorry, I truly am.
---
They are? Didn't they remove all BMs inside celestials(as in, you warp at 0 on the celestial instead)?
---
I macro keyed it to my mouse. Now it just bump my thumb to scan :)
---
Nice bait, feed those bored gate camps.
---
Fraternity has allowed many small alliances to grow in the space they control. You give it to some independent entities, you can be almost sure that by next month some larger group would've taken over anyways. That's the state of Eve.
---
i mean they're quitting the game, I don't think they care if frat, Test , or even a salty sailor such as yourself takes all the sov, the game means nothing to most of em now
---
The real reason is that asset safety was meant to replace the way outposts functioned prior to their obsolescence. You couldn't previously get loot from taking an outpost, not in the way you're thinking, and most of the "loot" being protected by asset safety was originally meant to protect assets of people taking breaks from the game. CCP didn't want you coming back to EVE after watching a cool trailer and then finding out all your stuff from last year was gone.
---
I think we can all MOSTLY agree now that we have swung a bit too far in the "safe" direction.
---
IMO asset safety needs to be IN-SYSTEM ONLY. If you do not have control of the system, you cannot reclaim your assets. And ideally (IMO) reclaiming assets should mean having to scoop them or move them, or activate some kind of beacon or item in space. Do something other than click a single button and pay a fee.
---
Those gangs in SLVP/77S have started dropping supers on literally everything bigger than a T1 frigate as of last week lol. They're getting top pressure.
---
I think the problem started after the TLS certificate of the Evernus website expired, which prevents it from downloading the eve.db file.
---
Download eve.db from  [http://repo.evernus.com/sde/](http://repo.evernus.com/sde/)  and copy it to %APPDATA%\\Local\\[evernus.com](https://evernus.com)\\Evernus\\resources\\. It should work.
---
 Frankly I wish CCP made Vagabond a missile ship like the new Jaguar when then rebalanced HAC and AF back in 2017
---
I just don't feel confident not putting a web on turret cruiser, well, except for those 3 mid amarr abominations
---
Wormhole krabbing and hunting wormhole krabbers. 
---
(Wormholer btw)
---
I‚Äôd say ‚Äúwormholers btw‚Äù is by far one of the meanest machines out there
---
Thanks for taking the fight outnumbered init. Most of eve wouldnt of. Even though we had to sit through alphanubs sperg, it was worth it.
---
let's hope I am wrong.
---
So all you picked up from my entire argument about defeating umbrellas was that because I said defenders would need to be more creative, you disagreed?
---
Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. 
---
This is from the UN which if you had half a brain would know that everything they pass is non-binding.
---
"fuck you, i already got mine" is all that i see in this reply
---
For selling T2 material*
---
New to hauling and PVP in general, how do you suggest one does so?
---
weeks of fun for entities like yours maybe
---
Low sec DED sites and T4 Abyssals.
---
yeah you totally knew he was a spy the whole time
---
Ship spinning in Jita.
---
Once you hit a million spins in a session, every spin produces 100,000isk
---
That‚Äôs the beauty of StainGuy.  He is shitposting and goodposting at the same time.
---
Do you have a tower? A citadel? Or an orca?
---
I'm liking the idea of moving into a wormhole, more than likely a C3
---
Wtf hurricane or bhaalgorn foreskin
---
It is why a lot of good groups fold or merge into bigger groups. The average age of my group is far above 30, me is 43, oldest guy 57. At that age you want to play like it was possible before, have fun and make at least a small impact with 10hrs or less game time per week. You do not want a game become a 2nd job unlike some bored adolescents that have nothing else to do anyways ...
---
I would suggest though that the availability of alpha spais make it much more likely that you flag exempt.
---
Very nice
---
"I'm jealous of what you have and what ccp to take it away" is all I see in this thread.
---
Salt. Salt for everyone! We didnt lose cause we didnt contest!
---
If you don't like taking ships out to fight, this might not be a long term game for you.
---
You should give it a try. Be the hold example and just stop posting.
---
Tbf they tried going after test, but then everyone piled in.
---
There wasn't really anyone else to go after.
---
That's a good one too. If you scan a lot, I would recommend setting the increase probe size to m and decrease probe size to n. Being able to scan and adjust the radius with one hand saved a lot of time while navigating wormholes.
---
Cool story, bro (no pun intended, for real)
---
Know a few dudes in LS that make their isk from running 5/10 and 6/10 sites, B and A type ENAMS/Adaptives are really fuckin nice.
---
big part of what counts - yes.
---
Didn't know I could do this... game changer. Thank you!!
---
Nothing... Nope, nothing to see here. No need to deliver to my address please good sir.
---
[ill take 8](https://youtu.be/m9zF8YgT_cs)
---
You carry a lot. My usual mission loadout is just (Imp) Multi and Scorch. I don't bother with all the in between since the target is probably in a different range by the time you stop the guns and switch.
---
PL hates it too, because of fleet warp.
---
My username is literally bait
---
He's got to start somewhere.
---
Most of your high class groups saw how in effective keepstars were in terms of defense and unanchored them (laserhawks/no vacancies) sound just wants to be a big loot pi√±ata.
---
Good call.
---
I'm just curious because I'm wanting to move into a c3 with just me, my alts, and an orca to wander the stars like a space hermit, further advancing my spiral down into paranoia and sociopathy.
---
Figure 3 tengus, an orca, a blockade runner, 3 rolling battleships, a HIC, and maybe some skirmisher shit like a jackdaw would be fine for my purposes. 4 accounts and putting 8 characters inside.
---
Yes, your are obviously liar, and useless to your own Corp/alliance.
---
Haters Gonna Hate.
---
You can remap almost everything. It can save a lot of time if you do it right.

Congrats to Goons for winning the war on structures and to their pets for having 'fun' grinding all of it.
---
Whats left? Panfam, Tapigoons or China. 
---
Also yes, this was part of the rmt plan skillu had the entire time, to get those sweet sweet china connections for easy rl monies.
---
Russian NPSI.  
---
This war is not spectre vs NRDS its NPSI vs NRDS :)
---
Better frat than PANFAM/Legacy/Imperium
---
So to whom you'd like to gift the drone region to?
---
Best thing Mittani did for Goons is withdraw and delegate all important functions ti players who are actually competent. Best thing for Goons' enemies (not like there are many left) is for Mittani to be actually playing and making day to day decisions.
---
real men keep assets in cans floating in open space
---
Yeah, he could have used this toon to sneak some ravens into HK staging and keep it logged off for _over a year_ in what can only be described as the singularly most el33t cases of INIT flavoured inactivity....
---
Best is subjective ones that pvp the most?
---
In terms of larger High Class groups by tz
---
AU tz you have AFK and HK
---
EU tz you mainly have AFK and HK with little red riding as some new up comers that are interesting to see what happens 
---
US tz you have Laserhawks, No Vacancies, MCAV, and a few other smaller groups that mostly do small scale stuff like Foxholers
---
Newer corps you have The Mighty Beans and TDSN who both have a lot of potential.
---
Low class space is more like Space Afghanistan you have a few larger groups that refuse to move to high class. Most notable are; hole control, pospy
---
Russians you mainly have two groups.
---
 BLTH the Russian Hole Control Corp and Inner Hell.
---
Another War is also a ‚Äúpvp‚Äù Corp. 
---
Beyond the last Horizon is really the only Russian corp that will fight you straight up normal Russian game is gank and run when response fleet undocks or try to bait a fleet to come into a hole and slam it shut with doorstops or rollers.
---
There are a few snowflake groups like Whsoc, sinner‚Äôs trajectory, and a lot that I‚Äôm forgetting but we rarely fight them or connect to them really.
---
I am all for deleting those PvE pockets of security to be fair. In incursions at least you interact with others.
---
You're doing God's work.  Thank you.
---
PLEX. When you do the isk/hour calculation, it has the best ROI.
---
I really seems that we are finally past (or at least real close to) a breaking point concerning 0.0 power balance. NC./PL are basically no longer a 0.0 power bloc, they look like a group of "old guys" who just want to have some casual fun and attacking Providence/CVA seems to be their thing ;)
---
SkillU were really good pvpers, also gone now. Horde&amp;Frat are the only major powers left who are real enemies of Imperium/Test. All others are basically bluetral/frenemies to Imperial Legacy or simply too small to matter at all.
---
This wont change as there are no longer enough people who want to invest lots of time&amp;energy to build their own 0.0 empire. After the current campaigns (Imperium-&gt;NC./PL and Legacy-&gt;Frat) are over there will be no big wars in the future as long as the Imperium/Test are stable. And at least Imperium leadership seems to be content to play as they did the last years for as long as they can (basically farming simulator online). 
---
At CCP headquarters all alarms should be ringing, they should stop whatever they are developing right now and concentrate solely on the 0.0 game to shake things up and make the whole game healthy again. PVE content, wardec stuff, events, skins, QOL, fanfest, etc.. doesnt matter at all if 0.0 is not working. But if they dont care as long as they make money off EVE then carry on CCP... if will probably work for a few years and then maybe Star Citizen will release and everybody can finally change to another farming simulator, but now with walking in ships/stations and even on planets ;)
---
Oh i thought we were passed the whole 'LOL GET GUD, I don't need to crab! I can just buy assault cruisers and super alts with the corpse of their enemies!" stage of the game :)
---
You either bankroll your eve experience through plex, or you crab.
---
[deleted]
---
I already did a fairly in depth article on Booshing Ravens and how they work, and I think the specifics of the tracking mechanics are more than a little complex, especially the Centre-Centre vs Edge-Edge stuff which is completely hidden from you within the client.
---
If you have any suggestions of mechanics you think would be interesting to explore though, I'm interested to hear them!
---
Personally the best fix I've heard for asset safety / structure spam is instead of paying the cost to get your stuff back to NPCs, you pay a fee to whoever destroyed the structure. I have no idea how that would work out - like, do you pay a portion to each individual pilot like a bounty, do you pay a portion to each alliance that killed the structure, do you pay just the alliance who got the final shot etc.- but at least there's a real incentive to shoot structures and a real incentive to defend your structures rather than paying your enemy for killing them.
---
XiX
---
Can confirm, OP is a salty sailor.
---
How are Lazerhawks ans HK wormholers while they spend 90% of their time grinding through sov? They *used to be*...
---
I joined the master corp in a mining alliance with a work friend when I was just flying with Spectre and BB back in the day. They had like 20 bil in their master wallet and gave me access to it. After a month or so they all went inactive and there was no one around to ask if I could spend money so I just took it all out and left the corp. It's been like 4 years and I still haven't run out of isk.
---
c-china man bad

I don't want to deal with fuel or being tied down, or having any indication the hole has anyone staying in it.

I don't want to have to play regularly. Just hop in and have some fun, then leave with no worries about coming back to a burnt landscape.
---
I'm thinking about recording everything, and after the adventure is over, making a video series telling the story of it all.

All of the large nullsec entities have at least a nominal presence in highsec.  You will always have nullsec people who want to spend time in HS for one reason or another.  Buying skills, buying ships/mods, selling loot, etc.  So any active war against them can be carried forth into HS.  This is why you see so much combat in Jita.  As the premier trade hub, almost every alliance has people filtering through the system.  This makes it a high priority camping system for war deccers.
---
It was a fun fight.
---
Period basis is goon territory....
---
Sweet

I really hate when people (my group too) use the you have 14 docked excuse to complain about people not fighting. Those docked could either be pvp characters, afk pvp characters, or venture alts.

What does troll toasting mean? Why can only people in alliances make troll toast?

Dreddit. We know every wormhole trick!

If you all jump on the same tick we'll all make it.
---
If by currently dying groups yes use jezza as a metric for that.
---
haha I guess that's one way
---
It's still a wormhole system by ccp's definition (judging by data / code dumps). If you take 1st introduced systems as the norm, sure, it is special, but quite a few systems are: Thera, drifter systems, shattered systems, shattered frig systems. All of them have something which is different from the systems you consider "normal".

The best return on investment for cash-to-ISK is to pick up all of the packs when they go on sale for like 50% off. Since you can only use each pack once per account you might as well buy them all when they go on sale. Then take all of the PLEX and buy skill extractors in the New Eden Store. Extract skills from either a dedicated alt or any skills that you are not using. Sell the skill injectors on the market. Profit.
---
Skillu was just a bot wrapper anyway
---
You can drag them to shuffle the display order.
---
And this is known for how long?
---
Something, something, war on botting, CCP?
---
Uhm, kind off a late question... but I was wondering if you guys get bothered by the long sequences which got sped up?
---
Do you prefer such a long fight being cut up into smaller clips, or are you also watching the parts where the speed is increased and the coms are cut out?
---
I'd like to do more videos in the future and I am not sure if people even invest the time to watch it like this.
---
I am open for critique and would appreciate honest feedback! :)
---
never too soon when it comes to PL.

by the time PL realized how much of its power now came from Horde,  it was honestly to late for them.
---
they tried to push into test, while horde was still setting up its new home(and so few hordelings were traveling with PL).  and we know the story from there.
---
and at this point, PLNC is coming to the realization that Horde is now most of the power in panfam.
---
Seems so obvious but instant teleportation is a really powerful and difficult mechanic to balance. Almost every game I can think of, in any genre, has at some point had to rebalance teleportation powers of a race, class, or character. Teleporting is just, by nature, insanely OP because it renders things like area denial and movement balance moot.
---
I saw solo praxis run them and solo snakes or vindi.
---
Really helpful thanks guys
---
I do Pi, ice mining, and exploration in npc null. You encounter more solo pvpers but it's surprisingly quite. I also have a high sec base for moon mining and manufacturering. The Pi alone makes me around 1b isk a week for roughly 45 mins of updating.
---
Nice one! I also forgot to mention the right click menu button to apply an ammo type to all guns is also gone, and you either have to highlight all the guns or do each individually. Thanks again for your work.

You sure you are not being racist?

Skill urself just disbanded so there isn't anything to prevent FRT or anyone from taking it. They just were the first ones along with some randoms who dropped TCUs.

Then jut take it over yourself, fucktard

It clearly shows.

Good to hear! Welcome back to New Eden! Episode two will really help as our main topic is the current small gang ship meta.

So that they can be steamrolled again, now when everyone has seen what a paper tiger they are

I can't tell who ARE, hut are NOT wormhollers.

Was eyballing WH space for a while, but it is hard to figure out which the good EU corps are.

Tuskers also use WHs and are super pro, but I doubt they are open for recruitment.

I do understand some of the social and economic issues on Serenity that lead to it's current problems. I am also aware of some of the corollaries to that of Tranquility, as well as the factors that make parallel comparisons moot.
---
Excuse me if it reflects the same spurious drivel seen here.
---
&gt;knowing what you're doing is actually detrimental to fun
---
As I've gotten better at this game I'm able to take more and more fights without just ramming an enemy gang or thinking "yes that's a lost cause". 
---
Could just be because I'm a wormholer BTW
---
Now, if Tapirium want broke game, let broke... When CCP realize eve is realy dead, Maybe he's going to do something...
---
1b week sounds pretty good, how many accounts is that?
---
Sadly I am pretty sure CCP decided a long time ago to just milk this old cow for as long as possible.  
---
Maybe they will make a tweak here or there to capitals, sov, titans, whatever and see if it works, but I don't think they will never again be all-hands-on-deck to save eve.
---
Which is sad.  I think they could create the necessary changes and tools with existing code to shake things up.  Which would make the problem is game design, not programming, and that could be modified and iterated over time to see if things work.
---
From the Tuskers corp description:
---
Recruitment Status: OPEN for non EU/UK players
---
100+ in kills lol.
---
Hmmm it's almost as if CCP planned an FPS specifically to cater to these people but then backed out of it 3 times in a row.
---
I can write and I am erotic, send me isk and I will supply you with episodes like mails for the next week. Starting at 10mil for the firsr 20 for the second... let me know, we talk on private.
---
Nice, I didn't know they are struggling for activity (who would have thought?). 
---
I now have to stop being bad and stop being EU.
---
I stand by by wording.
---
Nobody outside of CCP upper management likely knows, so they can't tell us.
---
Left unstated but implied is that nobody inside CCP upper management will ever tell.
---
You can also say: Nullseccers screamed for a softer approach and CCP listened ...
---
Really? LAAAAMMMMMMEEE
---
not fully correct, Thera has NPC-Stations ... but yeah
---
Yeah. Got dropped three times in the past few days. It's Frat. No fun allowed, especially not for line members.
---
Unfortunately thats whats gonna happen when people get bored and want to use their big toys, but theres still a lot of counter play that can be considered.   You can kite fighters, try to split their support on multiple grids, post ‚Äúlol made u use fuel‚Äù in local.  Tons of fun stuff :)
---
This. If you're having problems with womrholers running, you need to stop being supers to small gang subcap fights.
---
why don't you do it, sounds really easy when you put it like that
---
I‚Äôll fly with excited newbros over angry bitter vets any day.
---
Technically, the Sisters of Eve arent a pirate faction either, but we treat them as one for categorical reasons
---
How do you figure they are struggling for activity?
---
It's interesting, because of all the super brawls or potential super brawls for actual timers. Good narrative tho.
---
It's not like you've caught anything except for the night you sat on a bridge for three hours to drop 10 cyclones. Good ragecage there. Great use of time. :)
---
The titan blob doesn't give a fuck and would rather go roam to their space for content, as long as the titan blob has something better to do, like actual war.

Who was in that lowsec cap brawl I was in last week?

---
Content was had.

Yet you took the time to comment on it. Twice. Seems high effort if it was so low effort.
---
We're at 0 fights in 4 connections 
---
How many do I need, in their tz, before I get to say they don't pvp?
---
There is a reason for this feature: NPC-Stations and Player-Outposts in Nullsec could not be destroyed and thus provided "asset safety". You could only lose access to the assets by losing access to Station, but not lose the assets itself. CCP wanted to implement this to the new structures and as always did al the thinking with one butt cheek.
---
As the replacement for Stations/Outposts are the L-Structures (Fort/Azbel/Tatara) only these (and off course XLs) should have safety. The M-Structures (Astra/Raitaru/Athanor) were intended to replace POS and should NOT have this feature.
---
Hold alt to affect all guns, or check general section of options to affect all guns by default.
---
Ya that post was to help you find ways to combat supercap umbrella while still having fun, but if u wanna smugpost on reddit about something that I wasnt even awake for thats cool too i guess
---
"I knew you were a spy the whole time. My plan all along WAS to get that fleet absolutely blasted we didn't even want those ships or that strat op"
---
All I can think of is that they weren't really having any fun having 3 times as many supercapitals as everyone else, but they were afraid of letting us down and ruining our dreams.  That would be exactly the kind of selfless, supportive thing that they'd do.
---
Oh, PL, NC :( 
---
All those wasted years, just to keep us happy.  Gimme {{{hugs}}} you big goofs.
---
Hm, if you'd build a sphere of collidable around the gate just over the range of the spawn in distance, and another just short of it, no ship would be able to warp off from that gate!
---
Yes, I'm going to listen to the guys dropping supers on me and formulate strategies with them on Reddit, this seems like a great idea.
---
Keep dreamin kiddo.
---
There are some answers in the attack of Malkalen, the Gallente Admiral was killed and his clone deactivated by his killer/imposter befire flying the Nyx into the station to make it appear a hostile act by the Gallente to end peace talks. Can't remember it all, but there are a couple of chronicles with references to perma death
---
I offered a theorycrafted solution to this a while ago.
---
Upon destroying the structure a large object drops that requires a freighter to scoop. That object is the "asset safety logistics computer", which is always the most heavily armoured part of the station.
---
Scoop it and get it transported to a hanger, and it starts collecting payouts like an ESS. Except these payouts are 50% of the asset safety fee for everything that is bought out of safety. 
---
Every so often, right click on the logistics computer object, and select "Claim payouts" and the money gets deposited in to your wallet.
---
Enforce a 100% drop rate on the object itself, so if one freighter gets blown up another can always take its place until it's got to a safe spot.
---
We had infinite isk to buy everyone the ships they needed for the course of forever. 
---
Nobody in our alliance had to do pve outside of subscription money if they didn‚Äôt want to.
---

---
Did you roll the connections before you started the sites?

if ccp didn‚Äôt ban them or teleport them to jita how are they bots????
---
Spent most of my time in small corps in NPC null.
---
\- Scan the pocket in astero - do relics, kill other asteros/explorers
---
\- Bookmark DED sites and do them later
---
\- Roam around and pvp(or fit a cyno to that astero and hot drop people) - loot 
---
\- Do market stuff in jita or in that area, preferably both
---
\- If there are missions around do missions
---
Congrats , you are now rich

What's wrong with Legacy?

Thanks my daughter is only 6 and I'm getting her working on my alts. Some of her first words were get the pod... From hearing me fc.
---
Who pve when some braindead chinaman can do it for you instead?
---
I was trying to be funny by stating the obvious. Well, if you are new and want to safely transport stuff with T1 industrial ships or deep space transports, use the cloak+MWD on every gate. Or use a blockade runner. If you want to kill haulers, use tornados or catalysts, a scanner alt and an occator alt.
---
just use neocom

how do I unlock them as right now that doesn't work
---
16 years and I'd quit if they reset.

Everybody is these days. They are just elite in the true sense of the word and I think they don't normally need a wave of new players, apart from vouches. But given the circumstances...

FTFY
---
&gt; Notice how every single event that happens results in a post about the server becoming Serenity?
---
Ay, it‚Äôs feels pretty apparent that their intention with the Trigs is to have most info on them come from in-game, thus making it in-character known info, but when you step back from that it becomes very hard for people to learn about/read up on the faction. There are some player compilations out there, but nothing beats a good old-fashioned chronicle 
---
I‚Äôd recommend checking out the chron ‚ÄúMithra‚Äôs Gate‚Äù though - while it doesn‚Äôt mention anything directly, there are some major teases at some of the deeper origins of the trigs. ‚ÄúSine Wave Omega‚Äù also has a little something that points to some more Trig shadiness.
---
Last time I checked we disbanded the alliance, meaning that all the sov structures self destructed. Maybe you should get off your bitch ass and go take systems if you don't want FRAT to take them.
---
You are a brain dead moron.
---
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.   There are probably much easier ways to put an alt in any major alliance that doesn't check or enforce stringent tokens.   Basically you shared a story of dumb luck of your toon being put into an alliance, rather than just putting it into the alliance.

Incursions
---
You are absolutely wrong. Many groups bash structures just for the fun of it regardless of size.
---
The standard PvP multibox is 2-3 (sometimes maybe up to 5) Accounts, DPS + Logi + Capital + eventually additional Tackle + Prober/Links etc.
---
The standard PvE Multibox-Setup usually starts in numbers where PvP ends, so from 5 up to multiple dozens. I know of people that were running Skillpoint-Farms with 150+ Accounts, Delve has people boxing 10-50 Rorquals or T2-Barges, in chinese space you can find hundreds of VNIs, often the charnames even tell you what number of accounts this farm has ....
---
Cloak + MWD on a iteron V should do the trick I guess however I'm not sure how to do the trick, keeps decloaking too soon.
---
[I wanted to post this last night](https://imperium.news/diplomacy-the-two-eves/), but I couldn't find the article immediately. (Yes, I know, imperium news, but it's actually a good article.) Everyone always asks "why don't HS/LS corps try to claim sov in empty null areas?", and this article is the best explanation I've seen of why that is simply not a thing. Long story short, it's completely unrealistic to actually *hold* sov in nullsec as a small unaffiliated entity, and people know it.
---
agreed
---
Nice video! I think you should also do a video explaining the basic parts/mechanics of a ship such as what the capacitor is and how it works. I find a lot of newer players dont understand targeting and navigation mechanics which is pretty crucial to learn In my opinion. 
---
For new players, this would very helpful in understanding how a ship works so they know how to fit a ship versus throwing whatever they feel like on it without knowing what it does or using a fit from whatever someone else posted.
---
hey at least Horde runs its fleets expecting 50% of the fleet to be a spy.
---
PLNC's been blindsided by spies repeatedly lately.  including that keepstar a while back near gemi space
---
Just try it out you won't know if it's fun till you do no matter what we say
---
‚ÄúWith over 1000 titans we will kill the Game!‚Äù
---
Gg been fun.
---
&gt; whine about 'the economy' of the game that they fail to understand.
---
If you'd actually understand the economy you would whine too, but your writing says that you are quite young, unexperienced in life &amp; economics ... and in EVE too. Hint: Skill in EVE was never, also not in former times tied to skillpoints ...
---
With little bee patches on their cool Test jackets hoping they go unnoticed. 
---
‚ÄúWe too are bees!‚Äù
---
Definitely worth it, I used a set in combination with a scanny T3 which did wonders, highly advise max scanny skills (I didn't) and max mid slots for using supporting modules for scanning. Also SOE expanded (cos it helps combat scanning too!!) and RSS probes, yes they are expensive, but you already spent a lot on the pod as it is.
---
I'll give you a serious answer as someone from a small competent lowsec group. 
---
The sov available from the drop is so far away from anything neutral (lowsec or npc 0.0) that there is no practical way to get ships or structures out there. I claimed 2 uncontested systems this morning for my alliance with zero intent to move in or occupy those same systems. 
---
The people living in these regions are all bots/farmers of panfam/frt so the moment you start making their lives difficult you're going to have hundreds of people entosis'ing your newly claimed space and reinforcing your structures you spent hours getting out in the middle of no where.
---
On top of all of that if you actually manage to succeed through hard work or simply being ignored by the land lords what benefits do you get as a sov holders? Anoms and Mining? Super cap construction? Not exactly things you can do surrounded by a hostile force and on top of that none of these things are that great isk/hour. I can mine more isk/hour on our lowsec exceptional moons than I could in any ore anom or ratting.
---
üëå
---
This could be abused by intentionally destroying structures full of loot you couldn't sell otherwise and never actually claiming the assets from asset safety. It'd be like insurance fraud for everything.
---
Talks about hitting bigger groups, then admits he‚Äôs pets of the biggest group in the game......
---
WH are insane for Isk just have to move it which is harder High has incursions but lowsec does kind of suck now
---
Spectre Fleet is fucking fantastic if you just avoid any euro FC fleets, join American and Aussie fleets where they play true NPSI
---
just pop into some C1s and dick around in something cheap. move on to higher tier WHs when you feel more confident
---
unless you mean pvp in WH in which case jump into any WH and dick around
---
You think typing takes effort?
---
I'm curious, what makes us a snowflake group?
---
I mean, we prolly are in atleast some regards, i just want to know what part of it you're thinking of lol.
---
It was a realy scary for me üòÖ mjd‚Äôd out and did see the fighters come in again i was like: oh shit there it goes. You can keep the tengu loot üëåüèº
---

---
&gt;can you use a cloak?
---
join wormholes to fly with the greatest pilots in new eden lmfao
---
As a returning member to Dreddit, it would probably be easier for you to get back in, just sayin'
---
This is all in HS?
---
First, if you're playing with an expensive ship in a WH understand you will be hunted. Sometimes for days. 
---
Second, No matter how "Safe" your setup you can always get blown up.
---
However, there are ways of mitigating things.
---
1. Roll the static holes and don't open them. (And obviously make sure there are no other WH or roll them too)
---
2. Once you have all the holes rolled watch for new sigs, if one pops up, run then scan it.
---
3. If you're not constantly pinging D-Scan you're doing it wrong. 
---
4. Safes are your friend but don't rely on them. A good hunter will still get you at one quick. 
---
5. Hunt with friends, strength in numbers and all that. 
---
Then we have loss prevention mitigation.
---
1. drop off loot often. 1b in loot in your cargo is 1b more on their kill mail.
---
2. Assuming your ship actually gets a good insurance payout when insured, insure it.
---
3. Have  a pod that only has what you NEED for the sites. If you can fly it empty, so much the better. 
---
4. Don't bling your ship if you don't need to.
---
As opposed to doing nothing or just down voting and moving on, yes. Seems high effort.
---
If only
---
Also 
---
Rats that point / combat timers when
---
I've been thinking about doing this, running multiple nestor/rattles or triple boxing dreads. did you setup in your own c5 or are you part of a WH alliance? Given how lucrative c5 are, is it possible to find one that's empty?
---
The difference being that skill urself was one of the strongest groups in the game. 
---
And Combat Wombat is...Combat Wombat.
---
Nullsec-PvE is not the most lucrative of all PvE-Variations boiled down to the max ISK/hr you can make. It is just the most easily accessable and the most reliable in repetition ... which also makes it some of the most dull &amp; boring activities in EVE. 
---
Things you can make more ISK/hr with IF you know what you do:
---
* Incursions
---
* Burner Missions (cherrypicking)
---
* L5 Mission (blitzing)
---
* WH PvE C4 and higher
---
* Lowsec-DED 6/10 farming combined with clone soldiers
---
etc.
---
the game is fine btw nothing to worry about
---
I'm the CEO of a wormhole corporation. You don't need to live in a C5, this is subcaps only so you want a C5 static.
---
Did you live in a c5 or daytrip with dreads? Looking to do something similar myself
---
I think it means using an entosis link on a sov structure.
---
Wasn't sure how to best post this update but I'll just try answering your most recent response.
---
Ok so there isn't a lot of stuff on this anymore since it has all been deleted but apparently this is a pastebin of the post in which bad juice challenged asher to an mma cage fight: [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/UQUnQ2Wc)
---
I'm really not sure about how the whole story went so I won't try but I'm pretty sure someone also went to visit the player behind the name "Bad Juice" and posted a video of the interview on reddit (which I can't seem to find).
---
All in all he was a \~little\~ more invested in the game and the anti-goon narrative that was good for his sanity.
---
Fuck off will you, there's a good girl.
---
What
---
Null L5s?
---
Tbh talking about numbers is pointless and it's never about raw numbers anyway. One titan can kill a subcap fleet but can you say it was outnumbered? 
---
Recent events... for the last night's fight you can say you were outnumbered but I can say that you had significant caps advantage on the grid with supers\\caps on standby in Camal. Lamaa fight; The fight began with PH, DHSJ &amp; RC fielding over 300 pilots fleet vs 80 pilots Provi fleet. Valmu fight over TRC Athanor; Provi 62 subcap fleet vs 90 RC, NC., DHSJ and Spectre 24 caps\\66 subcap fleet on the grid with PL Kiki fleet reported in X6AB  coming late to the party. YQB fight; 135 RC &amp; friends vs 155 Provi... so 135 &lt; 155 ... but 135 includes supercap fleet, so is it really 135 &lt; 155?
---
Anyway, bickering about numbers is pointless. All is fair in love and war. Sometimes you blob us, sometimes we blob you. Sometimes we\\you get the fight, sometimes we\\you don't. Sometimes you trap us, sometimes we trap you... 
---
As long as people don't take it too personal and succumb to tinfoil hat fashion trends, it's all a GF.
---
Make resources rarer to encourage spreading. Imagine if combat anoms worked like wh anoms in nullsec. Imagine people actually lining in asteroid belts again.
---
OK, well I feel silly.
---
I went to check on this in Pyfa and although it had imported my toon the skills and implants hadn't come through in Pyfa. I clicked character editor and saw the "Get Skills" button. That fixed the ship data and now it matches the in game data.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Ok what are we gonna do about it?
---
Goons doesn‚Äôt want the space, they want to take a shit on their enemys lawn, even if the windows are boarded up and nobody‚Äôs home
---
If they are not blue to 3/4 of the map they play the victim card and claim "the rest of eve is against us"
---
Even if I had rorqs I‚Äôd still believe they are op. Just as I believe supers are op even though I have one, and just as I believe injectors are broken even though I used them in the past.
---
Think what the fuck you want. And yeah I am they did exactly what they moaned about..
---
here's what's really gonna mess with your head:
---
did i just drag you into a 6 comment rabbit hole all so i could bait you into making an actual "no u" argument?
---
I agree with that one point only.
---
As if Delve, Querious and Fountain are the only regions with NPC stations. And suggesting shit like destruction of NPC stations... Absurd. And the whole thing about it being a boost to goons... not really constructive... what, just because goons happen to be winning the N+1 game it must be a boost to goons? Everything is a boost to goons, right? Jesus give me a break...
---
Did you have a stroke when you wrote this?
---
I'm waiting for the part that messes with my head.
---
My problem with RSS Probes is they only last 15 minutes, rather than 1 hour like most scan probes. Of course that's not an issue for combat probing, but as I'm in J-space most of my time, I also spend a lot of time scanning down a fuckton of normal signatures.
---
Of course, I suppose if I'm scanning *that* much faster in the first place, then I guess I dont need any more than 15 minutes of probes.
---
Although the RSS probes also put a target on your ship because I think the only people who actually use them are max scan skills alts with Virtues, but that's not too much of a concern since as a cloak they avoid combat except rarely when hunting.
---
RSS Probes have 45 base strength; Sisters Probes have 44. Surely they can't be that significant?
---
Herp derp look at me forgetting accounts revert and c5 wormhole ratting or gas mining is one of the easiest things you can do to plex in game

Literally the only problem with super ticks is that supers apply to subcaps way too well.
---
Literally the only other problem with ISK faucets is that they're too wide. Reduce the number of good anomalies, let them compete for the best ones. Forsaken Rally Point not worth running, you say? Well back in my day, that might've been the only site left.

Could also type other character's name in the "search new eden" bar and press "enter." In the results, select the character and start convo.

Let's not let facts get in the way of the narrative, amirite
---
Really says something about your corp/alliance when you *need* a silent channel.
---
I mean, it's basically an Orthrus with shield bonus instead of scram bonus...
---
I would move to another WH corp. I don't know of another group out there who doesn't wish they had another logi pilot.
---
Yeah, locked myself in. Rolled static and kept it unscanned/unwarped too.
---
Well it was negligent no doubt about it, but otoh zero skill needed to be awoxer now.
---
Seems more like an 'Awox', as not working for another entity.
---
Glad you having fun.
---
400ms faster with 2 nanos and more lows.
---
Everytime ACs get buffed to reasonable levels that are balanced on ships like the Rupture, the Vagabond and Cynabal become OP. 
---
Imagine that with Rapid Lights, it would be as oppressive as the Orthrus was when it released.
---
Doubht they can offer 1gold a kill tbf
---
PvP has never really been my thing. Fancied the PvE side more and industry
---
Look at that modern game having coloured icons. Now look at our old game :(
---
yeah he can get back into dreddit if he wants to, we don't live in jspace but I roam it sometimes.
---
I never even noticed the lack of duration on them, granted I definitely haven't spent as long as 15 minutes scanning a single system, apart from maybe systems with 15+ signatures. Seems I never even noticed I guess it didn't bother me at the time.
---
I can't remember the exact scan strength bonus they add when paired with the virtue clone, I believe I recall it being like 8-10 scan strength, it's not a bad idea to use them as an alternative to training pinpointing and rangefinding to V perhaps.
---
technically it seems the rules say them being on totally seperate machines is okay...
---
but we don't have an official ruling.
---
Whs are good but demand a lot of setup + one null system can host far more people than one wh. 
---
Null sec scales forever, 1 rorqs and 10 rorqs are the same amount of effort.
---
Man I'm still clinging onto hope that they come through with that 50% off sale
---
Depends on what you do.
---
I restarted one of my characters and plexed another in a day.
---
But he was very well set up to get right into it.
---
Tackling on training wheels - the guide
---
I agree with some but not all.  I have been playing the game since 2012.
---
The reason for multiple accounts can be simply to have a capital alt or a specialized hauler or a hauler who can avoid wardecs.  I have more than one account but almost never grind since it is a totally boring way to spend the limited time I can play in Eve.
---
My alts, with the exception of one short experiment, have not used skill injectors, but have been trained using subscription or in a few cases multiple character training.  This is a much more isk efficient way to acquire skill points than skill injectors, but you have to wait.  I don't resent skill injectors though, since it allows new players to come up to speed by spending money if they wish.
---
I think the biggest problem is that caps and supers are too cheap and easy to produce.  I would limit the number of production lines in industrial structures, and maybe limit the number of supers under construction at one time in a single Sotiyo to 1.  I would also reduce the respawn rate of minerals and sites in a system based on the the amount mined in that system or region, forcing players to move around Eve.  The idea of a goon blob moving around eve to acquire resources is a little daunting, but still better than what we have now.
---
Botting is a major problem, but automation is an issue in RL as well.  I don't have an answer here, except that I am disappointed that we as players have such a hard time suppressing this activity ourselves.
---
When I started, almost all PvP was combat subcap to combat subcap.  Today much if this has been replaced by structure bashes (BORING) or cap warfare (EXPENSIVE).  Or worse experienced cap pilots dropping on T1 ships piloted by newbs.  Who can blame them for wanting to train into caps quickly, if they are not discouraged and leave the game altogether.
---
The Goonswarm bee coming up to a warp gate with a wall around it and going "WTF?" is making me laugh more than it should.
---
fair enough lmao i make the same mistake sometimes too
---
Dafuq is combat wombat?
---
Basically groups I always see on BRs or eviction BRs but I‚Äôve seen very little of in space, or Like groups that have their own niche IE Colco
---
There are many ways. Infinite anom spawning is just one mechanic that allows mega groups to live so close. You have to think outside of limiting corp or alliance numbers.
---
is he wrong tho
---
I think me means alpha can't use covert cloak?
---
You are right, you can't stop people from forming big groups. But you can look at the mechanics that are enabling mega groups to thrive. Such as super umbrellas. How can titan/supers and cyno mechanics be adjusted to make it a little more risky for the mega corp?
---
wat
---
A classic Eve tale, albeit on a small scale.  It's events like this that eventually grind down the average line member and deter them from logging in.  To any new player, if anyone tells you you're worthless because you have low SP or haven't played the game for years, take revenge on them like this or just avoid them as they're complete morons.
---
Yeah, just like anything there is an opportunity cost, even though it is fairly passive, it is not fun at all to do, similar to updating already set up PI planets for the 100th time, it is just mindless clicking. If the profits are not great, then it really just makes the whole experience not worthwhile overall.
---
I'm an industrialist.  I've been doing that solo a long time.  ISK just keeps trickling in.  I spend billions, and wallet drops, then the next time I look it is back to where it was again.
---
I only 'rat' and explore for fun, so I don't 'rat' very often.  Don't care if I make any ISK doing stuff; I aim for fun.  Have a large collection of carbon from exploration.
---
If you find you are grinding, you probably should find something else you like doing so you are not working a second job, or buy PLEX for cash from CCP, sell PLEX it in-game, which is vastly more productive.
---
Don‚Äôt really know why you‚Äôd day trip with dreads. 
---
The least painful way is to just live in a single hole and farm in that hole with the dreads, (if it‚Äôs a C6 it‚Äôs crazy good) but you can also just jump 3 dreads, a scanner, and blockade runner or DST into a new hole and continually run all the sites in each new hole for maximum krabbici. If you do it correctly (roll everything off, for every new hole) you should only really eat shit to someone who lives in that hole (lmao) or someone rolling into you. 
---
Once you have the flow of it down pat, you can 1-2 cycle sites depending on effect and should clear like 3b an hour easily.
---
It does.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I might add whaling as a new kind of PvP as well.  Who would have thought about killmails of Excavator drones (WHOOP-WHOOP).
---
Nope you are too much of a glue huffing retard to even remember what the discussion was about.
---
Strongest groups in the game.. lol ok
---
See that leads into. The problem of what is enough of a faust.  I agree they probably still apply to well.
---
You honestly cant reduce the number of good sites youll make people realllly maddd I hate ratting as it is if you make it worth less people just wont do it. And hs anoms are already worthless so you cant hit them either..
---
I would rather do an LP conversion thats worth more "isk" than raw farm for a bit less isk. We need isk moving around more not jist making fucking more of it.
---
Even a simple as force ess in systems just all concord lp not faction. But ideally an entire anom rework so they have a "boss" at the end that drops lewt. Instead of jist mpre fucking bounties.
---
...I actually really like this idea.  It's probably a clusterfuck to implement, and there are probably some knock-on effects I'm not thinking of, but I like the gameplay implications (including giving the people who lose the fight a reason to stick around and play "catch the freighter").
---
You want to use the Improved Cloaking Device II, a 50MN of your choice and 2 Inertial Stabilizers II to keep the align time low. Click align, activate cloak and immediately after that the MWD. After the MWD cycle is over, deactivate cloak and hit warp. Your velocity after 1 cycle MWD while cloaked needs to be greater then 70% of the velocity you would reach without cloak and MWD.
---
... and yet their actions now say that kicking babies isn't allowed.
---
No the discussion wasn't about maledictions vs stilettos.  We were both flying maledictions except you kept dying in them.Remember you kept calling them "maledicis" over and over like it was going to catch on. And the reason you got shat on was because you kept fitting T1 points like the absolute abortion of a human being you are.
---
Possibly but its not "that" hard to get around with a scout and something else even without a cloak... but eh cloaks are op lol. Essential but op af.
---
Definitely.
---
The worst part would just be if you were used to certain playstyles that virtually require omega stuff.
---
If you didn't used to do much of that, then alpha is definitely still a lot of stuff.
---
Getting better let's you not know what you're doing in more interesting and more intense ways. I'll agree that what I said is an oversimplification, but I think a heavy majority of folks in this game would benefit from doing more stuff that they don't already know how to do.
---
Do you think upper management is skilled enough to compile that data?
---
sem.
---
Oh god this is getting stupid.
---
That's a whole lot of names I haven't seen in a while. Looking forward to a video.
---
Just had a random dude recognize me in local and linked me a video of a fleet fight where I died. It was definitely nostalgic.
---
I don't have to think it.  Every time you post in this thread you prove it.  Also, SkillU didn't give it to Frat you smoothbrain.  They disbanded the alliance and FRT was first to move in.  What are sov mechanics for $100, Alex?
---
I feel like this might not be sarcasm since it's in German.
---
... as you desire the attention of ... ?
---
Is there significant money to be made claiming money from "unsellable" items at a 85% discount?
---
It's for people who don't have any legit criticism of what I'm saying so they attack my (obviously sarcastic) username and assume I'm a teenage weeb or something
---
A 6 players group camping NJ4X gate.
---
Okay, so "high effort" for you is "effectively no effort at all" for me.
---
I almost feel bad for you.
---
Dedicated PvP? Lol. Who are we kidding? Who do you think ran the bots? Lol.
---
Of course. What do supers have to do with it? People like jump freighters, but DSTs through wormhole chains can be pretty effective for a small and relatively well organized group.
---
My basic point here is that a lot of folks seem to be spending a lot of effort on Reddit discouraging people from fighting for that space, and the reasons given don't seem that compelling.
---
Richest coalition can pay the most for the Trig ships, any drop in supply and they will have more than the smaller coalitions.
---
As the ships are over powered, they can then smash the remaining small coalitions with very few tools (or the same tool) used against them.
---
Wtf
---
Fight was in 10% tidi, the bubble lasted long after I died (in real time)
---
Both.
---
Biomass all your characters. 
---
Congratulations you have reset EvE for yourself. Repeat as many times as you like.
---
The problem is that you wouldnt require the falcon in wh space.
---
Fair enough dude, if you are happier where you are now, then all the better :)
---
Well now that Barre has given up that sweet RMT income, someone else had to step up to be the man in the middle.
---
Go play wow classic that‚Äôs where your head is
---
... and when you haven't had a good connection to High Sec for weeks, your citadel is bloated and a corp or alliance now wants to evict you ... ?
---
I can't answer that with any degree of confidence because I don't personally know the people.  I do know that it wouldn't take much of an accountant to compile it, and I'm willing to bet that the reports have been done by someone, and that what those reports say about the profitability (actually, lack thereof) of all the side projects will never see the light of day.
---
You can say that, but I just tried and was rejected.
---
I suspect it was all the bad posts.
---
Pilgrim - make every person currently docked to undock in whatever ship they are sitting now. NC, I am buying Pilgrims now.
---
Warp at zero is still in orbit. 
---
If you're lucky to put the bookmark dead center, there's a deadspace that still allows a bookmark approximately 5-10 meters in diameter.
---
CCP overlooks this fact because they don't think anyone would actually figure it out...

a whole alliance just quit because of mining...
---
Eve-Offline
---
In order to beat the game you just have to log off
---
It happens all the time. More competent groups will have plans to mitigate losses.

---
when is CCP removing towers? I thought they were gone already
---
Well then... reset the clock...   
---
&gt;Clock reset to zero days since last Local complaint.
---
Unpopular opinion but this is my least favorite kind of Eve story. It's got everything I hate in it.
---
* A nearly retired player ruining fights for people who are more invested in the game. You're ready to quit, but you're ruining fights for people who would be the makers of future content.
---
* Solo players destroying the work of thousands with no counterplay thanks to the total anonymity of alt accounts
---
* Economically meaningless losses in a strategically unimportant battle
---
I don't think getting your fleet killed because some random guy had an alt account and a an afternoon to burn is good gameplay that will make eve better.  It sounds like a good reason to quit and play something else.  Stories like this are why I continue to win eve.
---
Do something about it.
---
We have one guy in our corp that has 6 kids... 
---
He makes them mine for 2 hrs every day before they can do their homework......
---
He says it teaches a work ethic and prioritization.
---
Was terrified when I saw you all come in
---
The mittani praise is ironic to make non-imperium members mad.
---
Seems like you're putting a lot of high effort into telling us how little effort you put into the pointing out the amount of effort in this low effort spy scheme.
---
a feel good video for the winners of conflict.
---
What even are your goals at this point
---
You would if you were using it to roam null/LS or if you had an area of interest you would want to conceal your fleet/numbers/ect in areas outside of your WH.
---
&gt; (obviously sarcastic)
---
Not obvious when there literally are teenage weebs going around now with 666DarkDeathXXX2006 handles, not to mention all of the kids that have grown up and are stuck with a main character name like that.
---
Dunno, I find Jita is a fun shithole. I always enjoy local chat when I am there, operating my Jita alt.
---
If you're short on money, you can do the following;
---
\- Sell a small quantity to a buy order first, to cover for your other market expense.
---
\- Sell them via contracts and drop it in local. Depending on the attractiveness of the price the contract sells relatively quick.
---
Insert, Thera isn't a real w-space system.
---
Accountants are often middle management and depending on the size of the company, they would split up the finances, then you get those that compile all of the data (frequently IT staff) and that then gets passed off to a director of finance, who licks his fingers, looks at the summary and pulls an insane conclusion out of the air based on which way they think the wind is blowing.
---
Not so sure it is satire!
---
 **How Does Turrets ?** 
---
they shoot stuff?
---
With the local one, it wouldnt really work, since unless its instant upon your entering local, they are still gonna see you come in, and if it is instant, there would need to be no signal or anything that local is jammed, or else people would just say "ah local is jammed, dock up". The same problems still exist.
---
I was talking with one of my corp-mates about this. I made the same suggestion you did, and he replied that it was a trap. He's played a bit longer than I have and remembered when people's assets would get stuck in stations for years, unable to reacquire them. He argued that a clean break is probably better for player retention than having the assets *there* but out of reach.
---
These days I lean toward making Asset Safety be tied to a structure service. Something like: When the structure goes low power, everything in it (except ships that people are sitting in) goes into asset safety immediately. Once it's low power, anything new added is not protected.
---
"Small groups leaving/disbanding and large groups getting bigger and bigger? Nothing to worry about, game's fine!"
---
Found the botter.
---
No . . . but you sure are putting a high amount of effort (on your scale) responding to this shit.
---
Can you even walk up a flight of steps?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!
---
git pwnvoted!
---
That's not bad. In general I support the whole "low power mode = you don't love this structure = guess it's not very powerful now."
---
I saw at least 8 people there last week
---
As always, much respect for init. Great Fight and thanks for bringin' it.

i'm just surprised some random highsec mining corp that recently joined a nullsec blob suddenly has paps requirements.
---
yes but you could also use it as a content generator. Their local would be jammed and unless they undocked to kill it, it would continue to be jammed. I think the falcon would shine in areas where people rely on a forward scout to watch a pipe several jumps out from their ratting system.
---
Also intel bots, these are bots that report neutrals in a intel channel for programs that pin a players who are all sharing the same program/intel. This is used as a "early warning radar" and the falcon would disable a system. This would put a hole in an organization "intelligence eye/radar" for the lack of a better word. If the aggressor decides to keep it jam'ed. They would either keep operating blind or retaliate to get their "vision" back up.

They are still neuts. Just a Non-Invasion agreement.

I think once a citidal is manned it agresses it should no longer have a damage cap.
---
Also people docked up should be given a 10 minute timer to undock or logoff.
---
I will try to repeat again for people with small brain.
---
I really dont give a shit about that you did 4 y ago. You could do what you wanted (in respect of eula). It was perfeclty fine. Could be dropped 20 super on small ratter or on bigger stuff, or elite small gang. Who cares? Not me. And i hope you enjoyed what you did.
---
It s perfectly fine also that i do today what i want. I drop big stuff solo on gang and have a lot of fun. It s the most important. We play the game to enjoy ourself.
---
Just whining about that when you know the history of panfam...  just lol.
---
Sorry dude, yes I've seen them around. Updated! :)
---
&gt;  via plex by cash
---
You should probably just pay the subscription directly. A month of plex costs more than the subscription.
---
same
---
Giving those things on Force Recons would make them too isk efficient
---
Those modules probably would require something like a brand new class of capital ship with a hull cost around 2-5b, considering phenomenon generators are fitted on Titans and Ewar brusts are fitted on Supercarriers
---
&gt; So, pay cash for plex, sell plex for isk, buy fit titian and skills with isk...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Isn't paying cash for an advantage, how?
---
That's not pay-to-win though.
---
I'm going to throw that guide in the comments - It's excellent!
---
Yeah sure lmao
---
&gt; pay to win
---
If you aren't getting something that nobody else can get, then it isn't pay to win.
---
That's what the terminology means.
---
tell me more
---
I mean I'm glad you had fun but I don't really like this whole 'spy'/sabotage meta. All you've done is proved that guy right that he shouldn't take a chance on low skill players because they can turn out to be not only useless but actively harmful.
---
&gt; Be the change you want to see.
---
Here's how that went:
---
- Move in to Tenerifis with shitty coalition ("Mistakes Were Made")
---
- Kick said coalition around with well-timed batphones when needed
---
- Kill said coalition
---
- Have PL request to stage from your capital system
---
- Lose the following war against TAPIrium
---
- Leave region, move to ER
---
- Move again after it turns out skillu will farm us until we either die or leave
---
- Have leadership and most senior membership go afk due to burnout and rl
---
- Quit EVE
---
Still went to EVE Amsterdam though, but when I heard what kind of "awesome" things they were working on I figured I had made the right choice.
---
WTB Wyrkomi skins for the flycatcher. stork, hawk, harpy, crow, raptor, nemesis, basilisk, eagle. I won‚Äôt low ball, expect about as much for the skin, as for the hull for these T2 ships.
---
Yup, I tihnk even in the earlier days of eve there was an alliance that was funded entirely by one person buying plex to be the best alliance, and they only did okay.
---
&gt; I promise you most of the idiots jumping half a dozen supers on roaming gangs wouldn't be doing it if competent groups could get a small dread fleet there in 5-10 mins.
---
Would it matter? Aren't FAXes more effective than dreads right now?
---
I haven‚Äôt watched it yet but I like videos in real time with comms. But I think speeding up could be beneficial in some instances.
---
both lost their way and are attempting to be the blob. They are no longer respected in FW
---
prioritization...
---
The problem I see with sticking them on a titan/super would make it very niche and impractical to use. As far as them being too isk efficient, the model could require T2 components and salvage to manufacture. I don't personally agree with a price tag of 2-5 bil. 100-200 mil module would seems good enough of a price tag to not be spammed. To force a tactical play style yet be a rewarding kill if left undefended.
---

---
They are only dirty botters when we notice them. Otherwise they are valued, paying customers.
---
Send me a billion isk and I can get you into goons so you can make it on
---
What I do is for every acct that I don't use enough for a full sub cost or don't need to train up further (cynos etc) is just skill farm one toon on it. Then it only costs maybe a few hundred mil a month. Presto! Cheap Omega, but no further skill gain.
---
I am interested on hearing your thoughts. What you feel is wrong with it, what you feel could be improved with the idea. I am interested in a constructive feedback from you.
---
Are you implying that because I'm bored enough to mock you for your high effort posts that I'm some sort of low effort overweight neckbeard? This feels like low effort projecting.
---
&gt;Your "PLEX is pay to win" statement is dumb. In actual pay to win games, you can pay cash to buy golden ammo or other overpowered items that give you a direct advantage in the game and cannot be obtained by other means (or can be, but the process is excruciatingly long and/or mind-numbingly boring). 
---
What is your opinion if someone uses RL$ to buy PLEX and the PLEX is used to buy ISK;, is that "Pay to Win"?  The golden ammo option is pay to win in combat.  However, what about pay to win to avoid attrition or return to PVE content to make ISK?  In the old days, when ISK was "earned" once you spent your last ISK on a shiney ship, we would have to go back to PVE to grind out ISK or mine minerals to sell for ISK.  With the PLEX for ISK paradigm players no longer have to do that.  They only need to be willing to buy a PLEX.  All this being said, can that not be seen as PLEX to WIN?
---
They were rewritten to run relic sites instead.
---
You only type 6 characters per second? :P
---
Wow. 
---
Just...wow.
---
Because CCP wanted to make things safe for nullbears. Like every other change in the last 3 years. And, like everything else, they overshot - asset safety is far safer than assets in outposts ever were, because you had to firesale those or find a way to ship them out, they didn't just get teleported to lowsec.
---
Protesting too much. You lose.
---
Jesus noo they are leaving? F in pepperoni.
---
There is no rule requiring you to to run as your main. How would CCP know who is a main or alt? That a entirely subjective thing. The "rule" that I was referring to is:
---
&gt;If you are running as an ‚Äúalt‚Äù and you control a character that has a reputation in the EVE universe, CCP may require you to run under that identity at its full discretion.
---
This is all academic at this point as the nominations have now been closed for weeks and Naari was not on the list, as I predicted.
---
Protesting too much. You lose. 
---
Another go ? Y/N
---
No, CCP said losing a ship increases player retention as long as you can recover from it.  
---
When you're being permadecced leaving you unable to recover from losing ships you stop undocking and stop logging in.
---
Depends. As a total ass-pull example, there's currently a ton of pyerite, isogen, and whatnot in nullsec that is extremely cost-ineffective to export. If I had a way to liquidate it completely, I could acquire it at a hideously reduced cost, and have people dump to me anyways since the minerals cannot be moved out of Delve. I then load all that shit up into a raitaru, then blow it up and collect money.
---
It can also fit a module that you can load with different scriptable memes to spam local with.
---
You're thinking of Jester who also has a CSM flair and did the AMA recently.
---
As the other commentor said. Keep in mind Gallente is the remnants of "America" and all about that freedom ideology so Eagle makes sense
---
Lol
---
Not gonna lie, I lol'd a little. For the Horde, bros.
---
sounds like you're mad your space is being burned and your coalition can't do anything about it
---
Not tellinganyone how to play anyhing. So take your hostility and roll out. I dont give two dead mooses asses you are upset about whatever it is that touched you inappropriatley. I invest both TIME and MONEY btw if you want to bring that up. 16 years worth and the total probably far exceeds what you gave CCP shut you mouth about ahit you dont know. Thanks.

---
Some ideas I don't think have been touched on:
---
1. Don't kill them. Imprison them. Trap them somewhere, break all their limbs. Put them on an IV to keep them alive as long as possible. Decades even. It will take them out of the picture without allowing them to rejoin the fight.
---
2. Invent some kind of psychovirus. An idea virus. A cognitohazard. In other words, an idea that is so powerful it is actively harmful to body and mind. It will kill the capsuleer, but when they awake they'll remember the idea and die again, and again. Essentially a program that runs in the human mind and causes it to self destruct. See the short story "Understand" for an example.
---
3. Mind control, brainwashing, conversion. Make the capsuleer join a cult or religion that convinces them they should disable their clones. Longer process but it would be the easiest.
---
They have decloaking down to a science
---
&gt; C2 with a C5/Null is interesting, tbh.
---
It is, but as someone who looked for an empty one for a few weeks, they don't exist. You're going to have to evict someone.
---
...news from the old home... had a lot of fun in yqb o7

You seem to have decent ish skills since you can fly a t3, go do some incursions. They easily net you 100mil ISK per hour. You'll actually have some time to PLEX an account instead of burning out my mining 24/7. Also, exploration can be quite lucrative as well. You'll want to quit this game if you only mine 24/7.
---
Before it was most click a few buttons and liquidate everything at 10-15% reduced value, rebuy in new staging.  Cost wise t's really not as much difference with how it used to be except the tedium is different.
---
I do miss the firesales though.
---
The real reason we have asset safety was to stop people from living out of NPC null almost exclusively except for advanced staging.  My entire life in null until citidels everything short of super production was done in lowsec or NPC null.  Even then all the BPCs would be cut outside of player null.

At least now people are doing industry in their space instead of offshoring everything

Dreddit is still recruiting. The sov map is blue because the guys drawing the sov maps have declared like 4 different coalitions blue to each other when I literally shoot the other 3 every fucking day. TLDR it's salty rental bois with no balls trying to declare Eve dead, botters, and tencent "influencers".
---
I have no idea why you're banned from a pile of alliance chats, did you get purged for being inactive, or actually banned from their public chans? Cos...if you got banned from a bunch of public chans you're probably a spy or an awoxer or something and this post is bait.

Otherwise idfk come play and shoot nerds. Small gang is still fun, though fewer people fight these days.

Let‚Äôs see, I played eve for 10+ years, stopped counting my isk when I hit 2 bil years ago when that was real isk. I lived and killed from north to the south, c2-c5 wh space. I probably have swag from eve meets older them half the chars out there.

And yeah, the game needs a reset.

Sorry who is hostile? Jesus man that's overly salty for a shit post.

Somehow I'm used to walking the path over Steam, by buying 1100 plex per month for one account and then splitting it up. The rest of the plex is usually held back as worst case dime, or spent on fancy NES stuff. I haven't really bothered setting up my accounts properly so I can sub directly.
---
I never thought PL would kick people for inactivity...
---
In response:
---
* Absolutely not nearly retired. More active now than I've ever been, just don't have a huge amount of free time to play. The whole reason I set up the spy was because I enjoyed last summers war so much and wanted to be more involved with recon,reporting back intel etc. With PAPS though I just didn't have the time to keep the spy active, hence the need to just burn him with the most fun I could. 
---
* Counterplay is tighter security on who gets let in to corps/alliances. Obviously this can be harmful if its something like Eve Uni, PH or Brave where they HAVE to let anybody in.
---
* The BOZ1-O fight  was max pinged and has been the biggest movement in this war, so not   strategically unimportant
---
Ultimately what makes me love Eve is the fact that it's possible to do this kind of thing. Will I do it again? Probably not. Was it fun? Absolutely.
---
Many people have responded, most of which are accurate. I'll drop another +1 to WH's. Any group is a c2-ns-c5 is doing what you're describing. The play style has died down a bit over the past few years, but there are still active groups who do this. The natural progression of the game plus hands off approach to do anything about power creep by CCP has slowly killed off this play style. It gets harder year after year, and was made exponentially more challenging thanks to injectors.

Totally unaffiliated here, but sounds like they're fine upstanding chaps.

Highsec burner missions was doing 200-300mil/hr, and with my cap stable setups you can multibox them with minor efficiency losses. https://forums.eveonline.com/t/burner-mission-ship-advice-to-solo-them-including-fittings/9580/7?u=chainsaw_plankton

Industry: I injected/mptc all the 2nd/3rd slots on my accounts to be able to build t2 stuff. profit per item might look small but when you can churn out 1000 items at a time it scales pretty nicely. Biggest limit here seems to be how organized you can get your spread sheets and how quickly you can cycle through your characters.  
---
Trading: buy low sell high. Need the trade slots to trade your LP items and industry stuff anyways.  Might as well add some other items as you go along. 
---
At this point I mostly just trade cba to run around doing missions/industry as I don't have any immediate goals where I would need more isk.  Just flipping stuff here and there is enough to keep my accounts plexed.

Dude you can just have the game haul shit out for you via asset safety. I extract so many faction drones &amp; random modules from ganking VNIs in delve that way.

You can't realistically hold sov in null without supers, because the next big group who wants that sov has supers and they will simply faceroll you. Who wants to spend time and effort setting up a small nullsec empire only to get your face smashed in by your bigger next door neighbour because you don't have a super capital fleet to protect your shit?

That's just the reality of nullsec in 2019.

So I love listening to comms but obviously that fight was over an hour so I'm not listening to an hour of comms. I think spilting into smaller clips with maybe just some text to help narrate whats going on would be cool. Mostly I'll watch sped up clips cuz its complitations + dubstep not actually why this fight is happening.

So lemme get this straight - you burned a spy to kill 1.5 rorquals worth of ships that were trying to extract after losing the objective?

I mean whatever get your rocks off but you basically burned a spy to put like 6 sprinkles on your triple fudge ice cream sundae

This has been a thing for a very long time. As someone who has run multiple small alliances and is actually finally thinking of quitting for real after ~13 years because small alliances ARE my playstyle, the homogenization of nullsec has killed my desire to play this game. It's really fucking sad when I see 200+ systems drop and am not even tempted to go try and take a constellation and survive with a small alliance because I know a month or two down the road someone with a botting/rental empire will try to come sweeping through and remove small alliances for more space or tell them to bend the knee.

I didn't think this was a real post until you put it into the FW discord. You will never, ever get a module on a ship that effects local. I doubt the code for local is any way dependent on the fit of your ship and would probably require a drastic change and require a huge amount of man hours that could be better utilized on something else or a real solution. Same for Dscan. If this was a real post and not a troll, save your time and brain power on for something a little more realistic.

I don't know why I need to spell this out for you. You have more supers than anyone but goons. They all left because no one wants to fight that - no entity in the game will risk all their supers for one fight, or even one war. Once it's clear that the cost to fighting is too high, people bail. Again, Legacy is trying to spin this storytale narrative where the once-tiny Legacy rises up and clobbers the Big Bad Evil once and for all.

&gt; I think they will allow for better enguagable content and counters to players hiding under umbrellas. I am interested in your thoughts? What do you think could be done better or whats your opinion on some counter gameplay? 
---
My issue when people bring up nerfing cynos is you don't want people to defend their stuff. Unless the intent is to make everyone rat/mine within 2 jumps of their staging this doesn't do anything but stifle content. I think cyno's are fine, it would be time better spent trying to fix how effective the "Super Umbrella" is to counter sub caps. Unless you want to just be able to kill anything you want without someone being able to stop you anyway.

PL are sensibly keeping quiet; it's Zeroniss' chimping out that's keeping us interested now.
---
im currently skilling up a new character with a mostly blank start. that is, the only external investment i did was buying a full set of Basic (+3) Attribute Implants payed by my previous character.
---
the idea was to try and do some RP with the character so after writing up a full feature length bio and going to some other part of the cluster to get a different Corvette (because of reasons) y returned to the 1.0 starting system to do some farming without touching the career agents, only doing the 5 missions introduction with the Seekers.
---
you can get a small start in life with just the Corvette by farming "Rogue Cloning Facility" which are a special site that spawns in all the starting systems, the rats that spawn there give 2000 per bounty and replenish almost instantly but the bulk of the site is on farming the Ectoplasm they drop so you can trade it in the nearest NPC Station with a good sell margin.
---
good part of the starting money i got was farming those guys + some few mining runs with the corvette + trading NPC commodities (Spirits FTW). that yielded enough money to buy some basic books for the weapons and modules i wanted to use on the Corvette. with those i went to hunt the basic Drone anomalies, why? for one part it was the chance at getting a Sentient spawn and the other was the mix of bounties + salvage. i could have done the local pirates but didnt want to mess up with my standings so the drones were the go to prey.
---
with the money obtained from those drones i was able to buy some of the finishing books i wanted, and then moved to run Mining Missions. the Corvette was shelved in station and invested all my money on a Venture with the most basic fitting (no yield, instead wanted a robust miner for the job). im currently running L3s after farming the whole weekend and this is the maximum i can get but you basically get half a million per mission or so on top of potential bounties/salvage from rats coming to the site or from the mission and there's also the LP payment which is also close to 1000 LP.
---
i have just spend all the money on buying the Mining Connections book but still, between the time i bought the Venture and the time i reached the 15K LP mark i have saved close or over the 30 million isk mark. with some of that being lost to other shenanigans like trying to do Resource Wars or getting stuck in a collidable object while trying to evade the rats.
---
so basically i started with "cero" money in a fresh character, did some cheap farming and invested my money wisely to end getting close to the cost of a fully fitted T1 cruiser in the span of a single weekend. not bad honestly, and i havent even maxed out the mining or ORE Frigate skills so i havent even got on full efficiency (im training to squish out the most out of the support skills before anything else).
---
This is my thoughts exactly. It seems like people want easy krab kills with 0 chance of feasible defensive counter
---

Ok. Let me fix that for you:
---
*You can't realistically hold sov in null, because the next group bigger than you who wants that sov will simply faceroll you.*
---
Supers have nothing to do with it. The key points are (1) there's always a bigger fish and (2) if a bigger fish wants your space, they're going to get it. I'm pretty sure that's always been true.
---
But that's not actually the point, right? Because your real point is this:
---
&gt; Who wants to spend time and effort setting up a small nullsec empire only to get your face smashed in 
---
I live in a wormhole, so I don't always get why people do what they do in nullsec. I've assumed that the basic tradeoff of nullsec was supposed to be higher risk than highsec with higher reward. So isn't it still beneficial if you build a temporary empire and strip-mine it for all it's worth while it lasts? You can play null in other ways, obviously, but I thought that was possible.
---
i have an IRL job, dont need a second job in eve
---
gladly buy a plex every once in a while for isk.
---
I don't think OP wants to prevent people from defending ratters, but perhaps some sort of "mass limit" could be established, similiar to WH's? Perhaps make it work like Jump Fuel works now. The bigger and heavier the ships are that are jumping to the cyno, the more Ozone is used?
---
Rapid Firing gives 4% per level , so at 20% (level V) its better than Surigical Strike
---
Thats basically a lost $8 every month isn't it?
---
You probably have more SP than my PvP alpha.
---
So the answer is, yes, you can still have fun.
---
how do you setup? Enter the c5 and roll all holes other than the static back to your home, then have alts in your home hole and the c5 to check for activity? Would 5 accounts be sufficient for a decent setup?
---
Working as intended?
---
I got bs bpc and large b-type repper from the last 8/10 I ran.  The 10 prior was just a box each.
---
You must work in IT.
---
That should be a change for ships jumping to a cyno not the ship lighting the cyno. You can't change the hunting aspect of cynos and disregard what that would do to what else they are used for. You would effectively kill dread bombs since you can definately waste a cyno in 10 seconds with a cap/subcap fleet on grid. With the inhibitor change, you would make deployed super fleets invulnerable to ganks once you had a inhib up.
---
Could you buy the titan, mods, and skills if you didn't have the ISK?
---
If you have the ISK you can buy the all of it.  What are your options to obtain the ISK?
---
Each of these take time in game to acquire the billions of ISK for the titan and all its requirements.

Clicking Buy PLEX, Sell PLEX for ISK just takes someone with a credit card and can be completed in a couple of minutes.
---
Buying PLEX and selling it for ISK is an advantage to those whom wish to do it.  However, everyone who plays has the same advantage (if they want to take advantage of it).  The paradox here is do you spend IRL$ or just play the game.  I feel may people feel pressured to keep up, so they spend IRL$ to do so.  Those who don't or play the game naturally to save and earn ISK are marginalized for choosing this type of game play.  So in this respect, it is in my opinion PLEX to WIN.
---
I would argue though, losses hurt more.  A loss paid in PLEX/ISK hurts more thand a loss paid in TIME/ISK.  Losing real life money is easier to swallow than losing time.  Time you can't get back.  RL$ I earn every two weeks.

I mean yes
---
&gt; Supers have nothing to do with it. 
---
Supers have everything to do with it. In subcap only warfare it comes down to the skill of the FC's and pilots. So realistically a smaller group can hold off a larger group, especially due to the nature of fozzie sov which puts emphasis on battles spread across a constellation. Sure if you're fielding 50 man fleets and your opponent is filling multiple 255 man fleets they'll win, but there's only two groups in the game that can realistically do that. So what you are more commonly looking at is a smaller alliance fielding 50-100 man subcap fleets verses another alliance or coalition fielding 150-200 man subcap fleets. That is entirely winnable for the smaller side if they're clever and skilled.  
---
However, supers tip the balance and mean that it doesn't matter how skilled you are at subcap warfare, you will just get wrecked by fleets you can do nothing to counter. How you gonna hold that ihub against an Apostle entosising it with 50 supers sitting on the other end of a cyno when all you have is 50 dudes in Muninns?  
---
&gt; So isn't it still beneficial if you build a temporary empire and strip-mine it for all it's worth while it lasts? 
---
No. First you have to grind up the ADMs in the systems you want to use and spend billions in ihubs and upgrades to get the anoms you want because without them the systems are useless aside from the normal asteroid belts which are not much better than ls/hs. Then you have to invest more in the infrastructure to take advantage of whatever it is you're farming - if it's ore/moon goo you need refineries and athanors/tataras and azbels/sotiyos to actually build. If it's ratting you need Fortizars/Keepstars to store your capitals (because you'll never make the money back in VNI's unless you're a botter) and a JF route to get your loot to a market hub.   
---
Without a super fleet to defend all that, you will likely lose it all long before you make back your initial investment.
---

Nothing at all, he's just a drama magnet.
---
I see your concern and it is a valid one. I was just theory crafting some ways to counter some really overpowered mechanics. I don't feel a hard counter a cyno is game killing to the defender. Reason being is this  
---
1.) its your home system so their should be a decent number of players who will have an alternate cyno. This will allow reinforcements still come in but will either be required to attack outside of the cyno inhib range or would have to warp in. I feel this engagement would allow for the aggressor to drop counter bubbles and the defender to get a warpin using either a ceptor or a cloaky ship. I just want to bring something challenging on both sides and to where play style and tactics are more rewarding then ships types and numbers.  
---
2.) with cyno jammers and cyno beacons, I feel the defender already has a tactical advantage over the aggressor. Small gang wise, I feel this would be more beneficial while large scale effects would be impractical.  
---
If you disagree, please let me know as I'm interested in your opinion and experience in game.
---
TBH I wouldn't be opposed to CCP just opening a new server with a fresh start. It would let the veterans who want to keep their hard-earned SP still play with all their stuff while giving long-gone players and players who just want that new-game experience get a chance to see a true New Eden.
---
you are the fucking worst
---
You could get a Raitaru with 1 service module and basic weapons for around 600m. If you put that in a C1 it's unlikely that anyone will bother it. The problem is there isn't much isk to be made in C1s. You can try for a higher level hole but the risk goes up.

And that isk is coming from someone working for it.

Plexing literally doesn't even add isk or assets to the game. It's just game time.
---
But no, it's not Plex to win.
---
Having more isk doesn't really mean you win at anything. Shiny boats and capitals die all the time.
---
I don't have an issue with people defending their players. As it sits, their are too many benefiting factors for a defender. I am simply brainstorming ways to provide a balanced counter for both parties. Where skill, planning, knowledge prevails over ship type and sheer numbers. I would like common counters (like umbrellas) to become impractical when certain counters are implemented.

I did all of the tutorial missions and nothing has shown up there either. Did I miss a location to claim it? How long does it take CCP to respond to a ticket on this?
---
What does it mean
---
Despite the people downvoting legit questions because they don't like it or the tag... I'm going to just go ahead and say it. People want changes to cynos because they don't want fights, they want dunks or easy kills. Otherwise, they would be advocating for no cynos at all and would just hunt without them.
---
Tim nering is the most powerful man in wspace
---
Also viktor pvolman is probably the weakest
---
is this similar to " dont leave ama, your being hunted" in terms of how well you are going to listen? Or you listen to these new friends longer than 5+ year ones?
---
Ive been planning a nomad orca trip for a while. You probably dont want to set up in a c3 , but you want to be in a hole with a c3 static so you can roll for c3s.
---
If yout put your orca in a c3 with a lowsec static for wxample, you are stuck there until you get a wondering hole or take the chance moving your orca through lowsec systems to another hole.
---
Youll also probably want to have a sabre pilot and a scanner in a helios.
---
Love how the article goss over skillfarms having bought plex years ago and therefore still being profitable even a month ago.
---
That is the same bs as mined minerals are free. You are still at a loss if you sp farm compared to just selling the damn plex. The article just calculates plex speculation into the sp farming and goes...see...still profitable.
---
This moment, when you try to argue to be above all things and your first point is referring to your incredible amount of ISK.
---
Cant wait to see you feed those aswell
---
from following the comment chain its straight up mind boggling how one can be such a complete mongoloid as yourself, good god.
---
You clearly feel personally attacked ü§£
---
Don't get butthurt cos your got meme'd on B^}
---
Combat sites in Minmatar space in highsec.
---
Literally easy-mode.
---
Just fit a minmatar ship with an explosive shield tank and projectile artillery.
---
Clear DED 1-3 sites in ~2-3minutes per with a Strat Desty, for roughly 3-12million isk per site = ~80mil/hour with practically 0 risk at all
---
Occasionally get faction mods from Archangel and Domination, which sell really well at Rens.  I've found several Gyros and prop mods, for instance, worth 250mil over the last month of very sporadic playing.
---
ok

Hole Control and Hole Sale are pretty active and competent groups. Also very cool guys. Fly nightmares and shit

Thank you so much for shining a light on this hole. My ideas are not fool proof which is why I posted in reddit welcoming others thoughts. You brought very valuable information to the table, Thank you! I would need some time to think of ways to where I could get the desired effect without causing an unbalanced as the one you mentioned. If you have any recommendation, feel free to post and brainstorm with me.
---
Going to cover this story in my blog! More at eleven!
---
I won't be playing enough that that will be too much issue.
---
Should be time for sites to respawn in my hole and time to find connections.
---
I don't want to deal with having 2 statics like c2 holes have.
---
If that is the case then a change to umbrella application is what you want. If you want a fleet to come through a cyno and not supers and titans then tracking needs to change on super/titan weapons.
---
CCP: more SKINs? Ok
---
The real money is in all the faction and deadspace modules. a giant secure container will hold a lot of isk and you can wait out the eviction.
---
What? Why can't I use on different pc?
---
Sure. 1 alt as eyes on the open hole back to your base, 3 toons in rattles, 1 toon in a salvage destoyer cleaning up after the rattles.
---
Well one would think.  But no, I got the "your application has been denied, no appeal".
---
It should be in your menu in the top left somewhere. I think the pack is called civilian something
---
I think they more along the lines of the last few times horde and NC have deployed caps together, they had more than you.
---
It's not that difficult to harvest Templis CALSF salt.
---
The cancerous individuals will probably post on reddit about it, the rest of us will just keep logging in an playing.
---
I will work the same both ways, If you are referring to covert cynos. The same 200 people that jump on you can be counter back using a cover cyno on them with a inhib up. The victor will boil down to who is more prepared. As a defender, you have jump bridges, cyno jammers, rorq invul, local chat, intel chats and programs, an entire alliance, ect. I feel there is more than enough benefiting factors for a defender than the aggressor.

That's when you rage roll for one. Just getting it out to an NPC station is worth it (done it).
---
I wouldn't recommend it unless you have 3-4+ accounts. Its definitely possible I live and rat in two c5 wormholes. However I have my 6 accounts dedicated to doing that and my main is out doing other things. If at all possible join a WH to learn the ins and outs of J space and to have back up if you need it.
---
Lol why no MCAV?
---
PURGE MIKAL.
---
Noo, definitely not man enough to welp that.many caps
---
Thanks, added!
---
Appreciate your feedback!
---
I implemented some timestamps into the video description and I will keep doing that on upcoming videos!
---
If I am not mistaken the uploads limits of youtube have gotten pretty big, even for freshly made accounts w/o any kind of verification. Sadly my upload speed is directing me rather towards shorter videos. 
---
As much as I would prefer to upload such 45+ minute brawls in a single part without any kind of speed ups - that probably will not be an option for me.
---
hahahaha a wall 
---
cuba is on EVE hahaha 
---
and we have wall , embargo and shit from long time ago hahaah 
---
salute everyone Cacique Yuhasz
---
Go for a C1 or C2 that has a C3 static. All these classes are manageable solo or dual boxing. If you dont care about PI find one with shitty PI amd it will make it less attractive for people that might be looking to move into a hole.
---
Final advice is name your alts different names so people dont assume the hole is ran by one person. There are folk out there that look for solo holes to evict them for easy green on their board and loot pinatas. 
---
If you are going that solo life make sure you have friends that will come and fight for you. Pretty much all the friends I've made in WHs have kicked the shit out of me and then weve talked afterwords and have gone on ops together. Fighting against the odds will almost always get you respect just know who youre up against. If you see Russian in their bios hide ha ha.
---
It once was a lot, nowadays with the bots and plex prices skyrocketing, it‚Äôs not near as much
---
Didn't see this until now.
---
If the alliance isn't keeping track of their important structure timers then they deserve it.  
---
Also, my thought is that it would be some rolling average over maybe a month.

If you plan on staying for a while, the fuel savings of an astrahus pays back the extra investment cost after about 9-10 months.

---
Not sure if it will result in comments via a text layer or actually using a decent voice over. We will see what the future brings :D
---
I pay for my accounts with CC but don't want to get into the habit of buying plex to sell. Looking for ways that don't require to much setup to make some ISK to fund PVP/other shenanigans. Been lots of great comments, got to plenty to try out
---
The real feature lost by asset safety in null sec was buying firesale contracts. Those were so profitable for the winning alliance.
---
Could be they don't want to fight you because you're a cunt and they would rather not provide any sort of content or fun for you.
---
Never know.
---
So you want rorquals and supers to be able to fit covert cynos? Interesting.
---
Maybe 10 secs is too long, this would also require a perch instead of lighting it directly on your target. Thank you for your advice, and I would like to factor it in and find level playing field. What are your recommendations so it isnt favoring one side more than the other? Right now, their isnt much wiggle room for small gang aggressors.
---
Pretty sure it was grath just saying they are the cancer of the game
---
Because the EULA says so. They may or may not have the technology to catch you, but if they do, you're in violation of the EULA.
---
&gt; You may establish more than one Account for each copy of the Software licensed. You are however not allowed to play EVE by using more than one Account at the same time, unless you pay a subscription fee for each of the Accounts you intend to use for that purpose.

---
Such a shame. It was fun farming your supers a year or two ago
---
Ahh, gotcha. Misunderstood you to mean he COULDN'T run on main. We are on same page now.
---
Who?
---
If these were modules that were recon specific, didn't disable cloak but made the ship unable to move, and only affected ships on-grid I could see this being lots of fun. 
---
But as mentioned, probably impossible to code.
---
Quick reminder that the downvote is not a disagree button. I appreciate this contribution because it opened the door for OP's response.
---
You were mining, just not actively. Don't act like there was zero PvE supporting you, because then you would be lying.
---
Something went wrong or maybe my words were unclear. My apologize, Supers and rorq cannot fit covert cynos.
---
Thats the bottom of the drain already :/
---
They cant remove towers until we get small upwell structures, which are coming soon tm.
---
Ah, so when I asked the following, your answer was yes.
---
&gt;Just to clarify: You are ok with someone aggressively jumping in 200 people onto a nerd to kill him, but not someone defensively jumping in 200 onto a nerd to defend him.
---
Definitely viable.  I'm doing it right now with two accounts.  Just know that you will not be able to defend against anyone who really wants you gone, so pick your battles accordingly.  If you just want a safe place to do PI and/or industry, I'd go with a C1 and either a HS or LS static.  If you think you might be into running sleeper sites, relic and datas as well, then a C2 with a C3 static might be better (or a C3 LS or HS static, but more limited in site availability there).  Keep your footprint small, since you're so vulnerable.  I only have a handful of ships for each alt, and I plan on hauling out loot often.
---
With that attitude, you'll most likely quite the moment you die to code. the first time and then run back to wow.
---
titans have already been abandoned for home defense in favor of dreads. Do you know a avatar does less then 900 dps past 30km. 
---
Honestly the dps nerf was a awful change and they should have just shifted Haws to use LR ammotypes instead which have higher tracking penaltys then CR types. Ya your highend range would go up a bit but lets be real Bs aurora tremor spike doesnt track anything but other battleships and haws have half the tracking of bs weapons as is.
---
As an inactive CEO, It's been like that for years mate.  Expect nothing less.
---
I recommend it, it's fun. Drop Astra or Raitaru. And a alt for scouting and probing will be useful. I would pick a C1 - C3. Don't stack up on loot. Get it to k-space asap.
---
the first time i saw supers, which was in 2016, was when NC. dropped 5 titans and like 10 supers on a shitfit cruiser gang
---
MIKAL DID NOTHING WRONG
---
We signed a deal with NC and g00nies attacked us :surprised pikachu:
---
I am suggesting them to be recon specific, I think having the ability to cloak is too strong especially with there noting being a way to counter a cloakie camper. I don't feel and on grid effect would counter the intel/information mechanic. Some systems are hundreds of AU and shutting down a grid wouldn't be very effective as a counter measure. I could see it being extremely effective in FW space, for all around game play (excluding HS). I don't think it would be beneficial or practical to employ.

---
MIKAL IS MY BAE YOU BETTER NTO PURGE HIM
---
sorry i was a bit optimistic, its way more likely you will get 100m an hour with t4s
---
SkillU, Origin, Fraternity, Triumvirate and Pandemic Legion all seemed to think it was worth risking their supers when they jumped into UALX even though all the information was already known. It was publicly known that Test had 1,000 dreads in the cache, it was publicly known how many titans/supers Test had (since they just before used them to meme in providence). I certainly hope it wasn't the number of supers/titans and dreads they'd have to fight that turned them around because they should have known that before they jumped in.
---
I wanted to hear the reason why you guys tried to alpha my Lachesis three times on a row :(
---
Good fight!
---
? Sorry if I get a game term confused. I have billions of isk and die all the time yet I‚Äôm still playing. Go be a jerk somewhere else.

Fortunately I never said that. My posts are still there, unedited, if you want to refer to them.

For a high effort post about low effort spying you sure have extended your minimal effort into discussing the effort levels all day. You've also really gone down the rabbit hole of n u effort, which means we're approaching maximum posting effort on your behalf in what you describe as a minimal effort situation.

---
I have already tasted a bit of wormhole life in a group with a friend, so I know at least some of the basics already.
---
That said, I primarily took advantage of using the NS static for hunting and would like to do something similar.  My ideal would be to have some kind of ISK-making opportunities in the hole, with a decent static for hunting.  I have 3 alts at various stages - one of those a dedicated scanner.
---
I was hoping that my base could fly under the radar somewhat.  It would certainly be lean and I doubt it will ever be considered a loot pi√±ata!
---
One of the holes I came across was a C2, which looked interesting, but it had a lot of WH connections. If I roll these, will more spawn?
---
If you have played it right you could have maybe kept the spy by just playing "stupid-piloting, bubbled-my-own-fleet" sort of way.

Get that garbage propaganda out of here!

Omega players don't have a problem with that, just Alphas. :(

old time players maybe so but a lot of the newer players in eve that started in the last 5 years are playing on alphas more so than any thing else so it means relogging to buy it on the other toon then contract it over and relog again

but there are trade channels by ccp for all other commodities except skins....

Transferring structures to an alt corp won't save them.

Yes as covert cyno capable are easy to counter vs large numbers of cheap t1 ships

It's called bluetral :| Before the recent wars the Northern coalitions also were set to neut and shot each other, roamed each other, etc. However no real wars and push come to shove they'd help each other. Same as TEST :|

It will if it is Sixth Empire.

If you did this you would instantly ruin the rare pvp that exists in this game.

As an largely independent player, I really appreciate everything the eve mogul team provided and did to help individual players, and I'm very sorry to see your services disappear.

Basically if the objectives of the war in tribute are to reset the region economically, how would leaving free-port structures in tact circumvent that objective?  You gotta kill everyone.  There‚Äôs gonna be some collateral damage guys.  It‚Äôs eve.  That‚Äôs the risk you take when you anchor a structure.  If someone comes along with different political motivations then be prepared to either defend the structures or abandon them.

Really doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with goons being good or bad for eve.

[You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIP6EwqMEoE&amp;t=0m17s)
---
did someone say K R A B T I M E?
---
I have absolutely no faith in the old argument of "it is not doable to evict *insert alliance/coalition name here* after world war bee.
---
Evicting the Imperium from the north was the impossible  task, that was achieve with relative ease.
---
Evicting HK from rage was impossible. until someone decided to actually do it.
---
With hindsight, everyone looks at those events and say, well that was different, the Imperium was weak, or HK could never stand against all of Initiative + Snuffed and GSF as well.
---
But prior to those events, the word on the street as one could say, was that those taks could never be achieve.
---
Test own history shows that you don't even need the intent to evict an alliance from nullsec space.
---
The CFC attack on Test during the fountain war was not a war to completely remove test from the map, but the outcome of losing the war, and all the drama that unfolded with that defeat, killed Test leadership and with it was any prospects of Test remaining as a sov holding alliance.
---
In the case of the war last year, the intent was there, Doom words, be troll or otherwise, absolutely gave the impression that the goal was an eviction of Legacy, those words combine with Fraternity prior actions against Legacy, absolutely showed a desire for the removal of Legacy from their space, Plus the amount of Assets moved for that campaign dwarfed Legacy own assets, without a support from the Imperium Legacy was severely outnumbered in Supers and Titans, last time Test faced those odds, they were evicted.
---
You may not think that it was doable to evict legacy from their space, but the assets deployed for that war can only give one impression of the intent behind that campaign.
---
Probably idiots taking EVE Online way too seriously.
---
holy smokes actions have consequences?  this is terrible game design, goons are ruining this game
---
ccp please fix this
---
Indeed I am. But I'm not bragging about how cool it is to be unstoppable.
---
The thing is the game does reward being in a big blob a lot right Now. At least if one finances the game by crabbing sometimes and one has not enough time to generate constant constant for oneself.
---
I wrote in a comment a few days ago, that maybe the solution might be to limit the sice of alliances to a maximum of players and controlled systems, put a debuff in bounties and yield in space controlled by other alliances and limit the amount of possible blue standings.
---
Also at least triple building times for caps.
---
With that one could add a lot more diversity and more small local conflicts and regional politics to 0.0 instead of just having right now 2, in a few years just 1 big block, and by that possibly safe tranquility be for it will be serenety in the end.
---
Should try to get on the csm table one day maybe.
---
But that would mean eather selling myself out to the blocks for votes, or doing a lot of promotion stuff, videos and streams myself, I sadly I do not have time for that...
---
I was with you until the goon whining.

Thank you for your excellent service in purging the New Eden from greedy NCPL people.        
---
They're PVE players, though, if they're using public industry structures. Isn't the quintessence of a small gang, elite PVPer a horrific, caustic aversion to all PVE in any form, so strong that even the merest whiff of any PVE would cause uncontrollable anal bleeding? Surely, these players would not be missed when absent from such illustrious company.
---
Cva has had every toon I've had set red... It's not hard lmao
---
I had a character in Thera flying with them. They are just pretty good pilots. And what makes them different from a lot of other groups is that they do not have any "bad" ones. So no crabs that fly when needed, just a group of real dedicated small-scale pilots  occasionally coming together for a bigger fleet. No f1 drones. 
---
And that is a a kind of rare and admirable thing I guess üòä
---
Same with mordu's legion
---
Comwhat?
---
Appears so dad.
---
A C2 static also gives you access to pvp because a bunch of pvp corps live in a c2 with a static nullsec for pvp and C5 for krabing and fighting C5 pvp entities
---
2/5 null is where C5 corps go to die lol
---
I was talking to a couple of corp mates about this recently.  One of them had the idea that asset safety would spawn an NPC hauler fleet that has to take your items to the station you choose.  This fleet could then be attacked and the items it carries would drop.  I don't know how practical this is but it's a neat idea nonetheless.
---
Lmao I was on that moniter kill as well as the eagles, thanks for the green killboard
---
I miss my Levi somehow. But that's the price I have to pay. Wormholer btw.
---
&gt;Unfortunately we have been painted with a red X, partially due to our public supercap production facility and it being in NCPL space   
---
"Who could have predicted that if we opened up a public flea market for fully functional ICBMs within the borders of a hostile state, a coalition of peoples opposed to this concept would disrupt our services?"   
---
&gt;We never agreed with that, and know that there is a HUGE community of players who are happy to live and thrive in highsec

Careful, your smooth brain is showing. Do you seriously not know who Tuzy is?
---
Eve mogul: We're an independent entity, and the goons are being bullies  
---
Tuzy: \*posts evidence to the contrary\*  
---
You: Haha goons are salty
---
Omg you can make that in one relic site.
---
You need to totally reevaluate the reason you play Eve and the isk/hour you can pull with alpha or omega states.
---
3 Nags should at minimum two cycle in any effect that you can use. 
---
In a C5 just blue loot is 592m per site. Long as you‚Äôre not warping across 30+ AU you should be able to do ~ 5 sites an hour.
---
&gt; Won't somebody think of the highsec!?
---
Smooth as your brain
---
I mean, isn't that the Goon MO - ruin the game?  Have you guys gone soft?  Do you actually play it now?
---
its almost like since then sov and structure mechanics changed on a fundamental level, and its not like goons had the biggest single supercap force in the game as a batphone like tapi. You'd think that would be a sticking point before writing such a silly wall of text.
---
&gt; Evicting HK from rage was impossible. until someone decided to actually do it
---
nobody who was capable of actually thinking thought it was impossible, seriously who the hell are you talking to other than nullbab number 457
---
also doom probably wasn't trolling when he said that, he's a special one.
---
So you want easy dunks and not fights. Got it.
---
Sorry, lore doesn‚Äôt make money. So how about a skin called ‚ÄúLore‚Äù, that is a limited time only skin, available in the store?
---
Im not so sure. I never used Eve-Mogul in any significant capacity, but I like both industry *and* small gang pvp. There's something satisfying about making all your own welp dessies from things you mined yourself for your little corp. It makes the kills a little sweeter.

Most normal people tend to mind their manners online so they don't have to delete their history. Just saying maybe you shouldn't say controversial things like racist comments etc. Not saying you did that, just saying generally.

even copied COF dying smh
---
C5, very easy to find a hole inhabited by idiots you can evict solo, or even sometimes just uninhabited. 
---
C6, mostly owned by those bigger groups if it‚Äôs a good effect or a 6-5/6-6 but you can still find uninhabited/easy to evict afk ones

***Eat Shit Eve Mogul***
---
I say do it, there are lots of bittervets who will say the game is no fun anymore but honestly I think they just forgot how to have fun. There is loads to do and tons of new stuff has been added the last few years that were really home runs (abyssal space, Triglavians, etc). 
---
If you are looking to get back in with a more laid back casual group of Null Sov focused on small gang warfare and industry my Corp Fancypants Inc is recruiting.
---
Just another example of the republican conservative nazi mods here at r/eve
---
I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre getting at. The defender gets the easy dunk and not fights. Are you saying my recommendation are not ‚Äúbuffed‚Äù enough? I am confused on what you‚Äôre trying to say.
---
Part of the common conversation around the Rorq is removing the excavators. And yes. I use and Ore mind link. While yes, 60 is 50% more than 40. And my orca boosts around 43% I use an ORE mind link.
---
Why not do T5‚Äôs? The fits are fairly cheap
---
What am I lying about?  I'm not sure tbh. 
---
You knew what I was doing by watching killmails, and that I was in convo with you while roaming low sec, and in pf/fd.
---
 You just respond with "hehehehehe, just plllzzzzz be careful"
---
Their trade stations in high sec house tons of scam buy orders
---
Would you mind explaining how it would ruin rare pvp? If you‚Äôre talking about dread bombing than yes. The 10sec timer would be too long. Someone brought it up earlier, what about a 3 sec timer?
---
Lol man i almost spit out water i was laughing so hard. Yeah tuzy does nothing of important &gt;.&gt; &lt;3 tuzy
---
This so much this. Wake up sheeple.
---
You should probably refresh your memory as to what Darius said.
---
That is to much. Cyno inhib need a buff i agree. like 10 sec anchoring time and some shield/armor ressists. But to make it cancel an active cyno is broken. Maybe make cyno an anchorable module as well.
---
That is a script run by a 3rd party program that Jebi ran to purge reddit comment history.
---
Reddit archives all comments past 3 or 6 months old so they can sell the data.
---
Cut your crap, we all can see you are not neutral. Hiding behind hisec victims, does not change that.
---
Nah there's enough of y'all posting like this for it be unirionic
---
Thats why you join a decent corp. 
---
I ran a WH corp for a year or so and the way we had the roles we could have had all the directors take a 2 week break and it would have been fine. 
---
Even easier now with stations.
---
Cyno is not fine. Cyno is also a problem. Why undock in subcaps and save your tackled rorquals or kill the enemies when he can light a cyno and its instant action for you. Also cyno inhibition is very week atm. While you can throw an inhib close to a citadel that menas no matter what you do hostiles can still light a cyno in the middle of a citadel as there is no possibility for inhib range to reach there. Issue also in gate. Why inhib cannot be anchored on gate but cyno has no problem being lit there? Cyno is far from ok. and in order to make ppl switch from caps to subcaps i think small adjustmens to cyno are needed as well.
---
I keep forgetting True Goons died when DJ burned out and vouched into PL.
---
No collusion !
---
What sec rating he in?
---
I'm saying that wanting to drop 200 bombers or covert ops on someone but removing the ability to counter drop 200 defenders isn't going to work.
---
I'm mostly an independent player myself, I appreciate the services you provide but think that the economy would be more favourable for me if Eve-Mogul was glassed.
---
Your math is wrong.
---
RandomNumber &lt; 0.1 will always smash.
---
Just no. Do you know how much this will fuck the Macro scale or are you unable to see that picture?
---
Hello fellow eve enthusiast, 
---
Your ideas are bad with ill thought consequences that would make the game, transport of goods (JF) unplayable. 
---
Please stay in your hisec island as its clear you have no clue of :cynos: or their mechanics.
---
TY 
---
GF
---
That would indeed be interesting! If that‚Äôs something you like the community could agree to I would be more than happy to push it thru. Biggest factor is how cynos are instantly lite and stay lite for 10mins. If played right, a rorq can light a cyno when enough forces show or mobil cyno is about to anchor, go into invulnerability, come out and die before the cyno runs out. At this point you‚Äôre praying that didn‚Äôt see the cyno inhib or wasn‚Äôt in a fleet and had issues joining one. No real skills or counter play there.
---
Maybe you could share your gud posting guide? Perhaps one with a section on caring about your opinion, mine seems to be lacking that chapter.
---
Every allance in eve worth knowing has me set red even allies who see me red until I'm infleet
---
Oh my word thanks. It has been so annoying doing them all individually, I didn‚Äôt know there was an option for this.
---
More like HK, Shekel, and Hawks copying us ayyyyy
---
Sorry but you don't get to do free market economics while having all your fingers in everybody's pies.
---
Congrats, you just described NCPL
---
that's fitting.

There are some instances where increased range actually increases chance to hit. With low tracking speed guns, its easy to get close enough to the target such that your angular velocity is high enough to effectively never be hit. As the range increases, the angular velocity decreases, meaning its easier to track. This effect is what allows dreadnoughts with long rage weapons, like beam lasers, railguns, and artillery, to hit subcapitals relatively reliably at very long ranges (250-300km)
---
Ahh i get what you‚Äôre saying. The defender gets jump bridges, an alliance for backup, invulnerability, local, ect. So if the enemy was able to get 200+ in and distrups the ability to reinforce with a cyno. The defender would have to bring in an alternate cyno outside of the cyno inhib range, use a jump bridge, or use a small task force to destroy the cyno inhib. What i am recommend is a balance game play where the aggressor can shift a situation in their favor if executed properly.
---
Trump 2020
---
The Eve Mogul sentiments on this Reddit have been akin to the childhood experience of screaming, "I'm friendly, I'm friendly" in a free-for-all game mode.
---
It wasn't the number, it was the risk. Of course we knew how many supers you'd field. What we didn't know was how much risk we'd take on in terms of real loss, and more importantly, in terms of forcing our members to sit in 6-8 hour tidi slugfests till downtime. You are probably gonna get your panties in a twist over this but a lot of us have been doing the "stay up real late for internet spaceships" thing for more than a decade now and, you know what, we just don't want to do that a half dozen more times. 
---
Spin this however you want but no one is fucking arguing with you dude. TAPIrium is winning Eve right now, and might very well win for good. But not because you're the best that ever was - you're not - mostly because the game has changed and your only enemies just don't want to play anymore.
---
&gt; Since the election of Donald Trump American society has seen a huge decline in ethics and morality. 
---
Since?
---
Hahaha, that's a good one. It's been that way since Reagan.
---
The sov mechanics does not make space invulnerable, an alliance or coalition still needs to be able to mount a defense in order to keep their space, so your point is irrelevant to what i said. No alliance or coalition in this game is beyond eviction. It doesn't mean  that they are all vulnerable to be evicted at any time, it can take time, it can take changes in the diplomatic landscape for that to happen, it can take said alliance/coalition let their guard down, it can  take several events to happen in sequence of each other, it doesn't mean its impossible, and in the history of eve, those events often do happen regardless.
---
Also the Imperium was evicted with fairly similar sov mechanics, the only thing they didn't had was citadels, and no, citadels wouldn't have saved them, as we can see from their invasion of the north, if the attacker is willing to throw their superior supers and titan numbers against the wall of keepstar, no keepstar will be left standing.
---
And during world war bee, MBC was perfectly willing and seeking that kind of engagement with the Imperium.
---
As for the Rage comment, you completely missed my point, I'm not saying that the people who completely understood wh mechanics thought it was impossible, i'm not saying HK thought it was impossible, what i'm saying is that prior to it happening, the common sense knowledge was that it was impossible, yes that common sense knowledge was based on ignorance, but that's the point that i'm making, when you say that it wasn't doable to evict Legacy a year ago, that comment is in my opinion based on Ignorance, that might be fueled by how the war ended in the south, but ignorance nonetheless.
---
An example that i think is rather appropriate here is the Fountain war, everything was looking so well for Test+Friends a couple of weeks into the war, but then they had a string of defeats, heists, Sort Dragon selling a constellation to the CFC, high level members quitting from burn out, more heists, and then finally 6vdt, and then if things weren't bad enough they started to be farmed in Delve by a much smaller group (Pizza if i recall correctly) which put the final nail in Test coffin, and shortly after that they had to run to FW space, which made them an irrelevant force in Nullsec politics.
---
No, they have totally different loot tables. The abyss drops everything for previous triglavian ships, the invasions drop all of the things for the new triglavian ships
---
I don't like corps. They require online time and I work quite a bit.
---
Also as I said, I was part of [aharm for a good while in the past.](https://www.engadget.com/2010/09/17/new-eve-exploit-gives-wormhole-corp-incredible-advantage/)
---
So in total I've spent a bit more than 4 years in wh space. It's just too time consuming imo.
---
this is the best and worst post of the day at once
---
well done

Idiot.

Mass consumerism and indulgence are liberal ideals. I think you may just be stupid.

Yeh thats fair.

Only the statics will respawn about 1 minute after being rolled or dying, wandering wormholes are random - I've had a week of no wandering wormholes and a day of 10 at one time
---
If 200 bombers drop on a super. If it does not have a similar ability to pull people through a hole like said bomber wave, it simply will die in a matter of 30-45 seconds. Is anything that can jump in from a jump bridge going to save it? No. So - it's just a kill.  That's where I am going with this.  Basing everything off of delve is rough to balance. I say that having seen reaction times in other regions and watching stuff burn because form up time is 5-6 minutes and we see people die (our people). The better direction would be to spread people out and then work on cyno mechanics. I would be ALL for limitations both ways but that could still be messed with. Example: Max XYZ mass through a covert, like 20 bombers - well one of those bombers coming through lights another. Same for another cyno. Two faxes jump in - both light cynos. The issue is the density in some very specific localities.
---
we are scared
---
More an Eve problem both mentaly and mechanically. A huge majority of the player base join themselves to the safest largest group possible and avoid conflict with uncertain outcomes. This problem is compounded by the fact that there's very little reason to commit any heavy asset to a losing fight unless it assures turning the tide entirely. 
---
Right now we're just slowly seeing the logical outcome of that and a lot of disgruntled players who joined a group oblivious to the fact that the game has moved past anything but numbers being relevant in macro strategy. That frustration and helplessness is where the salt comes from.
---
kicking babies != shooting newbro's. From what I remember of my first few months of playing EVE my group got wardecced and I lost several ships. Luckily I had a few alliance mates who were awesome and helped me get back on my feet, but had that not been the case I wouldn't have been writing this comment right now :/
---
In other words "please dont do dumb shit and lose my irreplaceable space pixels"
---
And it has been a problem for a very long time. But I'm preaching to the choir here ^^
---
I'm actually a fan of the idea that the payouts for asset safety would partially go to the people able to secure that kind of item.
---
Open it to completely free to play. Sell advertising space everywhere. And offer 30 second watched ads for doubling damage or shortening cycle times or shortening training. /s
---
is it really collateral damage if its a PL ran trading network?
---
The carrier I lost while in a 15-20 man gang shooting an R32 or lower and was dropped by 50+ with dreads, titans and supers would disagree.
---
Wasn't an obvious PL asset either.
---
I mean he has identity issues IRL with a name like Jeronica. No surprise they follow him/her/it in game too.
---
No Viziam? 
---
Bro...
---
Personally, I enjoy the game better when JF wasn‚Äôt a thing. I liked how alliances would make an escort fleet to bring their valuables to a trade hub by gating it. I am against risk adverse play style in a hardcore pvp game. Risk vs rewards needs to be a balanced trade off. Near risk free with high rewards shouldn‚Äôt be an option in eve (IMO). I believe that mentality is what gotten us into the situation we are in today.
---
You are now shadow banned across all of reddit.

I kinda wonder if getting rid of killboards would help with this. I know a lot of people afraid to "ruin" their stats.
---
How are you ever going to get a subcaps in if you don‚Äôt bridge them? You talk as if you think the only thing that comes in through a cyno is caps and supers. If you don‚Äôt bridge or take jump bridge then you will never gate a subcap fleet fast enough to stop a hunting fleet before anything dies. 200 bombers kills rorqs really quickly
---
CCP Products.
---
Stop trying so hard
---
Cool, so it's just like when the Russians owned Dronelands. Same as it ever was. Same as it ever was.
---
No further indictments!
---
You are a massive fucking moron. Take your bullshit politics to your hugbox, leave that shit out of this game.
---
As if the only reason people aren't in null is lack of places to go.

OMG i love it

PL stopped in game services? what are we to do?
---
If the Amarr have anything, it‚Äôs weaponized Pride.
---
Splitting the server would probably kill both servers.
---
Imagine being this idiot named u/Archarial
---
How have I never seen this before. That was amazing
---
" We never agreed with that, and know that there is a HUGE community of players who are happy to live and thrive in highsec " Highsec dwellers have zero need for a nullsec based supercap yard.
---
That goes off of how valuable a player prioritize their ticks over tanks. A properly fitted super can survive long enough for a small specialized task force to counter the bombers. That is if the planning and jump bridge network was properly established prior the the drop. That is where im getting at. You have all the tools to do it, it you don‚Äôt properly strategize your space then yes, they get a juicy kill. I also don‚Äôt see a problem of 200 players in 70mil specialized ships for killing large targets that succeed in killing it. Especially when the super is fitted pure gank and no tank. There is a problem when they don‚Äôt and a bigger problem when the defender doesn‚Äôt establish a strategic JB network.
---
tbf, if it was all of nullsec we wouldn't be in this situation.
---
Glad that RMT scheming service is now gone
---
In my current region people are buying Plagioclase, Veldspar and Scordite at higher price per cubic meter than Kernite and Omber by a significant margin and I don't get why given their increased potential for reprocessing efficiency.  Do people just reprocess larger amounts of the basic ores because of the risk of low-sec ganking?
---
Also, people are buying plain Omber at nearly double the price of Golden Omber...?
---
Is this another "is eve dying?" Post? It is, isn't it? Oof
---
I don't think I would have ever figured that out without your assistance perc. You are a genius.
---
Yeah I liked how he mentions their services are for highsec players when you can't even take supers there.
---
Tldr they're gonna transfer it to sixth empire because they were collaborating with ncpl and gounes want to reset the region
---
Threads filled to the brim with üêùbad posters snapping their claws at the poor elite pvpers
---
I would like to hear your concern on this, could you elaborate?
---
Haven't played in about 4 years. End of casino war on TEST side/right before the PLEX change. I see Null Blocs are worse than ever. How's wormhole life looking? I am debating getting back into the game. Worth it?
---
Gayyy
---
I'm shocked I tell, shocked.
---
Ruing *your* game eventually has the same outcome as ruining *the* game after everyone else stops playing because it's been ruined for them.
---
The cyno is fine. The Jump-Drive is not. 
---
Who thinks being able to click twice, and then teleport six or seven systems away -- and reliably arrive within scram and web range -- is good gameplay? Who thinks an entire fleet doing this is good gameplay?
---
It was exactly the same thing 13 years ago. Don't act like anything changed. Small groups could not hold sov back then. They can't now.
---
Maybe *test laser, please ignore* ?
---
How do you live 4 years with 20bil damn
---
No, whats funny is mogul playing the victim and trying to portray goons as those horrible bullies who are picking on the highsec players, when their channels have PL plastered all over them and its pretty clear this is just another way for PL to run an indy operation without having their name or killboard closely associated with it.
---
Eve is dying; like everybody on this planet.
---
Does not shock me given how many null guys drop supers on my solo assault frigate.
---
Game is obviously dying faster than before anyone who denies this and clamors on about how "it's the summer" or whatever bs excuse they use to cope with the game becoming even more shit/stale is delusional and maybe retarded
---
That's blue lmfao whelping caracals to each other to amuse linemembers isn't being hostile
---
You don't need a sotiyo in nullsec to build destroyers for welp roams.
---
Are there circumstances that you would use a Reactive Armor Hardener on a supercarrier or titan?
---
The scope videos? World news articles? Terrorism in Amarr? Messages from Zorya? World Ark built in the abyss?
---
The first time I hear about Combat Wombat and it's news about them disbanding. Sad to see such a "quality" group go.
---
Another reason to not leave my browser and to never use the launcher to play EVE! 
---
No tidi and no interruptions to my rorqual mining - perfect!
---
Just need to settle up all this pesky war in the north rubbish using this tool and then I can finish mining enough to fund another rorq pilot! No deployment required, so my umbrella never has to go anywhere! Isn't Delve great?! Now no one ever needs to leave or come here!
---
There is a lot of lore in many of the skins...
---
A made up term mouthbreathers use to describe their world where all nullsec powers are in a war of annihilation with each other at all times.
---
A sov war with goons would be a loss for TEST and aids for both sides. So we just aren't at outright war.
---
If our leadership was retarded enough to antagonize goons into a sov war I'd fuck off to a wormhole because I wouldn't be able to get any content for months.
---
Actually, the Basgerin structures have been on the same grid as 6E's Keepstar from the first moment they got anchored. Relations with 6E and Max have always been good.
---
So, by your estimate, what steps should we take to ensure the health of Eve Online: Noted Space-themed Spreadsheet? I'll confess that we stumbled, ass over teakettle, into the role of "steward of the health of the video game," and we're a little lost on how to proceed.
---
Nice admission that your guide doesn't have those chapters either.
---
A lot has changed. There have been tons of small groups over the years that have owned space. This time 2 years ago wicked Creek and scalding pass were all small groups. Three years ago tenerifis, fountain, and Delve. Its incredibly dumb, and false, to pretend small groups couldnt own space the last 13 years.
---
i will be playing on an RPPVP i think. its what i was on way back in the day so...   that being said i dont know what servers will look like.  i want to hit the end game raids this time round
---
ive played private servers with vaevictus who has a  youtube following so i may swing with his guild when he makes it
---
Never implied relations were bad
---
I take it you haven't been a part of a defending force that had to slow boat to fight off bombers.
---
Hey! WH life is where it is at in Eve. Tons of C5 corps are rolling every night looking for fights. [Just look at all the corps getting tons of kills!](https://eve-tracker.org/whkills) 
---
People who play in everywhere but WH space seem pretty "Eve sucks!" right now. Nullsec seems to think they need a structure timer to fight and the titan blob has run out of control. FW need to be rebalanced. Highsec is highsec. No such problems in WH space. Make dank isk, scan static, get fights. It's awesome.
---
your an retarded
---
As a wormhole I will greatly miss the public supercap rigged sotiyo, where will I build the Moloks I steal from stupid goons now?
---
Yes, and hilmar is hoping you buy every one
---
I would combine every thread that has touched on this in the last 12 months and then collate all of the bullet points put forth by every single person, then put them to a vote with only 3 votes allowed per person. The top three would be the mandatory items CCP would have to resolve within the year or even 6 months. (obligatory or else). So - answer: player base actual voting on what they want and then doing it.   
---
&gt;Also - more marketing to grow the game.
---
GP poster is using the rare and majestic conversational bent of taking an obviously disingenuous assertion at face value and still managing to tear it apart. It's good shit.
---
Like everyone else, throw a supercap builder in Karmafleet and either sell it to goons, or safety it out to Aridia.
---
do whatever you want. I'm not ur dad.
---
well that's super rude
---
May the void take us all.
---
https://i.redd.it/qzv7hkegle431.png
---
&gt; and we're a little lost on how to proceed.
---
*thonking*
---
Is this on the Eve O podcast feed??  I want to download it!
---
its doable but just don't do it with a HS static or you'll be evicted as soon as someone notices it
---
a C3 w/ LS or NS would be OK as a starter pack... not a lot of traffic... do the sites when they come up, roll for k-space content
---
I did a C2 -&gt; HS/C3 and my astra was evicted within 3 months despite activity... there's only so much you can do as a solo player to deal with it... HS statics are the easiest targets. Would not recommend.
---
oh god so never
---
I'm really not trying to shit post you. I'm just not open to the idea of one side getting something and the other not. I haven't sat in a rorqual or super in a year outside of fleet options. It doesn't impact me, it just seems one sided.
---
Hmm.....
---
It is pretty damn passive though.  And that is not even the point.
---
Also I am pretty sure you all give moons far too much credit for 'content generation'.  
---
The perimeter market hub is essentially a static, mega-r-128 moon, that people have stopped fighting over.
---
ha ha ha ha so funny joke
---
The reactive armor hardener shines when you know you are going to be hit by one or two damage types. The Flex hardeners may be useful, but again you need limited damage types. In a real fight, you likely will see all damage types.
---
In most cases, Armor supers and titans are better off passive tanking. Shield supers and titans make better use of active hardliners.
---
There is no fucking way in all that is holy that 3 Nags are two cycling a Bastion in a C6. By saying so you are either 1) on crack, or 2) have never actually done one.
---
Instructions unclear; 'X'ing for ~~POS~~structure destruction.
---
You should do a C3 w/ a nullsec static then.
---
The other options are C2-&gt;NS/C5 (very popular, probably hard to get one on your own), or C1-&gt;NS (almost nobody would ever try to both you, lol! very niche style of hole)
---
Ye but why?
---
Sounds good. I'll trust you not to complain in a similar vein in the future, then? I'm glad we had this conversation.
---
Waahh someone doesn't know some space famous person in my alliance
---
What do you mean by slow boat to fight off bombers? What i am pointing out is how everything is in favor of the defender. Good ships to counter bombers are ass frigs, t3d, t1 crusiers, ect. (Hawks, jackdaws, caracals, ect). The options are there, the aggressor are organized, a defend should be too and have counter plays ready if a situation became unfavorable. Using faxes, cyno that once lite have no counters, faxes, carriers, or just bridging cruisers, t3 destroyers, hacs, t1 battleship, ect isn‚Äôt very tactical nor strategic. It makes for a very stagnant game play and is bad for the health and future of eve. Allowing players to crab to have big numbers in their wallet along with fancy ships in their hanger does nothing for the core of the game.
---
Mate try Gwent! It‚Äôs loads better than HS and really generous :)
---
i mean thats the opposite the guy didnt say youre too new and look spailike he said fuck you newbro so he can eat shit like his fleet did.
---
I spend 20-30b a month, I guess he flies a lot of cheap stuff or doesn't pvp.
---
I get it and i want you to keep commenting. I dont think your shit posting. I honestly think we are two sides that don‚Äôt understand each other game play. Im trying to explain my part while i take yours in.
---
goons cant seem to handle anyone that isnt them having fun. Not even talking about panfam but the butthurt goons have had over freeport structures that get used it hilarious.
---
You could have helped those pirates or just flown on by.
---
You dropped supers on my solo ratting myrmidon 5 years ago, I've waited 5 years to make this thread. Now NC. and PL will face the full humiliation I felt when I got laughed at for having a small hull repairer and a shield recharger on my battlecruiser. 
---
FUCKING OWNED LMAO
---
get i get fucking Zika last night
---
You can put a structure up and, as long as you don't go out of your way to annoy people and you keep it fuelled, you should be okay. But I wouldn't recommend soloing in J space, there's a lot of daily effort in scanning the chain that is much better shared with friends, and most of the PVP content will be too much for one player (even multiboxing).
---
A C2 (C3/HS) is probably the best for low effort - you get the HS for logistics and you can farm the C3 static for isk.
---
Let me help you - don't have 2/3 the map be blue.
---
Dude, just be happy I'm paying attention to you at all.
---
At some point in the near future one of you will run for Congress and have to explain to CNN what you meant by "urgaypwned"
---
Very nice.  Much like.  :)
---
Lesson 1, dont ever feel sorry for Jeronica. Good product or not dat guy will play you in a heartbeat.
---
I've been taking a lot of small fleets out lately (10-20) and it's really hard to get a fight, as in people won't show up. Granted this is because I am flying around the north.. but the only other response is indeed 50 caps and that sucks. I'm on the same page. I just don't like the notion of some nerd or five out in rorquals getting gang banged by 20-50 dudes. I'd want the fight that comes from that, the response of 40-50 subcaps. But the problem is the response is 40-50 titans and supers.
---
please never use the internet again
---
Lmao
---
You have a bs you roll with? Just trying to figure out everything before I hop into doing it myself hahah

Why would anyone go back to WOW. ESO yes wow noway.

im gunna agree with you here. i remember skillu tried to deploy to immensae for a second and gave up , besides the last brawl at UALX they havent done anything. might as well throw your dick around before you swear off the dick game anyway

Funny how we simultaneously manage to have "2/3rd the map be blue" (lol) and still find people to shoot. Well, things to shoot. Works for us.
---
We had a fountain fight last month or so. The dude did not get a cyno up before the jammer. It took around 2-3 minutes to get people to the right clone (which is part of the price you pay for being in three regions unlike some people) and to have enough to respond. We went from one system with about 40 Ferox's one gate, a bridge, one gate, a bridge, one gate. (would have been like 14 otherwise). The guys who got tackled pinged for help the moment they were tackled, but they didn't get the cyno up in time. So that was on them. Other than that, by the time we arrived the group of 40-50 T3Cs that had paradropped onto them had murdered two rorquals. So if you extrapolate that to a group of bombers dropping even 40 o 50 and response times of groups only being able to fly there... it's going to be very one sided. It's not going to result in fights, it's going to result in easy kills. The idea behind a rorqual is to get fights. (also, the idea was to murderfuck the ore market)
---
came for the comment, upvoted for the username.
---
That is awesome. Should not have ended that abruptly though.
---
a sovwar with goons from test would probably create the most content this game has had for years and get tons ofnpeople back in on that world war bee reboot
---
For now.
---
Nah, one fleet isn't that big a loss.  It's the "steal all the assets and offline the POSes" guys that made the interviews more....elaborate.
---
Vanilla was a good game my man
---
you used the wrong "their" in your 3rd grade english homework assignment, moron
---
Has Test blued them yet?
---
Eve Mogul 2 is gonna be fuckin' fire bro
---
why the hell would i want to fly somewhere with bubbles and giant ass fleets where im some nameless number in a big coalition of blues i dont even know
---
....are you really trying to flex your space guild affiliation on reddit?
---
Honestly, best to just join a corp. There are small and big ones, but it makes scanning and getting around easier. Plus gives you more bros to defend structures with. There are some bad men in wh space and they want your loot pinata
---
red for angry
---
I‚Äôd rather see a small cyno generator, something that had mass limits like WH‚Äôs do.
---
It's not like Skill u was not really active since they took Drone Region from DRF tbh. Don't get me wrong, I fucking love who they were I was really hoping to seeing them becoming the new PL and I'm sad about them leaving, but their disband is not really what makes TQ a 1 megacoalition multiboxing a bot empire
---
literally trillions are sitting in wh cits right now. You think everyone plays like a pussy in this game but they really dont
---
I'm not particularly worried about it. Spaceship fights aren't terribly interesting, anyways; they're just the imperfect mechanism by which we exert our will.
---
Thanks now this will be stuck in my head forever lol
---
LimpDickPutIn is an anagram of your name.
---
I mean, just cuz the ceo is like in pl, that isn't really evidence lol. In the reddit post he posted, he says it right there how impartial mogul is. I have used mogul's services a lot, they were very useful.
---
Even CCP had stopped using the slogan "EVE Forever" and Hilmar himself admitted all MMO has its lifespan with no exclusion of EVE itself last Fanfest or somewhere (can't remember where exactly)
---
The exact date for New Eden's heat death may be unclear, but EVE is surely dying
---
That but in a c2-LS/C2
---
From a goon prospective. There are groups that specialize in camping and waiting around to drop on anything. On average these groups can occupy several regions of space 23/7. So you want to give the hunter/s the only way to be found is probing? Meaning that someone has to combat 23/7.
---
make sure the lawyer knows Texas law...
---
Level 5s!
---
Eve was he dead eventually but most days it a meme.
---
So spaceship fights aren't interesting, but structure bashing is? What is "interesting" to you?
---
short and sweet, just like the life of the Keepstar!
---
With all due respect, I found the phrase "Public Super Cap Production" funny
---
How else was PL suppose to launder all that rental RMT?
---
I have some 1000 iq plan brewing up
---
Jeronica is a member of PL, building a structure and saying it is a public structure in PL space anyone can build under then shocked when we kill said PL members structure and claim innocence.
---
obviously he uses more than the f1 button - look at that headshot post you're responding to
---
I feel you on that one brother! A lot of the content was killed off because its too complicated now than it was in earlier years. WH was a great place to make money and stock up pvp ships to welp thru connecting WH. Now its more of a grind to make that same revenue. Nullsec receive huge buff in the pass that shouldn‚Äôt of happen. One being the 10/10 escalations. Not to cry it out on here. I just want that content back. I want that reason to log in and cause havoc. Content been gimped so hard i feel the game is in desperate needs of a rewind. There‚Äôs been a lot of great changes, but they bad has been left unchanged. Most of the player i known left eve when everything started becoming adverse. This is also why some players scream for a reset, not a skill reset and everyone starts over. A reset to when eve was a extremely dangerous place to be.
---
hit and run troll
---
when it's a front for NCPL to generate revenue, yes, we have an issue with it
---
Because that is a facility they could and would use to just start building again.  It is owned and managed by a member of PL.
---
I like this story. But bummer on burning the spy on what seems a pointless en-devour.
---
this is a very long winded way to say "no u", shouldn't have wasted your time tbh
---
You gotta be terrible at this game to have that happen. Hisec static, no citadel, less than 1 bil worth of ships in the hole.
---
I agree with this despite my post. 
---
My idea of first time dipping into FCing though is taking out a rag tag group and just ratter hunting and that kind of thing. It builds the basics of having a planned route, giving fleet orders, using fleet warps, making calls on getting out when appropriate and all that kind of stuff. That‚Äôs why I said small fleets are easier.
---
Eve now reminds me of playing Risk, 5 turns before the end of the game. One player was allowed to hold north and south america for several turns, and now decides to roflstomp the rest of the board.
---
A cyno preheating cycle will hurt hunters more than the hunted
---
Are you really that fucking stupid?  The CEO of said corp is in PL, members of the command staff of PL are in the private channels of a discord chat of that corp and it isn't evidence, holy shit.
---
You should have Voted Xenuria.
---
‚Ä¢a twitter account with no activity since 2016  
---
‚Ä¢last login to pl forums in 2018, probably to see a corp app that was linked to me, or actually probably to get my horde alt services working or something?  
---
‚Ä¢an AMA that says the same stuff we've told goon people we are in contact work  
---
you really got me good tuz  
---
you know what's actually missing from your exhibitions, the evewho page: https://evewho.com/pilot/Jeronica where I haven't been in PL since 2017. You can argue MC is in that coalition and you'd be mostly right I suppose. I did leave whenever MC folded and joined PL.  
---
The only really "incriminating" thing there is that DJ and doom are in a channel I set up to shoot siege green. After reaching out to multiple autz groups finally dj heard about it. You can ask either of them (not like you'd believe it), they haven't received any isk anyway because another deal was made with siege green and i havent adjusted channel roles. In fact most of the isk goes to highsec mercs. The relevant people have the breakdown of how much Mogul is supporting NCPL's SRP efforts lol
---
"*Just because he fucked a goat doesn't mean that he's always a goat fucker.*"
---
&gt; How could anyone enjoy a game I don't?
---
I mean, Tuzy is head of GSOL and is a rather frequent poster. You just look dumb now.
---
Why do you really want to shake with new rules. It will be worse : the imperium will adapt more than everbody. Like rorqual nerf; people thought it will be a big nerf of goon but at least it s a big deal only for small alliance that cant help their rorqual.
---
they aren't even trying hard with the narratives anymore, it's too simple
---
you don't have a super
---
The work that goes into reddit posting and goalpost moving. I think in the last year I've seen one Querns post that I liked. 
---
I don't even remember what it is.
---
Yes because people out of your alliance care about gsol
---
1) Jeronica was indeed in PL - 4 years ago.. You may want to look at evewho sometimes or maybe I don't know ask someone who has a clue lol?
---
2) Mogul discord is full of goons too.
---
\&gt;incredibly dumb
---
\&gt;test flair
---
seems right
---
I Agree it was like 10 years ago.
---
Somehow the voice already echoing inside my head
---
I haven't watched the video yet
---
The amount of actual mental retardation emanating from goons lately is impressive.
---
I added context to my arguments because i was under the wrong impression that you replied to me with the intent of engaging in a discussion. I can see how that wasn't the case, and i did indeed wasted my time replying to you.
---
L5s are in lowsec only and people massivley inflate their "isk/hr" when running them. You run the missions for LP anyways, and since L5s are empire faction LP, its not worth that much (compared to pirate, SoE, or CONCORD LP). You also cant flood the market with your faction store items lest you run the risk of devaluing your LP even more.
---
In that case, it seems like theres some kind of stacking bug yea.
---
Check your pm.
---
The decline is already irreversible. Bad mechanics have been in place for too long, to the point where content creators have left in droves and likely will never return again. Even with a change as large as Phoebe that completely shakes up the game, it'll be too late. 
---
On top of that, there isn't really a whole lot of appeal for a new player to start the game and actually stick with it. You get them here and there, but ultimately I feel like the vast majority realize that without MCTing huge amounts of money into the game, it will take months before they can actually enjoy themselves.
---
I was kinda afk from EVE for a bit last year and was flipping options on the irl market as a hobby and I had a REALLY good day where 4 of my larger positions went green as fuck. I excitedly forwarded a screen shot to my buddy with the message "*LOOK AT ALL THIS DANK FACTION LOOT!*" not even thinking about what I was saying.
---
PURGE DNG
---
I‚Äôm being generous with the benefit of the doubt man.
---
I think your reply and not the content sums up his post.
---
What's the casino war?
---
I don't really understand your 'solo how?" question, as industry is mostly a solo endevour.
---
I do industry all sec, but mostly hisec.
---
My industry alt corp(s) have kind of merged with a friend's over the years, so we now share facilities.  I usually manage them, and he usually anchors them, and I find out about them when they need fuel.  Before that though, I had my entirely my own.
---
We have structures in hisec.  Most of our losses are there - at least 9 Raitarus lost, with only one remaining.  Before that lost at least 3 large towers.  Have had an offline Astrahus in a major hisec system for at least a year now; would lose if I tried to unanchor.  I maintained a large hisec POS in hisec until Raitaru were released, and had two hisec towers to myself at one point.  Later, I had a small hisec tower solely for reprocessing.
---
Have structures in lowsec.  Only two Upwell losses so far (I think) - Raitaru and Astrahus, and both were replaced in exact same spots.  Before Upwell, lost at least 9 large towers, probably more.
---
Have structures in nulsec.  Though have been mostly Raitaru, tried an Azbel and it is slated to die this week.
---
Have had stuctures in w-space.  That was a while ago.  Only loss was a offline reaction POS, since it wasn't profitable at the time.  I had my own large POS; I had moved much industry here from hisec tower, and soon realized that was a mistake.
---
Have also used alliance structures when not renting.  I think I gave away more stuff to members that I manufactured during that time, than sold for profit.  Corp kicked me.
---
The changes to industry really require about 6 Raitaru to cover all the bases, otherwise you end-up being in high-index systems using other people's structures (tax amounts are usually of no consequence compared to index).
---
I like that attitude you fit in perfect booboo
---
I did this for years, eventually running a fleet of 7 freighters to move the ice and products. 
---
It's quite profitable, just mind-numbing. I quit once I got a nice nest-egg built up to pay for plex for the next few decades.
---
Neither. I like being sneaky. I like building and running empires. Doing things like, say, ninjasiegeing the entirety of delve and stealing all the R64s for myself, and providing a position of strength to negotiate from for my alliance, is way more fulfilling than shooting some krab. (This is an actual thing I did.)
---
&gt; My goonie brethren told me to wait till deployment is over to use them. I can't sell, or trade them to anyone or I get purged.
---
Oh noes, not my precious WIDOT. Whatever will I do?
---
TBF left spvg cause Valk was a angry cunt far far to much for simply roaming delve
---
Who are you talking to?
---
No it's not. I'll figure out how to get it on that feed :) it will be on Google podcasts, Spotify and iTunes as soon as the approval process is done.
---
&gt;hurr durr PL don't like industry and love killboards
---
You guys need some updated memes
---
I played Dungeons and Dragons Online (DDO) for  years\*. "DDO is Dying" was one of the most common forum themes every year. I am pretty sure it still exists.
---
\*the first six months were fun.
---
will eve "die"? define that death. do you mean go offline or just become something that you don't want to play.
---
That might take a while to happen again - I hope they have a super chair to sit in while they wait.
---
That is where the fun begins.
---
When have they done this since WWB?  
---
Must have been during an overwatch outage or something.
---
I didn't think I'd need to clarify that by "you" I meant Goons, not you personally based on the fact that 3 posts earlier you said:
---
&gt; Well, things to shoot. Works for **us**.
---
I doubt your average line member is driven to log on day-to-day by alliance level intrigue. Without them, your alliance is nothing. But maybe your delusions of grandeur really are as big as I think and you actually don't recognize this.
---
Nice!  You can try talking to Dirk Magirk from Talking in Stations, I think he has a hand in managing https://totaleve.com/ and the podcast feed (or he can tell you where to go at least).
---
Maybe it is becoming the most hated entity in the game, because that has been a phenomenal success.
---
ccp said a lot of shit, this one in particular is completely dumb and riddled with statistical misinterpretations
---
Templis lost interest in the war zone long ago (they'd stopped actively plexing even before fed up and others swept the wz). I suspect it's unlikely they would return to the war zone unless there's an overhaul of FW mechanics to make it appealing to them. I'm surprised bloc haven't disbanded at this point and just folded their remaining active members into templis tbh.
---
I started playing this game because of the wide number of playstyles and the inherent risk of it all. Most playstyles are now gone/unviable, and there is much less risk in almost everything. Its so fucking hard to log in now.
---
Yeah, lower risk aversion leads to more ship loss as well, and being very risk averse might also lead to early unsubbing.
---
How could I possibly know what's interesting to every member of my alliance? It's such a pointless question to ask, I assumed that you would know better than to ask it of my entire alliance, and simplified it to personal motivations.
---
Regarding the alliance level, who cares? We'll figure out something. You don't worry your pretty little head about, mmkay? It's not our job to shepherd the game. It's not yours either.
---
Also note that there's eight independent/small corp players (one who is also the editor-in-chief of INN) on the board, including myself.
---
I'll be going horde! Unfortunately I'll have minimal play time but I think it will still be worth it  for the open world pvp and low lvl bgs. My dream pvper was a 39 enhancement shamz with a pendulum of doom 2 h axe. I'm making it happen this time! It's my only goal with the classic release.
---
fun fact: the second to last chronical we got was tied to a SKIN purchase.
---
Can you really have the words mining and isk in the same sentence without a not in there somewhere? Can you even have the words interting and Eve in the same sentence? 
---
j/k I frigging love this game and one day I will win and all will bow before me. In that moment my humility will shine.
---
With the war they've all gained confidence and started posting more it's gross ü§¢
---
Lol noob
---
Not sure they were listening to the PVP minority either, there was a sharp drop in pvp content ever since they introduced the arena's and duel options. Each "balance pass" also creating horrible imbalances between the classes, the winning move was to build a character of the shittiest class so in the next balance pass it would be super overpowered for as long as possible.  
---
Not to mention the fuck up in tower wars where one side had an unstoppable root and AOE'dd that killed everyone in one hit for like a year. (think of it as the old school original grid wide titan DD through a cyno, but only one side gets to use it)  
---
My focus for a long time was TL5 tower pvp, also dabbled in pvp at all other levels and had TL7 alts of almost all professions. If you ever used Dnet I was the original developer who created that before the servers got merged together.  
---
Its a good thing the game died before I played EVE, the population was not ready for the mentality of an EVE player.
---
Just bubble the next baltec fleet and consider it an op success like that one guy did
---
OMG 
---
just looked at Hearthstone. makes Eve look better in comparison.
---
Edooty pls. Dng is recruiting btw
---
I like you
---
There is a big difference between "every member of (your) alliance" (what you paraphrased) and "average line member" (what I actually said). I was hoping to get some actual insight here but now I realize I'm wasting my time because you either refuse to or are incapable of getting the point.
---
Enjoy winning null-sec and remaining completely insufferable to the rest of the community.
---
Are you also pushing papers? No way!
---
You rang?
---
Oh, I guess not.
---
In that case,
---
QUIT POKING MEEEEE.
---
HA. Excellent.
---
Good you're putting your EvE skills to use though.
---
Its like you didn't even play the game last year at all.
---
The old ones are still based in reality, why fix what isn't broken?
---
Congratulations; the entire point of my post was to underscore the fact that players cannot, will not, and should not hold themselves responsible for the health of the game.
---
Also, we will enjoy winning. Immensely. We also have no desire to be held in high regard by the rest of the game. Why would be? Don't project that desire onto us, please.
---
Had to reset my password to upvote this comment... Worth it :)
---
illusory truth effect in action
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
&gt; Enjoy...remaining completely insufferable to the rest of the community
---
nobody cares about your paper pushers mate
---
Did you not read what I said about that? You're saying that like it is something we'd wish to avoid. We're cool with being hated by everyone.
---
For the swarm!
---
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by scam buy orders, but any low broker's fee market could be used for such a purpose. I don't know what you're trying to insinuate because covering your tracks is so easy, every player can use the markets for any purpose, and any sensible scammer doesn't shit where they work. It'd be dumb to make your own markets look shady, and what would there be to gain?
---
&gt; You're saying that like it is something we'd wish to avoid.
---
No, not really. Anyway. For real I'm done this time. You continue to reply to random points that I didn't make and wildly misinterpret pretty straightforward comments. I am convinced you are either on or borderline on the spectrum after this conversation. 
---
Have a nice day. Go fuck yourself.
---
As an ENTIRELY independent cancer on the underbelly of this great game...

I have no idea what is going on or what any of this means for me.

---
Does anyone in goons upper leadership trust you at all lol?
---
If you take it to Jita, you can double it.
---
Yeah, you actually are. Why would you even say something like "remaining completely insufferable" if you didn't think it was a negative? Shit's clad in your own personal viewpoints. You want to be liked. You want it so much that you turn *not* being liked into an insult to use at people or groups you don't like.
---
Don't get me wrong; there's nothing wrong with that. It's a perfectly normal human desire. The problem comes when you assume everyone else wants it too, especially in a sociopathy aquarium like Eve Online.

You sure they aren't just allies because they want to be on the winning side?
