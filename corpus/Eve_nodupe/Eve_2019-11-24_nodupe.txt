I’m still relatively new to the game. What I don’t understand is when someone uses the word solo which means one such as Uno and yet it’s either do a boxing or otherwise has an alt. I just don’t understand the complete misuse of language.
---
---
---
I think I was? Can you elaborate? :)
---
And you are surprised? Why? They just tried no local in NS and we lost a ton of players. Now we should get rid of asset safety? The players of today won’t stand for it.
---

---
Asset safety is never going away and I can see why even hardcore players don’t want to see it removed. If had all of my stuff and I went on a two week to a month vacation and came back to years of stuff being gone I would be pissed. If I had to move ALL of my stuff before every vacation I would also be pissed.
---
That software would have to be injected in the client and therefore be against the ToS though
---
No, without log files in the client you couldn't do that easily or without violationg the ToS. Not having a audio notification pop up would be a huge improvement. It wouldn't be perfect but a lot more kills would be possible.
---
Ye, in a 200km titan DD contest, neuts wont really matter for the tank.
---
Every mmo I've played that a gm talked to me I loved playing. Deva should be super active in the game.
---
About fucking time.
---
Win10 is better in every way, and will probably run smoother.
---
If you HATE the idea of the “assistant” and store things, look up Win10 long term servicing channel, it is a version of Win10 stripped down, what Win10 Pro should be.
---
The log off/on seems to work ok, at least if its done every few hours. Will poke you if we build up a stack of missed kills.
---
Never understood why we have to have chat log files in the client. Other than enabling intel tools it is useless in most cases. There have been very few cases over the years where I found the name of a player via logs when I forgot to save it somewhere but that's about all I can think of.
---
Sounds like a you problem that you can't fuel a citadel.
---
Fuck.
---
This used to be "FC" instead of Siri.
---
Back when you were actually flying fun fleets.
---
k
---
C an I haveyo ur stuff?
---
There is no such thing as a stupid question. You are stupid for calling others stupid for asking questions.
---
Titans and supers dropping would be terrible for the long term health of the game, because it makes all keepstars into priority 1 targets.
---
Now unless you are in a group that has an unassailable amount of titans, your titans are at risk of getting looted by a group with even more titans, who then adds your looted titans to their already superior stockpile.
---
Sad velocity modifier
---
You say that, but over a week in and my recruit a friend Sp hasn’t shown up. Ticketted after the first day but no reply. Also no skipping spree for the last week while it was active. Quality new player experience.
---
I might as well be the first to toot thine own horns. We have a long track history and record of contract completion and secrecy. Plus you know our Blackout video is CCP/EvE famous along with our greatest religion. 
---
All praise and GLORY to Thaddeus Drake, for he shall lead you to the glory of cynosural field to smite all non-believers... and with that I pass.
---
You don't get to have it. CCP decided when they created Pirate Capital ships that there would only be three of them per faction, even if more could make sense. Serpentis have a titan, super, and a dread. Blood Raiders have a titan, dread, and FAX. Gurristas has a titan, dread, and FAX. Angels were supposed to have a titan, carrier, and FAX.
---
What you see here is CCP's mock up of what a carrier would be. They then decided on their "three for each faction" policy and didn't make the Vangard a reality.
---
It would.
---
You see that post about the Pokémon go grandpa with like 47 phones on his bike?
---
Imagine Eve Autism like that.
---
Thank Kesha. Finally.
---
I love you Tristan. Have fun in your next adventures babe.
---
RIP to the end of one of the greatest groups I've ever been part of in online gaming.
---
Keshs bless us all in these sad times.

---
The Amarr have one, his name is Templar Dane
---
&gt; Still seems wise to try to stay anonymous if you can. Nearly all devs outside of those whose voice we'll recognize can manage that. And even for those we do recognize, sometimes you can get away with, "huh, that's weird, I guess I do sound like him".
---
Nope, wrong approach. Most people don't know what their own voice really sounds like; so the right thing to say is "Do I really sound like that?"
---
Also, this happens as is. We have a dude in corp who got a title for sounding so much like a former corp member that several people were convinced it was him.
---
Great video. Really enjoyed it. Hope you do more
---
There's always a bigger fish
---
F
---
so it's not a local chat solution
---
&gt;This is a shit excuse.
---
tapi poster lol
---
&gt;A lot of people helped to make dng what it was.
---
none anywhere close to what he did, it's not even close
---
were you in dng? or are you just talking out your ass lol
---
super highway connecting the market hubs?
---
\*you\* do it. I can't bring myself to it.
---
backstory: Corp member was scanning the chain and found a bunch of hanger containers in a c1. This was one of the cans. Another one of the cans includes an azbel and a bunch more trit and P1
---
Its a person with enough alts and friends that he can effectively cloaky camp an entire region
---
If devs are feeling lazy, which they usually are.
---
you had to run an eve corp
---
you'll be fine
---
i had to come back and check. nice.
---
Link Wh entrance via PM and i take Care of this
---
People trained their all-purpose alts into Titans and Titan alts into more general purpose things after Keepstars allowed that. If you go back to the "space coffins", those people will probably quit from CCP making their investment useless.
---
Who?
---
Big loss to the community, there was always fun to be had burning through Amarr space shitposting and vs'ing these guys. I played with them for a while and loved every minute of it, grats on winning eve Tristan hopefully see you spamming rookie chat after the wedding o7
---
From Injectors.
---
Don't uae implants for this calculation, as the potential SP from implants is technically infinite. They provide value up until their destruction -- which might never happen for station traders and the risk averse.
---
except its a c1 so the biggest thing you can use to haul anything out is a DST
---
Don't forget that the Wormhole will most likely collapse so you need to reroll and rescan!
---
Sweet, more stuff to hack!
---
Small changes, as long as they keep iterating on them short term, are perfect. They don't massively upset balance nor piss everyone off. The only problem is if they wait until 2030 to make the next iteration, but I'm willing to see what they do with it.
---
Music that matches the game is whatever you have in your playlist.
---
I personally like progressive metal while scanning.
---
It's probably just the shared PLEX market linked to the phone they already talked about.
---
every single null entity also has the same chance to farm anything null offers but goons do it within a single region, with titans, 4991745 faxes and supers on the standing fleet and they recruit everyone and they are the biggest alliance. If drifters had a loot, then goons could use boson titans and it would not be challenging when their dps can be tanked with all those faxes.
---
Lol yeah about Bosons which is more like throwing confetti now. Bosons got nerfed dead.
---
Else test and horde also has a good super cap fleet. The only thing that really differs is that goons are extremely organized. 
---
I mean so you still play the game or are you just ranting because of goons?
---
Can you elaborate how pulling info from memory is modifying the client?
---
The last real update that the game got was the triglavian timed "dungeons" and the new itemization that come with it.
---
Ccp does not understand that most players will not play a MMO without an constant influx of new content, and that pvp is considered "content" only by a fraction of their player base.
---
The fact that sharing bookmarks is advertised as a main feature is honestly depressing.
---
also, even if AT comes back they will never allow abyssal rolled modules.
---
Are we even playing the same game? They've done a fair bit more than "small changes every few years", my dude.
---
He probably wants a crew that can actually win:):p
---
Jk, why is the meme "volta are bad" a thing? Seen it thrown around a lot but have no idea why.
---
&gt; If they fix the problem the krabs quit quickly and CCP panics.  EVE probably gets back the slow, constant growth it once had, but at what cost?
---
If you think chaos era grade "fixes" would cause eve to get back slow, constant growth you're absolutely incorrect. The loudest "elite PvP" shitposters don't want to fight each other, so they quit too, as blackout evidenced. The "look at me I'm having so much fun and everyone is resubbing" stopped after a week. People wanted easy kills, when those weren't around, they got bored.
---
You've never flown AFs or HACs, have you?
---
I can get behind making marauders more useful in PvP, TBH. Maybe if they got a damage buff and/or had some speed under siege. Would be a good subcap counter to cap fleets.
---
This, on the other hand, is a pretty bad idea.
---
Okay...why? What's the point? Where do you see this as needed? You could have taken away all the bullshit useless formatting and used the screen space for an actual description of what problems you see in the current meta and why and how this is needed to address them.
---
Solo multiboxing. Purely solo brawling would be even more horrible experience.
---
It doesn't have a progress bar. It just keeps on going till it finishes. The internet speed is bad right now. Can we check how much to download or we have to wait until it finishes.
---
Nice change. Would have been nice 4 years ago when more people where playing.
---
i welcome you to share a fit that has 2000 hp/s passive regen.
---
No theyre not which is the point. No other implant set is as widely used as attribute implants and thats just a fact. The way skill learning works makes it really bad to not touch attributes. Its not just some random thing in the way you are presenting it. Its a key factor that is based on a very old idea that no longer serves a valid point but only creates a bigger rift between old players and newer players.
---
That is literally what a bad game mechanic is. Something that is irrelevant but just causes issues.
---
Adolf Hilton the toon was named. I won the right to keep that name (but changed it anyways). Shortly after the naming policy was revised.
---
I wonder why? Hmmmm...
---
Yeah excellent question
---
That and a deep fax where meant to come out with deep ship yards but they kinda stalled on the whole ship yards thing. Like incursions
---
Can you keep your political BS out of our Game please? Thanks
---
&gt;Why are you making my game political?
---
I'm not, you can blame the supremacists for that. As mentioned in one of the videos I referenced, racial supremacy has moved online in a big way and EVE online's community is the perfect target for them. As a straight white nerdy western male, I can confirm that a significant percentage of EVE's player base is of a similar demographic. The exact kind of people white supremacists target for indoctrination. It's hardly a surprise that a group like Asatru exists within EVE Online, the real shock is that nobody called it out sooner in any significant way.
---
Clarification please. Upwell structures are designated by CCP as Medium, Large and X-Large
---
No medium structures means... what exactly:
---
No Structures at all?
---
Only Large and X-Large?
---
CCP forgot no structure is designated "Small" and actually mean Large? (Ergo only Mediums allowed)
---
Love ya too mate
---
now every mistake will often have a name. most often the same as the name of the developer
---
so are you actuaally telling me, that QA let production deployment even they were aware of the bug?
---
good
---
Yeah I know the game. It's one of the things I loved about eve. Everyone is a sociopath out to get ya. I hope your right. But I have been eve  free for 2 months now and the very idea of playing nausiates me. Maybe one day I'll start up again. But I doubt it. Anyway fly safe. o7
---
UFC is recruiting! Join the forest.
---
I would give it to ya but I gave my account to a friend of mine. Rl freind who got irrationally angry when I told about it. Decided to use my account to fuck the corp over. Dont know how it went but I imagine most of the isk is gone.
---
we never got banned m8, we got transported to outer ring and asked to be quiet about it.
---
Listen to his podcast, they're back for sure
---
It's a lowsec guy.  So for the nulltards out there that don't know.....bombs don't work in lowsec.
---
Thanks for the copy pasta
---
[deleted]
---
Who was it that dropped you? Some groups drop small in the hopes of getting a response, before dropping the hammer. - Perhaps your corp leaders knew more than you did, and chose to not whelp their supercap group saving a cheap ratting ship.
---
This sounds like provi bloc
---
Corp not withstanding I haven't been happy with the games development since fozzy sov dropped jump fatigue. Eve was on life support for me and this was just the doctors pulling the plug. I would have simply moved to another corp as I have in the past. But the state of the game made the decision to quite easier then finding a. New corp.
---
you will never outcompete bots in a 1hz game with limited inputs and most activities consisting of a simple flowchart, there's almost nothing you can do in eve that a bot can't
---
None of our business. It’s between Pitts and Goons.
---
No it's not. And this is important: don't cross the line from thoughts to real harm. 
---
Those who fight monsters should take heed lest they themselves become the monsters.
---
Remember, your ideological opponents are human too.
---
Perhaps I should clarify that a I  was not a krabb. And b the whole point of that fleet was to drop in situations like that.
---
Then do it. Stop hemming and hawing about it here and just do it. Leave the game behind. Right now what you are trying to do is drip poison into the remainder of the community.
---
Eh if the was the case I wouldn't have quite. My corp was a tight knit group. Nah they were just laughing and making jokes about it in discord. It wasn't a case of saving a ratting ship. It was. A case of my corp choosing to turn there backs on me. Worst part fo it is that I cant think of a good reason why they did it. Wasnt like I was toxic or a nausince I for the most part kept to myself. I was the quite guy in corp. Only joined conversation when someone had a question.
---
Personally if the marauder could use a tech i cyno. Id be happy with it. Maybe a defender bonus and range bonus for smartbombs
---
Totally my bad, I assumed your carrier pilot was not your main.
---
Heres the real killmail:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78805094/
---
You are definitely more savable then I though, though how long did it take you to die?  You did the right thing and killed the cyno, stoping them from bringing more in. If I was the cap FC that was around I would be very scared to drop on carreries without intel and with them still having a cyno toon.
---
What is even more spooky is what would have happened if there was an escalation? Carebears FC would have had to ask PanFam for support, you were totally out of range to be having a cap fight.
---
Dude I was there. I know exactly what happened. I know for a fact that the only reason they didnt undock was becuase they were being assholes. No other reason exists. I know all the details. I know the reasons. I know the factors. Read thru the other comments on this thread and you will see exactly what happened.
---
And yet... people eat this shit up...
---
then find a new corp, and find a new activity, try something new with better people before you quit.
---
True though when working with turrets there is only so many bonus you can do.
---
Though i tried to gear more towards long rage bonuses vrs damage application bonus. The tech ii hype gets a tracking bonus as all roden ships do.
---
Which goon FC will get kicked now :(
---
Clearly you don't know what your talking about you can kill any cap with 20 or 30 component pilots in subs... But guess if you have no skill I can see how you would come to that conclusion... Most whaling gangs are 20 guys highly skilled and designed to do one thing.
---
And because of yolo it means no srp too.  Glory vs brains.
---
Love the AT question:
---
&gt; Yes/No, are you bringing AT back?
---
* Goes on a 3 minute talk about it...
---
CCP fired the one guy who promised to have it back by the end of this year, so no, it's not coming back... Can you at least be honest about ANYTHING?
---
Name checks out 😂
---
Link?
---
already got tons of ships already paid and taking dust. Might as well use use/lose them first :p
---
Looking forward for content in The Expanse.
---
kthen
---
That crappy Rag was already replaced... because no officer mod was lose.
---
I bet yall were pissed when you saw the value of that can and realized you could do nothing about it
---
Porpoises have an ore hold iirc and this is minerals so they dont go in ore holds
---
Try not joining the main Corps, Karma fleet, Ph inc, Dreddit.
---
Instead, join a more close nit group working within the alliance.
---
A small corp like CapF with a dedicated MO, If the bad guys have capital ships, CapF wants them dead.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnrlVXHafFs
---
Remember no matter what corp you join in a big alliance, they will hide lots of content behind closed doors. Make sure to actively engage in your corp and earn their trust, being an asset to your corp will always end up being the funniest way to play the game.
---
Uh, why are we restricting structures in hostile sov? That's not the problem. That's content creation....We don't need to make it easier to turtle up in space.
---
implying it takes nearly the same amount of effort to make a citadel as it takes to kill it
---
In that case your 1b/h is a heavily overstated average number. You might have had a good day or two in a row, but I’ve been super ratting for years and no way is 1b/h a realistic number all things combined. Yes there have been times I effectively hit that, but we are talking averages here.
---
implying difficulty and tedium are the same thing.
---
they're very much related, especially in a video game based around tedium and difficulty being balancing factors
---
Into a folder? How do you end up with all these different files with the same name not in a unique folder that couksnt have jist been put in a folder to begin with?
---
ITS DEAD JIM
---
&gt; FYI, for me that's deception (which is ok in Eve, but for new players it comes across as blatant lying).
---
dude what
---
+1 for the homeworld reference
---
Blew the Dreadbomb on a T1 Rigged Rag. Good stuff.
---
whalers in our space that have been ragerolling and hunting for 8h now?
---
rightclick jump
---
ppl attacking one of our 50 tz tanked citadels?
---
sure, attacking and defending totally requires the same effort
---
Never paid insurance to incursion group in 7 years of flying
---
so you're saying a fleet of, say, t3cs should be able to kill a fleet of titans and supers? why?
---
Are you boys actively recruiting?
---
You're still missing the point. D&amp;D stats have no influence on rookie SP injection, or on veteran SP injection. And getting rid of the D&amp;D stats would leave SP injection in the exact same state it's in.
---
They are also like family, grant you a lot of opportunities, fleets, fights, mining, industry, whatever you like
---
It looked as if coyote really wanted to say something interesting on the future of cap / subcap  but was winding his own neck in.
---
Well done!
---
Ahhh got it, thought only duels were set up like that. So he basically baited a newplayer into a LE, next time imma just repair/scoop my mtu and let them be. Thanks for your explanation bud :)
---
What's the point of that, though? Surely you want to maximise everyone's fun, and that means undocking with a good fit and not just feeding?
---
if you're just storing stuff put it in an npc station I've had 2 citadel up, I didn't store anything in them that wasn't an active project. they became isk sinks.
---
It does if you are FRT who lost 2 wars to Legacy.
---
Basically a NORMAL FUCKING TITAN not a braindead shitfit that deserved to die anyway.
---
Either: 1: Access to multi-regional markets or 2: re-birth of the Interbus delivers your goods for you.. maybe both
---
Can’t those be compressed too?
---
Trigger Happy is making some waves in Tribute as well
---
Keep it up!  New content is always needed.
---
But adding radically new content all the time is only going to lead to a stack of poorly-optimized and unpopular features.
---
There's a lot to unpack here to be sure
---
hahahahaha
---
Try not being a dick to the new fish for a change
---
Whats ur timezone newbro :-)
---
Blaze up.
---
o\\
---
Tried Googling it? Because really, just pick up some BPOs, research their efficiency, then start invention on them at a suitable station/Upwell-thing and pray to RNGesus
---
This one resurfaced recently; many of the logs that don't appear in the logserver still appear in the in-game tool. There was a Reddit post a while back about how people were able to spot when they were on-grid with cloaked players. It's apparently been fixed but I'm not sure to what extent.
---
we are where the content is, come say hi some day :)
---
What are bombers going to do vs a bunch of fighters and haw dreads?
---
Your mom is too fat to fit through the jump gate
---
OP:
---
  &gt;Not interested in being in krab empire
---
  You:
---
  &gt;SeRiOuSlY, **ChEcK oUt GoOnS**
---
the fact that it doesn't matter is the problem
---
So exactly who was this pre-arranged with?
---
Damn straight!
---
Given how many of the early Titan Pilots they poached from test I'd say they didn't.  Just a bigger SP requirement
---
&gt; I think it's good for junior FCs to learn early how battles play out in 2019.
---
So they learn early it's best to quit and go play something else?
---
Nice kills guys, keep it up!
---
This is sort of adorable. Keep up the good work guys.
---
The seeds of PVP have been planted.
---
You clearly have absolutly 0 clue what the fuck you are talking about
---
That was epic but damn im sure they could have got the falcon? Anticap dreads will wipe it in 2 volleys, if it can be locked in time. But damnnnn that was epic :D
---
TROLLPOST FAKE NEWS, NO-ONE DROPS CAPS IN CATCH, THATS CRAZY
---
And to pre-arrange a fight u actually have to talk to the other party, we didnt know til they were 3 jumps out.
---
If you want to do arranged fights just go to sisi. If you want to pretend-fight you might as well pretend-fight on the pretend server.
---
Arranged fights on TQ should be dropped on every opportunity!
---
Class 3 wormhole
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Thanks
---
No, he's talking about WHs, not 0.0.
---
NP. Run some of the ones in Delve, they can be fun with the right people.
---
I had this probem like a day ago, just left the client running for a hour or two out of frustration. and it worked
---
Then make sure to get on good terms with the pilot  so that they will tell you their sites and sell an in cyno for a  group to come kill that super.  That would be the true Eve way.
---
CCP Peligro is the guy who hates russians, good luck OP
---
Eve wide war !!!
---
bahahhaahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahah
---
oh wait you're serious. let me laugh even harder
---
BAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
You should make another ticket and ask if I can have your stuff
---
&gt;how does one learn PVP solo if either the hunters are multi-boxing and working on overkill or others run or are not fit for pvp? 
---
I ran into a similar problem. I think, unfortunately, it's just a matter of mass - keep looking and you will find PVP encounters. Also, while not strictly solo, fleeting up with a small gang can improve the number of targets you can take on.
---
They gave you a 3 day and took ISK, you decide just to change sites and wonder why you were banned?
---
Have prices gone down so much? I used to get 200 to 250 an hour off exploration in venal.  Granted that was like 4 years ago
---
I can't imagine why FRT lost, almost as if Legacy blued everybody else.
---
Yes, defensive plexing happens that way. Roll cheap, null losses when that pvper that is not even FW comes looking for solo deplexers. They always roll with builds costing much of a bill, so.. meh, roll cheap and accept your losses.
---
Some PVPers may get salty at the cheesing, but rolling expensive does not pay unless you have a big ship to haul several classes around for different size plexes.
---
You must have missed out on the Ventures deplexing era. Funny stuff when you see one running from you in a large and then your laughing stops when a non-FW nestor jumps you in full t2 guns, ammo, mods and gear;  Just shrug and join the venture bro.
---
bro 😎💪
---
You got released because your way of playing EVE was abusive, you get clear notification but at the end of your ban you continue to do the same shit in cosmos... And you come crying here. Do you wait for compassion? The 24/24 cosmos ratters are noxious, your ban is well deserved.
---
Are you sure you're not a Russian botter?
---
I don't trust my alts to help out either man. Bunch of moochers living off the iskies my main makes.
---
My problem is I no longer know which is my main 🤷‍♂️
---
&gt;While this activity does not necessitate the use of a 3rd party program in order to carry it out you ARE generating income in an automated fashion while sleeping which is not being present playing the game.   As such our automated systems will continue to detect and institute administrative actions for this activity. We do not find this to be acceptable gameplay.
---
While this is true, I would prefer the automated system spawning in a squad of triglavians instead.
---
CCP aren't based on the US, the BBB can't touch them.
---
No idea myself, was on comms when we heard these lads where on their way down the pipe (I think around the time they where in Q-U or EX6?).
---
PS: Hi Abi, hope your well. 7o &lt;3
---
How are they being uncooperative? They literally tell him who to contact, he is refusing to do so. He was told why he was banned the first time, then proceeded to not change his behavior and then wonder why he got banned again.
---
Also, the BBB is a joke, it has zero power and no one cares what they think.
---
