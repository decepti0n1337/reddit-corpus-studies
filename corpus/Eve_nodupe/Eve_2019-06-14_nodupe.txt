Who is the goonswarm and why are people voting for them?
---
---
---
This sucks. I was hoping it was fake.
---
Remember when these Pamfam posters were out here clamoring for changes when Goons and TEST were getting evicted? I don't.
---
Go ahead and biomass the characters pls thx
---
I hope CCP will finally wake up ... but honestly i think not.
---
Will do my best on the off chance that I get elected.
---
ok thanks
---
12% because I had the biggest feet

i was the stork and i was neuted we killed 2 of your bombs and just tanked the rest.  and i was on the phone so the backups had things covered lol. was a fun day

Because, despite a buff, they are still bad.

Well, I have unlimited faith in the free market. Capitalism = git gud or get got.

&gt;20:03 NCPL JACKDAWS/SCIMI/MUNINNS LANDING ON GRID
---
just based on one small fact i'm gonna go ahead and doubt your entire timeline (sorry bud)
---
[this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77270883/) was the in-cyno for your carrier fleet, and if you look *really* carefully you might notice that it was the ncpl muninns who killed it
---
we were on grid before any of your fleets showed up, and we watched you all warp in
---
maybe, i dunno... pay attention to what's actually happening in a fight next time you wanna write an aar thread about it?
---
Who in their sane mind (eve online? Sane? Lmao) would vote for the scamking of gofundme?
---
r/eveporn
---
Eve is not about what you can be taught, Eve is about learning. If you are willing to learn, you can find required information even without corporation, if you are not, then an entire alliance wouldn’t be able to help you.
---
Aside from that, i’d honestly recommend you to join exactly a big newbro-oriented corporation, such as Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. The thing is, it is a great illusion that middle or small corporations provide you with more opportunities to prove yourself. Each corporation gives you these opportunities, that’s why they are recruiting after all. To take these chances or to ignore them is entirely up to you.
---
However, big newbro-oriented alliances are more preferable because guys like you are their bread and butter. They have entire infrastructure dedicated to working with newbies and letting them prove themselves. For example, in Horde you can literally start to lead fleets at any second: all you have to do is to have a clear objective in mind and to ping in discord. Plus, big alliances simply provide you with better services that have higher-quality, such as buyback programs, shipping, guides and free ships for beginners.

Kill blues duh

How dare ye

Thanks Capqu :)

Even better, they paid for our new ihub.

Hey hey. You always CAN become someone. Anywhere, not just only EVE. You just need to try hard and do your job. Do your stuff, perfect it, communicate with peopke and you will be known, in game or irl - doesn’t matter. Just be yourself and have no fear of anything!
---
um excuse me what the fuck
---
Well, since I still have not gotten a response from CCP I am guessing that I will be getting no confirmations on anything and the ban is final.
---
It has been a joy flying with you all.
---
o7
---
Yeah, run a dedicated server and have sone fun...But judging that even ig browser got purged to liberate manhours it’s not gonna happen.
---
Yea figured it was only a matter of time.  Hope folks are seeing what is happening because we as Eve players are causing it.  F
---
I wouldnt be surprised if goons didnt need other but their own votes
---
It s so hard to undock.
---
God pamfam was only there 30 mins?
---
u/dwarfedUPK
---
Are we gonna have a week of "Why you shouldn't vote for X" memes?
---
kinda hard to pay attention when you're triple boxing in a fleet in 10 fps per char. i kept looking at the main tab to see what was going on. overview wasnt big enough to fit everyone in it, and the only reds on grid made it look like horde. 
---
but i guess since i messed up one small part of it, ill take down the AAR and act like the fight never happened. NCPL were the only ones there and TEST never showed up thus blueballing panfam and making them go all the way up north to whatever home they have left.
---
sorry bud :(
---
Yes, vote the Imperium #6 candidate as #1. That will teach them!
---
The article I was reading is apparently from Jan of 2018 and I live in provi so don't have to roam around, but Serpentis = Drone Transceivers and Guristas = Enhanced Ward Console.  
---
But again, massive grain of salt as I don't actually go outside of sansha space for relic sites.
---
Yes people will just stay in high sec.   the best spod in the game is also available out of 0.5 moons.
---
After literally everyone who’s most likely to vote has already voted.
---
As a neut go to brave / tapi / goon / ph space and you have so much content in 10 min. Too hard peraps.
---
Voting with your wallet doesn't work any more. CCP is shifting their attention to getting more money from newer players and at this point I think they'd be happier seeing more vets leave the game.
---
They might give lip service now and then but that's really all it is. They know care bears are where it's at in terms of numbers of subscriptions.
---
Man, I was in Hooligans under Manny when you guys first came out and started barbecuing shit left and right. We got smoked, but it was insanely fun and seeing Krechet’s Revenant was a Gold Star among the new beans. I’ve always had this hope that you were just building a fleet to go take on the Imperium, but I guess disbanding works too lol. 
---
In all seriousness best to all of you guys, and I hope some of the vets do stick around and continue to Club Seals till the cluster goes down. o7
---
Yeet
---
A) this.  
---
B) legacy cap escalation won that fight
---
1. When you need 2k on grid for the 800 WINCO/PANFAM fleet....
---
2. Call them pussies in local for not fighting....  
---
3. Bathphone Goons cuz 1500K vs 800 is not enough  
---
4. call them pussies again for backing up from the blob  
---
.....no wonder why Skill u says the game is dead...you gotta blob everything to be able to win now....
---
I thought of it as soon as I posted, but oh well.
---
I really hope they do something to make subcaps more viable. Right now: why travel 5 jumps with a cruiser fleet with you can cyno in dreads instantly. Why fight a war when all you will get is more of the same quality of space that you hold now and spend a week killing every single structure to take it
---
You cant blame the players. Period.
---
This is sad :(
---
your are an retard
---
RIP if you like to PvP
---
GOTG FC's could have really benefited from some (more) schooling from SkillU.
---
Because it'd take longer than the actual war. Have you seen the tank on those things with ADC?
---
Maybe just pass on the message in the morning; 'Oh BTW Hilmar, the largest Sov holding alliance in the game just disbanded saying that the game's shit, and they biomassed.'
---
None of these groups form fleets that can be engaged aka where a fight is possible and not a one-sided deal.
---
GREAT JOB YOU KILLED A HAW REV
---
&gt;As can be seen from the ping Mittani, they do not care to make the game better. **They just want to piss people off because they have lost**, and continue the war against all who are not in the Imperium.
---
???
---
&gt;They so desperately want to control the CSM and **by proxy the game.**
---
?????
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
eh, i have been Test for my whole time in null.  so is that better or worse than joining test only once they are on the upswing?
---
Don't vote for any null bloc dicks. Problem solved!
---
if you’re not flairbaiting, I’d hazard a guess in saying that being in test is the reason they’re not deploying to your area
---
How many groups have shield super fleets?
---
blame the blue donut created by goons and test
---
I think you posted this in the wrong place?  I actually appreciate what you brought to the conversation above.
---
Why can't I get more US time zone strat ops?
---
lol qq more instead of crying and quitting maybe you shudve gotten more friends
---
Cant stop, wont stop
---
Hockey died for me the year the Red Wings missed the playoffs.
---
Basically, the fights are bigger and slower and rarer, most of the pvp these day's revolves around how can build titans the fastest.
---
&gt;So what actually happened? 
---
Injectors, bots, dying game, the usual.
---
As if you need a reddit threat to know why you shouldn't vote for shart dragon
---
fuck snuff
---
We are, is CCP culpable? Yes, but we are the ones who form these groups to a point were it is blob fests.   We are the ones who make deals for mutual benefits.  Could CCP balance some things to help I think so, but it is up to us to change or it's just going to keep drifting toward Serenity.
---
Believe it or not, this post actually gave me a little perspective.  Thanks
---
Not that I'm a fan of snuff, but every alliance in the game with super superiority does this. It's the smart thing to do. You've already won the fight, so you bring in your big toys for clean up, your members get to use their toys / stay subbed and active and happy. You also take less losses because you're cleaning up the field faster. Every alliance with supers/titans in the game has done this at some point. It's dumb not to.
---
play a better game
---
&gt; I'm all for democracy, but you're retarded ~~if you think the CSM controls the game~~
---
Used to be 750 people in Amarr, now its down to half that.
---
Where do get these?
---
How do we vote  Merkelchen  in as the next voice of Aura?
---
Me too.  So we're invading.
---
I haven't seen anyone else doing them
---
People contemplating a vote for Sort should instead follow the standard Imperium how to vote.
---
Why support the wannabe when you can vote for the real thing?
---
I mean, without their allies to prop them up, FRT generally just feeds hilariously.  Losing a significant ally doesn't bode well for FRT's continued ~~botting~~ krabbing.
---
I think content is good, evicting your only local content because oh no invasion is silly. But Test blued Mango so...
---
Think the term you were looking for was "Seppukuing"
---
learned a lot simply by flying against them for a while. the game will be worse without large, aggressive pvp groups like skill u
---
1. They only have 100km range and Supers/Caps and Titans are still effective 100km+ away, you can't stop a cyno travel ares/malediction from just warping to tackled cap at -100km and lighting even with perfect grid/system and gate control. 
---
2. 1 minute spool up timer, +time before tackle means that only the most unattentive capitals get caught without being able to light a cyno. The only thing it does do is give the enemy cap FC a 10 minute timer to respond if he wants to go directly on grid, With Ansiblex and travel Malediction/Ares you can easily burn a 2nd cyno in time before 1st cyno goes down anyway. 
---
3. Cyno Inhibs have 0% resists and only 10k Armor and Shield. Even with Infinite logistics solo ratting supers can kill it through reps (assuming 1 tank type). Not to mention that it's often dropped by forward tackle like Dictor/Interceptor. A Ratting super can kill an Inhib in under 1 minute (before it can even online) with 3x LR heavy fighters and 2x SR fighters. 180,000 HP vs 6,000 DPS (assuming it still has missile abilities in SR fighters) = 30s to kill cyno inhib in typical ratting Hel/Nyx fits if you don't already have mainline on the field. 
---
4. 50 million ISK a pop, for largely ineffective deployable to counter common place every day 1.5 million ISK module on a ship, the travel malediction or ares with cyno that will come if it successfully online and blocks a cyno still costs less than it.
---
I mean, them trying hilariously attempting to evict TEST on their own was fun.  When they started trying to get 3/4 of EVE to join them to do the heavy lifting, then its just insulting and they need to go.
---
In before people realize that Goons don't bot because we prefer to use child labor.
---
This is part of the "Eve:Tabletop" game from last year.
---
So it looks like you can see them on the solar system map even if you can not dock at them. Is this true in WH as well? Im really just wondering if there is any way to have somewhat stealth Citadel.
---
EVE University is what you are looking for.
---
So he's leading our next Alliance Tournament team?
---
If by dying you mean holding more sov than any other entity, being one of the most active PvP alliances per person in the game and deploying to get fights anywhere and everywhere then yeah you are probably right. 
---
Or then again you are probably just retarded.
---
Tapi is full of degenerates.
---
let's take the best case scenario Hilmar goes we need to fix this shit, I don't think CCP is able to do like they lost all the people with the skills to do so a long time ago. 
---
More then likely the look at the income skillu provided and realized they where a relatively minor source of revenue, now if GSF and test both go guy's unsub your accounts where gonna force CCP to change we might get something, but both of those groups benefit from the current meta so are unlikely to do so.
---
It's sad, Dodixie used to be my home for all things trading. Now it's basically a ghost town and is often missing random essential modules.

Deepfake

Thanks for your answer. I have an idea, 
---
what if rorquals and ratting supers couldn’t fit cynos. This would make it easier to Gank them and wouldn’t hurt small groups as they would probably have backup in or near the system.
---
i tried to adapt more friends but then some of them were the girl kind!!!!1111!!
---
Resolved
---
yeah good point well made bud, i'm gonna go take a good long hard look in my golden rmt mirror
---
There's an app for that!
---
Not trying to get flair baited here, but isn't there an NC renter allianced \*named\* B0T? :thinking:
---
Goons will win until the game dies completely. It is known.
---
the truth hurts?
---
thinnk the term you were looking for was "internet online dot com", dingus
---
horde eu
---
That's exactly what happened, kinda.
---
Just want to emphasize a few things based on my experience looking for a good corp experience as a relative newbie. I've also been looking for a mid-size (100-250?) corp, and after trying a few I didn't like, I finally found one that fit well. The interview is a two-way process, so be sure to ask questions to check that they're what you're looking for.
---
* The Corp/Alliance should be active *in your time zone*. This was really important for me because a few corps were in other TZs and I never saw them. If the recruiter says "we have people from all over the world", that might means there's only one or two in your TZ.
---
* Nullsec can have a lot of meta rules, ones that restrict your gameplay to krabby things you don't want (e.g., you can do these sites, not those sigs, and if our friend wants to use the space then you fuck off). Not always the case, but after I moved there I found that I was all the time jumping into WHs to get out. The question "what can't I do in your space" might help figure this out.
---
* The Corp/Alliance should have some people who do mentoring. Probably you're not looking for classes, but finding out "how does a newbie become a productive member of your corp" would help.
---
Good luck, I hope you have fun!
---
But empires are wicked. Just got my 2nd rorqual and I only started this year!
---
Why?
---
fwiw:  
---
**Defibrillator: A Three Part Plan for Eve Online**  
---
Goals:
---
* Rein in structure power so immediate content is easier to create.
---
* Make Upwell structures a source of content for a variety of playstyles.
---
* Decrease the time required to create significant timers or content that ‘matters’.
---
* Create a healthier ecosystem through increased risk and scarcity.
---
* All changes require little-to-no ‘new’ development, just tweaks to existing code.
---
**1.** Upwell 3.0:
---
* Reinforcement timers reduced; 2 for high power, and single (kill) timer for low-power, across all upwell structures in lowsec and nullsec. Hisec should retain an armor timer 24h after the initial reinforcement, and otherwise function identically.
---
* Defender chooses the timezone of the exit, but the day is determined by the attacker. The specific timer is determined by the time of attack; if within the timezone window then the timers will be at that exact time. If the initial reinforcement takes place outside that window, the final timer will be at the limit of the exit window closest to the time the initial attack took place.
---
* The distance between the initial reinforcement and the final timer will depend on the structure size. 1 day for FLEX structures, 2 days for medium structures (same as POSs), 4 days for large structures, and 5 days for XL structures.
---
* Damage cap increased so that all timers take a maximum of 15 minutes at cap (same as the repair timer, equivalent to 3 siege cycles).
---
* Standup armor plates removed from the game.
---
* Upwell structures will only be able to use their weapons once in armor on the initial reinforcement, and during the final timer.
---
* Entosis of station/citadel services to return as a mechanic.
---
* Introduction of a less profitable passive rig for refineries.
---
* Jump fatigue added back to jump gates.
---
**2.** Aegis 3.0:
---
* Advantages conferred by ADMs to be reduced: an ihub at ADM 6 should take 30 minutes to reinforce uninterrupted. The minimum time should remain the same.
---
* Attacker determines the exact timer within the vuln window as with upwell structures.
---
* TCU functionality rolled into the ihub and the structure removed from the game.
---
* Continued nerfs to the respawn time and number of anoms provided by ihub upgrades.
---
**3.** Umbrella mechanics:
---
* Buff resists and range of cyno inhibs - should be survivable and affect the entire grid.
---
* Give Black ops battleships a small SMB similar to the Nestor.
---
* Do NOT nerf the loki; if anything buff the other 3 T3Cs.
---
* More, stronger tackle in anoms - e.g. infinite point ‘hic’ towers etc.
---
* Remove automatic drone aggro.
---
but whatever they'll probably do some retarded shit instead
---
Good luck, and I hope you have fun now that you've won EVE. I'll miss arguing with you.
---
....you know, this is bait and switch, i  saw "tabletop nyx" as title and thought it was an actual tabletop that was a nyx, oh well
---
Maybe because citadels didn’t exist then?
---
Am ready to skill some rats
---
Yes Horde the huge industrial machine that can field more Titans than a lot of people can field subs.
---
Now you play with 20k robots in your alliance))
---
I have an adversary? Neato!
---
I hear Dota2 is good for content.
---
Most the problems I think are based around current citadel mechanics, I feel like going on the offensive feels incredibly unfun due to a variety of reasons and this is what I would want.   
---
Remove the ability to anchor FLEX structures on the same grid as a Keepstar. Fortizar should be the max allowed structure, Keepstar Doomsday just means you can never effectively camp enemy Ansiblex in small roaming gangs or reinforce them for content for fights in bigger sized fleets. Cyno Jammers on the same grid as the Keepstar allows alliances to become too entrenched. Fighting under a Fortizar gives the defenders a good advantage but one that can be overcome.   
---
Prevent players from activating an Ansiblex gate while pointed. (The same conditions as being prevented from docking while on a citadel).  
---
Remove the Hull timer for all structures entirely from nullsec space. So low power structures are just killed off in the first attack, and you only have 1 reinforcement timer \~24 hours after the first attack. 5+ day reinforcement timers with 3 reinforcement cycles allows too easily for batphones, is a massive chore for the attackers and contributes to the stagnant blue donut, it's also not fun at all grinding away at off-tanked structures that are timed to come out on wednesdays at downtime. This brings back the weekend as major days of conflict and promotes people living in their space and structures.
---
I doubt it would be a scam. Just people dodging the 1-2% sales tax and double checking the numbers before they accept. In my ideal world.
---
ISKWAR: WON ☑
---
OBJECTIVE: WON ☑
---
KEEPSTAR: DESTROYED ☑
---
TRAPPED: ☐ This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their fort before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
People that relied on old advantages like early adopter isk and early account SP, have had all those advantages eroded out from under them.
---
They find themselves on a level playing field now, but with less players than their enemies due to cultural and social choices.  Now that they see the writing on the wall, instead of choosing to remain and be underdogs, they are all quitting.
---
The war in the north is just the messenger bringing tidings of impotence to the 'elite pvp' crews of eve.
---
you could make the game several magnitudes better just by tweaking the existing code. like it's actually not that hard to do, the problem is that ccp has favoured a different vision for the game over the last 3 years. they have to abandon that shitty vision, the coding is the easy bit.
---
Now make it float and you can sell the concept to CCP for $2000
---
Interesting
---
If your biggest achievement is holding space no one wanted anymore, I am not sure what to say.
---
The timezone tank is a solid point, and I applaud you for only pointing to that instead of other straw-men.
---
If CCP changed citadels to highly mirror POS mechanics (Auto Guns, 1 timer if Fueled, maybe some other minor tweaks), would that be enough to 'fix' eve?
---
Why anyone would vote for that mongoloid is well beyond me, only his brainwashed underlings would vote for him.
---
Beeo Boop bot responding, we bots don't take to kindly that you're placing us on the same level as shit dragon.
---
Aoe anticapital bombs would still be op. 
---
Heavy bombers with xl torpedoes + focused damage bombs is the most viable suggestion
---
No it's not
---
No I was.
---
There is pretty much no reason to fight over space right now other than content. 1-2 regions can sustain even the biggest alliances. All the recent wars (after UALX) were just content wars or goons slapping their dicks around
---
Evenews24 should follow suit tbh
---
Right after quafe zero and shield slaves
---
Barra RMTing ? Say it ain't so!
---
As someone who lives "in" Sansha space, I don't really either. Angel space sucks.
---
The last time I got fights off a reaver deployment I was in a bigger blob than test lol.
---
Right this minute I assume they are just too busy razing the fuck out of panfam's renters, but after that? I don't see any reason they couldn't come fuck with test. I know a lot of corp gangs and skirmish fleets would give em good fights. We cba to drop supers unless you tackle something big lol.
---
Lolwat
---
Wow I see myself
---
Which is exactly why I didn't give you your way.
---
Damn. My meme game is weak this day.
---
So far, every time I’ve wanted to buy a new frigate, I have had to fly to the station I’m buying it from in my pod to pick it up. This feels incredibly stressful! I mean come on, I literally couldn’t be more exposed! How can I move ships faster and safer? Can I use a freighter to move “packaged” ships? What about using a shuttle to get there, repackaging the shuttle and carrying the shuttle home in the new ship?
---
it's weird that you say vote for Xenuria because you talk exactly like him almost as if you're actually him making this post on an alt account
---
pretty sure this guy knows exactly who Xenuria is - since he talks exactly like Xenuria, and is probably Xenuria posting on an alt account.
---
All the other mechanics in the game mean jack shit without the combat.
---
You take away spaceships blowing up and there's no game.
---
Sometimes you gotta roll the hard Nyx...

Triglavian Commander: _peeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwww... \*takes breath* ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww_
---
first of all, either you can't read or you're deliberately misrepresenting what i said
---
secondly, i don't think anyone has a problem with the citadel UI, or even the fact that they have to be gunned. the problem is that making timers at all, and especially against groups in other TZs, is so incredibly grindy now. a citadel takes almost 90 minutes over the course of 9 days to kill even if uncontested. an ADM 6 ihub takes AN HOUR to reinforce and a minimum of 90 minutes to kill if uncontested. meanwhile, the financial incentives to pvp as a group have been removed from the game.
---
goons are currently steamrolling the north, and they have to do it at autz o'clock on a weekday. weaponised boredom has been a thing forever, but ccp has provided even bigger, more boring weapons. the mechanics of pvp are simply not fun, and EVERYONE agrees on this.

---
Novac tag? :thonking:
---
it's not about code I agree it's about the mechanical design I feel like CCP lacks people with well game design skills, to the point where I feel like they lack the ability to predict the results of changes in the game and there for the "vision" lacks the implementation skill.
---
Shut up and look at the changelogs. I fucking hate supercaps and current sov mechanics as they apply to the pig shit that is "coalitions" too. But it's pretty obvious they are doing their best.

For some reason, a bunch of people have the misinformed opinion that ejecting from a strat cruiser won't prevent the skill loss. Some people even go as far as to say "Yes, even **if you eject in a pos, leave it there for a year**, forget to refuel and someone pops it, **you will lose the SP** :P"
---
* [Example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5g3y22/eli5_t3_cruisers_and_skill_loss/)
---
* [Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4szysa/does_ejecting_from_a_t3_save_your_skillpoints/)
---
* [Example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2serzz/agression_ejecting_from_ship_looking_for_info/)
---
This is not the case, and I made a short video to demonstrate that. If you're not in the ship, you won't lose SP. The only caveat I'll add is that ejecting isn't possible while you have a weapons timer, so for most practical purposes this can't be used to avoid SP loss in PVP (in fact, this was something that was specifically changed several years back, because it was being abused).
---
Horde and Brave are engageable, if you're not bad. Boson titans at every gate? Not so much

&gt; I’ve been doing some thinking (already terrifying I know) about massive super blob counterplay. 
---
The counterplay is simple ... get your own super blob. Are u willing to do that effort?
---
Never seen anyone offer a small group space in null. 
---
I have only seen them try to rent it.

Make sure to take out the  **Restoration Nodes** and  **Virus Suppressor** as soon as one pops up. If you have both on the board at the same time, may as well just exit the window and try again. Make sure to make use of those utility tools.

For some reason, a bunch of people have the misinformed opinion that ejecting from a strat cruiser won't prevent the skill loss. Some people even go as far as to say "Yes, even \*\*if you eject in a pos, leave it there for a year\*\*, forget to refuel and someone pops it, \*\*you will lose the SP\*\* :P"

those comments work better in a thread that isn't about you disbanding.

better watch it amerilard rumor has it skillu has a direct line to Russian Cyber Ultranationals I'd hate to see another election.....hacked.

That's how they said it. It doesn't matter what the developer says, cause the DBA says "no."

We don't care what you think, Aryth has already won anyway.

I feel like you dropped a word or a punctuation somewhere in here.

I would hope the snapchats I send you don’t hurt :(

Unironally Xenuria is better on the CSM than the judge.

Man, its really sad to see you guys go. Have fun in your future endeavors!
---
Your salt is delicious!
---
Fun video! Music choice was also nice to listen to. Well done :)
---
Accurate.
---
I may be a dying breed but I run missions out of Penirgman, 2j from Amarr. There's a decent sized crowd of us that are pretty tight and chat.  Haven't noticed anything like what you're saying about the markets though. Local is certainly slower than it was in 2010 but that's not news to anybody.
---
Wait, so only once skillu decides to close its doors does Test decide to move supercaps to the warzone? Not sure that is something to brag about.
---
&gt;alliance
---
Gross.
---
Hell if I know. He logged in for a combat op and even got a kill, so...
---
This whole post is designed to push out market competition. As a local, I've not noticed any significant decline in the market. Just fewer folks in local
---
CCP pretty much ignore all the criticism (even when justified) when people predicted how things would play out, and then left the game in a shit heap for years before making any changes (most recently sov, citadels, etc).
---
CCP don't want your solutions.
---
So he's as qualified as any of us.
---
So say we all.
---
What happened to Barbie?
---
Not if both sides make their own stuff, fly in it and die in it.  That will not help or hurt the economy.
---
It's a psy-op campaign so he can take over the Amarr markets!

Was about to reply the same, but luckily found someone else with a brain.

I think you have a really good chance, you got my 6 votes.

HTP's original playstyle is dead 🙁

I’d bet all my Gobloons on Mittens
---
good that alliance is shit kick the trash and get back to being a great corp + broski toxic coalition
---
What is resource wars?
---
sweetie, tri was larger/same size as us, and they had 2k+ red alliance to fight with them at the start.  
---
We deployed to fight voltron, but I guess in your mind we, as a 1200 character alliance, should've gone against 35k legacy, 15k frat in a totally different TZ, or nc. being 4 times our size and probably having help from the rest of panfam.  
---
I also suggest you do some research on our battle reports and try to come up with an alliance with a better track record.  
---
You are probably right about the not being remembered, after all the average eve retard takes his coolaid straight from their bloc news and it's clueless about what happens outside of it.
---
He posted it before you...

Buy soe scanner probes, they are worth it. Warp core stabs hurt your lock time significantly, you'll be better off if you swap them for inertia stabs so that you can warp off quickly. Also, fit an improved cloak in your high slots if you can and learn the mwd-cloak trick. And keep spamming that d-scan key all the time if there's a neut in local or you're in J-space.
---
Iirc, 3x wcs will evade a 3 point faction scram. No point going for 4 wcs.
---
Test really gutted their member base, they are a shadow of their former selves.
---
Come now, my human mage will burn you all
---
2 Competent, 3 technically.
---
Because gobbins will absolutely shred mittens. Also, why eagles for solo pvp?
---
Also a pringles can. It provides structural support for your poopsock.
---
It depends on their mood like when you undock 20 cruisers for me 2 frigs and a destroyer you're not being engageable, other day's especially horde will play around yes and form something reasonable.
---
Yep, you're right.
---
yea.  TRI was the same size as you at that point.  ok.   and you basically blued up everybody including panfam and NcDot.  but ok.  nice try there.  but sure, good fight!  you'll will be remembered as being the second dick after XIX to beat down TRI.  
---
And again, you have a decent track record because your opponents were XIX, DRF, and TRI.  whoopie freaking do.  your accomplishments are running a bot infested rental alliance and doing jack shit all with the proceeds while running away from any decent fight.  Congrats!

Jove Commander?
---
Actually makes me wonder, if the pilot ejects and another pilot capable jumps into the ship, does the SP loss go to the new pilot or the old one? I figure people could do this as a ransom or something to save skill-points.
---
Could 1 nyx solo a group of 3 carriers and 1 dread?
---
He's due to vanish anyway
---
Oh I don't mean to imply that it is.  Just that I'd thought you were mocking it.
---
Absolutely. But if the carriers use their grams, like non-retards would, the Nyx wont be killing anything and will die hilariously.
---
Hi NC

it takes a lot of skills points but a tech II prober , helios , and all the meds to boost sig strength and pinpointing. refit with depot for relic when u need to run them.
---
BR?
---
When Goons were evicted from Deklein? 
---
They must have been ninja fucking citadels.
---
Even when you're cloak equipped. I never see CovOp traps in null. Meanwhile if I'm uncloaked for more than 10 seconds in a C2 you can bet that 4 HICs will suddenly show up on d-scan.
---
For wormholes, anything but a bomber is going to have a recalibration delay of 5+ seconds from decloak to starting lock. It's in that window that you need to make your escape. The fractions of a second difference for lock times for a typical explorer hunter after that recalibration is significantly less relevant. Thus, maximizing agility and minimizing stacking penalties seems like a better approach in that case.  
---
For lowsec gate camps, any competent camp will have instalockers, but... alcohol, so that raises the value of IStabs agility, since you're not trying to beat their lock time, but their human reflexes and hoping to get a lucky server tick.
---
For nullsec gate camps, you'll be bubbled, so without a cloak to cloak/MWD, you're just going to die.  
---
I've not done the math, but my experience as hunted and hunter seem to indicate a balance of Nanos and Istabs are the best option,  unless you can fit enough buffer to survive a single smartbomb or torpedo salvo, in which case the DC and WCS may be worth it.  
---
Honestly, I'd just fit cheap, dump loot frequently, and plan to die, rather than try to build an exploration ship that can run away, then be frustrated when you die anyway. Your ship's paid for in one or two sites anyway, and getting blown up and having a laugh about it is a great way to meet people, and often get an SRP donation.
---
Yes
---
But wont the nyx just rip through the carries before they can do anything?
---
Sad to see you guys go.  I hope not everyone is quitting EVE.  Best of luck wherever you end up.

Use shuttle and leave it there or resell it.

What one of the CSMs said on the subject is that CCP wasn't willing to disallow cyno's while in panic on rorquals so unable to fit a cyno isn't gonna happen.
---
And it's the same answer irl. Is it legal irl? Unfortunately. Is it ethical? *Still hell the fuck no.*
---
Ah I swear there is a good pun somewhere... Just couldn't find it

Most people would say 42 or 420 depending on their understanding towards the game

But I would say 69
---
dont go to space belonging to one of the largest alliances in the game with 3 dudes and cry about being blobbed..... reeeeeeeeeee
---
AFAIK the ship's ownership will change when the new pilot jumps in, so the SP loss will go to the new guy.
---
Man this game is getting soft.
---
One of the best isk/hour options is relic sites in null/wh space. And many of the same skills you would train for that come in handy in cloaky hunting in wh space, which is what we do.
---
Astero, it's made me a lot of money, and it's cheap, quick, and versatile.
---
Thats the dumbest shit I’ve ever read. Let me fix this,
---
People are annoyed for investing years in a game grind their way to the top. Just to be water down because millennials.
---
Eve supports 1 style of gameplay, thanks to broken voting and a large portion of the CSM is used to meta game eve. Content in every other space “except null” was killed off.
---
was that you waving in our public channel earlier?  
---
A fairly innocuous way to make money as a solo/small group is the method of doing PI / Skill farming.   OFC, I am terrible at explaining this, but there are tons of guides to make it fairly straightforward.  
---
There are other opportunities directly related to PVE including Incursions and other variations of the like (the new Triglavian invasion things are still fairly $ because people still need the materials to make the ships.)  
---
PVP wise you can always make that $ going after explorers and the like as well.   You need to hack vicariously through other pilots. (this genuinely can be a fairly big money sink as well, especially if you are just starting out and don't have the ability to replace things you lose while engaging in said behavior)
---
Either way - enjoy yourself out there and look forward to seeing your application for WiNGSPAN

the nyx can't do shit if the 3 carriers defang the nyx first

and 3 carriers can do that to a nyx very fast

So wait, snuff had to drop 20 tits cause their dreads were dying, but shoot first lost their dignity? 🤔

there are many dinos in this thread right now.

hello pandas :D

&gt;I keep thinking Provi is at the pinnacle of shitty coalitions
---
And yet for years you've lived in adjacent lowsec precisely because that shitty coalition is there...  
---
Basically you're one of those fish that spends their lives on the bottom of the little pond, and eats the leftovers the little fish drop from above?
---
That tends to happen when you drop 20 titans and DD everyfuckingthing
---
Yeah, it's a very nice ship, especially if you plan on doing some of the harder combat sites. My issue with it is that it is as slow and agile as a turtle.
---
Naw, bots would have a bigger super fleet.
---
Used to be Blackbird, because I'm still growing out of the newbro phase and associated cheap ewar, and I have fond memories of battles in it.  With the prevalence of Trig ships, I'm increasingly using an Ashimmu to fit in, or an Arbitrator to counter.
---
In practice however, if I hear there's a fight on, I just grab a Confessor.  It's cheap, fast, low mass, tanky, and hits hard.  Not the best at any of those, of course, but it's a good compromise between all of them.
---
Drifter Commander?

Fast and good turret tracking hey

Tristan, looks cool as hell and had a solid punch

Did you really just try to use that unironically as an insult in 2019?
---
Do you fit EWAR on your confessor as well? Since you seem to like it
---
That thing is OP!
---
Hurricane.  its just my ideal vision of a ship
---
Why does TEST still think they are the little guy? As someone that was in legacy, this was the most confusing spin of all. there are three major blocs in this game. Legacy, Imperium, and PanFam. Legacy and Imperium are bluetral to the point of being basically Imperial Legacy. Panfam can align to a bunch of smaller group entities and winterco, but legacy has f.i.r.e as well. it's really hard for winter to get 3/4 of eve to evict TEST when TEST has 2/3 of Eve backing them. There comes a time to ask yourself "have I become the bad guy". ESPECIALLY after blueing Mango who is the same entity that killed serenity. At least PL never aligned itself with server killing entities.
---
Sorry, but I have to disagree. The proliferation of capitals and super capitals have made them extremely oppressive. You're talking about focused bombs that would have very little AOE. That's no better than picking them off one at a time like they do now. It would have little to no effect on large groups. Especially given the amount of time to set up a single bombing run. I just don't see how having to set up 5-20 bombing runs (depending on tank) to take out capitals is so oppressive, especially given that they can easily extract considering the bombs would clear dictor bubbles. Maybe the damage could be dialed down a little to take some more runs, but that's still no easy feat to coordinate effectively as is.
---
Versatile and high damage, sounds good! How do you fit it?
---
If its a proper active fit, it can permatank a nyx pretty easy. A buffer fit will die eventually of course but if the dread has back-up, they can defang or force you off while you're grinding it down. 
---
The proper ship for solo'ing a dread or fax is a titan really.
---
if the carriers are buffer fit it can take a while
---
Lol well I can't think for you dude.. If ur looking for small gang fights u need to hunt small prey. You don't go after an aircraft carrier with your Somali pirate skiff and cry when u get an active response from people willing to chase u down. 
---
I feel wormholes or faction warfare or NPC 0.0 would be best for you sir.
---
Fav to fly is assault launcher tengu high dps and actually takes some piloting. And it does everything.. Relic, data combats.. Everything.
---
Fav that I never fly is Raven cuz its just a sweet ship the only battleship baring Amarr that actually looks like a battleship lol.
---
How many subcaps?  
---
Cause I remember needing two fleets for the primary doctrine, plus a fleet for all the people that couldn't fly those ships.
---
what a shocker CCP makes the elitist PVP style of play obsolete, hordes of veterans who enjoyed that play style quit the game. First PL, now Skill Urself... hell NC has been on a recruiting binge even recruiting trash corps by most people's standards, and are now going to "focus on a Goon model" for industry &amp; operating the alliance.
---
fuck you CCP thanks for krabifying eve
---
unfortunately some fucking retard, who is so out of touch that he thinks talking about mining in a venture in highsec during eve vegas is "connecting" with the playerbase, is head of CCP
---
i thought quitting is winning, so doesn't that mean that they'll be the biggest losers of us all?
---
I have literally had empty, unhacked cans :(
---
Are you recruiting for the new mobile game too?
---
Tengu with mobile depot is probably the closest to an all in one ship!
---
Have you tried the caldari navy Raven? It is surprisingly good with torpedoes!
---
The issue is generally not just getting its setup time.
---
My experience is NPC null don't bother as literally nobody lives there ( if you want to run pirate missions in a battleship it's great but well not for fights, like literally take a roller autopilot it truth NPC null and you realize how dead it really is. ). 
---
Wormhole space is well interesting but generally like setup time for fights is a drag plus the nature of wormhole fights make most a rather arranged thing, my biggest gripe here is the amount of work that goes into getting fights. 
---
FW, like feels too much like a shell of its former self and fights just, don't present themselves at anywhere the rate they use to. 
---
The point also never was really it's impossible to find fights it's about how much of a pain in the ass it is to find fights these day's and how just go to X space isn't a real solution and often doesn't work.
---
Algos and Incursus are solid all-round brawlers. Once you get under a battleship's guns, they're pretty much dead.

I'm quite fond of my gila cor clearing combat sites. It's a tank little SOB. For just puttering around exploring I've found my astero 5o be rather enjoyable, though I'm hoping to swap up to a stratios soon. Anyone got a solid fit or basis of one that's not pvp focused they would be willing to share
---
Caracal/Cerb. Cheap yet effective. Load HAMs for big stuff and RLMLs for small stuff.
---
I don't think that is true at all. When I joined Horde back in 2015, I used to scout and there was another player who had joined about the same time doing the same. I wouldn't say we were friends, but we often flew together. Whilst I moved countries and thus timezones (a bit of a distraction), he is now a full director of Horde having - one assumes - made himself very useful. There are also a number of players from that time who became FCs or NBI, and then important decision makers higher up the chain. There's a chap from the same time who is now one of the founts of knowledge for the miners.
---
I'm sure this applies to the other big new player alliances too. If you want to be more involved, get more involved - be useful, be helpful, be approachable and social. Just as much as smaller corps, large alliances must need a lot of dedicated people to replace those who leave or step down - be one of those go-to guys if that's what you would like to do.
---
Everyone wanted the small guy to get and hold sov. Everyone wanted ready access to supers and titans instead of having to go though the 1+ year of training a dedicated character, and saving of ISK. Well, despite all the warnings and people getting branded as anti-new player elitist bitter vets, got all that. So here we are.
---
Enjoy your day-old injected titan pilots flying titans made en masse thanks to citadels and endless rorq mining everyone facilitated by multi-region mega-coalitions. I really don't want to hear about any more fixes to anything. The game is broken af.

It won't be about who quote on quote "won". Its how alliances will be remembered. When people look back at B-r and and that time french star got attack, goonswarm will be remembered as the guys that bought more and bitched out. PL/NC. will be remembered as the side that loss but always showed up. The real content creators. Alliances like Bastion and other pets will be forgotten. Hopefully skillurself will be remembered as the guys that bought down an old Russian giant. Time will tell.

Well the ISK wouldn't be as available to do all of that if it weren't for the huge swathes of farmland in Null thanks to those mega coalitions. There's also the disproportionate representation on the CSM by the mega coalitions, which is the player body used to lobby for game changes. So I think we're back to blaming the mega coalitions and the people who support them, which is ironic really because they're the ones complaining..

some changed their playstyle, some kept the old system - now we see who leads the pack

The problem isnt gettign the space. The problem is the cost and effort of taking and holding undefended space.

The Raptor had the most hp with an exploration fit. Was nice. Moved on now to other ships.

Really sorry to hear this. You're one of the groups I've never flown with but been really impressed by.

Goons are FBI in disguised.
---
&gt; Damage cap increased so that all timers take a maximum of 15 minutes at cap (same as the repair timer, equivalent to 3 siege cycles).
---
&gt; Standup armor plates removed from the game.
---
Given how problematic and messy module removal/reimbursement always was, what do you think about - instead of straight up deleting all standup armor plates - keep their EHP increase, but instead define damage cap and minimum dps treshold as percentage of total layer EHP? That way plates stay in the game, still provide some value, don't really matter for uncontested timers and don't make the grind/bash longer assuming you've got sufficient DPS (damage cap is so easy to hit even quadrupling it from current values wouldn't really change much outside maybe XL upwells).
---
Man you are one toxic motherfucker. I really wish fuck wits like yourself would just fuck off and quietly leave and play some other game.  So fucking what, you didn't like it, no one cares.

Many gamestyles  have been made useless by CCP,  these are commonly accepted facts. You don't have to be salty/get all defensive about it.

in an armor fit it wouldnt even be close to killing it, 2-4 dda fits can   kill pretty much any dread unless they are blinged, in which case even two 4 dda nyxes don't suffice
---
When I first started playing in 2007 I joined a corp that I thought was full of nice people but ended up being a bunch of dicks. They wanted me to contract over my stuff to them so that they can help me move to null sec. I declined as I am a naturally suspicious person and they proceeded to kick me from the corp and then gank me every time I logged in to play. This lasted a few weeks and I was told the harassment would stop if I sent them a payment on paypal. I refused again and decided to stop playing for a few months. When I came back a few months later I created a new character and played solo for about 4 years before even thinking about joining a corp again. In hind sight I should have reported them to CCP but I was young at the time
---
I'm sure crap like that still happens more often than we would like to think.
---
You are correct, the game will update the "owner" of the ship instantly when a new pilot boards it.
---
Those are the high profile ones, behind the scenes we've lost tons of smaller groups. In fact as those smaller groups were dying off many people who didn't quit the game moved to skill-u as a last ditch effort to "adapt" to this shit state we're in (ie drop supers on things), now that's dead too.
---
On the plus side there soon won't be any PVP players left, then CCP can focus on whatever they think makes EVE great in 2019.
---
Not a lot of reason to eject this days tbh, with injectors you can just buy your SP back and be instantly on the level you were before you died.
---
It used to be a lot more meaningful since it pretty much meant you wouldn't be able to use a new tech3 (to its maximum potential) until you trained that skill back, now it just gets calculated into your Isk loss, not a big deal.
---
Scimitars are simply the best ;P
---
Fits don't vary so much.
---
The point isn't and wasn't to form the biggest blue donuts forever, but to have content. The point isn't also to have just one style of gameplay so overpowering vs everything else, that it's waste of time doing anything else. Not everyone wants to play in a certain way.
---
Your line 'bohoo' you didn't blue up everything that moved, no, we didn't want to. We could, but then we'd still be here, it'd still be shit.
---
Lack of foresight? Are you dumber than a rock? Did you not see what happened in Serenity?

Congrats I guess that the only people left who know who you are laughing about it.

It used to be the case, there was outcry and they changed it. But for a while it was the default to expect a pod on overview when shooting a t3

Vexor. So many ways to fly it.

Mmmh Daredevil!

Uhm it's legacy and imperium that are 3/4.
---
This is another one of those 'we gunna get evicted'
---
You see it spits in the face of their constant underdog "the world is against us" narrative. That's why TEST needs to constantly give excuses and reasons for blobbing out their enemies because even in a **DEFENSIVE WAR** they (Legacy) "could lose their space"
---
Hey maybe it's not a smart idea to give supers **all** of the following properties at once:
---
* Tens of millions of EHP
---
* With capital reps from FAXs
---
* Practically full ewar immunity
---
* Boosh immunity
---
* Inherent warp core strength bonuses
---
* Easy placement onto any grid within 6ly
---
* A one-fit-does-everything archetype
---
Maybe when something is clearly overpowered compared to everything else in the game the best option is just to nerf that thing, regardless of how many people bought themselves into the overpowered thing. I'd start by removing ewar immunity to open up counterplay options that don't involve dropping 1.5x as many supers as the other guys did.
---
Beautiful. I can’t stand being zoomed in during PvP though, it’s the Eve equivalent of being blind.
---
ZEALOT VERY SLOW MUCH KITED SO BAD
---
I’ve been seeing a ton of newbro posts on the subreddit as well. So many, “is the game still worth getting into?” Posts everywhere. Posts like that are annoying, but I welcome the new blood. Keeps the game running.
---
more sp farm alts. that is all.
---
Triple MAX CTA obviously didn't work. Time for the Quadruple Max CTA™.

Nice! Also fuck you for killing my first Kikimora! &lt;3

i don't understand how you can so blasé about just not being aware of what's going on while purporting yourself to be an accurate reporter in this thread

Skill farming isn't great right now, as the best profits come from buying MCTs, game time, and extractors from sales. It also either takes several months to set up, or requires a lot of investment. It is however a great option to subsidize an account if you don't want to pay cash for it as after extraction you only need around 200 mil from other sources to buy enough plex to stay omega.   
---
Exploration is generally a good place to start as you can both make isk and hunt other players simultaneously, and can be done with something as cheep as a battle heron. Abyssal sites are also good, as a low skill passive gila can run T3/T4 sites and make 100-150mil an hour. If you want to invest, you can push that as high as 300mil an hour running T5 dark sites (though you are looking at 1-2bil for a ship to do so). Another option that several of our agents engage in is patch market speculation. Although it dose require a decent amount of game knowledge and a decent starting fund, it requires little effort to maintain in the long run.
---
You're assume CCP has the ability/desire to make the changes that are necessary. At this point I think the game is reliant on the turbo-krabs exploiting the shitty mechanics CCP introduced. If you change the mechanics you bleed the krab subs propping up the active player count and watch the game fail cascade because its only f2p characters and people who are still trapped by the sunk cost from years of playing that didn't feel alienated enough already to let their subs lapse.
---
I'm in Orlando!

Probably changed because of the way blowing up citadels in wh goes like.

You'd be able to anchor a raitaru

transfer 10 t3c to your victim

blow raitaru and the t3c up

victim loses 10 levels in t3c

this.

my biggest barrier right now is that on a weekday if i'm able to play, it's for about 2-3hrs max. so if there's nothing to do almost instantly when logging in, i won't join a fleet because i know it won't be finished in time.

Pirate faction modules/ammo exist purely to sap ISK from credit card warriors.
---
Yeah I'm Ginger Nolen, that was me waving! lol. Thanks for the tips. I have heard that y'all require a solo kill in J-Space before you can join so im trying to get one before I apply. I have a friend already in WiNGSPAN that does abyssal sites, so I think I might try that with him and do some PI on the side.
---
The D-Scan mashing PTSD and RSI on the other hand ...

I meant trying to get people to/from Amarr for ISKy gains 😉

Until there is a real chance of Goons being completely wiped off the map, I think it is just a series of squabbles. Wars seem to imply dire consequences.

Bravo!

&gt; Skill's illustrious leader Barra was referred to by many members as 'farmer', or :tractor: / :ear_of_rice: in discord-speak. This always made me smile. Farming is one of the most honorable and respectable professions a man can have, and to hear our glorious space-leader was such a man in real life gave me pause whenever I thought of leaving. However, like all things in skill urself, it was not as it seemed. I eventually found out from a corp-mate that 'farmer' is also a term used by BDSM people to describe a certain type of individual (the details of which I will not repeat). My alliance leader wasn't a farmer, he was a sex pervert!
---
&gt; That was more than I could stomach. I dropped corp right then and there, and haven't looked back since. To those of you out there reading this cautionary tale, please don't make the same mistake I did. Whatever you do, stay away from this group at all costs.

Blueing everything that moved and creating a literally unfightable blob - that's how you took tribute. Thereby setting this whole thing in motion. Blueing everything that moved and creating a literally unfightable blob - that's how you won WWB, thereby setting the tribute thing in motion. "B-but we unblued though!" I hear you cry through semen-crusted lips. Semantics, brother. The band was always ready to get back together the moment NC needed more botting space, like the world's shittiest Avengers knock off.

 There are no clean hands in this plague pit of a sandbox and to argue otherwise betrays a startling lack of understanding of how the game ended up at this point. To act like you're on the side of the plucky underdog is just plain fucking funny dude .

Faction hardeners only take 16tf of cpu vs the 36 of the T2 hardener. That gives you a reason to consider using them. I seriously doubt that's what happened here. But that doesn't make them worthless in and of themselves.

1-2 times a year Imperium goes to war for the reason of "content for line members". The years since fozsov/citadels has slowed down our want or need to go to war. It is usually just sig or squad deployments to give people content. Propaganda game aside its really only for something to do.

Quite a few people also just trained to level 4 because losing and retraining level 5 seemed like such a waste of time when you could be training other skills.

The only reason you should not vote for Goon candidates (or from the other big groups)  is that they will be elected anyway, no matter what you do.

So you your votes are better spent on other candidates. If you look at how the CSM works, you should pick the ones that seem to understand how the game works and can deliver the message to CCP.

No, the didn't.

There's plenty of room in there for you Farm &lt;3

I'm glad I have your blessing to be appreciated, you still need greater variety in your insults.

Idunno about the others but dreddit has a mentors program for just this situation, so you can have someone help you one on one to learn the game.

Their best isn't good enough then.

i always have two scrams on my explorer hunting astero and if i spot a magnate one of them is usually faction because they fit 4 stabs.

---
It's not that they're worthless, it's that their cost isn't justified IMO unless fit to a super because the tangible benefit provided to them over other modules isn't that high. While you might win a fight with T2s that you would lose with T1/Meta, I don't see very many people winning fights with pirate faction modules that they wouldn't have won without them, save for a few edge cases.

Of course there's only one fit: hull tanked, dual web and blasters.

---
Sup man how you doing :)
---
These days I've really been having fun with a couple of T2 small ships - the Wolf and the Magus.
---
The Wolf is what I use for a personal guilty pleasure of mine - flying a fast, tanky 'escort' frigate on NPSI fleets and basically just buzzing around fights trying to pick off opposing tackle/ewar/etc. It's not really contributing to the fleet nearly as much as if I were flying a 'proper' support ship like an inty, dictor, etc, but being tackle is still *some*thing, and I find it a very stimulating and fun piloting challenge to try to catch and kill opposing small ships without getting murdered by the main enemy fleet or my counterparts on the other side. I use the Wolf for this because it is, in my opinion, the best blend of tank, speed, and firepower in a frigate sized platform. In particular, the small base sig and high base speed combined with the MWD bloom bonus and ADCU means you don't (usually!) get casually wiped off the field before you can warp out if the opposing fleet targets you, unlike many/most destroyer platforms. [I run it in an active AC fit](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76757430/), as might be expected, with a bit of a bias towards speed and a nos in the spare high just to make my secondary role of heavy tackle a bit easier, and it's just so much *fun* to fly.
---
The Magus is what I've been using lately in small gangs. The Algos hull has always been a personal favorite of mine ever since I used one to complete the SoE epic arc way back when I started playing, and the Magus is basically that on crack with a MJD. Fast, slippery, gives boosts, tackles stuff, booshes fools around, and just a pleasure to fly. I won't claim to be that *good* at it, and I'm sure I'm doing all sorts of things wrong with my fit and piloting, but I'm having a lot of fun with it regardless. [Right now I'm running a dualrep dual link version](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76441694/), as I just can't quite make myself fly something quite so paper tanked as the super-kity versions I've seen some people use. (Also I like being able to act as hard tackle on occasion, as the gangs I fly with usually don't have anything like that.)
---
Yet here you are posting.  I thought nobody cares?  Are you a nobody?  Dont be so hard on yourself friend
---
You sure weren't complaining when it was panfam doing the stompping with the biggest super fleet in the game lmao.
---
The Brutix is such a wonderful meshing of form and function - it looks like a brick, tanks like a brick, and beats people's faces in like a brick. \^\^
---
Or just make them like fighters. No automatic controls there.

pretty sure most of skill u would rather kill themselves than join fedup

Uh those are worth like 4m each lol. I put them on my prospects.

Scaling. Can't multibox 10 carriers to rat, shouldn't be able to multibox 10 Rorqs. Requiring the brainlet to click excavators modules fighter-style to mine means said brainlet can no longer stroke its dick while simultaneously acquiring minerals with 10 Rorqs.

the content of bashing citadels is dubious, it's about the revenge for old time players and accomplishment of wiping the map.

How do you fit them? I love the look and allure of utility but cant come up with a strong fjt

There you go little buddy

What you wanna request is smaller ore rocks as well, so rorq would need to switch targets more often. That’s actually the problem of multiboxing carrier ratting.

Winterco knew what they were getting into, remember last summer??? But this time its in their space. Save them ELO

Amarr Militia, be a hero!

People have been mad about eve as long as it's been around. If you're new something to learn is that 80% of people who post here, especially the ones who makes posts like this, they don't play eve. They stopped years ago but need something to be mad about.

Play it, see if you like it. If you don't, don't play. If you do, keep playing.

Thats not even a meme fit anymore, it's a ridiculous brawler

Anyone remember how the war last summer ended??? But this time in winterco space

So where is the elite shit talk from capqu when skillu was evicting TRI from Insmother? I guess it drained. Besides of evicting them having greater numbers you have nothing to show for yourself, and let's not forget, you grow big in the shadow of TRI which you choose to backstab to show your muscles. Great riddance of such amazing leaders but I hope your pilots will find a suitable home now. Who knows, maybe they'll fight alongside TRI again. That would be a twist for sure. :D
---
That's the part I think is stupid, I shouldn't have to pay extra just to move a cap once in a while.
---
... Imperial Legacy... it even has an officially sactioned and propagandised name. That is hardly unknown or backroom.

Either you're living under a very large rock or you're being disingenuous.

hahaha very nice!
---
Just make a super rorq with three flights of excavation fighters and two support tubes. No dmg figs
---
Whats with the glow? Is the fort next to a sun?
---
I rat in my carrier, I have no idea how someone could multibox that.  I'm not talking about a super that blaps everything in sight.
---
TESTES LOVE A GOOD BEATING, JUST ASK ELO

You have to manually reengage them after every return.

Nice !

I agree on that, but that basically sounds like multiboxing hulks.

Now I almost want one!

You so nice!

I would trade my zoom in function, to be able to zoom far out and turn ships into primitive pyramid objects with mono-colour textures.

I joined skill urself 3 months ago, after in my first 3 years in eve often getting assraped by them, IG. I invested 500 euro's in injectors just to get more lvl 5 skills to avoid getting memed for low dmg on kills.

Even while 2019 wasnt their prime year, I learned a lot and had more fun than any other place ive been.

So thanks barra, capqu, highgloss and everyone else Ive flown with o7
---
Dont they already have that? Its called npc null
---
I've been playing this game for 10 years, I know how it works.
---
You can still tell how likely it is for the other side to form. A fort in the middle of nowhere? Low chance of fight.
---
Their forward staging citadel, their really important jump bridge or one of their keepstars? High chance of fight.
---
Of course you'll be wrong from time to time, but Is rather miss a couple of fights than spend hours bashing undefended structures.

do you tho

Its currently reinforced again.

Caldari ships are just cool.

Merlin huh, I fly kestrel mostly, why do you like Merlin?

Arty Cyclone because it had amazing gang tank and spank, that pushed your skills with flying and timing your active modules.

The wolf is probably what I would fly if I had Minmatar skills!

What is the point of this picture? I don't get it.

I had the same idea when the initially reworked the rorqual. Would have loved to set the orbit of each drone by hand. Would have helped against bombs, booshers etc.

Every time I went to warp in a cane, [I would hear this](https://youtu.be/6IgaDHRiujA).
---
I was just thinking if they worked like fighters, when full they would just stop in space like a fighter after Target dies.
---
When recalled to tubes, instead of refueling, it would say emptying cargo, or something on those lines.
---
Then launch them and repeat.
---
Made sense in my head, and should make the process more interactive.

Oh boy,

For Style Points:Jackdaw. Its a purely beautiful ship, prolly the most beautiful.
---
For Memes:Combat Procurer. you dont know how many frigates/destroyers think they can take out a Procurer solo, just to find out it has 30-50k EHP
---
For Solo PvP: Curse. No one sees you on Dscan, and you can nuet out almost anthing. whats not to like?
---
Fleet PvP has me split. the Gila is amazing. 600+ DPS in a Cruiser that can still frag frigates is amazing.

Our old Tengu fleets were fun as well

But I can still see the fortizar this isn't a real super fleet yet

Really sad news. Saw you guys doing incredibly things. Watched your enemies flee in fear when you entered grid. Always had respect for who you guys are and what kind of game you stand for, be it with you or against you. 
---
You always were wildcards but the things you did put me in awe. The game is not gonna be the same without you guys.

yes they can tether at an Astrahus, Fortizars are more preferable as the tether sphere is much larger so safer to safe log on.

If Volta can do it then I'm sure skillu could aswell but problem is they just don't want to, would rather bitch and complain that it's everyone else's problem how they have went stale and blue'd everyone around them so they could sit comfy.

I'm prepared for downvotes, let it begin!

No it means a certain type of fight/content. If it's not for you then do something else. If you don't want to do something else then you apparently disband your alliance/corps/toons and then complain about it.
---
The key issue when selecting a ship to pvp with solo in lowsec is not "Can I win most fights with this?" but more "Will anyone fight me in this?" 
---
Tristan, Catalyst, Vexor will get you more fights than a Magus or Hecate. And you will probably perform better. 
---
As those who willingly engage your Magus or Hecate obviously think they have good odds.

Fuck me CCP when are you going to wake up and actually grab the balls like Hilmar said he would.  But we've heard so much BS from Hilmar in the past it's pointless.

Good luck...

The problem with "interactive" is that it's often just a synonym of "tedious" and "dull" and "boring".

I'm all for removing ago components of the game,  as long as we aren't replacing it with tedium. The fact that most mechanics are afkable are their only saving grace in most cases.

No, NCPL never led the movement of WWB, they came in when there was momentum, you have to remember that, of course they were significant players and took the lead once they were all in, and CFC literally even at that time was a huge force that required people coming together. 
---
MBC was then disbanded once the war was over. Not like today, where #2 sucks up to #1, we've actually never had that scenario in a long while or ever. That's the crux of it really. 
---
Are we the underdogs? Yes, it has nothing to do with being funny or you being salty, it's simple maths, arithmetics, you know, the function of 'addition'. Over here, they teach us that in pre-kindergarten.
---
Drekavac because T R I G M A S T E R R A C E

vexor, nice tank and dps in pvp and okey for low lvl pve
---
Just introduce new bombs like Focused Shrapnel bombs, Focused Electron bombs, etc with 10x the damage and a much smaller area of effect.
---
Providence, the way this game is meant to be played
---
Its not my fault, that everyone is too rich and need to use worms and those other things. There are so many nice normal frigs, but they are rarly used, and that i hate.
---
Nice
---
Sad to hear. It was great seeing skill u wrecking shit in the drone lands.
---
Yeah like mining, hauling, industry.0 you know, some stuff that is hard to pull off and wait no it's not.
---
i see you stupid enough to compare this 2 ally
---
Watching that cyno inhib disappear so fast makes me wonder if CCP should add a 15minutes reinforcement timer to them.
---
More please.
---
Wasn't it part of the game mechanics and license agreement?
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
AAR:  Provi bloc in a fit of madness decided to try and take some sov in providence from it's rightful owners. The provi fc chose not to engage our rattle fleet for the duration of the TCU toasting fight so we baited them into an engagement by letting them toast/kill all the nodes over the course of several hours (they aren't good at this, don't judge them) and then dropped our own replacement TCU to encourage a fixed grid fight.
---
Provi did us the honor of finally fighting and losing chunk of their mach fleet, and then the logistics of a reshipped cerb fleet and again another token mach after the reshipped once again into battleships.
---
Anyway timer won, and kept the nasty provi pirates at bay for another day.
---
Frankly, there should be a limit on how many fitted caps and supers you can dock in one citadel (excluding a keepstar).
---
Its not a myth, it's a bug that was a thing for quite a while and has come back a few times.
---
This is sound life advice. Have an upvote.
---
Though to be fair that was always going to be slow as they had to get players to actually use the damn things. But yeah, change is needed.   
---
EVE Final headline will be "EVE players finally succeed in destroying their own game"
---
evictions are good for content.
---
also don't evict me bro.
---
I love being on structure bashes when multiple Triglavian ships are involved.  
---
*FUCK THAT ONE SPOT IN PARTICULAR!*
---
People are always leaving. Like if you started the game at 15 you'd be over 30 now. With kids around you are less likely to be able to justify spending entire evenings or more just to grind some structures.
---
What code would be so easy to change? Just talking ship balance or similar? Because i mean, from what i can gather touching the code can fuck up all sorts of weird stuff in unexpected ways. Had a reply from a dev here a few months back about one weird bug caused by something else. Was interesting to hear but just would make anyone scared to poke to code too much. Not that the playerbase is forgiving of mistakes.
---
Quality troll post
---
well ... he's not wrong
---
I would prefer if you could only jump to certain points in a solar system, without the need for a cyno.
---
With the possibility of being able to probe down additional jump points, that  are only available for a limited amount of time/jumps.
---
 [http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Jump\_Point](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Jump_Point) &lt;-- basically this
---
Nope. You're probably right. I will make wormhole space introduction an soft skills my next content release. Stay tuned.
---
TBH the only real thing wrong has been the mass titan and super production and the fact that goons have now basically just "won" EVE and are unstoppable.   
---
Watching BjornBee there seems to be lots of fun PVP to still do even solo.

---
The bit about weapon range hit home; thanks. I will work on it.
---
Thats because Pyke starts as "manageable to oh shit hes feed" once hes lvl6
---
You know, I have carriers, t3d's, dreads, cruisers, battleships and so on. However, my favorite ship is an ORE ship. It is my most profitable ship so far an had paid itself off multiple times. If you ask me, you can't really go overboard spending ISK on it. Especially in nullsec. With its slot layout it has a very low ceiling what you can make out of it.

I was flying the ship nearly every time to our public fleets in Blackrise and haven't lost it in 2-3 Years (other Pontis but not the "Shiny" one) in the end it was nearly completely Deadspace/faction fitted and costed around 800-900m 
---
I had some pretty cool fights with this ship, my Fav where, when I take the fire from like 12-15 RLML NOsperys and dropped to like 10%

Yeah! Perhaps the same can be said for missile application on transversial targets :)
---
Eve has been dying since 2003
---
Make a new character to go through the tutorial to get basic mechanics down but use the old characters that you’ve already invested time into at least somewhat training.
---
Check out the in game channel “Abyssal Lurkers” for a bunch of saved fits in the MOTD as well as links to a spreadsheet and workbench with many different ships/fits all geared towards different weathered T5 sites. Also ask any questions you have - there are some knowledgeable people in there!
---
Don't make rorq mining an interactive activity. People who farm or hunt excavators would run out of business. We need more afk rorqs. 
---
What you actually want to change is the super umbrella guarding the rorqs in various regions. Why can't cyno inhibs be more like command bursts with links pilots spending cyno inhib charges?
---
I don't know how to feel about this. Can you please provide me some insight?  I have an interest in Knowing the direction of where new players should and shouldn't go.
---
I feel like them being in a bill Corp is fine so long as the Corp environment is good, like I feel mine is. Thanks.
---
Don't let the bittervets get you down. I've been having loads of fun playing this game, and my account's only a year old.
---
Looks like a dragon to me.
---
Cynos aren’t the problem. People who think cynos are the problem, are the problem. You probably didn’t play eve back when a super fleet could move across the entire galaxy in less than an hour...maybe less than 30 mins.
---
Having mobile cynos is also important for black ops gangs, and jump freighters. Which might not mean shit to you...seemingly because you forgot to mention them in your post, but they exist.
---
Sorry you couldn’t get your hands on the fortress of delve first, but that’s your own fault.
---
Completly depends on the fits. Between litterally instantly, 3 minutes and not at all.
---
Yes you can still play. Probably pa will keep it afloat till they milk the mobile eve game cash cow.
---
please don't take this personal. i only downvoted you so your reply will be burried deep in the reddit comment tombs...
---
i hope they never bring that abomination back (afaik they did with last years christmas """GIFT""")
---
i mean lot of people saw that coming including people in such alliances as PL and skill, and were saying so here on reddit. 
---
Problem is that some people don't want to play the new play style (ie the goon way) so they tried  to go on as long as they could playing the way they wanted. 
---
I am in same spot. I don't want big empire game play (hell my best time was in lowsec), I am currently exploring WH gameplay. But if the choice is between playing like goons (or any of their imitators) or not playing eve, I'll probably stop as well.
---
for some it did die frebruary 9 2016, do I dare to say for many
---
skill injectors probably filled CCP pockets alot, but at what cost
---
Only a couple playstyles are dying. If you find fun doing other things then you will still be able to play this game for years to come
---
That's the kind of cool stories I like to hear!
---
This
---
Weak bait
---
Eve ain't dying, people complain when they can't/don't want to adapt to the new meta
---
It died from skill extractors.
---
A very good ship to fly around the new trig invasion areas!
---
Have fun mining in highsec on virtually empty server. :D
---
Goons, Test and trium or I'm mistaken?
---
Such is the nature of all things. Nothing lasts forever and everything must die.
---
I'm not jumping unto the whole "Eve is dying bandwagon" but "adapting to the meta" when the meta is boring is not something I want to do.
---
Can confirm..started playing back in 2009, "everyone" was saying I'm stupid investing into a dead game...
---
Went on a hiatus, returned in 2015: the game is still dying. Went on a another brake. Returned two.weeks ago and... Guess what! It's still dying;)
---
Old char if anything. New chars are only good for pumping injectors into them until they become useful
---
I guess?
---
"Are you having fun playing the game ?" is the only question you should ask yourself to know if you should keep playing the game.

No EVE isn't dying, there are definitely play styles that are ebbing out of existence though.
---

You can afford to lose three well fit nyxs for the price of one well fit titan these days mein.
---
says the guy from a corp that has systematically farmed every new group out of existence for years, way to keep the narrative going.
---
&gt; and spend a week killing every single structure 
---
oh boi you alread need a week to kill a SINGLE structure. you need months to kill all and only if the opponent doesn't continue spamming. you can't out-kill citadel spam
---
I also was living in the drone lands at that time. I would not say we got "liberated".
---
What bugs me the most is that most of the people who wanted to fight have now left the drone lands, but the krabs basically just pay rent to someone else and have another sign on the front door.
---
I returned to my old alliance in highsec and continue to watch nullsec from here, having no real interest of ever moving back there.
---
That being said, while fighting skillu never was fun, it is sad to see them go. They should have stayed the elite PVP group that pushed us out and should have just gone for the next target.
---
sad but true :( isnt OW dying as well?

:regd02:

Dude are you fucking retarded?

EVE Online is an MMO that is 16years old, have dedicated and group of players, yet changes made over last years made game boring, grindy and heavily based on the P2W scheme related to injecting skill points.        
---
You could say it is going to happen sooner or later but CCP, creator of EVE Online was recently acquired by Pearl Abyss for [425 million $](https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/06/ceo-robin-jung-tells-why-pearl-abyss-bought-eve-online-maker/).     
---
Now the group holding the [most space](https://i.imgur.com/Auvt91H.jpg) declared that it will [just disband as there is no point to play eve and started to delete characters](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c0avpg/skill_urself_ingme_is_disbanding/)        
---
This is wake up call not only for CCP, but also for Pearl Abyss.             
---
#Dear Pearl Abyss, your 425,000,000 $ investment have huge chance of not surviving another year!.        
---
Time is running out and issues raised by players for years are ignored.             
---
EVE Online is a niche game and if you lose current players there is no way you can rebuild the player base again.
---
That sounds like a preety decent change. Would be every make moving caps and defending the outer regions a lot harder.
---
Prime example of why abortions should be mandatory in the case of incest.

I hope my corp runs into you so we can blow up your trash fits.

---
It's summer.  Eve is always really dead in summer
---
Blaster Brutix for life! Even the regular version with structure tank is a beast.
---
It's been dying for 15 years already...
---
Stratios is now becomming my favourite... 
---
I have seen delonewolf using it instead of Gila to clean sites (  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-re3FxxeDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-re3FxxeDI)  ), so i tried it too and immediately fallen in love. The main advantage being much faster scanning of sites and ability to snipe small frigates with lasers, so heavy drones do not lose time eith them. :)
---
I've seen those videos too and even he was impressed!
---
Tbh you'll get refamiliar very easily just flying around solo a bit - you don't need to re-do the tutorial for that if you're just refamiliarizing.
---
That said, some elements have changed, like the probing interface has been made a little easier since 2014, and you will notice citadels and will have to get used to how tether mechanics work.
---
I had the exact same problem when I returned to the game last year, took about a week of solo roaming until I was back in the hang of things.
---
Just go to Google images and search spodumain
---
Quite!
---
Yeah thats what I mean sorry, each structure has a week timers. So yeah it's ridiculous
---
I have a regular Brutix, with polarized blaster and almost 40k hull ehp. the DPS is insane  
---
It's my stupidest ship, but it refuse to die.
---
I do lots of new bean fleet, the people that are leaving a "already replaced". The test ihub battle had at least 6 people in ph's fleet that had never even shot a player ship before.
---
Yeah but when someone ejects from a T3C, or any ship for that matter, I stop shooting and collect the ship instead, so no SP loss for you &lt;3
---
True throughout (i am one of those over 30 now people). But that is no real contradiction. The fact remains. Player numbers are going south. Blocs can still field F1 monkeys just fine, but i am honestly just waiting for ccp to reintroduce "npc-made" ressources to seed the markets. Gone are the times one could just hop into doxi or amarr to fit an entire ship just the way you want. It's jita or nothing.
---
Shield tanked, combat prober scram svipul.
---
Not really, the playerbase is just slowly shrinking as is expected for any game after a few years.
---
I mean, there already are ppl that do mine in empty pockets only, not speaking to anyone. Theres dozens of playstyle that I might personally find to be trash, but if someone gets their enjoyment from it, who am I to judge?
---
bots don't have politics, I'd guess 75% of the game is bots now = no0things happened
---
So independant with a NIP with the imperium :D
---
As someone who regularly advises companies who are conducting post acquisition reviews to decide if they want to raid or increase investment, I can probably confidently tell you that Pearl Abyss' board of directors are not monitoring r/gaming as a barometer of how their investment is performing.
---
If you want to give someone advice about how their financial investment is failing, it's generally helpful to exhibit product performance statistics so you can extrapolate something from the data. Just because 5 almost-already-AFK dudes in the leadership of a 1000 character alliance are calling it quits, doesn't mean it's a barometer for the rest of the game.
---
He truly was. And given his experience in this kind of content, his enjoyment totally transferred to me and i had to buy a Stratios right away. Now i am experimenting with it a bit, but mainly i am using his fit and it is a very good ship. 
---
I think it could be very useful in Wormholes too. Rither Strat, or his big brother Nestor.
---
&gt; Plus SASH killed TRI
---
lol
---
To not minge, No, the game isn't dying. Its a sandbox. Its the nature of the sandbox that things change and evolve and honestly? I'm still having fun. Can't talk for the rest of the people, but I don't feel like the populations dropping, and I'm still seeing way more new people then ones I've met before.
---
Said this in a reply in another post but just to maybe give it ore visibility:
---
I know they aren't perfect ideas, but something like a ship that can bridge subcaps only, not allowing caps to go through jump gates, and removing a timer for low power structures would go a long way to increasing conflict in eve. I've also seen it suggested that structure placements should be tied to planets (are already on moon's so maybe non moon bashing structures can only be anchored on planets). Eve needs more conflict. The isk inflation and capital proliferation and structure spam have made the game feel incredibly stagnant.
---
Why take a cruiser gang 5 jumps in response to a roam when you can just instantly cyno in caps. Why do to war when you have nothing to gain but more of the exact same quality of space you already hold and each enemy structure takes a week to kill
---
I see Minos but no any Apostl, so is thet shield Avatars?
---
Yeah, i am the one to speak. I just ran away from goons for them being too massive and demanding on time and socialization. Now i am back in HS doing combat sites and lvl4 missions at my own pace and i am happy again. :DDD
---
I don't read bot, anyone want to tell me what it says?
---
Minmatar Commander: We're dangerously low on duct tape.
---

---
Most likely
---
Why don't you just not play the invasion content?
---
For normal people living in the dronelands there were two problems:
---
krabing not possible because 24/7 camped and zero protection from own corp/alliance -&gt; no krabing -&gt; no isk/mins -&gt; no isk/mins for pvp ships.
---
But the leadership did not care for this. As long as you pay your taxes and still show up to push F1 it was all ok. But even the guys that had enough isk to continue to pvp were fucking annoyed by the huge failures made by DCU/DRF FCs which was the second big problem - getting dunked day after day and then beeing told "war will be won next week", yeah fuck you Pandoro. Personally I don't blame anyone who left and I stayed until the last moment and saw our corp keepstars die, then I realized this has all happened because nobody gave a shit about us as long as we pay and we would be better of somewhere where people protect their systems and their members.

Agency is an ad.

Can you recommend any good botting programs? I feel like I'm missing out on the true eve experience by only playing when I'm physically present.

There is a video around of a guy tanking sleepers in a stratios. Maybe it's even delonewolf again.
---
I mean the article is OK.
---
So is my colon but ye.
---
Oversized propulsion modules also ruin your agility, making you warp very late if aligned wrong. I don't think that's a good idea as long as it's not a very specialized fit and you really know what you are doing.
---
The answer to life the universe and everything.
---
Say what now? It's a thing? Even in Citadels?
---
I went down chain duoing with a Corp mate and he had talked all night about his hull tanked brutix navy. I thought it was a joke until he almos solod a hull tanked mega while I was killing tackle and dps on him
---
That thing looks so weird when deployed!
---
Just fit large guns and an obscene amount of heat sinks. Do 800 dps out to 70k easy
---

---
What makes you think The Judge wasnt a goon double agent planted in CO2 years ago just in case gigx went completely insane?
---
Pyke is indeed an evil bastard to go against. Every time I see him I get an ahh fuck feeling.
---
I think so. The beginning of the end is only beginning
---
I had some Russians rolling their hole and I MJDd their mega off. He instantly ejects and warps to their now crit hole. Got content and about 200m from them
---
how fast depends on your fit, their fit. best case you two F3 their ass and kill them soon after with F1's. Worst case? You start rage pinging because the dread is tanking your ass so well he hardly needs to touch his repper, you are neuted out, you got sensor damped to hell from a new bro in a maulus, you are defanged, dread is sub 100m on your ass with heavy webs inside a t2 large bubble. 
---
You just gave a 4 man group with little in the ways of firepower their first super kill because you thought supers were strong in solo capital vs capital fights and that ratting dread looked like a tasty kill. You died to a 1x Phoenix, 1x flycatcher, 1x newbro maulus, and 1x bhaalgorn. Hey at least you might get some reddit gold.
---
Of course, when you´re on the same grid you see everything on the overview. What I meant was that you only see Structes systemwide on the overview when you have docking rights, as it´s the case with most Hi-Sec Structures
---
Mostly done without peak but you can take the credit if it makes you feel warm inside
---
No no no, most definitively, over 9000
---
I assuming the structure is still there in there, you will still be in the structure. Your belonging will still be in the structure you could rejoin the corp and then move everything out, or just message someone higher up in the corp and see if you can get led out. I had this had this happen to and alt of mine thankfully I was still in the corp on my main so I just contracted all my stuff to my main. Then undocked and told my corp mates to fight my thasher alt lol.
---
Err...  or you mean lack thereof? Missiles don't have any relation to transversal velocity, only velocity.
---
That said though, I agree I should cover the topic. Problem is, the only worthwhile work I could do is explain the science behind missiles, but I'm not very well versed on it :/ I could hypothesize, but that's it. and I'm not great at looking at mathematical formulas.
---
I have to disagree with that.
---
When I joined Dreddit, I had the complete opposite experience of what you described.
---
Of course it's a massive corp and many people just choose to not participate in corp activities. And that's fine, Dreddit is kind of the default corp for TEST so we accept people who only really care about massive fleets and stuff.
---
But the actual corp community in Dreddit is actually quite small. You absolutely *can* "become someone". When I joined, I was quickly "adopted" by a mentor, encouraged to join the smaller corp roams and pretty quickly got integrated into the smaller core group of Dreddit members. 
---
I kind of stopped flying with them after a while, because the timezone I played in shifted, but it was as much of a community experience as the smaller corps I was in.
---
Instead I decided to spend most of my time with a smaller SIG in TEST. And guess what? That's also a smaller community where you actually get to make friends and be an individual instead of "line member 28934".
---
I guess what I'm saying is, I have tried many different playstyles. I've lived in lowsec, I've lived in NPC null, I've lived in wormhole space for a *long* time. But I have to say, I've had the best time seeking out these smaller communities within large alliances.
---
It's a "best of both worlds" situation. You get all the benefits of being in a large alliance (on-demand content, infrastructure, etc) paired with all the benefits of being in a small corp (tight community, small gang roams, fun deployments, being valued as an individual).
---
I feel like people who complain about large alliances being too big just never tried actually finding a place to fit in.
---
It'd cost me 2 bill to get a sub skill to 5 again, considering most of my fits are sub 500mill I think I'll stick to ejecting instead of injecting 4 ships into my head every time I lose one
---
Don't get me wrong, I am aware that holding that much space with a PvP force strength of \~Provi was probably what really killed us.
---
If we would have just moved the non-krabs to one region it might have been a different story. There were just too many "dronelords", everyone one of them with their own space including a Keepstar.
---
The XiX/NC renter business aside, I think drones was actually a pretty healthy region, given that there was a lot of smaller groups living in that space that made up the DCU/DRF.
---
Once we started that war with TRI it went downhill pretty fast though.
---
Sorry! I meant as an expectation to be avoiding incoming turret fire. Just a mention that missiles are an exemption(?) to the rule.
---
Was just trying to put myself in the shoes of someone who knows nothing :)

---
jup someone told me when i was just starting my carrer, that if you are DBA or infosec, your most important job is to say no.
---
I dont understand it, is it your first kill and you are proud or something?
---
That's nice, dear.
---
Imagine smugposting about winning with 2:1 numbers including cap support against subcaps
---
This makes a lot of sense. Imagine for example a wormhole structure being blown up, which ejects the ships, and people losing potentially a dozen skill levels because they had stocked up on t3cs before being evicted.
---
My Eve Online spirit animal is the hecate, it looks cool as fuck, punches way above its league, has sub 2sec align time, can probe, brawls like a man or kites like a pussy, depending on the situation, is a gallente ship and GALLENTE MASTERRACE, etc, etc.
---
I didn\`t say "use" your blob but "get" your blob: recruit members, organize them, train them, make them rich, help them get in supers and titans ... do the work to build a community ... that\`s why I asked if u are willing to do that!
---
No offence, but most ppl seems to not understand that there are only two ways to destroy a big organization that fields 1000+ titans: 1) internal friction leading to disband or 2) **oppose a similar size or bigger organization**.
---
Your proposal has the obvious purpose to facilitate **your** play style only: 50 ppl to destroy 200 titans but seems u fail to understand that this will benefit the big organization much more (capable of fielding 30 fleets of 50 bombers) and will broke game (caps will be simply not used anymore ... which will also benefit big org more).
---
l wish people would just leave rorqs as them l am for my self l like mining on 1 or 11 of them and just getting rich some of use just enjoy mining for mining
---
Yep hes a bitch to play against but fun af to play
---
Drop the passive shield mod, insert adaptive, drop the tractor beam, insert dark blood medium nos, remove the shield low, insert power diagnostic system
---
The thing that poses the highest risk are neuts, the nos has kept me alive more often than i can count

---
If you left ang of your characters subbed for longer then you were playing, you might be able to get some additional slillpoints could be a realpy nuce benfit if youre like me and stopped playing and forgot to unsub for a few months. They gave me loke 12milliom sp to allocate.  Dunno if its relevant for you but if it is, submit a ticket qnd have an awesome starter. 
---
No point in restarting either way. Doing ao is just wasted sp.
---
Its sad  i wish you all the best of luck
---
The answer to this changes on a weekly basis for me, but the one I've enjoyed consistently is the Keres. It lets your gang keep their distance, and shuts down key hostile ships out of the fight entirely. 
---
As a side note, I love that there's so many different answers in this thread - almost every ship adds something unique and has its fans. Except for the Caracal navy issue, which is just trash.
---
it was, ccp members who went on sisi was told that rorqual should be fighters to prevent the n+1 issue that WILL and DID happen. this happened immediately after ccp released that the rorqual was getting reworked publicly, and this was mentioned to ccp every time there was even a rumor that a rework was going to happen before they announced it. every time we were told "we'll look into it." 
---
Players did not help matters much either, saying it is a dumb idea because ratting fighters have to change targets often and not often with rocks never mind spending the little time to even fathom a mining mechanic for fighters. Like the gram for example. trust me in this, this idea was talked to death, was brainstormed to death, paper balanced to death, theory crafted to death. Details given to CCP to death. CCP doesn't fucking care.
---
Yes. 
---
Eve is dying since it was in beta. Don't worry.
---
CCP always ties their “expansion” class updates with larger advertising. No surprise that there are more noobs rn. Check past expansion release dates
---
praxis because can fit it four ways
---
Had to refrain from making a mom joke here.
---
Hodor
---
if nyx has shadow fighters thats basically one shooot
---
I think 12yrs of EVE is enough for me. From BoB to SkillU seen so many alliances form and dispand. Quit EVE multiple times myself but I think this is my final time. Sure has been fun. o7
---
simple examples: remove one timer from citadels across the board. make reffing a citadel at cap take 15m instead of 25. make reffing an ADM 6 ihub take 30 minutes instead of 60. defender only chooses the tz, not the day. 
---
those are all just database variables, ccp changed citadel ref mechanics much more drastically last time.
---
if you want to see my own personal hit-list, look here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c0b8xf/comment/er3wu1v
---
Don't feel bad about spending money on something you personally enjoy.   Don't worry about what other people think either.  Leave Sunk Cost to the SC fanboys. 
---
I have played Eve since 2003, on and off.  Doing the same thing over and over gets dull to almost anyone.  That's why people take a break sometimes.  Those vets who quit, notwithstanding changes in lifestyle, will eventually get the desire to log in again.
---
One of the coolest looking out there!
---
F12 &gt; Tab: Tutorial Videos &gt; watch a bit about the things that probably have chanced since you left. Those videos can be found on CCP's youtube channel as well. I think they are called flight academy. 
---
There is also [updates.eveonline.com](https://updates.eveonline.com). It's not going back 5 years, but like 3 or so, I believe. Sums up most things and gives links to dev-posts if you want to know more. Like the citadel stuff for example.
---
The thing about being a "vet" now in Eve is it's meaningless.  It used to be that you could automatically assume a vet had high SP and this was a badge of pride.  Since injectors that has gone and I think something important has been lost with it.  It's more psychology than gameplay.  
---
I'm not 100% sure what I mean.  Just a vague feeling...
---
The current system means a rorqual thats on the ball can get help that would pretty much punish rorquals that arent AFK
---
one can still copy-paste the link...
---
not going to, though. I dislike facebook for too many reasons too much.
---
Really?
---
I've been in goons for like 18 months. Don't think I've ever spoken to more than like 5 people in Corp or alliance, and 1 fleet a month isn't that demanding, you literally get it by accident. 
---
Nobody seems to mind me just bumbling around in delve doing my own thing.
---
It's a Komodo explosion
---
No it don't work this way.
---
Then they'll just put more fortizar and reinforce this cancer of structure bashing
---
How many faxes did you bring?
---
Ahaha poor caracal...
---
Right, got it. Yup, I'll look into it :) I'll need to find a volunteer
---
 "The game isn't fun anymore" then "  we can all play WoW. " lmaoooo
---
I don't know why but whenever someone says something like this, the obvious point is ignored and I can never get it into the heads of complainers why it's important.  
---
This is: the number of Rorqs will go down in proportion to the strength of the umbrella, mostly because Rorq pilots are not robots, or if they are, most of them don't like feeding.  Nerf the umbrella and the number of targets will go down which your first point seems to agree, is not what you want.
---
and get your standing wrecked with that toon so you always have a headache when flying through highsec.

Anything with a large C on the side. Exact hull depends on the situation. Always loved the Merlin and Scorpio.

Thrasher, obviously. It's cheap, and can take on basically everything smaller than a cruiser. Sometimes cruisers too. https://zkillboard.com/kill/76810367/
---
Doubling dread dps in siege while halving their tracking would do something at least, when dead got a buff in 12/13 they kept the super blobs at bat for a time, as dread bombs became a thing. Ofc this should only apply in siege and only when they are shooting XL targets.
---
&gt; Anytime groups leave or dissolve its a loss for the game.
---
Disagree. There's some sizable groups in Fraternity and Goonswarm that the game would be nothing but improved by, if they left.
---
Love the Cerb.  Hazing light tackle in a RLML Cerb from 70km away is my favorite thing in the world.  That, or getting nerds to fight it in a WR wormhole.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Nope, it's not dying. It's already dead.
---
Just make the ability to fit a cyno a role bonus on bombers, t3cs, hics, faxes and super capitals. And I guess corvettes
---
What kind of stuff do you need at Dox and Amarr?
---
unfixable without server reset.
---
EVE has been dying for just over 16 years now.  I recommend enjoying it today because in 16 years someone is gonna make a post again about it possibly dying..,
---
Yeah, perhaps my corp was a bit more engaged than most... :) 
---
It got worse after the war began. I kinda liked flying a fun fleet or two per month with alliance, but after experiencing fullscale TiDi mess a few times and realizing goons really do not need me and i do not need them, it was better to go by myself than letting myself get kicked for lack of involvement. :) Now i am back to HS, solo and enjoying it.
---
T3Cs mostly. Been thrown around some. Several subsystems have been missing for legi and prot. Plus, weirdly, some ammo types for both. Can't recall having seen that ever
---
yes eve is dying, ccp is too stupid to fix their game. dont invest your money in dying game.
---
What? Cap neut plus heavy fighters melt any dread provided you aren't using explo fighters vs shield dreads or something retarded
---
What if because of your super well thought out post, have cause them to panic and just write off their investment and instead use it as a tax break?
---
Have YOU just killed Eve?!
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77272741/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77272741/) Skillu eating their own crabbers?

It was a table top game.

Yeah it's going to be fraternity with whatever remnants of panfam are still alive and whatever remaining of skillu gets widoted into them vs the mega coalition of Tapierium Guardians of the PIBC.
---
I'll bet 10 bil that eve is serenity 2 by winter 2020
---
This is a side effect of advertising all of your minor content patches as "expansions".  You get an influx of players.  Something like 99% of them don't stay, though, by CCP's own metrics.  It's not surprising when you get such flat "expansions".
---
&gt; you can't out-kill citadel spam
---
Which is a *real* fucking problem.  
---
If it's in the game we'll use it, but it's not right.  It needs to either be more difficult or much more expensive to plant structures in hostile sov.
---
This my friends is why I use the google Authenticator linked to phone
---
Idk, police skin with working cop lights sounds pretty badass in my head
---
Oh god yeah, fuck the tidi shitfests
---
I'm so glad they are all during office hours for me. I have an excuse to ignore all the ping spam about it.
---
Are you not enjoying "occupancy sov"?
---
Maybe a special kind of logi ship
---
What are the basic steps to get into building stuff in eve?  Blueprint wise and parts to make stuff. Is it better make stuff in your own/some one else space station?
---
"Ask us about our alliance history"
---
Being able to move massive firepower around with very little effort is a problem imo.  I wouldnt mind blops cynos being left alone though. And maybe a commercial cyno for freighters. Lots of room to develop the idea i guess
---
That sucks really bad, and I hooe you get most of your stuff/SP reimbursed somehow, but I'm missing something here; how did they took your accounts if you had 2FA on them?
---
Not doubting you at all, just want to understand how could I prevent the same from happening to me (not like there's much to steal anyway).
---
6) Sell Skill urself to me. I'll merge it with my groups
---
Your tails of time-zone tanking are just so dull.
---
Also, you're more than welcome to mail me if you'd like a mentor :)
---
Im not trying to bait. Its a genuine thought.
---
Phoebe was one of the best, most content-driving patches of EVE. I still remember seing a graph where you could see how Dread-Brawls in Lowsec were increasing by several 100%
---
Yeah that could be cool. Maybe having to calibrate your jump in some kind of project descovery / probe scanner style minigame
---
New Accounts get 750,000 SP when made with a referral link, and start with about 300,000. So my advice to you would be to make a refferal link with your existing account here  [https://www.eveonline.com/recruit?status](https://www.eveonline.com/recruit?status)  then click on it and make a new account and a new 1mil SP character right off the bat. Send the ISK over from your existing characters to your new one.   
---
If you enjoy the game and end up buying PLEX, subscribe or buy something with money from the secure.eve-online store you'll get some perks on your old account (PLEX, 2x accelerators or a skill extractor depending on which one) which you can also transfer over to your new main.
---
There have been a few times both before and after the invasion where the subcap fleet got too big and had to be split into doctrine and support fleets. Can't ever recall needing two fleets for the main doctrine tho. Splitting the tackle and other support into a separate fleet usually takes care of things.
---
Only times I recall us having three subcap fleets before the war ended was when we were doing our cloaky T3C thing to counter PanFam booshing raven/rokh comps. Having a doctrine + support + cloaky fleets.
---
i love injectors, they helped me get into 3 rorqs so now i can keep them in my hangar and not use after recent nerfs
---
I heard of this nefarious hacker called 4chan, maybe he is involved in this situation.
---
On a serious note; sucks dude, hopefully you get your stuff back. It takes CCP some time to trace all the distributed assets as often ISK has already sold on for RMT, or the assets have been dumped at firesale prices, etc, characters straight up extracted to husks, etc.
---
Keep in touch with your corpies they will be your emotional crutch through this time and will understand what you're going through.
---
Finally, above all else, just be patient. Use this time to do a few other things in your life, etc, the worst thing you can do to yourself is drive yourself into a frenzy because of the wait.
---
The end of Eve is beginning
---
 i have question, what if you loose that phone? lets say it gets destroyed not stolen
---
i have considered security measures like password managers or google authenticator but fear of loosing everything because i loose my pendrive/phone/hard drive is higher than fear of being hacked
---
Upvoted.   Cause :-)
---
And it’s really a Vendetta!
---
Some capitals? Try hundreds
---
Great. Now they just need to ban that jackass and the forums will finally be quiet.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
You've severely misunderstood the point of this, mate.
---
Machariel was always my favorite, but I did not have a great use of it. 
---
And I loved the wolf so much.
---
the thing is that there was a time where all playstyles were viable.
---
I wish you great luck in recovery man. May it be quickly resolved. Fuck those hackers
---
In 10% TiDi.... That is like 3 minutes real time?
---
To be fair Citadels were put into the game during the tail end of WWB after Goons were already in Sarenen for some time, therefore Citadels weren't really part of the war for the defenders at all. Citadels were added in the last week of May 2016 and Goons moved to Delve about 50 days after at the end of July 2016.
---
ibis cause its free
---
the wars happening right now are literally 'for the fuck of it' wars prosecuted by most of the game against the rest of the game for no reason other than giving their members something to do. it's meaningless and everyone knows it
---
Well, Google suggests writing down the seed codes or printing out the QR codes that represent them and keeping them somewhere safe.
---
Get get the code that creates the authenticator. So you'd have to lose the phone and the copy of the code before you were in for trouble.
---
Seems like a market opportunity for you.
---
haha u salty lmao
---
My corps recon role is currently vacant. What resources / tips could you recommend for me to learn the role?
---
Your awesome though guy attitude is making me hard tho
---
use lastpass authenticator, you can recover it across phones for if you lose your original phone. Just do not use your last pass master password anywhere else, nor type it into a pc you don't fully trust.
---
I agree with the overall message you are bringing to the table. However, what is needed is an ambitious rework of the game. No quickfix, but a profound critique about the game mechanics that drive the game. And they should have started with lowsec, taking into account the many players that considers pvp as a sport. 
---
I am not optimistic, honestly.
---
I doubt it is worth it for you to set up your own ratairu. There is probably plenty of raitaru in HS with low enough taxes. figure out what's worth producing and haul the shit you need and you're good to go.
---
i think redefining damage cap is probably a lot more messy than removing a module. could be wrong but i doubt it
---
I don't disagree with you. everyone is fair game in M-O, undocking is consent to pvp there. just leave everyone alone outside.
---
It's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it :P
---
:bigthink:
---
Serious note, don't fuck with 4chan. It's like running with scissors. You think it's funny to be edgy until you fall on the blade. Weaponized autuism is real with those weirdos.
---
Recon has in flying recon ships with long range tackle during fleet fights ?
---
 To be fair Citadels were put into the game during the tail end of the Casino War/World War Bee after Goons were already in Sarenen for some time, therefore Citadels weren't really part of the war for the defenders at all. Citadels were added in the last week of May 2016 and Goons moved to Delve about 50 days after at the end of July 2016.
---
TEST was evicted just before the start of 2017, iirc ECs came out just a few weeks before in the Ascension release which is when the Rorqual got changed. Super Proliferation really ramped up in the months following the Rorqual release, which wasn't really a factor for the wars here.
---
I was using 2FA (lets send a code to your email to verify)... now I'm using MFA (on my phone) for the accounts I managed to reclaim myself.  
---
When the situation is resolved I'll then be moving everything off [sky.com](https://sky.com) as their email doesn't support MFA or 2FA onto my Office365 MFA'd account.  
---
To clarify... they didn't attack my EVE accounts directly... they hacked my email account and from there they did the damage... resetting passwords, then changing the account details in EVE's account management.  
---
It sucks... but I got some salt from the hacker.. so not all bad.
---
1/10 for troll post. Better luck next time
---
Accurate though
---
Its more referring to scouting out wormholes, creating tacs. We're a nomadic null pvp corp that does a lot of roaming.
---
That's why I asked.
---
I think that is highly optimistic.
---
so there is failsafe? thanks, i will reconsider using it
---
About as bad a joke as the condom used on the night you were conceived.
---
dank dude
---
Alts created to exploit that free SP we got in the 16 years of EVE celebration.
---
So probably more scouting.
---
In regard to WH you need to ask how was your corp was proceding in regard to bookmarking. If you often use WH to travel I wouls suggest using tripwire or something like that to map WH.
---
In regard to scouting / finding targets I would say dotlan is your best friend, look at the NPC killed delta for the region, that kind of stuff.
---
i'm not saying it was a bad patch, just that the heavy-handed nature of the fatigue/jump changes killed a slew of playstyles completely. fatigue and jump ranges as they exist now (fatiguless jump gates aside) are a lot more forgiving than after phoebe, and i bet a lot more of those groups would have found ways to adapt their playstyle under these mechanics than did at the time.
---
the "summer of rage" also stopped CCP from releasing anything big or controversial from fear of players repeating that "summer of rage" so yea...good job i guess...
---
Kikimora looks good. Decent speed puts up a good fight.
---
one more off the list
---
I know its a lot of work but seriously, get a password manager, have a unique password for all your services and accounts and activate MFA wherever possible.
---
I once dodged a bullet when i had an unauthorized login to my steam account from a russian IP. Luckily steamguard prevented the login and I changed all my passwords, put MFA on everything and put the MFA seeds in my keepass in case my authenticator app breaks for some reason.
---
The most important account to protect is your mail account. It's incredibly easy to gain access to your whole life if someone gets access to your mails. From there someone could take over all your other accounts and screw you big time.
---
Also remember that there are services where you log in with your facebook or google account. This is a good thing as long as the facebook and google account are protected accordingly.
---
Protect your accounts before something happens. The RL impacts might be worse then just some lost assets in EVE.
---
Brilliant thank you! I'll look more into tripwire, wormholes are an area i've only really dabbled in so far.
---
How to save Eve?  
---
Close Reddit and play the game.
---
&gt;THINKING OF ACTUAL SOLUTIONS!
---
You must be new here. There're probably more "ways to fix eve" posts than actual shitposts
---
yeah but even with the best will in the world, that would take any company well over a year (probably 2-3) to implement. we don't have that long, and there is no way people are going to just wait around for that length of time even if it were going to happen (spoiler: it won't).  
---
[here are some changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c0b8xf/bitter_vet_brainstorming_session/er3wu1v/) that ccp could make to the existing code which would dramatically improve the game without upending everything or starting from scratch. i'd like to see them start with that stuff first, so we don't have to deal with 4am wednesday timers and 9-day ref-&gt;kill mechanics for another few years.
---
Not entirely true. There is still a *"no AoE warp disruption within 500km of the CCP structures or gates"* rule in effect for M-O. Which is what people are complaining about: idiots bubbling their supers on undocks and killing them as they try to jump out of the system.
---
For most people the CCP Sotiyo in there is the most efficient place to build supers for testing, so allowing people to gank them on the undock there would make absolutely no sense.
---
I like guard and basi because in a big fleet you are on someone else's watchlist :)
---
&gt; identical AF skills
---
:thinking:
---
Man that’s overly salty for a shitpost
---
Oh no your mother taught me well about that.
---
So what you've saying is sash was tri's hard carry, and leaving means that tri was incapable of fending for itself without sash? Yeah, we're the ones with "brain damaged leaders." Sucks to suck, huh?
---
I love how versatile t3c's are. My favourite is the loki. I'll load it up with a couple refits and stay out in geminate for weeks, there's almost never a 1v1 I feel I couldnt atleast have a go at and if it escalates I slip away.
---
I can agree to the know what your doing. But ive avoided enough sabres to know ot works way better than mwd. The trick is aligning yourself to something and not just launch yourself off into the distance. 
---
The mwd also fucks up your agility too just dosent take as long to get the acceleration to warp. But the sig bloom is what gets you instalocked and dead.
---
Soat coffee over keyboard. 
---
Would read again
---
You can save yourself from future scams by just not ordering any official Eve merch. CCP just can't get it right.
---
Yea just WAY to expencive to be worth it pirate ships are to cheap to make navy viable :(
---
Better than the stupid "just make a bigger bomb" posts tbh.
---
Nah mate best troll post what you mean its at least a -1/10
---
Yup
---
Make it so that you're unable to fit Cynos on caps, if you want to bring in your caps you have to do so in a ship that can easily be popped.
---
Isn't the scorpion dead with ECM nerf? Scorpion navy is sweet though!
---
So you like speed huh
---
Make it so that cynos can't be fitted on caps. If you want to bring in a cyno it has to be on a ship that can be popped.
---
That's sounds like a stupid idea.
---
I'm not playing Eve any more, so no idea. Used the Rattlesnake last flight.
---
Not wrong tbh.
---
Run a gnosis. Fast align, use 5 t2 huffers and a mining link. Better huffing than a prospect, and if you multi box then it makes other prospects insanely good.
---
No wonder auto mod deleted it. The posy is utter garbage.
---
There's a service/app called Authy which means the tokens are backed up to the server so you can use multiple devices.
---
lets be honest.  at this point SkillU is just a rental alliance that harbors a shit ton of bots.  Them dying is a good thing for eve.  Maybe their members that want to do shit will leave the dronelands, stop protecting the garbage that is rental bots and provide some content.
---
This is so understandable. We do lowsec fleets nearly every day, but many times we are only 70-80% of our original fleet by the time when we actually get something to do. This is in t1 cruisers lol.
---
I doubt they are much interested in renter gameplay.
---
Well, the goon ballot is well known... does this also cover the smaller things? I know someone that voted for me, amongst others, and it is entirely possible he is the only one who voted in such an... interesting way. Will I be able to see that in the published results?
---
i think the new highsec triglavian stuff might do gods work to keep them in eve for good
---
Eh?

Someone's not been paying attention to [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) ...

Next time, you may want to try something like [this](https://www.facebook.com/SilverElephant1/photos/a.1398330123578987/2274414205970570/?type=3&amp;eid=ARAYylbahXo88AqollFVEjBbvPIArVsXF7FptxnJaz6TcNRN5GbMEddgYVC8IRg50Hez3P3p5Sw7fvNY&amp;xts%5B0%5D=68.ARC5v_IuPwBfT584E336w4Y1x9BKabwz_6fhYh3a2_e4RoxN-7F06ivpcGKjdVan8-VW7y5ZpmGhkZajQmOMd1bdZIuWQNxgdAAgva9LgdYqZse3EIMsYiEHYocS159PQaHq83AhCXAe6rgiJ4RZTG6ovlYrszX7pE_Dk6ztYY9Ur21hGz2rNNyDkkgcScGCHXD1Xo6_P0zfPW2Yq4ntB33HUO8Ws4QT0LVpwqtaDf2MCRRMX89mXVCpo0isHHbYwD-5g84_0vT6L7u5_OnHXsrMAnhwFhfG9vbaZh55miKA5odmv77YuasdjPOSrYED8MSKfWAmS9NqSCjErR_1l2CaYkU&amp;__tn__=EEHH-R) instead
---
you just had to jinx it  
---
it has almost 30mins and server is still down
---
What a great envisioner you are. Except skill u has been controlling the most sov out of anyone and are leaving out of boredom.
---
Oddly enough the Atron  
---
The memories of when i was starting eve, being excited and shooting stuff with an atron. Man it makes me smile remembering them.
---
Just buy super and go jolo in lowsec
---
CCP give me my 1,000,000,000 SP
---
Not if you shield tank it.
---
the 500000 Titans that came with skill injectors are the problem
---
I actually recorded that fight and now I feel kind of dirty about it. 
---
We killed a really blingy nightmare with decently rolled faction abyssals. He wasnt pointed or in the bubble, so we think he was so salty that he was about to die that instead of warping he was rage pulling his high grade Crystals
---
What if you made sub cap miners better so that null isnt the only place where mining is viable
---
Try posting on r/evejobs and see if any smaller groups are interested in recruiting you.
---
Why would anyone from SkillU go to deadco lol thats hillarious
---
fly safe in real life guys, you won't be forgotten in eve, elite pilots.
---
not at all im saying warran (ceo of sash) was put in charge of TRI when garst went on deployment, and ran it into the group so hard that he eventually quit and joined snuff to pave a way for his own corp to join a few months later
---
literally ask anyone outside of your corp, even skill urself started hating us because of that fucking piece of shit... he even managed to make TRI late to our own keepstar defense
---
reeeeeeeeee
---
what is the 2015 we are up to 30 minutes
---
This person was not using 2FA on their main email account and was able to reset passwords via that.
---
Everyone should be using 2FA on their email, and at least google has a app solution that's a bit more streamlined vs auth codes.
---
Please use 2FA on as many things as you can, it's a headache sometimes, but a bank/game account/social media breach is much worse. Check [Have I Been Pawned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to make sure none of your old passwords are in the wild, start using generated passwords and a manager, it really sucks but it's the state of things till we come up with something better.
---
I can agree with the it helps new bros. Bit you ended that with yet another problem.. Youve got titan, super, rorqual. Injecting into these hulls is the problem.
---
I dont care if some guy makes an amazing tengu pilot.. I care hes on his third afk rorq alt. I care that half the game can just POOF I has titans.
---
Ive been playing eve since 2012 so ive seen some shit. On my first capital maybe 3-4 months ago.. Rorquals and skill injecting into them is honestly whats killing the game. The ubiquitous amount of basic materials to build yet more capitals, is killing the game. The fact that I cant even be effective let alone on par with a singular fucking rorqual with 4 actual barges and links.. Is honestly obsurd. Rorquals have killed off any T1 industry that isnt in nullsec or hyper specialized..
---
These are why skill injectors are killing the game.. There should either be a hard cap at 10-15m injected or you cant inject allzeecappskillllzzz cuz just training another rorqual alt is beyond unnecessary.
---
Did you just attempt to give a new player perspective as a 2 year player?
---
Yeah, that’s the kind of breakdown I’m on about, it will include the informal and hidden ballots such as your case, and you can tell it by how votes transfer
---
This is true, 
---
But what about the players that start now and don’t have to wait 3 years to fly one? The players that stick around because it is actually obtainable?
---
I like the music of the cosmos
---
Easy fix : Stop thinking green KB is the objective of a sandbox.
---
&gt; Top comment
---
&gt; What an underrated comment
---
Idgi
---
Are you saying that before anyone has even seen it?
---
Yea, sorry, what the fuck?
---
During years pvp player was farming pve and miner player. And was happy to call they carebear insult they, shame they ... with time this pve/miner player become stronger and make empire who could easeally avoid to give free green kb to pvp player.
---
Wake up time is not for CCP, but for pvp player. They need to learn it's end of easy target everywhere, and so yes it's less fun for they than easy kill... but RISK VS REWARD VS EFFORT?
---
It's not really a fail-safe so much as a deterrent to actually using 2fa  What I mean is &lt;b&gt;you have to write down or print out the fucking QR codes&lt;/b&gt; themselves and that is just one more thing you need to remember and maintain. 
---
Now look down at the advice, "get the code that creates the authenticator" and "get yet another app called Authy to back up tokens to servers".
---
Fuck that.
---
What are you referencing?
---
Save Eve stop tryning to make CCP make you're KB green for you and learn the basic of game.
---
If people have thing who could jump inside a cyno what does it means? It means people have farm for it right ? So it means this farmer was a target for X hours. 
---
If you nerf you create less content.
---
What
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but weren’t skillu blue to half of the nullsec map?
---
There is every incentive to form massive alliances and coalitions, and absolutely no reason not to at the moment. That's the problem. There's no over-farming of areas, no limit to citadels that can be placed in a single system, no exponentially scaling costs or logistics issues.
---
To start, use someone else's station, unless you have the ISK to shell out for rigs and a large production volume it isn't worth the small tax break to drop your own. As far as what to build, that depends. If you are in NS, build what is needed, doctrine ships and modules are a good place to start. You can also look at the local market and see what has a high volume or needs to be seeded. A good industrialist is at least 10% a station trader as well. If you are building for a more public market like Jita, you want to look at T2 production. T1 is best avoided as many people will mine there own minerals to build T1 goods, and sell them at a price that is below what it would cost to build them by buying the materials (in case you are wondering, doing this is a bad idea btw). Generally it is best to know the market for what you are building and it's materials. Pick up your mats from buy orders, and if you can wait for a someone to drop a large volume of mats to buy orders to do so. If you can, try and sell stuff when it's price will be the highest, usually near the weekend. You can save stuff for spikes in the near distant future as well, saving freighters for burn Jita for instance. In the end, it comes down to the numbers, find something you can build for a profit, and selling as much as you can without flooding the market and destroying your prices. [EVE IPH](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/eve-isk-per-hour-industry-program-version-4-0/79167) is a goop program for this, though it can be a bit unwieldy at times.
---
I do agree such smart
---
There's a million frigates in the game, no problem there. The problem is titans and supers being inherently unbalanced.
---
use to be that was in 2012 to maybe 2014 ish. IDK why they took it out but yeah. You must of been an older player coming back.
---
Very said to see any alliance go RIP skill yourself
---
Cyno inhibs need to online instantly otherwise they are useless.
---
Or give them a short spool up but make them deactivate active cynos once online.
---
no one is misinformed. They have just been playing eve longer than you and are returning players.
---
I like it
---
Really makes you thonk. Obviously the solution is to stop roaming altogether, and this will eliminate the super umbrellas
---
 I use 1password as my password manager and you can attach 2fa to that. Now I can access my auth codes on any device I have linked to my account there.
---
They're that member of the QFC that got lost up north.
---
Just make a delivery to him, lol. 
---
It's not so much a solo delivery in J-space that we require specifically, so much as it is a demonstration of understanding of what we do, where and how we do it. Our playstyle isn't for everyone and despite what the videos portray often involves long periods scouting, mapping wormhole chains, collecting information and waiting for an opportunity to present itself....or just camping within 5000 metres of the nearest B274. For most recruits without much wormhole activity demonstrated in their background we do often revert to sending them on a mission to make a solo delivery.
---
When was the last time a major war was fought for a reason beyond "for the fuck of it" and/or because "fuck you"?
---
I mean, you can go back to OTEC days, but idk if anyone wants to die on that hill.
---
What does opsec mean?
---
Citadel regroupement follow the same logic.
---
People regroup to be together have more defense, be less sensitive to roam of random structure basher. 
---
Beacause when you are 3 in you're WH you're easy to purge, if you are 200 become harder. If you become a super blob it's not only a little roam who can destroy you're citadel. 
---
All the point here is to explain the rootcause of all super umbrella problem is not the super umbrella, but the logic who make they born.
---
This shit happens if you don't follow good password standards. Of course could also be your email provider in which case there's nothing you could have done expect 2fa where it's available.
---
I gave the perspective how it felt to start with nothing as a newbro 2 years ago. A new bro that had access to skill injectors.
---
If the station is not there anymore (got unanchored or destroyed), you will spawn in space in the ship that you were at the time of last login.
---
1. Alt-Tab to Rorquals and launch Wetu/pull Excavs
---
2. Alt-Tab to the on of multiple Titan-Alts sitting on outgate
---
3. Boson ready

EVE 2K19
---
SMH it's a sotiyo. it has a tether. if you are warping off with an obvious bubble within 500km from it, then that's on you (the NPC in system is there to eat anchored bubbles)
---
use the "/moveme" command to get out of m-o; you dont even have to undock to do it. if the undock is bubbled and you are tethered, safe log. that wont stop you. 
---
honestly, if you can't protect yourself, you really shouldnt be in a super anyway. complaining about assholes when you know they are there and not doing anything to protect yourself is just dumb.
---
Operational Security, its basically used to not give crucial important fleet information away.
---
Nah sorry wwb was interesting this one isnt.
---
The increased safety of being in a big blob of people needs to have an ever-increasing cost attached to it. Otherwise we end up with a blue donut, as seen currently.
---
So I don't pvp, they won't have a super umbrella to defend against the pvp I don't do?
---
well said HK AT kapitano
---
me personally will remember PL/NC as the elite pvp guys that dropped on smaller and/or weaker groups with the biggest titan/mothership blob back in the days. Goonswarm i'll remember as the guys that fly rifters and talk shit
---
To be honest i have see in delve people roam alone and yes sometimes people wait to gate to blap him... but he was less hunt and survey as a cyno alt of bomber bar for exemple. 
---
But i think remove the super umbrella will be hard now, people has learn to use it now. It's like immunity of human corpse. Will take a long time to make vaccinne loose effect.
---
Really gets the noggin joggin. 
---
We all should just honor the NAP of others and never attack each other, taxation is theft and big Sov-Alliances are just thinly veiled attempts at globalisation. Oh, and spaceship chemtrails turns Pilots risk-averse.
---
is this comment serious?
---
It's a fair point, but what would you point to as evidence things are going well? I can't see any publicly knowable metric I could possibly use to argue that things are going well.
---
&gt; Weaponized autuism is real with those weirdos.
---
We're watching you
---
During the last patch actually. Before the last patch, if you dock at a station/citadel with no ships in it, you'd automatically get a Corvette. They added a "Board a Corvette" button which will use a Corvette that you have in station if you have one or give you a new one if you don't.
---
I said nothing about how "interesting" the wars are.  I don't think anyone would argue that conflict was about money moons or good space.  It was "fuck you".  Grudges, not resources, have been the main reason for big conflict for this game, is all I'm getting at.
---
Omist and Feythabolis are not FRT regions, yet they are as bot infested as any chinese controlled region.
---
"interesting" is what keeps people subbed and playing though.
---
They could rent Omist/Feythaboliys from Legacy and join their bots ... hypocrites ... disgusting ...
---
Lose the gun and replace the damage control with another stab. Use Halcyon Core Equalizers instead of the tech 1 versions.   
---
Lose the data analyzer, don't bother with data sites, risk v. reward is not worth it.   
---
Use Sisters probes if you can afford it.
---
pvp bad
---
All wars are meaningless. We should all just suck on our spod in peace and unity. Tapi btw.
---
But seriously do we need more reason to go to war and pew pew other than "stuff to do" aka content. I mean if they wont come to us we have to come to them.
---
Undefeated this year tin.
---
Man you nerds are complaining about 15 minute DTs it used to an hour minimum!
---
When i first started out in WH space, i used t1 exploration frigates.
---
It can be done and the experience you gain doing wh stuff without a cloak really helps understanding the dynamics.
---
also one good hacking site will pay off several new tech 1 ships.
---
That's what i would recommend.
---
Oh, I missed that part about the mail not having 2FA! 
---
And yes, all those are good advices to get your info safe.
---
P3AK didn't help win any new sov, but the corp has definitely pulled its weight fights- and entosis-wise. But then, what would you know?
---
Neuting cap boosters lmao
---
War is out of Meta in 2k19, it is now down to blueballs and prestaged "fights" with no meaning
---
oh great you idiots thinking this game is about pvp
---
honestly i dont even care if they add golden ammo, this game isn't about pvp
---
It's not like it should surprise anyone, but it still hurts to read it
---
So ignoring the goon trolls I actually agree the cyno is a problem. It should either have a spool up time 30s to a min or have some limit on how much can come through.. 
---
Cuz you can literally spawn in entire fleets with a singular cyno.. Nvm the ratting cynos.. Omg the inhib tho.. Which takes a whole min to set up.. While taking fire from the ship thats dying.. Ive seen carriers cheese them so bad you cant even target the fighters while they killing the inhib. Honestly I can even agree that the base cyno NON covert should just be removed and covert be the only one but I know how many will cry at that change.
---
My issue is the instantaneous moment of fleets yes fatigue is a thing but only prevents repeat use which solves fleets moving across the map but not around theyre own backyard. 
---
Defence fleets are great.. Sept most large alliances have one on standby waiting for a tackle call and the cyno.. Which makes attacking a sov holder kinda pointless if they can just POOF 30+ carriers onto your grid.. Only a point if youve got 300 bombers ready to go.
---
I honestly dont understand how its gone this long being instant
---
Email them back and say if he contacts you again, you are turning over the information to India police/govt. They dont take things lightly over there. If convicted they would spend years in jail.
---
Imagine being this retarded
---
Heavy bombers.  Either bombs designed for anti-cap or citadel torps or something along those lines.  Make it shit enough it can't be used on anything smaller than caps.
---
I think it's less about motivations and more about consequences. Like when you get down to it very nearly every war certainly since I started playing has been for the fuck of it with very few exceptions. Maybe the Fountain war (r64 rebalance) and TRI invading drones (acquire renter space) are only ones that come to mind as having unequivocal purpose.
---
Imo it's better to look at in terms of consequence. TEST/CO2 got evicted from Tribute/Vale? Just pack your bags and head to basically empty space down south? WWB? Log in those 93PI supers a couple weeks after everyone got bored and head to Delve. TEST and Frat fighting now? Eh frat's fine and both sides have plenty SRP money to keep this going for a long time.
---
People have no trouble finding reasons, consequences are whats really lacking.
---
Oh my god, how haven't we though about before, we should have roamed in solo T1 frigates so that we get killed by a single caracal instead : At least we will get to enjoy not dying to supers !
---
You should always be able to say *why* you're saying no. Because an Admin is there to serve the needs of the company. 
---
Even (especially) those needs they don't know they have. (which is why you say no :D )
---
The Stapler?  Ugh
---
&gt;Blueing everything that moved and creating a literally unfightable blob - that's how you took tribute. 
---
Is this a reference to the CFC / Imperium, or is it Imperium tears about losing WWB?
---
Who is Xenuria?
---
Omg this would be a wild idea!
---
Almost like the rorq flys miniature hulks!
---
I'm not sure what's worse. Legacy blobing every fight to win, or the fact that in over 3 months of winning with blobs, they've only taken out one ihub and only then because Winter Co were spanking a TEST titan for jumping instead of bridging.
---
To add to what he said, a really good career path you can take as an alpha is gas harvesting in wormholes. It's more dangerous, but with every trip, you get enough gas to replace your venture multiple times over.
---
Although honestly, outside of moon mining in a barge/exhumer (or the famed Rorqual) helped by mining boosts, mining is actually very, very bad ISK. And if you're doing it alone as your main activity, you will quit this game in a month. Think of mining as a social activity you do with corpmates and you will find it to be an enjoyable activity. 
---
Exploration, Gas harvesting (referred to as Ninja Gas Huffing if you want to search for a guide) are probably the activities with the best return on investment in both skillpoints and ISK invested. You can easily reach 50-100mil/hr doing those activities. Compared to roughly 5million ISK/hr mining asteroids in a Venture as an alpha.
---
You’re not years behind as a new player. You train and get really good at flying frigs/destroyers. You get into frig logi and ass frigs, ewar frigs ect. Very important yet skipped part of eve now days. They game was originally beautifully setup. Now, everyone skips their way into capitals and rorqs. There is nothing depressing about starting new.  The fact that this is missing and everyone is in a fax, super, titan, dread is why we have this extremely stale gameplay. So yes, skill injectors are cancerous and never should have been introduced. Free to play was more than enough.
---
I mean... im pretty much living in o3 and meming it
---
Phanstasm is always fun-times!  
---
I don't think there's a ship that i can be as reckless with my bad connection as with this one! That and also 65kehp cheap buffer machs. Fit:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/73488365/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73488365/)   
---
I'm still accepting donations in form of fiends!
---
What? Rorqs are literal shit right now.
---
A rorq is 2.5 retreivers. 4 barges with links is vastly superior to 1 mining rorq, especially if you go t2 barges or even just covs.
---
Real question: I have 2fa on for my google account, yet when I try signing in from an unknown device, I am presented with a list of options for getting my 2fa code besides the app, like email, a phone call, and a bunch of other ones. Whats the point of 2fa if it can be bypassed? I wonder if there is a setting I can change
---
Is flying a titan the only way for you to play the game? Otherwise, what is it that you cannot do as a new player? I mean, while slowly working towards getting a type of ship. A cruiser isn't an unobtainable goal, especially nowadays. T2 stuff will take longer, obviously.
---
But again, if having a titan is the absolutely only way you can play this terrible game, then there's nothing anyone can do. Supercapitals were never meant to be used so ubiquitiously. And (ooooooooooooooobviouly) everyone wants to be the big dick in the biggest ship available and, well, here we are. Supers everywhere.
---
Ban Goons, they ruined the game xd
---
It really sucks but i would be more worried about your personal information. Eve is just a game and trust me you will forget about it in 1 months time.
---
2FA helps but the core issue is to be aware of your online activity and don't be lazy. Meaning no shady sites, shady downloads, free wifi's and you name it.
---
Somewhere along the line you either downloaded something or got sniffed on a free wifi. We developers can take alot of worries out of your head and thats our job and we love it but the root of the problem is people being careless.
---
Please! Be aware of your online activities.
---
Not everybody is aware this happens on SiSi until it happens to them. Few people spend much time thinking about the test server until they need to test something. - They know the rules and that this *shouldn't* happen, so they aren't expecting it to happen. People aren't as careful on SiSi as they would be on TQ, for obvious reasons.
---
And by the time it happens to them the first time they've literally lost weeks of manufacturing time, so it's understandable they're pissed off. Blaming *them* for not knowing some losers are violating the rules - and that CCP just ignores it -  is a bit weird.
---
Fine, but I don't understand why you're intent on arguing against a point that I wasn't making.  
---
All I was saying: if there's a problem where the glassing campaign is "bad", but the casino war is "good", the problem isn't the motivation of the war.  Both come down to "fuck you".  The problem is elsewhere.  If everything else were the same, and we were invading for resources instead of a grudge, the people decrying the war as bad content wouldn't all of a sudden think it was the bee's knees.
---
No joke, I genuinely was not aware the login screen had music.
---
wtf is it saying
---
It's why I'm ditching my sky email when this is resolved... they don't support anything except the most basic security... not even 2FA.
---
Ehhh I havent updated my sheet since the latest nerf but before then they were straight up "on paper" yielding more than my whole fleet of 2 hulks and 2 covs with orca support. With a single fucking afk rorqual. I know they have been nerfed but they still mine around 1 strip miner per drone.
---
None of this takes into account the fact the rorq NEVER has to leave the belt due to ore hold and on grid compression, or its near infinit afk ability.. Nvm the NEED to be in a null block to even own one.. 
---
Its just a big toy to squish the little market, just like ratting supers and titans. The ubiquity of caps will end eve..
---
There was 1 Apostle on grid actually! :P
---
I changed my passwords after the Unreal details leak... but it is solid advice for those not aware of that site.
---
Like if sov warfare is fun these days
---
"136K ehp? that's nothing, my 600 DPS tank ASB cyclone can out last that".... 
---
Hull domi is a close contender though!
---
Hey friend don't channel your Freudian angst on me just because your parents were siblings.
---
Btw just to reinforce the intial point lest we forget due to comedy: you're an idiot.
---
I think it looks cool.
---
Also I believe it has the the strongest tank (i cant think of a tanker ship) with a mse/sse/extenders fit whilst still having very high damage, but poor range control - meaning you get rekt by kiters but can probably win any brawl.
---
You think so? I know plenty of pvp oriented people who multibox a lot
---
Covert cynos are fine.
---
Normal cynos do need a rebalance though. Either through more counters or through the module itself.
---
That being said, i dont think a spool-up is the proper way to balance them. As it does screw up logistics and fleet engagements. 
---
If the cyno has no fitting restrictions and instant activation, then its counters should be comparable in operation. Also, having an inhib that can be repped (whether is a ship based inhib or deployable) would be nice.
---
The issue isn't really that, of course it's useful to have 2fa, especially for email providers. But I very much doubt it was sky that got hacked, if im wrong we will hear it in the news in the next few days.
---
What probably happend is that you're using the same password on multiple platforms and one of those got leaked and the dude tried it on sky and it worked. Which is why you shouldn't use the same password on multiple platforms.
---
Ultimately that's the reason you got "hacked" not bad security/support at sky
---
Just because something was worse in the past, doesn't make the actual situation good by definition.
---
While i think the suggestions here aren't the best actually, i would love to see some changes to weaken the actual mechanics which allows an unlimited amount of support jumping in without any delay or restriction by whatever mechanics.
---
OP, this is what you want to do. Best all around option
---
Yeah, ikr lol
---
Used to sell 2400 of those per month
---
I agree with you that cynos currently are important for jump freighter logistics and black ops, but I am also pretty sure the EVE community can adapt if you remove them.
---
You might want to take a look at the BattleTech way of jumping between star systems:  [http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Jump\_Point](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Jump_Point) 
---
So you will have 2 spots in each system where everyone can jump to (btw, while we are removing cynos, lets remove the inhibitors as well while we are at it), you can even open this up to highsec (activating offensive capital modules in highsec will give you a criminal timer).
---
Yes it will mean that you can jump directly to Jita. It also means those 2 spots will be a hell of bumping and catalysts, so people will use the pirate jump points (I assume they will be pretty rare/disabled in tradehubs) and use adjecent systems and gates.
---
Jumping stuff around might be a bit more difficult but manageable if you replace the cyno toon with a toon that slingshots you into warp and use pirate points.
---
Blackops you can basically go anywhere you want, but in nullsec you maybe want to use pirate points as well, since the krab systems will most likely have the 2 default spots bubbled
---
Only the renters we owned, which is obviously a lot but you don't exactly miss out on interesting fights by doing that. Bluetral with Panfam and FRT, red to Imperium, Legacy (Fire), GOTG, and various others.
---
seems like really abysmal DPS to me,  what kind of targets would you pick with that?
---
Proof is the issue... the email address he used to email me appears in many account lists.  
---
The best I could do was file the report to DigitalOcean who's infrastructure was being used for the attack.  
---
I imagine the attacker setup a small droplet which they used as a vpn proxy.   
---
My India accusation comes from the 2FA pins sent to my email via amazon.in
---
Well, decline in logged in users in EUTZ prime by 30-40% since 2013/14, in same time rise in accounts per real player due to patches heavily favouring multiboxed semi-afk-activities bringing insane amounts of ISK.
---
So it is these points:
---
* approx. only 50% of the real players of 2013/14
---
* an AFK-VNI ratting Havens bringing 60 Mio ISK/hr demands less interaction than market orders and is easily multibox-scalable (with VMWare stuff you can use 10 Alpha Accounts for this)
---
* 3 Rorqual Toons farm you the ISK for a JF in about 2 days
---
Exactly this!
---
Also remember to either liquidate all assets on your old account and transfer the isk to the new one or just contract everything you have directly to your new character.
---
For most people it won't look like much, but if you are starting again it will help you a lot on your first steps.
---
Exactly
---
I say one again, that if you want content, then you need to basically okay against the Imperial. Goons are the largest and the dropper (auto correct nailed that one) cap umbrella cannot reach everywhere. If you are that large of an alliance, consolidate your property, and make it a fight against goons. 
---
Those who say there is nothing else to do just don't want to fight Goons. If enough did take them on, this i think would be a different game.
---
Its my sandbox. If I want to destroy everyone elses toys without losing my own thats my prerogative.
---
If I want to build sandcastles and invite 60% of the box to live in them while I stomp on the people who dont that's my prerogative to.
---
Easy fix: stop trying to control what people do in a sandbox.
---
So might as well write down and keep safe your 40 character password?
---
Good stuff
---
Prices for T2-Reactions and most T2 construction components are at 130% to 160% of pre Lifeblood patch prices. Same with the T2-Products depending on them, like BlackOps f.e. that are at around 140% of pre Lifeblood ...
---
Favorite ship...thats a toughie
---
Right now, my favorites are my logi, scimi, guard, basi, apostle, and mino
---
For DPS though, I have a soft spot for lokis
---
Yeah, tengu every day. Heavy missile fit, usually tank is the issue. Active shield, with extender buffer. Occasionally fit with web/scram. Just the safest hull around! Covefe!
---
I prefer the players that stick around because they used those 3 years to learn the game over the kids that buy plex, get the injectors and a titan, get bored dropping on everything after a while because thats literally the only thing they ever archieved in game and sell the account on ebay.
---
I have no idea how old you character is, but I would recommend flying for a month using only t1 cruisers and below. Yes there is content, yes it is fun. But when all the players around you are using shinny fun toys you want to as well. I very rarely use the titan, but bombers, t2 and t3s, black ops, assault cruisers, all of these take a long time to get into.
---
It’s not about NO content, it’s about the ability to get on the same level as everyone else
---
mfw best pvp group in eve dies
---
When was the last time you were limited to frigs and destroyers? There is content, but I am talking about the ability to retain players, giving them more variety quicker.
---
When i was a new player and retained by the fact.
---
Elo “how to eject” memes will never die. I thank Elo for glorious meme content!
---
Literally unplayable
---
Well said, sir.
---
Are you?
---
Trium's fleet decreased lately no? I know that few of their supercaps get caught quite some time ago and die after that I only heard of trium in subcap but i guess they will come back up some day
---
alltime logged-in-account highs were around 2013/14 at the height of tiericide patches and after Phoebe patch (EU prime Saturday 60-65k logged in), when Lowsec Cap-Brawls were skyrocketing in numbers.
---
Today we are on a good Saturday reaching 35k logged in accounts, and today there are very much more Alt-Accounts and Multiboxes than 2013/14. So my elaborated guess is that butss-in-chairs is already below 50% of 2013/14.
---
What? Barges are also superior in that fact.
---
A covetor barge fleet can sit in a large anom and literally clear the whole thing without ever moving.
---
 Rorqs are 2.5x retreivers if we are talking just straight yield. If you want to involve movement, its probably under 2x as effective as a barge.
---
Also who the fuck is using an orca, use a boosting rorq lmao.
---
My new BG screen @work :)
---
I completely agree with you. I should stress that I'm not arguing the game is or isn't doing well, simply pointing out that the pants-on-head-feces-flinging approach OP took is both unhelpful, and incredibly unlikely to be taken seriously.
---
Ultimately it will come down to the metrics we have access to; those will be PCU, married to perhaps the destruction metrics published in the MER. i.e. if less players are logging in then, theoretically, PvP ship losses should also be dropping, or perhaps those players are all focused on krabbing, in which case the mining/bounties metric is relevant.
---
The data is there and open to people making extrapolations. I just get very annoyed with reading a doom and gloom statement like OP made with nothing offered in validation.
---
So salty redline. 
---
So if you want to destroy everyonne toys, make effort for that. Don't ask CCP for auto win button.
---
Make sure that your Authenticator app backs up to the cloud, or you write down your backup codes for everything. Otherwise losing your phone means *really* losing all your accounts.
---
My phone broke and I lost everything because Google Authenticator doesn’t back up to the cloud or anything. Switched to 1Password after that and fortunately recovered most of my accounts with cached browser logins and a few recovery codes scattered across my computer.
---
Hence the 2 competent, 3 technically. They never officially switched to armor.
---
&gt;consequences are whats really lacking
---
Or, at least, the perception of (the right type of) consequences.  
---
I mean, I think it's hard to argue that there weren't significant _consequences_ to WWB.  The Imperium that limped out of that was dramatically different than the one that existed a year prior.  Just because we were allowed to rebuild and capitalized on it hard doesn't mean there weren't consequences.  "Oh we just noped away with all our shit" really doesn't do the conflict justice.
---
I say ditto to the previous round of the northern war.  Sure, do the northern alliances largely still exist?  Sure.  Was GotG harmed in a significant way?  I think they absolutely were, and that's before you even get to the shakeup of the coalition-level alignment up there.  
---
In general, I agree with what you're saying -- I just don't know what people realistically want as "consequences".  Do the pile of dead titans at X47 and however many keepstars not count as "consequences"?  This is mostly rhetorical, but I just don't know how much of this is a real lack of consequences vs a jaded playerbase.
---
PVP is not bad. 
---
But the fact is we assist to an over escallation symptom.  Beacause hunter with time bring more and more people to hunt, defender bring more and more defense.
---
But we are in age witch industrial have more gun than people who attack. It's how you have super umbrella creation. 
---
It's an human mechanic and if you try to solve that by just add stupid mechanic you will just miss you"re goal. It's why my post said.
---
Stratios. My first love for PvP came from this expensive loveboat. The terror that explorers must feel when this giant ringed penis uncloaks on them makes me feel funny inside.
---
I don't fly it as often now because 70+ killmarks makes it my must treasured boat.
---
Sky doesn't host their own email... its hosted with yahoo.  
---
Whilst yahoo provides 2FA to their native domains they don't provide it for customers of sky.   
---
As for different passwords for different services... my passwords are unique containing upper/lower/numbers and specials.   
---
But it is a good takeaway for others reading this.
---
No the goal of the post is to explain the rootcause of super umbrella. 
---
If you understand this, you understand 99% of reddit post to "how to solve problem" are just uselless they don't solve the rootcause, they solve only a symptom.
---
That actually sounds about right
---
Yeah I agree it's been a while since a war emerged from ingame reasons so I understand your point to the OP that that debate is moot.
---
That doesn't mean however that the current wars are sub-drivers like WWB was though. The TEST/FRT war is a bit more interesting but the North isn't, particularly because we knew the outcome since from the beginning (and didn't for WWB).
---
Hecate, 
---
can be cheap 900dps fit for ganking bigger ships with friends or can be a really versatile brawler with insane tank if you fit blue reps and a cap booster.
---
He's saying "stop complaining about super umbrellas, the dirty roamers killing us innocent krabs are the baddies".
---
Im not trying to shit on anyone here as I’m actually said that a pure pvp alliance is leaving however do you think you’d have more fun with less blues and less shit to manage?
---
Basics steps are:
---
T1 production: 
---
-buy a researched blueprint original, buy an unresearched original from NPCs and research it yourself or buy a copy off of contracts
---
-Buy or mine the minerals you need build (Don’t forget to factor in what you could sell the raw ore for instead if you are mining)
---
-build your item
---
T2 production: this is the more skill intensive route (both in game and logical) and therefore less people doing it and more profits to be made usually. 
---
-obtain your blueprints. Now this time you have to make a copy to invent a t2 version of. (This is super simplistic and could be a topic alone)
---
-make a t1 version of the item as that’s required for the build of the t2 unless it’s a rig. 
---
-obtain all the PI, moon goo and minerals you need
---
-build the t2 components
---
-now you build your t2 item 
---
I won’t go into t3 or capital production but that’s the gyst of it in super simplistic terms. 
---
When I put up my own Raitaru and rigged it for what I made the most I had basically 3 alts doing industry full time. It’s generally not going to be worth it to put up your own unless you’re at that point. There are plenty of public structures you can use just fine. Remember there are fuel costs with a raitaru so you’d have to make more than the fuel cost and then some to pay off the raitaru and rigs you bought to be worth it over public. There are some nice convinces of having your own structure though.
---
Fortunately the only details they'd be able to pull are my name and address.  
---
Apart from the paypal account all of my financials are on my Office365 tenant.  
---
It was pretty much games left on my sky acount.
---
Definitely get one. It kills almost everything that comes within 10k range.
---
more or less this. Back when my friends were playing "hotdrop o'clock" was just me in an oracle being "fashionably late" as their mallers barely dented the blingy carebear. Ah, good times.
---
&gt;(I) have injected to the point of having titans, supers and rorqs. I can now enjoy the huge selection of content I have access to.
---
This is what i will remember being in skillu

Skill urself was one of the last bastions for small gang meme lords. You will be missed by many, and I feel the game will lose a fair few "gud" pilots with this.
---
I run it with neuts and anything smaller than you that needs cap to survive will usually eat shit if you can land the scram.
---
Are they all multiboxing several dozen accounts that just afk spin in Havens or sit munching rocks?
---
You go ahead sir! Will pay up to 10% above jita in doxi just out of laziness. ISK is not an issue
---
Meh, Minmatar is dakkadakkadakka
---
No it’s the answer to the ultimate question. The ultimate question itself remains elusive
---
The Harbinger. Because it is pretty. I never get to fly one though :(
---
I'm a new bro with 4m sp, I could barely buy 2 small skill injectors if I spend all my isks. I'm not sure how a noob can really benefits from the skill injectors unless paying with real money (10€ for a large injector tho)
---
Hope you guys are all doing well.
---
I'm in the office right now but boy is it going to be a busy weekend.
---
Date tonight, coaching my team mates at a jiu jitsu competition tomorrow, then Sunday is father's day. Also Monday I'm expecting a consultation phone call for some potential surgery. It's all going on!
---
Even the next few weekends after this one are going to be busy!
---
That only bugs me when i'm already in a wormhole and not looking to leave.
---
Tl;dr you need another glue bottle to sniff
---
&gt; No the goal of the post is to explain the rootcause of super umbrella.
---
The root cause of super umbrella is that supers apply way to well to subcaps and alliances can set up with 30k characters in a single region without too much issues.
---
Your "explaination" is retarded.
---
I really don't think so. The summer of rage was really about how neglected the game was up to the point. Years of work for captains quarters and micro transactions with no game play or bug fixes.
---
Well just from my experience is that users lie about their own password ussage and until we hear that sky/yahoo got hacked (which is extremely unlikely) I and every helpdesk support you come in contact with will assume you either lie about using unique passwords, they're not as unique as you think, you fell for a phising scam or you've got a virus/keylogger.
---
you ram stuff you can kill
---
i have a feeling that it will be the nano oracle if i ever get to fly it
---
You can't have my titans
---
Hope your surgery goes well mate
---
You don't happen to still have the same password as of 2013? Yahoo got hacked back then.
---
&gt;SkillU, a waste of potential.
---
And you know about potential because...?
---
It's not clear how you do that without turning the big coalitions into smaller out of game associations with the same number of actual players.
---
I use the paid version of Dashlane. So if there’s a breach somewhere the password is unique to that site.
---
It’s synced to the cloud afaik, encryped and all that ofc, so if my two computers + my phone die at the same time I’m not fucked.
---
All I have is a single password I made for Dashlane. So it can’t be found as a result of some other service being breached.
---
I am still struggling with the STV, even after all this years.
---
If someone votes for:
---
Lorelei / Xenuria / Mike
---
and Xenuria is elimated before I am... then the vote transfers directly to mike...
---
So how would I know Xenuria was in between us?
---
Hunters gonna hunt. Farmers gonna get safe under the uncontestable umbrella. You can't blame human behavior.
---
What creates the umbrella is the fact that you can cram 100k accounts in one region, and that it has no proper counters.
---
&gt;It was a joke.
---
Were you?
---
Shit I forgot dreads can carry infinite cap boosters

Trying to get me fired looking up the filthiest of smut at work, I'm on to your meta games

---
I'm really sorry that you dudes are leaving , but instead of biomass , would you please be that kind and send me some ISK so I can use it accordingly? I don't know who to PM ... so I ask here. My in-game name is Sun Tzu's   . Thank you!! 
---
Imagine being this salty, still.
---
Wouldn't it be possible to force the capital skills to be trained ? If you couldn't inject those, that'd be a nerf to the stupid caps/rorq alts getting the rich even richer and the powerful even more powerful, without impacting any other aspect.  
---
Because yeah, the problem isn't injectors by themselves. I started Eve early 2017 ago and i was really happy to be able to kickstart my career by injecting the money i earned into new valuable skills for me and my corp.
---
I have 1 million + skill point to use from the last event. I have my skills laid out that I want to allocate the points to.
---
Does the Master at Arms Cerebral  Accelerator Booster effect how many skills I will gain from the 1 million skill points?
---
Should I buy one and use the booster before allocating the skill points to gain more skills? 
---
This character only has 4.5 mil sp at this point.
---
You can also view it the other way around. Skill injectors made the number of players with low SP very small. This lead to nothing to do for low SP players. If the number of low SP players were higher they could shoot other like themselfes. But as there are not that many people feel compelled to inject. Which leads to even less low SP players which leads to even less for those to interact with.
---
"If it wasn’t for skill injectors I don’t know if I would have been willing to spend at least a year getting to a decent level to enjoy a huge amount of the content of this game." This leads new players to perceive EVE as pay2win. Many of those who get that perception even though it's not true in its core stop playing. Even less low SP players and even more important even less new players.
---
Overall I think that skill injectors were a bad thing although I heavily used them and still use them from time to time. The combination with the current alphas is also problematic for the overall health of the game. If I could choose I would have the current alpha states but no skill trading.
---
As skill trading can't be removed from the game by now, I'm not really sure how much we should discuss it or better speak about things that can be made better.
---
My Bard would like to have a word with you.
---
FCs and other content creators are the real power behind alliances. Unfortunately there are less and less every year.
---
wow, you're really this mad i ddn't respond to your ramblings within 10 hours of you posting? you're truly a special one.
---
So players should start now and inject into Titans straight away to enjoy Eve?
---
This is horseshit, Supers and Titans aren't even engaging content. They are nothing but Epeens that are barely even used.
---
There is a serious misconception of what new players want or need to actually play and enjoy Eve. The end game content isn't it, that's just designed so CCP can make maximum profit.
---
&gt;The news about skillu came a few hours later, tho
---
Flair checks out.
---
So when you start playing again after biomassing your mains, you will have to name version 2.0 "Reinject urself"
---
Yo thanks
---
Eve isn't dying. What's dying is the moral of salty bitter old now useless Eve players.
---
Ty sir
---
Throwing shade at a man for fighting, this is why the game sucks now.
---
Well this sucks... Sad to see an awesome group leave. Unfortunately, the gameplay a lot of us love is no longer an option. Eve just got even more devoid of actionable pvp content.
---
thanks dude
---
Twice as nice
---
Kind words, ty
---
It's CCP that doesn't listen to their community and goons are more capable at abusing mechanics then others. That aside, I don't think you understand the events that lead up to goons being able to rebuild without harassment.
---
Don't even need to blow up the Raitaru, just need to unanchor it if you want to save 500mil. But I guess you're also killing 10 t3c, so is 500mil worth the wait to unanchor?
---
this week has been a -3, but it could have easily been a -7 instead which is why i'm posting in this thread instead of complaining
---
no attributes don't have anything to do with injected skillpoints  
---
if you are on a remap, ideally you want to put skillpoints into skills that you need that are off remap
---
Remove all super and titan, get a blop of 200 T3 to every roam. 
---
You change umbrella for an other congrats. 
---
You see the symptom. Not the cause.
---
:facepalm:
---
Is a Skill Injector worth the 4 day train though? It's such a short train. If you factor it into ISK loss it means you're adding 1bil to every t3c which makes most of them simply not worth flying.
---
...but do i have your vote?
---
Shhhhh we want SP.
---
This number in 1 region was a goal of CCP seaguls if i remimber. 
---
Beacause if you have 100K in one region it make more open region for little entity who want to develop and become one day big fish. 
---
And to be honest why it don't work ? Beacause bigger entity hunt little entity... so little entity join coalition or disband to have protection (and so an umbrella). 
---
Rootcause : People are to hunter they regroup.
---
it's 2 factor auth anyway, no one said the 2nd factor has to be from an auth code app.
---
Are you okay Ailok?  is everything fine yeaha? :-(
---
Srs. I kind of regret buying my super because aside from ratting (meh) and forming up to play fleet-chicken on stratops, it's basically a hangar queen.
---
35B could have bought me a fuckton of other smaller stuff several times over, or been invested for sweet ROI's instead :/
---
Peachy.
---
Been seeing a lot of new player posts, and I've helped bootstrap a few lowsec corps recently. Even got a nice cap brawl out of it on Tuesday! I fuckin love it when helping newbros gets me content. :D
---
This isn't a spreadsheet.
---
They should have made it so you could not use unapplied skill points for capital skills.
---
Use a commercial PWM like LastPass. Keep a hard copy of your master passphrase somewhere secure (like a bank vault or home safe, etc), and then set a different strong password for literally everything you log into. Most of these attacks happen due to password reuse in which one site with weak controls is compromised, the plaintext of every credential it stored is cracked, and then attackers buy those tables and try them elsewhere.
---
The very best way to protect yourself is MFA. The second best way is unique strong passwords for every service.
---
Completely agree.
---
I know whose plan it was. Doesn't matter. It didn't achieve what it aimed for. Needs to be changed.
---
Rootcause: We know people wanna be safe. But game doesn't have to allow ultra safe regions.
---
In which case, just continue using a single password for all your stuff and accept the high likelihood that at some point one of the places you use it will get compromised and then everything else is at risk.
---
Security is hard. Suck it up.
---
Well, I started out in a small corp in a big alliance, when Sergaljerk was something like 10 guys in TEST. It was cool, we had our small corp gangs and everybody knew each other, and then we had the big alliance fleets. Eventually I ended up commanding a bunch of those. It's a lot of work to "become someone".
---
5 years later I'm back in Dreddit running small gang and being extra bittervet. Havin fun tho. I am something, I am a major content creator for the people I give a fuck about.
---
Ah, probably not a good trade-off then
---
A salvage bonus to titans may enourage me to finally train one. I would like to contribute to your election campaign. Truly you are the saviour of eve.
---
if “Large_Coalition_Support = TRUE or “Well_Known_Personality”= TRUE, print “Congratulations!”
---
if “Large_Coalition_Support = FALSE and “Well_Known_Personality”= FALSE, print “lol nice try though”
---
I fully appreciate what you're saying... and it's often what I think.  
---
I tend to be fairly good at following standard practices/procedures regarding security as it falls under part of my remit (implementing and compliance, verifying the occasional email etc) at work... being an IT manager from a technical background.  
---
Just a quick search shows that yahoo accounts can be bruteforced with relative ease without 2FA and they, as a company, have a history of being breached and announcing it years later.  
---
Which refers back to a different comment where I'm moving everything of that email address to my own domain.
---
In general, EVE needs a big rework of its music. I can't help but think the game would feel a lot more epic and engaging if it went with a more orchestral score (as seen in most trailers) instead of the extremely subtle synth music that's been used for 15 years. Compare the ambience of something like Guild Wars 2 with EVE, the difference is huge.
---
FYI, Reddit uses a markup formatting system, not HTML. 
---
So to if you place text between two asterisks like so 
---
/*/*bold/*/* 
---
It becomes **bold**.
---
Placing next between a single asterisk *italicizes*.
---
True. I guess I didnt clarify but my mind has been on these newer phone number hijacking attacks
---
My kb is quite nice actually. And i think your missing the point. I think it would be healthier for the game to remove or rework cynos.
---
:P
---
&gt;every alliance in the game with super superiority does this. 
---
they don't tho, maybe nullbloc alliances but even I respect snuff enough to not assume they're on *that* road.
---
&gt;your members get to use their toys / stay subbed and active and happy. 
---
this is one of the most interesting things, how someone can want to "use their toys(titans)" is a mystery to me for a group like snuff. I can see it for tapi or goons or w/e cause its the prob the first time they're using it and its novel, but do snuff members really enjoy using unironic sub 1 apm ships that ends every fight? 
---
you'd think that an alliance focused on fights (ls, no real sov push, etc) would want to prolong them and make people want to take said fights, not the current state of hardly anyone bothering.
---
and no im not shoot first just for the record, god no
---
Hehe, thanks.
---
8/17 shitpost, you have my vote.
---
They were also breached in 2014... but that's infrastructure breaching (access to everything) as opposed to breeching an individual account.  
---
And hell no... ok I don't change my personal passwords every 90days but I do change them more often than that.
---
Gave myself gold now I’m giving myself platinum - I must have money to blow oh oh ohhhh
---
"""""""""Hacked""""""""""
---
Right. Some poor Praheet from Mudville, India, hacked CCPs datacenter in order to access your account to get at them spacerupees.
---
More likely story: You used an incredibly stupid password on some other site, which you're also using for your Eve account.
---
Get a tool like Keepass, let it generate 256-bit passwords and store your accounts in there.
---
Brutix is my soft spot ship. It sounds silly but when i first started I saw one just orbiting a station and i just decided i had to have one. Looked incredible. Just one of my favourite designed ships. Still gives me joy just flying around in it, let alone actually doing anything.
---
Algos is also a beautifully designed ship that has a lot of utility.
---
I understand you're trying to tell us your newbro perspective, but in it's core, it is not a newbro perspective at all.
---
I do understand - Goon enemies didn’t want to put in any effort to follow through.
---
Word.. Port St Joe :p
---
Everyone would trade fighting titans and supers against fighting 200 T3C.
---
There was always the possibility to catch up. It was called character bazar. Of course you had limitations ( names, supply for characters with the fotm skillpoints etc. ), but there was the possibility. It was limited by the supply, but I bought characters in the pre injector time. A huge part of the skill injector problem is also the extraction. You can have accounts running with little to no costs if you are at a decent sp  level witch makes it easy for a lot of things ( rorqual alt number 55 or cloacky camper number 76 )
---
this sub is filled with apologists for a garbage game, just yesterday by far the best large scale pvp alliance straight up disbanded and most members(on leadership at least) quit the game because its farmville now. Make of that what you will.
---
 Online in the game has greatly decreased and this is a fact. CCP, fix it !!!
---
The game will be a poorer place without dudes like you.
---
Eventually there'll be noone left to hunt the krabs.
---
Just make it so you can’t inject into caps/supers. That way the newbros can still get those shitty fitting skills out of the way and can still catch up in subcaps.
---
What exactly was the lesson taken from being suicide scrammed if I may ask? I'm apparently not getting it :(
---
hi
---
Save, or Save As ?
---
wwb started with conflict over moon money, and spiralled from there
---
It's feel good friday my dudes
---
No, Yahoo accounts cannot be brute forced, whatever you read either was some sort of scam or it misused the word brute force. Yes it's entirely possible that yahoo got hacked once again. But the likelihood of that happening is way lower than you doing something wrong.
---
The thing is while yahoo has a bad reputation a leak like those from yahoo are noticed quickly as soon as they're used. The reason we don't find out until way later is people only selectively using those passwords(certainly not for eve accounts) or not using them at all until years later.
---
I use Authy. You can use it on multiple devices.
---
What're the advantages other than baller private digs
---
I'm having fun daytripping, but yeah, lowsec fights seemed harder to come by ? Maybe just a fluke.
---
yeah but the content is shit. why do you think progod complains about it so much? can you name a single content creator who thinks citadel mechanics are good atm?
---
And from Suitonia no less !!!
---
Take him up on the offer.
---
Come back and join the throng :)
---
No they cant but they do have way more range than a rorq assuming your moving to park yourself next to a rock. I think 45k is max? 30 is max with Orca. My point is till that rock is gone your afk. A good rock can last you an hour at least. You can MAYBE do that with a retri or mack.
---
 
---
I feel I have to make it clear its yield isnt an issue. That being said its afk ability is unsurpassed.. And that is my issue with it. You can have any number of rorqs going and just rat the day away.. Barges you need to be 100% there you get literally two minutes till a hulk is full and needs attention. Retri is obviously longer but you lose a decent bit of yield and range. Nvm none of the "good" barges have even acceptable tank, Battleskiff aside for obvious reasons.. 
---
It just pisses me off to see so many alts with afk rorqs.. The only way VNIs are worse is they give isk directly instead of flood the material market. I feel like I need one to be competitive. But then you need to be in a block to properly defend it.. Just pushing mpre nullsec than ever.
---
The other candidates don't seem to have a plan or knowledge of the game. Olmecca Gold's CSM interview for example proved that. He is mad, but has no idea what he wants to do. 
---
The trend among the other candidates seems to lean toward punishing large alliances. The moment you penalize groups for becoming powerful and wealthy, you will ruin the game. The issue isn't the 750 titans and faxs kicking in your door. It's your inability to develop a group that can combat it.
---
The focus shouldn't be on nerfing established groups, but incentivizing new players to play the game and become or join  successful alliances.
---
Eve doesnt work like that
---
Thanks. They might not approve it, we'll find out on Monday. Doesn't matter if it doesn't get approved.
---
Decent writeup, thanks. 
---
Fuck i kinda dodged a bullet by going for wormholes this time over, huh. 
---
You said hunting nullbears and ratters is harder now ?
---
people seem to forget that wwb was borne from the viceroy programme which was essentially a conflict over money moons in lowsec. then it was fuelled by harassment and mercenary isk. none of that could happen today, because of changes to the game mechanics since.
---
I play bdo and we're getting a lot of cool content I hope you guys are too!
---
Good thing I know who I'm not voting for next year.
---
EVE 2k19 -  do not forget about the at least 3k plexxed krabbing alts the 1500 fleet toons had online additionally, sadly there is so few action on all these many windows (either repetitive/bottable PvE or 10% TiDi "PvP") they still have to tab out to Netflix ...
---
this friday is weird, but at least the week is over
---
That's... certainly an interpretation.

Do you plan to kill the 2 dogs if you win next year?

Machariel - there’s something about its looks and firepower that make it formidable.

Phantasm - it looks like a spiky blowfish
---
Oracle - graceful
---
What offer? What does who gave a good advice has to do with anything?
---
&gt; What you're actually saying "I don't agree with how this game has changed".
---
&gt;viceroy programme which was essentially a conflict over money moons in lowsec.
---
The viceroy programme was 100% a "giving members something to do" thing, fyi.
---
Yep plus as a bonus we stole the iHUB they tried to drop/set you with a [Entosis FAX](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77271095/) and used it for ourselves instead, which was awfully nice of them. =)
---
...how...
---
Indeed, I'm not suggesting solutions myself. But this is what I see as the cause of all the symptoms we currently see.
---
They have roughly the same life expectancy as EVE atm so i might be safe and free next year!

EVE 2k19 - brag posts about 90k char coalition beating 45k char coalition wit 2.2:1 numbers on grid including a Cap-Escalation that was still needed to win the fight even when 2:1 outnumbering the enemy.

While I enjoy PL being served all that brag is still embarassing ...
---
People have been claiming EVE's dying since shortly after it was introduced. Ignore it. As others have said, if you're having fun continue to have fun. I don't see any of this "EVE's dying" stuff. I still see plenty of people and there are still plenty of people trying to kill me everywhere I go so I'd say it's far from dead. If anything I'd say the opposite from my personal experience.
---
O know this isn't a serious thread.

But,  rorquals aren't the issue. Excavator drones are.

yeah but what was it

---
no
---
So your newbro perspective is "Hey I got banned for account sharing but thanks to injectors, I don't have to pay for my rule breaking."
---
I have no problem with helping people accelerate skill learning but I'm wholly against being able to inject a brand new super pilot in under an hour.
---
I woule rather CCP change injectors into drugs that speed training up for a month. 50 plex gets 1X removed from the skill you're training (minimum train time of 1X) while 500 plex will buy you an injector that removes 5X 5000 PLEX gets you a reduction of 10X. (numbers probably need adjusting)
---
This would mean there's still be a minimum 1X train time for any skill to level five but you could play catch-up if you were willing to spend the PLEX/ISK and there would no longer be extractor farms or insta cap pilots but there would still be an incentive to buy PLEX, which CCP needs to survive.
---
Lol. One alliance disbands. OH NO! The game's dying. Like it's been dying for ever. I doubt very much everyone in that alliance will stop playing. THe leaders (leader) will likely RMT the assets and most of the players will move to other corps/alliances.   
---
Also, I like the way you're saying "Doom doom doom!" without any suggestions regarding what needs to be done. Nice. ;)
---
Oh you'll get no argument from me on this, I completely agree.  What I'm saying is there are pleeeenty of people who are content to not engage in space shooties, and the game is fun for them.  Again, people complaining about Eve dying are actually just saying "the fun thing i used to do changed a bit".
---
Go back to tencent.
---
I've lost both by upgrading my phone. This is why things like SMS auth and backup emails are there.
---
What a coincidence, so do I!
---
&gt; Again, people complaining about Eve dying are actually just saying "the fun thing i used to do changed a bit".
---
And how is that good for the game ? It didn't changed, it got harder to get content and destroy spaceships. If you enjoyement in the game is to destroy spaceships (or structures) and it got harder and/or less fun, they have the right to complain.
---
Yeah a lot of people don't realize their email, if not 2FAed, is basically a backdoor into everything they have online...
---
Welcome to the show...ASK FOR HELP...the community may look divided until new folks are involved then we're all down to argue about the best way to help you lol.
---
holy fuck, are you retarded?
---
In smaller groups especially you could try to make sure you have your key roles filled before the fleet.
---
Check in with your favorite scout, your favorite logi pilot (maybe not applicable in your case), people who have cynos in place (also unlikely with frigate/destroyer fleets).
---
If you want to be a cool FC, make sure you have some fitted ships available. There will be people who are like "I'd love to join but I don't have that".
---
Also if you're going on a roam, have a rough idea of where you're going.
---
Can't think of anything else you'd need to prepare tbh.
---
I've done exactly this. You reach out to customer support and answer some questions about your account that only you would know. They will remove 2FA so that you can log in and set it back up.
---
&gt; As skill trading can't be removed from the game
---
I disagree. They can remove the injectors bu changing them into drugs that temporarily boost your training but provide no direct SP. They can then remove extractors from the market and make these new drugs available for PLEX. The market changes somewhat, insta-cap pilots are no longer a thing, and CCP still has people buying more PLEX for rapid training skills without doing further damage to the game ecosystem.
---
I'm not saying they don't have the right to complain, but we've already established the game is a sandbox.  Complain away, but don't say Eve is dying because your playstyle did as the sandbox shifted.
---
Whisky
---
This is why i have multifactor on litterally everything that allows me to.
---
Which was a great time to steal their t3.
---
Let me simplify it for you OP since you're struggling:
---
There is nothing wrong with having a supercapital umbrella. If you are able to organize enough of your players that they have enough of the high value assets needed to form an umbrella, then good on you.
---
The problem arises when you can shelter everything you own or influence under that umbrella. And when that sheltering expands exponentially, it makes things troublesome.
---
Lets look at a scenario:
---
You have a supercap umbrella that rings 10 systems.
---
In those 10 systems you have condensed 300 players (100 per major timezone AU/EU/US, 10 per system, etc) who are using the space for PVE activities.
---
Those 300 players never have an inventive to move, or do anything else. They are in perfect safety under that umbrella.
---
If, however, you changed system density, so that say a system could only support say 5 players per timezone, then you would have 150 players who would need to look at activities outside the ambit of that umbrella.
---
You would then either (1) need to expand the umbrella coverage by spreading your ships out, or (2) have potential deadspots you are not able to cover rapidly without rushing, which puts your supercapitals at risk (if you need a mid for example, and you jump in 10 titans into a system that is then dreadbombed without FAX, which need to wait a further 5 minutes till they can get to you, you will have a bad time. So you have to wait to form enough, then mid everything together, and in the wasted time, it is possible the person you are trying to save is killed).
---
There is your solution then; you are able to have your umbrella, it does everything on the tin, but there is a finite period of space it can cover with prejudice, and anything wider will need alternative options and for you to get creative - and creativity in that regard should be rewarded.
---
I hope actually get elected to the CSM next year so that we know that EVE is actually dead.
---
&gt; unless paying with real money 
---
That's exactly the point. The only limit on your SP in game is the amount you're willing to spend catching up. Some people can afford to buy the requisite number of injectors to have a stable of Rorq pilots or supers, or Titans.
---
The Manicore, cause it looks sexy...
---
Oh my bad, it was a tabletop game
---
Is this an ad for their free two-factor authentication feature?
---
Luckily I have dedicated roles pretty much figured out with my group and they love that role.  Do you find limiting your roam time to a certain limit?
---
bla bla bla

and while those newbies tried to catch up to my ever growing 50 alt sp farm i alread injected another 10. good riddance
---
Well remembered, it did go well - my parents took a few days off work and went for a few days away. They ended up drinking cider by the sea and just having a few days of well deserved downtime, and I went out for dinner with them the night before they left.
---
Cheers! Yea everybody has been super friendly so far. Been having great fun whelping and killing,   
---
Community seems fantastic, new player activities are absolute shit (FW and missions) but I’ve loved the social aspects and how willing people are to help out. Had some Russians kill me with a venture full of wormhole gas and instantly sent me the isk value + some and told me to Dscan more :p

All I know is my morale is affected by how ISK poor I feel.  If I have ISK, I can feed my pew addiction.  If I don't have ISK, well then I can't feed my pew addiction and I get withdrawals and rage quit.  If morale is measured like this for other people, then winning wars is certainly tied to ISK.
---
There are a few approaches. None are perfect. All are better than not doing 2FA at all. 
---
In addition to what other’s have mentioned, if you’re lucky enough to have a backup phone you can hook up both at once. With QR setup, I just leave the QR code on screen until I’ve got it with both phones. 
---
Duo’s 2FA app has a backup and restore feature. Last time I checked it would only restore to the same OS, to iOS to iOS or Android to Android. 
---
All the approaches have tradeoffs. Consider and figure out which tradeoffs work best for you.
---
RHML Armageddon. Not because it's any good, or I'm any good at flying it... But because it looks cool, and it's cheaper than a Bhaalgorn.
---
hmm that is an interesting statement.  Makes me want to keep PLEX on my account at all times.
---
Sky usually gets their username and password hacked all the time. Entire databases. Even default wifi passwords for their routers. Very bad ISP for security. Also...by any chance did you recieve an email that looked like it was from PayPal stating that there is an IP trying to access your account and if you could continue by clicking on a link to resolve the matter and change your details? I ask this because the last 3 days I have recieved these emails. They never ended up in my junkmail or spam folder, but straight to my inbox. I knew it was false by looking at the source code of the email, seem's  like a pretty fresh phishing template. Possibly from the hacker using those utilities from the released ShadowBroker files.
---
Is it an elective surgery or for something benign? But yeah like zeronis said, hope it works out regardless.
---
^ This guy hull tanks
---
Yes, keep voting the same ppl and expect a different outcome.
---
How do they know they never got the reward if they never logged in again???
---

Gila. I love drones, and I can do literally *anything* with it
---
Do you celebrate with another jigger at the end, per killmail?
---
I'm a little old to drink that much on a fleet lol.
---
Happened to me recently, so easy answer:
---
I still had access to my account via my main pc (saved tokens) and could still play, so I just created a ticket to ccp asking them to remove 2FA to all my accounts coz ya know, stolen phone and all that, and that they could just check connecting ips to see if was in fact, still me.
---
They did that like 2 days later, after which I reactivated 2FA on my new phone and called it a day. Easy and simple.
---
Ping for a fleet
---
"Hey my nerds lets go kill some stuff. I need some motivated individuals in rollers, and some beautiful people flying logi. If you tackle something you're a certified hottie."
---
People form up, I lend out ships to those who need. People post memes/songs/videos in chat.
---
"Lets undock and see what the fleet looks like. (Proceed to make woah sounds). Omg look at that logi wing, and is that 5+ dictors? As in the wise words of will smith "aww yeah, that's hot". Lets see where our null connection takes us, we're going for big stuff my dudes."
---
Once on the hole as people warp to it, the first ones there usually try go guess where it leads.
---
And my corpies know me for telling them that they're doing a good job and they're the best like every second minute.
---
I love my corp &lt;3
---
It's an elective.
---
For a roam, hit up dotlan and zkill for intel. See what is on in the area and try to bring a counter. 
---
Best tip someone gave me, is getting an order of targets you want to shoot before landing on grid. Makes sense but I was nervous when I first started and just winged it. (not that I am an elite FC) Start getting your order mentally from dscan, so you can call and apply dps asap. Fast dps application seems to win many of the small gang fights that we do. You have a decent list you can just run through it fast too.... \*blackbird is to far, goto next target\*
---
Even with a password manager, make a separate entry for each online account, and use \_different\_ generated passwords on each account, and for the love of Bob use a strong master password or you're totally screwed.   
---
The idea is to have people have a difficult time getting into each account, not just once and then they have access to everything. My heart goes out to people with 15+ accounts, really (not sarcasm, that would be annoying), but security and convenience are almost always mutually exclusive.
---
Eve will die sooner if people's journey to a Titan is shortened. They need some kind of distant goal to keep them engaged in the game. Once they get a Titan, the clock starts ticking in earnest on their departure from the game, whether it's from frustration after losing that Titan stupidly on Day 1 to a gatecamp, or burning out structure timers, or being told to dock them to avoid bad killmails, or whatever.
---
??????
---
Nerd
---
&gt;Singularity 2.0
---
If it meant killing strux in one timer (and less than a week of RF time), no injectors, and make asset safety into a loot mechanic (your stuff has a 20% chance to drop as loot or be destroyed and you can never voluntarily use safety as a move op) then... I would totally start from scratch. If the new server could generate a population quick enough to sustain it, I would have zero qualms about beginning again.
---
Everything you say is so absurdly wrong its actually ridiculous. And you keep mentioning using an orca like that doesn't make any opinion you have invalid.
---
&gt;No they cant but they do have way more range than a rorq assuming your moving to park yourself next to a rock. I think 45k is max? 30 is max with Orca. 
---
With a covetor, you get 48km range at max  skills. That is enough to eat a whole large without moving.
---
&gt;My point is till that rock is gone your afk. A good rock can last you an hour at least. You can MAYBE do that with a retri or mack.
---
You can afk for 8 minutes at a time with retrievers. I'm not sure how much more afk you want.
---
&gt;I feel I have to make it clear its yield isnt an issue. That being said its afk ability is unsurpassed.. And that is my issue with it. You can have any number of rorqs going and just rat the day away.. Barges you need to be 100% there you get literally two minutes till a hulk is full and needs attention. Retri is obviously longer but you lose a decent bit of yield and range. Nvm none of the "good" barges have even acceptable tank, Battleskiff aside for obvious reasons..
---
Yield absolutely is an issue that is the whole point of mining - more isk. Both are afk to the point where there isn't a difference. You don't need tank when you can panic bomber and anything else you just accept your losses and reship because barges only cost ~15m.
---
&gt;It just pisses me off to see so many alts with afk rorqs.. The only way VNIs are worse is they give isk directly instead of flood the material market. I feel like I need one to be competitive. But then you need to be in a block to properly defend it.. Just pushing mpre nullsec than ever.
---
VNIs are objectively better than rorqs now if you didn't already have rorq alts. They are less risk, more isk/sp, and are isk straight to the wallet. The only reason rorqs are good now is because they are the best per-account source of ore, which an alliance needs at an alliance level to produce.
---
With the mechanic changes to combat ceptors, bots, alignment reduction to nullified T3, docked auto linking intel bots, intel program that ping its player base, along with many many other preventive programs. Yes, it’s ridiculous hard unless you have several alts and cloakie camp.
---
Shield beam confessor.   1500 kills with the fit and still rekting face
---
But...but...this video is impossible, all small gang content in EVE is dead, didn't you get the message?
---
Yes. But that limit should be in line with what your group is used to / expecting.
---
If your guys are used to roam for an hour before going back home and you're making them stay out for 2 hours, they might not complain about it but depending on their other plans they might get annoyed.
---
Again, this doesn't matter as much if you're just in frigates and destroyers, but for more valuable and less slippery ships people tend to be hesitant to fly home alone, especially when they're not fit for solo pvp. Also most people don't like "abandoning" the fleet.
---
Even if you get tons of content and feel like everyone's having fun, it doesn't hurt to be like "Hey we've been out for a while, if you want to keep going put an x in fleet" to get some feedback. If you do I suggest you do it like that instead of "if you want to go home x in fleet". People might be less willing to actually say they want to go back because they don't want to "ruin the fun", so make the staying out option the one that requires an action.
---
That's just one of the things you can do to make sure everyone is having fun and makes it more likely that people are going to keep joining your fleets.
---
Thank you very much for this.  My email was pwned.  So I have now switched my EVE accounts to another email address using 2FA.  Thanks to OP for sharing your story and scaring the shit out of me, motivating me to enable 2FA on my email and EVE accounts.
---
Wouldn’t that make them misinformed since they aren’t up to date with the changes?
---
?! what? there is no competition to eve online.
---
Even though I seem to do better with other ships.. the Vigil Fleet Issue is my favourite :)
---
Fit a civilian gun on your cap-&gt; get a spy into enemy alliance-&gt; make all forts pointless forever.
---
Great change.
---
&gt;Is this “unfair” to bitter vets? Yes.
---
What?
---
Not really.  Bitter vets arguably benefit more than anyone else.  For every newbro throwing money at the game to "catch up" there are probably 3 bittervets injecting up a personal rorqual fleet to sustain their multiple titan alts.
---
If you think injectors levelled the playing field between the new and old, you can't even *conceive* of the big picture.

---
hi meowtiger how are you?
---
Avoid being suicide-scrammed and/or bumped, if you can. Else you may lose your ship.
---
To me EVE is like that one girl in your life you love to fuck but hate.  When I'm doing her, it feels good and I am having an awesome time.  Eventually I get bored or the strings that start to get attached to me creep me out.  I then bolt for something fresh and new....only to go threw withdrawals and forgetting about the toxicity of the relationship to hit it again... when am I ever going to learn?
---
The sandbox shifted to a boring state that makes people live and a few people just richer. It's not good for the game.

the only people who got bullied out of the game were people who should never of being playing the game in the first place
---
I did both.  I created a new character to go through the tutorials and relearn how the game works.  Meanwhile, I trained up on the new skills for all the new bling available for me to fly.  If you have some $$ to spend, buy some PLEX and some injectors and skill up the new pilot to do your bidding.  I think I spent $100 on PLEX and accumulated about 3.25m skillpoints in under an hour.
---
nice assumption there bud. been playing since '07 solo/smallgang only.
---
thank god i don't have to make assumptions about you because i know you lost a JF in this brain-dead-proof-JF meta
---
Good luck man, but... Two years ago i've got hacked and lost many accounts, sp stripped, ships and assets sold, etc
---
   Basically CCP response was : trololo u shared ur accounts and ur got cucked by ur friends, this ticket is now closed forever.
---
Personally, as a super casual on and off player I like that skill injectors give me more reason to play the game. The more I play, the more skill injectors I can buy and the more skillful my character will be. Before skill injectors I often had an awkward feeling of wanting to improve my character but there was no way to do that by actually playing the game.
---
That said, I do believe skill injectors are too powerful/abused and bad for the game overall. But I think players should be able to influence their skill points by actually playing the game somehow.
---
you made the right decision capqu, this game is soo bad right now  that i even went and got myself a girlfriend and have quit eve 6 months ago
---
lagacy wow will be a great time
---
you are not alone. EVERYONE has more isk than they know what to do with (in pvp). that's why it's boring and loss is meaningless.
---
The economic troubles are due to certain groups not embracing new mechanics and/or planning to leverage them in some way.  This is not a mechanical failing, it's a strategic one.
---
1061 errors on the STL check. It would be easier to model it again than find and fix the errors I think - a bit too much of a time investment really.
---
Schrodinger's rage quitter
---
ok so im off by 3 KM so everything i say is wrong? idk about you but the belts i've been in can be larger than 50km but ok. oh wait you mine in Nullsec and exclusively nullsec i bet eh?.
---
8 mins max with Retri or 1h max with Rorq.. seems obvious who wins there.
---
my point about yield is its NOT an issue with the Rorq ITS THE BEST, there is literally no reason to use anything else but isk saving.. so i feel like your missing my point. and Exhumers cost way more than 15m.. but i do see your point which is why i dont use Exhumers in Null or even Wh's. MY POINT is there is no reason to use them because the rorq is soooooooo god damn good.
---
my point about Vni's is they are just as AFK able as Rorqs are if not less so. my point here is Rorqs are the SINGLE BEST AFK SOURCE IF INCOME IN THE GAME. there is no reason beyond saving isk to use anything else.
---
you are comparing "flipping a pos" with "destryoing a citadel"...okay bud, whatever you gotta do to make an argument....
---
Technically, you’re right!
---
so they "forgot" the option for negative feedback? suuure, just like daenerys forgot about the iron fleet.
---
I dont like how injectors cause capital proliferation. But bringing skills from lvl4 to lvl 5 means nothing if you fly like shit. I also didnt unlock new ships from it. Ive sinked much time on serenity and tranq to become better. And working to surround myself with ppl who understand how to play so I can look and learn. That was the real investment.
---
What "economic troubles" are you talking about. People just want to have fun playing the game, nobody gives a shit about Goons circlejerking about they krabbed for 2 years to have the largest super fleet in the game. What's even the point of krabbing if the end result of structure warfare is a boring grind and invading doesn't have any value ?
---
Those people want to enjoy the game, not swing the biggest dick.
---
Run lowsec faction warfare plexes to get your feet wet FC'ing. You will run into some really good fights, and it is low stress compared to bigger fleets. You can do it solo or with a few friends too.
---
A good idea would be keeping extractors, but changing skill injectors to act as the drug. Instead of getting the 500k/400k/300k straight up, you get +10 to all attributes until you get the equivalent in trained skill points, then the drug wears off. Obviously the added attribute bonus could be changed in order to make it fair, but I think the idea is solid
---
There is failsafe and arguably the most secure way possible - keeping entire 2FA offline and without having to transfer anything over the internet. With your recovery code being needed only when you lose access to working GAuth, it can easily be stored in secure location (a safe or something) without other passwords - so keeping the "something you have" aspect of 2FA (compared to "something you know" for password). No tech yet can remotely read printed content from inside of a safe.
---
I plan on 3D printing a Nyx soon. All of the models exist in the files and someone went through and converted them all to SLT files.
---
See, this is exactly what I'm talking about not embracing new mechanics (or not understanding the increased importance of existing mechanics after certain expansions).  Your post basically says "if it's not space shooties it's irrelevant", completely disregarding large swaths of the game.
---
I would argue that people like you who take a narrow view of the game instead of looking at it holistically are just as much of a problem than the very real stagnation caused by super/capital/structure proliferation.
---
Never noticed them before.. won't notice their absence.. .meh.
---
hang in there, it will be alright in the end. but yeah, dont use weak email passwords :)
---
Learn to delegate, and don't rely on individual people to do too many things at once as it leads to task saturation and mistakes (this goes for yourself as well).
---
When the action starts coming (preferably before it comes) take a moment to think and figure out a plan or something resembling a plan. It doesn't need to be perfect, but you should have something you can work with and towards. Try to dictate the terms of your enagagement rather than having them forced upon you.
---
Welping a fleet is perfectly fine so long as you learn from what went wrong. Welping multiple fleets is fine so long as you welp them for different reasons. An expert is somebody who has made all the mistakes.
---
Try to timebox your fleets - only some masochists enjoy a 3 hour grind with no or limited content. This goes back to having a goal in mind.
---
Man it's true, gimme ur shit. You won't need it anyway considering you clearly lack ability to assess the situation. Why listen to people on a forum that's clearly designed for propaganda/trolling? You will not receive objective discussion here. Experience eve for yourself.
---
No, supers and titans are to weak, the problem is that we are missing something like 5 ship classes between between a dread and a titan
---
It's more of Google going with "2FA and 2FA recovery is offline, and you should keep it offline to stay safe". Just put restore codes wherever you keep whatever important documents (safe etc.) - you need it in one and only case of restoring authenticator.
---
Rocket Manticore!? Let me get my pyfa out.
---
Check out authy
---
Another solid track, keep em comin
---
eat my poop
---
hey man i'm good
---
the new doner restaurant across from my building is pretty dope but i'm gonna get v fat if i eat there much more
---
No u
---
EVEEE &lt;3333
---
Yep the real problem will be when EVE isn't dying 😂
---
You don't flip a POS, you destroy a POS. You flipped a station/outpost. Please stop proving your ignorance.
---
Dude i know that feel. Theres a go-to Kurdish doner place here thats so damn good, but so damn unhealthy.
---
You don't have to go omega to have fun with eve. That said though, if you're going real money, sub until you can afford to easily plex every month (at least easy make double price).
---
How much isk a day are you earning and how many hours does it take?.
---
I have limited time to play, I find tge monthly sub more valuable because then I csn just play and not stress attempting to get the isk to plex.
---
In your google security settings I believe you can configure which 2fa methods you want to use.
---
there's 0 ability for CCP to solve the core issue, the social aspect
---
goons/legacy are best buddies and will forever grrPL for past events, even if they get split up in game there's no changing that they'll never break up as a coalition
---
We always considered you a group that punched above its size.
---
Good luck with whatever you choose to do next.
---
i have an old tablet that i keep in a draw at home it has all my account linked to a google auth app on there.
---
I don't lose tech3 often enough to care about it.
---
Why would people want to "embrace new mechanics" (aka krab super hard). It's not providing more fun fights it's just providing the ability to win a battle with just more supers every 6 months.
---
How is that fun gameplay for people who want to shoot spaceships.
---
i love it too! station containers upon containers, all the stuff tidy and dusted :)
---
At this point I’d say no
---
The only thing new here is who created the post, please sit down
---
As of recent, the Ishkur. Rote tends to fly blingy "fuck off" kitey ships, so to keep up (since I have limited budget and I tend to explode a lot more often than others) it's probably the cheapest and most efficient ship for it's price tag I can use. Lower dps, but for dicey engagements i can sling drones and ruuuun. Also looks pretty good with the yellow skin on it :)
---
Just to be sure it's your last time, you should send me all your isk  :)
---
Kite stratios look sexy and once I'm a lil more comfortable running nano shit I'm buying a pile of them.
---
Nyx
---
Cyclones are fun
---
a common misconception perpetuated by intentionally not stating the whole truth.
---
Nothing new in your reply.
---
TUNNEL SNAKES RULE! Also for horde, you're welcome.
---
My girlfriend was in a similar situation, they got into her email, got to her Eve accounts through there and stripped assets / sp etc.  
---
CCPs massive downfall is lack of communication with the affected party. That being said they did resolve the issue and got my GF back all her stuff. But it did take over 2 months.  
---
Not the answer you want i'm sure but CCP are usually on point and will fix it eventually.
---
Approximately a million ISK an hour
---
Sure :) 7 b a hour is “hard to do” lolz 😂
---
Applies to explorers without cloak delay
---
Let's assume you're retarded and don't use cans or DSTs for cap boosters, you can carry ~115 + 12 loaded boosters. Let's assume you boost up twice every time the super actually shoots you, once every 20 seconds. It will take ~20 minutes to consume all those boosters. Now let's just deploy my Impel and give me another 20 minutes whenever I feel like it.
---
Think of eve as a hobby. Spend according to your hobby budget. 
---
No one can really answer those questions for you.
---
Gotta need shortcuts to pump those DD's skills to level 5
---
So a bit over 400 hours of play before you can plex for a month.
---
I would rather pay and keep the isk
---
Funny as hell-  Eve Onion is great.
---
As a goon, I support this plan.
---
was waiting for this for a while ;)
---
Why do you think EVE is in such a great condition right now?
---
Hey, whatever works for you.
---
Just sayin from my personal experience and those that i fly with, ejecting to save skillpoints became much less of an issue since Injectors were introduce, and our ships were expensive enough  (and we were rich enough) that an extra bill for a ship we don't lose very often didn't really matter.
---
So 300+ hours of plat to plex for a month.
---
I would rather keep the isk and pay cash for that mlnth.
---
then there's the concept of Ship Replacement Programs which large alliances run, in which you get your ship (or just the hull) replaced if you lost it in an alliance fleet op.   
---
This way your morale is safe.
---
&gt;You probably didn’t play eve back when a super fleet could move across the entire galaxy in less than an hour...maybe less than 30 mins.
---
I don't think Jump Fatigue actually went far enough. 
---
Before you down-vote me, here me out...
---
It was neither a step forward, or a step backward. I think it was a step to the side. Fatigue did indeed prevent entire fleets from sprinting across the galaxy. But I think the fundamental problem is moving massed fleets with precision and uniformity. 
---
Pre-Fatigue, the process of 'sprinting across the galaxy' could basically be summarised as this;
---
1. Jump (as fast as a session-change allows),
---
2. Cap-Chain (or [cap-fit to troll Black Legion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCZ5Bo8EJZ0)),
---
3. Repeat.
---
Now, in the era of Fatigue; 
---
2. Wait on the red jump-timer,
---
The first leg -- the first jump -- is exactly the same. Jump Fatigue makes the implied statement that jump-drive mechanics are fine unless you rapidly chain them. I disagree with that statement. The mechanics themselves are bad, and Fatigue only prevents a group from spamming it to great effect. 
---
Okay, now down-vote me.
---
Cyno's need better counterplay options.
---
The current Inhibitor takes too long to online, and too weak to last on the grids you'd generally use them on.  It takes a few seconds for a person to recognize the threat, then click cyno vs 1 minute online time of the Inhibitor. The first one will win every time, and in comes the capital blob. The End.
---
Just like we can stop warping with a disruptor, MWD and MJD with a Scram, stasis web for conventional movement... we need a targetable module that will counterplay the Cyno.
---
Might be a good time to quit EvE, seems like the universe demands it...
---
Ok. But how does going Omega help with earning more ISK? Are the story rates different for Omega users or something or is it just the litany of ships I have at my disposal that makes it easier to do so?
---
I also love cyclones, I've been running them in small gangs and they're super fun.
---
For me the time to look and learn to stop flying like shit is also the real investment.
---
Capital proliferation is only one of the effects. The other is people having a perfectly skilled ship and not knowing what to do with it. If you got memed for low dmg on kills, thats not nice, but if that is the only measurement that counts in your group I would probably have left.
---
Flying with less than 5 skills has taught me many things that made flying those ships with all 5 a lot easier.
---
Solo HAMs, no paint, and no crash? Don't assault frig gangs mess you up hard?
---
500 DPS cold is abysmal?
---
Yes. Get into a Corp you get along with and enjoy.
---
It's not worth it, the game is actively dying since the beginning of this year, trade hubs are dying out, alliances dissolving, now it's officially too late to start, so just go play some other game...
---
Pretty much how I see it too
---
As opposed to wimping out on timers when they can't guarantee numerical advantage even when we're flying crappier boats?
---
So many words for what amounts to a bad shit post.  Not a good shitpost.  Just bad all around.
---
what is a "doner" place?
---
Best way to help? Is to show the door market "Exit", game's dead, goons got what they wanted for decades...
---
with drones?  am I wrong for thinking thats low?
---
&gt; After Phoebe, I unsubbed my carrier accounts and uninstalled the launcher from my computer, so where are my rewards? 1,250,000 skillpoints is huge!
---
so good
---
Mmm. It's hard to say, my love in eve is as ever growing as my love IRL.
---
My first love was definitely the Thrasher and I still love that ship today. The Hecate is its successor.
---
For solo pvp right now I have to give it to the Kestrel. Such a versatile ship.
---
For small gangs it's really a tossup. I like brawly gangs, but I'm really starting to enjoy learning nano cruisers. After 7 years. Yeah I know. Too much brawling probably caused some brain damage lol. Still I think right now I gotta give it to the Cyclone.
---
For fleet PVP? MORE CYCLO nah Cynabal :)
---
Best one yet
---
Provi is desperate for things to be proud of.
---
Don't...
---
You might find it really fun to go camp a reinforcement route to a null bloc fight if you're able. Those are not always going to be on your schedule, but the prep work is simple: make a friend or two in different alliances by just poking some of their fcs on discord offering to go camp their enemies' routes to major fights and pick off stragglers. Hit some guys up on discord and see who's willing to play with you.
---
Given how bad your post is, I think it's actually a fair question.
---
And by dps to isk measure, the Brutix beats the drekavac for random roams.
---
Because provi is bad and should feel bad?
---
I genuinely suspect they don't know how sov works considering how often we can go entosis with little to no opposition.
---
How about a 30min damage cap, too?
---
I like the orthrus for its looks but the typhoon is awesome, with insurance it's very cheap and you can take on gangs
---
I hope everything turns out in your favor.
---
Stop doing whatever you are trying to do
---
go blops with Masl noob, no quitting ((
---
when you're so much of a krab you have to share a story about how you almost lost your ship to disconnects
---
&gt;Quant mentions that the game design and economy changes after skill trading and plex is very complicated due to the monetary exchange involved. Such as **players buying supercapitals and the skills** and then **it being nerfed** for the sake of a **healthier** game.
---
CSM 12 summit II minutes.
---
Sounds great, right?
---
Keep doing whatever you are trying to do
---
If you are currently satisfied and have fun, don't do it right now. If not or if later you feel limited by the alpha state, then I suggest you to take the "meteo pack", for \~15$ you get a month of omega + 110 PLEX + a few skins.  See if you feel the difference or not and if you find it worth it.
---
Thats right
---
Haha! Loved the festival launcher trasher!
---
Your logi wing did a great job.  Good use of RR on the frigs too.  All your fleets involving RR could have been greatly aided by just one command dessy with boosts but you guys obviously did fine without.
---
I saw you way overshoot targets multiple times by overuse of your MWD.  Next time, manually adjust speed using the slidebar below your capacitor.
---
Glad to see Gallente FW space is alive and thriving.
---
Question: did any of your Deacon pilots have trouble with neuts?  We have been using Thalias with AB/cap booster/cap battery to combat that. Just wanted to check if your operational experience agrees with that or not.
---
Overall, great vid!
---
If you aren’t having fun leave. I will however keep having fun in eve as I have been for the past 5 months since I came back. There is more to eve than just big bloc warfare. You are just too lazy to find it.
---
Can't really blame you. First thing most people do in Eve is turn off the audio.
---
I got a million SP on two accounts from the event. I'm pretty happy about it.
---
i had a fantastic time on my daddy-daughter date last night. we went to the matinee showing of secret life of pets 2 and then had dinner at her favorite restaurant. we usually go to the rc track but daddy didn't fix the traxxas slash vxl she wrecked last week. she makes being a dad pretty cool. i &lt;3 u pickle!
---

multiple phones, and pc support.
---
Also, removing 2fa isn't hard.  Had to do it when I got back into EVE.  Just sent them a picture of my ID.
---
It's pretty good for a t1 bc that's built for speed, tank, and utility, and that damage applies out past point range. You can kite blaster brawlers and whatnot. This fit even runs its own RD, you're going almost 3k heated.
---
The fit we run with a 3rd BCS can pull almost 700 with rage, in a small gang. I consider that quite good for what they are. Yeah hecates hit about as hard, but our hecates are made of paper by comparison.
---
That fleet fight should have resulted in a lot of dead rattles. How many booshes did they actually have?
---
Alpha earnings won't be enough to plex unless you play close to burnout levels, but Omega earnings will be. 
---
So just get Omega for one month, gain access to higher-income activities and skills, then use THOSE earnings to plex for the next month. Much more sustainable.
---
I said gf and complimented yall in local for a well executed trap.
---
I guess nice job on looking like a clown on reddit now too.
---
Did people really think a group like SkillU would actually last a really long time? Seemed more like a red overlord fast rise and fall....maybe i am wrong. Idk.
---
&gt; Why would people want to "embrace new mechanics"
---
Because that's how literally every video game with expansions has worked, ever.  Why is Eve different? Why do you expect the game to stay the same even when the economy changes and people amass more wealth over time?
---
a restaurant that primarily serves doner kebabs (or shawarma, same thing different name based on the locality). its more prevalent in Europe than the US or Canada. In the US the equivalent would be like a mom and pop taco shop or pizza joint - the place that's greasy as fuck, the grandma is making the dough in the back, the dad's the main cook, and the mom's the waitress. There's a nice thick layer of grease on the walls, and ethnic music is playing in the background. That's how you know it's good.
---
Rorqs are fine. It's excavators that are the issue.
---
Today on: BBTB makes reddit mad again.
---
Fuck yes it is, buying plex with isk is aids, play the whole game the way it's meant to be played and sub. It's not very much money. I personally only sub one account and don't really feel like I'm missing fun.
---
Comment deserves 100 upvotes.
---
Ships, safety like cloaking and interceptors, activities like Planetary Production.
---
I remember seeing a few storks but CVA doesn't seem to teach their command destroyer pilots very well.
---
I can't stand plexing even pulling 120m/hr.
---
&gt;ok so im off by 3 KM so everything i say is wrong? idk about you but the belts i've been in can be larger than 50km but ok. oh wait you mine in Nullsec and exclusively nullsec i bet eh?.
---
Yes every large anom is able to be mined in a 48km bubble. Nobody gives a shit about highsec mining besides moons, which we aren't talking about.
---
&gt;8 mins max with Retri or 1h max with Rorq.. seems obvious who wins there.
---
Anything past 5 mins is irrelevant since you are going to be at the computer anyways.
---
&gt;my point about yield is its NOT an issue with the Rorq ITS THE BEST, there is literally no reason to use anything else 
---
How about the fact that I can get 4-5 barges fully skilled and ready to be extracted for the cost of a single rorq *character*. Add in the fit and I can bring in another 2 barges. 
---
&gt;my point about Vni's is they are just as AFK able as Rorqs are if not less so. my point here is Rorqs are the SINGLE BEST AFK SOURCE IF INCOME IN THE GAME. there is no reason beyond saving isk to use anything else.
---
The whole point of this is to make isk, so saving is is absolutely a factor. Especially when you consider that past 5 or 6 rorqs you have the distinct possibility of losing drones en masse, which further eats into your profits.
---
o7 friend
---
this i can mostly agree with as Excav's are what gives them the afk ability that they have.
---
but Panic..?
---
I like my submarines like how I like my women.   As far away from me as possible.
---
&gt;me
---
he's too busy theorycrafting fits for supercapital noctis to be bothered with that lark now
---
How much do you value your time in real life?
---
&gt; Why do you expect the game to stay the same even when the economy changes and people amass more wealth over time?
---
Because shooting spaceships is more fun than krabbing ?
---
Hi, thanks for the feedback!
---
Our logi pilots really did well, I have no idea how our damaviks didn't get instantly deleted when the phoenix+phoon landed on grid, as they only have about 7k ehp.. I suppose we were lucky they forgot the target painters that day. We're looking at command dessies at the moment, it's definitely something we lack currently.
---
The overshooting in the damavik fight was actually me calling for us to get range - we scouted 2 rapiers and a few leshaks in Villore and they seemed to be headed our way. Half the fleet was hard tackled +fully capped out by the bhaal + geddon though so we stayed in the fight. We ended up bailing later in the fight when reinforcements landed, but we had killed plenty by then.
---
For the Deacons - the main issue they reported was getting jammed consistently by a single flight of jam drones from the Algos (I assume?) - for cap they were mostly okay, they had a cap booster fitted and were orbiting at 20km+ to mitigate neuting pressure. We're still quite new to using them so it's something I'll keep an eye on for sure!
---
A lot. I'm currently studying so my day is relatively hectic and can just pull out a few hours a day to play.
---
I didnt get memed at all. How do you get to thinking that might be the only measurement? If they were that retarded they wouldnt have achieved what they did.
---
It was my own decision to skill up and try to tag along these very skilled players. I was not a good fit for that alliance so it made sense to make an effort to improve.
---
Obviously upping skills was also very much so fc can calculate his fleet strength correctly.
---
500MN Oracle w/Pulses flys 5k+ M/S cold, Scorch and MJD.  Fly straight my friend, and as anything gets within 35km MJD 100 out.  Doesn't kill anything unless they purposely try to fly up your tailpipe, fit is very tight but you get 2-4 minutes at full speed depending on if your shooting a lot or not.  It's just,... fun
---
Good shit. Did the rattles have a lot of good booshes then? I assume so. With those numbers that should have been a helldunk.
---
Skill Injectors, rorqs, citadels. If it wasn’t goons left alone to krab, it would be someone else. However to goons credit, they exploited these poorly implemented updates better than anyone else. When is Eve Classic coming out?
---
&gt;but Panic..?
---
A nerf to panic is mostly a nerf to rorqs that don't mine underneath an overbearing umbrella.  Umbrella rorqs will generally be fine, rorqs in places where it takes some time to get a response will not.
---
I have not logged in since october of last year, simply cant :( and wont be able to come back for some time yet. What was the 16th aniv reward like a Marshal or something?
---
You and me both or I’ll be two sheets to the wind. I’m a light weight.
---
Wait. So you are telling me planetary production is an Omega only activity!
---
Sorry to see you guys go. All I remember is how toxic your members are though, it's really a shock that you went this long! Your biggest mistake was taking all of insmother resulting in a never ending fozzie sov nightmare. Should of left Tri alone and you would still be farming each other for content
---
People finally realized that station is shit to undock from and "fuck it, Jita isn't that far away"
---
1) limit ore belt respawn times. 
---
2) remove compression - e.g. force rorqs to do something other than hit a single button every 40 minutes. 
---
3) change panic button to something similar to ADC
---
4) change cyno mechanics 
---
But meh, the problem isn't rorqs, but rather that there is no reason to attack and take over additional sov.  More and cheaper ships isn't a bad thing, but havn't no reason to use them is.
---
07
---
You should see all the ones who complained about cancelling because the Facebook page changed their logo to have a rainbow background.
---
The citadel delivery thing might have forced this
---
Wh as well, this sounds like my attitude during a fleet, unfortunately I only have a few people in the fleet so keeping them entertained is also a requirement I didn’t know about as a Fc.
---
1.5m sp, skins, some rare ammo and boosters, and lore items.
---
It truly is a beautiful game. I still can't get over how cool the armor repping animations are on my Dominix.
---
as much as i can agree we need to stop using this as an excuse to have an overpowered mechanic.
---
anyone with the balls to mine one without an umbrella is either filthy rich or really dumb.. because the cost involved isn't worth doing it without the umbrella.
---
You can make your toes apply.
---
Don't think less delay is worth it. I'd rather fly a kestrel or astero.
---
How do you prioritize ships from Dscan? Or are you looking for tiers of threat? For my gang I would try and get rid of ewar/neut threat before anything else
---
Really? How does it work?
---
Yeah i agree with a lot of the points. Eve is not what it used to be but there is content out there and things to do. Sitting around crying about it isn't going to create any experiences or content for yourself, and we have heard this break down a million times.
---
Thats cool, my favorite ccp event that was ever done was the yule lads. That one was hilarious and fantastic. I miss that ccp ;(

I have some interest in trying a nomadic play style on a few accounts, riding the C5 highway from wormhole to wormhole. 
---
What’s my best way to get into a c5 hole (starting from highsec) given that I don’t really care which one? Should I just go into whatever low-class hole I come across and then explore connections from there, or is there a better way?
---
Focused =Insert damage type= bomb.
---
We already got focused void bombs, just add focused =damage= bomb and we should be good?

The Artist: https://theobliviousowl.artstation.com/
---
I had the idea based on some in game events and the formation of a new player group. The creation process was a fantastic experience, I hope I get inspired to make something again.
---
I have a soft spot for the Enyo. First T2 ship I ever flew. The tank and amount of DPS it can put out when blaster-fit seemed insane to me! I still love to fly it, it feels like it can do everything well.
---
so we pretty much agree then. altho i forgot to mention Ore respawn as being an issue. But i still see no reason to use anything other than a rorq for mining assuming you can afford more than one.
---
Nice PVE ship too.
---
Sucks to read, and I'm sorry you are going through this.  It's such an invasion of your privacy that I think your EVE accounts, albeit dear to you, might be the least of your concerns... 
---
What makes this even more annoying is that the hacking of your EVE account is driven by demand for RMT goods in EVE. So your fellow capsuleers buying ISK at discounted rates from turdburglars on the internet (Yeah I'm looking at you, a-few-hackers-I-literally-know-by-name).
---
"Just fight my 40k man blob with your 1200 dudes, if not you're a coward!"
---
That’s actually something I need to think about in the future, I tend to go for about 1-2 hrs depending on if our chain is scanned down or not. If it is I devote the whole time to the roam. 
---
What audio cues do you listen for as an FC for when the group wants to head back but doesn’t want to go solo home?
---
I genuinely can't remember if we had booshers on our side. We did have a logi chain close by but you'd have to find a fleet report.
---
I resubbed pretty recently. Been having fun solo. The last couple times I wound up in small corps too early and then I felt obligated to play, which immediately made logging in not fun.
---
They make too much, and require too little manual input.
---
Supercap proliferation + uber miners + injectors = Whale heaven, game getting boring fast...
---
&gt; A nerf to panic is mostly a nerf to rorqs that don't mine underneath an overbearing umbrella
---
Rorqs that don't mine under an umbrella are likely to die if caught anyway. Panic just enables rorqs under umbrellas to mine with 0 risk.
---
I'm all for skill injecting. The issue I have with it is it's impact on the economy.
---
My solution would be to keep it purely as a plex sink. Put "skill points" on the NES, but remove injectors/extractors, allowing new bros to catch up to veterans, improve retention, while halting all the negative impacts to the game.
---
Spend money on skill points and apply them poorly? Too bad. Buy more. CCP's monetization dept fucked up by allowing extractors.
---
Skill farms are already not profitable due to plex skyrocketing. Literally the only people who will complain are RMTers.
---
lol bruh this is long gone. Game is done.
---
That’s actually how I started FC’ing, and it was awesome. My group trust me for the most part because of those roams. But I still manage to make tons of mistakes in Target priority, it’s a learning lesson every time. I’m going to start recording comma/video to also review.
---
Thanks so much, this is exactly what I was looking for. I'm not attached to those old characters at all because I honestly dont remember what I was doing with them. This would put me ahead of both characters ASAP right?
---

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c)
---
Because obviously the only way to fight the goons is all or nothing. Eve obviously doesn't allow for gorilla warfare or espionage or any other gameplay. /S
---
It's obvious why your alliance has failed so incredibly.
---
Your not arguing on fair ground you keep moving the posts so to speak.
---
Cost saving isnt a facto when your looking for te best of the best. Its like running l4 missions in a maurader. Why are you gunna be there in 5 mins? And barges can die to ratts if left afk.. Your ignoring my points..
---
Have a good day.
---
Lol US TZ...
---
I can smell the shit from NC. and PL's trousers.
---
You should be making more, what you doing?
---
Majority of trade, industry and mining is omega locked.
---
Phantasm. Beautiful and deformed at the same time. Powerful brawler when fit correctly
---
IMO mining need to be revamped and need to be more of a minigame you can't multibox (easily). I would be fine at excavators prive to go lower if rorqual would not be as easily multiboxed.
---
Oh
---
at least we agree lol
---
Sounds like I should do some transporting or something to get used to the game again. It's the pvp of this game that keeps drawing me back in. It's daunting to start over again but I can't find another game that scratches the same itch.
---
Someone plz answere my questions
---
The player base itself has to take some responsibility for blobbing up and making half of Eve blue to one another. Personally I can’t think of anything more boring then being surrounded by blues. People should try and make sure they always have at least one neutral on their doorstep they can have some friction with.
---
I was told guerilla warfare in Delve was irrelevant, was I lied to?
---
My alliance is just fine btw
---
I have a venture and currently mining pyroxeres and I am probably making more. I just gave a rough estimate
---
wait I'm curious you posted about a dread killing a drek? 
---
if it was a solid 1v1 I wouldn't care but it just looks like a shit comparison that you couldn't kill a drek with what you fielded solo
---
Any other similar games you suggest? I'm open to anything that has space exploration and good pvp
---
&gt; Rorqs that don't mine under an umbrella are likely to die if caught anyway.
---
Agreed, but there are varying levels of what constitutes an umbrella.  During the leadup to the previous northern war, there were plenty of times that a GotG rorq would've died to SIGs were it not for the time panic allowed for a response fleet to be assembled.  
---
That's what I'm saying -- it allowed groups that don't have a 100% uptime, good-to-go response umbrella the time to put together a credible response.
---
My typical plan revolves around WH chain scanned down, rage roll the NS static till we have a nice pocket,  
---
I try to do this before the fleet starts so we can spend more time hunting than sitting around, however that’s not always optimal. What is your typical goal to set for a fleet?
---
This is useful thanks, I'm gonna check out those videos now
---
Time was a balance factor in eve, and something every player had to contend with that. 
---
CCP shit on that, and every loyal player who had stuck with the game over the years.
---
Fuck you and every new player, the game would have been better off dying than accommodating the instant gratification generation.
---
That actually sounds like a good plan to do when everyone wants to relax and pew, thanks for that idea.
---
I think it is.       I pay for my accounts.   
---
There is nothing wrong with playing on an alpha account.      Upgrading your account just gives you more options, it’s still up to you to find the fun.
---
Goons seem down for content every time I’ve seen them so far. I was flying a week old toon in an atron in FW and could barely get a fight with all the mission runners. Always had good experiences with goons as they’ll fight. Not sure on the political meta of it all.
---
IMO yes - the grind is boring enough without having to do it to pay for a sub as well.
---
Looks pretty sick. How much was the total bill?
---
i can agree but i feel Supply would be an issue at that point tho. we essentially rely on multiboxing to get the ore we need. hell i run 5 toons for mining but im no rorq pilot. the issue is how easily its done.. multiboxing when you have to attend to everything every few seconds is wildly different than park and forget for 2 hours.. which is what the rorq essentially does.
---
Yea dude, I do the ratting in there as well. Sure it's 7b per hour. 
---
Once you have rolled enough to find a c6 with 10+ sites   
---
Once you have secured the target hole by rolling  
---
Once you managed to not get rolled in by people and actually make out with the things.   
---
Once you not get randomly evicted before you managed to haul out the shit or, even worse, while you haul out the shit.   
---
Once you get your 4-th-5th leshak alt in its 2b leshak. 
---
Whereas the numbers for ns/abyssal rating mean that if you play for an hour, with a single account, that's what you get (barring people ratting in unsafe Ns but that's their problem).   
---
why the butthurtism? are you trying to sell real estate in anoikis or what?
---
The only issue I have with this is it still encourages SP farming, although that's not as big a deal as the instantaneous satisfaction of today's injectors. 
---
I'd still be down with your approach as people would still buy stuff from CCP without allowing for instant perfect characters.
---
Fuck thrashers. Also fuck hitting your MWD at the wrong moment. Fucking sig bloom. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/64579311/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/64579311/)
---
Show me where the naughty Goon touched you.
---
Nice!
---
It depends what you want out of eve.
---
If you want to see massive battles, flashing lights and big explosions. A corp like Brave/Horde/Karma would be perfect. They will direct you to train what you need to, however there focus will be into making you into a line member. 
---
If you want to learn the game your own way, go solo, learn by dying, be polite and respectful and you'll end up with friends even if you don't want them :)
---
&gt;Today on: BBTB makes himself look like an idiot again.
---
Maybe you guys can use the isk from the mining to replace the billions in machs and cerbs you lost last night trying to act like you are any good at this game right?
---
Effect is not instant it has to reach the target. It acts just like a Sabre bubble so yes it prevents warp and jump
---
$50 USD. Pretty dope for all the time and effort which went into it. I was very particular about the details.
---
i'm sorry have you actually played the game?
---
They are just taking some time to prepare their bodies for WoW Classic
---
Ah sheet. I didn't see who posted it lol
---
Lmao thinking CCP will return any of your shit, when they can't be arsed to read "HELP I BEEN HACKED" mails for 5+ days
---
p.s. hey are you axos v?
---
It would be nice to see more interactive mining. What if they made it a mini game style where if you wanted you could afk but if you interacted with the mini game your yields were higher or you got better ore?
---
i think you should go back to Eve Uni and learn about fitting.
---
What a controversial stance.  Can't wait to read your next post detailing how "Breathing is Good, Change my Mind".
---
How long the effect last?
---
Also what about the ecm?
---
That's the joke.
---
Could this "problem" be solved by tying the use of a super-capitals to a leadership skill requirement?  Such as, the number of super-capitals that can be in a fleet is associated to the level of a skill the Fleet Commander has?  Or limit the size of fleets the way drones are limited on particular ships, using bandwidth.  The fleet skills increase the bandwidth a fleet has.  Make the skill a high rank skill where it would be cost in-effective to pump injectors into it.  However make the skill available to all pilots trained to level 1?  Each ship in a fleet dips into the available bandwidth.  In other words, fleet composition is limited by the available bandwidth.  Available bandwidth is limited by a skill gate.  The skill gate takes millions of skill points to train.
---
What prevents an alliance from suiting up dozens of fleets?  Assign a bandwidth to the each system.  Allow that bandwidth to be increased and decreased at will by using a deploy-able structure (according to the size of that system).  The structure requires a fueling agent to increase the bandwidth, the more bandwidth the more the fueling agent is required.  Allow that structure to be hacked using exploration skills to flip the bit of a system using covert operations fleets.
---
Require titans to be only usable as part of a player owned corporation.  The number of titans a corporation can sustain is limited to the available bandwidth of the corporation CEO - tied to a corporation management skill.  This would directly cause the cost of producing titans to scale.  As bandwidth decreases, the resource cost to produce titans (and other supers) increases (exponentially).  However that scale is dynamic.  If a titan is destroyed, bandwidth suddenly increases, lowering the requirements to build the titan (to allow for reasonable replacement time).
---
Require super caps to be tethered when not in use.  Create a mechanic that provides sub cap fleets to deploy an object in space to jam the tethering device, preventing the super from un-tethering.  This would require an attacking fleet to maintain an offensive and defensive posture.  As the use of titans and their bridges can be denied by small gang / small fleet tactics.  Require that tethering device to be "hacked" in order to be disabled to allow titans to un-tether.
---
I'm sure there are lot of holes in these suggestions, but I think ultimately what needs to happen is there needs to be a correlation and limitation to fleet size and fleet composition.  Tying this to some sort of bandwidth mechanism could resolve this.  Putting other mitigating mechanics into the game that require corporations and alliances to maintain an offensive and defensive posture at all times (splitting the fleet) could help.  Introducing mechanics that introduce a scaling mechanism ensuring fleets scale like a pyramid instead of an upside down pyramid would be helpful.
---
I agree N+1 is fun to some but ruins the game for others.  Finding a solution that is equitable but still makes it a worthwhile goal to obtain the status of a super cap pilot will be a delicate effort.
---
There are a few things that can be done to fix the issues presented in the current meta however it would require ignoring a large segement of the player base kicking in screaming:
---
1. Large nerfs to Titans/Supers/Fax. These are the tools that make fighting against the blob literally impossible, if these ships are nerfed in significant ways (dmg/ehp/capabilities) it would open the door to more players being able to consider fighting goons.  The cat is out the bag on these when it comes to proliferation, they are here no amount of changes to resource allocation will change that so the only other option is to nerf them in real terms. 
---
2. Nerfs to medium upwell structures these things cost 500mil and should not be that hard to kill for the price (open the final timer vulnerability window so that the defender does not control the EXACT 15min the final timer will come out, increase the damage cap so that these things can be reffed in 10-12min) This is less of a problem with large structures as at least they incur some isk cost but they should be looked at as well. 
---
3. Introduce some form or resource depletion and force larger groups to de-centralize. By forcing de-centralization defenders are less able to mega blob their entire coalition on attackers within 1min. This can come in the form of a new algorithim or the easier approach of just increasing respawn timers. 
---
4. Add 15min blue time and 2min red to JB's. They are too powerful currently and allow even easier defense of mega blobs. 2min red timer would add risk when jumping through preventing a quick reapproach and would also prevent caps from using ansiblex and immediately jumping. (would not have a significant impact on fleet movement). 
---
Implementing the above changes would not fix the game over night but would at least be a step in the right direction making eve more dangerous even for the mega blobs.
---
ty
---
And this was published by CCP and not by someone that organised the information somehow?
---
Yeah I'm slow minded, I just noticed who posted it
---
&gt;Man that’s overly salty for a shitpost
---
As a new player, injectors have been 100% worth using. I just set a budget each month, now that I've finished a lot of core skills I mainly just inject into new ship types (still barely even touching battleships lol) and remapped and used implants to speed up finishing core skills. Injecting into ship types feels much more worth since it's often not even practical using a new hull without training that ship skill to 4, and even then there are also the tech 2 ships that require 5.
---
why do you keep giving yourself awards you fucking autist?
---
just came back from a two year hiatus last week, and it turns out that a big group of people from my favorite old corp also came back in the past month.  it's just like old times, flying around, exploding others and being exploded, but with even less pressure to be good because we're all so rusty!
---
also, things are coming back faster than i was worried they would, which is nice.
---
eve may be dying, but it's certainly not dead.
---
Perspective. You see 'lol dumb gon' and I see bill making a low effort shitpost.

Isn't that what the RLML launchers in the gila is for? I saw his Stratios video and was considering trying it out, but it's less DPS and more expensive than a Gila so was having a hard time justifying it.
---

---

---
&gt;Vote with your wallet!
---
Mr 500 Euros on Injectors down there just cancelled you out.
---
&gt;The player base itself has to take some responsibility 
---
Nah.  If CCP incentivizes boring gameplay, we're going to get boring gameplay.  "The playerbase can fix it by playing sub-optimally" is just magical thinking.
---
idk it's pretty hard to judge at least with my guys. I don't really have a good answer to that.
---
But I know from myself when I'm just a fleet member that by the time I start asking "hey FC how long are we going to stay out" the fleet has already been going on 30 minutes too long. And I think many people are like that, because everyone wants to be nice to their FCs.
---
Maybe it's because I'm a scrubby lowsec pirate, but I have yet to understand the appeal of a Titan. I get it's useful for actual wars, but for me it's so rarely used it's not even on my list of things to train into. Hell, I'm just working on finishing core-ish skills (rigging, compensation, and ewar) and maxing skills for some frigates atm. Can't beat going after pirate frigates and even destroyers with a Comet.
---
im just glad that this week is coming to an end
---
helo how is waffles :D
---
Seeing as how GSF is not interested in taking space, your idea that they will take over is laughable. Your idea that Test will greatly expand is also laughable.
---
Fuck it, your entire post is laughable.
---
Keep going, content creates content. When I first started in my corp my timezone was very quiet, so at first we were us 2-3 wormholers against all of Nullsec. 
---
As time went on more and more people joined, the timezone im in is picking up. (Of course during weekends timezones mingle more). It'll happen to you, just keep going. :)
---
From what I hear, the appeal of a Titan is the fact that all your opponents have one.
---
You mean it's stupid to pre-order anything?
---
an ADC would do anything different? with the exception of giving 200 man bomber fleets an actual target while "panicking" and be able to kill a Rorq as opposed to just wait out the timer.
---
i dont like the excuse of it hurts the little guy its a straw man argument because 80% of the player base is in nullsec.  nerf to panic wont effect Wh users that have a fleet around. it would literally only effect the loan renter out in nullsec but even then most of the time unless they have dudes sitting around THERE WONT BE A FLEET in 5 mins anyways.. any fleet that can put a good Rorq into panic should be able to kill it. the fact they have to wait out 5 mins timer is cheese and limits the engagement profile of the Rorq as a whole you can ONLY ENGAGE if you have 50 lokis or bombers or something on stand by. they are so strong with panic and tank any 5-10 man fleet literally can't do shit. they are just as bad as cap injecting Ninazu's in Wh space.
---
Mine don't ;\^)
---
At most I've seen a handful of dreads and the occasional carrier.
---
SO BRAVE
---
Make Titans/supers cost way more to build.  Large alliances can't SRP that so will be more hesitant to deploy the super/titan mass.  Make moving them cost way more as well.  Yes it would be harder for newbies to get and use but it would also make the big boys more hesitant to use them in any way outside of basic umbrella if that, even.
---
For timezone tanking issues:  The way it should be is that when you place the structure that time (+/- 2 hours) becomes the permanent timer and nothing can change it except unanchoring the structure and replacing the structure in the TZ that is desired.
---
Leave it to a goon to state the complete opposite of reality. 
---
Panic ONLY helps umbrellas. Tank helps those without umbrella. Only those functioning under an umbrella can actually be saved in 6min. Those not under an umbrella 6min will not help them because help is not coming.
---
I think what would be needed to  give a long term solution for the Problem would be to limit the sice of an alliance. Territorry and player wise. Meaning a maximum systems an alliance can hold, with major drawbacks for crabbing in space that is not yours and a maximum number of characters in an alliance. 
---
Yes one might still have blue standings, but blue standings do break a lot easyer that alliances do (at least I think so). And it would force big Alliances to split up, what would give us the chance to make Nullsec the flick carpet of smaller empires and entities it could be. Would make 0.0 politics and wars a lot more interesting I think.
---
Combine that with a nerf of building capacities (back to a limited number of building orders per system), so losing a capital ship does hurt at least a bit again, and one might actually see this game for a lot longer.
---
I know that this wold probably hurt myself, as part of one of he big powerblocks, but realistically thats possibly the only way out of the direction we're heading.
---
Sounds like game of thrones.  All we are missing are white walkers and that intangible threat of udder annihilation.... invasions anyone?
---
nice conversation starter! if its so broken why is it still around? why are we talking about it instead of nerfing the shit out of? or fixing the real problems?
---
and PSA Breathing is generally good :P
---
If it's just a roam, set a defined final system before you turn around. It could be a nearby home system of another group, or the end of a pipe used by ratters. I think a system which is 20 minutes away is a good optimum - that way if nothing happens then it's just a 40 minute round trip with 10 minutes hanging about to give the locals time to get their act together if you want to brawl.
---
I usually run blackops and covops fleets, which by their nature can be longer in duration and are entirely dependent on what the hunters find. People who join my fleets tend to understand that and accept it.
---
There's still lots of fun stuff to be doing, don't let them get you down. Sometimes it requires being a bit more creative for the content, but it's very doable.

I see your point, and I agree with you, but that would only matter if Eve wasn't a player-driven sandbox.  Your complaint once again boils down to "I don't like that this sandbox game changes".
---
HELLO? YES. I TOO HAVE READ THE SKILLU POST AND HAVE SPENT THE LAST 2 MINUTES COMING UP WITH THE ANSWER TO FIX EVE. PLEASE, LET ME SHARE IT WITH YOU.
---
Haha yeah, I'm still pretty salty I didn't get the loot, and your ECM buddy cucked me from blowing the wreck. Only in Eve you can get such long lasting memories. I'm still hella mad about that one time I had a honorable 1v1 vs a Sabre, but his Falcon alt decloaked just as he hit hull.
---
Have OP been living under a rock? Goons aren't in the north trying to take more space. We're there to destroy anything touched by NCPL because they are a pest to Eve and they looked at us funny.
---
Delve isn't overpopulated, it's just populated. It's the rest of Nullsec that is empty.
---
I don't think you want to buy plex if you're goal is subscribing.  I think subscribing is cheaper if you do it directly without plex as an intermediary.
---
But whether you want the benefits of Omega enough to pay for them is not something we can help much with.
---
To clarify: most of the *skills* that make trade profitable, and unlock better haulers, are Omega-locked.
---
Most of the *skills* that make mining more efficient, and unlock decent mining ships, are Omega-locked.
---
Planetary Interaction is *completely* Omega-locked.
---
Remember that one time when you got called a pubbie?
---
see that COULD work. but in that line of thinking we may as well boost Exhumers and nerf Rorqs more as that essentially is a mini game. cycle Scanner cycle laser  wait 1min and cycle scanner again. the mini game is keeping your yield up and not wasting cycles on an empty rock lol.
---
but i see your point i think the easier solution tho is Fixing afk Rorqs and Ore availability would be something close to the Relic\\Data system where Anom's are Region bound if they are stripped out they move to another system. at least means they can't just bee in one system and mine it all every day. altho there is still WAY to much ore in space imo.
---
That's one fugly sentence bruh.
---
Some of the content frustration is that you guys were boxed in by Panfam on one side and Fraternity on the other, both of whom you guys are largely friendly with. Even if I wanted to poke skill urself sov or pick a fight.... it's not easy to get there from just about any direction. 
---
Add onto this the timezone tanking that makes generating even weekend timers a frustrating affair for anyone who is working a regular job in USTZ against timers set for EUTZ, and you have a recipe for some serious aids.
---
It wasn't just CCP that fucked you, to be clear. Y'all didn't help yourselves on that front either. But they certainly helped.
---
If your using leshaks your doing it terribly wrong
---
Honestly, yeah, make it a script for the WDFG that cyno inhibs. Of course make it have a smaller radius than a cyno inhib, so it can be used as the inhib is on the way or being anchored.

I like this idea.

\^this is what is known as the bitter vet.  The game is having hard times, sure, but they'd rather complain than go around and have fun with what exists.  Negative Nancy types.

Exactly, it's not the newbies using injectors that broke the market and ore supply.
---
Eh, don't try to pay for a subscription with a Venture.  You'll do nothing but mine, best possible case, if it can be done successfully at all.  Per your other posts, only a few hours a day available, I don't think you can make the kind of isk required to plex an account.
---
Joining a nullsec corp will help - mining in null is probably twice as lucrative before you factor in fleet boosting.

You need to manually place them (turn on the tactical overlay to help with depth perception) in space and then, after a short warm-up, its effect will take place - whether it be a bubble or an ecm burst or neut burst etc..

The ecm burst has a pretty low jam strength (5 points for each sensor type) but the jam lasts for 40 seconds if it hits.

Yes, now do you understand the difference between EVE politics and game mechanics now?
---
&gt; Keepstar in perimeter is providing us great income.
---
This is cute.
---
So siren t2s are better then?
---
So start with something like a T2 Battleship that is actually build for front line fleet combat. That would be a good start and might be a good material sink. 
---
Let's call it the heavy attack battleship and give it access to assault damage controls.
---
Fittet cost around 1 bill.
---
Next, nerf EHP of carrier and introduce T2 carrier at around 6-8 bill to get into a middle ground between carrier und super carrier.
---
Etc.
---
&gt;  That's why they decided to attack north. More space = more players in coalition and more space for renters. And well they are already the biggest and according to them "the best", so well this expansion will proceed slowly. Now they are in war, they will conquer space and end the war

Introducing mechanics that introduce a scaling mechanism ensuring fleets scale like a pyramid instead of an upside down pyramid would be helpful.
---
I agree N+1 is fun to some but ruins the game for others. Finding a solution that is equitable but still makes it a worthwhile goal to obtain the status of a super cap pilot will be a delicate effort.
---
Yes unless you're poor irl/earning crazy space money. 
---
If you have anything resembling an IRL job, it's not worth spending like 6h a month grinding isk in Eve vs. 1-2h a month for the job. 
---
If you're just starting out and *really really* don't want to spend money (like you live in venezeula and $15 is a month's food money or something), get creative with your isk acquisition; steal it, loot it, etc. Don't look to produce/"""earn""" 2+b a month on rookie SP, you'd need to belt rat for like 50 hours to make the money. 
---
A ton of people quit Eve because they try to venture mine/vexor rat a plex, spend two entire days on it, and say "hey this game is boring nothing fun ever happens and I spend all my time grinding." That's the Eve equivalent of trying to grind level 90 attack on lumbridge cows and then complaining that runescape doesn't have interesting combat. You play the game to have fun, not because it's your job; don't pigeonhole yourself into playing it like a job!
---
At least I have to shitpost a terrible meme in order to look like a clown.
---
we'll talk about this when you get on mumble tonight.
---
So, you don’t want to spend the time, planning and effort to learn ... instant gratification type , huh?
---
Oh right that massive skillu force was definitely holding the line in detorid...
---
You are taking this post way too seriously
---
I LIKE BLINGING OUT MY POSTS BRO
---
Awesome video!
---
No offense but your series of comments has ran off into the zone of “doesn’t make sense anymore”.
---
No, please elaborate the difference.
---
Sub omega, plex then pays for extra stuff like ships etc when you are broke. If you are doing well in ISK after going Omega then consider using isk to purchase plex to fund a second account.
---
Wow go afk in your rorq for an hr and it wont be there when you get back, or it will and the drones will be booshed away and stolen.
---
Poor poddling!!!
---
Yule lads was fantastic.
---
Sirens point a target, just like a warp disruptor module. They won't jam a target. The ECM burst will jam targets causing them to drop target lock
---
Yule lads was the bomb dizzle.
---
Literally never buy PLEX for ISK unless your filthy space-rich. Buying PLEX is just an option - but so many players feel compelled to use that option and waste hours on hours making ISK just to get PLEXed instead of, like, shelling 15$ and having actual fun in the game...
---
If CCP had managed to figure that out, just imagine how much they would have been able to sell to their user base.
---
But siren T2s better then warp burst projector?
---
Fucking psychopaths. that definatly breaks EULA right?
---
i got isk from them and you didn't :)
---
500 plex is $19.99 and you get \~2.2bil isk when you sell it. If you calculate how much isk/hour you make with your favourite pve activity and then divide 2.2bil with the amount you get how many hours you have to do pve to earn a plex. It might give you idea if buying a plex with real life money is worth it or not :)
---
You should ignore Redline, he's just salty that he left Goons because he wasn't allowed to do what he wanted and went and joined NC and now he still can't what he wants because NC doesn't undock.
---
Yeah you have a point. Living here in India, $15 is a lot of money and I don't even have a real job (still in school) so convincing my parents to pay that much for a game will be a hard time. I guess I'll just have fun in alpha then.
---
Best secret money maker in eve?
---
I’m 12 years into Eve now on three accounts. Never used an injector and still don’t fly a titan.
---
There’s so much enjoyment in the progression to the next ship, module etc is what has kept me around.
---
So yes ... I do believe the new player + injector folk will not stick around, especially when you can be at the endgame in a few days and dollars.
---
You have to be pretty dumb To not see the master plan here 
---
Conquering detorid allows the keepstar superhighway to extend northward and will be knocking on pamfams door soon.  Since test can’t pamfam, they’ll have to invade them from the southeast and will meet goons in the middle.  Pretty sure GotG/DeadCo (sort dragon) can be blued to test since they’re already blue to imperium.  
---
So after all of this work... it would truly be a blue donut of nullsec alliances all working together to build a pallantine KS somewhere and relocate all of the new eden market activity to that keepstar and burn out all of jita/Amarr.  All of new eden will be required to buy and sell at the palatine.  If not, you’ll be ganked repeatedly.
---
Or, and I'm just spitballing here, we just remove titans and supers from the game and then we can consider doing what you're suggesting.  The frontline t2 battleship, at least, seems like a very good idea.
---
What are you even going on about? The Agency goes over different parts of the game, and how to find/do them. By that logic, the probe menu is an "Ad" for signatures...
---
This kind of reaction only works to invalidate your feedback in the eyes of the designers.
---
That or set yourself up as a jita scammer and steal it, or something creative like that. 
---
You have to leave the beaten path to find 2b fast as a newbie, though; don't even think about grinding it with ratting/mining/exploring.
---
&gt;Know where to find any?
---
Some points to consider:
---
* It costs less man hours to pay for Omega with real money than with ISK in 98% of cases
---
* Omega isn't that useful when you are a beginner, because you don't have *piloting skills* and in-game know-how, only "skills"
---
* Depending on your preferred activities, Omega might not change anything at all for you -- flying fleet tackle doesn't need Omega, but you would probably need Omega if you wanted to fly some sort of heavy tackle (but you can still get away with using a t1 cruiser).
---
I returned after several years to find one of my characters had been hacked via email.  All of the skill points were drained and all assets were missing.  They were able to restore the skill points but not the assets.   It took about a month for the entire process.   I didn’t care as much about assets as the skill points because I couldn’t say what was on the toon anyway.  Hope for the best for you.  It sucks that this happens.   I would also recommend the 2 factor authentication as well.
---
Moths to a flame.
---
I wasn't here to educate you but rather make you look dumb, mission accomplished
---
Yes if you can, grinding to buy plex each month is a sure way to burn out.
---
usually i do, but this time dumb knows no alliance ticker
---
Instead of buying extractors from plex, they should be built with hard lvl4 data site objects (so datas become worth it again aswell) and obtain the bpc in some underrated LP store.
---
Here you go
---
Rokh was my “goal” cause it was the best looking ship back in 09, still love and think its the best ship :)
---
Honor Tank ftw
---
Alright now I can repost this everywhere and not get yelled at over a narrative or some such. Thanks!
---
no hes shit
---
we can argue over what "AFK" really means or you could just assume i mean minimal attention required to use. as any attention to a neut in local saves your drones.
---
Factional Warfare is good place to start from because there is heavy emphasis on frigates/destroyers. Don't stay there too long though because of the above fact :D
---
That's a cool one! Would fly it but I am still training missiles.
---
i still have yet to reach that point. im still dragging all my stuff from all around amarr and minmatar space
---
How can you call yourself a "bitter vet" but spew the shit about "catching up"?
---
You can become a very competent frigate pilot in a few months and beat people who have been flying for 10 years. Hell, most people have a carrier 0.5-1 years into their play time.
---
It is easier to make ISK now than ever, so new players can easily procure enough funds to buy titans, which are also now cheaper than ever.
---

i know for you this thread probably carries very little of the anticipatory nostalgia that it does for some of the rest of us, but it's always nice when the Good and Fun stuff never changes ♥

I want one :)
---
Just scan the first wormhole you find and keep scanning the chain, you'll start running into C5s pretty soon. If it turns out to be a dead-end chain, start over from a new one. Alternatively, look up the [Thera connections](https://www.eve-scout.com/thera/) - it's usually connected to some C5s.
---
hit a year of sobriety today - taking a sober fleet out tomorrow to celebrate and dunk on some nerds
---
Thank you, let's set timer and come back to this post in 5 years. I hope it will be laughable experience.
---
This and the other thread you posted lastnight scream incoming nyx lossmail. Please be sure to post it when it happens.
---
You know you can test this stuff on sisi right.
---
I was at Fanfest when someone wanted to steal my Google account.
---
From somewhere in Maryland :-(.
---
I noped the fuck out of that situation.
---
Why? Capital ships are initially a huge draw for new players.
---
Yep! I remember preparing for that with logi
---
"Logi, lock up the t3, ok pull dps! Everyone unlock the t3!"
---
They came with the rorqual changes. You can have any number of pilots but they're useless without pilots.
---
stopped reading when you said goons would beat therestofeve.exe, that’s not even remotely close to being true
---
are you bitter at kismeteer for being kismeteer or are you still bitter about not getting to properly brain-drain -BAT- given it moonwalked at the climax of sion kumitomo's half-decade-long revisionistic ego tantrum
---
Yep, clearly if you want to win, you should respect membercount spaceship honour
---
wtf did i just read
---
Only frat is allowed to batphone, anything else violates the tenants of e-bushido
---
I don’t think this is *actually* going the way you think it is...
---
ouch.
---
 **Cloaky Camping** 
---
So what are you going to do to the overpowered use of local chat and Intel programs that cloaky camping counters.
---
A corvette is at most 10,000 ISK. The only reason I'd ever see anyone buy one is maybe to reprocess (I'm not sure if even produces anything). If you docked at every station and pressed the board my corvette button, you could maybe accumulate 1 ever minute? 600k ISK per hour is very, very poor ISK. I'm pretty sure hisec ratting in asteroid belts gives more money than that and that's one of the lowest ISK per hour you can make.
---
You're a fucking idiot, it takes weeks to skill into a frigate and be just as skillpoint competitive as a 14 year veteran. I didn't start when the game started, yet somehow managed to compete and beat players who had years long headstarts on me
---
There is no catching up in eve unless you're talking about titans and supers, and the myth that it was a thing is whats murdering the game.
---
There has been a steady decline in eve that accelerated the year they released injectors.  They also helped drive a loyal veteran playerbase put of the game for a handful of new players
---
All of us playing had to wait, its progression was a selling point, once it was removed you saw and are still seeing the mass exodus.
---
You know how much screaming people would do when us goons permacamp NPC Delve stations with these modules and just sit afk cap-stable FAXs on said moduled ship for meme reps?
---
We are anomalous  
---
We are a region  
---
Forgive and forget  
---
Expecto patronum
---
I did not sayed that they will. At least not in near future. Right now we have 2 blocks south and north. South is going to evict north. Maybe in 2-3 years. Then south will break up and we will have test vs goons.
---
Ofc there is small chance that we will engage goons before destroying whole north, but it is very unlikely
---
Hmmm... I give it one more try.
---
What is advertising? In simple words this is information where you can find something. 
---
Still don’t understand?
---
The funny thing is, with the new changes, if you're the one that fired the ecm burst, they will keep the lock on you! 
---
ECM in general is so messed up right now.
---
It’s not rorquals, it’s everyone’s inability to put forth the slightest bit of effort to kill them. The current EVE group is so fucking lazy they can’t even fly a god damn Sabre around to bubble and light a cyno... god forbid people have to actually do more than “undock” and right-click “jump to / take bridge”.
---
Hey, it's a new content generator and an untapped salt mine.
---
^ this is what is known as a goon. They will keep telling you the game is fun while actively trying to ruin it for everyone else, it has been their alliance motto/mission since the very beginning. They are lead by an egotistical prick with a god complex, that doesn't even play this "fun" game as they call it...
---
It is long term perspective. I'm not saying that they need space right now. But in long term yes, they will need it. + ofc they hate ncpl
---
Yes.
---
A good way i've found to never get phished is to just never click an email link period.
---
You are having fun because you are new and dont understand what is happening or how it's effects are hurting the game
---
Eve isn't about being fast at anything. there is no "same level" as anyone else.. i've been playing since 2012 and injectors are terrible. i love them for the fact if im missing a skill poof i have it. but injecting into a whole ship or fit is absurd. 80% of the power comes from the first 4 skill levels on 80% of the ships and fits. 50m SP by the way  total between all toons is like maybe 200 across 9 Characters 3 Accounts. the biggest issue i see for newbros is WTF DO I DO IDK what these ships are IDK what ship is good.
---
getting into a VNI is just as strong as a T3 in the right hands.. piloting\\Ship management is WAY more important than SP level. always has always will be. 90% of eve is knowledge\\skill 9% SP and 1% luck.
---
T2 frigs are like what 2 weeks to get into? maybe a month with good core skills. the other ships are SUPPOSED TO TAKE A WHILE if you go from 0 to 60 in 2s you can hardly see the acceleration from 60-90... if your in the best of the best day one.. whats to improve to? Skill injectors remove this entirely.. and let Credit card Warriors buy up to max Tengu's and Max Rorqs..yay..
---
by fighting you mean dropping an entire regions worth of titans on a frigate?
---
[this is also why you don't text your exes](https://i.imgur.com/qht9DA1.png)
---
Don't forget you train skills faster as an Omega.
---
I know I'm going to perpetuate a stereotype here, but it's absolutely true in this case:
---
FIRST, build your spreadsheet.  It is entirely possible to build things in EVE and lose money on it.
---
Track the value of every input and output, including your time and any transportation costs.
---
Make sure you account for your refining percentage, with whatever skills you have and what facilities are available to you.
---
What about the players that realize that, while they don't have to wait 3 years to fly one, if they want to truly be competitive with old-school players, they're going to have to dredge up the resources for more like 4 or 5?  
---
Titans have gone from being an ambitious-but-achievable goal to being an expected standard.  They're not really "cool" anymore because they've been trivialized.  We fly them because they're necessary for the titan n+1 DD blap meta, but because they're enjoyable.
---
Nope, there isn't anything, I dunno just play Homeworld series or something...
---
Solo scimi just means it's the first primary being called.
---
What are the rewards is all we need to know
---
So true. Best ships you can bring to any fight is a friend with a ship.
---
I'm gonna be away from eve for about two months. I'm an Omega pilot, so what are some skills I should be throwing in my queue to complete while I'm away?
---
Also apply it to bastion modules, so marauders have some more use
---
&gt;Yes.
---
Yeah. Good luck getting on the CSM mate. I'm sure you will get loads of votes with that attitude.   
---
If you need help knowing how to roam delve ask Volta or bombers bar. They kill billions there.
---
&gt;2) remove compression
---
I hope by this, you mean "compression by rorquals in space." If you meant "remove all compression, including compression done inside a structure," you're crazy. Compressing minerals makes them actually able to be moved without self-harm levels of shipping effort. Doing this would further dissuade anyone from exporting minerals, making local production even more powerful than it is today.
---
ROGER WILCO
---
im confused how you can manage to get a worm that expensive? mind sharing a fit
---
Haven't seen anything take them on yet
---
Also it's a giant space penis
---
IMO the best thing they could do (which they obviously won't) is to limit the skill injection to subcaps only, but most likely something something spaghetti code, something something bottom line...
---
So basically you're saying you missed the last reward? That sucks. The events after rogue drones were all downhill though.
---
Nice try, but no. Like I posted in another thread to someone saying good fight and sorry about our fort, I replied don't be because it brought us a ton of content and that's why it was dropped. Rote is salty because they couldn't kill it themselves
---
It's still around because none of us can do anything about it. You can make your little threads just like everyone else, nothing will change. The guys with power don't want to hear it
---
&gt;... and it's all filled with worst of the scum of internet 
---
And here you are.
---
there is no CATCHING UP.. what you can't fly a Titan so your behind? fuck off.. Caps use-to-be a privilege now they're a casual's best friend. Its this mentality that is going to kill Eve you didn't start when the game started so im behind so i wont play.. wtf's the point in playing any MMO then? play a Diablo session oh shit i dont have the best gear better quit. is exactly what your telling me.
---
i have sympathy for newbros but thats where new bro content comes in. you can't expect to be in the best on day one in a sandbox MMO. it breaks everything.
---
Newbros should be doing the content made for them not trying to PVP with capitals till they figure out wtf Eve is or how the fuck to fly a ship reasonably
---
Lies! Breathing wastes energy, and there is the chance I might smell something! =O
---
so, no one is going to point out that the knife is supposedly 20ish meters long?
---
Delete the skill queue system.
---
Make a point buy skill system.
---
Replace skill injectors with re skill items.
---
If you want new players dont gate shit behind sub time on an ancient ass game.
---
Fine, you will stay alpha for now. You can still have fun. However, 1 mil isk per hour as an alpha is very low. Either join a corp or start doing activities that net you more isk.
---
Start exploration, you can start high sec/lowsec to get the hang of it then you can go into null. Even as alpha new bro you could still make 50-100mil an hour. 
---
Mining for just a few mil is boring and you are certain to quit within months at most.
---
Join in game channel Sons of bob, speak to olli jokinen, there is advice there about how exploration can be done and even an opportunity to join a cool corp.
---
Once you get a bit of isk from exploration and get some skills ask in there about incursions. Good isk can be made, even enough to omega ur account if you wished.
---
I've been saying cynos shouldn't be a thing since 2008, you already have a power source to lock onto in each system, it's called the freaking sun! 
---
Some of CCPs mechanics are really dumb.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Fuck you and every new player, the game would have been better off dying than accommodating the instant gratification generation.
---
The truth is it feels like it's dying almost because CCP gave up the HTFU attitude. We used to have 65K users logged in. Now the average is what, half that? Maybe two thirds?
---
They already lose their minds just from me bubbling those stations, adding a cyno jammer to that would possibly result in a large annurism-related death in EVE grr goon players.
---
Ah yes, titan/supercap havers of days past.
---
He also understands alienatieng and backstabbing allies and thus fracturing a coalition leading to strategies in which the goal is to allow thr enemy to glass a region
---
Even without docking rights though it seems that you can seed Citadels system wide from the solar system map?
---
&gt;How can you call yourself a "bitter vet" but spew the shit about "catching up"?
---
He got caught cheating via account sharing and has to start over. I guess it makes him a bitternewb.
---
They can't keep griefing people for the lulz like they used to be able to is what your response pretty much says without actually saying it directly. It's why Eve's playerbase has a reputation for being douchebags. No other game is so hands off, allowing players to fuck with other players so much in such a negative, self-sabotaging way. 
---
It's honestly what attracts a lot of those types of players. They would be given suspensions and bans in any other game for a lot of that stuff, especially shit like Erotica1 pulled and the like. CCP has finally stepped up to the plate to rein in some of that stuff and now the crybabies are pissed about it
---
Eve was never about quicker. Fuck your ADHD bullshit
---
Then leave.
---
&gt;Here's an idea that has been proposed several times over the past years.
---
FTFY
---
It took me until about halfway through the article to realize this wasn't a normal news site. That's because we ARE like this.
---
Sounds about right. Our Slosh op days were on point.  Lots of good memories, lots of dying badly and having a blast.
---
The #1 thing to do is have a plan. I'm going to go to X and look for Y. If you don't have a plan you are MUCH more likely to fail and subsequently have fun.
---
...hunting... explorers? I just said that lol.
---
Laugh all you want, but without NSA, getting damped fucking sucks in a super. Something like 20 sensor strength or so. After jumping, there is not a whole lot of cap to play with in a super, especially if you plan on using NSA while under neuting pressure. Do you go gank fit in that nyx? That dread is gonna eat you alive. If you are a very good super pilot, then fuck it, will bring in a 5th person in a curse to guidance disrupt your heavies.
---
they are long range sabre bubbles, hop on to sisi you can play around with them
---
Not really. Expected for games that don't really innovate or improve enough to keep their core audience.
---
For a moving target, definitely. Burst projector can keep a ship with a jump drive from jumping, but it has a pretty small radius, doesn't last long, and has a long cool down.
---
For most situations, sirens will probably keep a target on grid more reliably.
---
The way above is non-retarded, you are just beyond retarded.
---
Sirens might last longer
---
Less delay is definitely worth it. A lot of explorers are aligned out and the SB no-lock delay is sometimes the only thing to catch them is the insta-lock.
---
Also, in order to get torps to apply the same damage to a frigate as rockets do, you'd need a painter, which gives up a mid that you need for a dual scram fit, because a lot of explorers use 3 wcs.
---
TLDR: PVE ishtar, pvp ishtar, nightmare, arazu, bumping stabber
---
Unrealistic favourites are the lach/arazu with max bling pointing to 133km and scramming nerds to 49.9km. or a gold magnate going 85km/s
---
But those are like very very out of my budget
---
For funs, i love my stabber for bumping random people, ill fly around in a stabber and look for random orcas or freighters then bump them for like 10min just to annoy them.
---
For PVP, i havent flown one yet but my goal is a nightmare, after being inspired by all the videos and fittings, i really wanna get a 3bil nightmare and fly around lowsec pumping 1k dps on people
---
PVE: Ishtar, i love it so much, afk havens in null w 3 drone speed rigs, 1 omni 1 adaptive 1 gist x large booster, and a cap battery, lows 4 faction DDAs and 2 warp stabs cause im gay
---
Thing facetanks frigates and warps out under a scram, not to mention you sit still in sites so you can warp out in only 6-7 seconds if a gang comes nearby. i always had a depot and deployed it the moment i landed on a site, if i saw a fight i could win id refit to a dual armor rep 2 web scram battery fit and kill frigs/dessies
---
Travel: Ares, its the best ceptor. Use perches and instead of a DCU fit a warp stab because the guys at Osmon have ultralockers locking even 2 sec aligners
---
Transport: Orca, its easy to train to and has huge cargo w the fleet hangar + cargo bay
---
&gt; Really like this idea, probably too sensible
---
Lobby your new CSM. If enough people organized and demanded sensible change, maybe Hillmar would pause from counting his money long enough to order it implemented (after he makes sure CCP still gets its micro-transaction income of course).
---
And send me all his extracted SP
---
humour detection failure bot - would you like a complimentary chill pill?
---
I was gonna run next year but considering there is actually 1-2 places on the CSM up for grabs.
---
I would say do it this way:
---
* Do you have a full time job?
---
   * If yes, subscribe to the game.
---
   * If no, don't, save your money because IRL is more important than EVE.
---
Subjectively speaking, the ships that are available with Omega are far more fun. Having the ability to cloak is a godsend and will allow you to do wormhole stuff. Having more than one account subscribed means being able to run both of those accounts at the same time, so you can be your own scout/hauler/salvager/etc. 
---
You gotta remember, EVE before like 2016 was subscription only and Omega (equivalent) was the only thing available. Alpha is going to be a weakened, watered down experience no matter what.
---
Wdym not a lot of cap just hit your cap booster lmao
---
Simultaneously immensely salty about changes to eve, and unsubbed and hasn't played for years.
---
This is EVE
---
Okay bud, no probs.....good chat
---
It always is
---
That’s pretty much what I figured, luckily enough wh travel keeps everyone busy up until the fight begins. Helps keep them stimulated for the most part.
---
Yea... right.. Clearly its cuz they cant die is why not because most mats have halfed in price since the rework. Yupp totally why.
---
Appreciate the feedback, I’m hoping with my little community it grows and eventually my little pilots grow up and lead their own roams eventually.
---
i meant compression by rorqs.  but honestly, compression in general would be worthwhile looking at.  Already have the system in place with moon rocks.  And localizing production is not a bad thing.
---
Bro money well spent. Haters always gonna say its dying. Lits of fun can be had though so you should not worry yourself. And stop paying attention to Reddit eve is dying posts. Its a common theme here.
---
Again Eve is a niche game. You can’t equate it to other games. If you try to make Eve like other games, you ruin it.  The simple truth is that almost every other game does pve better then Eve.  The pve in Eve simple stinks.  It’s basically circle this rock and press f1 or circle this rat and press f1. So if you are into pve you might as well play some other game. What differentiates Eve from everything else is while you are engaged in pve you can be Griefed which adds the excitement to Eve. And let’s get real, the likelihood of someone being griefed in High sec is infinitesimally small. Ofc it possible to be griefed in hs but the chance of it happening at any given time to any given player is just remote.   Since ccp reduces the  pvp in highsec they have not captured any new players. The hordes of players that like pve are not showing up because there are better games for that and the pvp’ers are not sticking around because their style of game play has been changed or eliminated.
---
Still get the 5 min panic and cyno beacons are a thing, so is gating from next door.
---
the meteor pack is 11 euro with greenmangaming with the discount code E3 at the moment, if you were going to "test" as sub thats the way i would go for today.
---
1 month sub
---
plex worth approx 400mil
---
some skins worth i dunno how much
---
I honestly believe that Legacy will no longer be a coalition within the next 2 years. TEST is not exactly known as a long term friend.
---
I’ll definitely check this out when I get home, seems like a lot of good information from a quick glance.
---
Agreed, and I fumble with trying to maintain perfection instead of clear and concise.  Definitely something I need to work on.
---
Good, keep it that way and make them be the big shiny toy that they have to work towards and they can inject all the other shit. Caps as a carrot on the end of the stick in front of a new bro is way better than just the next thing they inject. Don’t really care if someone has a guardian alt they injected, I do care if they have a FAX alt they injected yesterday. 
---
It’s only a couple more months to earn the skills to fly that FAX after injecting a perfect guardian why is it necessary to let someone fly a FAX after they’ve played EVE for 4 months total and have went from VNI to Carrier ratting/Rorq Mining? All from injectors? It’s not about them “suffering” it’s about them getting to experience more of the game than “Jump To: Fleet Cyno” and dropping fighters, clicking siege or triage green and thinking that’s all EVE has to offer as an endgame because that situation and that thought is what has put EVE into its current state.
---
One of many reasons to love the EVE player base.
---
Day 1 capital ship players are probably not new players.
---
Gamers are entitled fuckwits, more at 11
---
DO NOT JOIN GOONS OR YOU WILL BE BORED SHITLESS IT IS UTTERLY TERRIBLE AND BORING
---
You'll need to do riskier activities if you want even a chance at being able to PLEX using ISK. A Venture can enter wormholes and collect gas, then bring it back to sell. Others have estimated that you would make between 20 and 50 million isk an hour doing that. However, it's riskier, and you will die trying sometimes! Exploration is equally risky but more variable, and the payouts tend to be in the 10-100 million isk per hour range.
---
In general, paying for your account's subscription with real money is going to end with you doing more fun things and less grinding. However, I'd recommend waiting at until you hit the soft cap for free players' skills before doing so (this takes about 250 days). That gives you some time to spend trying various activities, and you'll have more skills by the time you subscribe.

Show up on time

dramiel. i made it my goal to uber pimp mine with officer mods and a full nearly max abyssal suite. its just a trophy ship, but i love it. i know im a loser for not flying it, but it makes me happy.
---
Yeah, but that’s an aside; I was only commenting on the three aspects of play I addressed.
---
What is it though
---
i see only a timeline with the fight. spodbrain must translate that as smugpost
---
no one wants to fight in 1k battles.
---
I agree with that,  several of my fleets were just a let’s see what happens mindset and it was terrible and ended up being more stressful than fun for the entire group.
---
What are some obtainable goals you can set for a newish group of players? I’ve got a group with a range of 5-60 mill sp. most of my fleets have been more based on instruction. So their has always been goals. But now they all have an idea and know their role.
---
Pretty much
---
Good luck dude, so sad to read :/
---
Easier for me than them unfortunately. I’ve canceled fleets because of that.
---
We can't handle basic things. Fries my brain
---
Ladies night. I have to take wife to the movies. She wants to see the new Godzilla
---
So a slow capital ship would be best? Will sirens keep
---
It from jumping? Cuz i just eanns got in and pew pew die like a pig noob
---
Outskilled. Too soon?
---
I have noticed a great deal of disconnects recently, yes. I normally run 9 clients and experience 1-2 overall disconnects every 2-4 hours. Now I am seeing 2-3 every 15-20 minutes. My ISP and my computer have not changed.
---
Blops is one of the few things we’re gearing towards, how many hunters do you need/require for a timely hunt?
---
I am also of two minds about injectors. On one hand, what's more pay-to-win than getting able to buy both isk and skill points with cash? I've been playing for more than thirteen years and I'm only just now getting into a Titan. Why should these punks get to do it in no time? 
---
On the other hand, the only reason I'm able to afford a Titan is because I've been selling my own excess SP since I ripped out all of my characters' space job skills. I used to have a ton of those and no real desire to use them. Now I'm rich enough that I don't need them. My main had all the combat and support skills I wanted (until I got the Titan anyway). It's a good income and I don't have to do much at all for it, as long as I'm willing to arrest my skill progression. I could pull out even more if I didn't care about being pan-racial for all subcaps. I refer to it as the bitter vet dividend.
---
I was an FC for Spectre and a small wormhole corp, so do with my advice what you will, I was never big time:
---
1: Buy a second monitor, or if you have one, make sure all of the tools you will need are there in advance. I learned this the hard way when I started FCing. It is significantly harder without at-a-glance access to dotlan, zkill, and discord (if you are using that). 
---
2: Plan a generalized route. Most people don't like to wander aimlessly, so have a region or chain that you want to hit up ready in advance. I tended to hang out for awhile in a region if I wanted to roam there in the future to get a good idea of how many people were alive and how they liked to take fights. Don't be afraid to stray though. Be flexible if there is action somewhere off the beaten path. 
---
3: Plan a time frame. When will the roam happen and for how long. Tell everyone that joins. This was more spectre specific, but people seemed much happier when they knew when we were leaving, and when we would get back to port. 
---
4: Work off the shakes. No matter how long I play, I still get the combat shakes the first few fights in a day. It is distracting when trying to FC, so I would do some solo stuff before the fleet. 
---
5: A bunch of people mentioned this, but delegation is so important. Having a good scout especially makes running a good fleet easier by magnitudes. Make sure to have a backup scout ready, even if the fleet only needs one, because they will die at some point. Even the best tackle gets blapped from time to time. 
---
6: Talk! You aren't just a commander as an FC, you are in effect, an entertainer. Give feedback to your pilots, repeat commands once or twice, tell a damn joke. This is supposed to be fun, and it is your job to make it fun!
---
7: Learn to dscan, even if you have a scout that gives that information properly. This should be a given, but the sheer number of people that don't know how to dscan still scares me. 
---
8:  Don't choke. A bad call is almost always better then no call. Most pilots are f1 junkies and are looking to you for basically everything. Always have everyone doing something, even if it is a specific command to hold. 
---
9: Don't sweat the little stuff. Inevitably, there will come a moment that it is imperative everyone hold a gate. Just as inevitably, someone will jump that gate. Chastise, but don't berate them. 90% of the time, they already know they fucked up. Best practice is to just move on and reformat your plan accordingly. 
---
Anyway, there is a lot more, but this is already long. A lot you will pick up from just flying around. Knowing your ships and environments are things that really only stick after direct contact.
---
Who are Omega &amp; Friends Medialabs and why do they own all of the POCOs around Jita?
---
I appreciate people in space are usually friendly even after some banter.
---
People on /r/Eve are really over the top shitty to each other. I bet half the people being dicks here don't even undock or bother to play the game.
---
Shoutout to the frienamies
---
&gt; I mean, I think it's hard to argue that there weren't significant consequences to WWB.
---
I was more getting at the fact that the map is empty enough that you can just take your ~10k man alliance at that point to the other side of the map and there's space for you to take and live in. Real estate isn't a valuable commodity so kicking someone out of it isn't as big of a deal as it might have been a few years prior.
---
&gt; Whats the point of 2fa if it can be bypassed?
---
its not. one factor is the correct password. the second is the code that you have multiple ways to access.
---
Leshak - I Know I'm weird but I love structure bashing. Leshak is King in that area.
---
No but moving ore is cancer.. Like a freighter load is maybe a few 100m at most. I dont like the rorq having on grid compression simply due to the fact it can then stay in the belt forever.. Every other miner has to haul their ore back to station. I feel like the moon rocks were a shot at this but not quite enough.
---
I would quit mining if they take station compression out. It was bad enough using a pos back in the day.
---
Why is it that people who have literally no clue what they are talking about keep posting all of this trash.
---
Dreddit is recruiting! PM me for details!
---
Eve never USE to be about quickere back when everybody was still training towards better things, and relatively in the same class ship. But then more and more players were in better and larger ships.
---
NOW it is about quicker because to even stand a Chance in a lot of fights you need to be able to fly similar ships.

What content was removed from highsec?
---
That's what people are doing
---
Like your face! (That was a good one, c'mon, you know it)
---
 Very valid points, and #4 resonated with me even more so. That’s actually a really good idea for me personally. Last fight we had I the shakes hardcore and you could tell in my voice that It was hard to concentrate on.  
---
Working on a second monitor as well, because having that information at a glance would be so much better than switching screens over and over.
---
And that doesn't matter ?
---
it localizes production meaning you can't pull ore from an entire region to fuel a capital building spree.  so eh, it might be beneficial to stop compression?  
---
as a quality of life thing, i agree completely.  hauling uncompressed ore around is fing mindnumbing.
---
I mean thats a pretty defeatist attitude.
---
What the GSM runs the game may as well quit while  ahead eh? I dont buy that.
---
shockingly, outing that you're still firmly attached to two-year-old wartime narrative and projectively posting about your boredom-hatred for eve is not actually a good look
---
Hunting in null is the easiest it has ever been in eve online.
---
I can tackle a hostile capital in under 10s from entering system.
---
Someone else organised it into the spreadsheet for neatness, But the data presented was released by CCP
---
Waffles. 
---
Low sec nomads, and I don't regret joining them
---
+ We got Karaoke night ;)
---
The game had a lot more people playing when there were no injectors. There was no catching up just specializing and finding your niche. People enjoyed this until CCP went overboard with microtransactions and the game never recovered.
---
I'm working, actually. But I'll try and muster up the...initiative (see what I did there) to check back on your hakonen campaign at the beginning of the year. 
---
We shouldn't be seeing any grandstanding on your part for taking any ihubs in Vale. I can assure you that the majority of Pandemic Legion doesn't give a single fuck about Mitten's temper tantrum...nor of Initiatives lacklustre attempt at being relevant.
---
or they could just cap injector returns even more aggressively than they do today? A newbro probably doesn't need more than 25m SP to try out several styles of play, while a super/titan/rorq pilot most definitely needs more than that to perform at a non-gimped level
---
Remove panic = I don't want a fight, I want a dunk.
---
What 'group pvp financial incentives' were there ever?
---
No idea, truth be told I had them muted because they talked so much crap in local
---
Sisi rest server is your friend
---
I dont think that would stop anything honestly.. Wpuld just put more freighters into space.. Which is a good thing but the odea is to make rorqs not broken.. If that means nerfing the rest of mining then were taking the wrong approach.
---
Im not a fan of "localized" production cuz it usually means I need a freighter to even think about building anything cuz moving shit between stations is cancer. I live in Test space atm and they I swear to god they have a rait set up for everything one for this one for that.. Like im not moving my mins through three diff systems just to build a fucking ship..moving from refinery to building station is MORE than enough hauling for me personally.
---
You add more to this and the mat market will crash harder but will be super localized so HS ore would be trash but if your in a block you could probably get a good price for null ore cuz no one can bring in the trit they need.. 
---
Idk I feel limiting the ore we have in space is a better way to approach it. Not limiting the ore we can move..
---
It's alts
---
money moons
---
So which constellation is in the background and why 7 stars on the rings?
---
yes all you need is fresh new players on the game that has a retention rate of jack shit
---
Teddybears. are recruiting :D
---
you're not wrong to ask this question; i just don't think it reaches as far as you think it does.
---
if you want to just roam or whatever, and you're not too thin-skinned to weather getting loldropped by locals or spending two hours to find pretty much nothing, then yeah sure eve's still viable sometimes
---
if you want to be a midsize group that plays in order to not only have fun and pull cool stuff off but equally importantly *to have consequential impact*, then no, the hippy roamers / temp-deploy models for midsize groups have long been unable to offer that
---
again, you're not wrong to frame the question that way; i just think the extent of what it can address as a question can be  limited by what kinds of outcomes for your actions you might need in order for eve to be engaging and meaningful
---
skill urself could not fight panfam or frat anymore than they could legacy and goons (emphasis on the 'and'). your corp is bigger than our alliance, just for some perspective.
---
"Remove" panic was never in my post. I suggest it more of an assault damage control instead. So it can still be targeted and take damage just a very small ammount for "few" mins.
---
Should yield the same I cant die immediately but still give the big guys that can escalate properly a chance to fight.
---
Idk there is no skill to panic.. And that roves a lot of interest for me.. If it wasnt jist a I HAVE THE POWERRRR button it wouldnt be sooooo bad.
---
There is no skill to dropping 200 bombers on a dude that is locked in place for 5 minutes.
---
maybe for goons, but not for the people they were attacking who eventually put aside their differences to push back. those moons meant something to those alliances, they were worth fighting for an over. what is worth fighting over now?
---
They are literally as weak as carriers at this point, what are you smoking?
---
it's literally what happened. almost every single group in the war took money from lenny, and the lowsec groups were initially fighting for their own income.
---
I never said there was but there is mpre skill and planning to that than pushing a button and being invincible. 
---
If 200bombers catch you, probably should die lol.
---
There is skill and planned to rage rolling out of Thera until you find a sieged rorqual?
---
Largely is, you can't train command center upgrades to a useful level as an alpha
---
I remember the days of tunnel snakes and entire bottles of JD lol
---
I was more amused by your shitty linking skills than this picture
---
Jesus F(ail) Christ. How did you win that against that much DPS if you were static on grid? There's a level of bad I can't even comprehend.
---
Nothing atm unfortunately. As weak as carriers.. Ok you know the 1b hull that deals 2k dps.. Only as weak as that ok.. Cuz thats weak right? Oh no my carrier cant kill a frigate ccplease help!
---
Sirens will keep a fax/carrier from warping off if it doesn't have warp core stabs. One flight of sirens won't hold a super or titan from warping. They will prevent all jump drives from activating as far as i know.
---
Are you trying to tackle something with just the warp disruption burst projector?
---
A lot actually.. Rage rolling is a lot harder than nullbears think it is. Takes math and knowlege of mechanics..
---
It's not hard at all. I have rolled hundreds of holes. Stop trying to bullshit. It's just time consuming and annoying.
---
Squad with Harv and i, listen to raknor and Ziel fight, and listen to Lego, canary and I talk about world of warships, and an invite to our classic wow guild

There are worse movies to be dragged off to, TBH.

The region represented is solitude. the stars are a representation of command and slavery: what you control controls you.

Squad is dope, fights are funny, British BB's or GTFO &amp; Druid or GTFO. Love and kisses.

I've heard good things about it

How did they know who I was?!?

I don't need to listen, I know an upvote when I see it.

Like others have said, that is still 2FA, please check out the security settings in you account page to know and understand the options available, you should be able to fine tune how you want to be able to login.
---
Be careful, there are still options where you have to print out a set of one time passwords, if you loose them, and your auth key, you can loose access to your data.
---
He's a part of me.... one of my legion of accounts
---
Marshall was for fanfest and evevegas, had to attend both to get it that way. Then later project disco.
---
i mean, it isn't going to happen.  And my original thought was just taking off compression from rorqs or having the option to compress but not panic (or some other sort of choice instead of having the ability to do it all).  But some sort of indy nerf wouldn't be terrible.  right now mining is garbage unless you are multiple boxing something.  And short of a rorq, you are better off just flying a VNI if you want to make isk.
---
Ok Mr initiative. I didnt say it was "hard" it is way harder than pressing f1 and screaming in coms.
---
Takes planning takes ships takes knowlege. Let me put it this way new bro A joins the game and jumps into his rorq after CC warrioring into it. Another new bro say B joins and injects into a hic for the giggles. Now who has to know more about the game to use that ship? What game knowlege does it take to ACTIVATE A SINGLE MODULE. Is it harder for newbro A or new bro B? I think new bro B has to figure more out in order to be effective but thats may jist be me.
---
&gt; They will prevent all jump drives from activating as far as i know.
---
Sirens still need to beat the ship's warp core strength to prevent them jumping
---
Succubus. I almost aolo killed a ratting thingy in my succubus. His fighters couldn't track me to save his life.iterally... unfortunately for me he had a hyena come in and I had to bail. Because webs

yea, i know, i even lost my email one time when i was teen, since then i have unique passwords everywhere and email one is changed monthly, right now knowing that those security systems got failsafe im rigt now setting this thing up, just waiting for new battery for my phone to arrive
---
Was in a leshak bash last night, seems they changed that. Now its constantly switching to a different spot on the station, but its all the ships and they all switch at the same time. (might be my game that was bugged) liked it way more when it kept hitting the same spot
---
Even the most experienced FCs I flew with would get that crackle in their voice, and after doing it myself, I knew the shakes had kicked in. Pretty amazing and hilarious Eve can do that to people who have been playing for over a decade. It does dull a bit with exposure though, so I would go out and welp a couple of frigs or cruisers in lowsec. 
---
The second monitor saved me so much grief. I even tried to use the ingame map for a few roams because I would miss things alt-tabbed all the time. If you have a tablet or something, that can also work, but I found a phone was just too hard to navigate effectively.
---
Best is we can make fun of these people all we want without getting downvoted because the same people quit reddit when reddit did the same.
---
Thats exactly the problem mining is busted because rorqs made it that way. Whats the reason to not fly a rorq.. Vni is cheaper thats fucking it.
---
Rorqs need to be reworked to remove the afk ability to at least give barges a fighting chance.
---
Welp. Thanks for checking it anyway, mate.
---
*triage not shown in picture
---
You said it was a lot harder. I said it's not hard. Now you defend what you said with wall of text. Woo. I probably like your credit card statement best, like... I don't want people to financially support this game and I also can't beat up people for spending money even though I am elite pvp. Haha. RIP convo.
---
and then some more because you need to farm a lot of PD to get one.
---
If you’re gonna use real money just sub for $15 instead of paying $19.99 for 500 plex
---
Right..  Glad to know you were never arguing im good faith. I have a problwm with people injecting into the best of the best of the best on day one. But yes RIP convo bye
---
You have a problem with injectors. That is a different issue than rorquals. Different arguments. Pick one and stick to it.
---
This is clever
---
That's dangerous!
---
People have been complaining for years, but hey, keep at it. I'm sure something will change
---
Gotta stop watching that ghey porn with Carneros. That shits loaded with malware.
---
Supers will be 6-8bil before the end of the year dw
---
Right, well, good news is I got your bpo stash + rorqual for 'only' 55b, so if CCP deigns to give you back the isk the hacker got from liquidating your account, I can sell that stack back to you for 55 and you won't lose any money on it. (I think it's worth more like 80)
---
Make sure to ask the GM handling your case (if you ever get a response lol) for the isk the hacker got for your stuff (in addition to SP restoration), so you aren't starting from 0 again. In a lot of cases they won't return the money the hacker got for your items (much less the items themselves) but if you ask directly you might get a better response. Good luck!
---
I started in 2014 for 3 months.  I enjoyed skilling up slowly as I was learning parts of the game.  
---
I rejoined 2 years later and found a good small corp and started learning some real PvP skills from some great pilots.  When their CEO won Eve (he was ranked #6 on zkill) we wandered a bit trying to find a home.  The whole time I was skilling... and learning.  I got a 2nd account with what I was making in-game (industry, trading, etc.)
---
The is SO FREAKING MUCH to this game before you become one of the GSF n+1 F1 titan monkeys and AFK rorq miners.  
---
In the rush to be one of those GSF monkeys you are missing a whole lot of the game along the way.
---
This gave me a thought.  In subcaps we have to learn A LOT about all the various ways we can be beat, or the various ways we can beat someone.  Titans, caps, rorq panic, etc. just remove all the rock-paper-scissors strat and counterplay, hence they are unfun and involve only n+1.
---
Unfortunately they are all encompassing. one issue feeds into another. Rorqs are a problem BECAUSE of injectors capitals are a problem BECAUSE of injectors and rorquals... rorqs are a problem because they are the best of the best of the best wot no reason to use anything else. If you have a barge alt better get rorq training.
---
Just because one issue involves another doesnt mean it isnt an issue. Yes injs are a problem but extractors are an even bigger one.
---
Don't buy Omega with Plex that you paid for yourself. Ever. The monthly subscription is a better deal.
---
I want to tackle a normal carrier/dread for enough time
---
For me to rekt the shit out of it with my T2 heavies and T2 light fighters.
---
As a bittervet, I could not play the game as an alpha.  Too many way better, and by that I mean more versatile, ships to be flown.  It does really depend on what kind of game you want to play and what you want to do.  Learn how to fly and how the game works first.  Learn what you like in the game and where you want to go from there.  You should get a decent amount of flight time in so you are not just some scrub who can't fly their new blinged out Bhal or Vindi and lose it to gate guns.
---
Basically, play the game.  You start where every omega started in the good old days.  Do some things that you like to do.  Train a few alt account to do some different things.  You won't lose too much time on shit you don't like to do.  When you find the stuff you like, upgrade one of those accounts to omega and pursue your Eve dreams to their fullest.  
---
TLDR:
---
You can have some fun as an alpha.  Every player before the free to play era started with the same abilities.  Get omega if you are having fun as an alpha because you are having fun and more fun can be had as an Omega because you have options.
---
police nyx would be amazing
---
Rorquals make content and fights. Ain't nobody forming 50 plus dudes to hunt exhumers that just warp off.
---
I mean rorq has been getting steady nerfs since its rework.. They are just missing the issue as its yield dosent matter of it can super afk mode like a vni can.
---
Problem from my perspective is the CSM being democratic instead of CCP doing a sort of lottery with a good number of high status extremely knowledgeable players. As the GSM is just going to advocate whats good forn them
---
You have to be able to bring either A) 1:3 or B) 1:1 odds to the fight with the enemy if you are A) flying the better doctrine or capital escalating, or B) flying a trading doctrine with some kind of grid control like a fortizar 
---
Anything less than that and you're just going to get locked out of all fights with any sort of real consequence by 3x however many nerds you have
---
Epic fights by the looks of it =)
---
There was never a time when people were in relatively the same ships, at all.  
---
I can go through and cited examples in every war in the games history where one side had better ships than the other, and like band of brothers, that didnt mean they won, because what your tiny pea sized brain doesnt get is that it's not always about the ships.
---
I'm okay with all of these.    
---
While we want new players to be able to catch up we also need to keep something left to strive for. I understand every new player can't wait to jump into the endgame, I would feel the same. But if you've ever played a private MMO server that has set 10000x experience you realize that often it's about the journey and not the destination.
---
I also like how you seem to think you're the only person to ever bring these sorts of things up. Have you looked through the thousands of posts on the forums and reddit over the years? Even that ex-CSM who spoke out after the NDA expired mentioned how little impact they or anyone else has on the game. The devs don't listen and just shoot down the majority of ideas. Worth a read if you can find it, have very little faith in CCP.
---
The last paragraph is truly the best though. You really couldn’t leave a negative comment on that damn survey.
---
There are a lot of Dinos here where my fellow winter co bros at lol
---
hi friend - great to hear you're getting fun stuff in bdo. in eve it would depend on who you ask but there is some cool stuff happening where we have new ships to put on these new lasers that we can use to hurt people! have a great day
---
Tanoo Primium Forum Publicae will provide the focal point for the defense of New Eden

Oh god you've brought out all the fucking fuckers who love to hate the game with this post. Most of the people who play eve in null sec are fucking wimps, to feel hard they all go and stand next to the biggest kid in the playground, then you end up with massive entities that can fuck everyone else in the arse. You fucked the game for yourselves. Not looking at you SkillU, i barely know anything about you, it's all the other whiners in this thread.
---
You don't think there is variety in Frig V?  There is tons!  and it is fun!
---
The Frig line has never been so relevant and diverse.  So many to choose from.  Assault Frigs are good again.  Different types of EWar allow you to tilt the tide of battle.  And great tacklers are worth their weight in Contaminated Lorentz Fluid.  Not to mention most of the pirate and navy frigs have real roles, as opposed to a lot of the cruiser variants.
---
Even the miners get some great frig mining vessels.
---
The core thing to enjoy EVE is to finds a group to fly with, can be a corp, can be an informal group can be an NPSI. [CCP Ghost's presentation at EVEsterdam](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/400419490?t=01h44m26s) showed this abundantly clear. A few alpha pilots in T1 ships can kill a high SP player in a bling fit ship. Cooperation is the name of the game.
---
Rather than grind to pay for Omega I would  focus on enjoying everything that an Alpha can offer, and it is a lot. When you have maxxed out that Alpha you can consider Omega. Fun per hour will always beat ISK per hour.
---
it really depends on what you want to do friend, and what you currently do. maybe you want to put a bunch of racial ship V's in there? Logi V or recon V if you fly subcaps? Maybe JDC5 if you want to get into capitals? T2 triage/siege if you're already flying caps? Titan/Carrier V if you've got a ship you love already? have a good day friendo
---
The main difference was for the Yule lads you got all of the rewards. For the 16th anniversary they went with the carrot on a string approach.
---
lol I literally unsubbed and don't play now. say what you want but I was hosed for no fucking reason despite logging in everyday. the publisher of this game is unethical and i'm not paying for other players to have unfair advantages over me.
---
Honestly, the ideal ratio would be 1 or more per fleet member - you are entirely at the mercy of what the hunters can find, so the more you have the higher the chance of content goes up.
---
Lost for words.
---
That is much appreciated.  
---
Thank you
---
Well I formed my post so it wouldnt just be a carbon copy of another thread I asked for genuine conversation and seem to be getting none.
---
I never said I have faith in CCP thats hilarious. Them do anything right.. Haha
---
I havent seen much of it due to simply not caring about the CSM its a joke, largest alliance wins simple as that. I voted once since I joined in 2012.
---
All I can say is if CCP dosent start listening they are going to have a dead game on their hands. I dont think Eve can survive in a cap meta and expect to be accessible or even fun. tidi fights are anything but fun.
---
The side with n will always complain about the ship the side with n+1 uses.  See: Ferox in Perimeter.

I see your point and im mot saying they shouldn't exist but your dodging my point of them being super afkable. But its fine. I think ive had enough eve trolls today.
---
Right, I don't buy it.
---
The chip on your shoulder is pretty apparent in this conversation.  Try going a post without "grr null, grr block, grr coalitions". Also, rorquals are only afkable if you want rats to come wipe out drones every 15-20 minutes. If you want to eat a 500m-1b loss every 20 minutes for being afk go for it.
---
Oh wow, where was this?I didn’t know they rainbowed their social media stuff.
---
Say that I wanted to be a miner on one character and a Pirate Hunter on another character, would it be practical/ possible to do that or should I just stick to one character and not split up my account.
---
Also if I did use 2 characters could I play both at the same time on different computers
---
If you want to be able to do the things that are behind the Omega wall, it's almost certainly a good idea to pay for it for a few months. Grinding the (currently) 2 billion ISK for a month is not going to be fun.
---
If you haven't found things that frustrate you yet about being an alpha then you can stay alpha until you start to feel restricted by it.
---
Unless they've seriously nerfed rorquals in the last couple months, they are *not* as weak as carriers.
---
I've never seen a carrier solo tank 120 cruisers, but I *have* seen a rorqual do it.
---
I'll update the ticket... fortunately, the GMs saw this post and have started progressing it so it shouldn't be a long wait.
---
Then use siren unless you have someone else holding tackle like a dictor or hic
---
Spaceship Barbie was a famous eve scammer with a ridiculously large bounty on their head.  Google her!
---
Dude ! How do you display ship's name and speed ?
---
Prime example of the type of garbage posts that should be removed from this sub.
---
To a point, no. If EVERYONE leaves, then yeah it matters. Otherwise no, you'll be replaced.
---
"piloting\Ship management is WAY more important than SP level. always has always will be. 90% of eve is knowledge\skill 9% SP and 1% luck."
---
This is why there is so much of a problem with Titans/caps.  There isn't enough variety or coutnerplay with them.  There is no subcap that shows up and makes your Titan fleet FC say "oh fuck...  point THAT guy" like they do with some ewar, webber, recon, bubbler, logi, boosher, etc.
---
Because when you went to log in on the last day.. it was the day after the last day and you missed a day.
---
I've been playing for longer than I'd care to admit yet I've still yet to step foot in null sec. I've done a little poking around low sec but null scares still. What's the best way I can get there and set myself up to stay there? Thanks
---
I would say join a corp that operates in null.
---
Depended on the size of the gangs and the skill of the pilot. They could range tank.
---
Blobs + lag. If you stop rending the shapes and textures of ships, it would be easier on your PC.
---
In the US it is common practice for company's to request verification of ownership by photo of government issued ID like a driver's license and also a photo of a credit card that was used for the purchase. Some may request both.
---
Ztickboard.
---
I was usually the logi FC, so I was pre-locked by half the logi and the other half would lock the FC.
---
Generally, any important service will also offer other more manual verification options.
---
Like blizzard has you send in photos of IDs and such
---
\^This is also highly refined salt of the finest quality.  The perspectives of folks in this game are as varied as teh gameplay itself.
---
You can play two characters at the same time if they are on two different omega accounts. If they are on the same account they cannot be logged in at the same time and you need a multiple pilot training certificate to skill them both simultaneously, which is cheaper than 2 accounts but only marginally. If you plan on piracy on your main you will probably want the alt one way or another for logistics since your pirate character will likely gey wardecced or lose too much sec status to exist in hisex.
---
A few zkill features are having issues lately along with the site being a bit unstable. I imagine /u/Squizz is working on things.
---
You should force it to do the one where it has you press "yes" on your phone.
---
I’m assuming, judging by your comments, you don’t actually have any experience nor any idea about these topic of conversations.
---
Not a great example tbh literally every alliance capable of forming more than 20 dudes has had a ferox doctrine for the past year or 2 (and machariels before nerf, and jackdaws, sometimes even harpies). Solid point overall, but it's especially pronounced in the case of titans and supers because there's no diversity of counters. N+1 is terrible gameplay at its core.
---
Thank you for demonstrating an example.
---
Jocko mo feeno witcha ah nah nay
---
The invasion content is not contained within the invasion areas. The power creepers can go anywhere.
---
Agreed, I find having the intel at the ready to be so more effective. Had to give my wife her monitor back unfortunately for her to play.
---
I’ve found that it’s the initial adrenaline rush that I have to overcome and then the shakes go away through the fight process,
---
This sounds very similar to cerebral accelerators. Now, I’m not much of an expert of skill training mechanics (because fuck attributes), but how would these skill injectors differ from a temporary attribute bonus, barring any drug modifiers that affect accelerators.
---
Continuing beyond EVE, I only made two friends in EVE. 
---
There were many friendly acquaintances.
---
Eve has always been, and will always be dying.
---
I’m having fun, the people I play with are having fun and we are making it in a wormhole.
---
Everyone can complain about supers, injectors, and plex all day long, I sub one account every other month, and between building and selling stuff, getting rare gas, and relic sites I keep two accounts omega.
---
So I think everyone who complains doesn’t know what they are doing.
---
You and me both, two kids and a wife now prohibit those sorts of activities lol
---
Authy - it replaces google authenticator and you can have multiple devices (including PC) using it with the same account. If you lose your phone, as long as you remember the authy password you still have access to all those 2FA's.
---
Big thanks to the DevOps guy that introduced me to this app. It was a big help administering servers with 2FA required.
---
CCP has implemented so many changes demanded by the community. Major changes, citadels and the triglavian invasion being some recent. Htfu and login for 2 minutes to click claim.
---
You haven't been to Delve recently have you?  We are already at Step 3 there.
---
It said Facebook so... Facebook? And I saw they're Google social media page was rainbow as well
---
I'd only want one too so ridiculous hot drops like a bunch of combat ventures
---
I had a feeling it was going to be like this, I’m considering fielding prospects for hunters. From what I read prospects are less suspicious than a t3c.
---
Is this an unironic post?
---
Hey now, alpha exploration is fine money. Cloaks are for cowards anyway.
---
tbh if I see a prospect I instantly think "hunter". IMO it doesn't really matter - if they see a neutral they will start docking up. The best bet is cloaky camping.
---
I have never been bothered and if you look through my post history, I deliberately refuse any Skill Point gifts.
---
I have, its pretty nuts. But still waiting on CCP to say anything about it.
---
"Unfair" in the sense of a community built on hazing new members being forced to quit the hazing.
---
OK, "built on hazing" is maybe too strong, but when hazing is part of the induction to a community, it's *very* difficult to get rid of. See IRL the training of doctors in the US for example. The way interns and residents are treated is clearly suboptimal but the attitude of "they should HTFU and suffer the way *I* did" on the part of established doctors is basically the reason it continues, even though it causes negative outcomes for patients.
---
IMO they are fine.  People whine like crazy it’s too late to change them seriously and without them this game would have absolutely no way for new players to catch up.
---
Fair point, luckily we’re not ready for blops, so we will have a chance to test out our covops skills before we bring out the blops
---
The battle procs keep on giving.  More salt! More tears!
---
Anyone smart enough to figure out why umbrellas formed to start with has already figured this out. The only thing posting about it here is going to do is illicit negative responses from people who don't understand that outlining why something is isn't an endorsement of that thing existing.
---
Not if you are hunting supers.   You will never get enough warp disruption out of sirens.  Then again the bubble launchers bubble is only active for a very short time frame
---
Oh god bless another fucking essay from an armchair dev.
---
The only way I can see this working is if they are doing PI, Wormhole exploration, Moon mining, and playing the market with a little industry on the side. Further, that individual has either been playing for a while and is familiar with the market, or has had outside help.
---
EVE players used to largely be made of people with advanced technical skills, I don't like thinking that they would waste time on Farcebook and Twatter.
---
"Injector fatigue" that causes diminishing returns on injectors, with a cooldown that gets exponentially longer with each million SP that gets injected?
---
Discord, everyone playing the meta game and not logging in.
---
But you are still reading about Eve - wishing you hadn't...   We know....
---
Can be done with magnets...and you would be able to ship spin too!  Patent pending!
---
I would hope that you would put more investment into a super than that. I still only fly shitfit T3Ds and even i am starting to understand the value of putting at least the value of the hull into fittings.
---
congrats   keep up the good work
---
The difference is that its a fixed value. You are guaranteed to get 512k SP worth from an injector, all it does is reduce your training time, in an easy to understand digestible method. There is no unallocated SP, you just apply it to your queue and remove up to half of each skills SP. 
---
A cerebral accelerator, the problem is that new players may not understand the attribute system and how to actually make use of it. So they might be mapped incorrectly with no implants, and if you just give them x2 training for X Days you're actually giving them much less. Since this system is for better or worse ultimately tied to PLEX which is a real life currency, you need to give it a fixed value. In my eyes at least.
---
This also gives players the chance to train bigger skills much faster, but it costs significantly more to do so the bigger the skills are, from their perspective. Even though in reality, they're spending just as much to halve skill time doing this as they would be if they injected a new carrier alt halfway.
---
Now I want a rainbow skin.
---
Am newbro, plexed subcap skills up to a few cruisers (and smaller stuff) can confirm. 
---
There’s a huge difference between character skill and player skill. If I undock a blingy ship, I’m probably just creating content for a better player. 
---
Mostly I still fly frigates. I can afford to lose loads of those.
---
Did something happen to the water supply this week?
---
Effectively the same deal, but in practice it changes the total points to learn a skill rather than affect how many points you get a minute
---
I use keepass as well for all my passwords and love it but where are you going to put in your MFA seeds? I have google authenticator and authy but would like to back those up on keepass in case my phone went for a swim
---
Tbh, its one of the better ideas.
---
Though granted, on this sub, that's not a high bar
---
I know I know, I know that after the past few days this is how much of this would be received. I'm aware and I agree in many respects.
---
Sometimes I think its good to at least put the opinion out there. I experience the same thing with my job, and every year at our surveys I still write like 10000 words explaining so much stuff because everyone at my work sees it at the end of the day. The boss will see it, and be like meh whatever, but its about EVERYONE else seeing it. And then going hmm yea ok I like that, I show support! This is how stuff ultimately changes in a positive way, when you provide all of the info for the people in charge, all of the solutions and a clear list of cause and effect. 
---
Sometimes the guy in charge doesn't always have a clear opinion on something because he's the one making those decisions to start with. 
---
Even more so though, this kinda post is directed towards those people who have influence, and who can speak to "the boss". If even one CSM talks to CCP and can give them a different perspective on how their choices have changed EVE, and what did it... along with ANY kind of solution to it? 
---
Thats important. The way to get there is by providing your input, whether its positive or negative.
---
Some day, eventually, society will finally tire enough of the blight of asshat "hackers" and we'll revert back to good old-school punishment like whomping their hands off...
---
But how will I be able to pay $$$ to get a rorqual alt trained up in one hour
---
Your suggestion is a good one and it would help fix the game. But it won’t make CCP money.
---
^ This pretty much sums up this game, "salt farming" similar to games like Dota and LoL with trolls and raging kids, except it's a 30+ y.o. neckbeard...
---
As somebody with IRL commitments that I have to fit Eve into, #3 is one that rings my bell. I'm a lot more likely to show up for your ping if I can be confident that I can do so without causing, say, spouse aggro.
---
You can just do the tutorials on the old.charscters
---
Skill injectors are good for the game. They are also good for CCP because they get more  money to spend on developing EVE further into the future.
---
skill injectors isn't the problem
---
local is
---
local has caused the massive nullsec explosion of multiboxing and botting
---
that would be something new, which requires dev time. 
---
my proposal would just mean changing a few numbers so that you hit the 150k sp/injector at 25m SP instead of  80m SP. 
---
Really the fact that you can still get even 300k/injector up to 80m is insane. Most vets have specialized alts that never even get close to 80m SP, making the diminishing returns nothing more than theater to make people believe they're not P2W.
---
Easy, just break up your super blocs.
---
Because like every good rage quitter, they still shit up r/Eve
---
Except that's human nature.
---
CCP puts stuff in place to incentivize risk, but players optimaoze the risk away.
---
Would having each ship that jumps take damage every time they jump work?  That way local jumps would still work since the damage would not be so bad, but jumping across the galaxy would dam near destroy the ship.  Maybe even make some kind of damage multiplier so that the more ships that jump the cyno the greater the damage.
---
&gt; To a point, no. If EVERYONE leaves, then yeah it matters.
---
you do get that if a small fraction of a population that rely on itself to enjoy the game leave then it's a massive loss for the remaining of that population right ? And no it's not going to be "replaced", the game is slowly loosing players, not gaining. The faster the loss, the worst it is.
---
&gt; Also, since it's a sandbox, expectations that thing's won't change are unreasonable.
---
Yes, expectation of things changing are fine as long as they don't make things more boring or unfair, and if it is that it should be fix within a few months. That's the expectation that people have of change.
---
Absolutely, I agree. Take EVE into the future!
---
Except then they'd just make different alliances and blue each other.
---
Oh for sure. I actually love the idea of a heavy bomber good vs caps or even a second type of anti cap bomb, or torps or SOMETHING That should be decent against them thats sub cap sized. They have bosons why cant we use bombs against them.. Fuck the delete shit argument titans do just that with bosons. 
---
Idk.. Eve is in a weird spot right now every one has a capital or 5.. And no reason to deploy to kill anything.
---
We.

Are.

Not.

(In a long term sense)
---
So I just wrote up a long-version of what I'm about to write here, but reddit ate that comment, so I apologize for the new abbreviated version.
---
Safely traveling with a webber assumes that you can get your freighter into warp before a bump mach can bump you. Once a bump mach bumps you, it's game over for the freighter, because they can bump you indefinitely. 
---
In my situation the guy didn't even kill me, but bumped me the full 24 hours until the contract ran out for the courier and failed the contract to get the collateral.
---
I had always assumed that if my webs land on my freighter immediately then I would be able to get into warp safely. However, if the webs land on your freighter the same server tic as a scam, then the next server tic doesn't let your freighter warp.
---
I loaded the system sitting on a gate facing an instalock ibis fit with a long point and a bump mach. As soon as I dropped gate cloak on my freighter and webbed, the ibis landed his point. This was a 0.5 system, so the 12s or so for concord to arrive was just enough time for the bump mach to bump me. 
---
It was basically a perfect shitstorm of being on a small gate, so everybody decloaked near each other due to the distances varying based on gate size, plus it was a large size contract which prevented an agility fit freighter, plus it was a 0.5 system for slowest concord response time, plus he was fast enough to land the point, plus he was able to camp me for the full 24 hours bumping me until the contract ran out. 
---
He lost the ibis, but no big deal, because he got a 10b courier collateral out of it after the courier contract expired. It took five different factors working together perfectly to take me down, so my hat is off to the guy who finally got me.
---
shit on my face and call me jokastis
---
The funny thing is that when people say, "I've been hacked!" in the cases where they didn't just give their password to someone, it is usually correct.
---
Not the server hacked.
---
Not the PC hacked.
---
In most cases of accounts being compromised, it is because the user failed. The most common method is where they use the same password(s) across many sites. 
---
* Re-using passwords into untrustworthy sites (yes, some of them have certificates)
---
* Re-using passwords on high user or high value targets (Yahoo's breach, for example)
---
* Trusting other player's third party sites with your game account passwords. (Alliance forums, either sharing passwords in private conversations or just by having them harvested from the forum's user and password database.)
---
There are some incredible password vaults. Use them.
---
Doesn't this change just better protect ratting carriers?
---
Great for paying for your t1 frigate hobby, not great at making 2b without spending too damn much time
---
&gt; Travel: Ares, its the best ceptor.
---
Malediction says "nope." Does everything Ares does, with another 1K EHP by the time you've got it fitted.
---
If you changed blops cynos as mentioned, ratting carriers just get safer
---
My thannatos because i put all my favourite ships inside it.
---
&gt;The idea behind a change like this is that it removes the idea of instant gratification
---
And that is why such changes will never come to be, CCP know or at least suspect (they have brains right, one can hope at least) that humans simply L.O.V.E. instant gratification, that's why most of us play games in the first place, so such a mechanic helps their bottom line...
---
Best I can tell you is get an abbadon, load each gun up with a different crystal and then fire away at something. Rainbow lasers!!

The original e-mail as an attachment, to the Indian fraud department, can help. It has the headers, which can then be used in a request to the e-mail server, in order to disclose the user's IP address or any multi-factor authentication that might help in tracing them.
---
Skill injectors should just have horrible long side effects after multiple uses
---
[Sim Jacking](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqax3/hackers-sim-swapping-steal-phone-numbers-instagram-bitcoin) often makes breaching accounts easier than not having 2FA.
---
I command whole fleets of miner alts with a joystick on my feet and in each of my hands a seperate controller.
---
I believe FC said "dont jump", which contains the word "jump" so I jumped
---
In the past accelerator events that were doing by low SP players worked well. They had the option to use them, or sell them and make some pretty good isk. Experience players had the isk and would buy them for accelerated training. It was a win/win.
---
No I'm having fun because I just left legacy and made a new wormhole corp (recruiting btw) with a few friends of mine. Eve is what you make of it. Take risks, build your own sandcastles, go play in the sandbox instead of just being a linemember and whining on Reddit.
---
I’m only now training any laser skills to make full use of our doctrine Strat fit, I’ll have to do that one day with a Armageddon or whatever Amarr BC fits a full rack of guns.
---
congrats, keep it up -- it can get hard but it's not worth throwing away
---
referencing the smug posting in this thread
---
I was in Querious and now in drones. Thanks for everything. See you again!
---
Right, and I think most any normal person would understand that. No matter what, EVE **IS** a money game to CCP, and I understand that. I truly do believe that there is more money in people actually enjoying the game though, just like I believe there is more productivity done when people enjoy their job. 
---
Its one and the same, and CCP just needs to hear it, whether its from a stupid reddit post, or a bunch of reddit posts that stick with a CSM who talks to just 1 employee who brings it up at the next meeting. Maybe it gets shot down, maybe it doesn't but that's not whats important. Its about utilizing the skills and abilities we have as players to at least try to make a change in a game that we all like and want to enjoy playing. 
---
This isn't call of duty, I can't go find another sandbox space MMO where I can do anything I want to other players including stealing their shit, burning it to the ground and have it all be tied to my own reputation. We only have one EVE Online proper, because every time there's ever been something "like" it, it doesn't have the same kind of spark that has made people keep this dumbass game alive for 16 years, writing essays on forums and reddits about how to fix it.
---
You might feel that way but you have lost out. I have never met one new player even after a few years in null come out and know much about this game. What these "newbro"  null groups do is for themselves and not for player retention. You skipped highsec, lowsec, Wh etc and went right to late or end game game play. You miss out on the funnest part of the game as well as developing your own play style etc. Player retention in most cases is reliant on a players ability to be self sustaining and NullNewBeans never gain that. Proof is the server number ever sense "newbro" null groups proliferated.
---
" but I am a bit hesitant to shell out real money when I can wait long enough to buy Plex using ISK . " Right now a month of game time is going for 2.1 billion or more depending on when you buy it.  That's a lot of money for an alpha to grind and it only gets you 30 days. If you want to go omega, paying the 15$ with a credit card on their site is a lot more viable than paying 2.1 bill every 30 days unless you have some secret way of grinding 2.1 bil a month as an alpha account/ young omega account.
---
More like thats what he said...
---
The easiest way to make large amount of isk as an alpha is VNI ratting its boring and takes forever, Omegas have the option to carrier/super/titan ratting as well as barge/exhumer/rorq mining all of which make a lot more than a VNI running sites does. And the PI skills can be trained as an alpha but not to a point where you can start making real money doing it.
---
You can plex your account with defensive factiln warfare. You get roughly 2000isk/lp. It takes around 10 hours + time which it takes to sell the items in jita. Markee dragon has youtube videos about this way of making money. Also exploring with heron in nullsec is good money. Make 100mil a day (about 1-3 hours a day) and you can plex your account. Get into corp which owns lots of nullsec space so you can really explore.
---
As far as HS content, neutral logi is one of the biggest mistakes made. It was used to save freighters from getting ganked and was the only effects counters to ganking. There is a list of other HS changes, unfortunately i dont have the time to list and proof read atm.
---
I would rather use my small window to talk about skill injectors. You keep using “skill points advantage” as a reason why I don’t like them. You’re incorrect.
---
First, didn’t spawn in the game with a skill point advantage. I started with lvl 1 missions being my tutorial to eve. I started where you had to move each scan prob individually to scan signatures. I started with less SP, skillbooks, and skills then what is provided today. On top of that, i had to pay to play. It took me almost 40 days to figure out i had to que and buy skills. Which btw had a 24hr limit.
---
After figuring out that hurdle along with how to get standings, travel, use my overview, market, buy a ship, fit (which is being improperly used) a ship. I attempted to pvp around my 2-3 month mark. I like most noobs wanted to use big guns. I plex fitted and tank rewarding people with juice kills to pat their KB. After losing a $120 talos and raging, I decided to step back and start over. I study items on the market and my first ship was a railed and blaster catalyst. I stood in front of jita sending duel request to random ships dying constantly as i had no clue what a tornado, proteus, brutix, vindicator, vigilant, ect was. 
---
Every time i died, i slowly learned something new, i would study how i died, how treating i was to them, ect and i would have a “do not fuck with list”. I learned how to look for other frigs/destroyers and research players using corp history tab in game. I got my first solo kill in a railed catalyst vs a vengeance. I learned to only duel other frigs and destroyers, i then learned about me killing an ass frig for my first kill and how it was a fluke. So, i put t2 frigs along with faction frigs on my “do not fuck with” list.
---
During this learning experience, i meet people and they introduce me to lowsec. They told me about FW and gave me advice about Gallente frigs. It was here that i tailored my entire skill que to frigs. After months on FW pvp inside novices. I had a decent knowledge not only how to fit my ship, but how enemies fitted, my strengths, weaknesses, tactics, ect. I trained into an enyo and literally just transfer my incursus fit. I was around 5mil sp at this point and was capable of taking down pilots who had more sp than I. With friends, we did wonderful pvp together. Later on i tried crusiers and hated them, they were slower, had worst tracking, died faster over my enyo. It took me a good 3 months to learn that larger ships were at a disadvantage in speed and agility but if flown properly, were amazingly  rewarding.
---
All that is gone now, skilled pvp is extremely rare, small gang is almost unheard of. Majority of Eve players can’t figure out how to fit a ship properly. Even most alliance fitting are trash. People whine we they lack to knowledge to counter a certain setup. What does the devs do? They make it easier and cater weak and lazy. They give you sp so you can sit in endgame ships and not have to learn 1% of the amazing game mechanics of eve. They give game breaking mechanics so you can protect your assets while you crab hard.
---
please tell me how "every blackops/capital can jump/bridge into a system without a cyno being required" makes ratting carriers safer?  
---
You could even shotgun tackle bombers over a constellation on wh exit.  
---
The super umbrella fleet also can't go directly to the carrier/rorqual, they have to use one of the default points (thats where you put the bubble) or hope they have a pirate point
---
What somebody elsethread said: if you just started, Omega doesn't do anything for you *right away* because you're still training Alpha-eligible skills for a couple of months anyway.
---
Yeah, I stopped reading when I got there. Clueless.
---
Two part question: I was relic hunting in nullsec, when I was understandably murdered. Said murderer was a kind killer and sent me a message noticing it was my first PVP death and some isk. First, how did they look my user name up to find that out? And two: How did they find me? I get they were cloaked, and while warping and relic solving I was not.  But I was spamming d-scan at wide ranges, and saw nothing. No probes, no ships, etc.
---
i dont PVP in cap's no and i dont fly a Rorq cuz they are so expensive. i was being sarcastic in my last reply, i apologize. from my numbers 650 dps with mediocre to good drone skills is way less than a carrier with shit skill. im not screaming to nerf it i just want to know why its broken. its DPS was never an issue with me, merely panic and afk ability. i guess i've realized they aren't as afk able as i thought but they are still pretty sit and forget compared to Barges that half a third of the yield at best.. 
---
i can see as long as you have a window moniter software such as EVE - O or ISBoxer  they are still pretty "afk" able in the sense as long as you can see your locked to your drones and they haven't takedn dmg your fine keep "ignoring" it. 
---
its not as easy as a Retri where you can literally step away for 5 mins and probably come back to either a Wreck from rat's which hardly matters or

" Requiring the brainlet to click excavator modules fighter-style to mine  means said brainlet can no longer stroke its dick while simultaneously  acquiring minerals with 10 Rorqs. "

You've never actually flown a rorq have you? Those rocks last more than long enough to cycle through your screens and control a dozen or more rorqs without much issue.
---
What are you talking about?
---
The proposed changes are that cynos take time to spool up.

Giving time for a safety fleet to form while the blops wait around.

Telll me moar!

That was great, my thanks!

Because CCP is such a wildly successful development company that isn't totally reliant on one singular product which has been accelerating in decline over the last 5 years.  
---
Too bad they didn't have skill injectors on initial release, it truly would have made the game much more successful and developed the community early on into the correct mindset - money GOOD!! satisfaction for actually achieving a challenging goal and feeling like you actually accomplished something BAD!!
---
obviously at twitter
---
&gt; Most vets have specialized alts that never even get close to 80m SP
---
*fires up evemon to look at alts' SP*
---
Good point.
---
Personally I have no dog in the fight: I've never used an injector or extractor, and for all I care they could take them out of the game altogether. But I do feel for the newbros, remembering what a slog it seemed to get that first set of T2 guns.
---
You can fly alone and join more adhoc groups
---
Still looks better than CCP's attempt.
---
" because 80% of the player base is in nullsec. " Might want to check those numbers again. CCP has released player counts on more than one occasion and nullsec is nowhere near 80% of the total player base.

I already lost a Nyx

&gt;i dont PVP in cap's no and i dont fly a Rorq cuz they are so expensive. 
---
Translation: I have no experience whatsoever with what I am talking about.
---
What if they put them.on a new special t2 battleship?
---
I mean, would you prefer rock-paper-scissors gameplay where fights would never happen because the outcome is decided beforehand? I understand the frustration over N+1 with titans, but complaining that the fleet of 50 BCs will lose to the fleet of 100 is silly.
---
Neut strat best strat but lazers are always fun
---
I think you mentioned one of the main problems, infinite anomaly respawning. Injectors aren't really a problem unless they're facilitating ridiculous scaling of income. Botting hurts the game, but not nearly as much if it can't harvest infinite resources at a rate far beyond real human endurance. Goons probably shouldn't be able to support their massive titan fleet and alliance size with just one region even if they exploit it very well.
---
I think null sec pve should maybe receive a little bump to profitability but a huge decrease in grindability. Keep the space worthwhile to hold, let real players grind less for their isk, don't let bots and multiboxers scale to ridiculous levels with unlimited resources.
---
if you want to play an unlimited trial, stay alpha.
---
if you want to play the full game, sub your account.
---
If you decide you want to stick with it, a suggestion:
---
attempting to plex an account as an alpha through ingame currency is a surefire way to burn yourself out.
---
I always recommend new players pay for their sub for the first few months. This removes the pressure of  "i have to make enough isk for plex!", (which is extremely difficult to do as a new player)  and allows you to focus on learning and having fun.

hey guys, been a rough week all around, a lot going on right now, trying to get back into eve, which is hell given my ADHD, but the game is so fun i keep trying, got an appointment to see about getting back on my meds on tuesday, wonder if that will turn me into a trade speadsheet machine, either way im sure it will allow me to retain focus on things like this game a bit more
---
At least in subcaps you have anchoring, booshes, EWAR and adjusting position with warps to add a modicum of player skill into the equation. Dreadbombs? Hit jump, press F1 repeatedly. You're locked in and can't be booshed, ECM'd, dont even need to anchor.
---
Of course you're looking at skillu they fall into that.
---
Oh and whining post about a whining post
---
&gt; tens of thousands of new supers and super pilots
---
 no
---
Maybe like a t2 battleship that shoots a bomb, with maybe 50-100km range and it does huge damage to the exact ship it hits.
---
So a well coordinated fleet could do a single run and kill multiple capitals, but also small groups can do targeted hits on single ones?
---
take it as you want. i dont like losing big toys and i HATE tidi fights. so i have an observers experience with some dabbling on SISI.
---
i never said i knew everything or even hinted that i flew one i believe i say in my OP that i dont have a Rorq because they are to expensive. altho i do have a Ratting Nid. which i honestly hate flying and would rather SB Rat or fly in Wh space.

have a good day.

Its the best game community Ive ever found. We'll mercilessly kill each other's ships in one sided fights (and the game would be boring otherwise imo) but actual toxicity is really low. Most people are happy to help if you ask. In wormhole space its not rare st all to kill each other one day and team up the next. Toxic people exist but in way smaller numbers. Just keep your critical thinking cap on when isk and assets are involved because scamming is still an eve tradition.
---
My man, you can post whatever you want. This is Reddit.
---
I appreciate your opinion though, and I appreciate you bumping the topic up the feed.
---
I dropped my phone in the bath and it died almost immediately. This meant I couldn't access Eve for about 12 hours until CCP un-2FA'd my account. I then re-2FA'd it to a new phone.
---
In other words even if you are very unlucky it is very minimal disruption compared to losing your account(s) and/or your account(s) getting absolutely fucked.
---
p.s. there is also a code you can store physically (like write down on a card near your PC) from google which you can use to restore your authenticator in case you drop your phone.
---
Do you prefer scheduled events on your calendar than last minute fleet roams? Last minute roams can be fun but due to RL commitments I find having at least one scheduled event to look forward to.
---
your a real smart ass aren't you. you damn well know most of the player base is in nullsec. you know this discussion only matters to nullsec maybe a bit of Deadsec. Rorq's aren't a thing in Wh's for the most part. 
---
so for argument sake yea 80% of the player base is in nullsec as defined of this discussion.
---
Yikes, I would recommend talking to someone in BRAVE about how to fit your super! Firstly don't mix shield and armor, and don't put active tank on a super.
---
Bhaalgorn. Great damage at any range, neuts, web, and energy turret master race.
---
If you’re tag holds true, what do you find to be the most effective way to scan down a target after entering a wormhole?
---
" Delve is  overpopulated and with each new player it is overpopulated even more.  That's why they decided to attack north. More space = more players in  coalition and more space for renters. "  
---
This is 100% not why we went north, we have PB and Fountain for people to live in who are not imperium and Delve is more than enough for us to live off of.  
---
" Even if all other entities, like legacy, wc, panfarm, nc... unite goons are still more powerfull.  "  
---
If legacy and panfam united we would be outnumber close to 2:1 that's more than  a "fair fight"  
---
Your entire post is a dumpster fire.
---
Kills are (usually) automatically posted at [zkillboard.com](https://zkillboard.com) Since this was a relic site, he could have scanned it, warped, cloaked and waited for someone to come.
---
if the majority of people were not having fun they would leave and the blocs would dissolve, but they instead continue to grow, meaning the people complaining are the vocal but meaningless minority.
---
truth hurts?  at least you had a year of running a botter rental program!  Congrats!
---
Thanks a lot buddy ! Will give a look ! Fly safe o7
---
OP lost me when he said legacy + panfam wouldn't be enough to challenge goons even though that would give them the bigger super and titan fleet + a 2:1 numbers advantage. This whole post was a poorly thought out eve is dying whine.
---
we already have all the space we could possible use in cloud ring, fountain, period basis, and delve. All the assumptions you make are incorrect, your viewpoint makes me wonder if you have even lived in nullsec.

I don’t know you.. you don’t have my snap

Best estimate based off year old numbers is 500,000 players. There are just over 104,000 in the nullsec blocks, so your 80% is so far off the actual number of around 20% that its actually funny.
---
That's the point, really. Defending 5 anchoring fortizars deep in enemy territory is a lot harder than defending one anchoring fortizar. Or you put them one by one. Invasion should be step by step process. One single fortizar should not hold the entire supercap fleet of a coalition.
---
Argggg the fit!!! At least full every slut eventhought with a bad fit.
---
Dude, I hope shit gets sorted, but CCP Security are notorious douche canoes, but always hope!!
---
well, generally you either have strategic goals, or kill oriented goals. Snagging good kills, roaming specific systems, planting astras/raitarus, your goals are determined by what you want to do.
---
I include the cost of implants and boosters.
---
I've generally found that putting in core skills to V is always a nice pay-off. Like having core gunnery / missile skills across the board at all V is nice to have, because then you just need to train the actual weapon + specialization skill.

Don't forget to plug in +5's before you leave to maximize the return.

I roll holes with a prober, interdictor, orthus and carrier. I always find somebody ratting and I check adjacent wormholes for lowsec/nullsec ratters too. If the chain is ugly I just rinse &amp; repeat. If it gets spicey I always got the boyz to help out.

---
The irony of a 1 year old player telling me a 12 year old player who has spent 99% of his time out of nullsec blobs and is 1 of the top pvpers in eve
---
You mean people will stop using rorqs because you don't have a few dozen titans and supers looking out for you? Nope.   
---
I only want to balance the risk vs reward. Currently, rorqs offer tremendous rewards at little or no risk for a non-afk pilot under a super umbrella.
---
 "Gone are the times one could just hop into doxi or amarr to fit an entire ship just the way you want. It's jita or nothing. " That was always going to happen, with the way people in this game move towards centralized locations to simplify trading it was eventually going to lead to having just one mega hub once CCP put it on a node capable of handling all the players who wanted to trade. Hell as far back as 2011/2012 you could see the trade activity shifting more and more towards jita. Scammers and local sellers don't want to have to be in 4 different places to appeal to all their marks, sellers don't want to have to ship things to 4 different places and with the shipping services that exist now there is no point in buying something at a mark up in Amarr or Dox when you can buy it in jita and pay to have it shipped for less.
---
There is a very specific reason a certain bloc argues it should be called the casino war and it has nothing to do with moon money. And everything to do with the person you just named getting scammed.
---
I've been playing eve for 3 years now and I've 4 accounts with 10 characters for various roles like my main pvp toon, Indie alts, trade alts, explorer alt, freighter alt, cap alt, etc and I've never ever used or felt the need of using a skill injector. They are stupid and should be removed from the game.
---
&gt; Firstly don't mix shield and armor
---
Why not, out of curiosity? I've never flown a capital.
---
If someone wanted the thing to be a gigantic brick bait, would not tanking it to the teeth in every conceivable way be the goal so it lasts as long as possible on the field?
---
The Genie is out of the bottle.  No going back now.  I'm actually curious just how many pilots trained supers and caps via skill injecting.  If CCCP changes the skill injector feature (any change), someone's going to whine about how unfair it is.
---
If you like playing eve then yes, you'll have more fun as omega.
---
&gt;Can I use a freighter to move “packaged” ships? What about using a shuttle to get there, repackaging the shuttle and carrying the shuttle home in the new ship?
---
Yes. Everything has a size, and if it fits in the cargo you can do it.
---
Well, he's not flying it for bait. By mixing the tank types you don't actually gain much tank, and you either lose mids for Ewar/cap mods, or lose lows for DPS. Secondly having shield tank wouldn't make difference to how tank a super is under FAX reps. Hope that makes sense.
---
CCP won't ever touch or rebalance Skill injectors/extractors
---
Hell it's probably the only thing keeping servers online besides medicore ship skins

Yes, don't forget to fill your sluts.

Wait. What 16th anniversary rewards? I've been out of town... is it too late?
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm an example of that not being the case.
---
yeaaa nothing in that thread even remotely tells you where people are playing.. try again? only post of Value in there is Jester's that gives 0 numbers as to WHERE players are. where did your 104,000 come from? 
---
and again i reiterate. i never even remotely said i grab that number from anywhere other than my head. so either bring me ACTUAL fact's or stop being a smart ass and nit picking my words.
---
you and i both know that the only players that matter to CCP are the voices of nullsec and the occasional Wh freak out.
---
The only problem with skill injectors is injector farming.
---
Unpopular opinion: CCP should just sell large injectors directly from the NES for something like 200 plex (yes, i'm consciously pricing the injector SP higher than the SP that would be gained overtime with an omega sub)
---
An injector farm doesn't add anything to the game except allowing older players (like me) to have more and more omega accounts that I don't hardly use.
---
Thank you for that. At least keep the issue fresh in people's minds.
---
The skills that still make me really mad are the basic fitting skills, CPU Management and Power Grid Management. They function as nothing more than a barrier to new players being able to fit out their ships. 
---
If I could do any one thing to try and improve player retention it would be to remove those two skills entirely(adjusting requirements to not need them). And if I could do two things? I'd make every skill in the magic 14 ( [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)) a rank 1 skill.
---
Well, you did kill more dreads after the titans were dropped than before, so, even if on paper, you had more fun too... =\]
---
Find a shattered wormhole while flying around (you'll even see the entry hole on your overview when you add it to overview) 
---
Go inside (rats on wormhole are very very very scary so run if you see them) 
---
Scan all the outholes inside the wormhole
---
Have fun hunting
---
Ailok is using those holes when he runs horde hunting fleet
---
Clavo is using those holes when he runs goon hunting fleets
---
There's already too little incentive for alliances to try to conquer more space than they have. Why do you think we don't want the North? Even with all of our dudes, we have plenty enough territory and taking more would be more trouble than it's worth. Big alliances used to be locked in a cycle where they'd conquer more than they could hold only to lose it when a vigorous opponent invaded. Now there's no incentive to take more than they can hold because - as we've proven - even huge alliances can prosper in a single region, so long as they're willing to build it up. CCP did that so that there would be more room for alliances to try to break into null, but it doesn't seem to have worked. Maybe if mining anomalies were removed or limited (thereby limiting the amount of ore a region could produce per day), that would change.
---
I actually like that suggestion a lot.
---
Lmfao
---
So are drag bubbles hence why you get told dont rat or mine in staging
---
That article is terrible, it makes it sound like sim jacking is some sort of hack that steals your phone number. In reality it's just social engineering and bad policies from isp helpdesk. https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/security/sim-hijacking-explained/.
---
It also doesn't affect eve's 2fa in the slightest, only 2fa that rely on SMS, which are admittedly a lot. It also doesn't make it easier, it simply skips some 2fa's they will still need your password.

It says 2017.
---
Retard alert
---
Who was Provi FC?
---
Oh no, lets Nerf Rorqs more. I really get tired of this same thing popping up. The purpose of a rorq is to make someone defend their resources when you happen to catch one. It exists to stay on the battlefield and for defenders to protect it. It is supposed to be hard to kill, but be next to useless when actually fighting. I mean, It has drone. It can't break a single Eagle with proper support. (By proper I mean 1 logi.) With 2 logi, the rorq can't kill anything. It exists to create fights.
---
There's this thing called Dotlan and it will tell you how many people are in an alliance, when you add up all the alliances living in nullsec you get around 104000.   
---
" i never even remotely said i grab that number from anywhere other than my head. so either bring me ACTUAL fact's " So you're counter argument to my mentioning of how many players there are is to flat out state you just picked numbers out of thin fucking air and then demand I come up with facts to disprove your randomly selected numbers? Are you Sarah Huckabee Sanders?
---
Skill urself v 2.0 ?
---
I'ma give you guys some content tonight I tell you hhhhwhat.
---
I didn't know that I wanted this video! ;)
---
Rorqs exists to create fights. You tackle one, wether or not you can kill it, it is suppose to illicit a defenders response. he longer it is there, the better chance you get a fight. This was CCP's answer to "Why do all the miners dock up when we roam through?" Now, they can't dock up right away and they sit there for a while allowing defenders to actually respond. Now, every whines because they do stick around and make defenders form.
---
how to be birbman?;
---
&gt; see you guys go. I never flew with you or skillu but I had mad respect for who you were and what you accomplished.
---
I hope community team makes something about it. Oh, wait...
---
Or it could be a recon ship maybe (not visible on dscan)
---
Just add a limit to the injectors. One injector per week, at max. Consuming an injector adds a 1w effect that prevents consuming more injector. The effect is not modified by any skill; on the opposite, it's amplified by the amount of SP you have. 
---
base duration  : 100H (=4d4H). 
---
each 1000 SP in your skill or unallocated increases the duration by 2s so 100M SP = 200k seconds = 55h33min =&gt; total 155h33min before the next injection.
---
best feeling ever...useless stuff gone, current stuff in the right place and future stuff stored away.
---
A better way to implement it would simply to have the skill points go into your unallocated SP, but instead of providing an instant train, when they are "applied" they simply double your training speed, i.e. whenever your normal training speed applies one SP to the skill, one SP is deducted from your pool of "applied SP" and applied to that skill as well. I think it would be simpler to code that way, rather than having changing skill multipliers.
---
So yeah I entered a c2, and found some pretty anomalous shit. 93 anomalies and sigs total. 33 sigs, 60 anomalies. Is this rare or commonplace?
---
I was like you, a bit scared of null sec and then I decided to join a null sec alliance. The game became instantly more interesting, high sec can be boring af. There's a lot of null sec corps, you will find one that suits you.
---
\&gt;  You mean people will stop using rorqs 
---
If you make the umbrella ineffective or much less effective (such that it makes a visible difference to the probability of being saved), obviously fewer people will take the risk, yes.  This is completely obvious.
---
exactly, relic sites to make a ton of isk and then gas sites to decompress.
---
Yeah same thing brought me back. Just PVP roam in t1 frigs in FW lowsec, you'll get that rush back real soon.
---
&gt;the joke is BBTB
---
My guess is that you don't understand the problem.
---
no, actually you don't
---
Not if you convert excavators into fighters and require constant interaction. 
---
A more 'sophisticated' solution so all the dumbo roleplayers can be happy too would be to revamp mining and make it more similar to ratting by requiring players to destroy larger rocks to create smaller ones that can be mined.
---
Ultimately it doesn't matter what is done as long as mining APM goes up exponentially and kills the absolutely retarded level of scaling that currently exists.
---
Humor aside, this has been an issue for many months.  At least on my end it has.  Luckily it's the only problem I have with EVE.
---
This is the problem.  What is the restore code?  How do I use the restore code?  How do I acquire the restore code? etc. etc. etc.   It's actually quite complicated for the typical computer user.   Someone saying "get the code from Github" or "backup tokens to servers" is completely ridiculous.
---
Aedun Sole though he's needed to spin new toons because of reasons so running as arkadios sol nowadays.
---
No you are likely exactly the same case....
---
Yo can i feature on the next one lol
---
If its a shattered its common. Uninhabited,meh, maybe. Inhabbited, go after the loot pinnata becuase they arent playing.
---
Weaker\* that carriers, a Rorq with perfect skills can only put out 1400 with augmented drones. Your average skilled pilot is only getting 1100 with heavies. And any pilot who knows her worth isn't using heavies to fight anyone, she is using sentries. Means a cap of 900 DPS unless you are using the short range Gardes. A Rorq is incapable of killing a t2 cruiser with any kind of competent logi on the field to defend it.
---
Yeap, but in any case he should have pre-scanned the sig, since the OP saw no probes.
---
Just make sure to make a new thread with your lossmail in the next few days.
---
you guys got room for NC. ? They are getting raped out of null
---
&gt;Not if you convert excavators into fighters...   APM goes up exponentially 
---
You'd have to make them take a lot more attention that fighters to do that, which would not make the game more engaging but rather more tedious, we do not need more reasons for people to find more parts of the game even less fun then they already do. There are ways to fix rorqs by simply lessening the amount of ore you get per cycle from excavs that would not make them any more annoying to use while still reducing the amount of rocks you can pull per hour.
---
Removing the compression would make it not enough better than the Orca to justify flying one. Same fleet hanger, same ore hold, almost the same boosting. The Rorq is better with the Siege but why waste 6 billion on a ship and fit when you can get 80% of that for 1 bill?
---
Lmao imagine putting GOTG on any list other than top ten shitshows
---
Why does this always have to be a nerf rorqs thread?  Im asking questions. Looking for answers, thank you for your response all the same. Its the first good reason to keep panic ive seen. I dont see it as a fight generator but as an industrial asset.
---
[For reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5z7Hb8kEfU)
---
Probably best mining propaganda ever made.
---
Go kill them then. Bombers bar, Init. and Test often do some whaling. I've seen PL and PH both do it to a lesser degree. Any of those groups love killing whales.
---
I saw a title with SCP on r/eve
---
Clicked in
---
disappointed
---
It generally comes out to everyone wanting to nerf them. It is a fight generator. I say make the siege 10 minutes so you can't dock when someone shows up in your area. Then you have a fight starter.
---
Yeah it's stupid, wish we could turn that off specifically.
---
Thats my point thats is far weaker than your avg ratting carrier. My skills I get like 6-700 with sents dps could arguably go up for a capital.
---
the cringe is glorious... i love it :D
---
One change I think skill injectors really need:
---
all characters on an account count towards the cap.  so if you have a 50m, 20m, and 10m sp char on same account, it will give you 150k sp/injector.
---
my god, you are good at this game
---
There is a evejobs reddit, the discord channel tied to this teddit has a recruitment channel and the eve forums have recruitment pages.   The in game corp tab has filters also.
---
To be honest, extracting SP and turning it into cerebral accelerators doesn't sound like the worst solution to this problem.
---
Almost makes me want to log in.... almost.

Just play mambo number 5 on repeat B)
---
not sure if its shattered or not. I am trash though, so the sleeper ruins and data sites are worthless to me :/
---
Why don't we just limit what skills can be injected? That seems to be the easiest solution. That way new bros can still catch up and get into cool ships and rich bittervets won't be able to create a new super pilot overnight.  If they can do it with Alpha and Omega I don't see why they can't do it with capital and sub-capital.
---
who
---
Oh, you're arfuss.
---
Hah!
---
Dude, it's ARfuss. He's an idiot.
---
It's not an indictment of Skill Urself necessarily. Just a point on how even if someone wanted to bring content to them right now, it isn't really possible as compared to other NPC or lowsec adjacent groups like Provibloc, Horde, Content ring, or Querious
---
But have you finally got your vision?
---
The cringe. If only people knew the story of “recent events in solitude” lol
---
The problem with changing speed of training is that you’re basing that off of whatever a player has for their remap, so it’s not anywhere near a fixed value. 
---
There should be no issue changing coding, because the way this would be done is that it would apply up to half of a single skill’s total required skill points, and then rolls to the next one. That’s it.  
---
Your 512,000 SP skill can receive up to 256,000 SP, and so on. Pretty simple as right now your 512k sp skill can receive 512k.
---
If you have a rooted Android phone, you can also backup your codes to a USB drive (don't put it on the cloud you dumb dumb!) or backup the Authenticator app itself with Titanium Backup and store that on a USB drive, too.

Pretty accurate except king and Warlord

For sure hmu!
---
leet pvp at it's best
---
The only reward that would do it for me would be a free gold-plated TiDi shit bucket, the one with the montage of carebear CSM’s pictures on the inner bottom.
---
Would use it once and unsub again cause Merica
---
&gt;because milennials
---
lol more like because CCP wants dank ticks
---
I don’t have any issue with this either, my solution is influenced more by my purist idealism towards EVE. Same with the ideas that revolve around limiting number of injectors used per x hours (the problem with this and why it’s not realistic is that it puts a serious cap on how much money people will spend on EVE, so it can’t happen for CCP). 
---
Either way though, a huge part of training a super /cap pilot is training all those supports which are also shared by subcaps. If you can just inject them and only have to slow train like 3-5m sp to have a T2 cap, you’re still not that much better.
---
In the current meta - yes, it is hard to make your way up as a new player, but that is more as a result of the proliferation of skill injectors than it is a sign of the age of the game. There was a time in the not-so-distant past of the game where new players were not encouraged to fly VNIs, but rifters. They were encouraged to skill into Scimitars and Oneiros, not FAX. They were encouraged to aspire to fly ships-of-the-line,  not inject their 10th Rorqual.  
---
I've started and played on dozens of characters throughout the entire span of time from when I started playing until this point. I still prefer flying ships that you can max out for all functional purposes within a month of creating a character. The raw SP bonus you get on referral makes this even easier. A brand new alpha clone can sit in a 200DPS autocannon thrasher instantly after redeeming the referral SP. That's leagues ahead of where you would have been prior to the NPE changes way back when.
---
r/evejobs, and you can use zkillboard.com to check if they pvp in your timezone
---
Stahp ruining my game CCPLZ!
---
Yea I know of him. RIP provi fleets with these kind of FCs
---
&gt;in scifi future you dont have bad eyevision
---
Tell that to Geordi LaForge.
---
There's no gate from empire to Stain...but there's definitely a gate from Stain to the dumpster.
---
what happened to the stainguy who post terrible yet thought provoking ideas?
---
its just panfamhatebonerguy rn, mediocre
---
I liked them at the start but yeah they're getting really old now.
---
It's not a ship skin or UI element so I can't see it getting any attention unfortunately
---
Eve University is a corp specifically designed for new players to help them get used to the game and get their feet wet with higher level game play. It is a bit different than WOW when choosing a corporation. Really what you want to do is get to know some people and from there network to find connections in the game and corps that fit your play style.   
---
 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main\_Page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
Yea I know.. I wasn't much a fan of SHC TBH.. I was more interested in the politics of eve vs talking on forums about best shit fits..
---
Why implying GSF and SV are different entities?
---
Putin would win
---
Well if your going to attack my random number dont do it with another random number. Your 10400 appeared random just as my 80%. My point is. You have to count those people and a good portion of hs trading alts and almost ALL of the Sp farms into that as I guarantee you they have null ties. A none null or wh player simply wont have that operation going. So il rephrase. The Majority of players are in nullsec PLAYERS not accounts.
---
So human players have trouble muliboxing carriers, so make rorquals similar. Bots have no problem with carriers or rorquals as is.
---
How else would you care to reward botting? Renters want to know.
---
Getting drunk ATM
---
Your salt is much appreciated.
---
Yeaaa longer siege is bad for wh use but I see the point.
---
Only change I would like to see is panic changed to an adc style thing but if thet will kill its fight generator use.. Idk..
---
Just put cools down timers on skill extractors and skill injectors. 48 hours, 72 hours, more, less, whatever. Don't let people pull out or inject all that SP instantaneously.
---
Denial is not just a river in Egypt
---
" Your 10400 appeared random just as my 80%.  " But it wasn't, it was based on actual numbers from actual alliances living in 0.0 and holding sov there. Unlike your comments which are entirely subjective and based off assumptions you are still making.
---
3/10, need another
---
I think, make it a base 5 minutes and tie to sov for a 100% increased duration with a fully upgraded iHub?
---
Ya the key is to find a laid back corp. The game has been around for 16 years so it's not unusual to find corps of people in their 30s-40s who have been playing since their teenage years. A lot of us have families and real-life responsibilities so we are always understanding of when members can log on to do stuff. Just find a mature group and you will find really low pressure to log in.
---
Which will stand by because there is no real way to see who and what actually has ties to null. So plz tell me that some hs guy has a 50 alt sp farm. Cuz I betcha no one in hs does so yea your damn right im making assumptions about unavailable data.
---
from the "l33t" point of view this is a win win, they get the insurance payouts and the killboards stay green.
---
I'm a big fan of the previous videos you made. Good stuff!
---
I managed to miss a day or two, still got a lot of swag :-).
---
That could be interesting and maybe spur some rorqs in other space. Which would be good.
---
yea it’s like mining but you have to be way more aware [love this vid](https://youtu.be/eyiO2fmAt2M)
---
4/10 atleast you had rigs.
---
Did you really suggest a newbie join some nullblob and mine in a venture to plex his account? Like jesus thats why the game has shit retainability.
---
OP, do not listen to this fool. There are better eays to make ISK as an alpha player, such as: exploring nullsec and lowclass wormholes; T3 Abyssals; Faction Warfare or pirate level 3 mission running; lowsec DEDs (4/10s-6/10s); and of course your "outside the box" activities like stealing or scamming, which rely on IRL social skills versus ingame SP.
---
This game should be fun and not a perpetual grind to remain subscribed.
---
A few hours real life work pays for a years omega. Fuck grinding for plex.
---
Well things like JDC5, fighters 5, Industrial Ships, etc are all month long trains which would be enough of a commitment that it would significantly slow down capital proliferation and make people think twice about spinning up a new character. You cant get rid of instant skill injectors entirely because 1) it hurts CCP's bottom line to do so 2) New bros wont see much difference in turning a 3 month train for a HAC/battleship into a 1.5 month train. The end result is they cant fly a cool ship now so they are just going to quit. 
---
The goal is to keep newbros excited about the game and not discouraged about being so far behind, while also preventing bittervets unlimited instant scalability.
---
at least there is razor alliance
---
Emperor4life flex on the haters
---
Yet. That's also the only reason its shaky design is still profitable. Well, that and really big sunk costs.
---
I think in a perfect world, this is the most ideal solution, but no matter what, this would never happen. CCP is about money and limiting injectors to a certain time frame removes that “infinite” potential of money. 
---
Besides, you actually give someone more SP/month if they can just do a new injector every 72 hours or whatever time frame than my solution. Someone who’s patient could be eating injectors in the “optimal” pattern and probably reach the same result very very quickly compared to even x2 speed slow training.
---
we dont need 3 threads about this, where are the mods?
---
also why are 300 ppl watching a fucking keepstar lmao
---
Tl;dr
---
Imagine writing a wall of text on irrelevant issue.
---
Not lack of content, not boredom and absence of reasons to log in, not balance and impact of big alliences on all other kind of activities...
---
but on things that allow to skip 6 months of not-even-worth-to-log-while-leveling-essential-skills-for-not-even-a-t2-ship.
---
Again, I don't care how much effort it takes. We don't need to introduce more burst damage by justifying it with "bUt	 iT tAkeS EfFoRt" 
---
that's a shitty argument.
---
((Bergmann))
---
Fuck off with this dumb idea. I don't care what ship you put it on. The idea of "just do more burst damage" is trash.
---
T2 battleships are even more dumb of an idea.
---
Can pipe bombing kill your entire capital fleet in 12 seconds?
---
&gt;Eh, don't try to pay for a subscription with a Venture.
---
My whole first paragraph was about NOT trying to pay for a sub with a mining venture.
---
Joining a nullsec corp is just good advice for a new person generally, and you'll make more isk whether you mine or rat.  Or follow a ratting carrier around salvaging.  Or exploring.  Or PI, or pretty much anything else.  I guess I need to list all the ways null is better or say nothing at all, eh?
---
&gt;So plz tell me that some hs guy has a 50 alt sp farm. 
---
literally anyone can run a SP farm. That's the beauty and the stupidity of it, there is no more benefit to doing it in null than doing it in highsec because all you care about is how fast they train, and since you can extract from anywhere there is no restriction on where you operate. Again, you are making wild assumptions based on what you think is going on with no verifiable numbers to show you are right OR wrong but that isn't stopping your declaring this proves you are correct even though it proves nothing either way.

Item #: SCP-[REDACTED]-1 [J130650, The Death Spiral]
---
Object Class: Keter
---
Special Containment Procedures: A total of 100 specially selected D-class personnel are assigned a special purpose hab-block in Site-17, to follow a regimen of shift work of continuous monitoring in the J130650 system. Specifically, their aim is to prevent players from entering or leaving J130650 through a round-the-clock barricading of the system using warp disruption modules. The D-class personnel are experienced players of EVE and are on a strict medication of Ritalin and other mental performance-enhancing drugs.
---
Description: SCP-[REDACTED] is an anomalous region of space in the online Massively Multiplayer Online game, EVE Online (see SCP-[REDACTED], [EVE, Eternal Vigilance, Everywhere]). Specifically, it is located in the J130650 system. It was first detected on 2016-0█-██ in an incident where ██ players, in a group known as a "fleet", were victim to an instance of SCP-[REDACTED]-1. All of the dead were in the same in-game "fleet" at the time of the incident.
---
The Foundation was made aware of this when agents spotted potential discussion of an anomalous nature on the /r/eve board of reddit dot com. The Foundation was rapidly able to access both the moderation of the board and the administration of the website, and through IP address tracking with cooperating network providers, physically located and applied class-B amnestics to the █ survivors.
---
SCP-[REDACTED]1 appear to be manifestations of ████████ ████████ energy which will commonly appear in specified areas of J130650 known as anomaly signatures. To a player, an instance of SCP-[REDACTED]-1 will manifest as a ship or ships appearing by piloted by the in-game character "██████ ███ ███" or similar names thereof. Most appearances of SCP-[REDACTED]-1 will be in the █ to █ range, but can go up to ██.
---
SCP-[REDACTED]-1 will attack the player, but if provoked will appear to fight back like a normal player would. Instances of SCP-[REDACTED]-1 can appear to be any 'tier-two' cruiser in the game, and will be equipped with high-grade shields, armour, and guns. Upon being damaged to ██ Structure, SCP-[REDACTED]1a occurs.
---
SCP-[REDACTED]1a is spatial distortion which can be created by instances of SCP-[REDACTED]1. The ██████████ of the beast will ███████ ████████ █████ ██ ██████ and ██████ ███ ████████ ████. The result of this medical procedure results in 84% of cases in a fatal brain hemorrhage.
---
Addendum:
---
On Date  2016-0█-██, the containment failed due to a group of players overriding the containment group. They fell prey to SCP-[REDACTED]1a and ██% of the group subsequently died instantly. 
---
On Date  2016-0█-██, the containment failed due to a single player bypassing the containment group and was subsequently predated upon by SCP-[REDACTED]1a. The player appeared to have been using a 'virtual private network', making them untraceable. The Foundation has been unable to locate the body.

[FILE CONTINUES - TOO LARGE TO DISPLAY]
---
I wouldn’t use the word competent... 2 have very large fleets and the other is significantly smaller.
---
Let it go dude!
---
I mean if you read it, it relates how the current meta has come into being because of skill injectors /shrug
---
Without skill injectors, the current way that the game runs wouldn’t be possible. Not yet at least, maybe in many many years from now. The way rorq’s, supers and caps work just set the rules while injectors made them even more oppressive. 
---
Citadels are just a whole other mess, and as I said about caps, there are already so many good solutions about them that there is no point beating on that drum. It’s all been said.
---
[Don't be.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c0p8r1/this_system_so_anomalous_that_the_scp_foundation/er6jr9t/)
---
The irony is they will fly all the way across the map to fight legacy and the Imperium over the FRAT timers, but they won't fight Legacy and the Imperium in Tribute even though Frat has shown they will come up north to help.
---
Voice acting is better than what CCP had to offer this year.
---
He does!
---
2 Shield super fleets who are battle hardened over the last year and a half, proving themselves more successful than their armor counterparts, winning countless major battles that changed the way EVE wars are fought today. But let’s just not use the word competent.
---
great vid, that is the feeling exactly.
---
how long does this last?
---
This is so true, and unfortunately it's human nature to want to take the path of least resistance. It's very unfortunate to see people work towards ruining the game. Although we do have some, we need more entities that believe in internet spaceship violence and carry the punk rock ethos.
---
pressing f1 is not a hard task for a reasonably functioning human being, if you need the literal years it takes to get semi perfect skills for most doctrines to train how to behave in a fleet well...
---
...what?
---
Isn't that what alpha ships and Doomsday's are though?
---
It taking effort is exactly the way to work with burst damage.
---
How is that a shitty argument?
---
It can kill your entire sub capital fleet in 12 seconds.
---
So, basically the same thing.
---
More triglawian ships and site is the key. To a point where they switch the game to a single player PvE one as people no longer need to engage other players.
---
Very cringe.
---
we most certainly do need all 3, if there is only one NCPL will wait a year call it fake and pretend this never happened
---
My lord, I am unworthy of such great writing. If I had a gold medal, I'd give it to you. Pls upload this to the wiki
---
Ah, you flatter me.
---
Alright im dome talking to you. You know as well as I most of the game is in nullsec weather you want to argue about my wording or not. Good bye Goon.
---
Your whole first paragraph was suggesting a new player go mine which is shit for a new, single account subcap player, becaus rorqs have devalued ore so much. Spinning a single VNI for hours on end is similarly garbage because its incredibly boring and poor income due to ISK being devalued. Same thing with PI.
---
Highsec Incursions, pirate or FW Level 3s, exploring, all that other stuff I mentioned is more engaging and nets your more income as a single account player, either alpha or omega. It also doesnt came with a sea of blues and the aids that are large sov null alliances.
---
can't be worse than the IHUB fight we lost. There were a lot more than three threads about it.
---
Lol I’m not bitter and I don’t hate anyone it is just game, I’ve also not said test or goons are incompetent just feel it’s a little harsh to TRI given it’s much harder to use 20-30 titans than 1000. But you can be salty if you like :) 
---
Also I’m sure someone is going to post TRI losses from move op...please don’t because I cant be bothered to find equivalent losses for goons &amp; test Move ops.
---
and here i thought triposting was dead when sash left for snuff
---
&gt;You know as well as I most of the game is in nullsec weather you want to argue about my wording or not.
---
The only thing we know for sure is that number of people verifiable living in nullsec is around 20-25% of the players base. You make whatever assumptions you would like to but until you can point to an actual number based on something CCP has made available showing who lives where and what accounts they own, you don't "Know" anything.
---

---
omg, my new favorite alliance logo
---
The argument you and olemca are making is "because it takes effort, we should have m bigger bombs" which is fucking dumb
---
It’s not about having less, it’s about pure incompetence from leadership and a lack of an ability or willingness to use said force without 2 other coalitions feeding it a whole bottle of viagra every 3 minutes just to keep it alive.
---
I'm new to EvE and I don't get this too. at the beginning I thought it will change after couple days or there's different content on different station. 
---
My first thought was, it could be so nice to see multiple displays of real time data there, like local market stuff(diagrams, products), job offers, region maps, some kind of news?, top wanted list etc. one idea was that you could pay with ISK to display your own messages, commercials, propaganda... 
---
I have done some data viz my self and saw that space as a nice opportunity to bring some  more immersion in the game environment. in a way that it the design is in middle between aesthetical and informative purpose
---
Moosearmy Best Army
---
&gt; I have no idea how old you character is, but I would recommend flying for a month using only t1 cruisers and below.
---
200m SP and I generally prefer cruiser and smaller.  
---
&gt;it’s about the ability to get on the same level as everyone else
---
"Get on the same level" in this case means, "Be another idiot F1 DD monkey in a ship you can't really operate without someone on voice comms explicitly telling you which button to press, and when."
---
Truly aspirational.
---
Ok so 1.) I wooshed on your sarcasm and apologize, 2.) you should probably clarify "*I just want to know why they are broken*" better. I'll try and respond legitimately:
---
&gt;as afk able as i thought but they are still pretty sit and forget compared to Barges 
---
So yes - barges require more clicking, dragging and dropping of ore into containers, tractoring, whatever strategy it is. The rebuttal to this is that they are \~ 1/40 the cost of barges. Barges can move on a moments notice (w/ exception to agility of course) - rorquals are stuck there, sitting ducks, waiting to be murderzoned like all the other half brained afkers who have died in Delve. Something you might not realize but A LOT of rorquals die on a weekly basis. Risk v. reward.
---
The issue is the risk has become somewhat nullified - either by lack of effort on the hunters side of things or accessibility for space that is &gt; a few midpoints from lowsec. People don't put fuckall effort into hunting rorquals or supers - thus making it easy to defend them with the \~*grr super umbrella*\~. A well prepped, well efforted, skirmish deployment by even a small group can accomplish a lot - the key words here are '*well prepped and well efforted*" however. When me and a couple others were hunting in GOTG space we had massive spreadsheets recording every movement of every capital sized vessel and more, took notes on times and system preferences, did significant opposition research etc. - you don't see that anymore. People are complaining and making rorquals - **which mind you only mine 2-3x what a hulk does** \- an issue because they want an easy way to either **a.)** kill rorquals or **b.)** get lazy mode so their entity's industry can catch up to other groups who put unimaginable amounts of time, isk, experience, trial and error, etc. into establishing an environment where rorquals could have opportunities to generate revenue.
---
Rorquals aren't broken anymore, what's broken is the will
---
So according to you, subcaps and caps are "basically the same thing". Sorry I mistakenly believed you weren't a fucking moron.
---
P much false, you'll get plenty of winnable fights in T1 ships, most notably an arty rifter, dual tanked breacher, beam tormentor, cheese rocket kestrel (21km rockets, zero tank, mwd, great for fucking up unsuspecting brawlers), LML Kestrel, and others I dont recall now.
---
3 dead unfit megathrons? okay?
---
yes.. exactly..you have implants, clones ect. but why glasses?  :D
---
Wow, something that has never happened before. That's so cool and game changing - a sand castle built by a few carebears. A true empire has formed!
---
That's actually a great idea
---
I envy you newbros so much. :( So pure of bad experience
---
The water's fine. C'mon in.
---
That is so true! The billboard is useless.
---
Looks like insurance fraud to me. Killboard littered with unfilt megathrons.
---
The second battle report... so you killed a handful of thrashers and a lone 'Cepter using a fleet consisting of Bships, Faction Bships, T3Cs, T2Cs, Tris, etc  ... congrats I guess?
---
Loki here. You didnt get me below 70% :) But couldnt keep up with the speed

New alliance to farm nice

There would have to be a next alliance tournament to start... :/

me too, i’ve tried for a long time without meds, i have gotten so much better learning to work with my ADD

but I feel where i want to be is just out of reach, i’m hoping it’ll be the push over the hump
---
I'm not new to the game.  This is my second pilot.
---
imagine putting the Chinese boy army as a difficult start
---
you have infinite isk and timezone supremacy and if anyone calls you out for the cheating you do you can call them racist and auto win
---
&gt;  3 rolling battleships and a rolling HIC can instantly roll 2m wormholes (5 for 3m)
---
How?
---
I'm doing the math and this doesn't make sense to me.
---
Battleships would be 150, so 300 there and back...x3 is 900...where are the other 1100 coming from?
---
rail comet (one of the most common ships in fw) alone will walk all over the examples you provided
---
I wouldn't have taken this post seriously, but the fact that you put effort into making that response single handedly drug this shitpost back over into land of honey pots. I now await more people who \~*totally aren't mad but are trying to make this insiginifant battle report more insignificate*\~ lmao.
---
Pretty much same situation, been off meds since sophmore year of highschool, got a job in programming and starting school soon, gotten a lot better at managing it, but its frustrating when i tell people im trying, and then completely forget about the thing im supposed to be Trying to do, and programming is rough when you cant focus
---
I can relate to this article because i didnt contribute jack shit to TEST or like 6 months because i havent been playing and I come back to find out that I'm banned and removed.
---
Suprised pikachu face
---
Wow, you shot some thrashers with a battleship fleet! 
---
You goons are so elite.
---
No, I'm saying that overwhelming power that takes effort to apply is a good balancing factor.

As far as your core concern they are. "Losing your whole fleet in 12 second" is the issue you have. Explain why that is different with capitals and not one that is related to cost.
---
Tribute is a lost cause VS Tapireium Guardians of the PIBC. TGofPIBC has too many supers up north, Detorid has close to equal titan/super numbers and better local defences. Detorid will be the last bastion to stop serenity 2.
---
Making money should be tedious, there is absolutely no reason for a ship to sit semi-afk in space and rake in money with almost zero effort. 
---
Rorqual isk/hour is not the problem, it never was. Small-scale Rorq income actually fucking sucks. Simply increasing their income 2-3 times to put them closer to super ratting and killing off the current scaling would completely fix the situation. No more jerking off on Netflix while the Rorq farm passively generates isk, instead players are rewarded for ACTIVE play rather than having multiple accounts generate isk simply for being logged in.
---
The fact that we are in 2019 and people like you still believe and defend that mining should be this 'multibox and afk' activity is disturbing. Mining in its current form is basically botting and extremely unhealthy for the game and the only reason we have gotten this far is because CCP is well aware of how many additional subscriptions exist because of this.
---
Tldr: A blanket nerf to all Rorqual mining does not address the issue at all because the issue only exists when multiboxing is concerned. A single Rorqual makes too little and multiple Rorquals make way too much.
---
Chinese alliance to stop tranquility becoming serenity, how ironic

But I guess there is a reason they came to tq

Question: In wormholes, how often do anomalies appear? i have been sitting in a c3 for about a week now and seen four total pop up. Also why are myrmidons so good with a passive shield tank?
---
Image seething so much that someone would blow up their own ships in an internet spaceship game that you would make 3 threads on reddit.com about it.
---
I find a decent mix of rail and blaster comets. You can also disengage from rail comets fairly easily if you slide in on them, and a dual rep breacher wins just as much as it loses against em.

Can alliances make their own video and submit it to CCP?

it's not free to play.

" Making money should be tedious, "

Fuck no, it should take effort sure, but Effort should never = hating every moment at the keyboard because they turned mining into a click happy process, this is part of what drives people to botting in the first place.

They did make a monocle

When did Eve Onion start posting real news?

Which is why CCP won't do anything about it. But more ship skins!!!!!!!

those are rookie numbers

Yes, but no one has had any replies from submissions recently

Hm i must brawl too much, thats all kitey kite

I to say the other side is elite, when I smug in 3 post's about killing T1 destroyers in a battleship fleet
---
I feel sorry for eutz sometimes

but you guys are euros so  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Doesn't PIBC have a role to play in these stats? Lots of Chinese folks moved in recently from the Serenity server.
---
If you ask him how much time they spend now trying to get these few clips vs what it was like before fighter application changes, he would say the game is much worse off. Go on, ask him.

The only reason he doesn't openly say it because Jokastis is a unperturbed saint.

Don't enjoy it, don't do it. Doesn't change the fact that a semi-afk ship should not be generating money.
---
You goons sure spend a lot of time worrying about killboards.
---
XD I half-way did it because I knew it would get the cringe reaction. 
---
Hate is predictable.
---
Most of those are scramkite setups with the kestrels being an exception.
---
u/CCP_Falcon i haven't seen any comments from you so far, have a good weekend sir (◍•ᴗ•◍)✧*。
---
Wow thats longer than I expected thank you... 
---
Long story short is its hard to kill them so people dont try with enough effort to do it. 
---
I wish I had more to reply with lol. 
---
I figure they are hard but not impossible to kill. I merely dont have one cuz I dont want to lose that much isk in one sitting. I could afford one.. But yea.. 
---
Again thank you. I figured the perception is wrong as opposed to the ship is "actually" broken. Which is why I phrased my op the way I did hoping to attract conversation.
---
really tl;dr injectors should be accelerators
---
which I agree with
---
The art is beautiful. The story behind is significantly less so. You chose to follow an over-zealous pompous asshat and it back fired.
---
Hey, that's actually a good point I hadn't thought of before. It's unlikely to happen, but maybe with skinnable structures /s this could happen; overall I hope there's a way to not see people's ads in your structure.
---
You are smugging about killing t1 destroyers worth less than a single doctrine fit HAC. The hubris:brainpower ration is off the charts
---
Seems like it.
---
It is game dude, nobody cares. I'm just fucking about. Next you are going to shit on my warhammer models because I picked the wrong factions. Jesus you guys are so emo.
---
You jest, but TAPI's inclusion of Chinese players *could* be part of a long-term play to backstab the Goons and finally break up this BS blue donut that includes two-thirds of null at this point.
---
Or (and more likely) they'll just keep being butt-buddies and krab this game into an early grave.
---
The StainGuy quality _has_ declined lately.
---
Is your heart not in it any more?
---
It is a game dude, nobody cares. Next you will get hostile because I picked the wrong warhammer faction. Just chill.
---
Lol yikes
---
I can post all the shit talking you have done, if you wanna come at me with this holier than thou attitude about “chilling out” lol
---
Tapi would need some courage, and an actual strategy, to take on goons.
---
So, no.
---
very acurate ;) have my upvote
---
The yield would make it the next obvious choice.. You would just end up having a hauler alt instead of another rorq.
---
The hull is only 2 3-4 with good fittings its the drones that make the cost.
---
Is the ore hold the same? orca is 180 I throught rorq was 200something. 
---
Compression wont make or break it either way.
---
Would’ve lived if it was a shield su....wait..
---
Pretty sure that was the point.
---
GIT OFF MAH SHIP SPAYCE MAHRINE
---
Can confirm bombers bar was my most fav fleet to fly with... might be because I get a good reason to fly my Manticore..
---
Self-Entitled? That's a bit clunky. Did they give themselves titles?
---
more like spergmann
---
jkjk, sweet vid!
---
GALLENTE MASTERRACE!
---
oh, in the game we can shit talk all we want. that is fun of it. but to come out here and start slamming on some guy's work because you don't like the "story in the video game"... Like, I get the feeling you actually care about the smack talk and think I actually mean what I say. I'm just having a laugh, friend. if you don't like it, just let me know and I'll stop.
---
But I said the art was beautiful....:thonking:
---
my only rev is goodfit. i have phoenix and nag from contracts that are bad fit
---
He never even criticized the art dude, lol.
---
I'll be really disappointed if not a single one of the goon titans is named Scorditan :D
---
I’ll just be quiet. I’m all bark no bite as you like to say. I got you triggered so my mission here is completed. Fair winds and following seas m8
---
BUT GUYS THEY ARENT ACTUAL INGAME PLUS 10 AND THEY BRAWL ALL THE TIME LOOK AT THIS ZKILL LINK OF A JUNIOR FLEET COMMANDER FIGHTING ANOTHER JUNIOR FLEET COMMANDER (FIGHT ARRANGED IN THE JUNIOR FLEET COMMANDER DISCORD BTW) IN TECH ONE CRUISERS!!!
---
yes it is worth, you have no stress on earning the monthly isk to get omega done and can actually spend isk on your activities ingame while training at full speed and being able to fly all ships.
---
worth is entirely subjective for everyone.
---
if you spend more than i dunno 5 hours a week in the game instead of getting wasted e.g. then yeah you probably should go for it, becaues you would invest into drinks (fill in random whatever other activity) instead
---
that's racist.
---
You out the disbanding coalition under the wrong group. Should be highlighted in red under Fraternity.
---
and yet you are here, talking about how cringy it is because I'm the guy who talks smack in local. you obviously care or you wouldn't waste your time here trying to "cringe" this. I didn't even say what it was about... I just left it as something for EVE fans.
---
He fuckin rhymed rain check...with rain check....
---
The question I want answered is, will Provi bow to mittens, completing the G on the map??
---
The amount of space was never an issue, as no one ever really challenged us for it, and moving through it was easy. Even if we didn't own it, there wouldn't be any meaningful fights originating from it. The upkeep was minimal, really.  I don't know where you get the impression of us burning out over our own sov from, it was easy to hold.
---
We've always been deployed to the edges of our sov to fight our neighbours. Turns out, after citadels and the nature of the game, its just not worth it anymore.
---
oh hey arfuss what happened to your other reddit account where you sperged you were going to kill all the brave and goons
---
You okay?
---
Bark bark
---
0/10 biomass
---
ROFL 
---
Man this always make me laugh
---
Looks like a cookie monster licking it's next cookie...  that's what my brain changes the image into with the blue and red.
---
is this just a think you do in and out of games? Just try to insult people and post tears or salt or whatever it is you guys do on discord? Or do you actually turn into a friendly guy at some point?
---
I know. But the reason i was mostly inactive in test was because this game is fucking intimidating. I want to participate in wars so badly but everyone scares me.
---
For investments, I currently have about 2000 plex, 125B in skins (net worth, which is not necessarily real value for skins, 20B in assets I think will appreciate more than Plex, (some of it just had super low buy orders as well), and actually around 30B in XVI anniversary assets.  The Praxis/Gnosis/Sunesis boxes specifically.  Only around 5B liquid atm.  Once the anniversary assets rise up in value, I will start selling them off and moving it back into PLEX.  ATM the anniversary assets are super underpriced and I just keep buying as much as I can.
---
thanks to the people who put buy orders for pyroxeres and plagioclase.  I mined some ore, compressed the ore and then sold it.  I made enough money to buy an Algos and some equipment.  now I can start the Sisters of Eve story.
---
Nice guys finish last
---
The "taperiumguardians of the PIBC" made me ***actually*** laugh out loud, a rare occurrence :D 
---
I hope NCdot, FRT, horde, the renters and the remnants of skillU just set up one giant alliance and anchor their keepstar in "I LOL" (IL-OL1) or O-TRV1, with 181 and 205 systems in titan range respectively. Then a year or two later we can have a sword fight with our Scorditans and see who won Eve. Then move on to Eve 2.0 (if CCP would just start coding it already).
---
The blue donut displayed like this is way more brutal than I thought
---
On sov.space you can lie to yourself cause it looks like different entities even though they aren't really anymore
---
if they care so little why do they keep dropping corp and transferring structures to avoid killmails?
---
idgi
---
ah the old, TEST and GOONS are the same group because they fight to support each other, but even though skillu, winter and panfam all fight together they are still separate shtick.
---
been dual boxing it for awhile and take out hoover fleets whenever I can.
---
are you doing reactions or just selling?
---
We are quickly moving towards Tranquility ending up like Serenity in its final days.
---
&gt;Don't enjoy it, don't do it.
---
ahh now I get it, this is a stealth bring back passive moon mining income post. I should have known.
---
I'm not sure what you mean
---
great idea thanks :)
---
This is why recording your gameplay is important my dude. For the most part we weren't even shooting at you, just holding you for content and killing your buddies. We didn't get a chance to actually primary you because you started warping in caps and supers.
---
Is GOTG an official pet of the Imperium already? Or are they gonna get trashed the second Goons look the other way?
---
Your own video contradicts your statement. Also, arent you the phantasm who got camped and turned ultrasalty in local?  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77173289/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77173289/)
---
So you do care about your space game. amazing.
---
Don't really get why you've covered your modules, but ok. After this video now I see a reason to just sit in wormholes with eyes and wait for content. If you tried to unironically take this garbage brawling ikitursa into low-sec or null-sec you'd get blasted off.
---
He literally had to pay.
---
&gt; In wormholes, how often do anomalies appear
---
About four a week sounds pretty normal
---
Make a alt for FW
---
Except CCP has said they are already doing just that...  I think it was either Sydney or Amsterdam that they announced it.
---
They are worthless to us all.
---
In the video you literally get shot for 30 seconds by 2 ships before we switch to your buddy that warped in. And no, I'm not the 247mil Phantasm that you guys unironically camped with 10+ dudes for 2+ days.
---
The correct words you mean are: Blobbed by supers... May i should do the same, everything else is boring af atm...
---
Panfam and winter are literally the same on this map, and skillu is separate because they're dying and he's memeing. How far up your ass is your head?
---
This whole thing was a setup to surround Providence and implement the final solution for rp'ers in Null.
---
The picture shows skillu disbanding, and the rest (winter &amp; panfam) being friends, and then the provi quagmire, though..........
---
Have you heard? B-B-B-Berg , Berg , Berg , the Berg's the werd.
---
We didn't camp. We literally live here. You came to scout several times. Worth every grain of salt :)
---
It's not shattered so what you found isn't common. FYI shattered wormhole systems start with a 0 as the first number of the J-tag.
---
yeah i know all about the SMA stuff dude. but one of the things goons like to forget is that initially they weren't getting stomped by the entire universe. they were losing fleet fights, badly, to the lowsec voltron dudes they tried to extort.  
---
without those initial dunks, nobody would have followed lenny irrespective of the money. elise and PL initially thought he was crazy. but when everyone saw they were getting repeatedly hammered by fleets half their size, there smelled blood in the water.
