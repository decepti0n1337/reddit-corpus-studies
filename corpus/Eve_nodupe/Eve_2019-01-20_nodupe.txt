yeah, everyone tolerates updates they have few over a decade of gaming, the current update process launches when the launcher does so if you leave it on past downtime and a patch of any size is released you are guaranteed an error, just restart the browser after downtime and it won't happen.

I wasn't talking about only ISK. I was talking about net value. Even though items are turned into ISK as a result of insurance payouts the total net value of that ISK is less than the loss of the ship.

Wormholes are not for everyone, while I do agree a lot of fun can be made of wormholes, you need to be VERY dedicated to keep it up. Kudos to you for being able to login frequently and play the wh game. There are several aspects that personally make me not want to live in a worm hole.
---
-  You need to find chains constantly, some one has to do it, and if no else will, you have to. You know very well this can take some time
---
- Constantly need to drop off your goods to k space, while this technically is a great problem to have, if you ever get lazy doing this, you create a loot piñata in your hole. 
---
- The need to be in an active corp and can never go inactive yourself unless you plan on it. What I mean by this is, you can never go AFK unless you plan it out and move your ships out. In the scenario you get evicted (which will happen eventually) you won't lose too much. IF you have to go randomly, you leave all your assets at risk. 
---
- The need to have multiple alts and specialized training, from what I've seen most groups run many alts. While this is not new to most eve players, you HAVE to setup for your wormhole class/static. 
---
- You can NEVER be lazy. Yea, this is awesome to some people, no local means more d-scan attention. Think this is amazing? Well the reality is that A LOT of people just want to get home and relax. Call me "casual" but quite frankly I already am dealing with a lot, now I have to watch D-scan 23/7 and that is assuming hostiles are not in d-scan immune ships. I think this is great tbh, it makes you focused, and ready all the time. 
---
- TLDR Being a wormholer takes A LOT of dedication and time. There very few groups that have everything setup and require little input from its members. If you are not part of these groups you need to do all the chain locating with what ever numbers you have. You need to be ready to PVP, because there are groups out there that will evict simply because you blue ball or don't "elite pvp" with them. This is not all groups, but something that really makes me say no to wormholes. If you have the time to do it, then that is awesome, but unfortunately a lot of people can't dedicate that much time to wormholes. 
---
I can be in jita from null in 20 mins tops, in a wh depending if I have to scan a chain down, it may very well take me more then 30 mins just to find a high-sec chain. Don't forget those mass limits as well! If you are a wormholer, you need to pay your logistic director, chain scanners, and other directors that make your wormholer life easier A LOT OF ISK. The reality is that while you lot get a lot better "content" allegedly, it takes you twice or more effort than a k-spacer, just so you can ignore cynos. 
---
You misspelled guristas
---
As someone who plays both wow and eve go ahead and come back i'm sure you can find something you enjoy doing. 
---
But make sure you pace yourself this time, you're gonna burn out again otherwise.

You think a Palatine Keepstar needs a lot of materials?  You ain't seen nothin' yet.
---
What this guy said. I find the leshaks easier than the starving Veds since Leshak start heavily damaged and are easy to hit.
---
devalues my elite quick switch ammo apm, no support
---
As I said, maybe it should change. I was just trying to speculate as to the functional difference between ADC and those other mods. I wouldn't call it an "oversight" but if this is a real consern (sounds like it is) then a feature request to change it may be in order. 
---
You could start with a bug report that it DOESN'T allow you to activate it, though that may just be kicked back as intended...
---
Gallente industrials are the most versatile, so if you're staying alpha it's the way to go. Otherwise you need to think about your long-term goals, but gallente haulers are never a bad choice. 
---
I guess I would like to create custom fighter groups. I would ideally want to select heavy, return and orbit, select lights, orbit target. I can do all of those atm but I have to manually select both lights or my 3 heavies

What are bubbles precious
---
They have the same moongoo as 0.5 systems. So not a lot, but it's there.
---
try anchoring a bubble in lowsec buttercup
---
I can see it being a bit harder for casual/low player count/semi-AFK groups. Choosing a wormhole with the statics you want or need is a big part of it. Static Lowsec/Highsec holes for people not as interested in PVP, that sort of thing.
---
Minimizing the need for rolling alts and whatnot, scanning the chains, it kind of relies on the effort people will put into it. Low effort groups will find wormholes most likely not to their liking, and high effort groups will probably end up finding that the wormholes are significantly more fun and rewarding than living in low/null. 
---
Having someone that is good and enjoys being balls deep in logistics for the corp is also a massive help lol
---
In lowsec your tank is docking. In nullsec you don’t always have a place to dock 
---
Solo in a dual 400mm plate punisher is actually pretty funny as you can kill alot of gank fit destroyers.
---
Stop plying in market hubs.
---
if your jumping your jf into a bubble you deserve to loose it, jf can dock at any sized citadels so just wait the session timer and dock.

---
Why'd you delete this pussy
---
Great fucking idea!  Though I'm still confused about the part where it doesn't mention botting or a lowsec gate to somewhere
---
The ideal number of probes to carry is 16. So you don't have to manually reload your launcher after recalling them and so you aren't boned if you leave them behind as you go into a wormhole and forget to bookmark your entrance.
---
Hopefully that 2nd one is a thing of the past for you before you start using RSS probes.
---
That would be nice. I want a hotkey for targeting tagged ships tho. notice you can tag shit in fleet... but can't just hotkey to lock on any tagged ships or cycle through each tag if they are on a ship already to lock on.
---
Unless there is one but hidden somewhere...
---
Don't inject into PI or SP farmers. That is a waste. Buy multiple pilot training certificates. It's a pretty quick train into PI skills. Something like ten days. You can create two new PI characters for 3 billion. Save another 3 bill for the second month and you now have 2 PI skill injector alta that will pay for them selves with MPTCs.

Eve is already quite complicated and vast, QoL things like fuel blocks for towers/citadels instead of tossing a heap of isotopes and PI shit helps burn out a lot. Making the quality of the complicated doesn’t dumb the game down unless more people read your posts
---
You can sort your overview by tags if you turned on the tag column. Then tagged ships will be at the top and it's easy to lock them.
---
There's a similar thing you can turn on which rises recent broadcasts to top too.

Kind of what their original point was, piss off the wrong snowflake in the wrong way, no matter how minute, and it may very well end up with your eviction. Does not matter if you pvp or not, you will get evicted somehow, somewhere. 
---
Listen. I too think dropping titans on roams like this is cancer. That being said, I don't blame the people who do it. I blame ccp for the mechanics that allow something like this to happen. I don't blame the groups dropping titans for protecting their space as effectively as they can. No one is "owed" a good fight. But the lack of good, non-arranged fights is killing the game. That's on CCP, not on the groups playing Eve optimally.

Props to Frat, they prepared a beautiful trap and it sprung. Last week they mobilised too but didn‘t succeed in killing the fleet.
---
It worked because many people (and Zarvox...) warped straight to gate aggressed. If you pinged off a planet, you are most likely alive.
---
Thanks for the content to Frat and Zarvox, getting fragged is part of the game. Didn‘t hear people in comms being salty, neither was Zarvox. It‘s a gank fleet that doesn‘t take usual fights and getting trapped + bosoned is the way to fight this comp.

TL;DR: Nice content, no salt on comms, happiness :)

honestly while those might be true it's still more than half the spodbrains in eve have done in terms of providing fleet content no matter how bad it may be. 
---
On that note, do you know or have you heard talk on the rate in which P0 regenerates? I’ve recently gotten back into PI and am curious what the mechanics are. PI has been in-game for years, surely players have tested the background mechanics and have a good idea of P0 spawn rates. All the ‘blooms’ of P0 seem to show it regenerates in a cyclic fashion. 
---
tbh I still would like the hotkey regardless. more options is better cause I don't even want to touch my overview unless its actually needed.
---
That the release launcher so I guess I just have the bug some others have. It's pretty sad it's taking so long to get fixed.
---
We'd need to have ammo sorted by alphabetical range have the hotkey bounded to them. Range isn't possible 'cuz there are minmin ammos with the same range. would love to see something similar with drones
---
But what if you have several kinds of weapons ?
---
the only reason the subcap fleet wasn't there was because we didn't have a bridger ready.
---
Ah I didn't notice, thx
---
well I figured it was bait, you got me this time!
---
Your stuff is probably all in asset safety if you had it stored in null stations as they got replaced with faction forts. and you will need alot of liquid isk to free it with ccp bigbrains making asset safetying stuff cost isk so returning players will think twice before returning..

would be nice wouldn't it? =D

My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway.
---
Ah I'm using Chrome on desktop so that might be a difference.

Look for a SIG in a mega alliance. Only real options these days, unless Dirt Nap Squad is still around. 
---
shh
---
So to give everyone an update:
---
After working closely with u/ankanamoon I have come up with the fit below. It is almost identical to one that he created, however I've made the following changes:
---
* The Adaptive Nano Plating II was initially level I. It was only 100,000 more ISK, and for an extra 1,000 ehp I think it was worth it.
---
* The Medium Armor Repairer 2 used to be a Medium 'Accommodation' Vestment Reconstructor I. It was a bit (1.1M ISK) more expensive, but increased my armor repair rate by 3.8 per second.
---
A few stats for anyone interested:
---
* Offense: 230.5 dps
---
* Defense: 14,040 ehp
---
* Armor repair rate: 38.3 hp/s
---
* Targeting: 49.88 km
---
* Navigation: 512.9 m/s
---
   * 18,500 t
---
   * .4251x inertial modifier
---
   * 3 AU/s
---
   * 10.9 s align time
---
* Drones: 26.4 dps
---
* Capacitor: 00:04:19
---
* The estimated cost is 83.1M ISK
---
If anyone has any suggestions, I'd really like to know. If possible, I would like to increase ehp and decrease the align time, but the dps and repair rate are definitely more important to me.

Nobody is going to put the time and effort to evict you unless you have low powered structures or you pissed them off. Have a fully fitted and fueled astrahus and nobody will bother you. It is very easy to make an eviction not worthwhile if you know what you're doing. I lived in a C5-C5 by myself for over 4 months. My home hole and static constantly had connections to LS making an eviction easily worthless. 
---
Relisters are making bank lulz
---
So you are saying it's bad to boson these kind of fleets but will continue to do it because CCP let you do it while stating that you aren't the problem? 
---
My worst room was 15 damavik and 5 fog caster drones. I couldn't break anything. 5 webbing damaviks, 5 hurting damavik, and 5 prepping damavik. I couldn't move fast enough to get transversal, and I couldn't kill the things taking my tracking without the speed either. 700 dps just wasn't enough in that case.
---
I raise you https://youtu.be/D3iaR1wn4kY
---
what if we just got an action bar or radial menu with slots for consumables (caps, pills, paste) and ammo.. if you press button assigned to ammo it starts loading valid guns for that ammo, if you press paste it let's you highlight which module to repair
---
Even better, have a radial menu open up when you click and hold a weapon showing the icons for all available ammo types in your hull. Then you just select one and it'll load up. Kinda like the radial menu you get when long-clicking on objects in space. 
---
It’s a good idea. I am definitely going to bring it up. 
---
Well that's a bit much
---
Thanks!!! So glad you could make it! 
---
Certainly overkill in this case. However, some comps are so cancerous and anti-fun to fight against that I don't begrudge a little bait-and-boson chemotherapy. I don't blame the people flying them at all. Maximum cancer is the roaming meta and will be so until CCP grasps the concept of counterplay.
---
Absolutely, i respect anyone who takes their asses out there and brings content to masses. One day it will all be past when its nothing but rorqs mining under superumbrellas that would drop on even frigate gangs. We are reaching the endgame of eve, goons are already there with test and frat closing in.
---
It would have been fair game even if your main intent would have been to boson, smartbomb or helldunk Zarvox‘ fleet. 
---
You just use the game mechanics given to us by CCP to defend your space/assets.
---
A question though: was the titan sitting on gate all the time you had the bait rorq in system?
---
Like how you can right-click and it shows you a list of ammo for that weapon in your hold?
---
The second people feel obligated to play eve sub-optimally because of "space bushido" is the second that eve ceases to be eve.

---
I'll stop giving you ineffective shit on reddit for sure
---
&gt;Although not mandatory, I like the idea of flying with a WH group that has a NS static. That keeps things fresh.
---
Well then join a group of your preference and go do it with a fleet open to your group. Problem solved + you get recognition &amp; much more experience running things yourself
---
I legit don't know.
---
Underwater physic though, gotta remember this is submarines in space online 
---
If they're fit properly, we get full ping SRP.
---
Yes, but again that has nothing to do with being an ISK sink or an ISK faucet. 
---
Those terms are specifically about the amount of ISK in the game as a whole regardless of how many things exist. PvP is an ISK faucet because it introduces ISK into the game through insurance payouts. ISK wasn't destroyed, only items. The nominal value of those items in ISK has nothing to do with it. Or, if anything the items destroyed make exacerbate the inflationary problem of ISK faucets because you not only have more ISK in the economy but that more ISK is chasing fewer items.
---
Did better than me. Thank goodness I didn't choose my abyssal stiletto.
---
You get them all because they cost extremely little, and then use each one for its most suited task.
---
I can't really see wormholing as a reliable income for new players though, personally. The difficulty in finding loot aside, the hard part is making it out with the loot alive to sell it. The isk/hr ain't great if you spend a week or two exploring then explode to a cloaked Tengu as you're searching for a hole leading to somewhere you can cash out.
---
I may be wrong, in fact I'm sure I probably am, but I dont see the appeal of exploration and its RNG loot over the steady, safe income of the mining/VNI ratting beloved by us Nullbears. 
---
LOL wow

Depends on the class/amount of accounts you can multi box. Anywhere from 300m an hour up to 4-5b an hour
---
My dude, it's 8 pm and I'm smashed but
---
Are you new to the game? Genuine question because the mixing of several kinds of guns is generally something nrw players do.. there's a whole argument about it but generally gins stay a rack of the same type. At most you'll see the odd rocket/rlml mixed in among turrets, or a mix of something like blasters to max pg, but it generally doesnt happen for good reason. Nice edge case consideration though. In that case, i thougjt about it and it's a manual edge case that cant really be solved efficiently. Though you could possibly expand this solution to *route* certain ammos to certain modules and thus have the keys really be bonded to an ammo setup--that would be a huge ui clutter and only be useful for the edge case of many guns. 99% of eve players cant even mentally process more than 5 ammos so it would really be changing the level of abiliyy and not just qol at that stage. Really this change is eaimed at wliminating the step of having to stop and right click your guns and go through a little context menu and actually *read stuff* and recall what it means in the middle of combat to change ammo in a fast paced situation
---
Still nice thinking
---
Drones you have groups, dont you know? You can group drones together and shoot those groups out into space by dragging them out... the motion is pretty fast and there's already decent hotkey support with launch default/recall active on top of that I think
---
Also ammos with identical range--excluding the obvious of every t1 ammo having faction variants, missiles are also identically ranged. Sorry if the kikimora example was confusing but the ammos would be manually speciried to whatever you want. If you want to organize them differently or not hotkey some ammos then go ahead, or not hotkey at all--it's optin anyway--up to you as a genuine convenience feature.
---
Otherwise yeah missiles would be screwed and so would the minmatar identical-range ammo groups like emp/fusion/pp
---
Haha god I hope this makes sense
---
Fort-unately (heh) it was a fortizar that my stuff was left in, so hopefully I can get it back without too much trouble. Guess I'll find out
---
Well I haven't logged into the game in over a year, but I like to keep up on the politics and wars happening.
---
I read a quote about EvE once that went: 'EvE Online, the most interesting game you'll never play.' Can't say I disagree with that.
---
You can have more fun .01 trading in jita than you can in provi.

The very likely reason why they are not working is that they have not changed their ESI URL to https://esi.evetech.net and are still using the old https://esi.tech.ccp.is/ URL

Contact Vertiso Ambraelle in game via mail or convo.  He will sort you out.

Since i don't feel like arguing i'll concede.

Horde, the perpetually inept alliance, is not in a position to be throwing stones. When things go well you are eager to take the credit, but when they go badly the other guy gets a guilt trip about killing newbies. Either stand on equal ground or learn your place. You don't get to have your cake and eat it too.
---
the rag seems to be around 10-12 off gate, if he had been there when the fleet warped in there's a pretty good chance he'd have been decloaked, probably warped to gate after the rorq said they landed on him.
---
As someone who lived in Provi for over a year, I can say that you made the right choice. My alliance was great, but being stuck under CVA's weak umbrella was just an ass pain. Plus, NRDS is probably the worst fucking doctrine. It sounds good on paper, but its an abortion in practice, as about 90% of neutrals moving throughout Provi turned out to be reds or red alts. NRDS just breeds fools into complacency, casuing them to be careless and lose their Rorqual to that one "friendly" neutral who was last seen doing relic sites for the last 6 months and not bothering anybody. It's just a bad system and I still don't understand why they won't switch to NBSI like the rest of eve.
---
But that's my two cents. As long as you're having more fun where you are now, that's all that matters.
---
Post your fit and which abyssal site and we can better help you. 
---
I mean that would be cool, like a little rack of icons above the moan modules row, and then the new hotkeys would just correspond to one of those. Would be a nice visual indicator of what the keys stand for.
---
The drugs is a cool idea for sure.
---
Paste is dangerous. Repair all, disabling active mods? Very dangrrous in fight, and goes beyond current capabilities. Not recommend hotkey for modulr repair. Ancil reps can reload that way quickly too but dangerous with reload time. What if you accidentally hit it? You're fucked. Though I guess it's okay to allow it for aar reload since the user has to set it manually and if they mess up it's their own fault
---
Still, paste is danger
---
Hey, if we're going so far as to add action support for drugs, why not deployables? Hotkeyability for mobile tractor/depot/cyno inhib would make several groups of people *very happy
---
i'm german too, I'd have recommended Little Red Riding Holes, Polk High, Vision or maybe Kiras Hhallas corp, but regarding english corps i'm not sure.
---
I guess the few times that I did get involved with WH space I was just unlucky to get that asshat =)
---
i paid for their loss. despite how cancerous titan is right now one gonna protect his rorqs.
---
I belive you.
---
I am kind of new, and I was indeed considering an edge case.
---
As for drones, moving in/out drones isn't a big problem, but if you want to do some micro-management, being able to simply select a drone would make it easier &amp; faster
---
Thank you, when I got back and learned about the new moon mining system I thought “goo” was everything from the fractured chunk. Now I know they are separate from the “adjective” minerals.

How to deal with Leshak spawns:
---
1: have a cap battery, preferably a large republic fleet one 
---
2: turn on your propmod as soon as you enter the room
---
3: double click in space slightly off the nearest one
---
4: overheat if your top speed is below 900m/s
---
5: start shooting as soon as you're in range
---
6: orbit at 5 as soon as you're at about 20
---
7: once you're about to kill the first, start approaching and orbiting the next one, while always maintaining some transversal speed
---
8: rinse and repeat

The Leshak rooms are some of the easiest, once you get the hang of it. It's just about getting under their guns. Start with the Renewing Leshaks if there are any, then proceed onto the Starving ones. The cap battery will greatly attenuate their neuting power.

CCP killed small gang blops when they ruined the widow... you can't drop ratting supers/carriers with blops BS anymore (unless youre ok losing as many as the 7.5bn super is worth)

why
---
Build is not supported is usually generated because you don't kill the launcher.  Kill the launcher when you are done playing as they are doing frequent updates.
---
how do you lick your lips and talk at the same time

When are horde going to do anything without daddy NC/PL watching your back?

You should just email support and see if theres options to tick off that you havent tried yet.

Radial menus might help with the speed for anyone who knows their ammos by icon, but I dont think it helps here. Let's start from QA perspective
---
Ok I have one of every ammo for my railgun. All 58 of them. Open radial menu on railgun--
---
How do you even represent that correctly? 6 degree wedges? A huge pattern of concentric layers? How do you tell apart Shadow Uranium and Spike?
---
Now that's extreme but highlights the weakness. radial menus are only really good when 2 constraints are there:
---
* a small and finite number of choices
---
* visually different and recognizable icons
---
Sadly ammo breaks both of those
---
Or if you win most of those fights the bigger groups will evict you.

You mean like, direct individual drones? As far as I know (other than fighters which have a ui for this) this only really happens in orca/porp/roequal mining but the way you can do it is click target, click drone, then go to selected item and engage

---
Idk now I wanna see the original trailer. I thought it was stated they used up all the resources
---
You could use that argument to dismiss any MMORPG or even any game in general.
---
Of course you get stomped early on. In any MMORPG you have to catch up in "levels" and/or "equipment". In any video game you have to catch up in pure skill and experience.
---
Just like most other MMORPGs, Eve has a "level cap". A focused 6-month old character doesn't fly a Retribution (for example) worse than a 10-year old one. After a certain point, more leveling only gives you a wider range of things you can do, but you max out in one specific thing relatively quickly.
---
If you can't handle that, MMORPGs might not be your genre at all, which is fair. But don't single out Eve for it.
---
I have never seen a videogame trailer more powerful than This is EVE Online.

I’ve thoroughly read Minmatar lore on space travel ascension, and I believe their engineers outfitted early space faring ships with them because “it worked for boats.” They were also the first to put rear spoilers on Honda Civic’s and claim it makes them go faster.

---
The issue is that all bounty-systems have the potential of teh bounty ending up in the hand of the person its put on. The only way I could think of makin it work d be if you could also limit the circle of persons who could claim the bounty to certain corps or alliances. Like, dunno, you place a bounty on some guy and make only groups you know that are at war with him able to claim the bounty on that guy.  
---
Could stiiiill be circumvented via spai-alts in opposing corps/alliances, but it d be likely too much effort to just dodge a bounty.

There are definitely some minmatar fits, for example, that use projectiles then fit something like a rocket or missiles launcher in its final hi-slot.

Looks like a carrier got trapped by a sabre and self destructed before anyone could kill it?

Yes, most pirate LP stores have relatively high volume and high value items, typically pirate ships and pirate faction specific implants.

we'll see, I'd start keeping that " i was self sufficient at 4m sp' to yourself, either you dont quite understand what that means in the scope of larger eve operations or you know way more about the game than you should.

And don’t forget the mechanic changes that reduced multiboxing, like isboxer plus cap changes nuking carrier ratting multiboxers, as well as combat multiboxers.

This.  The Ark is a beast when properly fit and with the proper implants, but honestly it's only  a matter of time until the gankers overcome this obstacle.  I haul out to lowsec with a DST now, then jump from lowsec, protecting the JF.  It's way more of a pain in the ass, but it's less likely to end in a 10b loss.
---
Not that I'm arguing against your statement (for all I know, you make very good points) but I couldn't take you seriously after "you create a loot piñata in your hole". 
---
Totally depends on the sites and how you want to run them. A single rattlesnake will run C3s in 10 minutes so that's roughly 300m an hour. It's like ratting with a nyx but less sp and cost. The only way to get the higher isk/hour is c6 sites with dreads
---
I'm not sure this is the highest they've ever been, is it?  I'm not at home to look.

Looks more like someone’s getting evicted and would rather get insurance fraud than free loot &amp; kills

I think I've solved the mystery of the fit! The key is the cap booster 3200s. *Where* have we seen those lately? Obviously he somehow stole it from the rage loot drop, fit it out solely from a dozen 3200 cans and a leftover loot can containing someone's random ratting loot, and has been trying to sneak it out of WH space ever since! It's the only thing that makes sense!

Bro, thank you for this! Idk why abyssal are so attractive to me but I am really struggling.  I can run L1 - L3's  with little to issues if I'm paying attention like I should be. But I have popped in L4s about 70% of the time and the other 30%, I am either leaving the last room with &gt;2 minutes on the clock or damage into structure. I am looking forward to trying this for leshaks and probably all battleships. If you are sharing fits, I wouldn't mind help in that area!
---
Yeah, our poor inhibs man. so many inhibs died to bring this titan kill.
---
Not realy. If you get to the point you want to farm pirate missions its almost always easier to start new alts to do your mission pulling.
---
I agree! 55 minutes is too goddamn long. I just wanted to see how far we can push the regular sperg after any video with comms.

Ok that makes more sense, self sufficient when joining a group means you can afford the life that group lives.  In almost every organized group there are fleet doctrines of some sort, and they have ships that fit into them. 
---
When an op is called you'll be expected to fill one of those roles in fleet, usually out of your own wallet (with some help if you die with some groups, but not all) from a list of ships that go with that particular doctrine.
---
Most groups have more than one doctrine (if they dont keep looking till you find a better group) and you'll be asked to have a tool for each of those on hand.
---
The more complex the group, often times the more expensive the ask as far as ships and numbers of ships go.
---
Now im pretty sure you're gonna be fine because you just had no idea of the levels of personal wealth in eve, no big deal.
---
&gt;is there any point to keeping your relations with a pirate faction high? Are their LP shops worth the effort?
---
These are not the questions you should be asking, but yes they are.
---
The questions you should be asking is "how can I break into doing this? What do I need to do?" and so on. If you want to get pirate faction LP here's a quick guide.
---
#PROS
---
* LP value for pirate factions much much higher, we're talking 2k isk/lp minimum for a lot of good shit, very good if you like money.
---
* People are always gonna want the shit from faction LP stores; the only pirate cruiser that I can think of that is in a shitty position right now is the Cynabal, and I still see those everywhere.
---
* Very little outright competition (but also a con i'll get to that in a minute)
---
#CONS
---
* The people who are running pirate LP have a vested interest in shooting you; that's not an issue for hisec runners or others, but NPC nullsec mission runners will try to murder you and everyone you love if you muscle in on """their""" turf. This is especially true in areas with dense amounts of security agents. Expect to lose a lot of ships if you don't join the local crowd.
---
* Getting standings for pirate factions is a BITCH. If you were lucky and you picked the right hisec faction to run missions with, some of them have Epic Arcs that payout high values of NPC faction standing. This can only be done 1 time every ~3 months, so if you do that and you still are at -2 faction standing towards pirates glhf, hope you like grinding lvl 1 sec missions.
---
* Getting the highest payout missions and running them means Burner missions. These will need several alts to do (but they can be run in specialized ships). The reason for multiple alts is so that way you can multibox the amount of required DPS + logistics frigs for them to be run. Remember that 2k isk/lp value I talked about earlier? When you're making 500k LP an hour at a minimum that's a raw 1b value that you're gaining. Pretty cool, but if you have a lowend computer, that will be out of reach for you tbqh. Specialized fits to run the burners are okay if you want to run solo but will not pay out nearly as high as burner squads.
---
* Hope you like running your own logistics. Don't be stupid and haul your shit out in a non-nullified T3 or something like that; invest in a blops or two, bridge a DST around, and be smart about how you transport your shit.
---
Its true that large-scale Rorq multiboxing or super ratting may be safer and more reliable than this, but this stuff is great if you like to be outside the sov game and live on the fringes. IMHO the style of gameplay that arises in NPC null regions like Stain and Venal and other places like this around this content is how Eve is supposed to be played but v0v
---
you can also deactivate them by clicking on the ones under the locked target if you need that.

did they not have a response fleet nearby to deal with roaming super gangs or what

thanks but once it was mentioned i realized it did say something about improved serpentis research thing. i would say "the more you live, the more you learn" but since this is eve.. living is not a credible choice.

Ranger Ragiment like China alliance and like another parts of GOTG not have strong ustz online. And this is BL, they have supercap fleet in Venal like main home region and can easy drop it in Branch, just need one or two jumps. Like i guy who life in Branch long time i can say - its so stupid ratting on big toys in ustz prime time (full night in china or euro) and try drop just bunch of caps on BL because this is 99% chance got a BL supercap response 
---
Ship specific too. So any ammo set to certain hotkeys on certain ships would be saved to that ship, that way you don't risk overwriting an ammo setting for an entirely different ship.
---
assuming perfect refining, a me8 ragnarok copy (+me10 parts), a t1 rigged structure, and using last night's jita availability&amp;prices, you can get the compressed ore for a ragnarok for 37.5b (including \~730m excess minerals) right now :P

Since your mind is already set, this is just me grating on your ideas for the sake of the other wh-brost here.   
---
* if you are not in a 2-man corp, there will be people to scan. If you move to wh space and are not prepared to scan, then stay in k space I guess. This doesn't mean to pull an all-nighter, soul crushing 500+ sigs scan - exploration usually has a purpose: want content - roll your statics ( so you scan 4-5 sigs every few minutes), want a hisec chain - roll until you get  kspace hole, want to rat roll until you get a decent ratting, etc. Very flexible imo   
---
* No one knows how much loot you got stashed, unless you have spies and you bragged to them   
---
* The solution to this is to live frugal while in wh so the moving process is pretty easy. You will need to move to kspace if you plan on a long break - but moving your 5-10 ships is different from moving your 60 ship armada  
---
* you NEED to have a scouting alt - and even that is pretty optional tbh, but then someone has to take that full role. Other things may include "specializing" your other two dudes on an account to run PI for lots of iskies.   
---
* Well nothing to add here. If you want to "relax" while playing eve, wh space is not for you. For me this is awesome because otherwise k space wants you to relax all the time unless you really go look for it.  I have pretty limited play times so i'm just going for full experience every time I log in.

* Idk what to say about this - you want to have a 2-3 person wh corp - that would also work, just get good at it and play with what numbers you have - 2-3 means you can't do much but gank solo dudes or very small pve fleets and go kitey/cheap when trouble comes knocking. As with every other place in eve if the enemy brings more you're pretty much fucked. 
---
* you can be in jita from a wh in less than a few seconds. sometimes by choice, sometimes forcibly   
---
* what the fuck?

Tbh I think you just need to get a proper mindset for wormholes. It's hard to adapt to the culture when you come from the hoarding inclined life in k space but here it's going to be different. You need to accept the fact that you'll be evicted at all times and all you have in there is basically lost. The first rule of eve still applies but now to your whole inventory. IF this means you can only afford to have 1 t3c in there - so be it - it will be hard but not impossible to live.   
---
First time doing BLOPs with my sb. Got bridged by a Redeemer and took out a bs and its support. That was awesome. Cloaky ganky shit is my favorite thing to do.
---
Honestly if I wasnt so space poor, I'd buy a dozen legions and fly them all the time (by far my favorite ship, confessor a close second). The versatility and covert capabilities make it great. 
---
Honestly it's just the skill loss that keeps me from flying it constantly (that and being poor).
---
Boson ratting. 
---
How much isk/hr are we talking? Also whats the time commitment needed for wh? I only play here and there, currently just playing solo farming abyssals for isk
---
Good. Join us 
---
join spoopy newbies, brave's wh corp. I was in the same situation as you, bored of f1 piloting and exploring. i joined spoopy and never looked back.
---
It's a roller bud how high r u rn
---
yep, i said as much too
---
not only minnie, but cormorant, dramiel, dragoon, it happens too
---
I could see its usage to have it for the dramiel, multiple ammos to one hotkey:
---
* emp s / cn mjolnir
---
* pp s / cn inferno
---
* fusion s / cn nova
---
* barrage s / jav
---
* hail s / rage
---
but is in most cases it is not useful and it adds a good deal of complexity to the feature. also the secondary missile is usually minor dps
---
is a good thing to consider for future though, and make the feature expanded upon that
---
oh yea i guess that makes sense
---
yep, like however the keep at range distance is stored, the ammo setup list can be the same way
---
And now Zarvox knows why there weren't bubbles up :D

You have about 2 minutes to loot from the time you are detected on grid(uncloak). 2 cans and run away, 3 cans if you have the skills. Even if yhou succeed in the hack a fleet will warp in and kill you at the end of the timer.
---
Is that something people do unironically? Dread ratting? How much do fits typically cost, and is it a solo activity?
---

---
Got NASA job skills, call me astronaut Neil 
---
haha same, I'd really look forward to that. I already learned to identify all of the bajillion ships and guns in this game by sight, and it really wasnt an easy process. It would be really nice to new players especially if we could have ammos removed from the list of having to memorize and recall mid-combat.
---
I know a lot of people had trouble with the laser crystal ranges even before the trig stuff came. I mean, I can tell them white multi then rainbow and explain the t2, but seriously who has time to sort crystals by color in their head when stuff is happening?
---
And those have colors to sort them out even. Who here has any freaking clue what order the hybrid ammos are in by range? Other than spike and antimatter, can *anyone* take a list of the ammos and put them in a roughly correct order?
---
This is stupid post
---
Sabre is not OP - simply have all the traits of a good dictor.          
---
Those values prove that other interdictors need to be 'looked at'.      
---
"Aha! The final rorq has arrived! Now we outnumber you. Initiating the 51% majority vote to claim the structure as our own!" 
---
A couple months ago I ran the figures for building an avatar based off of delve mineral prices. The total cost was 36 billion or so isk buying off the market. 
---
And buying and reprocessing ore you could get an extra 7-12% discount depending on the contract. 
---
Sabre best for gatecamp (fastest) and shield fleets (which are sort of current meta). Flycatcher is very, very good depending on circumstances. 1v1 flycatcher is way better than sabre. Heretic for armor small gang, it's "ok" but this kind of fleet is super-rare. Eris is terrible.
---
Heretic might need a slight buff and eris a big one (so you can fit it decently with bubble launcher on)...
---
no your obtuseness just triggered me beyond simply constructing an argument. Imo you're so far into your own shitty reasoning that there's no way of bringing you back so I've just, you know, stated your coordinates. :P 
---
Oh boi a tengu fleet now that's something I would like 
---
Sort of updated my answer to you ^^
---
It gives "overpowered" intel to the hunted as well. And usually the target has more time to check KB than the hunter who has to check d-scan, launch probes, warp around etc. in system. Target sees the hunter 5-20 jumps away on intel and deducing it's a cyno alt/ tackle for fleet isn't hard.
---
Sure you can use it to look for ratting systems (losses), but dotlan and even ingame map are good at that too- activity/ people in space etc. (dotlan is way more "clean" and easier to see the route that's why people use it)
---
yes, this is exactly what happened to me :) 
---
i will be more careful next time, today i learnt. and yes, 2 minutes is how it went, not 15 mins, so other noob explorers like me, please take this info into account. I did manage to loot two bcp for some mobile depot thing, i will be able to afford buying a new ship once i build/sell them. the frostline module though, so young!

Can people do that without renting? C6 dread ratting? Are 3 naglfars sufficient? 
---
Part of me doesn't want CCP to listen because I just got my alt into a sabre and heading towards a loki knowing how good they are. But they really need to look into balancing the racial flavors of subcaps. It's pretty clear many are not living up to CCP's vision of them.
---
I AM IMMORTAL YOUR PUNY CAPITALS HOLD NO SWAY OVER MY WILL TO BUBBLE YOU

4 nestors print about 750m an hour and are decently cheap. IDK about caps but considering how lucrative C5+ sites I'm sure its a crap ton.

---
Eris needs a mid slot and a little more fitting breathing room. 
---
Hecate says try fitting the probe launcher and the dps 
---
Eris says slide into the small
---
That would definitely be cool if it weren't too much visual clutter. Like little icon row above the main ship modules maybe. It would be nice as a visual confirmation of the ammos and also give a UI element to it.
---
The drugs is a cool idea for sure. I think that should definitely be put in if it turns out not too hard. In fact, why don't we talk about personal deployables while we're at it? I'm sure there would be many who would be tickled pink by being able to hotkey up mobile depots, tractor units, and cyno inhibitors.
---
It might be a bit harder to develop and test, but one can dream :)
---
think of it as a dialect and not an insult. your sentiment is sound, but the reality is it doesn't matter that it sounds rude
---
i'm glad you posted it. it's too easy for me to scrub the video if it's too long, can't do that if you got rapid zooming cameras with dubsteb and anime furries. +1 from me
---
excellent video, really captures the fun of being in a large group on the prowl. everyone's got a job
---
Yeah we did! New Year started off right!
---
did you say ares I don't see an interceptor on grid
---
too true , they could be a DPS monster with a little more CPU/Powergrid
---
at least for small fights 
---
There is only one pass critically needed and that is grid adjustments.
---
Sure, Sabre is the fastest and that's good and nice. It also gets those nice Minmatar T2 resists. However, shield is heavier on CPU and as such both the Flycatcher and Sabre have a more adequate CPU than the godawful thing that is the Eris.
---
Has anyone actually taken a look at the bubble launcher? Did anyone making the armor dictors, Eris in particular, actually realize how CPU intensive those are? It's actually silly how little CPU you have left over.
---
Maybe dial it back on the launcher, but I think that grid is the focus of the issue. It goes the opposite way with the Sabre too--you can have a very fast and tanky interdictor with 2 shield extenders, guns, cloak, etc. If the powergrid is dialed back a bit then the 2 SE setup will drop too (though people will ree pretty hard). Meanwhile the Eris can't fit a tank to save its life.
---
With blaster dps and decent speed it would already be a fine ship without the new mid. It just needs help with cpu.
---
Oh really? Never knew that. So you just click the Icon and it decycles?
---
no u

---
sabre hasn't been adjusted in years and years and years (dictors in general for that matter) aside from allowing ammo reloads through session changes, which is a massive buff to all dictors across the board.
---
i wouldn't fret about the "but i just trained this!" thing; they won't be changed anytime soon, if ever

Lowsec pleb here, would giving probes aggression timers help at all?
---
Maybe adjust the tanks too?
---
I think maybe! I did address a bit of that in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ahpno0/qol_idea_ammo_hotkeys/eehsvwy?utm_source=reddit-android).
---
Now that I think about it though, it would be workable if you could somehow limit and filter the acceptable ammos for the radial menu. That way even if you pick up some random-ass ammo from loot, there's no problem with clutter. Also a faction/t2 corner icon on the ammos would help with visual differentiation maybe?
---
&gt; beautiful boson trap
---
No such thing.
---
Nah
---
Yeah, i'm in that channel.
---
Why even respond to this retard with more than 2-3 words?
---
well dictor need to be fast agile and have enough tank to survive in acceptable manner.            
---
Main issue with armour ones is that they are much slower and agile when you fit them for tank, and EHP is not so fantastic when you look at the flycatcher ... also reps on the end of the cycle quite often are late for armor dictors
---
Well there is always the excpetion to the rule, TDSIN, Ember sands, and WHSOC like to blob more in recent times.
---
Many dopes bit on this troll. You may have to add /s for these goofs to get it.
---
My man: /r/ketorecipes and /r/keto
---
Shield tank is also letting it catch reps before it dies.       
---
Armor dictors are dying as they die before cycle ends.          
---
For small gangs - like try to burn to the gate in a plated heretic ... and then do the same in a sabre. 
---
interdictor != dps role

`ccpls ammo bindings unlocked via sansha lp and lowsec gate to stain`

When I try to do a fitting, sometimes I don't have 'em ought CPU. What skills do I need in order to get more CPU since I have CPU management up to V?

lmao that's quite a way to open up a comment
---

inb4 salty super pilots, give dictors a 5k hic point instead of a disruption probe launcher so theyre useful in lowsec.

Wormhole life doesn't have to be as srs bsns as you indicate here. As long as you have some friends, it isn't always you that has to scan, or run logistics. You don't even need a scout alt if there's more than a couple of people online in your corp.
---
&gt; I can be in jita from null in 20 mins tops
---
Can you really? On the J side, you're not understanding how it works - it's not "I need to go to Jita right now, find me a chain", it's "oh look, there's a 3 jump Jita wormhole, let's do logistics today".
---
sure glad the launcher came to exist, its about as great of an experience as nu-chat
---
Let me know when the supers leave their home region.
---
They have yet to deploy titans/supers away. They are basically the eve version or Modern China. Defensive posture only.
---
NRDS is a nice idea but in a game where alting is accepted, it can't possibly work. You're just giving raiders the first shot. Particularly when game mechanics allow instant teleportation of capital ships.
---
Light dictor role is not to tackle a single ship but multiple ships.    
---
You can also deploy multiple bubbles as you move - don't mix 2 ship classes with totally different applications and roles. 
---
Krabbing in nullsec be like:
---
Undock vni
---
Orbit
---
Drop drones
---
Come back in half an hour
---
Make 60m/h risking less than an exhumer
---
The trouble is that dictors essentially have one important attribute - how fast they can get in and drop the bubble. A lot of dictor piloting is suicide bubbling so the HICs or heavy tackle can arrive; something as fast as the sabre with a bubble launcher and no tank at all would still be used a lot.
---
Eris definitely needs looking at though. I think I've only seen one in space once.
---
why, hello there!
---
yes :)
---
Eh, I started playing hockey competitively when I was 5 and continued to play it competitively until I finished high school. So 13 years of playing more or less year round, going to skills camps in the summer, practicing 5 days a week, traveling for tournaments, hitting the weight room, strategy sessions/watching film of other teams/tactics, etc. Sports are pretty serious. When you play at a high level your entire life is shaped by it. I've always been surprised by how similar being in a clan in an online game is to being a member of a sports team.
---
I played hockey at a high level, by no means professional, but still at a high level. And my favorite moments of all my years of hockey, all the thousands of hours I put into it, are pick up games at the park. 
---
not all alliances have 100+ of those.
---
so for those alliances it can be a substancial loss
---
I think the real issue here is you have to look at a dictors job,  it's all about speed + buffer. Sabre and Flycatcher do that well. Armor things are slow, therefore they do it less well. That being said, add a mid slot to eris, add a low slot to heretic. Ez balance.
---

Didn't they say they're working on it, but they can't do it yet so they added the destruction visual and later they'll make it shrink.

It really doesn't matter... You wont be limited in skips or skills. So just pick the faction you think is best looking ect.. as long as you don't pick minmitar.

Yes dread ratting is pretty good.

It depends a lot of solo dreads people run seem to range 3bil-4bil.

While running triple dread in c5 can be cheaper atleast fit wise for each dread.

The time to replace them is virtually nothing solo dread in C5 can make 800mil a hour so the time to replace the dread isn't high.

 **Armour** ([British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English) or [Canadian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_English)) or **armor** ([American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English); [see spelling differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-our,_-or)) is a protective covering that is used to prevent damage from being inflicted to an object, individual or vehicle by direct contact [weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon) or [projectiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile), usually during combat, or from damage caused by a potentially dangerous environment or activity (*e.g.*, cycling, construction sites, etc.).

Girl. That was a girl. She left CCP a couple of years ago
---
You can also use cpu implants, if you just need a small amount 
---
Think the idea is train the other chars on the Omega account into PI and then pump skills on top that you can extract. It doubles their passive income, because the unextractable 5mil will get you more than enough to be running full PI plus transport for passive income, plus each month's SP above that extracted. So each character's income is PI production plus SP production.
---
Nothing wrong with the other cap batteries. The RF one is just way easier to fit than the T2 variant (320/40 vs 480/60), it gives 27% cap warfare resistance as opposed to 25%, and 1820 GJ instead of 1625 GJ. 
---
The Thukker one gives you slightly less total cap than RF (1755 GJ), 1% more cap warfare resistance than RF, but is even easier to fit on powergrid (280/42). 
---
So all in all, there's no reason to ever use a T2 large battery over a Republic Fleet one on a PVE fit, especially given that it costs only around 30 mil.
---
About fits: what cruisers can you fly? Faction, Pirate, HACs? And what tier of sites are you going for?
---
There is no need to buff everything in the game. Sabre, Flycatcher and heretic have niche roles where they are strong enough to justify their existence. Eris should definitely get a fitting buff so it can find it’s own niche eventually.
---
Amarr is the best if you do role play stuff, and if you don’t do role play stuff it doesn’t matter, so you definitely made the right choice 
---
I regularly use an AB fit Deimos for T4 Firestorms. It works just fine.

Yah, like CPU is tight on the Tar, but faction cap rechargers are dirt cheap and while faction capital cap boosters are touch pricey he should be able to afford them especially as a titan pilot.

make map sensitivity constant. Currently the map sensitivity depends on how far the camera is from the currently focused location (usually your location).

Faction only matters for starting skills and what your character looks like. Beyond that, unless you're into roll play, every faction is functionally the same. Gallente and Amarr give the most starting SP followed by Minmatar and then Caldari, but only by a few thousand points (375745 for Gal/Amarr, 373416 for Min, 366468 for Cal). The difference in starting skills and sp will be erased in a few weeks.
---
You probably don't want to enter a small in an eris, since thrashers, coercers, dragoons, catalysts and algos can all enter which are way outside your engagement profile.
---
You're supposed to shield tank heretics you idiot.....
---
Soo why are they fighting over c1? 
---
Thats i name i havent heard for a while.
---
To solo dread you need a near perfect Nag char.
---
No problem man. Deyve Starbuck in game, hit me up sometime.
---
Not in this case. WH space has the Superior [faction] Covert Research Facility, which has rats too.

---
This link any good?
---
Appreciate the effort in the vid. Keep makin em!
---
That's not as much as an issue in this case, because it's not like there's another class of ship that does the same job. Unlike nerfing a solo pvp ship where people will use something else, if people want light bubble tackle, they *have* to use dictors, so you *can* just balance them in a vacuum and have fewer ill effects than a general combat ship.
---
&gt;
---
    The people who are running pirate LP have a vested interest in shooting you; that's not an issue for hisec runners or others, but NPC nullsec mission runners will try to murder you and everyone you love if you muscle in on """their""" turf. This is especially true in areas with dense amounts of security agents. Expect to lose a lot of ships if you don't join the local crowd.
---
Just use 3 kestrels and a griffin
---
who in their right mind thought a monochrome ui was a good idea
---
800 dps with no bubble fitted... it's good meme fit but the last thing fc wants to hear is "I can't bubble, I'm a dps dictor" XD
---
I think I saw it once or twice in 5 years. And can recall on one roam someone being genuinely confused what kind of ship it is and providing incorrect intel because of that (we landed in bubble as a result).
---
I mean, I call it as I see it. Keskora bringing up goodfights and don't be a dick, right after being a dick is highly ironic. 
---
All I said was he's baiting too hard. :shrug:
---
How would giving probes aggro help Eris being terrible? Also this change would nerf small gang pvp as you would need 2 dictors (one would be ineffective as it could not keep target bubbled on both sides of a gate).
---
You could try a petition. Explaining you were not aware of the danger. If you see something that you haven't encountered before, google works wonders, dodged many potential destructions that way myself.
---
For ghost sites, I usually only hack two cans just to be safe. You can go for a third one but that is usually pretty risky. Good luck though on the next adventure \o/
---
[removed]
---
oh, no need.  i wasn't complaining, i was just wondering if perhaps the situation was something specific, turns out, it was :) 
---
thank you, you too! 
---
yes, actually i had managed to hack 3 out of 4 cans and was almost done with the fourth, the loot didn't seem much, but two bcps worth nothing will actually render me around 100 mils once i build the items.  i think i can be certain of the outcome if i stop at the second, just to make sure. plenty enough to get back my precious ship. 
---
thanks for taking time with this! :) 
---
I don't do any of these stuff but that stuff is very neat. Good job!
---
What is an Echoes Discord?
---
If you want to be in a tiny 2-3 man corp, find yourself a wormhole with a NS static and just use that for roaming. Don't like the region you rolled into? Roll it with some battleships and get a new one!
---
Almost no scanning required beyond getting the new static, no need to worry about being a loot pinata (nobody really cares about evicting low class wormholes, especially with kspace statics), no need to worry about going afk (see above), no need to dedicate a ton of time (only need the 1 astra), no need for alts (see above), easy logistics (low class wormholes connect to each other more often than high class)
---
All natural, no flavor enhancers, Gluten free dead caps™ 
---
Discord is a voice/chat service. Lots of gamers use Discord for clan/guild chats and other things. 
---
I got discord, but what is echoes discord?
---
I know that, that's what I have done with my main untill I got him to mediocre flying skills for some ships. I recently made an alt, and was wandering if there would be other missions that give you skill points like the seeker investigation series.
---

You actually need really high skills to be able to survive avengers in C6 on your own.

Did you participate in Bill Whomst's ISK Halving Service?
---
Still man. your hatred of us is oddly touching.
---
You must be new, nowadays even the worst language is much more tame than it used to be.
---
great job, glad to see this updated. Thank you
---
Sweet
---
Sweet stuff! Now for me to die to everything in this list...
---
I personally believe a wormhole with a LS or NS static (depending which flavor of space you prefer to pvp in) are the best way for a kspace corp to transition to wormholes.
---
Take HK as an example. They were evicted from their C5 and moved to a C2 with a null static and they're still alive and kicking it (and still evicting russians)
---
the (new) map is absolute trash, seems like it prefers looks over actual functionality, i bet the intern that worked on it only did missions in highsec
---
This sounds a lot like all the EFT warriors who fawned over the Diemost back in the day.
---
WINGSPAN comes to mind, but he hasn't uploaded in a while. So I don't know what's up with them.
---
PL in destroyers while RR in supers. It must be 2019.

eris is actually hidden op, you can fit dual prop and a 400mm plate on it and just orbit the hostile anchor in an armor brawling fleet
---
For loot most likely.
---
Agile has a reputation for being really good when handled well by managers who actually know what's going on and are willing to trust their programmers a bit, but really bad, even potentially worse than traditional development strategies, if it's mistreated, because you wind up spending 95% of your time in redundant meetings or catching up to the same goal over and over.
---
I have to wonder which side of the fence CCP is on these days.
---
In a C6 sure maybe. I haven't personally run C6 sites.
---
In a C5? A Nag can do it with dread 1 and meta guns.
---
I don't hate the people. You are a good man. As are others. 
---
Good stuff as always. 
---
Dronelands calling, they want their title back, ta.

It's great when you do come across them though. They all have void loaded because of eft stats.

Mind sharing Your fit?

---
Yeah it's what he said: WH life is not for everyone. 
---
NCdock?
---
Flycatcher does **not** do the speed thing well. It's the slowest of all the dictors and has the least low slots.
---
Any chance to have that in Windows too?
---
&gt; remove and rebuild storage and manufacturing facilities due to trying to keep link as close possible correct? 
---
God no.  It's okay if 3 of your 6 manufacturing facilities are often idle.  
---
Do you have one ECU or two?  One is more efficient, but every 2-6 days you have to delete it and switch it to the other resource, assuming you're making P2.
---
They will if they're killed often enough.  But that's pretty difficult.
---
We share a Tripwire map between us
---
How do the BMs work between all of you?
---
Honestly? Nothing in Eve is stable income. 
---
You could inject into [insert high SP career] and make isk off that, but you haven't experienced enough to know that you won't hate it in a few months.
---
You could buy up some BPOs and run off copies, but the market could fluctuate and make that dry up.
---
You could set up a skill farm, but that could get boring and you'll be too tempted to 'get high off your own supply' since your main character is pretty minimal SP-wise.
---
Best is to bank a chunk until you really know what you _want_ to do with it, and spin the rest on what feels fun just now, whether that's injecting up to the next ship type, investing in some station trading commodities, buying forty frigates to go roam in without worrying about losses, or whatever. Use your 'fun budget' to discover what you enjoy, and what you're good at, and then evaluate what to do with your nest egg.
---
Yeah. What the fuck do you mean by echos man?
---
This is a winable fight for the Merlin, but it needs to be the 2x web flavor and you need to play it for all it's worth.
---
It requires a decent time commitment depending on the size of group your in. You could set up a farmhole and farm until you have a dedicated dread alt to throw in there with a sp farm on it so it doesn't require a sub.
---
I'd recommend T2 siege and t2 guns if you want to clear decently. I know a corp member has cleared C5 sites with like level 3 skills but it's really not worth it at that level. If you have two characters I'd suggest 2 rattles or nestors until you can inject into t2 gun/siege then I'd just farm for a perfect alt to throw into a farmhole and you will easily fund yourself enough.
---
That's a good idea, I felt like I was running a little long, their was definitely more to say.
---
Agree with this. Most apparent thing is the lack of coloured neocom icons. I still occasionally look at a glance for green when trying to go to the fitting window
---
I have heard this argument a lot, but if you look at T_Sky's guide the Breacher has the highest win rate against other t1 frigates at shocking 68% (which of course includes both strong and weak players flying the Breacher). For comparison the Atron, which I think is also very strong but requires some good skills to fly sits at at 45% win rate. 
---
I've never used the Eris but from the sounds of it it would be great for wormhole pvp. Great dps at short range and if you pop a bubble and tackle targets when they come through you can lay in a lot of damage.
---
This has been widely viewed as a "good move".  
---
Just so you know, Caldari&gt;Amarr, but those two factions are head, shoulders, rest of the capsuleer body and more above the other factions.

Give the 2 armour ones a role bonus to agility while plates are fitted.

I didn't record all the fleet obviously but one thing elo does that I really like is moderate his intensity and walk back if he goes too far.  He called people out after fleet for insulting each other (don't shit on your alliance mates), he gives good feedback, and he apologizes if he gets caught up. Would I call my fleet retarded? Probably not. But I'm not gonna hold getting frustrated against a guy who is doing 20 things at once and watching people fail to do 1 thing, especially if I know that he's very likely to explain later why he is frustrated and how we can all do it better next time.
---
Or we'd kill a few hundred bil in excavators and watch you all tell each other they're just drones and you're definitely not counting how many hours you'll have to mine to make back the loss
---
I love your work man, I am always genuinely excited when another one of these comes out.
---
Haha well, Eve viewers do like comms versus a full "music video". Many entities have some level of security therefore video makers tend to take the easier route and eliminate all comms. The sideeffect is that a video with comms feel like a powerpoint presentation..... something we learned how to do at age 12. In my opinion, music should be used to cover sensitive information or "boring parts" of a fleet.
---
welcome to repsquad airlines this is rahne, I will be your captain today
---
Heretic really isn't useful except in retribution fleets. Eris is trash. It's a non functional ship.
---
Yes I too misunderstand which ships move fast enough to get to a fight before it's over and which ships you'd drop to defend a titan 
---
tldr
---
BLOPS died with the T3 changes. Just put the idea on ice untill CCPlz sort there shit out &amp; stop making krabbing stupidly safe
---
https://www.ccpgames.com/news/2018/netease-and-ccp-reveal-eve-echoes-an-authentic-eve-online-experience-for
---
Yes, that’s right. 
---
very cool
---
A perfect alt would cost you around that much if not a bit more. I mean I think it's completely feasible its a fair bit of grinding I wouldn't recommend grinding straight to it and burning yourself out. Just budget your isk a bit it adds up really.
---
If your goal is to krab the least amount possible I think it's worth the headache as I said don't burn yourself out just set some isk aside etc. 
---
A farmhole is a hole you clear its home sites for isk though you can still do static sites. It's mainly to push krabbing outside of the chain so you can pvp more. I mean it depends without a dedicated dread alt you could get a small pos with a sma corprate hanger to store the dread in corp hanger and a astra for rolling alts if you use them (less then 1 injector iirc). Really easy to setup just a bit of hole control until everything is anchored if its subcaps you want it at a planet to kill drifters to maximize the isk. 
---
It depends on your characters if its a solo activity with a solo dread alt and a few very cheap rolling alts you could throw in empty slots on main/ alt account and a few alpha scanners in there can be completely solo. I do know people who have went into with a friend to make it cheaper or don't have the isk for two dread alts to duo dread(1 haw 1 cap gun).
---
Rolling holes in C5 is pretty easy its 1 pass with carriers I can't go back to subcap rolling tbh. With good skills scanning chains isn't much of a issue you just generally want to do logistics when you get a good hole. If you scanning skills are good it won't be bad specially with virtues it can be abit time consuming though its what you spend a lot of time doing.
---
tl
---
Thanks for the honest answer, I think I will give him some more time to get into the game. If he gets heavy into it, I will consider the next event. Hope you guys have a great time, sounds fun!
---
&gt; would giving probes aggression timers help at all?
---
&gt; 
---
No
---
Just stop mining and start having fun in eve :p
---
All I want is my Armageddon skins on my Redeemer and bhaalgorn :(
---
I have fun mining, to each his own ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
&gt; I want to be the "Nah, not worthy the effort" ship.
---
distance matters more than the fit itself. it is a big difference whether you mine in Uedama or in the far corners of high sec.
---
permit is still to be paid in the far corners though, don't forget.
---
None... Skiffs are the most unappealing target for ganking in EVE, they just have to much EHP with a not so powerful/very cgeap fitting, most people will let you alone, since covetors and Retrievers are way more easy to find and kill than you are.
---
If you get ganker in a skiff, you either are flying thought very dangerous territory where people just want to fuck with you, or you stepped in someone's toe...
---
Either way, ganking a skiff just isn't profitable enough!
---
Unless if course you for some reason want your skiff to have a incursion ship's worth of EHP at the cost of being 2x more expensive than one... In that case everyone will want a piece of you! lol
---
Obviously, the more tanked one will discourage gankers more. It will take twice as many ships to kill the tanked one vs the yield one so you are more likely to be left alone than they guy who fits for yield or flies a squishier mining ship. 
---
Is that all your question is?
---
I would do the Mid slots from tank fit and the low slots from yield fit. Because if you if you lose to much yield it will take you longer to „pay it of“ or „replace it“. 
---
I mean it’s eve let’s face it eventually it will die just depends at what point it viable. 
---
I know that, the question starts when gankers have already found ships to choose
---
The begging tutorial rewards free sp?!  Ohhh shit, I need to do it! lol
---
llink km
---
U right bro, keep it goin :)
---
&gt;Also this change would nerf small gang pvp as you would need 2 dictors (one would be ineffective as it could not keep target bubbled on both sides of a gate).
---
Bubbling and surviving would be impossible for any dictors in 90% of the situations since you can't jump out. This isn't a small gang issue.
---
yes that's all, I still have this question because I believe the cons of tanking fitting is the cost, would you think this tank fitting, even being 2x harder, would attract because of the loot they would get?
---
ewww low sec
---
Also to add to that you will almost definitely get ganked eventually, but you'll make so much money doing it by then it won't really matter.
---
Thanks for sharing 
---
This is eve would be low ass numbers without the bots
---
Top quality. This sub needs more of this stuff and less shitposting
---
Favorite and forget.
---
Good stuff tho.
---
Totally different bonus ... or agility buff?
---
A fresh nag alt costs roughly 18-20b to inject the last time I did one. You want t2 siege and gun 5 at minimum, you can slow train dread 5. Its worth it if you know how to stay safe and not die. Even if you cant get a c6, c5 space is mostly empty 
---
Just flying a skiff or procurer is usually enough to discourage ganking. Order of preference for gankers is usually: Hulk, Mackinaw, covetor, retriever. 
---
Power creep is a pretty nasty thing in general. T3D's were a prime example of it (20k ehp svipul) so hopefully they'll do it well when they eventually Soon™ get to it.
---
There's a lot on the line. Tensions are high. A single mistake can lead to thousands of dollars being lost or hours of planning down the shitter
---
Muscle memory. My PI setup is set for every 2 days so every other day I remember to redo them.
---
Been seeing a lot of you guys lately and I can't complain at all ;) Great fights lately, and thanks for sharing your perspective. Always nice to see the insights of other corps. 
---
Make dotlan the map it's so much better please and thank you ccp
---
Impressive... what range (optimal) are we talking about here?
---
Hopefully they let me. Unfortunately, most of the time we ask for stuff ends up being NDAed. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74687524/
---
no real money was harmed in the making of this video
---
Rev,Nag,Moros they all work fairly well tbh nag is the most popular by far for krabbing though.
---
Most people playing EVE are old enough to remember when "retarded" was considered a tame insult to replace way worse ones for retarded people.
---
The Proteus is fine. It's not a part of the current META, but it will still wreck some faces. 
---
A decent alternative while you're skilling up might be a Stratios if you want something with a cloak. The fits can be pricey, but it's a lot of fun to fly.
---
Rolling and scanning... Let's talk in 3 month how excited you are in wh space
---
Is it worth changing from the Buzzard to the Astero? I've had a couple close calls in my Buzzard, so I'm getting more and more paranoid, I figure the Astero would get me out of trouble just that little bit faster and help with relic/data sites while I wait for both skills to hit 5, plus being able to carry drones would be comforting.
---
Thanks! That's my favorite part too, he timed it well
---
If 1 corp scans a hole we need we’ll just have 1 person from each corp scan it then corp bookmark it 
---
The actual problem is that armor reps apply much more slowly  so armor dictors are almost impossible to save in fleet situations but you have a chance at least with shield.
---
Just downloaded the game yesterday, having fun so far. Wanted to know if there is any alternative to having to right click an enemy ship to track,lock on, orbit, etc. sometimes takes forever to right click exactly on the center of a ship for the menu to pop up and that gets frustrating. Am I missing something?
---
This
---
You haven't played the game lately have you?
---
Probably the same time when you guys realize it's a bad idea to dread ball under a super cap umbrella. 
---
Agile (if done well) removes a lot of the things that can get in the way of successful development. But it doesn't make actually designing and building the system easy, if it wasn't going to be easy in the first place.
---
Fantastic work.  I would also say do one for cruisers but I can only imagine how much time it took to compile this data, so thank you for your effort on this!
---
Awesome work
---
The biggest problem with development to be honest.
---
And everyone always projects their problems onto everyone else.
---
Low ass numbers even with the bots
---
As already mentioned: Colors. I often find myself clicking the wrong icon in the Neocom since they look so similar at a quick glance. 
---
Ahh I see. I was lost
---
&gt;Medium Shield Extenders
---
&gt;No drone mods
---
You don't need a survey scanner.
---
Thankfully we have BL on a short leash! If they get a fight they better let us know so we can enjoy content. 
---
that's not what I asked
---
reduction in mwd sig and cap like assault frigs
---
Maintain left mouse button and you should have a easier to use menu. You also have most option view the selected item window you can clic.
---
This is nice, thank you.
---
we are.
---
Paging brisc
---
Well you can also go days without finding targets 
---
Some big alliance: fight us in ten te cruisers or else!
---
We: we have two players online....
---
REEEEEEEE eviction because you didn't feed!! 
---
I would keep the buzzard. If you are hunted down, the Astero fitted for exploration isn't going to change much than an Buzzard, except it cost more. Also covops lvl 5 only helps with prob scanning, not hacking.
---
I was speaking of the amount of isk lost by the Rangers.
---
More likely +15 to sensor strength
---
[http://evehelper.tk/](http://evehelper.tk/)

maybe this can help in the meanwhile \^\_\^
---
I think this is why RnK videos are so good and so well received. They provide comms, important annotations for relevant information, and sped up house music to fast forward through the boring/slow parts. 
---
And good content I supposed....
---
All of them. Someone last week made a sign with cans on the Jita undock. CCP make a new UI.
---
You can also click on them on your overview (the list of objects around you on the right side of your screen) - they tend to move a lot less there. Also try to zoom out a bit, that also makes it easier to click on ships in space. 
---
Just use something like this:
---
\[Skiff, Tanky Max Yield\]
---
Mining Laser Upgrade II
---
Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
EM Ward Amplifier II
---
Medium F-S9 Regolith Compact Shield Extender
---
Strip Miner I
---
Medium Core Defense Field Extender I
---
If you really want to you can go t2 rigs and RF MSEs, but you already got \~83k EHP, more than enough to deter gankers, while still pulling max yield.
---
For small fights you can fit it with 75mm rails. The DPS isn't too impressive but it has a good range and applies very well.
---
that's hilarious if true
---
^^^
---
This is why you should just get a Molok. Its like an Avatar, without all that CPU drama! 
---
Needs that mid. Scram web hull Eris 😃
---
Oh you can do it now with 150's you just sacrifice a low and a rig slot, compared to the saber they are hideously underpowered and slow. 
---
Nice 
---
Better off using a Flycatcher for range 12.7km for rage and 15km for faction
---
Something for the d scan and probe window. They’re needed to be open 24/7 but they take up a decent amount of space.
---
Maybe like a compact version akin to planetary interaction that forgoes the scan button as they’re both binded to hotkeys.
---
Well, for reference the cynabal is a battlecruiser hull itself, if you haven't noticed how large it is compared to other cruisers. Both cruiser and battlecruiser angel ships use the same model, which is a bit weird, considering the morachas hull model has been around for a long time as another angel cruiser hull. I would love to see pirate battlecruisers and destroyers.
---
Well, there's your advantage :D
---
In other news; I wish goons wasn’t a haven for renter trash like this guy, who is obviously only a member because it’s the biggest alliance
---
I just   
---
I need more spikes.   
---
And a speed adjustment on Sansha's so Succubi wind up going approx 2300, Phants approx 1800, and the new BCs at approx 1100/1200 to keep up with speed creep.
---
I agree. Their videos tell a story every single time. I think your video is performing well because it too is a story for a specific fight. Not only did you record good footage but you told the tale of the escalation path.     
---
By the way, there is nothing wrong with house music :P It makes my videos watchable where comms are too sensitive :)
---
By faction, do you mean what Empire/Race, or do you mean the player-run alliances?
---
Role bonus: -0.05 inertial modifier

[Agile is not a noun](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html). This is where most teams that want to be agile fail.
---
me too, i use it for fleets and it is usually a "1 time job" at this point
---
they are cheap
---
Hah I get it, grr gons amirite
---
plated eris only goes about 3k hot on mwd but its slot layout lets it be a bit beefier than a heretic
---
dualprop eris is an old ahac era meme, they were disgusting in conjunction with zealot fleets
---
I don't think there should be anything done.  NS uses them as disposable tackle/grid control and dumpsters them all day, same in WH space.  Perhaps we should focus on other things than balancing niche role ships. 
---
Since the moon mining changes and the increase in t2 materials prices, dictors became too expensive to be used in anything else than bubbling.
---
Great video,  I love seeing the Logi POV.
---
Rapid exit stage left
---
No release date yet?
---
Yes all frigate hulls.
---
dictors are not niche role ships - they can lead to whole fleets of sub(or)capitals to survive or perish 
---
To add to previous answers: 
---
When you select them in the overview, there's the option to lock target in the 'selected object' pane above the main overview.
---
Or...
---
You can shift-click in the overview to lock the target immediately.
---
Depends on whether your keyboard hand is busy elsewhere or how quick you need to be etc. which'd work best.
---
Thanks!
---
I doubt it. Not that I’ve seen anyway. 
---
There's also Processor Overclocking rigs and other modules that'll boost CPU, but you lose out elsewhere. Or some Abyssal mods will have a CPU reduction above the modules you currently have if you can scan contracts, but they're more expensive and availability is random.
---
Skilling up is best option, but for immediate tweaks modules can help at a cost. Sometimes better to go Meta4 rather than Tech2 to squeeze something in, if you cannot skill higher/wait.
---
Cant wait.... My PC is in a movingbox and Im starting to get abstinence issues......

The overview. I cannot understand how CCP has spent so much money and time on attracting new players, including two totally different iterations of the NPE, one of which was pretty much the cause of them getting rid of the old Aura voice (RIP) and yet the default overview for new players is not only very badly optimised but it is ridiculously small and not explained well at all in the tutorial.
---
The overview is literally life and death in this game it needs to be well setup from the first time a player logs in and its importance needs to be emphasized.  With feature like fitting simulation CCP has shown a willingness to learn from the tools players have created for the game, I hope they do so with regards to the overview.

Ever used a combat probing dictor?

Like they already don't get dumpstered every-time they bring a fleet into Detorid...
---
Also you spelled Phoenix really weird.
---
Heavy drones. 
---
now however, being a drone boater and getting several sites in row where you start of sitting on top of anti-drone pylon and a bunch of vedmaks gets old fast. 
---
Maybe one day you might consider the heron in your report :] besides that very nice work :)
---
Ah, the classic "anyone better than me is a lifeless mouth breather, but anyone worse is a noob."
---
God these posts are awful.  Eve Online's own weak-leaks.
---
Armor dics fulfill a more niche role vOv geretics can tank like a beast and logi can keep them on grid.
---
But the common tactic nowadays requires cloaky dics with speed. If armor dics got a buff so they could match this speed while keeping its current EHP I think it would kill the sabre.
---
This is super gay and makes you a giant nerd. Please do more. I love it.

Try to join a wormhole corp in a c2 with a null static.  Good chance they will do that or if they don’t most groups respond positively to someone who will organize.

On the right, scroll down till you see "Subreddit info", you'll see an "edit" button, click that and there you go

good job, fuck chapters

I see that but which one is the one where I can type what I want in?
---
Here's a question I've had for a long time: why are brawler fits always MWD instead of AB fit in null? 
---
Double click the top of any window in Eve and tell me what happens? they minimize to a bar. Now double click the top of the scanning window and look what happens? it fucking MAXIMIZES THE WINDOW!!!AARRGGGG!

You have to considered those sites as combat sites and not exploration ones. The loot from the cans is shit.

We wish Nightblade well as he is joining an old friend in Winterco. He is a good FC and well liked by his peers he’ll be missed.  
---
Send an Evemail directly to Mittens, he loves that
---
I don't play anymore really, but back in the day we used caps and later supers to kill structures. Not that POS spam was a good mechanic though, but it gave a different use for those ships. Dreads were around for a long time before tracking dreads ever became a thing.
---
Did they get rid of POSes yet?
---
I've come to terms with the idea that calling EVE a game and approaching it as such is maddening. If you think about EVE as a pixelated, social hobby, you end up being happy that someone is getting two loaves of bread, while you yourself had to make do with scraps to get to where you are.
---
What happened too it you used to b able to do it.

Well played

He has to sort a lot of mail though so he prefers it if you resend yours every few hours or so till he responds... that way he can tell it's from an actual player.

He barely lasted a week in ISMON, what did you guys do to him there? :o

Speed is the key for tackle, and shield dictors have those nanoseconds.
---
Just cycle through goons top pvp players on zkill till you get the response you are looking for.
---
I mean Void is great and all but if you have at least 3 brain cells to rub together you can usually figure out "oh he's too far I should load Null/he's outrunning my tracking I should load CNAM".
---
Granted most people barely have 2 brain cells to rub together so YMMV.

---
OP, just wondering. The Damavik shows the yellow bar going around 75% yet states "underpowered", any reason for that? Or is it an error in the bar/the word used?
---
Otherwise, superbe guide!
---
Because you need to be able to move around quickly to force people to either come into scram range and die, or stay far away and allow you to use your MJD and bail whenever you want. 
---
That's why I hadn't mentioned it. You may have an excuse for that. No matter how insignificant, there is an excuse.
---
There is NO excuse to NOT use Large Shield Extenders and drone mods on Gila
---
&gt; I could type at length but I am very certain that history will show that skill injectors are both the worst decision CCP Games has ever made, and likely the worst development decision they will ever make. They completely shifted the meta of the entire sandbox by streamlining ISK to SP conversion and changed the way people are supposed to play the game. 
---
This is the kind of change you do to a game as it's on the way out, it's something that undermines one of the core pieces of design that the game rests on. 
---
Control + clicking them from your overview is the easiest way to lock targets 
---
why do fleets max at 256 people?

This is awesome. You should post a character name we can donate to for your efforts.

---
Is this fit meant for gamma sites?
---
Sometimes you have to be content to get content
---
I have an identical twin irl as well, I guess I have a pretty generic look
---
Makes sense. Im just saying this because Covert Research Sites are always named (Size)(Faction)Covert Research Facility and you usually dont have a few minutes (more like 90 seconds in a Lesser iirc). That said if youre fast a Lesser Covert should be no problem with 4 cans. Eve Uni says this...
---
&gt; The time is random and not shown, but it seems that the more ships are in the site at once, the longer the timer (in practice, if running a site solo, you will generally have enough time to hack and loot 2 cans before the timer expires).
---
How do you gather the data for this report? Some scraping of killboards? Do you use python?
---
Don't forget to ask "Can I ask a question?"
---
This is top notch research 👍🏼
---
Wow thanks! I feel like this is the best answer here :D
---
For comparison, the RF cap battery has the same fitting requirements as the compact battery.
---
It's just Nvidia HeatWorks™ technology, helping to keep your home warm during this winter.
---
Wait no, I'm a silly man. This is obviously meant for Firestorms. You mentioned that you're running into the timer a lot; that's down to the Firestorm effect. You're effectively chewing through a ton of HP, therefore struggling to complete rooms fast enough. My first piece of advice is to completely avoid Firestorms. You'll have a much easier time.
---
I like to run dark and electrical sites. Dark sites can only be effectively run in a sac, that I know of, since you need double webs. Some people run cerbs. As to electrical sites, I run a 1,5bil AB vaga in Tier 5s, but they can be run in zealots, sacs, ishtars, Phantasms (a personal favourite). Exotics can be ran with anything from cerbs to ishtars to silly deimos/vigilant fits, and of course with ypur usual gilas. Gamma filaments are stupid expensive so I avoid them.
---
What tiers are you going for? In my opinion tier 4 (Raging) is the sweetspot between isk and risk.
---
@reinchelien etc..
---
What is lazy about it? It is just logical. You're facing an unknown threat, you can't make a good decision. That is why it is powerful and why it is done. If you know x fleet is moving up, you can prepare and make a response. What is you're suggested response to an unknown fleet from an unknown group at an unknown time? Stop being lazy and grow a pair.. Nice, you should rewrite The Art of War.
---
If what you're saying is true, why aren't most alliances just playing through campers? Why is it they tell members to dock up and not do what they were doing? Have you logged in your rorq to fleet mine when campers were in system?  I've seen people play through it.. we all know how it works. You don't need stats of how it affected game play to know that something that costs nothing that affects someone is OP. 
---
@Astriania it is uncountable since any amount can be in that space. I don't understand how it isn't 1 person affecting every single person that is there. Can you explain? Cause, most anyone can explain leaving HS to LS scanning and looking at local, leaving LS to null doing the same with addons now, and from anywhere to wh scanning and focusing. But, we all should just ignore that one dude there that is in fact an enemy. Just grow a pair bro, reinchelien thinks you're lazy just get out there and do you're thing.. yeah buddy! (ronnie coleman voice) 
---
And, please trust that I honestly like it. Watching MOA harmed more by goons camping and doing nothing than actually having to fight fleets was beautiful. You're allowed to like an idea and recognize it is OP. I'm not the boogeyman trying to rid you of your wardecs or OP xyz stuff.  (disclosure: hated MOA, not a goon, hate goons too, but hated MOA more)
---
What a bad game this would be if it were actually balanced. Just be a 360 degree chess match. If you already thought groups are in stalemates, balance the game and then nothing happens. Not a fan. Keep wardecs, keep cloaky camping.

---
have you tried looking at the alliance description in-game?
---
In practice, wormholers primarily use the interdictor for its bubbling abilities, just like nullsec folks. If we have to move the bubbler, then we care most about speed (Sabre). If the bubbler is already cloaked up on site, then it can't shoot for a full minute after decloaking so we care most about speed again, either for decloaks or for bubbling and getting out (Sabre again).
---
Damn, this is a crazy pricy fit! Is it for exotics? I run t5 electricals in a 1,5 bil vaga, with only 3% alpha, rof and tracking implants.
---
Updated yesterday, didn't notice increased usage, but I did have a bunch of artifacting last night.  980TI.  Will have to actually look and GPU usage later.
---
People do tend to hear ares when you say eris
---
It can do all abyssals easily. I typically only do filaments that drop since the market hub in our Corp has crazily expensive filaments
---
And if they don't respond just start multiple threads here ....  Eventually one of then will say something.
---
(Seeding the cloud)
---
Swapping fittings in a t3c is labor intensive
---
The one thing I would nitpick on this is the rocket Garmur rigs; you *really* want to run a T2+T1 missile flight time rig set (with whatever else in the 3rd slot, which is not as critical), as this allows for the rockets to have a flight time of just slightly more than 2 seconds.
---
This is incredibly important because it allows you to punt Rage rockets all the way out to \~17 km, which is very useful for exploiting the long scram of the Garmur by snagging things from far outside their ability to respond, and still being able to move in/out of the fight if you need to throw down and brawl outrageous.
---
Granted I may be thinking of a more nullsec centric fit that runs dual prop rather than dual web, but even so I would actually argue that having the dual range rigs makes it much more capable of fighting more dedicated scramkite ships because you can often stay far outside their range.
---
Drone UI
---
It's true. I was just offered the CEO spot for Evictus. We should be there by next week. See you in space retards.
---
I think you're misunderstanding the point of NRDS. It's not *designed* to give CVA a combat advantage. It's a philosophy that they feel is worthwhile in spite of its combat drawbacks.
---
CHINA NUMBA ONE
---
What you expect him to actually search? wow...
---
You too? Shit. Fight me at the sun for it Valk, winner gets Evictus.
---
I guess Francis finally burned out. That's all I heard. He's not answering Discord PMs. We can do co-CEO alliance. I get holding corp.
---
This is reason #1, the most effective style of hunting (backdooring/solosky) was heavily nerfed.
---
Here is a good video covering most of the tactics we used to use. (There are one or two tactics not covered which are still viable, but take a lot more effort to use)
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=glDlo8pjlP8
---
The general switch from ratting in marauders to VNI's also certainly didn't help.
---
Most groups have changed focus to hunting things like rorqs or the occasional carrier/super which require ability to hold grid for some time and is the reason why Loki's are so popular.
---
Great work as always. I particularly like the change to splitting the rock-paper-scissors chart between whether you have positional advantage or not. As a scientist, I also appreciate that you're conscious enough of your data limitations to note when you don't have enough data.
---
My biggest quibble, I think, is with the null sec pages; specifically that you don't mention assault frigates as a potential opponent. They're irrelevant for the purposes of this document in lowsec since they can't go into novices, but that's not a factor in null, as you correctly note by mentioning the (similarly irrelevant in lowsec) presence of inties and dictors. And while it's certainly true that inties and cheap t1 tackle remain the most common frigates found in null, assault frigates have (unsurprisingly) exploded in popularity after their revamp, and at least in my experience they're not uncommon sights at all these days. Given that AFs are by far the highest combo of gank and tank in a frigate sized package (i.e. a thing that could actually threaten to catch up with other frigates), it seems weird to me to say things like 'pirate frigates can easily kill all nullsec frigates'. I would think that AFs would at least rate a mention as something you probably don't want to fight.
---
Setting up overview and brackets is some kind of dark mastery, tried to do it multiple times and still do not like results and don't know how to get what I want 
---
(And I want second overview, also)
---
Kind of both
---
you can also oversize the prop mod and pretend you're a lurch hictor.  or you can be more reasonable and use the insane fitting for combat probes.  
---
definitely underrated.
---
You can destroy someones day. 
---
Hm. In all honesty, I think you could probably do T5 exotics just fine, at least on the DPS/tank side of things. Less so on getting under the guns of bs spawns and surviving those horrid umpteen vedmak spawns, on account of  the mobility of the gila.
---
My problem with the gila is how slow it is, since I like to get as many materials as I can. I also think that the added rewards of t5 don't always justify the extra difficulty. To put it one way, if you lose a single 3 bil ship every 100 sites, you take a 30mil/site hit, aka 90mil/h less than expected. It's somewhat of a gamble unless you have a 100% safe and specialized setup.
---
You look like you got a damn nice fit going on already; all I could tell you is to look into C3-X BCS and whether there's any way you could integrate them into your fit. From there on, the biggest improvements would be adding some mutated mods to your fit. You can get some mad stats out of t2 stuff. 
---
Complexity, challenges, diversity. And space ships, uh duh.
---
Everyone uses basically some variation of the same overview linked throughout the game. Seems like this would be an easy fix
---
Oh in that previous fit the battery and the shield booster is mutated. I paid almost 2.5bil for those 2 mods only. Do u think it's a good idea so switch to high grade crystals just in case the mis grades don't work? 
---
I have never once thought about a game and then went on Reddit and asked the game community to convince me to play it. Who does that?
---
It's a gatecamp ship with some nice ranged dps.
---
Sure, we'll just have to do some imicus fleets in Francis's memory, should smooth the transition over.
---
Or don't play it, don't expect any cultist marketing here
---
Me
---
Nah, I'm from the US and logged into eve all over Europe last summer, so you should be ok.
---
Finally. All I wanted was a little acknowledgement. It's fair to assume that technology **has** improved in the last twenty years I think. Improbable io is one of two companies I've heard of in the last year that have figured out a good way to allow development on this scale
---
Pointer No.1 : This game has no factions
---
Yes please dm /u/ccp_falcon with your full itinerary
---
See you’re already understanding how to play this game
---
Do what you want, someone dares question it? Fuck them (in eves case, kill them)
---
I think you would like this game
---
For t5? I reccomend giving 5s a go on SISI, with your current set-up, then pimping your fit depending on what kills you. Far as I can tell, high-grades and a mutated propmod are your best investments. And drugs, if you don't use them already.
---
U slav u lose
---
мы не любим россиян
---
(What 3 years of russian taught me)
---
That spawn fucking sucks. I had a similar spawn in my vaga and only managed to kill it by using my drones to both chew on the fogcasters and draw off some of the aggro.
---
Post your ingame name so I can send you isk!
---
If you're looking for player alliances in nullsec, there's plenty of groups that will take brand new players. Others will mention theirs, and there's upsides to each of them, but I'll suggest Pandemic Horde. Plenty of opportunity to get straight into spaceship fleet combat. It's definitely one of the larger organizations, if that's what you're looking for. You can message me if you have any questions. 
---
Don't.  Run away while you still can.
---
Why is everyone downvoting? Username very much checks out
---
How much does pi generate per month?
---
in before someone gets triggered by "paper pushers"
---
The problem there is that its stats are going to be warped. It's going to have a huge number of losses from explorer fits, and many of its wins are going to be silly cheese fits. Even just sorting that all out is probably more time and effort than the entire rest of the guide. 
---
Number 6 here is so important.
---
A major flaw in many MANY groups is that they retain cancerous pilots who then metastasize and cause ongoing drama, drive potentially good TEAM ORIENTED pilots away, bring instability, and add a totally unnecessary weight of obligation to leadership.
---
These cancer cells also tend to be prima donas and/or ppl who give your group a black eye. I’ve even seen cancer spread through an alliance, causing it to break up and die simply because the exec was so desperate, or foolish, that they kept people around who wanted to sing a contrarian and myopic song of their own.
---
The solution is actually quite simple. Painful at first but once you and your group get used to the idea no one will bat an eye: EVERYONE IS REPLACEABLE.
---
As in no Rorq/titan/FC/industrialist”friend” is so critical that they can’t be kicked to the curb, especially if they’re being a bigger hinderance than a help. Goes for CEOs too. In many cases, dismissing a POS ceo will net you a few of their good pilots who’d rather stay with your alliance then go back into the unknown with someone they also likely see as deeply flawed.
---
It's actually more important than even that, since if it's not over 2s flight time then you'll have rockets expiring at extended scram range
---
why you buy items so far away dude
---
why don't you right click item which is on station and click buy 575 pieces of it?
---
Thiiiiiiiis!!!
---
I started doing solo Retribution’s in abyssal space and realized that it’s really, really hard to do because you have to switch ammo. I attempted to make it work, using WASD to manual pilot and focusing the mouse on changing ammo, but ultimately giving ammo hotkeys would change my entire game. 
---
Maintaining that rule for yourself, maintains it in the minds of your pilots. And although it might come across as way too harsh at first, people with sense will understand and appreciate the gardener who occasionally gets their hands dirty to pull up an overgrown weed, so the group as a whole can thrive and enjoy peace and stability.
---
We don't offer CEO roles to non-bots. This is a lie, please delete.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008348/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008348/) No kills for 2 days for the WHOLE alliance.
---
Nah, let’s just call it a down payment on ISMON’s next super theft.
---
Flycatcher is also good for using with a cyno as initial tackle.  You can fit a cyno on a sabre but it's pretty tight and you have less tank.
---
Why not just join a group that lives where those bpcs drop?
---
So 800DPS at 1.5km, 0DPS at 12km?
---
It's ISMON, you don't want to know.
---
Only slightly less, you can fit an invul instead of the second MSE
---
FC, I too drank the Kool-Aid, what do?
---
pros:
---
- it's the last MMO that PVP actually matters in. You die, you lose everything. You kill someone, they lose everything (ship + mods, sometimes pod). It makes things interesting to say the least. 
---
- Wormholes
---
- roaming with friends, even if you die, its fun. 
---
Cons:
---
-Everyone and their mother has friends with carriers, fax, supers that will cyno them in on you. The best way to make isk is to sit on a rock and mine it or kill NPC's endlessly. Wormholes have great isk income, but it's no where near as many anom spawns. 
---
- Bots are everywhere. 
---
- Everyone seems to be blue to everyone, except north vs south and renters. 
---
- For fun, you need isk, for isk, you need to either pay up or do dull activities... not to mention eve is very n+1 .. in all aspects from isk making, industry, even pvp. 
---
A lot of players still play because of zkill stroking and the fact that they've been playing for so long, they cant quit. It's like stockholm syndrome.  
---
The way to phrase this: "is there a discord for EvE Echoes mobile game?". Then everybody could have just replied: No
---
HAM Loki with webs. 
---
Shhh you say buff armor dictors. All ccp hears is nerf Sabre’s. 
---
What a lovely document. Thoroughly good work!
---
It's about 1/3rd less ehp + the Sabre can't have a scram doing that option which could be really handy.
---
Tell me how u time travel and I will shower u with isk and guides
---
&gt;I read somewhere on this subreddit people have gotten into trouble for VPN
---
Word of advice, don't believe someone who claims they were unfairly banned, from any game. 99% of the time they are lying.
---
Anyway, you should be fine as long as you don't log out in the US at 11:05 and log on in Russia one minute later.
---
Niiice that’s great to know thanks
---
…. and just think.  You don't have to deal with that NRDS shit.  The space you fighting in is actually worth a little bit of a shit.  No waiting for a minute to check a list before you can lock up and blap that bastard while he locks you up and starts firing.  And no shit lords either......
---
What's the optimal and falloff for your newsletter? Are T2 variants available?
---
Improve your skills.

the alliance management. I.E. to join an alliance you need to literally find THE alliance in the list of all player created entities.
---
Your new right?
---
call poison control hotline
---
Is ccp gonna nerf sabre by reducing cpu and adding a second to align tine tho
---
Exactly, because when I right click from the skills window and select "Buy This Type" it's too difficult for the system to buy from the current station. Yeah it's on me, too early, not enough coffee, but goddam CCP, throw us a bone!
---
It’s a shame, I won’t get to fly a no prop fleet with him again. 
---
I have always enjoyed reading your thorough work.  Thanks for putting these out and I look forward to the next one.
---
Guess this is NightBlades reddit account. 
---
Nah, just an idiot. Eve is hard when you're not paying attention.
---
As a newer player myself, coming from other RPG's, I had the same questions. Previous post sum it all up. Race doesnt matter after 2 weeks, and factions will come up while you play through. I dont want to sway your decision to join any certain Alliance or Corp, so I wont suggest any. I do have to say that Brave Newbies was a HUGE mistake, so I would stay away from there. I only say that because it turned me away from the game at first. 
---
My big pointer... Find a way to make isk by yourself. It may be in a grp or with some people but the point is you can log on, go somewhere/ do something that will reward you isk. I started with high sec incursions. There is a grp called Warp to Me that runs them day in and day out. It will teach almost everything you need to know about the basics of flying in a fleet. Its worth nothing Warp to Me isnt the only grp,  just the grp I was in that helped me out. Its not an alliance or Corp, just a binch of guys making isk. Good luck and fly safe. o7
---
dunno m8 - i heard they widot into test or something
---
I heard that chanting some magical words and lighting a cyno next to a ratting titan will make the ghost of BL appear.
---
I have been running that fit for everything except dark sites, but with site appropriate drones and missiles. Honestly, I really only want to be able to run tier 4's reliably. Tier 3 doesn't seem to be worth the time as I only seems to be coming out with &gt;10 mill. What you say about Firestorms makes a lot of sense. So that leaves Gamma, Exotic and Electrical. Is it stupid to run the same fit (minus drones and missiles) for all three of those site types? 
---
Pretty good, they killed Hard Knock's keepstar.
---
This is fucking fantastic!

There are no goons !!!

I wish you worked in my team in work. You are amazing
---
People use Sabres because they're fast.
---
 YEah they use asic miners these days 
---
Whatever people might say. BLOPSing is definitely not dead. T3 Cruisers were a very good &amp; popular hunting shipline before for blopses and with citadels and T3 rebalance, nullsec guys became safer and popular shipline lost things which made it very good at hunting.
---
I can't comment on who to apply to, but you can definitely still blops. I'd suggest perhaps either look for PVP corp/alliance in w-space that has an NS static or ask in bombers bars if they know of any. They do those a lot so might know relevant groups.

Maybe way, WAY back in the day but when I started playing in 2009 if you left the client running after DT and then tried to log in after a patch you would get an incompatible build error just like you do now and have to restart the client to run the update process.

Run the blood raider ones. Almost no one else does. Coming from someone who hoped ccp would release blood raider bpcs through the lp store like serpentis and had collected millions... they are pretty easy and no competition in npc delve
---
Beam scramkite Tormentor is lowkey OP as shit. Only thing that can really fight it on equal footing relative to its pricepoint would be a brawling neut Tristan or a web kite arty Rifter; the former obviously sucks the Torm dry while the latter tries to be relatively uncommitted to the fight by sitting \~12-15 km and just volleying the shit out of the Torm.
---
Kestrel is probably the best scramkite T1 frigate in the game though, and the Slicer and Hookbill are both incredibly good as a kiter and scramkite/brawling ship, respectively.
---
Woa, leaks

Space violence. A squad in the imperium
---
Man, you could write a full guide in this format with every ship class up to Battleships and I’d buy it 
---
That's very true; due to the way missile mechanics work and how fractional values for flight time basically turn into a percentage modifier of how often your missiles get to fly an extra second.
---
Its more like 250k SP... Just make sure you have cpu upgrades to V before you do it. Otherwise you get that skill instead of free SP

The time alphastarspilot decided to take a PH Cane fleet into lowsec to try ganking some Russian incursion runners. They docked immediately, so, having ample logi, alphastars decided to have us run the mom to see if they’d come out and fight. They didn’t, but the Cyrillic salt in local was fucking *epic*.

Never mind goons, what happened to the Taylor Swift Empire? She had a sov foothold when I left but seems to have dissapeared. Was hopeful when I returned the game would be divided between The Taylor Swift Empire in the south, at war with the Kanye West Kardashian Clan in the north.

Isn't that panfam?

I can't help but laugh at the idea of a pirate battleship flashing police colors. plz do.

What's your budget? And do you have access to a market hub, so you can easily stock up on filaments? You can definitely do that btw, but the fit would cost you quite a bit more. 
---
two bpc's make you 100 mill?  That doesn't sound right.  Make sure you're taking cost of materials into account even if you acquired those materials yourself.  There are instances where it would be better to sell materials and buy and item instead of building it yourself.

I don’t bother sifting through the post history of shitposters, but perhaps i should.
---
Or... we can stop pretending like these Skins have any kind of lore based excuse behind them at all.
---
Putting a Police Skin on your ship doesn't turn you into the police. It doesn't let you enforce the laws as Concord or the local Navy. It doesn't stop you from getting Concord'd yourself. You're just painting your ship and putting on some flashy lights. Overview still knows you're just a random space merc.
---
So how about we stop limiting which ships can have which Skins? I mean, I'd love to just have buttons that let you apply any Skin to any ship you own. But CCP is too money grubbing for that. But they *could* just sell their Skins as single-use items you apply to whatever ship you're sitting in when it's activated. Then you get the DRM for painting that ship that color from now on.
---
It would cut down on having so many different Skins on the Market. If all you had to do was buy "Police Skin" a few times and apply to the ships you want.

---
Hi
---
One thing I'm curious of is how you think the Breacher stacks up against a web kite artillery Rifter? The fit that I considered for said Rifter uses an overdrive so it's actually slightly faster (though less agile).
---
Many thanks! 
---
Just because you don’t have a use for it doesn’t mean it doesn’t have one. The heretic is actually the best combat probing dictor as despite having not that many cpu to start with it actually has the best slot layout for cpu upgrades. It performs well in its own niche which is hunting for moving caps and supers. It is also a solid option for a dictor that you expect to repair in an armor fleet since you can fit dual prop and have decent tank (and there is more to armor than retribution gangs). It’s also still a usable anti tackle ship as proven by its use in AT just not really appealing on TQ because of all the other anti tackle options you have. I would say that this is enough to justify its existence, not every dictor in the game has to be as good as the sabre provided there is something unique that they can provide. The eris stands out as being worse than everything else in pretty much every possible situation.
---
Good day sir.

Allow me to introduce myself, I am OhRevere and I am GoomSwang's top diplomat and I have led guys into battle. Men have died for me, I still remember all their names, I see their faces when I close my eyes at night, their screams still haunt me... "FC can I bring a draaaaaaaaake", "FC did we get paaaaaaaaaaaap", "FC did you say juuuuuuuuump". Terrible, tormented, screams scratching at my skull.

Probably it is a computer storage thing. 256 is a power of 2, specifically 2^8. If I had to guess, they keep some single-byte ID for members of a fleet. A byte is 8 bits, so 2 pow 8 or 256 possibilities.

256 is already a lot of people and more than enough for 99.99% of activity.

Brawler fits that are MWD fit are designed to counter kiters, which are common, and be fast themselves. The reason why kiters and fast brawlers are the main thing you see is because bubbles exist. Being inside a bubble is generally bad, and MWD lets you escape whereas (standard-sized) AB does not unless there's no danger to begin with.
---
hahaha even better. 
---
I feel like the entry level for the abyssal pvp is veeeery high and isnt something anyone can use when they are a newer player. Im assuming that your fits are all in the 2-5b range with implants.

Yeah, I idiotically just right clicked from the skills window buying T3C skills. Eve learning experience continues.
---
The main benefit of having a dictor on a lowsec roam is that it can bubble both sides of a gate.
---
Also, the main way dictors survive in larger fleets is by not getting shot. Either by bubbling and crashing gate or by bubbling and hitting the cloak button. If bubbles gave aggression, they couldn't do that anymore.
---
At least test doesn’t need supers to counter a nano player...oh wait!

why would that be a role bonus and not on the hull itself?

Dual 1080Ti's here on my EVE computer. Haven't noticed a difference in GPU usage. Hardly scientific, but I guess just as anecdotal as your test.

---
As the other dude said, share your bait neut fits :D
---
Currently 11 cynos up in Eso. You're missing your daily solo run bae
---
Ashimmus are significantly cheaper. Unfortunately there's a PVE element before it which limits fitting options.
---
An Astero, especially explo fit, is going to run those extremely poorly. In fact I don't know of a single one where you will not outright die. They're combat sites that are typically harder than the ones you don't need to scan down, and the cans are full of nothing.
---
It's because fleets used to work differently - there was a limited number of members per squad (9+leader), a squads per fleet (25) and wings per fleet. 
---
&gt;The maximum size of a fleet is 256 pilots. (1 Fleet Commander, 5 Wing Commanders, and 25 ten man squadrons which includes the squad commanders) The maximum size of a squadron is 10 members inc. squad commander, the maximum size of a wing is five squadrons, and the maximum size of a fleet is 5 wings.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Fleets_101#Purpose_of_fleets (outdated)
---
It's a good idea to keep it this way, because increasing the maximum size would just go to the advantage of massive organizations like the Imperium, and they don't need even more of a leg up. 
---
Most of them are Clown Shoes though unfortunately 
---
When I started playing there was no launcher, you just clicked on the icon and it launched a client that you logged directly into the character screen from, and that had to be restarted when patches were released. And yes they do seem to be releasing small patches at a more frequent rate.

Pls tell me you have this in video!
---
1. Yes. Actually if possible a Valk and a Vespa, with Inferno Light missiles in that case would be best because the RAH cannot adjust effectively. If you notice your damage steadily decreasing, it's probably a RAH and you should hit it with Vespas as well. But that may be hard. Honestly as long as your missiles shoot differently from your drones for an armor ship it won't be a problem.
---
2. Skills do not stack penalize. Hull bonuses do not stack penalize. Only modules excepting a few like the DCU are subject to stack penalty, and they do not penalize upon existing skill/hull bonuses.

Is eve really a zero sum game at alliance level or is the entities leading it just horse trading on egos 🧐
---
Npc/race stuff doesnt matter beyond maybe the first 2 days, tops.
---
Alliances are what you want to look at. As a general rule, you want to look into NullSec groups to start with, as they're large, well organised and will happily teach you via newbie fleets and classes, as well as give you free stuff and (relatively) safe and well-guarded space.
---
If you're looking to get rich, join Karmafleet in the Goonswarm Federation. If you want to fight in PvP, join Pandemic Horde Inc. in Pandemic Horde.
---
You can do both in both alliances, but they do specialise to an extent in how I describe them.
---
Alternatively, join a Wormhole corp and play EVE on hardcore mode :p
---
Amusing, though I'd say 50/50 the Brave phoenix pilot had a test alt.  good chance they just going for the theft.
---
I could 100% get behind a "bad cop" SKIN :) Maybe slightly darker
---
As is tradition 
---
If you inject, seriously limit yourself on the max amount you will buy. Also please consider, rather than injecting a ship or module you may be quickly bored of, to go for [core support skills](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14). They're boring, not flashy unlocks, etc. and you probably won't think about it afterwards but trust me that these skills are a *huge* playability and quality of life foundation. They make a world of difference in every single ship you will ever ride again in EVE. Particularly powergrid management V and cpu management V which lets you equip ships well and talk the language of fitting with other players. Please, *please* consider grabbing and fast-forwarding through at least basic levels of these skills.
---
If you last any length of time in this game, you will one day look back and be very happy you have done so.

Well I've spent up to 1.7B with ship, fit and pod but lost it that day so I went to the sub 600m fits until I figured things out more. I am not opposed to spending that much again but only if i really felt I wasn't going to pop as often as I do. I have access to filaments so that isn't an issue.

I liked flying with "Nightbl4de" (probably works in IT with that spelling).  He was a but crazy and fun, but he's obviously not quite all there.  Of all places to go, why would he chose to go to the enemy of all the people he's been flying with, giving ships to and supporting?  If it was taht he just had a fight with someone in charge, he could of gone to a lot of other places, but he didn't.

A small error and some possible improvements:
---
\- An Excavator Drone has a base yield of 100m³ per 60 seconds, not per 1 second. So it's yield should end up being \~45m³ per drone
---
\- It would probably be helpful to add another column stating the yield with 5 active drones
---
\- Likewise the yield numbers for Barges / Exhumers should be doubled to correctly display the yield per ship, not per mining laser
---
That way you get some sense of comparability between the numbers.

Jaguar is a strong independent ship.
---
How are you fitting combat probes? The Eris has the worst CPU out of all the dictors, and you need over 200 CPU for combat probes, plus another 100 for the bubble launcher.
---
Unless you're running multiple coprocs in the lows?
---
As someone who's flown highsec incursions, even this level of reasoning is pretty laughable, dude. You can use any ship you want for taking part in incursion realistically, those are simply the community meta and there's no reason CCP should bend to that.
---
However the police skin is sexy. Please give it to more hulls, for the reason that it is simply a good skin. Adding it to CONCORD LP store for an extraordinarily high price would be nice too.
---
wait, you thought I was talking about Gobbins? Why would you think that? He's none of those things.

&gt;Hi.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I am relatively new to eve (played first in april 2019, then went afk until about 10 days ago. \~8 million SP). I tried joining a big null alliance, but it got a little too monotous for my liking.  
---
&gt;I figured I should train into T3C's so I can semi-safely do PvE etc in low/null. I have gallente cruiser at 5, however unfortunately from reading it seems like the Proteus is rather garbage.  
---
&gt;As a general purpose T3C, should I train for the Loki or the Tengu? Missile/Projectile skills are both bad and racial cruiser skill for both is at 3, so training time wise it does not matter.
---
I'm originally a Gallente player from wayyyyyyyyy back when. And I have to chime in on this, go with Loki. Sorry but that is the bottom line of it. CCP unfortunately gutted Proteus and buffed the Loki at the same time. Proteus is a pretty horrible ship now except some extremely low situational applications. It is bad for PvE because its main DPS comes from blasters or drones, however, unlike otehr drone ships it can field only 4 instead of 5 heavies, so it ultra sucks big dick with the drone sub system and the blaster sub system is just as sucky for it cause of its super short range on blasters + high capacitor use at the same time which cuts into your armor reps (thus tank).
---
For PvP its a little better cause cloak + null, and blasters are ok if / when you can jump someone from close range.
---
I highly recommend you train for a Vexor Navy Issue, do not train light drones to level 5, only lvl 3 cause medium drones kill small targets jsut as good as ligth drones do, and do not train sentries for now. Just train into medium and heavy drones. Once you get mediums to 5 and can specialize, switch training to Gila, so that will add shield, missle and caldari cruiser 5. After that go for Loki. Loki has both armor and shield fits, both are very good, and from Gila training you should have all the missle support skills done, just switch it up to Heavy Assault Missiles, and the sub systems and you'll be set. Also, you will end up with Gallente, Caldari and Min cruisers at 5, which will open up a whole bunch of really nice faction ships for you to use in addition to what has been said.

Pretty sure this is /u/concernedeve (Evertrader, the CEO of LORDE) on a different account, considering the following:
---
* This account was created days after I posted that /u/concernedeve is Evertrader
---
* This post has Evertrader's characteristic run-on sentences with little punctuation
---
* Evictus. hate boner (LORDE hates Evictus)
---
* Winter Coalition dick sucking (LORDE is in Winter Coalition)
---
Downvote and move on, so better posts can take this one's place.

According to their in game alliance census...it would need to be 500 alts
---
I'm in IM and we're basically Initiative. and Initiative is basically Goonswarm, so send me a 100m ISK diplomacy fee and I'll see you to someone higher up.
---
Sure you can probe with it, if you're cool using up all your armor tank to fit enough CPU to actually function. You can also just have a dic squad with a dedicated prober punting sabres onto targets and accomplish the same thing. Maybe for some solo activities you could use it if you can't dual box, but even in that incredibly specific niche I don't think it's really all that good.
---
Never change TEST.
---
Lol wtf omg
---
Neither do I, but let's turn it into a nice adventure - then you can blow up my assfrig.
---
I already have good VNI skills.
---
However ratting in high sec sucks, so it's either joining another newb friendly null sec blob, or getting into cloaky stuff, be it exploration or PvE.
---
I asked about filament access because it's way easier to make a good fit for just 1 type of filament rather than a generalist. My personal favourites are the Vagabond for electrical sites and the Sacrilege for Dark ones. In general, I'd suggest that you stick with HACs. They're cheap, they have lots of fitting space and tons of cap, they are fast, and finally, they have Assault Damage Controls.
---
I'm far away from my home pc and my fit library, and I don't know your skills. If you have pyfa and you feel like tinkering, here's some pointers:
---
1) you need 600 dps. More is better, but not at the cost of application This will enable you to burn through the triple battleship spawn sites. 
---
2) you need 600-ish DPS tank. The slower you are, the more tank you need. You can get away with as little as 500 if you are fast and you burn the right targets off the field. The ADC is your panic button: pop it while you burn the first vedmak, or while you're closing in on a battleship spawn. At 700-800 dps tank, you are practically 100% safe in tier 4.
---
3) you need to be able to go at least 600 cold and 1000-ish hot. I run AB fits, but a MWD HAC gets a substantial sig reduction bonus and is way smaller than a Gila while burning in. 
---
4) You NEED to be capstable at around 50% and have a cap warfare resistance of at least 25%. For this, you need to have a RF or Thukker cap battery. This will enable you to outright ignore most neuts.
---
6) You need to apply at least 25km away. This means that you can kill stuff ASAP. 
---
7) Exile and Blue Pill drugs will make you tank like a mofo. DB7 is extra DPS. 3% implants are piss-cheap and very much worth it
---
One of the lower tabs in Pyfa enables you to show the effect of abyssal weathers on your fit.
---
About the sites: 
---
1) NEVER let drone battlecruisers get on top of you. They WILL kill you. They also have frigate tracking so thwy will murder drones. Kiting them at 10 neuters them. Their names include  "grip", eg "Blastgrip Tessella"
---
2) 3xVedmak spawns are deadly. Burn a Vedmak, fast, then relax. 
---
3) "Ghosting" and "Confuser" rats are priority, especially frigs. They ruin your application and make it tough to break anything. Kill 2 or 3 and you will be fine. This is unimportant to drone boats, however.
---
4) "Renewing" Leshaks are more dangerous than "Starving" ones. For every second they stay alive, you have to burn through more hp. The same is true about Vedmaks, but you can't get under Vedmak guns, so kill anything you can to get dps off the grid
---
5) "Plateforger", "Fieldweaver" and "Preserver" rats are logi and can make it really difficult to break anything, especially with a few "Ghosting" rats on field. Priority targets.
---
6) "Anchoring",  "Spearfisher" and "Nullwarp" rats scram and are deadly to MWD fits but innocuous to AB fits. Priority if running MWD.
---
7) "Snarecaster", "Tangling", "Entangler", "Entanglement" "Upholder" and "Warden" rats web and are dangerous to either. Priority.
---
8) Don't attempt to get all the material cans in the site. My rule of thumb is to go for the closest one, then straight to the bioadaptive cache, and out, but I run AB fits. 
---
9) 5 minutes per room, tops. Easy frigate wave and you're only 3 minutes into the site? Don't tarry.
---
10) Carry paste and overheat when needed
---
11) putting out drones can make the rats switch aggro off you. Very useful when facing a ton of weapon disruption
---
12) neuts become much less worrisome if you have enough cap and DPS. Neuting rats are "Firewatcher", "Sentinel", "Nullcharge", "Starving". "Starving" Vedmaks and Damaviks have no RR so I find them easy.
---
13) the Tyrannos is a road runner and a pain in the ass if you're slow. Much less of an issue to drone boats
---
14) drone battleships have insane alpha. Maintain transversal at all times. They also have insane EHP. Don't waste time. The "Benthic" drone battleship has a 15km web. Orbit at 20.
---
15) clouds and pylons are your friends. Automata Suppressor pylons are gread for defanging "Vila" Damaviks and Vedmaks and reducing dps pressure
---
16) Damaviks have cruiser sig, so high damage ammo works well on them
---
Right, that's it. My index is aching :P
---
Send me a link to your killboard (if you don't mind, of course) I'll take a look at your Ishtar losses and get back to you in a couple days, once I'm back from holidays and I can look through my fittings library.
---
Nice bro. Nice
---
this makes perfect sense, we put our own assets on the line for kills, while losing shitloads of isk
---
pack it up guys we have been outed
---
this link is better: https://zkillboard.com/group/513/losses/highsec/
---
Friendly reminder: one simple 10mil payment can save your freighter.
---
I use a VPN all the time with EvE and have had no problems. My IP will change all over the place and they don't mind at all. Nobody has ever been banned for using a VPN there's always another reason
---
Dead Alliance M8 not coalition
---
The most popular Abyss ships are the Gila and the Sacrilege. Drones and missiles are pretty much the way to go.
---
Well.... Yes? I did it once during burn jita, scored the final blow on the freighter too, then my wallet popped with 1bil. 
---
The only sorrow I've experienced is reading this post. 
---
If your alliance doesn't sell shirts and flags you're missing out.
---
We had a week old guy joining our corp. Few hours after he joined we dragged him into [a huge battle](https://crossingzebras.com/lonetrek-capital-massacare-in-nalvula/) in his Merlin. He successfully killed a blue cormorant (dawwwww &lt;3 ) and was absolutely thrilled by the amount of capitals he's seen and whatnot. Needless to say, he stayed and played with us.
---
Well, it was good while it lasted.  
---
  
---
back to afk VNI spinning, I guess...
---
Much appreciated. :)
---
That was my favorite part of the clip!
---
"No bubbles? Guess they just didn't bring bubbles" HMMMMMMMM
---
Well the model is technically viable. By ganking people freighting your assets you would get the collateral, the loot, and the green kb. Not saying whether this is happening or not, but it's not a nonsensical model.
---
Just in case you wanted to look like a gigantic tool shed.
---
It appears as though your alliance has misinterpreted, as they sell shit to fags. 
---
“anything involving Goons leads to sorrow and loss.‘.   
---
That is slanderous defamation of the good character of Goons. Fetch Scooter and convene a public trial, have this stain on Goon reputation substantiated or struck from public record.
---
Same, I have experienced nothing but good friends, fellowship, the occasional feast of tear-marinated unicorn steaks. Oh and lots of ochre.
---
i had to use vpn for a while for playing eve, and i just have submitted a support ticket asking the same question. basically the support guy told me it's fine, but they can mark my accounts as the ones that can be used via vpn, just in case. i have no idea whether they do that for real, but you can maybe try that anyway if you worry about any issues.
---
Fuck, I'd love to see that. Even just the raw footage should be preserved, to show people what a good night in EVE can be like.
---
fair point, however if we were doing this we would obviously be using neutral alts so there would be no 'saying no to goons'
---
CRUZADOS is recruiting, evemail "ghosttr" ingame, we are a PVE/PVP group, a member of GSF, we have amazing fights and the best space in the game hands-down for moneymaking. Please PM me on reddit if you need to have any additional information!
---
wat.  their EZ farm doesn't come of of reinforcement for another 3 months at least lmao.
---
Dark sites have penalties to turret range, which also applies to drone turret ranges. That can cause a huge problem for Gilas. So if you're flying a drone boat like that, avoid those.
---
Passive Gilas do great in Gamma sites. The shield HP bonus there boosts your tank significantly. Just got to watch out for the Explosive resist hole it creates. Triglavian weapons deal a lot of Explosive damage, so don't let that get too low.
---
Good point. The first thing i can think of is to reduce the zkill database query to pull only kills in FW systems. unfortunately zkill only tells you the closest static celestial on the mail or else it would have been piece of cake to only pull kills from FW complexes.
---
You're still special to me Chevis

Op had one too many vaccinations.

Check out Whiteout Initiative. Great for new bros and veterans. Small gang wormhole pvp.

wow when did that happen, i haven't seen anyone talk about that, must have been an amazing brawl

I like the subtlety of this comment.
