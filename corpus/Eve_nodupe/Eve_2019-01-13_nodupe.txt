please do it

&gt;Not a sov null guy myself, but AFAIK the big fleet doctrines right now are Feroxes, Machs, and then capital/supercapital shit.
---
I really don't feel like I see machs that much anymore. Slot nerf and the inherent weakness of armor tank in blob fights killed them off. From my perspective of subcaps in order of ship size it's shield boosh bombers, retris, jackdaws, moas, eagles, ishtars, muninns, ferox, then megas/apocs+bhaal. There's some specialized comps like ravens to kill citadels but a lot of comps have become really standardized.

I corrected myself as you can see

No issues for me, win7 user btw.
---
Yeah, like Olmeca said there's nothing wrong with being able to make isk. In fact it's really good, as long as you have a reason for doing it. It doesn't need to be as elaborate as his (but hey, reach for that rainbow!), but it needs to provide meaning if you're going to move out of "wallet incrementer online".
---
Find a character you can free up for all-round pvp skill training. If that means making sacrifices in terms of your krab setup (e.g. maybe 2 rorqs instead of 3), accept that. Pick a short-term pvp goal (this will depend on what group you're in to an extent), maybe throw some sp at that if you can, but at any rate get into it quickly. You can think about long-term goals after that, but get out of your old comfy zone as soon as possible. The spod isn't going anywhere.
---
Try and put yourself in a position where you are regularly flying with people who want to do the same thing you do, and are already good at it. Make sure you're having fun, and go from there. 
---
I’d be flying the PvP prospect that took me out on many MANY roams. Hoping to get my very first kill in it. 
---
I will head to UVHO where I had my first pvp experiences and learnt to rat.  This was with Horde when they resided in Querious.  I left a Tristan in the station when we left to take Fade and when I see it near the bottom of my asset list, I smile.
---
There was a previous Perimeter keepstar? 
---
All those stories about TEST deploying the first highsec keepstar must have been fake news. 
---
But if I mine it myself, the ore is free.
---
relaxing af tho.
---
i fucking love watching vni's popping. something about it is so calming

I will just head to the Eve Gate and approach it till the end, eternally hopeful!

I used Lutris to install EVE Online in Mint which worked flawlessly for me. The Lutris website has 3 different install methods; one of them should work for you. I went with the Wine implementation (Option 2) and it's worked well.

10mn 75mm rail hull algos, 2web honorpoint beam coercer, 400mm plate full neut dragoon, sebo arty thrasher,  all good choices znd many more. When checking zkill, search by the specific destroyer and look for it to be in lowsec. Or just check black rise (region) killboard. Last i checked that was one of fw hotspots. I might be wrong because "lolsec ded".

Build a separate account from the liquid isk you get to pvp in
---
Same with not orbiting the can, and staying more than 2km from it in case you need to quickly cloak because something near you decloaked. Gives you a lot of time to align out if it's not a sabre, but you should've seen that one on dscan ;D
---
That was FEDUP command thinking about all the taxes they're about to rake in.
---
Would have to be Egghelende, where my solo PVP experience really picked up and where it would have to finish, surrounded with the pilots I flew with in small gang over the years (Arthaban, Ashen, Mav, Ulic, RTS, Radzak...)
---
dics repeatedly bubbling @0 on smartbombing dreads literally hurts....
---
With Machs it was more that insofar as I am aware- not being up-to-date on the sov null fleet meta (which is interesting to me seeing how it evolves)- that arty/alpha based Maelstrom fleets had been replaced by Mach due to the pre-nerf slot layout giving them capless tank vs Citadel Void bombs and having both good volley and decent DPS (and also not having glacial cycle times on their artillery due to the out-of-the-box RoF bonus, and good projection with the falloff bonus).
---
That being said I think that battleships are largely being pressured out of the PvP meta because battlecruisers are cheaper and less vulnerable to bombers- while also being modestly more mobile at the operational level (granted I'm assuming that at the strategic level you can make anything mobile with Titan bridges), and easier to skill into.
---
And then also from above by capital ships being much less vulnerable to some of the things that wreck battleship fleets (like bombing runs), on top of which capitals tend to have decent application on battleship-sized targets with relatively minimal- or in some cases even no- support.
---
&gt; From my perspective of subcaps 
---
Given that you seem to know much more about the subject than I do, can you elaborate on it further? Like I mentioned the sov null fleet meta is something I find interesting even if I largely don't want to interact with it.
---
Also extracting my industry and reprocessing skills.
---
Really ? I'm doing the new tutorial right now and seems like I received skills for free already. Maybe I can keep going and it will combine both and be even better than starting a new character ? 
---
I never did the actual tutorial it was an older version of it. 
---
I don't think so
---
Do what?

I was thinking about joining the brave newbies. How risky it is to move out everything to there base ( after following your selling list ) ?

Better just leave it where ?

Yeah now you get ~370k skillpoints when you start a character. Its not that much more, maybe a days worth of training but you would get more than you have now.  I'm not talking about skillbooks either, incase you were confusing the two.

Thank you for the self affirmation.

Lol when everyone said that data sites don’t have as much isk. They weren’t wrong!!!

Just get comfortable losing isk. Simulate a t1 cruiser hull you like, get some pvp advice from experienced players, get used to dying and be creative with your fits after you get experience. Everyday I take breaks from ratting to well a couple praxis solo and take part in fleets. I go out with the intent of dying so I'm not playing cat and mouse to keep my assets safe by avoiding good fights
---
Welp* not well
---
The prices have to do with the rigs that are manufactured from the materials. Intact armor plates (best sansha relic loot) are used to produce trimark armor pump IIs. Enhanced ward consoles (best gurista relic loot) are used to make core defenced field extender IIs. 
---
These are both universally popular rig types and in constant demand.

They're seeing retention BECAUSE THEY REMOVED THE ABILITY TO NOT USE IT! 
---
CCP removed the ability to warp to escalations outside of the Agency, so of fucking course people are going to use the Agency.

This is the same fucking thing they did with the map. Forced people to use the new one without telling them they could go back to the old one, and then they said "Hey, people are using the new map!"

What did those poor dinos ever do to you?  
---
I'm not sure leshaks being cheaper would change much unless null groups autisticly farm abyssal which I don't see happening.
---
I think dreads being more expensive would be healthier for the game. Most dreads atleast flown in null are cheaper then most subcaps I fly these days combine that with the amazing insurance you can get its absurdly cheap to use one almost why use a subcap?
---
I think dreads are where they are at not because of simply the price though it's a range of issues.
---
I wanted to point out here, to anyone who sees this, the importance of what Olmeca said. So he pointed out two fights from his favorite proteus that I bet you he could give you one hell of a story about, even today. This is literally what Eve is about! 
---
People spend too much time making money and sitting on piles of ISK, but why? From the Eve players I’ve met in real life, Eve events, and on comms, people talk about the fun stuff and reminisce over incredible fights and content. You don’t sit there laughing and recounting exciting stories of your drones going back and forth between your Rorq and an asteroid. 
---
Have fun, enjoy the game, and make sure what you’re doing is fun.

Back when I had only been playing for a year or so, our corp decided to get back into wh's. While we didn't really live out of it for very long, it was my first attempt at wh space. J154541. C4 no effect with a c4-c5 stat. Scanning your way to j space was always a bitch. 
---
We left after a month or two being that the wh itself wasn't very good, but a guy in corp had left an alt in there. I asked him about it a few months later and he said "my guy is still in there with a cloaky tengu, just drifting, waiting...". I like to have that mindset when I think of this. Just cloaked up, drifting off into space like George Clooney did in Gravity. 
---
is it also the only test

This makes too much sense and actually sounds useful. CCP will never do this.

I love you a little bit

---
That number is 5% of the volume that moves each day, probably as a 5 day rolling average. It’s a rule of thumb for how much you could reasonably expect to sell per day without affecting the prices or spending all day 0.01 isking.
---
Overall, yes. This contributes to the feeling among the player base that dreads are "disposable"... as long as you lose it within the designated insurance time, which only tends to happen when you are in a bigger alliance. This is usually combined in larger alliances with a ship replacement program that will compensate the player for the loss of the ship on top of the insurance value. In a few cases, the combination of insurance and SRP can exceed the ISK initially spent on the ship.
---
It is (very unintentionally) one of the many mechanics that drives players to larger alliances over smaller ones.
---
Use Lutris and just install it with the most recent non-steam version (there are only 3 options so it will be pretty obvious) . So far thats been my most reliable way of launching the game and Ive had 0 issues. 
---
We need places to hang our ships on
---
Seriously, look into Lutris. The install scripts are selected via bullet menu and thats it. Super easy to use. Its like a free games only Steam client for Linux. The final form of PlayOnLinux. 
---
I’d recommend you get used to manually piloting ur ship and finding people to roam with, primarily.
---
Either the Loki or Muninn are outstandingly strong smallgang ships (very fast, good range, good damage) but since they’re arty based there’s SOME degree of mechanical skill required to hit shots if your enemy isn’t just approaching you while you burn in a straight line. 
---
I’d suggest just practicing range control in easier ships (omen navy issue or osprey navy issue) where minor errors are more forgiving (lower price tag, faster cycle time) in gangs and then using either the Loki or muninn. The Loki has a bonused web but is slower and has no ADC and the muninn is the reverse. 
---
\o/ dreadnought is gone \o/
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I do a lot of coding and I'd rather cut off my hands than lose access to the terminal. Also, installing stuff on windows is really roundabout by comparison, and I like having a selection of desktop environments available whenever I want to keep things fresh instead of windows and its "you can change the wallpaper or move the icons around" approach. 
---
All in all I personally like linux better for the convenience of the computer always doing exactly what its told and usually more efficiently, even if that means I have to occasionally fiddle around to get my games working. (less and less recently thanks to Steam Proton) 
---
help this is being vote brigaded

---
If you join a null sec alliance then you'll end up with shit everywhere. You'll go on a deployment to a region you don't remember ever being in and discover you have three ships in the station that you can't undock because the module layout has changed since you were last there.

Yay! Local is dumb anyhow

Nice b8, honestly nothing is too bugged it’s just a bunch of minor stuff everyone is bitching about. Keep in mind CCP isn’t that large and they are being dragged in a bunch of directions, between making new content, fixing old, and keeping the game itself running.

Just warped somewhere, got a blackscreen, shields go down, wtf.jpg , local is dead so cant even chat to my killers, try to warp (this is an instaceptor), nothing happening, no messages for scrams or points, armors goes down, hull goes down, pod dies, wake up in home station

What do you expect from an early access game?

it's not just local, it looks like the entire chat system is completely buggered. No channels loading for anyone.

All channels I'm in are fucked. Either not updating or are like 30-45min behind.

Yep I just noticed this myself.  I've come back to game after a few years and had to do some Googling and apparently this is just tip of the iceberg of game breaking issues.  
---
So is this the same for everyone at the same time?
---
I'd petition that if i were you, even better if you have it on a capture.
---
None of the chats are working, it's not about seeing who's in local.
---
Standing loss if you reject too many too soon

Had an odd issue last night. I undocked from a keepstar in my Nyx, went to black screen to load the outside view but nothing happened. I sat there for a solid 2 min before I force closed it and relogged. Selected character and it goes to black screen for about 2 min. When it finally loaded I was in warp to the keepstar in my Nyx (because when I HAD to log off it warped off).   
---
I don't want to leave eve, I really don't, but I don't know how much more I'll be willing to put up with. Right now it is slightly annoying. If it gets worse then it'll eventually become unplayable. 
---
the ENTIRE chat system just crashed. For basically everyone. That's not "minor stuff"
---
It'd be nice if you could hover over weapons, hull etc and get an overlay readout of the stuff from the fitting window
---
It's a day ending in y, thus chat is fucked up. 
---
Abyssal PVP? At least I believe it was intended to be exactly that

I dont really care about an Interceptor, it's the fact that this happens atleast 1 time per evening.

I think they've said they're giving it until the end of the month and if it's still broken they're going to revert, although reverting will take some time.
---
This is not about local alone though.
---
I'm all for removing local but can we keep fleet chat plz. thx
---
Everything is working as planned. Down with the bots =)

Same

Not just local. Other chats and chat listings as well.

Damn, first time actually wanting to undock in eve from a 2 year hiatus and its fucked. GJ CCP, I see nothing has changed since my absence.

I'll play conspiracy guy. CCP has shifted away from scams. Expired accelerators now listed as epired, now placed in their own sub on the market. How to fix Jita scamming, get rid of Jita local.

1 mission can be declined without loss of standing every 4hrs i think

Can't complain about chat if no one can chat :)
---
Yes, but it appears the type of problem is different. 
---
Yeah it was something like that. But they might as well start reverting it now, we all know the corporate dudes don't want them to work on fixing the chat as it won't earn them more $$$.
---
help that post is too ^
---
You can still undock and play.
---
30min after leaving fleet I‘m still in fleet chat and receive messages from an hour ago. But i csn local chat with people in Curse despite being in Perimeter.

I tried to communicate with a fleet member using the reason box for sending ISK.

---
Less of an opinion and more of *the reason the game fucking exists*
---
It's literally the entire premise of a sandbox game.
---
The problem is that null markets generally don't move things very  fast, and you also risk people getting EXTRA pissy if you encroach on their niche product. Jita absolutely eclipses even Delve markets, so you are guaranteed a sell quickly for most items. The volumes moved are amazing. Amarr is the second decent hub, good to learn trading in, as it moves slower and doesn't have 50% trading bot population that always +0.01 ISKs you.
---
There are two disadvantages to High Sec though. As you mentioned, null has better manufacturing efficiency and lower installation costs, so any null manufacturer will always beat your margin no matter how hard you try. The second is that some manufacturers in High Sec actually think the minerals they mine are 'free', and then sell below production cost to move their product quickly. So you can't match those guys in sell cost if you are buying materials yourself. From what I've seen null producers don't compete in these markets very much, as it is a pain to move product in from nullsec. Nullsec from my experience only exports T2 items and very well researched blueprints, or low volume goods.
---
As others have said, most T1 ammo will move decently fast, but the market cap is pretty low, so you will not be rolling in cash even if you take the entire market. T1 ships are competitive and lower margin, because a lot of people have old M10 BPOs sitting around. T2 can be worth making if you figure it out, but takes huge amounts of capital to get the setup going.
---
people like to collect and trade corpses, with high-profile celebrity players yielding high demand and value.  think of them like baseball cards.  each corpse is uniquely named after the player's character and along with it comes notoriety, legacy and conversation value.  imagine if that player no longer plays  eve anymore, or is a notorious wizard hat wearing icon who barely logs in, or is an AT champion who rarely dies in-game.. ive seen people with collections you'd be surprised by, and people demanding billions for select players corpses.  but ultimately, the corpse has zero actual in-game value to enhance your gameplay.

I hope this is happening on Amarr undock and EFYRR has many spare T3s.
---
That sucks.
---
So isn't this related to what looks like the tear long issues with chat?
---
Is this stuff intermittent?  How quickly for it to resolve?

Sitting in a rifter, docked, somewhere in Cobalt Edge, because that’s where my soul died long ago.

well at least you used the right flair to make that comment
---
I'm looking forward to this update and hope it leads to them reworking the whole mission system with something more engaging and stimulating. New Eden has many stories to tell and it feels untapped to do it in plane spreadsheet simulator fashion.

this is hella fucked

You should defenetly join an corporation with some people that know what they do. There you get help with Fitting you ships. What are your main interests?

But wow man, everyone has their fucking blue donut and ALL I EVER HEAR from ppl complaining against WANGS is we have that ONE blue, SNUFF. Which arent even in the sime timezone as we are. So whens the last time you saw more than 3 snuff pilots in a USTZ WANGS fleet? link me a br, make my day.
---
Maybe the new Triglavian Ships? They got an enormous Dmg output. Also the Abyssal Sites are quit fun. Did you fly an carrier already? There are so much things to do, just try new things! 
---
**JOIN A PVP CORPORATION**. 
---
Above all else, you're not likely going to really start to understand and enjoy PvP unless you associate with a group that also PvPs. The easiest way to find a group like that is join a group that exclusively PvPs - no PvE on mains at all. There are a pretty good amount of groups out there that do this but they aren't very popular these days because roaming and lowsec are fairly hit or miss in terms of potential content. 
---
You don't necessarily *have* to do it this way either. Learning how the map works and simply flying over to active areas with ships to fight in works too. Joining PvP in game channels can do it for you sometimes. You just have to go do the thing that you're afraid of until you figure out if you like it or not. 
---
Wonder if concord still works when local is borked......
---
I'd rather they actually fix it and go forwards instead of backwards.
---
They just need to dedicate the devs and the time to it.
---
Maybe they shouldn't have fired half their dev team.
---
Refuse batphone calls, split off into multiple corps, take fights elsewhere. Punch up instead of down.
---
The better alternative would be for the various lowsec entities to band together to fight Snuff, but all those entities are dead now or have moved out of lowsec.
---
People aren't as dedicated as they used to be.
---
The thing is that frequently- at least for myself- duel mechanics get used for two things:
---
I am bored and want to shoot someone *now* without getting blobbed by 900 people, so I duel someone; frequently this is one of 2-4 people that I regularly do this with.
---
OR
---
For some of those people, I basically just want to break their spacetoys because I'm a raging dickbag like that. So I see if they'll duel me.
---
That being said I'm not above trying to stack the deck as much as possible in my favor in the form of drugs and attempting to optimize a fit as much as I possibly can for a given purpose- like, for example,
---
Related addendum: web kite arty Rifter is *fucking ridiculous*. It's hilarious (buffer fits will take *forever* to die, but you volley the shit out of active fits). Great way to style on AB brawler fits, just beware MWD antikite setups.

Then no would use it at it would take time and feel like a tacked on thing to the game.

Are you looking for Nullsec or FW. Destroyers generally do a lot better in lowsec FW because of the gated plex mechanics stop cruisers getting in, and they generally are slower and about as agile as most solo PVP T1 cruisers so normally it's better to roam null with a cruiser instead, as they have about the same survivability when burning back to a gate and a Cruiser has a wider pool of targets and engagements it can take, plus with Insurance it's often only +5-10m or so extra... The main advantage to using them in Null is they are generally considered bad and people will suicide T2 frigs like Assault Frigates and Interceptors into you if you know what you're doing.   
---
Otherwise, some popular fits for various Destroyers in FW;  
---
Coercer - Usually with Beams + Dual web, or MWD/Point Pulse.   
---
Corax - Scram+Web/Invul+MSE with rockets can outbrawl a lot of things.  
---
Thrasher - Lots of good fits, ACs+400 plate, or MSE+Neut, can also do 250s + 10mn AB with dual webs for surprise sex on people.   
---
Dragoon - scram/web+injector and neuts with a 400 plate, can also be dual rep instead.   
---
Algos - 10mn AB, disruptor, web, with hull rigs and a small anc, DC, DDA. plus rails. Really slippery and tanky  
---
Cormorant - Blasters with mse/scram/web has good tank and spank plus the range bonus gives you options with Null.   
---
Catalyst - MWD+Web and Max gank with hull tank. 
---
One thing that always helped me was to remember how many people have such a vastly retarded amount of isk it makes my accumulation pointless. There's people with 14-digit wallets out there. Unless you're playing for that absolute #1 spot, playing an isk-only game is a waste of time and a losing battle. You gotta krab with a PvP goal in mind. 
---
So you admit you are part of the problem but don't like others that contribute to the same problem?
---
This is a very SMART and STABLE game
---
If you HAVE to rely on local to play, you need work. 
---
If they just removed his isk and didn't ban him then he was obviously justly punished by CCPs standards. He most likely was innocent, but CCP took away all the dirty isk. 
---
Underrated
---
If they perma docked their entire super fleet they'd be able to get a lot more content. But asking people to deliberately hamstring themselves for the sake of content has never worked out in the past, *especially* with relation to supers, so I wouldn't count on it. 
---
Are u okay dude?
---
Are you online right now? It's literally fucked for everyone.
---
Wow, the guy's got moves for sure
---
And they should contribute the fixes upstream to encourage a reliable and open jabber ecosystem
---
ISK matters. If it does not matter at all, losing ships become meaningless and Eve PvP become PvP of any other MMO games.  Think of losing a game in league of legends vs losing your bling fit ship in Eve combat. Very different experience isn't ? 
---
Stay Frosty generally recommend our new joiner to have an ISK source. Even continuously losing ISK10 million t1 frigs will hurt eventually if u don't have any income. 
---
I recommend you gradually train one of your 3 character slots into frigate PvP. It does not take much time. This way you still can generate some isk. Also as what everyone said, join a PvP focus Corp. Not some highsec Corp that claims do mining, nullsec, PvP and everything
---
Are there still space oddity anoms?
---
Why you no rorq mine goons?
---
What IS Local?
---
same, just watching zkill for vni kills is hilarious
---
Since snuff left goons they've added Adversity, Elitist Ops and Maverick Navy which is understandable since they didn't really have a USTZ. The problem is those groups bleed over to other time zones as well. All snuff is going to get in low-sec now is dunks here and there. Nobody can take a decent brawl against them, especially if they're in range of snuff supers. The good news is that most of the people they are adding are just content whores. As soon as Tau and Hy go inactive they will move on to the next ticker tank.

It's where I REALLY started playing Eve.  Joined a random corp from the adverts.  Developed some great friendships.  Suffered a massively devastation of corp theft, left me with almost nothing.  Learned some pvp, small (very small) gang FC, my love of industry.  The "joy" of being a director...  In 5 years, that C2 was probably my most enjoyable 18 months of play.
---
I want to see drones cleaning/welding the hull, little gangways for the crew, stuff like that. Also scissor trucks delivering shitty prepackaged meals.
---
One thing I learned from eve being funky over the years is to just log off. I just find it a coincidence that it happens when I decided to give this shit game another go. 
---
Hey CCP, local is STILL FUCKED FROM MARCH  
---
PS, thanks for making ECM ships completely fucking useless and giving Goons 2000 titans
---
Love, Torin
---
point and proof. Delete local. 
---
1) CCP announces structure and moon changes.    
---
2) Mainline Lowsec FC's say why it's gonna be bad.    
---
3) Everyone tells them to stfu and adapt and stop whining about losing passive income.    
---
4) Moon changes happen, income dries up, every fight turns into blob fights cause scheduled PVP with huge reinforcement periods.
---
5) Lowsec picks sides. SC/EE was with PanFam so Snuff went with Goons.     
---
6) The other sides picked shit allies and got poached, dumped shit content, and died.     
---
7) Snuff adapted like everyone said they should, started taking land and securing their area of operation like EVERYONE SAID THEY SHOULD, and people bitch and moan cause what Snuff FC's said was gonna happen happened and they adapted like you told them too.      
---
Boo. Fucking. Hoo.
---
just got 3 excavators booshed by booshers who didn't show up on local. i dont mind losing ships and stuff in eve, but when its due to a obvious bug it rustles my jimmies a bit.
---
Thanks for the suggestions! Flown carriers before (but not too much), havent done much with the new ships. I have a lot less time to play games now than I used to, if there was something to work towards casually that would be great. Love the community, just got bored with the game and didnt have time to play 20+ hours a week. 
---
&gt; The main advantage to using them in Null is they are generally considered bad and people will suicide T2 frigs like Assault Frigates and Interceptors into you if you know what you're doing. 
---
This cannot be underestimated especially with all the ramboi AF's and fleet fit dictors around. [I've had a lot of fun in meta fit t1 dessies in null](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73862906/) because they're off meta while I find that in FW space the meta is defined and T1 dessies are very much respected. It's almost impossible to catch someone off guard.

Only local? My corp chat is looking like wormhole local, and I can't join any new chats. 
---
Literally, dozens of VNI's, Ishtars, Snakes dying. 
---
Also There are a ton of Corporation that do small Pvp things like gate camps or 0.0 roams, for me that was the most fun in the last weeks. We meet like 2-3 times a week and don't take it too serious.  Maybe that's something you haven't done too :) 
---
consider moving everything to Jita from wherever it is right now. Sell most of it there before moving to Brave's (or whoever you join) home system. creating a Jita market alt may also be a good idea eventually.
---
dont bother trying to move stuff from jita to nullsec initially. Most newbie friendly groups will have free ships for you to start with and a decently stocked market to buy from locally. they should also have Jump Freighter services to safely move items that you can buy locally.
---
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER.
---
INCOMING DEAD FUCKING BOTTERS

all chat channels are showing no participants.  no local / no corp / no fleet / no private WH channels... NADA. at least i will get some sleep this weekend.  
---
EFT is in there.

How do you steAl excavators?
---
This is fun. Chat channels are empty, the names are blank or player_\*gibberish\* and it looks like I'm recieving the same messages over and over.
---
Oh, and currently I'm in a system 21 jumps away from where local says I am.
---
This is so broken it's amazing.
---
it looks like all chats are messed up
---
looks like a picked a good time to win eve
---
IMO local chat in non NPC local should be tied to some sort of ESS.
---
TBH if it were just local that wasn't working it wouldn't bother me, but it's ALL in game channels; intel, corp, alliance, inter-alliance coordination, opsex channels, everything.  This is un-fucking acceptable.
---
CCP - if you can't fix it replace it.  This shit has gone on long enough.
---
those are businesses, not private citizens. I get what you are trying to say. but you have gone so far off the point. this is a guy who has created a bulletin board for friends to talk. its not for profit, its not amazon fucking dot com. private citizen. hobby website. not for profit.  
---
Settings -&gt; General Settings -&gt; Merge "Items" and "Ships" into station panel  
---
Then you can see all your ships in a tab on the station panel and just click through them.

That's a good one, for me I would have to say, it would be Eha. I joined my first pvp corp and lived there for a year. Had a lot of firsts in that system.

considering most Highsec structures are probably undefended its not a terrible first choice. obviously you'd want a non-completion clause to get your ISK back and then consider hiring someone like TAPI or Horde's highsec muscle to do the eviction if it was defended. Obviously you'd expect to pay a much larger fee for such a contract.

just ban caps from lowsec. it's the only way to be sure.

Go lose something expensive for no reason. Fit a Stratios, roam wormholes looking for kills until you die. Pvp is its own reward. If you don't find that this is the case, then maybe you don't need to worry about any of this. EvE is what you want it to be

Everyone banding together for a world war snuff would be epic

We actually just kicked a bunch of botting corps and characters. If you have any credible intel send it to Kenny (can be found on the Init Renter alliance description.) He will look into it.

“I thought very long about how you were going to die. A bullet to the back of the head? Too simple. Hand you over to the crew, let them get some measure of revenge for all the comrades you lost? Too impersonal. Maybe I shouldn’t even kill you. I should leave you as you left me. Buried alive. Bleeding and broken in the dark. Somewhere that you could scream for help all you wanted but no one would ever come for you.” The pirate queen looked over at her captives. “That was tempting. It still is. But I made my decision. You can never pay the blood debt you owe, but this will be some small measure of atonement for your sins...
---
Do you know what crucifixion is?”
---
She straightened slowly, nodding to someone in the crowd. The captives turned, mouths agape as a pair of Red Hand ratings came forward, one of them carrying five EVA suits.... and the other had in each hand, a meter-long hull rivet.
---
“They say that you can’t look directly into shockspace,” the human said idly. “That it’s inherently incomprehensible to an organic mind.... but the thing is, the brain keeps trying. It keeps trying to force it to make sense and it can’t. It just can’t. But it just keeps on trying until it destroys itself in the attempt. I don’t know if that’s true. It’s probably just an old spacer’s tale... but you five are going to find out. Don’t worry, though. The suits will seal around the breach, so you don’t have to worry about decompression killing you. You’ll stay out there for days, screaming at nothing until your minds shatter. And,” she laughed again, even darker than before. “Here’s the thing... everyone who sees this ship from now on... they’ll remember what happens to people that turn on me. The next time someone comes to them with an offer, they’re going to think back to this moment. They’ll remember that I survived. That I found each and every one of the last set of people who betrayed me and then I made them atone for what they did.” 
---
She smiled thinly, like a knife’s edge. "Take them away."

Good job at running counter toaster ops btw

The nature of PvP mmo games.  Figure out an overpowered configuration where you get easy kills and the opposition has zero chance.  Then wonder why the game seems dead and there is a lack of noobs to feast on.
---
consider joining a newbie focused corp if you havent already done so. then place buy orders for minerals or ore in their local market and use the ore to manufacture t1 frigate, cruiser and industrial ships locally. the Jump Freighter costs make moving these types of items from Jita unprofitable.

#THE PURGE

Did you just ignore that SNUFF primarily drops larger null groups for their content? Just off the top of my head we dropped NC three times, Skillurslf, Tri, Init, and goons last month. We don't kill 5t+ a month punching down, that's just a time killer.

* Noctis gets shot, Orca De-cloaks
---
* Noctis pilot ejects while getting shot, then boards a T3 from the Orca

* EFYRR lands and starts repping the now empty noctis, Cap Transfer to the T3, and bumping the fool off the undock.
---
* Things escalate, alot!
---
* Ends with a blown up Noctis, 6 T3 pilots with various limited engagements and many kills each, 7 Guardians spreed across 200Km of space and an empty Orca.  (One Orca pilot ejected to board a Guardian to keep the cap chain going.)

The real casualty of this is that sometimes you'll enter a wormhole and it will have local. Our lack of local is sacred and please never take that away from us.

Did you not read the blog? They're going to announce at the *end* of the month what they plan on doing, because they're going to be attempting to correct the issues until then, and if the can't do anything to fix it to a satisfactory level, they'll decide what to do. A rollback is a possibility thought. But not till probably spring.
---
I am part of the problem, yes.  Not that we have a lot of choice -- it's team up with Imperium or let PanFam kill us, and fuck you if you think I'm going to roll over for your benefit.
---
This. Don't really care about local for the most part, unless there is some good spamming to do. But yeah, getting back player created channel would be great.

then snuff would definitely roll all over everyone

No.

Yes CCP, please keep a change you didn't communicate that affects many aspects of your game. :SMART:
---
&gt; Merge "Items" and "Ships" into station panel
---
That is cool, but still not good enough. It should be cool to look though your ships. Also this adds nothing information wise, e.g if I want to find a insta warp ship that I have fitted. I just have to sellect each ship and make active check aline speed. Vs a better ship hangar that would show me this with out making the ship active.

Yeah I wonder why they drop depots while your more intelligent comrades bump them apart hmmm

Depending on your alliance they might have small gang sigs or squads available to you. Best of both worlds.

Ships are basically ammo outside of highsec, less of a collection really..  my ships are initial-doctrine initial then a second letter if it's a variant. So if you're Bob, your shield kitey doctrine is called alpha, it'd be B-A, if you then have the same ship but this one has boosts, it'd be B-Ab, I know what they all mean but other people probably won't.

When *dumb carebears lose their local
---
If I knew in advance and we were somehow able to I would choose:
---
PE1-R1. Site of my first and last AT matches. I’d be ok with the pre-match condition of can’t move can’t do nothing. Just to be there again one final time. 
---
Ship: My AT ship. I’d try and enjoy it’s shiny goldness one last time before I walked away from this game again and went back to enjoying RL sans Eve. 
---
If I couldn’t get to PE1-R1 for rather obvious reasons.
---
System: Bourynes. The place were I first fell in love with this game. 
---
Ship: My AT ship again. Just aligned into oblivion out in space somewhere. 
---
&gt; apparently this is just tip of the iceberg of game breaking issues.
---
Depends on what your 'game' is, but local being broken is the only one that's had a massive impact on me.  The other ones that people have been complaining about recently (warp in/D-scan) have already been fixed.
---
i've just went on a roam and i've killed two vnis in an astero lol
---
The 23rd letter of the English alphabet is a bit of a wonder. 
---
The humble “w” is the only letter of the alphabet with a three-syllable name. It is also the only letter with a name that does not indicate its phonetic use. 
---
Complications of “w” are doublefold because of its name, ‘double u’ and its shape, ‘double v’. 
---
What’s going on here? 
---
Do you consider it merely coincidence that "W' is the key you press to move forward? 
---
A symbol of moving onward and the advancment of all things, both perminent and ephemeral, "W" is predicated on pushing limits and breaking barriers (it's why we voted for Hillary, to be honest). 
---
Flanked by two doward arrows, the center arrow points upwards; demonstrating a triumphant state despite adversity. Progression is rarely met without challenge.

just don't be poor LMAO
---
So am I the only one who can't see anything in any chat channel?
---
System: New Eden  
---
Ship: 50mn Punisher, speeding towards eve gate.  
---
["Mama, I'm coming home"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0siYUjV9UM)
---
Chats are randomly not working.  This isn't about local chat.
---
CCP is just using this as an excuse for botters to be purged by players and bug zapped. *tin foil*.
---
Leave goons, this is every day.
---
HERO AGAINST WORLD... jk
---
Ya, I guess I didn't give a good enough price
---
Why was u rorq mining when local was not working?
---
Buy boting 
---
2019 eve summed up pretty well
---
you see guys its a feature!
---
Yeah man. I'm building my own sandcastle now a days.
---
What range to the can are you? Because what it sounds like is that you are overshooting the can. If you are using a microwarpdrive and orbiting the can, you have to do it at something like 1000m to not end up outside the range of your analyzer. 
---
dont worry, they will still be there next week if you roam through ''their'' space...
---
happily orbiting anoms and instantly warping to pos as soon as you enter local...
---
My limited experience with duels?
---
Player A: Not exactly a Veteran, and Recently got his new, shiny Federation Navy Comet, eager to test it out
---
Player B: Has an expensive fit pirate frigate that Player A has no idea about its power
---
Player B challenges Player A to a duel. Player A accepts because it seems fair
---
Player B proceeds to murder Player A in a matter of seconds
---
Player A realized how unfair fights are
---
Player A now mainly does PvE
---
tfw I’m Player A, and have been ever since
---
I always thought the hangar should work more like the industry window. Click on a bpc and all the info and graphics pop up   
---
Just adapt
---
I would think that if they banned them lmao
---
Nah but the banning cap idea is retarded
---
We are aware.
---
Though I much prefer no local. 
---
InB4 Support is overloaded with ship reimbursements

Hope CCP gets all of them. Goons or not...but you know hope is the first step on the road to disappointment...
---
Good on you dude, glad to see you enjoying things: )
---
Jeez, it can't get more obvious
---
Bird box meme checks out
---
Should make it a monthly event. Kill all chats and do a bot purge. It's like shooting fish in a barrel right now. 
---
Read it again. This is not the normal advice.
---
On the other hand, farming blinged bots is now a thing~
---

---
I hope he comes back here and apologises to CCP afterwards. 
---
keep telling yourself that.
---
as nice as all the dead bots are, it';s frustrating not being able to talk to any of my alliance mates in game, or share intel in game, or use any other chat functions in game. not worth it, IMO
---
The problem with using this as a good time for combat ops is even fleets seem to be fucked. All my chats are blank except for the one that is locked to a picture of what it was like 2 hours ago. I pay money for this shit?
---
I take it you blitz Cargo, rather than shoot &amp; loot?
---
Botting in Rorquals obviously
---
Last I checked, a Rorqual can live.
---
On the other hand, the drones likely can't.
---
Oh so /r/eve is the new chat server?   
---
Genius.
---
My only other question would be is if all the cans are blowing up? Because sites only last so long. Its something like 24-36 hours and if he is in the site doing them all the cans explode at once and stops him from hacking if he is already doing it. I've had this happen to me. But finding this many sites at the end of their life is a little odd, I don't think I've found this many in the 3 years that I've been playing and I only do exploration for isk.
---
Reports currently are coming in of bots undocking in pods and orbiting anomalies :thinking:
---
bot miner in delve [https://zkillboard.com/related/30004741/201901130300/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004741/201901130300/)
---
We really dont want to see what NSFW subs you frequent 
---
Shockingly blatant. At least they died this time. 
---
So I'm wondering - if the botters ask for reibursement - wouldn't that automatically arouse suspicion from CCP? (i.e., losing multiple ships either in the same system or in different systems spread out over time and space from single IP and MAC address)  
---
because last time I checked CCP doesn't reimburse for being afk
---
No, they're broken. 
---
All chats are being affected to one degree or another, not just local chat.
---
yeah thats what im thinking. /r/eve is the new local
---
They do reimbursement when their system fucks up.
---
"My local didnt update when neuts came in system, its your fault, give muh ships back, waaaah"
---
That Kind of salt.
---
Burning towards the Eve Gate in a 50mn Dramiel (isn't that the fastest ship?)
---
You're right. Clearly there is no merit to infograph vs a table. Everyone always knows the table is better.
---
It's almost like removing local cures the bot problem! :)
---
mods op
---
Single fight is farming now?
---
Why was this removed.....
---
This is a great idea that will never happen
---
It just means they're active players that don't want to feed to your elite pvp ship lmao.
---
The purge is on.
---
Are those tikle renters?
---
I'd rather have my game work than bots die when it doesn't. A working game with a company that gives a shit wouldn't let either be so prevalent.
---
Just an active player that doesn't want to get ganked by an el33t PVPer and his gang of blobbers!
---
Still missing a few regions. Go get em
---
if you approach the can with mwd on and activate your analyzer soon as you are in range you can be bounced out of range pretty easily if your ship is light enough.
---
I've found with one mwd pulse on arrival my helios won't bounce out but my astero would every time.
---
I can't believe the mods are oppressing my god-given right to shitpost.
---
This is an attack on my family values. And by family, I mean my primary hobby community, which I cling to in a futile attempt to fill the void in my soul left by being without a family.
---
I think the asian players in this game don't have their overviews setup.  Tonight we would land on grid with ratting VNI's / gila who normally pay really close attention to their surroundings and warp as soon as you enter local.  These guys just stayed on grid and never even tried to warp to their pos.
---
Yeah, IIRC you just have to burn to the warehouse in something nimble, grab the Quafe from within, and then warp off immediately.
---
I blitz everything except Zazzmatazz and Damsel due to implant drops. I usually skip Rogue Slave Trader and Assault. I only do them if I've declined too many and agent standings are in danger of falling below -2.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/ship/17843/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/17843/losses/)
---
How often do you get the good Zor implant rather than just the trash one?
---
Just adapt lmao
---
Buy a rorqual lmao
---
REVOLT!
---
Not often. I haven't kept track, but I would guess around 5% of the time.
---
The irony
---
Lots of weird stuff going on, these "NOT BOTS" guys dont even attempt to leave grid when 15 people are shooting them. Lmao
---
Every chat channel is out for me.
---
Not sure who they belong to. The Fake Esoteria Constellation has TIKLE and Dangerous Voltage sovereignty. So my guess is one of those two. 
---
REMOVE LOCAL
---
yeah it was a lot of fun moving a freighter today lol
---
AFAIK the chat servers are hosted [in the UK.](https://prohardver.hu/dl/upc/2012-09/23987_brittish.png)
---
No, the best part was that your fleet popped into my local about the same time as 4 or 5 alliance mates.
---
We were all in different systems. 
---
Ah, gotta love it.
---
As much as I enjoyed the surge of activity and content myself due to this random bug, I assure you botters will simply adapt even if the local is removed.
---
This is fake news... CCP moved the botters to high sec.
---
lol valkorsia post
---
&gt; 5) Lowsec picks sides. SC/EE was with PanFam so Snuff went with Goons.
---
...
---
Holy shit, thaaaaat's some interesting revisionist history right there. I specifically remember Shadow Cartel and Snuff fighting Goons side by side during WWB. Remind me why that ended.
---
Death to all botters
---
Unfortunately, the reality is that botters would adapt, real players would get nerfed. 
---
I've been similar, except I'd gone to PvE because half the time no commands go through in time for me to do anything (shitty internet). Also never be afraid to ask the other guy why you lost. It's possible they're not so much of a dick and they can explain how they handed you your ass. Every fight is a learning opportunity.
---
Loggoffski maneuver? That used to work?
---
I have a private channel for all of my alts. I am looking at 3 of my alts in that chat... I’m only logged into 1. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/ship/17843/losses/
---
Me and my mates were on voice comms, and we worked fine as a small gang. I can see how large fleets could be nearly impossible though.
---
Man, I haven't cringed this hard since the Kavanaugh hearing. 
---
Tales of confused pods orbiting sanctums thinking they're still in VNIs still abound to this day
---
Botpocalypse
---
Usually it’s because they’re using like a Pirate Frigate and I’m sorting here in a t1 Frigate
---
Do you not know how to D-Scan?
---
how would they differentiate from friendly and hostile though, lmao
---
[https://zkillboard.com/region/10000063/](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000063/) Period Basis is being burned too! :D
---
hey thats more of a chat window than any of my characters have right now.
---
Why would they need to? They are bots. They can just warp to a safe. 
---
Im hard....like, not even ashamed, Rock Hard.
---
fedup with no backup
---
Those names... Are they even trying to hide??
---
but any time there are massive losses everywhere due to issues they usually just refuse all reimbursements
---
bpc price is gonna go up again
---
Does that apply to bots in supers? :)
---
Report it. 
---
Was it though? Part 2 coming soon(tm)
---
Local is supremely fucked - remove all in-game chat systems til fixed
---
How does this affect highsec distribution mission and market bots? What about plexing bots?
---
Oh, thats right, it does nothing. Players cannot fix this problem.
---
I think most people havr even forgotten that period basis even exists...
---
Goons' capital, siege green on the keepstar. :D
---
CCP literally ban these punks 
---
System: 68-QLA on the EH2I-P gate
---
Ship: Manticore
---
This is the site and ship I used for my first solo kill(not that I have alot). I would go here sit off the gate at 30 km and wait and remember all the good times I had, until just before the servers shut down and launch one final bomb at that gate. And if I could I would do it in the alliance and corp that I was in on the day that I got that kill.
---
More VNIs have died since local went down 4\~ Hours ago than the entirety of yesterday. :) 
---
disposable cyno phoenix
---
But then how do I question my opponents mothers choice in occupations when it comes to paying rent during a gud fire?
---
They just change the bot a bit to account for more losses overall. Players cannot fix this problem.

You require a pulse? SHIT! I'm never gonna get in.

---
reminds me of the nostalrius server shutdown. people handled it very differently
---
stop posting about local and go help the real people kill bots.
---
Good companies can do both, sadly CCP is not as good as they used to be
---
yeah exactly, let us be able to organise our ships how we want, armour or shield doctrines, ratting or pvp, we should be able to slice and dice with sub-hangars how we see fit.
---
That being said, Unlike almost any other software team, CCP has always seemed terrified of any code that involves nesting containers. It's not rocket science guys.
---
Silver miner is just some highly autistic guy though
---
Some of the CSM own lots of VNI BPC's right? :thonking:
---
Hi sec suddenly feels like a wormhole, but without all the scanning. It is glorious.
---
As a scared newbie, I asked a random person in local to scout a system for me because I accidentally bought a ship in lowsec. He became my best friend for the next 13 years. Joined his alliance and started roaming nanocanes in the height of nano meta with him and his friends. They became my friends as well in time. He taught me basically everything in this game early on.
---
None of them still play, truth be told. Some left for new games. Some left for irl. Some of them left irl as well rip. But that same random dude I asked to scout me to pick up a shitty t1 frigate and I are still the closest of friends, and though he's quit we play other games together though he doesn't have much time to himself nowadays between his family and work.

---
Welcome to J-space, fuckers.
---
It’s silver miner though, he’s known for using this setup and is just some guy, not a bot.
---
That being said, remove local and death to the bot menace
---
you understand non-bot multiboxers are getting fucked by this too? 
---
Fuckin hell, almost 400 VNIs. 2% of the game dying in VNIs over the course of 4 hours. Add in all the other shit that died too and I wonder how high you'd get. 
---
Nice :D
---
Wherever I left him, which is in some station belonging to an alliance that has probably kicked me by now. If the station isn't there then I don't have a clue.
---
join the channel "bringing solo back" and post lossmails
---
cruisers are really effective for small gang, osprey navy and omen navy are the obvious ones
---
good thing we already have cloaks/recons...
---
I feel like xmas came and went while I slept
---
Anything you can do a bot can do better. That includes 24/7 gate and wh watch, and dscan watch. It's fallacious to assume bots could not adapt to the changes and that humans universally would. To be perfectly honest it would probably actually be easier for bots to adapt to living in that new system than it would be for average players.
---
As a VNI multiboxer (12 at once...beat that), I wisely docked when local died. The rest of TEST didn’t have a good night because they decided to keep crabbing. 
---
I agree. Not that I know the inner workings of CCP but I'm pretty sure the devs would love to spend more time fixing this + a lot of other things. But there are certain people that would like them to work on stuff that brings in money instead.
---

It's legit fun without local
---
The game is SO much better without it
---
Out of curiosity, how would the t1 variant do? I'm pretty new and wouldn't like to lose too much ISK at the beginning. 
---
Ship names.
---
Now if only the Citadels lose their precious asset safety.
---
Still wont change their inboxes being stuffed full of request tickets 
---
Wally are you coming back to Eve?
---
seriously? explain!
---
if losing t2-fitted t1 cruisers is too much ISK for you, I think it might be better to start with T1 frigs etc.
---
some of the best solo PvP'ers playing right now started out just flying T1 frigs in null
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/95574399/group/25/losses/ is filtered specifically for frigs, you will have to go a lot of pages back to find all the fits + avoid the garmur/dramiel/etc. fits that are too expensive
---
Of course not, that would mess up their ticks. Just because a new wave of flashing red ships warped in dont change anything.
---
or just VNIs as a whole: https://zkillboard.com/ship/17843/losses/
---
Tried to take vni out cause its a fucking Sunday and my krabbing day.
---
test inties rekt me.

Loss isnt an issue. 
---
Not being able to fucking  play the game is.

" Snuff adapted like everyone said they should, started taking land and securing their area of operation like EVERYONE SAID THEY SHOULD, and people bitch and moan cause what Snuff FC's said was gonna happen happened and they adapted like you told them too. "
---
\- I thought you just went and crabbed in goons space, built up a nice super fleet then came back to LS when you got bored of it. Snuff have only been building their LS space for the past few months.
---
Basically the reason Snuff is doing so well is because you have two of the better FC's in the game, being Tau and Hy which keeps your line members logging in and attracts new corps. Economics has nothing to do with it. SDWC was 'adapting' and taking moons long before Snuff started doing it, they just don't have content creators of the same calibre.
---
If Tau and Hy go inactive, snuff will failscade like every other LS alliance.
---
Oof Someone is out of touch.
---
1. No.  2. Cloak ships. 3. Irony overloading. 4. To be perfectly honest you need to rethink your logic.
---
&gt; Not being able to fucking play the game is.
---
i mean you just did right? and then you died in a pvp game... cant see anything wrong here...
---
Fleet/corp chats are down too.
---
Market is barely fuckin moving.
---
A game shouldnt need outside tools ( discord;etc ) to be playable at minimum.
---
This is a dream come true. Wow, what a way to re-invent EVE and make it exciting again!
---
Noob question: How does chat being affected kill bots?
---
It is not just local. No corp, no alliance, no intel no nothing... Is broken as...
---
yeah he blue scouts in a malediction real skill
---
This chat issue have existed for months. How fkn incompetent is this company?? Never witnessed such incompetent reaction and discission making towards solving grave issues its customers are clearly having. This kind of arrogant behaviour can only exist in online gaming companies. Anywhere else, the company would have died long ago
---
This is one of the posts - that make me come back every day to reddit!
---
Thanks for your effort!
---
Take my Upvote!
---
As soon as bots see something in local, they run and dock. Like shooting fish in a barrel right now. :-)
---
Only problem with that is that you get two tries, the first one range breaking won't make the can explode.
---
No mention of d-scan. Seems if you didnt use that its your own fault you died
---
&gt; Fleet/corp chats are down too.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Market is barely fuckin moving.
---
yeah.. its annoying. and yes ccp should fix it. but still, actually beeing able to catch bots for once is nice.
---
True
---
Chat now available in the NES for just 500 plex! 
---
Its a vni; who gives a fuck.
---
Holy crap, they are in all the big alliances. 
---
I took a break from Eve for a few months and came back to the largest collection of terrible posting the world has ever seen.
---
Shark week is starting soon boys and girls.
---
Silver miner that’s a lot of legit clicking........
---
Nice. These guys are from one of the corps in that post about botting in vale I made. 
---
Guess CCP nor ladyscarlet care to enforce the rules when they're out of the spotlight.
---
Stay away, Jib. There's nothing worthwhile here.
---
that looks like a real fun and nearly even fight, props to everyone involved
---
Yeah , really fun recently , more chance to fight.
---
Oof, people living in k-space are having a hard time. Wormholer btw.
---
Oh shit, so it is, and with quite big font too! 
---
somebody STOP ME!!!
---
i mean, VNI afk ratting is very popular due to the fact that you can pretty much afk with it anyways
---
I have no problems running EVE with wine on Fedora. Make sure to use [https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) which also increases performance by using vulkan for acceleration. 
---
You're only allowed to take breaks if deadtear will mod for you. 
---
Can we make this permanent?
---
Why nobody remembers the mighty AK47 a'ka Thrasher 
---
I love it now
---
You connected the argument weirdly. I didn't say SC didn't adapt, I said they picked shit allies. I was in SC and thearrowofapollo was doing PanFam fleets almost every night and it was horrible and people stopped logging in cause of it. All the while NC was trying to buy off SC members (I joined NC for 9b/m). So they got poached, got shit blob null content, and died just like I said.     
---
So, Snuff joins Imperium for isk making and building super fleet. Snuff knows it doesn't want to stay in Imp forever. Starts holding 64's in their AO but not mining them. *Insert Mikal getting HAW titans dropped on his VNIs meme. Snuff decided it needed to open op it's target list, leaves Imp. Still wants to provide SRP and income for its members so grabs more moons. Mining in Lowsec is dangerous AF cause it's high traffic compared to Null. So we have to make it safe by destroying traffic. *Insert Snuff is killing lowsec meme.
---
"let's fuck with the legit players to kill bots"
---
yeah no, if they do that they're retarded
---
So what happend?
---
Did it just dissapear out of nowhere?
---
 Can we get a total VNI loss count after down time? Thanks
---
if you can kill a game with one group the game is designed like dogshit
---
one of the ancient monsters has been slain. 
---
annnd, bumped to next version. 
---
What do you mean, goons came to every fedup fort defense timer. 
---
&gt; (One Orca pilot ejected to board a Guardian to keep the cap chain going.)

mmmm, ballsy move.

I've had a few hot swaps in space from my time, but I never left anything particularly valuable floating in space.

---
No, I was interested only in average values. I think most that I've got from 1 Sansha site was 150kk. Theoretical maximum is 543kk by todays prices, but the probability is so small, that you never see it happening, even something close to that.
---
fix le chat please
---
You’re doing it right!
---
I mean, part of it might be the cancerous speed that snuff is growing. Snuff and wangs is around 1800-2000 characters when the alliance closest to competing is around 650 characters.
---
I offered deadtear mod and he told me "fuck no".
---
ya but this is all just coincidence, botting absolutly isnt rampant or anything like that
---
Today was a good fucking day.
---
That's untrue. You guys did ref our stuff over the holidays.
---
Well that's a fair assessment.
---
My point being that you can have the best economic plan to use low-sec in the game. People don't come to low-sec for the income, they come for the content and Snuff have the best content creators in LS atm. 
---
I may actually be wrong in saying people are attracted to 'content creators'. People are attracted to winning and having a good enough ticker tank that they can yolo their supers/titans around without fear. People don't just want good fights, they want a pretty killboard.
---
So as far as i'm concerned its not Snuff's fault that nobody else in low-sec can touch them. Nobody wants to join a low-sec corp that doesn't give them 24/7 content made by someone else who will make their KB look good and let them drop supers every day (o/ Adversity).
---
I hope so but not really. If it happened for a week maybe
---
That's untrue, you guys reffed our sov and forts over the holidays and we were on our own for those. 
---
and we get told they are takeing care of bots with there great detection system.... wanna bet how many are alpha clones?
---
2nd one looks like Ming The Merciless from Flash Gordon.
---
He mines all day every day. Mining is literally the dude's life.
---
it's almost like players also rely on local....
---
Retention doesn't mean people using the window, it means new player retention as in new players not quitting after 3 hours and never coming back.
---
The agency window, despite being mostly shit (albeit snazzy looking shit) for older players is a good thing for new players.
---
alpha clone?
---
Fortunately, it was easy to see, with those big red arrows and all...
---
You know, when progod said no krabbing this weekend, I think this is not what he meant.
---
Objectively - i pay money for broken game. It is \[censored\] \[censored\]
---
As i known - Eve use amazon servers. DONT USE AMAZON SHIT.
---
;0
---
We literally ran around for over a year as a solo corp in like 6 or 7 different regions dropping supers by ourself and running our own pvp campaigns
---
Are you implying that we needed to join snuff so that we would have the ability to do what we have been doing as a corp for the better part of four or five years now
---
Can we all just sit back and realize that we actually pay these people to play a broken video game.   
---
What suckers we are. 
---
Cloak ships show themselves for a tick when they leave the gate. That's all it takes to be spotted by an ever vigilant cloaked bot watching said gate. You will also be visible for a moment when you jump out meaning watching the other side would also catch sight of cloaked ships.
---
Remember, bots don't get tired, they don't blink and they only make mistakes that were programmed into them, and they can be programmed not to make that mistake again.
---
This is why trying to change the mechanics to make them suffer doesn't work, people suffer, bots do not.

I got 25 all up, best day ever
---
I really hope you realize that with the entire chat system down, there are a lot of false positives being assumed bot's because no in-game intel channels are available to anyone.  
---
Obviously there are going to be some bots in there somewhere, maybe more than usual but I see a lot of things on these killboards that could just as well be legitimate players who lost their normal warning channels.  
---
I would not call half  the killboards you guys have posted, hard evidence as such.
---
No. You've been running around getting fights for sure, but your supers have never been more active than they are now and for the most part you were having very little impact wherever you deployed. You were running T1 doctrines for the most part.
---
Kudos for actually creating your own content there. You've joined snuff so you can undock the shiny things.
---
There was no previous Perimeter Keepstar.
---
That Chinese sentence in opening means something like....
---
"Large Gay Alliance with passionate nake chat online"
---
I AM NOT A PART OF THIS.
---
Really.
---
Are you literally fucking stupid 90% of my corps supers are inactive compared to literally months of hunting and farming in the north
---
IDK what you're talking about. My local shows 44 people in my system, and all of them Goons. Must all be cloaked though as I can't find them with probes and they're not in the stations...
---
Yeah. If the clone bay only runs out of fuel, the clone is not accessible until it's fueled again. If the clone bay gets removed or the citadel is destroyed, the clone is also destroyed.
---
dont lie to everyone you have the best ass in our alliance\~\~\~
---
Certainly hope so, I have a thousand sitting in Jita
---
to be fair is anyone not hoarding VNIs at the moment? 
---
It's great but let's be real, it's 90 mil per bot. The real positive result of this accidental feature is that it's proof of how pervasive the botting problem still is.
---
Is Kenny on Reddit? Can you fwd this: https://i.imgur.com/QB3bWq6.jpg
---
Also [Centura](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74540248/) and [Princess Dread](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74540227/). We were roaming and headed from J5A over to D2AH. We tackled a VNI in a diff plex, and our guy called the Rattle &amp; Ishtar in Sanctum. We raced in, caught them, and then... nothing. They didn't respond. No locks, no boosts, no movement, no drone aggro. It was pretty disappointing. 
---
There's others about, but when I'm able to look Kenny up, if I'm roaming about, I'll forward on more stuff. It's really frustrating, and it's utterly rampant and it feels like "we're doing stuff" is posturing / not legit, but if it is, thanks.
---
Cheers mate.
---
When you're a corp made up of gay people with a fiery passion for a handsome Russian fc there's only one place to go
---
our corp Brand Newbros caught a botting super, im sure that hurt a little, but ultimately you are right.
---
Fair enough. I wasn’t there, I figured goons still showed up to the fort. 
---
100% confirmed bot super ratting in Period Basis, fighter recall glitch and everything, no attempts to defend.
---
/Supported
---
Same with Elite Dangerous. 
---
All these nerds love their space ship games.
---
Do I need to be in a player corp to do Planetary Interaction? (Not placing my own POCOs).
---
The bots would just be reprogramed to use Dscan for when local is down. 
---
welcome to the thunderdome that is wormhole space, now to put scouts on gates and be on comms with your Corp so you know what's going on.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/95497867/
---
You don't need no local to kill bots. 
---
it's almost as if removing local would fix the botting problem
---
This is eve art
---
ah, good to have additional proof.  i know without local someone could kill all my VNIs in a system as i don't frequently check them, though they would just sit there though (if the guy was reported in intel though, i'd be paying attention).
---
any idea who to talk to about violent fortuna. i got mountains of them  in pure blind. 
---
Where to hunt the bots? Im a bit of a noob. Are there any particularly popular mining spots that the bots mine in? cant find a soula t the moment.
---
why that constellation is not Test is a little complicated - it was given to tikle/dv when CO2 pitched a fit over the initial rental areas.  as its outside of d-p supercap or bridge range, it has reduced value to test.
---
b-but maybe he was just so shocked and paniced that local and Intel was down that he just didn't defend himself at all due to the sheer shock.
---
Same thing that happened to all the VNIs that died tonight, especially in Esoteria 
---
Which is a problem that removing local will fix! :)
---
eh, bombing run by cloakies.  doesn't prove the guy is botting.  macks are more a ship you use if you are a non-bot with a high number of windows.
---
Such a good fight! Yst &amp; Njf No.1!
---
still better than it is now. you can bypass dscan with cloaks/dscan immune ships... you cant bypass showing up in local
---
lol tard, i didn't do anything wrong. its not my fault cause they are stupid but unfortunately with power.
---
low sec ? who cares? next
---
BuT eVE HaS nO CoNtENt Hur DuRr DURr

you won with this [https://zkillboard.com/related/30045337/201901122000/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30045337/201901122000/)
---
How do you know they are bots ? Maybe its just a good multiboxer. Its OK when code can multibox, bit when a miner does its a bot ? I am against botting, but maybe this is all legit.
---
The in-game speeds are the actual speeds of ships. 
---
When you die your pod stays at 0ms unless you give it more commands, so if it's moving then the person must be at keyboard after it died. So for it to sit around orbiting is super suspect 
---
Youre wrong.
---
&gt; I hope we get some kind of compensation from this. 
---
If you petition losses suffered while the chats are down, CCP will probably reimburse you.
---
If you're hoping for some sort of SP compensation, likely not happening until after the overall problem is dealt with. (50k SP in 2020 \\o/)
---
&gt; Also hoping CCP bans all these bots that have been found today. 
---
Doesn't seem very likely. Their track record at dealing with bots isn't exactly impressive.
---
Awesome
---
Why is it called fake esoteria btw?
---
You mean the intel bots? 
---
Well I'd like to see that we can actually walk in stations.
---
I hope all botters get banned regardless of alliance if thats what youre getting at
---
Stabber.  They are awesome and people will want to fight you.
---
Neat
---
Well, during th holidays CCP made sure we have an abundance of materials for shitposts with the tons of buys they released.
---
well fuck there goes the VNI prices again
---
The bots are still there.  Removal of local does not remove them.
---
yes, which is why i said good to have the additional proof.  when my vni dies, the pod just sits on the wreck until i tab back to that window.
---
But, but Goons said they do not support botters. :(
---
By botting for like 4-5 days?
---
Lemme tell you a secret, domis are better afk krabbing ship. 
---
VNI sellers, rejoice!
---
And then the devs come and *balance* things
---
We’re missing this part from eve 
---
I said it before and I’ll say it again. Just remove local so we can eradicate the bots.
---
Costs money to keep the other half and contrary to popular belief, a company needs money.
---
EVE's real-space engines are not 'reaction' based and do not conserve momentum. They're all essentially 'slow warp' engines. The 'thrusters' at the back of ships are not thrusters at all, but actually plasma exhausts for the space magic 'slow warp'.
---
Max Singularity had a whole presentation on it at EVE Fanfest 2017.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqQO0vY8VMk
---
That's why exploration bots are sent mostly in the Gurista regions inside and around Venal. Sparse population = a lot of sites.
---
and they ll get srp from ccp .....cos ccp likes bots :P
---
No you can do them in a npc corp.
---
I laughed so hard when I saw this, and it's so applicable to goons lmao. Take my upvote xD
---
+1  
---
Also, it must ge optional.
---
I think going out in a cloaked Tengu at the Eve Gate doesn't sound so bad. 
---
Thanks CCP
---
Use dscan,  quit complaining
---
*comes to reddit to cry about his losses*
---
"I don't care about my losses"
---
okaylad
---
I would love a ship hangar that you coupd just walk around in and look at all your shit. That would be so fuckin cool
---
Fap
---
I liked that feature vOv 
---
But that's too hard for nullsec
---
since we are all hooked on that drug called EVE they can do whatever they want anyway. Noone quits because of anything. There are no consequences either.
---
Dual Web Arty Rupture. They've been around forever and still seem to confuse the fuck out of people who insist on orbiting at 500. XLASB/Web/Scram Stabber is also lowkey amazing but you do have to pick your fights. Neither need T2 anything though hopefully by T1 you mean meta stuff.
---
Both the Bellicose and Arbitrator are interesting too cause everyone will fight you but not quite settled on a fit for either, both are pretty flexible and get kills but I can't decide definitively quite how they work best.
---
If you do end up going small gang the Omen is hilariously underrated when at least 3/4 of you can cover each others blind spots, the DPS/Projection is ridiculous for a Cruiser and nobody is scared of Omens.
---
GL with it.
---
Either way it's a win.  Why let people have such an easy time to be risk averse
---
Take my up vote 
---
Story : Gangrene Chaser (or Dankguy) made a post a few weeks ago about WERMT bots. He's farming in some systems that are empty at night with a former WERMT corp called "Living With Sensation" and is usually uncatchable (guess why). Yet, he dies that night where local has a stroke.
---
Something Something

Should make a stick thread with who to contact with credible bot info to get kicked from alliances.

F for a fallen brother in local limbo

well the in game speed get adjusted for  balance so they can be off. 
---
legion will handle lvl 4s fine with t2 fit the t3ds are all pretty good I recently trained into the confessor and jackdaw for high sec exploration and low class wh stuff currently training into the hecate so I can start collecting some skins for my indy alts.
---
Both ships are omega only though so would need omega to fly them, also as someone who can fly 3 of the 4 marauders if all your gonna use it for is high sec missions grab a navy/pirate bs instead cheaper including most fits will clear just as fast just drop mtus in each mission and after 4/5 switch to a salvage catalyst 
---
*Pandemic Horde Harboring World War Bee Heros*
---
i always though that was just a theory off how the in game physics could work. but did ccp confirm that's how it works ? 
---
That's a lot of macks.
---
Even the dumbest bluedonut nullblocks know to:
---
- leave some content small groups at their doorstep
---
- remove blue standings and just have a NIP
---
- don't drop caps/super on everything unless it's in their krabbing zone
---
Now it's up to Snuffed out to find some new content for themselves as all the small groups are leaving lowsec. Hopefully Snuffed will find balls to play with big guys, where their superfleet is finally at some risk and isn't an instawin button as it was in lowsec.
---
Lol, I guess you'll let every VNI that locks you back go or offer everyone who is semi-afk doing something else on different account a reimbursement??
---
Removing local punishes regular people as much as bots.
---
Legit players don't need local.
---
Tbh i still think this looks better than the current the agency map we have
---
You missed an opportunity to say "We found Razor!"
---
For dictors you value speed and agility.
---
The stiletto just have a great slot layout combined with speed and agility which is everything for a ceptor.

The loki is just straight better than the other t3s.

I think this is the nature of almost anything sufficiently complex. You try to figure out the easiest and most consistent way to succeed.

I've gotten to see it a lot in MtG and Path of Exile.

It's a 'pocket' of space in the middle of Paragon Soul, and is further away from 'real' Esoteria in terms of jump ranges than a significant part of Paragon Soul.
---
Much like Fake Querious is functionally Delve, Fake Esoteria is much more Paragon Soul.
---
Any stat changes are in universe changes too. If a ship gets changed to go faster/slower it's due to a change to the propulsion systems. 
---
That means : MURDER ALL THOSE BOTS KHORNE DEMANDS THERE SKULLS.

Are you saying they weren't profitable in 2016?
---
It has been printed in the "Frigates of Eve" book that was released by CCP, so I would take it as confirmed. There is a short story at the end of the book where Max Signularity himself speaks in front of a class of amarrian capsuleer students and explains some of the things from the presentation. It also includes the systems diagram used in the presentation.
---
Also, PVP funds aren't the only reason to PVE. I'll never forget when my alliance undocked for a keepstar defense and so many capitals still had the "GB SHIPYARDS RV-00(X)" tags on them I applied to all the capitals I built and fitted. 
---
Do what makes eve fun for you. For me, its building big shooty ships for my friends and occasionally using them with friends. 
---
Is this a gift from CCP?
---
Mmh ok i guees thats right. Retro fits an what notn *if only you could go back on some off them upgrades*
---
What's the quickest way to grind faction rep? I wanted to get a friend's account up to speed, and get him into L2/L2 stuff as as soon as possible, not specifically security just all round for faction. I'm assuming just distribution or easy security stuff in a hub with a bunch of agents. 
---
Mmh ok thanks. Now i tones off questions on how this system would interact with stuff like gravity well an such.
---
Says the guy who doesnt do code.
---
&gt; Sure, CCP isn't really handling the botting issue / perception correctly - but do we need threads + comments every single day about it? I've had potential new players that think the game is so infested with bots that they are too terrified to play / invest too much time into the game... even if they really like it. Some are literally under the impression that half of Eve is bots. We all know the problem isn't anywhere near that bad but collectively that is the image we've given Eve lately and that is mostly on r/eve's shoulders.
---
This did not age well with the current bot deaths showing up while local chat is fucked.
---
This is why CCP should enforce anti-botting and not ignore every single renting entity profiting off of botters while they lie about not knowing. 
---
legitimate players don't 'need' anything
---
but if it's a gameplay mechanic people rely on it, and for it to not work properly is bullshit
---
Props to those who went out and killed bots. 
---
look at Zkill. go the areas where lots of VNIs have died
---
Not just local. All channels are fucked for me.
---
I'm only showing up in Abyssal space, oddly enough
---
oh ok. thanks for explaining TEST's botting rules :)
---
Is this the Chexit?
---
no local = he can just petition it and get the loss back
---
DScan is life
---
Killed a Slyce Pirates Hel earlier because of it 😂 
---
Please vent your rage in local chat
---
every rorqual miner is bot now?
---
Hint: Moon mining requires from you to limit people moving in the area.               
---
One of the few things that CCP didn't "think of" when they implemented this mechanic ... and rorquals.       
---
Hate goons but this guy isn't a botter. Input broadcast absolutely though.
---
Globby why do you even bother tryna explain stuff to people these days most gave up years ago
---
More devs doesn't really help, cases like this are all about time and experience
---
Put out a better video of your elite skills.
---
i cant imagine slyce managing to kill actual human beings tho v0v
---
Eve, sadly, attracts a very cancerous type of gamer. It attracts far better gamers as well, of course, but because Eve lets/encourages you to adopt a certain ruthless mentality in game, it appeals to those who enjoy such a thought process out of game as well.
---
TLDR a lot of utter dickheads play Eve.
---
No fit no interest. And dude, check your spelling...despription, vedmark... But nice fights though
---
Why would you hang your ships in no gravity though
---
Thanks Init for actually doing the right thing. :) 
---
same here
---
Problem is most of the renting empires won't kick them. Like Slyce with Slyce Pirates. They let exactly the same bots from the same rmt botting farm in after not even paying the rent just because it was a different name of a corp. 
---
The lack of the N in your abbreviation would cause a fair amount of confusion.
---
Kinetic drones will cover every sites. Don’t even bother switching drones because you will lose time and that extra click is honestly not worth it unless you are negaging a battleship at the start of a pocket.
---
or he's not and just a retard krabbing in fountain that did not realize a hunter came into system.
---
Humans rely on local as well. At least I do when krabbing.
---
it's a legit guy, and you can fuck off
---
That's what a botter would say
---
Someone dying does not make them a bot. Don't be silly.
---
i'm honestly surprised by the level of idiots that play eve
---
that doesn't mean i can't fix a few
---
How 'bout no ?
---

---
He may have lost his Super, but he still got his hands at least.
---
red alliance here i come
---
fastest way in distribution missions if you can find a station with 2/3 he can chain together in a hyperspatial indy it'll go by quick enough you just wanna grind out as many story line missions as you can
---
Its not your PC slowing down, its your brain from to much spod.
---
Nice to see that tri can actually form up for something
---
Zing 
---
Not really, takes a lot longer to get the same dps output and you actually have to tank a bit
---
not only local, the whole chatsystem is not working for me ...
---
Beginning with PvE and then into PvP
---
Oï mate !
---
I suppose your friend's account is still in Alpha state. That doesn't matter, as there is a very easy way to get access to L2 missions : training up the Connections skill, in the Social skill category. 
---
This skill does something very simple : "adjust" one's standings with every FRIENDLY corporation (pirate cartels are excluded). It is calculated using the following formula : 
---
Effective Standing = Unadjusted Standing + ((Maximum Possible Standing - Unadjusted Standing) \* Connections Modifier \* Connections Skill Level). Source is [EVE University (Connections)](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Social#Connections). Generally, getting this skill to Level II is enough to get access to every L2 mission in one faction. It's a 3x skill, so shouldn't take too long for the first levels.
---
Enjoy !
---
I think Max Singularity is no authority on EVE physics, but if CCP would rather be a spineless worm instead of reading their own scientific articles then who am I to disagree.
---
But, if we don't immediately jump to slurp on Max's dick and consider previously written lore then "slow warp" makes no sense because warp is achieved by creating a bubble around the ship that is stripped devoid of any particles and energy, allowing ships to exceed the speed of light. Warp is not propulsion itself, but a means to utilise thrusters more than "normal" space would allow.
---
However, be careful : alway check the tax on a POCO in Highsec. If it has been placed by a player corporation, tax for capsuleers with neutral standings toward the corporation could be set dumbfully high.
---
Worthless 
---
Considering how that group hunts local working or not really doesn’t matter.
---
Blue covert cyno lit in your last site after you warp off, scram strats bridge in and warp to your next site landing before you do. Most effective on non English speaking corps and those who refuse to stay in range of the umbrella.
---
Nothing of value was lost~~~
---
we used to, am not sure if this is coming back any time sooner! 
---
yeah i assumed that max singularity article was just a a what if thing as a lot off it doesn't make to much sense with the lore  and leaves a lot off gaps. like if you switch this thing on and you in the orbital path off a planet wouldn't the "pin"  fling you into the planet ?.
---
[Been doing it for a month now.](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98584538/)

Glad you enjoyed the video, and yeah I subbed because i enjoyed your recent content a lot &lt;3
---
Will do! o7
---
Thank you!
---
You saved that super pod from having to unplug the 'Yellowjacket' implant
---
Way to miss the point dumbass
---
Rorqs are good for players because it earns dank ISK/input. But if you're botting, who cares about how much input is required, a bot is putting the effort in for you.
---
In that case, instead of a rorq you could use three exhumer which earn ~1/3 of a rorqual each to get the same ISK/hour, but also only costs 1/7th the price (for 3 hulks). Of course your required APM goes up like 100x but whatever, that's the bot's problem.
---
The concept is nice, but there's not much motive for it for a lot of people except profit unfortunately, and that's easily achievable through FW missions. I really do wish ccp would work on lowsec but I don't think it'd happen any time soon.
---
I mean, if it is visible from decompiling the cache of the test server, then you can't expect people to know of it - and sell the item.
---
[removed]
---
Looks like downtime fixed it :(
---
HIRE DOWNTIME TO FIX YOUR BUGS PLS CCP
---
That just sounds like botting with more steps.
---
Alright, let's try to ask the good people of EVE for some recommendations.
---
Basically, I'm nearing the end of my training for a very good Rorqual pilot : T2 Industrial Core, PANIC, Capital Industrial Ship V, and Mining Director V + Mining Mindlink. I plan to use it with Hulks and defense nearby, plus multiple Athanors to keep dem rocks coming.
---
But now that I'm closer than every to fulfilling this little dream... I don't really know what to do when I'll be sleeping on that mineral pile. Since I'm living in a wormhole, getting built stuff out of it can be complicated (even if I have a DST alt), so basically I won't be able to make anything bigger than a Battleship, maybe some capital componants. What would be your recommendations ? 
---
Thanks in advance 
---
About damn time too
---
I don't see why it would. Warping through planets is nonsensical, but nothing should pull you towards planets more than gravity would.
---
Silvee miner isn’t a botter. If he was using hulks that fill in 1 cycle it’s definately a bot. You can literally see this guy tab to all accounts manually activating all
---
His lasers. He probably doesn’t have much else to do
---
All this pointless hostility gets pretty tiresome.
---
/u/Wolfsdragoon has been annoying for too long to make a recruitment video, so here it is. Enjoy and send me sweet reddit karma :)
---
every man a king
---
Send me any amount of ISK... oh nvm
---
I ate a damn good pizza with the family then ran some errands in the town.
---
Bands and song names for mine.  I have a pretty good memory for which is which.  Let's say "Reign in Blood" As an example.  Fast paced song, hits relatively hard,  and had an amazing live show to it.  I'd use this name for a heavy dps amarr ship for hit and run tactics. 
---
My tengus are usually called Obscura because the band makes me think a lot.  And that ship makes me simulate so many damn fittings.  From there,  if I find a fit I like,  I'll end up calling it one of Obscuras songs.  Variations will be certain lyrics of that song.  
---
This has actually kept my hangar pretty sorted and I can get into the needed ship quite fast
---
&gt; People are attracted to winning and having a good enough ticker tank that they can yolo their supers/titans around without fear. 
---
whats the problem with dreadbombs on those yoloing titans? cost after insurance is pretty low and even best rageforming entities in terms of time(shiturself) loses shit when medium-sized dreadbomb hits their fully tanked shit, its just matter that all whining entities are cowards not willing to do shit exept shitting on reddit  
---
Too bad last anti-snuff coalition didnt even try to fight snuff kek
---
Good, it makes the game less stagnant.
---
Don't be AFK if you're playing a game, that's fairly simple. Ratting's shitty. Maybe if it was intensive and there weren't all these bots pushing up inflation, it'd be more valuable

---
Further proof local was a mistake.
---
I will never understand hype videos about pressing f1
---
what a wonderfull game....mine all day evrrrday in same system heheheee
---
Pretty awesome fight, missing a few kills but does give a better idea of the teams...I think as pure blind politics are rather fluid!
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=2015&amp;b=8432130&amp;e=122&amp;t=sd
---
introduce 30 sec delay on local in null?
---
any info abt the cost yet? is it possible to get a digital version of this?
---
As you are asking alot of questions, let me start from the top down:  
---
&gt; where could I find ship fits that are up to date? 
---
For entry level ships EVE Uni still provides alot of good fits for starting out, or giving a genral direction. If you are not happy with them, I would suggest asking here on Reddit or on the official Forums for suggestions on fittings (if there is not yet an existing thread).   
---
&gt; could use couple pve fits for breacher and slasher.  
---
For PvE I wouldn't suggest starting out with Minmatar. Early ships tend to be more PvP focused, lack Drone capacity and sometimes tank. Caldari or Gallente is the "usual" route for PvE, though I might aswell link some fits that might work out for you. 
---
    [Slasher, Slasher PvE]
---
    
---
    Damage Control II
---
    Counterbalanced Compact Gyrostabilizer
---

---
    [Empty High slot]
---
    Small Projectile Ambit Extension I
---
    Small Projectile Collision Accelerator I
---
    Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I
---
This fit requires you to get close up to your enemy, as you are not Cap Stable you have to burst your Small Shield Booster and keep a bit of speed tanking going (orbit your target at close range). I tried to keep it cheap, if you have any skills for the T2 variants of certain Meta 4 modules you can switch them out.
---
The Breacher gave me a bit of a harder time, it is a bit more expensive but should also be enough to run L1 Securities without a problem (in this case it is a bit more dependent on your skills, micromanaging is required)

While I really have to repeat myself that I do not recommend these kind of ships for PvE. If you really want to continue with PvE on Minmatar, head for the Rupture or Stabber (both Cruiser Sized) to really help you out. 
---
Otherwise I can recommend the Caldari Cruiser Caracal and the Gallente Cruiser Vexor for PvE activities. (The Gallente Destroyer Algos can also work if flown right.)
---
Here a fit for the Vexor:
---
    [Vexor, Vexor PvE]
---
    Medium 'Accommodation' Vestment Reconstructer I
---
    AE-K Compact Drone Damage Amplifier
---
    Prototype Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane I
---
    10MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner
---
    Large Compact Pb-Acid Cap Battery
---
    Cap Recharger II
---
    Drone Link Augmentor I
---
    Medium Anti-Explosive Pump I
---
    Medium Auxiliary Nano Pump I
---
    Medium Capacitor Control Circuit I
---
    Hammerhead I x5
---
    Hobgoblin II x5
---
    Ogre I x2
---
DPS Drone group would be 2x Ogre 2x Hammerhead 1x Hobgoblin out at the same time (requires Drones V)
---
This fit is what I would call 'safe', it is of the 3 fits I linked the easiest and just requires you to switch on your Armor repairs and focus on your Drone management. Keep in mind that his is relatively low DPS for a Vexor, so feel free if you tank very well for the type of mission you are doing to refit the Prototype Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane with another Drone Damage Amplifier. Same can be done for the Damage Control. (Dropping tank for damage)
---
This maybe could be your long term training goal as you mentioned above :)
---
Now comming to your last question 
---
&gt; Also want to start on abyssal stuff, since those came out after I  stopped playing last time and im excited to run even entry level ones.  Are those doable in breacher/slasher entry type ships? 
---
The Abyssal Deadspace sites are for Cruiser Sized ships only (or as a new addition in 3 frigates, doing them with other people in frigates requires alot more cooridnation and I would not recommend it if you are just starting out again). Though they can be done with the right skills, even as an Alpha, I would suggest searching on YouTube for guides on that topic.
---
(Sorry that this post got so long :) )
---
Fly safe o7 
---
Yep, but if you lost ship like a 5h later after chat down you are retard,bot or completle retard or bot. After official confirm of chat down only idiot can try mine with rorq and later send petition about his low IQ. Sry if my english bad but i hope you understand what i mean. 
---
A much better report, is was genuinely more of a free for all than is made out in the original post. 
---
Still an amazing fight though.
---
pineapple?
---
Ha ha
---
I would suggest you should join a 0.0 Corp, you will learn very fast there and your time investment is much more worth than in high/low.   PVE content in 0.0 is Ratting ( 20-500 mil/h), Exploring, Mining in big fleets with Roqual's for a big mining boost. Also many Corp's do little pvp roams or small gate amps. 
---
I missed it due to wife agro but I’d imagine the fact it was a free for all made it more fun. 
---
Where does one go to kill bots ?
---
Thorax, blasters, mwd, scram, and hull tank.
---
He could also have been on comms, coordinating the inty fleet location with his friend. Or better yet, organising a defence.
---
Didn't you get the Memo that this week is Wormhole week in New Eden? It's not a bug, it a feature.
---
I'm not sure that a dead game is better than a stagnant game.
---
You know what? you have that no-local space . It's called JS and a very small fraction of the people live in there. ever wondered why CCP does not transform all the NS into JS ? Answer : it would screw every player and they would leave. You know I'm right and this argument of yours is stupid. On the opposite, if we removed local players would need more intel tools and thus, only bots could play the game because they would adapt to a safer playstyle.
---
"Don't be afk when playing a game". How about you mind your own business ? I am to set my goal and if that goal requires to farm AFK on 10 VNI then who are you to judge me ?
---
No local = no bots
---
More thr idea the pin he talks about is meant to stop you in space and the planets moving through space
---
Flair baiting?
---
I've helped my friend to finally get a tier X tank in WoT and he is as happy as a puppy. We can now play together we me using my JgdPzE100
---
And BTW you know very well that most ppl that die on local outage are NOT bots,because bots would go safe when local is down. Instead they are from players who did not realize the local was down, because they are players.
---
Lmao wot in current year. Still arty and skill rounds. Go play wt peasant. 
---
Well i only afk mine with my rorq when local is down, died one time and got replaced. Its not retarded to use the tools you are given
---
I don't play too much of it and it's fun to me, which is the only thing I care about. When I wanna do something tryhard-ish I can just log into Eve. Live and let live buddy
---
Nobody... just like you.
---
no, spicy this time with chilli
---
I judge you because you're the problem. If the only way you can make money in this game that's worth something is by not playing, then surely, SURELY even you can see that's retarded.
---
Wormholes are fun, most people don't live there because it's hard to live there with no gates and no asset safety. It's an entirely different world to nullsec and I fundamentally disagree that players, sat at their keyboards would be worse than bots.
---
You never know you may accidentally end up enjoying this shit game when some PvP comes your way 
---
But sure keep blaming everything else apart from the rampant problem for this game.
---
Bots cannot function without local, which is why so many kills happen when it breaks. Otherwise they have perfect intel and because it's automated they are almost impossible to catch.
---
As you state, people live in J space so it's clearly possible to live without local 
---
So maybe stop AFK ratting and help the game move away from tens of thousands of drone boats mindlessly spinning anomalies with noone behind the wheel.
---
It's cancerous and is also WHY you have to do it. Your isk becomes valueless because everyone else is doing it too.
---
Good point. I forgot it existed.
---
prove it or go fuck yourself.
---
Snuff are not killing low sec.  They maybe killing a certain part if it but that's not different to nullsec  or npc  region
---
Simple fact is dont  give them kills.move to a different low sec region. Starve their content.thw more you feed them the worse it gets.
---
I do think CCP need to extend FW to ALL low sec too to spread it out.
---
You have places like aridia which is 99% low sec yet it's completely dead.. shit need to change.
---
I think Stargates should be removed too...or have more entrances to systems rather than choke points that clearly lead to highsec hubs. Grr  so much to do
---
Oh lol. Slyce Pirates having bots. Much changed in 8 months after I left. Sad they went that way.
---
World of warships is just as casual and just more enjoyable due to lack of gay bullshit in the game like gold rounds or arty.
---
Wows is great, easy to understand mechanics diverse play style between ships. WT ships is pretty good when you get over being bombed by planes every 2 minutes.
---
Thanks a lot for answering pretty much all I had asked!
---
I have Gallente character which I played previously and can fly Vexor and has Drone V, etc. Just thought that Id try something different this time. Although I still might try it so thank you! 
---
I have a mind to try out PvP but I'll join a corp for that like other comments suggested. 
---
Too bad that Ill have to wait till trying abyssal deadspace sites, but at least Ill have something to train for then. Ill go as Alpha for Rupture/Stabber and see where I'm at in a month. If im still here, ill go Omega.
---
Thanks for your answers once again! o7
---
Those people who use zkb as a proof are just complete morons.
---
because otherwise a huge part of the players leave and you find yourself on a dead game.
---
You can always x up for a roam in cheap frig/cruisers
---
Yup, lots of very badly fit exhumers to find in hisec. No tank, wrong (faction) modules etc..
---
Fits of around 700m, i dont understand those people....
---
They have a direct counter though, and you see them coming. I masturbate to my des moine after i get clear skies for wiping 40 planes in 10 sec
---
Hoboleaks bird gets the worm.
---
Too bad your leadership doesn't lol
---
Yeah it's bannable for sure.
---
I love the idea of 0 local, but then again cynos exist. Cynos make having zero local really unbalanced. Id settle for delayed local for sure.
---
I'd probably scan down a wormhole, then hop into a shuttle and fly it in there. Just let it go. Let it go.
---
True for any sec
---
Voice comms and discord my dude
---
Where winning Eve is suddenly winning Eve
---
People constantly forget that nullsec is as safe as you make it to.            
---
**Before groups started to defend their area for years gang moving in to some region made 95% of people to dock**                    
---
During this time people on reddit where constantly saying :             
---
* CCP force ratters to fight with us              
---
* Make them stay on spots and not run away           
---
* Create objectives - like destructible system upgrades that gangs can attack forcing defenders to undock and fight them            
---
Well CCP did this ( rorquals ) and at the same time people started to create the various defensive fleets what lead us to current situation.           
---
But those blobs are killing my 5 man gang moving in some null space .... well i can say that if those 5 people is getting killed by formed up defensive fleet that **other people put in work to create and maintain** they have all right to do it.                
---
Edgy bro
---
I grew tired of mining and trading because I realised that I was chasing ISK purely for the sake of chasing ISK. I joined FW, and now I don't care about anything in the game anymore. Sure, I get a little excitement chasing people down and moving in to attack, but once a fight has started, the excitement disappears and I go back to feeling indifferent. Now that I don't care about my ships, I don't care about the game. I've considered a lot of in-game activities, but nothing makes me think, "Wow! That's awesome! I'm going to do that."
---
In a safespot in Jita, floating in hauler of choice amid billions in jettisoned courier packages that there'd never be time to deliver to the far-flung destinations on their labels.
---
Make local opt-in, then have certain conditions that either force the player into local or alert everyone in system.
---
Open a cyno? Everyone knows.
---
Fire a DD? Everyone knows.

TIKLE renter bots. Oh lol. They really going that direction, eh?

This comment should be stickied to the sidebar on the right.

"The sandbox game", aka "Exactly what I want the game to be and never what you want the game to be". 
---
" however it has opened up new playstyles " No it doesn't. It just superpowers the hunters. Hunters only have to press D-Scan a few times ( when jumping in and a few passing through ). Anyone else has to mash it the entire time they are doing something until their fingers fall off or they dock up.
---

---
BUT THE MITTANI!
---
Well i disagree with delayed local - for a simple reason - **i have RL and having constantly spam dscan is not something enjyoable for me and most of the players**       
---
Look at this from a very simple perspective - if most of the players wanted to play a game like eve without something like local - WH space would be place where most players are ... yet it is opposite.           
---
EvE is a game and a product at the same time.     
---
If CCP will make less enjoyable - they will lose players, and by losing players they will lose customers.            
---
just make local have a 2min delay, you will still have the social aspect of local which was CCPs initial intention without making it a op intel tool.
---
I like what you're saying. If a player flies too cheap, then losses mean very little. I think it helps when losing a ship results in an "oh shit!" moment, not a "meh" moment.
---

^(Definitely not a pyramid scheme)
---
If he was a player he wouldn't even be going out in space when the local is broken. 
---
It's possible to do something in-between, we don't need to go full out "REMOVE LOCAL EVERYWHERE" 
---
A 5-10s delay on local when jumping in would alone be quite significant.
---
Yes
---
a pizza with chilli on it?
---
I think it's the prospect of constant hole scanning, lack of asset safety and logistic concerns that keep the majority of people out of wormholes. No local, (along with smaller fleets and access to different regions at the drop of a hat) are the other side of the coin that makes WH's attractive in the first place
---
Good multiboxes wouldn't be dying. Maybe that's why the good ones dont show up.
---
"if most of the players wanted to play a game like eve without something like local"
---
So are you going to try and attribute wormholes unpopularity solely on it being without local? It's a lot more then that a lot of players don't want to scan basically the equivalent to every gate just to be able to warp to it. Some people don't want to roll holes to krab etc etc it goes on and on.
---
It's just local that keeps the majority our of wspace. It's more work and can work for some casual players but not the majority and that's what keeps them out of it.
---
It's weird eve a "hardcore" mmo mainly filled with casual players who want to afk the game :shrug:
---
I am not the problem. YOU are, because YOU want the game to change to adapt to YOUR way of playing.
---
"it's hard to live there with no gate and no asset safety". I know people who live there and it's not hard. It's tedious, but it's not hard to close all exits before farming your anoms in dual dreads. People say it's even easy to bot them … 
---
"Bots cannot function without local". No. The correct sentence is "The bots I think of don't work without local ATM". Yet they can easily be changed, and just because you did not notice the bots that work without local (because you could not catch them ?) does not mean they don't exist. This is just a dumb argument. "RADAR can't detect stealth planes so there is no stealth plane".
---
"But sure keep blaming everything else apart from the rampant problem for this game." The rampant problem of this game is your stupidity. I blame the stupidity of eve players who want so much to be right that they don't realize how absurd their argument is. Bots are an issue among so many, and all your "solution" would make the problem even worse and would actually hurt the game more than help it. 
---
You mean with goons composing 75% of the fleet? The rest of us are not impressed
---
In short, it's in the game, local, fleet, intel and any other channel you can think of is dead and with them, any normal way of communicating danger, is gone.  
---
CCP has not deliberately removed chats but it has broken to the point where it is just not working and i know you people who would like to get local removed are all over this and using it as a legitimate opportunity to get extra easy kills when in fact you are abusing a broken mechanic to do so as it is.  
---
Local is not gone by intent. it's BROKEN and until you can convince CCP to take it away all together you're just abusing a glitch.  
---
Why let people have such and easy time getting kills?  
---
Comments like your's make me wonder who the risk averse people are.
---
Same here. In Mint and Fedora 29, with Lutris, I find that that EVE runs flawless with Wine (option 2).
---
Which whining/coward entity in LS, within range of snuff, do you think should be dropping more dreadbombs on their titans? Cause i've seen plenty of people drop dreads on yoloing snuff supers.  Also which anti-snuff coalition are you talking about?
---
yes
---
Delayed local will still mean near2 would work for you, if the delay is as long as the gate cloak.
---
About the d-scan thing, who woulda thought pressing V would be so hard?
---
Ok we will all stop playing the game because bots are smarter than people.
---
Have fun friend, you're wrong but you're also extremely defensive so I suspect you have a vested interest in the status quo so I'm not going to bother since nothing changes anyway.
---
I think you should not be in local for as long as your gate cloak lasts.
---
Can't think of a reason why this would be bad
---
Hate to break it to you, but somebody's name is gonna be on the new Athanor
---
can i get a pic of it? 
---
Is that literally Frat's botting alliance?
---
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll still be there in a year ::CCP::
---
wondering if you ever saw someone arguing botting is not a problem. Legitimately curious. 
---
I'd gate each of my capitals as close to NY6-FH as I could before dying.   
---
NY6 was my introduction to null, and when I really started playing this game. Only fitting to bring what I've grown into back home
---
&gt;You never know you may accidentally end up enjoying this shit game when some PvP comes your way
---
Everyone enjoys being active at the keyboard during EVE Online's amazing, dynamic PvE experiences, and everyone enjoys having some PvP come their way during krab o'clock. That's why Faction Warfare worked out so incredibly well.
---
Hardcore PvP games tend to die miserably. Casuals are what keep games alive. They don't get enough recognition for it. 
---
If it's anything like their other UI updates, it'll be even worse after they iterate on it.  If that's even possible.
---
Not that it's a change I endorse, but there's literally thousands of WH'ers... I don't get what you're asking
---
This would imply CCP actually makes good choices.  Past few years have shown this to be debatable at best.
---
Is the only difference between WH and K-space local?
---
Awesome fight,
---
Thanks for bringing the content,
---
We will return the favor soon :)
---
CCP doesn't "get it" when it comes to why new players don't stay.  They've re-made the NPE like 10 times in the last few years, because they somehow think making the first hour of the game completely different than the actual game is going to keep players.  
---
Nobody except them seems to be surprised that it doesn't make any fucking difference long-term, and they don't touch the things that ACTUALLY cause people to quit.
---
&gt;They just change the bot a bit to account for more losses overall
---
No need, just copy and paste the d-scan code from Faction War bots, and adjust the warp out threshold a bit.
---
Then why remove ALL chat channels, and not only local. CCP screwed up, not on purpose. But the bot fallout is obviously hilarious and nice content.
---
Goons will be the first to perish from removed local...beware of what you wish for...
---
Even before all of this snuff relentlessly dropped caps on random nobodies all over lowsec, theres a reason half of FW just ignore fighting you guys and have for years, its not worth the hassle. Stop pretending this has nothing to do with snuff, you guys would rather "win" and be bored than lose a fight every now and then but enjoy it.
---
/r/bois has some interesting connections
---
Snuff kinda turned into the bogeyman for any super/titan pilot moving thru lowsec and even got bolder dreadbombing in m-o a month ago. Usually they wont drop supers near panfam umbrella unless backed by CFC super fleet.
---
dude you said somethings that are stupid. And now you say that if I don't agree with you, then I have a vested interest. Sorry this is just stupid rant "I am right and if you don't agree then you are wrong". How old are you ?
---
You said stupid things. How do you even know that all the bots require local to work ? How do you know none of them uses dscan to leave when there are tackling ships on it ? You DON'T.
---
It's not about "stop playing the game because bots are smarter than people and will always have advantages." . It's about looking at things are they are, not at how you imagine them. And as they are, you have no idea what effect it would have on bots, and very likely after a reduction they would become much harder to detect and adapt to the non-local system ; however we all KNOW that removal of local would hurt enough legit players to make it worse in the long term that what you affirm.
---
But yeah, definitely, bots will always have advantages. That's because they are created this way.
---
&gt;legitimate players don't 'need' anything
---
Not true. They need a ship, some guns on it, and some ammo. Maybe I never saw the draw of living in nul, but... why is this the  mechanic that people get bent about. Local is a defensive tool, and if you are *relying* on defensive tools, you aren't being aggressive enough. Be the hunter - change my mind
---
I find that unlikely. Unless he is really unaware. 
---
What I want to know is why CCP did not release a statement until [2 hours after it was fixed](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/ongoing-chat-issues/133215).
---
It may be Sunday but if you run a MMORPG where tens of thousands of players are online at any given moment, you need to be able to communicate when these things happen, 24/7.
---
Local should be an ihub upgrade. One that costs serious ISK to maintain. 
---
NPC null has local built in, providing a stepping stone from low -&gt; null.
---
What are you talking about?
---
&gt;ahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahaahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
should probably aim for a more kitey fits this will allow you disengage if enemies tend to get blobby or get enthusiastic qith cynos. Stabber would be a good choice for t1 from minmatar. Nano rail fit thorax could do it as well. 
---
keep in mind your foreboding any notion of a tank so if you get scrammed/webbed its game over. but who cares its just a t1 cruiser.
---
A bit more isk and sp but a solo fast locking svipul on a main null sec trade route is a great way to piss off a bunch of ceptors who are traveling but failed to get align to 1.9sec.
---
haha lol what a quirky streamer!!!!!!!!! hahaha
---
Didn't show up to any CTA's. I'm a renter. So it was only jolly ISK making here.
---
The reason I don’t use windows is the last time I did was xp. I have used Linux since then because it makes you think and you truly understand your computer. 
---
For me working out how to make Linux do it is more fun then just doing it. 
---
Linux runs most of the world and is safe, Windows is made for people not like me. But I can see why some people need windows.
---
Spoken like the goon you are. 
---
Use google 
---
I have hunted bots, so I absolutely know that dscan is not as useful a tool as local. Have you tried? Do you know how hard it is to catch bots? Even with log off traps, or blue scouts? Local is an absolutely ridiculous piece of free information. They know you're in system before you do, and even the slowest aligning battleships can align and get out before you can get hyperspatial tackle ships on grid.
---
Bots will be worse off without local, I can categorically state it. What, exactly, do you see as the downsides of not having local? All you've done is say "it will hurt the game" but given zero sources or even anecdotes to this. Yes it would take time to adjust but maybe, just maybe, the game needs a little more risk given we have tens of thousands of people mining in utter safety, or spinning VNIs with Intel channels covering entire regions.
---
Perhaps, just perhaps, you're wrong and you're scared that the game might make it harder for you. Once upon a time, that was what Eve strived for. Nowadays it's simply a safe haven for krabs.
---
Lots of groups still, brave newbies, horde, and others l]taking in new players, or non skilled. Dont wurry or overthink it. Go for it, fail, learn and move on
---
and then, those people who live in wh don't need the local. Are you telling me all the KS players are bots ?
---
I have a feeling I need to change my laptop then come back to this. I’ve been looking for a reason to get a new toy
---
You just mostly descriped w-space!
---
The Weekend Warriors are recruiting, our name is really who we are, plenty of activity during the week but larger more organized fleets during the week. Since we have fewer larger fleets we aim to take the good fights we can get. Normally our fleets are 25-30 actual dudes, what you do in fleet with us will matter. 
---
Deoends what you like and want mate. If u like stacking isk, and spreadsheet fetisjsm then thats cool too. Some people love building, others trading, or mining. Some do it to avoid paying for eve, others to support their pvp or support their allaince. What matters its satisfying for you. Mist null corps offer srp which makes u pvp almost for free. So go, die, and repeat. Meanwhike see if you stil liek your mining, or think fuck it, and never look back. If anything, eve is a sandbox and you decide what you liek to do. YOU
---
Thanks for sharing that! It's awesome to hear someone else had the same experiences as I did  and enjoyed them just as much.
---
While those have been the most memorable, there were certainly many other fleets and fights, big and small that made this year excellent. And it was great to share them with people like you and everyone else in Brave!
---
Ok, I'm still pretty green to Eve and I'm pretty vague on botting, how does removing local impact them?
---
implying goons need another reason to shoot horde...
---
That was a while ago, but there's a good possibility of that. One of my corpmates was showing up in every system, he's omnipresent haha.
---
Eve is a hardcore mmo
---
Don't ask me to hit a button all intel should be broadcasted to me btw
---
&gt; What, exactly, do you see as the downsides of not having local?
---
The exact same thing you just said : legit players rely on local to avoid losses. If they lose too much resources in an activity, they will stop it. If they can't play in NS without losing their ships too often, then they will stop playing in NS. And some of them will just not have fun going back to another way of playing, because of many possible reasons (including but not limited to lack of trust in CCP to start building a sandcastle, too many things to move, friends not willing, they wanted to do something else and took the occasion ).
---
And now, the bots that adapt to spam dscan often and rely on scouts on gates, will be at an even better advantage than the players who will be more error prone.
---
So "remove local" is actually reducing the number of legit players in NS AND increasing the advantage that bots will have over legit players in NS. You will find even less bots that you can catch, and you will find a lot less players that you can catch. So yes, you are hurting yourself.
---
The blob you are in as you put it, is merely an enabler, imagine having a goal and the ability to ping three thousand players to come fly for you.
---
Vvvvvvvvvvvvvv
---
There's your tip for Intel,  good luck man. 
---
muh near2 isnt working anymore plz help Q\_Q
---
punch up
---
I honestly think this event terrified EVERYONE into a station.
---
I was flying an alpha mining toon when it happened. 
---
It was me, and me alone on an uncommon ore anomaly and I sucked it dry in a venture over 6 hours. The rats gave good loot too!
---
Don't do it all the time, but... DO IT AGAIN,.... DO IT AGAIN!
---
The bots AND the afk ratters bit the bullet hard. Not gonna lie, yesterday was one of the most fun roams I ever had.
---
local instantly tells you who is and who isn't in a system
---
if a hostile appears, they can dock up
---
this also has the side effect of players also watching local and instantly knowing when a hostile appears in local (sometimes through 3rd party apps) and disengaging and avoiding all pvp
---
&gt;Not true. They need a ship, some guns on it, and some ammo.
---
this isn't true, lots of players have played well without ever undocking
---
Nullsec is already dead. You go roaming and everyone docks up due to intel channels when you're 5 jumps out.
---
Removing local doesn't hurt people as much as it hurts bots, but either way, safety should never be guaranteed.
---
If you think I'd be hurting myself then why not let me make my mistake? Your assumptions are wild and unproven.
---
Everyone relies on local, and yet it's also easily possible to live without it as you have mentioned with wormholes. That just doesn't compute. It just sounds like you assume nobody is ever willing to adapt or change which is false.
---
I'm not saying you're ever going to rid botting entirely but by making it as hard as possible for bots to do their job by removing a lot of the cues that they use it disincentivises the users if they have to suddenly pay for 3-4 more accounts just to run the botting accounts.
---
Anyway you go back to living in your happy little world where this game has no problems and that the idea that trying to change anything is anathema to progress.
---
Have fun there.
---
PERFECTLY TIMED GNOME XDXD

Most VNI's are most likely not bots.  They are stupid easy to afk without using any programs (less than 1min an hour work).
---
VNI's dieing does not mean they are bots, probably just afk like VNI's do.  More than likely intel programs stopped working which are legal.
---
It's funny cause none of the ship in that BR got killed by the revelation except the Cyno.
---
Wich was killed by a cap guns rev ...
---
No local. . . Best local
---
snuff so scary that guy decided to commit reddit sudoku instead continue the conversation...
---
Not really, just one feature of wspace.  For example, I am not suggesting you need to scan down your gates, or that entry and exits have a max carrying capacity or that asset safety ceases to apply, etc...
---
Looks like I was overthinking it, like them using it to somehow physically coordinate ships via some method I didn't know. Not the far simpler "ah hell, red".
---
I know a risk averse tengu pilot when I see one, see you around son.
---
True that! I think I've reached tier VIII there at some point. Should probably give it another try :)
---
sleeping.
---
CCP: Sorry we can't seem to get chat fixed, ever. But we got some new reskins of skins for 695 plex!
---
People would use cloaked ships to tackle so dscan would be useless anyway. The point is it would cause a shift to active defense where you need to hunt down gangs in your space to keep things safe. 
---
such helpfull community
---
I’m in Bluewaffe, one of the WKEND corps. I can truthfully say that 90% of our fleets are not just about pressing F1 🚀  ....don’t believe me, bring some friends to pew 👍
---
In order for snuff to make money they need to clear content around there area by dropping supers and titans. What does any null bloc do when there rorqs get tackled or there ratting carriers/supers get harassed? They all drop there supers and titans. 
---
Some do you scripts to detect hostiles - usually a "scout" is posted in system(s) x jumps out, using a third party local scanner, this then pings the bots to GTFO when reds are detected.
---
I mean if you enjoy using cli than Linux is great, and a flavor of it is my obvious go to for server use. But if you're using Linux with a desktop you're just a tryhard windows hater.

You don't imagine how many times i was tempted to move StainGuy to some goon corp just to annoy NCPL even more.          
---
Wile i got invites few times from Ascee ... like they recruit from jita local you know ... i always declined.            
---
But i am tempted to do it as hell. 
---
Jesus r/eve has gone down hill
---
oh, so i should macro spam d scan nonstop while rorq mining in case local breaks? good to know
---
Yeah but 1am Sunday is going to have a skeleton crew, most likely a couple dudes on call and that's it. Allowing time for them to get word something's broken, access stuff and verify, try to fix it, get that it's a downtime-required fix and contact PR types who are probably asleep and don't see it until morning... What are they gonna tweet a couple of hours before downtime? "Yeah we know it's down" at that point would just wind folk up; even if they promised a fix timescale, the hours of people raging wouldn't allow the annoyed players to hear it, and it'd just be reams of vitriolic responses.
---
Honestly? From a PR standpoint, a few folks whining "yeah, they fixed it, but they didn't tell us it'd be fixed beforehand" looks waaaaay better than 5 hours of players screaming, bearing in mind responses to official sources will be easier found than random no-rep-response r/Eve threads.
---
was working when i started mining. it broke and since i was in the same system, it looked exactly like it wasn't broke
---
Hurr Durr I lost my ship because I'm too lazy to hit dscan. 
---
560 VNI's exploded in the last 12 hours, roughly 20k online consistently during this time. Throw in the other VNI's not caught, the Super bots, the Indy bots, the FW bots, all the other bots...
---
What percentage are we realistically looking at for bots in this game?
---
This is true but also lets be honest nuking local lists wouldn’t be the worst change CCP ever made
---
Razor still exists??

RR dreads Died quickly and in the haste we didnt anticipate 120 Ishtars landing on grid :D 
---
We had 26 machs and logi to 110 ishtars and their logi. 
---
We started losing machs and evaced. 
---
Quite a few Tri dreads moonwalked.
---
Sounds like Thera would be the perfect place for that
---
No it is both - like living in a WH you cannot take 2-3 day break due to RL
---
No fuck Thera
---
&gt; Removing local doesn't hurt people as much as it hurts bots, but either way, safety should never be guaranteed.
---
Yes it does.
---
local is an automated intel tool. Remove it and bots can still make automated intel tools using scouts, while human players can't.
---
&gt; If you think I'd be hurting myself then why not let me make my mistake? 
---
Because you are a greedy selfsish who does not mind hurting the game for personal reasons. Because I think that bots are a bad thing and I know your idea would actually give them more advantage against legit players.
---
&gt; It just sounds like you assume nobody is ever willing to adapt or change which is false.
---
I said the opposite, people will adapt - by leaving the game.
---
You keep affirming it won't hurt the game, but THIS is an assumption "wild and unproven".
---
This is what I want to know
---
I think you replied to the wrong person. I don't even rat for my isk...
---
We all know that you have more chars than just StainGuy ;)
---
Went mining without getting dropped or interrupted! Meant it was a little harder to play with spreadsheets on the other screen having to ping the void on D-scan on the regular, but so much better than freaking out every time some lifetime-newbie-corper jumps in and having to dock until they jump out having never come anywhere near us because it was just a pass-through.
---
I'm actually a little disappointed they fixed it. Oh well, back to paranoia...
---
#Fuckmark
---
However, most of the ones that tried to rat without local probably were. 
---
Unless they were just counting on having CCP reimburse it
---
And then they'll be back with the isk or rmt they already smuggled out to buy skill injectors to be back in their botting fits on new accounts :(
---
I'd be fine with that, I just think it would be too easy. 90% of my gameplay in EVE is hunting, 10s would go a very long way towards catching someone. 
---
It would also significantly buff systems where the bulk of the anomalies are outside gate range, so you'd have to warp (and break gate cloak) to even start d-scanning.
---
Mostly about level of commitment - like wife + kids will limit your possible ingame commitment by like 95%. 
---
I get your point, but it looks extremely unprofessional. The issue was fixed at downtime, for all we know due to some system being rebooted automatically. They update us two hours _after that_.
---
It really makes it seem like they didn't even have a skeleton crew, like they all just go home and leave the game to its own over the weekend. Come back to a bunch of angry posts after lunch and seeing the issue was already fixed.
---
All major games acknowledge issues of this severity even if they cannot fix them instantly. It's just standard practice, and not doing it just makes the whole situation look extra stupid.
---
Pretty much.
---
Stay away from t1 laser ammo.
---
Also back when i was new i found some ships where better than ammo. Ventures, tristans, tornados and catalysts. Rigs where even better
---
Big thing though is to look on contracts. You want to buy a limited run BPC thats already reserched
---
&gt; i have RL and having constantly spam dscan is not something enjyoable for me
---
Yet spamming /r/eve is acceptable
---
As with all f2p games, it depends, some of it is f2p.
---
A lot of corps takes low skilled people, you will have more fun in a smaller group though 
---
CCP should not be crippling one of the most critical features of Eve just so Mr Snuffed Man can go on some quixotic quest to kill bots, as if your efforts would have any meaningful impact to begin with.
---
It is not your responsibility to deal with botters, the best you can do is tell CCP that you are displeased with the botting and try not to give CCP any bad ideas, like removing local.
---
What makes local a critical feature, you ask?
---
It makes it possible to do stuff in null without rolling the dice to not get 100 bombers dropped on your head. As long as you adhere to proper procedure and remain vigilant you can go out ratting or mining and be confident that you aren't going to lose your ship.
---
Open world PvP is something a lot of MMOs struggle with because it tends to lead to make it impossible to play the game without getting helplessly ganked all the time. Why would you pay 15bux/month just to be abused? Look at what happened to Ultima Online, the ganking as so bad that they bled subscribers and had to take drastic action, which led to PvE servers.
---
Eve solves the problem, albeit accidentally, by first not requiring you to be in a particular place to advance and second having local chat so you can evade baddies if you are playing your cards correctly.  
---
This is not to say that local chat is some brilliant gem of game design, its hardly congruent with the space-submarine-molasses-simulator we call Eve.
---
Its just that every time someone post a detailed idea of how intel in general can be overhauled for the benefit of everyone you get legions of moronic purists and greedy smallgangers shouting it down.  
---
With the Eve community and CCP being what they are, the best that can be done is let local remain as it has been for many years.
---
Is there any way to preview manufacturing, invention, etc. in the industry window for a particular station or structure? There is a search button at the top right of the industry window, but I can never select anything. For example, if I'm in Jita and want to see the component amounts required for 1 run of a particular item in a specific null sec structure, how would I do that?
---
I would favor kitey for the caracal. 2 BCS, 2 nanofibres, range and speed rigs, cap booster, LSE, invulnerability, point and MWD
---
Well i don't do it every 3 seconds, and you need to do it with dscan. 
---
like many, many more           
---
Some in goons, some in test, some in PH, some in NC - i don't have any in PL now as my corp left PL.             
---
More like 10 guys in roaming ships complaining that 60-200 man defensive fleets is not allowing them to kill stuff. 
---
Doesn't matter to me if local works or not. But it is a confidence killer in investing in a game via a sub when they can't fix it or just can't drop it and say "we dropped it, don't need it". For CCP to say they are working to fix it and might roll it back 9 months after they changed it is not confidence inspiring. They talk of new player retention a lot lately. New players ask about it and get "it's been borked for 9 months" really drives new players to sub.
---
same, around 1 out of 20 sbikoki.
---
Yet, the zazz is blitzable : kill the solar panel becasue it sucks, kill zor, kill the target, loot zor, GTFO.
---
Pretty sure those goons did the work to get them!
---
"forgets" you mean they intentionally continue to bot since everything gets replaced by CCP?
---
Well majority of players is kind of safe ... unless CCP as company will get suicidal then we could expect delayed or no local in K space. 
---
I make 500 million ISK/day so ISK isn't really an issue. However, if I have a 50m cruiser, I'm sorta bleeding ISK :P 
---
Hard no, but at the same time unfun and not something majority players want to do. 
---
&gt; Dont give them kills
---
Blueballs or helldunks????
---
My man!! /s
---
Minmaxing
---
I'd bet a lot of money that more people have left the game due to lack of content from risk averse scrubs and super proliferation than any amount of no local would cause. 
---
https://imgflip.com/i/2r14fy
---
Well it changed since they allowed Chinese alt corps in. They've been an issue since day one. Don't worry we are killing them on our own 
---
People forget that nullsec is dangerous as hell if there is no one coming to help you.          
---
Nullsec is also dangerous if you have no idea what to do and how to act in certain situations.          
---
Which is why wormhole pvp is so dangerous. You have to keep a very close eye on dscan (which if they are cloaked won't help) since there is no local.
---
Good ol Bull Nig
---
That one dude shitting on a bunch of bots happens to also be a dirty Australian named u/anusmilk
---
Look at all those horde VNIs.
---
proposed event : every ship has 1hp one hour per day, at random.
---
Why do you think people insta bash your citadel and plan to do hole control to evict you because they see a [0] on your structure.
---
I'm sorry to break it to you but that doesn't really happen as long as your structure is fueled no one really fucks with it unless you piss someone off for the most part.
---
I've in some small corp(4-5 dudes) Even with 6 LP citadels in their people are reluctant to shoot it.  Though we keep our main ones full.
---
You can take a break in wormhole space I just wouldn't have ALL your assets in there just in case. You would have to have terrible luck to get a eviction the second your afk for a few days because of irl.
---
So many horde vni’s
---
Good guys win again
---
everyone who krabs is a bot, if you ever did the tutorial missions congrats you are a bot
---
This should be event, not a bug. 
---
This should be event, not a bug.
---
This should be an event, not a bug.
---
yeah you can get "a lot of money" from the epic soe.
---
so basically you can bet something worthless for things that can't be checked, especially since one of them did not happen yet.
---
I guess that's the best argument you are able to make.
---
Yet you also missing other point here.       
---
If i login and have 15minutes to do something i will not waste this time to scan some system just to find out that there is no one there.              
---
Like WTF.          
---
Now if i know that i have some time i login some alt, make few jumps in PH space and i kill someone or get killed by other hunters.             
---
This is EVE and not some fucking probing 23/7 to find someone that potentially can give you fight.         
---
EVE should offer more variety of gameplay types and not less.            
---
For me CCP should create Null or Lowsec areas where you cannot light ANY cyno.     
---
Imagine yourself what you could do in terms of gamplay, gang compositions without imminent hotdrop incoming.     
---
&gt;wondering if you ever saw someone arguing botting is not a problem. Legitimately curious.
---
Nullsec bots aint problem at all, local chat is. Region wide intelligence that is never wrong unless servers aint working correctly ... just no. You do want all those unmanned VNIs, Gilas and even supers undocked, dont you? The problem is you can't catch them. IMHO local should be renamed to constellation or even region wide and they should implement salt related rp items. 
---
Most of the alpha VNIs ratting in KWG sov without local are bots no doubt
---
I hope botters will be banned if they are dumb enough to petition these losses
---
We moved away from them in lowsec, yet they still followed and came to our events because we generated content.
---
Blood for the blood God! Skulls for the skull throne!

---

---
Yeah, I get where you're coming from. 
---
Although with database issues, it's generally not as simple as turning it off and on again, and most fixes do require it to be fully offlined to implement. There were a few points after 4am or do where they seemed to be trying live fixes (where you get "attempting to join channel" spam or the player channel windows come back empty or with partial access but Local stays dead), but with no resolution. So I do believe there were at least on-call staff poking and growling at it while mainlining coffee. Thing is, the guy that does that is not the guy you want managing your Twitter account, and I doubt given the size of CCP they have on-call Social Media bodies.
---
With the way the live-fix attempts were failing, and confirming it to be a database issue, it would have required a change during the downtime, which would work on onlining, but could suffer the same issue and die an hour later...at which point it's next downtime or an emergency downtime - possibly several - to get it right. Can you imagine if it had replicated an hour after downtime, after promising a fix? I wouldn't blame them for being shy of guaranteeing a fix given that possibility, and media-friendly staff were probably scripting responses for if there had to be unscheduled maintenance, or no update until 'possibly' next downtime, while the code-wranglers babysat the database watching for a change that'd cascade.
---
Think there was much coffee and stress, and little sleep, so I'm happy to cut them some slack on the communication front. But you are correct, that best practice dictates someone should have been the sacrificial lamb and kept players informed, even if it could only be wishy-washy 'hopefully' updates.
---
Uh-oh imbor let something through his 3-F gate camp and no one was camping YW.
---
Lols
---
I mean I agree with that other point I don't really find it wrong depending on the size of the group your in they might be ok with you not scanning (jk scum)
---
Wormhole space is obviously a lot more commit time wise. If I wanted to log in a super krab sure I can do that and get off in 30-45 minutes. Not really the same with wspace.
---
I'm not saying that wspace isn't more time consuming saying you cannot take a break for 2-3 days is kinda spooking people away for no reason. I would agree if you had to go for a extended amount of time to move a majority of the assets out atleast
---
Eve has slowly been losing a variety of play-styles with the changes they have made.I don't blame them more trying to please the majority of eve though.
---
I don't think cynos are the problem themselve but capital balance but that is another discussion. Atleast under the current balance that type of space would be fun. 
---
It's almost like removing local *without announcing it* cures the problem, while also killing active players.
---
Then when the change goes permanent, the bots just start using d-scan like FW bots, or use alpha gate bots, and get out just fine, while players who lack the pure mindless attention of computers just die, thus giving bots even more of an advantage.
---
Where is my low sec gate for Stain?
---
You can't really assume this is a good indicator of VNI botting. There are a lot of players with really bad habits because of tools like near, or who don't know how to play in a local free environment (dscanning, assuming there are cloaky ships around, etc.) I bet there are several, run of the mill, 90% afk multiboxing VNI players still trying to do their usual.
---
F2p has rather crippling restrictions but you can keep a subscription going at no cost if you recycle incoming skillpoints into injectors, sell them and buy plexes for the subscription.
---
In other words, you can subscribe your account for free, but you don't gain any skillpoints while subscribed. You can still get additional skillpoints by grinding, like a traditional MMO.
---
lol 
---
Looks like you have a 64bit only wine but trying to run a 32bit application (EVE Online).
---
You need either a 32bit wine or a multilib wine so the 64bit wine can also provide the 32bit libs.
---
CCP could find all these bots with a 5 minute database query but they don't because the bots pay a subscription same as you or I and they cannot afford to lose that many paying accounts.
---
Change my mind.
---
Yeah noticed the names. Guess they are desperate for tax iskies.
---
Dude. You don't get a perm ban if there isn't evidence against you.
---
Just take the L.  You did something wrong and got caught. He's not the nicest GM in the game but he knows how to do his job.
---
Learn you lesson and stop breaking the rules. 
---
Are you saying your argument is more valid than mine even though it's equally as baseless? 
---
Maybe have it offline so they can transfer settings to the new(old) system?
---
They’ve known about these issues for months.  It’s clear, at this point, that they don’t care to fix the problem.

Tbh OP, ive been concidering coming back solely for bot hunting, because the most fun I had before I quit was ganking afk ratters and this post is getting me a lot more interested. It looks to me like Id have a target rich environment 
---
A lot of new alpha players have been enjoying day-tripping in to WHs and low/nullsec to find relic and data sites. It doesn't take much to get in to SP wise to be good at, but a mild amount to be great at. I have pulled up to 100 mil out of a relic site. Average seems to be ~40 mil a site if you loot all the cans.
---
Another option is to train in to a Vexor Navy Issue and do nullsec anioms.
---
I personally think that players who are doing their solo mission thing, or grinding the same nullsec aniom over and over, tend to get burnt out. it just isn't exciting over the long term. I would find a corp that can teach and mentor you. A group you can fly and adventure with. There are many.
---
Also, PvE fits tend to be repair fits, not buffer fit. An armor rep will make it so you can stay on field longer.
---
They both have the same drone damage bonus, basically the only difference is that domis don't get the speed bonus, so why does it take longer to get the same dps?

---
Well, most members of said blocks dont have that ability. The FCs and Leadership have it, cause that has been THEIR personal goal.

Because the drone speed bonus makes your dps apply faster and thus clear sites faster.

This is pretty much how every corporation including the one I’m in charge of outrages for runs things.  Some people are always going to whine, and it’s never going to be 100%.  Companies just don’t run that, constant updates and 100% uptime anymore.  It’s just not worth the manpower to satisfy the unhappy few.

I honestly don't know I wish they hadn't since it's a fucking chore when they warp into a sit you're in and steal and you have to kill them

Xavier W. - my phone won’t let me link his name

Yes, though it's a bit silly setting it up. You create a new Corp mask named whatever you want, then change the permissions on it to add the other desired corps to it's ACL. Then each Corp needs a person with Director roles to register/log into Tripwire as admin, search for the mask's name, and add it. Alternatively if someone has a custom ingame title of "Tripwire Admin", they too can register as admin and do the same. Let me know if you need any clarifications.

You're here to stay. 😃

Stop fucking moaning then.  You either die, fight or blueball.  If you CHOOSE to be cannon fodder that's your problem.  There are plenty of lowsec  areas.

Use Intel. With tools like near2  you can have alts in every region and see what's happening.

---
When did you last time asked someone from CCP about it?
---
Yea that's the same reason I don't do WHs. Not because I can't deal with the mechanics or whatever, but because of the constant d-scan spam it requires. If that became a requirement in null as well, I wouldn't do that either.
---
I'm gonna get carpal tunnel soon enough. No need to speed up the process.
---
Injectors are the issue - we always had supers/ titans or just carriers - simply players left game sooner than they skilled up to carrier.       
---
Now new players are injecting to a carrier after 1-2 month into the game. 
---
Take that back, meanie.
---
It is 25% bonus, sames as Drone Navigation Computer I has. And Domi (even not Navy one) has lots more slots than VNI.
---
Hey I remember this exact post from 2005 but it was about warp core stabs instead of local. 
---
It's because this game is lopsided. Normally small groups hit valuable targets and get out fast but cynos kind of ruin that. Cap ships and cynos make pvp shitty.
---
&gt; Perhaps, just perhaps, you're wrong and you're scared that the game might make it harder for you. Once upon a time, that was what Eve strived for.
---
You want local removed to make your favorite game activity easier though.
---
When talking game balance as a veteran player, it really helps to start with ideas that would fuck *yourself* over, to get over your own preferences and come up with things that are genuinely good. Instead of asking for local to be removed, how about asking for pve changes such that people ratting in groups of defensive pvp-capable ships was rewarded.
---
Oh no, will the former renter trash that swell our ranks be shaken out? What ever will we do??
---
DELETE LOCAL!
---
Spend 12 hours at work, largely moving circa 2013 ships abandoned in the North to Oijenan, counting the hours until I can come home, log in, and actually play the game.
---
And as soon as I get home local dies.
---
Facepalm, thanks. For some reason i thought there were legacy ships in Eve, like legacy items in Path of Exile.
---
More like 3 or 4 alts in supers that only get logged in when a cyno goes up. Before I unsubbed I hadn't been chased by a subcap gang in months. Not that removing local would do anything to change that. 
---
That's not a very solid argument and the downvotes don't change the fact that this guy is known within goons for being.... special enough to actually play like this and somehow enjoying it
---
Or use sentry’s and rails
---
I must be alone in thinking we dont have as bad of a botting issue (there is some) but a bigger issue with having alot of stupid people 
---
They know if they banned all of the bots, the PCU would be way lower. it's sad but true
---
What's the query?
---
My home is in a dead end system, I just park a cloaky camper 150km off the gate and give it it's own screen so I don't miss anything.
---
But the point *generally* stands
---
When cross-wormhole cynos exist, then we'll talk
---
Jita is dangerous if you're ignorant, how is that an argument for anything? 
---
Nice bait
---
When bots pay for the design team, I'm sure they would rather let the go unbothered for awhile.
---
The sad part is, with how easy it is to get into a super, I can \*actually\* see some newbro getting tackled with no local and freaking out, thinking they're new rats.  Remember that one Faggorz(SP?) assclown that got tackled by the Imp in Esoteria last year while streaming?  He thought the rats he killed were players.

---
I'm no WH industry expert, but you have a few options depending on both your corp, and the type of wormhole you are in. 
---
If your hole can spawn very large wormholes to K space, one option is to build capitals and then seed then in K space for sale when you get an opening.
---
Don't bother building capital components alone, their size makes it incredibly awkward to try and move around, most capital builders will either buy locally produced ore, or buy compressed ore and haul to a location to build it.
---
Depending on your corp (I'm assuming you're not solo) they may want you to build doctrine ships, and or home defense capitals. If you have an active pvp corp, resupply their losses at a good price will endear you greatly!
---
I don't know the number on whether you'll make a profit building regular ships, then hauling them out to sell, as you noted a DST can only fit so much in the hold, again if you have a very large hole to highsec, you can freighter out but its not reliable and can be risky.
---
Again, hauling compressed ore out to sell may or may not be profitable, I honestly can't help you there.
---
Good luck with whatever you do, and I hope someone more industry minded pops along!
---
Please explain for those of us not in the know
---
Maybe. But I much rather give my money to CCP for a broken game then EA for the same. 
---
Nah, you join Corp and control the statics. At that point it’s just like nullsec. New sig pops up = gtfo.
---
SELECT Character WHERE Alliance = Goonswarm Federation
---
Select * from accounts where activetime between 01-01-2019 and 01-08-2019 = '140'
---
Similar to this.  They definitely track when an account is logged in and active, so they should have a way to find accounts which are active 20 hours a day 7 days a week, which is a good first step in finding bots :) 
---
Has been for at least a year, CCP doesn't give a fuck, as per usual.
---
I’m not saying they aren’t bots but claiming they are while killing 2 afk ratting ships seems a tax misleading. 
---
Best Corp or Alliance Tournament (inhouse)  
---
Even if the bots adapt and play less often, CCP can use that extra income to fund actual humans to look at the bot problem.
---
I kind of doubt that, you underestimate how many people play to PVE.  Didn't CCP release metrics at one point saying a VAST majority of players never engaged in PVP?
---
War decs are meant to be bribes to Concord/faction police to look the other way. They'll accept the bribe when it's two entrenched corps having a quarrel between themselves (but if they involve any innocent bystanders they have to be seen to act), but don't want to be seen taking brown paper envelopes to allow MegaGlompCorp kick over the local lemonade stand (explaining the structure requirement rule). 
---
Given that, how exactly would it make sense to bribe the local police to ignore you shooting _them_?
---
Thing is CCP never has to say what the "cut off" is for account active time.  Botters who run 20 hours a day 7 days a week get splatted and wouldn't know exactly why.  Maybe CCP updated the anti-cheat and their bot got detected?  
---
I've never understood why JUST bots get banned anyway.  Like obviously some of these bots will be involved in RMT.  Let them run a month or two and follow the money then ban everyone involved, buyers, sellers, bots, the lot of them.
---
Maybe google brought him here.  Solid work on your part then huh. 
---
You say WWB2 and I get the itch to play again. 
---
During WWB I went from a total noob, that had only ever mined in high sec, to an almost total noob that was watching for pings like a hawk. 
---
It was a legitimate problem.  I'd get pings in the middle of the night and get up to go stomp goons.
---
That is sort of funny but a bit disheartening at the same time. However, do you think it would have been possible to do it just by function? I mean, CCP names don't mean a lot in the greater scheme of things.  
---
Also, now that the amount of offices has shrunk, maybe it'll be a bit easier? Or maybe while CSM8 was up was just a very volatile time for CCP?  
---
Many are multi boxing and/or slow honestly. I'm sure there's plenty of bad apples but nothing to be surprised about. More than half of loses are definitely legit players being caught while kasually krabbing. During my hour or two running sites I had 3 frig tackles pop on dscan, jump out. Jump in, blitz, then out. I noticed first, called on comms and refit for defense, then warped to friendlies only to still see a Gila and rorqual on field shortly before the rush. Luckily the 3 frigs were somehow too slow.

Hell there were maybe 60% of players even online during the final hours of quarantine.

Bottom of the window where you have your jobs/stations/making-stuff tabs (I can never remember the name of the leftmost tab!). With the blueprint-preview open, go to the structures tab, and find the structure you want to check, and click. It'll update the name to that top right pane (that looks like it's a search option but is non-interactable, because reasons), and your material requirements, job time, etc. will change to what they would be at that station.

A domi in that same setup gets an extra mid and low to play with, but you're cap is dry in a couple minutes, you are only repping ~20 extra hp/s, and you will be taking signficantly more additional dps due to not being able to sig tank.

yea, im all for their frequent updates but perhaps take a few update cycles to fix what is currently there, make some blog posts about hte tech detail of coding for new kernels or a new database, that kind of shit will keep most of us happy about no "new" things and geek out about the core being updated.  then once you have the base stable, go to town on updating and rolling out new content.

eve dose not need new shit all the time in game, the out of game details also count towards keeping the community engaged.

they aren't going to lose ANY subs.

Do you really believe that Bots will pay cash when they can buy plex off the market with their bounty earnings?

They can still see the bombers/blops/whatever enter system, assuming there's a bot within dscan range which, system dependent. It's not like a normal person dscanning where there's intervals. It's constant.

---
T1 frigates are not really designed for PvP, they're more cheap throwaway.
---
The only things I'd engage in a t1 frigate are covert ops (stealth bombers and scanning ships)
---
T1 cruisers are kinda where you can start doing some PvP or T1 destroyers if your skills are decent.
---
The actual players, or at least the ones I have heard, have seen local (and other channels) are broken. They have used the minuscule amount of brain power needed to realize "Hey now isn't a great time to rat" and have done other things. 
---
Those who can't think for themselves, see bots, are dying in their droves.
---
I'm not saying *some* real players aren't dying due to local being down, some are but when you see the enormous influx of vni and gila kills on relatively new accounts with unimaginative names and no pvp history. Really makes you think.

---
deltaxi or whatever Brisc Roubal's username is. 
---
The game design shouldn't promote AFK ISK-printing though.
---
But if they don't even respond when you tackle them, they're almost certainly bots. If you were legitimately ratting 'AFK' but present enough to respond to local, you would respond to the notification of getting tackled and at least try to fight back.

I find the idea naive tbh. Bots will simply adapt (scout alts on gates) and humans will have a harder time in general. You can't get botting "under control" no matter what you do, it's just not realistic to think that "eve will, one day, be cured from bots" because the fight against bots is a true fight against windmills, aslong as you don't have meaningful consequences for the people IRL that do it.   
---
You don't end bots by any mechanism of game development, you end bots by legal action. And that is, unfortunately, the end of the story. Not saying CCP shouldn't try, I am all for banning as many as they can find - I know that bots ruin games, seen it more than once.   
---
Doesn't change the reality of the situation =&gt; Publisher vs Bots is a never ending arms race in favor of the bots, cause they can simulate a human just fine with proper coding.   
---
Also, removing Localintel without any changes to other mechanics will lead to one thing and one thing only: Cloaky online. I know ganking defenseless PvE players is what a lot of people on this reddit really want (and for some, it's literally the only thing they can do, ask BL :D), but it's hardly a good thing for anyone else.

I'm actually like the idea of a huge event. The way I want eve to see dying, reset or even being saved is by having the Jovians invade New Eden as seeing how the Capsuleers went to far and now are seen as a threat or a decease to the universe. Or we could go with Halo's Forerunner Flood war idea. In the end what I want to see is a almost invincible enemy that takes over system by system, nullsec, lowsec and highsec burning everything in it's path and that Capsuleers that were once eternal enemies now have banded together in order to halt the end of times. Miners and manufacturers now building ships not to fight each other but to save their beloved universe from certain death. Fc's that normally fought each other for conquest now command vast fleets of all kinds of alliance, corp and npc corp, militia players, pirates, gankers, haulers and mission runners in order to defend systems and halt the advancing enemy. In the end if the war is lost as the last systems fall the servers get either reset or shut down for good. Managed to push back the enemy by recruiting more players from outside of eve or created an event device that will kill off the enemy and the servers will continue to run.

Make some suggestions.  I thought the fighter changes making Supers incredibly clicky would make them immune to botting but I was wrong.  There are botting supers out there (probably lots).

This arms race between bots and developers will never end and never be finally solved.  It's the Red Queen hypothesis.  I'm quite pessimistic about it.

CCP can't even maintain logs that show where I was when I disconnected, let alone any kind of anti-cheat software to check for known bot software.  Shit, they can't even tell when someone is input broadcasting unless they fuck up publicly.

If you're playing the game then why is spamming dscan a problem? Don't you nullsecers have intel networks anyway?
---
Eve is supposed to be a risky game, and local completely eliminates that risk.
---
People don't play in wormholes for other reasons, mostly the inability to build a big player base and regional control when your connections change every day, and the grind of scanning them. Not because of local.

Yes, dscan is one of the tools you can use.
---
You can also have friends or alts scouting the gates for you.
---
Or you can see something landing on grid or decloaking and warp out. Unless it's a bomber, or a logoff trap interdictor, you have several seconds to do so.
---
Or you could have a fleet on call so when you get tackled you can force a fight you can win.

I have idea - imagine yourself area when you need to constantly spam this dscan to know who is as you cannot see any one - even more you need to spend a lot of time searching for gate to another system ! Like imagine yourself how many players will want to play in this kind of space !! .... oh wait, we have it now. It is called WH space and almost no one want to play there .......
---
Glad to see you back then!
---
We found more last night on our roam. Check our KB, LOTS of bots
---
But on the flip side, if the price of plex is lower, then people have to pay more to get the same amount of isk. For example, if a ship you want costs 2 bil, and 500 plex costs 1 bil, you have to buy 1000 plex to get that item. Now, if the price of plex drops to, say, half that, this buyer now must buy 2000 plex to get that item, doubling the amount that ccp gets from that transaction. So dropping plex prices isn’t necessarily a bad thing for ccp.

It's almost every single PvP MMO where people lose a lot when they die.   People get very good, wolfpacks form, newbies die quickly, newbies move on to new game, the better gankers whine about lack of targets.  It's the nature of these games to eat their young.
---
I do, I edited my post. he never showed on d-scan.
---
If you lock it nobody can board it except the original owner
---
Sorry but it this is thanks to injectors.      
---
Earlier people needed 3-4 years to get into capital and super - now they do it after 2-3 months of playing the game. 
---
Have you thought about just moving to low sec? Its not as dangerous at you think and there is lots of money to be made. 
---
No one quits.  No one leaves.  Like a moth to a flame,  we always come back eventually. 
---
Sapporo, if Eve were to end, I would say that we can finally set aside our differences and spend our last few moments in game flying together. 
---
Might as well
---
&gt; don't play with your toys because I don't think it's fair. 
---
Thats a vey good point, cruise launchers with auto target clip then, probably not worth bothering but you never know. 
---
Ok why would you want to be in PL now.            
---
Thanks to headliner it becomes nothing more than PH with some recruiting requirements. 
---
Shit, you're right. I had forgotten about that mechanic until now.
---
Still that's easily the sort of thing I would miss while in combat, especially trying to multibox.
---
Thank you for noticing my efforts in jita.
---
Just going to quote myself because I already answered that point
---
&gt; People don't play in wormholes for other reasons, mostly the inability to build a big player base and regional control when your connections change every day, and the grind of scanning them. Not because of local.
---
&gt; Wait if you are playing a game why then we have auto cycling weapons and modules?
---
&gt; You can activate each cycle after all
---
If you want to suggest an auto-dscan then that is a reasonable suggestion. But your straw man is pretty obvious since I never suggested anything about removing auto-cycling.
---
In a public site, the normal probes is all they need. My guess is that your site was probed by a cloaky scanner, which provided a warp-in for the Sabre. Seeing the probes on Dscan would have been a trigger to either allign out, or take enough distance from any object to be able to cloak up
---
🦀 thread is gone 🦀
---
if ccp wanted null to be dangerous they'd do things like limit citidel spam and promote scarcity so thousands of bears cant all sit bunched up in one big dungheap under the same super umbrella. but they don't want it to be dangerous. the main reason anyone even lives in nullsec is because it's safe. it is what it is and it's not going to change. the second nullsec becomes unsafe all the bears will flood the hisec mission hubs and nobody will have any reason to hold sov anymore.
---
Dscan also shows your current overview settings. Maybe your overview is a bit screwed?
---
I came back after 6 years gone recently. F2P is not bad, if you're good you can easily pay for sub with PVE activities. Skill injectors are nice, want to fly a ship today? Buy skill injectors and boost your SP. 
---
The population has fallen over the years but still fairly active 24/7. A lot of corps will take newbies like Eve Uni, Brave.
---
If my chars were VNI ratting i'd stick them out even if local wasnt working - as you said CCP can reimburse it because it IS because of server issues that you died and if you do die, you've probably already broke even on the loss by the time you pop
---
I tried it once and put my own ship into half armor with drones before realizing how retarded I am
---
Yeah I got greedy thinking this time I'll be ready to warp out, first time getting bubbled lol.
---
This obviously wasn't intentional - losing all the corp and social channels is bad for everyone.
---
But it has shown up what a huge problem anomaly botting is. CCPls do something about how easy it is to print ISK almost risk free and AFK or as a bot.
---
i wasn't arguing pro-botting, and it is bad fer the game, but the implication that ccp loses money from plex bought in game is just flat out ignorant
---
No you getting it wrong.          
---
EVE is already like a 2nd job and you want to increase even more commitment.       
---
It is not about **what you are want to play** but about **what more people are willing to play** (willing the important part here)        
---
Do you know that if we applied the same number of players playing in WH space to whole New Eden - we could have like 3-4k online ( could be less **and** including higsec) making this game unprofitable to CCP?           
---
How many active subs this game have? Do you know?
---
I bet that current Omega account number will be around 300.000 ... much, much less active players.            
---
I used one of my best record for the first  one :P 
---
I think I'll upload the footage of certains loses I had In a near future as some were really hard/close fight.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74415043/ sorry for delay, didn't changed anything so far
---
terrible fitting room, kinetic lock to hams and hml, and it could use a mid (Drake Navy is faster and tankier)
---
Well I understand why it happens.  I think the nature of PvP MMOs though pretty much guarantee they are always fairly niche games.  
---
There is a little of the "eating your seedcorn" that makes people eventually move on to greener pastures.  For everyone who has a 20/1 Kill ratio, there has to be either a flood of noobies, or people with 1/20 Kill ratios, and at some point the noobies or chumps decide they have better things to do than spending 15 a month to be targets.
---
They should turn off local in null and low sec, players dont show up until they talk permanently, would be a nice change.
---
Milk for the Khorne Flakes!
---
It's based on total (absolute) amount of cap, making nosferatus very pointless on battleships. If my battleship is at 10% cap remaining with 2,000 GJ, and your cruiser is at 100% with 1,000 GJ, my nos won't work on you. 
---
rip Hard Krabs Inc. when is our PL app getting accepted?
---
Yes, minmaxing, and the lack of people who choose to pay money to be the targets of minmaxers.  I don't think I've seen that many PvP games where you build and lose items when you die get around that.  the only PvP I see being successful are KoTH and MoBAs where you really don't lose much but your pride when you die.  Massive death penalties and minmaxers who often grief is pretty much a recipe for not having a massive playerbase.
---
And how much do you think CCP is losing when people RMT Isk to other players, instead of people buying PLEX for Isk?
---
hell yeah
---
The only way to prevent being dropped on is D-scan. Catching probes on scan or seeing the ship mid-warp is enough warning. That gives you a few precious seconds to react and either be ready to fight or ready to flee. 
---
You say you saw probes on scan. You should have at least been aligned to something ready to jump and scanning furiously because you knew, for a fact, someone is in system.
---
If you want to know how to avoid being blown up. If you know someone is in system assume they're hostile and react accordingly. You got popped because you went about your normal routine and waited for them to land on grid. Kill boards are full of people who thought they had a few more seconds.
---
TL; DR: If you see ANYTHING on D-scan. It's time to bug out. If you don't it's your own fault.
---
You know you don't get personal responses to bug reports, right? Support tickets, sure, but bug reports go into the big database of broken crap to be handled as and when they can be verified/solved. Generally they'll only get back to you if they need more info.
---
If you want to check here:
---
https://community.eveonline.com/support/bug-reports/my-bug-reports/ 
---
That should have a list of the reports submitted via the account you log into the site with, as well as their status and any comments. Although they don't always close things off when they're fixed (I have one still Open that hasn't been a problem in over a month), presumably because they're still working on the cause so it doesn't resurface next update.
---
Anyway, at least if you can see that it hasn't been Closed or be sure they're waiting on more info from you, you can consider it "in progress" and just chill.
---
dunno. that's not what the issue at hand is. RMT is a separate issue.
---
Because every pvp entity went hunting for it.  If everyone in eve decides to hunt vni we can make a record.  
---
I flew way out into null... didn’t find shit... then went afk on a gate and got killed. Sigh. Was fun at least. 
---
\&gt; I like null when it plays like wormhole
---
Go to wormhole then. Null, as it has been for years, is essentially a player-made hisec, and that's how people want to play it. CCP won't change it because it will alienate and likely push away a large section of the playerbase, which is $$ lost just to please a relatively small population of hunters, which makes no damn business sense. 
---
Even when it doesn't push people fully away, a lot of people who would stay have alts whose entire premise requires the kind of safety that such a change takes away, which would obviously be unsubbed.
---
You can't be aligned while hacking, you have to stay within 5km of the can.
---
INIT. tried to sell mining permits to FRT. They refused. Well..
---
Well and it worked both ways yesterday.  We didn't know if a system was alive or dead so we had to D scan it down while we checked.  
---
It makes space seem more exciting when there is that mystery.
---
I don't know what a good middle ground is, as alliances would likely just make a third party local intel.
---
They are a business with hundreds of employees and more than a decade's experience of running multiplayer games. Not some small indie company lmao.
---
I have a ticket with Attached status since 2017
---
Good video. Its unfortunate that the rage eviction only resulted in one proper fight. I'm curious, why weren't caps deployed in that fight? 
---
took you this long?
---
People like you are why employees end up being scheduling to work on Christmas.  
---
You're still not getting it (I suspect deliberately so).
---
There are lots of differences between J space and K space. A lack of free intel through local (there *is* local in J space, it just doesn't give you immediate intel) is not the reason population is lower there.
---
So 'hurf durf wh population is lower' is just a straw man because I'm not proposing making null like wormholes in every way.
---
Slack, Discord
---
Logi here. Will be in my Basi or Guardian and try to rep everyone around until the end
---
I’m so out of the loop. 
---
What are VNIs?
---
What does it have to do with bottling?
---
What changed recently that would blow up VNIs?
---
This is a pretty dope video :) 
---
INIT's initial insertion of \~600 stealth bombers is sufficient numbers to alpha capitals.
---
No donation.
---
No salvation.
---
Local gives you a good idea when and when not to engage. It also allows to to burn through empty or blue populated systems when hunting. Saves you from having to dscan multiple points in  a larger system. I like null because it allows me to make use of smartbombs, bubbles and no loss of sec status. These things are also used by the enemy but if you invest SP into developing these shipline you kinda want to be able to use em.
---
I think, and note I'm not sure how to do this, that if you want to encourage behaviors in players its better to reward the styles and methods you want then block and punish the ones you don't (obvious things like botting etc aside). This way when people try to game the system to optimize their gameplay they end up playing in the styles you/the developer want.
---
How do you get your screen set up like that to have the overviews overlay each other and does it follow the eula?
---
Literally everywhere. 
---
But maybe you're confused because people tend to react differently to a roam from a nullbloc entity that could have dreads parked in any region and a hundred supers a couple mids away. The "10 guys in roaming ships" corps just became free killmarks for someone's super alt.
---
There was a cop dev who said that they was working on it
---
there is also no chance to apply damage properly against a boosh stuka fleet, a boosh raven fleet or a rail tengu fleet with carriers and dreads, especially with the number of pilots in place
---
dude this bot menace need to go,fuck renting empires that harbouring them...wtf is hard to understand?this afk pve need to go.where is risk vs reward?is more isk and no risk
---
its overlayed in OBS not on my monitor
---
You literally cannot make changes to the game to prevent botting without fucking players. A bot will just update it's methods while players suffer because of mechanics designed around a bot. 
---
Well the 5min invul kind of ruins it, other capitals don't have it, they are good content to kill.
---
How is an actual small gang going to fight the blob with plenty of time to form during panic? 
---
But why
---
Yeh but there comes a point where buying a ship with out of game money just becomes prohibitively expensive.  Nobody wants to spend $40 on a carrier.
---
That "Bot Genocide" thing should happen regularly, not one dumb one off thing.
---
Agreed, CCP needs to to remove Cloaky camping. The AFK "gameplay" that's gone on for way too long.
---
Oh, and remove Wormholes too, if Nullsec won't have a local then what the point of WH's..may as well just remove those. 
---
all this guys defending here null sec safety, are either isk sellers  or renting landlords  harbouring bots...i dont see any logical reason to have 50 miner alts or gazillion vni alts ratting all day evvrrday beside of the reason of selling isk
---
Would be cool to see if you find them.  
---
I remember seeing stuff this old like 7-8 years ago when I started to really get into AT.  
---
Seems like another life ago.  
---
a laptop can complicate things depending what graphics that laptop provides. using the dual gpu laptops requires additional config so 3D programs can use the nvidia graphics adapter instead of the intel gpu.  
---
If you do have one of those that could be a necessary prerequisite to attend to configuring.  
---
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA_Optimus
---
Its good to see that after all the months im gone people still cry about the same issues xD
---
Correct.  I suppose the best you can do is make it easier for players to kill bots and perhaps incentivise them to do so.
---
Local was down, and bots rely on it exclusively to know when to dock up, so they were basically sitting ducks for hours
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRIbf6JqkNc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRIbf6JqkNc)
---
VNI stands for Vexor Navy Issue, EVE's premier low-SP, cheap AFK ratting ship, and thus great for botting. VNI bots rely on local exclusively to know when they should dock up. Local was down yesterday, so they had no way of telling when hostiles have entered their system, so they would just sit around in sites waiting to be tackled. 
---
Career agent missions if you have not done them already. Should be 3 systems for each faction with career agents.

It's not christmas. Plenty of people work on Sundays. It's not about me or you, as much as you seem to want to push that agenda of yours. It's about how unprofessional it makes them look.
---
Probably my fave from 2018 https://i.imgur.com/E2J4mRa.png
---
bud i totally agree - but if CCP don't want to let it go how you can solve it.         
---
Look at fucking VNI or other stuff working this way - drop drones, obit .... forget.       
---
If CCP **WANTED** to solve it few small changes to drone aggression and you have like 70% of the issue resolved.            
---
Why CCP don't want to touch it - as those need to be subbed accounts if you want to safely run more than one.              
---
What about relic/data bots?         
---
Putting 1-2 rats in there and you have solved most of the issue - yet we still have it here.               
---
Why we still have nullified ceptors? Do you remember the 37s camps? The fun and how it affected the area?            
---
How different was eve when there was no cheap nullified insta warping taxi ships?           
---
It was better - but yet again bit more subs.                
---
So titans/supers - when the issue with this started?        
---
Injectors - will those go away ???? **NO as sweet sweet $$ for CCP and people skipping years of training in 1 day while still paying CCP with some extra cash on the top**            
---
Cynos? Why we have cynos?                 
---
Because sweet sweet cash - you need another char putting up you cyno, look how many we need to have to maintain the JF route ... all those sweet accounts ....               
---
So have this straight - do i hate current situation?  Yes, but i don't like the ideas about how to change it making K space like WH space that i simply hate. Like not at my age this kind of mechanics.             
---
Also you know CCP loves those big ships - as they need from you spending much more injectors than making new char that will fly a cruiser.                       
---
So before we start to think about fixing the situation CCP need to start thinking about fixing the game and not creating new mechanics that will increase how much cash they can milk from players.             
---
bad bot
---
Or just ignore me, that's pretty cool too.
---
That's not necessarily true. The reason I started killing them in the first place was that I saw how easy my own vnis were to kill, even if I was just momentarily distracted. They have poor reaction times and 100mn fits have the agility of a dump truck.
---
BUT MY 10 MAM CRUISER GANG CANT KILL A RORQUAL WAAAAAA
---
Looks like he's playing weekly instead of daily now
---
ships already make a noise when they warp on grid with you.
---
❤ Stainguy
---
knowing the type of the poster odds are he's not talking about snuff necessarily, but about the pirates that killed his krabmobile
---
Nobody is blaming people for using their capitals against cruiser gangs, it's free killmarks. I'd do the same thing. 
---
CCP let things get like this and it's CCP's responsibility to fix it. You know, if they want to. 
---
My main argument in favor of the 5-15 second idea is that most of the time, when I appear in local to others, I am actually still coming out of the warp bubble.
---
So they can see me before I can actually interact with my screen. I think the gate cloak idea is probably too much... A whole minute is a LONG fucking time. But I feel like 10 seconds would be great. You get enough time to dscan like 2-3 times and hit warp.
---
This. As a lifetime null sec pilot, I'm ok with delay/remove local. Provided you change dscan to be more like an active radar that doesn't require me to repeatedly push a button for hours at a time. 
---
Easiest way to be safe is to do sites in nullsec and only hack when you are alone in local. Though local can be unreliable these days...
---
sure snuff are oppressive, but as dreadop said somewhere in this thread, simply put, ccp made changes, snuff adapted better than the rest and ended up top dog.
---
   
---
This is the same fagraging that was happening 4-5+ years ago when PL where relevant and dropping super blobs on random lowsec nerds
---
bomb run done well

You mean the thunderdome that allows you to roll out wormholes, and completely cut yourself off from the outside world for 4 hours? That thunderdome?

---
I see you've never played a wargaming title.
---
"Numbers are estimated to be \~1500"  
---
LOOOOOOOL keeping that meme alive hm?
---
reality was you knew exactly we just had 200 stukas on and had around 600ppl in the wormhole total (thats all timezones not constantly online ppl) and you formed 200 hacs. Goons were mostly gone and only reavers and snuff had ships in the hole (snuff had 30 dudes i believe).
---
So what I’d say has happened is a guy has used an alt in a cloaky scanner to scan your site and warp in. He’s then positioned the cloaked scanner off a can you hadn’t hacked and waited till you started on it. He then warps his doctor to his scanner which is next to u cloaked and throws the bubble up as soon as he lands. 
---
You have a few options to get away. have something on ur overview u can warp to. As soon as u see a hostile, micro on (overheat if possible) and repeatedly click on the warp out which will make ur ship align to the warp out. At this point I can either try to make it out of the bubble and warp but if the dictor is faster ur gonna die. 
---
Another thing u could do is as soon as ur more then 2500m off the can hit ur cloak and the change direction. U’ll coast out ur micro cycle and if ur luck avoid getting decloaked. The it’s just a matter of slow boating cloaked out of the bubbles and warping out. 
---
Both that quick reflexes and abit of luck. 
---
Also in ur sound setting try turning 3rd party warp sound all the way up. If someone exits warp on grid u’ll hear a pop. If u get used to reacting to the sound u can get moving before the have finished exiting warp and can be outside the bubble at speed before the bubble goes up. 
---
Hope this helps you understand how ur getting caught. 
---
dj and kopo have been handling ustz stratops for a while, and tek and mutafakaz are old school -a- stratop fcs
---
and in particular tek is scary good but doesn't play outside rutz
---
Do you hot keys to warp away? I think d is the default key. Hold d and click on an object to warp too. It is faster than the menus.
---
Just don't warp to a site with npcs that will kill you or be ready to warp quickly to a safer site. 
---
Really? I thought when you rolled a hole it spawned a new one - are you telling me you can totally seal a hole for 4 hours? 
---
Nullbear, btw.
---
If you use an overpropped VNI, regardless if you are paying attention, you often cant align out when someone warps on grid before they can catch you. Perhaps if you have an itchy finger and spam dscan every two seconds...but k space shouldnt be like WH space. Im sure you guys caught many unaware people, AFK mostly, but I doubt they were mostly bots. You have to be real here. If they don't fix this, a lot of people will stop playing.

That is the killmail for the biggest loot pinata ever after 4days of constant hole control cause you guys gave up. Ofc its not a problem to get ppl in to whore on the thing. To claim you estimated to be fighting 1500 ppl at the time of the video is just a sad try of looking like you fought against all odds when in fact it was the other way around :D

you can gate anoms below sanctums to keep supers out of havens, you can buff drops in escalations and nerf bounties in anoms, you can create more group pve content like incursions and pirate sotiyos while making them less retarded than the sotiyos are
---
there are a lot of options, but most people either pve in high sec or only pve to finance pvp and so there hasn't been a lot of player outcry on the subject, just constant low level grumbling about how afk vnis suck but they're kind of the best option

But you clearly aren't risk adverse.

i stated that i estimated imperium toons inside the hole to be about 1500 but no where did is said all of them took part in the fight that i showed.
---
*gainst all odds when in fact it was the other way around * this is pretty funny
---
&gt; Instead of relying on intel chat, local, pirate helper, etc, I had to be alert, use dscan aggressively and accept that a ganf of hostile could have jumped in.
---
Wow, it’s almost like theres a way to play the game where all this exists. I’m forgetting the name, something to do with worms and holes?

It has nothing to do with people growing and finding other interests, right????

@here Sorry to bother you guys with a random ping, but can whoever is "PhilRicket" on Reddit, please send me a PM. Thanks.
---
Yeah so, the only ones that spawn a new are the statics. As long as no one warps to them (inside the hole), the other side doesn't appear for four hours. Tada! You are now cut-off from everyone. Now you just watch your system map for new sigs, and you're free to krab 700mil an hour. Welcome to the "Thunderdome".

You buy a tank in WoT and it blows up you have to wait &lt;x&gt; minutes to use it again.  You buy a thanatos and lose it you are SHIT outta luck son.  One of these things is reusable and possibly worth a premium price tag, the other isn't.

---
We brought in so many cause we expected to fight all of wh space. Which turned out to be true didnt it?
---
In order to quickform 100 people you need \~300 people in the wormhole (thats atleast for big nullsec groups) so bringing in 550 we were able to field 200 stukas and 60 ravens to fight 200 hacs
---
they should have won that fight just from the numbers/shiptypes perspective and to claim they had no chance is just dumb. Ask a more experienced group like skillu or bl or even horde how they would have engaged the situation and i think they would agree.
---
Also... watch the video (beside the fail narrative) it actually shows quite well what happened there. The warpin wasnt a missclick but they had no idea how to fight stukas and paid for it.

Those are all good suggestions, I do not do anoms regularly so this might be an obvious answer.

I never said it was a good choice. I said I'd gladly deal with their garbage if that garbage helps newbies stay in the game.

Sort's mug drama. As any good drama it was deleted by the mods so no linky.

Second place goes to the noobman ban for leaks, as described here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a5sdg2/noobman_banned_supporting_source_for_this/
---
So if you need to bring In 300 guys to rage form 100 - and you guys had 260 doesn’t that mean you already had upwards of 800-900 in the WH? 
---
If you’re inclined enough to spend 20 dollars chances are it won’t take much to push you further. 
---
We never pinged 28times which clearly shows you are talking shit here. Nice try wh guy.
---
Making null less safe is easy and CCP doesn't even have to lift a finger. If you want YOUR null to be dangerous, NRDS is your answer.
---
You have guys like me that run a build that specifically counters the top configuration, but your setup loses to everything else pretty much.
---
Sure, you lose to a ton of stuff...
---
But like you said, eventually everyone just runs the best configuration, so having a setup that counters that (even if you can't beat anything else) is so much fun. 
---
Nothing like dunking on people who think they are unbeatable.
---
&gt; Not even a day after fixing it

Hey u were there right? Guess u looted too. We blobbed hell yeah!!!! If the opportunity arises guess we going to do it again. Why not?
---

---
Pando,
---
Yes you did. Gotta love the fact that your alliance has multiple ex-WH corps. Easy to put isk Alts in them. 
---
Its an estimated number to keep it simple. So even you can do the math. What exactly was in the hole at the time is hard to tell and it could be 700dudes total (with snuff and reavers) i guess.
---
Wait, did you bring tons of people or not?  You keep changing your story.
---
Was just using your math - to keep it simple. 
---
I believe refuges can give escalations which is like a combat mission where you have a chance to get faction modules from the loot. Can make a bit more money by just running sites that give escalations. 
---
Some combat sites have to be scanned down using a probe launcher. These are often DED sights but can also be unrated. You can look up the site name and usually find what's going to be inside for enemies. 
---
Those can be a fun change of pace but the money [like exploration] is a bit random as you are mostly in getting faction modules from the loot. But bounties are only really good money when you go to more dangerous space anyway. And getting a 50mil or more item is exciting. Usually a cruiser is the better way to go for those sites. Some are a bit harder. 
---
I quite enjoy exploring. It's a slightly different set of skills so it does take a few days to up the skills for easier scanning and better chance of getting the loot. It's very cheap to get into and can have some big payouts. Definitely reccomend trying it out. 
---
Ya the assumption that players wont go do pve activities at all when local is down is just plain wrong.
---
I was running 3 VNI's with local down, lost 2, killed a stratios, made profit, kept adm's up, op success.
---
Though I believe there is strong evidence of input broadcasting against this guy.
---
it's a popular opinion actually
---
First of all : thank you for that constructive answer !
---
Second of all : I am sadly based in a C1 wormhole, which mean I will rarely see, if ever, a connection bigger than a medium-sized wormhole... Even thought a Freighter could be used to move the tons of minerals generated by a maxed-out Rorqual, it will basically be stuck here forever, or at least until I get inevitably catched by some spooky neutrals !
---
According to what you said, the best I can do is simply compress the ore, export it to a freeport Athanor in Highsec and reproccess my stuff there, for maximum ISK. I could technically do some low-end T2 materials, but since wormhole are stuck with R4 moons, won't be that great. However, I almost finished my train to do some T3 Invention on one of my alts, which could be more interesting, since Subsystems and TIII hulls are pricey and generaly not that bulky.
---
Thanks for this comment, industrialist friend !
---
We ran up to 5 reinforcement fleets when we had the time (after they gave up) and there could have been prepings for those but we never reached a level like that... also you could just provide proof u know
---
"your alliance" kinda gives your whole act away dude :D
---
I too would be mad if my space guild achievement was turned into a meme. As a goon FC I expected more of you. 
---
I 100% agree. You are owning up to it. Your leaders aren’t. They keep acting like this was a military victory. Nope. This was a stealth victory with likely one of the best small logistics team in Eve. Those freighter guys did a truly impressive job. 
---
So about the same as TEST and GSF and NCdot
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7sigyv/tfw_you_shitpost_your_way_on_to_national/
---
You have clearly never, ever lived in lowsec. 
---
So you take a break from hacking. If nothing happens then you spend a few minutes sitting in space ready to react, or just warp to safe and wait there.
---
Or you can keep hacking until your ship explodes. Your choice.
---
I never changed my story once.
---
Its still the same.
---
We brought in as much as we could to have all timezones in the whole. You fought our ustz and lost a fight you should have won. End of story.
---
Let the bot slaughter begin anew!
---
&gt;I find the idea naive tbh. Bots will simply adapt (scout alts on gates) and humans will have a harder time in general. 
---
So they will stop botting once anyone flies through gate? Sounds fine. About having harder time doing pvm, well, EVE is a game about shooting ships in space so why not. There are endless variants of this possible - region wide chat, or constellation, or cloaking device that removes you from local or whatever. Anything but what we have now when you are reported as soon as you enter region. No, just no.  
---
https://youtu.be/4HHpR9khVKw
---
Logistic guys were amazing. On the other hand i have to disagree with you. It was an impressive military victory. Everyone said that this was impossible to do and we did it. Even HK guys were confident. Guess too much confidence backfire. 
---
Op ment that its broken because people ARE showing. 
---
If you have 600 bombers and they are on at the same time yes...
---
yeah but it's bad for the game. it's not about 'rights' or anything like that, it's about creating a healthy game environment. nullsec as it exists is highly geared towards passive, negative, even isolated playstyles.
---
people who go on about "it's a capital ship", "we're just organised", "bring more friends" don't seem to realise that no one is blaming them. but ccp does need to make the kind of hyper farming that goes on now, harder.
---
the MER by itself is the best evidence that the new mechanics have created an economy that is out of control. it needs to be fixed. 
---
Domi doesn't have launcher slots. Next.
---
we were pretty confident that rage could not be evicted by wormholers yes. if someone thought rage is safe against kspace null bloc numbers than that guy is a retard
---
Honestly lowsec being dead and all you might even start mining there just dont yo yo tama and you'll be fine
---
End of story. Part of narrative. #Pando2018
---
Did you just nominate yourself lmfao 
---
They gave up on day2... what difference does it make what i call a fleet to bring people in?
---
HK guys were confident? What planet are you living on? 
---
how is Stuka a nazi name lmao 
---
Honestly just counter dropping this shit with dread bombs and you'll have tons of fun:)
---
I'm all for making null more dangerous, and specifically less safe for krabbing, but just removing local isn't the answer. I don't think people realise how fundamental local is to the meta. It works in wormholes because of mass limits and random connections (honestly, wormholes are really well designed when you think about it), but if you pulled it from null it would change the landscape incredibly, and possibly not in a way that would translate well given cynos, geography, and NPC space. 
---
&gt;"Numbers are estimated to be ~1500"
---
&gt;LOOOOOOOL keeping that meme alive hm?
---
&gt;We brought in so many cause we expected to fight all of wh space.
---
spin.exe has encountered a problem....

It’s the nickname nazi gave their dive bombers.
---
TEST can win best and worst, right?
---
How does “your alliance” give anything away?
---
Your alliance and init. Mercenaries are filled with ex-wh’ers. The guys who engineered this eviction are all in leadership positions. Aren’t there two ex-WHSOC corps? Hole punchers and one other?
---
 There is a health presence of Ex-WH’s in Init and Init mercenaries.
---
Yeah it was what i meant xd like hes watching on his mining tab for example. It makes sense not to see the ships on dscan.
---
Great idea. Not at all disrespectful of the people who died.
---
I think you dont understand the importance of that fight really. 200 or 300 horde were 5jumps out of the wormhole at the time (not being mentioned in the video ofc) ontop of that a lot of wh folks were just waiting to get in with a stable connection. If we would have lost that they would have outnumbered us in every timezone and they would have had free choice of shiptype ontop of that. It was hacs vs. stukas and we won so there is atleast a certain level of military victory here i would say :D
---
As somebody who does not play eve. This title is complete gibberish.
---
Couldn't agree more, lowsec gets that wild west feeling that it should have. Don't care about hs or f1 monkey space.
---
Yeah not unpopular at all. But it's not a trivial change. Directional scan should probably be redesigned to make it auto update like the overview. But that raises the question of why have a separate overview and d-scan at all.
---
Local chat was likely conceived purely as a tool for socializing. Imo getting rid of it, on top of all the discussed benefits, also will increase immersion and the sense you're actually exploring deep cold space.
---
how can i mention something in the video that i have no knowledge of? u realise i am scrub linemember
---
You claimed to be in IM but you talk about "your alliance" constantly which shows you are just spinning. The fact that you have no clue who even did the logistics here just adds to it.
---
Im sorry if we killed your assets there but im sure you will recover soon :D
---
Amazing as always jack. Good to have you back.
---
Sorry I am on my phone. There are between 4-5 of them. Will try to edit later.
---
Hey listen, nomad bro
---
Well last time i checked logistics is an important factor to achieve military victories...
---
That's what makes them good. 
---
you are right. But you see my side here right? The blobb was on the way and this was the fight to decide whos blobb is gonna get in. Obviously hk leadership wouldnt tell anyone about the horde fleet that was on the way.
---
Remember when they said that this fight was a huge force of Muninns vs. only a small Stuka fleet?
---
Thanks this got it sorted =)

We didnt need local at all actually. To balance things - you can disable dscan in wh systems. 
---
Group anoms sound like an excellent thing to bot. 
---
nope thats 2 days later...
---
i said o7 from horde in your chat when you were coming our way and got banned from talking in it
---
that’s just rude
---
Funny you should mention this.  I'm working on it now.  Probably Rens, since it's the spot where I made my first billion before I discovered the joys of PvP.  I'm winding my accounts down now, and that's where I'm thinking I'll dock up when my sub runs in two weeks. 
---
just remove local :)
---
https://youtu.be/kF3_CDYU9NA
---
Easy
---
- Make anomalies target drones like sleepers do
---
- Change some or all of the bounty to drops you have to take to an NPC station - doesn't stop you AFKing it but it does mean you don't get the ISK if you wuss out every time someone is in local and leave your MTU behind
---
- Reduce respawn rates so you can't sit in anoms all day in the same system
---
Harder but worth exploring
---
- Make anomalies reward teamwork rather than one big ship, like incursions and diamond-rat sites do
---
- Give the rats some scram-web ceptors so 100MN fits aren't invincible
---
And of course make it harder for bots to interact with client controls, which I think is how they work, rather than OCRing the screen and clicking based on that (which is hard to do anything about).
---
I cant believe HK's 600 hacs couldnt win against your 100 gokus! Truely a christmas miracle to kill an entire corp with just 90 bombers. They could have easily wrecked the entire init fleet consisting of 80 bombers with their 600 capital class ships. It takes a true genius to win a fight with 70 frigates vs 800 wormhole supers!
---
apparently our talents for misdirection have exceed r/eve's ability to discern reality from hilarious memery.
---
Sleeper Dreams
---
Doing wormholes right 
---
None of that has anything to do with what I said.
---
You're either on the can hacking, or you're not. There's no middle ground. If you think taking random breaks to sit cloaked is going to save you, you must be new to this game.
---
&gt; The guys who engineered this eviction are all in leadership positions.
---
None of the top 4-5 people in the logistics team are any kind of leadership, in fact 3 of them weren't even INIT. members prior to this op, and Riven Avaren is just a BIGSH line member, so not sure where you got that from.
---
We never claimed that.
---
But you claimed you only had 50 people... instead you can see its close to 200 hacs (which is what we said)
---
The second quote is out of context. Im talking about the initial 550 init brought in.
---
Its your own spin.exe that got a problem i guess.
---
We claimed we had 50 &lt;real&gt; people.  Your continued inability to read like a functioning adult is remarkable.
---
Srsly dnt see aliens in our local solar system do ya. Why should you see other people. Only people u see in local shud be people who talk and corp/allaince and blues
---
That would be neat!
---
Take your nazi glorification to the streets. I hear right wing politics are all the rage right now.
---
I'm in PL?
---
&gt; But you claimed you only had 50 people...
---
Link?
---
I think we've always been pretty clear that HK has ~100 real people, for example in [Franky's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a58qti/the_rage_story/): 
---
&gt; HRDKX has always had between 90-110 real people and as of writing we have about 60 of those online while a quick look at INIT comms shows them to have between 300 and 400 before a ping has gone out.
---
oh, i see, so the goons you brought in don't count, just the init guys.  this must be the special Init Math ive heard about.
---
Okay. Now you are trying too hard to trigger me. The narrative spinning is fine but dont call it gokus ok?! Or else ill have brisc find out where your crabhole is and burn it to the ground.
---
The topic is worst user, not worst CSM. 
---
Too bad there's not a place in the game like this. Could make it accessible through wormholes or something. 
---
Goons jumped out after the initial reff. Reavers and snuff came in and count very much so make it 700 if you like...
---
Best Moderator &lt;3
---
&gt; do you think it would have been possible to do it just by function?
---
No. The function of various devs changes quite often.
---
&gt; maybe it'll be a bit easier?
---
Maybe. The CSM would have to do it, though. There's no way anyone outside the CSM could do it: most CCP devs don't engage with the player base as part of their jobs. And a lot of the workhorse devs that really get shit done are entirely invisible to the player base.
---
&gt; while CSM8 was up was just a very volatile time for CCP?
---
It's an interesting question that I have no way to answer definitively, lacking a basis for comparison.
---
I see you’re spicing up the danger on Reddit by making us read your post. 
---
You are a fucking idiot
---
Yeah because everything in the game is super super cheap to buy
---
If we can count coalitions, I nominate "Mistakes Were Made Coalition". They couldn't hold their own against an 80-man corp (that was probably 10 real people).
---
yes yes the fabled Holeworms in eve I've heard many a tale of the riches you can make in them
---
Isn't looking back exactly what you are doing being in this post?
---
I think this line of thinking is way too optimistic. It worked yesterday because it was a sudden unexpected event. If no local chat would become the norm then the bots would simply be adapted accordingly and continue. 
---

I especially love how people imagine us being upset that our mining areas are empty... lol, what?

Proxay, I'm kind of hurt you don't remember me, You were a god in Blade. when I was in Ginnungagap ages ago :D

And well, I am doing something, but I'm doing it only after I actually see some evidence, the 4 botting corps we've kicked since dec. 1st (well 3, one is getting kicked today) has all had clear evidence sent to me on multiple occations, we're currently looking at 5 other corps in relation to this as well (and let's be honest, yesterday was a great day in that respect)
---
You won't see results straight away though, I am a "nice" person (probably too nice) where if it's a botting corp I give between 10 and 14 days notice so the can unanchor their shit and get the fuck out.
---
and if you want to see the legitness, BBC Xiqian, Survey Corps Ausomething (reddit actually complained about them 3 days before their 14 day period was up ^^) and Yellow Corp. I truly believe botters is a cancer of the game, and I don't want anything to do with them when they are proven to be
---
Glad you're back and making vids. Cya in space.
---
Well I can't imagine that switching tasks continuously can be very good for work flow, I'd consider that a problem honestly.  
---
And now that I have you talking. Do you know anything about CCP's policies in regards to having their employees engage with the community? Is everyone free to do so at will? Has the community, at least on reddit, been such a negative force that they just don't? 
---
I dare you not to mod me.

Do you mean people who skilled themselves? :Smirk:
---
well yes in 24h you can bring in a lot of people already (and we did) but 48h is twice as much so... it kinda makes a difference for the final numbers
---
blue scout in another VNI AND steal his sites! Double win
---
Right, those goons that came in for the initial RF that conveniently get left out of all your initial numbers.
---
But dude, seriously, weren't there more goons than init on the keepstar mail?  Yeah, they totally left...
---
FINALLY! Thank you for the awesome videos man.
---
Well today I learned. 
---
Watching BIGthump die again made my day
---
The really interesting part is that he explained that in order to have 100 people on, you have to have 300 people staged. So... let’s see... 1359*3 is...
---
We brought a lot of goons back in after everyone knew what was going on.
---
Remember... the initial goon fleet had no idea whats going on and telling ppl "you now live in a wormhole for the next week" on some random fleet is usually not so great
---
computers? how DO they work
---
You mean like every other pirate group does and has done since Drunk and Disorderly was alive and well in GalMil? Why do people act like it's only one group that does this/has done this. Sure, it has some to do with Snuff. But Snuff has lived in their AO since 2015 and the corp even before that. How is it Snuff's fault when people put high value structures right next to them and act all shocked and surprised when SNUFF's current deployment ends and they come home and clean house?
---
So, in conclusion, yes SNUFF drops caps on people, so what? So does every other larger pirate block since the beginning of Eve. Shit, when I was in Galmil almost a decade ago we had null blocks dropping supers during FW ihub bashes against 2 triage. This is nothing new. Now, how and why did Snuff become the dominate LS force to the point that everyone has forgotten that there used to be tons of groups like us? That's the disease I am talking about. 
---
But they are, there are 3 of them in this very thread.
---
I rly dont know why we still talk about numbers.
---
You blobbed the shit out of us. You had every right to do so. This is eve. Hell you could have even blobbed harder. No one cares. We lost. We moved on.
---
Its funny tho that you keep saying you didnt blobbed lmao. this is why you get all these downvotes. I rly dont know what your goal is here fam.
---
yeah cause people in Null never farm with intel channels, response fleets and even rolling teams to close wormholes...
---
alternatively, if you farm and a sig pops and a hostile group wants to kill you, you need to hope your Siege cycle is nearly done or you're most likely dead as there's no backup, no one to save you and the vaunted 700mil per hour is on the provision you have sites sites to run of course.

Thats 690 pilots from the initial push. You seem to struggle slightly at math my dude
---
bad posting is good posting. welcome to Reddit and get integrated.
---
hey now that was uncalled for
---
me
---
&gt; The better alternative would be for the various lowsec entities to band together to fight Snuff,
---
they would still lose, badly. If you got all of calmiil and galmil together before the exodus from the WZ(assuming rdraw on snuff side) and pirates such as salt farmers, seven sins, etc it would not nearly have enough capital force, you could try to abuse TZs but at that point what you're even defending against? In the last year it seems like the only deterrent for snuff escalation was NC. and their ls staging was taken out already, which they didn't seem to care enough to even defend the hull.
---
And all this for what really? you aren't gonna evict snuff from ls, it's ls, the whole idea of open stations is core to its design and part of the charm, you could counter escalate them a bit i guess but are all those entities gonna be responsive to the call every time?
---
This is why people nowadays effectively don't even bother with snuff, just responding if absolutely forced to, the moment you need to rely on a shit ton of batphones to even compete all you're doing is turning the entire region into a half blue CTA nullsec cosplay, people come to ls to run away from this shit, might as well go back to null if they want this kind of gameplay.

So I am genuinely surprised that I liked this video. I expected some typical sped-up F1 mashing with shitty techno music and a 2 minute intro.

I love that you included the comms - that's always a plus and gives these videos some personality. I also love that the main perspective was from actual dictor piloting and not just boring DPS, so \o/ for that! Your music selection meshed well with the video and added to the overall experience as well. Lastly, I'm glad you didn't OPSEC censor a whole lot out so I didn't end up with 1/3rd of a black screen.

Trust me i regret talking to you guys from day 1 but once you are in you know... I dont care too much about reddit karma and i know all of wh space will downvote me forever and im fine with it (just what internet arguments are like)
---
The fight was clearly in your favor. I dont know how anyone watching the video could say otherwise. You fucked up cause you didnt know how to fight stukas and then just claimed to be blobbed there, posting the numbers from the last day of the eviction as "proof".
---
I'm a struggling artist.
---

---
it doesn't help that the payout for fighting against and trying to punch up is almost always a net loss even if you're very good, given that the cost of most doctrines seem to be roughly half the hull (that gets destroyed) and the other half the fit (which half gets destroyed). This is true for both sides of course but the one going against the odds will lose more I assume and therefore will have to do even more krabbing etc etc. If ccp could somehow make it so that the value of the hull was part of the drop in some way you'd see far more people pvping, because they would be able to afford it without krabbing to some extent, maybe even make a profit if they're very good.

No, they likely are paying more for their subscription than me if they're using plex compared to me just using cash since plex earns CCP more money than regular subscriptions.

---
Nothing is foolproof. But you can reduce your odds of getting ganked. 
---
First off, time decloaked is your enemy, especially in wormholes. In null at least you know who is in local. 
---
1) DO NOT SLOWBOAT BETWEEN CANS - Have a warp in tactical bookmark “tac” - drop the bookmark as you warp to the site - has to be at least 150km away to warp to. Warp to the tac, warp to the can. Repeat. 
---
2) Use a cargo scanner. Cherry pick cans. Don’t hack the ones that suck.
---
3) Align to a celestial when you are hacking. Warp immediately when you see something on dscan or on grid.
---
4) Spam dscan. Combat probes mean gtfo immediately. Sisters probes are a close second. Never assume that is just another explorer. Cloak up and wait it out.
---
5) Max up your hacking skills. Again, time hacking is not your friend.
---
6) Explore far from trade hubs. Exploring in wormholes near a trade hub is asking for it.
---
7) See if the holes immediately connected to the hole you are in are active or quiet. Are there structures? Are there pilots in them [the number in brackets when you mouse over it]? Are there a lot of signatures or very few? Are the entrances to the hole out of dscan range from you? Check the hole’s zkillboard - are explorers regularly on the menu? - all these bits of information can help you weigh the dangerousness of hacking in the particular hole and help maximize your chances of success.
---
Happy exploring and fly dangerously. o7
---
If you want local to dissapear, CCP must bring changes to the way cynos work. What makes the absence of local in Wormhole systems viable, is the fact that you can't use cynos in that space (well you can actually, but it's useless). 
---
♥Pando♥
---
Yep.  The more expensive you make the inevitable losses, the more people you push out of the game, and the more you promote blobbing.  People get very risk averse when the cost of losing is high.
---
yeah

I've just started getting into it and am realizing that a lot of the opponents are Gila, and lots running simple T2 fits (myself included). 
---
My advice is to run a baseline T2 Vedmak with no implants for a while to learn so losses aren't too bad when they happen. You often get 70m to 100m for the proving ground can, and even with a 50/50 winrate you could end up even.
---
If you've got tons of ISK, go nuts, but I'm not that baller. 😅
---
As someone who has been both the hunter and the prey, having lived in both wormhole and null, I would agree that null is often too safe; however, people who advocate simply removing local and otherwise leaving it as is are as entitled as the carebears themselves. We should have to put in work for our kills, and our prey should have the opportunity to react properly if they are actively at the keyboard. The amount of work we put in \*should\* be greater than our prey, because they have to be at attention for much longer. The prey should have a much greater awareness of their sorroundings, and we should be having to use cheeki breeki tactics to get around that awareness. Sure, this should be \*easier\* than it is now, but it definitely should not be \*easy\*.
---
In the very least, cloaky cyno alts should be made entirely non-viable, because they have an instant force projection potential with only their local presence as a warning. The magnitude of this projection potential can only be known with a level of intel that is unavailable to smaller groups (or with great stupidity in part of the hunters). The risk-benefit is also not balanced, because an entire bomber fleet with a blops bridge costs less than a decently fit carrier that they can melt in minutes.
---
It's not clear how nerfing this mechanic would work without fucking with cloak mechanics in a way that would negatively impact wh space. Auto-dscan has also been suggested, but that would only be part of the fix. Maybe new structures that can be upgraded at great cost to an extent where security in certain systems is even greater than what it is now, but this greatly benefits larger groups.
---
Realistically, CCP will change nothing, because as I've said in another thread any change to general vulnerability would cost them subs. Either from carebears leaving the game, or from alts whose existence is predicated on safety.
---
You are special.
---
I mean most of the other big pirate groups either left because lowsec is shit and ccp dont have the will to even try and fix it, or blued eachother up. But just saying "other people did it before snuff" doesnt mean that snuff arent the perpetrators of their own problem

---
the problem isn't really the loss of isk or the ship, the *vast* majority of pvpers would be fine with just downshipping or flying less blingy stuff if they couldn't affor a replacement, the problem is that you cannot build up to that replacement with pvp in any effective way, you gotta go krab up. The process of losing goes from: "oh I now gotta find a way to punch up with cheaper ships or engage better profiles" to "oh great now I gotta spin some more in a haven or do more missions".
---
mmmm Popcorn :)
---
Who mentioned a rorq?
---
so what? 
---
They can't handle the Truth !
---
this is the real problem, the "pirate" corps of low are really just carebears that want to mine in peace, not get good fights
---
Actually having aued for 15 years and spent most of my playing time in lowsec being pirates and then in FW then actually yeah I do actually no quote a lot about this game.
---
The fact is snowflakes  downvotes all you like truth hurts.  Snuff have been around for years and with them and Shadow they  made lowsec painful.  I am not saying that's a good thing but they really only lived In placid  and black rise areas.
---
I did say ccp should extend FW to ALL low sec to spread it.put more to help this.  But you simply can't say snuff is the problem.  The militias have a good.amount of people so fight back join forces have fun shooting snuff I n the face.  They would relish some content. 
---
You don't have to stay where you are.  Move..
---
.
---
Lowsec is supposed to be PvP heavenl not carebear heaven for farming your FW lp.
---
Can't fight back or won't fight back or simply wants them to go away then do something about it or just get out of the way.
---
There is PLENTY of lowsec systems away from them
---
Move away from the low sec FW hubs.
---
They are farming people because they can.  Either fight or starve them of content or move
---
 Your choice...
---
You simply cannot be a farmer or carebear in lowsec.  You must be PvP first.
---
Otherwise just move to null  if farming for isk is what you want..
---
Warp to group, press button, die. Like I said... uninspiring.
---
making isk is a pointless goal... the #s keep getting higher and you will never be satisfied. 
---
i stopped making isk 5years ago and told myself when i PVP it all away im done.... hasnt run out yet. 
---
granted i stopped playing for 3 years and turned all my liquid isk into plex cards (back when they were cards, @300m)
---
Killmails above and roaming delve makes it easy to see bots.
---
I am happy my video triggered PANDO enough to post this LMAO
---
I'm saying your "I bet" is shit. You don't bet anything, there is no way to know who win or lose, it's a a cheap and useless waste of time.
---
"I bet something with uncertain value god laughs at you when you die." &lt; that's the kinda post you just made.
---
Well yeah.  Expensive in game terms always means time spent not doing what you want to do, or using real world money to buy plex to buy ships.  So the problem is loss of isk, because that isk has to be replaced in order to replace the ship, which means the player has to part with real world money, or spend time doing something he doesn't want to do.  
---

---
Actually, I think removal of local would be a good thing. But not for the reasons of fighting bots, because it would instead give bots a better advantage over genuine players.
---
The people who think local would be detrimental for bots are just very short-sighted. In the long term, bots will use dscan and will make an intelligence network that will be way better than player-made. Then what are you going to do ? remove dscan ? Okay I for one think dscan should go, but still I don't think it would help legit player more than bots.
---
yea showing how you lost the 1 big engagement in this eviction really triggered him
---
OH SHIT, DID SOMEONE VIOLATE THE WHITEPAPER!?!
---
Bad doom
---
Thanks for that cruise volley raven pilot #978 
---
Making isk or at least offsetting losses don't necessarily mean you are doing something you ain't enjoying, people that unironically enjoy mining are still making money and enjoying themselves, if i'm forced to look for fights in a tristan instead of a bhaalgorn i'm still enjoying the pvp, the thing is that you can't realistically make money without minimizing the pvp. Money moons would offset that  I assume, that was before my time however.
---
If you say so champ. N+1 has been a thing forever, it's almost literally null warfare 101. CCP made lowsec more like null so lowsec adapted their tactics. Let me ask you this, why did both EE and SC have keepstars but Snuff/PM didn't? Because they were aligned with Pamfam, built up their n+1 and put up their Keepstars. Basically people are upset Snuff adapted differently than everyone else after LS was forced to change after structure revamp, and if you are ignoring the significance that change had on LS you're being willfully ignorant.
---
ok this is pretty cringe lol
---
so this post and him replying to every comment is coincidence XD
---
Hey just asking but is there any proof of this guy abusing input broadcasting to gain an advantage in pve or pvp?  or just the chat thing?
---
Yeah I’m online on the daily, my chat is fine right now
---
why? 
---
It pretty much does mean you are doing something you'd rather not be doing.  Even if you are mining and losing a ship, I guarantee you have a better use for that isk from mining than replacing that ship, so the time spent replacing that ship is still time you'd rather be mining to say, getting an improved ship, or paying for your monthly fee, or whatever.
---
Who's talking shit lol?
---
If you turn up with 1k+ dudes for a second time we're not gonna be any more capable of fighting than we were the first time.
---
Imagine being this triggered even after completing the eviction a month ago
---
Depends if you static is big enough to put a cap though but honestly if your in a wh corp it shouldn't be a problem. You should have a designated d-scanner on field and an alt at their fort or pos ( if those are even still a thing) and watch the undock. If they undock a cap have a saber defensive bubble. #problemssolved
---
You're just arguing the semantics when it's a figure of speech.

Who is that devilishly handsome Irish guy on coms....?

Hahahaha fuck man go back to pushing f1

given that they claim to be able to trace all the in-game items no matter how you try to launder them it should be no issue to follow the money and ban everything top to bottom.

You seem upset you should probably go talk with a therapist.

I dont see him responding to everything but ok num nuts.

shut up pussy
---
I see.  So it's more about getting him out of the region since he is causing economic damage and anxiety among members.  Got it
---
Even 100-200 bombers are going to melt any sort of capital force as you should know. You seem to have an issue with reddit not praising you for this operation, when in all honesty you should just sit back and enjoy all of the loot that you got. No one is really going to believe that you fought outnumbered or fought against the odds considering the actual numbers of players on each side. Also you guys came prepared to bash a citadel using a comp not even supers could counter, so there was really no chance to save either of the keepstars.
---
also write a script that repeats that every hour
---
What the actual fuck are you talking about? Do you understand how a cyno works?
---
So you you have never critiqued a movie, song or youtube video in your entire life?
---
submitted a ticket, hopefully it goes through! 3 bill is a lot of isk for me, im a small potato
---
When you stop doing something for  a period of time with the intention of returning to it later. That's called taking a break. I didn't realize language was a problem for you.
---
Also I can assure you that warping to a safe and cloaking up does save you. It's not "random" either because I actually watch D-scan so I know when someone is in system. (Which is precisely what I said, but again, language barrier apparently.)
---
Its cos mar5hy is a salty pleb and its fun to see his nerd rage
---
I can tell English is not your native language, or you're just naturally retarded. 
---
Dude, he is literally 22 of the 79 replies to that thread....
---
yes, but i'm talking about the action itself. Losing something in itself will never be a positive, but if the miner loses 100m isk doing what he enjoys he has all the isk he got from mining up to that point and can look forward to mining a bit more, something he enjoys already, maybe in a lower yield ship. If a pvper loses 100m isk odds are he didn't make enough in the first place to pay for it with the ship lost and he can look forward to doing something he dislikes just to go back to the core "fun" activity for him. Loot drops were supposed to be the thing paying for it but the way they're setup right now just makes it almost impossible.
---
Stukaaa :p
---
I mean a good dictor knows when to go to, say a wreck and bubble hostiles, as they try to escape.

half way through...ppl were pretty calm and sorted. actually surprised how professional ppl reacted especially keeping in mind only linemembers active
---
Stuka is short for "Sturzkampfflugzeug" which means "dive bomber".
---
lol
---
Well because of drops. Imagine what will happen if there is no more local but cynos keep working the way they are actually. You can't just  totally shift the way the game works for the sake of people wanting to kill farming ships.
---
Viable alternatives would be either a limited mass of ships being able to use a cyno before it "collapses" and having to light a new one. Other viable option would be a "universal" cyno, meaning anyone can drop on it, cause let's be honest, needing to be in fleet to use a cyno is ridiculous technically. 
---
ofc thanks
---
You are an idiot.
---
I don't think the miner sees it that way at all.  I really haven't met miners who mine for the sheer thrill of mining.  They are mining because it is a way to make ISK to do something else.
---
You are right... i suck at the reddit game :D
---

Is that all? Im sure 22 out of 79 is not responding to all.

can anyone hit me up with a solo vni bot hunter? I can fly small ships pretty decently. maybe a retribution or enyo? I also could fly something like a stork and boosh them off. just not sure about how to fit to break them and 'tank' the drones until they die.
---
&gt;I didn't get the joke, bah.... quick, better make a joke about mental health so people remember I'm in goons!
---
Switch it to ratter who likes ratting or mission runner who likes running mission or whatever if you can't fathom people enjoying sucking spod. If anything the officer fitted hisec mission runner kms should be enough to show that yes, some people do this things because they enjoy it, not for some ulterior motive.
---
dropping what? you can't drop a smart carrier, it should be aligned and in a world of no local it should be spamming dscan and warp as soon as you see someone you don't know. 
---
Rorquals have panic
---

Ich bin in Gorillakriegsführung ausgebildet und der beste Scharfschütze im deutschen Bundesheer. Du bist für mich nichts als ein weiteres Ziel. Ich werde dich mit einer nie zuvor gesehenen Präzision vom Antliz dieser Welt tilgen, merk dir meine verdammten Worte. Du denkst du könntest hier im Internet so eine Scheiße über mich erzählen und damit durchkommen? Denk lieber nochmal darüber nach, du Wichser. Während wir uns hier unterhalten, habe ich schon mein geheimes Netzwerk aus Spionen kontaktiert und deine IP-Adresse wird grade rückverfolgt, also mach dich besser auf den Sturm gefasst, du Made. Der Sturm, der das erbärmliche kleine Ding, das du als dein "Leben" bezeichnest, auslöschen wird. Du bist verdammt nochmal tot, Junge. Ich könnte jederzeit überall sein, und dich auf über siebenhundert verschiedene Arten töten, nur mit meinen bloßen Händen. Aber ich bin nicht nur im unbewaffneten Kampf ausgebildet, ich habe auch Zugriff auf das Waffenarsenal der Bundeswehr und ich werde es aufs Vollste ausschöpfen, um deinen elendigen Arsch von diesem Kontinent zu blasen, du kleiner Scheißkerl. Wenn du nur gewusst hättest, was für eine apokalyptische Rache dein kleiner "witziger" Kommentar provoziert hat, hättest du vermutlich dein verdammtes Maul gehalten. Aber nein, das hast du nicht hinbekommen, das wolltest du nicht, und jetzt wirst du dafür bezahlen, du verdammter Idiot. Du wirst in meinem Hass ertrinken. Du bist tot, Junge. 
---
Here, take my downvote. I'm basically a wormholer, right?
---
&gt; dropping what? you can't drop a smart carrier
---
Did you once try to hunt a carrier ? If yes, you are doing it wrong, if no, your answer is logic. You might be the smartest ever, it's not the only thing that will determine if you live or die. For the Rorqual part, i'm not going to comment that because I consider the panic as an aberration since day one.
---
&gt; You can still jam systems
---
Sure, but jams are both an advantage and a disadvantage.
---
&gt; I see your point but it would just be another episode of adapt or die
---
Isn't it what EVE is all about in the end ? Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be bothered that much if there wasn't a local since I use scouts to secure my ratting, I don't need a local ultimately, but things like that need work, you can't do it like a wreck because people are yelling like retards "EVE has no content, the game is dying", there is plenty of content in the game other than PvE ships. 
---
Nice deflection. So going back to your line of logic, have you ever held an opinion about something you haven't created?
---
Your spodbrain is showing

I can tell this leads nowhere, so next time you have retard thing to say, please keep it for your family or anyone else that can help you. I can't.

I compiled the relevant links I believe. Reddit makes it a pain though to search specific date ranges since [they removed the timestamp search feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/6w7tzs/how_to_search_for_posts_from_a_specific_date_range/dm72qgs/) a year or so ago, so I had to look through my upvote history.

Beat quote ever "its good we built 150 carriers in here to counter those 170 ravens".... how did that work out???
---
I'm sorry but you are incorrect. The majority are bots simply due to how scalable they are. Roam any region that has 'renters' or a feeder alliance and you'll find rampant botting. 
---
Yes there are people who 'afk' rat in Vni's but they're vastly outnumbered by their robotic brethren. 
---
more about the issue really, people complain miners use broadcast to avoid getting killed by people like BB, then a marshy gets seen blatantly using broadcast and ...\*crickets\*
---
Are you guys still crying about this? LOL, get a life.
---
This is quality entertainment....
---
Some context:
---
Most PD analysis is 'No Transit', i think more than half. the rest is usually pointing at 1 spike with unknown orbital time. Sometimes you get these analysis with 1 explanet with rotation less than a month, so you see a bunch of downward spikes in rhytmn. 
---
This analysis had a ton of downward spikes, I started out thinking it was 1 planet orbiting its star very fast, but couldnt allign the spikes, so I figured, maybe there are two planets. Still i couldnt explain all spikes, so I introduced a third planet, this cost me about 10 min, feeling good I hit 'Confirm' only to be greeted by this screen, I misplaced one of the planets a tiny bit, on this monster of an analysis, and get a score reduction regardless :(
---
so since there's no way to prove he uses input broadcasting for anything malicious then the "witch hunt" by imperium &amp; co. is unjustified?
---
I mean, I don't really care for marshy either
---
I tell you what... 150 carriers wouldnt be the answer but they would be able to hold hole control long enough to bring in the answer
---
Thats ofc... if you got the balls to try

Welch eynen verschissenen Unfug schicktest du dich zur Hölle nochmal an, über das heilige römische Reych in die Welt herauszuthragen, du Lustknabe?

Geschuhlth im Kleynkrieg sowie als ersther Arkebusier des Exercitus Imperii bist du nichts denn einer weytheren Ordre. Mit einer von Christenouge ungeschauter Genauigkeyth, wird das von mir für dich zugedachte Ende seyn, so wahrhafftig mir der allmächtige Herrgotth beysteht. Gibst Du dich wahrlich dem Irrglauben hin, sondergleychen Deppeschen an das Publikum richten zu vermögen imstande zu seyn? Bedenk deynen Irrtum, Dirnenbock! Just als du dieser Zeylen lesend ansichtig wirst, fand meine congregatio occulta von Ränkeschmieden in allen Reichslanden bereyths die Lage deyner Scholle, also erwahrthe den Sturm, du Schweinehund. Der Sturm, derer das gar Lächerliche hinforth wehet, was dir als deyn Leben zu bezeychnen gefällig ist. Du bist verschiszen toth, Bursche. Ich vermag dich immer und überall in hundert Weysen zu erschlagen und das nur Kraft meyner blanken Hände. Nicht genug, als der Christenheyth besther Schwertfürer geboren zu seyn, auch das gesammelte Arsenal des teutschen Keysers Heer seynd mir zu Händen gereycht; dies dargeboten wird es meynem Anschickem nützlich seyn, das dir von Gott zugetheilte ärschlich anmuthend Antlitz aus Evropa zu thilgen. Wärest du im Wissen um die unheiligen Consequencia deiner Publicatio gewesen, vielleicht hätte deiner listig Zunge Kunde keyne zukünftig Damnatio geborgen.

They could try to adapt sure but realistically the best adaption would be gate watchers which can be fooled (lack of client data that can be mined) and dscan bots which have counters like cloakies and combat recons.

not really, people are upset that snuff has killed all content in the area, whether that would happen if it was SC in their place or whatever matters little. You said it yourself that snuff straight up doesn't care, and that's a 100% valid position to take, but so is the position of people criticizing said lack of care for the region. 
---
If you really don't care about the region's content and that's the position you actually hold that's fine, just stop trying to justify it at the same time as if your hand was forced on the issue.
---
You are allowed to use input broadcasting for the setup of your clients.  There is no evidence he was actively playing when this happened.

Outside of a wormhole use a cyno inhibitor and quit bitching.

But hurr dur local removal does not effect bots, as they just spam d-scan... yeah get fucking real, it is time to delay local through out null and low sec.
---
I love it. Not the outcome but the video. Charge of the light brigade was perfect for what was to come and despite knowing the outcome I was almost getting the shakes just from watching. 
---
And a big hat tip for putting out a video with a less than favorable outcome. It is a great illustration of how quickly things can go horribly wrong, just from one action.
---
&gt;Did you once try to hunt a carrier ? If yes, you are doing it wrong, if no, your answer is logic. You might be the smartest ever, it's not the only thing that will determine if you live or die. 
---
Have been both hunter and prey, you can't really catch a carrier unless the carrier pilot is shit
---
&gt;For the Rorqual part, i'm not going to comment that because I consider the panic as an aberration since day one.
---
Yes.
---
&gt;Isn't it what EVE is all about in the end ? Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be bothered that much if there wasn't a local since I use scouts to secure my ratting, I don't need a local ultimately, but things like that need work, you can't do it like a wreck because people are yelling like retards "EVE has no content, the game is dying", there is plenty of content in the game other than PvE ships.
---
There are a lot of reasons to remove/delay local, i haven't seen "eve has no content" as one of them
---
^This guy, he make me feel cool.

Did you check online to see if it was closed or attached? Unless they need more information from you they probably wont send a message back.

If its closed it means they fixed it or they dont agree that theres a bug based on what you sent them.

Im pretty sure if its attached it means its a bug they know about and your report was just added onto the information they already have about the bug.

The entire German army wasn't nazi/SS. Those ones were only a small fraction of the German army. Stukas were flown by luftwaffe, aka air force and not SS troops. Also it was difficult to keep saying Sturzkampfflugzeug so Stuka was a much easier name. So easy that all the other armies, axis and allied also called them Stukas like the Americans called certain Japanese planes Zeros.

Maybe you should dive into a real history book before you start accusing people of being nazi supporters.

It's where I've lived for about 6 years now, and while I've had other homes on alts, my main stays here.

As for my main-alt, I'd say either Edder, where my first actual home in Eve was, or Prism, where I put down one of the first stations in Black Rise.
---
The changes were what allowed snuff to be as dominant as they are, but your tactics havent changed at all, same shit different day. Snuff/SC/EE (and others big pirate gatecamping/super owning groups) have always been closer to carebears than pvpers, where you want the assets of a big nullsec group but are too afraid to pvp against them, so you sit around lowsec with no real rivals.

Huh? I never said wormholes are risk free,the risks are just different. Also you make more is per hour BECAUSE of the increased risk. This is known as game balance. However, just as in null there are ways to mitigate that risk. It's not the thunderdome.
---
Hahaha what a fucking retard
---
You're missing the point, the BOT didn't pay. Some other player, who will CONTINUE playing did, if the bot gets banned the purchaser will continue to play regardless. The ONLY impact would be a decrease in the price of plex on the market.

It depends on the normal life of the wormhole.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/into-the-known-unknowns
---
Specifcially...Although K162 signatures will not appear as soon as a player warps to them (as they do currently), they will have a random chance to appear every several minutes once the wormhole connection has less than 15 hours of natural lifetime remaining. This tends to be about four hours.
---
Alright so we've actually had something a bit more high effort than usual in the works for this years best of r/eve. That required more work and we've been busy so naturally it took longer.
---
However, Jin's thread is pretty decent and this is kind of half of what was planned anyways. So we will make this a 'pseudo' official part 1 of the best of r/eve 2018 and incorporate the results into the next 'official' thread when we get everything compiled / figured out. I talked to Jin on it and he's going to mostly run the show in this thread. As always, no top level comments - only replies to Jin's categories. All others will be removed.
---
Jin isn't actually the first to submit this but he's the first to do it when we were asleep. As promised for being an outstanding guy doing a neat thing for the community - honorable mention to /u/-Paxom- for attempting this as well.
---
Yes, thank you. He never came back after that lmao
---
We get it dude, Goons can casually form more then the entirety of wh space can pre ping for.  Would you like a medal?

As seen in the video... you had 300 toons of which 180 or so were in the subcap fleet so keep spinning........

don't think this game or sub are the place for you, might I suggest hello kitty online?

Thank you very much for your recommendation :)

Apologies for not having made more art this year.

People see what they want to see. I had a blast. I don't need or want folks kissing my feet. I'm just having fun.

Yes, which makes players less likely to buy plex for ISK - a major income stream for CCP. If plex buys you less in game goods people are less likely to buy them to exchange for isk.

What am I spinning? 300 - 180 != 150
---
Even then, you're gonna assume that the 120 remainder were *all* carrier pilots? Or that all of those could fly whatever carriers were ready?
---
You're making a lot of assumptions that this was doable.
---
This wasn’t actually interesting at all. I mean, unless you were trying to prove you had a spy, I don’t see why you released this. 
---
Sorry your feelings got hurt over the internet, you little snowflake bitch 
---
well it is and it isn't, bots frequently are involved in RMT schemes, so by getting rid of bots CCP would in theory make more money by removing an illegitimate way of getting isk in game, while decreasing the price of plex by getting rid of bots who drive the demand for plex higher than it should be would help out real players. Its a win win from their point of view which is why their failure to take meaningful anti-bot action is so confusing.
---
Except 85% of our content comes for big null blocks. We lost 316.93b last month and 569.50b the month before. Those are a massive number of losses, especially when compared to null blocks. We killed 5.5+t, yes trillion, over the last two months. There is no way you can get that number "oppressing" lowsec. The people who claim we "oppress" them have had zero fleet fights against us. Look it up, CalSF, you won't find a single BR with us vs them but that's the narrative they use despite us flying in complete opposite tz's. We live in Lowsec cause it's centralized, everything is 3-4 mids away, were in null you have to do 5 to 8 mids to maybe get a fight. This last post shows me that you are arguing a narrative and have no idea actually what you are talking about as you didn't even bother to look up what we are killing and decided just to make an argument off your feelings and opinions. I won't be monitoring this comment line anymore as it's pointless to discuss anything when they want to argue with feelings and opinions.
---
These are the only videos I want yt to notify me about
---
wouldn't work, as soon as they make it a predictable event or give advance notice it will happen the bot users just don't log in for the time they know they will be vulnerable.
---
i mean incursions show that ccp have the ability to make pve spawns unpredictable and dangerous if you don't react to them appropriately - tcrcs for instance are kind of hellish if your logi aren't awake

if you switch over from the old anom model of "the rats agro one thing and pretty much just shoot that" to the incursion model, it instantly becomes harder to bot

Checking in
---
yeah its not like we didn't see dozens and dozens of VNI's dying in renter space all over eve last night or anything. And yes that one guy did lose a pile of macks in goon space, but if you check his killboard you'd know that's happened to him more than once before and that was when local was working so why'd he die then if he's a local dependent bot?
---
no reason botting supers couldn't do sanctums, but, it would throttle them a bit
---
rock havens are generally considered the ideal anom for supers (and boson ratting) as all the rats spawn in the same location, meaning you don't waste any time boating fighters around in between waves
---
ring sanctums are still pretty good, the spawns change positions but you make up the lost isk/hr moving fighters with the additional high bounty bs rats
---
the other sanctums are downright atrocious for anything
---
so basically you get 1 or maybe 2 ring sanctums in a system at a time, as opposed to ~5 rock havens
---
if you have to sit around and wait for them to respawn, it becomes much less attractive of a proposition to bot a super and run them 24/7
---
you might, instead, bot a boson titan, which is significantly riskier but capitalizes much better on blitzing one anom then waiting off the respawn timer
---
which would be much more fun to hunt
---
He's been killed several times while local was working so....
---
He was logged in...thats not setting up your clients or loading with a script
---
but if he's a local dependent bot how do you explain the other two times he died when local was still working normally? 
---
From what I was told, They were considered leadership in their Corp. Not Init. 
---
tapi doesn't really have any active stratop fcs outside of progod other than maybe farmstink but he's actual hot garbage and i really can't say that enough

All this time and you still can't back up the 50% claim with any actual evidence.
---
No. I assure you. They were nervous. You didn't come in "small shit." You came in a doctrine specifically designed to fuck up their capital fleet. 
---
not true, as F2P and P2W games have shown people willing to pay for an advantage are not significantly affected when prices are increased.
---
https://i.imgur.com/wk8AgdZ.png
---
and lets not forget the amount of bombers they had, they'd probably almost alpha the carriers and take out the pods.
---
You didn't touch my assets. I have never been in Hard Knocks my friend. 
---
Who was the NAZI guy?
---
Unironically in terms of behind the scenes modwork, Chevis was actually one of the best.

Except he is using the software beyond running a script etc to load clients...hes running input broadcasting while logged in.  He has the option not to but chooses to have input broadcasting enabled

---
cheeerzah my brav!
---
You absolutely can be aligned while hacking. You get to the can, you align, then you begin hacking. Aligning just faces your ship towards a warp out point. After your ship turns stop your ship and scan. 
---
r/eve majority have spoken - even Chevis cannot beat me this time 
---
No
---
How so?
---
What happened when they visited last week. (Dam someone leaving excavators out)
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=2609&amp;b=8426700&amp;e=90&amp;t=ref
---
If there is a single person in system with you, you need to be aligned out. So that your ship does not have to turn to the location of a warp.
---
Knock the speed of the ship down to 1%, so aligning does take you out of 5km. You can also use a higs rig, that reduces your top speed. You warp at 75% of your top speed, so reducing it makes you warp faster.
---
That adapt thing would be wise in the real world. But this happened in the game we like and care about - which doesn't mean necessarily that you have to adapt.
---
In this case adapting meant putting a bullet into EVE.
---
It's not Snuffed Out fault that everything is in complete Titan shit right now - but joining Goons and following the advice of nullsec idiots - come on guys, you all know you could end up much much much better than that.

I mean anything made exclusively from minerals is, thanks rorquals.
---
Nyx for less than 15b in reputable alliances, Erebus for under 50b.
---
At 100m/hr that's less than 500 hours for an endgame ship and really most should be making more than 100m/hr.
---
I spend maybe 30 mins a week updating market orders and easily make a few bill every week basically doing nothing.
---
Forcing people to use things like ESS could be a could improvement. IE massively hitting ratting tax output and increasing ESS value/hp so it becomes something worth fighting over while also being important.
---
Why not?

Please stop posting about stupid shit like this lol. Look we blobbed some small gang dudes. Durrrrrr
---
GF theraboys, thanks for stopping by.
---
Thats why they don't make it predictable or give any advanced notice.  Just "at some point every month Concord will activate the Anti-Bot beam" and all detected bots will be zapped to hisec with suspect status.
---
If anything the axe hanging constantly mght even put any of them off.
---
EVE Client Settings is one of the things you are allowed to do.  That requires actively being in the client.
---
xd snuff think they dont krab more than 99% of people in the game (that arent goons)
---
This battle is very reddit worthy.  
---
that might work for supers/carriers because of the amount of skills needed to fly it, but for all the sub cap bots it won't do a thing because in the time between beams they are going to make what they lost back plus enough to inject their next bot plus a who lot more.
---
hey. any good leaks from the directors channel?
---
Really interested to see how long they knew about it for
---
Christ on a POGO STICK! 
---
Not heard that before, love it. Using it.
---
Not even that - one was inactive aside from the seeding, two were keeping their heads down as POSPY line members (and occasional skirmish FCs), and Riven is a linemember as I said. The only leadership involved with organizing it were the CEOs of BIGSH and Pando. 
---
Squizz you are the one constant good in life.
---
There's actually quite a bit of small gang and roaming content in black rise, even despite the periodic hotdropping. Enough people do legit solo or small gang stuff (myself included) that people keep coming for more. Sure there are people in snuff that only drop titans on cyno bait, but all you gotta do is stick to the FW plexes to avoid that.
---
Also, for Snuff in a larger sense, most of our fleet combat is outside black rise.
---
Either use the in-game fitting tool (for ease of use) or use the much more powerful and flexible 3rd party app PyFA: [https://github.com/pyfa-org/pyfa/releases](https://github.com/pyfa-org/pyfa/releases)
---
/u/MwH_Loki coins the term "to cornetto" smth.
---
&gt; The fact that root vegetable groups literally only have to cyno in, aim a cornetto and remove entite subcap fleets doesn’t seem kinda unhealthy to you? I fear the spodbrain has rooted too deeply in you.

Hey welcome back Jack.
---
Never thought I'd agree with a goon but here we are.
---
I would imagine it more as a centralized constellation structure. Owners choose who gets local instantly and who gets it delayed by #upgradeLevel seconds (max 10?).
---
Attackers can entosis it to make it so that they get less delay and eventually instant local, this also incurs delayed local on the owners up to a cap. Obviously should be harder for attacker and give notice to owners like current sov.
---
Bam! A new small-scale fight generating beacon that rewards active defense with increased safety. 
---
Make the effects clear to both attackers and defenders: 
---
"X alliance has a Constellation Intelligence Hub, you are experiencing 10s local delay"
---
or
---
"X alliance has a Constellation Intelligence Hub, you are receiving instant local intel"
---
"A Constellation Intelligence Hub is under contest, you are ..."
---
Because they can, and what is most important part here because CCP want them to have those alts to keep sub number higher.         
---
Like one move from CCP and all drone orbit and forget ships are gone... just make rats attack drones much more.        
---
I think it comes from the fact that init likely expected the rest of wormhole space to cheer on such an eviction when in reality every wormhole corp in eve went yeah time to start rage rolling. 
---
Meaning the whole narrative of being the people that set wormhole space free from the evils of HK kinda went to shit and they came off looking like the assholes that were lighting fires in somebody else his yard, couple this with a lack of outrage from HK, where most members just went yeah I guess we're moving to a new hole, and I can somewhat empathize with the frustration most init line members must feel. 
---
Supers are around 10b
---
People enjoyed this because others fucked up. If local is down I would just place a clocked camper on gate and warp when the gate flashes.
---
PvE players won't suddenly become people that will fight you. Removal of local will just make it harder for new players who don't have a alt yet, every one else won't care.
---
If you don't like local, wormhole space is a thing for a reason.
---
If it can be installed on citadel, by default enabled in NPC space - also working in WH space.        
---
Like you know every one get the same treatment 
---
Got to see it live! Don't know where my name is on the BR though haha
---
also by too afraid to pvp against them i meant too afraid to actually try and live in null permanently, sure you can hide behind the "we want to be central so we go in lowsec" but then you are just defending that the only content snuffed want to do is hotdropping people with a super fleet, which is exactly what is killing lowsec
---
"We dropped 2 Titans, 11 Carriers, 8 Supercarriers, and 2 Dreads against 6 T3C's and 7 Sabres, tell me I'm elite Mom"
---
Aye so a guy running L4's and nothing else could have a super in 100 hours...
---
Really makes you think
---
I mean there's *tons* of possible goals in this game, as there always have been. If you want something new, maybe try running abyssal sites. Tier 1 and 2 ones are easy-peasy, whereas T5s require cruisers fit with billions of ISK in blingy mods and implants, so it's a pretty long progression and lucrative as well. 
---
The great part is now we have a static null we can roll over and over every couple minutes.  Our grind to find content has been extremely reduced.
---
Make chevis mod again so he can be the best mod
---
Nope, I don't know anything about that.
---
Hey fuckheads, instead of arguing over which group has more bots or which mindless smear of VNI ratters is more likely to be botting; how about you just go out and kill some shit? Kill bots! Kill things that might be bots! Kill things that are AFK!   
---
Stop Crying. Stop trying to shoehorn a anti-(alliance ticker here) narrative. Just go out there and fart on them bois. 
---
wanted to post that higsec burners are 100mil/h easily ... then calculated that it is 100h at this assumption ...        
---
Yeah.           
---
Think about this: CCP want BR level battles more often to get bigger media attention.           
---
Cheap capitals are good way to achieve this.            
---
AYYY
---
It's great we have faxes in game so you can do this with 0 risk to your titans
---
Hello there
---
Oh great, it's this myth again. No matter how many extra sensors you put on your bot it would still die to combat recons, stop bubbles, people logging in in system, logon traps, or people coming in through wormholes.
---
And you speak like human ratters dying is a problem.
---
luftwaffe, was likely the least clean of the German forces mainly because Germany had next to no airforce when the Nazis took power so unlike the rest of the army so most officers in the luftwaffe where selected by the nazi's this meant that a Nazi sympathy of the luftwaffe was higher than any other branch of the German military.

---
Are you daft? He has yet to deny or even mention krabbing. I am sure snuff KNOWS they krab a lot as they have to fund all their supers and titans. You're trying WAY to hard mate.
---
To be fair I never said there isn't a botting problem. Botting is an issue without a doubt. But that "Half of Eve is bots" thing is not a random statement I pulled out of my ass. I pulled that directly from a new player who was considering subscribing but was terrified of over half the game being literal bots. We both know it's not anywhere near that scale but we both know that it's still a problem.
---
imagine being so shit that you need to drop 6 supercarriers and 2 titans to kill a single legion and 10 sabres
---
Good shit as always my dude. HABIT is, as always, recruiting.
---
It's still in open status like it hasn't even been reviewed yet.

clubbing 
---
Perhaps, even at the risk of more node crashes and soul crushing tidi. Both of which do not result in player enjoyment.
---
It's also a little short sighted, personally I think it accelerates us towards a serenity style stalemate, something that I consider to be absolutely abhorrent.
---
Is sacrificing the health of the day to day game worth the occasional media attention? That's for CCP to decide.
---
Except for the time you sought out the identity of the dude who didn't follow your narrative.  Except that time you didn't need people kissing your feet.  
---
If you live in a wormhole, you might want to consider doing small volume-high value items to reduce the amount of hauling you’ll have to do, and use low industry taxes in your wormhole to make a better profit margin. 
---
You should also consider doing PI. Since you don’t have to compete with other people, you can extract a huge amount of P0 out of planets and improve it up to P3 or P4 which is super easy to haul due to its small size. 
---
When I mine rich plag in high sec the asteroids are roughly between 4,000m3 and 12,000m3. How big are the asteroids in null sec? Arkonor, bistot, crokite and mercoxit for example? Are they significantly bigger or the same kind of size?
---
c2/c6 or c2/c6?
---
Nullsec players are the biggest carebears in the game, they will never let you remove local because then how would all the f1 monkeys afford their supers without knowing how to play?
---
They had to target the Tristan. :(

"be aligned" refers to moving at warpable speed towards a warpable object.
---
if your ship is stopped the direction its facing is irrelevant, you will take the same amount of time to get into warp regardless
---

---
Impass doesn't need your faxes, when was the last time TEST got pinged to drop faxes here?
---
Imagine being so shit that you yolo 13 dics into 2 supers and tackle already on grid to hold a Rorqual for 20 drecks after we literally just dropped 30 caps on you last week
---
This does not work. Align time is constant no matter which direction you’re facing. 
---
Being in that beachhead fleet was memorable, almost all of us had no clue where we would be going, and all the pieces the logi guys had put in place for us.
---
So I guess you'd be best worst former mod?
---
... (This is starting to become spaceballs material)
---
I vaguely remember hearing about that. I'll be honest, I only saw a little coverage but I guess that some is more than none.
---
Why do you say: "meant to happen" ?
---
Most WHers don't know who I am or care enough to dog me on reddit. But hey - that's the job. 
---
Brisc Ruble would like to know your location.
---
because it didn't happen after, but who cares what is after this days
---
You guys all misunderstood why I pinged for that guy to talk to me. He'd said in another comment that he was forced to vote for me, and I wanted to find out why he said that. 
---
I don't give a shit what folks say on reddit. It's reddit. 
---
I just wanted to be rich!
---
Who cares about the narrative when you've won?
---
given how many issues they have had with botting compared to the minuscule response outside their PR stunt I wonder if they even have the tools to do what you are suggesting.
---
agree with that.
---
However, you can orbit the can 2500m, this way when someone appears you can cloak at once, OL MWD, activate it, and take a direction away.

Local was broken today. These same VNI are warping before you can land inties in the plex every other day. Then local breaks and it's fucking Armageddon. 
---
Very very different mate. We've all been on both sides of the blade. 
---
Oh. Right.  I forgot.
---
We're totally not rolling for your rorqual alts.
---
No sir.
---
Can confirm, I'm a mega bear. 2 Rorqs, 3 Hulks, and 2 lvl5 mission runners. Dreads and titans don't fund themselves.
---
&gt;haha they need bubbles to hold the rorq what suckers, they lost an entire 1b worth of dictors!
---
&gt;haha we needed 30 caps to fail to kill a 20 man subcap gang
---
That's some next level retardation right there.
---
Remove local
---
That's a little depressing. What caused it not to happen?
---
You don't warp out until you get up to 75% of your speed. It doesn't matter what direction your ship is pointing. It's still going to take the same amount of time to align.
---
Wew, killed a few subcaps with a Titan, Supers and carriers, elite AF.

Tells you a bit about their culture and the type it attracts.

I can tell you for a fact that the super, the carrier, and the smartbombers killed in Period Basis were all bots.
---
The SBers sayed on grid doing nothing for 10 minutes dying to 2 frigates and a dictor. 
---
The Hel launched/pulled fighters every 30 seconds like clockwork, and never shot a soul.
---
The Thanatos would launch fighters, only ever shooting 1 guy (the initial tackle on grid), before pulling them with MWD if they got shot by anything. 
---
Referring to goons as "such a small group". lolwut
---
&gt; The major culprit seems to have been server instability. 
---
Perhaps needs to be sorted before pushing more major slugfests.
---
the point being they never had a chance to do anything and they should've known it without even dropping on them they would've gotten murdered. you cant criticize us for our "elite pvp skills" when you yolo ships into an engagement you know you cant win. learning when to engage and when to fuck off is literally 90% of pvp in eve.

I don't understand the war going on in the comments of this post. Did the attackers do something wrong by evicting HK? Was there a larger than normal amount of shit-talk going on over this after the fact, for some reason?

 Not wrong.

This is good b/c it's accurate.

A sig that has hundreds of people in it isn't a "small group".

Nope! Jump in any time. You get double points for the first 10 entries each day, so it's easy enough to get through the first few ranks. And there's no competitive part that'll mean it matters where you are related to other people. 
---
Even if you just do it to kill some time waiting on that manufacturing job to complete, or while jumping through a high sec route, it's ok isk once you get your accuracy up (once you're over 90% it works out about 3.5mil per rank, which is less than 40 entries, if you're not including the first 10 bonused ones), and as you rank up there's rewards: the skins and clothes don't go for much, but there's BPCs that go for a good amount because they're so rare (Pacifier, Monitor, and Marshal, all 1run but go for 9-10 figure sums each). In fact, if you get that far in, you'll find you're better off than those who did it early, as once someone has ranked past the BPCs on all characters, they can't go again without getting a new char, so with less doing it now, there's way less supply and prices go up!

"blobbed"  they actually had more numbers we just brought bigger stuff. Also, saying a 20-30 man dreck fleet is a "small gang" is a bit disingenuous. They were attempting to whale not looking for a 'gf' .  
---
The post isn't us bragging about our leet pvp skill its us saying, "lol why are Tuskers so bad"  
---
well maybe if that's what you tried to meme about it would have made sense

instead it's just hollow so you have to strawman
---
I highly doubt all 560 are bots though, there would be plenty of spod brains still afk ratting like bads 
---
Legacy pets once again proving how cringey they are.
---
People complaining don't realize the same thing is happening in null, just in slower motion. Low sec is now dominated by a single group, and it's not that group's fault. The game is no longer growing, it's actually shrinking. So the rich will get richer and everyone else will die/quit.  
---
miss fighting you guys though :(

you can't make this shit up
---
it unfortunately highlights a real problem with eve when denial of kills is preferable to entertainment. Can you image how much fun it would be to have the mindset of "its already lost anyway, lets see how much fun we can have?" instead of "trash everything so hostiles don't get killmails".
---
Just a bit! Thats gotta be some serious resists and that roided xl booster (i hope hes rocking a full crystal set &amp; pills too),
---
How much dps does that site deal/ how many people are meant to run fob sites? 
---
Eh to be honest Pando, I like you. It is a shame to see you spinning. Overall, I think we will have to agree to disagree. At this point, ima call off my posting. I feel like you have a mental requirement to respond to each and every comment. Therefore, this is one less comment chain you have to follow. Good luck. I look forward to Init.'s next campaign. Regardless of opinions, you guys do provide your members some good content and shake eve up. Just don't spin it ;) You fucked em up. End of story. End of Narrative.
---
I don't think you understand what he was saying. Caps can't jump if they're bubbled. Obviously that won't work in places like delve, but it works on smaller scales or deployments. 
---
For example, at the end of the faction fortizar thing in provi, skillu baited out a test Titan. A massive cap fleet undocked from the staging fort to save him. They were met by dictors and hictors bubbling everything. We got to watch the Titan die in a fire. 
---
Atleast we have the balls to fight. Unlike Yall you only take fights you win.

The "attached" state pretty much means exactly that.
---
Mostly the later.  Init did a great job on the logistics of the eviction.  Brought massive numbers we couldn't practically contest.  It was well done.  
---
But rather than being content with a well run eviction and the loot, they wanted to spin it as some glorious display of elite tactical pvp,  and most of reddit, baring their goon leash holders, kinda collectively rolled their eyes and called bullshit.
---
you have gr8 taste
---
muh eviction
---
HK man bad!
---
20 to 30 man is a small gang fleet. But for this, you actually need to be outside of shitty blocks like your, Darkness or Goons who know nothing else than dropping their shitty caps at anything that comes by, afterwards crying "GNUGNUGNU blueballs EVE is dead no content". 
---
Has there been a fight that was Space Violence vs Panfam exclusively?
---
Should link all the times they've lost big ships to npcs. Aka the titan and other marshal that Yasmin lost
---
You are proud of this?
---
Brave Newbies is dead.
---
Exactly. And then whining that they can't kill the USS Nimitz with a handful of speedboats.
---
Well that could be fun
---
Maybe you should try to win more fights
---
I'm fairly sure the two "greened" planets are the same, might have just needed to twist it slightly on the fold to get them to line up. The other "planet" is just star noise.
---
Your score will jump and drop a lot at that rank, don't worry too much. As you go on, the changes for success and failure get way tiny. Plus, you do get 'points' for green as well as losing them for red and yellow, so even though it's saying "failure", the bits you got right haven't been wasted, and will still be counted even if it just offset the lost accuracy points.
---
And TNT 
---
Not anymore
---
Oh great, it's that list of irrelevant items again.
---
Combat Recons - Still visible when they enter system, so alphas on gates catch them, plus expensive and easy to kill.  Please use them near me.
---
Stop bubbles - Show up on dscan.
---
People logging in system / logon traps - Show up on D-scan unless you use the aforementioned combat recons, in which case we go back to killing them.  Also, these are basically the same thing.
---
People coming in through wormholes - Very rare that the wormhole is in your system, plus of course dscan, still.  Bots can absorb these losses just fine.  If, somehow, the number of rolling groups suddenly skyrocketed and it actually became a weekly occurrence even, there's nothing stopping a bot from doing the same thing paranoid human ratters do, safe up when a new sig pops up.
---
Human ratters dying - If, somehow, hunters suddenly greatly multiplied in numbers and abilities (which is doubtful, so this is probably irrelevant anyway), then when human ratters lose profitability but bots keep farming away, it gives the bots greater buying power proportionately.  If your goal in removing local is to hurt bots, this is the exact opposite of what you want;  you want bots to die while actual players keep living, so that the bots are less profitable.  
---
You can make arguments about removing local (i'll still disagree overall, but at least they're kind of valid), but as a tool for hurting bots, it is not effective.
---
I am a returning player. I have never been very good at outfitting my own ships and I believe that will especially hold today. I have a moderate amount of SP, namely in Caldari and would like to run PvE missions mostly for now.

Is there a public XML document holding a bunch of decent builds that one could import to PYFA out there? Google hasn't been very kind to my ventures looking for inspiration, and I don't have the know-how to correctly identify what is good and total shit while looking for inspiration on zkill.
---
What would you guys recommend for me?
---
Ah, I can certainly see this a few other recent posts. That's unfortunate that some people have to loudly stroke their ego instead of just bask in whatever thing they had done quietly. Certainly a better way to retain some respect from others instead of making them look at you like a dickhead :P

Really? Everyone I’ve talked to has said that t1 frigs are where the main PvP is at
---
I can already see the narrative of Init.  (Imperium coming to whore) v. Frat. - "We thought they would bring all of China." 
---
yeah, they just managed to do more than whole of gotg against goons
---
I read this as I’m driving home and now I’m heartbroken.
---
Dammit, I have to mostly agree with a StainGuy post.... crap.
---
But no, @OP, Null sec should be as dangerous or safe as the group living in it makes it, as long as they can keep it that way from someone else who may want to take it.
---
Encourage there to be no need for 6000 to be on one grid. But it's a little late for that.
---
Always funny how goons &amp; pets like to downplay themselves as Davids fighting the impossible Goliath odds. 
---
Granted, in this case it's not as bad as that hilarious Hard knocks AAR though.

Elite pvp

[this guy](https://www.reddit.com/user/me/)
---
Goons openly harbor doxxers and bots, and I dont see anyone making repeated threads about it.
---
CCP did not cared then, or it was not against the rules so nothing happened. Or they “apologized”...
---
If this guy in Horde is still playing, then same thing: CCP determined his ban was not needed.
---
eeerrr can't undock, no local and I don't want to lose my ship and be branded a bot .. doh
---
Kill denials has been happening since eve went live.  It's part of eve. If you make someone deny you kills then you're pulling the strings :)
---
I miss good heavy armor fights too... but there hasn't really been any of those since CCP introduced their "Crippling D-Sync" feature.
---
lol. puts 30 bil worth of subcaps on field. no really we are just innocent subcaps that deal 1800 dps each.   
---
by that logic we brought a small gang to fight them we didn't have significantly more numbers.  
---
ive played eve for 11 years ive been on both sides of it. yeah it sucks being overwhelmed by superior numbers/ships but that's part of the game it always has been. All you people do is whine instead of trying to find ways to play around the mechanics in place.   
---
Brave going from loveable noobs to reddit shitposters proud of killing cruisers and destroyers.  Just stop, seriously. 
---
You could try to take a look at EVE University. A ship's page have a link toward some fittings that could help you getting started.
---
yeah, we can look away from test being deployed right at their doorstep 
---
T1 frigates are a great learning tool but your viable targets are limited.
---
You're not tanky enough to kill a cruiser's drones and a destroyer battle will rely on your skills and knowledge. A battleship can call for backup before you die, so it leaves industrial ships, covert ops and badly fit ratting ships (VNIs) as viable targets.
---
my point is, either way your losing that ship. At least in combat you can enjoy it.
---
Significantly bigger ! The Athanors I have in my C1 wormhole will always guarantee multiple rocks with 100,000m3 on multiple ores, including those found in highsec such as Stable Veldspar.
---
I think the funniest is when a Sleeper ore anomaly spawn, and contain a Gneiss rock with 1 million m3... Happened to me twice, I named it : the Gneiss Titan !
---
I appreciate the reply. Thanks!
---
I'll get right on enjoying fighting Stukas there Chief

---
yeah, everyone thinks 40k+ vs 1k is amazing 
---
Another one? Jesus christ
---
Interesting, indeed. I am already doing P3 stuff on the planets inside my wormhole, I could technically scale up to P4, but I'm mainly doing it to provide my corporation with fuel blocks materials.
---
When talking about small volume-high value items, what do you think of ? Thanks !
---
Well I mean  you are one goon is just like the other
---
imagine playing for 11 years and being in brave
---
&gt; oh and yeah let me clarify so there is no confusion there is a difference between criticism and whining. What you are doing with that comment is whining.
---
Nah, the only one whining here is you.
---
&gt; All you people do is whine instead of trying to find ways to play around the mechanics in place.
---
Ikr, instead of whining people should just quit
---
yikes
---
Can't argue that. I'd love to find a way to play around the mechanics of mongoloids dropping a Supercapital umbrella because that their only response.
---
&gt; What you are doing with that comment is whining.
---
Nah, I was just telling you that what your trash alliance does is part of what makes that people don't take fights anymore. You morons are just another Goontard Federation type of dumpster. 
---
Imagine being so far into the deep blue sea this counts as noteworthy content.

A better life awaits you, just close your eyes and think of Bob. It'll all be okay.

Wasn't there, but probably was fun while it lasted. Curious if it was...

Oh you're talking about moon mining? I was referring to ore anomalies. I've never done moon mining and but once I join a nullsec corp they will probably have moon mining fleets?

Yet again they ask us for help not the day before, but five mins before the event expecting actual help -_-
---
&gt;was in bed asleep, just wokeup
---
I think we can more or less apply that to Goons, Brave, Darkness and TEST. All retarded big nullsec blocks in other terms. 
---
damn!  
---
I heard you around 11 minutes 😂
---
Welcome to eve, where incremental improvements cost exponentially more. 
---
How safe are you where you’re mining?  Agreed that that margin of safety must be substantial but there are times and places where hulks are worthwhile. 
---
Unfortunately, both of these ships have been relegated to token roles in the Age of Rorquals, of which the covetor fills the niche better than its exhumer counterpart (newer players, lower cost, less sp, more dangerous space)
---
2cents,

sure thing mate.

yeah we can cause big daddy NC showed up to hold their hand for those fights.

CCP isn't that clever. 
---
Bam! Proved wrong.
---
I think against some of the most no-fun comps in existence and something like 6/1 numbers it's probably more enjoyable to go do something else other then play eve rather then try to fight a basically unwindable fight.
---
What if... people just want to try to have some fun instead of always expecting to win 100% before engaging anything?
---
&gt;why are you calling a 4k alliance to help against the 15k alliance and the largest sig in goons?
---
&gt;So fuck off
---
no you.
---
Depending on what planets are in your WH, and how efficient you make your chain, you can easily subscribe an account off of WH PI, Use all 3 character slots on each account for maximum isk per subscription too. 
---
As for high value items, I'm taking a break for serious market pvp so I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly what to build, but I would recommend taking a more thorough look into T3 production (though you might want to look into importing reacted fullerite gases, which are much smaller than unreacted gases) as well as module production, and also consider T2 module production if you have the skills, blueprints, and especially knowledge. 
---
I've not listened, but yeah I raised the initial alarm and I remember being pretty fucking panicked. Glad it all worked out in the end.
---
That always seems to be the thing with pred, and when it isnt a of the moment he doesnt want help until he wants it 10 minutes later 
---
Some Goons were upset they felt they were due some respect for the eviction, but people have been laughing at them both for how the eviction was carried out, and how they've been reacting to it.
---
Imagine if hulks were actually usefull as mining powertools and the rorqual only had the role as a fleet booster and compressor
---
The Rorqual is a hell of a lot more expensive though and with the addition of lengthy align / warp times and being a juicier target just seems like so much more risk.
---
Haha we were quite unsure what you all were doing over there. Helped how we could :)
---
Sounds like you need to find a new work partner! 
---
Thanks for the review. I'm glad I didn't fit into the "sped-up F1 mashing with shitty techno music and a 2 minute intro" category. Thanks again.
---
If the coveter mines 50mil/hr the hulk mines 57mil/hr. If you can reasonably expect your hulks to last at least 37 hours of mining, it will have paid for itself. Its as simple as that.
---
I might be being memed here?? I’ll bite!
---
First thing that jumps out at me - Do you really mean a 1mn afterburner? That’s generally for frigates / destroyers so won’t be doing much good - you should be looking at 10mn for a cruiser.
---
Shield power relay is doing nothing for you - damage control instead please.
---
You’re talking about ammo as if you have a gun loaded with each type - please don’t do this, lasers reload instantly after cycle finishes so it’s really easy to change from long to short range.... all guns should have the same ammo in them at all times
---
Swap the tracking for a heat sink, will give you more damage (but less tracking). If you have trouble tracking small stuff run away from it so it’s flying directly at you
---
I’m on mobile so it’s difficult, but what sort of combat sites are you hoping to complete using this?
---
4k + 17k &gt; 15k plus a few hundred. 
---
Hol' up muh man. I hadn't logged in yet, all I saw was "Kenny". Not KennyDrien: the badass. Onya for putting up with my spergy self a decade ago -- it's amazing how many people are still around from so far back! It was hella good fun. Still have a few GGRG folks on Facey, obligatory: Mjukis is a sexy nutbag.
---
I think what you've said is fair enough, I wouldn't expect you to boot people without looking into it further, and glad we see eye-to-eye on it being both shit and damaging to the game overall. 
---
I'm mostly solo-roaming in a kiki around your parts, and am not invested in collating evidence (that's time intensive on my side -- not really fair to expect me to audit your peeps), but am happy to submit leads that you could dig into further. 
---
The biggest tells for bots is how they react to blues / interaction from friends. Do they talk, can they get on comms, are they in fleets, etc. If they're non-responsive to you, but then you bring a neutral alt in, and they're on the ball immediately... There's a good chance that's not a real player. Though I'm sure you have methods from which you have greater confidence in, to come to a decision.
---
I think we both know the isk/hr ratio for VNI ratting is insane, so 10-14 days is a long while for them to pad out several billion more before you cut access. I would be far more harsh, (awoxing), but vOv your call. It's a scourge we need to drive out through both limiting access and ostracizing anyone who RMTs.
---
Is it? It's fucking boring.
---
I guess I'm missing the masturbatory self-congratulating side of it since I'm not in Init. 
---
If I were CCP and I am doing this intentionally I will mark every bot and only ban a few each time. Never ban the entire botting network but just a few at a time. This way the botters will have to buy injectors which encourages extractor sales on top of the plex, plus whatever remaining game time the banned bots had is forfeit and had to be re-purchased.
---
Of course this is a conspiracy theory only.
---
Isn't that eve for the half decade prior to the rorqual changes?
---
Very cool
---
17k with how many spy alts?   
---
Keep telling yourself that SV is a few hundred a couple more times and maybe you will start believing it yourself
---
Making money with a cruiser is usually done with a Vexor navy issue.
---
Your reaction to init giving arvse a run for the edge,
---
Sí comandante
---
Ok 
---
most of the value can be saved in a 1mill mobile depot
---
I mean i'm not going to shit talk any FCs as they're all doing the best they can for their respective groups, but people just deal with stuff like this differently, his perception of being able to win the fight could go from "We can probably do this on our own fine" to "oh shit actually now we need to do something about *insert thing that changed here* quickly or we'll lose". It can be frustrating for the people being asked for help but I don't think its him being purposely shitty to you.
---
He and I got Das Boot
---
Not everyone has access to a VNI and a ratting spot. 
---
Thanks FC

Thank you o7

You're welcome. Thanks for the support!

---
I could agree but if they were going to do that having it be "broken" causes more issues... as we expect it to work.. If were at least told guys were doing a trial of no local in null we wont have the expectation and get all ragey when its not there..
---
Yes backlash blah blah.. On some level they need to get over it if its for the health of the game..

Glad to be back friend!

try this it should work for alpha clones and cap stable (for me) if you dont permanently run the after burner, it got a good bit of cpu and power grid,  right around 24m

Ahh, I apologize. Thanks for correcting me. *Back to the Narrative Board* ;)
---
Its not a case of losing your assets regardless, certainly not in wspace anyway. HK was able to save most of their active members assets in safelogged caps *because* they didn't throw away pods uselessly once it was obvious they couldn't save their home. 
---
By keeping their member wealth reasonably intact HK was able to make a relatively painless transition to being an active C2&gt;NS corp. If they threw away all their pods in a final fight feeding to the giant null blob they would have added weeks, if not months to their recovery time which would be one of the dumbest decisions you could possibly make. 
---
Loot denial serves two purposes. 1 is to get the insurance value of all the caps they don't have the pilots for to help improve their ability to make a rapid recovery (see above) and 2 is to make the eviction less profitable for the opposing party, hopefully discouraging them from making repeat attempts in the future.
---
and nobody else in eve has any spies in their ranks...
---
Habit is #1
---
Should we set every timer to autz and beg sggrn for blue?
---
TLDR...
---
Snuff adapts to game mechanics and becomes a low sec force. At the same time Snuff becomes a target for other large groups. Diplomacy to follow.
---
One mistake: the retriever is the T1 version of the Mackinaw. To do the comparison properly, you want to swap out the retriever for the procurer. Good stuff, otherwise!
---
Hey your just catching up! Lol
---
In all seriousness the only reason to upgrade is tank and if you have the safety net/ wallet to support it
---
Hulks are only a little bit better than covs. Tho the difference gets larger when you count links its still not THAT big and you have to count exhumer 5 or its just not worth thinking about.
---
This by far and away takes the cake. 
---
No there isn't, the idea is to deter future roams, what better way to make 10 man cruiser gangs give up trying to attack your miners and ratters than to drop the hammer every single time they show their faces?

&gt;No pictures of dinosaurs. We know TEST has a dino logo. Posting a picture of a guy in a dinosaur costume is not original and is posted 2 or 3 times a day.

the discussion was about dropping on people in nullsec, not having nullsec invade your WH.
---
kys (ingame) 
---
Dont get me wrong, i respect pred and i was in old dhsj for a while, just a bit tricky working with him as our members tend to need a day or so notice to get decent numbers, unlike dhsj who can rageping and have everything ready there and then.
---
Finally, now i know the actual facts of what is going on in the north. 
---
I m still fan of the idea to make the only means of instatravel bridges from ships and structures and take the jumpy-jumpy-stuff completely away from capitals(except jumpfreighters, ofc). Might allow caps to jump to cynos in same system, but no further. Make em use frikkin gates and FORCE ppl to use Subcaps. For reacting to sudden threats, for hunting folks, for guarding caps gating towards an offensive objective...  
---
Having one centralized cap-staging might work for ppl with smaller territory and who tries to shit in the place where the combined military force of an alliance or coalition is present shouldnt complain if he gets dunked. Folks with a larger territory d need to have several caches with caps, d need to organize things. Rorqs needa be defended with subcaps and eventual locally present caps, not with the whole cap-fleet of a coalition. Someone could be the lonely hero-carrier in system surrounded by his subcap-friends riding to save Private Rorqual...  
---
As a side-effect folks would likely rather start wars with their direct neighbours then goin after folks on the other side of the fukkin map just cause they could. Well, and spying the neighbour if he starts moving his caps closer to the border might lead to more diplomatics and shenanigans.
---
A game aint fun if you can do anything you want anywhere you want anytime you want. Games live of restrictions to possibilities which make achieving something harder.
---
Pretty much all corps will have moon mining, unless they are pvp focused ones that expect you to fund your account with alts, or smaller ones where people do explo or something on their own for isk
---
Oh hell yes 
---
honestly i wouldn't be too torn up if players like you quit. i wouldn't be sad if all the toxic elements of every gaming community quit. its easy to spout vitriol over the internet rather than make educated well thought out responses to people with different opinions.  
---
and yeah dropping caps on anyone that tries to kill Rorquals in our space to deter fights is kinda the point. believe it or not we don't want people trying to kill our 9 billion isk mining ships.
---
Tl;dr
---
Brave is great fun. I would not recommend trying to get your stuff to Brave Space. It’s a dangerous trip and unless you know what you’re doing, you’re likely to get popped on the way. There’s a reasonably large economy in Catch and isk making is easier there than in high sec. 
---
Sell your stuff and get into null. You won’t regret it.
---
I wasn't following the op too closely, didn't they know a few days in advance that the hole was seeded? Or was the first timer a legit surprise?
---
Yup
---
except it's not propaganda, just a good shitpost
---
very much this. it was said over and over. still surprised ppl are going for the "they gave up" and "they should have given a final stand" meme
---
there's way around that, with a few idiot exceptions who panic at the first sign of a red/neut most rorqs wait to see if they are being seriously dropped before panicing, if you jam the rorq during that period they can't lock a rock preventing the panic mod use.
---
It’s an old meme sir, but it checks out

I made that rule :(

If I was mod I’d delete this faster than Elton John could empty your teeny weeny dino peepee
