I never had one. Maybe soon.

---
hey bby miss you, hmu for ror2
---
yes, get in a titan and enjoy 10 hours of horrible tidi, shitty mechanics, and more! Also, if you're a supercarrier, prepare to spend that 10 hours tethered on a random fortizar!
---
Fleet of like a 20 people on gate, not a single person remains deaggroed or bubbles the other side. Also you warp to the sun and still make it out?
---

---
*nullsec* sigh
---
Great fight nonetheless and thanks for posting content
---
Play-fighting with daddy won't prepare you for when the school bully wants your lunch money.
---
&gt;  It's all just creative destruction, you find cool people, you do cool stuff with them, eventually it becomes unviable and you go your seperate ways.
---
I'd rather be part of something awesome that lasts a year than a mediocrity that will last until the servers shut down.
---
his point is more akin to there being a need to have this "something awesome" just last a year, instead of keeping it going. 
---
why should it become unviable in the first place? personal reasons aside it's the mechanic's fault it becomes that way and that's what he is criticizing.
---
and no, people who actually enjoy pvp(or at least more than pve) aren't in big coalitions, not as line members at least. They might say they do but come on, the majority just says that because it's wrongthink to actually do pve for the sake of it for some reason so  their 10:1 ratting:pap ops ratio is excused by **gotta make money to pvp brooo**. Just look at every person that genuinely says he prefers pve to pvp in this sub and you'll see pages of f1 mcmongs going "oh but pvp is so great etc etc" when the pvp they do is literally 2 buttons, also amusing how you rarely see people who actually do shit be the ones to say it.
---
How does one go about joining Goon?
---
I’ve lived in lowsec for basically all of the last 7 years (with some small null and wormhole hiatus) and I still get fun subcap content almost everyday that I log in.
---
Sometimes content is lacking or I get turboblobbed or dropped on, but there’s still plenty of subcap fun to keep me happy and going.
---
Are they all fueled? Kudos to your logistics team if they are
---
Mining chat? There’s such a thing for real?
---
At least have the human decency to go into full screen when taking screenshots. Also, bigger fleets have been dropped on bombers.
---
*USA #4!*
---
I'm not sure if you understand how math works, but to not even appear in the top 25 as one of the largest alliances in the game for much of its existence the implication is rather more extreme than "goons never had the most bots"
---
It's more like, "goons must necessarily have had among the lowest per capita rates of permanent bans of any major alliance over the reporting interval".
---
GSF is like 10x minimum and upwards of 100x larger than the alliances on the list, which means that goons must also be 10-100x less likely to earn a permanent ban than the least-bad-per-capita offender on the list.
---
I guess you would need to correct for a few things like the relative sizes over time, but GSF has been one of if not the largest alliance in the game for most of the reporting interval so I think it's still fair to conclude that there are likely more hypocritical NC/PL and bootlicker pieces of human shit spewing lies out both ends on r/eve about goon botters than actual goon botters.
---
Yeah this happens sometimes, especially when it’s really busy. Give it a while and the ISK should appear, normally I get the little popup when it does appear but if it’s bugged there’s a chance the popup won’t, so check your wallet occasionally
---
That is optimistic.
---
I'm so glad I got the enforcer BPC before the daily limit and the speed limit were a thing.
---
I couldn't stick it out long enough for the Marshal then. I wish they would update it.
---
&gt; pretended to have died with it in my cargo...
---
how did you do that?
---
i like how he goes "are you gonna pay for that loss?" like he was the one who owns those mods
---
What if you just want to roam in a 2-3man fleet in assfrigs but get titan blapped? What should I do?
---
I seem to remember playing janitor toclean up a bunch of structures just littering space a few months ago, and no-one even undocking to defend them.  Anyone else recall that?
---
Vippy has security issues that were never resolved and the only person who has access to the code has been AFG since at least early 2018. I enjoyed it the most before I found out about the security issues.
---
Tripwires interface is different but probably the easiest to use for scanners, which is what matters imo. The dev is accessible via discord and will address issues fairly quickly. 
---
Siggys devs are also hard to reach if it goes down unless you have a buddy in HK. 
---
Pathfinder is basically siggy but with more problems and a shiny coat of paint that people think makes it better. Hosting a private instance of it reduces issues but I still think it’s a pile of hot garbage.
---
The whole mango took about 15 min
---
Too much haters in eve
---
Eve was a better place with him and we all know this.
---
Obivously what he said is VERY shit. But in the end, we know that he would never do that or shit like that.
---
Think about the effort and time that he invested into the game and then, suddenly, he loose everything while being streamed?
---
What would you do/say?
---
And before you ask, yes, I just went through and reported them all already.
---
FOR GOD SAKE SET THESE WAR TIMERS TO START ON FRIDAYS.
---
I CANT LEAVE MY JOB TO F1 DUNK SHIT
---
:(
---
Nobody fucking does but it's part of the game. The thing he wanted to show his audience. Showing everything is much more honest to a new player than just introducing him with the exciting gameplay that makes up at most 25% of the actual game.
---
But maybe there are some different views of having a good time. 
---
For example, some may think it's fun to shit or troll in local, to release overflowed emotion or hormone.  How serious could this be if it's just behind internet? I don't mean any specific alliance, but all the people who like shitting in local. 
---
And an another example is botting. Some may think the only fun is to win no matter what measure is taken while some think process is more important, for example, your chivalrous solo fight. 
---
So, in my opinion, it's a conflict about how to view this game and world.  And the thoughts root in everyone's rl.
---
He knows what goes on in this game!
---
You created this illusion of you getting your Corp stolen just for attention. 
---
You succeeded in that. 
---
I’m just saying that’s a bit weird imho. But You do you I guess
---
&gt; Everyone's been telling the North their leadership is incompetant for 3 years at least now, they've been proven right time and time again.
---
&gt;they're just happy to keep making cash and nothings going to change anytime soon.
---
like every other big null entity in the game?
---
TBH, I think CCP should ban that entire alliance.
---
OP, pls save your screenshot. Lets see where they end up in a few weeks.
---
RemindMe! 3 weeks “Where they are now?”
---
Killmails don't show what the abyssal mod's origin is, just that it was abyssal.
---
They knew he had current possession of an officer-rolled abyssal web, and he died with abyssal mods in his cargo. But the web that he died with was a totally different one - some bricked garbage (maybe even t2 or whatever for the prank), and passed it off as if he'd just lost the officer-rolled web instead. The real web was safe in a station somewhere while he pranked everyone.
---
I doubt those with a security status of 0.0 have botted (yet?).
---
i hope you mean 39 bill per rag hull
---
Honestly I probably wouldn't say that to someone, but mainly because I'm more concerned with the real life ramifications (like how I represent that company I work for as an associate of the organization). You never know when that stuff could hit the media outlets. I don't think his contributions should make him exempt from the rules.
---
Other games do hand out bans for toxicity. Toxicity also seems to scale with rank in said org/alliance in this one. And no one is really worried about the underlings. 
---
I dunno. I dont feel bad for him, I'm just saying what he said wasn't the worst I've seen, and there really is a different set of rules for players based on visibility and community feedback.
---

Goons yesterday: "Let's smug about Peligro's data showing no Goon botters and give Olmeca shit for saying there are bots in Imperium space."
---
Goons today: "Let's rent our space a known botter alliance."
---
See I was thinking more like a skinny avatar but with a extra wide "cap" for the top of the umbrella
---
Lol, whose the angry man upset over a web?
---
For hauling the odd cap module with an alpha through lowsec it cant be beat.
---
Yes, you should plan better but sometimes you/some other guy borrows a dread/fax and you need to swap out a t1/t2 siege/triage.
---
Its literally theta counterdropping some aggressors.
---
19k counts as a lot of ratting? That's barely above [green in Delve.](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve/1-2J4P#npc24) Adjust your standards.
---
For a corporation filled with 1 day old toons? :shrug:
---
Defensive much?
---
barghest is literally new eden confirmed
---
Olmeca yesterday~:hurf blurf durf
---
Olmeca today:~ durf blorf hurft
---
Who's defensive? They're probably bots. I'm saying that it's weaksauce ratting. Tighten your shot groups.
---
CCP - 'Hurr durr, only a few titans will exist'.
---
I would not too, never, i have a very nice and extreme control about my emotions and actions - but i complete understand that most people dont have this, and they do shit, tell shit.
---
There are many other shits that people do and nothing happens. For example: i see a lot of racists in eve and nothing happen against them.
---
Gotta come in every thread about krabbing to show off your big dick numbers. That's nice dear.
---
640kb is all anyone will ever need
---
"Here are some screenshots of 1 day old toons, they are obvs bots, pls upvote. OH, and grr gons, hat gons."
---
Heh, it again shows a ban hammer from CCP means nothing
---
"Every thread?"
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

very nice piloting - keep it coming.
---
Heya!
---
Space isolation is totally a real thing. Before getting into a corp, I remember doing something interesting and then being super sad because I had no one to tell and the people in the NPC corp were less than amused. (Caldari FTW!)
---
In your considerations, give Dreddit a thought. It's been the perfect community (at least for me, anyway!). They are laid back, fun, and active. We even play other games, too!
---
If you're interested, check out dredditisrecruiting.com and swing by for a visit.
---
See you around in New Eden! o7
---
Because most of them have moved to blood raider space.
---
Netflix likely won't happen because licensing, but in-game YouTube is certainly a plausible idea...
---
Mining channel is great, drop by sometime.
---
I didn't say the corp is Test
---
Not as sexy as the Moros with 4 high-level hard points.
---
The line we're lambasting everyone for is "there are bots in Delve," not "there are bots in Imperium space." PBLRD was on the pie chart. They ate a bunch of permanent bans. Obviously, there were bots there. Probably still are, frankly.
---
Fortunately, in our infinite beatitude, we've chosen to undermine all renting in Eve by charging a one-time fee for access to the entire region, and no further charges onward. This ensures that neither we nor anyone profit from botting activity; rather, we sequester it from others. Given that players cannot feasibly stop botters, other than laboriously killing their ships every time they undock, damage control is the best we can hope for until CCP reaches their reports. It's not perfect, but it's far more effective than anything else anyone has ever tried.
---
Really enjoyed that! More!
---
Glorious

“Killing”

---
&gt; This ensures that neither we nor anyone profit from botting activity; rather, we sequester it from others.
---
How noble.
---
Yeah if the public service wasn't trash it would be great.
---
For bigger groups that can host their own and troubleshoot it in real time it's probably the best option out there.
---
We used tripwire as a backup for when our service went down.
---
Then we moved to a private instance and it would occasionally break until the host went afk and we ended up just using tripwire because we where already using it more than pathfinder anyway.
---
There is something to be said about reliability over usability.
---
Don't suppose you were in Abyssal space?
---
Only place I've experienced that in recent history is there.
---
If only you put this much work into protecting the spire.
---
Eh, it wasn't really intended that way from the start; rather, it was intended to just sap the primary income stream of hostiles. It's a nice emergent property of the scheme nonetheless.
---
Good shit 👍
---
What are you talking about? PBLRD has been active again for less than a month. Folks have been all colicky about "botting in Delve" for far longer than that. That last part has been conclusively shut down by CCP themselves. Y'all can get bent.
---
Also, I admit to nothing. Not because I'm some kind of slippery weasel man (I totally am) but because I haven't personally verified it by undocking and checking things out. I figure it's highly likely there are bots in PBLRD right now, given the ban figures, but I haven't put in the shoe leather to confirm it.
---
I see....
---
It will be a short war, PanFam will be demolished quickly, just like last time
---
30k people from the Chinese server, huh?
---
Where did you imagine that number from?
---
lmao don't get mad that you got shit on
---
based solely on the names? this defines the issue with player governed botting bans
---
Is this another DinoPoster bot? Holy shit this is bad.
---
man... yet another thing in EVE Olmeca was completely undeniably wrong about. That track record is getting extensive.
---
Can you post your solo Nag fit? Just skilled into one and was thinking of taking out a cheap t1 fit. Any tips?
---
&gt;Sice GOTG blue the Imperium to save them self from the Goons. 
---
I don't think gotg blued goons to save them from goons
---
Gotgs payment for their surrender was for the rest of the North also. They tried to maintain good relations with panfam but directly after losing the war panfam directly attacked gotg
---
I think they found new allies when their previous allies decided to hit them when they were down
---
Sometimes I hear a pop and eve audio dies until I mute and unmute audio. Pretty sure it doesn't make all my sound cut out. May or may not be related.
---
This is something only the cognoscenti will understand :-).
---
EVE nerds are to nerds what nerds are to normal people.
---
I was asked what I was writing today. “A novel” I said. “What’s it about” they asked. I told them: if I have to explain to you what EVE Online is, we’ll be here until next week.
---
Damn Croatian housewives.
---
Try sending an alt or someone  .01 isk. That tends to refresh the wallet for me.
---
Wait till you learn how much we benefit from them being there.
---
Like whole 1B isk per corp as a one time payment.
---
Sorry, I didn't take that same message away from it that you did - I had context from actually being in TEST, vs being a peanut gallery.
---
I was in Querious in the ’11, ’12 time span. If you had come into one of our systems, we would have chased you until your boat was debris.
---
I didn't take away that same meaning at all. Btw whatever happened to Tri?
---
Ah, shit, you're completely right. Unless I know 100% for surely certain that they're botting, I shouldn't be reporting them to CCP because I don't know whether or not they're just using ISBoxer correctly or what their life circumstances are.
---
Its on the test server in the preview window and tbh its not that good.

My idea was just keeping it cheap.. since its 99% likely it will die.  I just extremely lucky against these bad guys.
---
If you drop it against an active tank carrier unless they have lightening fast reactions (i.e. goons FAX).. its not going to survive.
---
It has the 'Capital Emergency Hull Energizer I' just to give me the ability to tank a single DD.. from keepstar / titan if I wanted to try suicide a JF.  I have been told though if you do that its a good idea to have 2 cap injectors.
---
Just don't massively over rep like i did at the end.
---
No faxes, seems legit
---
I mean did you fly over and observe them ratting? were they demonstrating botting like behavior? or did you go through and pick a few terribly chines &gt; english translated names on the list?
---
KOS ded? What happened? (I was winning EVE)
---
The bots are back in townnnn
---
Night Lancer is / was in Darkness, Hendrick was in Darkness and there were certainly some other FCs I used to love to fly with.
---
Imagine being the sort of person that cares this much about imaginary internet points.
---
It will go down like a lead balloon
---
Can confirm.
---
I had that exact thing happen last night. First audio issue with the game that I've ever noticed.
---
Easy, said aussie needs more space for his bots.
---
I'm not going to take this bait, because I know the common strategy of challenging every suggested possible "bot-like" behavior with the some hypothetical about how humans can also exhibit the same behaviors.
---
Good attempt though.
---
The only people they aren’t blue with.
---
Lol. You could say the same thing for horde which for sure has more inactives than brave because of its open app policy, or for nc. For that matter, look at EVOL, NCs largest corp but it has only a couple acrive players
---
Speculating like that is retarded
---
Send me ingame contract for all your stuff and a billion isk and I’ll get it moved to 1dq and get you into Karmafleet.

1) " the kill timer [however](https://br.inyour.space/?s=1967,1967,1967,1967,1967,1967&amp;b=8206080,8206170,8206260,8206350,8206320,8206530&amp;e=90,90,90,90,210,90&amp;t=ickiQsIaaaaaaaaaaaaaaae)... " Well A) that BR is a mess and B) That timer was one where everyone knew it was going to die regardless so northern participation slumped and southern participation jumped in anticipation of whoring on a keepstar kill? Give me a break, people who krabbed the other 364 days of the year took a break and brought a ship that day just to try and get on the killmail.   
---
2. being able to easily replace ships doesn't put more numbers in a fleet fight unless the war has been drawn out for a long enough time that attrition starts to matter.
---
You've indicated you have intimate knowledge about what a specific person is *thinking* in their head, based on what amounts to a blog post intended to spur a specific subset of an alliance's population into action - have you spoken to the author about that post, and what his intent behind it was? Or did you just dunning-kreuger it into your narrative?
---
Old post, but eh.
---
I'd like to see Bastion altered so that it uses scripts rather than a direct upgrade or tacked on features.
---
The regular old "PvE" script (few small changes), a new PvP-oriented fit, a super-heavy tackle fit, etc.. I think it'd be pretty interesting.
---
If the commodity of EVE is people, then you should treat people better.  
---
Funny how many of the dudes fighting against provi, and holding an entire pocket from you this past year, are former provi bloc members.
---
Now that's a fresh meme
---
So. What do you use?
---
Hey, the EU is doing it so it must work!
---
Good to know.
---
IRL politics suggest that letting in people with a vastly different culture from yours doesn't work out very well.
---
the most fun i think i have ever had in this game is when i first started.  After being in test for a short period of time (during their FW stage).  I joined a bunch of terrible players called Titans. in Outer Ring (Ken Morton was the owner; a dude kicked out of Test for spaceship drama))=&gt;
---
[https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99004216/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99004216/)
---
As you can see we were 100% really bad at the game.  But if anyone came into the NPC system we lived in   
---
[D5IW-F](https://zkillboard.com/system/30004502/) we would undock to fight them.. continually.. and that nearly always meant continually dying.   However it was a complete blast.
---
However, appears thats the exception to the rule now... most people in that group have quit the game .. Only really 2 exceptions are me and velsh (now both hydra toons; so we have slightly improved).
---
Wot
---
A veteran PVP corp can easily show up in fleets in T1 combat frigates if needed simply because it's fun. There are combat venture fleets, back when we were in SLYCE we were even flying combat procurer fleets (trademark of SLYCE).
---
There will be a different fit for solo PVP vs fleet PVP. Different fit for when you expect to fight large ships vs when you're going against small ships. Rokh, a battleship used often for sniping can destroy frigates from afar - if fitted for sniping -  but will be vulnerable against the same frigates from close range. The same Rokh can be fitted with smartbombs and it would vaporise any frigate warping into the gate that Rokh is sitting at - but a bunch of medium-to-large fitted kiting frigates would destroy that rokh without receiving any damage.
---
If you want to know what the ship is typically used for, you can hover with your mouse over the ship in a ship tree, or right click -&gt; show info -&gt; description on the ship. But again, there is typically no cookie cutter, no one-fits-it-all.
---
You are expected to figure out your fit depending on your specific situation and on your flying habits as well. Is it for PVP? PVE? If PVP is it for fleet? What size of fleet and what support can you expect? If for PVE is it to blitz and which enemies are going against you? Etc etc.
---
It does make it cheap for a botter to keep coming back to after they get banwaved.
---
Really? *That slow?* Is that a TiDi one or all the time?
---
holy fuck who spergs out that hard over someone else's loss. i'd drop that corp immediately lmao
---
*Someone else's imaginary internet points.*
---
Well done, and gf dudes o7

Yeah....my bad. I accidentally put up a contract for a bhaal BPC and fat fingered it, so instead of 84m it was 84b sell price.

---
  Wheres GOTG's recruitment? You might get the odd 'join ANZA if you're AUTZ' but that's it.
---
except their is bots in delve. :joy:
---
You are not blue to Goons and you will totally ever ever fight Goons, yea. You literally just blued TEST, who are bluetrals to Goons.
---
Why are you such cowards anyway? I just don't understand how could anyone join the big blue donut with 70% of EVE nullsec population and on top of that pretend how they're totally independent (Mango) or how all of EVE is against them (TEST) or how they're underdogs (Goons).
---
&gt; It is really unfortunately that PANFAM are not on top now.
---
Oh so this is how you think. You don't give a shit about fun or anything like that anymore, you see just numbers. Why are you coming to TQ? Do you actually have any idea why Serenity is so boring now? That it might have something with the fact that there's one big blue donut dominating it? Probably not, probably it's CCP fault like always, eh?
---
Oh and by the way, it is not unfortunate, it is normal. What is not normal is that there are literally only two choices for nullsec, and people like you want to destroy it altogether and make it one choice, like you did on Serenity.
---
But don't worry, we didn't really expect that you'd be brave enough to create a third option. You would rather douse any chance for something new on TQ, so that you can bot in peace. Like you did on Serenity.
---

---
Yeah the formula should be bans/age, the higher the age, the less significant 1 ban is...
---
I understand where you’re going with this, but my point is all about respecting people, just as an example I went on a fleet earlier fighting you guys and some guy goes like on coms “Should I spam Chinese insults?” There’s literally no need for that, plus I could tell by the way that guy sounds that he has some kind of rl complexes and that actually brings me to the last point that you brought up..
---
If it was an actual war picture, more Titans would be erect
---
Practice on SiSi
---
*than
---
Depends on what way you’re play fighting with daddy
---
I actually miss the days of VOLT and ATLAS.  
---
Specifically ATLAS and their claims of serving up said leader's head on a silver platter to Goons and burning the entire region.  
---
Sure, they created the "biggest fight never to happen in Querious" after seeing our fleet numbers and logged off, but at least they did occasionally fight and poke for SOV fights.  
---
After that, QFC died.
---
I’m so thankful I’m not a part of any Corp/alliance management... Look at the shit people deal with in an online spaceship game lol, I honestly have enough of that irl.
---
So I'm guessing you weren't even in the same system. Which means, when CCP looks at the logs, they'll see you were just picking names out of your ... hat, and disregard the reports. Do that enough, they'll probably put your reports straight into the trash.
---
Well new accounts get 750k free sp now and that's more than enough to get a VNI going all for free.
---
&gt; How many blues does FRAT have? How many bluetruals does GOTG have?
---
Less than you, much less.
---
&gt; Then you have Provi with "only shoot people who are red"
---
So is TEST now NRDS? Good to know.
---
&gt;  Goons? We're neutral- yes yes something about NIP
---
OK, are Goons going to evict you anytime soon? Are you going to evict Goons? No? Then stop pretending bluetrals don't exist.
---
&gt;  rolling around eso every day with hunters alongside every other hunting group from WH space and Stain + FRAT.
---
And that's absolutely normal for any bluetrals. But that doesn't make them real enemies or even real neutrals. Again, those guys are not going to evict you, neither you will ever try to evict them. There is zero real risk from them to you. If you think losing few rorquals or even VNIs means someone is your real enemy, then you're probably at war with Angels and Guristas and Serpentis and whatnot. Maybe that's what your leadership meant when they said all EVE is against them?
---
&gt; I'm not disputing what's taken place-
---
Oh yes , you are. You're trying to shrug it off as if it's something irrelevant , you're trying to pretend that being blue or bluetrals is the same as being truly neutral.
---
&gt; (inb4 BUT 90,000 PEOPLE!)
---
But there **is** 90k people on your side. It's a legit argument no matter how much you mock it. That's not *OTHER HALF OF EVE* at all, a half is usually something close to 50%. Again, you are trying to shrug off the fact that your hypermegablob has much more people than Northern megablob. Both are bad for the health of the game (it would be much better if there are multiple smaller groups), yours is much worse.
---
&gt; Finally- "other side of eve" need to learn how to get more members frankly. Why don't people flock to GOTG? Or PL/NC?
---
That's the only argument I consider reasonable, and I did my best to point on it when I was in North-aligned alliances.
---
&gt;So I'm guessing you weren't even in the same system.
---
Good guess. Very wrong.
---
That's literally what you're doing when pointing on FRAT and their pond of blues and pretending you don't have an actual sea of blues.
---
Pretty sure more things happened within said AT team, because iirc I heard some things as well, but you're right on that. Mistakes were made, but repeating it 20 times won't solve it any faster. Let's just hope they sell some more of those hulls, because the people who participated deserve some reward (tbf, we all got a SKIN pack in CENTI and we were happy, and we put in quite some time as well)
---
But really, CCP can take action against you if you abuse the bot reporting button. I think reporting every new character in an alliance might qualify.
---
Build a desktop
---
is it still whole EVE vs you?
---
I've never understood why they bother to make a skin that then only applies to one of the TONS of ships in the game.
---
Like.. come on. What a shame.
---
That's nice. Good on CCP.
---
Northern alliances and coalitions have no right to whinge about numbers when clearly other groups must be doing something right to recruit and retain members.
---
The Tripwire UI is plain, but we’re here to get shit done. If you want pretty, go play Crysis. Tripwire, so far, is the least shit, of a bunch o really shitty options. The worst of which is Vippy.
---
"SMA don't defend Divinity space, waaaaaah"  
---
lol they're the only ones that defend it, Divinity can't do shit but carebear.  
---
Losing TXG and GDUSK (and Imbor especially) due to massive burnout really was the final nail in the coffin for QFC. At least we defended and as much of a pain in the ass as it was, we always formed our Hype fleets against invaders - which usually attacked the northern areas, because we beat them back. Sure, we had our fair share of crabbers that were easy pickings for Darwinism, but we were the only competent PVPers in QFC.  
---
Speaking of crabbers, you Darwin guys managed to grab my orca alt twice in a weekend sometime last year and invited me to join your corp after the second. I did much better the first day though, managed to kill at least one of your bombers.
---
Big coalitions have been a thing since 2005 mate...
---
I played since 2003. And coalitions were NOT 30,000 people.
---
Good, now go through the rest, or admit that you're a coward hiding behind numbers :-D
---
LITERALLY THE ATLANTIC OCEAN OF BLUES. SO BLUE EIFFEL 65 WROTE A SONG ABOUT IT. SO BLUE THEYRE THE ACTUAL BLUE SHIFT IN SUBATOMIC PARTICLE PHYSICS.
---
Hey now I left goons for test in 2006. I "left the blue donut" and joined a smaller group first. Why should I move? I'm enjoying my time in TAPI.
---
The biggest fights were only 100 people due to a low number of players. Growth in players = larger groups.
---
Your mistake was streaming. Play the damn game. Nobody watches Eve on Twitch, and screw those that do. Not everything has to be a performance art.
---
Blame Panfam for that one.  They decided that one.
---
Honestly, ditch your friends corp and get into a newbro corp that will teach you anything you want to learn about eve. However, a war is brewing and within the next few weeks some areas of null will be on fire.
---
As for your skills, [the magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14) are good to get to atleast 4, eventually 5. Once you've figured out what you want to do and train towards that specifically.
---
How's that. I recall having logged in numbers far superior to today's measly 17,000 on average we had more actual PEOPLE instead of alts then. People paid to play Eve. There was no Plex.
---
Now I have to listen to that [stupid song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqdF7ctUePo). I hate you!!!
---
Agree, respecting people is a basic line. After all, New Eden has evolved for 16 years, why there shouldn't have been something like universal convention?
---
Stop crying on Reddit, hop in a ship and go kill them.
---
[thealphasguide.com](https://thealphasguide.com)  
---
That can answer a lot of your questions. A bit of trial by fire is always good and as the other guy said look for a more proactive corp.
---
kill them and report them.
---
&gt; Why should I move? I'm enjoying my time in TAPI.
---
That's fine, just stop pretending that 1) you are not the largest superblob ever,  2) you don't have the sea of blues larger than anyone else in game,  3) you not being officially blue with goons means that goons can realistically threaten you, 4) same for Mango when they grow up, 5) that having 70% or so nullsec players on the side of a single superblob is normal, or even 6) that there is anyone else that has exactly the same amount of blues, bluetrals, people, resources, supers and whatnot as your megablob (Goons/TEST/Mango/Brave and such).
---
Also, 2006? Are you seriously saying that Goons were a megablob or a blue donut in 2006?
---
(Killing)
---
The more you post the more you look like the bait. You're all but admitting you reported players based on being 1 day old and pretty much nothing else. They have 0.0 sec status so you can;t even try to say its because they are ratting because they haven't even started yet.
---
My argument is, "large" coalitions, based on player numbers per capita, have been a thing forever, and is a core part of eve - player control.
---
You're welcome
---
Well in that case northern assosiates, frat. treasury, and BOT should all be banned as well.
---
Is it? I thought I was just following in long standing traditions.
---
&gt; if not resolved expediently, could actually lead to the loss of our space
---
not sure how else you interpret that
---
&gt;Also, 2006? Are you seriously saying that Goons were a megablob or a blue donut in 2006?
---
  No, but BoB were? Something about the great war? Where all of null was two groups?
---
Apparently not everyone was blue to them. Goons are going an extra step and even allying with “neutrals” like legacy.
---
It’s like gray sprinkles on the blue donut.
---
Of course.
---
All botters are shit, I dont give a fuck what their alliance is.

---
&gt; PBLRD was on the pie chart. They ate a bunch of permanent bans. Obviously, there were bots there. Probably still are, frankly.
---
So first you say there are bots in GSF controlled space. And you didn't even need to say that, CCP did. But then you say you don't admit that there are. You sound like a top notch politician Querns. This whole hurf blurf about bots in renter space is truly peak hypocrisy. GSF has bots, NCPL has bots, literally anyone with a renter organization has bots. This "campaign" is about one thing and one thing only: PvP. Trying to parade a facade that it's some holy crusade against bots is just comically dull. I have never understood why people feel the need to spin some BS narrative to justify PvPing. It's kinda the point of the game...

Hi, I was in PFED "leadership" during the whole shit-show. None of that was TEST's fault. PFED died because nice (but inept) people were allowed to make decisions and because the only people willing to "FC" were people like Anveri who unironically brag about that in a CSM thread.
---
I called this back in Vale CJ. Once again Bisu Was Right.
---
If you try to keep costs lower, you can get 3 people in a hotel room and that puts that cost down to like $75 per night. Probably budget  $100 per day for food and drink, then include airfare (which will be different for everyone) and event cost of about $200. Total cost this way will be $750- $1250 depending on airfare.
---
wait a sec - do you mind mining an endless supply of ochre and mercoxit?
---
Get some groceries for your hotel room. There are stores on the strip. It’s important to stay on a budget and leave money out of reach to make sure you’re not overspending
---
I'll mine just won't supply it to you

As someone who doesn't have an axe to grind and was RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, you would be hardpressed to be more incorrect.

Frankly, I look at them all as bad guys. My experiences of being in FRT space with blues or hostiles has not led me to change that opinion for the positive one iota. A majority of the people leaving Serenity are going to bot here and it's going to majorly impact a game I love.

I spent about $800 last year including event/lodging/food/airplane. Flights from KC to Vegas were like $150 roundtrip though, event ticket was like $150, airbnb was $250, and I averaged like $50 a day in food.
---
Uhhh. My flight to Vegas from Alberta was 80 bucks round trip
---
They really only do 1 fleet per month?  I feel guilty if I miss a fleet during the day when I'm at work.  Probably getting into fleet at least 3 times a week.
---
Mining just isn't that interesting.  I don't mind, particularly when there's a fleet, but... who'd want to do just that?
---
Krraabb people, krraabb people...
---
Seems reasonable to me.  You have to defend the space you live in, not just live there.
---
You can't observe bots while ratting. They warp off.
---
You can estimate their warpback time and tackle them. The guy is already doing that.

How can we remove Corp APIs?

Ask your directors/ceo to follow the instructions I posted.
---
My friend, the next tier of this game is taking stuff from others. Passively or aggressively. No power leveling to it.
---
On an unrelated note, if a character or corporation has gone several months without any killmail activity their scopes will automatically be removed.
---
Did he ever stop being salty over being banned for rmt?
---
Killing goons is always fun, even though based on how much holier than thou Boat and Mittens act thid will be fun.
---
Be a useless number in goons is certainly attractive to mongoloids.

Can you even get on csm after being banned for rmt?

In China it's a bit more grey toxic ocean. But still cute drawing. It gets my up-float

If people want to play the game their way, that's their choice. Not everyone is a 1337 solo pee vee pee
---
No alphas receive much lower.
---
They weren't independent. PFED would try to get anyone and everyone they could to come help, hence why so many fucking terrible alliances/personalities were there. My point was that your timeline was completely wrong, and most of your points too. Tark had informed the execs that he was getting us into the DRF well over a month before the TRI conflict started, long before CO2 came to fight us, and the final trigger pull happened when it was leaked that TRI was trying to hype up an existential war for real, to be announced soon. Tark and the others chose then to finally announce the addition of PFED. CO2 came over a few times and fed supers/titan/subs to NSH/PYRE/Else, but didn't really do much else that I remember on the grand scheme of things.
---
If you have an SSD you could try putting eve on it, might help
---
Yep, the north didn't adapt to the meta and fell very far behind to the point where they couldn't possibly face down the south. If they had played the meta, their play styles would've probably been negatively impacted in the short term, but more fights would have occurred in the long term as the sides would be more equal. They blame Test for 'killing the game' with blues, but honestly if they are blaming anyone it should be themselves, the current power imbalance is a result of their own mulishness.

Just because you're a fucking moron does not mean everyone else needs to be handheld, friend.
---
That would all be great if you didn't forget to mention that PFED and CO2 already had issues before PFED joined the DRF because PFED had a protection deal with the DRF over the Solar Renters in Feyth which they still felt obligated to "honor" even after the time Solar had agreed to clear out Feyth and move their renters elsewhere (and didn't do). There was a lot of drama around the bs in Feyth, and a lot of imaginary NIP's and ones that were dealt behind allied backs, hence the clusterfuck. (CO2 for example never had one with PFED which some people claimed, the one with Solar had run out, Judge brokering shit with Dran and conveniently forgetting to tell anyone and Test making their own deals with the DRF against TRI, unknownst to CO2 who then made deals with TRI later.)
---
As a local, I'd say eat at places off the strip (way cheaper). If you really want to drink and gamble, dont play slots (it goes too quick) that should cut some of the cost down
---
I've expressed my opinions/concerns openly on test forums to leadership and they've answered me. Still not booted. Weird. Maybe they just don't like assholes.
---
Just because you are lazy and didn't think your point all the way out doesn't mean the rest of us and dumb enough to let you spoon feed the whole player base bullshit.
---
I know exactly who you're talking about, he has been a corp mate who got kicked out by vote from the other Corp members because was really annoying. Quite a bit later we had a good laugh when we saw that he got in the in the blacklist for wormhole recruiters :)

You can think what you about vippy, but that dude is not from him.

My idea of gambling is autopiloting through lowsec, anyways.

Grr gewns? 
---
I get that zKill is a great intel source, but at least it is a democratic intel source. Will it really change much for GSF if every other major group still uploads their kills and losses?
---
I mean, agree to disagree.  I think someone who goes from Corp to Corp trying to get people to sign up for some random wormhole mapper must have skin in the game.
---
I understand the hull energiser but why go for a shield extender instead of a boost amplifier?

Technically possible but why would that be relevant here?

Congrats on catching a sale. Most flights aren't $80 round trip unless you're flying to the nearest connecting airports.

I think you’re giving this dude too much credit.  He was trying to sabotage siggy actually.  He was running around joining corps and trying to spread the HK fear to newer corps and saying dumb shit like “HK runs siggy and has all your maps you should switch to a ‘professional’ mapper like Vippy” (which is laughable bullshit).
---
...placing it became a pain. (hehehehehe)

That's how it works. After you log in, it has you select the character and shows you the scopes. At that screen you can decline or accept.

Does the resource cache reduce initial load times? If anything I'd think it would slightly increase them

Every group has issues with other groups. When you have people as incompetent as Jay Maricade and Gigx involved, naturally some shit is gonna be wrong. My point was you asserting that CO2 had joined TRI on the warpath prior to PFED joining the DRF is dead wrong, which it is. The Feyth shit was literally 4 regions away and was part of the obligation of joining the DRF - the "conflicts" that happened in Feyth were after us joining the DRF, by the way.
---
I don't understand killboards anyways. Why would you want to post Intel for everyone to see.

Yes but you have to accept all the scopes or none don't you? I've glanced at it before and it didn't seem to allow any modification so I assume it has to do with the URL.

In all honesty, I have no clue. Been trying with it on and off, never really noticed a difference. Still getting 10-12 seconds of blackscreen regardless.
---
It's ended up with me logging in and land, only to see the VNIs on grid just enter warp and get away.
---
You talked about it nonstop for months. You talk about it, yet again 8 months later, I write a reddit comment, and then you say I have to "chill out"

首先，你代表大多数华人? 一堆被TEST打倒在地，跪地求饶，还搞出了割地赔款丑事的联盟，只能代表华人的耻辱。可惜ECF没有了，要不可以送你一篇给RAC的《耻与为伍》。AOM可是堂堂国服霸主，我们打49的时候，你们WC连灯都没有，我们早就代表了全体华人，只不过你们自我感觉良好发现不了而已。
---
主席前天在联盟内部说了，你们只是一堆孔乙已式的自我狂欢，是披着爱国皮的国贼，将一个游戏的仇恨上升到民族问题，国家问题的高度，还孜孜不倦的不管民族情谊，给整个宇宙里的其它华人泼粪水 。主席明显比你们有远见，加入TEST就是为了与你们划清界线，主席要建立的是一个普世的AOM，比起你们高到不知道哪里去了。我们这个芒果联盟，即便自称馒狗，即便真的当了TEST的狗，也比你们高贵，因为你们连狗都不如。
---
最後，我们PIBC已经陆续移到宁静，你没看透我们集结的方法就说明你的智商不高。只能上上貼吧，Reddit反AOM，造造谣欺骗外国友人，赚点微不足道的存在感。

Ever wonder what he does with those sotiyos?
---
This is what the people who say, "hurr durr wormholes have caps too" willfully forget.        
---
1) Caps, not supercaps.       
---
2) Bombers exist and will wreck shit in good numbers.
---
i gathered as much from what you said but is there any backstory or are you just a random dude on reddit saying random things?
---
Yes
---
that must be the reason why everyone complains about them, got it
---
*wipes away drool*
---
Not enough room to display numbers that large.
---
Not a sale dude. That's every week..
---
Ya because the brain genius masses have never complained about anything before.
---
Nah, $400-$500 return flight, $400 or so I think for a single queen room and the rest restaurant food and lots of booze. This is CDN equivalent as well.
---
apparently when they are no longer a "primary income stream" they become goon bots. The transformation is majestic
---
We haven't.
---
They were stupid anyways.
---
Because kills are a big part of the fun of the game. I'm not terribly worried about the enemy knowing I'm in x system, they already know that, they are the people I just killed.
---
Could you implement killmail delay please? Like 24h or something. Killboards are nice but my alliance demands us to remove apis from zkill because it is "free intel".
---
Maybe if they stopped botting we'd give a shit.
---
no.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It literally says " if not resolved expediently, could actually lead to the loss of our space". Stop sperging about narratives lol.
---
fuck snuff
---
What did you loot an officer web from?
---
I come from AOM, we are TAPI's friend.
---
when Wormhole Faxes keep popping up with record worthy damage taken numbers then i'm inclined to believe the people that are not entirely happy with shooting a 5 injector Ninazu till it runs out of cap boosters.
---
This is what I use to make my [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/toddfa/videos) and enjoy Eve with ease.
---
do you already have enough blues together for this war? you only outnumber panfam with about 6:1, not sure if that can compensate for all the goon crabs that can't even anchor properly
---
If you ask chori, then he was banned for something else. Would be weird if ccp activate his accounts again if it was an rmt Bann.
---
Why does it take panfam 3 FC's to lead 35 subcaps?
---
maybe it was a mistake?
---
Lol
---
Nah, CCP has done so before. Just depends on the scale, or how well you lead, according to someone I know who was banned for rmt
---
Most likely a dumb player
---
[removed]
---
let's hope.. make it full serenity before classic wow comes out damn it!
---
Nobody cares
---
he took the time to load it in to paint and scribble out his name, but not crop the borders.
---
smh.
---
Wow, thanks kind man.
---
You are the kind of people that eve newbies needs!
---
With out test joining panfam there isn't enough pilots left in the game to counter the goon blob, and i don't see that happening.. so nah, no way to stop goons as it stands today.. at least i get to try some other games for a few weeks :)
---
Making the entire graph kind of moot

It's not the ones you kill that are the problem. If you kill somebody in system Y alot, in say a capital, others will know this and can lay a trap.
---
&gt; OK, are Goons going to evict you anytime soon? Are you going to evict Goons? No? Then stop pretending bluetrals don't exist
---
Guess us and Panfam are bluetrals too.  Same could be said for fraternity.  Very poor definition to go by.
---
Are those default portrait poses? There's mtiple with the same orientation
---
Can't be changed my ass. You can already see the base mod on show info, applying that to a killmail should be simple. Just because they didn't do it doesn't mean it's not possible. I'm glad the world of science isn't run by people like you or we would never have gotten past floppy disks.
---
Instructions unclear, TAPI aped to ceiling fan
---
I mean who calls them injectors? Theyre literally "capacitor boosters"
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
I am paying 39b for mine.
---
You alt still showing on d-scan 2.2AU away? ive had that happen before as well.  Isk to Admiral Waffleson if im first :P
---
Oh lord. I've got my fingers crossed that fatloard went crying to you too.
---
Seek mental help mate
---
Not just that.
---
Idk why this is downvoted. The guy is right, he didn't say he was advocating it or anything. You can gravid your pimp pretty reliably to remove all value from kills and make it harder to sell if you splode.
---
**750k SP bonus and character transfer**
---
If I create a new account of mine using a Recruit a Friend link, transfer an existing character to the new account, will I be able to redeem the [750k skill points](https://www.eveonline.com/recruit), which is awarded for creating a new account in this manner?
---
**Skill injectors, SP threshold calculation, and new character**
---
The amount of skill points characters get varies depending on whether they are past 5 million SP or not. If inject a character, who has less than 5 million SP, with many skill injectors but don't spend the injected points, will I be getting 500k SP from each consequent injector all the time?
---
I am also thinking about extracting some SP from an existing character in order to get below 5 million SP. I intend to use many skill injectors while staying below 5 million SP in order to get the full benefit of skill injectors.
---
So I need to know whether the game takes into account only the amount of spent SP (SP acquired by slow learning) when it calculates how much SP I can get from skill injectors.
---
I can't wait until they start saying that they are not defending them but are using them as bait to have content against the groups that come to hunt the botters.
---
If your war skills are as good as your screenshot skills, take a white flag with you.
---
Your alt is also cloaked, but shows on grid even at 2.2au
---
PUBH
---
your alt is in a different System? oO
---
i dont get it
---
Your alt warped and cloaked, but the other client still shows the ship in space. If you manually pilot your alt anywhere but the warp in point, the ship will still appear as 0 velocity.
---
That your alt is on grid, 2.2 Au away, but is in a completely different system at the same time
---
Yes. It's not the standard "see cloaked ships" bug but it's also in another system. Want ISK?
---
because the positioning of the bugged bracket and overview entry does not update when they leave grid, they just fail to be removed from your ui
---
Yeah. It's in another system cloaked. Sorry someone else beat you to it :)
---
im not playing anymore but if you're really serious about that then donate it to Signal Cartel :P
---
Sure. Perhaps was too easy to spot but hey I'll keep my word.
---
Like you ever get out of your home system and use something other than a kitchen sink fleet.
---
We have as much Supers as rest of galaxy combined
---
What places to eat do you suggest?
---
very interesting bug indeed, imagine this happening with whole fleets
---
All g buddy
---
The hero we need.
---
If you mean Legend as an retard, then yes, that looser should come back.
---
How can I make this thread about Goons? Where's my shoe horn?
---
Thanks for taking these! They look awesome.
---
well, they should be removed from your ui when you change systems...
---
Titans also got a whole lot less expensive.
---
I hope it looks good, I want a cool rag skin, and the eros one is way too expensive for my blood.
---
Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior The Mittani?
---
I am sure the guy wasn't trolling. I didn't know what Delve is either. Good to know.
---
IDK, I can try find some way to calculate it but it depends how easy it is to find if a system is in HS or not.
---
What, you mean banning a couple hundred alpha VNIs a year DIDN'T fix the bot problem?!
---
You logged off.
---
This is nothing.  Remember at 6rcq-v we had 5 fleets of supercapitals. This isn't even 25% of a fleet
---
That's corp level.  Not alliance
---
so high and mighty of you to actually believe that it would take the whole of nullsec to evict you lmao.
---
I hate to agree with our rivals.. but he is right. Krabs just wanna krab
---

my friend lost 100m and im still salty.
---
its about the concept. dont refuse to let other ppl do something safely if your just going to halfass it and die
---
Gobbins just doing as she is told. If they had any sort of intellect they would move to Malpais and claim the region as their own. But it will be nice watching them lose all their shite very soon :)
---
Stop ruining the narrative!
---
Not sure on first question, but can answer a few of your second questions. Unallocated SP still counts towards your total SP, so once you inject past 5 mil then you will see diminishing returns. Secondly, you can't extract below 5mil SP form a toon, hence why the minimum needed to extract is 5.5mil SP.
---
If you're talking about brave then idk who told you that because bni has zkill linked as a corp
---
Wow, amazing!
---
Not everyone has the same intellect as you
---
Ccp showing their bias again, only banning these bots once they leave ncdot renters to join imperium renters.
---
You haven't followed me closely then. I always said lots of alliances do it because "everyone else is doing it". Including Goons.
---
Looks like yet another attempt by NCdock backed entities suggesting they look at goons and not all the renting the space they use for RMT or the encouragement of botting.
---
Does this mean people can stop their killmails from appearing on Zkill?
---
You want see X47 in Tribute ?
---
&gt; it just requires you thinking for yourself
---
  I'm shit at pvp, so fleeting up helps. Sorry.
---
How would this make it any better? A totally fucked up Tobias' web isn't worth anything either.
---
I mean shit happens when you prefer pubstomp everyone instead of going for enemys that would be dangerous later right?
---
Jeez, and I thought us Goons were supposed to be the bad guys.
---
Is there a way for a character to never appear on zKill?   As in even if Manic Velocity has destroyed my ships a 1000 times.  Is it possible to not show up on his zKill list of kills??   What I am asking is.  Can you say for a flat ISK fee.  implement a system that gives users the chance to not be publicly tracked by killmails?
---
I dunno, I think it's much too late for that the game /u/79jsc97 played is a far cry from the garbage it has become.
---
&gt; I thought that it was them and frat that ccp peligro reported had the most bot bans in the last wave?
---
where do you think their renters came from?
---
okay done. I'm pretty sure this data also includes all systems one jump from a HS system but that's harder to stamp out. The radius of HS is 27 (but is really 26 thanks to what was mentioned before) and the center is Algogille. The system which has the lowest average distance to other HS systems is Kamio with 12.687, followed closely by Kaputeenen, Niarja, and Tkao
---
Alternatively - you could call out ccp for not dealing with the bots since.. y'know, they're the only ones actually able to do anything about it.
---
no, he will not, he's said as much before
---
Impressing!
---
Maybe just yourself?
---
that's a weird looking avocado
---
Nice
---
It's true, I don't follow you closely (Zzzzzzzz).  Goons aren't doing it though are they.  It's mostly renters.
---
Underrated solution.
---
The answer to that's going to be no, because if the other person involved in the killmail wants to publish it, that's their right.
---
Grr PH. 
---
Hat PH.
---
Grr.
---
great work, love it
---
It means you can choose not to publish the KM. However, if the other party that received it (i.e. if it's your kill, the victim, or if you died, the final blow killer) chooses to publish it, you will still appear.
---
so, how many buttons for real pvp?
---
Holy crap that's good!
---
ANother bot thread wow something new....

Just wait, ph will probably backtab them too at some point vOv

Oh come on.  You are really not that dumb.  You have to be trolling at this point.  Smart and independent "FLYING" tackle pilot does not need to tackle everything.  In this scenario he does not need to scram anything at all.  All it needs to do is get into a position that gives landing point that for main line DPS to land and fire.   Sniper harpies if you have to numbers is the best for this I think.  But most (not all)Assault frigs would do.  Low lock time and high apher fire will insta pop this raven fleet fit.  You kill one every time you land. And if you are using harpies.  Depending on battlefield,  Even if they boosh away.  You kill more as they will be in range of Sniper harpies (Sniper harpies can be good for shooting at 100+KM).  And they may well be bubbled from there own HIC.
---
Bob Ross reached me to start with the background.
---
So she probably did as well
---
This is why CCP really need to look at what alphas can do, and also whether allowing people to fly faction cruisers on day 1 of a new account is a good idea.
---
Where are you getting this "huge market share" from?  If it's that pie chart, that's bans over the last 16 YEARS.  Given BOT is one of the oldest, but still alive, rental entities it's no surprise we're high on the list.  Just because we've had botters in the past does not mean we are a major source of them today.
---
However, as this tries to challenge the "grrr renters are botters" mantra it will be ignored and down voted to oblivion.
---
and its also the right of the killed person not to have it shown. 
---
Have it on the Attackers KB that he can see but a search of the killed person there a privacy option not to show anything that way the attacker keeps his KB big dick record and the person who was attacked can keep that hidden if he wish's best of both worlds
---
Sucks to see the heroes taking on NC's botting empire lose :(
---
&gt;OK, are Goons going to evict you anytime soon? Are you going to evict Goons? No? Then stop pretending bluetrals don't exist.
---
In that case FRAT is also blue to goons, because goons arent going to evict them anytime soon, neither is FRAT evicting goons ...
---
Very good.
---
*In Bob Ross voice:* "Let's paint a nebula. Let's paint two nebulas. Look at that happy little supernova."

so where is the limit 10, 100, 1000 10,000? What decides this limit?
---
I hunt in their space. I see a decent amount of bots. We kill lots of bot supers too.
---
Squizz, that Q&amp;A is beautifully written.
---
Bots in Imperium Space get live coverage on Reddit, even though the biggest botters in the game don't live in Imperium Space and the PB bots have only been there a month, having moved from someone else's space where they went mostly unreported on... reddit.

It's too funny.

Lol, “rights”.

very interesting write up and fights, big props for that. However jesus christ the logi/dps ship ratio in this fleet [https://zkillboard.com/related/30003942/201904030100/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003942/201904030100/)
---
I heard that it's inappropriate to direct your animosity towards the player than towards the game
---
I love how every single null alliance accuses every other null alliance of "blatant botting", but when it comes to your renters they are pure and innocent and it's just a real human ISBOXING 50 3 day old injected VNI accounts for 23 hours a day, you don't know his/her real life circumstances!!!!
---

Usually it starts with contemplating a theme, but some of those crazy people purchase supplies before letting everything fall into place.
---
Fuck no lol
---
This star may have ended its lifetime, but it has only begun to shower us with its beauty. I like to think of it like that; it makes me happy. What makes you happy?
---
it is personal data tho
---
Are you saying your entire log in is 12 seconds? Mine is about 30.
---
Given that I have no idea what Abyssal space is, most likely not.
---
Or better yet, from Eve
---
and why not lol its a good idea
---
And he leaves himself open to lawsuits from EU players by doing so.
---
No dude, like someone said it's "70% of nullsec" against little old innocent NC who would never blue everyone around them
---
In one wave, yeah,
---
This guys post is talking about statistics released after that showing that over the past 13 years 10% of all bans happened in that part 1~1.5 years and were handed out to fraternity and holy renter alliance
---
So a large majority of bans in the past 1~1.5 years seem to have been going to fraternity and skillu
---
If the game changes in such a way that the meta is no longer fun to them should they really be expected to adapt? I for one have zero interest in playing with the typical Goon/Test type linemember and I doubt NCPL felt much difterently.
---
just have the skills for every ship, there problem solved!
---
My single room is only costing around 120 per night. I'll stick with my sanity lol. 
---
This year's hotel is lower cost, but rest of numbers are good.
---
Turn the pop up delay up in your settings.
---
makes sense for a trading toon that never undocks :D
---
asteroid rogue drone officers when
---
is that tooltip delay?
---
I believe so
---
No you don't. As far as the botters that is. Pie chart proves you wrong.
---
Or if *anyone* that clicks an in game link to the kill and decides to post it using the link that the game will output. Sure that's not via an API, but it's just another way that a kill can make it to zkill.
---
it kind of delays it the first time you mouseover but as your move to another item it insta-pops up again
---
Proof is in the pudding mate. And the pudding is the pie...chart. You are wrong.
---
Yes. The default delay, if any, is insane and I too have gone mad and its literally the first non graphical setting I adjust when installing Eve. \^\^
---
Think that's the best you can do, just turn it to max and don't linger long enough to trigger it.

* Renters are insects.

* A Renter’s lifecycle is made up of four parts, egg, primary revenue stream, pupa (chrysalis) and goonbot.

There is no tick box to remove these, it has been brought up repeatedly and posted in ‘the little things’ thread on the official forum. For now tool tip delay set to max is the best you can do.

Have you started chanting your mantra "Horde will come. Horde must come" yet?

Maybe it is personal from your eve character's perspective. Not real life though.

No, he doesn't. The data belongs to CCP, not to the player.

Well done

Awesome.

Do I get any rewards for discovering wormholes?
---
Yes please

Eh. Rent isn't a huge portion of a bot's expenses in any fashion.
---
What new players have now is infinitely better than what we got served to us a decade ago.
---
I was not a fan of the previous tutorial, the current one is much better, especially since you have a choice on what missions to run and when.

The armor timer also had a bigger number of Imperium capitals on grid. You also shouldn't forget that a significant number of northern forces were newbeans in burst jamming frigs.
---
&gt; unless the war has been drawn out for a long enough time that attrition starts to matter.
---
Like the war last year was? Like any war that hopes to achieve anything of value in the future will be, because of sov and citadel mechanics? The goons probably will not even need to tighten their cap umbrella for the upcoming deployment, now that DeadCo are their pets.
---
Not directly, your rewards are shortcuts through space and various opportunity to make ISK found in the wormholes themselves.
---
so like a normal eve player?
---
Okay thanks
---
oooh okay, thats mean and i love it
---
are you just asuming they are bots? they could be normal players! what makes your think there bots! CCP says they took care of the bots! Have you contacted a Diplo!
---
that wont help they just go to a difrent ship

Pretty screenshots! Thank you :)

Why don't they fix this bug? It's triggered by a race condition with adding tags to items, e.g.

* Type the name of a solar system into local

* Select it, right click, and say link to system (or whatever, that adds the system tag)
---
* Quickly either click it, or drag it into another chat window

Stop alpha's from being able to use navy/pirate ships. These ships are sometimes as good as T2. Alpha's can't use T2 so why allow this? It's being abused heavily.

Kiki is a bit ridiculous. The normal T1 destroyers have some trade offs - for high DPS you sacrifice range, and for long range you sacrifice tracking, and for having that DPS you don't get speed. Here we see a destroyer doing 4km/s, out-damaging a T3D's active tank at 20km, and tracking interceptors.

No, no it isn't. That's not how publishing works.

&gt; TIL winning is boring

Do you want to play the game or win the game?

---
Why? It's a lot more fun to fight than to win IMO.
---
&gt; can't attract anyone of any worth 
---
Seems Test can't either considering they are getting skullfucked by FRAT. Seems goons also struggle with it considering people *still* die under their cap umbrella. But spodbrains would much rather have the security of the goonie umbrella than any other that's even slightly smaller.
---
&gt; It was so much better for the north when they could turbo krab moons with no effort wasn't it, good times. 
---
Absolutely fucking ***NOT.*** The OTEC times were one of the most horrendous episodes in the history of eve. Funnily enough, this was *also* organized by goons.
---
&gt; No the blame would be on CCP for that one for not changing the meta 
---
You can't just expect CCP to do everything. Sure it would be nice of them to change the meta, but when you see that is as stupidly broken as it is today, you could just maybe not abuse it to the absolute max?
---
&gt; goons would get the winners trophy
---
Or the retard trophy for killing the game they liked to play (or keep open in the background while watching netflix)
---
Or a nerf to ramjags. The way to balance one problematically OP thing is not to provide something even more OP. At least a ramjag is situational and requires other ships to get the kill, it can't just delete enemies at 20km.

Or someone from one of their corps that has access to the kills, but yes, if you and your opponent and respective corp leadership structures never share kills in game or add their apis to zkill, sure you can keep your kills off zkill. That's a lot of ifs though.

I'm about to upgrade to an nvme ssd. Should be 6x fast load times in theory. I'll let you know how it is.

Vippy was great. Auto naming WHs, tracking of multipule chars, good UI. But the main dev has gone AWOL because of IRL reasons. So no, don't use it. It also has a bug where other people can see what you are mapping. I don't think you have to pay for it, who's gonna check?
---
I can recommend hosting your own instance of Pathfinder.

dont ruin my fun

and don't people have the right to ask zkill not to put it on there site

If there is gate camp, and I have slow aligning Tengu but it has Cover Ops Cloak, can I pass the gate camp safely if I activate covert ops in an instant second after de-cloaking from the jump? And then warp off.
---
Can you explain to everyone here since it seems to mystify us all not from china how you seem to label non chinese refrencing a certain event that happened in chinese history as racist. This is a 100% legit and not troll question.
---
Nothing is black and white. People are responsible for themselves and they rely and are influenced by other people. It's both. We don't live in a vacuum. We are always influenced by others, especially those we look up to.

a single caracal counters a kiki.  Don't get me wrong I think its extremely good.
---
But I also think cyno's and FAXes are also extremely good.. in fact a hole list of things that should be looked at before CCP nerf the kiki (which they are already doing with the mystic nerf)
---
You would think so, but that isn't how the EU works in regards to their privacy act.
---
yeah, one of the reasons for why the meta changed  
---
Supers are much more affordable today, you don't need a sitter toon, its super easy to build them, alliances can stock them etc.
---
this is good use of statistics. you should go back to school
---
shut the fuck up stainguy
---
Of what i can remember, i HATED being forced into doing industry and scannig crap in a tutorial for a game that openly boasts about it's players being allowed to do what they want, when they want it.
---
New tutorial is better in every way. Plus, if current generations really have attention spans too short to read tiny bits of text they will fail to appreciate the game anyway
---
sometimes you post too hard and it's not funny anymore. just saying. 
---
not that you were funny in the first place.
---
Probably worth more than a revenant, I bid 2 trillion.
---
so if tapi were to remove their api from zkill... then they would be just t?
---
They'll just take a hit and omega up, botting 24/7 won't change their ISK income much if they need to plex their alts up
---
&gt; your renters
---
  What renters? KWG is leaving
---
Gotta love those, basment dwelling nerds with no life, who take themselves so seriosly, telling someone who fucked up that he is an idiot. So what are you hoping to achieve, telling him he is an idiot?
---
It is a fucking game....
---
It's almost like they're creating brand new accounts with a VPN, injecting into a new VNI and starting over. *Shocking*

I think Amarr is where people usually go to socialize.

&gt; except their is bots in delve. :joy:
---
  WHO KNEW RORQS BOT IN DELVE
---
They just dont have enough bots.
---
&gt; eve been half donut vs half donut for like year now tho
---
It's been 50/50 at times ever since the great war against BoB in 2005
---
And how is that? Oh yeah, they used their sov, built stuff instead of relying on just rental income...
---
Essentially it was cause most of leadeship did what you did and won eve. In the end there was only one person left trying to hold the alliance together and that rarely ends up well. 
---
A decision was taken to leave gotg and move to etherium reach to try and get sov there and rebuild as a pvp focused alliance cause krabers would stay in Dek but since at that time there wasn't much of leadership left and essentially only two fcs, that move failed.
---
Annoying for you, useful for newbros.

When's the invasion then?
---
GDPR only covers personally identifiable information. Killmails aren't covered.
---
Your name looks familiar. Did our goku fleet just nuke your rorquals lol.
---
TIL PL/NC/FRT/TRI/GOTG/PROVI is 80% of null
---
also
---
&gt;PROVI 
---
Loooool. Test absolutely have deals with PROVI.
---
GOTG are literally goon pets now, goons are your allies. 
---
yes 80% was an exaggeration. 
---
Real numbers are around, 55% of eve, tbf thats probably close to 0% of null.
---
&gt;The data belongs to CCP, not to the player.
---
But he is providing a platform to distribute the information publicly.
---
Goons has 2x the members of PANFAM as well
---
i was a bigger fan of figuring shit out on your own with a group of strong boys at your side

They will. You have to fight people that are not in a position to do that.

Thanks man, much appreciated.

Oh how I miss fighting you guys when Ronin was still alive. Was fun...

---
It is always fascinating how everybody and their relatives are looking down on renters.
---
And yes, they are at a pretty low level of the food chain.
---
But would happen to NullSec, if they didn't exist?
---
Even more empty space than there already is.
---
They made their choice as everybody else living in 0.0. 
---
Pay your stay with time (aka participation in CTAs) or ISK (aka renting).
---
And them fighting instead of farming, the blob fleets would just get bigger and bigger.

Our QA department has a baseball bat called "Realty", because sometimes the programmers get hit by reality.

I just started playing last night, and although i cant attest to the old tutorial, this new tutorial helped me get into the game. I did the exploration path and started the millitary. I tried getting into the game a couple times about 5-8 years ago and couldnt get into it.

What's your point

---
If there is personal data, then CCP can re-name or delete your account for you as the character names are not supposed to be your real name.
---
but would the plex supply be able to keep up if all bots needed to plex all there accounts all of a sudden?
---
Vippy had some nice features but it was buggy as hell and the dev has gone afk. So just use tripwire or pathfinder.
---
bet it can make a mean tomahawk steak....NOW THAT is multi-tasking
---
No sorry, we have to remove all colour from client. The success of removed colours from sidebar suggests it's a good idea.
---
I'm hoping for 50:1
---
NC deploys to Delve when?
---
I’ll explain it once because I’ve already done it. I didn’t do anything for that. Orion does that each time he sells our stuff because market PvP is boring. We didn’t poke anyone or anything, infact I was out hiking. Boat pinged goons and Orion asked me if I cared that he was memeing. Why would I?
---
Move to California they just passed a half ass version.
---
Because in general renting = botting. While there are some extreme requirements, most big blocks are incredibly lax about participating.
---
You rent, not because of having to show up to CTAs, but rather because you don't want other people to scrutinize your operations.  If I run a bot in my normal corp, people will ask questions.  If i run a bot in my renter corp, nobody gives two fucks.
---
Then don't get killed.    
---
The idea you think this is covered by GDPR is hilarious.

Fight people on roams away from their cap staging, go to party B's space and fight party A while they are roaming there. It can be done, you just have to work at it.
---
Good for him, he has a ton of talent.
---
If Legacy basically stay out of it, it does have actual potential to be interesting. Since there is a defensive advantage so that evens things out a bit.
---
&gt; Do you want to play the game or win the game?
---
Preferably winning while playing, i'm not into the masochistic losing while playing.
---
&gt; Why? It's a lot more fun to fight than to win IMO.
---
It's more fun to do both but I like I said, I don't have a losers mentality.
---
&gt; Seems Test can't either considering they are getting skullfucked by FRAT. 
---
Obvious lack of information is obvious, http://evemaps.dotlan.net/ will help you be a better player if only you tried.
---
&gt; Absolutely fucking NOT.
---
All your HC would vehemently argue otherwise, also goons were only an in vitro alliance at the time so how you think they organised it all I don't know.
---
&gt; You can't just expect CCP to do everything.
---
No I expect them to do the bit thats their job.
---
 
---
&gt; Sure it would be nice of them to change the meta, but when you see that is as stupidly broken as it is today, you could just maybe not abuse it to the absolute max?
---
Spoken like someone with no experience of how to get ccp to change things.
---
&gt; Or the retard trophy for killing the game they liked to play (or keep open in the background while watching netflix)
---
Once again, CCP would be at fault, only they possess the power to change the meta. Losers just whine that they're being beaten in it.
---
Yes. Could. Which is not an inaccurate statement for any entity. Too many bads doing dumb things can result in loss of space. How long have you played eve anyway?
---
You're wrong.
---
Americans thinking they know how a modern society works is like watching a monkey trying to fly a space shuttle
---
Because you asked nicely, I’ve changed it.
---
Yeah I was slowly piecing that together while watching your videos. At first I was under the assumption that you were dropping a dread in hostile space and it did not make any sense to me.
---
That's what I'm afraid of.
---
So conflicted: 
---
On one hand, fuck Slyce, bunch of cap happy edgelords.

On the other, C0NE trying to be relevant is pretty cringey. 
---
Welp, have fun Count, just don't start botting like your blues.

Did she just paint you a message that check on your prostate?

lol holy shit I'd forgotten about this. Yeah so we pulled our fighters bc the guy who came in at the end, Papazoglou, is with Weekend Warriors and we knew they had caps in range and a fleet on the way (iirc cause this was a while ago)...I also remember being really pissed at our tackle during that fight, for obvious reasons.

Use a PG implant.
---
We use a privately hosted Pathfinder, works great for our small corp. 
---
Private hosting eliminated most of the issues associated with it apart from single character tracking. (not really a huge issue as I tend to chain map on one character at a time).
---
If you can find a good private host or learn how to do it yourself, Pathfinder becomes a nice solution. 
---
I've been quite a few different WH corps and used all of the trackers listed in other comments. Siggy was by far my favorite as I like clear object based maps that I can manually manipulate. The lack of support since early 2018 killed it for me. I remember it being completely unusable for weeks at a time.

Tripwire is a good option is you agree with the UI, personally I'd rather eat broken glass.

Treat people fine. You were never mistreated as far as I'm aware. It is a game and we try to be as accommodating as possible  to everyone but that isnt good enough or great for everyone. At the end of the day all I can do is what I think is best, same as anyone else does. Just because you didnt like a decision or decided on a different path isnt an idea of mistreatment. Besides I'm sure you are happy where you are now, and ideally that should be good enough. 
---
Not every fit is good for everyone. People want to do things that are different than what they want to do while in cva or providence. Not sure that is something I can fix. Supposed many people have positive and negative views of thier time with cva or in alliances as or freinds. But at the end of it, we cant always be the best fit for everyone.

In talking with them they legitimately seem to understand that botting is a large part of what killed their server.  For as much shit as CCP gets over here, their counterparts in Serenity actually did nothing about them.  Eve serenity was bot or cease to exist.  These people are coming to TQ whether or not TEST (or anyone else) helps them.  If nobody helps them, the alliance dies and all the players flock to PLA or FRT.  The influx of players is here to stay, the only say I get in it is where they go.  I for one am pleased to be in a position where I can try and effect the cultural change needed on the way in not to pull a frt and go straight back to botting, as I'm sure a lot of their pilots would be actively encouraged to do under FRT leadership.  Will it work down to each and every line member?  Who knows, but fucked if I don't try.  
---
Remember, my rental alliance wasn't on peligro's list.  For anyone who actually cares about the botting menace and isn't just memeing to try and shit on us, this is unironically best case scenario.

If you eat and stay off the strip it can be cheap! My hotel was 92$ a night and it had a full sized kitchen so I ran to Walmart and grabbed all the food I needed (granted I was there for a lot longer than the Eve Event). This hotel was also only a 15 minute walk from the Linq! Find one or two friends to go with and save even more on a hotel! Most rooms have pull out couches, or you can grab a cheap air mattress. 
---
Other than that any expense is dependent on you! They had a lot of Eve merch which I dropped easily $100 on without thinking about it. Also the top gulf event (10/10 do top gulf if it’s going down again this year) was $90. 
---
The strip is literally for dropping money, but if you play it right and avoid the expensive areas you’ll be fine and you can enjoy a nice cheap weekend for $600-$1200 (airfare, hotel, food, event cost).
---
Pathfinder it is.
---
How slow is slow? If you align in under 6 seconds or so, and you're in LS/HS, then you're 99% safe, exceptions being spawning on top of an object that prevents you from cloaking immediately, or close enough to a quick frigate which can burn in and decloak you. But if it takes you 10 seconds or so, then people should be able to decloak you before you warp. 
---
If you're in nullsec, always equip the interdiction nullifier subsystem, otherwise you're as good as dead.
---
Yep, same with cloaky camping. It's not the cloaky that's the problem, it's the cyno.
---
Hilmars mom still had to make his lunch.

Yea, Fuck mules bruh.

I have never lived in null or j-space. I spend most of my time in low sec and high sec because i enjoy industry. 
---
I'm thinking of finally buying a dread with the 1m sp we are getting at the end of the anniversary event and doing some pve content with it. Is there any null region that would be relatively "safe" for solo ratting or similar content? 
---
By safe i mean i wont get 300 titans dropped on me as soon as i undock.

Nerfing the FOTM, while valid on its own merits, doesn't really curb botting. They'll switch to the next best thing.

It's better to keep them in a place where they can easily be tracked rather than have them scatter all over the place.

No nuet logi means there is a chance to bag a nice kill even if they all welp
---
Thank you for the hint. I'm aware of the travelling salesman problem but I think that the eve universe is a little bit different because the nodes cannot be visited in any order (as you have the predefined warpgate-pairs). In addition to that I don't think that the eve problem can be solved exactly (because of too many nodes) but of course you are right that there are a couple of popular algorithms for such problems that may return better results than mine. Maybe I'll try one or two of them in the future.
---
PBLRD isn't GSF. Try again.
---
Also, any random poofter in a red shirt can say whatever he wants. I don't give a fuck. I'm talking about the accusations of botting in Delve. The completely unfounded accusations.
---
First of all, I never used the term racist. Second of all, I am from Taiwan. Call me what you want but I don't identify as being from China. Finally, I don't think referencing a certain event that happened in Chinese history as racist, but it is definitely in poor taste to keep referencing a massacre in somebody's country's history (talking about Tiananmen here). The way that people reference Tiananmen here in this sub tends to show a disingenuous and disrespectful side. Not that I'd care. I'm from Taiwan. But no need to be dicks.

Cool pic, upvoting even though you hide your character name
---
Everyone.  Then skill injectors became a thing.
---
your meme is bad and you should feel bad
---
Assuming that you are limited to regular stargates, no Bridges...
---
The first thing you should do is go through each region and eliminate any system beyond the entry into a dead end pocket. The obvious example to me is Delve: once you reach RF-K9W the 4 whole constellations deeper into that pocket are set. You're going to do all of them in one go. So you can work out a fastest route for the pocket, and then all you have to do is work out the fastest route between them that takes in all the pipe systems.
---
Yeah, it's low-sec. My align time is 7.5 seconds.
---
Okay, didn't know this "burning" method.
---
Of course, if it is null I'll be equipped different.
---
Thank you!
---
The current Goon alliance has only been around since 2010 I think and the chart only shows the top 25 alliances.  I'd guess most of the PVP heavy alliances will always be low on the charts because of PVP quotas, pure botters will stay well clear of anyone that requires activity checks.
---
Without access to the raw data behind the chart its difficult to come to any definitive conclusions beyond what it shows - the top 25 alliances with banned bots over 16 years.  For example, it could be that BOT's bots were mostly banned 10 years ago and the alliance has been relatively clear of bots since.
---
The one potential pattern that does spring up is the Russian heavy alliances (RED, SOLAR, XDeath) pop up in the 25, as do their rental alliances.  BOT was owned by the XDeath for a number of years so its not a massive logic leap to guess a chunk (but certainly not all) of the bots may have surfaced during their ownership.
---
Okay.
---
I guess I'll be fine then. I'll just be randomly passing through, so no one would be expecting me.
---
Thanks!
---
With how many times that fortizar has been put into a shield timer, not too worried this time tbh.

Not to mention we thought we'd be gone like 2-3 weeks ago, but hey ho, now we're called cockroach coalition and living up to the name as well now.

In the traveling salesman problem you also have cities linked together by roads, you just don't care what order you visit the cities in.

Nice one.  Your wife did a very good job.  If I still had a captain's quarters @ Hek, I would hang it in the room.  Maybe CCP will allow it some day.

I'm counting the time it goes from me clicking my character's portrait to when my grid has fully loaded and I'm able to issue commands.

The bots have a _very_ short reset timer, like 4-5 minutes. So if I miss one, I'll log out, then back in and wait on my character select screenshot until they reset again.

I live on the East Coast - my flights are more than double what my friends in California pay to get there, but less than half of what my friends from Europe pay. Hotel rooms depend if you stay alone or share, and if you share, how cozy you get. Food depends on where you eat.
---
I ballparked blowing $300/day while I'm there, but I stay in a relatively cheap room alone, and I like good food. I also come a day earlier &amp; stay a day longer than most people - that shows up cheaper in flights but is offset by more hotel expenses. Gambling budget is wholly separate.
---
You really need to give more parameters before that kind of question is actually going to get you goo answers.
---
Memefleet best fleet
---
That's what happens in null, because the fleet that you need to defend is pretty expensive to replace. But since the fleet that's going to undock is made of sub-caps, it's much cheaper to replace, so maybe there's going to be less blue-ballin?

Like dreads are basically free, everyone is printing minerals like crazy and the reason the defenders don't undock is price give me a fucking break, 
---
The real reason is more likely that giving the attackers a fight means they enjoy the experience of attacking therefor we need to make the process as painfully boring as possible so the attackers give up. 
---
let's be real a non-super carrier fleet ( something that could do defense against subs fine is like what a billion per ship before insurance and like 300/400 mill per ship after insurance ), so you might lose like 30 billion or something if you fail and the extraction goes horrible.

I spent about $3500 the first time i went and about $4200 the second year but im a big fan of buying large amounts of tequila for the people around me, and I tip relatively strong because Vegas is built around tips and the better you tip the better your service.

Point it then... kiki do amazing dps yes however have a big ass sig, no god module, non OP tank or speed (if people want to fly in null with 1.2bil pod to get more speed; fair enough).

Dreads are only used for PVE in C5/C6 wormholes, they're not very good in null.  
---
In general though, if you're looking to solo rat without joining a nullsec alliance, try Provi, they're going to be the most friendly.

Try joining a corp that already operates in null or j-space though, will give you far more options and safety.

At the same time, given how complicated TSP solutions are, just brute-forcing a solution isn't exactly a terrible way to do it.

You actually said on stream you scammed your previous corporation and stole all your corp mates assets before you took a break.

No it doesn't. It shows that the word "inject" is widely more associated with injectors as opposed to... cap boosters.

---
You've got that question backwards. Triglavian stuff is super expensive because there's high demand for it, because most of the ships are best-in-class or OP.
---
Just that is probably the single worst argument to make against why the kiki is oppressive and you should feel bad about it.  Saying insane tracking fair enough... 
---
However, comparing it to the caracal which is one of its true threats.. is like saying the hecate is oppressive since it out dps's a caracal.  Honestly are you in goons or something with that level of stupidness?
---
The work on that cloaky proteus is amazing! Happy birthday you’re wifee is very talented.
---

... and yet here you are soloing in a kiki.

Also, you said 'a single caracal' counters a kiki, but actually even in a straight up fight the kiki outdamages the caracal, as well as having the speed and agility to control the engagement.
---
lol.

Nope they cost so much because they can only be built with rare minerals farmed in 3b+ ships. To compare you can build a catalyst from scratch in an hour or so mining in a &lt;1m venture.

people talking about how does alpha account allowed these BOT easy isking in free. but all you guys forget chinese destroy their server in a system without alpha. if there is profit then they will just do it continue, doesn't matter they need plex it or not. PLEX alway is not a "cost" in a profitable work by computing
---
Please don't be the last one
---
Can't wait for The Chosen One to return!
---
I have never called for the balance of the game to be based around solo players and indeed I use to be fairly well known in BSB.  Its a stupid argument too make.  What I do like CCP doing is making the game more difficult.. no easy win mechanics like cyno's and HAW titans and the stupid super umbrellas.
---
In a straight up fight the kiki dies to the caracal 100% of the time.. all the kiki has is the ability to run away from the caracal.  Guess what all frigates / dessies have that ability to run away too.  You don't get kills from running away from other players though.
---
In small gangs I don't like being in the kiki; I much prefer the retribution due to sig tanking stuff.  The number of 500mil kiki my group have lost due to having full tank to having no tank in the space of 10 seconds .. well its alot.  
---
If you want come the code hole in a kiki I will undock a caracal and we can 1v1.
---
Last year with the flight, hotel, tickets and food/drink about 1500-1800? Flew in from the East Coast.
---
No, but double the final rewards.
---
That's incredible, a genuine piece of good art (not just in an Eve context), and it's a huge labour of love to do something like that for your partner, too.
---
Time will tell
---
That’s what she said
---
Stop crying like a little bitch.
---
I mean, RTL is a thing in [some parts of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left)
---
It's mother's day tour nerds. Who cares.
---
Not if CCP has anything to do about it.
---
Better be an extension of the giveaway for this plus a reward.  Amiright?
---
I made a traveling salesman algorithm that I use for my hauling business, with more than 10 waypoints it switches from brute force to genetic implementation.
---
At the moment I've coded all heimatar system and connection, but I guess I could use it for all the systems in eve universe... I only need a datasource
---
If everyone gets free sp it’s not worth as much as if you only get free sp.

If you can spend enough time to do a reddit post about it... you can quickly login again.
---
Oh, I think I understand now. So when GSF sov space in Period Basis harbors proven bots in PBLRD it's fine cuz "it's not Delve". But somehow when NCPL harbors bots in drone regions its sufficient justification for a holy crusade. Lol. Peak. Hypocrisy.
---
What alliance is on the ihubs&amp;tcu in the better filled space that PBLRD occupies? http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Period_Basis#sov
---
Can't here. Suns allready said fuck you and dispared over the sea.
---
This is a serious question tough, since 8 days can be untill the downtime of the day or untill the end of the day
---
Man I’d try and get away from this terrible ad.
---
Can bot with gila, and also downgrade to myrm / vecor / arbitrator / prophecy, so it wont impact probably more real player than bot, because real player care more about isk / h than bot.
---
Death 2 all krabs
---
EVE Players: CCP is giving stuff for free REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Also EVE Players: CCP I can't claim my rewards REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
ALSO EVE Players: Double the rewards REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
They call him hero of the 4000$ war...made my day :D
---
&gt; What I do like CCP doing is making the game more difficult.. no easy win mechanics like cyno's and HAW titans and the stupid super umbrellas.
---
I agree on that point.
---
&gt; all the kiki has is the ability to run away from the caracal. Guess what all frigates / dessies have that ability to run away too
---
Can you make a Thrasher do 4km/s?
---
And actually at 4km/s I'm not sure the caracal does enough damage to do much to you. Light missiles have an explosion velocity of 170m/s.
---
And finally it's a good piece of distraction talking about whether it can 1v1 the dedicated anti-small-stuff cruiser, as if it not being able to win that fight would make it balanced. Is it balanced with T1 destroyers? Clearly not.
---
You will penalize all the real alpha player just for these fucking bot. Not fair.
---
No, a good person would have looked up the number and posted it. I'm just a dude.
---
You can get those minerals in low class abyssal space too, you don't need 3bn ships to get them any more than you need Rorquals to get spod.
---
Also, where are you getting your figures from? A kiki is 120m in Dodixie right now, not anywhere near 500m.
---
You can't blame people for not trusting you, since you provided absolutely no information about why you think they're bots in your post.
---
Account sharing is against the rules
---
I wish more people understood this.
---
How will I hear someone coming through a WH without sound! I don't want to sit there and watch it all day!
---
Yes almost 600 ban together for frt and goon renters.
---
No we can all do stuff.
---
Report all bot, blue or red.
---
Never buy from rmters.
---
Bot exist because people cheat AND because other guys rmt with them instead of ccp.
---
If you're so confident that a kiki tanks a caracal why are you too afraid to take up his 1v1 offer?
---
You should probably learn the difference between facts and wartime propaganda (the crusade part).
---
&gt;Bot exist because
---
because ccp hasn't removed them from the game.
---
Any corps for bot hunting? I'm a new alpha but it sounds fulfilling.
---
&gt;Please don't break my bot
---
Trig ship for Abyssal space, CCP getting the lore right at least
---
Only matters if you plan to monetize it.
---
Nc and PL use mainly renters to make isk so... and these alliance has a huge number of bot (10% with BOT, nc renters). But BOT clean a lot of shit last month (it s important to have a leadership that do it) it s like iA.
---
Ph is a new alliance. Too much trafic in their space to bot ;) it will be suicide ;p also ph is about pvp not so much about farming.
---
I'm not sure who I'm supposed to be an effigy for, but it's pretty confusing. Perhaps you should be pointing your directionless vitriol towards the actual subjects in question, rather than whoever you've arbitrarily chosen as an avatar for it?
---
did you snort ~~terrazine~~ amber cytoserocin ?
---
you indeed cannot make a thrasher do 4km/s.  A thrasher hull also does not cost 122mil with the gun being 58mil.  With the current standard shield fit costing ~ 400mil.
---
However, what you can do is fit a hawk to easily catch it.. or create a 63mil jackdaw that can apply 227dps to it from 100km.
---
The reason people dislike the ram jag is that you can do a truly oppressive fit for 30-40mil.. If people want to start fighting my group will 500mil kikis... bring it on (if people want to fight in anything other that capitals; I would be fine with that... or boring fleets of 100 ferox's).  If the ram jag cost 500mil to do... I would also be fine with it.
---
Bots can run gunnery and misl platforms just fine. They've been doing it for more than a decade. Nerfing the FOTM specifically to try and break botting is dumb, and I am winding up a big ol' "told you so" by telling you numpties now.
---
Not sure how CCP would like it if I upload them somewhere. But I've got them via [ESI](https://esi.evetech.net/latest/swagger.json) with just a few lines of code. I'd love to see your results!
---
What movie is this from?
---
Huh? I have no intent to sell SP. In fact, i would be great with SP becomes worth less, because my training queue is like 3 years long.
---
Learn how to give a proper handshake and they will.
---
Maybe they should not be concentrating on instanced pvp; where they have to take into account solo 1v1 pvp.
---
I understand the reason why CCP are doing the instanced pvp; since they turned the game into cyno's online for anything other than frigates in FW plexes.. and not everyone likes this kinda gameplay or is up to the small gang kite meta.
---
However, why should a multiplayer game which advertises thousands of players fighting one another then worry about 1v1 in instanced pvp balance (apart from CCP randomly including it in the game).  They cannot balance the game currently outside of 1v1... why should 1v1 be any different.
---
in summary meh.

Hi Reed. Sure, I'm an idiot, but I've been 100% transparent with everything I've done. "The people that came to evict me" is you and your corp. There's no revenge motive... not that there needs to be. You can be comfortable with using Twitch and Youtube to get your kills. I know what I'm doing now. 
---
This post was meant to spark an exchange of thoughts and was no way meant to be a personal attack on you or your group. Sincere apologies if I've offended you.
---
My concern is that they will use TEST protection to grow up big and strong and then break off and we have another enemy living on the border. 
---
And imo the bulk of the people who left serenity because it was a botting hellhole were already here. As much as people love to meme frat and such i believe that the majority of the chinese that came prior left to get away from that situation. What we have migrating now are the ones who didn't think it was too bad until the very end.
---
how i picture the war. https://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/headline/public/2015/06/10/blue-balls.jpg
---
Smells like content to me?  If I build another server contender that at least doesn't bot I'd consider that a win tbh, whether or not they're allied with us long term.
---
frt left because they lost the war and had nowhere to go. As for your theory on botting, peligro's chart would empirically suggest otherwise.
---
If we weren't #26 on the list, what pearls would you clutch next?
---
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
So do you admit you stole all your previous Corp mates assets or were you lying on stream to make yourself seem like some elite player?
---
The chart says frat bots it doesn't say that the chinese bot. This difference is very important.
---
abyss pvp shouldnt really be there. takes pvpers away from the sandbox (which is the last thing we need) and it is pretty much impossible to balance
---
I don’t see the hat
---
It is.
---
Source: I'm a network engineer. Seriously.
---
I was doing T3 darks in a Gila 9 months ago, and was making 150m/hr. I'm sure the price of abyss loot has fallen since then. Can't give you advice on fits since it's been so long, sorry.
---
yes of course, my understanding though is that the bulk of the serenity migration have ended up in PLA (goons, with an alliance stance against botting) and FRT, which is on the list.  Unless I'm missing any major communities, I think the rest of the previous generation of serenity refugees are not centralized anywhere else.
---
I'm not blaming him doe anything.i just said his guess was wrong.
---
im sorry but abyssal pvp has always been low tier
---
This is one of your dumbest, and most ironic posts yet.
---
1v1s in eve will always be a shitty rock/paper/scissors or 1 ship beats all situation, the game isn't hard and skill is unneeded
---
It's just another example of the Triglavian ships being absurdly strong, at least when the number of enemies is low so they can ramp up - I've just been having a nice discussion in AB's thread about the kiki, the leshak is similarly way out of whack with other battleships, and so they've felt the need to make the T2 triglavian ships even more over the top because otherwise people would just use a vedmak.
---
The problem in most of these cases is really the gun. Triglavian disintegrators:
---
- Ramp up to very high damage. With Destroyer IV, a Kiki with no damage mods and a meta gun will do 140dps to start, which is a little lower than other damage systems (an AC Thrasher is at 170) - but it will ramp up to +150% which is 350dps, more than double the alternatives.
---
- Tracks almost perfectly - as well, in fact, as that AC Thrasher, with its falloff of 7km
---
- but also has good range projection, out to 18km with short range ammo, or 40km with Meson with which it will still do over 200dps.
---
- Fits really easily
---
- Is kind on cap - it has a cap usage of 5.2GJ/3.5s = 1.49GJ/s (before mods), compared to a 150mm railgun at 2.22GJ/4.25s = 0.52GJ/s or a small beam laser at 7.22/5 = 1.44GJ/s. Looks balanced, maybe, until you realise that it replaces *seven* of those guns, so it's actually *twice as efficient* as hybrids.
---
All that means that there's basically no scenario where a Triglavian gun isn't significantly better than the other types. And that's why when you get a HAC using that weapon system, the DPS it can generate completely breaks the cruiser meta (as kiki does for destroyers and leshak for battleships).
---
lol if you actually think Mittani will do anything in this war i don't really know what to say.
---
He barely plays the game
---
I dunno, I picture him a lot more like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/ZiQV1iy.jpg)

having someone log in for you isn't account sharing.

Get off the strip and prices calm down quite a bit.

I was there^(TM) I think that's a story that will last a lifetime lol

you clearly have not seen enders game

&gt; about a 500 year old winnie the pooh man from Tibet that has a part time job as a prostitute, wants to live for another 500 years and is a bad driver
---
Ah, I see you know dear leader.
---
5 med neut curse shits on that, on quite a few other ships and dies only to very expensive purger gila.
---
Sometimes I take dreads to hostile space, but those are mostly the videos that end with super caps dropped on me.
---
No it’s just you are witch hunting just based on shit names.
---
Olmeca you are batting .999 on being wrong about every single thing you say so you have lost all cred lmao literally irrelevant
---
What? Only 700 ISK? You could make a lot more than that pretty much anywhere else.
---
Huh? That's two people logging into the same account, that's pretty much the definition of account sharing.
---
Though CCP has typically followed a 'don't get into trouble with it and we won't complain' approach to that rule, so I'm sure you get away with it a lot.
---
I 100% agree that CCP shouldn't balance around Abyssal PvP, however they shouldn't make content just to break it.
---
how is this getting downvoted. your all wrong fuck you
---
theyre fine
---
I accidentally injected a 360mil skillbook when trying to select it for multisell. It's a menace CCP!
---
Triglavian ships are very strong, but very susceptible to having their spool-up interrupted. Jams, damps, TDs (optimal script). abkiller makes a point that looking at this from a 1v1 perspective kind of blows it out of proportion. I get that if Abyssal PvP is the entire game for you then this is going to suck for you, but there are some pretty potent options for counterplay in a fleet setting.
---
Supposedly a single Kitsune was the wrench in the works that caused Hawks to lose 50b a few days ago.
---
If the ship is broken in abyssal 1v1 pvp its going to be just as unbalanced in non-abyssal 1v1 and small gang situations.
---
You're not even going Ingame to claim the rewards, its a grey area.
---
What do you mean. You can just bring a carrier and win it 1v1...
---
You're welcome to come out to the region and take a look for yourself, but I know how "IT'S CCP's JOB" you guys are, so I doubt you will. :shrug:
---
With mindflood and proper lowslots, the Ikitursa can push 140-150 GJ/s regen with 46% neut resistance before abyssal rolls on the Batteries.
---
In order to even try and break that the curse needs to be spitting out over 250 GJ/s of neuting power, which is possible with 5 medium neuts that have good abyssaling, HG talismans, and the like. Your fit is gonna be something around 4-5B.
---
However, a 5 medium neut curse with the DPS to get through T3 abyssal site (2 DDAs reliably) will find itself getting shit on by:
---
Cerbs
---
Orthruses
---
Literally any gila that isn't active tanked
---
Some ishtar fits
---
Pretty much any other curse
---
Because guess what? You spent all your fitting room on energy neutralizers, so the best you can fit is a single cap batter and a large shield booster, and you probably had to run reactor controls over PDSes. Any Curse that runs dual battery and any ship that spits out more than capless DPS at range will kill your expensive boi. Also.... You're not cap stable. So if you don't neut that boi out real quick, you're toast.
---
There's a reason nobody runs 5 medium neut curses. It's because they die to everything.
---
The tracking is the thing that bothers me the most. If I get in a 500m orbit on a kikimora that has no range control, it needs to start not doing as much damage. Especially since it's been shooting me since I got within 40km of it.
---
Some great suggestions here.  Mine would be TSP + GA to find a near-optimal solution, although depending on how you set up the TSP it should be sufficient to solve the graph alone.  
---
NB: What OP did (brute force) is a perfectly reasonable 1st attempt to establish a baseline result you'd then compare more funky/clever solutions to in say, a scientific report if writing from 1st principles.
---
CCP offer a data dump of all static data to do with the game.  Check fuzzworks for conversions to many popular data formats like flat-file sql, csv, etc.
---
I mean as it is i dont see anyone shedding a tear when people shit talk america or other countries and no one shurely holds back. But suddenly due to the influx of people from china or taiwan we have to dance around on our toes to be afraid of offending them. To the point that sort goes full retard over it and progod is a tad as well?
---
wait how much ehp do each have again
---
Part of what makes it so strong in Abyssal pvp is that it has perfect resists vs other triglavian ships. It's  also a fair bit slower than the vedmak, but while the arena size does allow kiting, it does limit it's effectiveness, most ships you see in the real eve aren't going to be bricktanked asklep brawlers.
---
Isn't there already like a 2-3 day buffer? I'd think that's enough.
---
IMHO I would like it to have reduced top spooled up damage while providing it a bit more base movement speed.
---
Right now it's a niche role brawler HAC that is great at taking out larger targets, but it's just too slow to fit with both brawler role and the whole Trig ship line.
---
As for Abyssal pvp you should be able to kite it fairly easily assuming both MWD or both AB fits. Obviously if one is med and one an things will be different. Not sure about DPS vs it's tank though, if both ships are HACs it will be interesting to see how it will play out.
---
Honestly they should stop these stupid log in events. Im tired of being chained to my game for two weeks just to get some shitty reward.. 
---
If their going to do them make them global and stop punishing players that have a life outside of eve ffs.
---
And the "buffer" dosent help when you dont know the event starts till they tell you three days aftet ffs
---
I travelled around EVE a decade ago, but I used a spiral approach from jita by constellation, waypoints being the first system of the next constellation en route. I dont know the exact amount of jumps because I had to jump constellations manually but still was a lot. Im going to try make a route through  [http://www.tikktokk.co/route/](http://www.tikktokk.co/route/)  and will post a result maybe...If eve doesn't crash
---
I just want to play eve like that on VR. One day...
---
Flair checks out.
---
Yes, it's true. But I am no elite player by any stretch. After playing only a month or so I was recruited by an older PVP corp looking for newbros to help bring new life into their corp. There were maybe 5 of us that were recruited, all new players. The corp had lost some of their long standing experienced pilots before I joined. The rest of the older PVP pros had real life obligations and seemed to be falling out of love with the game. They would log in for a few hours here and there, but we didn't see much of them. I was way more active and wanted to do more in the game. I wanted more action. I convinced the CEO to give me access to corp hangers so that we newbros could use some of their old ships and try to get better at PVP. The CEO agreed and granted me access. I was shocked to see stockpiles of blueprints, ships, ammo, minerals and modules. The "in-game decisions" I reference above that triggered the end of Chapter One are the decisions I made when I took everything. I can't say I regret it but I wouldn't play it that way again.
---
&gt; Triglavian ships are very strong, but very susceptible to having their spool-up interrupted
---
Sure - but of course other weapon systems are also susceptible to being jammed or damped. A Kitsune at 60km is going to screw up a lot of small gang compositions. A Triglavian gun is about 20% lower DPS with no spoolup, and spins up 5% per cycle, so within 4 cycles of losing the jam, it's better than the others again.
---
Not to mention that a Kiki can shoot down the jammer at a lock range of 50km, so it's far less susceptible to jams than the other T1 destroyers with a 25km lock range.
---
Skill unneeded lmao ?
---
Did you ever PvP ?
---
Would be, if not for the down right stupid amount of scanning needed for anything worth doing in any meaningful way. Carpal syndrome is quite real and it fucking sucks major ass.
---
Karma is a bitch
---
For years, the Gila has been oppressive in any 1v1, now it will be the  Ikitursa. The Gila will still be more common because poors and alphas, but I'm sure you will get the point.
---
Imagine that... a Trig ship that excels at performing in the Abyss.
---
Why bring your carrier when you can drop your 10b super under the protection of all the faxes in region?
---
This argument is completely stupid... a curse 1v1 can be completely OP, as can a deimos.  However, you don't see fleets of 2 bil curses with high-grade crystals.  If I catch a cruiser that is tanking me; I call some friends to help shoot him.  If I am fighting something with better projection than me; I will undock on my alt in a 6million isk crucifer.. guess what I now project better than him.   
---
Will  this new ship be able to tank 100 Feroxes at 70km while projecting DPS back... no it won't.   Will it be able to tank the super blob and HAW dreads dropped on it; while webbed and neuted..
---
The game never should be designed around 1v1 pvp.
---
Cloaky camping can't be touched until Intel bots, some sort of at least minor local changes etc take place cause it's unfortunately in too many cases the only available counter play.
---
Totally not bait.
---
Oh quit making it sound worse than it is. A super is significantly more than 10b, even in the cheapest regions.
---
Or return to the roots once you have your fill of all the botsec bullshit.
---
Gila wasn't oppressive in abyssal though. It was very much a rock/paper/scissors situation
---
Don't worry, if something looks cool and everyone is having fun, then CCP will fix/remove it, because of muuuh lore and immersion.
---
i'm sorry what's the most intense thing you could possibly be doing in a 1v1
---
I see the north has their gameplan on paper already
---
what is a crucifier ... now has dps range with meson of 12.7km with tech2 damps or 15.2km with cheap meta ones.
---
You also never miss a td.
---
you have 3 extra days to get the rewards built in.
---
You mean Bob?
---
Should make everything with no end date so ppl going on vacation for 1-2 weeks can collect the rewards.
---
I'm paying real money for 2 acc and I want to be able to collect.
---
Pretty shitty to miss out on 1m sp + other nice stuff because not home.
---
So I just had the most toxic/trollish idea for abyssal PVP sites after the new trig ships come out. Hear me out.
---
As it stands right now, the ikitursa looks like it'll be able to beat all current abyssal fits.. BUT!
---
What if you had a fit, capable of tanking the ikitursa for, say, 30 sec at a time? You'd be able to drop ECM drones and recall them before he kills them. At some point, your ECM procs, resetting the ikitursa's damage. If you could also keep this fit relatively cheap, you can now ransom blingy ikitursas!
---
Hurray, a counter-ish was found
---
logging in clicking a button and logging back out is "chaining" you to the game?
---
IMHO CCP should not give abyssal pvp a single thought while balancing PVP in the game.  It would be like balancing a ship around the AT.  An extremely small proportion of the player base do it and also its something I have zero interest in... (obviously if I enjoyed it; I would also want it on the top of their priority list though).
---
You can also lengthen the tooltip delay
---
Even if you don’t sell something. Everything has a cost. 
---
If everyone gets a 1 Mil bonus then everyone is on an equal playing field. If you get a 1 Mil bonus. You’re progressing passing people up.
---
To some extent. Some days I dont feel like playing eve and I forget theres an event bam dont get final reward. Including the aformentioned delay in telling me it was there in the first place. It didnt show up on pulse till like three days in. Thats bullshit.  I didnt get last evets final either for the same kinda shit. Its dumb and im tired of being punished for not logging in every-single-fucking-day... it should be a cumulative reward the more you log in the better it gets. Way better than this event shit. Leave the events for sites ffs.
---
What is your counter against inactive/dead corps filling up the platform after a while like the in-game Corp finder?
---
There’s a lot of ways to indirectly monetize sp. if you do something faster you’re monetizing something by lowering its opportunity cost.
---
ah good, some intakes for airflow
---
An aeon has been sold at 10 bill in delve unrigged. Hels and nyxes are 11 bill, the hel even has t2 rigs at 11 bill on some cases. It is that bad
---
Yeah it's more like 11b lol
---
I just bought a super in 1dq for 10b
---
" you don't see fleets of 2 bil curses with high-grade crystals. " Why bother when you can just fly around with a fleet of tri ships? They can beat anything they meet including caps. Fleets of of destroyer and cruiser sized tri ships are already a thing and used quite successfully by those willing to field them.
---
I just q click battleships in my carrier and win every 1v1 in under a minute it's very high skill
---
i could exclude adverts older than 1 or 2 years from search or show them in a separate search, etc.. This is up to the community, whatever you want :)
---
How do you enable that?
---
I just remote in through my phone but maybe not everyone wants to do that 🤷‍♂️
---
Google Remote Desktop is what I use
---
All hail
---
Sure thing tiger. With current sov mechanics, nobody will budge anywhere until at least next spring.
---
As well as a mom who's son is snorting coke can do.
---
A 3 month lifetime for ads would be nice. 
---
Also could we get a heartbeat count filter (how many real people are in corp, not alts) Would be amazing!
---
Now Sort can finally backstab an enemy for once. But who will the next 50 faction forts go to? I think BWF could use some..
---
Unfortunately no, although I'm sure they'd be hilarious.
---
This ship does seem rather strong, but very vulnerable to ecm drones. If you get cycles off every minute or two the ships dps drastically drops. Now the question is will a smartbomb become meta for Ikitursa in abyssal pvp.
---
Also if everyone is flying this because it's OP, then people will probably be flying cheap troll anti ikitursa ships that have massive exp/therm resists and just stalling the timer.
---
The tweeters on those speakers should be in line with your ears. They look way too high
---
the lifetime will depend on the amount of adverts hosted i think :)  depends on the upcoming months  
---
i will check the feasibility of that "real people" counter thing!
---
So you're telling me that if you play the game you get more rewards than if you don't?
---
That sounds absurd!
---
I don’t doubt there is botting, I just know your approach to botting just based on names is literally witch hunting. It’s dangerous, and I don’t support it.
---
Right click the box in the chat window where you type whatever turds you like to type.
---
What? God no.. The longer you play. The more times you log in TOTAL not based on any x-y period.
---
People here are saying
---
‘Ccp shouldnt care about 1v1 cuz we dont care’
---
Okay, stfu guys. 
---
Abyssal pvp is great contents and most of u guys dont do it simply becuz 
---
1. u cant afford it 2. You being too suck to enjoy it
---
Dont define eve as your massive fleet war f1 pushing game. 
---
OP is good abyssal pvper and he is making good point here, altho im pretty sure  Abyssal has been perfectly balanced so far and i believe it would be in the future (training t2 vedmak btw)
---
I'm here too!
---
thank you for the reply all of you, you have made my work day so much better :)
---
Depends if ph hasnt fled from geminate before the war starts, like they did in fade
---
gameplan?  na,  thats a guarentee.
---
every war is blueballs.   and with citadels, even more so.
---
stopusinglogicplsthx
---
Keepstars are great stages to slaughter a supercap fleet on
---
&gt; P.S.: Donations are always welcome! :P 
---
sent :)
---
8 seconds is pretty sketchy tbh, why not just fit inertial stabilizers for the trip, and refit to your regular lows once you get to where you need to be? Also how are you getting that align time in a Tengu, you're not armor tanked are you?
---
&gt; They can beat anything they meet including caps.
---
This is so true... goons are shaking in their boots with the nano gangs coming into their capital umbrella regions and killing their ratting titans and rorqs. Honestly what reality do you play this game (I want to play that game)?
---
The meta of cyno onlines is here and its not going anywhere.  The EHP creep of this came is crazy.  Goons the richest group in the game.. when they fight what do they use.. stealth bombers and command dessies.
---
Leshaks eclipse other Battleships in small gang and I agree those nasty kiki that PL were doing seem nasty (on mass)... But I have not seen them against a equal number jackdaws with command dessies either or anything other than ganking stuff.
---
I just find it odd after 2 years of capitals destroying the gameplay of anyone not in a big alliance people suddenly care about a 500 mil destroyer or 1.2+ bil Leshak destroying the meta of subcaps.  
---
Shall I tell you what happens when we catch a goon rorq... nothing.  What kills a goon rorq... 60 PL kiki's or 100 dudes from bomber bars.  (obviously this does not include retards; who will die regardless).
---
T2 Capsule
---
Shows how little you know of the game.
---
love the triglav content being released rn, keep it up bois &lt;3
---
I guess not?
---
thx, to "Corny" ? :D
---
Well, we all know EVE Online is actually a submarine sim, so I guess it checks out.
---
&gt;This is so true... goons are shaking in their boots
---
you do realize there are more people in this game than goons and more regions then just delve?
---
Even though I haven't seen a single second of it, I'm guessing Crazy Rich Asians?
---
The implant skin works that way.
---
But yeah, a "set default skin" option for pod/hulls would be nice.
---
This is like germans complaining that kids around the world can learn about WW2 on their schools.
---
&gt; If I am fighting something with better projection than me; I will undock on my alt in a 6million isk crucifer.. guess what I now project better than him
---
But if he brings a crucifier too then you're back to his projection being better.
---
&gt; a curse 1v1 can be completely OP, as can a deimos
---
Yes, in specific cases, but there are also 1v1s that those ships will lose. What in-class 1v1 does a triglavian ship lose?
---
Probably not, but it wouldn't really matter. PLEX will skyrocket and more people would be inclined to purchase PLEX to sell for ISK once botter demand causes PLEX to jump to 6m per unit. Win win for CCP.
---
Are you telling me you are fitting a super? Where is the fun in that? No mods or go home
---
CCP designs a Triglavian HAC that is ~~bad~~ lackluster in any real fleet pvp scenario (due to absurd damage ramp up time) but excels at Abyssal PVP? There's no way that was intentional.
---
[RIP skin day, 2015](https://i.imgur.com/MYx9y0h.jpg)
---
Hahaha Stu we are not moving into dek 😂
---
Crazy Rich Asians
---
Yes, that is a Kikimora.
---
The abyssal meta was already a dumpster, the hac makes a decent fleet alternative to the zealot for groups that are going to fight outnumbered at best.
---
&gt;so they've felt the need to make the T2 triglavian ships even more over the top because otherwise people would just use a vedmak.
---
Vedmak is pretty trash in every situation other than abyssal pvp, it's just about passable in smallgang nano with double TC's to make up for it's anemic base range, but leave it without any tackle or range control beyond it's own speed, which is just about made up for by it's decent base velocity/agility and tracking. (the Hac gains this base range but looses much of the velocity, gives it some better utility and tank in exchange for speed)
---
The low starting dps / alpha isn't only bad for big fleets where arty/rails are king. But also in smallgang, means whilst it applies great, you don't blap tackle as fast as traditional anti-tackle platforms. 
---
As far as how good the gun is it has some distinct advantages, but it is disingenous to say that it is the best in every scenario. Vulnerable to all ewar stopping ramp, low starting alpha/dps. No falloff which is something of a double edged sword. I mean 800dps at 60km is sick, but the usecases where you get to spool like that for 3 minutes are few and far between. The Zealot which is probably the most similar hac to the Ikit starts at almost double the dps at the same 60km range, with the possibility to project much past that making it harder to be kited.
---
It's the second best ship (muninn btw)
---
That is a wonderful painting.
---
Only because the core of the Warp Drive is always active and creates drag on spacetime itself. Going into Warp only involves extending the bubble to encapsulate the ship, and distorting the bubble to create the gradient that results in warp speeds. Shutting down the core is possible, but takes station power levels to re-start.
---
Trig capsule!
---
Come at us. Maybe even try it without becoming goonie pets in the process. If Siberian Squads leaves you guys for FI.RE you are all so fucked lmao, they are the only ones competent enough to get anything done in your dumpster fire of a "coalition". Sort is already unsheathing his knife again and is looking for backs to stab it into. Fun fact, our timers aren't in AUTZ so even if you wanted to you couldn't hurt us ;)
---
Does not really matter the cost.. when you have 5 FAXes on standby... followed by another 100 FAXes and hundreds of people able to provide backup within 5-10 minutes.
---
Yes occasionally a dread bomb will kill the super.  But everyone knows this is the exception not the norm.  Also with the change in insurance of dreads; its not so much a 'ha we won the isk war'.
---
most smaller groups that are good have higher requirements etc because you need to be a bit more self sustained. 
---
Being in a group like Pandemic Horde while you're new and low sp is fine, you can always leave later on once you can better fend for yourself
---
I tried to implement Held-Karp on my networkx graph I already had and got a MemoryError. lol. Guess I'll have to wait until my big PC gets fixed
---
https://zkillboard.com/region/10000060/group/659/losses/
---
And that's in THE safest region. Fact is that if you don't properly tank your super, it's not that difficult to kill. But knowing you, you almost only smallgang and solo (which is absolutely fine!), but it also means you don't get to see just how vulnerable a poorly fit super is.
---
Look at the kills. Most of them are fit badly. This is why they die. You make it sound like the fit doesn't matter, when the fit is THE most important thing
---
When would you use a drag bubble over a stop bubble and vice versa?
---
Gila stratios or battle ship honestly.. You wont get far without some luck. Try c2 sites in your flavor battlecruiser instead.
---
I already have the eve universe in network form as part of an earlier project, and can export in various formats. I can send it over if you want.
---
you mite be needing that muninn next week
---
The AT has a ruleset that allows them to not balance around the AT but also limit the impact of oppressive things like T2 drones.
---
Make a similar ruleset for Abyssal PvP, if they have to.
---
Can I get YouTube internet points for flying around HS in a shuttle?
---
https://zkillboard.com/region/10000060/group/659/ 168 kills 1 loss this week, seems real risky.
---
169 kills now another one popped up as I was typing this
---
ECM drones die very easily and are unreliable against cruiser hulls.
---
If that's your gamble for 30 minutes, be my guest.
---
If you read my post, you would realize that there are no cheap troll anti-ikitursa ships. There's no ship that can reliably kite it, there's no ship that can reliable tank it.
---
Did you forget the secret handshake?
---
Yeah because the majority of those people fit properly, so in the event they are caught, can be helped in time.
---
Don't get me wrong. Dropping your super in a place like delve (as a goon!) is extremly safe, but *only* if you fit correctly, hence the cost being more than 10b for a properly fit super
---
You dont need to anchor in Titans
---
If you can keep ECM drones alive for 30 minutes the other pilot is trash btw
---
also, ECM drones are unreliable against cruiser sized hulls, so expect them to fail quite a bit.
---
How to build empires 101
---
How so? Drop drones, let them stay for &lt;5 sec, if none of them proc and jam the other ship, recall them. Drop them again 10sec later. Rinse and repeat.
---
Scamming is something you really do solo. To learn that sit in Jita local and watch all the different scams, and see which are the hardest to spot. Then start setting up scam contracts in less obvious locations. Drunk buy orders are another good option, look up the margin trading scam on google for that. 
---
Piracy is a bit different. The two easiest ways to do it are joining CODE, or hunting explorers with a Dictor/Bomber/astero/stratios.
---
Abyss what? Who cares about that shit lol
---
There's no "Right to be forgotten" about your awful PvP Killboard.
---
A sacrilege with max tank lows that are A-typed and shit would struggle greatly after the resist debuff even against a no-damage-mod Ikitursa, according to my testing. If it fits one.... bye bye.
---
I can make the Ikitursa go over 3km/s on heat because I can pick drugs after I go in, with a web once I catch you and a 40km range on the gun. Like I said, if you wanna kite it in the restricted arena space you better be Jesus on wheels.
---
Indeed Test, Darkness, RR, Horde, Frat, Requiem basically anyone with a super umbrella are off limits.  So please tell me where these trig ships are destroying capitals.. where they weren't dying already.
---
Frigate vs almost anything, every time. also most solo leshaks will eat shit to a solo bhaal as they won't be fit to deal with that kind of pressure, unless they've massivley sacrificed on their own tackle / utility.
---
I too like to drop naked Aeon hulls on randoms
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/036/b29.jpg
---
CCP, please don't waste more time on a super niche area of gameplay hardly anyone uses, thank you.
---
&gt;load long range ammo in Ikitursa, stay 20km off. Drones will be lockable by the time they try and jam, start clearing them off. 
---
It's not hard to get rid of ECM drones my dude.
---
I only have a t2 cruiser that can run any low class DED site in the game THATS ALL lol.. No you should scan sites in HS till you get the hang of running DEDs and then maybe venture into low and WH space. Lowsec is "safer" till you get a dude with a cyno and a carrier that thinks hes funny.
---
Go google eve university ded sites.
---
oh l know its  dam god awful on my miners but hey l play the game for pve and abyssal sites not pvp ;P
---
Then who cares about your killboard. If it doesn't impact your playstyle (And it shouldn't, ever) then ignore it.
---
not trolling at all l was just adding my views to the convo and it did help time pass at a slow day at work and if l was trolling l would of put a bit more effort into it
---
Honestly a Lachesis comes to mind. Also don't forget these ships will require a lot of abyss mats, and if everyone starts losing 1 to the arena the economics will come into play. Good for everyone else.
---
This assumes you'll have range control in the ikitursa. I guess burst jammer could also be tested. Whatever the case it'll be something I'll tinker with, as it would be great fun to cuck a blingy ikitursa
---
Add another day. It's really not asking too much, considering all the money we give to CCP isn't reinvested back into EVE, but thrown away on mobile games or other such trash.
---
May as well at least let us have this.
---
I think I said retards die regardless.   
---
It seems all those supers deaths are to 10 man dread bombs or bombers bar.. not trig ships or small gang nano'ers at all.  
---
I am not sure I said anything about the super fit... However, I reference my comment about retards dying regardless.  If you don't know how to fit or move a super and you own a super... this is my definition of an eve retard.
---
You are also right... I don't think the game should be balanced around retards.
---
What you're not seeing is the ,000,000,000 behind it
---
The Lach wouldn't be able to stay out of range.
---
A huginn could try, but getting a huginn or rapier through the T3 requires some fitting because of the trash DPS, and the number of fights a 400m Huginn or Rapier are winning in the abyss = 0, so every time you go in you're writing off 400m.
---
l don't care about mine at all l was just adding that l believe people have the right not to have it shown on the 3rd party site, now on a official ccp site that's different go ahead.
---
For me its about 3rd party sites using data even if its only who killed who's space pixels.
---
Burst jammers don't break lock, same as regular ECM these days.
---
not with scrams alone, but you combine it with dmps. I haven't done the numbers but something to try.
---
Except in Tenal.
---
That's fine, but they shouldn't complain when we keep pulling further ahead.
---
HONOR TANK BRUH
---
I’ve just accepted that tackling a Kiki without backup on standby is suicide, even in my triple rep jaguar. 
---
They just have no weaknesses, it’s the dps and tracking of blasters on steroids but the range of artillery. 
---
They’re not invincible, and they are expensive, but the only ones I killed back in PH were the ones dumb enough to engage a ramjag, see the jag run, then re engage when the jag came back in a few minutes. And even then I wasn’t coming out of the fight alive either. 
---
If they completely lose tracking to let a jag get under guns with just mwd/scram that would obviously be too much, but they should definitely start to lose a good portion of their damage in that case, especially if the jag is dualprop.
---
The thing is, you don't get 800dps at 60km until 3 minutes into the fight.
---
When you need to be killing multiple enemy ships per minute, the Ikitursa is literal garbage. You'll rarely spool up to over 300 DPS.
---
Thanks very much for sharing!
---
The brown-ish part of the nebula is spectacular.  So many colours and gradients.  It has realism and depth.
---
The lower-right where the central mass begins is amazing.  It sort of reminds me of looking at an aerial photo of a coastline.  I couldn't begin to imagine how to paint that.
---
The central mass of stars is intriguing.  How does one paint a glowing ball of stars so it doesn't look like a white baseball?  The swirls in the paint are quite effective.
---
&gt;range control
---
&gt;capacitor management
---
&gt;transversal
---
&gt;drone management
---
&gt;heat management
---
:thonking:
---
Wonder what these bad boys will go for when they come out? 
---
They sound fun. I enjoy the drekavac.
---
TBF it's probably a better approach than "Eat a bucket of hot wings and run away from GOTG" circa 2k17
---
Where are they now?
---
Gila is the most killed ship in the Abyss because it dies to a LOT of things.
---
I am, that's why I unsubbed.
---
If you take a look at the abyssal pvp leader boards, it looks like there are only like 50 people in the entire game that go into the pvp area regularly. I would love to see some statistic from CCP on it. 
---
As for the abyssal pvp meta, it was always relatively rock, paper, scissor with piloting really only being a major factor in mirror matchup like vedmak v vedmak
---
Ive taught you well
---
Terrible Post probably don’t have balls to post with his Goon main.
---
Can you still buy that?
---
You mite be needing a few dozen extra eagles :)
---
Its really more knowledge then skill
---
&gt; The thing is, you don't get 800dps at 60km until 3 minutes into the fight.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; When you need to be killing multiple enemy ships per minute, the Ikitursa is literal garbage. You'll rarely spool up to over 300 DPS.
---
That is the point I was trying to make.
---
The Ikitursa only makes sense from the perspective of a small hac gang (15-30) where you are not facing significant enough numbers for either side to alpha-ing anything, and even then it's questionable.
---
C C PLEASE LET. ME. IN.
---
Then it turns out to just be a highsec hole into ass end of khanid.
---
not working :/
---
Why are you restricting yourself to in-class? Just bring a carrier and you'll win. Are you new to this game?
---
https://store.markeedragon.com/catalog/EVE_Items_Code_Second_Decade_Golden_Pod.html still a few places.
---
Marry her ! ... Oh wait
---
Knowledge is part of the skill
---
And yes, it's one of the main points
---
and none of that is particularly difficult to do
---
drones taking damage? pull in.
---
modules about to break? stop overheating.
---
what exactly is the skill required there?
---
transversal and range management is pretty easy as well, and it's not like capacitor management is all that difficult either.
---
capacitor getting low but shields full? just wait to press the boost button.
---
nothing is really that hard, and if you think it is you're a boomer who played starcraft 1 with 15 apm
---
Step 1: have freemove on
---
Step 2: noone in Squad command
---
Step 3: ????
---
Step 4: Profit
---
You *can* solo C5 sites but usually with a blingy fit, perfect knowledge of the spawns and good skills. 
---
Pretty suicidal to do it while diving though.
---
Good stuff. I need to watch more dreadnought pvp
---
I think a huge part of it might be limiting / removing the giant bonuses infrastructure upgrades give with a new system of varying things in different places. If people can get themselves +300% of some spawns by just sinking isk into it, they'll never have that much incentive to go for that tiny bit extra still.
---
Smartbombs. Light drones to kill them. There’s plenty of counters, unless you’re running something like a Stratios with nothing but EC-300s and can afford to lose a ton.
---
sure, if they fight, and if they don't just flee.
---
or if subcaps are just used instead.
---
keepstars might have content generally,    but astras, raitarus. aka the things spammed and what you spend 90% of structure bashes on,  are just that, mindless bashing with no fight
---
tldr; we need more things people will ACTUALLY FIGHT over.   and less of the spam that takes more time to kill than it takes to build, that is so cheap no one cares about spamming 5 of them for every one killed
---
1) Probably not. 
---
2) What the other guy said. You can't get around the diminishing returns.
---
That's caused by it being the most flown ship in abyssal space.
---
We've been over this. No one at ccp actually plays the fucking game anymore.
---
Smartbombs definitely work. Wether we'll see them on ikitursa or not, I don't know.
---
Light drones I doubt will work, depending on the skill of the player in the ransom ship and the lock speed of the ikitursa. The idea is to recall the EC drones just as the ikitursa locks them up
---
This is untrue, unless they've been patched in the last few months.
---
I prefer the term "warm butt"
---
ccp will say &gt; Yes, but only for omega
---
pfffff eagles, its about glias Pirate Faction best Faction
---
Just because you can't come up with something doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.
---
Maybe you're right. Maybe you're not. If everyone does start running these ships, there'll be a big incentive to come up with a counter. Let's see what happens :)
---
Keres can hold one indefinatley, a crucifier can make it's life miserable in a gang. Alternativley you can just blap it from range with most nanocruisers as the kiki is paper thin and has similar speed to an oni which is very similar in speed (it doesn't have to fight you granted, but neither do you it).
---
Don't get me wrong, the kiki is absolutley busted in it's weight class, its a good thing this game is focused on asymmetrical pvp.
---
I don't know the secret handshake 😭
---
Sac is not a good choice even vs vedmaks. And like I said I'd like to see it's total ramped up bonus toned down in lieu of movement or something else, otherwise it'll have too hard time in rest of the game and end up being grossly underused.
---
Its cancelled... maybe they should follow the way of the AT... start it again when they have balanced the non abyssal pvp and have resources available for it; 2068 looks promising.
---
The only way this reads to anyone is that you are too weak to fight provi directly so you have to resort to side games.
---
&gt;Blueballs
---
&gt;MAX TIDI FEST because someone hit jump instead of bridge
---
&gt;Peace treaty made, no change on sov map
---
ISK: Instalockers, Sabres and a Keres on the other side
---
Bob must be telling him to run for it then!
---
Yeah, but I'm guessing it has more to do with admiting that some people might be unable to log in 16 days in a row and still giving them a chance, not with the log in servers being fucked up.
---
VNIs with near2 bot networks that fuck off at the first sign of anything not blue isn't content.
---
It did before injectors were a thing
---
Deploying titan class space vessels outnumbered in the enemy staging system to delete an enemy fleet sounds like something elite baller class pvpers would do so stop being salty and just appreciate it
---
Lol EVERYONE IS A GOON PET
---
But yall ran away....
---
For real.
---
What fleet made it thought the cyno, later warps to F-Y gate. Reds warp in and jumps them off gate, the rest of provi fleet is cyno in. Red fleet fucks off without a fight.
---
You had more caps than we had gilas =((
---
We could've just walked away on the gate but we decided yolo lets try to take a few down
---
Skill tank all the way like a true warrior
---
35bil is as low as they get
---
Much praise
---
I’m no mathematician but 42-30 = 12 not 5
---
And you're point?
---
This gets posted like something great happen.
---
Yea sure you warp the provi fleet and DD. Good for you and leason learn. But after that...
---
Come on..
---
But I work weekends
---
Iki will probably get at least one smartbomb, ec-300 are really squishy and die within a few cycle. Also they aren't very reliable as they have poor % sucess, especially if you lose a bunch of them In the process.
---
/r/iamverybadass
---
Preach, the fact that they totally overlooked the vedhac's inpact on the instanced abyss 1v1's gives me hope they are not looking to expand on it thank the lord.
---
Who is "SP" and why is he in jail?
---
😀
---
Perfect summary, abyssal pvp still suffer from the lack of real resist malus and stalemate is still an issue In most fight. If this goes live we can expect to see the folks who do regulary abyss to fly that until they get bored of stalemating each other, as all others ship can't curently fight back the Iki, not speaking about the vedmak who's just worse In every relevant point.
---
  basically anyone with a super umbrella are off limits

And that's just a handful over the last 48 hours.
---
There’s always SOMEONE, in every goddamn war, who makes a fuckup like that, and that’s the one story everyone will remember from that war.
---
ECM hello.
---
What was it though, now you have to tell us.
---
Even better, our guys farm Guristas LP all the time.
---
I was on that team too, and still am owed billions.  Anveri is exactly the wrong person to be on the CSM.
---
He's childish, selfish, and generally inept.  His contribution to the AT team was nothing in comparison to the other co-captain, who was the real force behind that team.  Without Cald we wouldn't have gotten anywhere.
---
Anveri's response to being called out for his mistakes was to ragequit the practice session.  This happened multiple times, often resulting in the practice session being cancelled, just because he bailed.  The guy was inconsolable.
---
Seriously, this guy burned his bridges with me, and if he gets on the CSM that would just be another selfish, immature asshat out for his own best interests.  We don't need more bad leaders on the CSM.  We need people that will actually work in the best interests of the player base, and Anveri isn't that person.  I don't usually get involved in the whole Eve politics thing, but I will be voting against him, and you should too.
---
edit:  Clarification over ragequitting and more general hate on my part.
---
Globby just suicide ganks and bitches on Reddit like a bittervet.
---
Good thing, too. Otherwise there wouldn't be any fights.
---
Still not a lot. Everyone pays their but its like 10 minutes if your time
---
"Sometimes, they make loads of mistakes and come to us, 'We have beeeen so baaad.'." &gt;;]
---
Rise rage is always fun to watch.  Always upvote RiseDrama.
---
I see it as one of two possibilities:  Either CCP is trying to kill the abortion they created (abyssmal PVP), or it's just more proof that the people designing the game don't actually play or understand the the game.
---
At the [10-year-anniversary concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWmGNRoGLhc), they had the music of EVE played by the Icelandic philharmonic orchestra, which was a -phe-no-me-nal- experience. REALLY good.
---
During that concert they’re displaying EVE scenery. You can see some of that in the video but not the whole time.
---
At some point they’re showing ships. The ship they’re showing is a Moros. It has four hard points [not populated]. Obviously this is not what you would expect to see. I was in the room for the experience, you could hear a few people holding their breath. *WTF is THAT!?*
---
At some point they must have thought about making something, or it was a mockup for something, but you could clearly see the fourth hard point. It was not aligned with the other three.
---
I have only ever seen that one image of it, I’ve never seen another reference to it.
---
Damn right. Everyone’s all settled down in Null these days- nobody wants to have a real fucking war. Goddamn reinforcement timers are no help.

Bro, there are literally fully fitted supers in bas right now that are 17bil, so yeah with a poverty Yolo fit you can probably get a fitted super at not much more then 12bil if you go t1 rigs and t1 fighters. So it's not much of an exaggeration.
---
Nope. You guys are just awful at fittings. It has talisman set and it fits nicely. Just takes a bit of knowledge of the mechanics, which many nowaday eve players truely lack of.
---
ps
---
No, no abyssals.
---
Same here  "Handshake Failed - Server Failure" just when my corp was doing a hostile takeover of my anus
---
2 titans used in the enemy capital system is a side game ? lol
---
Better than a lowsec to Aridia or a nullsec to ORE space. And then there are the end of life C5 connections you just don't want to take in the fear of getting lost there forever.
---
Fixed XD
---
thanks
---
This is a super well put together post.  It makes easily the case for fixing it (banning of the ship) seem the best option.
---
BTW, it would be an Avatar and Erebus class Titan. Not a Titan-class. Ship naming conventions are &lt;Class&gt; &lt;Type&gt; &lt;Name&gt;
---
So a Nyx class supercarrier *W.S.S. Discovery* or a Machariel class battleship *W.S.S. SirPwnsAlot* (W.S.S. Waffle Space Ship)
---
So shouldn’t we pay attention to who is botting now, not who was botting 5 years ago?
---
To be fair, there is literally no reason for why you would need to fit faction, let alone deadspace, to any super under a super umbrella. T2/t1 will work just fine.
---
Wait what, a naming list?  How is this not a joke.
---
Just slide into wormhole space, my man.
---
It's the last safe refuge.
---
We're all niche. Not that niche, maybe. But dismissing somebody else's niche is a pretty precarious position.
---
&gt; just more proof that the people designing the game don't actually play or understand the the game.
---
The dev team has changes a lot since the original core design was made.
---
Page errors out. The latest Jita-type scam starts on Reddit!
---
You got a sign from Bob!
---
Nah, it's a question of priority.
---
[This sort of thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bkip1j/disparity/) isn't limited to Abyssal PVP. T3s roaming WHs would be another example of where they will end up blowing up almost everything they find.
---
Default + black = two things.
---
Bots are rampant in every constellation of new eden I’ve had a mining bot fleet show up in my home area as well as a shitty pve bot that would bump the wrecks while looting due to it being a bad program 
---
So in short bots CAN AND WILL KILL EVE unless null blocs kick them out and ccp actually get a system in place to ban the bots quicker
---
ISK ration, KD, etc can go a long way to showing your value as a pilot to a corp leader or proving any claims you might make about not being a carebear.
---
yep.  basically that
---
Sov defended, op success!
---
Ccp doesn't actually play eve. I don't know why this surprises anyone anymore
---
You can't update orders remotely. Most be done at PC.
---
Only thing I noticed or cared about: Nice little bling fleet that Provi is flying.
---
If the most common comment on killmarks is 'where do I find the killmarks on X' CCP should realise they need to be fixed, maybe by 2050.
---
**[citation needed]**
---
Can't, busy making another dead on arrival game.
---
I think it's pretty damn obvious by now that they don't play the game anymore
---
BEGONE THOT
---
Done.  I left the mouse ear, I figured it was appropriate.
---
No! Go away! Your hands are dirty!
---
I have a negative wallet on a toon from RMT I did years ago.  CCP doesn’t only perma-ban people.

&gt; Dropping your super in a place like delve (as a goon!) is extremly safe, but only if you fit correctly, hence the cost being more than 10b for a properly fit super
---
that's like saying swimming in a knee deep pool is extremely safe, but only if you don't forget to keep your head over water. They don't even need to fit them properly, there are alliance fits they copy.
---
Piracy? You must be confused. CODEdot and the New Order lawfully battle bots and bot-aspirants. Illegal miners are the pirates. The Law of Highsec is the Code.

I'm not sure they're really all that different. I guess perhaps you could say a drag bubble is to force a fleet as a certain range from you, whereas a stop bubble is further away and attempting to prevent them from getting to you. If your enemy fleet is in Muninns and you're in ham drakes, you'd want bubbles very close so they can't warp in at range, so you drag them into brawling distance.
---
Stop bubbles could then be if you've tackled a rorq you might place them in line with a keepstar at 100km from the rorq to try to stop it being able to help.
---
The one that'll catch the most people. 
---
I suspect it doesn't really matter but perhaps there's a slight advantage of drag bubbles making you turn around to reach the gate.
---
There's not a lot of functional difference. Stop bubbles are easier to make as you can just warp from gate A to B at range, or align towards gate A from B and keep going until you are at the desired range - both methods will produce a perfect stop bubble. Also, if a drag bubble is over 150km away from the gate, a ship that lands in it can almost immediately turn back and warp to the gate anyway. So I don't see any clear reason to use a drag bubble over a stop bubble, personally.

RRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I'm not really a heavy drinker. I only really get mega drunk on the Friday and Saturday nights.
---
Why one when you can have ten.
---
I also do low sex and null :)
---
How can they tell they’re bots?
---
Lmao no but i do enjoy a good meme
---
hope all is well friend, whoever you are (◕‿◕ ) (sorry for not recognizing that username)
---
Yeah but I'm one day behind those 3 so I need one day to get that sweet sp lol

---
No they won't... I'll just bring me and my friends in machs to kill it. Solo HACs are never going to be a valid balance concern.

Why bother, 3.1b Jita market https://evemarketer.com/types/33329

Hey,

Ily
---
Thanks,
---
and you think they died due to the trig ships?
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30004344/201905111900/ one of the BRs..
---
but indeed you are right since you have posted some bad players... I can do similar things:
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30004666/201805170100/ (no trig ships here)
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30004759/201902010000/ (no trig ships here).
---
If you think that an super umbrella does not make people 99% safe you are stupid... however; yes the 1% do die.
---
Your screenshot it so low quality I can’t even see the names
---
No tldr? Fuck you
---
Please also retain the name of my pod when I enter a ship so when I leave ship I dont have to rename it to Plexhauler again.
---
Sucka
---
I know there are a lot of regional discords, is there one for the KC area that you know of?

Hate to say it... but Bisu was indeed correct.
