&gt;I just yolo'ed my Nyx on the top of 20 man rupture fleet, killed 2 of them, rest of them bailed. Whole Rupture fleet was worth 700mil. While my Nyx is woth 20bil which is 28 times more. Do I deserve to to be able to drop on them that gang an annihilate them? Oh f\*ck indeed I should!! I made my effort and invested decent amount of isk to be able to do that! Would I yolo the same Nyx on a 20 man Legion fleet with logi support? perhaps not, because that's 20 man who made some effort too, and that gang is worth pretty much the same amount of isk as my Nyx is.
---

---
The problem is that you're able to deploy an asset this powerful, capable of completely wiping out an otherwise solid smallgang, without any support whatsoever. Supercapitals are fleet killers, and they by and large have killed the smallgang meta, forcing people who want content to blob up so they can pose an actual threat. You shouldn't be able to just drop a single ship and obliterate an entire fleet, that is massively overpowered.
---
&gt;My Erebus just popped some frigs on gate who could not keep the right transversal . Oh wait that's unfair. How come 4000 times isk worth more ship is able to do that? Because he made and EFFORT and bought it. But wait my Erebus got tackled ratting and they dropped 10 dreads on me. God damn how come 1.5 cheaper gang is able to pop such an expensive ship? That is not right. We should nerf anticap dreads.

Personally, my ideal EVE atm would be Panfam, Imperium, and Legacy being enemies.  I think you need at least three groups at odds to make things interesting.

More is better but when CCP figures out how to force that EVE is saved so idk.
---
We can't leak information we don't know ourselves.
---
If you remove the "blob" you will remove any hope to erased supercapital fleets, right now supers and titan are dying, time to time, but it will never impact Mineral Economy or Nullsec politics, if tomorrow you dread bomb few titan from goons, yeah you will have some reddit karma but that's it but if tomorrow You do a supercap/titan brawl  you erased goons superfleet delve won't be the same, goons won't be the same, nullsec will change, sov will change, economy will change, you get the point.
---
For me it's the other way around, yeah solo pvp with titan/super is funny but it doesn't do anything good for eve, you hurt small/medium size gang, you hurt economy by making space super safe with umbrella. EVE have way to much way of making super/titan but less way to killing them, CCP should encourage B-R to reset titan/super number
---
Hey can you it up again? I might wanna give this a try.

Sir, this is a Wendy's and you don't work here. I'm calling security.

I don't care about people losing or winning dank isk, but I can hardly bear the raffle related banter on comms. The hype is getting to my nerves. Grr.

Absolutely. I got stuck late at work tonight, but I'll be on tomorrow

 *"Implants can't be used by poor/new players because of the huge randomness of losing a pod..."*

Based on this logic lets keep it to only corvettes while we're at it, and only civilian guns,  and no skill improvements either. Because new players just logging in haven't learned about training or improved modules or better ships. (end sarcasm)

So... bring 140 people to fight, complain no one fights back? Grow some and take that to either Test or Goon space where they can match your numbers. Or are you too risk adverse?

Believe me. Give it a few weeks.  Hypernet wealth creation will attract both lawyers and regulatory agencies just as well as raffle. Don't say I didn't warn you #CCP!
---
Even though it mostly comes down to damage output, there are some mechanical differences 
---
* fighters can only be launched from carriers, super-carriers and structures
---
* fighters can be controlled manually - the carrier pilot can set a custom orbit or even order them to go to a specific point in space
---
* each fighter has 3 active abilities, which differ depending on the fighter. For instance, a light fighter has a primary and secondary weapon, as well as a prop mod. The secondary weapon doesn't auto-repeat, so it has to be cycled manually for every shot, and it can run out of ammo until the fighter docks up to reguel/rearm. The prop mod lasts for 30 seconds and then has a cooldown. 
---
* Fighters come in squadrons, and their effectiveness scales with how many are left in the squadron. A light fighter squadron consists of 9 fighters. If you kill 4 of them, it will only be about half as effective. Fighters do not respawn on their own. 
---
* fighters have infinite control range - as long as the operator can lock something, they can send their fighters after it
---
* support fighters are much stronger than e-war drones in comparison. Specifically, Sirens can warp disrupt a target, and Dromis can apply a strong web to it. This means carriers come equipped with strong tackle abilities, which is a somewhat controversial topic at the moment. 
---
* fighters can be recalled even from a different grid. They will warp back to their carrier on their own. 
---
In practice, fighters deal a *ton* of damage (a regular carrier usually does 2-3k DPS), but they can struggle to apply to frigates or even 10MN cruisers/BC. They are also way harder to kill.
---
Classic misinformation
---
They seem interesting as a permanent feature... but the supply should probably be heavily limited, since free rolls for a few frigates is unlikely to create much content longterm, leaving the "attacker" entirely uninvested means they can be risk averse. Increased rarity, and thus cost, could still allow occasional "just for fun" fleets with frigates but otherwise be something you would want to bring some bigger/costlier ships for, if you want to not burn ISK (in the form of the filaments) having to reroll a hundred times to find something you can fight.
---
I'm also not sure how the mechanics work exactly (haven't used them yet); if they allow fleeing from fights as well that's rather bad to have permanently.
---
It's GOTG..... That's like me declaring war on a puppy.

Sort of surprised it wasn't another announcement about heading to Providence.

Apparently they expire tommorow
---
If you like shooting stuff, do the Sisters of Eve epic arc.  Some of it will feel repetitive, but it’s good for faction standings and just getting more into PvE combat in the game.  Helps if you are doing at least 100 DPS (the final boss can tank anything less).  Otherwise, train up the scanning skills and do exploration stuff.
---
&gt; omplaint here? It's just a branded double walled insulated container.
---
No complaint at all. The Lacrimix bottle was something that was very EVE, but disappeared from the store rather quickly. That it is labeled reprint leads me to think they noticed players were after it and ordered a second batch.
---
RR is busy ratting up the iskies to pay.
---
Not really. It's still 100% legal to the letter and intent of the law.
---
Avoiding unnecessary lawyering isn't filthy. It's practical.
---
It doesn't use a cash equivalent, so the lawyers can try all they want.
---
Sort doesn’t backstab. He stabs in the front. He is not a subtle guy.
---
Been away from the game for a long-ass time. Anyone care to explain why this is so?

Missions and ratting basically
---
yep :)
---
The joy of finding a comment perfectly balanced in condescension and horse shit.
---
I don't like the lack of upvotes
---
&gt;but no spool on cyno is a problem as there is no real counter to "instant".
---
That's what you are confused about. Where does the understanding break down?
---
&gt;Capitals are used when they are needed which isn't very often in the current meta.
---
Or when some just want to bait people and instantly transform into a fleet. You appear extremely unaware of the realities of mechanics that are instant.
---
&gt;You must be the only one complaining about cynos being instant.
---
Of course that's false, but many people do abuse cynos and they want what is good for them even if it kills the game.
---
A lot of us Carebears don't want do deal with losing ships when transversing null-sec. If you want to have a war, take it to Legion or Goonswarm rather than gate camping.

I have a network of public clone bays that I set up around highsec a long time ago, back when I played this game. I filled them all with about 5 years worth of fuel, about a year ago it all finally went isk positive and I earn about 100m a day in clones fees. im getting into the 100 billion range worth of income... but I just log in to see the number keep going up, not that I'll ever use it or play this boring game again. and before you ask, no it's probably not worth the effort for anyone to try and do this themselves... I think people use my clone bays out of habit, that took years to develop and at this point im sure highsec is over saturated with clone bays for people to use... its weird, there are free clone bays in most of the system mine are in, and yet people still use mine for a fee?  like I said, I think im just lucky, even though isk is worthless to me (not worthless enough for me to give it away, dont even bother asking) just giving you something to think about.
---
It's just really expensive to make. So only dedicated explorers will use it.
---
As the integrated analyzers get both the relic and the data bonus you get the highest coherence possible. They also allow the bonus from the Blackglass implant to apply to relic hacks making things really easy. 
---
The real problem is the price. It quadruples the cost of my exploration Astero. And the Frostline analyzer is still about half the price and has almost the same bonus. So I will use that for now.

It makes me sad because when you open the app and start playing it's clear that the foundation is there to make a not-shit game, like there is no reason for them to have done what they did other than "accessibility" and it's still not even that easy to navigate

Mind. Blown!

Give me back my 4 seconds damn it!
---
Dude...
---
If you bought plex to another player with isk, it's still a plex sink. Those isks didn't disappear, they are still in the economy.
---
Then why don't they use the commonly accepted terms for what it is? Why does it not use the words `ticket`, `raffle` or `lottery`?
---
There is more to this, ex-horde, got kicked and blacklisted for being a dick, went to goons, rest of the story above \^
---
Expanding fw and getting more players into pvp corps will boost pvp imho.
---
It is most likely the same player with multiple accounts.
---
Other options:
---
1. The Rorquals belong to the same player and he has given them to other players, who did not bother to rename them.
---
2. The Rorquals belong to a group of players and to be honest, naming ships numerically is more common than you think.
---
And after all that you then cut us in for a large part of the profit
---
Would you rather have CONCORD point and laugh at you when it's ganked, or be able to have all the mechanics of lowsec available for your security &amp; logistics?
---
Sounds like "everything that helps krabs is good, rest is shit".

Right, as if everything you mention haven't been solved years ago. Geostrategy might matter if it wasn't for all those bridges and shit.

There's blind people playing Diablo 3 and path of exile. I wouldn't even know how they do it. But there must be some high tech screen reading going on.
---
It's kinda like the equivalent of a 3-foot club-footed pygmy trying to play basketball with the NBA boyz and using a mech to compensate. Not everybody can equally do everything. Sorry-not-sorry. You'll never get to experience it the way it was meant to, or play the game equally. It's not a shot against you OP, sometimes you just get dealt a shitty hand. I'm not gonna lie to you like everyone else and encourage you to find all these crutches. You just aren't going to experience it the way it was meant to be. You could be the nicest person on the planet, and you can see stories of other gimps "playing" and "doing it" but the cutaway is they all had to force something that wasn't designed for them, resulting in a MARGINAL experience.
---
ISK has no real world value, haven't you been listening to CCP lawyers as to why this isn't unlicensed gambling?
---
Yeah but why should I fly anything which have no use after the first three days? Don't get the concept behind those ships. 
---
Of course I assume all other ships are better, I don't have access to the game.
---
Vexors tank kin
---
The best part is that there was only ~5 of us in comms fighting your entire fleet. 
---
If you want a fight why don’t you arrange an honor brawl slyce or some other ‘valued’ ally?
---
3 seconds into the video and you have me hooked. The graphics are spicy; no sarcasm.
---
yeah, playing the game in order to play the game just sounds terrible. *shrug*
---
Yes. Because I would never have any reason to move that ship.
---
Ah yes mr. linemember with all the info.
---
Ah ok, so propulsion mods and tank in the midslots aren't even a thing?
---
Strange thing trying to think outside of EVE.
---
Translation: "Mimimi, people don't spoon feed us free kills."
---
&gt;Rant over just think this game could be so much better without kbs and sad clowns.
---
I agree with you, I just think you aren't aware who the sad clowns are.
---
I mean I understand it in the real world, it has value, it will continue to appreciate in price. 
---
I do not understand it in EvE.
---
Spicy
---
Escort missions would be alright, through low sec, protect this shitty t1 hauler would induce pvp.
---
What kind of ship is needed to run these?
---
They swapped Day 3 &amp; Day 8
---
See [Patch Notes](https://www.eveonline.com/article/q2anm5/patch-notes-for-december-2019-release)
---
it would, but i would T1 the rigs, T2 rigs are stupidly expensive for what they offer you for this fitting.
---
Faction warfare hasn't been patched out? Where's lowsec? - CCP
---
The Triglavians stole your files
---
Yeah, I noticed that too. I still had other rigs installed and it didn't show me their price because of that. I had to substitute them for T1 rigs because I am too poor to be able to afford them yet.
---
You make a good point.
---
We had the same situation during the Quiet War in Etherium Reach back then , the war lenght for more than a year mainly because of timezone tanking. Prothean were very good fighters tough, the best the ex DCU had back then , to a point the DRF didn't deserved them as ally in the first place. But timezone tanking manage to extend their lifetime for a fucking while....until we won the sov attrition game merely because they ended up dropping the balls before we did.
---
It was more a battle of wills and patience than anything else in the end. 
---
So yeah , fuck timezone tanking !
---
you must be dreamin, there sure is some kind of retarded agreement between you and test about not destroying the others t2 ships or whatever
---
Which does make sense, but when over half the game is that "alt" and spends pretty much all of their time doing it, it's hard to argue that's the case anymore. With how much is being mined/ratted in eg. delve, there is zero argument that that ISK is going to another part of the game to fund pvp. Let alone all the other null regions, on top of that. Most of that ISK and materials are just... sitting.
---

I always thought eve uni was supposed to teach you basic skills then you leave for a proper corp.
---
It's a hand-eye coordination game.  Remember Bloodsport, when shidoshi had dux snatch a fish out of the pond - right before he taught him the din mak?  Once skilledpigeon can block a spammer, he is ready for kumite and can finally leave Jita.
---
Loyalty points. I’ve never done faction warfare. You build up social skills necessary and target specific items per calculator. (Don’t bother with ammo) but it gives an enormous rate of return and effort to isk is off the hook.
---
About 10 mins ago it was really bad, whole fleet experienced it
---
Yeah I have that gate TIDI bs as well, it feels like the game's about to DC you or something.
---
b-but INIT is a strong independent alliance that isn't actually goon!
---
Yes
---
eve uni’s only purpose for new players should be the wiki. you’ll get much better new player experiences in literally any other corp (except scam newbro corps ofc)
---
A few times, yeh
---
Wow, reading that forum thread was just depressing, genuine feedback being met by strawman arguments, words being put into mouths, and what I can only describe as "safe space" mentality.
---
If you mess up, people should be able to call you out for where you messed up, which the people in that thread were doing, and in a constructive manner.
---
Only to be met with "please only give constructive criticism", and threats from "leadership".

Always included e-uni in the list of places newbros should consider checking out, after this I won't be doing that.

---
that is probably because you clicked download everything, If you find yourself in need of storage space, not checking that button cuts down the file size enormously (given you occasionally verify and purge the cache). Without that option, the game downloads only the assets that are needed to start the game and then downloads everything else as needed.
---
the downside to do it that way is that it will take longer to load stuff like systems when there are assets that have not been downloaded in use there.
---
Edit: if you have not clicked that option, then it is because eve is an old game that has gotten a lot of revamps and added assets and because of that demands a larger install folder. And it should be noted that a lot of triple A titles are getting up there in the install size as well.
---
Remember now that Pandemic Horde has a hisec division too to help new players who don't want to be in Null.
---
Eve uni, brave newbies, brand newbros (part of TEST) karmafleet (only if you love mining) and pandemic horde are all good nullsec groups. My personal preference is wormhole space, which is a little less accommodating to newbies, but definitely worth a try at some point. Spoopy newbies is where I’m right now, which is great.
---
The issue here is not that they took the fight and everyone died, thats common for uni and perfectly fine.
---
I suggest to read through the thread actually for this particular topic, there is of course some salt in some of the comments, but basically its trying to figure out what went wrong, and trying to give some feedback. And some feedback was that an experienced FC would have made more out of the situation.
---
The FCC (Fleet Command Course) of the uni has also some recommendations, so that new fc start with frigate doctrines, get some basic experience and then slowly move up to cruiser, bc etc. It has (or had, most got banned after it) also some  more experienced FCs which are supposed to give feedback. To be fair the FCC itself was kinda dead before sadly.
---
What here happened was now that some director who has basically only a minumum of pvp experience lead a full BC fleet, with for uni standards highly blinged out support (even with different propmode, but thats a different story), welped it and then after some feedback said its not helpful and declared it more or less as personal attacks.
---
Also, maybe nice to know (or a try to explain some salt in the aar thread), everything related to structures has to get an director approval in advance, one of the main arguments from the management+ in this thread is to step up and FC them if we \[the people who gave feedback\] can do it better. I tried to get this approval at least twice (actually for ewar training fleets), and never got it. I imagine i can't be the only one.
---
but that post is all about how the leaderships is literally depriving them of a lot of the learning by censoring criticism and feedback of more experienced players. Kind of a moot point then, isn't?
---
Oof, please share that, seems juicy.
---
As someone who is not in the nullsec loop, what is it on the CSM that lead you to conclude this and why are so many people out to get this guy? Genuinely curious.
---
Honestly, I don't really care, I'm just here to poke that Reddit burner account mad man.
---
That’s pretty much my thinking. :-) Besides, it’s not my first rodeo, even if 9 times out of 10 I strike out when trying to make games playable, there’s always one more try.￼

Yes, so obvious that I continued performing the role for nearly 6 months until I stopped doing so of my own accord.

Thanks mate. You've helped me more than I thought anyone could have. I've made a mistake of  jumping from one bad, dull, dead and dishonest corp to another and meanwhile I've been reading about eve university. I never knew they were also a corp rather than a helpful website. To me, they sound like home. How to apply?

This sounds juicy, what happened?
---
As a **card-carrying member** of the **"troublemaker who was managed out" club**, I felt it was finally time to post.
---
We've seen two posts in the last 3-4 mo shaming EUni leadership into a sea of defensive toxicity.    
---
Those posts were not wrong.  All true... all very real... 
---
But here's the thing.  **I love EUni.**  Still love her...   
---
She gave me my first REAL friends in this game.  
---
She taught me the difference between low-sex and null-sex and wormholes.  
---
She helped me learn to scout, fly logistics, FC fleets (badly).
---
How is this possible?  Such a toxic place creates such devotion?  
---
**It was a safe place to learn.**  No one was going to tell me how much of an idiot I was...  
---
*(well maybe one person and he can still go f\*ck himself... happy I didn't swear in the EUni thread guys?)*
---
**For a Newbro, EUni actually is a great place to be**... its a Sh\*t place to be once you actually know something.  
---
Once you know things the resident Oldbros, hanging around desiring relevance in a community they left long ago, will become jealous and defensive... and exert imaginary power.
---
As a Newbro EUni will give you **exactly as much as you want to get out of it**.  I wanted to learn everything... I tried everything, and the beauty of EUni over all those other "Newbie Corps" is that you actually CAN try all the things.  You don't have to move out to Horde Space or Imperium, don't have to commit to certain fleets, can be a pirate one day, an industrialist the next... go on big fleets, live in wormholes.  All while you are "testing" out what you like, learning new things, and training up those ever important skills.
---
**There really is nothing like it in all of EvE from what I've seen and absolutely the best thing for a Newbro New Eden has to offer.**
---
Problems?  Yup they got them... the #1 being that leadership does not PVP, never really did PVP, kinda hates PVP deep down and **treats anyone who prioritizes PVP as a threat**.  PVP is actually what makes EvE great.  Everyone knows this... CCP knows this...studies prove this over and over.  Doesn't matter if your sh\*t at it... that's your ego's problem, not PVP's problem.  But that's really the only true problem.  
---
Are there douchebags? Power-hungry insecure gamer-children in charge?  Yah for sure... but they exist throughout New Eden and are in no way exclusive to EUni.  Hell not even exclusive to EvE... I think I have two of those people at my work.
---
I will 100% continue to recommend EUni, despite the fact many of my friends no longer do so.  It is actually good for **REAL Newbros**, and they will get out of it as much as they desire.  I'm not saying that to get in any good graces either.  To my knowledge, I am in a small *special* population of troublemakers who are still banned from all chat channels and Mumble and not even welcome to mentor or even attend fleets of my friends within EUni.  I'm special! *(I'm also on discord mentoring Unistas daily ;)  You can't stop the signal baby!)*
---
I still love you EUni... **keep thinking of the Newbros first and always**.  Not those who have grown up and are ready to move on... and not your own pathetic self-relevance.  Looking forward to the day those Newbros can come and try to kill me... I'll be your huckleberry.

Buying your own nodes insures you get the money for the nodes you already sold, plus you get to keep the items when you win the raffle and the isk that more than pays for the item if you don't win.
---
Simply said, just set the price at 4x the regular value, wait until some idiots buy up about 25% of the nodes to pay for the full price of the item and then some. Pay yourself for the remaining nodes and potentially keep the item plus the ISK worth more than the item itself.
---
Not a scam, just a clever trick really you still need to watch and make sure you buy the remaining nodes before too many other players do but even if you sell out you just made 400% profit so go buy the same item at regular price and dupe the idiots again.
---
Free money really, made billions in only days winning my own items back with the ISK of sold nodes too and only lost one item so far but still sold it for 1.5x maximum market value.

---
I can confirm, as the recently stepped-down Director of Dilpomacy at the Uni, that the upper leadership (the CEO and her very small band of Merry Men) will be the death of the corporation within the game. I believe the Uni has the potential to be so much better for the game and new players than it currently is,  which is why I originally felt stepping up to leadership was a huge opportunity.
---
I soon realised however, that the main issue the Uni has in doing so is that the so called ‘leadership’ are so removed from the game and current meta it’s actually extremely counter productive. The CEO herself, never came from the position of an actual ‘undock and fly spaceships all the time’ type of player. She has predominantly spent all her time in the Uni and the game as an admin person. Don’t get me wrong, these people play a very important role in the running of large groups, but in this case make absolutely useless leadership.

I sat in a meeting shortly before calling the CEO out on this and leaving, where one Director chimed in with comments that clearly showed absolutely zero knowledge of current game mechanics. After the initial war HQ changes, I led a combined effort along with FC’s from TGRAD, to hit the PIRAT structure. The initial plan being to destroy all three timers. This itself took a week of negotiations on my part with other members of leadership who were predominantly scared of the content this may produce. One statement even being along the lines of, “if Uni members want experience of shooting a structure we’d be better putting our own one up for them to shoot”. 
---
I left after trying to make numerous changes - both on behalf of the Uni as a whole and specifically the Null Sec Campus - all in the name of content and learning, but was shot down every time because, well, content outside of alpha level High-Sec PVE is apparently not really wanted at the Uni. 
---
This overriding thought on how the Uni should be run, made even worse by a leadership who don’t log in, don’t undock and consistently show a lack of understanding of a game that’s moved on from 10 years ago is what leads to numerous posts like this OP finding there way to r/eve and why this will just continue without any changes happening anytime in the distant future.
---
The biggest downside to all of this is that CCP actively promote the Uni as a great place for new players. Based on the UniWiki, rightly so. Unfortunately in doing so however, they actively promote a corporation that inside the game is next to useless, toxic and slowly dying.

From what I can gather he gave another guy on Open Comms a f*ck you. I guess even NC. is now tired of his childish behavior.

Im holding out on a Filement to stain.

Cause your mom plays the game

It’s been many years since I was in e uni. All in here to say is back when I was there the war decs were the best thing going on

Hypernet Offer : Orca 12/16 left
---
Bid now
---
Don't understand. You were just threatening people....
---
CVA is a great group, we’ve been having a lot of fun and learning a lot from their guys. NRDS is a really refreshing change, it’s nice to see people working together instead of just griefing each other like children.
---
Are you docked?
---
If not then you are vulnerable
---
Anyone who kills Inner Hell, even goons, are good people.
---
Oh god haha Imagine thinking that you're the only person that know how cloaking works, *clicks undock* "you stole my 2005 video"
---
Hearing "hypercore", the last thing I would think of is a stupid raffle ticket.

“But muh excavators”

We will all disappear at an arbitrary point in the future, and most of our stuff will follow.
---
Not to mention that not all collectors offload their collections during their life. For them personally their investment ends up almost as dead as in-game item that will be deleted eventually.
---
For real haha XD Here’s the “original” that I apparently ripped off:

It was from 2011, not 11 years old I guess - only 9 years old lmao
---
Look how dated this is. The UI Is older than the wind. This is *still the video currently posted on the Eve uni website*. Talk about fucking delusions of grandeur
---
I had a RL friend join me in Brave when I was really new.  All I knew were the packs of atrons they sold 5 at a time.  We welped frigates into the fleet that was kiting us until my buddy left the game and never came back.  That was in like 2014.
---
New players shouldn't fly tackle.
---
And to point out the disconnect, the convo on the Uni Staff slack thinks this all about the fight.  
---
What is it they say about leading a horse to water?

Space Nerds

oh no what will i do

&gt; Rightclick name -&gt; Block

&gt;Which hey, might be why Uni’s PvP campuses are becoming ghost towns.
---
Interesting use of the present participle. I'm not sure that the present tense is accurate anymore. If the Wormhole Campus has to go on ops with Spoopy in order to get the numbers to do anything (based on some killmails that I've seen recently), things are bad.
---
How's EVE these days? Haven't played since before citadel's. I've wanted to return, but I also want to actually stick around this time.
---
5 years? Try 9...
---
Dude! Why you gotta do me like this, you know I like my popcorn sweet not salty!
---
As if you've forgotten about all those evenings we spent holding hands at the cinema together *angry face*
---
ya... looked promising for a few minutes there.. that happened fast lol, back to the -10 group.. or at least -10 in every enemy FC's eyes.
---
Well maybe if you treated me with more respect I would take your opinions on board and not be disappointed by my life choices...
---
It's quite amazing how much nicer local becomes after about 5 minutes of doing that
---
i have reached a point on my Jita alt that i can have a casual, conversation w/ people in there, the blocklist is very, very long

Guy is probably salty because he tried to scam people on hypernet and it backfired and he fucked himself over.

STAIN RUSSIANS STATEMENT
---
We have woken up from our typical Vodka stupor to find ourselves abandoned once more.  We were looking forward to TEST attack on Stain but instead we got this half-assed declaration of intent.
---
Even declarations of war have become shit. 
---
We shall hold TEST to their word and if they refuse to finally deal with Stain menace once and for all, we shall come to Esoteria proper. 
---
To good fights!
---
herc

PS Sort Dragon was with us for B-R. He is alright no matter the latest idiocy he conjures.
---
This is gold
---
Is Legacy big enough though to launch that kind of offensive on the other side of the map without burning out?
---
The true secret is goon supers with titans. Move a full filament wirth of supers with 1-2 titans with them. Super packed full of ships and titans have clone vats and bridges. Now you have a 200 man goon subcap fleet within bridging range of you across the universe
---
EARZ!

How come you've never drawn me a picture. Just lead me along and then cast me aside aye? *frowny face*
