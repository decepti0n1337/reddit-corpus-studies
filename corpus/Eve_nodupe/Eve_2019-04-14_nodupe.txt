Definitely sure. I was one of 3 hics on grid. I couldn't stop a single command Dessie from getting away the whole fight

oh i wish i was :D but seriously what are you shooting at?

As a Caldari I feel offended, but still. Can I bring my Caracal?
---
&gt; if he knows what he did, and he knows its wrong. its not something he'd want going public. so he'd make some small excuse and try to dissapear.
---

---
That's BS though. Do you follow sports?
---
Lance Armstrong, Marion Jones, Ben Johnson, the Russian testing lab in Sochi, BALCO ...... numerous others all of them claimed that there weren't doping or involved in doping but they all were and were doing it for years.
---
Armstrong even too ever took the Sunday Times to court and won a libel action but he had to pay all the money back as he lied in court to win.
---
It was all bullshit, they did exactly what they were claimed to have done and worse but they all publicly denied it over and over and over without letting it drop.
---
Deny everything, admit to nothing and a sizeable section of the population will believe you no matter how much evidence there is against you.
---
Join with a cyno fitted
---
Nah, it works with empire mining response fleets too.
---
Also back in the day with vagas or cynas, one did not simply ramboi a PODLA Drake.
---
Downvoting because I was obviously ordered to
---
You would think that, but even in systems where the prosecutor, judge and jury are NOT the same entity and where some evidence is required to be examined and published plenty of people have ended up on the wrong side of justice. Lack thereof is definately not going to improve the situation.
---
I miss when r/eve would downvote the ever loving shit out these posts
---
they were good at getting tracking titans nerfed
---
Yes that works :)
---
yep, and they will spawn and warp in when somebody attacks you outside one of their stations.
---
CCP is actually incapable of developing new IP into an attractive, marketable product.  Why do they need to be told this at this point?  Why does anyone look at their track record and believe the result will be anything different.
---
  
---
JUST FOCUS IN EVE, HILMAR.
---
INIT saves Nyx, then also kills Nyx. Victory all around!
---
They were good in like 2012. Several missile changes happened that made application and damage choice no longer exist
---
But can I bring my Drake tho?
---
Is this copypasta?
---
Op, you must be a fag to pick on this meme of all of them.
---
Flawed logic, you could easily reason the opposite with the same assumptions  
---
Your assumption is the banned people know why they were banned and that the underlying knowledge is worth anything  
---
Obviously they could transfer that special knowledge (which you are proclaiming they have) to a few dozen or thousand other players as well, gaming the system. So there is nothing to be gained for CCP for keeping the general outline secret, as publicizing the information would be leveling the players field
---
&gt; All their fcs are banned
---
It is now!
---
You could have not cared enough to even read the thread title, much less replied to it.
---
wat?
---
A freighter gets ganked in Juunigaishi that's amazing.
---
Does anyone actually believe the fictional AAR? Spies = scanners on the gates the same as always.
---
Lol at knowing the path and choke points too Juunigaishi is next to Uedama if anyone doesn't know that route and choke point by now they never will do.
---
Of course there's no record of the first wave of 40 dying either or the suicide gankers on the Mach.
---
Just post what actually happened, it's not like it's hard to see when you're making shit up.
---
 **What is "Ganked"?** 📷 Ganked is an old Spectre fleet tradition shared with RvB. It was created to highlight the "event" of the week. This tradition lives on at Spectre. with a few new additions...  - GankedUSTZ - Ganked Junior   
---
 These fleets are FCed by the best, by the most fun and by the downright crazy(Friends next door) 📷 . **You should be on these prime time fleets on Saturdays!**
---
After all NC stands for - Never undoCk
---
He doesn't realize his own overlords sanctioned Brisc's removal
---
:(
---
Okay thanks! Wasn't sure about this.

&gt;Of course there's no record of the first wave of 40 dying either or the suicide gankers on the Mach.

maybe don't be such a dipshit and do some research before you try and call someone out?
---
&gt;INIT wasn't deployed to burn our space already?
---
IMO its not OP if its so easily countered. People say op because its the only subcap that isn't total garbage vs caps.
---
You're doing God's work by killing their fort.tbh I'm suprised they can even organize a fort placement over all the autistic screeching
---
TROLL DESTROYER... ACTIVATE

Fucking new guys. If Eve hasn't taught you to have 2+ accounts for all online services nothing will. Excuse while I swap clients to updoot today's favorites.
---
Most groups fly specific "doctrines" of ships and fittings. These doctrines allow for more effective fleet combat. However, they generally work better if everyone flies the right ships.   
---
Because drakes used to be good and then got nerfed, hardly anyone flies them in fleets anymore. There is a recurring joke to say: "FC, can i bring my drake?". The FC (= Fleet Commander) would say no, face palm and everyone has a laugh.  
---
This joke is very old and has been overdone. This is why OP made this post. He think it's retarded to make this joke. I don't disagree.
---
Sounds like gameplay mechanics :)
---
In an ideal world, the miners would see their buddy getting shot at &amp; call in reinforcements on their own -- "Our buddy Bob was here to watch over us, and then these *heathens* started shooting at him! Take 'em out!"

I guess you made this video. Overall I like the style you are trying to pull, not just some lame zoomed out purple square look. BUT the jittery editing is kind of headache inducing/seizing inducing. Maybe chill on that, it takes away from the fleet.

RE: Exploring
---
Instead of going around spooky space, try to find wormholes that take you to the ass end of null-sec. Thera connections can be a good worst-case fallback.
---
RE: Corp
---
Small corps are cool but big bloc corps tend to just assume everybody is a spai so it's a little smoother. Try joining Pandemic Horde / Goons / TEST / EVE University or something like that. Remember when you join a corp you want to really integrate - get on comms, get into chats, be active. A lot of this game is just the social interaction.
---
Personally I ended up doing a lot of exploration solo for my first few years of my EVE careeer, now I'm in a bloc alliance and enjoy the social aspects. The key is really just finding something you enjoy, and keep doing that.
---
I just handle it like CCP and don't share my proof
---
You've got it wrong.
---
Assume Brisc did something wrong and CCP and he both know what he did.
---
Now assume Brisc claims to have done something else which is minor but a breach of his CSM NDA in order to save face.
---
Now CCP gets to play the "You know that's not what you did" card and assuming whatever Brisc did is worse and would destroy Brisc's professional reputation further can (at their discretion cause they hold all the cards) actually release whatever evidence they have about him.
---
On the other hand, Brisc can just say "Oh this is all baseless, I don't know what I did and I want CCP to tell me what I did" which plays off his CSM NDA breaking as "Its a baseless accusation" (which tend to happen all the time). Then Brisc disappears from Eve into the sunset and lets the controversy pass.
---
If memory serves at some point they were a good, cheap choice for low-to-moderate SP to players due to the ability to fit a good tank and decent DPS and range but I too have been in and out of the game for the last 10 years.
---
 I've killed hundreds of capital spawns both in normal belts and anomalies the anomaly capitals never warped off outside the anomaly they spawned in however if the anomaly trigger completion battleship was killed they would despawn with the site.
---
 Normal belt and moon belts fall under this system too will spawn caps once alot of rats in the belts have been killed they are also oddly enough atracted to activity in a belt since the system won't generate a spawn to a belt unless someone warps to that belt but if you already there mining the dice rolls constantly and it goes from shit spawn higher and higher until a special spawn is due
---
Been threatening us with hot drops all week, decided to give them content finally.

 It'll prob be 3 3 4 slow layout which isn't terrible but not amazing either

---
What just happen to Brics is the reason why CCP removed that rule that you had to give out your real name. But Brics decided to be a ~~smartass~~ idiot and plastered his face and his name on his campaign.
---
You obviously don't understand NDAs. They do not want the info out there, so you want them to release the information. You are an idiot.
---
A dozen ships in 2019's 'Age of the Titan' is considered eating shit, I'd be curious to see what an actual shit eating feed looks like.

If you are interested in exploring give signal cartel a try.  That's what they do.
---
Lmao doesn’t even mention LowSec.
---
lol is it
---
that's one way of calling feeding uncontrolably to skillu
---
Clearly we just need to buff caps.
---
Not feeding hard enough?
---
Fort won’t fit in a DST, and to make it fit in an orca you you kill an hope of tanking an attack
---
Def shoulda bought logi with them though
---
Sounded real till "fake news".
---
The reason people have this fear is because a lot of people for some reason think Brisc is innocent.
---
They're still decent, they can passive tank like a mofo and still have ok damage application. Just dont use heavies, HAMs work well.
---
For me soon as you use fake news your arguement is moot
---
Nice meme bro
---
lmao shut up dickmouth
---
hope some transparency comes out.
---
unironic use of "fake news" meme
---
You are speaking that CCP has evidence as fact.  How do you know this?
---
fake news right here folks
---
SAD!
---
Also, nobody needs to smear your crappy alliance you have a 64% KB efficiency.
---
lol nah.
---
Cringe
---
Imagine being tryhard enough to post an \~\~\~\~\~official response\^xD and think it does anything but make you look dumber than brisc lmao
---
What is wrong with you?

nobody cares

tell brisc to return to his previous irrelevancy with grace

everyone

Also beware of the stations that have a 30% refine O.O

I just show up with a Drake Navy so that they cant bitch too hard.

you going back to odin?

Still hear jokes about drakes - but people sneak in Ferox's for real now.

They are great, cost effective ships, but they are not good in all fleets.

Oh shit. The good guys win again!

who the hell is CCP Dopamine?

Just read it in a sister bliss voice in your head instead of a Donald trump voice, i mean bliss still says portal through instead of bridge.
---
Was this announced anywhere?   Kind of a cunty thing to do, adding an expiration date on something with already limited availability.
---
&gt;Separately, you will also find numerous examples of fake news, fabricated logs and enemy propaganda designed to undermine our reputation and sow doubt in the community about our integrity - I expect nothing less from our adversaries whose only recourse over the last decade to try and damage us has been through smear campaigns and dirty tricks. This is nothing new, has never hurt us and never will.
---
Why does INIT care so much about their image, to go out of their way to be mega cringe lords
---
are you eluding to fake news? and if so then by your own words is your above statement also moot?  **.\^.**
---
no ill let you have that honor since they're closer to ya.
---
also that excuse can be used for literally every non-limited ship in the game.
---
Fuck off and die
---
Sorry you lost all your shitty B-tier FC's.
---
Well FC can I?
---
they fall into the problem of \*there is something better to use\* for whatever it's being used for. since they don't get an application bonus and no damage bonus to rapid lights while being kinetic locked almost any dps type of battlecruiser will fill it's roll better.  
---
It still has a place in the game as an entosis brick or passive shield c2 runner. This is not to say you can't have success with it, only that it limits itself pretty heavily in what it can apply damage to.
---
Who are you gong to copy now?
---
lol.
---
I love this game
---
For me it's as soon as you realise this isn't surprising behavior from CSM nor eve players...they guilty
---
^(ingame)
---
WoW is better than eve
---
Nobody ever copied your coward fleets. Why would we want a 64% kill efficiency on our elite pvp alliance lmao.

Man all the NC dotte posters coming out of the woodwork to shame init :thinking:

Lol ok :)

Sad behavior from the leader of INIT!
---
Lol ok go back to hiding in npc stations instead of hiding behind goon's supercap umbrella. 
---
You didn't invent anything, you just tried to figure out the best way to make comps other people made more cowardly by adding booshers to everything. I don't blame you though, your KB efficiency is fucking garbage. If I cared about my image SO MUCH to post a thread like this, I would probably do the same.
---
Why do people think random dudes in the community team did this as they would deal with banning RMTers or something? CCP most likely brought in their team of lawyers went through this case and made the call. Them claiming that Brian (not Brisc Rubal) breaking this NDA is bigger than anyone breaking in-game rules and getting banned for it. 
---
I understand it's fun to get up-in-arms in situations like these, but I don't think this is a situation where CCP acted irrationally as people believe. If they did, there would be bigger repercussions than some nerds REEing on reddit about how they're innocent like every "innocent" person who got banned has done.
---
Just my two cents.
---
inb4 Bliss gets temp banned too
---
Preemptive upvote from this cat... transparency is rarely a bad thing.
---
&gt;aye, but it didn't have the same real life impact as it did now.
---
Because Brisc openly tethered his online persona to his RL one as well. Why the fuck are people shocked that he's facing potential RL repercussions as a result?
---
EVE Online and Project Nova Community Developer. He also wrote the article on Brisc being removed and banned.
---
[Fucking hypocrite, you come here and write this official statement and then you post + delete this LUL.](https://imgur.com/a/YAjaGC1) With that attitude I'm pretty sure you have no problems lying about this either.
---
Kb efficiency insult, Initdot should just fold the alliance now boys, they went there.
---
beep beep i'm a jeep
---
If you want something focused, check out the various newbie mills in null: Brand Newbros in TEST, Brave Newbies Inc in Brave Collective, KarmaFleet or Ascendance in Goonswarm Federation, Pandemic Horde Inc in Pandemic Horde. The upside to them is that you'll get free frigates and will have null-style content fed to you. Most likely, you'll be told to fly a tackle ship, so you'll eventually get decent at flying light tackle or scouting, with maybe some manual piloting thrown in. The downside is that they are megacorps and newbie mills, and theres tons of people that either don't STFU on comms, or they are autistic as fuck. You also only learn the nullsec playstyle, and most ISK making advice can be boiled down to "train for a VNI, spin havens, get more accounts, spin more havens", which is terrible.
---
Now, if you want to learn various aspects of the game from a more formalized "classroom" setting, then your best bet is going to EVE University. They have a rather tedious application process, but I think it's worth it. They have various "campuses" in highsec, lowsec, nulllsec, and wormholes, and you can freely move from one campus to the other without changing corps. The downside is that you have to take initiative and attend the classes offered to find your own niche.
---
Good luck!
---
Oh and PS - don't join Theran Alliance. They claim to be newbie friendly but its just a giant scam, poorly run by a retardo.
---
He's been banned for this message.
---
Might as well report the threat to CCP just for fun to see if they'll do anything VoV
---
Yeah ok buddy
---
you guys really care about videos games, eh?
---
CCP doesn't ban people without evidence. They sometimes ban people for stupid reasons (see stunt, gobbins) but they usually have really solid proof. Don't @me capqu
---
Hey! Don't tell them! :P
---
It all comes down to trust.
---
CCP has stated publicly that Brisc is banned following NDA violation, of which they were informed by fellow CSM members.  Unless said members go public, this seems to be all we're likely to get (CCP doing their famous clam imitation).  CCP is the one with in-game logs, and perhaps other CSM members have communications logs.  Contrariwise, there are allegations of ulterior motives, fake news, and no due diligence.
---
Brisc, many Init members, and official channels have stated their innocence.  These people, more than anyone else, would know; however, these people also have the most to gain by overturning the bans.  Unless someone were to confess (and give credible proof) we have no means of knowing.
---
Other details, like Brisc's realization live on TiS, can be interpreted in various different ways and do not constitute proof (merely suspicion).
---
So it is CCP's word against Brisc and company.  Absent further details, we're stuck with speculation.
---
Targeted hit job at OFOC FC, gets messy - conspirators gloat! Brutus you will get stabbed too one day. Next time OFOC want to burn beyond the E545 - there will be no mercy and no peace. You will be murdered just as much as you did last summer. All you can do is get horny on King Creator and 2 main OFOC FC bans!
---
Sort and KillahFlea did the shit smearing, but are now quiet while their hands are stinking. Ruined someone's real life, because you don`t want to undock your fucking casino faction titans. Enjoy your game!
---
I removed that post, as it's directly against Reddit's TOS.
---
Damn...a real shame to not see you lose for the 6th time in row
---
I'm not the one taking this seriously. I just love to shit on INIT because they get super salty about it.
---
West Fountain 3?
---
That moment when all the salty Panfam shitlords come out to post
---
Proof or it didn't happen.
---
They're the ones who take everything seriously. They pretend they're the best PvP alliance in the game who trailblaze for everyone else. Everyone knows it's fake news but init.
---
INIT leadership really seem to have a hard time following the rules
---
Also, for some reason, a lot of people just blindly take Brisc at his word and never consider that he could actually be lying to them.  Because "he's my friend, he wouldn't lie".  Sniff. Queue tiny violins.
---
His so-called followers, friends..whatever you call them are so damn gullible.
---
As someone who likes to fly Wolfs, why not?  ADC is my "oh shit, I need to gtfo" button for if I need to try to pull range and bail and/or let my SAAR reload.

But I am bad at Eve so I very well could be wrong.
---
So you care about people who care about video games. Jesus, Lame-ception.
---
But the only important part of LS is FW. /s  
---
To be fair though if I was going to try and list everything in EVE that at least one person saw as a problem, I'd just end up describing every aspect of the game.
---
Odin 2 Stronk for Brisc's orphans.

Yeah apparently Lol.

No. Technically they killed 2x supers, apostle, and a bunch of subs.

You are just jealous.

you can logout in structures as well and wont pop out when the structure is done
---
half a decade of failing is a pretty large ask for a record as is :)
---
Grath is playing nice, I dunno what your on about.
---
I don’t know why but init seems to have a really toxic culture, I think people like that give goons a bad name.
---
Unlike ascendence and few other groups whenever they come by Brave space for a fight, it always end up with “Gf”, unlike “bitch pussies, come out fight us” even when we barely have people online lol.
---
I show up in a nighthawk
---
You just ruined his IRL Life. Enjoy your defamation lawsuit.
---
Nice
---
But why would they be salty?
---
Imagine being this much of a twat
---
This event has seriously opened up for me the clear cultural divides within EvE.
---
For an INIT member, reputation is everything. Being able to use your word as your bond, to demand the respect of your peers grounded in years of earning that trust through actions.
---
The you have the flip side, inwhich everyone is out for themselves, alliances of opertunity to serve short term goals that align. More likely to stab each other in the back if the situation presents itself. 
---
Both sides unable to even fathom how the other can even operate, thus unable to see common ground.
---
When you are get wrecked by a small gang in 4 caps. It's called eating shit, you gigantic spod brain.
---
Coming with an official statement isn't that bad, might be a tad tryhard but whatever. Only thing that gets me is the last part, talking about how their enemies try to give them a bad word, as if they're the only target of this.
---
In addition to that, what really makes me laugh or just sad, idk, is one of the responses to a comment in here, you'll see someone linking a screenshot if interested. Yikers.
---
Because the worse your alliance is, the more important PR becomes. Have you seen the utter state of fountain's "intel" channel?
---
You may want to do a search for that phrase - I’ve clicked through about 10 pages worth of search results.
---
&gt; They pretend they're the best PvP alliance
---
Becomes even funnier when you have a look at what they do to their own space's intel channel lmfao
---
Because they goaded Brisc to join the CSM and by the looks ended up putting him in a situation that got him banned.  Which has gotten him a ton of bad press in turn.
---
Can't upvote this enough.
---
Ah, Init is deploying the full Bart Simpson Defence:
---
"I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. There's no way they can prove anything."
---
Same level of credibility as Bart, too.
---
NCDock are twats
---
Init are also twats
---
Is that so hard to grasp
---
It's going to do something forsaken to your hub
---
Brief Rubal may be gone but through SisterBliss the pomposity lives on!
---
Which phrase
---
So you are saying there is stuff out there that shows you all were communicating with Brisc in a way that could be construed as NDA breaking?  Pando mentioned on TiS discord that it was mistakes that shouldnt have been made?
---
The one Bliss used. It’s a common insult.
---
Does their alliance leadership just tell anyone who gets tackled to kill themselves? 
---
Bliss seems to like doing that for some reason.
---
Are we back to having this argument again? Two of the current CSM members were falsely banned (one of which was jin'taan). CCP gets it wrong more than they'll admit.
---
These people are too much, fake news and fabricated logs. I'm sure CCP banned these guys on fake news. Good one bois.
---
If everyone gets unbanned, then it was all a publicity stunt.
---
Despite being a disgusting regular here I'm not quite at the point of actually joining init, but the other day that lot managed to fill fountain's intel with a discussion about rorqual mechanics. I'm sure at the same time, somewhere out there an INIT member was proclaiming their elite skill
---
Personally I can only act on what I see; I don't spend my day opening every single reddit post and reading every single comment specifically seeking out people telling people to die; The report button is there for a reason, if you see someone doing something that's against TOS, report it.
---
Kills pretty much any play for battleships using their own MJD since they cant neut out a bubble to drop scram.
---
If you’re going to ban everybody who uses common insults in here, it’s going to be very quiet.
---
Yea ok, Pal
---
Of course you're not at the point of joining INIT
---
You don't like huffing your own farts.
---
Nah, nothing against them, just rather do my thing.
---
people said the same of wargaming.  then we found out alot of them just really petty.  caused alot of frakas.
---
So I did some research and apparently I'm wrong, I just usually only fly kitey assault frigates. But for more kitey stuff(retris), if someone gets on top of you you're dead anyways so there's no point taking an Adc.
---
He can't moderate all of reddit, if you search r/eve for that exact phrase on the other hand you get 2 results, both of them 4 years old.
---
Your posting is atrocious
---
Sorry he can't respond to you right now he's banned for breaking the rules.
---
Did he tho? Or did he just apologize profusely and get reinstated :)
---
Ban init from posting
---
I'm sorry you like to coddle piles of shit like that guy, I'm not burdened with that failing personality trait.
---
If you choose to say dumb shit that's easily proven false, I'm going to call you on it every time
---
I think it might have been better if you had stayed silent, but i think you have lost more credibility.
---
Anyhow, congrats on the future widot into goons!
---
Ah OK.... There are so many subtle variations, metas, tricks etc in Eve that seem so obvious when you're "in the know" but otherwise might never occur to you.
---
You seem like a really pleasant guy. I hope your life gets better.
---
Why can you not just leave us alone?  Just cop your ban and move on.  Everyone is over you and your bullshit.
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
You can earn respect but not demand respect and the respect that you have earned can dissipate faster than you expect. When 3 of your high profile members manage to get themselves banned in maybe one the biggest scandals in EVE in a numbers years that respect tend to get lost quickly

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7x5xrp/ccp_guard_facts_checks_mittani_about_false/ I'll just refer you back to this
---
Thanks for your comment, I appreciate you taking the time to write it.
---
Shut up and commit no breath (ingame(ohwaityoucant))
---
Not that I really care but at the insult. But don’t you think telling someone to die might break TOS, or at the very least sound just a few times worse than some other generic insult?
---
I'm fairly certain you not only need to live in the same country but also know the persons name to sue them. but sure lets keep believing that's what is going to happen.
---
So you're saying that it can happen then?   Someone banned mistakenly and then later be found to be someone in good standing?
---
Salty for what?
---
active shield casb nyx is something i've never seen before
---
I'm dislike init thoroughly but even I have to admit. KB efficiency meme in 2019? You honestly think your KB tells your story.
---
Lmao. Cringy dude.
---
&gt;innocent until proven guilty, due process.
---
What do these terms mean in this case? Presumably CCP checked whether the accusations were valid before making any bans. With regards to due process, the US bill of rights has precisely zero relevance to CCP in this case. The EULA and terms of service are the documents outlining "due process" in this case, and the TOS literally says "CCP reserves the right to close, temporarily or permanently, any user’s account without advance notice as we deem necessary. Furthermore, we reserve the right to delete all user accounts or inventory of characters as warranted."
---
And we all hopefully never see it again
---
I don't think he knows what being salty is.
---
I'm more saying that the chances of CCP headshotting a CSM member without real evidence is much lower than the examples Kcolor linked, which are basically confirmed goon input broadcasters saying that they got warnings for input broadcasting, which they TOTALLY WEREN'T GUYS (some of them are the ones who there are videos of them lighting 40+ cynos at once on their rorqs), or hearsay about FCs getting reported for doing dumb shit. I once got GM convo'd because I got mass reported for dropping 90 cans on a gate back in my BRAVE days, which apparently is a bannable offense, and as the FC of the fleet I got in trouble.
---
There is a big difference between keeping your word, and trying roleplay with "public relations" posts designed to make yourself "look cool" and make the masses like you.
---
I would say there is a certain bizarre and strange tone to making elaborate propaganda art to go with your serious official statement that is about something outside of the game.
---
It reminds me of that strange Kevin Spacey video, where he was roleplaying as the character Francis Underwood. The whole thing was a response to him getting ostracized due to the kid fiddling accusations.
---
“We know we are right and my people are innocent because they said so. Why would the banned players lie about it?”
---
I cant tell if op is for real or not.
---
I’ve seen that insult so many times, as well as the acronym for it, the Green Day song - hell, there was an guild in SWG that used the acronym. I wouldn’t be surprised if there are EVE corps with it. 
---
I just don’t see the difference - the guy insulted Bliss, he insulted back. Ban both or ban neither.  oath are TOS violations when you get down to it.
---
Is fuck off and die really not allowed
---
 Back in the day drakes? Imagine a spool of fish swimming in unison now replace each fish with a drake
---
hahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
didnt read a word of this shit blog get fucked idiots
---
&gt; Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people; likewise
---
Never had issue with my Hic scram not stopping boosher.   
---
I missed the fight by the way. Was too busy killing SMA in Khanid. We'll make sure to come shoot Shoot First next time!
---
I mean if bliss only wants to use this sub to be an utter twat in response to obvious trolls was anything of value really lost
---
I'm betting on this
---
Imagine coming crying to muh mods over someone getting "lightly modded" because a complete absence of skin means their natural response to "shut up dickwad" (how much more obvious can a troll be lmfao) is "fuck off and die".
---
Nice to see init, the elite PVP alliance, displaying their inner twattishness and thin skin.
---
At the end of the day this seems to be a very strange situation and as much as I'd love to know what happened and what people are accused of doing, I doubt we'll ever get the whole story.   
---
Like most things, the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle.
---
*Grabs popcorn* dis gon be gud
---
You're right, I took that part out of it as it has nothing to do with a public statement.
---
&gt; "fuck off and die"
---
&gt;i *think* you have lost more credibility
---
hmm you know what i'm not entirely sure
---
Needs more photoshop
---
Mostly
---
It really does take the briscuit.
---
Yes we are terribly salty that _your_ leadership got banned for cheating.
---
I don’t think that applies here. This is a common insult. 
---
I do think “Threatens, harasses, or bullies or encourages others to do so” would apply,  it so did the original comment that sparked his response. If one is bad, so is the other.
---
I don't really care, but it drives INIT members super mad.
---
o/
---
true,  CCP can do anything they want.
---
but as players, it does mean we can judge them differently as we havent seen the reason, much less the evidence.  
---
"presumably",  .....i dont have much faith in Devs, not even CCP.  say hi to Jin'taan.
---
You can get banned for dropping cans on gates?? B-b-b-but decloaking?
---
I haven't seen that movie.
---
What a dickmouth
---
I was originally coming to say that this update was an internal update meant for INIT members that was posted proactively because it would pther3ise get leaked immediately, but I saw the interaction between Bliss and the other dude and thought it might help to point out what I pointed out.
---
What on earth would make you think theres anything wrong with my life?
---
:joy:
---
I mean, they've said that in the past that it was an EVE universe spinoff. But they've come pretty far with it already, and though the gameplay was somewhat stale, the base fundamentals are there. Out of all the projects they've had in the past, Nova by far is the most accessible one, especially since you, y'know, don't need to buy any different hardware to play it if you were already an EVE player. Sparc, VR. Valkyrie, VR. Dust 514, PS3.
---
With the direction I imagine they're going, it'll likely take elements from Battlefield or Planetside; I think they didn't intend it to be directly linked to the EVE server until they were ready for something like that to take place.
---
I think the potential is there and its interesting, maybe something like invading a station or structure to either significantly increase its repair time or decrease the reinforce time it has. Something that has a much more direct effect, but obviously in order to have something like that happen, you have to have specific ships board successfully. Just spitballing.
---
They ignored him after because he immediately brought up litigation.
---
shut up dickmouth
---
You know a lot about leaking things immediately, don't you.
---
Whys that?
---
Drakes are bad. Dreks are good.
---
&gt;everyone is out for themselves, alliances of opertunity to serve short term goals that align. More likely to stab each other in the back if the situation presents itself.
---
r u dumb
---
ban eve players from posting imo
---
Remember that this is an angry briscuit and thinking ish hurd
---
Yup.
---
LPT: If you breathe a whisper about a lawsuit, any company that knows what they're doing is going to immediately stop talking to you and refer you to their lawyers.
---
On mobile sadly.
---
You've only been caring for 10 years :-D
---
Nah, INIT line members are pretty cool and down to earth. You probably just got some bad examples, every alliance has those. But it just seems INIT leadership is a bit... “entitled” regarding rules and obligations.
---
I see what you did there. That’s really funny.
---
Dinobrains lives matter
---
This girl did not ask and brought 3. Also she claims she is now the FC! [https://imgur.com/a/6SpZ5O5](https://imgur.com/a/6SpZ5O5)
---
Tbh I kinda miss my days as a hisec newbie. It was a lot more relaxing doing things the slow(er), dumb(er) way.
---
Looks like your once-fellow GSM also saw what you did there. Pity for you that they didn't see the joke, right?
---
I used Ms Paint.
---
After hundreds of kills, the revenant finally fell in glorious combat. F to pay respects.

That's not what my post says at all.

Looks can be deceiving.

F ... was it really solo-yolo'ing?

I think you meant Brescuit

I agree, that's why I'm yet to believe this wonderful official statement from someone with a higher sodium content than I thought possible or the claims from a banned lobbyist.

Leaves super umbrella, dies immediately in CDFE coward fit. Strong plays!

atleast we get to use the faction supers people have
---
Drakes were once so good (2010-2012) that they broke the meta and then literally broke the game.  Then it shifted to the Tengu, and then Heavy Missiles got so nerfed they never found their way out of the dumpster.  
---
They also won an Alliance Tournament two years ago.
---
makes and salt post about INIT members being banned, then proceeds to get banned from their own post.   
---
Good fucking effort.
---
Lmfao HE ACTUALLY **DID IT** the absolute **MADMAN**
---
Finally dropped outside of Esoteria
---
Good on you /u/dagon_gaebal
---
The rules are applied very consistently when it pertains to telling someone to kill themselves.
---
It was a great fucking effort you're spot on!
---
LOL look at his killboard... He's not fragging carriers or anything. The only capital kills have tons of others on the km. Stop acting like he was doing elite PvP or something. 
---
Any dinobrain can kill a Fed Navy Comet with an officer fit Revenant.
---
I agree, make this a dev-only subreddit
---
lol &lt;3 u too man

you owe me a drink lmao

Nothing of value was lost.

I know you get mad each time I passed you up with rev kills during the week ))
---
Now I have no competition ((
---
They do if they’re interesting in some way. This is just a carrier kill not much to post about.
---
Only a crybaby would post this kind of thin-skinned response
---
oh i did lol, but hey good hunting
---
So what all do you drop your Revenant on?
---
Looks cool and I think I see my little Vigil in there.  That was only the third fleet I have been on and had a great time.  Thanks for FC'ing the fleet Redline, hope to fly with you again. Thanks Spectra Fleet for hosting public fleets and letting new players join.
---
Drakes themselves are... ok-ish as a hull. Slot layout is fine, fitting isn't a significant problem, nice and tanky, pretty slow but what else do you expect from caldari, and kinetic lock does suck but at least the damage bonus is decent in size. The real problem is that missiles in general have issues, both mechanically and in the meta, and heavy missiles in particular are pretty trash. Basically they suffer from having a bad weapon and being an inferior choice to several other BCs in the current meta.
---
It's the only way I can study the unexplained anomaly that is that autist's sodium content.
---
I’ll get you a drink if we ever meet in person )
---
You mean dropping on cruisers roaming your home region isn't elite? Wtf I've been lied to.
---
How are you actually so stupid that you're still trying to jump in front of a moving train.
---
Even the way you talk now is incredibly transparent. Take the advice you'd give to anyone under your council. Shut the fuck up lmao.
---
Sharks seem like INIT is week blood in the warter.
---
I like Brisc, he's from home, and we get along well, Ive never had a bad conversation with the man.
---
However, at this point I feel like you guys are pushing a rock up a hill and the result is really predictable, and heres the why:
---
Remember that one time that CCP banned somebody for an NDA violation and it turned out to be a false accusation?
---
Yea nobody else does either.
---
That presents a serious credibility problem for the Init side.
---
Also lol Bliss, 10 years later still posting really cringe worthy shit in defense of his members...you're not helping now, and none of the times you've done dumb shit like this in the past has helped either.
---
Lol your reputation
---
Not really, but can you not see the hypocrisy in what you have just written?
---
Was a great fleet. Thanks for hosting.
---
In which an utterly irrelevant highsec carebear thinks anybody cares about him no longer running for the CSM due his blatantly wrong beliefs about what happened to the fat retard.
---
Thanks!
---
whats the final killmark count on that beast?
---
Is that really what that insult means? I have never considered that to be the meaning.
---
If he was hotrodding his Rev and killing ratting carriers then I'd say he deserves it. Look at the solo sheet on his KB. Largest hull is a BC. Except the solo carrier AWOX rofl. Take your whataboutism back to t2trimarks.
---
Because that's how this sort of a communication works.  Just like writing a bio.  It usually feels weird as fuck to write them as well.
---
Rip the menliest Rev in EVE.
---
Daegon's exploits are the most batshit crazy thing I've ever seen, and corp discord always got a kick out of his latest frags. It's the kind of player that EVE needs more of, who's willing to risk it for the biscuit. We're certainly going to be helping him out on his way to a new Rev.
---
So what all do you drop your Rev on?
---
I’m talking about something completely unrelated. I wouldn’t advise a client to stop talking to people about unrelated subject matter.
---
I guess now that we know CCP cares about leaks Goons suddenly don’t want to be on the GSM as much 🤔
---
One word. Awox.
---
I’ve been that guy for 12 fucking years. I love my drakes. I will never not be that guy.
---
You're right, precedence is not on our side. That doesn't mean we can't appeal for a fair review for those impacted. I'd hope it would be the same for any entity, regardless of political (in-game) affiliation.
---
My god, the amount of material here is just...
---
But I don't want you to tell me to kms so how I'll just say again
---
&gt;a complete absence of skin means their natural response to "shut up dickwad" (how much more obvious can a troll be lmfao) is "fuck off and die"
---
You God Damn Legend!  
---
What penifsmash is to you, you are to others.  
---
Some people never get to have the fun you had, ever. You flew it well.  
---
F, gf
---
I'm sorry but from literally everything you've said in this thread you're in no position to pull the hypocrisy card bb &lt;3
---
are you jelous¿
---
Your advice is always valuable and much appreciated
---
Yeah that's not how any competent company should handle an investigation like this.  No sense topping their hand in the event Brian brings a lawsuit since his game persona was so closely tied to his RL persona.
---
His balls havent even dropped yet, much less a Rev.
---
You're calling someone out for being a twat to a troll? Are you for real?
---
Good on ya for having the courage to fly that spiky turd into the fray instead of having it as a hangar trophy.
---
Glad you had a ton of fun with it.
---
315
---
There's a point where it causes lag (apparently), in the same vein as putting 100 bubbles on 1 gate. It's when you drop like 100+ cans, not just a few to decloak people warping in.
---
Come on.  99% of the kills were full tank fit under the eso or catch super umbrella.  Don't act like its anything different to someone dropping their non-faction super under any super umbrella with backup a ping away.
---
Those terms sound good, and if only we can make enough fuss...
---
I think he is :)
---
"oh no there is a troll in my shitty post, whatever will i do... i know, let's display our abnormally high sodium content!"
---
You're providing a very compelling argument for "totally innocent" here.
---
Wow, I may not like test but damn that's amazing, gg
---
I think you need to check your calibration
---
There is no Catch super umbrella, we've only had supers in U-Q for a couple weeks out of the last 9 months or so.
---
Just remember all the times cheaters protested innocence and later got publicly burned at the stake when the truth finally came out.
---
The ONLY person Ive ever seen CCP vindictively go after in the manner being suggested is Kugu.
---
If you're really worried about Inits reputation, publicly going after the company like this after Brisc brought up possible litigation is probably not the best approach.
---
Its really weird that somebody like me is explaining this part to somebody like you btw.
---
When i got evicted the last time, i undocked about 20 iteron mark v  and a stratios and astero filled with a few hundred billon isk. Tethered, and safe logged while tethered. They sat there and watched everything they worked for just safe log. 
---
I stayed logged off for about a month, then logged the astero in every couple days and scanned the hole for a direct high sec, non island connection. Took 3 months. When i finally found one, i evaced everything to high sec and never went back to w space. Took 5 evictions, but that was my limit.
---
stop burn your brain bro. no one said about 'elite pvp'.
---
Fuzzy Steve has [SDE conversions](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/) available for download, including CSV. EVE University [has an index page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Static_Data_Export) as well for all the CSVs, including some comments on them. You can probably load these into some spreadsheets, if you like.
---
Oh, look, instead of making an argument or reacting to mine the Dinobrain in the wild repeats the same question. How cute!
---
So, on talking in stations, when you heard pando was banned you said it's starting to make sense.
---
Yoi gonna elaborate on that or did you say that purely through mistake and it doesn't make sense?
---
Ccp also said they removed the isk and items. Have you asked them what was removed? Why not share that information with us as well. If you want the public to care about three people, maybe you should do more than stamp your foot and say I'm innocent.
---
I almost decided not to respond to your post but the I realized about how great this is!  We are finally on reddit boys!  Let me point out a few things for you though.
---
1.  Only a moron would keep bpo's in a wormhole
---
2.  You can't spell Component 
---
3.  Our camping of the static has led to enough emergent game play that you decided reddit was your only way out.  
---
4.  Your really salty over a vni loss
---
You never answered the question.
---
get another one? So you can lose it going after another VNI?? smfh
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
He's sitting in the Rubal of his CSM career now
---
i'll give credit where credit is due, good fight o7
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/94860305/ Is the most manliest Rev in eve, not this testicle
---
&gt; say that purely through mistake and it doesn't make sense?
---
Or said purely through mistake (but it does make sense)
---
Keep on inspiring my man!
---
No, this is a battle Venture fleet.
---
Because it didn't need to be answered. I don't own a Revenant. If I wanted to contribute to the super meta I would instead have Nyxes that I'd actually drop on real targets. But keep thinking that frigate kill marks on a faction supercarrier is impressive.
---
I feel sorry for you, clearly your work as a lawyer has left you unable to communicate in such a fashion as the average human.
---
the owner already did a thread about it
---
Great attitude.
---
I'm not going after CCP at all, in fact quite the opposite. We've asked our members to avoid any clashes with CCP or the community team while we work this through with them, which is all I'm referring to.
---
I had supercapitals in TEST when they weren't trailing on tail of Goondor and you weren't super safe. This is not impressive to me rofl.
---
damn that's a lotta kills
---
both pilots just doing stupid.stop calling it a war
---
CCP was not spying on the CSM.  They were just secretly watching them without their knowledge.
---
Interesting, honestly never heard of him lol
---
nah bro daegon is a fuckin    'G
---
other pilot was some rich idiot who went afk twice and got rekt by a small handful of chinese dino dreads
---
&gt; catch super umbrella
---
  Que?
---
That's right, you heard it here folks, kills below a certain value don't count and actually might be a bad thing. You should not attack smaller ships with your super, you should let them go, or dock up and reship into something that will give a fairer fight.
---
If it made sense, obviously brisc would take it on the chin as a man.
---
I'm still learning sarcasm..... Obviously :D
---
the good no english yes good
---
Samara more like samarted boi
---
Yea, its weird you think they're going to read this, or briscs thing and think its not "clashing" with the company.
---
You're basically going to a public forum and calling them a liar, and regardless of you believing thats what you're doing, I'm willing to bet money thats how they perceive this.
---
Personally I'd have handled this one silently, and brought the trumpets out if they clear Brisc for some reason. As somebody who likes Brisc its rough, as i doubt they'll reverse course, but if theres any chance of it at all, its in private, not on Reddit.
---
Probably do the guy a favor and just outright delete this whole thread.
---
Why yes, I, too, am fucking retard(ed)
---
Then I say do it.
---
Is that because you can Nyx's with bots but not Rev BPCs?
---
Is goonswarm involved in the war?
---
&gt; I don't own a Revenant. 
---
So basically you have zero credibility regarding what is or isn't a good thing to drop a Revenant on.
---
Personally, I don't tend to judge people who have more kills then most people have on fleet doctrine ships with a ship that is worth more then  most people have in total assets.
---
&gt; I would instead have Nyxes that I'd actually drop on real targets. 
---
You would, but you don't. So like, maybe don't pretend that you know shit about it.
---
you dropped your rev on my dramiel
---
gj i guess
---
RIP vni butcher
---
Pay no attention to the naysayers
---
i did drop it on everything that moved lol
---
naysayers be naysayers, but thank you once again sir o7
---
How did you get caught? AAR please.
---
and the club grows
---
Ov is honestly probably one of the best places to rat now. It very out of the way for enemies, but only one jump from staging for allies
---
a trap was laid, and i bit the bait
---
I like how the frat guy who lost 2 revs proceeded to be the ragnarok on the killmail with top damage. How appropriate.
---
that i thought was hilarious
---
This is what happens when you krab during an alliance fleet.
---
No its debanned, say it like a true intellectual
---
Maybe you shouldn't assume that I've never used a super in this capacity. I at least am talking about evidence that you can clearly see on zkb++++
---
Drake’s are also a common newbie’s ship first choice when they first foray into  hi sec missions. So when they decide to join a null bloc they notice they have drake skills and there you have it.
---
Range was not the problem: regular caps could have jumped to save him. On the other hand, those caps couldn't jump to a cyno that was not there. His cyno alt had been dead for a few mins and he did not have a cyno fit.
---
Thanks for falling for the b8m8
---
Underrated  comment.
---
I haven't used mine that much since last summer for a variety of reasons. The recent patch changes really boned the ship so it's not really worth using it anymore.  If you had to lose it, you unironically picked a good time to do so.
---
Or you could write it like a normal person and not roleplay politics?
---
I hope the VNI pilot gets the loot
---
Why are you feeding pandas right at the moment when they are waiting for lunch?
---
Instructions unclear, undocked drecavac.
---
i don't get it, what bad about drakes? (i been away from eve for a while sorry D: )
---
cause content
---
Judging by the fact that galmil basically left factional warfare entirely it would not surprise me.
---
I'd be more impressed with a 1v1 frigate km than any super vs subcap solo kill mail. If you can't realize that it takes no effort to win against a frigate in a supercapital then you're beyond saving.
---
dropping it on every single roaming gang + bonus camping the WH static. get fucked tapi autist ( in game )
---
*notices post*...... *grabs bleach... ingests*
---
I also compare flying a 23 bil Nyx to flying a fucking officer fit Revenant.
---
Actually, nobody does that.
---
does anybody know if there is, or planes to be any other books similiar to the "frigates of eve online" book? 
---
i like the book but i the bigger ships more...like the rokh or the omen
---
So, in a very even numbers fight. Is Init still elite?
---
TBC  goon line members dont know
---
What do you mean?
---
Oh, was there a Condor burning off the star?
---
Praise James!
---
nah, just a lonely vni ratting
---
just pod yourself irl then
---
xD at least you have more fun with comments than your alliance mates in the other thread.
---
Down with the elitist capital owners
---
She was like the Millenium Falcon. At first the Revenant literally looked like a pile of shit, but the more I saw it out in space killing stuff, the shinier that beautiful turd got.
---
you know it's super weird i thought i would not be able to do this but i'm glad it went out the way it did
---
Again, you assume that's what I flew. It's okay kid. I get it. Thinking isn't your forte.
---
LOL
---
Judging by the fact that the last alliance in Galmil, my alliance, is actively rooting them on, it would not surprise me either. 200m VNIs or bust baby.
---
that's maybe the worst answer I've ever seen on reddit.
---
I feel like the problem with CCP's attempts to make a coherent spin off is that the potential is *always* there, but CCP truly struggles to realize it. 
---
I mean, consider for a moment that Dust was originally announced almost exactly a decade ago; it launches in 2013, gets shut down 3 years later. Now we're on Project Nova, which failed to meet expectations so badly CCP feels the need to pull the whole thing and redo it all from (presumably) scratch after roughly 3 years in the oven. I think there's something wrong here.
---
To be perfectly honest, I think the major stumbling block for CCP is the "‘One Universe // One War’" mantra they want to stick with. I can understand connecting the spin off to EVE, but I think they keep hamstringing themselves with such a high vision. In a lot of ways, I think they would be better served trying to utilize the lore, and the underlying systems of EVE and develop something that isn't directly connected to EVE in the way you're describing. It can get there eventually, but I don't think they'll be able to grow the universe by essentially having players sit in a lobby waiting for their parent corporation to find a station to send them to board-- one that might not even have players on the other side to fight.
---
&gt;I would instead have Nyxes
---
That's what you said, right after you implied you didn't have a super.
---
So like. What do/did you drop on what?
---
Why not just let it be leaked? Then it wouldn't come across to the moderately objective viewer as a declaration of war against CCP.
---
Bait post.. nice try Joshua
---
Don't mine in a venture, huff gas. That little thing can make hundred**s** per hour.
---
TL:DR we will continue to make bad decisions.
---
Na not really. If it’s legit then fuck them and I agree they deserve it. But I also believe in innocent till proven guilty. Just my philosophy and no number of downvoted will change that :)

IM aren't renters, you're thinking of Init Associates.
---
What changed to make that ship bad?
---
Dust had a hardware limitation, though, much like Sparc and Valkyrie, and worse yet, that hardware had a shelf life. I think CCP understands that Dust wasn't well implemented in terms of "one universe", which is why they said Nova would start as independent of TQ, then be implemented later depending on how Nova did. They don't have to rebuild Nova; the initial engine and all the building blocks are fine. It has the base core of what a shooter generally is seen is nowadays. I said this elsewhere, but CCP's projects weren't badly executed, they were just limited in scope and demographic.
---
no more GSM
---
The only people that cares about Inits credibility is Init. Everyone else knows you're a bunch of mouth breathers.
---
So relax. Nothing of value is lost.
---
It's not bad. It's now just very ordinary and way easier to kill. Not worth the 130b isk price tag or whatever it goes for now.
---
Just wait till the monthly FIX MARAUDERS good idea fairies start posting...
---
Not gonna lie, this seems like some really dumb grandstanding thing where you're citing something that was another players fault, that hasn't happened in the 16 years this games been around, and will probably never happen again (unless, you know, it's earned by the person breaking the rules). Seems like a pretty poorly thought out reasoning, but it's your life, do what you want.

i wish this worked with pirate anom sites, if you're friendly when warping into a sansha or gurista haven the rats wont shoot you. too many tackle on easy kills lost because the rats will almost always switch agro to the new ship warping in.
---
Yeah, you here stories about psychopaths in Eve for the same reason you here news stories about murders/deaths irl; they’re interesting. 
---
No one really cares if me and some guy I met while roaming team up a few times and roam together. But if I were to, say, make some friends and then steal 300 bil in AT frigs from them, now that’s an interesting story.

---
And those people don't understand that folks that work in Washington DC have a different moral compass than the rest of us. I think that Brisc truly believes he did nothing wrong, as leaks are a rather common occurrence in his profession.
---
I mean I think he did it too, but CCP has given us fuck-all for proof, or even a hint at what the proof could be, so I don't entirely blame them. Not that they really CAN give us any information if there's a possibility of litigation, but I can still see why they would give someone they're close with the benefit of the doubt.
---
On corps. No decent Corp will not require you to have discord/voice comms, whether it’s with teamspeak or mumble. And while joining a smaller one can be nice, I recommend starting with a big one like Brave/Pandemic Horde, and then once you know what you’re doing then look around for different corps to join. If you like the nullsec life, stay there, but definitely don’t get locked into it. But those big nullsec corps are the best way to learn the basics
---
TL;DR: newbros ratting with caps during beta op which is forbidden. few people tried to help the newbros, things went south.
---
Do you know when he was banned, because that article gave SIGNIFICANTLY more information than we currently have about the Brisc debacle. Makes me wonder if there actually is a chance they'll release more details, or if the litigation shit has made them quiet to the public about it all from now on.
---
I thought a requirement for running for CSM was disclosing your real name.
---
Redemption story of the year right there.

There's often at least one window licker in main fleet that thinks it's funny to go "hur hur FC can I bring my Drake?"
---
Oh fuck no they didn't. No half-competent lawyer would greenlight the statement they made. That shit is _absurd_.
---
Because INIT doesn't hide its PVE activities behind another separate alliance like others in this thread are so keen on doing because of KB efficiency that no one really cares about
---
So if you want that win, you got it big boy. Sounds like you need it. #wearethe64%
---
sorry we watched u. when we see the id  appear in local.we all know that the story is beginning.the first,we have a  bait vni in space.then the heavy interdiction and sarbe is ready in the next system.trues be told we never expect he will droped.then the plan B is freighter is ready.wtf dropped dropped dropped.cyno up .the end.
---
One way to end afk VNI ratting
---
Also looks like a turd lmao
---
I mean I think everyone can agree that Lowsec has a distinct lack of content and that the game could do with a restructuring of content in general, like maybe moving some PvE stuff to Lowsec and maybe some PvP stuff.
---
But yeah, other than that opinions on every aspect of the game widely vary ofc.

Glad I could provide :)

That's a perfect example of a comment I don't feel the slightest bit guilty downvoteing. That would prob get downvoted no matter who wrote it.

oh...ok.....? i usually bring a rokh :) more fun then drake, drake for solo play

Nice troll, but I’m not even at the level of using faction frigate so I’ll take a deeper look later for pirate ships &gt;.&lt;

How much did you have to grovel to the admins?
---
Could be.... I haven't been paying that close of attention but it just seems like an odd thing to do to me.
---
... by him. They banned a player in their videogame for breaking a NDA. Kind of his own fault he tied his in game persona to who he really is.
---
They changed it, you only need to disclose your name to CCP now, not the public at large.
---
HAHAHA ok mate, you have 2 alt alliances. We do all our ratting in house. You do most of yours out of alliance. Also you're not exactly fucking pro if your efficiency is massively dropped because you can't rat without being killed. It's almost as if you're shit at pvp so have no idea how not to protect yourself from actual pvpers.
---
Oh man. I knew this day was coming, but damn.
---
RIP
---
I mean while I was hotdropping in a super it was rorquals
---
Absolute state of INIT lmao
---
wtf you mean they aren't elite for dropping supers on frigs it's not like they won't shot frigs :joy:
---
Shitting on init isn't trolling. A leader of an alliance who prides himself on taking his role seriously telling someone to kill themselves it hypocritical at best. 
---
The mask slipped. You know you're kidding yourself with this shit. Nobody but you takes you seriously, and everyone knows you're full of shit.
---
So did you drop with more then one super and alpha rorqs, or did you hang out on grid through the panic cycle?
---
Would you hang out on that same grid in a Revenant, and if you did, would you be surprised when you got tackled and died?
---
Shiny and chrome
---
Keep huffing those farts. The fact your alliance has been caught breaking it's word, and the reputation of your alliance leader just went way down with his pathetic posting.
---
under big big super umbrella yes
---
Resting on your laurels I see... DJ khaled would be ashamed
---
pls link ur rev kb
---
the fuck u smoking , i didn't say i had a revenant at all, i just said that the guy mostly dropped under a super umbrella.
---
43 words is a long post?
---
You must be from public schools.
---
HEY! Why have you schmucks not sponsored this kill mail yet? Get to it.
---
big bong rips I've been hitting it under this umbrella solo but if you want I will share.
---
It depends on the site that you do and in which class wormhole. An active tanked Tengu would work up to maybe a C3 or C2? I know that you need a constant 1000dps tank for certain waves. I'd reccommend a passive rattle with MWD and Data refit.
---
Not matter how much you polish a turd, it’s still a turd.
---
Then you're not considering the public implications of your clients actions in the community where the "alleged" actions originated.
---
I guess the fact that is foreign to you explains how you got here.
---
But do you have supercapitals in FRT now that YOU aren't super safe?
---
One year? That's really a long time, much longer than the two which belong to the titan pilot who showed on your km.
---
Can confirm it was screwed 8 hours ago as well.
---
Man, reading through this thread, who hurt you? Was it Sappo? Did the mean subaru man hurt you?
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30004923/201709191500/
---
Yea I would hang out on grid it's not a issue and no I wouldn't be surprised but dropping on vnis is a spodbrain meme. We only targeted caps moved those there to hunt a nyx and t1 gun erebus but randomly dropped blops on that and it let cyno soo.
---
I honestly thought I wasnt going to make it a year, poetic in a sense that he ended up on my killmail, thanks friend :)
---
Hello, the condescending tone of your comment makes you sound very snotty, so please stop.  
---
This is a bot
---
It's really good to know that you still have a not bad mood. It's a game, so having fun is more important than anything. :)
---
May you have good luck next time.
---
Good job supplying your enemies with a new nyx worth of loot, you should get another one so you can feed more
---
to be fair it wasn't a totally unexpected change - the accelerators for SP have expiry dates, and those boosters were pretty powerful.
---
a lot were surprised they didn't come with an expiry attached to begin with. retroactively adding one is a bit of a dick move, mind you.
---
I remember making my way down to 08 passing you on the way after you dropped on someone..... o7 ride eternal rev, shiny and chrome
---
What made them stronger? Like just a raw buff at some point to hp or anchor time?
---
[I remember when](https://zkillboard.com/kill/42937202/)
---
Should have said 19% just to mess with him lol
---
How dare he say Hi back, this shows clear favoritism! :riot:
---
Shit was a little different in 2017.
---
Also, you're not going to get the same response from KWG that you are with FRT, are you?
---
Also, that's a great kill and everything, but that's like, one kill. I didn't scroll back too far, but you clearly weren't dropping on shit almost every day.
---
I'm just saying that it's easy to sit here and say daegon should have been dropping on what we think he should be dropping on, but the fact is, very few people in game try to do what he did as frequently as he did.
---
Ain't that the truth! All my best Eve stories are boring af to anyone except me and whoever flew into the shit with me. Lots of "oh, you had to be there" scenarios.
---
Counterpoint: https://youtu.be/dp0-I7P2uyU
---
I abused the shit out of the Christmas boosters/accelerators we got this year.... Transfered a bunch of SP around from different alts because of the initially stated expiration date.   
---
Stuff like this really fucks over casual/seasonal players.    Coming back to Eve after a break to find that some of your shit is now worthless, or that boosters you'd planned to use to grind faction etc are now expired, pretty disappointing.
---
Pod yourself in game
---
Lmao imagine believing this thrash. Did the alliance commissars break your brain?
---
How do you photoshop 780m isk of compressed azure plagioclase into the back seat.

This post is an official statement on behalf of The Initiative [INIT.] to categorically deny any wrongdoing on the part of our pilots Brisc Rubal, Dark Shines and Pandoralica (‘the accused’) and refute the allegations made against them in the dev-blog posted by CCP Dopamine on 8th April 2019.
---
Brisc Rubal has already issued his own statement wherein he has confirmed that he has not broken any terms of the NDA and is seeking recourse to clear his name and reputation. In addition, having spoken to Dark Shines and Pandoralica, I can confirm to the best of my knowledge that neither has been in receipt of confidential information nor undertaken any dialogue with Brisc Rubal or otherwise which has thereafter been used to conduct illicit in-game transactions.
---
Although the dev-blog cites “transparency”, there have been no details of the accusations and alleged transgressions communicated to any of the above parties by CCP or members of the CCP community team despite formal requests to do so.
---
We have however, been reviewing all of the information presented in the dev blog and trying to work backwards to determine what, if anything, may have prompted these bans. In recent days we have been successful in opening up dialogue with CCP to review and appeal against the bans. These efforts are currently in-progress, and we will keep you abreast of any developments as they occur and that we are able to share publicly.
---
We are optimistic that together with the CCP community team we will be able to resolve this matter in a professional manner and have our pilots bans overturned and their reputation restored. My sense is that this incident is a grievous mistake and error of judgement and am hopeful that once resolved, all parties can put this behind them with no residual acrimony.
---
Separately, you will also find numerous examples of fake news, fabricated logs and enemy propaganda designed to undermine our reputation and sow doubt in the community about out integrity - I expect nothing less from our adversaries whose only recourse over the last decade to try and damage us has been through smear campaigns and dirty tricks. This is nothing new, has never hurt us and never will.

the first **T H E R A B O I S**  is so epic.  excited to see vol 2.
---
Lol for that I'm going to help someone else get elected and in the campaign video just going to shout my name at the start for no reason and do nothing else the whole time
---
Bots of a feather stick together I guess. Hahaha
---
I agree thought KWG are more then capable number wise to kill two supers. I've seen them undock enough dreads for our blops alone to do so.
---
Frat is generally more capable as well but it wouldn't bother me to drop in their space. I wasn't dropping everyday there really is no reason to drop supers on subcaps like that.
---
If co2 didn't die right after that we would of stayed for more as well. Gotta get those firesales. Depends on what you mean by tryto do what he did.  Do you mean drop on subcaps all day in general or drop on vnis lmao. 
---
I wouldn't even drop my blops on vnis because there's no point in dropping 4bil blops on a 60mil vni let alone a 140bil super. I hope he had fun but he picked the worst targets for his ship by miles.
---
Nice bait
---
INIT thinks getting beat is the same as winning
---
This always happens as we get closer to AUTZ prime.
---
Wear is the fun in that. This way people can make comments about my mental health without ever meeting me :P more fun for all.
---
This guy gets it. If a lawyer or PR reviewed it would have read "brisc is stepping down from CSM and we thank him for his service." And went on their way everything else was not appropriate or professional regardless if he was guilty or not
---
I was there. Amazing fight and spectacular video!

---
editing was pretty slick :ok_hand:
---
Imagine being so full of yourself you think you this post was needed.
---
&gt;  You do most of yours out of alliance.
---
Uh I'm sure you know the purpose of IA and IM (given your apparent raging hate boner for all things Bliss and INIT) so no, but that's some nice spin. I admit I do somewhat envy having /r/eve basically be your filter and propaganda tool.
---
&gt; you're shit at pvp
---
😂 Is this what you say to yourselves when you drop caps on our frigate fleets? That's NCPL's definition of elite pvp, sure. Give yourself a hug and a pat, pumpkin.
---
So you spend your time looking for footage unrelated to Eve and then try to come up with a title to create a spurious Eve context to it. Whatever floats your boat I guess...
---
you act very much like CCP hasn't banned people in the past for unjust causes or baseless rumors.

---
They do far less dps and don't cost all that much less so you can make your isk back faster with a fit like this.
---
It's from an NDA. Maybe the proof is stuff, i don't know, maybe I'm crazy, it's stuff they don't want disclosed. That's why it was in an NDA. They don't owe us any proof. If he wants proof, he can sue them and their lawyers can go through discovery and all legal stuff. It would probably still be subject to NDA though.

---
I'm like 99% positive its snuff and rdraw alts who are gunna try to make bank off the vni cuz the mechanics of fw heavily favored gallente to just steam roll after so many months of t1, then just farm missions endlessly.
---
The last time this happened calmol thought the drake navy was gunna be a ratting ship. 5 months in i was making 4 bil a day
---
Obviously you only fly rifters....
---
Hyper hel pilot who Wishes he had a revenant....btw
---
I'm way more cancerous than that. I lose on average 1-2 onyx's a week gate camping and when I'm not gate camping I'm smart bombing. Where's your bob now?
---
Think of Revenants as gigantic poop-shaped Cynabals -- slippery and good at killing things smaller than itself. They are tailor-made to fight in sketchy situations. There is no reason to use them under behemoth capital umbrellas so shield slaves are irrelevant.  When I say "way easier to kill" I am referring to its ability to kill subcaps like dictors (woops damage application nerfed) and the NSA nerf (woops you are stuck on grid for 60 seconds if you want to lock dictors fast enough to kill them).
---
Exactly that linemember bees have been told at this stage we arent joining the war
---
IDK wtf you're talking about, my drake rox ass
---
Yeah or you could continue low effort posting
---
They don't have to give specific information
---
The application process for e-uni is so slow and convoluted by the time you're done you could've learned differential equations and Laplace transforms.
---
Well yes. The only issue is that his RL was tied to ingame character. So CCP should consider also this fact.                
---
"Braking NDA = BAN" well yes ... but lets be honest players engage with CCP in various ways, help CCP, promote the game outside of normal channels.          
---
If CCP did not care to talk first to a person that tied RL to game, became CSM and made EVE visible in media in a positive way ... before dropping a nuclear bomb on him ... that's horrific.             
---
Who after the "Brisc case" will ever cross the "help/get involved CCP" line again?
---
Not to mention brisc had no requirement to reveal his personal identity, he chose to. This is pure grandstanding.
---
Problem with init is they eat shit and then shit out spod.
---
Agree with that. Init line members are fine, the leadership are complete crap (as the current string of abuses proves).
---
Yeah true. I only think its a little OP because at least in small gang/solo it completely outperforms literally all other brawling battlecruisers and cruisers to an extent :)
---
No you don't it's not a requirement anymore. You only have to privately give it to ccp.
---
True, but all companies usually don't want any lawsuits - because it cost either way a lot of money, people involved in any kind of politics don't want bad publicity - same applies to community based games, like EVE.                    
---
Assuming that Brisc is guilty a "backstage" agreement could be made resulting in quiet ban and no bad press for either Brisc or CCP/EVE.             
---
Lack of this move ... i fear that someone acted way to quickly without thinking about the obvious consequences and if this happened, quite possibly not all things were checked properly.
---
Show me on the Brisc doll where CCP touched you. Also kudos for finally realizing you would never get on the CSM. It Only took you 5 years!
---
Yep same conclusion for me.         
---
NO ONE WANT BAD PUBLICITY           
---
If Brisc say "no one talked about this with me, no one want to talk just after" without any CCP statement ... that looks bad.             
---
Especially that we are talking about NDA, his work rely on this kind of agreements - for sure he have proper certificates in this matter, if over the years there was no issue in RL ... like i don't see this kind of person doing this ingame.
---
The post was actually automodded; Due to getting downvoted enough.
---
His brain was broke long before I got involved
---
Aye nice that the only decent source of Fed LP is FW and lvl5's since the level 4 highsec agents are so crap for burners.
---
Good to hear; DUST 514 was a bit of a mess, but I enjoyed it for what it was.  Would really like to play an Eve shooter on the PC.
---
Like whom?
---
They gave information. They received a tip from other members of the CSM, they investigated and found he had given the information to another player, who gave it to a third player who profited from it. What other information is needed?
---
Drakes were so good that draketrain was hands down the best FW corp, where their reign ended only after they ran out of pizza and had to do something about it.

If you like scanning join signal cartel

I’m Japanese. I want to play The sequel to DUST 514.Maybe the player strongly wants it
---
There are many fans in Japan who hope for the sequel.I also liked the design of DUST, so I think it is better to revert to the previous one.The fun of DUST was unique and unique to me.I think that it is a game that will still be popular if you properly publicize it, so please do not give up making it　I apologize that my English sentences are clumsy.
---
This game is way more interesting to read about on Reddit than it actually is to play, let's be honest here.
---
Thanks for that, a perfectly reasonable post on this matter.
---
Why would you drop a super on a VNI to start with?
---
So weird when u/StainGuy is a voice of reason in a thread.
---
Hell yeah, skill urself virgins confirmed T H E R A B O I S.
---
What, it was Sort's fault that Brisc Rubal got banned?!?
---
u should have continued to drop it in safe zone only
---
shit, our kb just got a drop
---
But 1+1 is 10.
---
You had to reach pretty hard for that one.
---
Probably there are more efficient ships to drop on VNIs  :)
---
this is the guy who dropped his rev on 2 kikimoras and 2 vedmaks and then spent the next hour talking in tapi discord about how he had the 'shakes' because he just 'dropped on PL'. 
---
Very Brave!
---
It's been like this for a week for me. I think it happens when you enter a new system with the map already open.
---
Most people use the sort function to actually sort. Especially, if they plan to share. But yeah the site has been very broken.
---
Stunt, Ironbank and plenty others who I cannot think of right now, but managed to publicly prove their innocence and force ccp to walk back the band
---
Thats kindof sad. I was waiting for the year you got in.
---
This made me giggle.
---
Bye
---
If you start treating your ships like disposable ammo and use them for high risk activities, you will be neck deep in ISK. Eve is very much low risk low reward. Try wormhole and null sec data/relic exploration in a covert ops if you have good scanning/hacking skills for example. Sometimes you find a relic site with 100m+ worth of loot and it takes all of 5 minutes to clear. Sometimes you only get 10m but it's still more profitable than mining in hi sec and it's quite easy to avoid getting ganked. 
---
Fleet Abyssals are also very profitable if you can fly something like a hawk with T2 launchers. Made my money back on the ship and fittings in 2 hours.
---
Good fucking job guys! 
---
Love Lobo x
---
sure  
---
everyone undock  
---
drake is primary
---
p.s. its funny how the instant he moved it outside of the tapi super umbrella he fed
---
You stole my karma
---
Your GPU is either dying horribly or it's overheating aka get the dust out.
---
Goddamn! That has to be the best recruitment video I ever saw.
---
Wondering how many shiny loot in TEST's keepstar😏
---
I have had similar problems long time now. When I have screen turned off and EVE client open several hours and then I turn screen on EVE client is flickering. After alt + tab and then opening EVE screen again flickering goes away. I don't even need to relog.
---
I'm pretty sure the joke starts a bit before then.  Before the drake was accepted as a great PVP ship, it was considered a real stinker of a ship, because it was *the* PVE ship and hordes of lower skilled players used them.  
---
Shield passive tank, no prop mod, no tackle mod, no damage mods.  It could tank well, and that was it.  People would use it in PVE, then try and fly the same fit into PVP.  This gave the ship a reputation for being shit.
---
Hence "FC, can I bring my drake".
---
1 more week!

The one step I don't understand is how you've used the RAF link with a steam account.

&gt;8th spot on the ticket
---
story checks out then
---
Yeah, the state of cross-platform GUI libraries is pretty sad and has been for a while.
---
If you want to stick with C#, I would suggest sticking to mono and the https://www.monodevelop.com IDE, which is kind of the same thing as xamarin studio on windows except the situation got murky after microsoft bought xamarin. It's possible to make robust cross-platform software by starting with mono which reimplements most but not all of c# on non-windows platforms. Going the other direction (write on windows, backport to mac/linux) is extremely difficult because the things that mono doesn't support are a bit random.
---
If you're developing exclusively on windows, you could also look into invoking the bash for windows subsystem to do linux compilations side-by-side with windows ones so you can discover compatibility problems as you write the code.
---
I'm always going to prefer native desktop applications, but I would understand and sympathize with anyone who chooses to avoid the trainwreck that is the current selection of GUI libraries :P

i saw xix on horde side and thought i was the bad guy at first. But we're actually on test side. this link is broken
---
If I fit a ship with with 4 or so warp core stabilizers would that make me warp disturber proof-ish? I resale this might not work if there are more than 1 or 2 bad men disrupting me.
---
even if he had quietly been banned and asked to step down from the CSM. if CCP did so because of what they believed to be a break in the NDA. then as a lawyer he would have had to self report the event anyway right?
---
I applied 2 daily alpha injectors over 2 days but I still can't train any skills. Am I missing something? My total skill points are little above 5 mill.
---
I'll admit - when i clicked on the zkill link I was a little disappointed to see only 2 supers dead.  was hoping a bit for it to be a 100 man dread bomb kind of whelp.
---
Good job wormhole bros though!
---
and that's why your as beta and he's an alpha
---
Whats the point of getting on GSM if you can't insider trade the info without getting goon fucked by Aryth for trading early.
---
:Goons: are the good guys.
---
tbh I am shocked it didn't die 6+ months ago.  with tcag gate, goonswarm and red alliance could have gotten sufficient dreads into range for a one-way trap of a high value target.
---
Take a moment to appreciate that the drake meme extends back more than 8 years.  If it was real time instead of internet time, the meme would have seen the first pyramids built.
---
Capital-ist swines!
---
Hey, there's a lot of good public schools out there.
---
Why are you so bitter?
---
Nobody flies this thing for efficiency.
---
It will go the same way as always. Gallente are dropping to t1 so VNI prices rise to 100m or more. They cash out with all their alts and then capture back all necessary systems to make LP again. Right now is just the time to run lvl4 missions with caldari alts to bank up a good amount of LP until gallente are t4 or t5 again
---
SO why does it have thrusters? Is it a mobile operating base? I mean that would be cool\^\^
---
neon genesis evangelion !!
---
I just noticed how many were destroyed since TSID.
---
Have you tried asking the goons to move them to high sec for you?  I'm sure they have a shipping service.
---
he probably figured out what caused ccp to believe that there has been a breaking of the NDA
---
Sad that Elo always only ‘hit’ parts and always leaves out the ‘run’ parts. And how he logs off whole fleet for 2-4 hours coz he cant take a fight, my advice maybe try and grow a pair. Just saying
---
they were on about it last night on the meta show 2 other csms might of set this all up because there corps am getting bashed by int at the mo and if you can't beat them in game you removed them from the game.
---
and if they have they the 2 csms need to be banned and removed from the game for ruining brisc's rl reputation
---
and the health of eve
---
There *is* a mechanic to counter booshing. Scram the jump dessie, or if that's too hard, pre-scram yourselves.
---
Any information helps speculation. CCP is silent on the matter just like every CSM removal before this. It is not a new turn of events, there is no special treatment here. The fact brisc mentioned litigation just ensures CCP is silent on the matter unless legal letters are exchanged.
---
Maybe if you had agreed to leak you would be on the GSM ballot sheet by now.
---
Agreed.

---
&gt;you can pay your subscription with in-game currency - but due to recent...
---
It has *always* been standard advice that you shouldn't play for plex.
---
Drakes are a good tanky combat BC (especially passive shield tank). But HAMs and heavy missiles both have serious drawbacks at the moment, and so it's almost impossible to get meaningful DPS out of a drake.
---
If you get into it you'll want to pay the $100-133 a year (sometimes they have good sales), bit technically you don't have to.  And it's not a huge deal if your subscription lapses here and there.
---
Their free/pay model is very fair.

Welcome to Eve Online, a game with elite PvP and eHonor.
---
It's a short time (3 months? something like that), but a well set up alliance IT system is likely to take records and keep them for longer than that.
---
TIL that having basic respect and conscientiousness for other people is being a "political shill" and "bigoted culture warrior".
---
This is hilarious.  If you believe this is what happened, I have some oceanfront property in Arizona to sell you.
---
I disagree. He is the one who decided to put his face out there and tie it to his EVE persona, he was the one who decided to leak, and he was the one who has proven himself as untrustworthy.
---
He gave himself enough (proverbial) rope to hang.
---
&gt;as soon as I finish skilling into a freighter and moving house 
---
You shouldn't need to skill into a freighter for that.  That's what courier contracts are for.  Also don't move shit you don't need.  Sell it in Jita.

If you open the link itself rather than just click play, it takes you there
---
Timestamp is 22:54
---
You're aware there's only 1 NCPL CSM member right? And that CCP would investigate further than one guy telling them `Hey Mr CCP brisc is doing the bad things with all of initiative leadership`?
---
It would make you safe from 1-2 scrams, depending if they are faction or not. That being said I'd highly recommend not relying on scrams for safety, and instead use a cloak/fast align speed/good situational awareness to avoid being caught. Tools such as d-scan and [Gatecamp Check](http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/) are much better at helping you avoid someone hunting then any number of stabs will. I can give you more specific advice depending on the scenario though.
---
what corps is beeing bashed by INIT atm according to you?
---
Ta very much.
---
There are no official plans that I know of, though there is a significant amount of excellent art that sometimes makes its way to this subreddit.
---
The big benefit to joining a corp he mentioned is that you know they're generally doing things "right" before you can really identify what "right" is on your own.  If you don't join one of the big ones, it's more likely than not you'll join an awful corp since you don't have the experience to figure out which ones are decent.
---
If you don't like the big null alliances after you learn the basics, you can always leave.  It's much easier to go from large alliance to small wormhole/whatever corp than the other way around.
---
There are literally no items in the calmil lp store you can bulk sell though.
---
Any decent corp uses stuff like teamspeak and discord and does interviews. Get with the program and you will find your way
---
"on the meta show"
---
that's where you could have realized that's it's just another "REEE, they hate us because we are goons" thing
---
Theran are actually good peepz
---
It was not before he edited it. :P
---
yeah I had a few old alts laying around. trial accounts from before Alphas that reactivated once Alphas arrived. their API had never been given to anyone and I jacknifed them myself when that was still working with APIs and it seemed like 3 months was about the limit. thanks for confirming it.
---
Every. Single. Time.

Is this gonna be a yearly thing from now?
---
Missiles
---
I feel like this applies:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76103335/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76103335/)
---
Ammo is a massive pain to sell bulk amounts of LP through
---
&gt;Fort won’t fit in a DST
---
ya it's not about the fort, in general people will put 10b+ in freighters which aren't what they're there for
---
ur right it wont fit tho
---
&gt;and to make it fit in an orca you you kill an hope of tanking an attack
---
incorrect, the shield tank of an orca is insane, and the force multiplier of logi+boosts (from the orca) makes them have a fuckton of ehp
---
Which is all well and good until FC brings his Drake. (Source: FC'd Horde ferox fleets in a drake many many times)

Pathetic Legion obviously. Although they’re dead lmao XD
---
Thanks
---
El Psy Congroo.
---
the guy seems he just cant let go of eve, like eve is tied in with his real life personality.
---
I hope people tell him how to deal with loss
---
So long as I had fun that's all that matters right?
---
I lost maybe 3 and ran hundreds of sites. Its hard for me to give ISK / hr because of the RNG and how I play, sometimes I end up going AFK between sites a lot. I had weeks where I made only like 1.2 bil and weeks where I made 6 bil +
---
O7
---
l only go by what was reported on the meta show last night
---
You're dumb
---
I mean given their attitude to AFK ratting maybe they don't care, but the reason not to autopilot to 0 is you could literally run a courier mission without touching the keyboard, and with very minimal risk.
---
Karma is rough yes, it's actually poetic cause I used to drop that with my test main for most of the time I owned it and nothing happened, I start using neutrals alts rip
---
Gallente did not let this happen, it happen to them,
---
All intention in the world to replace it
---
May she always find content in valhalla
---
Pretty sure there’s bigger problems about FW that they should be fixing
---
For content and to grab more killmarks, clearly got what I asked for
---
XD XD
---
I was the kinda of person who used it where I wanted, in some instances i dropped it in safer zones but outside of the super umbrella.
---
You do need to think before posting in local in J space, because you're providing valuable intel (that you are in the system) when you do so.
---
Well I guess we'll see how this plays out.
---
Always happy to contribute
---
No.... This is how it all starts, spod not even once
---
You can make the same arguement for anyone's keepstars ;)
---
You need to apply the skillpoints manually. After you used the Alpha Injectors you should see something like "100.000 unallocated skillpoints" at the very bottom of your character window. On the left of it there's 2 buttons, one for injecting more skillpoints (i.e.: "hey kid, wanna buy some skillpoints?") and one that reads something like: "apply skillpoints" if you click that one the 100.000 skillpoints will be applied to the skills of your training queue.
---
You will get the skillpoints instantly, so training in the traditional sense doesn't work anymore.
---
well thats up to you this is not going to affect my time in eve at all, and if you can't take some guy adding that this is what was reported on the meta show ... thats on you and how you am triggered by anything to do with goons
---
If it's a fair fight, both sides are doing it wrong, or at least taking something for fun rather than for tactical correctness.
---
Then again thats not what he said, but what you assumed.
---
Maybe you should consider a carreer in journalism.
---
Seems fine.
---
I will reimburse a new player and give them tips *if they accept the convo and don't act like a dick in it*, so yeah, good advice here. Be open to help from people who just killed you.
---
I didn't. That was one of the first things I was trying to see if I could do, but I couldn't.
---
I signed up for a regular RAF account through the website and then added it onto the launcher on steam immediately and logged in through there.
---
CSM is basically tainted now, I wouldn't vote for anyone. May as well just can the CSM altogether the same way they canned AT.
---
This cements in my mind that what has happened is that he did it accidentally by consulting the other banned people. The other banned people figured it out based on the questions he was asking and acted on it. Probably figured that "he didn't tell us what it was so it's not breaking NDA."
---
not to sure why this is shocking. typical ccp commuication. at least we got more info on the ban than when noobman was removed or any other csm member.

---
when did PL join GOTG?
---
nah.
---
Are you sure? Because more and more voices are showing off that some people tried to hit INIT this way.       
---
I also hear voices that say this "NDA leak" market speculation was done by very poor people - aka whatever market operation was "assumed wrongly or not" was not in trillions or even in hundreds of billions ... but much much smaller.              
---
Just to give you insight on my small level speculations.        
---
CCP declaring stop of the trig weapon drops - i get like 2-3 thousand various meta trig guns (200-300bil in material only when the stocks run out).           
---
CCP saying rorqual nerfs - 150bil in compressed minerals ... and i am doing like 2-3 things now that potentially can lead to good payout in the future.
---
Now here's someone still having fun in EVE
---
Yep. At least no one serious as knowing how this will end up will risk it.
---
Do you have a picture of the kill marks on the ship?
---
When it is about game ... hey i am troll, won't even deny it.      
---
But when it comes to someone RL, first thing check stuff 100 times and consider all the consequences.
---
unfortunately the last picture i have of it was when i got 300
---
Didn't expect to see a Malazan reference here!
---
Maximising dps i guess
---
Mind a link? I'm interested in seeing what 300 killstreak looks like.
---
It's okay, you can quote it here. You don't have to worry about breaking an NDA or anything.
---
Lol. They’re hot trash and their leadership will continue to make sure they stay that way.
---
I never said that.

Awesome video, I love the comms.

Drakes were vaga and cyna   killers. Especially heavy missile drakes
---
Is caring about external image the new killboard stats?
---
You could tell he was pulling out all the stops, really rolling his sleeves up when he called them "schmucks"
---
Damn, how can you be so stupid? Get rid of your tinfoil hat, mate,
---
there is one point and telling my own name ... you they are not unique in every Country anyways...
---
Giving away my name including more details about what iam doing in private is something diffrent. And he did this to point out that he is a good and worthy opponent to be CSM. I have no clue what he did or if he did something at all but clearly it was him telling everybody who is behind his avatar... so this is just some personal risk he took and now have to stay and deal with it.
---
On the other site iam not distrusting CCP to launch  a campain like that without propper truth. I mean he and his 2 friends are part of the biggest block in eve online. So you dont fuck around withso many people just for the lols
---
Funny thing is that most Goons dont believe Brisc/INIT on this.
---
I belive this is what it has to be.
---
Ok, I’ll join the Triglavians. They can’t be worse than Sansha Kuvakei.
---
For credibility, "I heard it on the Meta Show" is up there with "Some guy told me on Twitter" and "Space aliens whispered it while abducting me for medical experiments."

Can you point to the doll where I touched you?

They should just rework Nova into PlanetSide. But entosis/scram real ships

Well I mean if you don't break NDAs like a mouthbreather you should be fine.

He was a lobbyist. He should know these things, he wasn't even clever with it.
---
You literary missed a duel between Raven Navy Issue and Marshal in a system next door. They gtfoed the moment you dropped
---
What's the biggest loop of systems with locators?
---
Is this a complaint about not getting easy kills?
---
Damn lol terrible timing I suppose
---
me too talks about himself in third person
---
That's hilarious! Where did you get the sound file from?
---
Shortest
---
sure, but these days it's harder than ever as an unestablished player unfortunately.
---
Talk about a step backward. WH to high sec mining, ouch. 
---
Wormholer, btw
---
Tbh, I kinda understand him. Playing EVE since 2006, I’d hate to he forced to stop playing. But, of course, if I join the CSM and I sign a NDA, I love the game that much that I would not break the mentioned NDA, no matter who asks, not even family.
---
Ah I see! A few days ago I was struggling with steam and eve and their different account systems (for an alt). Thanks.
---
Pssst, you didn't link the website itself.
---
clearly Fair&amp;Balanced
---
Whoops :-)
---
The url is [https://www.eveworkbench.com](https://www.eveworkbench.com) :D
---
A possible reason could be that you are not done yet with the career path.
---
Biggest loop with at least one locator per system.
---
depends
---
No, biggest. If every system in the loop has them, then you want a big loop.
---
It was the final mission for the career path
---
Something similar to that is what I expect tbqh. 
---
Like, I can understand, but admitting that and asking for clemency is gonna end better than I'M INNOCENT BELIEVE ME
---
Can’t use search ingame for locator agents ?
---
Have you gone back to talk with the agent?
---
Yep. Thats when it said that the mission wasn’t done, but all the objectives were checked
---
I just did smt like this, but still need to add market and broker fees, for small value orders
---
Do you know how normal conversation works? Normally you have your dick in your trousers, rather than waving it at everyone.
---
Perfect video
---
&gt;  The slot layout (from my memory) has never changed and has lost maybe a 5% shield resistance - a small nerf.  It is the fact that every other BC was made usable that people think it was nerfed.  The drake has always been, and always will be.
---
From what i remember the drake got nerfed repeatedly. There was a nerf to heavy missiles or the bonuses on the ship i can't remember which. A fitting nerf and as you say the resistance nerf.  
---
I remember it clearly as i used to try and always talk people in to using the drake on mass as it was such a handy ship. But was always called a silly newbro and no one would listen. Then iirc around 2011 AAA started to use them on mass to great success in their southern war. From there it spread to the big coalitions and you ended up with repeated cries for the ship to be nerfed.
---
Also iirc one of the thing that made the drake great was because you could train the missile system you wanted to straight away. Back then iirc correctly training guns was much harder, you had to train small gun type to lvl 5 then medium gun type to lvl 5 to be able to use large guns. I could be wrong on that last point but i do remember it being much harder to train guns for some reason.
---
The drake was indeed nerfed - in the same way that the hurricane was. The warp speed changes killed roaming BC.
---
same
---
Post it on YouTube , somehow i can't play it on Reddit :(
---
Who ever said INIT was elite?
---
schmucks is too spicy for midwesterners mmmmkay
---
That's a great question, I thought about that myself, but getting the solution for that isn't as simple and I decided I'm too lazy for that today.
---
can you post a screenshot of the conversation?
---
You need a corp that engages you. You need to have your own content (exploration) but the corp needs to be providing a backbone for your play. There needs to be a story to what you are doing, or the game really becomes.... nothing. 
---
In my corp, for example, we try to build content around mining and industry with a lot PvP to support that narrative. The exploration guys are finding the WH connections we need for trade and combat. 
---
Once you see yourself as a part of a group which is doing something, then the game comes alive. Otherwise you end up on repeat, doing the same thing over and over again (like pvp roams) chasing that dope hit like a junkie and burn out.
---
Nvm I just figured it out. Sorry
---
well played.

Suggestion: In the search bar you could extend Market and Fittings with Contracts to enable pricing of Blueprints with my new api [https://www.reddit.com/r/evetech/comments/bd27ag/new\_pricing\_api\_based\_on\_contracts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/evetech/comments/bd27ag/new_pricing_api_based_on_contracts/)
---
I mean missiles still hit, yes, but you’d want to keep your traversal up as that reduces damage from missiles. If you ram the drake you’ll both be moving very slowly for a bit meaning he’ll hit you for max damage. So it’s a gamble at that point of who can kill who faster, one which the Drake seems more likely to win.
---
Not in Insmother.
---
Oh I get it! Thank you for the explanation!
---
Thank you for the answer. That was more of a general question. I don't have any specific scenario as an example. But I will keep your tips in mind!
---
Funny thing, that all this whining from op and other INIT members will make it even less likely that they get unbanned: CCP wont let themselves look like they haven been pushed around now.
---
Doesn't it destroy your rep with the other factions? And what about your sec status
---
That’s how it works? If downvoted enough, it deletes itself?
---
Fw is great but the citadels.
---
For the love of god please next time use DPS in low instead of ODs.
---
Go to minmatar low sec fly frigates kill carebears  get lp and become a real man.
---
If I were in a Vaga/Cyna I wouldn't engage a drake tbh
---
It does ruin your reps, but this is an alt and I'm focused on FW with her, so it's all good. Your sec status does go down, but again, focused on FW and I'm mostly in low-sec so I'm not bothered by it. I think you can manage to get positive sec status too. I've seen some guys with it.
---
I don't know about those yet in terms of FW. I'm sure I'll learn soon.

The problem with eve is that casual players stand no chance of actually getting ahead without buying plex (that is fine it’s a hobby). The content in eve goes from safe and really boring to extremely unsafe and risky. There is not a good movement to the end game for a casual gamer. You have two choices play all day everyday (like most of the top players) or buy lots of plex to keep up on your losses.
---
Mhm... I was in fw the last time caldari was t5. I know what happened. The big gallente corps went farming in null and said fuck fw for some time. When they sold most lp they went back into fw and took all systems while getting help from snuffed

Got the free omega week from steam. I want to continue for free after that ,but will there be something for me to do? I like ratting with railguns or something from long distance.

You guys lost more, ISK, more Ships, and didn't even get any objectives. Congrats on winning this fight, lol

I'm sure Brisc knows what he did, in his mind, he probably believes he was just short of the line, but probably miscalculated where the line actually was.

What I’m trying to get at here was that it wasn’t like gallente said ‘hold on boys, stop hitting the plexes, let us go down to tier 1 so that our LP increases in value’. Some of the last calmil groups left in the war zone got together and co-ordinated a joint push.
---
Thx for the more accurate one：）

Spoken like a champion, they’ll have my vote!

If this was a regular super dropping on subs in their home region nobody would give a fuck, but because it was a faction super everyone's acting like it was ballsy af.
---
It was the big GalMil corps that said bye bye and so there was nothing coordinated enough to stop calmil
---
Exactly, so it happened to them, they did not let it happen.
---
I'm not your pal, friend.
---
I think there's a middle ground. My problem is that all the goals people talk about and that new players see, like ratting with your corp or wormhole space exploration and the bigger fleet battles over POS are so out of the reach of new players that they become disillusioned quickly. I think nullsec is the most fun part of the game, even if you get podded, but new players need to play in hisec just to learn how all the systems work before venturing forward, unless you're very active in a corp. It's tough.
---
Well i dont See the smaller fw able to do anything. Its only the big corps that manage the whole area anyway. And what they say happens
---
Immediately plan to plex 2 chars. One for pvp one for isk making.  Is the first and best advice i got.
---
[you should jump](https://xkcd.com/1170/)

Null is great but if you want to pvp and only have a few hours a night to play you must buy plex as you cannot sustain.

I haven’t figured out if this is a bad thing yet or not. Like think about other hobbies. If you like to fish once in a while you spend a few hundred bucks on gear and each time you go out you buy bait etc. the real issue is that making any money in high sec is close to impossible. For a newish player there is no high sec middle ground.
---
2+? What Eve have you been playing? It taught me to multibox 15 accounts
---
Use the steam interface if you wanna bring up a browser while in game.
---
You don't need a steam eve account either just add eve to steam
---
Nice article btw look forward to part 2
---
You werent done he? Hehehe I just finished mine aswell did the industrial career agent after. That one was pretty quick. Did you do the others aswell?
---
ITT, people responding to a troll thread as if it was written by a Test pilot.
---
I’m also trying to complete the industrial career but the first mission is glitched or something because it leads me to the middle of nowhere
---
I think you'll find you killed them rather than nerfed them.

it's just a bar only to surpass :)

what other op's did we fail recently?

Thank you so much :)

AAR  hard. Game bad. Init evict.   
---
Right?
---
2:1 numbers, and still only caught a handful. Lmao. This post is worse than your home defense.
---
You do realize just how toxic you come across right?
---
And i think that is where the huge gap is. To make your money you need to in some way interact with the more fringe areas like null, WH etc. So either you latch on to others who already have that insight or you run into a brick wall. I mean even if you buy PLEX, as a new player you're almost guaranteed to waste it.
---
 [https://dscan.info/v/aa1761a42cba](https://dscan.info/v/aa1761a42cba)  thats their actual numbers

Jesus is he ill or something? Talking about not showering for months etc lol
---
I was talking to the Holesale retard who made the post.
---
get good standing to their faction
---
yes and im pointing out it was 4:1 numbers?
---
There is a ‘middle class’ in eve, regarding isk or time. We just used to disregard it as ‘low isk/hr’ because it can’t pay for omega.   
---
The day I subbed all my accs with card was wonderful. Plenty isk to spend, lots of stuff to do. Thing is, it was a bit too late, I’m slowboating to winning eve but now I know it can be enjoyed as a game, not as a second job.
---
I don't know why im playing this game at one point.
---
the messy tidi and local spam
---
I think its hilarious that moments after he puts the puzzle together he bows out of the interview in a completely different tone.  It doesn't matter if you didn't say exactly what it was.   They didn't guess this, he said enough to guide them to the information they needed to act on.  Trying to say they damaged his reputation?  You are the idiot politician who decided to link his own RL identity to your Eve identity.  You did something dumb in game - you shot yourself in the foot, not CCP.  On one hand I feel for the guy that his game transgression has damaged his RL reputation, but on the other hand I dont.  You put yourself in the position and honestly listening to you mumble on about how you "categorically deny" (god I love regurgitated learned statements to sound as important as possible) even though I'm sure you know exactly how you ended up in your position, gives me sympathy ratings approaching 0.

lol holesale

Can we have a br not on a cancer website please?
---
Looks promising, but for now we will focus on the Fittings part where the market data is used :).
---
Perhaps we can use it on a later moment.
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/suitonia/clip/AverageSmilingSpiderDancingBaby](https://www.twitch.tv/suitonia/clip/AverageSmilingSpiderDancingBaby)   
---
That's the TL;DR
---
We could upload some Osmium fittings, we have the files from 2018.
---
I think its not very useful to upload older fittings.
---
Looks great, but for the trade tool you need to have a profit percentage and probably a profit percentage filter, because of taxes.
---
Sorry. Let me make it up to you. Here have a saltless version of the CSM-Brisc doll, for free.
---
Thanks! Its the first time I heard this, but can imagine it since the contrast. Thank you for the feedback!
---
Please tell that to the Pentagon.
---
Yes I had that exact same thing happen to me few weeks ago on some of my accounts not all
---
Weird and very annoying
---
STOP with that BR Tool, People, C'mon!
---
 something abstract potentially Might accidentally INNOCENT believe probably clemency
---
You would think they would store this on the cloud they keep talking about. Lot of good that technology did eve.
---
ahh the ol' "you are salty card" eh
---
Was a fun proper brawl. Kind of wished that squad didn't bomb, but they bombed everyone.

wow tapi sure got blobbed this time round

Salt is not sodium, it's  sodium chloride.

You guys are so bad.
---
mhh look HK didnt wanted to blob or use a retarded bocsh doctrine. they fail. r/eve starts reeeeing.

should have brought bocsh ravens and batphone all of wh space for a tiny bit less worse reddit publicity but not have a decent brawl in the process...obviously!!!

another zesty op...

only there for armor timer btw

which went without flaw ....
---
Yo I actually like lake Havasu. Okay?
---
did you make the isk back in donations from this thread yet?
---
Missiles have been fiddled with, as have all the weapon systems, and as a result went down in relative power.  This is not a nerf directly to the drake and I don't count it as a nerf to the hull, I'd count it as a nerf to Tengus if I had to - our drake was merely collateral damage.  The fitting nerf was hardly a nerf with regards to the conversation at hand - the same passive tanks that fit 10 years ago can still be fit.  The fitting nerf meaningfully affects only command burst fits because the requirements for the module are so steep.
---
I'll grant you even the indirect nerfs against the drake but the aggregate effect of them all still pales in comparison to the massive buffs granted to their cousins.  Far more of the decision to choose a hull other than a drake is those hull's buffs instead of the minor nerfs to the drake.  If I fit out a drake today for L4s, it would perform indistinguishably from how it did in 2011 (plus some damage because I've picked up some skillpoints since then).
---
I have the same vague memory you do about training guns - something is in my mind about damage to target taking fewer skillpoints than turrets (it was much more difficult to get under the guns on missile platforms?).  It's been so long, I don't remember how the skills were gated.
---
you are a good boi!
---
i can only hope :)
---
I’m kinda new to the game. This looks like it will help me out a lot. Great job and thanks!
---
I always tell people that eve is a commitment.  How deep that commitment is can vary, but if you're not committed to at least really, truly learning the game, it probably won't be fun.  The more committed you are, the more rewarding eve can be.
---
The easiest locator loop starts in Anttiri. 11 level 4's and another 11 level 3's within 3 jumps. I think in grand total it's around 30 something agents within 5 jumps.
---

Call at least someone who uses bots in Blood Demons. First give proof. We will deal with them. Or shut your mouth if you just wanted to lie.

Evernus was great when it worked. I think right now it can't pull citadel data very well. If you were able to get that going, that would be cool.

More feature testing for upcoming updates to locate cloaked ships
---
By your own logic the info is already out there. You are reasoning it is known to a select group of people that have no reason to withhold it, or that could still profit from it using a proxy or new characters.  
---
*Disclaimer: Right now I am getting filthy rich because the general populace doesn't know what is coming /s*

why the subquery? it seems that all it's accomplishing is getting the count of lvl 3 agents. You can accomplish the same thing by grouping by agent level. If you really want level 3 and level 4 totals as separate columns you could UNION two queries together or pivot them in excel/google sheets
---
Cool article but how can you play eve for 10 years and be a newbro, still? Or was that for narrative?
---
"The risk I took was calculated, but man, am I bad at math."
---
Well that really has nothing to do with it but ok retard
---
Isn't there a 3rd group? Where you see a group of 4 (or maybe 5) ships you the same type warping about?
---
I haven't seen them for a while (but I haven't been looking for them or travelling about much recently). I have watched them in the past destroying auto piloting ships as they slow boated to a gate.
---
The single ship groups aren't the same as the response fleets with their scrams, logi and dps. I assumed they were linked to FOB's?
---
If you look at https://zkillboard.com/system/30005235/ on the 13th April for example there are ◆ NPC rat kills followed by a FOB kill.
---
Yes they appear in systems with Sotiyos and Foward Operating bases too.
---
That's awesome, I'm really excited every time I hear about a story like this.  Not necessarily FW, but just finding a core group to enjoy space with.  
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Let's assess the logic here - someone is killing a fleet of pirates. A third party comes in to shoot the guy, effectively helping the pirates. Pirates decide to immediately help the person who was just murdering them because...reasons?
---
And Ishtars/Gilas/VNIs are hardly "easy kills". They can easily defend themselves against solo AFs/destroyers if they just fit alternate damage types, scram, neut, etc. Most of them don't though and instead just put acolytes on a wolf or something.
---
Usually when this kind of thing happens, it is hardware or driver version related.  But, particularly for graphics software issues, we have a lot of error telemetry in place and if we do introduce a low-level engine issue, we can sometimes see it and correct it based on that telemetry.
---
The first step in diagnosing a new problem like this is to check your driver version, make sure your GPU has good airflow, that cabling is secure and working, and that the monitor is not having problems.
---
If you open a support ticket for us, the GM will first encourage you to check all those things, but once you do, a bug report is always welcome, and may help us fix any issues on the software side.  If you’re able to do so in-game, that’s preferable.  Press F12 and click Report Bug.  Out of game you can do so at https://bugs.eveonline.com/
---
Lol I bet
---
how is exploration and ratting out of reach of new players
---
alphas can literally fly rattlesnakes and nestors
---
Mostly a solo/small gang pvper these days.  I still like the Drake (cheap, disposable), but it does nothing better than some other ship can.  Tengu can go cloaky/null and pull about the same dps with hams as a ham Drake while being faster and way harder to catch (and like 500%+ more expensive).
---
But in the glory days, nano drakes were terrifying.
---
no
---
just find a more efficient way to make money than ratting
---
Ohh like hauling? Or market trading? Or scanning ? They all make about the same isk for a casual player
---
I would've put you on my ballot.
---
In EVE there's always something to do, and nothing to do at the same time. The game is what you make of it. And simple ratting with rails is definitely doable for an alpha. I'd say look up the magic 14 and train those up a bit first, since they'll benefit everything. And then find a sniper ship (e.g. naga) you like and train the relevant skills to fly it.
---
Yes, I "really" wanted to have those three seperate columns and I wanted to have an output that I could copy-paste directly without needing to go through another tool.
---
I didn't know about PIVOT though, like I said I very rarely deal with SQL.
---
Use dscan, warp to the athanors, look and see if there are rocks.
---
My eve career has been very on and off.
---
CLIP IS AMAZING
---
Man I always just run away scared from the diamond NPCs - this is dope
---
Can we...can we not
---
We can’t fight without the numbers advantage anymore. That’s who we are.
---
It's just not very good SQL. It works in this instance because the size of the data is very small and you only want two levels worth of data, but it's worth doing it the right way if there's a chance you'll ever have to use SQL professionally/regularly in the future. Please don't take this as a criticism of you - you said you don't use SQL - but more of a comment on best practices.
---
Were you in Provi back then? There weren't a lot of stations in null outside of provi, so yeah you could lose the better part of everything in a POS. You could spread them out if you had isk to fuel them but we took real chances with assets when POSes were the thing.
---
To be honest, you answered the complaint regarding my suggestion on removing asset safety... Don't put all your shit in one citadel. Problem solved.
---
IMO, anything CCP implements that includes the word "safe" is a mistake and contrary to the game's roots. CCP was founded by guys who loved the hard core nature of Ultima
---
Better than they have been.
---
Not as good as they used to be
---
Drag your coworker back with you. A mentor is ridiculously valuable in eve, and one who ran a pirate corp probably know a bit about what hes doing.
---
Little column A, Little column B. Btw Calmil also said this last time. It was one of the reasons we erased all their structures when we did come back.
---
No worries, I appreciate it.
---
Sounds like you were doing basically what I was doing too.  There are probably exploration corps out there.  
---
I'm not currently subbed, but I'd hop back on if you wanted to join up and figure out a strategy for WH or null exploration
---
Right on. 
---
Well, "Go do stuff." 😆
---
They lost all the objectives and the ISK war
---
I do engage them. If you know how to do it you can loot their strongbox.
---
If HAD its own card game  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve:\_The\_Second\_Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve:_The_Second_Genesis)
---
I totally agree, safety in Eve is contrary to the nature of the game, and citadel asset safety and tether definitely fall into that category.
---
Yes, I have lived in Provi the whole time I have played the game. Good guess!
---
Are you in paan? I think I know you :)
---
\&gt; Use dscan, warp to the athanors, look and see if there are rocks. 
---
That sounds like what he's already doing but there are more aths than it's worth.
---
Wish I could help you, OP but I don't think there is a way. They don't get a beacon like standard belts or an anom like the others and you can't dscan rocks themselves.
---
I always come back to exploration/hacking whenever I get bored of other stuff.
---
Wait, you were mining in a wormhole, so in the Fullerite sites I guess... didn’t the sleepers that spawned after 20 (or so) minutes bother you?
---
I miss the awesome relaxing music from highsec... nullsec is just noise and dramatic music.
---
If you wanna get a good feel for PVP, get into a noob-friendly corp like red v blue.  I believe they'll just give you ships and modules...
---
Initiative Mercenaries is a alliance filled with competent pilots. The corporation "Project Stealth Squad" fought with firepower.
---
Haul routes.....hmmmmmm sounds like a incoming gank fest
---
Yooo Jackkkkkk, join Panni guys this corp's amazing, I'm having Hella fun in it as a newbie
---
Join RvB. There Ou can learn PvP. Lot of good old pew pew players. Training fleets for small and solo pvp etc
---
Think the routes themselves are already known ;) And if you haul you are always a potential target so :D
---
it was first and only time i found gas site what had no sleepers in it at all, only time i was distrurbed was different player firing rockets at me, next times when i tried gas mining i allways had to warp to different anomaly every few minutes because sleepers fleet arrived and stayed here untill they followed me to different site
---
\+1 to the idea of importing osmium content, i think it can be nice to kickstart the site and have some ideas of fits.  
---
Even if they are old, because you have the eve version displayed on the top right people can easily figure out why some of the fits are not working anymore (absolete), but it still give a direction on how to fit a ship.
---
Come to wormhole space for your healthy dose of upship / outnumber or nothing pvp.
---
Currently floating around in my drone boat trying to figure out what the hell i'm trying to do haha.
---
Nah the good news for you is that you won’t remember how much fun it used to be.
---
I was chatting to Brisc the other day as well and this is exactly how I found out about the upcoming changes. Been buying Jita empty since then on undisclosed alts and am currently expecting to make a few tril on this shit  
---
Rorqs + moon goo folks. Think about it. It should be obvious soon to everyone with a clue
---
Spectre Fleet are a good bunch of pilots.
---
I am now, yes lol
---
Of course. I also hope it helps those on the fence about FW or PvP jump in.
---
Everyone in the imperium knows what is going to happen. Heavy water prices have been dropping for a reason, and caracal navy's obviously climbing in demand. If you want to make a good buck on this go full into Ozone, its the last remaining item with $$$ written all over it
---
Well that sucks...I think. Cant tell if sarcasm o_O
---
The remaining galmil group is plenty coordinated enough to stop calmil. No one wants to stop calmil. They want to cash out.
---
insiders knew when they saw that cadmium spike at 22th of March
---
Cheers for the clarification Falcon. Peeps be hungry for correct information so misinformation isn’t helpful.
---
Surely CCP have given you all the details you need?
---
"rest of eve" lol
---
It’s not. We used to have these 24/7 (like literally 24 hours a day) home system pushes that would temporarily make whatever system we were fighting over the deadliest one in Eve. Citadels sucked the life out of those fights. Now, if you take someone’s home system they just relocate to an Astra. Kill that Astra? They put another 3 down. It’s just made system pushes pointless.
---
Implying that 99% of haulers don't just fly through the same choke points in between market hubs already.
---
&gt;The other banned people figured it out based on the questions he was asking and acted on it. 
---
Kinda weird they weren't permabanned, no?
---
Hey kimmy, it's Konstantin with PAANN. Good to see you're enjoying it.
---
&gt;I think its hilarious that moments after he puts the puzzle together he bows out of the interview in a completely different tone. 
---
Well it might just *maybe* be something to do with the third person being INIT's other major FC? You don't think that's something that *might* trigger an entirely different kind of realisation?
---
"Hey player representatives, what do you think will the players think of the upcoming changes?"
---
"... the upcoming changes?"
---
"Oh yeah we can't tell you because of Brisc"
---
F for respect.  Awesome that you're able to celebrate dying in a glorious fire. 
---
Praise Bob
---
I'm assuming that CCP considers their infractions less severe than Brisc's. Had they actually been properly fed insider info i think they would be permabanned.
---
Well, yeah. It cost as much as 10 regular supers.
---
Yeah it sucks but you have to prove every moon. No shortcuts unfortunately
---
We literally did just this.
---
Praise be unto him, I'm not mad or sad which I never thought possible, I did dread the day would come but I'm not too upset
---
I see..and which race should I start ?
---
quality chuckle.
---
Yep you described me to a tee right here.
---
No.
---
Go join any null alliance where people share moon "belts" schedule between their members.
---
Well clearly not. It's almost like, there is something missing, some sort of..lack of information here, which caused the OP to noodle it over and over and over and rewind the audio and look for subtle hints in tone and inflection, then rewind back and to the left then come here and make this post in search of meaning, like a monk staring off into space murmuring "brisc.....brisc....brisc", contemplating the meaning of life  while the sun sets into oblivion.   Let's hope he finds the details soon!
---
TEST alliance lost rorquals, because TEST alliance has zero supportive pilots.
---
Ohhhh okay, well I'm glad I missed it, kind of. Fights for days I'm sure lol
---
First I love this game.
---
But my biggest problem with it is that it takes forever to grind skills with out injecting skill points.
---
Thats what i wanted to say
---
Yeah it's a bit sad that there's not a lot of cross platform gui libraries, I was also looking at Avalonia which is cross platform but it's still a work in progress and is missing some controls... I'll look into mono!
---
Mine didn't have anything inappropriate and were deleted as well
---
&gt; keep your traversal up
---
Just speed.
---
m8, these are great
---
Not responsive on mobile
---
Well done Lionear!  Upvote for visibility!
---
Yeah, that was what I was wondering if there were other objects that dscan or discovery probes could pickup.  Alot of the ones I find while going moon to moon are empty so depending on ships being there is usually a bust.
---
Quality choice in music good sir
---
Unfortunately I'm not active enough for most null sec alliances.  Which is fine, I understand they want active members but I can't spend 5 hours a day on an op.
---
I don't blame the wolf. The tunnel vision some people get when in a fight makes it easy to assume that they're pointed when they might not be.
---
There are plenty alliances that just want people to mine or shoot rats so they can collect tax.
---
Traversal does nothing against missiles.  Speed matters though.  But speed != traversal
---
Honestly it's not hard to tech into other races' ships whenever you want to. I'd say just pick whatever looks cool for now. If you want rail guns to start with, try Gallente.
---
I don't know, but when we suspect something strongly, the natural inclination is to interpret whatever we believe into what limited info we have to go on, validating our own prejudices. I don't know what he did and honestly don't care at this point. It is done.
---
bocsh
---
I don't have any requests but I just wanted to say that you're awesome and I wish you the best in the development!
---
If I fit a HG pod and a-type shield booster to a worm then shit on t1 frigs is that ballsy too?
---
Yeah I agree, the font/background combination just doesn't work. It looks good, but it's difficult to read. The fit images are also tiny on my resolution, cant make out the DED, Factrion, T2 image in the corner it's so small.
---
It's a beautiful site, good use of bootstrap, but usability suffers from the colour/font and tiny images. Tables also use some odd headers to separate high/low/mids/rigs.
---
Awesome content, great to see a proper market and fitting site return, however take a good look at something like Dotlan which has a much more usable UI.
---
Apparently CCP is enforcing bans for local spam which can cause TIDI I believe? You can submit a report with a screenshot of said spam with a time stamp....not sure if this is true or not but I read this somewhere cant remember to be exact.
---
By any accident did you managed to find a gate leading to Stain?

OPSEC
---
It's not all about how long you can be on. There are plenty of groups out there that just want you to have fun and participate when you can. You'll learn a lot from them too.
---
I guess, yeah. Why not? Everytime you undock in whatever, there's a chance you'll lose it, and if you undock enough, that chance eventually approaches 100%.  If you're undocking your however expensive Worm, enough to get 300+ KMs on it, eventually you'll get baited and die, so yeah. That takes balls.
---
I mean you don't have to think it's ballsy. I don't even know how ballsy it is because I don't have that kind of Isk laying around.  I don't really feel like it's my place to judge the ballsyness of people who do, and fly shut that expensive every single day.
---
It was one of the better things to do in Eve. Log on and you were stuck into a 20 v 20 frig/dessie/cruiser brawl within minutes. As long as you were in fleet and in system, the content never stopped.
---
I've been playing eve off and on since launch in 2003.  I've been in about 4 or 5 nullsec alliances and each one had a minimum requirement of either op participation or mining a certain amount of minerals.  In one instance I was let go because I was only online for 1 or 2 hours a day and couldn't participate in the 5 hour roams that took place.
---
The entire way this is written is retarded.
---
As someone who wants to see the north killed off this theory is utter shit.
---
Would you like to buy a clock? It's in England, we can't ship it to you because it's stuck to a tower in a city but it looks quite nice and it'll be yours.

rei best girl B)
---
Drakes are great because they get you fights. Go hams, brawl in, have fun.
---
Goon alliance is not that much. Some corps require 5 paps per month. Karmafleet requires just one I think. And they always recruit.
---
I was there..... and died fast... at least i killed market tycoon, op success
---
Well I guess this is where I disagree. Spending isk on something isn't ballsy, taking hard fights is.
---
I miss o.smium so much. Are you working with that guy for your fitting interface?
---
There should be a warpable beacon just like anoms. Moons are more profitable than anoms something something risk vs reward should come into play. But nah that'll take another 6 months before CCP realizes its a shit mechanic.
---
People like you make EVE great. o7 to you and to the loss of a great ship. Hope you get another soon.
---
I guess (I'm a newbie in everything here) that the best is bring a combat friend with you to deal with the sleepers... your drones alone can't defeat the sleepers in the gas sites.
---
Or then make only half of the gas site before going away.
---
Yep. If you have to drop it with support, may as well drop a Hel and be able to replace it four times.
---
Thank you, and I aim to get another one soon O7
---
Not really. They were not under NDA, only EULA and TOS. He was under EULA, TOS **and** NDA. The NDA is most important of these and takes priority.
---
Horde has zero participation requirements and is actually pretty fun to fly with.
---
I did join Caldari. You can want to shoot me, that's 100% okay by me :) I injected it because I wanted an alt to mess with. Hope to see you around space. I'll have fun no matter the outcome :D
---
:D you can do it! Message me ingame and we can be confused together! Boboko busanagi
---
Yeah, dat time grind.
---
Can't win them all, can't win them all.
---
Open a mining tab that shows the ore and dscan for those instead? hit alt+shift+z or x to show moons in space (not sure on the shortcut) ideally your dscan would show the athanor and the ores and just select the moons after you did a 90 or 180 scan.
---
I give respect to NodaNoda for fighting.

l dont give a dam tbf, but dam its triggered so many people its good reading after my sunday roast ;P
---
Well either they knowingly abused NDA information to the detriment of other players or they didn't. If they did, then they should absolutely be banned. But I personally think it's highly likely that they didn't.
---
And when I say "detriment", that's a thing that mattered. For instance when I was on the CSM, I was told about the Crius changes (no more remote research), and promptly researched up some BPOs that I owned but hadn't bothered doing anything with. If you wanted to be a super-vigilant NDA kommisar about it, you could yell that that was "abusing the NDA", but the scale of the action matters. Basically the action has to be something that you wouldn't have contemplated doing unless there was leaked info - researching up a few BPOs already owned is something that anyone might normally do, and wouldn't really have any perceptible effect on anyone else. Whereas eg: Larkonis bought (or caused to be bought, I forget the precise detail) a massive amount of moongoo, which he would never have normally done, and which would indeed have given him a meaningful advantage.
---
So basically, to have been banned this way, CCP must have decided that both Dark and Pando did some large scale action that would give them a meaningful advantage and which would only make sense if they'd been given NDA info. But if there's no indication that they were fed insider info, only a 'suspicious coincidence' hen CCP might well, as you say, consider their actions less severe.
---
But by the very nature of that scenario, there might be other interpretations of the activity. My understanding is that Dark and Pando and probably Brisc are talking with CCP right now to discuss this.
---
Delete local and full scans and only allow for 5 degree scans
---
What do you think about having a scripted nsa. Giving you the ability to remove the scrambling effect but gain some other negative effect. 
---
 I think the Rev role as a slippery super is hilarious and I'm sad it got cut down a little
---
Assuredly, chopping off the head to get rid of a headache is a tried and tested solution that never fails to deliver.
---
currently the only BR tool that works, so make better or STFU
---
show a better BR tool (that actually works!) or just go, away, faaar away
---
both zkill and br.inyour.space are working.
---
And people not realizing that INIT only has Pando and Dark Shines.
---
Another couple tips for exploration, if you decide to stay in nullsec. 
---
The best regions for exploration have sansha’s nation rats, because those cans drop intact armor plates, which are extremely valuable. These regions would be Catch, Esoteria, Paragon Soul, and Stain. Just ignore Stain, it is so busy and full of campers it’s not worth entering. 
---
If you want to do the other regions, you’ll need to know how to use mwd + cloak to escape from a bubble gatecamp. And how to check people’s killboards to see if they camp relic sites to kill explorers, obviously you should just pass through systems with these people in them without doing any sites. 
---
Getting good at that takes practice, and you’ll definitely lose your ship a few times while learning, but once you get the hang of it you can make well over 100 mil isk/hr while casually exploring, and much more than that if you do the same areas, and either don’t log off or just log the sites you already scanned in something like tripwire. (If you take a large enough loop to let sites reapawn, by the time you come back you won’t see many unknown sigs that aren’t relic sites)
---
zkill, is just extremely bad. good for initial look but than it's just bad.
---
br.inyour.space is not properly working for like 2-3 months now.. ppl still use it, but it often shows only a fraction of the kills/players etc. 
---
If I'm wrong, please show me a properly working BR on br.inyour.space, I also like it much more, design wise. And if it's fixed, I would love to return.
---
Clip ended before we see the loot what is this
---
It’s even more useful in nullsec, as you can look up all the players in system, not just the system itself. Much more effective
---
The bpc for that is substantially easier to get compared to the revenant ( though you probably know) the mineral cost is where the money is
---
just a random example of a fight I was myself (so I got the times right at least)

Notice the difference in 10 billion, that [br.inyour.space](https://br.inyour.space) is missing. date/time are identical. I have no idea what exactly is wrong. but 10bn in a 30bn fight is no peanuts. But at least it seems to "forget" random kills, not favouring a specific side.
---
No we are not working together with the (old) developer of o.smium. But we took a look at PyFa for the statistics so its a bit familiar.
---
Don't forget Legion that was between DUST and Nova, that was presumably a failure and they started over from scratch AGAIN, hence Nova.  The other guy mentions the engine is fine, but I disagree; if they restarted again and are using the same engine, when it actually comes to market in 5 years the engine will be a decade out of date compared to other current shooters at that time.
---
The meme already existed when I started playing 10 years ago.
---
They were limited in scope, that was a main problem yes, but they were ALSO badly executed. 
---
DUST's actual engine was shit and gameplay was sketchy at best, if it wasn't for tons of EVE nerds trying to get it to succeed it would have never taken off with that gameplay.
---
Valkyrie was a glorified tech demo with next to no depth, after you beat the campaign in 2 hours it was incredibly dull, it had nothing to do with the platform.  That should be obvious when they released it to flatscreens and it still had 0 playerbase.
---
Sparq is harder to explain; yes, it was limited by hardware, but it was a VR gimmick at its core.  The game itself would be shit if not for the VR component, so its not really a solid idea outside of that niche anyway.
---
Goddamnit Squishy, these are great.

Keep em coming!

Decent but don't oversaturate yourself with these videos. Too much of a good thing can be bad :P

Working as intended.

I had no problems so far.
---
is there an eve trading/sales sub?
---
Do the directions take you directly to the crash site?
---
What about exploration? You can easily make 100+ mil an hour in sansha space and it isn’t too boring either. It’s also nice because wherever you live, jump cloning to Jita, flying your astero to catch and then coming back with half a bil is pretty easy
---
BRAVE has no activity requirements, play when you can, having fun is more important.
---
Lol this is myth show me a video of 1 hour of scanning where you find more then 20 mill I bet you can’t
---
Ive yet to get tired of MLG parodies. Keep em coming.
---
the meta show is literally just a bunch of retards, often one fat and one skinny retard, that screams lies so retarded that its not even believable
---
lol k
---
All null groups are bad except the one you are in.
---
All capitals are broken, unless you fly them, then they have been nerfed too much.
---
Rorqs are killing the game with how much they mine, unless you are a miner then they are useless.
---
Hi sec is for pussies, unless you are fighting there.
---
The game is dying, except for the increased number of players.
---
So probably about the same as when you played
---
Well, look up some guy called raistt223 on twitch, he streams exploration for some reason, and it’s incredibly boring to watch, but he makes much more than that in a shitfit heron with alpha skills. 
---
With a combat astero you can scan much faster, push off or kill and loot any competition, and have much better success actually hacking the cans.
---
Ah, I see nothing has changed
---
Keep em coming squish
---
who are all these people and why arent they dead yet
---
that's awesome, thanks for updating it!
---
For the last industrial I needed to craft a ship. I just needed to get the resources and craft it with the blueprint.
---
Warp corp stabs popular with newbies but not with experience pilots. They consume lots of fitting room, severely reduce your targeting speed, and fill up slots that could be filled with better modules.
---
We see this with newbie explorers. Any T1 exploration frigate's probably fitted with one or two WCS. It takes the pilot longer to target each can, which reduces his efficiency, and every hunter's going to bring at least 3 points regardless. If he fit nanos and istabs and paid attention, he could work faster, and he'd be long gone before the hunter could get a target lock.
---
And T1 haulers. Sometimes they fit so many stabs that they've barely got any tank left and can easily be one-shotted.
---
sup
---
Why? It's a news story. It should have the facts.
---
Most mullsec theses days is little to no requirments. Most are usually have you participateted this month? Good. Lol. Yes one fleet is usually enough.
---
Maybe but most of the time it takes a hour to find one good relic site lots of crap data and gas nodes out there....
---
I am curious how you are fitting an astero to be a combat and pvp ship.
---
I agree they need to add in a skill grind along with the time if I use x skill I should get some points.
---
What does it do?
---
It lbs possible with the amount of time investment that is required to understand the game.
---
What do you mean by sub?
---
65k overheated ehp on my nereus says f-u multiboxing tonados.
---
thank you very much!
---
Awesome video guys! &lt;3
---
Great video, smooth and eminently watchable
---
what kind of bling ships are you flying though? there are a lot of decent ships you can fly for under 100m isk. that is not too bad for a casual.
---
That's why it's called Little Things. CCP does not currently have the resources or room on the 2019 roadmap (although there is reportedly room on the 2020 roadmap) to do large sweeping changes to Faction Warfare. Therefore the most viable course of action to take right now is siggest little easy things to change that improve overall QOL while not taking much dev resources at all.

Try the forums possibly?
---
I don’t think it should take that much resources to actually make FW relevant, but then again what do I know, I’m not a dev.
---
My point is, people just LP farm and bot in FW, with occasionally a bunch of people practicing solo pvp. I remember when I first started playing few months back, I wanted to learn to pvp and everybody directed me to FW, majority of the FW corps were either dead or had 4-5 people online. First day it took me hours to find my first fight just to die, I went to literally every system in black rise looking for people.
---
infowars have more credibility then the meta show
---
Umm, just do a t2 emission scope rig for hacking, a t1 explosive armor resistance rig for rigs. Mids are cap booster, mwd, relic, and scram. Lows are DDA/DCU/dual rep. Highs should be obvious
---
&gt; s, I have lived in Provi the whole time I have played the game. Good guess!
---
I started out there myself. :)
---
x-files
---
it all makes sense now
---
Fair enough.
---
The originators of the post actually are from Delve but got lost looking for abandoned citadels.
---
I *think* I read something on here the other day about the Potency booster no longer cutting the declined mission penalty to 0.001% (or whatever it was), so that particular method of only running L4 Recon and Cargo wouldn't be viable. Could anybody confirm that?
---
It still works, it shows up as 0.001% but it's actually 0. It's just a display error
---
What I said I paraphrased from developers, or people who have spoken with devs. I'm of the mind that small QOL changes are the way to go until CCP can devote their resources to fixing Faction Warfare on a larger scale.
---
In any case, you may have also joined at a bad time (and right now is actually a bad time if we're being honest), but some of the largest, longest lasting, and most destructive engagements in EVE happened under current mechanics in Faction Warfare. 
---
Current FW mechanics aren't necessarily bad, although some are outright bad indeed, they are just outdated and need to get with the times.

Always send yourself an eve mail with it linked

I thought so too, but I also realized that the average goon isn't going to put in the effort to be able to accomplish this anyway.

I’m gonna slap this mf upvote on the table. Lmao, this post is the whole of Eve in a nutshell.
---
&gt;I'm really kind of annoyed [Brisc in interview]
---
Well, I'm annoyed that for the last week all that's been talked about is your stupidity and the shitty (although hilarious) way you've tried to cover it up, so I guess it evens out?
---
&gt; If you wanted to be a super-vigilant NDA kommisar about it, you could yell that that was "abusing the NDA", but the scale of the action matters.
---
What? I can't believe that you casually admit to taking CSM insider info for and applying it for personal profit. wtf is happening in Init?
---
l've lost interest in the original post now its all about the triggered raged at me and the meta show #yolo
---
You’re probably right about me joining at a bad time, but I’m probably not alone either. I was excited about the idea of FW at first, went to a few plexes ended up making about 200mil isk worth of points, got into about 3-4 fights and got bored, never went back again.
---
For something to be fun, it needs to be engaging, to give you a reason to do that one activity..
---
Anyway, I wasn’t trying to argue against your statement, but in my opinion they’re better if either not wasting time on this or fix it completely.
---
Advice appears irrelevant to original comment

Literally overjoyed to see this, ive been forced to use https://eveeye.com for ages despite Dotlan being by far the best Eve map site simply because Dotlan didnt track your current location.

Awesome addon
---
Caldari specific, the Datacores are a very good bulk sell. Caldari drones are pretty good too but they are just as a pain as ammunition to transport.
---
ye seems to work for you. Nevertheless, you showing me that br.inyour.space that it worked one time properly. And I show you that it didn't work another time, still gives me right, that it is broken.
---
It might not always give broken results, but it's obviously broken. Otherwise it wouldn't be wrong in my battle example. (Also I took a random battle, not one I knew it was giving wrong results)
---
Understand me right, I don't just wonna be correct. I would love to have br.inyour.space working again reliably. If you think you know what I do wrong, pls tell me. fleetcom.space looks awful, I want away from it;)
---
&gt; There is not a good movement to the end game for a casual gamer. 
---
yes there is.
---
passive income to plex your account each month via PI, trading, reactions etc.
---
then SRP for your pvp losses.
---
&gt; I would expect this to be bannable tbh, 
---
Good job you weren't involved in the CSM 5 years ago when I was literally talking about doing this with the devs in the CSM channel. And no, telling you what I said about personal activity isn't breaking the NDA either, before you run around sperging about that too.
---
If I'd bought like 1000 BPOs and started researching them all, it probably would have been bannable. Or warnable, anyway; not all infractions are dealt with by bans. For example, I inadvertently said something quite early on, during the navy faction BS rework IIRC which could have given people a hint on something or other (I forget exactly what). Fozzie caught it, DM'd me and said "hey be careful what you say, I know you didn't mean to give anything away but if the wrong person they that they could maybe work something out about xyx" (again, I forget exactly what it was, possibly something to do with LP). Again, scale, intent and advantage matter. As the infraction was trivial, obviously unintended and did not gain me any advantage, a discrete chat was all that was needed, and I was more careful in future.
---
People who react like you, trying to make out that there can only be the death sentence for any crime, are exactly the reason that CSMs are reluctant to talk to the players after being elected. All you really care about is the drama, and that's super toxic to people who are trying to get stuff done.
---
Will keep that in mind. Many thanks!

no.

Maybe the part about drugs is real, don't know, I don't use ships worthy enough to get whatever drawbacks they can give. But the part of just blinging the hell out of a pirate frigate just to kill a bunch of T1 frigates isn't the best idea, even more to give out to a newbie that can't fly a Breacher straight.

So, nice troll.

Still think its capital online personally.
---
No, I totally agree with you, they don't OWE us anything, however I think it is in their best interest to release that information. It will put a lot of their customers' minds at ease to be able to actually see they handled this properly. Bans are frequently not a black and white solution in any game, even more so in eve, and I would be remiss if I said I completely trust CCP to do what is good for this game all the time. NDA being NDA, though, you're probably right and we won't see any of that shit for years, if at all.
---
The timing on this couldn't be better... see future post
---
Small QOL changes are often way more important than huge overhauls. If CCP only ever did large releases and never did bug fixes or QOL changes, the game would be in a much worse state. As it is,  I have a lot of respect for CCP because they understand that fixing bugs and making life easier for players is just as important as new content or overhauling old content.
---
ITT: guy scrambled kiki before the mwd pulse made him move out of range and 30s after the guy is dead even with a 480 ehp/s tank.

Iirc tiericide made the ferox, cyclone, and prophecy not useless and I think dropped a missile slot off the drake and dropped it's resistance bonus from 5% per level to 4% but it was mostly the buffs to other ships that resonated.

It bothers me how the ,s and .s are swapped for number values

So you have to join a big Corp.

Oh no. That evil mwd doing it's job an propelling you in the direction you're facing? This is purely pilot error. Not the Kiks, your ship, or the mwd's fault.
---
well, now you can sell dromis to those who don't have any!
---
Nah that makes too much sense.
---
should be the same everywhere. If not its a visual bug. Since EVE uses ","-values we also do.
---
“CCP there’s a counter to the thing I’m currently flying and can’t handle it. Pls nerf. Thx”
---
OP isn't us. You've been memed.
---
Awesome stuff buddy. I really love it when people make fanart like this. This sub could use more positive stuff like this tbh :)
---
Thats not the problem, every kiting ship do this. The problem is when the ship has speed, range and something like +400 dps. Let the tryhard move to 3k speed and apply from +20km if they want to but nerf the dps to something more reasonable.
---
Carriers need sebos now for safe ratting - especially when they are botting
---
They're not being inflated, there's a much higher demand now that NSAs got nerfed
---
What do you expect when CCP nerfs carriers causing all them to switch from using NSA to dual sensor boosters.
---
Idk, I think they use rapid lights that are terrible at applying to small ships v0v
---
when crabs going change NSA :D
---
"Furry" Warriors
---
TBQH, I completely forgot about the NSA changes. Makes way more sense now
---
Max cycle on my Kiki is more like 600dps

looks like good times

You're a fucking retard, the kiki is outranged by shit tons of ships, because your shit was set up to be a scram brawler you got murdered by a kiting ship.

Literally any of them could have done this to your stupid ass.

*looks at the 300 i bought a week ago*

you can buy them for hte new price.  pray i don't alter the deal further.

I make comments about Xenurias mental health all the time, and I've never met the guy.
---
The price is what the market will Bear.
---
You missed Ishtar Online.
---
The fact that you asked the devs, means my assumption that this wasn't allowed aka bannable isn't completely unfounded, you considered this to be on the edge enough to ask the devs hey can I do this.
---
The fact that said yes leads me to have more of an issue with CCP for allowing this in the first place then with the CSM (aka its CCP that grants the advantage). 
---
as for me being evil and out to ruin the CSM and being super toxic etc, honestly, it's just hilarious like seriously consider if you might be slightly overreacting.
---
https://imgur.com/YdCkaiH
---
It could mean anything really. I am sure there was something but if its an NDA violation and bannable is a whole different question. As far as i know CCP still didn't tell the banned people what the actual charges are so i dont know if playing reddit investigator is useful to anybody at this point. Sister Bliss said he will reveal what exactly happened in a few week no matter what so lets be patient.
---
wrong I am a Nice Person
---
Don’t get eve on. Steam. Then every-time you play you log onto steam. 
---
I’m 100% Sure Exooki did and Tiny checks when he logs on to know when the TDSIN ping is out.
---
You don't learn me something. But when a kiting ship got his mwd pulse make him out of scram range you know u'll die. But when you're in a tanky cruiser you can hope to die slowly so your friends can come save your ass, or have time to plan a slingshot or load more appropriate ammo. Like when it's a garmur/orthrus.  
---
But thats not valable when you are being orbited by a solo elite kikimora pilot clicking space: you die in 30s from his perfectly applied 500dps while orbiting you at 30km. This shit is jack of all trades, master of all.
---
Yeah and cynabal online was never a thing.
---
&gt; For example, I inadvertently said something quite early on, during the navy faction BS rework IIRC which could have given people a hint on something or other (I forget exactly what). Fozzie or maybe Rise? One of the devs, anyway caught it, DM'd me and said "hey be careful what you say, I know you didn't mean to give anything away but if the wrong person they that they could maybe work something out about xyx" (again, I forget exactly what it was, possibly something to do with LP).
---
Yes, you made a mistake, there was no reason for you to get banned over something like that. You spoke inadvertently with no intent to break the NDA.
---
&gt; For instance when I was on the CSM, I was told about the Crius changes (no more remote research), and promptly researched up some BPOs that I owned but hadn't bothered doing anything with. 
---
You were given insider information and intentionally used it to do something. You can attempt to justify it however you want, but you performed an action that violated the NDA.
---
&gt;If I'd bought like 1000 BPOs and started researching them all, it probably would have been bannable. Or warnable, anyway; not all infractions are dealt with by bans. 
---
Okay, where's the line then? What if you had bought 100 BPOs? or 5 BPOs? Or 20,000 BPOs? Should there be a grey area? The blurrier the lines, the more likely someone is going to get pissed off when someone gets away with something.
---
Sure, in things like this, scale can matter.
---
Jin'taan is relevant again?
---
I have, but these are definitely the exception. Probably because they have actual unironic sustenance.
---
Sentient sebos were historically lower than the equivalent fed navy or shadow serpentis... I won't begin to speculate on why a module from the drone regions would be significantly lower than a module from serpentis space (fed navy can be bought with lp which kind pegs its price (and the max for the others) at about 130 mill)
---
Why are you whining
---
what i want from evernus is for it to be able to use jita prices as a base of calculating the prices im seeding in my random stagin in null
---
Yeah I'd definitely say I'm Eve middle class, I make maybe 300-500m/wk on average from highsec combat sites. I've made over 1.5b in a week once but that was just all loot fairy loving me. It's enough to cover my costs and if I wanted to plex my account I probably could but I don't really feel like spending everything I make a month just to keep playing.
---
cause sentient ones drop from scannable combat sites which are very common and easy to run in a t3c. the other 2 are much more difficult to get.
---
Wish it was true...
---
If you want to petition CCP to try and get me BANNED!!!1111 for gaining the huge terrible gamebreaking advantage of researching some BPOs I already owned in a station rather than in a POS, go for it. I'm sure they'll take you super seriously, even though I was totally open about what I was doing and no one considered it a problem at the time. 
---
I mean this is really important stuff here, and you certainly won't make a fool of yourself or waste a GM's time.
---
&gt;Okay, where's the line then? What if you had bought 100 BPOs? or 5 BPOs? Or 20,000 BPOs? Should there be a grey area? The blurrier the lines, the more likely someone is going to get pissed off when someone gets away with something.
---
Is littering a capital offence in your country? Where's the line between dropping a crip packet and tipping 30,000 litres of dioxin into a reservoir? The blurrier the lines, the more likely someone is going to get pissed off when someone gets away with something!
---
Literally whose voices? Do you know any of the csm members who reported it or any of the people at ccp? I mean there are good odds that there were goons in that group who reported it to ccp in the first place.
---
Second of all, you literally have zero idea what the thing they manipulated was. Let alone how successful they were at it. And how successful they were doesn't matter.
---
Whose voices and whose rumors are you basing that off of? Are they magic or ccp employees? Cause they are just guessing.
---
Brisc broke a nda, that is a legal contract that can have serious consequences. End of story. You can take off the tin foil hat.
---
bocsh :thonk:
---
I didn't *ask* the devs, I mentioned it. Something along the lines of "wow the research interface really does suck, I just started researching a rack of BPOs now and by the time I got all 10 jobs going I wanted to never do it again"
---
The first one was the best EVE video I've seen in years.  Hyped for this one.
---
This is incredible. Would you ever do a commission?
---
again?
---
Any tips for using Dotlan?
---
You are getting downvote for your post being stupid.  Since in all fairness its stupid.
---
If you had argued that the kiki tracking is stupidly good... and that is completely wrecks all other frigates 1v1... either kitey or brawly; I would 100% agree with you.  The ship needs to be addressed.
---
However, still think other things are far more important that CCP need to address... &lt;insert complaints about FAX, cynos, instant local, dromis etc etc&gt;.
---
Imagine getting your brain microwaved by commissars
---
I like the only comment there, at the time of me reading it a minute ago, that says "The only way to win eve, is to not play it". So true.
---
I believe this is a lore violation Lol. but it looks really cool!
---
So the whole issue here is that we don't know if this was direct NDA breach (like one guy saying other **buy this**) or it was something way more indirect like CSM member asking a skilled and active FC - **so what in your opinion is best way we can improve capital missile application**
---
Jesus you are retarded.
---
You are a literal retard. Fuck off with you "breaking the rules slightly isn't breaking the rules!!" bullshit and come back when you've managed to get over your mental handicap.

Yeah cos no one in GMVA ever runs L4s, sure
---
The problem with the kikimora has nothing to do with whatever garbage you're stating and more to do with the fact that you can't get under a gun that hits out to ridiculous ranges
---
An expansion featuring a Terra/Earth and the surrounding systems would be pretty fun IMO. Haven't gotten up to speed on my EVE lore though to know how ridiculous that would or would not be

Fantastic guide. Thank you!
---
Though am I missing something, or does the derived standings issue mean that you can't be on the good side of all the pirate and empire factions at the same time?
---
Most of the time PvE isn't fighting diamond rats. Belt rats and anom rats lack logi and the intelligent spawns of the diamond rats. There is a reason you can run a 10/10 in a solo T3.
---
Sorry for taking up time you wanted to spend writting essays about raging autists

You only need to devote a single Mid slot to a Relic Analyzer for hacking. Past that, probe/covops, prop/scram/cap booster, DCU/Rep/Ancil/\[either DDA or EANM to taste\], rigs explosive/nanopump/accel. Rely on base skills (and not screwing up) for scan strength and hacking.
---
If you want to be supermaximumtryhard though, then bling the prop, scram, and rep, swap the Relic for a Zeugma Integrated Analyzer, and then run either Virtue \[scan probe strength\] or Asklepian \[armor reps / immortality\] implants, and a Blackglass in slot 9. Granted at this point you're flying a billion ISK worth of exploration frigate, but i mean come on Zeugma+Blackglass is basically cheat mode hacking, you can headshot any hostile node in your path.
---
If you don't even want to hack at all and you're purely going hunting, then swap the Relic for either a SiBo (faster locks/resist EC-300s) or a second scram (because fuck you mister 4-warp-core-stab astero/magnate).
---
The Astero doesn't have the damage output of most other PVP frigates, but it's damn immortal in frigate 1v1s (especially against exploration frigates who have sacrificed combat for scan strength) and with the Drone HP Bonus you're not going to get defanged quickly, if at all (and you can pull/launch drones as they get hit).

You dindn’t misunderstood it, but its a flaw at our end. My thought was that someone would search for a certain ship while the reality was way different. We will change the behavior in a future release.

Well they kinda have in an indirect way; grind ISK, buy injectors.
---
Please explain
---
Contrary to popular belief, a very large portion of the Imperium do have basic reasoning skills, and since there has been basically no details released, all we have to go on is the word of CCP vs the word of a politician. Wonder who would be more likely to be lying?

It's a capsuleer allience or corporation force actually FYI.

Sometimes, but just by virtue of having big names in the scene on all the time there is actually a lot of information that is relevant and correct. A lot of the time it is soaked in bias, but frequently there is contrasting opinions from guests, so it becomes really like a forum for some of the most experienced players in the game. That in and of itself doesn't make it always correct, obviously there have been some really dumb stuff on there, but it can be decent a lot of the time too.

i Wish you good frags and much fun when you get it

Yep I definitely agree, sure sometimes that's a real thing but definitely not the norm and not something you can expect every player to do.
---
From the book that came with the original EvE box:
---
"It's 7700 AD and the human race has been colonizing their galaxy for 4000 years. It seems like the Golden Age of space faring is never going to end. Then a massive natural wormhole is discovered, leading to an unknown sector of the universe.
---
This portal held endless possibilities of a new beginning for civilization and was hence dubbed "EVE." Lured by the promise of free settlements, entrepreneurs and independent organizations poured through the wormhole to stake their claims in this new land.
---
Scientists warned that the wormhole would close again within a few decades. Racing against time, construction began on a man-made portal to allow safe passage between the home system and EVE.
---
Suddenly, the scientists' worst fears were realized and the wormhole closed. Nonetheless, construction continued and the gates of EVE opened and operated perfectly for seven decades. Disaster struck once again. An unexplained phenomenon engulfed the Gates of EVE, rendering them inoperable. Restoration efforts proved futile due to the malevolent magnetic storm perpetually surrounding the gates. The results were swift and devastating. The fledgling settlements found themselves cut off from the old world, on which they were still heavily dependent.
---
Lack of oxygen, water and food had a catastrophic effect on the colonies and only the strongest managed to survive and reproduce. Scientific knowledge and high-tech industry dwindled with each generation. Tools and materials once take for granted diminished and disappeared.
---
Of the surviving colonies, several small, independent factions and states were formed. For thousands of years, these scattered groups lived and grew in isolation from each other. Environmental differences led to evolutionary changes, making each group distinct in appearance and behavior. Ultimately five of these colonies emerged to become the major empires that hold the balance of power in the world of EVE today."
---
So it's possible, but we have no way of getting back to them in New Eden. That leaves them having advanced enough to find us... if they even care anymore. After thousands of years we might not recognize them anymore.
---

Imagine being so retarded that you bring up a man first elected in 2010 (and left corp in late 2011) in the hopes that him having been in your alt alliance (or is INIT mercs real INIT suddenly) would have any relevance to the incompetence and corruption of your leadership and CSM candidates in 2019.
---
They are the 3rd largest alliance in terms of population, behind only goonswarm and pandemic horde. That's probably the biggest factor of all.
---
What level of ded site admits battleships?
---
Well I shouldn't, yes. But I'd like a blockade runner someday and the Obelisk I bought will have a skills match in less than 4 days now.

Too far from Jita... but I just found my old account from 2006 last week and was pleasantly surprised that all 3 chars are Caldari and one lives in The Forge already! Maybe some opportunities there if I transfer PLEX or isk from my mains.

So I haven't been playing the game for a bit, logged in today and messed around with exploration. I ended up in a wormhole data site and as soon as I warped in the game stopped responding for about a minute then suddenly I was in structure with several rats shooting me. I managed to get out but was seriously spooked in the process.
---
Is this a thing now or just my internet shitting out ? I'm just asking because this is probably the first time this has happened to me in years of playing eve.
---
No u

Goof idea. I will try it for tomorrow :) maybe inside of an asteroid field..or smthng

Sorry, the nasa only gave this picture in vertical :(

I'm really enjoying this btw; the more you get angry at the realisation that you're not going get me banned for the super cereal CRIME!!!!, the happier I am. 
---
Out of interest, and I realise you might not want to say as you've not troubled to pick a flair, which of the various alliances that we've dicked over the years are you in? This level of frustrated venom reminds me of the old-school -A- grrr INIT, but your phrasing and inability to come up with any epithet other than "retarded" inclines me to suspect PanFam. Horde Vanguard? Anyway, it's just idle curiousity. Carry on.
---
They are only relevant on Reddit.
---
thankyou
---
Wasn't there a fight in the sotiyo system? Someone said that was where INIT were yesterday when the supers died.
---
Its hard to do solo nullsec roams with low SP.
---
If you really want to get a foothold of PVP and matchups and decision making you should just fit a bunch of different T1 frigates and just throw yourself at FW.
---
Once you have good skills for AFs or cruisers you can try your hand at null roaming.
---
For FW the activity is really timezone dependant. Prime USTZ is usually most active.
---

Or maybe it could be that everything you say is just retarded? You actually brought up someone who's been irrelevant for years just because at one point he was blue to you, because you just had nothing else left to say.
---
&gt;alliances that we've dicked
---
Well there are two issues with that one. The first would be that really a fair bit of your "dicking" involved the rest of your coalition, not just you special snowflakes. The other would be that you seem to believe if someone has a special blue square next to their name it is literally impossible for them to think of your alliance as a raging dumpster fire.
---
lol dino rawr xD

Don't really have much of a choice if you want to go between Jita and Amarr. It's Niarja, Uedama or low-sec.

---
It's because people generally hate it when you tell them what to do and will be contrarians, so when they see "Test Alliance Please Ignore" they refuse to honor the "Please Ignore" bit.  Thus TEST went from being a group of people who just wanted to be left alone to somehow being one of the most influential alliances in the game.
---
Nah but as a serious response, they've done a lot of expanding over the last few years and when I stopped playing about 2 or 3 years ago there was a big enough push to get everyone in to supercapitals that I was seriously considering it myself because the way they were going about it would've been affordable for me.  They're also friendly people who are fun to play with, and have a lot of stuff to do generally speaking so you're never really going to be bored flying with them.  Of course, this is true of any big alliance, but that's probably one of the reasons the big alliances stay big.  But that's where it would come from.  They have a lot of people that like to play the game and a lot of stuff to do it with.
---
Give us nicer leaks, no one cares about renter "drama"
---
Why is that the only alliance you have questions about?
---
[Correct Sotiyo BR](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001593/201904132000/), for context. Make of it what you will.

Then they wonder how Frat has more titans than them.

They can put the third highest amount of bodies in a fleet, which in this current day of the game, more numbers **usually** means you win.

But where is teh erebus?

yeah can we talk about init

Isn't reddit their website tho? (troll response)
---
Don’t know, don’t keep up with youtube cartoons. Probably anime.
---
Look forward to the rest
---
I play mostly solo.
---
Pretty cool, maybe we'll run into a race like the triglavians who have at some point had contact with the advanced humans. They could revere them as gods or something
---
Seems like they’ve done more feeding them lately than anything else
---
We also react to stuff, sometimes.
---
I mean, this feels like a bait thread, but at this point, TEST is one of the older alliances that still owns sov in any meaningful portion. They have a few personnel who also have their own cults of personality around them from their exploits before TEST (despite my personal opinion of at least one of them). TEST hasn't done much of note the last few years; but in fairness, most alliances in the game haven't done much of note the last few years. It's basically been "Mine as much as you can to build as many supers as you can" for most sov null groups or "Let's do a proxy war in a region that doesn't matter because we don't want to commit". There have been several "wars" but even the lines on the maps didn't shift much for most of the "relevant" alliances, except obviously groups like Skill Urself, who came from a single corporation in Re-forged, to being a pretty formidable power today and owning a pretty large swathe of rental space. Even then, all that actually happened was paper tigers died (or went to live in Pure Blind) and the ticker on Dotlan changed.
---
So, to answer your original question. TEST is relevant today because of their size, the notoriety (or infamy) of several key members, the amount of space they hold, and because they've been involved in several continuous conflicts. Couple that with the fact that people love to hate PGL, (he was easily the most annoying person at Eve Vegas) and PGL mostly just loves to hear himself talk, and you've got your answer.
---
What do you think your Mandarin would do to his?
---
There are theories that the Triglavians are Milky Way galaxy humans. It's been thousands of years, we might not recognize them, they might not recognize us. They may have even forgot we existed and what happened to us.
---
they are the second most powerful member of the imperium
---
ITT a lot of Americans that are too dumb to imagine that not everyone in the world speaks English.
---
Where did you get the models?
---
i guess they are renters,and to who they pay for rent should protect their "resort" of income...ofc i am wrong and everyone will prove it in reply :D
---
Whoooosh
---
i mean to be fair you do have make much more significant fitting choices, versus a no-brainer high slot
---
If we weren't relevant, people wouldn't be spitting out the "lE tApI sUcKs eXcSsDeE" rhetoric constantly.
---
Whether intentionally or not, Test has been a main content driver within the last few years and no narrative can spin that.
---
Taking a shit on company time literally has more economic impact than researching some BPOs you already own in a game with a 2b Isk to $20 conversion rate. Youre only saying this because taking a shit on company time is relatable and accessible to you
---
I don't fly the ships involved so I honestly can't speak to the issue. However - you're getting down voted because you didn't present much more than a rant. Unsupported arguments come across as nothing more than rhetorical rants.
---
As all things should be
---
TEST..relevant..since when?
---
a subreddit
---
Imagine thinking that breaking rules slightly isn't still breaking them. You can argue the effects all you want, the act is the same, so trying to deny it just goes to show how useless INIT (elite alliance btw) are in tyool 2019
---
Why do armor repairers regenerate so much less HP than shield boosters? It doesn’t seem like armor has a much better resist profile—in fact, from what I can see, armor resist modules offer inferior bonuses to their shield counterparts. How do people armor tank ships?
---
yeah, already on there...just wanted to know if there was a sub as well
---
Do you know those big, powerful and prestigious alliances that have existed throughout EVE's history? They always have a group of people that complain and are useless, in TEST it's where they all end up, huddling around like sheep for warmth in the cold void of space. tl;dr TEST is the punching bag of EVE that everyone likes to shoot because dinosaurs should remain extinct

That's not true.  
---
TEST has, with varying degrees help evict goons, gotten evicted, moved and invaded a new regions, started a coalition, was involved in most massive super cap fights, done more deployments than most and managed to stay at the centre of conflict in an other boring political landscape.  
---
Test had more wars than most of the last few years and even survived a massive coalition war to evict them. These things are rare.

Pandemic Horde has zero requirements.  Only be online once every 9-12 months if you do get booted for being away, just reapply and will be invited back within 24 hours. We have two or three moons per day available to everyone and more available to op-sec groups.

Seems like LZHK/QUIET could have killed the sotiyo by themselfes (SkillU seems to not interact with them in combat) but they batphoned goons (and INIT) who fed a sotiyo worth of ships to whore on the km and couldn't defend their supers at home. 
---
So LZHK/QUIET are just baiting for SkillU to farm Goons?

Why are they bad for burners?

Because mid slots tend to have more different uses than lows (which are primarily more passive stat boosts/changes), so having a tank that exclusively takes up low slots gives you room for all kinds of fun and exciting ewar and CC gear

Well, given that he has an entire proper fitting in his cargo hold, I'd guess it's someone who was trying to catch up in a travel fit and got caught/just forgot to refit from his travel fit before the fleet.
---
I'm all for multiculturalism, but he's trying to talk trash, not deliver a PSA. 
---
The pic is spicy, but let's not whiteknight someone who's talking shit while being barely-comprehensible.

You'd warped to a sleeper data site, which is protected by rats. Avoid hacking sites that say "unsecured" or "forgotten". The lag was probably just a network hiccup.

This is pretty sad state though, he won't even comment if it's even been talked about.
---
Oh yeah I'm qware of the rats, the lag and suddenly being at 90% structure from nowhere is what worried me more lol.
---
5/10 and above for DEDs. Unrated might vary?
---
Another thing is that armor resists can be completely cap-independent, whereas generally a shield tanked ship is in trouble once neuted out.
---
refit for travel, check what was in the cargo.
---
big fun btw, really like your torpedo bs vids
---
Have I ever told you the tragedy of Darth Rubal the Loose-lipped?
---
K.
---
Wormhole rats are particularly strong. T1 explorer frigs don't stand a chance, so even a few seconds of inactivity could mean trouble. That's probably how you ended up so close to death.
---
So armor tanking, when not considering external factors, is objectively worse than shield tanking?
---
A "Few years" to me means within the last 2 years. Half the stuff you listed doesn't fall into that. They were "invaded" though, that didn't go far at all, and was never going to once GSF got involved. To pretend the opposite true is a pure delusion. I even said that TEST has been in continuity of war for quite a while, though to call any of them existentially threatening would be quite the oversell.
---
I wasn't shitting on TEST, if anything I was saying they were more proactive than the norm. The average nullsec alliance hasn't done anything of note (from a macro point of view, not some one-off supercap camp or fight). 
---
You basically just regurgitated my entire post (with slightly more detail) but instead of being unbiased, you were defensive for some reason.
---
I thought it was the other way around—a neuted shield tank will still have passive regen, but armor has no equivalent way of regenerating hp without cap. Or are you just talking about resist modules? Both shield and armor have passive resist modules, and I believe the shield ones offer better bonuses too.
---
was thinking about forming, capqu got there first and seemed to have things handled in short order
---
Outside an exploration site or an abyssal area would be glorious!
---
Opsec broken, counter intelligence failed
---
a single glance at the BR for the sotiyo system will tell you very quickly why it wasn't posted

Not 100% sure but I think the apostrophe is correct as apostrophes denote possession.    
---
I could be wrong and I am not looking it up.
---
Error: can't see tengu fleets
---
Direct? Indirect? There’s no distinction. It’s a breach or its not. Its a fucking written contract, no need of mental gymnastics on how to break it without getting banned, you break it or not. And this idiots did, so they got banned.
---
And on top of that it’s pretty easy to get out played by another destroyer in a kiki as they have fuckall tank
---
That STOP RECORDING at the end tho

Is Serenity still active? The [sov.space](https://sov.space) maps for Serenity haven't updated in a while and eve-offline [shows](https://eve-offline.net/?server=serenity) that it's pretty dead (pressumably after the takeover of Serenity by CCP). Did I miss something? Or did just all the Serenity players moved to TQ?
---
All planned at the bachelorette party.

Friend, there are ways to get free Reddit Karma, and there are ways to FARM free reddit Karma.  I'm not talking about your backyard garden of cucumbers and tomato's that you start watering every day with the singular focus of a say Lennie Small, only to move onto the next thing as does /r/eve on a daily/weekly basis in which case your garden withers and dies faster than this entire subs attention span.   What I'm talking about here will make you the  George Milton of Karma farming. It's a slow process, but you'll get over in the end.
---
What you really need to do next time you post this content is ask yourself the real questions such as
---
"What did  Penny Fera know about this 3 years  ago, and why did he quit eve to play World of Warcraft when he found out".  You'll be about as talented as a writer for PC Gamer at this point. 
---
If you want to know more, buy my book. I'm telling it in game for 10m isk.  Good luck on your farming!
---
TBH, its the word of someone accused of being breaking an NDA ( and then went “Ah, now I see what could have been...” and someone that cant comment because they can fucking read their contracts and follow their own rules. Its not that hard to suspect who is telling the truth here.

Everyone is holier than thou until they themselves are put in the same situation. It's quite popular to be in a screeching righteous mob, isn't it?
---
Came here to say this exact thing. Have an upvote
---
&gt; 1. Which category from the Bartles Taxonomy test did you align the most with?
---
what the fuck is this
---
I was wondering how long before you retards had to fall back on the old "ohhhh but what if you were someone who linked their rl to their eve and then fucked up"
---
Oh cool, can we get you to give the same spiel to the tapi crowd they next time they post their broken wall of English and Mandarin about Tiananmen Square then?
---
It says "xenuria is a terrible person"
---
So buy something else that fits RLML. Tengu, Cerb, there are many options other than cry that your ship got countered by another ship.
---
Malcanis I'd suggest you take some advice before commenting too much on matters from your term since you're pretty close to the watershed (i.e. if your restrictive covenant period of (5 years?) kicked in from the date of the end of your term, then you are still under NDA for another few weeks).
---
That set aside, conventional NDA's are set out to make it explicitly clear that you are forbidden from using proprietary and confidential information for any purpose except the purpose defined. Most standard commercial NDAs will also feature a clause specifically prohibiting profiting from the confidential information as well.
---
It sounds very much like you just admitted to breaching your NDA, but in your opinion that's perfectly okay, because it wasn't a big breach, and no one got hurt because of it (not even going to touch on the gaining an unfair advantage with information not available to other players point).
---
great music choice and nice cut ins of comms.
---
(ospery navy issue)
---
So is the guide specifically talking about Diamond rats? It only has the diamond symbol in the titles not in the actual paragraphs
---
yes
---
These tears have inspired me to train into a Kiki.  
---
CCPls hold off on da nerf so I can taste these sweet and salty tears.
---
Are they back?
---
Oh gimmie hell yeah.
---
No
---
thanks papa
---
Took both tests. Many of those questions made little to no sense, and I'd be impressed if you gathered any ammount of data from them.
---
I hope for your sake that your paper does well, but it seems very shallow, so I can't expect it to be useful to understanding EVE players.
---
Been waiting 14 years to see Earth. It'll never happen.
---
Idk at least he's backing up his shit talk, more than I can say for some
---
You need to do that test (copy-paste link in a new window) to answer the first 2 questions. In total it took me 5 minutes. If you can get past the name and weird questions it's not difficult.
---
Reeeee
---
You're right, because a politician buying 'a few' shares in a company they know is about to get a massive tax cut isn't at all corruption you massive bellend.
---
VrrrrooOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMmmmm
---
fuck off with these elite trig hacker fleets
---
like that damn downvote arrow I keep spamming on you
---
Spod, not even once
---
lol
---
thanks, but I don't need help trading :D, I meant for actually posting sale/buy ads and such.
---
thanks for the info, that's what I was thinking, just wanted to make sure.
---
Dude omg you are worse than hydex, wtf dude you don't admit that omg smdh🤦
---
wally dont you have another thread to be smug in at this hour?
---
This is cruel and unusual
---
So, we lost the structure, but still came out even on the BR.
---
On the bright side I just figured out that BOT meant brothers of tangra, EVERY time I’d think somebody is talking about bots...
---
on a related note if you know about OBS recording settings please save me
---
This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their triangle ships before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
It’s spam my friend, these scrubs make money for filling out surveys.. It’s one way of “selling data” 
---
You’ll see plenty of these posts if you check the mmorpg subreddit.
---
Serenity was closed and the players migrated to TQ and formed the Fraternity. alliance, sometimes called the Pandas. It's been controversial since they are an insular culture with a tolerant stance toward botting.
---
Done
---
&gt; they next time they
