I just want to bet on my NFL games again :(
---
So I guess any time you kill an npc with ammo, that’s basically paying real money to open a loot box? And any time you buy anything off the market, that’s RMT?
---
Do you feel a unique ability to allow its spool to be retained and decrease back down over the same time it takes to spool it up would help here?  
---

---
Means it needs that initial set up to get to "Faction Dread" Dps levels, but doesn't mean you have to stay committed to a singular target forever.

0/10 needs more outdated mlg filters.

HyperNet Relay 2 confirmed.
---
But it's the person who initiates the giveaway who spends money? People who participate just spend isk . Right?
---
Again, misuse of language especially to new players who solo = one player, one account, one ship.
---
If you used real money to get that isk. Yes, is 100% RMT. CCP does RMT
---
I’ll never forget your terrible post
---
Of course. How else are you going to have a chance to take down that bot whose gird you used all your skills, dps and tank to rush into if thid feature is not there? Everyone knows that bots use Dscan in ascending distance sorting so they can check whether a ship is in 100kms within their range before auto-warping off in order to maximize service time.
---
if third party is any other player, does that mean technically a friend and I couldn't play a game of chance together and bet in game assets on the outcome? or would we both count as 'first parties'? - and in that case a privately arranged game between two people would be fine, but not two people playing a game operated  by another player? Does this include a game arranged through a service provided by another player - say, a matchmaking service operated by another player?

People know what they’re signing up for. This was the longest he’s been back in years. He’ll come back at some point, raise the sword, and people will flock again. People who haven’t played will resub, and he’ll rebuild the scrappy warband.
---
That's nothing.

Plenty of people foresaw this happening after the PA announcement, but the CCP bootlickers said things would stay the same and not to panic. Aged like milk.

And for fighting everything else.

---
Pretty much yes.
---
It also gives someone the opportunity to own something they otherwise never would have had the opportunity. 
---
Someone wants to sell 100b AT ship. Put up raffle with 100 1b tickets. (These numbers are all made up). You could spend 10b for a 10% chance to own a 100b ship you’d otherwise never be able to own. 
---
Theoretically you could then raffle that same ship off for 100b and make 75b profit. (10b raffle, 5% fee). Thereby spreading wealth opportunity to someone who otherwise may never have 85b ever. Obviously this is gambling for that chance but i know I may spend 1b on a token for that AT ship when I never could ever spend 100b or have the liquid capital too. 
---
I get your point but it doesn’t miss the mark completely. It creates opportunity (through gambling, House always wins) but still there is a chance!
---
I don't live in HS, so there is no irony. What is disgusting is how utter trash thinks it is entitled to zero risk and maximum reward.
---
i highly recommend people to extract all their eve assets with RMT. this game is going down sooner or later
---
I just wanna get into the small gang fights.  Wormhole stuff would be cool.  I'm not super fond of the whole blob thing, and people raging in comms over who responded to their pings and shit.
---
CCP devs: Blink twice if you're being held hostage.
---
Wouldn't it cost like tens of thousands of dollars to get a capital ship on day one? Have people actually ever done that.
---
What region do you normally mine in? Know the belt rats will help determine the best drones to use. Drone interfacing is a good skill to max out as it has a broad damage bonus for drones.

We found a way to beat the odds on Blink and made about 500b over the course of a year and a half. Was a sad day when they shut down
---
So they are responsible for some people being mentally deficient? A d I should be denied features as a result?
---
that's for data site right ? what about relic sites ?
---
What if :
---
CCP has different team to work on different thing, The hypernet team was not the same as the Balance team, Hypernet going to add a lot of revenue for CCP alowing them to have even more budget for other team like the balance team or a recent team known as team talos
---
I find it odd that people would rather blame skill injectors for problems with capitals than capitals themselves.
---
Interesting. But you didn't feel bad when they have introduced mutaplasmids?
---
It reminds me of how Black Desert's auction house used to function combined with the practice of "gifting" pearls if the buyer won the seller's auction, which wasn't guaranteed. Scamming got so bad even Kakao had to disallow pearl gifting altogether.
---
This will not go well, methinks.
---
Same deal, tho it's still worth scanning data sites in C4-C6 space as they have a chance of being a ghost site.
---
5 bucks says "more folders" will be added as a premium feature. It works in other games, so why not here?
---
Same thing! Just do the relic sites with pirate names in them.
---
Yes, they get the fees.
---
No, they wont be less.though if all the tickets don't sell, then everything is unwound.
---
No problem!
---
&gt;I feel like besides hypercores being from the ccp bux store, this isnt even that bad?
---
I mean, that's kind of a core part of it that ruins it.  It's literally just real money gambling.
---
If someone who owns one decides to raffle it, yes.
---
You are strongly advocating for a mechanic that is purely economic, with no impact on the gameplay, and might harm part of the game population just to sink some more real money into CCPs pockets. If I didn't know who you are and what you have done for the game I would be really inclined to believe that you are either not getting why this is gambling (and why gambling is a bad thing) or you are actually making profit yourself. 
---
This isn't a discussion about the invasion or the blackout or something that will affect the gameplay. This is pure gambling introduced into the game. With no real benefit for the game whatsoever. Just plain old "give us your money to gamble and possibly lose everything" mechanic.
---
Go read a book on what gambling addiction is and does to people and then come back and support said mechanics IN A VIDEO GAME knowingly.
---
When were you on the CSM? Congrats man, I had no idea you sat in on those meetings.

Can't even raffle the fun stuff cuz its limited to NPC stations.  The avatar in the screenshot is a blatent CCP lie.
---
Gorski_Car you are an unexpectedly rebarbative oompa loompa!
---
Skill injectors and the Bazaar are absolutely no different.   
---
Infact skill injectors are superior in rewarding the player with just the skills they want. If someone wants to be a capital pilot on day one they can.  If someone wants to pay some isk to skip those not so fun skill trains they can.   
---
Meanwhile Bazaar is = Theres the capital pilot I want, Buy.
---
Nobody gives a shit about RD2 online, so there's that.
---
Okay then. So the only incentive to track down my can would be to destroy it and troll me? The person who destroyed it would get no profit themselves?
---
LOL, after almost all other frigs but ok.
---
I know you're being sarcastic but damn is a raffle really that bad.

Even if we do not realized that you want to declare what is the content for others - you can generate content for yourself with ISK without undocking.

On the tab that use can tick and untick anomalies, cosmic signatures, etc. the end of them is creqte new filter. A window will appeared, type to the search bar wormhole, data site, relic site... And tick it.
---
A praxis was prefared for running c3 combat sites ( heavy missiles and sentry drones) as for a strat, you can clear some gas sites, but it's not ideal imo
---
Multibox XX rorquals maybe?
---
Most likely, however that's a problem with scalability and ease of multiboxing, not the ship itself. Likewise it doesn't print wealth, it prints materials that must be sold.
---
Something to note about industry:  while some enjoy it, it's not an active activity.  Production involves putting input materials and waiting hours/days/weeks for builds to count down per line.  Planetary Interaction involves click hell to set up, then basically just clicking "restart" every couple days and then picking it up at the end of the week/month.  Mining is basically an AFK activity and gives horrible return unless you're multiboxing endgame mining equipment in a nullsec alliance, and even then it's still mostly AFK.

---
Since this got posted in r/MMORPG, i just wanted to confirm is what they are saying is truth. That it's Pearl Abyss fault, that you guys got this new kind of gambling into the game.
---
Let me explain it to you:
---
1.) Player A wants to use the new hyper market so he checks the in-game market for the required currency. 
---
2.) Player B wants ISK so he buys the new hyper currency *for RL money* from CCP and dumps it on the market.
---
3.) Player A buys the required currency from Player B‘s sell order.
---
4.) Player A now uses the new market and the currency (which Player B paid CCP RL money for) is consumed in the process.
---
Now please explain to me how CCP is not earning RL money in the form of the rake.
---
Sure, if you are Player A then you didn‘t pay RL money to CCP directly. Instead, you paid player B ISK so he pays CCP the RL money instead.
---
So no, no contradiction. You just didn‘t think things through properly before posting.
---
&gt; Up to DED 4/10,
---
A proper fitted strat can run DED 5/10, though it takes some time.
---
Have you had anybody that looked at the implications of this under dutch law ( given you currently accept payment from there ) because I suspect you are likely to break the law now lucky for you enforcement is likely years away, but given EA is having change it's games i wanna known if I should consider the well not unlikely scenario where my government bans eve ?
---
Dangerous unknown is just for C4 and C5. C6s are described as deadly unknown space.
---
Thanks for flagging this! Turns out this sound up until now could only be affected by turning down the master slider. I just pushed a fix that should be coming out sometime in December. This will make it so that this warning sound is tied to two sliders: The UI slider in the main volume panel and the "Warning Sounds" slider in the advanced audio settings.
---
All skill injectors did was accelerate the pace as which new and old broken shit was revealed to be broken. Everything from the power imbalance of capitals, to the ludicrous scaling capability of mining multibox fleets.
---
Skill injectors pure and simple allowed people to access the content that others were already accessing. A character can still only fly one ship at a time, in one system at a time. If the game cannot handle characters flying ships, that's a fault of the game itself, not the skills.
---
People should chill the fuck out. If you don't like hypernet, don't use it and don't participate in it. And if you're so outraged that you'll quit the game over this, now you have a more convenient way of selling all your stuff than firesale contracts. Maybe the real reason hypernet got introduced is because it will give CCP easier methods for catching RMTers?
---
Gambling site became the first 100% character the second Skill Point Injectors came out.

I hate having to use it at times, but it's pretty much the safest policy

very true - I totally forgot to go into detail on that, you explained it very well

No.

They're releasing some other changes at the same time. Like the wallet update.

When I started the game in 2004 we hard 3 classes of ships. There where rats in the belts and lvl 1 and lvl 2 agents. The tutorial took a whole 10 minutes and SP came in at about 40% speed of what you get today. SP handouts didn't exist.
---
If you join now you will have much less grind and a shitton more content. The server is in much better shape then ever. It can acutally handle a growing playerbase without node crashes and unplayable lag.

To sum it up, now is the best time to join.

Ok, bye.

It's gambling because say someone puts up a chimera, with 10 tickets for 100m each. You buy a ticket, which gives the auctioneer 100m (minus taxes probably) and 9 other people also buy a ticket, giving the auctioneer another 900m. you then lose the raffle, the chimera goes to random user over in stain or whatever, and get nothing from your 100m, while the auctioneer gets a billion and the stain guy gets a chimera for 100m

Only the items that are sourced only from plex are TIED to the price of plex. That doesn't mean that the price of plex does not impact the price of other things.

If your suggesting the agency is not a huge  upgrade, you should go and use the dam thing first.

Just because you already know it half the stuff in it after playing for ten years, does not mean its not extremely useful for otheres.

The next update includes some great new functionality, graphics for the wallet to see where money is going. LP is moving to the wallet where it belongs, including new data like you closest LP store for that fraction.
---
Yeah
---
In fact, the basic idea isn't even bad - as they stripped the biggest ingame ISK-Sink (NPC-Taxes &amp; Broker Fees) of one of its bigger parts (PLEX-Trading near completely done from Citadels now) with Citadel patch 2016 - they wanted to introduce a new ISK sink, and make it an additional income source for the company instead of it being just delting ISK (what NPC-Taxes are doing in fact)

The Shield Pve Beginner fit seems like it should have decent DPS for you to kill everything faster. Also, just Google ship name with the words "pve fit" in it and you'll find lots of info. As for the cosmic signatures just fit a Probe core scanner and go search for combat sites. When you find it, Google the name of the site and you'll get info on what to expect there

Thank you, never knew that size comparison chart existed!

250k free skill points and a few agency drugs over the weekend
---
why? players have been asking for this for ages.
---
Anyone can come along and wreck your retriever fleet on a whim. Nothing can save them. That seems pretty assailable to me.
---
Also, you're right, skill injectors are the true problem here. CCP removed time gating from the game and left in all the shit like Titans and rorquals that was OP but at least somewhat balanced because flying them perfectly took a ton of time and dedication possibly years in advance
---
[removed]
---
ahh well, then we understand each other very well...
---
ye sure, so the pvper has to work a little to get to the pver, which makes it possible for the pver to get away (if you need to get 200km off something) or prepare at least for the fight
---
you havent played eve while gambling existed did you?
---
yeah, this time it's just ccp skimming off the top instead of some random player.
---
which is fine with me, since that money will hopefully be reinvested in eve, unlike it just being spent on some random guy's porn habits.

CCP: Hey, what discount rate should we do for this sale? 
---
Also CCP: What was the last sale?

CCP: 15% back a few months ago

Also CCP: Okay make it 20% that but add "BLACK FRIDAY" to the start of the title
---
CCP: That's gonna take a few hours to code
---
Also CCP: 15% then
---
okey thanks for that calculation.
---
sounds feasible to me, not all that matters is, how much a core costs. and then. maybe it will really only be used for very expensive stuff
---
the npc warps in, then the cans explode
---
Are ghost sites the ones that give people the very good loot or is it random?
---
Apparently most of the effort goes into coming up with deceptive ways to extract more money out of the existing playerbase.
---
Trust me when I say you really don't want them to try that. 
---
Look at everything they've improved UI wise. Escalations is a great example. A simple window that gave you all the info you need instantly into a monstrosity of submenus that load at the speed of a snail with flashy graphics that make actually reading the info you want more difficult.
---
And CCP took a hard stance against gambling 3 years ago but now that they’re hurting for money they reversed that position
---
considering ccp announced a lottery, i'm amazed people have struggled so hard to find a picture of an actual lottery.
---
Yeah, why would anyone do a sleeper site?
---
Not having a way to respond and refusing to respond in the hopes that one of their accusation reports would come true are totally different things. Luckily for them, one of the things they were accusing IWANTISK of actually stuck, and not because of the guy running it.
---
Yeah I'd say just roll a new one
---
Yes, but transfer the stuff from your old account to your new account.
---
Take my upvote!
---
I learned about countable infinity from vsauce.
---
https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA
---
no, they took a stance against people RMTing.
---
the casinos were all fronting RMT with the way their referral bonuses worked with third party plex sellers.
---
people would use the casino's referral code, and the casino would get irl money. to encourage the use of the referral code - an in-game kickback would be given to people who used the code. it was converting in-game assets in to irl cash. rmting.
---
Gambling is Gambling, be it a lottery or poker
---
Wait, are you *actually* upset at the idea that CCP tries to make money off of EVE?  And that sometimes things will be implemented which do not conform to your priority list?
---

In your position that honestly understandable...

Don't confuse ordinals with cardinals. ω + 1 is not ω but ∞ + 1 is ∞.

---
I made 500m in a week of flying round in a 10mn thrasher hunting clone soldiers. 
---
It's good for an alpha to get used to flying in more dangerous space too
---
I played when they banned gambling claiming they did that because of RMT. And guess what? This feature is perfect for RMT. 
---
And this post is not about gambling itself. But what is beyond that idea. If CCP will start milking EVE this way, nothing will stop them from micro transactions, p2w and other bullshit. Looking at people reaction, community definitely wont do anything when that will come.
---
I keep hearing this narrative and yet, most of the fights I've been on, even when outnumbered, we have usually beaten our enemies. Not always granted but oftentimes enough times that I've a time believing you. Then again, I tend to fly with sigs n' squads and cut above the weight of most mainline fleets. What you're saying, is similar to what people say about Pandemic Horde. The reality is, the numbers help in large fleet battles, but there's been plenty of times I've seen a smaller group of us, prevail over our enemies in PanFam space. Sorry but I'm gonna have to call BS on this one.

The most funny of the story is when you know that this week a request of a gambler victim has putted a request against the state of iceland in the european curt, and the european curt have accepted her request so iceland will be judge for a gambling trouble.

You get about 80mil+ ISK per hour in a Noctis so just. don't. fucking. use. a. Noctis!
---
Salvage and scanning/hacking is about the best way to make money in EvE as a newbro, hacking benefit is that you can do it solo - ninja salvaging requires to join an alliance or corp where they rat a lot in Supercapitals etc. Allthough the salvaging can be done solo and with low skillpoints you definitly need to be blue to those other guys in system.

They would become more frequent over time, but CCP trashed all of the time they would have had to fix that as it gradually happened.

Why? Its a totally arbitrary restriction on training that hardly makes sense in the age of injectors. Other than making it a pain in the ass to plan your training, and making so the most efficient thing to do with new character is let it train boring core  fitting stuff for a full year, what is the point? Implants are okay I suppose, but I actually think they should just eliminate attributes entirely.

Not on release, according to Tweetfleet Slack #esi.
---
Wormhole sites are probably going to be too hard, especially c3 and up. With nullsec sites like: improved covert research facility, limited, standard and superior sleeper sites you should be fine. Watch some yt videos, there are guides for these sites for sure.
---
It is the absolute height of hypocrisy. CCP bans gambling because it was bad, at the time the only rake was in isk. Now ccp switches course when they think they can be the rake.
---
1 month later, the first posts will show up saying "wow, I just got a Cormack's Adaptive Invuln from Hyperlink for 500 mill, this is amazing" and suddenly the feature everybody hated will be popular. Some late comer will attempt to bitch about "they're turning our kids into gambling addicts!" and they'll be mass downvoted because nobody wants to admit they kiss girls enough to have kids.

Six months later, everybody will laugh about how people sperged about this system, and PA's earnings call will show a spike in CCP revenue.

You're talking about people injecting into big ships being an issue. I'm saying people would still train those characters to sell for a profit, even if injectors never existed. 
---
&gt;As for idiots in big ships, sounds great doesn't work.
---
Oh but it does. Not at 100% efficiency, but idiots die more often than regular players.
---
You'll lose the item in some cases but you still end up getting the isk for all the tickets and say you buy 80% yourself the still gives you the better chances at winning and coming out on top. It's a risk either way but a risk you're more likely to win.
---
I'm multiboxing 4 accounts in C5, I want to do as many sites as possible and quickly (no static farming), and no drifter.
---
I once used 4 rattlesnakes, which was already near diminishing returns in terms of dps. But there was very little micro needed, no errors possible.
---
I still have 2 rattles and I'm wondering if I should try leshaks and nestors. They are cheaper for sure. But even just nestors, I think most fit require to turn the reps on only when needed (otherwise you cap out on sites with neuts), so you have to have the 3 other bs locked and check which one is currently being targeted, turns the reps off etc etc..
---
And with leshaks, you also have to lock the rats to shoot at.. Doing all that with 4 accounts sounds a bit tedious and could end up in some capped out ships. So rattle are way more expensive, but 4 of them require zero micro once the setup is down.
---
They actually require so little micro it's really boring. So I wanted a leshak that could definitely do the battleships faster, but that doesn't work well with 2 rattlesnakes
---
How immoral of him.
---
Flair-baited for the win.
---
I think most of the flak they're getting stems from a few things
---
Mainly Somerblink was shut down by CCP, now they're doing their own
---
Secondly, the time they've had to do this could have been better spent elsewhere ie balancing/actual content
---
I think the added bonus of it being lootboxy/gambling is just more fuel on the fire as opposed to massively genuine concerns
---
A soft squishy wet clay brick that is
---
Yeah i guess you have to find a balance between your chances of losing, ticket profits and cheap enough so others actually buy them.
---
Honestly if anyone can figure that out so its consistent they deserve the isk lol.
---
happy thanks giving day  you too
---
I'd honestly rather they replace attribute mapping by daily skilling spree for raw SP instead of having a one year attribute boost. Mapping was sortof cool when you could have faith in CCP not slumber into chaos at each of Hilmar's brain farts and literally annihilating one's training queue due to some random nerf out of nowhere.
---
At least with skilling spree you can sortof save the ship while with attribute mapping you're cucked for one year after it's done.
---
It seems like you think the time it takes to train into a super is somehow comparable to the time it takes to inject one. The character Bazaar is completely irrelevant to the discussion.
---
Shalom
---
&gt; TAPI bluing Pearl Abyss
---
Ouch.
---
If your flair is to be believed, my corp has yoinked a bunch of your r64 in your capital system. No one even cared to check on us lol
---
Yep. Basically if you have a good pc and connection, you'll be able to see when you log in that your ship is in mid warp, and in a sec or two you land in the spot where you safely logged off, uncloaked
---
That's great, thanks.
---
Posts like that are hilarious.
---
I loved the "I'm a new player and the blackout is great since it helps fight the multiboxing VNI scourge that has inflated the game economy over the past few years and injectors were a mistake and supercapital proliferation is the worst thing to happen ever dead game omg unsubbing" type posts.
---
Got it, thanks bud.
---
And there goes the money they could have had from me ... into booze &amp; christmas garbage.
---
I just joined a couple months ago and have been trying to avoid the "ccpsux" mentality but this is just stupid lmao.
---
edit: just logged in and these boosters are even more stupid.  Wow a 30 minute buff?  GAME CHANGING!
---
\&gt; The thing is that there cant be a good reason.
---
\&gt; Maybe Hilmar came down and said 'Thou shall not have more than X shared groups active at once". 
---
if you think that is a good reason you are an idiot
---
idk what you are trying to tell me with your shitpost.
---
And there is some more salt for em. The game has been heading in this direction for a while. I'm not going to sit here and complain about it all day on reddit. Nothing anyone says is going to change it.
---
I hope that's the way the drama escalates, or else I have bought all this popcorn for nothing.
---
Better than 15 tho.
---
I might have missed this sale. Luckily, CCP made sure to send me one email for every single one of my accounts registered to that address. Thoughtful.
---
Well, i need to agree that mordu's ships are just retarded  :p
---
Ever tried using gangs of frigs with frig logi+ecm to get them tho?
---
I'm pretty sure they are (can be) faster (and cheaper) than the orthus.
---
Downshipping might not be a so obvious choice sometimes, but the right one.
---
Not being able to catch a fast cruiser in a slow cruiser do not seem unbalanced to me....
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
EDIT: here are some base speeds, for reference.
---
condor 400m/s
---
griffin 325m/s
---
bantam 370m/s
---
orthrus 230m/s
---
onyx 200m/s
---
(and i'm pretty sure the orthrus do not fit more than 1 scram, so it cannot stop  the whole squadron from scraming it.)
---
When I saw the Triglavian BC fit for 500m I thought; "A prophecy can do that." Turns out I was right. These sites pay about 15m (HS) if you loot and salavage. The bounty is 4.5m in case some don't know. So this fit will pay for itself rather quickly. But you have to fly it. You will need to know when to get off the field and what NPC's to shoot when.
---
Lol. Thanks. I'm dumb.
---
You are nuts. Pulling shit like this is exactly why players are leaving. Implants are not that important when you are new, my pvp toon has never had them.
---
I've seen people in Eve videos able to get rid of all the data text boxes and just show Eve without any symbols over ships and such.  I've looked through the shortcuts but can't figure out how to do it.  How do I do this?
---
Edit for grammar.
---
o7 Thx for your hard work. The new system is really appreciated and it's great to hear they give you the time to perfect it. Mistakes happen, if they're beeing tackled in a reasable amount of time no one will care too much. This is the best change for a lot of people for the entire year. Btw, you're very invited to join a Habakuk or any other fleet! [https://discord.gg/54gHzMR](https://discord.gg/54gHzMR)
---
Awesome, good to know, thanks!
---
&gt;i want free shit and if I get it I'll come back
---
Fuck off, thanks.
---
Raffles aren't the same as lotteries. Lottery tickets might not have a winner on any given draw, but a raffle always pays out on the first ticket pull.
---
Do you play the game for fun or SP?. . .
---
So, out of all that, as unlikely as it is...  the one thing I'm still wondering..    why is there a lawnmower in the toilet ???
---
Ita 850b, off by quite a bit there lol
---
I was hoping to wake up to a real sale today, this is nothing, subs aren't even on sale, IDGAF about skins.
---
There is no fun way to do it.
---
There is only "good" way to do it. And thats exploration. Its boring, grindy, and there is a lot to learn about mechanics that you probably wont use anywhere else.
---
anyone else get the email saying 25% off omega time just to see no sale?
---
Skill injectors are a commodity, not a gamble ticket.
---
It's more personalized, direct to individual, whereas mittens was a call to all of eve on the internet.  This kinda stuff is pretty mild, but I guess that's because I'm USMC Combat vet without paper thin skin.
---
And..... Blap
---
The part where you say it doesn’t involve real money is flat out wrong. 
---
Part of the outrage is because CCP is monetizing the gambling - i.e. you buy plex for cash and then hypercores on NES. This was never the case with the player-run gambling and AT betting, although RMT was a legitimate concern. Technically you could buy hypercores without having spent any real money yourself, but PLEX only enters the game through real-money transactions with CCP - so someone’s money did go into that, and it’s also possible to just buy a shit ton of plex yourself with cash to fuel your hypercore habit.
---
I think if hypercores dropped from abyssal sites, instead of being what is essentially a microtransaction, people would have been fine with it.
---
It’s not loot boxes, but it’s a step in that direction - which fairly deserves outrage, given loot boxes are just gambling for kids and some countries have taken steps to outlaw them (e.g. Japan) for that very reason. Being an actual raffle, this even more closely resembles gambling than loot boxes do.
---
I unsubbed my accounts after seeing this.
---
CCP: Don't worry guys, balance updates are coming!
---
[ several months later ]
---
CCP: Gambling mechanics! Gambling mechanics! Gambling mechanics!
---
You know about the new shortcut in the combat section of the settings?
---
For sure. I loved running a T2 rig on my machariel. Still warps fast, but the nerf bat hit it hard.
---
It's likely covered under Dutch and Belgium's regulation on lootboxes, somerblink would be covered under that as well ( given they use a qualification of economic value that doesn't exclude in game currency completely as there definition includes the crazy notion that RMT exists ), this means you put something of economic value in and by a chance based process get something of economic value out this would absolutely be covered under those rules ( most likely abyssal rolls are also covered to be fair ), the only question is how long it takes enforcement to realize this violation and tell CCP no. ( something that realistically could take years because for the dutch authority they go by market share to prioritizes there enforcement and well CCP doesn't have a large share in the gaming market ).
---
Hmm I will have to take a gander at it thanks.
---
Yep I was mining almost a super a day doing this in Dek was insane
---
T2 Trimark is a particularly weird fit here.
---
So, who is allowed to have an opinion? ^(I don't like it BTW.)
---
Right.....cause you can afford to do that. Not everyone can and not everyone wants too. Probably about 10-15 minutes. Its 122m. It simply show that bling isn't required for this content.
---
the buffs are huge in 1vs1 pvp
---
But then, how much time will you lose to get another if your internet dies/get ganked by 10 nados?
---
Probably not your case, but a few weeks ago there were someone here asking for CONCORD to be buffed, because the risk of losing his 5 bil leshak doing trig sites were to big, because of gankers.
---
50% the reward \*should\* be ok for 5% the risk....
---
People usually blind themseves to the reality, when it goes against their wild emotions.
---
EDIT: grammar
---
Agreed. Nano didn't fit and I didn't want to back off of my cap build so I substituted buffer. I also used plate buffer to reduce the amount of clicks needed to stay alive.
---
Beautiful! This is such a lovely painting. &lt;3

Votre revue n'est pas très interessante non plus. Enfin, vous êtes plutôt tout seul à trouver ce logiciel "nul" pour un pretexte aussi mineur, c'est assez recomfortant finalement. Heureusement pour vous, je serai ravi de corriger ça si possible
---
Just for that I Will give it a try xD
---
omg this is such a realistic painting of that ship!
---
Also if you blue everyone it makes it a lot easier to not lose ships!
---
None of the PI things are available to alphas
---
Sadly, this is just copy pasta.
---
By using the "People &amp; places" windows I now have to collapse all sub-folders every time i change ship or dock. Hope it gets sorted out quickly as it has become a pain in the neck if you had ever Bookmark arranged in sub-folders.

Yes, triglavian content is like [gravy on mashed potatoes.](https://cdn7.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2014/11/enhanced-buzz-9090-1385592095-9-600x450.jpg)

I'll try 10.01 times harder for 10mil sp!

Sucks to see that ChoosenOne.

Don't forget my name, keep it in mind.
---
This ^^
---
i just came back to this game after like a year, does this mean you are selling them under market value or
---
While I experiment heavily with these (to minimze the isk/time ratio), I think you over-estimate the payout, for a single ship over the long term (ie more than 100 sites) payouts will average for a single ship to around 10mil/site.
---
The amount of extremely low and extremely high payouts varies so much, that you only get a real sense of the average payout after doing a 100+
---
While im still exploring the "best" way to do these with the isk/time ratio (without bling...only T2 fits), I will certainly look to figuring out the cheapest fit to do it...my goal would be cheapest fit without needing to warp out. I suspect a Praxis active or passive fit will end up being the cheapest way to do these without needing to warp out of the conduit.
---
is no better game out thats the problem...at least for me
---
Lottery?

Seriously you dicks  need to stop moaning about everything CCP does , eve online is the best space game out there if you have nothing constructive to say , then shut the fuck up , cry baby little bitches

I have heard something about the EU banning loot boxes but isn’t that because they were putting items in the boxes only obtained by buying loot boxes? This system can’t sell anything that isn’t obtainable you other means

Fun fact for anybody who does alot with sabers, if the gate is the large one to connect one part of space to another, the chances someone will jump through gate and be outside your bubbleis increased drastically and is best done by three pilots. My testing (years ago dont play anymore) was about a 20% chance they wpuld spawn outside bubble and be able to fly away if you were sitting at 0 in as direct of the center as possoble.

So I found out why he is so mad.
---
Had to filter out all the super creepy porn messages to get there though. My favourite was:
---
"My dick could realistically win a beauty contest. I've had it described by several different people as "very pretty"."
---
Anyway, he is mad that the dates on a sp event was vague and he missed the last day.
---
&gt;(Do unkown wormholes, they're mostly empty or with other alpha explorers)
---
Keep thinking that...
---
Is there also a fix for the permanently cycling loading timer but nothing showing when you open people and places?
---
F's in chat boys
---
This is a dishonest scheme for the purpose of monetizing content generated by players that they already paid for by subscribing.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Yes because unlike you I have a problem with them exploiting people with a addiction. If someone was spending hundreds to keep buying titan after titan to the point to where it is a addiction and ruining their life sure I'd have a problem with that. Though I haven't seen evidence for that.
---
Wut
---
Welcome back!
---
If you assign the same weight to all updates. Obviously this is incorrect.
---
No poors plz?
---
They should have a warning pop up every time you play that says "know your limit play within it" also a pop up everytime uve spent over x amount of isk and/or time gambling to remind you to to play wisely.
---
Ty kind sir
---
No fun allowed, think of the children.
---
  Better remove all risk everywhere because someone might become addicted/injured doing it. 
---
  Better shutdown all casinos and make all forms of gambling illegal- Shit better ban alcohol too because that kills people.
---
  When are we petitioning CCP to remove PLEX from the game?
---
Are you bragging on the internet about having lots of space money? 
---
Nut up or shut up, my man. Post a screenshot of you sending this dude 10bil.
---
Love your work, keep it up
---
3 minute warp timer?
---
Keep on fighting brother, a step at a time - for as long as there's a new tommorow there's a chance for something positive to happen to you. See you in back in New Eden when you're ready!
---
Warp away.
---
Many people, myself included, have also found that when opening people and places, you get a loading timer that never ends and you cannot see any bookmarks at all.
---
Except you don't need hypercores for the gambling part. You need them to setup raffle, and people setting up raffle stand to make shitton of isk from this
---
Not forever.  
---
  
---
3 min tops.  
---
Edit: also, get fucked.
---
Somer were not banned for being a gambling site.  
---
They were banned for RMT.
---
Out of town my dude. I have 0 need to prove anything to you. Fun fact tho, made my frost trillion isk in 2013. Market PvP is the best isk in the game.
---
and yet it doesn't with the bookmark limit per folder.
