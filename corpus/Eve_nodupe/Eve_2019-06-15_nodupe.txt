PURGED FROM DEADCO BY SORT DRAGON

Yes, he cares about his favorite hobby that he engages in whenever he has freetime just like the rest of us. Seriously dude, cut it out with this "lol its just a game bro" holier than thou bullshit. Quit acting fake on public forums to make yourself look good.
---
Oh thanks, I'll keep that in mind
---
Prospects might be less suspicious in wormholes, but not in nullsec.
---
yeah you're right, brand newbros, within tapi, within legacy, within taperium, is still the little guy.
---
Are you the dude that got busted for input broadcasting then cried enough to get unbanned?
---
Eve players used to beg for ship skins that same way, right?
---
No no no. Goons cried so hard to try and get me banned but failed.
---
There are pseudo renters in lowsec though.
---
I didn't know Wingspan was flying Ikitursas.
---
Really? Who? How?
---
Pretty sure input broadcasted. But sure
---
actually it's literally brainwashing kids into homosexuality
---
There's always a bigger propaganda advertisement.
---
pacman is about to eat the rest...

This is beautiful
---
No :(

My gf broke up with me but thanks for asking  
---
what about you?

each corp rents moons from shoot first, in kor azor and genesis.

Almost there. Just a bit further and we can complete what the Chinese server did and finally let the game die.
---
SH1 evac time or something?

he's a goon with the belief that they are not the blue donut.

didnt we use to have that on the TV in the captain's quarters?

You genuinely believe that? Also, sexuality of all kinds is 'normative'. It's not a relatively new concept to fuck your mate in the ass.
---
i went out and bought the reaction formulas not realizing reactions are a refinery mod and that we don’t have one in our hole
---
i asked the alliance guy and they have a reactor set up, so now i wait till we get a hole opens up close by and i’ll bring the gas out and have it couriered to that station

Tfw you come from the chinese server into another one
---
hey did u say something in the wh chat about scanning for 3 hours? cause if so i saw u
---
I keep having this thought and not posting it cause I'll get shouted down. The pendulum continues to swing just as it always has before.
---
I think the answer is yes to both questions ;p
---
Got to handle the G spot delicately. If he wants to get us there, he'll have to know what he's doing.
---
It's about as good as any other thing an alpha can do. Gas huffing at 50mil/hr, VNI ratting at 60mil/hr and Explo at 50-150mil/hr are probably the best consistent things an alpha can do to make ISK.
---
Could I buy some of these pods please?
---
Anyone else agree sunglasses make your pilot look like dbag?
---
Any specific roaming areas you’ve found pretty good for a small gang size?
---
I miss the ads for dead alliances.
---
I mean you are displaying exactly what im talking about. You think you know but you have no idea how to play this game and even when you ask a question and get a answer you just brush it off and never learn. You think because you learn in null that means you know get it, no it means your handicapped in every aspect of the game outside huge fleets.
---
blood in the water? Try free titans, the people who pulled that all off have given their side of the events more than once a few even made it into new articles by gaming sites, the low sec moons aren't even mentioned.
---
And that space will immediately be filled by the red groups.
---
Hey when im sitting tethered on my vni waiting for roamers to leave coz "Im not your content" , it would be nice to have a fancy skin to look at, like the old station with "girls girls girls" signs.
---
Arnoce, of course I care about the hobby, I spent $50 on some art. But I don't go around shitting on people because they are on the other side of the space battles. It isn't acting holier than than thou, it is just a fascination that people would actually actively try to make people feel shitting for playing a game.  You guys do you guys, though.
---
Lol nice. And yeah that was me. I gave up too
---
I just hope you stop posting
---
Yes
---
....
---
WAt?
---
Idk it happened before i was settled back into the game, can i get an encore showing to see its battle performance?

**My "How to find a corp" - 101;**
---
Okay, this one requires a little bit more finesse. Instead of teling you to join a random big block and being done with it, as you're interested in PvP. I'll give you this:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Get a hold of a type of frigate by a multiple of your choice (10+). Just take a close look at t1 frig you like most and what stats they provide. You put a little thought into it and fit the first one with your idea. Don't read up on anything, don't spoil with pre-existing opinions and ideas, you need to do YOUR mistakes. Go to lowsec and get wrecked by another player. Don't mind if you get podded, that's just Eve. The emphasis here is that you attack EVERYTHING first without  any sense of self preservation, you step down your targets one by one. The goal is to learn how long you would hold up if you were in the same situation again and getting you used to losses. Convo whoever blew you out of your ship. Be nice, give them a bit of flattery, ask for suggestions and tactics if you give them enough of a fun time, they will probably invite you into their public channel, where you keep being a jolly newbro. That's where you get the first hook in. If you give them the funniest time in days, they will probably invite you into their corp right away. Don't join just yet, you're still collecting hooks. It could be a unique case that a lucky carebear just killed you. Over the course of the next few days you repeat the process, you keep being a public nuisance in the lowsec of your choice, harrassing everyone and lacking the ability to feel any embarassment over your losses. That's where you get the next hooks in. Basically the aim is to build a certain amount of notoriety and infamy in the lowsec of your choice. Then you look at the killboards; generally, discount any cap drops on subcaps, they happen, sad but true, and they're not characteristic for good gameplay. But; if a corp has a lot of red in industrials on zkill, you just avoid them, they're not your place. They're carebears. If the corp has 50/50 green/red or anything near that on zkill, they're your second choice. You want to join a corp that has over 50% kills in small gangs and solo, they're where you want to get into. Getting into a corporation is easy, getting into the right corp is a different deal.
---
And? Its showing two donuts and provi.
---
Just got home from working. No complaints
---
Goonfleetdotcom is that way 👉
---
Possibly. Or it hasn't quite this that breaking point. I guess that remains to be seen.
---
Right, and the bigger donut will always be shitted on.
---
How original, I guess we know why your people were bored :P
---
Frat evicting small groups of people and now getting fricked themselves.... life is good
---
Theyre useful idiots, theyll fight and die then be discarded once theyve outlived their reason.
---
What do you mean **you people**?????
---
You're really bad at this.
---
well that's nice :)
---
I guess it [could be OK](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z0XoLM3Jnd0/maxresdefault.jpg)....
---
Has the end of the beginning of the end already begun?
---
despite every other day on this sub, i love you all. you're the reason this game is still going.
---
i know that doesn't mean much because none of you know who i am/im not space famous
---
but hey, this game community does mean a lot to me, and im sure most of you are genuinely good people. 
---
the last few weeks for me were honestly terrible and ive been horribly depressed, in pain, and emotional. but on the bright side, im proud of the few accomplishments ive made, namely my Japanese language studies and working towards my college degree (tho im considering changing my major since a BA in CJ is considered pretty useless by most departments hiring in that field) and the fact that i secured a very comfortable job. so, i guess its not all bad.
---
this is my favorite thread on this sub, and im glad to see the numbers it generates. it renews my desire to play this game and talk to fellow players.
---
you guys are cool.
---
1 injector per egg. PM all isk to ~~goonswarm chief accountant.~~ the nearest toilet.
---
Honestly it's for the best. Be free. Be the best of us.
---
I like your idea and I think this is a good solution to the problem. Population keeps dropping and I wonder how much longer the game can keep going the way it is.
---
Fuckin nice work
---
There's more animated billobards outside the stations.  I can't escape from clear visions.
---
We need another WWB
---
I can hear it.  well done
---
Part of the reason you unsubbed was because the rainbow flag? Do you need a safe space, snowflake?
---
HE DOES WHAT? DAMNIT TELL ME
---
Hey. I started in 2008 and and never stopped for more than a few months. I have never purchased an injector off the market. Nor have i ever used an extractor on any of my many alts all paid up omegas. 
---
I will never use these things and do not care to join the ~~retard~~ race that is titan blobbing. 
---
Shame on the current state of this nonsense.
---
Thing is that it is too attractive to simply join a big alliance instead of a smaller one, especially for newbros who need protection and make isk. A small entity might not give the same production and one gets the feeling to always live on the good will of the big alliances.
---
And the possibilities of gaining power out of that position might right now be limited... 
---
In can be wrong, but still. 
---
I don't think the amount of space is the problem. It's the amount of actually different groups (considering coalitions a group). 
---
But the end is not here yet and so long I'll enjoy playing and who knows, maybe things do not get as bad as described😊
---
#wakeupccp
---
I'm pretty sure the map looked like this once before around B-R. But the south was russian at the time instead of TAPI.
---
+1, if you wanna get into my account you'll need my mobile phone, which is fingerprint locked, then work out my account password, then have access to both those things at the same time to input the 2FA code. 
---
  And if my phone's been stolen- No prob i'll wipe it clean from my PC :smug: no more codes for you.
---
&gt; what if you loose that phone? lets say it gets destroyed not stolen
---
  You can have codes sent to email instead i think
---
Well, nice video.

As former Bergmann Federation Diplo I wish you the best of luck.

Good to know!
---
AT ads were fun.
---
This is one of the saddest Eve images I've ever seen.
---
Way easier. You cant inejct more than 5/10M skils per year.
---
In others words: You cant use more than one injector every 15 days or another T days.
---
This would change A LOT the game and for us all, it would be so good.
---
So, injectors would not be abused how they are.
---
I don't think it should be classified as keter
---
Drake. No fit needed.
---
How much for a 30 second ad with a dancing dick-butt that plays at least once every 10 minutes?  That's something I'd help fund
---
Having fun is not the problem right now.
---
It's a bit like climate change. Not too bad now but go on like now and things will get messy.
---
Shhhhh. No giving away the plan.
---
&gt; not at all im saying warran (ceo of sash) was put in charge of TRI when garst went on deployment, and ran it into the ground so hard that he eventually quit and joined snuff to pave a way for his own corp to join a few months later
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; literally ask anyone outside of your corp, even skill urself started hating us because of that fucking piece of shit... he even managed to make TRI late to our own keepstar defense
---
If you have the funds, yes.   Credit card warrior, ftw
---
He killed a Brave ratting VNI in Catch. Did nothing to Goons or Brave for a while then lost 2 Tengus in the space of  7 days in Catch and and stopped playing on that char.
---
Ah the big blue donut is closer to being completed than ever before. What a time to not play eve. Snooze fest! Sadly..
---
Depressing huh?
---
Wow. What a *CLUSTERFUCK*

&gt; they hacked my email account and from there they did the damage

  gmail, outlook has 2fa. Then there's Protonmail which is encrypted as well.

Please keep getting this noticed.

How many of your posts are about killboards? 
---
Are you literally just sitting there hitting refresh in zkill?

roboboi you are like the living breathing posterchild for the spodcancer irony that is plaguing tranquility and i think you might just be fully aware of it when hell freezes over

I love hurricane so much, danm
---
Only depressing to the losers.
---
agreed

That's extremely sad to see akin to serenity stagnation.

Except you included neutral npc stain in said blue donut. We are part of no large coalition :)
---
save the server lmao

Horde will come, they must come

I'll take it out for a spin, see how it goes. Suggestions for targets?

No casino money or free POS goo this time

Jokes on those who willingly can't log in. I lost my domain and email for both accounts. Annnd don't know the password to boot.

I'm not confident that you understand the map, or know what you just said.
---
Nope, easier to cry on reddit about what an awful unfair game eve is
---
Instead we have world war panfam and they are getting fucked,  i must say the leadership melt Downs at your renters who refuse to pay is humorous
---
Pretty much. I mean I don't really blame them, if I was getting shit on and nobody wanted to help me because I was an asshole to everyone, I'd probably find something to complain about and blame too. The bright side is, the game isn't going to die because of it, it will just change, as it has done over and over.
---
bro i live in lowsec idk who youre talking to
---
Based Provi
---
Eve uni for all rounder highsec / karmafleet - brave newbies - I guess horde? For null sec life, lowsec is dead space, and wh I know nothing about but im sure there are options
---
When 70% of nullsec is blue then we are all losers in the end.
---
It's too late for him.
---
RIP EVE 2020
---
Just cluster in a region with abunch of other retards and krab lmao imagine being a nullsec entity and not doing the enganging emergent empire building gameplay
---
I'm sorry about your girlfriend if you need someone to talk to hmu

Ah well.  That's still preferable (from a comedic sense) to the Trig ships individually targeting bits of the station at random.

Can I come play wow with you guys please?
---
Blueballs or helldunks!
---
How many times are people going to re post the same thing? yes its funny, but stop posting the  same thing over and over, mods can u deal with this.
---
Thanks for the comment from a member of a coalition that mass recruited 70% of nullsec.
---
incorrect
---
We've always wanted content?
---
I mean people are dumb, so they make it hard. Rorquals - especially now adays - are really easy to kill.
---
It's easier to spook them, watch them unseige and align somewhere, catch bubble them as they warp off. They can't panick at that point.
---
The ONLY thing that's make rorquals hard to kill is having an organized response on standby, and that's assuming the rorqual is paying attention and in real time communications with said standby. Other than that lol they are like shooting NPCs.
---
When did Panfam break a deal, especially PL? No need to respond because it never happened.
---
I was in the newbro boots two times. Both times I joined some random corp which was just like three guys without a clue. The first time I joined a corp when the CEO just passed by and asked me if I wanted to join his corp. I looked into it; corp was founded 3 days ago, dude was one day older than me. "Yeah, sure, why not? I have no clue, you have no clue, let's have no clue together." We grew to like 20 people over time and after a year and a half in highsec as innocent carebears we were in wormspace, making life miserable for everyone. It was just glorious.
---
After a lengthy break I lost access to my main account (which was later resolved thanks to a very good GM), and rolled a new character. Joined a corp, it was all fun and games until it all broke apart. As a follow up I started a new corp, catching up all the corpies I cared about and even getting a few new guys aboard. Now we live in nullsec, being lazy and pursuing our own hedonistic desires. I stepped down as CEO when I found out someone else is better at running the corp.
---
The thing is; if you're open and welcoming, you surely will run into trouble at some point. A lot of people develop a rather paranoid attitude towards strangers because of it. That happend to me too. As a consequence I just remodelled some mechanics my corp worked on and I kept my happy go lucky attitude with people.
---
Don't feel too small as an individual for starting your own corp. Give it YOUR message, the personality of your corp starts with you. It's a task which you can't really plan or prepare yourself for. I think the most important thing is flexibility with other people's ideas. In the early days of my corp we didn't really have a program besides "we don't mine!", as I wanted to encourage my corpies to explore the game and not sit in some belt, picking up lumps of dirt all day. It worked out great; we had a bunch of more experienced players tutoring the newcomers and other older players who did massive monetary contributions. It all came together so perfectly, because nothing was asked for. It wasn't me who put up an Athanor, it was a sponsor in our corp who wanted to have it, I just passed it like "yeah whatever" and I just gave him anchoring rights. Of course this could have backfired badly, but I exactly knew what we were capable of. In the end we moved into nullsec and I think my corp will also be my retirement home, as I don't have any intentions of moving somewhere else.
---
If you asked me, what's more important in Eve, it's not necessarily how many SP you have, or what daring fights you manage to come out on top of, or how many liquid ISK you have. It is personality, how social you are, how positive you can be and how you deal with negative impacts.
---
Imagine not doing that but still being top 10 alliances in kills nearly every month?
---
it wasn't all bad, we had some good talks :)
---
Well if hell does freeze over I got some fresh realestate in the Tribute / Vale area I'm willing to let go of at good pricing.
---
End of days.
---
homosexuality is not normal. it should not be pushed as an equal alternative to heterosexuality. and it should definitely not be pushed on children. pride is just marketing gayness to kids.
---
Rorq is 300 and orca is the same after skills
---
I just came back for the nostalgia this week as I received some free Omega time from Twitch. . .definitely rookie numbers.
---
I've been a pilot since 2009, but have taken many long breaks, this last one is about 4 years. I have 6 characters on two accounts, at 90M SP, 30M SP, and about 10M SP for the other 4. 
---
I can make about 600 M ISK/day passively through production. . . log in for an hour, shuffle jobs, and then play something else.
---
Shh, your facts are wrecking the goon narrative.
---
Cool. Can we have a pic of it?
---
This is why you don't drink salt water
---
Isn't that how Sort has skipped along for years?
---
You should have let TEST kill GotG when we deployed.  Instead panfam supers and horde subcaps came to save them from a TEST only deployment.
---
because imperium didn't complain during WWB
---
Nah. The Russian groups alone produced more conflict than all of null does now.
---
Test sold their sole, PGL sold his integrity, Vily gets to play war games for his puppet master. Tests like of pride wont allow this to happen

---
Where do i sign up !?
---
Ok this might be a dumb answer, but is your display plugged in to you GPU?  
---
Reason I ask is the Radeon Vega 3 is the integrated GPU in AMD CPUs, and it is what EVE seems to be using by defauly.
---
I had a similar issue with my server where the GPU refused to operate without a monitor attached.
---
Yeah, you didn't break a deal.  You just did stupid shit continuously until you put the game into the current state.  But you know, FC's run panfam, and FCs are incapable of seeing more than two months into the future.  It's certainly more fun to run campaigns against people a bit weaker than you.
---
If you weren't up TEST or Brave's ass for years, the current relationship between goons and Legacy wouldn't exist.  You could have fought goons and left us the fuck alone for once.
---
I agree with this, the problem being that it’s even more unrealistic since it removes people spamming a ton of injectors which is essentially moving real money for CCP. Whatever solution is reached needs to retain that function because it won’t ever change away from that
---
Well yea, it will become mine craft and won't be eve anymore.
---
Billboards too but even more is the Station itself.
---
Before Citadels we had some variety of the stations we docked in in nullsec.  Now we are always docked in Citadels with the same station design for years now.  
---
It was sort of fun being in a Minmatar station with its rusty red interior, then a Gallente one with cool greens, then Amarr with golden/white.
---
It was supposed to be sarcastic since the only good strat is getting your whole coalition to krab so you can build more supers and krab harder
---
too much spod =/
---
Really, if there're going to be billboards on your structure, and somebody else's ads on them, you ought to get some ISKs out of the deal.
---
Honestly no one cares anymore. And that's coming from a goon. Like, we aren't even impressing ourselves anymore. The donut is nearly complete, once the caps go home there will never be a reason to undock them again except to make isl...for what? I don't know.

No, they used to beg for the ability to apply custom paint jobs to ships and skins is what they got instead.
---
Scrupfairly, if CCP gave players the ability to apply arbitrary paint jobs the game would turn X-rated by the next downtime.
---
Their time will come soon enough lol..
---
Unless you make more than 1b isk/hr, which you won't as a newbie or alpha, do not attempt to use plex to sub. It would be a nightmare grind even if you had all the knowledge of a vet, which you don't yet.
---
Lmao.. sure.. like a street dog
---
Dat Ass
---
What not to understand? Universe domination is my goal in eve.
---
Lemme know if you need a friend.
---
Imagine actually caring about killboards still.
---
as a returning player starting over, it doesn't help that everyone I talk to doesn't have A character, they have like 5, which means you have to be paying for multiple accounts to keep up.  
---
That kills the new playerbase before it even starts.
---
I used to play back when BOB ruled, then took a long break and decided recently (yesterday) to return to the game with a new account until I figure out how to recover my old one.
---
Imagine being so fundamentally broken as an organization that you would rather self destruct than make even minor changes to how you play the game.
---
No, this does not involve you sitting in rorquals.

Or if you're just inedpt and lazy, it's too hard to remember.

Have you tried... idk, reading?

You sound like one of those retards who doesn't even know how to open the hood of their car. Go fucking learn something because none of us are going to waste our time teaching you with this shitty attitude you've had about it.
---
Thank you
---
I'll take this to the board
---
Evict HTP because you cant?
---
There you go, glad you finally put the 'trigger'. Enjoy the game, enjoy kicking my ass. It is all good fun. Peace
---
Yeah because test wasn't facing an invasion from everyone in null except the imperium.
---
Clearly, for the good of the game, they should have just bent over and let themselves get fucked, what a bunch of cowards.
---
Nobody more richly deserves getting destroyed this way than NCPL does, sorry about that.
---
You forgot biomassed.
---
I'm thinking back to 2013-14 era.  
---
There was a lot more people active in the game then, though. For every 3 online now, there were 5 in those days.
---
I like red snapper better. Very tasty!

Is your name the mittani? No?

Congratulations, all you've achieved is being a pawn in someone else's game.

Sort is a trash-tier alliance leader, I think he just wised up this time since we butt-fucked his soul so hard last time.

There you go, glad you finally put the 'trigger'. Enjoy the game, enjoy kicking my ass. It is all good fun. Peace 
---
And I'm glad you enjoy the art, even if you hate the thing which sparked the idea. If it helps, it isn't about one particular event, it is about Eve in general.
---
I truly do not understand the appeal of big coalitions like goons. Whats the point
---
If only Israel Kamakawiwoʻole was here to sing it. RIP
---
That's alot of words to just say I'm very angsty because NCPL isn't feeding into us
---
I don't expect NCPL to welp fleets into us, but the amount of pitty party tears raining from the heavens here on reddit is really quite amusing.
---
Probably allows more casual play along being able to krab with almost no danger

Eve is ded

I would rather not NEED to have 5+ alts.  Nothing tells a new player "RUN!" faster then "yeah you're gonna want 10 alts over at LEAST 4 accounts".
---
This I like! Im truly confused how CCP didn’t see this as game breaking. Skill injectors, skins, rorq seems to me they were trying to close the books with eve. The second they announced them I said no. Free to play was enough for new player retention. How to fix it now? I dont think you can, the damage is done.  IMO, you should be able to skill inject pass 5 mil and you should also be limited on what skills you can inject in.
---
Capital
---
Why do they need haw weapons? Only capital that should hit subcaps should be carriers. They should also have a damage application between a cruiser and battleship. Haw dreads and titans shouldn’t be a thing. They should heavily rely on subcaps for support.
---
My theory on why they did it.
---
I honestly think it’s because of their investors. The health and future of the game doesn’t matter as long as their quarterly ticks keeps coming.
---
Whats next?
---
I don’t know, where some of the most experienced devs packing their bags and seeking employment else where are huge red flags. It’s would take a genius to make Eve enjoyable without pissing everyone off. Logically, to keep the game alive. It’s probably best to take on a world of Warcraft approach and just make it one big PVE fest. Everyone can hold hands, sing kumbaya together, and forge strong alliances to push back a game breaking NPC for taking over sov. Cant believe i just typed that but fuck it. GG
---
I coined this name months ago
---
heh, yup.  And as a newbro, drones V as well.  I went on vacation and qued that up specifically, cause fuck that wait, for what is basically, an essential skill
---
Even if the bluedonut was destroyed it doesn't change the fact this game will still be bleeding people because of CCPs retardedly long development and some pretty bad choices
---
I can only hope that other groups form to take their place, who wont be blue to test or goons. The only true killer of eve alliances is boredom
---
F
---
im using a laptop
---
Legacy and GOTG would still be fighting along side of panfam if they did not decided to farm them or try to evict them, without those terrible decision we would have a pretty even map between 2 mega empire : Imperium vs Panfan..
---
I'd shed pity tears too if I had to start recruiting abunch of barley competent f1 pushing krabs
---
I think a lot of folks forget the whole poaching angle, here. A lot of the ill will on display comes from aggravated, sustained poaching of FCs and supercap havers from groups like BRAVE and TEST.
---
Imagine winning an MMORPG :D
---
I don't really want to evict you anymore tho. You're the most reliable content around.
---
Plus, you've got some great moons we can mine, at no cost to ourselves. (Well, TRC, but same difference.)
---
omega trains the skills at double the speed
---
&gt;barley competent
---
But at least they'd bring beer with them.
---
I see a lot of complain about Imperium "owning" nullsec, but what CCP could do ?
---
Fuck.... how are we going to get rid of this sov now?
---
TAPIs complaint has consistently been 'we're not in your super blue donut and with goons because we chose to fight with c02".
---
The problem is the *super blue donut,* not which side TAPI's on.
---
well then if our dreams come true let the record show Orion1337 "the rock" johnson coined the name sometime ago
---
Nerfing jump fatigue into the ground was pretty stupid.  CCP did it because reddit begged for it.
---
The whole point was so that Goon and Panfam caps wouldn't be able to intervene in the TEST vs Fraternity conflict.  (at least not without committing for more than a day).
---
[Similar to the article that held this](http://i.imgur.com/h7lNte1.png), they had polled players for their RL professions, engineers, IT staff and such were the top results.
---
wondering if you deliver good content down there!
---
Me too; and. CCPlease maek his happen
---
don't let your dreams be dreams
---
It's actually Tapireiumnitiave Guardians of the PIBC now, there was a super intense meeting about it
---
No, you may not store anything on my PC or in my head space. ;P
---
Maybe for a month. But goons hold on the south was tenuous at best. Its much worse this time.
---
I dont think CCP made any changes whatsoever in context of FRT vs TAPI. This was always going TAPI's way regardless of what Vily tells you.
---
UALX was always going TAPI's way?  That's a hell of a statement.
---
Bluedonut is a symptom not a cause. Hopefully everyone gets that.
---
Did you try clicking that big thumbs down button (daily) it might fix stuff
---
And game cache would bloat to 30 terabytes with the first big fight.
---
HOLY MOLY HOLY MOLY
---
Compromise the device or compromise their social media and you usually have easier access via 2FA than without it.
---
At least a PC has the processing power to load an anti-malware, anti-virus, should be wired though a secure network, et cetera.
---
Mobiles?
---
Far easier to do man-in-the-middle attacks.

---
Hmm ... I wonder if more EVE accounts stolen in universities due to  dorms, poor infrastructures and wifi ...
---
Hilariously enough, it was you guys trying to evict us last summer, and drawing in every ally you could buy borrow or steal, that precipitated us truly getting to where we are now.
---
If you hadn't gotten pl to bring their super fleet down last summer, then the cold war between panfam and the imperium would not have gone hot then, and imperium/legacy coordination would not be as close as it is now, and gotg would still be a part of the north, pl wouldn't have curled up and died, the north would still appear to be a competent power bloc.  
---
You really pushed a lot of peoples houses of cards over.  Soon you will be server losers two servers running.
---
NCPL's conflict was with Co2, TEST had a choice, and chose to insert itself with C02, Vale wasnt even invaded. You have to remember, NCPL and TEST were not allies. There was neutrality. There were no agreements broken, no backstabs, just a fight with CO2. TEST space wasn't even invaded. What you think is a narrative of complaints, tears and a huge spin of victim complex spun up, frankly, thats what you have been doing your entire existence, sucking up to the #1. Fortunately or unfortunately, you're #2 who acts like #10 and 'im gunna git evicted netime nao'. We've never had a case of #2 sucking #1s dick. Bob and Goons went at it, NC/PL/goons wents at it and the various variations in between, but not the situation now.
---
Your mere existence, politics,  utter and total lack of ambition is a burden on this game. Fuck, Sort is more useful because rest of us dont have to see him over here.

my "little guy" alliance is going pretty well and we're having a good time, which is a rare treat! having very few poor interactions with unfun blobs as of late - though they do still happen. hoping the trend continues.
---
Is this multiple accounts or just multiple people holding a role? I at least have 2-3 account varying. So those all make sense to me.
---
i'll send you some isk if you want a little helping hand
---
The part I hate the most is your camera is designed to be aimed at them when you dock or log in. It's not super noticeable until you're up to large battleships. Though it's fun logging in with the camera aimed at my Machariel's fat pink ass now and then.
---
We dont know how true that is, ebcause their price would drop and many others people would afford buying it.
---
So, there is a chance that in the end, not much would be changed to CCP but a lot for us.
---
Have you got the correct drivers installed, some laptops you have to download from the laptop manufacturer not amd's site.

I am the Director of Apathy, Team Leader of Nostalgia, Coordinator for, "Doing something else because EVE needs updates," and our by-line is, "Darn it! What was my password again? Oh, stuff it."
---
Going above any beyond to answer your request. The game (as it is now) far favors the defender. Even if, huge if, the anti-CFC coalition of the past were to reform, it would be next to impossible to actually crack open an area like delve. Even if it was, fozzie sov and citadels made fighting an offensive war so horribly unpleasant that no one wants to. You burn out your FC’s, you burn our your line members, and the enemy you are invading keeps everything of value. So what’s the point?
---
Yeah before frat/tri came along the east was host to a bunch of smaller entities, who were for the most part independent.
---
SRP, listen to FC ... where is the scary part?
---
I think you missed the point. In a post talking about a huge NIP/Blue donut you wanna go at a group for actually fighting a war in eve
---
Didn't you guys claim victory and hell camped for 2 weeks?
---
the main reason is twofold: 1) asset safety keeps assets gone for atleast 5 days, and
---
2) there is trillions and trillions of goop in the refineries that would pop open like finding oil.
---
1) you can easily get all of those assets back. Even supers and titans end up in a station.
---
2) See reason one
---
lmfao blaming frat for test bluing everyone
---
spodbrain at its finest
---
Who the fuck are you to assume the docking ports are on the front of the station?
---
I think you missed the point.  You fight a war you can lose, if you lose there are consequences.  In this case, it was the north coming apart at the seams.
---
What are we supposed to just give you pity victory?  Do you need a safe space to stage out of?  Are your keepstars supposed to be off limits due to gentlemanly agreement?  do you want some welfare titans to even the numbers?
---
We worked long and hard, as individuals, and as organizations to build the forces that now oppress and destroy you.  You dillied and did nothing with the time that we spent building.  You should have been building like mad when you saw the industrial output in the south.  Instead you mocked us as spodbrained miners who would never pose a threat to you.
---
No idea how many SP I have. Could only fly mining barges, gallente blockade runners, cheetah, loki, scimitar, oneiros, cyclone, hurricane with almost perfect skills and I think I was near sitting in a carrier before the FAX changes.
---
... but there are so many veterans that multi-box, have trillions of ISK and can't fly anything worth a damn.
---
Provi looks around and gives everyone the finger.
---
I thought like the WiS TV trick, you were going to run a guide of loading content into the game via client side folder and file changes.
---
he said 'fucking everyone over' not 'breaking deals'
---
Small note but dont buy plex with irl money to get omega, you can buy game time directly for less.
---
Everyone knew this will happen when injector was introduced tbh. But CCP ignored all concerns and got juicy cash for $$$$, which made them attractive to Pearl Abyss.
---
Maybe we would face nowadays problems, capital proliferation, even skill injectors are not introduced. Also injectors have their own good.
---
However, we can’t deny injectors accelerated this situation, maybe we could face this boring end-game like 5 years, or even 10 years later if injectors are not a thing; which is enough time for us to get EVE 2 or alternative game.
---
Once again, in the context of the CURRENT post you are reaching for irrelevant points. No one disputed the legacy area being established the way it is. I called you out for talking about turtling and bluing up the biggest coalition in the game and standing like you conquered some impossible fight against all odds.
---
As it pertains to the rest of your uneducated jabs about what’s going on in Tribute. We don’t need anyone’s pity for playing the game the way it’s easiest to play, we don’t need any welfare ships of any kind cause we haven’t lost any that we need to replace. Most importantly of all, if you think I lose any sleep over what happens to a made up location in a video game, you are probably way more invested in the north than I am.

Breaking deals is fucking people over believe it or not, the whole reason sort dragon is salty is over ' broken deals and back stabs ' as well
---
It takes about 100 hours as a alpha to earn the plex, please do not try and farm that all asap. You will burn out on this game super fast, you will only farm isk instead of doing fun things that cost isk.
---
Im very new to eve so i was in brand new bros. I was afraid of making mistakes mostly
---
Yea, its not like everyone knew the terms of the mutual defense treaty that would come into play if northern supers moved south.
---
I still recall a certain mr chinchillas hysterical twitter rant about not caring if we thought you were blobbing, that you were coming to evict us.  He didn't care about the consequences, and seemingly saw no way you could lose.  It was a sure thing in pl leaderships mind.  Then you got blindsided by losing repeated supercapital engagements and failed to learn anything from the losses.
---
Its like if you go to punch a guy, and end up getting rolled.  You are crying about getting rolled, but dont want to take responsibility for starting it.
---
No, sadly girls dont like me enough.

When i started playing and was exploring the vast deepness of space, eve synth music was what gave an ambience that kept me wanting more and more. Today I still listen in souncloud most of it and it is great. And unique. I disagree with you, but hey.... you can like what you want.
---
Let me guess, you're in NC lmao
---
there's more than one way to fuck someone over, breaking deals is just one way
---
This is true
---
This is a symptom of poor game mechanics.   Change my mind.
---
&gt; ...  and I truly believe that CCP naively didn’t look forward to see how they might actually be utilized. In many ways it has dictated the meta and economy of EVE ever since.
---
When injectors hit the test server, there was some very well reasoned predictions of the present. As usual, it was blindly ignored because squeezing more golden eggs out of the goose is top priority.
---
"... but CCP need more money! They had those lay offs and they sold the game! All the other games they tried failed!"
---
What if CCP had produced posters with double sided tape for players to distribute, for example?
---
CCP marketing is and was terrible. There is no one in real life, where I have mentioned EVE and they knew what I was talking about. (I regularly attend gamer gatherings.)
---
Imagine typing out this much COPE in one post
---
I think its funny, its like you dont understand that actions have consequences and that we were not the aggressors in that war.  And that the circumstances of today are dictated by losing that war of aggression.
---
I like what you did there
---
Panfam fucked up by evicting test instead they drove test and goons together and now panfam is getting bent over the table
---
I'd love to see that. Imho Marauders should be remodeled and geared towards cap hunting. Right now they're niche ships with hardly any justification.
---
Grr Panfam, hat Panfam.
---
It's like you didn't even read their post.

Delve would be almost impossible to invade at this point. When we were CFC. We were complacent and hubris heavy. We shook it all off. Delve has been called Fortress Delve for years for a reason.

Nevermind the fact  that NCPL CAN'T HeliCap everyone anymore and poach the best and brightest. I find it amusing as a player from 04-10 and just returned in 18 that the shoe is on the other foot and ya'll can't take the advice you gave everyone that wasn't NCPL back in the day.  Heres the quote " HTFU and Git Good and adapt or die". Take your own advice and until then I hope you keep delivering Salt to Reddit.

You seem to think Skill Injectors have removed PVP.  
---
They have not.
---
Let me tell you a story.  A story that starts before Wormholes existed, before you could fly through bubbles.  A time where if you wanted a ship in a certain location, you flew there. A time where nullsec had a steep barrier to casual solo pvp, and so they roamed in low sec.
---
Why visit low sec in 2019 EvE?  
---
Travel? Nope.  Wormholes for 90% of long range travel, Jump Clone or Jump Drive for the rest.  
---
PvP?  Nope.  People didn't go to Low Sec for 'pvp', they went to Low Sec because it was not High Sec, and they couldn't get to Null Sec.  PvP happened because of Low Sec PvE.  
---
FW?  Nope.  FW is an excuse for PvP'ers to attempt to hunt PvE ships.  The FW mechanics are 'cute' and give some purpose to groups who don't fight over Sov Null.  
---
If anything, people being able to fly any ship they want with more SP, on a level SP playing field, there should be more PVP no?  
---
The fallacy here, in-case you missed it, is that 90% of 'High Skill PvP' is not really.  You just hit me with a wall of 'T1 frigs in FW space' and used it to say 'High Skill PvP is dead'...

Your fundamental misunderstanding of why PL and co. play the game is astonishing.
---
Your logic has no place in this sub, please turn yourself in to your nearest grr gon reeeeeducation facility.
---
Imagine if everyone did actual resets after wars.
---
thats a lowball estimate
---
Just because we didn't want to blue most of Eve, and remain blue, doesn't mean we were stupid. Our play style is much different than what the Imperium/Tapi narrative says it should be. You all are judging success based on "most capitals" while we're judging based on "content". We've always judged on content, whether it's going balls to the wall in B-R or utilizing Imperial Navy Slicers with Police Skins in Amamake playing Amamake police, it's all the same. The more people we blue, the less content..... Different strokes for different folks.
---
Then why do you feel necessary to give your .02? With you being in lowsec shouldnt your reeeee be focused on snuff?
---
The voices in the beginning reminded me of Cyril Figgis from the series Archer.

Question: am i going to get hated if i suggest to have the captain quarters back?
---
when did we evict test? if i remember correctly we evicted co2 from tribute and test fled vale after being told we weren't going to touch them there.  unless you're talking about some other time
---
Just remember dude, blue doughnuts and CCP did this to you, no way it was your fault, or you could have done anything differently.
---
You (yours) made the bed and now you have to sleep in it. What a pity eh?
---
I am hoping Dual Universe will pan out.
---
I got back into the game 2 months ago and I'm already leaving the game again. It's 90% of death content. I can't find anything to do, nothing is worth doing anymore. Every single content out there is simply broken by CCP or by players itself. I don't really like doing PvP, I don't find it fun, and Eve is a PvP game as others say, which is sometihng I disagree. Unfortunately CCP doesn't know how to do PvE game, which is something I've been wishing was false. I couldn't find my place in the game, and many people feel the same, that's why it's dying. The game have just been simplified  into smashing ships to eachother for just no reason but filling zkillboard of green rectangles.
---
What are either of those ships
---
I've tried. Apparently there is enough Grrr Goon in my genes to make me resistant to the indoctrination. Something about having to  learn to adapt or die I think.

I also loved killah bees 'dont talk to those front-line FCS they don't know what's actually going on' line i hope it's just spin because if its true even the 'leadership' in Panfam is shitting on the people they are relying on to keep them alive at this point
---
Yeah gosh imagine joining a newbro alliance like BRAVE and then deciding to go to PL once you had a titan wonder why you'd do something silly like that
---
&gt; This leads new players to perceive EVE as pay2win
---
not to mention everyone and their mum having 3 accounts and 8 alts.  That IS pay to win.
---
Idk who they are but they do own a lot of the he poco's
---
Yes.
---
Boring.

---
You won the internet!
---
That is around 36-31 hours of pve every month to earn a plex. 1+ hour of pve every day. I'd spend real money instead...
---
&gt;  Im truly confused how CCP didn’t see this as game breaking. Skill  injectors, skins, rorq seems to me they were trying to close the books  with eve. 
---
That's the problem; they KNEW it was game breaking.  If they somehow didn't figure it out themselves, EVERYONE told them exactly how it was going to play out.  The clencher?  They  don't give a fuck.  All they care about is the quick buck from the whales, not the health of the game.  They have been this way openly ever since they started fishing for a buyout.  Now that they're owned by Shit Abyss, this line of thinking is more common, if anything.  None of this is going to happen because it hurts CCP's short term  bottom line.
---
Devs have to do something about that or the game is toast.

Your electricity bill running your computer is more likely more than that. You might be actually losing money :D
---
Where was this anti killboard shit when every couple mins there was a delve kill linked? Oh that's right haha this is completely different now right
---
In theory he's not wrong.  In reality, CCP doesn't actually invest any of this money back into EVE, it goes into even MORE failed projects, so its a lose/lose.
---
World War REEEEeeeee: Hello Serenity
---
But in seriousness, not enough will leave delve with shiny ships to do this quickly... except to schlep them elsewhere for sale. it will happen... across years
---
Can you share the fit?
---
Not quite.  Skill injectors accelerated it, but terrible design decisions and lack of forethought from CCP, along with a glacial pace for any changes are the actual cause, not injectors.  They just make it so much more obvious that CCP's design method is crap.
---
Really, I think a lot of people would have been happy with the ability to define corp or alliance paint schemes based on coloring in predefined patterns.
---
I don't know about you, but I can't make money PVPing.  WHich means I need something to keep the isk coming in, and the most effective way I know of, that is reasonably accesible is PvE, be it comlexes, ratting, or whatever.  
---
There's also the issue of logistics.  If I lose my lil pvp frig on a small group roam, its 10-20 jumps back home, which is another 10-20 to market.
---
Seems everyone else has a scout alt, a cyno alt, a freighter alt, an industry alt, etc.
---
&gt; the instant gratification generation.
---
The issue isn't the instant gradification generation, the issue is the instant $$$ gratification CCP CEO/Investors.
---
The game will die sooner because of the Imperium and then you guys will pretend to have no clue as to why it died
---
&gt;Volta/WH Groups: Emperor. You are almost always disadvantaged to your enemies you must use specialized tactics and intel to achieve victory when outnumbered and outshipped.
---
lol, imagine having trouble killing stuff with a teleport spawning generator in the same system as your staging invincible npc station.
---
You're as unimportant as it gets in eve unless you're a high level fc/leadership member. Your pulse and functioning ability to move a mouse are the most significant parts of your membership in the Imperium.
---
&gt; frigate and be just as skillpoint competitive
---
I just checked, a lvl 5 cert(as good as it gets) for a t1 frig is over a year.
---
I can confirm SASH is bad that's why we all meet up IRL and have lasting relationships over years.
---
Unless you get purged. Heretic.
---
Can't wait to see my bro's again at eve Vegas while we make out and circle jerk about killing all our alliances while our CEO "paves the way" for us for a few months.
---
Well your post defined  what type of player you are in eve. What you just type is like you never were successful at figuring out pvp. Seems to me the only thing you were good at was skilling for a doctrine fit, listen to commands form an FC, align, keep and range, and press F1. Im not bashing you for it, im just saying their is a lot more to eve,. From what you types, it doesn’t seem like you were able to figure out the basics. 
---
What i typed was my player experience on how i came from nothing to becoming a extremely good solo/pvper. How I started from the bottom and slowly ground my way up. Null sec pvp definitely isn’t elite. Most elite organizations were formed in lowsec to begin with. Its where you learn the mechanics, its where you find other people trying to learn the same mechanics. If where you find the people that already know mechanics and maybe they will thrown you a bone. After they killed you 10 times. 
---
To sum it up, what YOU think is elite pvp (N+1 F1 monkey) is not what majority of the elitist think.
---
TIL WWB was NCPL vs Goons and GotG, Legacy, Tri+friends low sec Voltron, and about a dozen other mini coalitons.
---
What you said literally has nothing to do with what that guy said anyways, aside from the fact he has an NCdot flair. Are you lost?
---
Only if you like awkward silences
---
Well that one wasn't our fault...
---
Well ok that was one kinda...
---
Ok and maybe that one...
---
TRI definitely wasn't though
---
Snuff....well, I'm working on it. Give me time to kill them

Please elaborate, because the only thing that sticks out is PL and company's perpetual need to chase after weaker alliances for "content" and farming.
---
Then making the pikachu face when those allianced picked on for years decide to group up and fight back.
---
Finally followed by morale posting on r/eve and whining about the good old days when y'all could pick on smaller groups with impunity.

I like the ship n skin, down voting because of the screenshot it's bad, and you should feel bad

well at 4.30am, half asleep, on an alpha, i just fed a rattlesnake to a minor conduit.

so, not a battleship, using an alpha account, very early in the morning.

It's been called that for almost 15 years, I don't think Goons moving in is why that term was coined.
---
Although there's sure of a hell of a lot more weight behind it now.
---
We wouldn't have as much trouble if people actually undocked :/
---
Well, I’m curious on how long eve will last. Will it die? I don’t think so, there are games like WOW. I literally don’t understand why you would want to play that game. Yet, millions of people do world wide. For anyone that wants something close to eve, Albion online is mediocre. Biggest thing Albion has is content and semi balanced pvp gameplay. Graphics are hideous though.
---
Clearly you just didn't believe yourself hard enough.

Got some fits? Just skilled into it.

Drones maybe ought to be revamped the way astrometrics was... Once upon a time you had to train up to 8 probes. Maybe making drones I get you all 5 drones, but it takes drones V to get them to full firepower and durability.

But gosh its so UNFAIR, ccp should do something ;____;

Create an entry in Keypass like you do for a website and just put them in the notes section.  You can leave the User name, Password, and URL sections blank...  That's how I saved all my Eve account's info.  Also, use Authy like other people said.  If you already use Google auth or similar, you can go into your Eve account online, display the QR code (Account/Authenticator settings/Display QR code) and take a picture of the QR code with Authy to add it.

Well pl fighting neighbors saying its good times dont worry may cause a bit of a problem.

Thats a huge misconception. You don’t need the same size nor bigger ship to kill someone. If you play it right, you can kill ships that are far more superior than you.

Not lost. Enjoying the salt that's flowing from any NCPL whine that appears on here. And the fact that he said it cant be done now because of " excuses". I'm sorry again you must have missed the part where I was one of those players that got told " HTFU and Adapt or die" by NCPL players back in the day. The fact that they can't heliCap anyone and have resorted to becoming the joke they are these days is funny to me. It is funny because they chose not to "adapt or die". I live in NPC null where I get dropped by Caps some days or Small Gang fights the others. I've adapted and moved on to parts of the game I enjoy.
---
 I do not disagree about some of the problems in this game. Cap Prolif, Rorqs being the best mining ship instead of boosters, unlimited injectors without controls except personal wallet. Citadels need to be able to be killed faster. Asset Safety needs to go away. I do not claim to have all the game knowledge to begin to know where to start or go about those changes anymore. Those are the biggest problems I see. But we saw problems with certain playstyle back in my early years of this game that had the same kinds of dampening on playstyles and nothing was done about it until the meta changed and people adapted.
---
I would say it's a symptom of everyone blueing each other. If most of the players in any game were all in one group/collective then of course this will happen.
---
This is a symptom of one entity shitting on every other alliance in the game and blaming ccp when they group up to get revenge crying the games dead
---
Excuse me that doesn't fit the blue donut narrative please refrain from making further comments

I mean at this point anyone tapirium attacks is weaker, so i guess your logic applies to them, too

Quit reading reddit “articles” and you’ll be fine
---
As someone who has never really played eve, how does it feel to play around in space like this? I come from wow but it has definitely lost my interest. The idea of a player driven environment is super appealing, but I have heard that eve is like playing Microsoft excel and I feel like the learning curve would keep me from actually being able to participate in the larger picture of the game
---
Yes, you can. Takes about 15-20min.
---
Suggesting futility?
---
Wonders were possible with panfam support, wonders i tell you! 
---
I'm sure people who planned this shares your laugh, for the footwork you did and people and sov they will get.
---
Me too had few laughs about colosal stupidity of beforementioned idiots, although for different reasons.
---
"NC/PL: Prince you have to actually play the game" Hence why they aren't doing so well.
---
I wasn't tell you in particular, just saying there's a lot of things you can do. My apologies if I sounded rude.
---
You do know if you live in thera like any non-shit group, you die back to thera right?  With those invincible npc stations I mentioned.  The ones your little tiny 'elite pvp' brain cannot fathom?
---
Call it what you will. I can enjoy the salt and tell them like they told us back in the day. Repeatedly. At the end of the day I'm still enjoying the game and not whining about someone not playing by my rules. The best part about it for me is I don't even have a dog in this fight. So I can sit back and relax and enjoy the game on my terms. You know I have a feeling your probably NCPL and just don't like the fact that your words are coming back to haunt you.
---
&gt; 90% of eve is knowledge\skill 9% SP
---
in pvp, absolutely.  Not so much in Industry, Science, and to a large degree PvE
---
I can't think of anything move pure eve than buying specific ads to be displayed in specific structures. Like while you are bashing some citadel force the docked defenders to watch terrible ads taunting them into space.
---
What kind of ship?
---
What he means is he is in NC, who is now living in lowsec for fear of having their shit pushed in if they gave the imperium another nullsec system to target.
---
Proof that style counts, even for assholes.
---
If FC skills don't matter how did you lose back to back to back even fights in x47? You had everything even you could hope for plus the added bonus of a keepstars weapons systems and still your shit was pushed in 3 times in a row.
---
&gt; you lose back to back to back even fights

In Soviet Russia, fights lose back to back to back even **you**!

Yes, I hear capital alpha fleet is so vogue.
---
Also when was the last time you alpha'd a dread with a dread?
---
Most players skips this sadly. Frig pvp always been one of the best ship lines in the game IMO. Yet, everyone all about faxes, supers, titans now and skill injectors gives it to them. I recently went back to flying a enyo. Boy did i miss it! Biggest ship i killed solo was a armageddon with pulses and neuts. This was right after the change to make them a drone boat/neut boat. That was the toughest fight I’ve ever had in a frig. Use to have fun with friends in my enyo when we were attacking test. I was in FA and we would anchor bubbles on a outbound gate. Sit at a perch and wait for something to get in iut trap, warp down, dunk, loot, warp off. Killed 3 battle ships at once. We had to total of 7 people in fleet, mix of T2 and faction ships. Those were the days.
---
WOW, so you're going to try and pretend doomchihuahua didn't call for  a war to evict test that involved the entire north and east of the map that backfired SPECTACULARLY at UALX? You're going to try and act like you all didn't dog pile test for a month straight and act like it made you the biggest badasses in the game right up until we stepped in and fucked up your day? Your leaders made this bed, now you get to lie in it, and the other side will continue to show no sympathy in your reddit cry threads.
---
Nice rocketship dude
---
Due to your edit I’m upvoting you out of spite.
---
bad bot
---
So it's more "nerf the other guys mining and not mine"? Anyway, but you try to park a rorq for 2 hours and forget about it. If it actually gets dropped by 120 bombers and you're not there to react right away it's dead. That's the 5b ship. The 5b drones you have out are long gone at that point, bombed or booshed. I agree that it's too easy to multibox and scales indefinitely. That part needs to be fixed first before you nerf the yield again and make it a pure boosting ship, because i find needing 40 covetor alts to be a competitive miner to be far worse balance.
---
&gt;  delegation is so important.
---
... and you can take it really far.
---
The one time, I had:
---
* one checking our route on killboards.
---
* one calling targets.
---
* one being DPS anchor.
---
* one co-ordinating tackle and scouting
---
* then I was back seat driving from logi anchor.
---
To each their own. Many small alliances got sov by grace of xix, and me, who you now renounce. Map was colorful and thriving, and it was good for everyone, including gangs and dropers. However, after many months of war, drf and dcu were tired, and ncdot choose to support skillu, and from that moment it was over. Yes, dcu who were loyal to nc were thrown under, contract with drf forefeited, in favor of stupid idea to attack test with nc,pl, tri, frt, hk and skillu, as if was not known that goons would intervene.

But thats EVE. You fought and lost, take it as a man.

GOSH WHAT PLUCKY UNDERDOGS
---
spare me
---
I think he's also under the impression goons weren't nearly about to jump in and end the fight in his favor anyway
---
I couldn't believe the post either, they felt picked on so they needed more blues,.
---
I actually quit in 2014 and have never have been in either of those groups anyways. You're sitting here talking about other people's salt, but you're so butthurt about being told to "gitgud" that you're now randomly accusing anyone who disagrees with your flawed 'logic' as being part of said entity that caused you to be butthurt to begin with, lmao
---
I can see why you were told to HTFU now
---
Provibloc is the most stable thing in eve
---
Why's that - are goons failing to post their daily talking points in the thread?
---
Work harder, slackers!
---
Dont be afraid to welp every fc has done it and its funny as fuck if you do it just right
---
Lol Test is most definitely not an underdog anymore, I don't think anyone in the alliance actually believes that.
---
I don't know, where was it? 
---
All anyone can see on Reddit these days is goons worrying about killboards and smug posting their kills.
---
Killboards clearly mean a lot to you.
---
You must not have read Vily and PGL's calls for war, which can be summarized as "everyone in the galaxy is against us and if we don't invade frt, we'll lose our space"
---
I'm not in test so no idea what you're talking about but FC skills really don't matter that much when it comes to n+1 supers
---
Pretty dope
---
it Wouldn’t be a fixed amount per hour, neither is your idea. But can still be a fixed total.
---
&gt; I'd shed pity tears too if I had to start recruiting abunch of barley competent f1 pushing krabs just to stay competitive since FC skills don't really matter in super n+1
---
So let's expand on the point that /u/querns_gsf made and rewind to X47.  There were roughly even super numbers but it was the Imperium FCs who had the foresight to dual tank their Erebuses and push them to the front, and in one case, it very clearly made the difference where an Erebus was rescued in structure.  Wasting an entire titan DD salvo in a titan fight and you can only do that so many times before the other side starts to snowball you.  
---
What's more, it wasn't the Goons who told PL to cyno in their super fleet far enough behind NC's that they were outside of DD range of the Imperium fleet.  That exchange was won on planning, and the Imperium FCs took a risk and were rewarded for it.
---
Even on roughly equal terms, NCPL got outclassed in a titan fight and paid the price for it.
---
Ahahahahahahahaha did the panfam lose their reddit army or something? Now need to resort to this or has delve just dried up so much there's nothing left to post besides losses and alt corps to avoid the red? 😂😂 let's not forget who has to transfer structures to nuetral Corp to avoid the red, or kicking players because they lost a super
---
Your not wrong they did say they were going to live out of lowsec
---
They have already lost 95% of the bitter vets.  We all left a long time ago. like 10 years ago.
---
It depends what you mean by "suggest", but probably not.
---
Everyone says the game is dying but wasn't BoB in the same situation in 2006/2009? They had like 60-70% of the map for themselves

Making the game more tedious is absolutely not the solution to any problem.

&gt;it localizes production meaning you can't pull ore from an entire region to fuel a capital building spree. so eh, it might be beneficial to stop compression?

Nope. It just means that doing it would suck more, with no other downsides except making the people doing it want to biomass.

---
Is dead. When the rest of Panfam bled to try and keep goons from burning Deklein the way that Tribute is burning now, Sort made his own separate deal. There’s plenty of spin about it but none of it adds up. Sort’s not the kind to martyr himself for others and he’d rather lead an alliance on the winning side of a war than stand with anyone who stood with him.
---
&gt; 2 mega empire : Imperium vs Panfan..
---
This should’ve been what last year was. We saw how it worked. Ironically the ones who claim to be all about vengeance are Goons, who are all too happy to forgive and forget.
---
Snuff.
---
Legacy, the ones who actually followed them into Delve and tried to kill them.
---
“Guardians is the Galaxy” for whatever that name even means now.
---
It doesn’t really matter though. The real issue isn’t about who’s bigger. It’s about who’s willing to make the play. And eventually someone else will be willing to make the play and things will change. Unlike in real life, that’s the only thing that’s actually inevitable in EVE. M

It is the solution to rorqual multiboxing and overproduction. I'm fine if active mining would mine more tho.

---
Or, alternatively, the game just changed and Goons we’re lucky to be starting from a mostly clean slate at the right time.
---
But yeah, legitimately props to you guys for recruitment and organization. It’s difficult pulling that many people together and it took some great insight to make good on the opportunity.
---
NC. And PL didn’t have that blank slate and people often aren’t interested in changing for a potential long term outcome. That’s just human nature. Of course, things will change now, on both sides.

So you get blobbed in subs?
---
Vily said half of Eve which is was basically true at the time, and I'm pretty sure PGL is just trying to trigger the shit out of people like you.
---
Lol sad.
---
In my completely unbiased opinion, you should look into E-Uni like u/LeavingaLegacy1 suggested. Also, you're not a "relatively new player" for having just finished the tutorial missions. I'm a relatively new player, having been playing for a few months. Most people have been around for years.
---
Corp ads in chat are more worthless than WoW (and I spent most of my time during my last period of playing in the largest guild on the Horde side of the largest server, which recruited me by sending out mass invites to people, so I know something about this sort of guild). Most of those are scams designed to just leech tax money off of the missions that you turn in.
---
E-Uni's main presence is in HiSec (the generalist-focused HSC, the mining-focused AMC, and the Incursions Community, the latter being end-game PVE that you don't have the skill points for yet, consider it roughly equivalent to WoW raids), but has some decent stuff going on in LowSec (LSC, although most of the people who do stuff out there are based out of HSC just a few jumps out), NullSec (NSC), and Wormhole (WHC).
---
We're at war right now, so if you do join, you'll probably have to deal with P I R A T on your way to HSC. But if you're in any corp for a decent amount of time, you'll get to experience a war with them. What they like doing is camping trade lanes and blowing up lone war targets (particularly industrial ships and others which have difficulty fighting back) with multiple high-end fancy ships like strategic cruisers, while avoiding actual fights. Sure, we've taken more losses, in both ISK and ships, than we've given out, but that's because there are a lot of inattentive, carebearish new players who don't take proper wartime precautions like using out-of-corp alt characters (preferably on a separate account) to visit trade hubs. Our standard guidelines (years ago, before I started, there were apparently some crazy rules mandating this, but it is no longer mandatory to stay docked up in wartime) are to stay docked up if war targets are in local and you are not prepared for a fight, so we don't seek out fights as often as they do. But when we gave them an actual fight two nights ago, we humiliated them. [Check out this overview of the killmails involved.](https://br.inyour.space/?s=5311&amp;b=8650320&amp;e=90&amp;t=e) Basically what happened was that they came into HSC's main system with a few fancy, expensive ships and attempted to force our research structure into reinforce (this is the first phase which would enable them to destroy it later). My guess is that they assumed that our guys who were in-system would stay docked due to our carebearish reputation, but over 40 people showed up when E-Uni comms pinged everyone that a structure was under attack, took down three of their logistics ships (think healers in WoW, the other two aren't listed in the link because they weren't on any killmails), and our total losses were less than the value of a single one of their losses. The only reason why they didn't fare worse was that the ships which people jumped into were mostly the contract ships that E-Uni provides for our PVP doctrines (damage-dealing cruisers and EWAR frigates) and we didn't have enough tackle to prevent them from escaping, so we just took down three of the cheapest ship type that they brought and convinced everyone else to be somewhere else.
---
A friend and I were tag-teaming them in Marauders the other night. Conclusion we came to was that with sufficient bling and maybe hardwirings we could probably solo them with those... but not with 100% certainty, and in any case with that kind of money we could be running filaments for better ISK.
---
But Marauders are kind of gimpy, and I bet a T3 cruiser or similar would do better. Just, you wouldn't be able to do it brain-dead.
---
Hey, so if its absolutely zero risk and you're guaranteed to win, then I challenge you to rack up 10 kills in Provi, of any Provi member, with your supercapital.
---
Reading what happened to you is painful, luckily you caught it before it was too late. 
---
Out of curiosity, when you say you saw regular activity from a digital ocean ip what do you mean by that? You found suspicious packets with wireshark or something else?
---
Poaching is a two way street, querns. Stop it :)
---
Better than being blobbed in caps, also subs don't have a 10 second response time to fleets within a 6ly radius or faster lock times than battleships.
---
The blue donut is almost complete  and the way of the Chinese server as begun..
---
When Eve shuts down soon coz boredom, Provi will still be running on the official Provi Server.
---
Yeah, this would be a Safe. It doesn't (as far as anyone knows) leave the system, and so long as nobody touches it nobody gets hurt. Safe/Euclid/Keter has nothing to do with how much harm it can theoretically do, but how much harm it will do if left alone.
---
Serenity is almost come to fruition, the sooner goonperium finishes this the sooner I can find a new game and not pay subscription fees anymore. My damn wife roots for goons and all she knows is they are invading and close to ending the server lol
---
&gt; You just did stupid shit continuously until you put the game into the current state.
---
  Imagine if PL/NC stayed allied to TEST/CO2 and GOTG- and kept the pressure up on the Goons...
---
&gt; Post WWB, MBC disbanded and people went neutral with each other,
---
  Yeah, PL and NC went neutral with TEST and CO2- while buddying up with GOTG.
---
Did exactly this when I got a new phone. Accounts were all reset to 2fa within 2 hrs.
---
&gt; Instead panfam supers and horde subcaps came to save them from a TEST only deployment.
---
realistically it was more like panfam supers came to dunk tapi
---
we really didn't give a shit about sort, and mostly never have, but you deployed like a mid away from our staging so what were we supposed to do, *not* shoot you?
---
to take a similar page from the book of eastern european machismo ~ * poetics * ~, would you rather exist in name or in essence

oh wait, that's already been answered on both counts

Sounds like you need to leave bro.

Move on, challenge yourself 🤷🏻‍♂️ unless you enjoy tidi blobs

Let us fight GotG instead of coming to the defense of half the map?

Or at least stop crying about our blues when you do the same shit.
---
NC fighting in t1 dessies what a time to be alive. Mordus Angels would be proud.
---
jester's recent AMA actually sheds light on a favourable answer to this. according to him the wake of that was one of the rare and major periods of revitalisation in for-the-sake-of-the-game priorities within CCP's decision-making structure.
---
i've never had a problem with requiem and brave coming to tapi's aid
---
it's bending the knee and merging legacy and goons into one megacoalition with 2/3 of null's population under one banner that i take issue with
---
Old players creating alts.  Dont get excited..
---
&gt; 2/3 of null's population
---
You say that, but I've rarely seen a fight where the north or Fraternity are outnumbered 2 to 1, and I've seen just as many go the opposite ratio.
---
Goons are a bunch of krabs.  The numbers are more even than you make them out to be.
---
But yeah, goons absolutely have more supers than anyone.  They had a huge head start on krabbing, and you guys believe mining is beneath you.
---
So limit the number of forts in a system
---
&gt;I don't know, where was it?

An industrial ship of any size intended for mining should not output more dps than most battleships under any circumstances while also repping like a fax.
---
It doesn't rep like a fax. It has the range but not the power.
---
All of time is a cycle. What was, is, and will be again.
---
Was referring to self rep, it shouldn't get bonuses to outgoing reps either though.
---
To start they could display some of the stuff from my old captains quarters big screen! :)
---
i killed an atron in amarr lowsec who traded for a random logibro i made friends with that was chilling at the sun.
---
content acquired, 10/10 fit.
---
It’s still pretty straight forward, but you need to kill stuff before everything ramped up in the room. Soloed a couple of minors in an adjacent system with my Loki when the majors spawned (so fleets were distracted ;). My main issue was to catch Zorya’s Leshak when I miss her directly after spawn. But luckily you can combat probe the trigs and warp in sites.
---
You are retarded
---
Actually I left in 10 for real life issues. Just returned last year. I dont disagree with some of the problems and I play for my enjoyment. Just find it funny about the whines that go on now. Enjoy winning Eve. I did until i got sucked back into it. I like the game more now simply because I play on my own terms.
---
That's simply not how it works. 2fa is something on top of a normal password. It's never less secure than without.
---
Also  eve's 2fa works in a way that you need physical access to the phone. Since it doesn't rely on internet it is not prone to man in the middle. Neither are sms based ones btw. Unless you have a mobile transmission mast, which are not exactly easy to get or use.
---
Reminds me of [SCP-4335](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4335). Pretty good
---
such as... FCON XIX DEATH AND SOLAR EMPIRE, the true bastion of the 'little guys' for sure...
---
Taking that attention shoting moron seriously lmao
---
Big mistake
---
When a Citadel is anchored they should give you a choice of the racial design.
---
Wouldn't require massive changes as the interiors for them are already made for empire and NPC null stations.
---
We at least would have some variety then.
---
I did suggest trickier. My issue was suddenly my Kronos couldn't do anything because I couldn't hit out to 40km. Also I know some Iki pilots that say they could solo it before but now they can't I think I may try mine in there again
---
Scenario/context at that time:
---
GoTG was your buddy too at time if you remember. He wasn't buddies with Co2. When co2 and ncpl went to war, it's technically his buddies having a war with a non-buddy. It's simple for him, but then TAPI jumps in to fight with Co2.
---
You guys then tried to get him to fight for his non-buddy over buddy. So what are you even talking about?
---
But my personal opinion:
---
Sort doesn't gives two fucks about his 'buddies'. He goes towards the side he thinks is going to be stronger. He will switch the moment he feels his current side is weak and will actually wait where the position will become so intenable on his switch that his buddies can't really do much and oh it will be sly, there will be whole plethora of reasons, I'm sure he had a few for you guys too.
---
I get frequent disconnects on random clients. No matter if I have one or several or excessive clients open, each night a different pilot seems to get their connection ECMd at random for hours while the others stay connected fine.
---
I usually recommend getting the meteor pack off ccps website. Trips all three rewards.
---
I know I am making friends up north by helping them move....  removing one structure at a time.
---
They came here because their game died with an entire blue nullsec owned by PIBC, ironic that they are now in the same position and occupying almost the same space as they were 2 years ago before they lost. Immediately following this 80% of serenitys player base dropped over the next 15 months.. We know exactly how it ends,  with 8k player weekend peaks in winter 2020.
---
Wrong, all it shows is that majority isn't interested in challenging or fun gameplay and is going to be content with being one of The 1k attackers on a kill, while rock munching during downtimes
---
What CCP says and what CCP does are very different things
---
Vince I'm trying to hide my vulnerability timers but I'm dummy thicc and the clap from my ass cheeks keeps alerting the goons - NC. keepstars
---
I am sure they will patch it in the game asap, just like Logi on killmails.
---
Its like you just ignore how much Panfam bled for GOTG.
---
You are correct, "Fortress Delve" was a BoB thing. I don't know though whether it was them or their enemies who came up with the term.
---
I dont really have problems with fittings or anything, but that i am like never happy with the outcome and it still takes horrendous amounts of time to fight a fight, where you dont have something unkillable on the dscan. 
---
What am i doing wrong?
---
I do it like this: i get into some t1 frigate, i go to sosala, kamela, kourmonen and amamake, i go in a novice site and wait, when i have something unkillable on dscan, i run to next system and i do this till i get something i can fight, or think i can fight...
---
are there better places for this solo t1 frigates?
---
frigates i use: brawl atron, brawl incursus, mwd kite condor, armor dual web merlin... i actually try to use them all...
---
Point still stands, the only people that evicted Test so far were the CFC.
---
A very blinky T3C or cap booster fit Battleship
---
I’m going full brawl, my ACs with help of web make short work of frigs and dessies luckily orbiting very close. Kill webs, scram first, and then you are safe. Sometimes I had to kill the extra neuts, while hugging Zorya with Hail. This beast neuts you pretty hard.
---
Wow you do way better than me! I make money with low sec and null exploration but it's slow and I don't get that much (~10M/hour)
---
Why not?
---
The fortizar clearly flies with the undocks on the port side.
---
Clearly an Iteron.
---
next thing they'll make some sort of clusterfuck coalition :O
---
Great perspective and seems like good advice.
---
From another perspective: the newbie friendly nullsec mega corps have a lot of institutional knowledge and resources available for a new player. Th fact that they are large also pretty much ensures people active in your timezone which is probably difficult to ensure in a small corp.
---
the main ones are Brave Newbies(Legacy), Karmafleet (Goons), Brand Newbros(TEST, Legacy), Eve University (independent and not a major nullsec entity)  and my own group Pandemic Horde (Panfam). Personally I chose Horde because they had a reputation for being more pvp focused and also seemed to emphasise self reliance and independence.
---

Use Authy its better :) [https://authy.com/](https://authy.com/)
---
That's something a smart cookie would say.
---
This has turned into basically an FC advice thread, so I'll post the advices I've benefited from the most:
---
* Try to be as pleasant with your fleet as possible. We're all adults playing this video game for fun, at the end of the day. If one of your fleetmates fucks up, and you make his life miserable as a result, there's a 100% chance that fleetmate isn't going to fly with you again. If you're a wormholer as you say, getting your corpmates to log in and join your fleets is paramount. Make it a pleasant experience, even if you don't do any shooty-shooty. Thank your corpmates who make sacrifices to help the fleet publicly. Stuff like that.
---
* Learn from your mistakes. There's nothing more aggravating than an FC who makes the same mistake twice. If someone has a piece of advice, listen to them. 
---
* Reacting to changes on a grid. If you're winning a destroyer v. destroyer fight and a super cynos in on grid and you don't notice it, you're going to lose your fleet to it. Obviously that's an extreme example, but you need to be sure that you're not tunnel visioning on your fleet's targets and that you have a good awareness of the larger picture of a battle. 
---
It goes without saying that the most important rule when playing this game is: have fun! Try and have fun, and even if you guys get memed by goon supers or what have you, try and make it a fun experience for the people who decided to spend their time coming on your fleet. Good luck!
---
*slow clap* the timing is so hard to get right
---
Panfam is literally an entity who prides itself on shitting on the weak and telling people to 'get gud and adapt' and its failed to follow it's own advice now qqing that it's ccps fault
---
No, you've got it. NC/PL were so fucking smug when evicting CO2/TEST from Tribute/Vale that it's fun to watch this.
---
Its amazing how a losses and backstabbed can just be 'forgotten' by the line members lol then they wonder why everyone hates them,' durr hurr they just want a blue donut we did nothing wrong!' 😂
---
This is such bullshit. We were getting camped by panfam caps in VFK after the CO2 keepstar died. We fought together with Co2 for the north and lost to the overwhelming panfam (supercap) power.   
---
Then, you tried it again in your retarded invasion with every ally you could muster, hoping for a one sided war again.
---
Lol imagine thinking a bunch of mindless spodbrains who aren't self sufficient without a super umbrella sitting in a bunch of injected in one day titan alts are the same thing as a veteran battle hardened comparatively small group of elite players who actually took the time to train into their skill intensive ships and have years of experience and can make isk without a super umbrella.  I sure as hell can't.
---
Is it possible to change a few files and turn these displays into, ahem, a video of your choice as with the CQ screen?
---
I'm Yuri, not Rolo, but I will tell him you miss him :D
---
Oh tell Crystal we voted him and wish him best luck for CSM^^
---
You can fight a subcap blob with ewar, booshing, bombs, counter-comps, better maneuvering, bubbles to split them etc. Capitals you can only fight by bringing more capitals because they're immune to all that. The design is fundementally shit.
---
Thats why my first plan would be to limit the number of runs per system and not per structure ;)
---
&gt;Devs have to do something about that or the game is toast.
---
What can they do besides a complete reset? CCP killed their own game with skill injectors and allowing citadels to be spammed everywhere. The only thing I can think of that might save eve is a second fresh server with no skill injectors and limit the amount of citadels per system.
---
I used to think you might just be dumb. Now I'm making sure you get a handicapped sticker for parking.
---
By this retarded logic, the imperium evicted themselves during WWB. Because the war was over after a few fights and the rest was taken uncontested.
---
yeah but "few friends and lots of enemies" sounds pretty great. what's sad is that those enemies want to have as many friends as possible and as few enemies as possible. game gonna die, bro
---
Does no one understand how the Last great war will happen? The guns will turn south again.
---
&gt; ncdot choose to support skillu
---
You're correct if "support" means "stay out of the conflict", yeah.  Not a single NC/PL/PH fleet was ever on the field with skill urself against DRF/DCU.
---
&gt; take it as a man
---
It looks like you, my ex-rentlord friend, could use some of this good advise of yours.
---
Am I wrong or would this defeat the purpose of having an authenticator?
---
Provi isn't participating in any big war. They just batphone to survive against the other bigblobs
---
blue donut bla...
---
Wow.  What a bunch of crap.  These ass hats are supposed to be some kind of wunderkinds, and now they suck ass.  Give me a break.  I don't care who the fuck this Barra asshole is.  He is a douchebag in my books.  Go and play WoW, you fucking loser.
---
It's less about the size and more about the services that comes with it. A SIG for everything you wanna do is something not many alliances can offer...
---
Yeah that's fair. For me it's mostly just... While NCPL definitely needed to be taken down a peg, they haven't been the oppressive boogieman for a while now. And at this point I just see it as "At what cost?", so when I see people snugging about it, all I see is the celebration of the death of PvP... Over the equivalent of what amounts to a large gang beating up and mugging some mildly racist, senile old war veteran.
---
if you open the launcher and click the hamburger menu for settings in the top right, you can check the box labeled 64-bit there.
---
In the top right corner of the launcher is the settings.
---
Within them is a check box that should allow you to switch out the client to 64 bit.
---
But why krab?
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/ps7mbt/the-eve-online-64-bit-open-beta-is-now-live
---
I really doubt many people would move to a brand new server with no skill injectors. I've been training skills for 7 years now to get to where I can fly anything I want and do nearly anything I want. It's a bit of a sunk-cost-fallacy, but I wouldn't play if I had to start from zero again. I've done pretty much everything in Eve enough for a fresh start to not really be that interesting any more. I stick around for the people these days, trying some crazy doctrines just to have some fun together.
---
With a new server you would still get a bunch of Imperium going in and building a massive empire because of safety in numbers. And it would be even easier for them because they wouldn't be starting on a back foot - everyone would start from zero, and the largest alliance would build unassailable wealth the fastest once again.
---
It's more pity, really.
---
i didn't say 2/3 of null's pvpers. i said 2/3 of null's population
---
if y'all have trouble translating all those j4g numbers into fleet numbers, that's a you problem, lol
---
I mean, thats usually it. You're assuming, though, that something is unkillable - never underestimate the inexperience of other pilots. Just because someone is flying an AT ship doesn't mean they know what the hell they are doing with it or know how to fit it, and they'll lose to an algos (yes, that happened).
---
Always take the fight, especially in cheap T1 frigates. Worst case scenario you lose 12-15mil; best case you get some shiny loot to fund the next 10.
---
Well i guess instead of being mindless F1 monkey's the player base could change EVE but that would require you to think for yourselves, instead of being lead around like sheep. Break away from the big blocks and start some thing new mmmmm. The big blocks are only there because you are in them want to stop them? Leave, they cant do anything without you.
---
You should check out the official eve forum and look into the market place, they will be sold there public or just check out the ingame contracts
---
Some people play EvE like cookie clicker
---
You can't alternate CSM ballots this year
---
So your champaign is kinda late
---
Well at this point in time I dont really see those boards much. I have to spend hours at a time grinding these days just to plex my account so I'm mostly in space.  
---
Fucking bots causing all this fucking isk inflation.
---
This one, dopey. Do try to keep up.
---
/r/evefactionbpcsellorders
---
IDGI, Eve is well known for having some of the worst PvE design in MMOs.
---
One can only imagine hedliner thinks about this every night while he cries in the shower
---
Then you are blind as well as salty, because for weeks all you've seen on this cess pit of a reddit page has been 'lululul we've killed anouther super/titan in delve we've won the isk war get dunked goons'
---
Good lord... ID on that dnb roller?
---
Neat bot
---
We got a victim here.
---
&gt; With a new server you would still get a bunch of Imperium going in and building a massive empire because of safety in numbers. And it would be even easier for them because they wouldn't be starting on a back foot - everyone would start from zero, and the largest alliance would build unassailable wealth the fastest once again.
---
In other words rip eve?
---
That's exactly what I said, Panfam lost allies because panfam are panfam.
---
And 2 mega empire is always better than 1 mega empire
---
For sure, and for some reason it still doesn't seem to discourage hardcore krabs.
---
Imagine if a dead alliance build more titan than you have active numbers in 3 years and you, when you see it move to your space act like that pikachu meme
---
Fludry - Wild Winds
---
&gt; Fludry - Wild Winds
---
Thanks man. Sounds like some old Tech Itch or Ewun.
---
You know, break the goddamn titan wars? Create new ships with huge bonuses against titans only? Return the time required for titan production to the point we had 3-4 years ago? Just blatantly nerf them? There is plenty of ways.
---
Who's your PL alt since you know so much about us?
---
I was wrong- For Google there's a way to transfer the code generators to a new phone. Or you can save a master key somewhere safe to get access.
---
Which is why only the smoothest brains are attracted to (human run) pve in eve.
---
We only have a blue donut because NCPL refused to blue us &gt;:(
---
How do we keep EVE alive is the question here.
---
\&gt; Bergmann
---
\&gt; no [Steigerlied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUhwJJxpFGY)
---
Was already in bed, watching some youtube. See that pic in my subs. Yelled waifu, screamed litteraly. Hope this will work man!
---
Just continue to not understand anyone else.
---
I keep wanting to come back to this game, but I've never really found a 'niche' I've fit into. I've been vaguely playing since 2012, but with huuuuge breaks inbetween. I'm not even that good at anything in the game, but I love the idea and atmosphere of everything to ever leave it alone for too long. Probably need to find a good corp or something
---
Lets not kid ourselves here. We both know ccp aint gonna do any of the above instead they will go the opposite route and continue to turn eve in to another theme park mmo.
---
First, relax prior to calling for the fleet.  Bring extra nanite paste in case you need to hand it out. 
---
I like to commit to coming home via medical clone so that survival is a pleasant surprise.
---
Nah, we are dead lol
---
Meh not here to be early and pre paid vote brigade that is worthless for health of the game. Ask Brisc if lobbyists are worth a shit when money runs out. He can probably tell you why retards like Tim Ryan continue to fleece their district when they have zero chance or drive to follow through with anything over the past 6 years. If you can bullshit your way through middle school and know Jim Trafficant you’re probably Tim Ryan
---
That's some mittani level spin right there ;) I left the CFC because I was fed up of the bullshit that they spew, it isn't a narrative. The amount of absolute crap that came out of the leadership was epic.
---
&gt;DO things that aren't fun in your free time!
---
Sounds dope fam, gonna inject 34 rorq alts tomorrow.
---
I join Brave Newbies. Good move !
---
What the fuck are you on about? Do you know how alpha works? Just because it doesn't happen doesn't mean it's not possible - the Eve mechanics make it possible. Also, how in your mind Leshaks/Triglavians fit into this? Compare the damage output for a Leshak and a dread. Just because smaller groups use the damage spool up of Trig ships to gank caps doesn't mean Triglavians are the ultimate, best of the best in any situation.
---
Oh, and when was the last time a dread was alpha'd by Leshaks?
---
Yeah and last time fortress delve took like a year to crack with only POSes to destroy.
---
Promoting the viability of guerilla warfare. Make dreadbombs more viable by either balance changes of the ships itself, or by discouraging the idea of one central staging point of all them superz.
---
Guristas ships are great to fly as an alpha, most of their bonuses are in their trait so it doesn't matter if skills are a bit low.
---
We would still be talking about the blue donut. :thinking:
---
It's the loading circle for stopping subscriptions lmao.
---
But seriously, we are currently in a bad spot. Conflict in null is dead, and if people (especially the south) don't start resetting their long list of allies soon, it will stay that way.
---
The last war took place under a system where sov control could be gained for an entire system in 4 timers, that could happen any day of the week. You now have 300+ timers just for 1DQ, that can only happen on a 4 hour period on tuesday.
---
Nice reading of what I said, your comprehension of the issues are obviously a huge factor in your success in addressing these issues, kudos.
---
It didn't download for me until I pick the beta option in the drop down.
---
You know what's even better than 2 mega empires? 5 mid sized ones. Or 50 small ones.
---
Yeah have fun with all that wealth and strength you built. What are you gonna use it for?
---
Some of it may just be salt...but it's also becoming clear that some seriously negative things are happening in the game, beyond the usual decades-long refrain that "eve is dying". 
---
Player retention is low and recruiting new blood into the game isn't sufficient compared to lost players, almost nobody invades people anymore for economic reasons, (It's fairly dubious that the goon invasion of panfam will accomplish anything), most of nullsec appears to be stagnating and small groups are simply dying out. The health of the game appears to be in serious jeopardy to anyone honest enough to read into it.
---
How dare do you add Stain to this blue bog?
---
In other words- As long as a single coalition exists: It's a blue donut.
---
because that is the safest thing to do ever. 
---
/s
---
I'm nowhere, I quit about half a year ago already and actively trying to persuade others not to make the mistake of playing this game.
---
Hmmm that hits the spot, cheers!
---
Although I agree about skill injectors being cancer for the game.
---
Until recently I was seeing ads for INFAMOUS alliance on a daily basis.  They disbanded (technically) in 2016.
---
" no exponentially scaling costs or logistics issues. "
---
With respect, it gets complicated servicing/fueling and monitoring over 1k citadels, jumpgates, and associated structures.  Add in popping moons, and managing ACLs and propper security, leases and other admin overhead.  For a large entity like the one I belong to it takes a dedicated operations team, admin, taxes, and members feeding it. Judging by the number of low power citadels I see in eve, I think it is not as easy for some.
---
I do think a limit on citadel mass per system would be a nice limit to impose.  It would require thought as to what to drop and where but allow for flexibility on the part of the dropping alliance/corp/individual.
---
Eve has always been a sub based game.
---
If you dont have money to play a game thats intended to be played using a sub, then dont play. You Will quit before you make enough money to get a plex. Its over 2bill. 
---
Get a job, subscribe and stop being cheap.
---
so that's basically captains quarters without the walking...
---
You should probably retract that statement I have ties to goonswarm leadership and could get your corp kicked.
---
&gt;allow for greater empire density
---
Might have overshot there quite a bit.
---
I used to play years ago and forgot everything.
---
I have a new char skilled into explo and made my first 12mill isk today which is nice. I plan on staying for a while to afford an astro.
---
Ign:Noctizzle if you wanna say hello!
---
They did follow their own advice by qutting years ago. Pretty much all you've got left are a bunch of dudes poached from GOTG/other Northern alliances living under the PL name.
---
Because many people don't care about killboard or don't play for pvp.
---
For example I always played for reaching my objectives, and pvp never been one of those, I like it in alliance and on big scale and I hate it in small scale or solo.
---
I've used them on occasion and will again. But then my main is training to do most things, I don't want to need 458 alts to fit any given role. I have subcaps, caps, PI, mining all on the same char. If I'm flying my carrier, why should I be forced to wait a couple of months for Fighters V, instead of using ratting income to take a week or two off that? I don't want to be punished for starting the game at a later date than someone else, or having fewer alts than them to train separate skill trees concurrently. 
---
Injectors themselves aren't bad. If they're removed, multi disciplinary pilots will suffer, as will new alts you're trying to get up to speed. 
---
Not everyone started the game a decade ago with a certain skill plan in mind for that particular character. Injectors and extractors help with this. Of course someone spending £500 to get to a carrier on day one is excessive, and a different issue entirely, but hey that's likely an easy kill, so it's a great source of revenue for CCP and they won't remove it.
---
Don't bother trying to reason with a dinobrain.
---
People Are dumb as fuck. You forøget that buying injectors to skill up a capital toon cost billion of isk. New players dont have that unless they pay big money irl. I dont know anyone Who has enough isk flow to just inject toons left and right. And Who Even Cares? So what if someone spends Bill injecting fax alts, thats just more content to blow up! Stop being retarded
---
&gt;One injector per week, at max
---
This isn't a bad idea tbh
---
Your right but what did you nerds do ?  You were blue to test then you took a payout poached the super and titan pilots and anyone else with talent then you set test red after.   You came to fountain to defend test against goons then you stabbed them in the back.
---
this is the correct answer, corp ads lie, zkill doesnt
---
Sounds like it's more of a *you* problem, lol.
---
lol Solitude is in the blue doughnut?
---
For sov purposes provi is easentially blue to imp legacy
---
Part of why everyone came together for WWB was that they saw that they *could* hurt goons with this massive force. Is that really still the case? Goons have roughly equal amounts of titans and super as the rest if the game combined by now. They make up close to, if not already, half of the null population. Citadel and current sov mechanics also heavily favour the defender. 
---
Point is, a WWB-type scenario would be an **equal** fight.
---
thx, I didn't now that
---
You are right. Some people blame players but player / alliance behaviour and culture follows from game mechanics / rules / drivers
---
We've almost gone full blue donut. The prophecy was true. It is the end times.
---
Because the super pilot will always be alone and the dread pilot can escalate on numbers on grid indefinitely...... At the point the super pilot realises he has a problem, he lights his cyno and drops 5 dreads on the grid to murder the solo dread and wait for the other side to escalate whilst pinging for fc\_fam/his mum or whomever to form all the things.
---
I am really impressed by the way you turn the facts :-D nobody in ncpl gives the slightest shit about what you move, what you destroy or whatever. so pls stop posting your below average goon propaganda in threads where some random guys who probably aren't even a member of panfam try to open a discussion about the stagnation of nullsec gameplay
---
Oh no not highsec!
---
In all warfare, combat favors the defender.
---
Some people dont and put the onus on players / alliances. You cant. You cant blame chess / starcraft / dota / cs go players for how they play if it results in ‘ winning’ within the context of the game. Ultimately the game design / mechanics must drive player behaviour in interesting and engaging directions, even in a ‘sandbox’. CCP really needs to adress a host of issues, and right quick
---
Then maybe it's time whats left of the tattered leadership over there realise that and let it die imo
---
I remember that thread. I'm not exactly a pro at this game, and haven't flown caps for long at all, but why wouldn't you do more research before fitting a 17bil ship that poorly?
---
Hell I'm still looking up carrier fits all the time in case I stumble on something I missed the first 15 times I looked them up, and I can buy 8+ fully fit ones with the money you lost.
---
Game mechanics are the issue.
---
I can agree on most highsec corps being trash. They just shove random newbies into an asteroid belt and have him train Quitting Level 5 in the long run. When I ran a highsec corp, which sadly didn't last very long due to outside influence, I highly encouraged newbies to explore the game their way, actively giving them advice and providing them with other resources if my own experience didn't cover. The tax was mostly reinvested in a small scale SRP, which applied when someone went to lowsec or nullsec. I didn't tell them to stay out of lowsec, I told them hold for a minute so they could learn about dscan and then go ahead.
---
I had fun at being in this role to be honest.
---
That's also why I never joined a big block. I look at their numbers and don't see a spot for me.
---
In MacOS you have to go to the preferences and select ‘Run clients with 64 bit” and click ‘oK’.
---
I have been playing actively for a year now and I am currently trying to get seriously involved with some of the more hardcore stuff we offer and I never felt the need to inject. You also aren't nearly as limited as you think you are. I am currently getting close to 20 mil SP and I can fly almost any subcap amarr hull, and probably around 70 % of the other lines. Sure that isn't all the super specific skills maxed out, but it is good enough to fly them decently.
---
The problem is that like you say, people are maybe less likely to do it based on the extraction of instant gratification aspect that injectors give. and that just means less people are buying plex to sell in game to by injectors. Which is probably the most common way, and this cascades down though out the market. And all falls down to CCP making a lot of money off the back of it so they will never change it
---
Everyone complains, imho this is the natural consequence, the people which best adapted to the new gameplay conquer space and who are not are leaving.
---
This should make us think about what kind of alliance is the most successful, I'm not talking about politics but the way alliances works.
---
Seems quite clear that the inclusive model in the end has won (look at PH, has never been so relevant as today) and on the other side the elitist model of alliance (PL, NC.) lost on everything.
---
Someone thought it was because krabbing and capitals (remember the "PL krabs" drama?) but it wasn't... It was about about recruiting and archive a critical mass of player and PL and NC. was absolutely against this game view, and that's stupid and that's why they lost and they'll continue to lose wherever they go.
---
It's also a was against two different way of economics.
---
On one side (PL and NC.) the parasitic way of getting isks (renting and moons on everything), on the other (Imperium, Test etc etc) an economic model based on effort (ratting, mining, moons harvest).
---
On this CCP changes on moons had a lot of influence, and for good, moons changes perhaps was one of the best ideas in the history of this game.
---
There's one factor that accelerated a lot this process, injectors.
---
That's why the only thing that could save Eve from boredom is removing injectors.
---
It's interesting that no CSM candidate afaik suggested any change on injectors, please correct me if I'm wrong...
---
Dude, now that I know you are in Legacy feel free to unironically directly contact me directly on discord, coricron #1611. You legit need advice someone in a corp who isn't *too retarded* with supers.
---
I'm new. Someone give me isk to feed my injector habit. #notbegging
---
What you describe was the display in the captain’s quarters.
---
This is at the very least giving you some additional experience in EvE PvP, and may rly get you into a nice Corp. 
---
One thing i have to add though is, that some of the more "leet" PvP Corps will require you to have the ability to fly at least of the standard ships they fly (basically like having gear on wow, just that its Skillpoints here) and to have a certain proven track-record of doing pvp (most Corps will look at Zkill for that ([https://zkillboard.com/](https://zkillboard.com/))). So its very unlikely you will get into one of thoose top of the line Corps right away. One thing i would also recommend is at least making 2-3 Alpha Accounts and start training some basic skills on them (as thats free, till you get 5m sp), as alot of the High End PvP is alot about multiboxxing, and the ability to do so will be a great bonus point for most corps. Apart from that, i wish the OP a nice time in Eve (also, if you have any questions about the game, feel free to convo me ingame, name is the same as on reddit) and hope you find a fitting home.
---
Suitonia told OP to make a referal with his (OPs) old account...just in care you really didnt get it.
---
&gt; Panfam is literally an entity who prides itself on shitting on the weak  and telling people to 'get gud and adapt' and its failed to follow it's  own advice now qqing that it's ccps fault 
---
So you are trying to tell us right now that the second panfam is "evicted" from the north, goonswarm init test the russians etc. will all end their nips they had for years although none of them was in a direct conflict with evil panfam and they will all give each other neutral standings and start wars and content?
---
Join eve uni and when you graduate you can look for a corp with same interests. Make sure the corp has some expert players who can help review your plans.
---
All those other mechanics *hinge* on spaceships blowing up all the time. Why would an industrialist build ships and modules when they never get destroyed? To look at them in his hangar? Why would a miner mine ore for the now non-existent production? Why would a ratter spin his VNI endlessly around havens when he can't spend that money on anything? 
---
EVEs gameplay mechanics are dog shit. No activity you do is hard to do in a gameplay sense. EVE is just not that game. People play for the stakes and the finality of everything. When you take that away, even the non-pvp players will quit.
---
already abandoned, better if you just forget about them
---
Then tides are turned and panfam is bitching because they dont have the biggest supercap fleet
---
So you are trying to tell us right now that the second panfam is  "evicted" from the north, goonswarm init test the russians etc. will all  end their nips they had for years although none of them was in a direct  conflict with evil panfam and they will all give each other neutral  standings and start wars and content?

do you actually believe this \*\*\*\* yourself or are you just trolling
---
The small gang sections were rather enjoyable, thanks for making this!
---
I dislike the volume of comms vs music - I can barely make out the comms, taking away mental energy from just taking it all in. Either remove comms or make them easily understandable.
---
Sounds like you're both different mangoes from the same mango tree.
---
Whatever the fuck we want tbh.
---
None of your proposed changes seems to address what I think the biggest issue is right now, which is that it's all too easy for all of Eve to show up to every timer of note. A good start would be to dumpster HACs and dumpster ansible jump gates so that people have to make actual choices as to what areas of space they want to participate in.
---
Yep,  a post about 500m isk in destroyers lost.
---
But no, plsdontpostsaboutdailyDelvesupercapslostcausethosedontmatterthxyouforkillingthem.
---
u can abyssal pvp or ship spin dawg, ur gonna need to take a vacation if you wanna kill a raitaru tho.
---
well, eve was at this stage more than one time... then suddenly, something changes and something breaks and the tables are turned again..
---
The Imperium was called endefeatable before WWB, then WWB happened and goons were evicted. The goon period with TEST right before the Fountain war, the axis was dominating New Eden, then TEST was bored and attacked... Again, the tables turned, the axis was broken.
---
Yes, currently the stakes are clear, but as long as the imperial legacy has actual wars to pursue, the cards are set. HOWEVER, boredom broke nearly every large coalition at some point.
---
Maybe the current mechanics are greatly favoring the goons. But eve is changing, and CCP is already working on making counterplays and guerrilla tactics more viable etc. 
---
Just stop whining how the game is dying because a certain coalition is currently dominating, that happened some times in the cycles of Eve. (btw, who would have bet that the DRF would fall 2 years ago? they still did)
---
you got me here. :D
---
You literally forced test to join goons by trying to evict them, you pissed deadco off by fucking them over when you(and others) paid off goons with 40 faction stations, and you're wondering why they are teaming up against you? Are you guys dense?
---
lmao, you guys really have no idea about animals isn't it?
---
Now you tell me how to catch a farmed croc?
---
talk to them and persuade to take off their skin for making your belt or handbag?
---
the same to TEST Alliance, just a farmed, little poor croc, waiting for their destiny
---
RISE TEST, don't be a pet or a farmed animal
---
Love the comments

Just like those shield slaves and module tiercide?
---
Eve is a numbers game. You need to understand the numbers. Anyone who asks a question like this has clearly not put in even a rudimentary effort to understanding them. I will respond here, but I wont go into the autism that justifies what I say - honestly, it takes maybe 1-2 hours to understand eve ship fitting. Look at those videos, done by people smarter than me, that explain it. It is way more efficient than than mining that next spod rock or botting that next fhub(hi china/panfam renters), jesus)&gt;
---
For starters, ask yourself why are you fielding a nyx in the first place: if you are ganking jump freighters who just jumped to a station/citadel you want max dps, I get that. No tank, all application and dps. You are only picking you engagements when you know you can get safe. But the people that did/do? this( is this even a thing wit citadels?) know what the fuck they are doing an aren't posting on Reddit about it like this. Nest use-case
---
So the question is why not mix tank: response: why the fuck would you? I am not here to tell you how not to be retarded. but I guess I am anyways. Your super carrier has one of maybe 3 fits (four if you got some retardo hull tank logi on standby i guess). You are armor tank(nxy obvious choice), shield tank(hmmmm, I guess you can afford a super and fit it the way you want - #JustBraveThings), or max gank - dps lows, application mids - the elite pvp dream!!!!!!!!!! what i talked about about above, or hull tank ............you fucking pyscho. 
---
These are the standard uses cases. If what you are using it for doesn't fit into this you are either dumb, or are no longer playing Eve in PL in 2010-2015. 
---
Mixing tanks makes no sense. Learn to unironically spreadsheet like 15-20 cells for dps "what if" scenarios on your tank/dps/application. You earned a Nyx -  you have time to do this. If you don't know what this means and have a Nxy - learn what the fuck a what if scenario means: [lmgtfy](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=spreadsheet+what+if).
---
I honestly don't know how I got this far without jsut saying you are retarded. I have been drinking. Put some work in and understand why mixed tanks are retarded yourself. You will save yourself a Nyx(probably).
---
Set graphics to potate, you will only see a static "the scope" image
---
Well no, you wouldn't, we're not operating in Azeroth.
---
People have several times, he chooses not to have his vision corrected.
---
citadel mechanics create an easy out for people.  no need to fight over useless space and useless structures when you can asset safety and spam them for free. nothing's really every at risk anymore asset wise, so why risk anything defending.
---
I think panfam need's to play dead or die tbh, so one day the largest coalition in the game (imperium) will be so board, they have no option but fight the 2nd largest (legacy.) Then goons will be the only entity left standing and ccp can reset the servers. pretty much the serenity solution.
---
Goons will never go to war with tapi while there is a 3rd block standing in the game its too much of a risk for them... This is why eve is broken. In a game all about players creating their own content, when 2 large coalitions are scared of being attacked they blue up as a permanent solution to avoid the risk. Then when the risk is gone so is a lot of content from the game.
---
Only you can answer.  Are you having fun?  I will say this, Eve is not really a free game.  Everything about Alpha is designed to get you to pay for Omega.  
---
I could not have fun as an Alpha. Its specifically set up so you are unable to fly many of the popular ship setups.  You might be able to use the hull, but will not be able to use all the modules without running out of power and cpu.
---
well you aren't wrong but the difference between bob times and today is titans beeing so strong. 
---
having a small dreadfleet on standby in range "kinda" made using this titan very dangerous, so subcaps were the platform to fight with and there are loads of nice ways to turn tides in subs through numbers, doctrine etc.
---
today a dreadbomb means nothing, hell nobody even gives a fuck about 10 dead titans and since the titan is non plus ultra against caps, subcaps and structures the party with more titans wins.
---
And we know everyone just blueballs if its not a 3:1 advantage ratio so.....
---
wts votes 10m each
---
you forgot its paper thin and died to 5man triglav fleet
---
The problem is that if you don't have that advantage, the enemy most likely has. Equal fights are exceedingly rare. Which is sad considering they are the most fun.
---
I think that this is part of the cause.  But not the whole cause.  I think that the root cause is actually a defining feature of the game.  Eve has a unique combination of a very permissive rules set +null sec.  No other game known to me has quite that combination.
---
Null forces organization in a darwinian field. The weak die or are suborned.  If you want to make isk, and do well you need to craft an effective organization.  You need to dynamically adapt to threats and problems.  You need to hold and defend space and enforce your sovereignty.  As you get larger and more effective, hunters just become another problem to solve.  And as you get more effective at that, you are rewarded with safer space.  As you get safer space you will attract others who will each contribute in their own way.  In time large Null entities result, which will become virtual nation states with all the trappings thereof.  While some object to this I confess to finding it interesting.
---
no one want to co-operate vs goons, one by one they just avoid their wrath. Problem in ppl. CCP need rework partisan activity's to do them more reasonbale.
---
Before the updates they have done this, I've seen recruitment offers from big corps on those billboards. But now its just that all the time.
---
Bitter Vets hate injectors because it lets people catch up to them making it harder for them to be assholes to everyone because "i have a titan"
---
You krab so you can arm the fighting part of your alliance. Goons (or rather Something Awful forum guys) joined Eve in the past to troll and make the game miserable for everyone (see their exploits in other video games at the time). This didn't work back then as other players (namely BoB) had much more experienced members. Goons tried to blob, but supers and titans proved to be a valuable asset. So they krabbed and built supercaps and now can outblob anyone in subcaps and supers. Endgame achieved.
---
LOGI ON KILLMAILS
---
I think I should switch sides. Test is killing the game.
---
Huge difference is supercap proliferation and huge wealth and also citadels
---
Look at goons, ncpl isn't even really fighting and it still takes weeks just because those timers are broken. Sticks took a few days max undefended.
---
CCP never really shined in those situations and changes won't come or the wrong ones. Also, just because they said it doesn't mean anything, history approves that.
---
DRF was always a huge paper bag, just no one was bothered to attack the dronelands. I have huge respect for skill urself, but you shouldn't lose against 150 dudes and then maybe 500, that's really weak
---
Just imagine killing all structures in delve, it will take months
---
Poaching is legit one of the stupidest fucking things to accuse someone of. So someone else left your space guild to play with another space guild....who fucking cares lmao. Only loser autists such as yourself and apparently all of TEST leadership would care about that
---
You receive a list of last-ditch backup numbers in case you lose or phone or app, one time codes to get back into your account when you activate the authenticator. Make a copy and keep them safe and separate from your pc, etc
---
Accurate.
---
Not to be harsh, but 2FA would have prevented all of this. Your digital life is a critical part of your existence and warrants extra security.
---
Lol, yeah Fweddit only lived under Goon umbrella for like what, six years
---
TEST wasnt evicted. They just run after Co2 was gone.
---
Dont you think the damage has already been done? also what are you going to tell the players who havent injected yet and are facing guys with dozens of specialized chars for each role.
---
The 64bit client has been downloaded to every pc over the course of the last couple of months.
---
Switching to it shouldnt trigger any download as you already have the 64bit client.
---
Switching to the beta version of the launcher will only update the launcher but has nothing to do with downloading the 64bit client
---
reee lmao gotem good brother
---
Make sure you have enough to drink around your PC.
---
Time for some resets methinks
---
Captain Irony, reporting for duty
---
Might be worth putting up the security video snippet you guys have on youtube onto the launcher every now and then, hopefully, others will take heed.
---
And I mean water, juice, milk whatever.... if you fc you tend to talk a lot. It helps if you drink, to have your voice smooth.
---
And, hey, it was enough to drive them into our arms. Trash it if you will, but shitty behavior comes home to roost.
---
Still the same problem. If you reduce the titan production - goons still have the most titans ingame :-P
---
Congratilations you are F1 monkey.
---
Mfw every one is telling you to use 2fa and ignores you *saying* you had it on over 40 compromised accounts.
---
We should be able to watch news from The Scope on these.
---
I mean fighting outnumbered is more fun, but yea.
---
I did that just to remove as much social engineering risk as possible.
---
The only difference between former 'top dogs' being evicted and the current ncdot/pl tears is that the former ones started planning a revanche immediatly, where they now only have a serious lack of spine and blame the sandbox.
---
But let me give you a cuddle while I drink these delicious tears
---
I'm no fan but Test has been providing a lot of content. I'd have to disagree.
---
Yes I am
---
Exploration and gas huffing are lucrative and fun enough to pay for a sub in a couple days.
---
TEST always have and always will cling to the strongest group. That's now Goons. Ot was inevitable.
---
But yeh it was TEST FCs leaving PL that forced them to be bootlickers :laffo:
---
  I don’t disagree. I also agree some things need to change or the game will become Serenity.
---
When I used a previous email from CCP (there's an account management link on it) it used a cached token to let me view the account.
---
From there you can see the recent activity with the IP address it happened from.
---
You then take that IP and put into something like https://whois.domaintools.com/ which will report who owns the IP... you can then also use geolocation services to get a closer location.
---
Given test and goons are not blue how is that a blue donut?
---
Except and my only point about this was both are/ were equally bad for the game then and now.
---
Thoughts and prayers
---
Let's hope titans continue to be nerfed. Speaking as a titan pilot BTW.
---
My last three jobs asked me to send in my SSN equivalent as well as other personal information through e-mail, they would not accept an encrypted email or in-person.
---
You have heard a lot. Why don't you find out for yourself? Wow spoon feeds you. Eve you need to get out and do it on your own initiative. Maybe wow is more suited? It's up to you...
---
Did you also find it shocking how easy it is to remove 2fa?
---
Well yeah... but it was my sky email that was breeched and from there everything else fell.  
---
I had built a castle on sand.  Sky don't support 2FA and that's why I'm in the process of moving everything to my own domain with MFA.
---
All I can say is never run for csm.
---
I have talked on billboards with CCP devs in Russia. They are making a new billboard rotation and upload system rn, so they are unable to update the content till they are done.

Rorquals are great content providers. Hunting would be a lot less interesting without those 10b targets sitting at belts. All other targets can be aligned etc.
---
SCP Foundation is the weirdest thing on the internet.
---
Skill injectors get a bad name, but they aren't as bad or responsible for the landscape we have now.  You could always just buy a character if needed a super pilot or mining alt.  There might be a shortage of rorqual characters on day 1, but they don't take that long to train.  At most you are forcing a few months delay.  And they would have been created regardless of injectors due to the current set of rules we are playing under. 
---
That said, the real fucking issue has been skill farms and extracting to pay for omega.  People bitch about plex being so high, but if you take into account extracting, omega costs only nothing (a few hundred M isk).  You can run multiple eyes for free, multibox huge fleets for free, run multiple bots for free, cloaky camp for free, etc. etc.  Multiboxing used to require a large amount of isk or $.  now it is basically expected as it basically free to do.
---
Need a tissue?
---
&gt; SCP Foundation is the ~~weirdest~~ *best* thing on the internet.
---
It is a beautiful goal, is it not?
---
Exactly....eve without rorquals would be pretty boring for hunters.
---
I’m so proud of him, I’m gonna hang it up on my fridge
---
I need rules for that game x)
---
Surprised you were being downvoted. This is pretty spot on.
---
Goons didn't adapt, the game changed and just happened to suit their model best.
---
Most core PvP alliances are occupied with people who just want to log in for a few hours in the evening, and talk and shoot shit. With citadels CCP kinda nerfed these ping alliances.
---
You should try undocking more and crying on Reddit less.
---
Lol... Miss your fleets Ailok.
---
It will die because people spend more time on reddit crying than actually playing the game
---
Provi bow to test, so yes.
---
And you wonder why you lost. One day you will understand.

I’m interested, go on...

You're smoking something good if you think GOTG is getting some permanent NIP from imperium. Sort is dealing with some outstanding grudges not playing a long term safe game.
---
One is a symptom of bad things.  The other is simply a hierarchy.
---
Silly Pubbie.
---
Your flair :P
---
Unlike NCPL until very recently they don't have a nip with literally everyone within 3 regions of their space.
---
You realise it's not real right :p
---
It will have to be for my third titan, my titans so far are named *Fluffy* and *Escrow Tomb Extender*.
---
I guess people didn't think you could manage an equal fight. In Welp squad those fights happen all  the time.
---
this but unironically
---
goons don't like panfam, we've mostly fought them for a decade and we're not going to let them get of easy in a moment of weakness
---
grr plnc hat plnc
---
Sorry dude, test it about week on sisi and don’t want to share.
---
Turns out we don't care how you want to play the game.
---
Ahh my Ruhrpott heart
---
^this is how krabs actually pvp. They get dunked by nerds on the field and then complain or jerk each other off on reddit.
---
It's just panfam and allies getting deepdicked, don't worry imperium has no strategic interests in the north
---
How do u figure tapi could fight imperium at all or that it’d be good for the game?
---
tapi is an infinitely worse gsf clone with like 400 fewer titans on a form. what would they do? Just quit bro maybe ccp shakes up mechanics but the macro game has been the same for 3 (going on 4) years. If you’re interested in nullsec then I’d suggest going on ice and crossing your fingers
---
can't you read? Tell me that goons and test will break up their "team" after this war and I will send you half my ingame money.
---
Nobody, really nobody is seriously flaming test and goons for beating on panfam. okay maybe besides some bad propaganda when goons need 600 extra dudes cz they can't beat our 200 but thats the standard war propaganda.
---
The point is that the entire south, west and parts of the east have blued up each other for 4!!!! years although there was no real war against anybody, and that drastically reduces content for everybody
---
No?
---
DoN't FlY wHaT yOu CaN't AfFoRd To LoSe!
---
Talking about test/ legacy to a test line member and we must be talking about GOTG
---
This is definitely a game where a good corporation can be a necessity to find content. At the very least having 5-10 people that you can count on to be online when you need help goes a long way.
---
I've been an officer in two corporations- both times as a combat director of small gang warfare -and a CEO of my current corporation (solo production/holding corporation). I've managed around 200 active pilots at one point. 
---
Whether it was mining, running missions, or just roaming through low and null security space, having a few people around to help made all the difference.
---
Now, I'm just sitting here, producing **REDACTED** raking in the billions, exploring, and occasionally roaming solo.

They won't show market graphs on the billboard, but they'll introduce a new market UI that will get rid of these graphs so new players aren't confused by them.
---
Because you've figured out the greatest fit for it and want to keep it a secret to give you an imagined edge over others. Obviously. :P
---
I think the most multi-boxing I did was 3 accounts and that was for a 2 miners 1 hauler setup. . .which because I was paying ISK for PLEX back then- when a single PLEX was needed for game time and that was only around 400mil ISK -wasn't really worth the time and effort. 
---
I can fly everything Amarr and Gallente (including capitals), most Caldari and Minmatar ships (need to fill in some T2 holes), almost maxed production and industry skills, working on my mining skills a bit more . . .I could fly a Titan, if I had the skillbook for it, but couldn't afford it or really use it without a supporting Alliance.
---
I loved my Archon (Amarr Carrier) back in the day. . .many good times were had ratting in null-sec with it. 
---
I will tell you the best way to practice your skills with different ships is to get on the Test server. . .or at least used to be. Easier to find 1v1 fights and learn to control your ship without being overwhelmed by a blob. That is where I learned to use my T2 frigates and cruisers in solo PvP.
---
oof, for sure your fit variation much better than my.
---
This is beautiful.
---
You now belong to the Imperium.
---
Downvotes on rage
---
Triumvirate predicted this.
---
Start working on Eve Online 2.0; take a year or two off to completely overhaul the game engine. Expand the universe, reset everything. Take lessons learned and apply them.  
---
Honestly the main thing I would want to see is a massive reduction in capital proliferation. Keepstars are nice and all, and perhaps the only citadel worth 3 timers, but being able to dock and store huge amounts of supers I feel like is a bit gamebreaking.   
---
Dreads and carriers need significant rework, when they were buffed about three or four years ago they became massively overpowered. I mean, prior carriers were fairly uses vs subcaps, but now they are nuts.
---
I thought back then titans could doomsday through cyno's?   
---
The new titans are stronger in a different way, now it's titan on titan blobs... I would enjoy seeing a massive reduction in supers, but we're beyond that. Alliances used to only be able to horde a number of titans that they could plex accounts for, which limited them severely,  now you can stash hundreds in alliance hangers to give out as reimbersement.  
---
When I was in Tri it baffled me how we would have a complete 500 man fleet full of supers/carriers/dreads, have a huge fight that would amount to nearly 1tril isk destroyed/lost, and the alliance wallet was deep enough they just gave out new ships to everyone. After that the little machariel fleets and ferox fleets felt almost pointless,
---
Can't believe you're getting downvoted for this. Eve is truly pandering to casuals these days.
---
Imperium complained about Casinos IE unassailable wealth generation.  We are all on equal footing now no more passive moon goo.  NC Pl have literally sat on their asses with one of the best regions of the game belonging to renters.  No one complained about titans too strong or super capital proliferation when they could helicopter around the map dropping dick on everyone.   Now goons are doing to them what they have done to others and all I have read all week is CCP fix my game and EVE is dying.
---
There's some missing holes in that donut from neutral entities.
---
Finish wiping out Horde, NC/Pl and force them to use the best region in the game they currently have renters in and maybe they can get their shit together.   I’m hopeful but it’s doubtful.
---
Multifit out of containers would also be nice
---
I think the devs should take a year or two to form and polish a new game engine for Eve 2.0, leave people to fight over the tablescraps, then open a new portal to "Eve 2" universe and wtf that is. New game entirely, subscription based - maybe Eve veterans would get a kick back, +some niceities for years of service to the game, but ultimately the first few months would just be us tards running missions in frigates.  
---
Then you get to fight your way up the food chain again. :\]
---
Technically that is what they do... They have to target a rock then aggress the drones to it. When the rock is dead they then recall warp off warp back to a new rock and then aggress drones again. Its not like shooting npc's where you just sit in one place and the drones do everything. 
---
Now if you mean every time the drones finish a mining cycle the drones lose their target I can see this as maybe a fix. Although it would just take an extra line of code to fix the bots that take up most of the "multiboxing" miners.

CCP has nerfed the rorq into the ground, they changed the spawn times of the belts, everything they do to get the problem undercontrol only punishes those who do not run 15-20 rorqs. With each pass all that happens is the "multiboxers" just add enough new rorq accounts to make up for the loss. I dont think ccp care about the problem, I think they are trying to do these changes to make more people buy plex for cash, this inturn is bought by rorq accounts to keep them active. The cycle will not end.
---
i mean, one of the suggestions is to add fatigue back to jump gates, so... yeah
---
Eve is whatever you want it to be. I've been playing for around 6 years now, own the biggest and most expensive ships you can normally get, and I never had to use an excel spreadsheet.
---
If you want to do certain activities, then sure, spreadsheets help. In general though, they are not needed.
---
&gt; it will take months
---
and that's only the first system in Delve; what's the point in shooting structures? in the immortal words of Jesse Ventura, "son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick". the only thing that will kill gons is gons themselves.
---
so our job is to make life for them miserable. let them glass tribute. just keep killing their supers and rorqs back home. when they get bored of killing unattended (mostly) and worthless shitadels and go home, we will still be killing their krabs. 
---
but they are right, mistakes were made, we didnt adapt. let's move on.
---
I still can't bear to watch that sansha video.
---
"you just need to get more titans to fight us lol"......
---
Content lol hunting new pilot friendly alliances to damn near extinction that’s just kill board padding.
---
Was planning on asking a girl out at a friend’s birthday party, but said friend postponed it to next Saturday. So I have one more week of downtime, and it hurts ;(
---
Just introduce a nerf to 'massed titans' - a server counts the number of DD fitted titans every couple of minutes and applies a system-wide effect. Something like mumbo-jumbo "Doomsday drive emission interference" that reduces all titan resists by 1% for every titan present in the system. You can still 'drop the hammer' with hundreds of titans, but with zero resists even dreads should be able to punch through the reworked FAX reps pretty easily. This way you would have a meaningful strategic choice to either drop a couple as a force multiplier, or drop many and risk losing a bunch in the process. Of course this can be exploited even more by dropping 500 titans on like 20, wiping all of them out with a couple easy DDs per smaller force's titan. It would still be a step in the right direction though.
---
&gt;close to ending the server lol
---
it's about time. i love this game but it's time for them to turn off the lights. this shit is more stale than 4 week old bread
---
Lol at the tiny dicked Russian fags downvoting you lololol
---
I swear that whole country has dicks in the brain constantly.
---
Wormhole space isn't hard, Volta isn't elite, I'm very confused by the rest, have you considered you're bad at eve?
---
Oh sure, the 1st I learned from Eve is to be patient (there were no injectors at the time).
---
The 2nd thing I learned is to be humble (and sadly there were elite pvp assholes still at the time)
---
if sort doesn't just throw in the towel and move to delve to suckle on the goon tit full time it will be a fucking miracle. he knows he's fucked if he doesn't
---
I hear a lot of complaining about how NCPL "farmed low skill groups" for content for years.  What the fuck else are they supposed to do if everyone else sucks and they are the big boys.  They used their super fleet like super fleets should actually be used.
---
Has google translate learned how to post to r/eve ?
---
Problem with your arguments if test had stayed in Vale it would have just been your “Content” farm because you would have eventually broken any agreement you made with test in the name of “Content”.  Test chose not to be farmed and moved on can’t say I blame them.
---
Your problem is you have no idea how other people think.  You may have Asperger's.
---
I'm guessing you've never read anything about 2fa, and how ordinary users interact with these systems.
---
If you joined an alliance or a group of people who were actually willing to help you out an answer questions Eve is not that hard of a game.
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Make it so fuckin tedious that not only pvper quit the game but miners too now.
---
Honestly, looking at the numbers and everything - moving Eve Online from a subscription to Free2plae model really didn't improve account numbers that much - it just increased how much money the whales were spending.  
---
Jesus christ, I left the game about a year and a half ago and plex were 1.3bil, I logged in and some guy offered to sell me plex, and jita price was 2.1bil. Fucking hell...  
---
When I started playing, Plex was around 300mil a pop, and we thought that was steep. The game's become way over saturated, and the comical thing is, really, is it's not getting many new players. The free to play model gave a small buff in player accounts but after it died down we're trending along the same 20k-30k active users we have been for the past three or four years. 2008 - 2015 were the best years for the game, and now everything is beginning to trend downwards.

Source: Google tranquility server status.
---
well here is the most widely read contemporary report on the war, and the one that comes closest to a real-time account of events:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4cdmmc/wtf_is_going_on_the_answer/
---
almost everything else of note was written after, but the impact of those lowsec fights is something that mittani with his various narratives has buried in the imperium. it was a lot more complex than that.
---
Not much left!
---
The comical thing is, this game is built on the back of whales. Look at Eve tranquility, the number of players online. You can easily 1/3rd that or 1/4th that to account for real people. Most eve players I know run three + accounts. I run two, and I've strongly limited myself to just keeping two,
---
Great Video!
---
Oh sure, opening pyfa and building a fit is SO hard. And it is not hard to reverse-engineer your fit based on this video. But it is not about good and bad fits anyways, it's about the concept. Why even make a video if you do not want to share your concept? "Look I kill stuff"?
---
what blobs are you fighting against? enlighten me
---
Ever heard of a bust out? If not watch good fellas where they bust out the restaurant owner. SP injectors are the final bust out and when there is nothing left to take... you burn it down.
---
&gt;your shitty leaderships narrative.
---
yes I would love to see those screenshots
---
Actually it’s not about the kill board it’s the fact they actually undocked
---
Implement game mechanics that punish big blocks but don't interfere with normal sized alliances.
---
Actually I did, years ago. I even tried to warn everybody. Nobody Listened.
---
I am actually listed on their site.
---
:thonking: 
---
there is never zero risk when dropping supers, don't be an idiot.
---
So just triggered.
---
Magus, probably.
---
It looks like the steampunk version of Captain Nemos submarine but in space. Has drones, 4 midslots and can boosh.
---
stain isn't part of eve. aint nobody got time for that.
---
Don't be daft, there's four more wormholes in that wormhole.
---
i think he forgot to add the "/s" at the end
---
Dude you're looking at a map that definitely shows the half of Eve thing was bullshit. And I guess pgl was only pretending to be a moron, that's why he FCs in PlanetSide now. How do the boots taste? Good?
---
Revers, what your problem. No fit - no concept, ok sound nice. Gl revers
---
If you have to ask you cant afford it.
---
I have a fit that does \~17 AU.
---
Do you need to the low slots to get to those 32?
---
No. You're (sadly) in the minority, but CCP were quite clear that it's too difficult for them to keep maintaining it. 
---
Maybe one day they'll find the resources to do it properly, but it seems super doubtful.
---
Covops 5 puts you at 18au. Warp accelerators and a head full of ascendancies and hyperspatials put you at 32 au. But pricey though especially the ascendancies
---
i think you better go back and read the statement.
---
\*cough\* the judge \*cough\*
---
Armor Scorpions are still a thing in the according doctrines.
---
a whole lot of grr gons you say? I see more grr ncpl so you may want to re-read this thread, and 90% of the rest of the threads lately.
---
You are forgetting one major thing... its a video game. If the mechanics are so against you and the odds are so impossible you will just play a different game. The people that had any will to actually try to change things are largely leaving due to ccp inaction on balance.
---
Sorry about missing that.
---
regardless if csm had an agenda to remove injectors that will NEVER happen, it makes CCP too much money
---
I just joined CVA recently and I don't think that we batphoned in that time (or I don't know about it) but I heard that PL attacked a few months back so it's no surprise that goons got batphoned.
---
So I know this is a day late, but just wanted to participate. 
---
Just got back into the game after 3 months away, due to moving through a seperation and living in a new place. Discovered the computer here is powerful enough to run this game respectably, so started with a fresh character last night.
---
Hopefully this will assist in keeping my mind busy as I go through this rough patch in my life! 
---
Sounds like everyone is spreading the same advice and love around. Luckily my guys and are I used to being memed on and we get a laugh out of it. Thank you for the advice.
---
He's living under the mango tree with his best friend nowadays.

Fair point, nothing worse than having your mouth dry and no liquid to smooth it out.

Eve players: CCP STOP WASTING DEV TIME IN RANDOM SHIT, FIX YOUR GAME
---
Also Eve players: ^
---
First of all, why are cits designed like a bunch of scrap metal with docking ports? Even the keepstar looks like shit in some sides
---
Very dank leak from local
---
Thank you!
---
Local Intel best Intel
---
What does that have to do with what I'm saying? That was utter destruction, not sustained bleeding of talent and arms over years while pretending like they were doing a good thing for the aggrieved.
---
SB proteii
---
When Alliance A spends their time and effort raising up those FCs and supercap havers from nothing, only to have their investment taken? Yeah, it is.
---
Amazing, well done!
---
Indeed. 
---
[This was my Alpha clone run this year.](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114827546/)
---
Month old toon, no skill boosters, skill cap limitations and we were getting kills, I was contributing with neuts, tackle and so forth.
---
The real skill in EVE is **how** you fly, fit a ship and picking who you fly it against.
---
Sure, they have clung to stronger groups in the past. However, what choice did they have? I'm sorry they picked the "wrong" group.
---
Arm yourself: krab
---
Making money without risk.
---
No one's phone has ever been stolen? 
---
People don't save their e-mail passwords into them?
---
People don't link all of their accounts into 2FA on their phone?
---
Thanks!
---
Less content.
---
Nerf cyno you will have less farmer after 3 month (and less player)
---
So less target
---
So less content
---
Gotta give TEST props, here -- their Minokawa rep girth during the X47 hull timer was impressive. Saving an Erebus with shield reps is at once blasphemous and glorious.
---
After 10 more attempts or so at getting password resets I think he/she gave up when they finally realised that I had re-secured everything.
---
Fortunately I keep my game accounts and financial/life stuff fairly separate (different emails) so his threat wouldn't amount to much.
---
I haven't heard of Gmail being hacked.
---
    Search for things like this:
---
    gmail hacked site:https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/
---
However, the drawback to both Yahoo (owned by AOL) and Gmail is that they are American HQ companies and as such are subject to the Patriot Act. What with the way Americans screw things up, there is bound to be a password hash table getting leaked by some agency that is snooping around at some point.
---
Maybe A should be asking themselves why those fcs are leaving instead of making excuses and blaming the alliance they move to for poaching.
---
I think you're missing an important point, at its core, progress in this game is not tied to effort i.e. as long as you pay your subscription, skill points get added - which is probably as close to pay-to-win as you can get.
---
Now with the introduction of skill injectors, and turning skill points into commodity, this has changed, you can now buy SP with isk that you took time to earn.
---
That is a good thing cuz it rewards you for playing the game and makes it possible for a new guy to catch up with vets.
---
Capital &amp; rorqual proliferation, is an issue that should be addressed separately.
---
Yeah I'm currently in the process of moving everything off Sky and onto my own domain hosted with Office365 (Exchange Online, MFA, conditional access etc).
---
imo 2 things that would significantly change the game for the better are;
---
\- remove supercapital docking from keepstars
---
\- make skill injectors only applicable to alpha skills/non-capital skills/&lt;10m SP limit (not sure which of those would be best but one of them)
---
removing supercapital docking would stop super umbreallas being so big as you said in your post, as it would require people to have dedicated alts for their very cheap super hull, this would create a bigger barrier to entry than just putting your main or carrier alt in the nyx you have in your hanger (or titan for that matter) to drop on that 20 man fleet in moas roaming in your space.
---
The original CCP obviously didn't put docking into the game for a reason (balance, a word current CCP doesn't know),  new gen CCP is spitting in the face of people who actually made the game their company has been coasting on for the past 15 years. They removed caps from highsec they can remove super docking access (to those that will say whats the point of a keepstar if that was to happen; they're much much easier to defend than a fortizar, and they're pretty cheap now at only 150bn... way too cheap imo)
---
Creativity is reward. If you do somethign defender has never see trust me you could have nice KM.
---
But you want disalow the RISK VS REWARD for hunter. Beacause defender reduce risk with EFFORT. And basically a lot of people who complain want hunt with 0 effort and 0 risk. And it will not solve the problem it will just increase it. Create golden ammo, you will have no farmer(juist see what happen in perma camp system when they do'nt have backup).
---
You want an empty 0.0 for "creativity"? 
---
Or you prefer reward effort of player ?
---
Did not disappoint.
---
Ok, the day you make same post in french with 0 missspelling or gramatical error.
---
Try going in to low class wh for exploratiin
---
What’s your definition of “good content”? If it’s massive blob tidifest, then no we do not indulge in that. But if it is medium size battles versus alliances 10x bigger than us, then yes we do have amazing content!
---
Sup wize
---
Grammar attack is the last argument of people with no other argument.
---
Yes, it's all purpose of this post in fact. Beacause when i read r/eve i see to many people who haven't understand this basic.
---
tbf "armchair devs" actually play the game rather than CCP who gives talks about how they mine in a venture in highsec and die to rats in a c1 (hilmar very relatable btw)
---
You are retarded.
---
If tanking your doctrine towards the expected dmg type is some kind of foresight in your alliance, I guess I should apply as your new head fc.....
---
They don't need to ask themselves -- it's a pretty simple process. Young, developing alliance gets sat on by a force they can't possibly hope to contest, no matter their skill. Powerlessness breeds frustration, which is harvested from without in the form of FCs and supercap havers.
---
I know that you desperately want to try to paint this like it's the fault of the alliances that get sat on, but pretending like there isn't specific, directed action to force this to occur from without is delusional to the point of comedy.
---
Just for you, they should be dropped into a container 5 jumps out!
---
And it’s a different container every time!
---
You and u/bleakorange7, get a room :D
---
Exactly. And more over goons is not only an organisation, with time it become an idea. Imagine goons disband tooday by surprise.
---
Ok, for maybe 6 month you will have dank kill mail of people who don't understand what happen. And after ? After you will have a colaition form with near same people who will be more stronger than the precedent. 
---
I see eve as a miror of our society. Why did we have create country, law and other thing ? Beacause a majority of people want it. For me it's not a surprise if one day the server will have few country who work together, sometimes make war like real world.
---
Feel free to give it up any time.
---
You don't really use scordite in null. That's a hisec shit ore.
---
he's in fedup you absolute mongoloid
---
test and goonswarm were already bluetral due to all the nips and "we don't kill their rorqs" and shit waaaaaay before this.
---
The problem was that when Goons were beaten, they didn't keep stomping until they were completely wiped out.
---
Ok so imagine it will not be 200 but maybe 1000. You wil be blap same way. 
---
Every big change will just allow you maybe 6 month of "dank kill LOL". Aftetr you will start to cry again. And you have shitons of proof of this fact in eve history.
---
So glad I stopped playing
---
Gamers always know what I'm talking about when I mention EVE irl, they just either know it as "the game I'll never play because new players have no chance" or "the 'game' I'll never play because spreadsheets in space and I don't want a second (or third) job." 
---
Marketing by word of mouth isn't necessarily bad, indie games do it all the time and it doesn't stop their success. CCP just does nothing to dissuade these particular popular perceptions of the game that are huge barriers to new players, and new players are what keep games alive.
---
Big if true.
---
That would be amazing, crowd funded Provi server.
---
very true, moving away from unsafe email providers is the solution here.
---
Exactly.
---
And in fact i think it's part of the problem.
---
Without backup 0.0 are near empty...in fact same as 0.0 before super umbrella when no cover fleet. People dock when they see someone enter, or someone near with they're friend who report they. 
---
0.0 under umbrella is stressing for hunter, beacause they see a lot of target, and they know they will not be abble to kill a lot of target. 
---
RISK VS REWARD for hunter : low risk, but hard to find a reward. 
---
Or hight risk and hght reward?
---
I just explain how super umbrella born. Not solution to destroy it. 
---
But if people understand how umbrella born, they could understand golden ammo will solve nothing.
---
Mine is a mixed bag, console gamers, Mac, board games, etc.
---
Imagine the number of people don't understand that basic of super umbrella mechanism and post to have more way to kill people.
---
No
---
he saying : "Stop propose thing to kill super umbrella you will just reinforce they. Think to a way to encourage people to don't use it."
---
Those that make the last stand will be remembered far better than those that conquered, much like the 300 Spartans.
---
Did not surprise either
---
Shopping from the market ejects the items in cans at random distances in a 15k sphere around the station.
---
That’s exactly what ccp did to buff goon tho idgi
---
So you have a rootcause, now how you solve it withotu fuck the risk/reward/effort ? 
---
Beacause actually each proposition i see forget one of this 3 factors at minimum.
---
And if you do, enjoy not only Alliance SRP, but corp SRP as well!
---
Gotg would still be with Panfam if they didn't sell out the rest of pamfam. 
---
Get it right.
---
I would like to add that CCP contacted myself yesterday and are currently working to resolve this.  
---
I would like to thank you for your kind words/intentions.  
---
For the meantime I've decided to experience what new comers to EVE get whilst I play on an Alpha.  
---
The new player experience has improved 500X since I started... back in my day it was effectively "welcome to EVE, here's a ship".
---
Love my jackdaw
---
Considering that NCdot and PL couldn't manage it, your services are probably needed more on that side.
---
I have never claimed to know what a good use of dev time is. If I'm being completely honest, I don't consider things like dev time or cost or any of that when I make suggestions about the game.
---
Follow Fonsui on Twitch.  He’s a resident expert with great advice and a ship/skill plan to follow.  Ask him and he’d be very happy to help
---
Heading there unless some power blocks ditch Goons.
---
Relative safety in numbers.

"the moment you lose your honor, that's when you learn the hard way. Your choice always comes back around."

Triglavian forces should randomly attack big hubs with special triglavian titans.
---
actually no. finally all those annoying ads flashing on my screen have ended
---
That's not what you have been talking about. What you've said that "hackers" do man in the middle attacks over wifi to catch 2fa authentication to login into accounts. Which isn't closely to how it works.
---
Yea if you loose your phone and have no pin/passcode you're fucked. Though most people have them. It is possible to bypass those on some phones and but not on all and is not how people use loose their accounts commonly.
---
 [Redline\_XIII](https://www.reddit.com/user/Redline_XIII/) how could you :( We trusted you.......
---
Wtf... What alpha vni pulls 60m/h or what alpha venture mines consistently 50m/h? 
---
Spending half a day to find a cleared and abandoned c320/540 site needs to be counted in. 
---
Explo is fine tho. Clone state doesn't matter too much in this regard.
---
doesn't it increase cycle time? thereby reducing the amount of ore you mine per unit time?
---
I'm guessing you're just stupid and inept.
---
They explain 2fa systems in plain English. You'd honestly have to be a moron to not understand them, much like those car owners who don't even know how to open the hood of their car.
---
Alpha clones train at half the regular speed and omegas train at regular speed plus implants. 
---
Don't get confused by ccp propaganda
---
As it has been since '03. They were right you know!
---
retard post
---
Is players feedback important? Yes. But, these people have no idea what the process is for game devs. They just get these magical ideas and expect them to appear out of thin air. And that’s not how it works sadly.
---
And you may actually be retarded. 
---
Welcome to 2019. 2FA systems are commonplace and anybody who complains (i.e. you) about their complexity is probably just too stupid or incapable of learning a very basic system. You can teach children how to build a computer, but god forbid you try to explain the utter *simplicity* of 2FA to a full grown adult.
---
Looks like Pac-Man
---
Ah fuck our alliance leader leaking opsec info in local chat again 😰
---
"Any change implemented to help new players (or small groups) will have an even more beneficial effect for older players (or larger groups)."
---
you can you're just bad
---
Ah, yeah. Mine are all at least familiar with pc gaming even if they don't dabble themselves.
---
No, I'm asking when we evicted test cause thats what the previous post said we did. We tried and failed down south, I'm just asking if there's a time I forgot about. 
---
The closest that I can remember was when test was a minor partner in hero coalition and they bailed on brave prior to brave losing catch.
---
LOL 4 years later and brave still hysterically traumatized after literally blobbing Russians out of a region with 1000 person fleets
---
&gt;surprise that goons got batphoned.
---
TAPI. 
---
it was more than a "few months back", late 2017 early 2018
---
You can make isk for undocking not harassment and kicked from your Corp/alliance
---
More SP rewards? Guess I quit at the right time.
---
This backstab buzzword is getting quite funny. The shrill zkill screaming meta of last week has been replaced with backstab and poached. 
---
PL left the fountain theater cause someone dropped sov for all their drone land holdings so they had to go save it.
---
With one breath  you complain Panfam will not fight, with the next you say you don’t see an issue with three quarters of null being allied together against it.
---
Do you really not see a connection?
---
It’s like a farmer killing his chickens for Sunday lunch and then moaning that there are no eggs for Monday’s breakfast.
---
just undock and they wont be a problem :P
---
I can't remember the last time I even noticed the banners.  Do you guys just, like, sit in the station not doing anything but starting at the decorations?
---
You're incapable of understanding the point I'm making here, which has been made often enough by industry experts.  In conclusion you should probably fuck off and go play with your 2fa spreadsheet.
---
for example TAPI leadership ??? theyre the ones making the decision to blue/blutral half the game
---
I strongly believe that "I can just buy a plex with isk if I grind enough" attitude has led to more burnout among new players than anything else in the game. If you're not impatient about your skill queue or getting access to new toys, then just play the game at your own pace and keep enjoying it like you do now. At some point, you will likely realize that an omega account would make your experience more enjoyable, but don't worry about it now.
---
I pay sub cause i can do what i want when i want. I dont need to worry about farming for my omega. I farm for ship to splode
---
It's probably just a Talwar
---
Many alliance that were at the top almost died or loose their leadership, like you, bob, against all authority, cfc. The imperium has reborn after wwb yes; but it will fall again like the history of eve tell us.
---
yeah thats true, but CCP should actually try and design a game that facilitates conflict rather than bluing up (e.g. scarce resources)
---
idk if ALL the blame can be put on players (a lot of it yes)
---
how much money did you spend on plex?
---
&gt; anybody who complains
---
Lots of people have complained, including industry experts.  As there's no single "2fa", every site appears to have its own method.  It's a fucking nightmare for most users to manage, not during ordinary use but when something goes wrong.   If you can't understand the ordinary user's experience, you'll never understand the point I'm making.  I think that makes you the retard here, not me.
---
We didn't disband back when we faced against superior numbers in the east (and dumpstered them), and we wouldn't disband due to that now. So... no.
---
The game changed and suited Goons model best? Hmm, well I guess when to control the majority of the CSM you can lobby for those changes.
---
Eve University as others suggested. Avoid the big blocks, they just want meat.
---
Hit me with what you are smoking buddy, you've got some wild story in your head, I think r/eve would love to see you explain it a bit further, cause it seems like you are insinuating that panfam let your incompetent blob fall only so they could get the sov 2 years later? this is some planning not even INIT could pull off.
---
Welcome to the club. I get sick of making the case for changes that could breathe life back in to this game only to see the mountain of negativity for change.
---
Yeah, I know. I can't afford it
---
Large if factual.
---
I just got started with reactions too. Make sure someone in your huffing fleet is using a gnosis with t2 mining boosts and 5 gas huffers. 
---
That gnosis is better than a prospect unless it's a boosted prospect
---
then i would not get a cycle time of 66.6 seconds on a stripminer
---
I put forward an idea for anti-capital bombs but that got downvoted all to shit. I can only guess why
---
What makes a fit a Goku fit? Is that even a generally used term or is it a Horde specific doctrine type?
---
It literally almost looks like a blue doughnut
---
FA2.0 when
---
Industry is PvP, as is market.  
---
Mining and making something that is profitable because the ore is "free" is PvE.
---
I consider Industry being able to make what is needed at a profit over what it would you would make listing your raw materials at an intermediate price (between buy and sell) and walking away.
---
I mean, at first glamce it sounds bad on the servers, if it is meant to turn the tides in battles. 
---
We also need something against titans more than something against caps. What had your idea tailored that makes bombing titans work?
---
Ha! Excellent gif 👌
---
Quitting.
---
Test would never fight the imperium in any meaningful way. PGL would continue to be afk, and Vily would go back to goons before losing a war when they have nobody to call and too stubborn to ask panfam (assuming it still exists at the same scale), and bring most of Test with him.
---
Those loyal to the Test brand would go back to lowsec to rebuild again.
---
Blame ccp... every step of the way imperium has called trash on implemented changes and they refuse to adapt them before being exploited. Imperium wouldn't be in this place if it hadn't been for rorqual changes and skill injectors. Shit I had barely 1b to my name before those changes alone... now I have 3 titans and 2 supers with more fax n dreads than I know what to do with.

Silentmajority never forget

Even the slower ones would have learned these things over time had they been forced to fly their little ships long enough to learn even some of how rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-ewar works in this game.  
---
  This guy wants to skip past that hard stuff to the endgame because caps/titans don't work the way EvE works.  There is no counterplay.  They were limited because they took forever to skill into.   They were limited because your pilot was permanently married to the Titan.
---
Okay, you get an upvote. That’s the first time in a while someone’s got me with that
---
Pretty much everyone with half a brain predicted this.
---
But without being on the CSM and having knowledge of upcoming changes (e.g. skill injectors/rorquals) nobody could have predicted the timescale.

Because being dumb enough to think that outlining why something is is a endorsement of that thing and being dumb enough to not figure this out are strongly correlated.

But-but-but—we might lose an equal fight!
---
^/s
---
So it's up to CCP to design the game in a way that getting a huge group of players to team up and dogpile other players is not possible?  Are you fucking serious?
---
good answer made me smile :-D
---
So a Loki with 3x fitting mods and 5x caps (2x batteries + 3x rigs)... Most of these mods are also faction or deadspace... This smells like a RMT pilot killmail.
---
I support this initiative!
---
We dont have a wowprog or raider.io to track who's who. 
---
The closest we have is zkillboard, which doesnt tell the whole story. On zkill you can never tell who buys the equivalent of m+ boosts(never undocking to fight unless it's a guaranteed win. 
---
You have to look at Corp culture. Most corps that focus solely on killboard are going to be those sweaty mythic groups that accept zero fuckups and experimentation is frowned upon. "You want to bring anything other than a resto druid and a warrior to high m+ reeeeee." 
---
Corps that constantly die aren't bad. You have to look at the amount of members there are and then total killboard activity. If they're roaming constantly and at least getting some kills then that's way more enjoyable than a Corp with an all green killboard, but one or two fights a day. 
---
Evejobs subreddit is good. But one word of caution. If you actually did progression raiding in WoW then a big null sec bloc wont fit you unless you go for basically a raid lead position or an officer spot. 
---
Small gang is what you want. Everyone has their own job, and if everyone performs well then you get sick kills and everything just seems to fall in place just like a mythic kill. You aren't just some cog. You know all of the little micro plays you can do when trying to max your dps? Holding cooldowns, propositioning, switching your priority on the fly because something is about to happen? That's small gang my guy
---
Don't feed the retarded troll pls
---
I'd say with like 10 hours a month doing wh/null exploration you could Plex an account, but that had better be the only damn thing you're doing.
---
Lol and you believe that?
---
&gt;I'm not new to the game. This is my second pilot.
---
cute
---
So the blue and purple guys are the ones that undock?
---
When things like this happen. It should make the devs look at how shit the mechanics are. It should make the devs come up with better ideas.
---
Nice!! You’re doing it wrong 
---
Legacy and Imperium are blue only at some rare moments, but if you want to show to other how f*ck the PanFam “elite ways” play style bringing to this point this your perspective.
---
Deal with it, you are the Elite of Elite (LoL)
---
Fight each other like they kept telling Imperium to do for years.
---
They krab because they don't have casino money, passive moon goo from posses or immense rental empires like some alliances.
---
New NPC invades Delve through wormholes with 10k titans and the goal to burn all of EVE to the ground?  Concord is able to defend highsec.  Lowsec sustains heavy losses.  Nullsec is hopelessly lost.  The battles would be epic.
---
Also, are we bitching about world peace?  If our benevolent leader goes sour then a resistance movement will arise from within.
---
Oh get off that. The CSM has no power. It’s a focus group. One that CCP doesn’t always listen to at that. Goons changed their model at a time the game was massively in flux. Good on them.
---
Their success is as much luck as it is organization unless mittens has been having fever dreams about the future.
---
What's the point of logging on to eve, having a good time with a bunch of friends, making some isk, using isk for ships, and going out to war with ships? Yup, no point in being goons. Sounds boring.
---
This.
---
After this war  CCP with twiddle mechanics again.   And once again, some will figure it out and adapt and some won't.
---
Okay can someone explain that Arby fit??  Passive armor but nano instead of plate,  nano with cyno, no disruptors...
---
I'm seeing a hull that could have won them the fight if it had been fit for disruption instead of cyno boat.  As it is one of my favorites I am rather annoyed.
---
Pot meet kettle?
---
Garbage.
---
M-O keep?
---
I think High Drag Podcast is still on the go, and Talking In Stations is definitely still active.
---
Name as many changes that were said to help smaller groups as you want and I'll say what these changes did to large groups.
---
No one complained about PL when they had their titan blob? That's a lot of spin you have there buddy. When its goons doing it, ITS OKAY, but its unfair of eve to have united together for isk to attack cfc and evict them.
---
Welcome back, Roy missed your propaganda
---
The whaling system is prevalent in many games. It's called integrated frustration. Progression happens fast before a set wall is met. At this point, those who are willing to Shell out $ to quickly overcome the wall are the whales. Those that don't have to either grind or wait to overcome that wall.
---
Eve isn't the only place by far that this practice is used.
---
If that's true, doesn't it also limit Goons?  I mean their FCs burn out just the same as anybody else's.
---
It means that if you're planning on bringing some fancy cargo through LowSec near Amygnon or Eugales, you should let me and my friends know. I love DST killmails.
---
Like Imperium is doing now?
---
Pl and ncdot weren't poaching in 2010, we were both tiny alliances still going through growing pains so your narrative here is a crock of shit.
---
Then maybe don't use old changes and think about new ones?
---
How do you spend half a day finding a gas site?
---
HTP is still alive?
---
Come up with something and I'll say how large groups will benefit from it.
---
It's called Malcanis' Law and it's been around for almost a decade.
---
So fuck the sandbox, let's implement more barcodes limits to try and steer the game in a direction. Literally everything wrong with this game stems from CCP trying to do that.
---
So the game fighting NCPL's war for them because they can't do it themselves.
---
&gt;multiple ids exist for officer
---
There are several different levels of officers. Damavik, drek, and leshak for sure.
---
True, Eve isn't the first but they certainly went head-first into it. Really what it ultimately boils down to if it was good for the health of the game, or is the short injection of cash going to help to spiral it downwards.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/70622517/
---
Eh you're right, a lot of people did I suppose. Judging by the chinese servers I suppose everything will boil down to something like this.
---
&gt; The CSM has no power. It’s a focus group. 
---
I guess you missed the term lobbying in my post.
---
For example: The income of every sov region is getting tied to players living in this region and the direct surrounding regions. Every region gets an ammount of pilots it can supply, for example: 10. So Querious could supply 30 pilots in it's space, 10 from Querious, 10 from Delve and 10 from Catch. So if in Querious and the neighboring regions are living 40 pilots the pilots in Querious are getting less ISK from ratting and less ore from mining.
---
So the guys in Querious got 2 options: Get rid of inactive players or even active players or evict your neighbors. It will drive conflicts and will maybe break down big coalitions as it isn't worth to gather a shitton of guys in close space.
---
That’s the bombers right? I think it’s just a name based off of the spirit bomb ability goku does. TEST uses the name too.
---
thanks for your permission, i guess
---

Yeah before that roam I went to solo in Amarr lowsec. Got a few killmarks, got a few escapes, died to a couple cheese ganks, was pretty good.
---
I tried turning all the graphics down to the lowest settings because I've seen your suggestion elsewhere, but it still displays the same animated billboards.
---
you poached judge, thats what it has to do with it, geez man, dont get your tampon in a knot. not only did doing that essentially destroy an alliance, it caused "a lot of ill will" like you said.
---
it's a comparison for comparison's sake, don't read too much into it.
---
We welcome you shooting our krabs.   They currently represent the uncommitted outliers that don’t truly belong in our ranks.  And are too self absorbed to play with the rest of us.  
---
You should embrace our krabs - they are your future membership.
---
Heavy fighters' torpedo salvos and their normal guns combined is enough to alpha squishy JFs
---
just get more rorqs solves everything
---
The most dangerous part of a JFs journey is high-sec, and jumping into high-sec from low-sec. 
---
Generally, JF pilot jumps into system and docks in a STATION (not citadel), they will then swap alts, etc etc and finally undock. For the idiots out there, they will just simple hit the warp to gate xyz at 0 button and call it a day. This is the part where the nyx gets cyno'd in next to the JF and launches its heavy fighters, a JF can be volleyed off with one set of anti cap- torps if they are full cargo fit.
---
Lol what? This has to be satire.
---
one of the best, ever! if not the best! :D
---
I think CCP underestimated the willingness of their Wales. I agree, a super or Titan was once a badge of prestige to commitment to New Eden. It is frustrating that N+1 is really the concrete life of end game content, where even supers will be outmoded by Titan proliferation. The other issue with the Wales is after a certain point their isk farming is sufficient where they don't have to spend actual $ on injectors. Which pertain to people already over the wall. CCP introducing alpha status, although IMO good for Eve, was for getting the new 'wales' feet wet.
---
I agree on your point of view, accelerators good, unlimited injectors not feeling the warm fuzzy about it. As far as accelerators, it is still a sense of accomplishment. There is still a waiting time. Even cutting a train time in half still feels nice if it originally was a month train.
---
I was with a trade Corp out of Dixie until a couple weeks ago. You could fit almost anything out of Dixie.
---
if by "embrace" you mean "dread bomb" then I think we may just take you up on that
---
Meh this has no impact on game balance so it will probably get added  sooner than those.  CCP seems to only be gun-shy on things that will impact balance.  Anything with fancy graphics also seems to get priority.
---
I am a line member, I'm just aware of the level of influence I have in the grand scheme of things.
---
When the comparison isn't useful or relevant, then I take issue, yeah. Flipping The Judge and destroying a hated enemy completely is different than siphoning off years of gradual buildup to sustain your own festering corpse for another season, while simultaneously feeding the afflicted a bunch of bullshit about how what they're doing is good for them and that they should be thanked.
---
I mainly do 0.0 PvP.  However, my alliance is going to start participating in FW.  So I could use advise on FW set ups.  I have 105m skillpoints mostly in combat.  I don't fly T3 or Triglavian ships.
---
The containment isn't reliable as players frequently slip past the containment group, and the containment breach log was truncated, but contains at least 2 breaches in the same year of its discovery. It's at least Euclid.
---
which one?
---
&gt;industry experts
---
Right. "Experts" complain about a system I, as well as a vast majority of others who give 2 shits about cybersec, have had absolutely 0 problem understanding. Just like how "experts" tell me my taste in food, clothes, movies, or games are shit. Complaints are typically made by people who fail to adapt or refuse to adapt and think it's not their fault.
---
&gt;It's a fucking nightmare for most users to manage
---
It's simple as fuck. How are you this dense? Seriously you must be some elderly man with a poor grasp of modern technology. 
---
&gt;ordinary user's experience 
---
Ordinary users are painfully stupid when it comes to their devices. Most people don't even know how to insert an SD card into their smartphone anymore. Some don't even know what an SD card is.
---
So no, I won't understand their experience, because I'm not a fucking idiot. I actually sit down and take the time to **read fucking words** to learn how shit works.
---
It's not that fucking hard you stupid, dense, cabbage.
---
Do i make contract with high collateral and have someone track the JF??
---
yes, brave and test were victims to our insidious plans. evil, as in fruits of the devil, evil.
---
like you guys haven't ever done anything to piss off the rest of the universe. get your head out of your ass. you are no fucking angels yourselves. but oh, no let's stick to the narrative. kool-aid, thy name is querns
---
Sorry I forgot the game is in a perfectly balanced state right now and doesn't need any changes.
---
If not, that would make CVA very ineffective grave robbers!
---
No need. There are a very small number of lowsec gateway systems next to highsec.
---
Cyno alt kept in each, nyx 1 jump away from each.
---
Thots and players
---
You could try to do that, but you will need to know the route and which character is moving it. A lot of JF pilots have at least more than one spare JF alt to move stuff. TBH no one should be losing JFs in low-sec with citadels. Anchor your structure, and no one can blow you up like that because of tether mechanics.
---
Is the “Eve is dying” a meme or does it have any basis in reality? I see all these posts about Goon basically conquering null sec and having just got into the game idk if it’s trolling or truthful
---
l mine because l just enjoy that part of the game for me its 1000% more fun then pvp but thats me
---
Bro there's a fucking show info option for all of these questions....
---
Can you still put down POSes or do you need to use the upwell structures now?

---
Lots of ISK.
---
How much you payin?
---
Bombs had a high damage but a high explosion radius. 
---
I used 5k exp radius in my original example but I think maybe 15-20k may be better
---
to limit dmg to capitals. Titans have around 20k+ sig radius so full damage would only apply to them. For example:
---
40k dmg and 20k explosion radius.
---
8 x 40k x (20k sig radius/20k exp radius) = 320k dmg on a Titan(not calculating resists). 
---
8 x 40k x (10k sig radius/20k exp radius) = 160k dmg to capitals
---
 I get the whole point everyone wants to make about "Well this needs to affect this but not affect this, etc." but you have to make something that works within the constraints of the system that is already there. A huge overhaul for limited changes is not reasonable. Right now dmg is calculated a few ways, and raw dmg and exp radius is how bomb dmg is calculated. You can't completely mitigate dmg to capitals and only apply it to Titans. Damage to capitals will be half whatever is applied to Titans using the current formula.
---
Its even funnier when you realize that we know you don't care.
---
We're just bored.
---
More like 2 years and most of that time was us planing on leaving once Init became a krabbing &amp; renter alliance.  Not to mention Init was nothing like it is now when we joined (no sov, living in NPC null, ~2k members).
---
I think he means that once those shitlers get kicked from goons, they'll probably come crawling to NCPL, hoping for another safe haven they can milk for free krabbing.
---
Wow how’s that going for you guys then?  
---
Looks at tribute in dotlan...

Looks like it’s mindless spodbrains 1 - 1337 battle hardened rage bonered squad 0

I'd take a street dog over sort any day.
---
I am not earning anything from this. This is a personal project with 2 objectives: Personal learning and a voluntary service to future batches by providing them with non-boring data-sets. This is outside of my job description as a TA, and I am doing this out of my interest and as a hobby. To make data-sets and give them to my professor without any cost, so that the data can be used in class or for assignments. Nor will my professor be making any money off of it. It is just a voluntary contribution towards learning efforts of myself and future students.
---
That’s what makes Eve great- very divergent play styles and all intricately tied together.
---
&gt;Lobbying, persuasion, or interest representation is the act of attempting to influence the actions, policies, or decisions of officials in their daily life, most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies.
---
Gonna leave this for you. You seem to struggle with basic comprehension. If you can't draw the correlation between that and the CSM, I don't know how else to explain it.
---
I was just quoting the line from beer fest about zjs
---
Hold up.lets try and be able to sell from inside a container first.
---
So at $20 for 2 billion x 8 is $160, where the heck is he getting all that money?
---
One of the best parts of the Imperium is how they create a false sense of security.
---
Groups join them in the hopes of being super protected, and that noone will ever entosis them or kill their toys.
---
Goons have the attention span capable of sticking to something for about 1 month. So every time they shift their sigs, a new group is open, ready to be harassed.
---
I love the Imperium.
---
Tbh, HTP have been running an anti-provi campaign for quiiiiiite some time, albeit unsuccessfully.
---
not this year
---
yeah like you will kick them. they bring home the proverbial bacon and fry it up in a sotiyo. and what makes you think we will go back to the sov lifestyle? if you were in on that meeting, i would love to see the screenshots
---
But bombs would probably still kill the servers. There is a reason they disabled titan explosion AoE on death again.
---
Pornmaker is killing jfs all the time! I wanna know how he does it
---
10,000%.  I was in that last ihub battle in B0Z1-0 and it killed my client 3x.  Logged off for the night.  Wasn’t fun.  
---
Small gang is fun I enjoy that.  20-30 man roams are fun too but both of these sorta depend on others (and actual players instead of botting vnis).  
---
Being a miner/Indy main focus its fun too when you’re being defensive from a gang of neuts on their own roams.  I sorta feel like the sweet spot is in that 40v40 where the grid isn’t a total cluster and tidi doesn’t dilute the talent required of the fleets.  The slower the tidi the more time fcs and members have to react and think about their decisions. Hell maybe even read intel and pings to see how to react.  It’s just not fun.
---
ahah what is it even trying to say
---
I played as an alpha for two years, you won't get isk rich but you can do a lot and once you do buy into Omega you will have the basic skills to fly bigger ships and know what you have fun doing.
---
So just play for free till the time is right for you to upgrade.
---
yep :)
---
That's a possibility I suppose. Calculating the dmg to every ship in the explosion radius would put a decent load on the server.
---
It WILL NOT take months to clear out delve. It WOULD take months if all structures are defended. But usually you can force out a decisive battle and then you have a free run to raid everything...
---
You want to tell me that killing 10+ POSes was not as stupid as citadels? At least you can easily kill structures with very few people once unmaned... That was simply not the case for POSes.
---
I had to clear out structures after a war more than once now in TEST. Yes, it was annoying... not neither more nor less annoying when we also had to clear out all moon POSes. Except that we can now drop a few caps on 40+ Structures simultaneously after Victory.
---
Shit man when i flew as a spectre FC, we all knew HTP was behind shenanigans.
---
the TLDR is, he waits for the idiots that don't align before warping.  They sit and wait at the popular gates used to get to high-sec. They also have multiple cyno alts, when they notice you jump in JF they will then attempt to get you. If you align and not warp to before warping, you can dock the second they jump in. If you just hit warp to, you waste precious seconds and will probably be blown to bits depending on server ticks.
---
I put the MFA seed as note to every entry
---
I read somewere that he setup a courier and puts shitty but heavy items in it. So it has to be transported by JF then he puts high collateral on them and when he blows them up he gets shit tons of isk but i need to know how to catch them
---
did you even read? It would be more like an ANTI dread.
---
In a fight, dreads are there to deal dmg and just die. And hopefully kills faster than dying.
---
But this ship would instead of being strong and stationary, be little-armored but fast moving. So it would either die really fast against their counter (high tracking subs) or it would be able to hold grid against caps. Dreads DO NOT die fast against subs, but they do die against other caps eventually.
---
And since it's a T2 BS, it would be completely difference in terms of production, skills, etc
---
Do we know he works at 7-11? He could be an investment banker like that autistic dude who shorted the housing market in 2008.
---
Hmm. It seems no matter what you fit, you die. My professional opinion is to fly just the hull. Fittings are expensive.
---
Did you edit your question? Just make a new one. :-)
---
Myrmidons are good with a passive shield tank because they have plenty of mid slots. Quite a few ships with armor bonuses can do this for the same reason. (You'll occasionally see shield tanked Stratii or Nestors, for example.)
---
?  who didn't think Spectre was aligned with HTP/Waffles on this already?
---
Maybe a few Spectre participants are not aware, but I doubt they'd care one way or the other, they just want fights/kills.
---
It’s a test bomber fleet. Hey ditch the cloaks and put more tank on bombers as well as running them with boosts command dessies and logi to stay on grid with supercap response fleets
---
In theory yes, in reality no... There are really few examples doing this. It's a hassle to manage 50 SP alts, it's a hassle to manage 10 rorqs. Most veterans simply do not care to make another 200billion to buy a third titan. That is simply not the case.
---
If it was, we would see fleets far beyond the current titan numbers. But we don't.
---
They do that have an idea of when the JF will come by, if anything its extra isk. You don't need to put up a courier contract. It's all about patience really, and the fact that you have a super cap heavy alliance more than willing to help you out if you get pointed helps a lot.
---
Anyone want to translate?
---
I would hope that you cannot make ISK for harassment. If you are harassing folks, I'm glad you were kicked.
---
l just like flying my rorqs n rping as a miner lol
---
They can't really "conquer" nullsec.  The mechanics that allow them to win mean that they have to remain in a limited amount of space.  Null is huge and the logistics of moving even halfway across are also huge (and mean Goons can't krab while they are doing it).
---
They can today take whatever they choose to take.  But they can't take all of null and they can't defeat an entity that refuses to fight and is willing to move.
---
So join EvE.  Enjoy some of the best and most complicated of cooperative play....  so long as you avoid Goons and their endstage farmville playstyle.
---
Probably 50-70% of the player base ignores goon politics in-game though maybe they read about it here and occasionally have to avoid it in-game.
---
YES
---
I made 70k one year and spent 50k on "fun", it was the best pussy I ever bought.
---
God where the fuck do I sign the fuck up.
---
The way you say awmox is the cherry on top. It's Awox you chud. If you manage to light a cyno and tackle a carrier at the same time it'd be a marked improvement on your previous attempts.
---
hehehe, lol.  Oh man classic.
---
Is Brave disbanding? Because cache is in the gray area
---
go to zkillboard.com, enter your characters name, and you will see what ship and weapons he used to kill you.  You might be able to find his fit on his own losses of that type of ship (though that might not be the case).
---
If you like it (or just tell us the ship and weapons used to kill you) we can probably tell you what happened from that information alone.
---
I never liked the GotG guys :(
---
How so? People need to mine / rat. So they arent just going to stop.
---
Join a nullsec corp.  Choose wisely.  If you don't like your choice, choose another.
---
Big or small depends on your own tastes and whether they are newbro friendly.  Even ask about them on reddit.  People here will help you avoid the trash ones.
---
Yes and no. Depends on whats attacking
---
Hello I was wanting to make a little ad to advertise salvaging for mission runners. I dont need the risk, but I enjoy the activity. I'm trying to make a small "how to" that would be easy to follow and net me some blue loot to tractor and salvage, because I do want to fly the Noctis. Here is what I have...
---
1. Invite me to fleet
---
2. I get my own bookmarks and drop fleet
---
3. Complete mission
---
4. I salvage and pay you immediately (25%)
---
But I would. I’ve had an account for almost ten years but I’ve had sub for less than 1 year total. I’m so far behind in skills I’ll never catch up. Being able to start fresh and actually be able to compete would be magical for me.
---
start with one.  Maybe make another alpha for the other task to see if you like it.
---
As you learn more you will know what you can and can't do, what you would like to do, and how much of it you would like to pay for.
---
“Are we the bad guys”
---
Accelerators only affect the speed of SP generation (new SP) so no they are unrelated.
---
it means that loose lips sink ships.
---
And how would you track where players are living?
---
Lvl 1 ore is pretty worthless (considering it cannot be compressed)
---
But lvl 2 and 3 ores could worth highsec miner's time

I think he means isk. Data is valuable in Eve.

Yes, but there are 2x Type IDs for wach of them with the same Name

I mean, that's an HTP (not spectre) person talking to a TRC(Not spectre) person, so they're just trolling you.
---
I'm not sure if I received the reward or not, probably not though. I don't really think unsubbed accounts should get rewards. But you should not have to log in a certain amount of times to get rewards for being a player. Not every one that enjoys this game is a nolife.
---
TEST should switch sides. That would make this conflict fun!!
---
Witness the death of Eve
---
At this stage, what changes can CCP make that would take power away from the Imperium? Deleting their assets? Removing their sov? It's too late, sunshines.
---
Nothing you do can stop it. You all got outplayed while you were busy crying "HURR DURR GOONS, GUDFIGHTS" and half the shard somehow is now owned by the Imperium. 
---
Hardly a surprise. It's the only alliance that used all possible tools of the game, the dirty tricks and the "fair" ones, to win, while the rest of you were circlejerking and busy getting divided like the useless muppets that you are. Divide and conquer has never been as easy as with the EvE community.
---
Well, just a bit more, they will sing you a lullaby and end it.
---
I would recommend getting to know the game really well as alpha, get used to grinding, then buy omega once and use your expanded skills and options to make that 2 bil isk for next month.
---
I am saying that phones are very vulnerable.
---
* Click happy people that downloads lots of apps.
---
* No anti-virus
---
* Browsing dodgy sites that can run scripts.
---
* WiFi, less secure connection.
---
* Physically available for theft.
---
As for man in the middle, yes, people do use e-mails and they do 2FA on the same WiFi device. It is far less likely than a site cracked with shared details but it does all depend on how targeted it all is (man in the middle is more likely in a corporate or industrial setting).
---
* Get a user's e-mail and password.
---
* Get a copy of their CV by trolling recruitment sites as an employer.
---
* If that doesn't have enough details, see if you can friend them randomly on Farcebook.
---
Once you have email, password and enough to masquerade as them then you just need to SIM jack them.
---
SIM jacking usually happens after everything else that is needed has been obtained.
---
Yes if you can afford it. Grinding ISK to plex is a pain

How would they work?
---
Skill injectors aren't really a problem, it is what you can unlock. No-one cares if you inject into a black ops, marauder, t3c or similar. It's rorquals (because of 'unlimited' ores) and titans. Make titans a big dread (with siege, sameish dps as a dread, better tank) that can bridge stuff when in siege(no doomsday)  and things look alot better.
---
&gt;is  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; is great for frigate fits, matchups, strats etc.  He has made solo frigate pvp into a fucking science. Although it only encompasses T1, navy and pirate hulls, not T2. Just thought you should know about it regardless
---
Thank you for this!
---
Meh I think that therenare only few available options:
---
1. Cap the maximum daily amount you can inject skill points, like daily alpha injectors.
---
2. Like T3 remove skill points when you get killed in a cap super in percentage of how many cap skill point you already have trained.
---
And the one think I always thought eve is missing: skill point acquired doing in game actions, for example adding 1 sp into minmatar frigate per every X sec spent flying a rifter, or using a module, etc etc
---
I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the ~~Trump Administration~~ spectre chat..
---
fear not ppl of provi, not all pilots in spectre wants too destroy your way of living, we just want to join random NPSI fleets and shoot random stuff
---
the provi stuff is not NPSI, so we are some ppl that will never join fleets that going close to provi as long as the "campaign" goes on 
---
ofc ones its over we can go back and get nice fights again
---
The pvp actually used to be fun, before people just dogpiled into the mega alliances.

🤑🤑🤑 buy more plex. Lel but nah it’s dead Jim. Game’s dead 😞

You do know that OTEC was a GSF-lead initative right?

---
You can be a buttmad faggot all day but NCdot wasnt even an alliance until August 2010.  Pl was probably still less than 1k members, the dude is outright boldfaced lying
---
This change is not so much a buff for the little guy, but I'll think about it for a bit and will get back to you later today!
---
Does the code only work on meteor pack?
---
&gt; Woo boy. Calm your nerd brain for a moment. Remember that this is a game.
---
You do remember CCP used to have an economist for this game yeah? "Calm your nerd brain for a moment" lmfao
---
When CCP announced that AT was dead, they said they would provide a lot of support for player-run tournaments. 
---
Sadly, that was a lie. There has not really been anything worthwhile to watch in terms of EVE tournament action since last year's AT. Anger Games will not happen either, CCP gave a hard cap on the number of participants. 
---
SSI2 VODs are on the Streamfleet YouTube channel if that's up your alley: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCySzBY5xLidXiXbXqzrMNiA/videos
---
CCP says AT will return in 2020, but that remains to be seen. It's unlikely to happen, they can barely keep the Thunderdome tool running and working as is.

I didn’t, but only recently started joining Spectre fleets. Things make a lot of sense now, like in first venture in to Providence we were told not to shoot ships from certain corps/alliances despite us supposedly being NPSI. Then when things started to get hot the FCs warped out saving themselves leaving the rest of us to die. Back to Bombers Bar for me, I’m done with Spectre
---
I'm aware, I ended my subscription over half a year ago. It's no longer fun to play EVE for me :( But I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one :(
---
Legion and Proteus are the least popular T3Cs for a reason. Producers will produce and seed accordingly.
---
Also dont mind my awesome spelling...skill level isn't at 5 yet
---
I was thinking the same thing.
---
true but l find pvp overrated, but that's me and my why of playing eve
---
It's true if you really need . 
---
But you are in a game, people will just stop and wait thing change. Like people who stop play during war in Hi Sec.
---
A lot of solution could work only and only if eve is mandatory for live, but it's not the case. People will make less money, or stop playing . So less content beacause of less farming.
---
It's why andwer is not easy.
---
because PL is dead/dying? their way of playing the game is obsolete and they refuse to adapt to the times lol.
---
Are you gonna be Ok?
---
you really should read up on it security, you simply lack basic knowledge.
---
* There are malicious apps, but 99% they simply steal your contact number and sell them.
---
* Viruses are not really a thing on android, unless you call those apps viruses.
---
*  Those Websites usually try to sign you up for costly services, they dont read out your password or 2fa authentication.
---
* phone data is only vulnerable to theft if not locked by a code, which most people do. 
---
So yes, phones are vulnerable to some things, but they are not a target to get passwords/email accounts/etc.
---
again,most, if not all 2fa cannot at all be intercepted by man in the middle. For the the rest, all I have to say is that everything you mention is end to end encrypted, no one can actually intercept it. Everything else you mention is simply social engineering which is a probem and 2fa is an effective measurement against it (depending in the company)
---
You really should do a few hours of actual research (not some shitty ass vice articles) before you state untrue things
---
See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bxgi1n/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_june_06/eqxok0n/) for a slightly more detailed answer.
---
Isn't it too late? That just ensures that the people who got in early can't be countered by a horde of Nigerian princes who decide to win EvE one day.
---
I’m sorry to tell you this but you’re going to find the same thing in bombers bar. They will also ally with other attacking groups to kill the target of the op. It’s not inherently bad to team up with someone else to get a win in a fight. The bailing of an FC if he doesn’t call for the whole fleet to scatter is a dick move though.
---
Why so desperate to try to turn things around on me and mine? What we did, or what you think we did, is irrelevant to this discussion. I'm not passing judgement here; I'm simply telling everyone what NCdot and PL did, and why it led to what is currently happening to them. If you take offense to it, well, that's your problem.
---
Wait, you guys have billboards?
---
Are you dumb?
---
I was simply stating what those particular members were most likely to do should they get kicked for being shitlers.
---
Idc what NCPL is planning post-war.
---
&gt;No, this does not involve you sitting in rorquals
---
This is the major sticking point, I've found. Podbrains have convinced themselves that the meta gameplay style ITYOOL 2019 involves every good, honest, God-fearing PVPer being chained to a mining anomaly, [forced to break rocks apart against their will.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkwOem9Vl8)
---
Exactly, i so happy there’s others that understand. Its just so rare to find people like you. &lt;3 bro mance!
---
lmao i knew someone would eventually notice. flying a sunesis, which for whatever reason has no cpu whatsoever. also my skills are bad
---
Get some friends and fly with them, will have more fun in smaller fleets where your iniciative matters.
---
well, tbh you're the guy who said "once" and not "should they", and why on gods green earth would they want to come here? if you haven't read the pings, you're glassing tribute. maybe you should pull your head out of your ass.  most likely they will go to somewhere...i dont know... NOT being destroyed??? 
---
Now who's the idiot?
---
Bombers Bar has been running with Winter Co./Panfam contracts lately. Mar5hy is being personally paid to do camping contracts, and massively multiboxes cyno campers--hence the easy content--but uses BB to hit exclusively the contracted targets like TEST, Brave, and Goons. There was a whole fiasco recently where Mar5hy emptied the BB wallet (see the recent announcements about SRP reduction) and the arguments led to Cowkiller leaving the group, and BB being kicked out of the Covert Appreciation Society hole.
---
Bombers Bar is still content, and the FCs won't bail on you because that's just a dick move. But be aware it's partisan, and it's personally enriching Mar5hy.
---
&gt; Instead you mocked us as spodbrained miners who would never pose a threat to you.
---
I mean they weren't wrong, you were killing your own game worse than you ever threatened their enjoyment.
---
There's a world of difference between balance and forcing players into a gameplay style they don't want.
---
True
---
This is a symptom of bad player behaviour. It doesn't matter what the mechanics are, as long as n+1 tactics are effective, players will blob up into collectively larger groups that stifle enjoyable content.
---
A nyx/hel will alpha for about 400k damage. Toons like pornmaker will just have a cyno burning in a cheap ship next to lowsec station all day. When jf undock because pilot is retard, pornmaker will appear and delete jf.
---
This also works with rorqs if you get 3+ supers. If all fire at once, rorq goes from full to dead in one tick. Most rorq pilots dont know this and will wait to hit panic.
---
It's fake
---
all packs.
---
Want to play the game? Worth it. 
---
Don't want to play the game? Not worth it.
---
Ezpz
---
Poor poor goons; yes, i too forget that "you arent here to ruin the game, you're here to ruin OUR game".
---
but we are the boogeyman. sure, have your cookie. i get that because goons have 5 billion members you've won the game and get to write history how you like. you're the victims, everyone is out to get you blah blah blah. you're the heroes of the story.
---
what flavour of kool aid is it again? right, mittens jizz. keep drinking it.
---
No, player/alliance behaviour follows from human tendencies, to bulk together into the largest, safest possible groups to prevent danger to themselves. It's almost impossible to deal with this, as you'd have to implement some incredibly weird mechanics to stop this behaviour. This is not a product of game mechanics. You'd prettymuch have to delete the standing system altogether, and even then, people would just coordinate in one convoluted fashion or another, to maintain the current system of player behaviour.
---
lmao hey guys an alliance that Asher and a sig of literally only Ishtars  obliterated could have prevented this!!
---
Gotta bring in that revenue up for the korean overlord Pearl Abyss. Sadly AT isn't a good short term solution  
---
I wish I could put /s to the end.

---
NO YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!
---
Either way you're flying for PanFam. Why not simply join PanFam
---
You can be a toiletbowl licking deep fried ear lice dipped in bellybutton lint snacking queer yourself who the fuck made you fucking reddit police is beyond me
---
You sure do have a lot of resentment built up. Why is that? You're venting it all over a completely unrelated conversation.
---
No, support means more in this case. It means, there was a contract between DRF and NCdot, for NCdot support against Skillu, that NCdot accepted and got paid for. Also it means KillahBee would probably come via MTO if DRF escalated with supers, like he did already in support of gotg.
---
I'm not saying you were not good in what you were doing, but reality of what happened is more complex then you are painting. 
---
Tell me if I'm seeing something wrong: with the support from  powerbloc, you killed DRF, about 250 half-dead people that were fighting for 8-9 months holding 2 fronts; after that you again killed half-dead people, TRI. Then you deployed south, and very, very quickly returned back. Got fat, got wallet emptied by CCP and now its "game is not good".
---
This is hilarious! Well done.
---
What ideas/mechanics exactly do you think they can come up with, that prevent players from reducing their risk of loss, by making friends with everyone else? Corp and alliance leaders are the cancer that are killing eve, not CCP. Everyone who decides, I'm going to join/stay in a group that is part of the doughnut, is someone who's actively choosing to stifle content in eve, and favour safety and boredom over risk and fun.
---
I have no pity for it. It was PanFam's own doing. I like to think of it as PanFams' past catching up with it just like Goons in WWB/Casino War.
---
Resentment? Nah, I just think you are personally full of shit.
---
I don't krab other than abyssals ...and I've even won a few abyssal 1v1s....so much fun
---
Can you explain to a newbie in a couple of sentences, on what these logs are, where do people obtain them and what do buyers get out of them?
---
What does that mean?
---
You are extremely oversimplifying and making wrong assumptions. Titans and supers used to be fine because of several mechanics that made owning them a living hell. No keepstars meant you had to either park them in an xlsma or keep a char inside at all times, and hope that the pos you parked it in didn't get blown up. XLsma had very limited space, training the needed skills used to take over a year and there were no injectors, or rorqual fleets to even provide the minerals for mass production. 
---
Now, if you are reasonably well off in a nullsec alliance you can have a new titan and a fully skilled character to use it in a couple months or so. It's mainly due to injectors that people can achieve these income levels, and along with rorqual changes, that the needed minerals even exist in the market. And even the rorqual changes wouldn't be this bad if they still took a year and a half of training, as would be the case without injectors.
---
&gt; Can't believe you're getting downvoted for this.
---
I can. The blue doughnut exists because most eve players prefer safe boredom over fun, engaging, risky content, and they know that deleting standings and local would make shit fun again.
---
i fell asleep ratting last night and woak up awoxed by my entire corp alliance lol
---
At this point whatever CCP says is just a laugh.
---
if you were told not to shoot particular ships from particular corps or alliances, that's most likely because *those are the dudes that aren't in your fleet that are helping make the target of the fleet you're on dying an actual possibility*. 
---
If you shoot them, not only are you denying yourself content by shooting the people helping your FC provide it, you're likely denying everyone else in the fleet content too. 
---
Only shoot what's broadcasted, how hard is it to do?
---

How about a game of ~~chess~~ Space Engineers?

Usually the AT ties in with fanfest (CCP-run EVE convention) which also did not happen this year due to the venue it is usually hosted in being renovated. As fanfest returns next year, so should the Alliance Tournament.
---
Can you please share a few examples of what kind of data is valuable and how do people generate such data and how do users profit off of it?
---
Since I am new, an example that immediately pops up is that you estimate if a item is undervalued or overvalued in the market and then applying basic 'buy low-sell high' on it.
---
When you don't actually have the power to stop the group around you from doing what they want in your area if they wanted to, they don't actively try to remove you, and you don't really interfere with them, you're pretty much part of them.
---
For pointing out the ultimately self-destructive things NCdot and PL did? Don't shoot the messenger, now.
---
You airing out all of your frustration and resentment upon hearing someone say less-than-flattering things, despite the fact that two parties acting poorly can occur simultaneously without either being diminished or exacerbated, seems counterproductive and ultimately self-destructive. I'd recommend calming down.
---
Titans where broken since day one. That they where a PITA to use never made them balanced or fine, you where just less likely to run into one.

It's not an anti-provi campaign at all. The only times we've ever done a real anti-provi campaign it's been to evict specific alliances, all of which have been resoundingly successful. HTP loves provi!
---
Can a nyx alpha a thanatos?
---
I'm hoping it isnt worth it honestly.  THis game already has far too many mining resources flooding the market.  Adding more was a poor choice and will only devalue everything more.

---
just because most of the game is repetitive and fucking boring, doesn't mean we need or want more of it to be.
---
Sort of. However, long term trends in market data over large swaths of space gathered at great pains by merchants form the backbone of establishing trade routes. If everyone knows that data then the profitability of those trade routes will plummet as the market adjusts to fill any demand. Market data is jealously guarded and so comes at a premium to offset the potential losses from sharing that data.
---
When you say "move each and every one" into a container - you're not saying you're dragging them individually, are you? If so, drag-select or ctrl+a and then move.

---
For PVP, I grab a Caracal. Cheap and easy to replace. Fun to fly because it's both reasonably fast and reasonably tanky. Does good damage. And plenty of other people dock Caracals in the same station, with more on contract if I need to replace.
---
Missions? I love my Gila. Hits hard, kills stuff, isn't overly slow.
---
Solo PVP? Atron. I don't have to worry about forgetting drones if I don't have drones. I prefer armor over shields (I wish there were T1 armor-tanked missile platforms). This fast little guy can hit hard enough that I have an excellent record against other T1 ships. Comets always die to the next guy after me, so even though I don't win, I still win on zkillboard.
---
Yes, it is beyond you evidently. When you see somebody lie, you call them on it, that's how normal people function
---
Yeah it's a mondo bummer for sure.  Falcon made the announcement quite early this year to prepare potential teams stating that the AT was on hiatus this year.  With the Invasion World tour, and I assume whatever is going down the development pipeline, CCP decided they didn't have enough resources to make an engaging tournament.
---
The last few years, EVE NT (a player group), took on more and more responsibility of the production side of the AT, but there's still stuff that we can't do: be refs, iterate the format/rules, create prizes, etc.  So CCP had a choice: run the same thing they did last year with unstable servers, or just put it on hold for a year in order to devote proper time to it.  
---
No matter their reasoning, I'm super bummed it's not here.  For the last 8 years, it's something I've thrown literally hundreds of hours into.  Plus, with proper planning, they definitely could have tied it in with a Triglavian invasion.  
---
Something like yo, Triglavians are invading and have challenged the most worthy capsuleers to a FITE.  Capsuleers have to battle it out to be THE FINAL CHAMPION against the Triglavians biggest badass, and if they win all capsuleers get a prize and if they lose well we're fucked aaaaaaaaaahhhh.
---
But yea it's gone until 2020.  There is a player-run tournament called the Streamfleet Seasonal Invitational II (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCySzBY5xLidXiXbXqzrMNiA/videos), and each of the invasion world tour sites have a Competitive Eve Thing™ where winners get flown to Fanfest.  
---
Pretty sure there will be a noticeable impact, not necessarily with the absence of the AT itself but with how people interpret it.  There are already a large portion of players who feel like the game is moving away from them, and for a bunch of them they feel like this is just more proof that it's time to move on.  I'm personally not there, but honestly I don't blame them.
---
What do you have against the Welsh?
---
The lowest difficulty is the only fair one. It's just that the AI is too incompetent to play fair.
---
If you want a bit of a light fix on the competitive scene, I put together a tournament a few months ago, though it sadly wasn't able to be streamed.
---
You can watch it on the Streamfleet YT channel here! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCySzBY5xLidXiXbXqzrMNiA

---
Well the good news is once NCPL is gone we can start over and let a more willing enemy organically take over the burnt land of the north.
---
No it's exactly how he described, they hit warp to instead of align first so when the nyx jumps in the jf is unable to dock without first stopping the ship. That wastes time and ends in usually a dead jf
---
It's just revealing a truth that's been in place for a couple years.  Goons and friends were the only group that actively embraced and adapted to the game after the changes to sov, structures, and mining.  This is just what happens when, for years, only one side is working towards winning.
---
That's just a lie, not sure who said that, but it's completely wrong. Those two things aren't tied to eachother and have never been.
---
I really hope this turns out not being true... but it does sum up the current situation well.
---
I think they can come up with more intelligent A.I. 
---
When the Triglavians where announced, explosions happened in my brain. I thought CCP had invented what we all thought the Jove where meant to be (even though originally they were meant to be playable). Blue doughnuts can be avoided if intelligent A.I./NPC existed, attacking with the force of a human alliance; literally the borg. They could destroy entire constellations. Players could attack those who are being attacked by the A.I. from the back door, splitting forces. Destruction measurements need to supersede  the monthly MER of ore being mined. Its not calculated correctly and that is the mistake CCP is making, has made and will continue to do so unless they create better A.I. with higher difficulty rating which have a mind of their own regarding tactics and total annihilation of the largest null sec player alliances.
---
Sites had several bugs which prevented payout. They took them down to fix the bugs. 
---
This is just the result of ccp not wanting people to know what the sites look like, but also not testing thoroughly on sisi before hand.

I think it's a bullshit excuse, but it seemed to be what they were implying. World Tour spread out, no time for AT. Or something.
---
Surely nobody is naive enough to think a new entity will pop up from thin air, and be given enough time and space to grow large enough to challenge anyone without aligning to an existing side.
---
I mean i don't reccomend it but you do you.
---
ehhhhhhh i agree Indy and Science PVE isn't hard at all.. really entirely depends what your running.. a BC can make dank isk in wh space. only thing that REALLY needs alot of skills is High End DED sites like 10\10's maybe even 6's im not sure what the minimum is to run them. But i know a decent dedicated char can run all the Hs content in the game if they know what theyre doing.
---
Sites presently do not despawn until someone warps to them. If you need higher site regen, you may want to consider moving to a region where there is more krabbing going on.
---
You mean the ones like Hero that PL destroyed when they wouldn't be a feeder alliance for PL? Why do you think Horde exists? And PL did that so goons made Karmafleet to make sure they didn't get outgrown by NCPL.

Results of hitting that button. It's just data, if it's very old it's not very valuable because the numbers will be irrelevant (due to changes in the game and so on). But it's still data, and that's what you've asked for.
---
That gives you a decent amount of data, and could be helpful for your project, but it doesn't give the whole picture nor does it tell you the live demand. Don't get me wrong, a lot of us use that tool. But it's also crowd sourced data and the most profitable data isn't uploaded to it. In short, it's skewed data that would help fledgling traders, but master traders still have their secrets.
---
i can agree this is probably the real problem. if i can park X amount in a belt and not have to interact with most of them for 20 mins thats kinda busted
---
even with multiple people only one has to really be paying attention the rest just have to be on commz lol. its silly.. its almost like whats the point in mining in anything but a Rorq for every alt.. only issue is cost..
---
I wasn't around then and I'm not responsible for it. What is your point? The time of smaller alliances duking it out is long over, but I would have loved to have been around then. It's all megacoalitions now, and Horde just seemed the best pick for little new me. If there were tons of other, smaller groups I'd join them in a heartbeat.
---
Which would still suck.
---
Well, not if they quietly nerf mining everywhere else and force you to mine in hostile systems with actual defense fleets.
---
Bear with me for a moment: If anyone can just download that log, what makes it worth 100k? Surely there must be more processing done to those logs. If so, can you please give me an example supposing that me or you buy one of those logs for 100k. Can you give me a hypothetical random example of the sort of insight or actionable information that we might find in those logs?
---
lul, calm down
---
i'm not mad, bro, i'm pointing out your hypocrisy. you make us out to be the big bad wolf, when you guys have done just as shady and worse. 
---
i don't resent anything. like I said, i just think you are full of shit
---
i make no excuses or spin about anything my side has done. as long as I have been here we haven't been the biggest fish in the pond. at one time we may have had the sharpest teeth, but that's not the same thing.
---
besides, what you call poaching really is more often than not, people in less cap strong alliances going where the grass is a little greener. is this not happening in delve? now that you have the most titans in the game are you going to stop taking in pilots from other alliances because you're poaching?
---
I'm just the messenger
---
Surely you are not naive enough to think that power vacuums just stay empty without anybody taking advantage of an unopposed vacancy in 3 whole regions of space. The whole point of this was to scuttle NCPL and then deliberately let something else take their place. Maybe even propping that enemy up over time. 
---
I am not playing Fozzie Sov anymore, I haven't been since I made my post predicting all this. I am playing spore and right now I need goons to remove NCPL so I can plant seeds and monoliths. Garden Grown Bad Guys with less than a 2 year turn around. You don't need to understand. You don't need to believe me. Just stay out of my way.
---
That was a rhetorical question
---

Ask test its one of their languages
---
... are you using expanded probe launcher?
---
Yup, but instead of folding up like NCPL they tried other options.
---
What's the E3 code? O.o
---
You know what the contents are, and if you don't then you're not worth your credentials. The only difference between the logs I'm providing and the ones you can get right now, is that I got the logs at a different point in time, and you cannot fetch logs back in time like that from the game client, as you can only export the current order list.
---
You keep trying to make this about Goons. Why? It's unrelated. No amount of you venting your spleen about Goons is gonna make this conversation about Goons.
---
Too bad their site is crap. Made one account and it locked.
---
Then made another and it kept charging then refunding my credit card and taking me back to card details.
---
the issue is that way more people are leaving then new people are joining. 
---
We can clearly see on serenity what very low pvp activity paired with ultra crabbing ( bot or not bot ) and supercoalitions leads to. 
---
The game mechanics are so heavily skewed in one direction at the moment that it's driving people out of the game and preventing loads of new people either from doing anything else than joining the blobs or staying in the game at all. 
---
Go ahead and tell people to adapt to your "empire building" nonsense, Eve is rapidly heading towards a point where the old eve is dying meme becomes reality
---
Yeah man, y'all are cool.
---
When I used to live in Provi with CF it always seemed like you guys were public enemy #1 and that you hated CVA &amp; friends, etc. evil meanies, whatever.
---
And then CVA preached this narrative that HTP wanted to evict everybody in provi and ruin the region and sell it to panfam etc 
---
But I knew better. You guys were just cool cats who wanted to rustle CVAs jimmies and blow stuff up. Still don't know why everyone hated that Zeffer guy so much though...
---
Jesus fucking christ, can you read?
---
Hey, that's how I lost my ark!!!
---
I realized after the fact that where I had landed from the jump would have allowed me to safely align to gate and warp while within the docking but the undock was immediately out of range.
---
It will be gone next year as well.. You simply don't drop something like AT for a year that plays such a big part of the community. They dropped it this year they say due to no time due to other events. Next year it will be that much easier to set it aside..
---
New company took over they see AT as a big money sink.
---
Oh, I know that, but sadly World Tour has been a shitshow. The streams have all sucked and there has been nothing worthwhile that came out of it.
---
Shouldn't be able to. May take a second try.
---
Agreed, very disappointing so far. That's why I said it seems like a bullshit excuse.
---
Except for the fact that we've successfully played keep away from provi with a whole constellation for over a year now...  
---
Yea, super unsuccessful.
---
&gt; One day you can fly for 5 hours and get like 200 mil, and the other you can get 700 mil from just one forgotten C2 system. 
---
Are you talking about the the sleeper relic/data sites in C1-3 WHs? If yes, what explorer ship and fit do you use to run these sites? 
---
&gt; Sure running lvl 4 missions with my set up can also be decent and risk free, but it becomes boring and repetitive pretty fast. We need more FUN pve missions.
---
Which missions are you particularly talking about and what ship/fit do you use?
---
A nyx fully gank fit can oneshot (or close to oneshot) a squishy active tanked ratting thanny with low resists.
---
In all likelihood it will take you 3-4 shots otherwise.
---
Baseless? NC/PL regions are getting glasses, they are putting up almost no fight, no one is helping them to fight back, they alienated their biggest remaining allies from WWB... All of this stuff is pretty much common knowledge.
---
Uh what? Were you even here in late 2015/early 2016 when WWB kicked off?
---
If you want to try it please tell me when and where and I can help you
---
It makes sense tactically, but undermines the original purpose of the group.
---
How would so many groups live in Thera?
---
The AT has always appeared to be the redheaded step-child of CCP, something that was tolerated because developers donated their time to run it. Now those devs are gone and CCP appears more interested in catering to casuals by making a softer, cuddlier version of the game in order to encourage them to stick around and spend money on micro-transactions. The AT doesn't fit that business model. While I certainly hope i'm wrong at this point I would be willing to bet good money that 2018 was the last year of the tournament. 
---
  
---
CCP also promised (in lieu of the AT) major updates this year and improved communication. So far we're halfway through June with nothing to show for it but some new skins, another half-baked incursion expansion, and a canned three minute announcement for a mobile game that sounded about as enthusiastic as an American POW reading a torture-induced confession in the Hanoi Hilton.
---
who?
---
Maybe after PanFam is dead.
---
This is the idea that will save eve.
---
Aeros Ranger is the leader of The Rogue Consortium
---
25% off Galaxy pack, makes it pretty worth. 1100 PLEX ($40), 3 months game time ($38) is more than the $75 you'd pay with the discount code. Plus 5 extractors and some skins. Not too terrible actually.
---
Thats literally why NCPL arent top anymore, because they didnt want to do the "farms and fields" gameplay
---
If you can't single target dps one titan down, why do you think bombs could?
---
Yeah, hundreds were logged in and waiting, but not many actually fought. I only brought in 1 of my 3 caps, and non of my supers. Frat and friends didn't want to have a cap fight so they never jumped more than a couple dreads and fax on the field. Test and friends dropped a shit load of carriers to kill frat and friends dreads, fax, and munins.
---
As a new player who has no idea who any of you are : obligatory can I have your stuff &amp; isk.
---
i like how you think you're making fun of me in a way that upsets me
---
You can still put them down but any module that has a citadel replacement won't work so no industry modules.
---
Yeah so an astero is a funky ship because it's a non-t2 ship with bonuses to t2 hardware (the cloak). I'm about to login, so if you want, reply or DM me with your character name and I can set you up with something simple/effective. More sophisticated fits I'll hold off on, IMO it's more important to learn the strengths of individual mods before you start weaving their function together.
---
Holding huge sov was supposed to be expensive.
---
Nice ninja edit.
---
For any JF pilots or potentials looking not to get volleyed:
---
* Align without warping. Warp only once at full warp speed. Don't even start aligning if you don't feel safe.
---
* Set desto to the station you undocked from as soon as you undocked. If anything happens hit ctrl-s to instadock.
---
* If you see another ship on grid just redock. Especially if it's undocking behind you.
---
* If you're empty or close to empty, tank it. I had an extreme autism version of this where I had tabled out literally every combination of lowslot fittings to be able to search the max ehp configuration for my cargo amount, but you dont need to do that.
---
* Look at NPC stations carefully and try not to pick kickout stations. If possible use a citadel.
---
* Don't trust random-ass freeport citadels. A raitaru of your own runs you less than a tenth the price of a JF. Or use your alliance's.
---
* Look at other JF kills periodically and note what's there. If those chars appear in local, just don't play with them.
---
* Remember that you're flying a 9b isk hull even if empty, and if full, much more than that. Don't gamble what you don't have to. If you need to wait a few hours--sit tight and wait.
---
* If you're down for it, have an exit cyno lit. In some high traffic systems it's become popular to cloak a high mass cruiser/bc/bs a bit off the gate, then decloak and instant bump a jf as it lands. If this happens or you're anxious about it, light your exit cyno and hover over the jump button--run instantly if stuff goes down.
---
There was a time Caps could bearly track subcaps.  And supers would just miss.  Removing this didn't help
---
what you're not getting is that those people are essentially blue, they're bluetral, because the fleet you're on wouldn't be happening without them.
---
it's like shooting your own scouts
---
Well, they thought they could get away with maintaining the status quo by renting out to farmers and using that income to subsidise their play style. Turns out you still have to actually get that ISK to your members somehow so they can build what they want/need.
---
Increasing cost for number of sov systems you own.  Make literally claiming the sov expensive.  If they didn't actually claim Sov in the north then some rando's could claim it.  I actually wished for the good of the game they just left them unclaimed, but what do i kno
---
~~NPSI~~ OSWB
---
I recommend you check out the ESI and get with some guys who do a lot of trading. You can get a lot of data on market buy and sell orders through the ESI. I used to do a lot of hauling between high sec markets that involved buying things cheaper in one place and selling it for a profit in another place.
---
Cristian Vladimirov there
---
you need ideas? it is probably too late already, but some ideas for damage reduction:
---
nerf asteroid sites - an alliance of gsf size should need at least 3, better 4 regions to match their current mining output.
---
change rorquals to a more active playstyle - make their drones like the supercarriers, you need to give the excavators commands. even autists should be unable to multibox more than 2 
---
nerf skill injectors - it is already too late for this, but beeing unable to inject above 10 million sp would still help the game 
---
remove asset safety
---
make moongoo regional specific again
---
limit number of citadels to maybe 4 to each system
---
remove 1 timer from them
---
massively nerf the anti subcap weapons on supers and titans
---
&gt; Pretty sure there will be a noticeable impact, not necessarily with the absence of the AT itself but with how people interpret it. There are already a large portion of players who feel like the game is moving away from them, and for a bunch of them they feel like this is just more proof that it's time to move on. I'm personally not there, but honestly I don't blame them.
---
I think this is a good way to put it. This has been very noticeable with our group (TURN LEFT/HYDRA RELOADED) and our wormhole group - some of us still play and roam, sometimes have good fights, but it has slowed down considerably from what it used to be. 
---
Many have given up on the game and there is little-to-no excitement or faith in CCP delivering an AT 2020 among most of the people I talk to from the more experienced AT teams. 
---
Oh well, will keep enjoying the game while I can, see how it pans out.
---
It's never looked like this.  At most one group owned ~1/3 of the map being nominally even with the other 2/3rd
---
Shhh don't tell anyone. It's more fun fighting koolaid drinkers.
---
&gt; what you still can do with POSes

 Yea its about like that.
---
I had fun playing eve today ❤
---
The rundown is that Spectre started shooting the jump bridge in R3, so CVA formed nightmares and they fled to an asteroid belt, the monitor got caught and the FC immediately ejected and warped off in his pod to die a minute or two later on the Misaba gate. Maybe/maybe not to unplug expensive implants. Anyway, free Monitor.
---
he lied. 'bergmann' does not translate from german.
---
&gt;Lowsec is fairly healthy in the FW zones. Outside of those it is very quiet for the most part. 
---
Outside of those and the Tama lane.
---
The announcement saying that SF was attacking Provi clearly said it will be different than the normal NPSI stuff. Just go on their fleets that aren’t hitting Provi if you don’t want to bother with that. 
---
Just like if you don’t like Mar5hy, there are a bunch of other Bomber’s Bar FC’s.
---
Alrght will be on in a bit
---
Shit dude, I have about an hour or two these days due to IRL as well, and most of my time is spent just going through delve, querious, and period basis and warping to forsaken hubs hoping to catch VNIs. 
---
Its generally boring but every so often I either get a loot pinata or some whining/broken english smacktalk in local or a PM, and that makes it worth it.
---
Give that a try, it beats ship spinning.
---
I heard that they're just a bunch of carebears and they're not allowed to undock during war because of neutrality rules. /s
---
FC What do?  
---
Just eject you fucks, we're done for, RUN!!!!!!
---
Honestly, I'm disappointed. SF had been pinging this Eagle fleet for days promising content. Got what I hear was a depressingly poor turnout and just ran from us as soon as we entered system. One of our tackle caught Redline's monitor because he warped later than the rest of his fleet out of an asteroid belt, so we warped in to shoot him.
---
We obviously hoped they might try to come back and try to save him, and were a little surprised when he ejected and warped his pod into a bubble on the misaba gate. Not sure if redline just wanted to gift us the monitor, maybe didn't want the lossmail and had missed the game mechanics change a few years ago that made that not work. Or he jsut thought that ejecting before we got bubbles up would give him enough time to rip his implants out?
---
I dunno. Seemed a weird move to me. Left us without a fight though. Spectre apparently tried to reform for a bit, we went a shot their forti in misaba for a while to encourage them to come and play and were briefly joined there by a small init jackdaw gang. But no fight from spectre :(
---
what about you go check the thanato's buffer and find out yourself instead of wasting everyone's time? dude already gave you an alpha amount
---
You can unplug while still in your ship
---
Literally just look at the reddit for 5 minutes. Were you bad at this game?
---
Whats your ingame name?
---
Pornmaker already killed me once.
---
It shouldn't buff directly the little guy it should weaken the big guys. Theres no point in buffing something.
---
Lmfaooo
---
The ones that have given up, where have they gone?
---
Ist unconfirmed but supposedly the SF FC got waved over by a player in one of those new police skins and told to get out of the car...err ship, turn around and put his hands on the roof of the ship. only partially complying the spectre FC got out of the ship but then continued his flight on foot...err pod.
---
That is legitimately one of the best things about Goons.
---
From the sheer scale of the alliance you have sigs bigger than most alliances in Eve you can deploy against for different conflicts in different timezones. You can basically farm any group you want. If/when they batphone for help you then call another sig/mainfleet to assist.
---
Probably just a ragequit move
---
audience is much larger than that
---
Maybe he panicked or didn't know? No idea.
---
"Provi-Today has reached out for comment from Spectre Command, and we will update you as the situations develops." :D
---
I approve of this message, 1 upvote for u
---
If you're disappointed, start fighting and stop using awox alts to end engagements before they begin. Embarrassing tactics especially when you outnumber your enemy 3-to-1 in bigger, stronger ships. I'm not going to fight you if you're just going to waste my time.
---
Instead, #madeyouform.
---
&gt;Goons and friends were the only group that actively embraced and adapted to the game after the changes to sov, structures, and mining
---
Genuinely curious how you believe Goons actively adapted to the changes, as opposed to the reality of the game changing and suiting their pre-existing model (i.e. max krab, max blob, "blueballs or helldunks")?
---
You wanted a war. This is war. Espionage, sabotage, headshotting, etc... We're just being good hosts.

If you want to go back to the fun roaming thing, we'd be happy to go back to that arrangement.

what for? i don't need random VNI kills.
---
It wouldn't force somebody to do anything it would balance out groups that are to big.
---
And when you think the current gameplay style is healthy for the game then you should clearly start thinking outside of goon propaganda. I for myself want a healthy game that can continou for a long period of time but when it goes on like this it will end up like serenity, with the exception that we can't migrate to another server like PIBC.
---
The Monitor was tackled by a fleet member and then warped onto by an 80-man Nightmare fleet. It was dead. I ejected the ship so that I could get to another one in Misaba. Luckily for you, my empty pod landed in a bubble and served you the *only* killmail you got on the fleet. Upon getting back to Misaba, I found that your fleet had increased in size and mine had dwindled so we opted to stand down.
---
This whole thing has been you guys trying to awox and DDOS me instead of fight me. Today, your awox got the tackle at the perfect moment. Shame you don't actually have the balls to take a fight otherwise you might feed another 120bil worth of Dreads again.
---
Sorry, your leadership doesn't want you to get fights. You'll have to settle for calling this post salty on reddit today.
---
Undocking doesn't solve the blue donut derp-derp. Nothing short of fundamental redesign by the development team will fix it.
---
It's honestly too late. Pandora's box was already opened.
---
If you were repping someone who got into that killmail, you also get into that killmail. Seems like a simple enough solution?
---
It doesn’t matter who it is, no one discusses opsec in local
---
Just use someone else's azbel or sotiyo.
---
Thanks to this post, hundreds of Provi pilots will be able to preserve enough meat to make it through the long winter.  God bless.
---
Well... the EVE: Burning Life novel actually briefly touches on that subject. There still are people with bad eye vision because there still are poor people who can't afford corrective surgeries and such - or may not want them. While the character in question wasn't one, why would, say, an Amarr overlord bother fixing the eyesight of a Minmatar slave? If it doesn't prevent the slave from performing his/her duties great, if it does, just get another slave.
---
Link a KM?
---
Embarrassing tactics? ,
---
Where you at all at the invasion of Provi when PL and NCdot outnumbered us? Then dropped titans and supers on our battlecruiser fleets? Sure sure...you guys were so looking for good fights back then. You guys went out of your way to purge and kill provi. Then get upset when we don't look for good fights with you.
---
If you are complaining about content just look at your statement. You want us dead. You have now become our content. We dictate how you experience it. You want a war? This is war. You want fun fleets. Lets do fun fleets. However, you will have neither fun nor enjoyment in your campaign here.
---
How expensive? Do you make costs go up the more systems you have? Or do you just make holding a single system expensive so you really need to use the space if you want to claim it?
---
For exponential growth of the costs of holding multiple systems: Just make as many holding alliances as you need, they only cost 1b up front and like 1-2m each month to maintain.
---
For space being expensive to hold: If it is too expensive there is no reason to hold space and everybody goes back to running incursions or doing triglavian shit to make ISK, leaving null a barren wasteland.
---
I agree with you on just leaving space unclaimed if you're not going to use it, but eh, they're "not here to ruin THE game, we're here to ruin YOUR game".
---
They have recently modified the stats  on invading precursor entities, with the addition of Major Conduits. I don't think the resistances are correct. I do half the damage on any of these compared to previous damage I was doing with the same fit.
---
&gt;who didn't think Spectre was aligned with HTP/Waffles on this already?
---
Yeah this isn't old news. A lot of Spectre FC's play well with HTP/WAFFLES...for half a decade now?
---
You guys posted your dumbass war declaration. That wasn't us.
---
And you want to talk about Embarrassing? 
---
If you want fun fights and for us to try and tell people to stop joining fleet when if gets to the same size as whatever pitiful numbers you pull, maybe don't attack our sov?
---
If that's what it takes for you to be able to win, keep doing you dude. Just don't smugpost about having zero balls lol.
---
Well considering 75% of the nullsec game is blue (imperium), attacking the other 25% of the game. Eventually the game will be 100% blue, turn into the Chinese server, then die a slow boring death.
---
&gt;expresses concern over quality of invading forces
---
Jesus apply water to burned area
---
I certainly will too once I get a 3D printer, planning on one before the end of the year! Lots of other ship prints too.
---
/r/evetech may be more helpful to you, but you may wait a few days for an answer. 
---
Check the sidebar there, has links to the Eve ESI as well as other developer tools.
---
The ESI site has examples on how to pull data.
---
You may also try and get in contact with the guys who runs the evepraisal and fuzzworks website if you're after market data.
---
The Eve static data may be of interest to you, that's the database that contains info on moons and planets and all that. Which includes their radius and surface gravity and a whole bunch of other statistical data that is public and may be less guarded than market data.
---
It's also in the form of a database.
---
They should have pretended the tournament was going to go on as normal and then have triglavians invade the first set of matches and murder everyone.
---
Probably would have pissed people off but it would have been cool as hell
---
I do what I can.
---
Just another Elo Knight wannabe
---
Unless you are a Goonie multiboxing a fleet of rorqs, I would suggest doing something else as almost anything will yield more isk.
---
This is accurate. The old NC if I deny them fights they will lose strategy
---
Feels weird upvoting you tbh.
---
I don't blame any alliance in Eve for its current state and donuts, not even TAPI. Though it's fun to call them out on their bullshit victim complex.
---
It was 100% predictable Goons would rebuild and be stronger than ever, without injectors and rorquals it would have taken many years more to rebuild though.
---
Instead now the game is in some weird perma arms race where groups feel they need to blue each other and try acquire titans/supers/members quicker than the other guy.
---
Skill doesnt matter in the long run with the current sov system and citadel mechanics
---
You aren’t wrong.
---
It's **NPSI vs NRDS**, it's a clashing of engagement culture as an incentive for conflict/content  
---
Think of HTP and friends as being *tour-guides* with the *infrastructure* for spectre to use, A lot of HTP used to be Spectre FC's and hosted some Spectre based structures.  
---
The group has also been in the past a Capital bat-phone for Provi-region when spectre used to catch capitals (Back in the day).  
---
Is it *such* a stretch to deploy in such a way that you get disappointed joining a public fleet and getting fights? *It's not a new thing for a spectre fleet to 'assist' one side in a fleet engagement when multiple fleets clash anyway, in fact it's business as usual*
---
Some of them have abnormally large foreheads

#Issues with a set number of players being supported in a region
---
1. Gives a hard cap to the number of players that can live in all of nullsec.
---
2. It is nigh-impossible to track how many people live in a region (you *can* look at PvE statistics though)
---
3. Difference in size and geography of regions (some regions have more systems, some are more spread-out, and so on)
---
4. It isn't a nerf to large alliances, but to densely populated regions. This could also negatively influence (for instance) Providence.
---
#Tying this in to Malcanis' law (any change for the "little guy" will benefit large groups even more)
---
Assumptions: 
---
- Krabbing effectiveness is equal to the number of people a region and its surroundings can support divided by the actual number of people living in the region and its surroundings.  
---
(krab efficiency = max_numbers / current_numbers)
---
**Scenario 1**
---
Parties:
---
* Band of Blobbers: 30 characters, living in Querious.
---
* Random small alliances: 4x 2 characters, living in Catch
---
* Random small alliances: 2x 3 characters, living in Delve
---
Querious could support at most 30 characters as we established earlier. However, in Querious and its surroundings we currently have 44 characters, so krabbing in Querious is only ~68% as effective. BOB is not making as much ISK as they'd want.  
---
Because their leadership would rather fight some small alliances than going through the hassle of kicking inactives (like... seriously CCP, this should be easier) they decide to start a campaign of "taking out the trash", burning all infrastructure in Catch with barely any resistance.  
---
Perhaps a few people would still be able to live there, but it'd now be down to not 8, but more like 3 or 4 characters (let's use 4).  
---
While the operations in Catch are underway BOB also deploys its blackops group to Delve, cloaky camping the entirety of the region, making it very hard to live there for the 6 inhabitants, which dwindle to 4 after a few weeks of cloaky camps and hotdrops.
---
After these relatively short campaigns Querious still has 30 characters in it, but Delve and Catch only have 8 characters combined. Krabbing efficiency in Delve has gone up to nearly 79% for BOB. Yay.
---
**Scenario 2**
---
- Band of Blobbers: 50 characters, living in Querious
---
- Others are the same as before.
---
BOB moves from Querious to Catch, which can support up to 60 characters, and uses the same scorched earth tactic that they use in the other scenario. No more problem.
---
#Summarized
---
In nearly all implementations of things to limit large groups smaller groups will inevitably feel many of the effects as well. The system you proposed (as I understood it) would result in large alliances burning everything around them, resulting in empty "buffer regions" where any small group that moved in would get removed from as quickly as possible.

ejected from ship and thought he was fighting twice the number he actualy was, guess thats why he needs to show where he was touched on the doll

&gt;merging legacy and goons into one megacoalition with 2/3 of null's population under one banner that i take issue with.
---
We have the north to thank for that. To a big surprise with the conclusion of the Winter war, its was the North not goons, who tried to farm Legacy and partnering with its enemies for 8 months after settling into Esoteria in April of 2017 which prompted a mutual defense pact and enacted in 2018 when panfam butthurt over provi tried to evict Test via someones else's war. Even now while getting there teeth kicked in by goons they come south, which sorta brings the imperium into the frat war.
---
You're embarrassing. Go back in goons.
---
If you want an easy example, skill urself wouldn’t be quitting the game now if there was an AT, people would just focus on AT for half a year while game is shit.
---
Quit your f1 monkeys corps: whole Imperium/karmafleet, Panfam/Horde, fratthing &amp;  Dreddit/Test. Quit your comfortable shit and join smaller groups! Join  wh, join LS! Grow friends and skills there before gettin out to shit  on the bigs monkeys boots.
---
Other games or even worse (real life etc)
---
I agree with the this 100%. Supers are great, but the mechanics are bullshit. Docking with supers should be revoked.
---
Goons have built fair and square what they have thru region exploitation.   The wealth they generate can be attacked and destroyed.  Your dirty casino could not.  I for one had a lot of fun in the casino war I’m having even more fun now.  So thank you for coming together and kicking us out of the north it was fun.
---
Well said!
---
Which is more lame, his actions or crowing about it on Reddit..
---
Think of them as extensions of your public fleet.
---
Except this map from now?...Not 8 months ago lmao.
---
You didn't actually manage to evict them, you fed at UALX, stayed logged off for most of a week and then scurried back to the north to feed at X47 when you jumped into the final timer late and out of range of most of the Imperium titans. But there was an attempt and a hurf campaign by doomchihuahua to evict Legacy over the embarrassment PL suffered at the hands of Legacy in provi. I'm not the one who said you evicted test btw  that was this guy  [linx259](https://www.reddit.com/user/linx259/) And he is probably referring to how you guys chased them down south after the end of WWB.
---
If you don't like it, fight them. They were crushed before. Folks can't stomach it now though since the casino RMT funds dried up.
---
Whoosh
---
"mom pick me up im not having fun"

sorry are you new to the internet? if you dont want to have other people with dissenting opinions call you out on your bullshit i suggest looking elsewhere for your attaboys.

if you havent figured out the internet yet, well i cant help you.
---
this is about you, really.
---
Goonswarm's great contribution to EVE was that they were the first to truly comprehend the significance of a post-scarcity, post-death setting, which is that ATTENTION AND IMAGE are the only things left that matter.  
---
That as long as a group believes in the group and keeps showing up, as long as there is the perception that you are doing things, you cannot be beaten.  You MIGHT not win but you WILL NOT lose.

This is why they put so much energy into narratives and propaganda and grand sweeping gestures.

That said tho, as I said before, if you want to go back to fun fights and such, don't start sov/structure wars. People don't screw around when you're are trying to spread cancer in their region.

---
yes
---
You aren't giving a dissenting opinion. You're engaging in whataboutism.
---
&gt; Don't see how this could be good for the Eve community to have just one allience who controls everything...

I agree

I'd say the key to the Clone process is the way it flash scans the brain at the moment of death, and then emails that info to the Cloning facility for upload into the new body.
---
If you can block the transmission, then there is no waking back up.
---
Shame you’ve put so much effort and belief in it and then it couldn’t reach anyone because ccp fucked up. You were probably the last person believing in player run tournaments. At least what happened helped people to open their eyes and move on.
---
"zero balls"?
---
You told your fleet to run. You got caught. You ejected and ran in your pod. Got caught again and died. Didn't undock again.
---
Made up some crap about an awoxer to make you sound less shit on reddit.
---
Real Ballsy.
---
different regions maybe ? ive switched to usd/gpb to check the conversion rate and its kind of the same. also 1 acc locked.
---
Its not even back stabbing. I remember them from when I played the game in 2011 I was away from the game for more than 7 years and I still remember despising NC PL just because of how big of a bunch of douche bags they were when they were on top of the titan/super game. They can talk about how boring it is to shoot structures and how much they don't care until hell freezes over I'll still fleet up to shoot their shit.
---
Yea, i sometimes forget, that not everyone is an immortal capsuleer
---
Make him ragequit.
---
I'm really starting to love not joining these npsi campaign fleets.
---
Negative points?  I guess NC/PL have found another button to click on instead of the undock.....
---
Nice argument, but every alliance in this game is a cash cow. This is not a money issue, it's a people one.
---
&gt;  I'm not going to fight you if you're just going to waste my time.
---
But you'll give them a free monitor?
---
Who tackled me then?
---
&gt; But yea it's gone until 2020. 
---
I admire your hope and cant wait to see it crushed, friend.
---
This is just vague remembering and I would be totally wrong. I think empress Jamal (sp?) Was looking into that technology. Finding a way to block the transfer of consciousness. I also get the feeling that the technology was said in the book eve online the burning life. 
---
Again take that all with a grain of salt because I could just be having a Mandela Effect.
---
One of the easiest fixes for cap proliferation is to make caps not be the counter to everything else. Back in 2012 the counter to a dread could be 2 curses and a few high DPS hacs. Now that same comp would just eat shit to a single dread. All capitals can apply damage way to easily to sub-caps. Sub-caps need a role in our empire wars again.

---
They are too scared because they are a bunch of Care bears who are afraid to have to replace their ships. The funds ran dry last time which is why they stopped
---
No, not each system expensive, holding more systems increases expenses.  So each additional system costs more than some amount.
---
TAKE MY UPVENTURE!!!
---
Thanks
---
&gt; not necessarily with the absence of the AT itself but with how people interpret it. There are already a large portion of players who feel like the game is moving away from them, and for a bunch of them they feel like this is just more proof that it's time to move on
---
Yeah. AT was the pinnacle, the aspiration, for small gang PVP, and even if you weren't good enough to actually be in or around a team, it was still a good thing for that style of play. It's like the Cricket World Cup getting people interested in the game and being good for club cricket. And it all adds up with the other changes in the last few years that all lead away from engaging small gang PVP on TQ.

Nobody on our side said anything about tackling you within your own fleet, so probably either it wasn't someone in your fleet or it wasn't provi that awoxed you.
---
Translation: “Waaaaaaa waaaaaaaaa stop using the same tactics we use it is not fair waaaa waaaaa” HTFU sweetcheeks, or maybe you should just go back and crab in goons?
---
&gt; I'm not a fucking idiot
---
I disagree.
---
As I'm not that good in format a text on reddit I will just write everything down as an epic wall of text  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ .
---
You could track down the living pilots via owned sov structures and the access lists of those alliances.
---
Every region should have different numbers they could support: Smaller region less players to support seems logical.
---
It will still nerf large alliances as they atleast need 1 puffer region to get maximum efficiency when they are to big for 1 region.
---
I will skip both scenarios and jump right to the summary.
---
It's true that you can't help way to small groups against way to big groups, but this system will break up the current playstyle of "the more the better" which will help smaller groups get bigger as the people who have to leave the current coalitions/alliances due to overpopulation still need a new home. Which is indirectly helping the small groups.
---
To directly help small groups against bigger ones you could need to directly buff them what I think is a bad idea becasue at some point a game will develope powercreep.
---
Was the specter fc minmatar? Sounds like police brutality to shoot an unarmed pod
---
He was supposed to destroy the blue donut, not join it!
---
Hahaha, when i want to visit , you are running away from SH1... NC. This is lame, you are lame :(
---
Just caught up on a bunch of your videos.  This one and the condor vid were both great =).  Keep um coming man!
---
That's easy, yes.  But that's not what I'm talking about is it.
---
Join Bjorn's fleets when he has them. He stays in the fight no matter what the hell happens and he's in it to win it (even if he dies). Of course we always have the big issue of burst jammers on fucking ceptors still being a thing (ccp wtf) and that generally puts a damper on things when it happens.
---

Yes, I meant Empress Jamyl I. Thank you for correcting it.

---
I do the work so another TZ gets the fun? I don't think so!
---
When CCP starts messing around with timers in game we seen where that ends I.e. Injection of skill points , TZ tanking with structures , even now to the Black Death screen of undocking.
---
Can we please just take time off CCP hands and give them another ball to play with regarding changes!
---
&gt; and DDOS me
---
lmao
---
Bait always needs to look enticing.
---
Please record your attempt.
---
Biggest part of industry is finding something to build. Lots of factors to take into consideration
---
This idea would give a whole new meaning to staying alive.
---
(Ha ha ha ha Staying Alive
---
Staying Alive)
---
This actually sounds like the kind of approach that could potentially solve timezone tanking in other areas of EVE.  CCP could experiment with the relatively low impact FW iHub mechanics, and then transplant the idea to other contexts if successful.
---
Its not about wanting to form a blue donut its about growing and self preservation. All NCPL wants is content and easy content at that. Can't grow or survive living near and entity like that. The Legacy/Imperium relationship is a mutually beneficial one, TEST gets to grow without fear of Panfam tryin to destroy them and Imperium gets to rest easy knowing everyone now hates TEST for allying with them thus ensuring there wont be another World War Bee.
---
If someone joins your site the rats start switching to drones and they stay like that until the site is cleared.
---
Fuck this website. I've tried logging in numerous times, reset my pword, answer that captch 30 times, reset all my cookies, everything. Their website is the fucking worst.
---
Every fight not taken is a a fight not lost right? i bet everyone in NCdock has positive k/d while their space gets taken. gg next map
---
How do you see killmarks on your ships?
---
&gt; This is not a product of game mechanics.
---
Except when you make it possible to sustain hundreds of people in 1 small region, then the game mechanics are actually stimulating bulking together. Saying that game mechanics can't stimulate certain playstyles and suppress other playstyles is the smoothest of smoothbrain takes.
---
The true cancer of eve is all the people who would rather cry on reddit or the forums instead of logging in and doing something about it.
---
The blueballs are a nice touch.
---
Yeah? Nobody does since I do them solo.
---

You can read about this guy's past here. He's dumb as rocks and doesn't appear to have learned anything.
---
You're thinking about this entirely the wrong way. This is not like other MMOs where you "level up" and there is are specific "end game" setups. EVE is designed much more around specialization. If you are brand new, the first thing you should do is identify a specific thing (maybe a rig, maybe a module. DON'T DO A T1 SHIP) to start building and make sure you can do so profitably before you get started. Vertical integration is a long term goal at best. You will ruin yourself if you attempt that from the start. As you progress, you'll expand your market coverage or switch to new opportunities. It's a sandbox, so define your goals and go for it!
---
PS: It's spelled "career", but your typo is hilarious
---
&gt; Well... I don't actually know all about Eve "history" but 
---
Well don't let that stop you from broadcasting your unlettered opinion. This ***is*** reddit, after all.
---
Yeah but if you're trying to find 10 hours a month of new chores, you could have a really clean apartment or a nice vegetable garden or get back in touch with your parents. If you can't afford $15/mo it's not awful to spend 20 minutes a day working for the game (if you "play for real" for another 100 minutes); but I'd still advocate innovative isk-acquisition like theft/trading/looting after cap brawls.
---
It's not all that hard to kill a capsuleer.  You just need to get him away from the capsule.
---
Capsuleer immortality is tied to the capsule.  When a capsuleer is in his pod and the pod is destroyed, the capsule technology copies the capsuleer's information just prior to destruction.  This information is used during process to place the capsuleer in a clone body.
---
However, if the capsuleer is outside of his or her capsule, they die just like anyone else.  In the Eve chronicle "Ruthless" the capsuleer Gavriel died due to injuries that occurred in close-in combat during a station siege.  This death was permanent.  
---
Another possibility, although not canonical, is that a capsuleer can be prevented from transferring to a clone body by damage sustained during the consciousness storage process.  This happened to the capsuleer Nabobeh in "Intercession" leaving him with his mind intact inside a badly damaged body.
---
BoB did nothing wrong.
---
The only thing more embarassing than the constant smug of killing undefended structures is the dogshit propaganda and hurfposting coming out of the CFC.
---
I love the idea of disco ball but could it also bounce the ships off said disco ball instead of catching them! Spraying ships off in all different directions with different rays of light behind them!
---
Barge 4, all other skills 5, Strip Miner I: 124.2 Cycle Time.  
---
This is 180 * 0.75 * 0.92 = 124.2 
---
45% System Bonus:
---
124.2 * 0.55 = 68.3 (so your bonus is actually larger than 45%)
---
Were you orca boosting too?
---
The point is that panfam directly shit on every small coalition that tried to build up. The reason there are 2 giant megacoalitions is because of panfam.
---
Heck, I won EVE years ago. But that was during the time that Spectre was actually full-time NPSI and only visited Provi equally with other target rich places. I even ended my career while in HTP. I got no beef, only nostalgia.
---
&gt;5 mid sized ones
---
It's what you have, but some alliance ally together because they hated for different reason the other side, for example, a lot of people love to joke about Imperium beeing friend with Legacy with their background, but if TEST moved south it's because panfam evicted them and if they end up blue to each other it's because panfam gave them a common goal : hating NCPL. You can find the exact same reason for the other side, if FRT is friend with panfam it's because they both hated TEST. 
---
You can't do anything if player fight along side the side of the map with the narrative they like, south is all about "grr NCPL they always been dick" and north is all about "grr GSF they always been dick". Thing is one side love to farm smaller alliance for content
---
I prefer by far an even fight between 2 mega coalition, than 1 coalition dominating the other one because they lost their "ally" one by one
---
Imagine being a public fleet "neutral entity" that declares war then gets upset about AWOXing.
---
That kid put up ten times the fight you have so far.
---
omnipotency is one hell of a drug, you should try it
---
I just remember panfam leaving GOTG and Co2 dealing with goons almost all alone during all 6RCQ campaign and then soon as goons were home doing a campaign to farm what was left of GOTG. 
---
But hey, I must need to get it right
---
tbh, it's sad in some way..
---
Maybe it was, but then you posted this.
---
Because A was weak and B alliance would farm A thus ensuring fc's and supers would get tired of losing and join the strong.
---
But now A alliances blue each other to survive in the face of slaughter from elite B alliances but its somehow A's fault........
---
You're right, it does. I hope they'll implement it.
---
&gt;nobody in ncpl gives the slightest shit about what you move
---
What was that list of citadel unanchored again ? Or even the salt in those post ? Huuuuum
---
Goonswarm is just one thing; a large group of inadequate spodbrains who can only win by shady meta-gaming and n+1 nature of sandbox pvp. It's a miracle that it still took them 16 years to dominate Null space, when you consider that they accept any fool as long as they do what is told to them. Every new teenager player as soon as they learn about alliances and corps, wants to join the biggest and strongest one there is. This is what happens when a game has no RULES to govern. Obviously greedy nature of humans will take over sooner or later and ruin it.
---
meh, i'm part of that group that don't live in that space anymore because there is no hope anymore

Another timezone would be unable to "steal" the entire event, so it really cuts both ways.  Even if there's five timers or so, you're likely to find 2-3 of them doable on a weekend.  Maybe all five.  
---
Remember that any mechanic that allows alts to set up timers to their choosing will enable a form of timezone tanking.  We also don't want US tz to get fifty straight events and take a victory lap while EU FW players get nothing.  FW is come-one, come-all, so it makes even more sense for FW to distribute events this way.
---
seems like  its working as intended based on this post
---
When I was doing hubs in my VNI I found that killing the frigates in the initial spawn with light drones then switching to heavies really kept the rats from aggroing my drones. Nothing else really worked for me. Auto Targeting System is also bullshit urban legend, it does absolutely nothing for keeping aggro.
---
Haven't you nerds not been doing that as long as your alliance exists? You literally have a bunch of hotdrop neuts/alts in provi lowsec just to drop on targets. Or is it only unfair when your enemy does that?
---
So true xD
---
I see. that's one thing that I haven't tried yet, I'll do this now and let you know the results.
---
NC supercap fleet was never deployed to the Provi campaign, they were instead left in Tribute.
---
Believe it or not, there are a lot of autonomous AI in the Dronelands, some more intelligent than others.
---
100 holding alliances means 34 alpha accounts (you can just transfer the holding corp to another character, so you only need one char to create the alliance to begin with). 100 * 2m/month = 200m/month, that's not that bad for holding a LOT of sov. It makes holding large empires more tedious, but it wouldn't disincentivize holding more space.
---
dont stop playinf this game elise &lt;3
---
Jita's node would crash in 2 seconds flat
---
Every post on reddit I see that says how hospitable Goons is for new players or players that want to "farm", is very positive for them from a recruitment perspective.
---
SkillU basically created a bot paradise out in the dronelands.  It will be interesting to see what happens when they leave.
---
plz do dis ccplease
---
I agree to this.  I can still remember when I found out HAW guns were a thing (I was in Provi and CVA dropped some dreads - I assumed they couldn't hit subs).
---
For someone who exclusively deals in corp content provision, it means I need to take into account what groups I can pick a fight with where the odds are not unwinnable.
---
Same thing in delve, period basis,esoteria,fountain,tenal,omyst,etc. Ccp should just do hardware, ip and key bans when they ban if they dont already.
---
Sure that would be better. 
---
In the sense that shoving your arm into a red ant hill would be better than shoving it into a wood chipper.

It just seems like there is less sand around the place being replaced with more and more limits.
---

---
I mean how else will I know if I'm alone in a system or not?
---
Do market research, ???, profit.
---
yea most of thats right. i still dont understand why you gave me the sperg response you did, but i guess war gets you fired up.
---
It's not a silver bullet. It's another tool to use in an arsenal. Right now you just jump a huge group of capitals in to a single point and start trading blows with the opposing force. You need a critical mass of ships to break reps or alpha ships, which is done one at a time. I think adding another type of ship that can provide a fair amount of Dmg to a group as opposed to a single target will force groups in to rethinking how they approach fights from an attacking and defending standpoint. FoF missiles could also see some actual use as part of a defensive strategy as well. 
---
It just seems we need something to force Eve's combat out of this "Whoever brings the most supercaps wins" approach and in to a more strategic one.
---
By the same logic, AT ships should be nerfed to the ground. Their only balancing factor is scarcity, same as supercaps(and to a lesser extent, caps) before injectors, citadels and rorqs.
---
Keep in mind the penalties...
---
Neh those guys get ducktaped and thrown in a rusty cage.
---
what is this?
---
Goons have always been, well goons. But the current situation isn't goons fault, it's mechanics.
---
 No entity should be able to do what we've seen in delve, goons are bad/evil because they saw it and capitalized. I also don't think anyone should have to show restraint in pursuing their goals
---
 CCP needs to find a working fix and implementing it fast.

Why not deploy your alliance to drone lands and kill all the bots?
---
Not interested in pve
---
Uh. Every fighting swing? That's not the WWB I remember.
---
Cores scan better for explo, and fit easier--so you can turn those low slots to better escape (stabs, nanos, inertials)
---
Dscan will tell you everything expandeds will with the exception of dscan recon presence. But those are so rare it's really not worth it. And having extra lows dedicated to escape will improve your survival by much more even in the case of a Curse landing on grid with you.

The reason I decided to sub to eve back in 2012 was because of AT videos and how excited people were, so decided to give it a proper try.

there is nothing wrong with the post we are a good group of people trying to bring some fun to others in EvE Online. If things like that disturb you were not writing an essay here, thus maybe you should take a break head outside.
---
please do not troll peoples reddit Thanks..
---
Because continuing to bash the structures of people that don't want to fight for months is absolutely not the reason.
---
Every major alliance has unlimited SRP fund by now.
---
There is no such thing as a "FW Discord" and the ones claiming there is or logging into whatever it is they have are not FW people and part of the problem we have not only in FW but this games "community" If you are on this discord and care about FW and this game, leave it now or forever live in shame.

Don't red pill him, pls.

:thumbsup:

Is the target piloting a VNI?
---
If yes: bot
---
If no: probably a bot
---
^^^^^/s
---
it worked for me for 2 different accounts. its also working via vpn. What seems to be the problem? you are clearly triggering something onto their side. no need to vpn, the difference is not worth it.
---
well at least any year after 2005-ish

" with every fighting swing they can give "

Hahahahahahahahahaha - sword fleets

Its name is World War Bee... stop trying to change history.

&gt;There is nothing wrong with the post. We are a good group of people trying to bring some fun to others in EvE Online. If things like that disturb you, understand that we're not writing an essay here; thus maybe you should take a break and head outside.
---
&gt; Please do not troll people's reddit posts. Thanks.
---
FTFY (But I disagree with some of what you said, like when you said there was nothing wrong with the post. There was plenty wrong with the post, namely the lack of punctuation making it a chore to read.)
---
Game heavily favours huge pve oriented groups, one particular pve group found the way to play the game as it is supposed by CCP.
---
Shocking, right? Surely no other group could do the same. /s
---
just remove the extractors from the game - that would cure another pest, cloaky campers
---
No one posts here much besides Goons and their Tapi pets... So you are sorta right.
---
Such as...?
---
I think you mean 'Gotg docked up while Horde took fights'
---
One horrible fucking website however they keep spamming you would emails even if you unsubscribe had to GDPR their asses to get rid of the spam.
---
I agree with you on the powercreep and all that, the thing is that a lot of possible solutions would probably end with unexpected and unintended effects. Finding a good solution is extremely hard, so I'm not jealous of the devs who need to figure something out quickly, because I love the idea of the game, I just don't like playing it right now.
---
AT ships can't be made, Titans and Supers can be made. Not quite the same.
---
Only if your anal retentive, please stop trolling my reddit very childish of you find something else to do thank you..
---
the jita 4-4 chronicle talks about the possibility of a capsuleer suicide bomber "laughing its way back to the cloning bay" and how security personnel are authorized to kill trespassing capsuleers on sight, because they are immortal anyway.
---
the reality of the matter is somewhere in the middle, a capsuleer will die outside the capsule but a backup clone can be animated to replace them.
---
wtf are you even talking about? A lot of the people on the discord NanDe linked I can verify are FW pilots in 30 seconds on zkill.
---
And the balance pass they did on carriers, rorquals, and faxes.
---
And the 64 bit client
---
Why should CCP give the community nice things if people like to you keep ignoring them so they can continue to screech about how the greedy and lazy developers keep ruining the game?
---
No wonder CCP is focusing on new player acquisition. the old guard are a lost cause with an un-killable persecution complex and an endless series of fractal grievances.
---
Fuck it, have an upvote
---
Provi properly defending their space! "I'm so proud of this community"
---
I think Zendane have probably the best guess here, since he references to chronicles.
---
But it is strange to me if capsuleer could be killed permanent if outside of capsule. First, since capsuleer "immortality" implemented via creating of a new body identical (physically and mentally) to one that have been destroyed - I think capsuleer could only lost a bit of memory that way. Probably he would fall back to memories he had after the last time he was killed (last time capsule has taken his brain image).
---
But if we take for a constant that antagonist is truly immortal - then I believe it's a classical problem. You could not harm him physically so instead you search for mental approach - you somehow make him want to die so he "disables" his immortality OR you somehow drive him insane so his former self ceases to exist.
---
I believe each game patch have a slight chance to do both things to him. So you could just wait.
---
drone lands has always been bots though
---
&gt; But yea it's gone until 2020.
---
*laugh-track*
---
You can't farm up at ships
---
Removing supers and titans is tricky, as maligned as they are it will not disincentivize the big blocs. They can still field many fleets at once. What you are arguing would impact alliances like Snuff, NCDOT, skill urself (RIP), and others like them much more than TAPI or GSF
---
I hope no t2 BPOs will be left behind accidentally
---
Would you be willing to watch me attempt to do a site? I can stream it.

A whole lot of inties, and some hurricanes.

somebody help me

nobody's fault they're not defended, someone should defend them tbh

You can run armor incursions as an alpha for 250mil/hr on a good day
---
I lived in the drone lands before WWB.  I was not a bot.  But I saw a few out there.
---
I could later but not now i'm preparing for an op.
---
Alright. My character name in-game is NullBy7e.
---
Well at least we know where NC were deploying to from SH1, this thread. gj bois
---
&gt; 200*3*-ish
---
FTFY
---
I'm not trolling buddy, just saying that you should use some punctuation to make your posts more readable.
---
Idk.  Presently we have plexes &amp; ihubs.  I'd call that a fine layer of dust more than a deep sand box.  I'm pushing for stuff that will let us heavily buff FW rewards overall and shift a lot of reward from missions &amp; low-effort plexing into the combat activities.  Doing that without creating a highly churnable TZ manipulation target is another thing that pushed me here.
---
We've all fucked up an align. You don't have to be so embarrassed about missing the warp dude.
---
The thing is i want to build a cap in a wormhole
---
Alright thanks.
---
Woosh
---
Some of us didn't stop until PL/PH/NC. stabbed us in the back.
---
&gt;This is not doing what goons are doing. At least they lost during the Casino War with every fighting swing they can give
---
hahahahahaha that's a good one.
---
far favors the defender, thats why NCPL abandoned their regions it all makes sense.
---
all of your posts you contradict everyone and argue with them will you agree again for the third time please stop trolling my reddit or i will have to report you, speaking your opinion is one thing trolling is another you have no opinion just self delusions of what people are suppose to do to make you feel better about what you read.  
---
were not here for you were here for the EVE community now again please stop trolling this reddit post its not here for that, thank you
---
zoom in, rotate around until you see some tiny shining faction symbol thing

that's where killmarks always appear for that specific ship

Proud to Live in Eve Europe, Providence, where we punish only the know bad hombres, not everyone.

&gt; At least they lost during the  Casino War with every fighting swing they can give.
---
Do you know how I know you’re retarded?
---
Rats are running, sorry you can't do pvp panfam. Leet retards.
---
With the exception of the 64 bit client not one of those changes has had any appreciable impact on the game. It's still the same boring krabfest it's been for years now.
---
All the wolf had to do was activate adc and heat guns...
---
Lol what? I argue with everyone? I am not trolling you buddy, the fact that you are taking this so personally and assuming I'm trolling you when I just told you that you could use some punctuation in your posts is hilarious. Feel free to report me lmao
---
Roamed BOTlands with 2x Nomen, Retri, Keres, Male.
---
BOT brings Nyx, Nianzu, Bhalg, Mach, Osprey to a gate that we had a Hurricane tackled at. Proceeded to trash talk us for leaving.
---
Glad to see this game is so healthy!
---
Two bits of advice, although probably not precisely what you're looking for:
---
&gt; I'm kind of a newbie so as of now I'm prioritizing PvE. 
---
This is generally a terrible idea. PVE does not help you learn to PVP, so prioritizing PVE now will only make it harder for you to mentally start doing PVP later. Plan to do both now. Exploration is great--but you should also think about what PVP you can do with the isk you have so that you don't get yourself stuck in a rut. (If you don't like PVP, I'm not going to shame you for it, but it sounds like you feel you're not ready. And if that's the case you should just go do it.)
---
&gt; Astero for exploration 
---
There's a variety of fittings for this. Some Astero fits are designed to be able to fight off other hackers. I wouldn't advise this for you, but it's an option. A pacifist Astero wants &lt;2 seconds align time. You should be able to fit a damage control on top of your align mods, and use your mids for scanning and hacking stuff.
---
"Lol"
---
It’s not human nature, it’s shitty game design
---
It's not an entirely irrational decision by the new company either.  The players like it, but AT -is- a big money and resource sink that doesn't really increase subs, or logins, or provide anything else tangible to show for it.
---
Yes please!
---
Casinos WERE fair until they were banned by CCP (long after WWB), get that straight. Lol dirty casino, I never kicked you out the north, no one really cares about that.
---
How to fight with no cap, "bring a faction cruiser that doesn't need cap."
---
Cargo expanders... during a firesale.
---
so if the non-goons/tapi folk aren't on here shit posting,and they aren't in game playing it... where the fuck are they and what are they doing?
---
So, basically region-appropriate RP then?
---
The AT was only good because of the gambling part of it. Without the betting it's just a boring wannabe elitist little club of try hards.
---
I hate these fucking worthless "be me" posts.
---
Ever wonder you're just a bad hunter?
---
And the E3  code is? Or did you have to be there and get one?
---
&gt;CFC
---
The what?
---
\*terms and conditions apply 
---
Defenders need to show up to actually defend
---
While not explicitly said anywhere it seems reasonable to suppose that being podded and recloned repeatedly would have some stress associated with it. I have always used that as my  personal headcannon to explain my characters take on warfare amongst capsuleers. Ultimately the only real metric is how much of their wealth you can take and the amount of times you can pod them with the long term goal of wetgraving them when the stress gets to be too much.
---
No, its Casino War, stop trying to be edgy.
---
Yes thats true the players will allways find a way to exploit things or use it different then how the devs intention were. But you as a dev should see that the current mechanics aren't working and you can't take a few years for a solution.
---
I agree, high sec space can be boring.  I don't see much PVP, many good wormholes or many rare ores to mine.
---
Hey, thanks for this. Abyssal stuff is just a mystery to me.
---
The real people involved in FW are in local and in a Plex or Ihub. These people are not those people and the real FW community knows that. Its like PIE and CVA still pretending to be Amarrians... they are not. What these people turned EVE into their only social outlet and through that have distorted the ingame politics neutering lowsec content. These people want a name and they want to stream and they want to be on CSM but they dont want to play Faction Warfare. Only those that do play Faction Warfare know this but we dont go on lame discords or beg for subscribers, votes or post much here on reddit claiming to be FW leaders and the outsiders dont know the difference.
---
"Eve is doing alright"
---
"It is specifically the year 2014"
---
atleast we cure the game of cancer :)
---
it's in the name ayyyy
---
Rorqual_alt btw!
---
What is edgy? right out of the plebs handbook... It is and always will be World War Bee. Sorry your leader does not like the name of the war. Get over it.
---
\&gt;Adds a space after &gt;
---
\&gt;Lol wannabe reddit trash
---
I make everything from ammo to supers on any given day. You make what's profitable, not what's bigger
---
So true
---
As it has always been.
---
I especially liked Init feeding T3s
---
You are right. I've never done PVP cuz I'm shit and when I see something red on my screen that isn't from my alliance I just puma pants.
---
Do we really need anything?
---
Pussies can't blob newb small alliances anymore:
---
 nc. pl -game no fun, gief free ISK  for gain titans or no play.
---
are you sure this is hisec?
---
if i don't need pointless VNI kills, i'm not going to do it. i can't do anything with a VNI kill, it doesn't have any uses.
---
HIFIVE
---
I thought that was the entire point of wearing sunglasses in space.
---
First steps are to get some familiarity with how the game is played so that you know what people need and use, and to get some tools that can process various market data so that you know what can be built for a profit.
---
The right tools can help with the first part. Eveiskperhour is pretty good if you can figure out how to use it.
---
Code: E3
---
I cant remember a time when eve wasn't dying. Literally since I started in 2011. Every update. "Omfg, eve is dying cause X"
---
Are you sure you want to build caps in a wormhole that can't support moving them in? They draw a lot of attention from people who like kicking over the sandcastles of people too big for their britches.
---
The VNI kills are irrelevant. The tears generated from their kills are priceless.
---
Of course you being a nubee, I don't expect you to know anything about that, but you can maybe unfuckulate yourself and try.
---
As someone who was there, I can confirm that the awox happened. The awoxer ([a blank KB perma-npc corp character](https://zkillboard.com/character/2113331320/)) was smugging about it in fleet chat afterward, claiming to be a /u/R4d1o4ct1v3_ alt.

﻿&gt; [ 2019.06.15 17:14:51 ] Senord Knag-Eye &gt; Why would I win fights when I can meme you like this xD
---
However, I don't blame provi for it at all - this *is* a war. If it were a 'normal' NPSI fleet I'd shake my head a bit at provi forming more BS than we had HACs and then awoxing on top of it, saying that all they did was screw themselves out of a fight, but this isn't a normal NPSI situation. This is eve - if you declare war on someone, you have to expect things like this, there's no requirement to 'fight fair' in a war. Honestly I'm more disappointed in the spectre side for apparently forgetting that and getting so salty over it afterward. You don't get to have your cake and eat it too - if you want to have a war, you can't still expect the other side to hold back. If you're not prepared to deal with that, then maybe you shouldn't declare war?
---
No but they happened to be the null blob first adapted fozzie sov, citadels, rorquals and capital umbrella
---
The rest is snowballing
---
&gt;right out of the plebs handbook
---
Just like the name World War Bee.
---
Was a super fun fight. unfortunately my scimitar got tackled when we (Provi) were trying to ninja alpha machs/rattlesnakes in our munnins and then warp off.
---
All of the fleet got out except me :( (most of them died later on anyway)
---
Good fight. Hope we can have more fight like this but with less hordelings preferably ;)
---
Well you certainly know how to hurt me in the feels.
---
GF by the way
---
Was fun
---
Anyone bothering explain to me why mass T3C logi instead of good ol' basi?
---
Best group of online spaceships friends I'll ever have.
---
I sub my accounts with RL money and krab for isk to buy ships to blow up.  It doesn't really seem that tedious to me, I get to work for what I fly but I don't feel pressured to get things at a certain rate
---
Angel sound involves infecting someone with a virus that follows the clone forever as I recall
---
It was low sec idiot.
---
2016 onwards the "eve is dying" meme became true  tbh
---
Well, the only difference is that Serenity is basically dead, and TQ is approaching the ultimate blueball Serenity managed to achieve before mass afk
---
Asset Safety \o/
---
at least you didn't go to delve.
---
It's the plan for KM v2, announced almost a year ago. However, different priorities tm got in the way and elder has stalled. KM v2 is, genuinely, a gold mine.
---
gf, but I really don't envy those huge blocks who only have battles like this one.  
---
That tidi was already too much for me - am going back to small scale/solo now :D
---
Not really, I quit in 2014, and all the groups I flew with haven't been around for a while, besides The Initiative, ironically. 
---
You're just stupid lmao
---
sadly yea.  doesn't have to be that way, but that is the most likely outcome.
---
The dream is over. 
---
Cheers to capqu/barra and everyone else who made the alliance what it is, I loved being part of it.
---
Or maybe don't bitch when you get into someones territory and they defend properly.
---
Stunning and brave.
---
Data viz on billboards started with bounties: highest bounty char, etc. It has markedly deteriorated in usefulness since then, but that doesn't detract from your proposal.
---
Track record says otherwise.
---
/shrug
---
NC DDing their blues, classic =)
---
all bangers, every one of you
---
It's good to end on a high note. Skill Urself (and the iterations before it) was the best place to be in EVE. Glad I could be a part of it, thanks for everything.
---
Been the most fun in eve I have ever had. I love you friends
---
Nahh, no one really chased into Delve.
---
rip gf's o7
---
Best fun ive had not just in EVE but in any games. So glad i got to be a part of it
---
No thats just the name of the war, World War Bee. Sorry your leader did not like the name, get over it.
---
I assume implants are displayed on pod kills by now? They announced that like 5-10 years ago...
---
Let me put it this way... I have no idea what any of these other events are. The AT was incredibly entertaining and made me want to play EVE, to the point where when I had some free time I was considering it. Just sad that... yknow, EVE would not value that type of event with a historical precedent. The casters talking about the history and the unique ships always got me so excited.
---
what a group, some of the best fun I've had in EVE for ages. thanks boys.
---
&gt; The tears generated from their kills are priceless
---
they're nothing and boring compared to what you could harvest before this game got dumbed down in the name of "new player retention" which managed to retain fuck all new players.
---
That was goons said
---
B..but Brisc came on the meta show after the fleet smugging about killing Horde.
---
I actually laughed out loud at this, and am getting death glares from the wife.
---
Lower resists or less damage dealed, same as normal Incursions as far as i know till now
---
Oh it's you! I loved your casting so much, I truly hope you keep doing something like this!
---
I can't tell if you're serious or joking. Get yourself a dirt-cheap brawling frigate fit and go lose them. Attack \*everything\* at least once. See Huginn? Fuckit. Go for that scram. Nyx? You can't even tackle that shit, but who cares. Your ship+fit costs maybe 3m isk tops. You can pay that isk for the experience of getting alpha'd by heavy fighters.
---
Woohoo, nothing like nice Ganked roam! The ones that used to provide big fights.
---
Shame Spectre is going to shit, but I guess that's evolution when people who shouldn't get in control of it.
---
I dunno. I fancy us as more of Reynholm (foather or son) from the IT crowd.
---
was a great reform, hopefully we have an excuse to do another before TQ shuts down
---
Was his name Redline per chance? Lol
---
best alliance 
---
best friends 
---
best christians
---
see you guys if the game doesn’t suck someday
---
Thank you friends, for everything. 
---
Positivity week is enabled.
---
Agreed!
---
Best bunch of toxic pieces of shit I’ve ever met.
---
Sorry you don't accept the way the war was entirely funded, get over it. Casino War.
---
oh fucking seven boys  
---
was some of the best fun in eve while it lasted  
---
:(  
---
god speed
---
Best alliance i've had the privilege to play with. o7 friends.
---
Pretty sure?
---
o7 and MORE VIDEOS PLEEEEEEEEEEASE
---
Yes they are, and their market value. This makes offering implant reclamation services feasible. Zkb uses marketer (iirc) so prices can inflate.
---
Cheers for the best time I've ever had playing vidya, you guys made it amazing.
---
Some of the best fun in eve I ever had. Wish I had joined sooner…
---
LOL goons do same in 2016
---
That's not very specific to 2019 either
---
How do i get started with running incursions? I'm specifically wondering how do I find groups to run incursions with?
---
bunch of virgins imo
---
Good night, space friend.
---
*UPVULTURE
---
He's not wrong tho. NC and PL were still just the original founding corps at this point and neither had any sov or any rep really. Wasn't until the NC-DRF war that they made a name for themselves, and even then, it wasn't really until N3 that they became a major power.
---
It was fun! Thanks for playing!
---
I feel this is the correct interpretation given how the war was actually paid for.
---
We will know when eve is actually dying cuz instead of saying “eve is dying” all these people will have left the game and Reddit.
---
Burn the north but dont spin it, during wwb ceptor prices were like 120m from the constant use from the imperium
---
Any time after July 30th, 2003

---
How a war is funded does not dictate a name. Why do you think it does? World War Bee was a good time and all involved should be proud of it. No need to change the name if you were on the losing side. stop
---
Oh you sweet summerchild. You think pre-2016 the capturing of new players was better? They F2P WAS the entire hook. Well and a better player intro. A better agency. A better UI. Better graphics. All the things CCP could control were improved. Game balance is a very touchy subject for several good reasons. 
---
The one explicit wrong turn that CCP made was to make it easier to make ISK in nullsec and thus everybody ending up with rorquals and thus skill injectors and thus titans. That is what moved the game towards the current end state 5 years ahead of schedule.
---
I have no problem with this.
---
Leaving before the actual eviction took place doesn't change the fact that there was no stopping their losing the Vale. So it left NC/PL to burn through sov and structures, similar to what is happening again in the Vale.
---
god bless never thought id get so emotional about a dumb spaceship game but thx mario for the video and barra/capqu/keb and all the other ppl that made it special
---
Zkill whore post with no aar and can't even get the difference between hi and lowsec.  Thanks.
---
I upvoted anyway because fuck init lol
---
CVA should have asked for Amarrian support and not goons and they would have won. Sad what has become of CVA... very sad.
---
CCP have specifically killed all Thunderdome tournament tool support at this point. It's all dead, Jim.
---
Most fun, enjoyable and chill alliance. Thanks for everything! o7
---
It was WWB.
---
Time to feeeeed boys.
---
If you're in highsec don't even bother. There's zero profit due to carebears selling below cost with the mindset "the minerals I mine are free".
---
You are mixing up your years buddy. Frat wasn't even around the time this guy is referring to.
---
Thanks for the great time &lt;3
---
Lets see, Bob did that, CFC did that a few years ago, and you also had the time when CFC and NCPL were bluetral and together controlled the entire map. Not too much is different now

Thanks for the great advice! f

---
Omist, Period Basis, Feythabolis...
---
If I remember correctly there is a mission where the npc talk about having located and destroyed all of a target’s clones and that you the player go out and finally kill him.
---
How about a Titan alt named Spodu Main?
---
i remember us throwing a lot of hurricanes and interceptors into the grinder in saranen. didnt do much to alter the outcome of the war, but it was a fun time none the less.
---
Cheers mate :) And will do.
---
The only difference is that years ago one Titan would make a difference, but now one side is thousands Doomsdays overpowering the other side
---
I would use it for farming isk in a C5.  I would prefer just moving a cap into a wh instead of building one since then i need to put down an azbel.
---
 I play eve on my own and having structures isnt the best thing if you are alone.
---
Is there any way to move a cap into a c5 from null/low sec?
---
Did you report them?
---
Just for measure I took a look at the view numbers for the AT finals over on youtube and was a bit disappointed TBH. the videos from last year are only in the 20-30k view range. I know that it's a live stream event and many people watch it live but I honestly expected that the vids on youtube would have several 100k views but they do not.
---
My thinking about the views per video was if they were getting serious views on those videos from youtube they could be making several thousand per video via google but sadly that's not even the case. Perhaps AT wasn't bringing in new customers as the exposure seems very limited outside of the eve player base.
---
"As they slipped into what I can only imagine is their normal character; the amount of racist, misogynistic and  homophobic stuff, I mean these are literally some of the worst sounding human beings I have EVER run into in this game."

If you are in null your alliance is harboring bots. Fuck off salty bitch.

Yes!
---
So you are accuising Provi of using DDOS (please provide evidence) AND you are saying you are more then happy to return the service? Thin ice young man, thin ice.
---
Also stop posting you fucking retard. You managed to get bullied out of goons who have close to zero standards. I have not seen a single person who got bullied out to succeed in anything beyond that point.
---
breaking news the alliance co-leader has been posting on reddit all this time
---
Having caps should be a luxury not a commodity.
---
People can afford caps after 3 months of grinding and skill injecting.

It used to be 3 years or longer

NC 'accidentally' kill the wrong titan?

with small shield extenders to boot!

G*d bless

You got me

Agreed. Anyways, I kinda like the idea of limiting the number of players in a region with a soft cap (like you mentioned with diminishing rewards for really large groups in a single region). So I decided to start working on something that has been floating through my head. It would only work with reworked anomalies that would be more valuable (where a Sanctum is currently worth up to 40m in bounties a Yard is only worth like 1m in bounties, I'd like to see a rise in anomaly value and difficulty across the board)
---
#Diminishing returns for PvE anomalies
---
**Goals:**
---
- Limit the number of players that can utilize any given area of space.
---
- Incentivize/require large concentrations of players to spread out more to make ISK.
---
**Mechanics:**
---
- There is a finite number of anomalies that can be in space at any given time. This number depends on the number of sites that has been run all over space in the past month. More sites being run = more sites in space (to ensure there will be enough/limited sites regardless of server population).
---
- Any time an anomaly despawns it will be added to the global "to spawn" anomaly queue with a timer for when it will be spawned again.
---
- Sov upgrades influence the chance for an anomaly to spawn in the given system.
---
- Security status influences the chance for different anomaly classes to spawn in a given system. Say a Sanctum is twice as likely to spawn in a -1.0 system as in a -0.8 system.
---
- If a system has more anomalies in it the chance for it to get new anomalies will go down. 
---
**What would happen:**
---
- In heavily farmed regions the number of anomalies will go down because empty regions would get more and more anomalies. This would raise competition for sites and incentivize spreading out alliances.
---
- Areas that are underused would get more anomalies in them, giving smaller groups or individuals a possibility to make ISK from them there.
---
This is all probably wishful thinking, since I'm pretty certain everything would go differently from how I imagined it. Guess I'll be writing some Python scripts to visualize this and see if it'd have any effect ^^
---
Funny enough when I first found out that it was called both names my initial thought was "Goons want a war named after themselves that promotes the narrative that it was them versus the Galaxy? Screw that, I'm calling it The Casino War!" Only later to realize it was Thier enemies that wanted the name the recognizes goons....
---
Actually, if a capsuleer (or anyone with a clone) dies outside a capsule they don't die, they just come back to the clone with the last "saved data" and no memory of anything that happened after that.

It's clear in a couple of chronicles (the first being the one about a shady talk in a bar that ends blowimg up).

Why is this being down voted? Its hilarious
---
I'm not sure if CCP changed the lore after getting rid of having to update your clone, but it certainly used to be canon that a back-up was always stored - it was just a question of how recently it had been updated.
---
If I remember correctly, the first EVE novel included a character who forgot how to fly an Interceptor after getting prodded unexpectedly - I could be wrong, it's been a while.

well, no.

There are not two names. It was always World War Bee and rightfully so because everyone came together to fight Goons and their pets. It was only after Goons CEO realized they could not win that they started spinning and attempting to change the name of the war. The name the CEO of Goons came up with was an attempt to give a excuse for losing, blaming it on where the isk came from. If they won they would not have a problem with the name but they lost and they lost badly, thats why the Goon plebs get so upset about the name of the war, WORLD WAR BEE.

Honestly i'm not sure if i'm more annoyed by the straight stats buff that capitals get or the instant response time. I think if ccp wants to keep caps in the game one thing they could do to alleviate the stupid umbrellas would be to remove jump drives from every cap except jump freighter and easy cyno fitting. Portal generators can stay on titans to help move sub cap fleets around but if you want to move your caps you best be prepared to gate. Also cynos should take a ridiculous amount of fitting (like battleship levels or maybe a specialized cyno fit battlecruiser) something to make them slower and a charge up time like an mjd. No more single frigs that show up and light it before cruisers can lock them. Capitals should be slow and your heavy hitters not your one stop shop response to fleets.
---
It really isn't anywhere near the same. Mass proliferation of Rorquals and Titans have changed things immensely, and the Citadel spam on top of that.
---
Sorry didn’t know where to post it, new to the eve subreddit

I'm looking at the new agent finder window. In the bottom right corner of each agent card, it shows the effective standing. Most of them show that number in blue, but some show in red. I can't figure out what the pattern is for which are which color.
---
* It doesn't appear to be an over/under or available/unavailable thing.
---
* I've seen two agents of the same level, type, and faction, in the same system, where one is red and the other is blue.
---
* I've seen two agents of the same level, type, and corp, where one is red and the other is blue.

Same way people getting credit for player bounties works. If you're in fleet, on grid, you get a portion of the bounty payout. Expand that to the killmails endpoints.

Be sure to rotate out guys from roles to other pilots so your crew has some familiarity with each role in case your standard role fillers get blapped.

I'm not sure where the author got the lore, but the Empyrean Age had plenty of answers regarding cloning. Conciousness transfer is tied to clone vat bays.

I mean, EvE had 60,000 concurrent players at its height, I don’t think anyone would have said “EvE is dying” then.
---
That would be frigging hilarious :-)
---
Warp to me accepts people in the order they join, not based on who has better fits. Although you should have one of their posted fittings.
---
Isk per h is great but currently gives me wrong values and therefore is useless... I haven’t really got it to work properly, any tips?
---
Yes there is, that's the main way you move caps. Find connection to null/low, find connection in target hole to null/low, plan cyno route through from one spot to the other to quickly move it to the target hole.
---
To add to that, IIRC thats an *additional service* that capsuleers can pay for, But is not a default thing, They have to pay for a backup like that
---
That is what happens when they meet an enemy who can fight back lol....
---
The rest did it behind his back, don't tell him.
---
Yeah, Serenity started dying with botting/input broadcasting basically died the moment the Chinese government said that it had to be allowed. It's been in a state of staleness we on TQ would call ded game for basically forever after.

There is no one explicit turn CCP made lmao there multiple like still having shit default overview that confuses newplayers along, npe is still a steaming pile of garbage that can still be improved on more, they killed the easiest way for newbies to PvP (faction warfare/lowsec) and hell there is alot of shit CCP pretends they're blind to that they can fix

You say that lol, but I was there and they were doing it all the same.

Ironically, the other guy is right. You can put down POSes, but they can't do any moon mining, industry, jump bridges, or anything else useful for that matter. So you need to use upwell structures.

I'm trying to use pyfa to figure out scan probe strength on a Helios fit and the [only candidate number](https://i.imgur.com/bsEhqpL.png) I can see on the display makes no sense.
---
The fit is like 
---
    [Helios, Foo Helios]
---
    Co-Processor II
---
    Nanofiber Internal Structure II
---
    Scan Pinpointing Array II
---
    Scan Rangefinding Array II
---
    5MN Microwarpdrive II
---
    Sisters Expanded Probe Launcher, Sisters Combat Scanner Probe
---
    Covert Ops Cloaking Device II
---
    Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade II
---
    [Empty Rig slot]
---
and the pilot has Covops V and all scanning skills at V, with no implants. Even with the full set of mid-grade Virtues and a Poteque AR-810, the resulting number (25.8) is not close to what I was expecting, which is in the neighborhood of 200.
---
What is the number being reported, and is there a way to make pyfa show the probe strength I'm interested in?
---
Sorry you disagree with the name of the war we are talking about. It is and will always be the Casino War, you should just accept it.
---
I mean it would be.  And it's not that hard to require omega to for holding sov
---
Not hard to spoof those
---
Those were there since the beginning, and they do not lower missile damages.
---
huh? of course they do.  why so angry?
---
Must have lost the number for Amarr.... They are more weeb then Amarrian these days
---
I've tried 10-50km, didn't work.
---
&gt; Well... I don't actually know all about Eve "history" 
---
Well... it's so much easier to formulate bad opinions when you accept that you know fuck all about whatever tickles your little nub. You be you.
---
Well, not anymore. NC. and PL kept goons at bay by being able to field higher SP characters. The mining changes to the Rorqual and skill injectprs completely upended that game. Goons always had more members, they might have had the wealth in the past, but you had to buy a supercap toon that needed to train the full duration of the skills to get to a supercap. Now you can multcharacter train, then harvest those characters and inject/sell all those skillpoints into a single character and become almost immediately supercap ready.
---
Back when I was at that point mining was fairly worthless, rats were a limited resource, no multichar training, nothing of the sort. The CCP changes enabled goons to overtake PL and NC. because of the sheer numbers they have. Most of us already had supercapitals, and you can only multibox so many in a fight.
---
Nope, what you had was the raspberry jam and peanutbutter donut. Now it's going to be only raspberry jam.
---
We don't want him back.
---
It is known
---
The Chinese government said Input broadcasting and botting had to be allowed? When did they say that? Why?

more EHP?

there are any amarrian left?

Unspoken Alliance did a battle royale event a few months ago. Everyone (teams of two) started in pods together in a mess of t1 cruiser hulls (unfit with a mobile depot inside)Throughout the celestials and belts etc were cans of various equipment. Every few minutes there was a carrier that would warp in and drop a big “supply drop” of better gear and occasionally some different ships (we had a harbinger drop I believe). Each celestial had a mobile scan inhib and a anchorable bubble (cans were in the middle of the bubble). If your ship was blown up you could grab another but you’d have to scavenge leftovers to make it work. So in theory you could respawn and still win just became harder. If you were podded rip.
---
The carrier pilot would also call when celestials were being “removed” so players were not to go to any of those once they were offlimits. 
---
People were fitting their ships on the fly and the carrier drops also had a nice forced content. Final showdown at the sun inside a giant bubble. Couldn’t leave the bubble or the carrier would frag you. Last team standing split 5b I believe.
---
It was pretty awesome. We likely would have done it again, but shortly after we started the spire campaign and that became the focus.
---
:(( would you have considered sticking around if the at hadn't been cancelled this year?
---
true, but if you nerf capitals too much, they will have no use.  I'm all for nerfing application, but capitals need to be the counter to something other than just BS or other capitals.  as it is right now most fleets are just HACs or T3C
---
v0v that's what SRP funds are for. I lost 3 Warrior IIs and we killed enough ships to make me happy. I know as they are on my KB.

ps state protectorate is not a default npc corp that you go into after you get kicked, its one you go into after pressing 'enlist me' in the faction warfare sheet.

how many people do you need to bash a keepstar? just base it off any recent one you've done

but panfam havn't really lost any fights so far, right?

I'm not disappointing - seeing provi reddit posters shit on you about being bad at EVE is extremely satisfying.

wow I think you're legally brain dead. the EXACT same people were enemies of tapirium 8 months ago as are today.

are you flair baiting or in a medically-induced coma? you're in tri. test evicted you and took your home. and here you are defending them? honestly - get the fuck out. did you start playing the game 2 months ago? are you completely stupid? or just convincingly acting like you are?
---
Why would you spread your group over multiple smaller alliances if you could just have a bunch of holding alliances? ADM's would still be kept up by everyone krabbing in the space.
---
As for holding alliances: if your *n*th constellation would cost more than a subscription it'd be worth it to create an account with holding characters for extra holding alliances. It'd be more tedious, but it wouldn't remove the safety in numbers, supercap umbrellas and all that shit.

There's always more candidates for DD than Logi though.

I’ll tell you something, if that was a thing, someone would find a way to use that as a means to prevent people from cloaking near a station and to prevent undocks where people can insta-warp to a bookmark on undock.

The first Provi campaign I was involved in was post Halloween war in early 2014 where we took all their R64s in order to replace losses. The second was right after the introduction of fozziesov where it was a limited campaign done with the agreement of provibloc to help them figure out how to defend using the, at the time, new mechanics as goonies had announced they were going to spend a month taking all of provi space.
---
The last one was last year where we based out of Misaba. This was a capital only deployment, no supers involved.

So which other time am I missing?

There aren't any game changes they can implement, when people just want to be friends and not fight that's what's gonna happen no matter what ccp tries to do, they can't force people to fight
---
Who cares
---
A lot of people have already said it but:  
---
1. Have many Cyno alts in common LS &gt; HS systems.  
---
2. Have your Nyx AND your own JF in range of all of them, with alliance capital support in case you get baited.  
---
3. See JF Cyno in and dock.  
---
4. Activate your own Cyno and jump through your JF. This makes it appear like your are a hauler and sets you up to loot.  
---
5. When JF undocks and speed/direction starts to change, jump in your Nyx and kill it with Heavy Fighter Torpedos.  
---
6. Align to a safe with your Nyx as your are fucked for 60s from activating your NSA.  
---
7. Undock your JF and loot (should be within range), then dock back up or head to the HS gate if it's safe.  
---
8. Warp away your Nyx, cloak and wait for your jump fatigue to finish.  
---
9. Haul/sell your loot, get your ships back to where the started, rinse repeat.  
---
Happy hunting!

Also ejecting in space then reboarding has been something that has worked in the past.  Ive had the same issues tho.

---
Actually I don't mind the Billboards I think they're quite interesting
---
To my knowledge, it has to do with how they deal with fair play. In the west, the method is to make modifications and hacking a bannable offense, and to squash the ones that try it. The chinese reasoning is different. The idea is that, if everyone is given equal access to hacks/mods/botting, then using those programs is fair.
---
I'm not from Serenity though, and I could be missing part or most of the story
---
This is arranged fights in T1 cruisers just with way more steps.
---
I mean you yourself explains that it would be tedius.  The trade off won't be the cost of a plex, but there would be a tradeoff.  Most people woudn't make 30 accounts, and even if the distribute the power that's better.  Mistakes and betrayals happen.  But hey, we are arguing over a fictitious solution to a real problem.
---
Wrong turn?  Their profits increased through to 2013, and have held damn near steady at that since then.  Pay-2-Skill is real.

sounds fun to bring some dudes down there to see what happens. and yeah not a fan of tidi shitfest (that's a goon thing)
---
yeah we did use a lot of intes while pl and friends used entos fax , I do remember fleets pretty much up all the time till the very end when the move to Delve
---
Yup
---
Imagine being a neutral entity that declares war and then gets upset about not being treated like a neutral anymore. Truly sad.
---
If you get caught in a camped bubble you're dead on arrival. If you land in an uncamped bubble, you can probably just try to burn out of it or into it, depending on your destination. Warpcore stabs CAN help when you get caught in a data/relic site by an interceptor. Triple stabbing CAN help you through a gang tackling you. However, you should probably swap one of the warpcore stabs with an Inertia Stabiliser.
---
Overall explorers are usually more dependant on luck and prayers. Eve is a game where you can be prepared as good as you want and your prepping falls over as soon something happens.
---
Dear Horde, Uncle NC was drunk during the first clip. I promise Unc is sober now.
---
I agree this wasn't the intent of the players and something had to be done but you can't deny that the CCP hireups stepped in and stopped the devs from shaking the sandbox afterwards. I havent seen any big shaking changes apart from maybe stations in the last 4-5 years i was away from the game which is kind of sad :(
---
wut
---
From my knowledge thats not what happened. 
---
Basically, to ban someone in China you need absolute proof, the botter can go to court to prove it. Its not worth the risk so they just didn't police it.
---
Yes because how good a company is doing profits wise really determines how healthy their main game is
---
Man some of you people on r/eve are real 🤡s
---
Oh no they did. I joined in 2012, and i saw Eve is Dying threads all through the "golden years" till i quit in 2016
---
Hard to say, obviously I'm not privy to the FC's thought process but there was no particular indication given on comms that we were already leaving. Certainly we couldn't have fought that fleet given that they had more NMs than we had eagles and 10 t2 logi, but we could have tried to skirmish and pick off small stuff and whatnot (it's what I would have done, anyway). The warp where the awoxer scrammed the FC and got him caught was to an anom rather than a gate, so IMO it wasn't an obvious 'run away!' warp so much as a 'let's not let nightmares land on eagles at zero' warp.
---
I think who the FC was is almost a moot point TBH, even without the awox the numbers were not going to let us engage anyway. Provi just outformed us, which is what you *want* to do in a war anyway so more power to them.
---
Reason #6878 why I've never rated HTP
---
To be fair goons and panfam arent fighting...goons are grinding structures and panfam went first to delve fishing supers and now are apperantly in provi baiting proviblock
---
B...but his killboard, man!
---
I did indeed have a clean alt in the fleet, as I have done for every major fleet they've done since the start of this "war".
---
And it was this toon that got the initial tackle, albeit only briefly before the Provi tacklers were on him. Whether that short time would have saved him, I can't really say for sure. - I was too busy burning out of point-range of the Provi tackle, who all assumed I was one of the baddies. I don't think any of them realized I was on their side lol
---
Regardless, Redline can't really complain much. If he had been aligned he'd have been the first in warp, being the one initiating the fleet warps. However he wasn't, and his fleet warped off without him, giving me an opportunity I definitely wasn't going to give up. He screwed this up for himself.
---
Been playing since 2008. Most fun I've had in eve. But all good things come to an end. Thanks for all the fish.

These issues have been around since 2009. If this alone was enough to kill eve it would be dead by now.
