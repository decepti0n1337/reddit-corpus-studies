Botting is banned. So why make it riskier. Just ban them and be done with them. Subcaps actually can make isk now of they choose to. It's relatively easy with a few different fits which dont involve constant drones.
---
---
---
Daytrippers from K-space, don't forget them!
---

---
And a lot of those highsec bots are now doing exploration sites in low class wh space.
---
Short term fluctuations are why I took long term averages to measure their share in all the farm the best. For blackout, we don't know what'll happen long term and I already admit that.
---
Since I am measuring percentage shares, its better to compare 2 years before blackout vs 2 months into blackout, rather than comparing any 2 month period before blackout vs 2 months into blackout.
---
They have never been (at least not on TQ) so i don't think that's the reasoning behind it
---
Funny.  I read it in my voice too!
---
Not really, not everyone constantly spams dscan as this sub makes it out to be. I would bet that having it behind a acceleration gate gives the ratter a false sense of security. Thus making them sp dscan less.
---
&gt; absolutely false, nullsec botting is almost non-existent
---
That's not what he said.
---
I get the most accurate results.
---
If I compared 2 months just before the blackout, to 2 months after, results would support my conclusion even more because alliances were at war.
---
I am not a reddit mod.

---
No Deteroid, no Catch, no Impass, no Kaevala, no P falls. All places with supercapital coverage.
---
buff payout, buff loot drops, add lp payouts to rats, double the rewards in some way.
---
Yeah so what? You´re comparing the entirety of wh space (which has more than a 1000 systems) to a single region in nullsec. The idea that a single region with 97 systems did almost as much isk as an entire sector of space with more than 10 times the systems is pretty indicative of how bad things really are in nullsec.
---
Then who stickied your post?
---
You seem to be really dense. Delve is the highest developed null region there ever was. And it's more populated than any other null region. And still it pales in comparison to WH crabbing. Every other nullsec region is more or less a complete shithole lately.
---
No? The data without active player numbers etc can show that blackout affects the income sources of Imperium/TEST/Panfam more than others.
---
Well its one now
---
Ill just go ahead and lul you. Lul:)
---
Measuring numbers from Delve while goons are deployed somewhere in Tribute would of course yield the most accurate data for pve activities there, amirite fam?
---
So you've never been an actual line member in any of those groups, right?
---
Can't say
---
Wish banning solved botting though.
---
Cyno changes will be much harder for smaller groups to deal with than larger groups. Small groups with caps just got a massive tax increase to move their caps around.
---
I think your first subscription will be the most difficult however it should become easier and easier. 
---
Lots of people suggest salvaging and exploration  as a good way to earn isk right away. Getting yourself in a small - middle size null sec group with some good moons would work out ok as well. A basic mining barge training plan is about 7 days and can be improved a lot with another 7.
---
right, but what reason do we have to put our hard earned ships at risk? why should we leave our homeland at risk to potential random changes by ccp, and the  real possibility of not being able to get home?
---
so people can dock up when you're 4 systems away instead of in system.
---
Sounds like the bots were pretty effected then, there’s fuck all money to make in highsec unless you’re doing incursions, and no way a bunch of VNI bots can suddenly run incursions.
---
Then again the largest two alliances remain dormant and nobody fights Imperium anymore due to overblobbing.
---
Large fights do generate lots of fun, content and publicity. But if you let blobs grow more than a certain point, there are no more large fights.
---
Pretty clear.
---
INN had one recently.
---
Tinfoil, Jay did it because he can see this post is bad and he stickied so people can see how dumb Olmecca's analysis is.
---
I have been a linemember in all three.
---
"low-sec only resources" are something I suspect would be good for the game.
---
Oh look, another one.... reeeee
---
How do we know active players per region? What makes you think that blackout hasnt impacted active players per area? How many people in those area mined or ratted during these times? How can you qualify your statement that one area is impacted more than another without player numbers?
---
I predict that'll turn out to be false.
---
Everyone in my corp multiboxes for PvP, in fact nearly everyone in C5 space multiboxes for PvP, it's a requirement in a lot of the corps to be able to do at least 2 useful roles, with a lot of people doing more. I usually run 4.
---
They have these things called athanors now that let wormholers moon mine, I've heard with rorq fleets sometimes. Seen mostly in C1 holes I believe.
---
Bounty Hunting is a myth.
---
Are you seriously grasping at that last straw that is the swiss cheese people call the frat umbrella? Have fun dying on that hill lmao
---
Hahaha, considering bots don't value their time, even a small amount of isk is worth it to them.
---
very cool
---
I like how you don't suggest highsec at all lmao
---
&gt; Panfam got evicted. What do you me to do?
---
Remove it from the dataset
---
&gt; FRT is new
---
fucking lol
---
You could look into a 3rd party subscription service like Markeedragon.com and see if the exchange rate is any better.
---
Were the leading questions written by one of the authors of the "OFFICIAL FAKE NEWS MEDIA POLLS?" Jesus.
---
learning to admit your mistakes is maturity, you will get there someday
---
I highly recommend investing time doing new player roles. I spend time thinking about it because I was a guy who went through my alliances New Player programs in 2011 and they were comprehensive and successful. The big blocs all seem to have great new player focused education. 
---
Eve University exists as well. I don't hear much from RVB these days. A challenge I have for CCP: 
---
Why are the players the ones having to develop the optimal New Player experiences?
---
I'm bored also. The changes don't really touch what I do in game regardless. Stale is stale.
---
That doesn't make for a convincing argument.
---
You're making a claim that is at odds with what is to be logically expected; you need to present something better than "trust me, I know what I'm talking about". 
---
I'm not saying you're necessarily wrong - you have some degree of credibility and I'm reserving judgement until I hear the logic behind your claim.
---
SWG tried to make the game easier, CCP are trying to make the game harder.
---
I don't have to know about playercounts to gauge the claim whether blackout hurts Imperium/Panfam/TEST less than others. The farm numbers give a good story.
---
It was also only implemented in null
---
No, but measuring two years is equally as dumb
---
Given the reduction in ratting, I think this might not be a game breaker. That said, I’d be more interested in seeing PVE revamped to encourage ratting in groups so subcaps have a better chance of defending themselves (or at least have a chance of escape because someone else got tackled instead of themselves). Something between incursions and high-class WH sites.
---
The sand box needs to change a lot more than recent changes.
---
As if a chat blackout is actually interesting content for people. If that's the high water mark of new content God save us
---
Yes but you need to qualify your numbers vs the amount of people ratting and mining. If less people gained that amount of isk/ore under an umbrella vs a huge amount under no umbrella, the players under umbrellas are actually gaining more individually. Overall the entities may be making less, but individually, that is not the case. This entire post is flawed.
---
I surely can't look at past 2 years like I can do with other regions. And again, there are lots of reasons to not to count them as umbrella.
---
The actual claim I interested in gauging is whether blackout hurts Imperium/TEST/Panfam less than others. No FRT person made the same claim to me anyway.
---
We strongly relayed most of these issues to CCP during the summit. New players are the most important developmental focus atm.
---
Hey you
---
If they went to hisec then they are earning much less money, which is still good.
---
e
---
Oh ye, its not that I realise wasting my time with you is worse than cutting myself. Its that Im wrong. Cool bro. Now get lost.
---
&gt; That doesn't make for a convincing argument.
---
Thats as far as what I can give you.
---
Anything I do is questionable to the zealous null linemember.
---
About as much as CCP knows about player retention.
---
And when you die... "Mimsyyyyyy!"
---
When was the last time you looked at Plex prices? 2011?
---
With less people mining in nullsec, empire ore increases in value. Missions are able to be done via bot. Market bots. You really think they will make a significantly less amount of isk to matter? I don't.
---
&gt;you are more risk averse than people playing wow.
---
Oh? Can you even tell me my in game name? :P
---
Lol
---
Look up Ronin ONE. We're wormholers. Don't talk to me about being risk averse because we literally put all our assets on the line.
---
Why don't you just go to wow? If it's so good... Or just move to high sec. You'll be safe there.
---
&gt; Remove it from the dataset
---
As a matter of fact I tried that version and it doesn't change the results more.
---
But then you'd whine about why I dont have panfam in "umbrella regions", like you're doing with FRT right now.
---
To plex an account takes about 1.6billion isk give or take.  If you were to afk mine for 6 hours in hisec, that might net you 30mil or so per session.  Maybe less.  Alternatively, you can ice mine and maybe do 50m in the same time frame.  All of this presupposes you aren popped by code or any number of ganky squatters that plague hisec ice.  Other revenue streams are abyssals, the new abyssal combat sites, lvl 4 missions.  Most of which will yield similar or less results.  In my opinion, your best bet is to hook up with an alpha friendly null bloc and see what they have going on while you save iskies for plex.  Then, when you have an idea on what to do, plex up and hit the ground running.  I will leave you with this however: I do not recommend playing this game with the intent for it to pay for itself, it becomes a job and not a game.
---
Eve Online doesn’t have a large enough of a player base to affect Netflix stock. Even if everyone who had ever played the game started or stopped watching, it still wouldn't be enough people to cause a visible change in that graph.
---
At it's peak Eve had 300,000 and it has significantly reduced. Netflix has 152,000,000 subscribers.
---
Im a bit amazed Olmeca. That you atleast can see an issue with it.
---
How relatively expensive is the subscription? and i have only basic knowledge of the game, where can i find information on how to start and get things going faster?
---
HE SAID EVE IS DYING
---
Source: Any serious fleet is 100% Omega.
---
fountain 2013.. the endless gamble on what to click during pos shoots.
---
It’s about 1.7b isk. For most established players that isn’t very much however for new players it can seem like a lot. 
---
I guess it really depends on how much free time you are willing to commit to plexing you accounts each month
---
Fair enough.
---
I think you're giving CCP and the blackout too much credit, and mistaken about the impact it had on ratting activity.
---
Judging by your upvotes, though, hundreds of people agree with you, so I'm sure you'll survive the weight of my disapproval.
---
Ok cool. Just to qualify, I make it a point to go out and do a role/playstyle before I criticize or talk about it.
---
When blackout went down. I got out in a noctis and salvaged hubs in Delve just to see what it would be like, with dscan open. I ended up coming out on top, but I got dunked on inside 2 hours, and would have maybe lived if I fit 3x t2 warp core stabs. I knew it would happen, didn’t use an MTU. 
---
Do you have an opinion on mobile scan inhibs and are you allowed to say if ccp is thinking about making them a more adoptable thing?
---
The more time you can add up under similar condition the more accurate the resulting average. Thats not dumh that a logical conclusion. The only problematic im seeing is that the time after the blackout was way too short to read much into these numbers. It still gives a nice indicator though.
---
TIL how percentages work amirite
---
Thank you very much. I was getting desperate thinking nobody got the reference. &lt;3
---
There are incursion bots and Im fairly certain also abyssal ones.
---
&gt; Though Noraus claimed that WC is friendly to all Chinese players
---
*PLA not included
---
&gt; Do you have an opinion on mobile scan inhibs 
---
I think they are cool.
---
&gt; are you allowed to say if ccp is thinking about making them a more adoptable thing?
---
i can say it didn't come up. im not quite sure what would happen if we made them scoopable though. imagine everyone using them. then you'd deploy some additional "decoys" and remain rather safe.
---
Perhaps CCP can tweak them to hide subcaps but not hide capitals though.
---
How is it possible that a smaller group with less access to wealth, fewer numbers of players and harder logistics routes somehow going to be better off with cyno changes that drastically increased the skill requirements for alts and the cost of ships to do things they were doing cheaply before? 
---
I don't see how it's even possible to argue against that proposition.
---
It really is exactly how to talk about them.
---
RE: PCU
---
* Go to Eve-offline
---
* Set range to 2 months
---
* Drop-off really takes off on 26th August, AKA Classic WoW
---
CCP had years to do something like Blackout and they leave until the month of the mass-exodus to finally do it.
---
I’m thinking that making them scoopable would be a game changer for counter-play, traps, subcap escalations, and would make life scarier for anything with jump drives. I’m glad you said it so I didn’t say it and get helldownvoted.
---
What is EVE-O preview, I have no fuckin clue
---
This sub has really been awful to read the last few days. So many wannabe Game Designers thinking their idea to fix the game is god's gift to humanity. Now you get Olmeca posting cherry picked data and presenting it as gospel. I hope steps are taken by the moderation team to clean this stuff up.
---
There's plenty of fights to be found if you have the balls and competency to do small group thingsTM
---
It'd be interesting to do that and then make them not hide capitals anymore.
---
Ia! Ia! Bob fhtagn!
---
[you need to understand something, at this point, me being here discussing stats is a favor to you, I can go talk to CCP instead](https://i.imgur.com/Opie6vg.png)

HAST DU DROHNEN???
---
Is this for real?
---
Yes
---
Lolmeca is kind of a big deal.
---
&gt; This is why people don't believe your "data" everytime you post it; you change things around and then say "trust me it's the same".
---
haha .. you are right, CCP just trying everything!
---
What is wrong with that guy? His post is beyond flawed yet thinks he's doing us a favour?
---
If I had to guess, it is because it is the Fox News of Blackout posts. Seemingly data driven, not pro-blackout or anti-blackout.
---
my dude globby comin in with the clutch ideas!
---
1 hour a day of incursions would get you a subscription in about 15 days. If you find them fun then you're set. If you start doing then and find yourself less fond of them you could look into other methods, just dont force yourself into grinding an activity that you dont enjoy
---
&gt; we want to incentivize people heavily putting themselves in risk of pvp action
---
The people you want to incentivize that way are heavily incentivized in the other direction though. It's why they all apparently stopped playing when it became not 99.9% safe to rat.
---
Don't you think it's a little broken that the swiss army knive of mining (booster, miner, compressor, decent defense with drones) with the 5 min invincible button can also be used as a cheap jumpfreighter that in addition has a bay to carry some ships?
---
"Impartial" \*wink wink nudge nudge\*?
---
He's correct about FRT being new, but I agree with you leaving PanFam in the data. They're setup with their umbrella again.
---
There was a really good remix with below the asteroids and some Aura quotes mixed in I have tore-find
---
Even so, that post is beyond flawed for what he is trying to suggest.
---
i play them because they are engaging and entertaining, why else ? not gonna sit here and jerk myself off thinking ill turn into the next jack kerouac by playing eve or posting on reddit. you are saying stupid shit, forcing me to dress your dumb ass shit down, which is entertaining in its own right. thats all there is to it.
---
you get it :P
---
That screencap was from a few weeks ago. I have no idea why his post is stickied though, it's not like the "other side" gets their post stickied.
---
Holy hell you hit the nail on the head. This is me right now, if I undock trying to make isk for fleet i struggle to come out isk positive. I just end up feeding and no one is coming to save me in my subcap ratting ship and trying to get people to team up for ratting.... I have money coming in from pi but it’s less than what’s going out. I tried jump clone to HS to do level 4s but war target guys + triglavians and the fact I’m not hanging out with my alliance just make it not really fun. I dunno what I will do when I finally run out of money
---
Well that guy seems full of himself. We've been on opposing sides and had quite a few head-butting matches on here before, but on all of this bullshit that CCP is doing right now, I for the first time ever, am pretty much on side with what goons are saying, and test, and many of the other null players. CCP done fucked up.
---
And they can just make more bots to increase income I imagine.
---
They should get that ability when they lose their tank bonuses, dps bonuses and panic.
---
Its an out of context screenshot
---
Login events didnt do anything. They didnt end right around that time.
---
because nullsec isk generation is shit compared to highsec and lowsec outside of mass multiboxing and high capital investment stuff
---
Pretty much, with injectors they can replace banned ones within a matter of minutes too.
---
&gt; cutting myself.
---
good luck :)
---
Why has your post been pinned while other, less flawed, data posts have been ignored? Do you know?
---
Why is this post pinned?
---
Its easy to poke holes and throw shit on any kind of data. 
---
Next time someone claims blackout helps Imperium/Legacy/Pamfam more I'd love to see their data.
---
:sarcasm:
---
Dude its really simple. Income/capita is much much higher in WHs than in NS. Thats just a fact. So you say you dont make as much isk which is cool. Nerf the ones that do it. Its been all talks about how we need the blackout to handle "inflation" and massive faucets. So here you see a big faucet, just cut down isk making for those just like its been done to superratting several times this year alone.
---
Obviously if the isk pay out is high enough people will rat even if it's only 0.01 % safe. Right?
---
A 25-40% increase will not push people back into ratting. Not when the blackout setup is just so damn awfully implemented.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
What a generous CSM
---
Eh ye CCP said it. Olmeca keeps chanting it. Thats what faucets are all about?
---
Ratting=/= line member. So you have not been a line member in any 0.0 block?
---
I think it is more like the CNN headline of the Blackout
---
:sillybillyme:
---
You cry about getting dropped and are supporting ccp as they make that more hard. Like my wow comparison this is like crying about a 60 ganking you at 20?
---
I am not the one asking for safety you are the one saying people are bringing to big of ships.
---
\*You're
---
You picked regions without consistency and then pushed a narrative with it. It was factually dishonest.
---
Or the fact that he compared from a time frame when mining and isk making was much higher. Don't forget it has been nerfed repeatedly in the past 2 years.
---
[I fixed your data analysis.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15k756IpVYpWEBSE6pyx1iBzTLb3cLXQ0amkzENUs4JY/edit?usp=sharing)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What this shows is that the % mining value generated by nullsec powerblocs have seen little-to-no change or shift into smaller entities. It simply shows an overall decrease of mining value generated in nullsec has shifted to highsec - almost directly proportional - most likely due to afk Orca mining and etc.
---
So the whole thing is flawed because your picking and choosing what umbrella regions to include because someone did or did not say something.
---
This is why I ignore these processed data pieces. They can be manipulated or spun for a narrative.
---
I come to Olmeca threads mainly to see the salt in the most down voted comments, its 2 hours old and I expected more already
---
Assuming that WinterCo is middle sized alliance.
---
Yeah, no further questions.
---
Share some?  Making my own too.
---
Wait what? Why are you using systems? You have to look at per capita numbers. System numbers means literally nothing.
---
WHs make a shitton more isk/capita than NS does.
---
Anthem &gt; EVE. GG Olmeca, you got what you wanted, and killed a game in the process.
---
I reserve my Hilmar-given right to stubbornly hold on to all my preconceived notions!!
---
This should not be pinned
---
They were multiboxing netflix too, obviously.
---
Why do you let me trigger you so much? Like... I dunno... turn your computer off or something bro lmao.
---
EDIT: To naysayers who predictably didn't like my definition of "umbrella" regions, I am happy with merely proving that blackout didn't harm Imperium/TEST/Panfam less than others. The point still stands. Being the largest and most organized 3 groups didn't help these groups to ride blackout out better off than others so far. Your criticism takes nothing away from the main point of this post.
---
If you want to imply that these numbers can be caused by non umbrella regions currently having more individiual active players (in comparison to before) then you're still kinda making his point for him though unless this changes again.
---
Then how do you correct for the fact that isk and mining levels were nerfed for the past two years? You are comparing the peak of isk making levels to current levels.
---
I was about to ask the same thing lol... It honestly blows my mind this shit still happens 5-6+ times a year to a titan, we got two of em, test got that vanq, this Erebus... God knows how many others .... "Burn up so u can't be warped" or ..... Hold on here big brain..... BE IN A FLEET AND EXEMPT WARP WHEN IN SUPERS LOL......don't ever accept a random invite, lesson learned the hard way I guess
---
Damn.... that is a lot of goons circlejerking in this thread.
---
blackout is implemented perfectly
---
doubling rewards and reworking anoms would be huge for the game
---
&gt;someone told me i would have to play like, 8 hours every single day and waste all of my money just to keep a subscription.
---
Someone doesn't sound like they know how to play. As others have said, first PLEX is the hardest but it gets easier as you progress in-game and out. Note risk=more reward. If you stay in high sec (the "safe" areas), you will probably spend 8 hours daily just to pay subscription unless you run incursions or abyssal sites. As for passive income, the closest I can think of is planetary interaction and skill farming, both requiring some capital.
---
Right, that's what was killing the game. Try and keep up.
---
Trigger? Please! It’s more like a laugh, “oh let’s see what new moronic statement robo said.” I wonder if he will finally let us know when goons are finally getting to hs?
---
This aged well :3
---
Because the previous status quo benefited them even more. 
---
Large groups actually attract more hunters to their regions and recruit players lesser than average knowledge/caution. These in turn have to be counterbalanced by the organizational advantage you're citing, in order to provide safety. To provide the safety, large groups took better advantage of centralized umbrellas and being able to freely drop capitals. Nothing much was expected from individuals themselves.
---
Now that blackout (and particularly cyno changes) expect much more out of capital farmers to get saved (or to even access farming, e.g. it's now forbidden to "solo mine" and practically impossible to "afk excavator mine"), it will hurt large entities more because they have more people roaming or specifically interested in hunting in their regions.
---
How so? Can you tell me how many players are no longer logging in within these umbrella alliances? Can you tell me if the larger empire alliances have lost more players than the other smaller alliances? Are they suffering equally? Point is, much of this is conjecture and is posted for a purpose other than clarity. It's to push a specific focus in the game.
---
Im not a goon.
---
You think giving plenty of info to hunters but none to PVE folk is perfect? Please...
---
One can only dream I guess.
---
Retarded
---
It's unlikely. The chart measures concurrency, so people just logging in to claim free SP would barely show up.
---
I'm sure there were lots of people who stopped logging in after the event but they're probably not showing up on the chart.
---
I wonder what this matters since the point of the post is based on a percentage comparison not on raw numbers and prior to nerfs everyone had access to the same stronger tools so that relation wouldn't change.  
---
  
---
5/50 and 50/500 are both 10%
---
hmmm......outnumbering them and having 2 full fleets against him....and you call victory lol....Jesus whats up with this cheap propaganda?
---
just press that 'x' in the top right of your browser bro, I don't think this place is for you.
---
Because those nerfs applied to everyone and didn't change anything between Panfam/TEST/Imperium and the others.
---
So like I said that makes you more risk averse than people in wow. So the more hardcore game became wow some how after the crying.
---
I bet you play the game with your pants on.
---
Somebody help me, should I buy calls or puts for yummy tendies?!
---
Yeah I've suggested excavators having fighter mechanics if Rorqs have to stay mining boats, and buffing their yield so you're capped on how many you can multibox but 1-2 Rorqs would be better than it is now.
---
True, I think all of us interact with highsec to some degree though.
---
Saying in an edit you admit the results are manipulated does not change the fact. The point does not stand in a practical manner anyway.  Whether these changes effect any person or group more than another is going to come down to the specific situation of that particular group. Sweeping generalities or disproving sweeping generalities is a fools game.
---
Can't be r/wallstreetbets, it's not a Robinhood screenshot.
---
i never said that
---
You didn't even included lands of entity with powerful supercap umbrella as umbrella protected null. That skewses the data. You cannot pull perfectly correct answers if the data has been contaminated.
---
So the big goon move op to hs, (since that’s where all the best isk making opportunities are), and that’s where your upcoming super goon war is going down) 
---
Is Hellen Keller driving and Ray Charles reading the map? 
---
Can you give us a rough idea when you all will be get there?
---
Seems legit
---
I never said i was talking about you but since were at it you seem to be enjoying riding their narratives more than a lot of their members so i really don't see a difference.
---
BBTB3 has adjusted Olmeca's spreadsheet, using the numbers olmeca provided in the sheet, to include the regions he neglected to include in the original.
---
You can see for yourself here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d3f9bi/data_does_blackout_really_hurt_the_small/f02qmf3/
---
[u/Olmeca\_Gold](https://www.reddit.com/user/Olmeca_Gold/), please quit the CSM and then EVE, you are the worst CSM member ever. Your contributions have lead to the mass EvExodus that is currently taking place.
---
Well, nothing new. I don't know if it's still the same site or certificate, but same the same thing was posted on Reddit around 2 weeks ago.
---
No. Adapt or die.
---
Exactly what I was thinking. I have 6 accounts or more. I keep three subbed. I would probably spend the same amount if subs were cheaper.
---
Why you think TEST wants detorid? so they can install more Russian botters lmao....but they fighting Frat and accusing them for botting when they have 2 of the biggest botter alliances under them....hypocrites much? lol
---
The difference is, as someone who has fought goons for years, I can actually see they have a point when all I want to do is tell them they are wrong.
---
I think youre underestimating a login events, note login, effects on the login counter. Its specifically designed to up logins. If you login, it will up the PCU no matter when you do it. It will affect average and it will affect concurrent, always. Like its literally its only purpose.
---
Then you agree that blackout is not implemented perfectly.
---
With regards to your question about effect on bots, the recent August Security Report clearly shows a sharp drop (more like a nosedive) in botting income from ratting in sov nullsec regions.
---
(link: [https://www.eveonline.com/article/pxf0x3/monthly-security-report-august-2019](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pxf0x3/monthly-security-report-august-2019) )
---
It would be interesting to see the other half of the data, a similar graph for non-botting players.
---
Just lol
---
My intention was to point out that if theres really a bigger individual activity loss in the blocs they have in fact beem hurt more than nonblocs. And if the overall playeractivity stayed the same then the blocs have lost more individual income in comparison which would also mean they have been hurt more.  
---
Both cases would make Olmecas point.
---
how do you figure?
---
You get exactly the same info, if not more from having other members active in your sov
---
A shit post we can all get behind.
---
Other members permanently camping gates you mean?
---
I just hunt. It's fun even I'm really bad.
---
And i have fought *for* them for long enough to know that they make no compromises for their own personal prosperity and have no issues trying to even bend reality and make up facts. They don't give a shit about the rest of us.  
---
So if i see two opposing points, i'll always see the non goon one as more trustworthy.
---
Well that is the case right now with killmails being instantly published on zkills. With NPCs killed being readily available. With people in space being readily available. With ADMs being readily available. That is plenty of info for hunters to look at and establish which systems are currently used, where to go to kill stuff. While what to PVE'ers get? The hope that there is someone sitting on a gate to see enemies? Then theres the fact said hunters can simply log off in said system to get around that entirely. Blackout is terribly implemented.
---
TEST is in a war and Imperium had a month of no mining if you REALLY wanna cherry pick.
---
Thats not the case, because individually, players would be getting more isk, while overall the entity would be getting less. The point is we dont have the member counts to specifically say who is hurting the most because of homogenisation of umbrella and non-umbrella groups.
---
No one is suggesting that nullsec has not been hurt, it has, its a ghost town compared to a few years ago. My point is, these stats are formatted in a way to form a narrative that simply doesn't show the whole picture, because it can't.
---
I regret voting for you. I'd hoped you'd be a balancing force, but your blind support for these changes are extremely disappointing. You want them so badly to work, you are deluding yourself into seeing what you hoped they would do, rather than they what they actually are doing. The post the op refers to shows that very clearly.
---
&gt;I even remarked that to avoid any danger of getting warped off is to burn up
---
Or you know not accept random fleet invites
---
1.7 billion isk and to start, you are probably going to make about 30 million isk per hour of game played. You can get that to about 50 without too much more time and you will probably top out at around 100. Incursion runners will tell you they can make 180-200 per hour, but they never include the time to move to New focus es, the time spent on the wait list, and the time spent waiting for an FC to log in.
---
Then you should see mine as more trustworthy, even though it echos much of what they say. Trust me, it is not something I relish, but, it is quite simply a terrible problem that eve is facing right now.
---
ON OUR WAY NOW!
---
Not everyone resists temptations like you and I my friend
---
&gt;Well that is the case right now with killmails being instantly published on zkills.
---
1) this hurts hunters more than pvers.
---
2) this has nothing to do with the blackout change
---
&gt;With NPCs killed being readily available.
---
1) this has nothing to do with the blackout change
---
&gt;With people in space being readily available.

---
None of this has anything to do with blackout or it's implementation. Just because things affect one-another, does not mean one change made to a system includes every single other aspect of the game.
---
They nerfed the spawn of wormholes to nullsec years ago because certain groups were scanning out chains to force project on to other groups and those groups bitched about it until they nerfed the spawn rate. Now they've buffed the spawn rate of wormholes going to drifter wormholes and essentially recreated the same kind of highway they nerfed years ago. 
---
I see you do not know what you're talking about...
---
Your post is flawed without specific numbers of players. You also didn't take into account activities of those players such as wars/mining bans and bans on super-ratting. This is cherry picking and flawed data manipulation for the sake of a narrative.
---
Why is this thread pinned?
---
My point wasn't to take anything away from your data, just linking to  a post that shows more.
---
Overall none of this really matters, the only thing that matters to me right now is that the login numbers are plummeting. While the AgE oF cHAoS stuff isn't entirely to blame (there was a bot purge and the release of cWoW) yet CCP is remaining quiet on everything which scares me. Normally when the players are like this (shit posting hard) CCP turtles up and stops posting and responding which, as far as I can tell, is happening.
---
Every week we are losing a thousand players and it feels like there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
---
Of course it has everything to do with blackout. If one system directly impacts on another it has something to do with it. If data is available to one side of an issue while the other side is kept completely in the dark, its fucked up. You can say it has nothing to do with blackout when it quite clearly has everything to do with is and allows for an easier time hunting. 
---
The problem now, however, is that because of the one-sidedness of blackout, very few people are mining or ratting, resulting in less people to hunt and kill. Go figure eh?
---
This thread is pinned because Olmeca is genuinely trying to create discussion not just posting shitty memes or armchair dev solutions.
---
If everyone who had EVER played? No dude, it would destroy that graph
---
You broke Olmeca with your cheap criticism:(
---
He is blatantly trying to form a narrative which is most certainly not trying to create discussion, but reinforce the idea that blackout is somehow not as bad as people are saying. He has had to be corrected also. This thread should not be pinned.
---
x
---
Even if a few individiuals get more, if the entity as a whole gets less it has been damaged. I can see where you're coming from, but i think you're reading more intention into this post than it has substance or message.
---
What is next? Player count increases?
---
No, the spodbrain has not yet begun its natural cycle of decay and should last at least another day of shitposting.
---
Implying logic had any place in the recent changes :P
---
Why? Because players that didn't like to share any risk are leaving the game. Why do you care? Keep playing or don't. I don't give a shit, but this constant whinery about you being right is pathetic and desperate.
---
guess there is some bias.
---
So is it safe to say the numbers show people leaving and not bots being removed/deactivated per CCP's narrative?
---
It goes further than that I think. Idk... Never been part of a major war myself and im no master fc. 
---
Most of the major historical upsets, the real confusing head scratchers of history, are a result of "defeat in detail" strategies. It's a tactic napoleon and others loved, and it's the one that got stone wall Jackson his nickname. It's a method for a small force to defeat a large force, usually via misdirection and over-extension. 
---
You can normally get an opponent to commit forces to the wrong area. That doesn't work very well if he can teleport his army...
---
Ideally, capital ship's would be major strategic assets. Very difficult to get to the front lines but extremely devastating as a result. Smaller ship's should always be more agile, tactically and stratigically. 
---
This would confer a defenders advantage to most null group and offer the chance to defeat enemies by drawing their caps to the wrong battlefield. 
---
Smaller ships, on the other hand, would become the norm for raiding and would have more utility in wars.
---
This also opens up the ability to make caps/super caps as scary as they probably should be. Grossly restricting their movement makes it ok to buff them. 
---
I think caps and super caps should have their movement grossly hamstrung, like, harder for them to even warp around system let alone jump between regions. Take away their cyno ability and make rorq mining/carrier ratting  retardedly easy, but make it mega slow to get between sites. Like... 5-10 minutes to align. Then, switch the DST and jump frieghter abilities. Deep space transports can jump Cynos and t2 frieghters are tanky as fuck with built in warp stabs. 
---
Just an opinion, but it might help with most of Eve's current problems.
---
So this no-risk bullshit needs to end. If you are in nullsec you are always at risk when undocked/untethered. The very notion that you are not is just nonsense. If you don't care about people playing eve, then maybe look at yourself and realise your toxic bullshit may be part of the issue facing this game. 
---
Note: Facts don't have feelings, the amount of players is dropping, fact, its not a whine.
---
My plan would be to get the first Plex, use it to keep on plex and have enough isk saved in order to get back to it if i need to stop playing for a while for some reason.
---
Does the game have banks? and how safe are they?
---
stonks
---
Sort by new, never notice what is pinned and what isn't unless I'm looking for it.
---
It will effect logins, yes, and that is its purpose. It will have only the smallest effect on concurrency (not zero, but tiny) but that isn't its purpose; CCP doesn't care about concurrency, they care about active subscriptions.
---
Yes your gameplay is to target ships that you hope:
---
A) don't have weapons
---
B) are either already under heavy fire or with 200 of you closest bomber buddies on a lone ship.
---
My mind trembles at the though of how good you must be at the game.
---
I agree with Jay. My biggest issue with this post is your definitions of umbrella vs. non-umbrella regions. That is where you can skew the data to prove whatever argument you make, and I think your methodology there is kind of subjective.
---
I am equally worried about losing players.
---
But it's nice to get the argument that defends "whatever CCP does it will help Panfam/Imperium/TEST more" out of the way.
---
To be fair, the last really good kill I had was in Vale. I was in a Stratios. I fought a Tengu and a Bhaalgorn in the first room of a 10/10, killed them both, made it out alive, then went back in to loot. I died to rats.
---
With a local, you know before you undock. That's the point you sad excuse for an Eve player. What part of that don't you understand? Local is the single one reason why bots could function in null. Is it so hard to d-scan or watch intel channels? I think you're just butthurt you can't multibox your farm of carebears while watching porn. Get a life.
---
Bring light drones in a myrm for l2s. 3s bring a flight of mediums. The dps from l3s is low, a single cap stable rep should be good.
---
Which means it wasn't taken out of context. That attitude is absolutely unacceptable in anyone.
---
Your posting history shows that we share quite opposite views on most anything. I campaigned for my views. If you voted for a person with the opposite of your views, you voted wrong.
---
PS: Stop metagaming it isn't working.
---
Way to go with the insults, toxic much? 
---
1. I make isk in wormhole space
---
2. Bots can function because CCP doesn't really give a fuck about them.
---
3. With blackout, people can log off for 10min and log back in, cloak and have free reign over a system, its a foolproof way of getting kills but 4. will put a dampener.
---
4. There are no longer many targets ratting or mining in nullsec to actually find and kill, so good luck with that one.
---
The funny thing is, CCP still has a really limited view of the data.
---
I'm subbed for a year on four accounts.  I still log in (for much less time now), but now just to reorganize market stuff in case all this idiocy gets revoked.  It's getting easier and easier for me to accept that I won't renew each account when it comes up - and one of them is just two months away.  Conversely, I have tons of alpha accounts I log in regularly to skill up, just in case all this idiocy gets revoked.  That too will stop when the subs are all done.  
---
So... their login numbers look a lot better now than they will a year down the road - barring changes.
---
What attitude? How do I have an unacceptable attitude when your buddies were insulting me?
---
i think the main point of the argument was that bigger orgs have a deeper knowledge bench and bigger think tanks to min/max shit faster and losing 10 people hurts them a lot less than &lt;300 people alliances etc
---
This is what CCP does, embark on a new adventure of bullshit, realise they done fucked up, pull the break, go silent, then slowly, ever so slowly, try and fix the shit they caused.
---
Yes but people making that point forget the other side, the mechanics actually work against bigger alliances; two of which I described in my OP.
---
Have you turned it off and on again?
---
That's the point - the status quo before benefited the small groups as much, if not more, than the large groups. Cyno alts were cheap and easy to produce. I had three, and I don't do jump freighter runs. They were just for my personal convenience. I never needed any of them.  A small group guy is not going to have access to safe cyno fleets like we did, and he's going to rely on his own alts or the handful of folks in his group that had those alts.  
---
Now, it's much, much harder to maintain those alts, and instead of costing less than 3 mil isk, they're going to cost him 300 million.  It is much, much more expensive - hence my calling it a tax on smaller alliances. A big alliance doesn't give a shit. I skill injected all my cyno alts into Rapiers, and I'm set.  Smaller guys don't have those resources. 
---
I mean, it's completely fair to say that the big guys will have different issues than the small guys, but those issues are also at scale. Our Titan pilot can much more easily replace his lost Titan than somebody in a smaller alliance. The result of that is the smaller guy isn't going to undock his big stuff.  
---
So he's not using his stuff, he can't move it around as easily, he has a much higher skill cost that he can't spread around to other people, and he's paying a premium for ships - that's all taking a giant dump on the heads of guys in smaller groups.
---
The fact that you believe you gracing someone with your presence is a favor to them. Full stop, that statement can never be justified regardless of any conversation in either side. If someone is insulting you, leave. But to think you are some great magical being that is doing them a favor by just being there? No. Never. Absolutely not. That is the worst narcissistic personality trait ever.
---
Unsubbing is fine, posting on reddit with PCU graphs and personal attacks on Hilmar is a tantrum.
---
It's a mouthful!
---
If I talk to someone despite their insults, yes it's a favor.
---
Highsec mining is 5m/hr?
---
Jesus. That was shitty isk 15 years ago when 90 days only cost 400 mil.
---
Again, this game isn't wow. Why don't you go ahead and be risk prone by playing wow ?
---
Or you know, go rat in null. Lol
---
So, I'm doing you a favor my responding to you despite the fact you are insulting me by expecting me to think you are worthy of more respect than an opinion piece on the internet? Is that how magical internet land works?
---
Afk hisec mining alone is pretty shitty.  Mining scales exponentially with more accounts.
---
&gt;No FRT person made the same claim to me anyway 
---
That’s because most of FRT doesn’t speak English
---
I am insulting you by what lol? Can you stretch more?
---
As long as cloaky/nulli t3s and bombers exist, ratting in subcaps will be suicidal. There’s no number of ratting myrms you can realistically form to fight off a Loki gang. And if you upgrade to dominixes, bombers will kick your shit in.
---
What is the next statistic Olmeca pumps out as proof his theories improve game health - a one week player count increase between 01:01-01:02 on Thursdays?
---
You got toxic first, don't bark little doggy if you're afraid of getting bit. 
---
1. I don't give a shit what you do. But explains a lot. Easy for wh people to probe out new whs and simple check the system with a cloaky then Hull rush in for kills. All makes sense now. You just want your selfish easy play style back. Pathetic. 
---
2. If you know anything about this game you know bots are hard to detect and easy to replace. The blackout fixed bots more than anything else did. 
---
3. Logoff with the blackout? You can do that anytime. Ever heard of login traps. Very useful way players had to abuse because with local and anyone docking up when danger flew in... or saw coming 10 jumps away. You can't be that stupid. 
---
4. I've played every night and kill targets or hear about them in intel. Every fucking night. Why is that? Maybe you're just really bad at Eve.
---
The sooner nullsec figures out the answer to the blackout is ratting in groups the happier they will be. A solo Myrm is vastly different than 5 Myrms to a tackler.
---
You can suck a single dick and get like 1.5 billion ISK, even if you're not a very expensive male prostitute. This seems desirable over sucking the dick of an entire standing fleet over and over when your miserable fucking t1 shitfit ratting Myrmidon gets tackled for the 50th time in one day by a solo Jaguar!  
---
Food for thought!
---
You don't seem to be following, wormholers scream HTFU at nullsec because of these changes, but these changes were made because they are cowards. So it turns out nullsec players are the ones who did HTFU but you guys cried hard enough to make the game easier for yourself.
---
i fucking wish
---
Ore saturation is one of the main problems the economy faces at the moment and is likely the primary cause of out of control capital proliferation right beside citadel spam.
---
So you joined defense fleets, went out on strat ops, and the like with those big groups? You were in comms and following an FC's instructions? You met your participation requirements?
---
Like when you stretch by stating you are discussing balance? The entirety of ALL of your conversation pieces are trying to convince people that these are good changes. It's not a discussion. It's a soap box and you spend your time telling people why it and you are the best choice and that is entirely self serving and when someone says otherwise you have the audacity to tell them you doing them a favor? No sir, you have a very skewed view of yourself and how these conversations play out.
---
Abyssals. Do it in a dead end hisec system, don’t overbling, and use an alpha alt to resupply and sell loot. Just jump your main up there when you need more money, rat, and then toss the loot to your alt and death clone back home. 
---
Wardeccers spend 99% of their time either in trade hubs or along popular routes. They will almost certainly not go checking every dead end hisec system looking for you
---
Why is posting on reddit not ok, are we not allowed to express concern over these things?
---
Except this happens naturally - Rorqual ore saturation decreases, followed by an increase in ore price. Congratulations, Rorqual mining is now worth significantly more than it was previously because half the retards with 10 Rorqs unsubbed and gloated about it on reddit.
---
The amount of people who think botting disappeared in null is hilarious. Is it less common? Yes but it's still there and it's still a problem. Bots still exist in null in numbers. How many posts have we seen of people showing off bot kills or how they use eyes on gates to tell if someone jumped in system? I guess all of that never happened. 
---
Also why do people think bots will stop just because they now get killed every few days? Even if they get killed every day they make a profit. The cheap myrm fit takes 7 ticks to break even with. So just over two hours. If you assume a bot runs 12 hours before switching accounts. They get just under 10 hours of ticks. In delve a myrm gets 12-14m ticks. Let's assume 11m ticks because bots sometimes are slow.  That's still over 300m isk in bounties per bot. Then you have salvage and loot which bot still absolutely do. https://zkillboard.com/character/2113842492/
---
How about a 25-40% increase in loot dropped from anomalies, as opposed to bounty payouts directly?
---
You been saying that for like two months now!
---
Small groups aren't as dependent on local cynoes (or capitals even) as large umbrellas. The differences in umbrella protection and the nerfs to unchecked moneymaking are more significant than whatever logistical point you can make or how hard you think it will be for them to move caps. Goons and test are alliances currently premised and modeled on low risk farm and huge relative safety. They will have to give up very strategic advantages when that's gone. This is exactly why they are so vocal about them too.
---
You will see. Cyno changes will turn out to be harder to cope for imperium / test / panfam.
---
Its a feature
---
Yes.
---
Wth?!?
---
I was talking balance on that discord and in that discussion in the screenshot. Didn't say I am talking balance now. Stretchy stretchy :)
---
implying it's literally not classic wow
---
Color me surprised.
---
in addition too too
---
they just need to incentivize people in risky situations
---
A new player also doesn’t realize that bigger != better 
---
It’s like that in practically every other game, so they assume it’s that way in Eve, and then look at the cost/time to get into capitals/HACs and quit
---
did you reply to the wrong thread orrrr
---
uhg semantic debates
---
Nah I'm just trolling because I know whenever someone asks me whether I have been a linemember that's a useless and loaded question which will end up telling me know I don't know things.
---
My background actually puts me a better position in matters of risk/reward. like how I even have to explain it's a really strong effect when an alliance grows larger more people go hunt in their space, and it matters a lot in the grand scheme of things.
---
Every alliance in nullsec has capitals.  Regardless of size.  Most have supercapitals.  Moving them around just got exponentially harder for those groups.  And since smaller groups tend to move more often than big groups, that's going to put them in a much more difficult situation than the big groups.  
---
Goons and TEST are able to do what they do because they can leverage economies of scale. Their space is still the safest, even after these changes. They still can respond the best, even after these changes.  The smaller guys, however, are more likely to fail and merge into the big groups because that's what happens when we make it harder for them to survive on their own.
---
Give me the 2013 rorq with off grid boosting and I’ll be happy.
---
Collected\*
---
So you are complaining that you weren't good enough to kill people before you fucked the game up? You are a fucking moron omeca. Go play wow and stop fucking eve up
---
I dont agree it has a that small of a effect. And its not even counting that people log their alphas as well during this time. And you are discounting the fact that the second event actually forced you to undock and kill things. There is no way you can say it didnt affect the concurrent number. I cant even count how many times during the event that I forgot to close all windows, or that I sat and played around with skills and so on. It most def affects it in a much larger manner than insignificant. 
---
There was also a post the other day from a guy that collects data and has been for a very long time. His graphs show high DAU peaks when events kick in meaning a lot of people that usually dont log in do it because of these events. Which is yet again the point of these events. 
---
CCP has always cared about the PCU, it is a KPI after all. But not the only one.
---
some people are being intentionally obtuse to try and further their viewpoint.
---
Because you fucking lie every time you open your weasel mouth
---
Cursed wreathe
---
Moving caps around is less of an issue compared to being able to generate wealth at peace. The latter is where the changes hit bigger alliances the more.
---
And their space will still be safest, but not relatively safer compared to the degree before. Again the reason here is the irrelevance and nonselectivity effects that you keep ignoring.
---
And most small alliances who wanted to merge already merged. We are already past that point. The least we can do now is to diminish safety under umbrellas even biting the bullet that it will diminish also a bit under small alliance space as well. At least content can be sustained this way. By making sure shit still dies in delve.
---
Because you fucked the game up, why would anyone go to war right now when you and ccp are screwing the game
---
well, who better to send than the top financiers of the game. people who make it their business to know the ins and outs of many aspects of eve.
---
&gt;Indy playstyle encourages purchasing additional accounts.
---
No, it encourages working collaboratively with other players. Purchasing multiple accounts is just a way to avoid having to do that.
---
&gt;Getting a lot of salt.
---
IME everyone that says that is being salty. You only prove this.
---
Dude, there is no point. They should most def be able to jump to them but this sub really doesnt want any good changes, they just want to hurt NS people. So does CCP.
---
Bull fucking shit
---
Im not here to fuck the game. I am here to fuck your game.
---
Max to have active at any time is 5 right?
---
Knew Merlin in Hotline. Beast of a man
---
username partially checks out
---
&gt;Trust me being at the hunting side gives one much more clarity.
---
Clearly not lmao
---
Is there a way to just have audio on one character? Love the sound but if I mute one, they all get muted :(
---
I heard it as I read it! Awesome movie!
---
This is the problem - it is a much larger impact to a smaller group player who wants to move around his ships than it is to a large group generating wealth at peace. Those groups have already started adapting. There's a reason why we're running large Rorq fleets in lowsec now.  
---
I'm ignoring the irrelevance and nonselectivity effects because those are largely on paper.  The folks who want to maximize their isk per hour and minimize their risk are leaving nullsec and moving to high sec. This includes the bots. But in the end, those are exactly the kinds of players the big groups didn't really want, so that's not hurting them in the long run. These groups would rather kick their freeloaders and lose some ratting or mining income, because in the end it's in their interests to have members who are dedicated to being part of the group - not folks with ratting alts who don't give a shit about being part of the larger culture. 
---
The phrase you're looking for is "collateral damage."
---
Lol facepalm calling people cowardly because the game was unbalanced by dropping carriers on solo frigates.
---
Dude seriously you're being very retarded. I don't use that word lightly.
---
With some planning (skills) you can have plenty of fun learning the game as Alpha, and upgrade once you can afford the sub. Grinding for plex really can lead to burnout.
---
Let me get this straight - your background as a hunter gives you a better idea about what life is like for a line member in a big null bloc than actually being a line member in a big bull bloc? 
---
If I had said something like that about wormholers because we killed HK's staging, I'd be getting death threats, lol. You're magical.
---
Although boring, PI is a low effort, huge profit margin.  Money while you sleep.    
---
Especially lucrative in wormholes if you/corp own it.  not so much in high, but low/null/wh, you can plex an account with PI alone.
---
fake news?
---
You can with multiple installs / multiple profiles. I tend to have audio on with all my accounts and just use the Inactive Client Muting with Master checked.
---
I don't think anyone is going to miss a babyback bitch like you, so go ahead an walk. All that fucking crybaby shit on the meta show demonstrated how much of a spergy little twat you really are. Kick rocks bitch
---
honestly, this would be fcking amazing, although the fighter nerfs seem a bit extreme, and the teher thing is kinda bullshit.
---
It's equivalent to a bronze star IIRC, without the fringe benefits.  Might be a good way to honor a family of a man who gave up his life to this country.
---
Olmeca definitely will have no idea how to respond to that, other than "trust me I know what I'm talking about"
---
blackout is fng bad m8
---
Those players that you think imperium and legacy doesn't want are the backbone of their mers and titan supremacy btw. They will mess things up and die under blackout, or they will have to give up capital farming. You don't understand that a minimal skill requirement has been put on the linemember now. It doesn't matter how big the alliance itself is, if the pilot messes up, like the init titan did. That's why these people are banned from ratting at least to begin with.
---
No wonder you've been crying like a little bitch about the changes.
---
CONGRATULATIONS you fucked up about 30k people game. How are you enjoying that 13k active users lots of targets for you, you rat fuck?
---
&gt;They provide the content we seek.
---
So basically ratters should be defenseless noobs that blops gangs can just farm.
---
Right what a healthy direction for the game.
---
day by day is irrelevant.
---
that's some shiity chemo
---
Don't do that to yourself. Work, get paid IRL and buy Plex. You will actually enjoy this game and won't be risk averse because of the extreme grind you have to go to just KEEP playing the game.
---
You know what those kinds of players are? They are bottom feeders - they get killed, suicide ganked etc, then they spill tears which attracts more sharks who then kill them more... Until you rage quit.
---
If you instead pay for Plex, then your losses are just a slight "ohh well..."
---
And guess what? You're more likely to go gank others and participate in what eve is about: PvP.
---
I know this because I was nullbear once. It was a terrible gameplay experience, even though I got promoted in my rather large alliance and all that.
---
It's just the entire null culture is so fucking terrible; nullbears are always whining and their leaders are always abusing them in one way or another.
---
All because the bears want to grind their way to sustaining their subscription. Smh
---
No, they aren't. They're not the ones who are doing response fleets and providing the caps for their umbrellas. That kind of dedication requires more than just putting a character into an alliance to make money to fund something else. 
---
None of us cared or even batted an eye when that guy died. He was well known for not docking up even when there were gangs next door to where he was. It was inevitable that he was going to get clipped. And as far as I know, he doesn't give a shit. He'd been yoloing that titan around all over the place.
---
My background as a hunter gives me clarity on gauging who will be under more risk after the changes, because I am the risk.
---
HTFU, bring friends, etc etc everything else wormholers scream at nullsec. If you don't want to fight goons don't go to their space, seems like a simple concept.
---
i mean maybe im not understanding your overall point (maybe you're referring specifically to bounty payouts or whatever) but obviously nullsec mining gets more lucrative the less people that are doing it. the only reason mineral prices have been so low over the past few years was because of the quantity of rorquals out mining.  
---
not only does bots moving to hisec hurt bots by significantly lowering the amount of income one account can pull in and making it exponentially easier to differentiate between nullsec autists and legitimate botters, it makes the return on those willing to actually do the rorqual mining's investment much more valuable.
---
maybe a buff is in order, but if you push the pendulum too far the reward becomes high enough that bots are willing to once again take the risk
---
Honestly, I fking love caps. But I would agree to it. Cause thats a change that atleast makes sense.
---
But we need to know who represents all the Chinese players! 
---
We must know this!!!. :P
---
But that's not the point I'm making. You're focusing solely on risk/reward, and not on all of the other variables that are mpacted here. You're assuming that people are rational and there's some kind of mathematical formula that folks use to decide if they are going to undock that day, and it's just not that simple. 
---
The average line member doesn't make his mind up about what he's doing based on that kind of analysis. I sure as hell don't, and I'm pretty average.
---
Nope. They are the ones helping regions like Delve hit critical mass with the umbrella and faxes, rendering regions immune to crowded dreadbombs. They do have alts to drop, and +1 to your wartime titan fleets.
---
There is more of them and less of you btw. Idk about fountain, but this is true at least in delve.
---
I like this.
---
I think it's because we didn't ban gigx fast enough. Prove ME WRONG!!
---
drones - yes. you need to train the skill to 5 to deploy them all at once. it's one of the most important skills to train to 5 since so many ships depend on you fielding the full flight of drones to be effective.
---
Just coming back myself and getting a few friends into the game, welcome back o7. From what I've heard nullsec has changed a lot with the blackout and all. We're spinning up a corp and plan to set up in WH space - you're welcome to join us if you like
---
Going from alpha to omega for the first time will be very difficult due to the said alpha restrictions. It's always advisable to buy the first omega with RL currency so that you don't burn out accumulating isk for the upgrade. Once you're omega, you can sustain by playing 10-14 hrs a week on average, make sure you're having fun along the way too.
---
Don't go the basic ratting/mining route. Try exploration, station trading, etc. If you want to rat/mine then find a group to rat in wormholes or mine R64 moons.
---
I am focusing on moneymaking risk, yes. If blackout proved anything it proved higher risk in a region reduces moneymaking in that region. Yes, people are rational that way.
---
I dont think the regular decline would affect that much since its a short term thing. But I also dont belive the majority of the "quitters" actually quit. Think they are genuinly bored with the game atm and have decided to do something else for now.
---
If things improve I think a lot would rejoin. But not all.
---
We are talking about two different types of players. The ones you are describing are good members, not the parasites. The ones I'm talking about are the ones who make their money, do not contribute to anything else, usually because they're alts for folks doing other things in other areas. 
---
Those are the characters nobody is going to be sad seeing going back to high sec. They contributed nothing anyway.
---
you're right, but I'm of a different mindset- I don't directly see an issue of bots as long as they're just as killable- or more killable- than actual players. The biggest issue with botting in nullsec is that the bots were effectively impossible to kill outside of poor coding which was quickly fixed. I also had an issue with local making any attentive player also unkillable. As long as bots are killable, there will be people out there hunting them consistently as they operate in a consistent manner, and without local their safety net is gone.
---
Players have a safety net that bots don't, and that's cooperation and communication.
---
I don't think nullsec bots will ever become popular again as long as blackout exists, because of a couple of factors, mainly the way CCP detects bots in the first place. VNI bots are so hard to detect because they have so few inputs- which means bots are effectively relegated to drone boats, of which the most cost efficient are ones that speed tank and can't instant warp out, therefore reliably catchable by hunters.
---
Null has no instant local now. Cynos can only be fit to BLOPS and Force Recons. People saying Eve is dying still. N+1 still supreme
---
Haven't you heard? Eve is dying... don't come back now. LOL
---
Sorry, just an inside joke between me and some salty Eve players. But please, come see the excitement of the chaos era!
---
assuming you're in space and not in a citadel -  
---
if your carrier is full of all your shit - you're going to have to leg it to the nearest freeport citadel OR npc station. if you hit a station first, pushx all the valuable shit to jita and insure/self destruct the carrier after you strip the fit. you'll lose like... a few  hundred mil. Worth.  
---
if you get to a freeport first, asset safety everything, including the carrier. resell the carrier on  regional market wherever it ends up for a good deal and ship the rest back to jita.  
---
if you dont have shit in th ecarrier, make the call whether you wanna try and get it out or just say fuck it and self  destruct. keep  in mind cynos are a pain in the ass  now for carriers, and require a recon or black ops alt.
---
No. This is the second time this retarded idea popped up this week. 
---
I say this as I'm in a Rorq mining.
---
Real spreadsheet warrior wins again
---
Welp, paying for this isn't an option. R$44.00 monthly is too much soo... yeah.
---
My distinction isn't between parasites and contributors. It is between those who won't manage to survive under changes and those who will. Now parasites correlate with the former group, but the former group is wider.
---
Far less important....to you. 
---
There is more to the decision-making processes for these players than just moneymaking risk.  The problem with the blackout is that it wasn't just higher risk that it brought - those are the variables you're missing.
---
Bad investment. At this rate salt is going to become a post-scarcity commodity.
---
Oh good, then you just made the argument against ccp ever listening to carebears
---
First mentioned in 2003. It's been dying ever since lol
---
2003 actually
---
&gt;People saying Eve is dying still.
---
Now with eXcItInG gRaPhS!
---
Nope. Moneymaking is objectively more important to most people. It is obviously true that people care about wealth generation to the degree that you are seeing huge pcu reductions when it is impaired, and those reductions don't happen only outside delve, esoteria etc
---
The problem is that parasites are going to self select themselves out of the picture. So they're absolutely going to survive because they're going to be running missions in high sec.  The contributors will not be as impacted because their alliances will take steps to make sure that they have a chance to survive that as good as what it was before. 
---
Why? Because their players are going to demand it.  Otherwise, they're going to leave.  So in a month, this new meta will be chewed and digested, and the big alliances will have shit out the solution and the only thing that will have changed is the PCU.
---
Yet. Imperium continues to grow. Goons and Iniative continue to increase numbers as people flock to the safest entities in null. 
---
If you and your family or way to make a living is threatened what do you do? You cannot stop basic human behaviours occur. Continue down this trend and you have 3 null entities left with a few medium to small groups scattered in eve. With fewer players overall. 
---
I expect the value kills and numbers of kills to be the next thing to start dropping as people leave game and content continues to dry up.
---
Finally an honest and productive answer.
---

Sure, sounds fun! Jspace is new to me but I'm willing to take the deep dive.

---
Without old cynoes alliances can't do much about contributors with low knowledge and skill levels. Just like they couldn't do much when I was stealing excavators. At some point survival now boils down to individuals not alliances. And because of that, alliances historically recruiting people with lower skill and knowledge and those who crammed so many people will have worse impacts.
---
Again "why don't you just not play here!?"
---
No, buddy, why don't you go away instead? Ccp isn't going to give you immunity from us. 
---
Try fighting us with subcaps.
---
You speak of numbers - isn't that what null is known for? Bring those subcaps.
---
What's the word? Coward, was it?
---
But even if everyone moves to delve now we at least have a sufficient level of farm converting to killmails. People can choose to blob up and have no wars for sov. But at least they will keep losing ships.
---
You're going to make $44 dollars worth of subscription by grinding for hours and hours and hours, instead of just doing a job for, like, 3 hours?
---
*Shrug* you'll rage quit when you lose everything because that time you spent will burn in your heart because you got nothing for it.
---
Don't do this to yourself. I'm telling you I went through this. It sucks. Game isn't meant to be played by grinding. Don't become the prey.
---
There's more to it than just the moneymaking. One of the things the blackout has done is made space feel more lonely. People don't like that feeling, and they are responding to it by not logging in. That's nothing to do with moneymaking.
---
This is an intergalactic quality shitpost. Well done, 7o
---
BuT mUh PcU!
---
Starting from scratch and not much knowledge you will need probably 6 months before you can make enough to buy a 1 month sub with isk. The free to play state called alpha, you can actually do quite a fair bit of things over time. 
---
Is the conversion rate something ridiculous like a 1 week salary to pay for it? I know the US is "wealthy" but 1 months sub for $15 usd would take about 1 or 2 hours of working at a job depending on some things. How many hours at work would it take for you to pay for 1 months?
---
He was killed due to terrorism, which by definition is to affect political change through violence. Many have died to terrorism since, but he should still be remembered by his friends.
---
I tend to agree, at least for myself. For null-sec, I think the critical aspect is not just war, but a war that can be won against even the biggest coalition in the game without people scratching their own eyes out with the endless tedium of structure bashing and sov warfare. Let alone dealing with the immense number of all powerful super-capitals.
---
I truly admire the Imperium for their accomplishment after WWB. In many ways, the achievement of such an integrated empire deserves to stand. But with Legacy, they are unassailable (probably even without Legacy). The game has in fact, been won.
---
EvE attracted me and many others for the huge battles that actually meant something. Now that era is, I think, long past. I can't see how it can be regained without severe impacts -possibly terminal in themselves. Cleverer and more experienced people than I may have some ideas, but I don't think the blackout or a few more hunting opportunities or the odd border clash will retain much enthusiasm from veterans and new players alike. There has to be something at stake, in my view. EvE was always about the risk of losing everything (well, it was the most interesting aspect to me).
---
Perhaps the easiest win in the meantime would be to sort out Faction War. That too benefits from having something at stake, something I feel citadels took away. Personally, I'd like to see low-sec free of any ship class bigger than a battleship - the big beasts ought to be restricted to null-sec if we are to have them at all. FW might be a much easier problem to solve as the null-sec empires are not so invested and sub-cap war is a much easier entry point for new players.
---
Where we are now is the natural result of Monty Haul-style design choices married with predictable human motivations working to create ever bigger and safer groups - over a sixteen year period. 
---
Maybe all games inevitably tend to stasis and death, and EvE has just had its innings.
---
Cool, added ya
---
Yes, totally. If I ever grow a pair of balls I’ll post a rant about all the wonderful cool things they coulda done with WiS. The possibilities were endless. Endless!-but part of CCP’s biggest problems is it’s dogged adherence to ideology.... and a lack of imagination
---
Not really, HAM Loki is the best hunter by a long margin. Proteus is turbogarbage for everything except cyno (rest in peace) and fast warp smartbomber in lowsec.
---
Yeah I just whore on kill with a painting Vigil. Doesnt cost me anything
---
Is that like a pre-alpha with full AAA art assets?
---
Oh I am pretty sure CCP can implement constellation chat without standings showing and the pcu drop would not recoup. Loneliness is an effect. It is not nearly as consequential as moneymaking being nerfed though.
---
I'm not sure you understand what "exponentially" means.
---
You are correct, I meant linearly.
---
jibrish
---
That's a terrible idea m8. This game is based on p2p interaction. Every ship is created by a player, as are many modules and ammo. Buying a ship outright with isk would be insanely irresponsible. Imagine buying a titan or fleet of titans immediately a few hundred billion isk. No more 8 weeks of waiting for each hull to cook. Insane.
---
Please elaborate on the trading tower? I am curious as its saving me hundreds of million isk in fees.
---
I won't, i'll probably play something else.
---
My country economy is in shambles and i haven't been able to get a job 2 years after graduation ... i literally can not pay/work for it. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
@pandemichorde
---
Great! Thanks. Wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. I have Drones at 5, but wanted to be sure there wasn't either a ship trait or an 'Advanced Drone Management' skill I'd missed that allowed more.
---
What should I put in the upper slots? The T1 Drone Augmenters seem to only do range? In the lower slots, I can fit damage but it looks like they compete with Armour Tank mods down there. Should I fit some actual guns? Maybe a command module?
---
More PvP, less krabs.
---
Call of Duty 4, join FF server with high explosives perk and RPG. Aim at ground and wait for round to start, watch entire team disappear.
---
So glorious.
---
Tsk, that sucks. Good luck job hunting
---
Do you mean should it? Probably. 
---
If you mean does it, then no. The k162 side spawns when you initiate warp, but only becomes a scannable signature when either you jump the hole, or on an increasing % chance once the hole goes before 15 hours of its maximum life remaining. Until that point while it is there, you can only get to it if a drifter warps to it and you combat probe the drifter.
---
Summer is killing eve
---
Doesn't matter much, the threat is someone rolling into you rather than your own static as you could just backstop your own static like is done during evictions.
---
Omg i love you
---
bring back the gong, eve is fixed, ur welcome
---
He was killed because US has decided to overthrow the government of a country, plunging it into endless civil war allowing various armed groups to flourish. For many people outside of US his death is a symbol of karma slamming US right in the face.
---
Not really now it's limited to one per ship
---
&gt;  Do you mean should it?  
---
ye, topic title is a suggestion
---
Why do we have to bring subcaps? Because you cried so much that you roamed into someones home and they brought everything they could to stop you.
---
You call me the coward but how many ratters or miners have you killed? How many ships that won't fight back have you attacked?
---
Take another upvote for quality shitposting. Love it.
---
Man, I can't wait until commericals on TV is the norm again.
---
Thanks Disney and Hulu.
---
Think youre missing the sarcasm mate.
---
No you must keep the agent above -2.
---
The 5 min invincible button only useable in a mining situation
---
Player wallets and plex vaults cannot be touched by other players.
---
😈😈😈
---
It's a sign
---
Yeah, the bots are suffering, too - that's the only silver lining to all of this.
---
I suspect that the actual numbers aren't THAT low, though; it's to be expected that the blackout would make bot detection more difficult, so CCP is likely recognizing a smaller portion of the game's botting income as such.
---
Then again, it's possible I'm wrong - maybe, for some reason, bots were almost entirely dependent on local and it's virtually impossible for them to pull data from overview, dscan, or the map, so they just quit when the blackout hit. 
---
The latter scenario seems pretty unlikely, though - the bots still have access to all of the tools that legitimate players have, and I doubt they're having THAT much difficulty using them.
---
Hey if that’s how you like to play then go formit. But I enjoy being a part of a fleet and useful. But I also don’t fly in big blocs.
---
&gt;You call me the coward but how many ratters or miners have you killed? How many ships that won't fight back have you attacked?
---
Lots. That's why I play the game.
---
Am I mass murderer in eve? Sure. 
---
But hey, it's not just miners. Recently I killed a capital with my friends too. Just, 20 vs 1..
---
It was glorious. I posted it on Reddit, got 100 upvotes too.
---
Game is fucking going great!
---
&gt;Why do we have to bring subcaps? Because you cried so much that you roamed into someones home and they brought everything they could to stop you.
---
Dropping several caps on one frigate was killing the game. You seen totally unable to deal with that fact, like a tree stump. :P
---
Plus, you don't have to fight. Just be there and take it like the non coward you imply you are LMAO
---
This should be pinned
---
Thanks for the help!
---
The end is nigh!
---
You havent debunked shit. Youve used flawed data to make a point that everyone already knew you had. If you were even one bit objective maybe people would actually give a shit about your analysis. But as it stands I dont even bother to check your results or data because I know its coming from you. And I think many others feel the same way.
---
Especially when you cherrypick data like youve done. You are ignoring FRT which has one of the biggest superfleets in their TZ stating "they dont matter". You are forgetting that Legacy helps eachother meaning TEST superfleets get called in from time to time. Locust fleets and the longest moon mining cycles. And so on.
---
Its just flawed work. And its not just your fault, I doubt this calculation can even be made. 
---
Worst part Olmeca, I dont belive you to be an idiot. Your use of logic isnt flawed but your knowledge of certain things and your utter bias sinks your credibility. Which is honestly sad cause with your energy you could have helped the game grow, in an alternate reaility. In this one you seem hellbent on killing the game just because you dislike a certain playstyle. Its just sad.
---
I feel you kind of contradicted yourself here with what these changes are expecting to achieve. So its ok for one big blob null sec as long as you get content despite what might be best outlook for game. So you are arguing for change that suits your style of play and to hell with everybody else, despite many metrics not being too kind to the games current trajectory and future? 
---
As for the hope this is going to change too much in delve, I beleive them pesky goons will provide a solution to the problem cause thats what them goonies do and is likely already preparing for that.
---
Dont forget about LS umbrellas as well, and WC and SP.
---
Ill give you that point Globby. I would point out though that since were taking away intel how about we take it away from both sides. Then we can see which side wins the fight because right now one side is fighting with one hand tide and the other gets to use both. I live in NPC Null so I'm not part of a Sov alliance and honestly if they just used a true delayed local such as 1-2 minutes after arriving in system, that would be fair to both sides.  I don't know how hard that would be to do and the amount of time could be even up to 5 minutes if it really needed to be. I do not claim to be all knowing about the game but as a player in NPC Null I'm tired of playing for hours ratting or exploration in ships that would be at least a fight for most of the leet PVP  crowd I see to be jumped on the minute I go to haul my PI or do some transport in my home system from refine to factory. I'm still here though and not going anywhere.
---
do you have any ideas how to blitz Silence the Informant?
---
Yeah but it's about whose been damaged, is it the person multiboxing rorqs or the myrm pilot just trying to afford ships to fly but has no chance to defend himself.
---
&gt; Of course most sane people have no will to put up with that.
---
Hey... do you even play this game? If you did you'd know that "sane people" and "eve players" are mutually exclusive descriptors.
---
If Eve was in a good state people wouldn't leaving to play another game.
---
You literally report everyone you dont agree with though
---
Eve is dying... finally. 
---
Game's a shitshow, with CCP Devs being pants-on-head retarded with their trigger fingers.
---
Eve is getting leaner and stronger. Lots of room to grow. Nowhere to go but up.
---
They are probably trying to poach you
---
wat
---
More upvotes than Eve players!
---
Ah yes
---
The days when frigates didn’t do 600 dps
---
Everywhere is like j-space now.
---
Why tho
---
Well.  For your target alliance that you clearly and definitely aren’t trying to awox or worse from the inside
---
Join, start setting up market supply yourself for important items like doctrine ships, fuel blocks, and other needed crap.  Be the go-to and show you know your stuff as you start to help take the burden off the logistics leaders who will gladly take the help when provided (by having fuel and items premade and seeded)
---
Over time get rights to drop fuel into structures and help manage those, building until you eventually are helping supply a chunk of the alliance region and managing imports/exports
---
Once you get enough trust, push for citadel rights and unanchor everything
---
“By destroying the community, they will realize it can’t get any worse and thus it’ll only get better!”
---
What, is CCP a bond villain or some shit?
---
someone correct me if I am wrong here, but if he uses refferal link , is using ingame plex enough to get the reward for the player who provided the link? If that still applies, hit me up ;)
---
The cyno changes is aids for basically everyone that uses cynos big or small, the only people that benefit are.. yep you guessed it.. hunters like literally every cHaOs change.
---
Instead of looking to improve the overall game in areas that benefit everyone the only stuff getting changed is at the benefit of only hunters.
---
Reed over here playing in game market and real market!
---
A large part of the "chaos era" driver is fighting inflation.  Increasing raw isk from sites would defeat the purpose.
---
Funny man.
---
Gotta admit though, it's interesting music.
---
remove insurance altogether to combat inflation
---
Miss you bro!
---
Thank you !
---
Trust is the hardest thing to achieve in Eve. Lessons have been learned for 16 years, and for you to pull off anything, you'll have to dedicate a lot of time. With that said, there's probably 1000's of players who currently have enough access to single handedly destroy alliances or corps.
---
The numbers disagree with you. 3 months subs are running out next week. Eve will be under 10k active users by October
---
&gt;how about we take it away from both sides.
---
yes, I agree. Obscuring it to a constellation or regional level on the ingame map and API would be better. You want people to be able to get some sense of where people are and what they're doing, rather than none.
---
&gt;delayed local
---
how about no local forever? local is a cancer to the risk/reward and small gang groups in eve.
---
&gt;leet PVP crowd
---
The issue is that the experienced players have figured out ways to do things relatively safely, and it's only the newer players that some mechanics fuck over. For example: ganking. It's close to impossible to lose a ship hauling cargo in highsec if you choose your ship type properly and scout, but newer players can't access that height level and may not even know it exists.
---
That being said, there is a certain level of 'git good' that must be achieved before someone is able to achieve total safety. There was no 'git good' in local existing, it was an easily accessible perfect intel system that horribly skewed risk/reward in eve since it came out.
---
There needs to be a balance, there can't be ways to do things in such absurd safety, likewise there needs to be something people can do against attackers. In my opinion, defenders have ample tools to combat hunters in their space, and small groups frequently have no issue with roamers in their space, it's the anti-social and non-communicative types that do.
---
eve has been bad since 2013, not since blackout lmao.
---
"after CO2 broke some NIP"? If you were there by that time TEST members were as surprised as CO2 when TEST leadership decided to flip on us because aparently they signed a secret defense agreement with the DRF while we were at war with them.
---
Just an excuse to get closer to the superpower the DRF was (absorbing XIX/Razor/stuff in the end) and one less barrier to get closer to the imperium, which as time has confirmed, was their main objective.
---
This is the comment I was looking for.
---
This seriously needs to be on it's own opening thread.
---
So gooms over powering you is killing the game, but you overpowering your target is OK? Do you understand the cognitive dissonance here?
---
Sounds like you are just mad you can't get free kills.
---
This probably isn't an option for them as they chose to develop on a game engine instead of a normal app framework.
---
Read up on the Triglavian invasion, the new Triglavian ships, and abyssal space
---
I 100% agree on that point.  I'd like to see it replaced with an in game support for SRP.  Loss mails could be placed into a queue, and people with roles could determine if a value should be paid out of the corp wallet.  This would allow for higher bounty payouts too, and allow isk faucets to be moved to other areas.
---
Well statistically speaking it started to decline in 2013
---
I've gotten sick and tired of hearing from people 10 minutes after downtime complaining about how the PCU is lower than yesterday.  
---
I've considered quitting eve just to stop hearing it.
---
I'm going to sit back and enjoy the ride, keep playing like I already do and adjust my tactics to match.
---
This makes me happy and gives me a bit of hope. Thank you.
---
Eve is dying since 2003™ and it will keep doing it for times xP
---
Lol no. There's literally zero bargaining power at the moment on the side of null empires. It hasn't been a week of cyno changes and you already want to make deals. Just have a response fleet lol. Holy shit how hard is this to get? CCP wants you to start playing together for the SAME ISK you were printing before solo with your finger on the Ping button to drop a bunch of supers.
---
Response fleet???.????????
---
Machariel does it fast. Thing is it drops elite drone ai so the mission itself is worth about 50 mil after lp bounties and ais. Actually prices of the ai changed so idk how much they're worth now.
---
DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED  DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED  DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED  DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED  DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED  DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED  DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED  DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED  DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED  DOCKING PERMISSION REQUESTED
---
That's happening to you only because you don't even try to have a response fleet which is your main advantage over a bot! Your ability to communicate with people and react to threats. You are literary the problem here because you reduce your gameplay to something a bot is better at. 
---
Also it's probably not true that bots are affected less by blackout since they have a profitability point beyond which it's no longer profitable to run them in null compared to moving them to high sec which is something we've been seeing. Reduced profitability of bots is still a positive even if doesn't fix the issue entirely.
---
It was ambiguously worded. It can be interpreted as "is this the current mechanics?"
---
r/wallstreetbets
---
..... ...... ..... .... this is fine ....
---
you can make triple of what ye olde vni ratters made doing burners in highsec shittily
---
That's the excuse I heard at the time yes. TEST promised some region to CO2 then they signed a deal with someone else to protect that region. CO2 went invadey on said region and TEST had a vote to kick them out of Legacy which CO2 tried to spin as a betrayal of some kind.
---
out of game reimbursement request shit is so much better than any ingame tool ccp could make, so no need
---
Yep, sorry.  
---
I cannot edit topic name :(
---
CCP have said they never intended for null to be as safe as this for people without support. This should be crystal clear they don't want you to stop making money they want you to have to play together for it instead of solo with the finger on the ping button to drop a bunch of supers.
---
You may have a valid point, but there’s this thing called tact.
---
I don't see the problem. You have now 2 options, drop your SUBs on the beacon or offgrid cyno and warp in.
---
Or you sacrifice a few recons to drop the capital hammer.
---
Sounds fair to me. A decent price tag on dropping the hammer on fucking everything.
---
Is that a sarcastic post? How is it not fair that an entire category of people in the game is making more money than a single null region. Also, that's only because nullsec is throwing a tantrum right now over not being able to print isk while watching Netflix spinning 4 VNIs.
---
Bruh you only count the time killing rats, not the time spending scanning down chains importing stuff exporting stuff etc. /s
---
## bruh 💪💪💯👌🙌
---
Frankly the idea of CCP messing with wormhole code is scarier than not having local could ever be...

Every agent has a slightly different set of missions they give you. I din't know why the person there did not add Silence the informant to the set of good missions (maybe his favourite agent doesn't give him that one). Anyways, just play around a bit! Find out for yourself which missions are worthwhile for you and which not. Start to decline the worst in your eyes and see if you standings stay good enough. If so decline more.
---
You're a great bot XD
---
Yeah. Some people here Catch into that type of history or Fountain into that type of history.
---
people are crying because its not as safe to pve anymore in nullsec and nothing else, essentially its an income nerf where it has introduced a lot more risk with the same payout.
---
That depends. Did you fill out one of those 5 question facebook quizzes saying which condition you probably have? Because if so, the answer is yes
---
I was actually checking out that old thread of the *EVE* player checking out *Ark* earlier today. Quite an entertaining read. Please do something like that.
---
I don't think you know what a game engine is.
---
Of course
---
Gotta git gud or lose that ISKIES
---
SG uses unity. Which EVE doesn't. And doesn't own.
---
He's mostly commenting on the backout not the cyno changes. However it should be pretty obvious to anyone that the cyno changes will hit the guys using cynos the most, not the ones using them the least. 
---
It's harder to drop supers if you're a single super ratting.
---
It's harder to drop supers if you're a single rorq and not an organized group of rorqs. 
---
The cyno changes basically mean null empires will have to have people organise more to have the same result as before which is a net positive. Anything that makes it hard to be printing money solo with your finger on the ping button to drop supers is a good change. 
---
Obviously this means it's harder for small groups to drop supers to save rorqs/crabbing supers but what small groups are rorq mining or super ratting?
---
My ISK per lost value is about 10-20%  more Made then lost.
---
It's because WoW came out on 2004 and everyone forgot what made MUDs great.  It wasn't killing six snow meese over and over again.
---
WoW has good raiding that beat everything that came before it, but the rest of the game is kind of shit.  Our standards for gameplay and combat have gone up in a dozen years and every mmo since has just been a worse clone of WoW.
---
There's a shitton of room in the MMO/MUD genre as soon as people get away from the WoW template.  I can make half a dozen easy suggestions if needed.
---
This is the best answer. Don't forget to follow through the last step for best results

You can sell them in Jita, 460M /unit.

It's not an inside joke, it's been a beat to death meme for literally a decade.
---
Frat absolutely has an umbrella.  For "defending rorquals" purposes it's every bit as strong as TEST or Goons.
---
When you get into the major battles over things like keepstars there *might* be a gap, but even then it largely depends on timezone and the situation.
---
Remember, Frat did more botting in their short history than most other alliances over 15 years.
---
I'll work on my thetan levels then :(
---
Honestly it depends on what you plan on doing. It could be a fort, it could be a mobile depot
---
&gt; But they go to CSM less if the problem area or the proposed change is controversial, and if there is playstyle conflicts of interest at play.
---
Yeah, this makes literally *perfect* sense to me. One of the issues CCP has to deal with is being yanked in so many different directions at once by the community's demands and trying to satisfy as many of them as possible. If I were in their position I'd either ragequit or start chewing pieces off of myself from the stress. &gt;_&lt;
---
And nothing about what makes it engaging or entertaining has to do with story?
---
I'm not sure if we play the same game... But once a "real capfight" breaks out when I was there, the relevance of subcaps was down to dictors.
---
Btw: when I talk about "underdogs" I meant inferior caps, not necessarily numbers. If you are heavily outnumbered, you can only win by pissing off the opponent by annoying hit-n-run tactics. And I honestly don't really know ANY way how that could be changed.
---
T3 destroyers have mostly been replaced with Assault Frigates, because changing to tank mode is too hard.
---
And you couldnt even do that right lol. 
---
You just missed at the end of your post "the numbers are risen" for finish the joke..
---
I was thinking about this the other day - if it was possible to buy up and move all the high turnover items and materials to somewhere else (that was relatively close) then you might stand a chance. The reason Jita is successful is because it's the only place you can reliably buy any item at a competitive price.
---
With the changes to how NPC tax works, it's kind of possible that it eventually might become a different (player owned) structure.
---
Retard! Retard!
---
How long do triglavian invasions persist? Are they gone after downtime? Do they persist until players reconquer the system?
---
God I miss the ingame browser...  so many memes, so much nsfw, and the ability to gamble your isk away while mining.
---
Those were the days.
---
You cant reason with empire builders ~ they were long due for a nerf and they still need to suffer. Any change that makes a goon mad is good for the game
---
You can scan them with combat probes
---
Lol i think eve is dying from the prospective that boting is difficult and lots of botters died and banned, lots of small cyno alts died no one cares abt svipul , ppl loosing their loki now more than ever, new eve mobile app , 2 big wars ,  big wh corps evicting small wh ppl, a lot of graphic changes ohh i forgot null blackout
---
Have you heard about our lord and svaiour: Ansiblex jump gates!
---
 Jesus dude do you even think for a second about your responses? 
---
Legacy as an example can cross 3 entire regions in 10 jumps.
---
Again:  
---
You see those camps as a burden, a hindrance.
---
I see content! But only if people are willing to stop krabbing and do some pvp.
---
Do player base gets smaller, but the actual devoted players stick around? Could be worse.
---
Everyone i know has a training pod since you can switch pods in citadels.
---
And from my experience every new player knows about attribute implants.

Netflix killed marvel shows which they could have milked for 10 years till actors wanted to leave, to harm disney. meanwhile that means that disney can employ all the actors in their million other shows, then when 2 years are over they continue these marvel shows. or not but yeah
---
then it came out that netflix kills most shows after 3 seasons, so good luck getting people to give a show for whats basically 30 episode run at best knowing that you cannot sell your show after 3 seasons elsewhere and also netflix takes world wide rights and pays terrible residuals unlike syndication pay for actors they can retire on from standard tv networks.
---
get as syndication shares on something like cbs show that run for 5 seasons and you are set for life
---
Totally this!
---
Yeah lets put jumpgates in lowsec, highsec, or enemy space.
---
Yeah lets make it so literally nobody but the super big blue donuts can move anywhere in space.
---
You see content, in what way? Walk me through how a camp in a random system 20+ jumps away from staging an hour before fleet is content.
---
It's possible to do it if you know a lot about the game. As a newbie who have no clue about the in-game economy, it's not easy. If you want to make it, you should read a lot of stuff on the internet about every aspect of EVE to discover business oppurtunities. Blogs, forums, statistics, industry stuff, etc. It's interesting if you want to do that, but it will take a lot of time and effort, and also in the beginning, 80% of your "game time" would be reading stuff on internet and not playing the game.
---
Time needed to kill the ratter is few times shorter for response party to undock and jump to next system. 
---
Not even considering the fact that they need to first form.         
---
EVE have significant issue with power creep.           
---
Initially you roamed in faction/t2 cruisers , you had 300-400 dps on them.    
---
Now people have more agile, faster and more tanked destroyers that can do 700-800 dps.
---
I just want to say, the death of my Aeon there could of gone to better music... all in all that was a fun day, though this vid is a bit late
---
It s designed to be a vicious circle, play to plex to play to plex, if you know what I mean.
---
After that long most people go native and have loyalties to their targets so it doesn't happen.
---
Yeah no shit. If you run a corp or alliance you can destroy it.
---
I agree people with devotion will find a workaround to all the things eve throw wt them, its a game they love . I agree there is a limit but eve was suppose to be dangerous , blackout rite now is a little much as it makes it kinda like wh rest i dont mind all the changes
---
You don't need nullification in highsec or lowsec!
---
As system 20+ jumps from staging that you can´t avoid at all sounds like enemy sapce. And enemy space 
---
SHOULD BE A DANGEROUS PLACE to travel in.
---
to answer the question in the title, yes it does.
---
Camp a gate instead.
---
Best Soundboard ever!!!!
---
Sure but every space that you don't own is enemy space.
---
And I absolutely disagree that enemy space shouldn't be dangerous to strictly travel through. It should be dangerous to bring a fleet with teeth through, but nowhere should be dangerous to just *travel* through.
---
&gt; you usually approach it so that the agent standings stays high enough to have access to lvl 4s but you let the corp and faction standing go down to nearly -2.
---
The opposite.
---
also I talked to anize and he considers the mission is just not worth it.
---
Remember it's not just the bounty that's interesting, it's the ratio isk / time. And for that, the mission is bad. Silence the Informant requires to clean two pockets before killing the informant, and while 50M may look good in this time you can do 3-4 burners, each valued 30M isk.
---
nope. My advice is : get an alt with standings high enough. when you go down, ask the alt to request the agent the next mission, and he shares the reward.
---
Eve uni wiki is a great resource, as is there alliance. You will earn more money down in null sec with a new bro alliance like pandemic horde. No matter which one you pick it will be a pain to get 1.8 billion, with out burning out on the game.

---
~sheets don't lie~
---
Well I dont know exactly which types you are talking about but dictors need to be killed so sub cap presence is always needed. If youre talking about defensive measures then mostly no, subs arent needed. But ive never seen an offensive drop without a subcap presence in some form. Ofc what and how much is situational. 
---
Ah. I dont think it can. And it shouldnt either.
---
I don't mind people with views opposite to mine. In fact, I consider healthy to have people with varied perspectives on advisory committees like the CSM. That's why I included various people, like yourself, in my selection, even tho I don't agree with most of your opinions. To try and balance it out.
---
What I consider unhealthy, however, is when people in such positions (or even in general) refuse to admit errors, and not only that but stubbornly continue to advocate for them, dismissing any opposition as uninformed or whiny. Even going so far as to cherry-pick data in an attempt to hide the reality of the situation.
---
There's nothing worse than somebody in power that's unwilling to consider that they may be wrong. And you've proven to be such a person.
---
Well, thats why you and CCP are in the dark about why so many are leaving.
---
That's what I thought.
---
 good on you for mining o7
---
Each sentence this gets dumber
---
Then stop mining and import compressed ore.
---
You should enjoy the game, not hate it.
---
Yes, for sure they increased the risk but left the reward the same and it'snow too close to that of highsec for most people to be interested in doing it. Time to up the pay for the people risking ships.
---
The thing I really like about this game is everyone plays their 'role' even if they'd never even consider traditional role playing, IMHO it is definitely the MMORPG with the most 'RPG' in it despite it not really seeming like that on the surface.
---
massive thanks for the helpful info! haven't seen this Blitzing doc before.
---
People kill miners because they’re too shit to PVP against things that could legitimately fight back.
---
Astrahaus - if you can't afford one, day trip until you can - it shouldn't take that long...
---
I think you are just jelous of some big alliances work. Someone did a great job working day&amp;night to rebuild an Empire and now CCP is killing all their effort.
---
You are probably one of those lazy people watching others cloaked 150km off on multiple accounts.
---
&gt;There are no manifestos pinned to the front door of CCP.  
---
Perhaps it is time the CSM does exactly this. Player logins are failscading into the abyss (no pun intended) at the moment
---
Please don't feed the retard/troll.
---
Let him die.
---
That is my regular playstyle.
---
I like every change that force nullbears to leave null sec. They have a place in game: high-sec. Null sec should be a place where people with balls live, not the carebears.
---
Miner, calm down.
---
But I don't hear the loud bang and smoke alarm.
---
&gt;Give Blockade Runners an ability to jump to covert cynos (or introduce a new T2 Industrial ship that can do that)
---
I agree with that. It's just a ridiculous hassle and requirement for ppl that want to jump small valuable stuff around to have a third char with Blackops skills. Make Blockade Runners more expensive and give them a very expensive jumpdrive so it only gets used if it really has to.
---
&gt;Give us deployable cynos (60 seconds onlining time, no more than 50k ehp)
---
My first reaction was "why the hell would you need that?". But thinking about it, i think i like the idea. It helps solo players jump stuff around without having a second account at the risk of jumping into a roam that saw your deployable and decided to wait for something to come through.

As per my understanding the easiest way to plex is simple : exploring relic sites in wh. But its very much based on luck .
---
Remain in hs or lownsec or null sec , set a random destination . Not close to the main huns ofcourse and start scanning find wh , get into wh scan and find relic sites . If u find one good try to hack it . Then come back and move to next system and scan, (if u have loot always leep it in hs system and then go into wh)
---
It can give u anything from 5 mill to 100 mill per site normally varying close to 20 mill and if u are able to do 5 sites a days then u can plex ur account eqsily withing the month. 
---
The investment is very low like 2 mill ship fully fitted and returns are very good. 
---
Though the knowledge needed to successfully pull of will be depending on u.
---
1. U need to know the dscan mechanics and spam it as if ur life depends on it cause ur an alpha and u dont have cloak
---
2. U need to know bookmarking deep space and jow to avoid getting combat scanned and also when to leave what a good loot . As u might die iffu get greedy . I generally keep a cargo scanner so i just goto a site see whats in box and only havk boxes which are above 1-2 mill so i dont waste time on hacking shit that gives me pennies
---
3. Knowing the rule of sixes for hacking 
---
So to get isk in exploration u dont need investment of isk but investment of few topics of eve which is very nicely explained on youtube
---
I feel like an acceptable version of this would be to remove *manual* asset safety from structures. So when a structure is destroyed or unanchored, items go to asset safety, but as long as the structure is still in space, items are locked in like they used to be with outposts.
---
I know but that would be compromising in advance something CCP has shown they don't want to do. They've been erring on the side of going in too hard father than going with what seems acceptable.
---
There bad ideas and there are very bad ideas.       
---
Those are even worst
---
"If".
---
I just do relaxed mission running on my Jita alt and as he is supposed to have teh standings as high as possible I don't really decline more than the one per 4h thing. I don't run many missions on him anyways. That's why I wrote there that I don't blitz.
---
Can you explain the corp/faction as high as possible though? Do you do as many storyline as possible or how does that work? I thought keeping the agent standings high would be easier.
---
TBH it would almost be a good idea to get rid of cynos fit to ships entirely and just have them be a deployable instead.
---
? near2 scrapps intel logs anf displays hits on a map. It never used local.      
---
Now the players who reported have to be more on their toes and watch gate grids instead of local, so chances are higher that hostiles slip by unreported.       
---
But the functioms of near2  and other intel tools did not change.         
---
The fountain standing for example is vibrant with intel.
---
Like PA paid a lot of cash for it.    
---
You don't let a 200-400mil investment to just die in 1st year due to bad decisions.
---
I only thought of that after I wrote my answer but didn't want to do a second edit. If you have an alt available for that and no problem with dual boxing use a second char!
---
Wow you must be Nostradamus incarnate, citing something CCP has already talked about.
---
Just remember we have already told you this one will break shit on a whole new level.
---
Oh how I wish the people who visited had some balls as well.
---
How does killing squishy in a suicide BS equate to fighting a mining rokh with a carrier?
---
You forgot the logi rorqual... it's the ship that has been rotting eve from the inside. CCP fault for being greedy and short sighted and making the playerbase evolve into a lot of angry miners blue to each other and botters with titans. This is a large part of "clients" to whom they have to answer now.
---
It is not expired. Just for the wrong host-/domainname.
---
That's probably how Nostradamus worked IRL :) I haven't read everything CCP has talked about. I'm working out of my own observations on the changes and players reacting to them.
---
And where did those minerals come from to build an entire super fleet? All those botting vnis and gilas? Botted isk doesn’t build you super fleets, rorqs do, and you don’t bot rorqs.
---
Cause people are shitbags? We are dressed up monkeys that at our core always fall back on us vs them mentality?
---
TBH, I've never bought the argument that "players will get fucked if asset safety is removed because they might go away and return to all their stuff being gone". There's a plethora of player hauling services available, every major and most minor alliances have internal hauling groups and services, public contracts exist alongside people skilled or reckless enough to take them. And if push comes to shove and you *really* have to leave the game for extended periods of time with *absolutely zero* warning beforehand, *and* you will be returning (a series of events that is unlikely to occur at the same time), you can petition a GM and they will likely move your stuff for you given an extreme circumstance.
---
As for existing players who would be on break during the changes, CCP should hopefully just send out a heads-up email (maybe alongside a PLEX/sub discount) to all players, and logging in to put the stuff you need moved up on contract takes maybe an hour or so. Arguing that there is *no possible way* for players to save their stuff when they decide to take a break isn't just disingenuous, it's laughably bullshit. And if you go away without moving your stuff and come back to it all being gone, well, sucks to suck. You had every opportunity and you wasted it.
---
I look forward to losing all my meaningless internet points over this one, but TBH IDC. GF, HAND.
---
Username checks out.
---
Except I only mined for like a week and I never got killed while mining so why would I be salty about people that are too bad to do real PVP
---
Thank you !!
---
Heck yea !
---
First the effective standing of an agent is the maximum of agent, corp, faction standings. BUT if one reaches -2 it becomes the lowest.
---
Then the effective increase in standing is proportional to what you need to reach 10. eg if you are at 0 standing with agent and get a +2 standing, that's a +20% gain over the missing 10 so an effective +2. If you are at 5 , it will become an effective +1. I you are -10, if will be 20% of the missing 20 so effective +4. What this means is that it's useless to do storyline when you are too high, because the gain is reduced.
---
Agent and corp standings go down for every declined mission. Faction standing goes down, but only by 0.01 value every time, which is actually the minimum modification value of -0.001 (which tells us that the standing is actually on base 10 000 : your standing goes from -10 000 to +10 000). So you need to refuse 1000 missions to get -1 effective standing. However this also applies to friendly factions, so you \*may\* be in a case where you keep access to the agent but lost access to other factions agents.
---
you don't need to dual box. Just let your alt accept the mission, go the mission gate, you warp there in a  combat ship and do the (long and boring…) normal mission.
---
Check the price on steam, it's usually much cheaper for countries with bad exchange rates.
---
This is what is happening, look at darkness as an example, they are bleeding numbers as players/corps leave to go to the bigger blobs for protection to do the things they enjoy or quit totally. I was in darkness I saw the annihilation from inside, the inability of a small/medium alliance to adapt as fast or efficiently as the big 3/4, 
---
You clearly state " if you let blobs grow more than a certain point, there are no more large fights. " thats exactly what is happening now, what benefit is there for a line member to join a smaller alliance, there is no way to earn isk and they are farmed constantly.
---
Before I left Darkness/pre-blackout people were ratting, mining doing ok, a small cap umbrella that was rarely dropped a fleet ping had between 40-90 subcap players, post blackout all ratting/mining stopped dek was/is overrun with hunters, fleets are now getting 10-30 joining, people are not playing and those that are wont do it where they are being farmed, and are leaving to the blob en mass(around 1000 since june 1st)
---
I really enjoyed my time in darkness it was fun being part of a smaller alliance to know all the fcs and be part of something and feel you could make a difference to. This is dieing due to the changes being made and alot of people expressing these views are ignored because adapt or die,
---
I voted for you because i saw you as an independent view and not one of the big players and I thought you could present an unbiased view to ccp. To be honest recently all I have seen from you is cheerleading the changes that are killing so many players and the game,
---
You should listen Talking in Stations with Hilmar
---
[https://youtu.be/Fo-L\_D3p9W4](https://youtu.be/Fo-L_D3p9W4)
---
And you will have a whole insight about where the game is going.
---
Thats probably true:)
---
It will be asset safety, perhaps capital ehp nerf, removal of support fighters and so on. Pretty much everything the vocal minority are asking for. Lets see how far they can go before the cascade sets in.
---
Thanks! I'll listen to that.
---
Thank you EVE community for the upvotes, the silvers, the gold and and botter !

Netflix stock really did crash when blackout started, I pulled this graph from the stock exchange
---
It isn't of course. A single bot is one too many
---
If you're just some rando who applies to a corp wanting a high-level logistics position, that sounds really suspicious.
---
See what the logistics people need help with. While you're doing that, make sure that the stuff which people need is available at places where people need it. Get to know the logistics people and convince them that even if you are a potential spy, you're valuable enough to be given some trust.
---
Just learn to FC. A dedicated FC will always be adored by their corp. You'll need to learn about all the ships (be it PvP fleets or pve content like incursions), learn what to tag, be a drone bunny, ect. But you'll be a rockstar if your willing to FC.
---
I love how, even after all this time, people are still complaining about local. 
---
Local chat. Fucking LOCAL CHAT was a meta defining feature of a game infamous for its intruigue and deep strategy. If you miss it this much, then it was used drastically more than it was ever to.
---
Come to lowsec, we will scout for your caps and light a cyno.
---
There has, though, just not in the value of goods built from minerals because minerals have deflated at almost the same rate ISK has inflated.
---
&gt;Those are even worst
---
okay.
---
Sorry but we don't need more jumping haulers or stationary cynos that you can spam around.
---
until you meet your first webifier drone(8km/s) or statis tower(60km range).
---
Up from me as I completely agree. Asset safety was a rediculous idea in the first place. It should be 100% removed. All the changes so far have been great. Carebear null is on its way out the door.
---
&gt; Give Blockade Runners an ability to jump to covert cynos (or introduce a new T2 Industrial ship that can do that)
---
Cargo expanded Redeemer can hold 5.5k m^3.

&gt; Give us deployable cynos (60 seconds onlining time, no more than 50k ehp)

DST's get such a beast buffer tank (even though they get the rep bonus) especially the impel.

I've never been good at being the bear, I'm a small gang PvPer at heart and Provi has always had enough willing PvPers to sustain my favoured 8-16 dude fleets where I can roll around in my T3Cs and Recons.
---
I think the route to success recognizes that some people just arent going to PvP as much as you or I want to, but to recognize that their contributions to ADMs and to buyback programmes which ultimately keep our Nags in stock and our SRP wallets funded are also valuable.
---
It's on us (not you, us as in PvPers of Provi) to bring more like minded folks to PvP in Providence. There's no lack of content so the issues lay more around messaging and image imo.

Gorge disgustingly on chicken tendies smothered in mommy’s special BBQ recipe while I laugh maniacally at zkill losses and the fits within.

Or stop being a fucking whiney poor and pony up the dough for a fucking jump freighter maybe? You know the ship that's designed to do the very fucking thing you're asking for?

Removeing asset safety REMOVES PLAYER RETURNABILITY TENFOLD.
---
Assets have NEVER dropped in nullsec, they were first in stations that couldnt die, now theyre in stations they can asset saftey stuff out.
---
they might stop manual asset safety which would be a good change.
---
but to do this change (that you say you think will happen when your blinded by what you WANT to happen) they would need to give notice 6-12months before implementing it, this idea, will not go through IMO
---
Have you heard about lack of lowsec gate to Stain?
---
agreed, also nerf highsec
---
In my experience in Eve international communities thrive, while region/language locked ones have much greater difficulties. This is partly due to game mechanics that encourage having multiple tz coverage, but imo there's more to it than just that. To me at least Eve is (also) a chance to connect with people from all over the world and from all walks of life, coming together and coopèerating to achieve common goals no matter their personal, political and religious belief. This social aspect of the game is what makes it special, so all this nationalist crap seems to me totally out of place around here.
---
yes, but you wont have anyone making isk in nullsec if highsec is triple the payout for a fraction of even the pre-blackout risk
---
IIRC he did that to get his fleet back in the fight in a more appropriate doctrine faster. Realized Machs were the wrong call and instead of taking the time to fly them back out he got people to SD and deathclone home to reship.
---
You don't need to get perfectly correct answers from perfectly sanitized data.
---
Most of the time, you don't get perfectly sanitized data. You get a set of data which is decent enough for estimates and giving general direction of things.
---
Rip anyone who is taking a break, no reason for them to return.
---
I was under the impression the proposed deployable would only be for industrials. 
---
Would still be hilarious to see a constant stream on T1 inustrials bridging to your dread to feed it 3200's.
---
Except they need 10x more accounts to make same level of isk. Might actually need to spend RL money on hardware or take a hit in RL income. Either way, it's quite disruptive.
---
Chinish player base is trash skill and mentality wise nothing to be proud of in game.
---
Remove all cynos.
---
JF can hold over 300k m\^3 of cargo, while a BR can hold up to around 13.5k, not enough to place a Ferox in, so my proposal isn't going to replace JFs, otherwise nobody would be flying T1 freighters either. And you seem to be a little bit upset.
---
Incoming new meta - high slot that has forever been used as a cyno now free to be another offensive module. 500 cyno beacons in cargo hold.
---
There will be no headline making wars or fights. One side is effectively 80% of null and another is 20%. The smaller side will not take a fight head on. Sure you will get 100-299-399bn fights here and there, but they aren't news worthy.
---
Olmeca is right but he needs to consider adding the political element here. Legacy, being the second strongest group is more of a compliant empire to no.1 and not a competitor. This hasn't happened in Eve in years, you always had 1 and 2 going at it, but Legacy's politics of 'sir, yessir' has pretty much put on oath to Serenity with full speed.
---
its almost like he thinks CCP gives a fuck about his opinion or something.
---
~~Hey look its a Karen~~
---
I never said anything to the effect of "EVE should cater to me" but ok lmao
---
&gt;Next time someone claims blackout helps Imperium/Legacy/Pamfam more I'd love to see their data.
---
CCP already posted that data its called the MER, you should maybe read it sometime.
---
Tbh, I too would leave GoTG, not because of blackout, but because they're an SMA level of shit.  First, they propped up by Panfam and then Tapirium. No one to hold their hands, they've seen multiple hunting groups deploy and bleed them by thousand cuts.
---
Anyway, I feel Olmeca is doing great.
---
This is what happens when you vote for an egomaniac who's sole purpose for playing EVE at this point is to be anti-goons, which he has admitted on more than one post/twitch stream.
---
good, while your at it, up the inhib up to 200km like they always should have been
---
mine in a rorqual in one of the nullblocs and tell me that shits afk....or with rorq boosted hulks.... that shit aint no AFK
---
Regions need finite resources and faster depletion and slower regeneration, not 25-40% more payout, lol.
---
Why do people go to Tama for anything but combat? I've been on the Nourvukaiken gate, so I know that it happens, but why in God's name would you ever take a shortcut through Tama?
---
100% legit
---
&gt;CCP hasn't so far caved to player requests to compromise but has implemented changes to the fullest degree
---
I mean they scaled down the Drifter attacks in Sov-Space, right?
---
Placing a cloaked rolling battleship on the static in jump range on the final pass. If you see/hear anything jump you simply roll it.
---
Oh wow, this is such a limitation that a **mining** ship can only do a thing while mining. Want me to tell you a secret? When panic was introduced that limitation didn't exist, CCP had to add it as a hotfix because PL abused the shit out of the Rorq as an invincible jump hic.
---
Yeah set up a nice bait and they warp off and cloak, very worth
---
What's the highest loot value that you can get from wrecks running level 1 security missions?
---
Ew that's low. Guess that mission isn't worth it anymore.
---
Crit the hole so one more jump will close it. Sit on the out side of it. When something scary shows up in that system, jump through and close the hole behind you. This way you know your static is safe instead of just hoping no one has warped to it while you weren't looking and opened the k126.
---
*Goon null linemember
---
Nope, not even a little bit true. Subcaps die before your response can respond. So your 'main advantage' isn't actually true.
---
[exactly](https://i.redd.it/wsaan49l8tr11.jpg)
---
I would love to see capital class sites or escalations in Null. So if you want to rat in your capital, fine but the rats HIC point you and do non trivial dps. 
---
I also think that the payouts for sub capital sites needs an increase. If they are worried about the ISK faucet then move the value out of bounties into loot (maybe something that gives LP for the faction you killed, might need some mental gymnastics on the lore side for why they would reward you for killing them though). 
---
The "pendulum" has gone too far one way, either you need to make it a bit safer by iterating on blackout or increase the rewards to the point where the risk is worth it.
---
Can you also do that for all the other Braves soldiers too..they deserve it
---
" I dont get the negativity OP is recieving in here.  "  
---
because he voiced an opinion on r/eve that was not anti-goons/pro Chaos
---
Yeah, because a group with the manpower to gank a freighter can't afford to have a few people in throwaway tackle noobships to reset the timer.....
---
For sure stuff will die in uedama or niarja as you should not even visit the systems where pirates live, but bumping nerf killed next style.        
---
Even if higsec piracy game play was not the target of this change it became the victim of it.               
---
/u/ccp_falcon any comments?
---
Go away, you are part of the problem.  Post like this are cancer and people like you should sell your account and just play WOW
---
Attitudes like yours are killing eve
---
I mean he could be in DSONS
---
Stop
---
Finallt someone thought about freighter and jump freigter newbros!
---
the way it works: a single individual trolls around and looks for a target, and when it's found, people form up
---
they don't, and really can't roam around with the 9 alts required to hold down a freighter.
---
"Nothing like 3 additional omega accounts cannot solve"         
---
     
---
How many freighters did you raided for their cargo?
---
or just have a guy ready to respond if it happens? if it's an ongoing issue it should be easy to reship and help a friend out, or have people just ready to engage
---
it's called an MMO for a reason, if they're organized enough to setup a gank on you with multiple people, you should be able to extend half the effort for the amount of ISK you wanted to make.
---
the player count is down, and most the people who are left are the salt eating vets, who know the game, the haulers who fit that category know how to haul in a way that mitigates ganking by a huge amount. I would toss this up to the massive player loss raised the overall skill level of the game.
---
I didn't know the mechanics for faction standings when declining missions. I thought they would drop proportional to the agent standing, too. thank you for the information.
---
shrudinger wormhole
---
If you look at the Ganked section in zk (yes, we know it's imprecise because of the way it's calculated), you will see that ganking really declines during the week. 
---
In fact, even with your link you can there's very few freighter piracy in the *days before*. 
---
|September|\# highsec freighter kills (for any reason)|

Your evidence is poor at best. Disingenuous at worst.
---
How can you tell? And please, don't use the 'trust me' argument cause we kinda stopped since you abused that on way too many occasions.
---
yes they go down proportional to agent standing.
---
This is perfectly doable with alphas
---
&gt; No, the CSM can’t make the CCP do anything. CCP runs the game as they see fit and uses the CSM to bounce ideas off of and better understand exactly what the players are doing in the game. The CSM doesn’t make them fix faction warfare or remove warp core stabilizers or nerf [insert your choice here]. 
---
But, but, reddit told its actually GSM :(
---
You are not correct.            
---
I say this as person with ~1000 freighters and ~150 JF raided for their cargo.               
---
I explicitly named this piracy and not ganking, because targets are chosen by cargo value 99% of times and people hauling reasonable amounts of cargo are ignored.
---
I would like to somehow retain the idea of strategic capital escalation, though.  
---
I know that caps need to be nerfed, but i do like a good dread on dread brawl.
---
It's in the nature of people who would follow that unstable mess of a "leader"
---
1 no train into and buy a JF, easy.   
---
 2 maybe, but it slightly defeats the point of the changes, as it can be exploited in many ways, even with 200km range, blah blah blah
---
I think for people hunting krabs (I dont see any other reason as to why this would help pvp corps find others quicker)   This change would only have a negative effect. If a krab sees the new sig before it’s scanned down and warped to by another group, they have more time to escape their current anom that they’re running or if they’re mining, stop mining earlier. Whilst the difference might not be much (sometimes only 30sec) this still is a big difference because it allows you to red cycle your siege/core mode earlier or prepare for combat quicker.
---
of which ccp was told about the abuse on sisi before it went live. infact, the panic module did not burn out at all. it just had a 10min cd which started the moment you used it. ccp only listened to players on sisi after a call out was made to abuse the panic module on sisi which people did and then the burn out was added.
---
Actually if I ask a new recruit if he’s a spy and he doesn’t confirm, there’s a good chance the person in question won’t be invited to corp simply because of trust issues. 😁
---
Are you implying that \*gasp* you need to be a bit organized now to be able to hunt high value targets? Oh the horror.
---
International terrorists do not deserve praise or recognition
---
Would certainly bring more content
---
Why? To make MJD battleship farming even safer? Its hard enough rage rolling for content, never mind they now get a 1 minute head start.
---
They did change the cyno mechanics alomg the way. Initially JFs were supposed to use covert cynoa.        
---
The industrial cyno idea was proposed by the community either here or on the official forums (who know what CCP listens to more).
---
And it's still too strong after all the nerfs to it IMO.
---
[Read this first](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d3m3kp/since_the_bumping_changes_no_freighter_in_higsec/f03odhp/)             
---
On top of that i can say that not always you find the target or manage to "get" the target even if you find it.          
---
There are haulers in gmae that know what they are doing - to the point that even if they undock in 20bil, you know that you will not get them &lt;3            
---
Please exclude those freighters dying to wardecers, NPC and this orca that died to tornados as he mined the wrong moon.
---
First, it definitely does change the point. See BBTB2's post for that.
---
Second, editing in a comment about being called out for being possibly the worst spinner here doesn't actually change the fact that you as a CSM member are getting called out for manipulating data to fit your 'proposals/agenda'. 
---
You might think Goons are not making the CSM look good but you're actually doing a lot about people thinking the CSM is a complete joke.
---
So leader of AoM leaked RL info on leader of WC...well hello?
---
 The next change will be server shutdown.
---
yeah, always roam around with 9 alts as a prerequisite in order to attempt freighter ganking
---
REALLY GOOD GAME DESIGN LMFAO GOOD ONE MATE
---
Wait, netflix make money from subs not viewcounts. 🐂💩
---
A 3 day old char in a jump freighter on freighter carrying 15bil is not a newbro - this is first thing.           
---
2nd i don't care if he is newbro or a 12 year old player.      
---
If he hauls 20bil in a freighter then he is a good target, if this is 3bil in minerals like **who cares**.
---
Also cancer.
---
&gt;9 alts
---
EVE has to be the single most antisocial MMO in existence.
---
I think min maxing is fine and well. It's basically all I've ever done in any game. In EVE the problem arises when once you've "solved" whatever it is you're doing, you just sit proud of that and never try anything new. Especially if you complain every single time CCP changes something.
---
My favourite patch in the time I've played was still Citadel. Between citadels themselves as a new option strategically and the capital rebalance the 6 months after that patch where everyone had to basically work out the entire meta again was so fun. I'm not really sold on the Blackout/Cyno changes but I think they're much the same thing. Sometimes just giving the snowglobe a shake is enough on its own.
---
One can only hope
---
there is no way you're going to convince 9 other people to sit around and do nothing for hours while you look for large targets, you do know how rare they are nowadays right?

/s
---
You clearly like balls 🤓
---
You cannot have omega and alpha characters logged in.          
---
Piracy in higsec is constantly petitioned as much as ganking is.        
---
**You need to do** your job by the rules.              
---
You need to die at the end - so even if concord bug itself, you self destruct your ship &lt;3
---
Nah
---
Why does it need to be 9? Does it take you that long to form up? And certain if other groups for example need 6 rolling alts (5 battleships and a hic) to effectively roll in order to hunt i think you can live through some noobships.
---
hundreds
---
Because the risk level on the line for the people who make one kind is completely off the scale from the risk of the other kind. People meme super hard about rolling the holes shut but the reality is that the risk comes form people rolling in to you. If that sig spawns off dscan you gotta roll the dice. Do you abandon someone to die or do you hope that it's not a wormhole being ragerolled. And if your wrong your entire fleet of 4-6+ 1bil+ isk battleships is just plain dead when that sig spawns.
---
On top of that there's no asset safety in wormholes. Your infrastructures in wh space is actually vulnerable. Someone bigger than you decided you look like you'd drop some good loot or they don't feel like you feed them ships often enough. Or really just because the wind was blowing west that day you could lose everything. All of your infrastructure cracked open and looted by your attackers everything you had in the hole gone in a week. 
---
Even today you can still make like 7-8mil ticks completely afk in a vexor (not a vni just an ordinary vexor.) And sure you can make 3 times that in c1 wormholes. But you can't do it afk without putting something far more expensive than a 15mil vexor on grid to do so. But here's the other thing: that wormhole will only make ***YOU*** around that much putting just a single extra person in the wormhole will cut that in half. And then into thirds with 3 people. This is because the sites don't respawn. You have to have a static to roll to keep farming. And then you gotta add in the time to roll, the time to scan scout and roll out the new hole. Things start adding up quickly which is why most people don't bother with the super low C1/2 sites typically unless they go for the risk of not prepping the holes for farming.
---
That is not really how it works, most of the time.
---
The bulk of it is a person sitting at a chokepoint and scanning cargo.
---
Roaming scanning is horribly inefficient.
---
And you wouldn't need 9 alts, you just need 5
---
Well first, stop using this super made up number of 9. That would be a start.
---
As a person that sits on 4-4 with 3 support chars already - i can confirm this.     
---
Sometime you sped like 20h without seeing a worthy target, sometimes if you find one you cant do much as you are the only one online left.
---
~1000
---
The static spawns the k-162. In other words the hunters spawn the k-162 into the krab hole. The krabs see it when the hunters initiate warp - I.e it is already a thing.
---
Just put even the slightest effort into ganking. *Please*. I beg of you.
---
It would just move to Perimeter, there's a singificant volume of goods passing through there already. As it's a citadel, there won't be any more ganking due to tethers.
---
So basically, "destroying" Jita just means moving most of the money in the pockets of people holding market Keepstars around it.
---
/u/ccp_falcon i want to add one thing to this question.      
---
Did CCP consider the fact how big material sink higsec piracy is ?      
---
With the "50% drop" assumption this can be trillion(s)/month.
---
I know that, but I thought this person meant that the k-162 opens whenever the new static spawns on the other side, whether someone initiated warp or not.
---
ok steev
---
Depends on what you like doing.
---
I earn a month subscription in about 5 hours on a character.
---
Please elaborate , I see a cow and smiley poop.  Not sure what you are trying to say

Incursions is the best HS (High Sec) way to get started.

Find the Hyperion Starter Ship, should cost less than 300mil to buy and join the fleets.
---
WTM are great and friendly, dont try stay in the hyperion, once you have got the first month plex upgrade to a Vindi or something. 
---
Join a Good Corp as they will help and also appreciate the tax income from the incursions.
---
I blame Disney
---
Since the gank happens at the end of this and the ships stopping the warp don't need to all be  active at the same time in theory even a single person could do this with alphas he logs in one after another while another bumps and the person with the alphas could still participate in the gank on his actual ganking char, so 2 real people can do it.
---
It’s not liking good tbh
---
Do you have the skills yet? Like Deep space transports and jump Freighters? To start with logistics, you could join pushx or redfrog.
---
This is racist! ( Even though Chinese is not a race, elementary schooling helps. 🤣 )
---
Didn't assets drop from pos/sma/cha in null?
---
This guy does not PvP
---
but still..  there are few solar systems and ship names and even ship designs from  EVE..
---
so far found  omen kind tormentor kind and............vertical hecate. there is also something looking like minokava/loggerhead  aaaaaaaaaaand  OLD MAN STAR... and there is good thing that eve lacks - sidekicks...  you can have assigned  few assisting pilots aka npc logi/dps  that help you  by repping you or shooting target  and theres only shield and armor - no hull,ship explodes = no ship loss ~bad bad bad,,ship lost should be lost...
---
SG is just another Star Conflict
---
So you should get some of your friends to take time out of whatever they are doing to hang around for hours at a time in the hopes that some bombers gank you and then don't warp away when you try gank them.
---
What are you even talking about
---
Or people kill other people's miners while giving their own a bit of security.
---
Everything is fine, Salty temporary angry people left. Oh wait pirates/gankers in hisec were farming in nullsec? Noo way? 
---
People sayin game is fine, and will be fine with avr \~10k are so wrong. PA will do their job soon as they see next CCP financial report ;D
---
People need to up their game. Adapt or cry...
---
Why do you ping him with your random terrible questions ? They’ve considered what they are doing and they are continuing. You have a few months left on your one account just let it run down and move on to a game that suits your personality better
---
Damn, this is cool Battleship fight with logi
---
Right you are Phteeev
---
man you're completely helpless, there is nothing people can do to defend themselves apparently. you win.
---
oh no wait, you're wrong, people do it every day. guess you need an IQ greater than 80 to do that.
---
we already do daily
---
I think 6 is more reasonable since at 5 you run the risk of the target getting to warp away while your in warp to it. 5 gives you exactly 3 minutes in between you can take 2m30s with 6.
---
You absolutely love to grab a random stat and then make a drama about it. 
---
Yesterday no one killed a ship in a tengu, eve is literally dying right before our eyes quick burn it down and let’s fulfill our own circle jerk
---
Most of the screeching comes from those corners that prided in attracting Hisec carebears to null for ratting and mining for empire building. These krabbers are pissed now and leaving or not logging in. Their hosts are here crying about it. 
---
The criticism of chaos era has come from a couple of very specific corners of Eve and doubt it carries any wider overall appeal.
---
Remove asset safety, but maybe trigger a “vacation mode” or something where your assets will be saved, but you can’t access them during. 
---
I’d be happy with complete removal but am trying to find a middle ground.
---
bro normies who have 0 freighter ganks tryin to impose what they think the game should be with zero experience 
---
just lol
---
It’s a playstyle that involves minimal skill. I see why you do so well at it
---
Since the cyno changes half the amount of soups and Titans have died
---
3 minute bump timer, you're not going to tag a freighter every 3 minutes exactly, you're going to give yourself some safe room, so every 2 minutes = 8 required alts to keep a freighter there 15 minutes and continue cycling, and one bumper = 9
---
it's not made up, it's how many you need to form up a gank fleet and fly over minimum.
---
8 suicide alts = 16 minutes (since you need to do it every 2 minutes or so because things can interfere with your ability to point)
---
and 1 bumper
---
Yeah but no one really lived in them with all their stuff
---
&gt;The bulk of it is a person sitting at a chokepoint and scanning cargo.
---
and then you have to fly over to where they're going and bump them in that location, hoping they never dock up or citadel up before you get them.
---
You can take 2:30 with 5 as well.
---
The timer on the first would end with 30 seconds left.
---
Given your inability to think up even the most simple solution to a new problem instead of crying on reddit [it sure doesn't sound like it](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/021/e02e5ffb5f980cd8262cf7f0ae00a4a9_press-x-to-doubt-memes-memesuper-la-noire-doubt-meme_419-238.jpg)
---
flub one warpin with only 6 and it's gone
---
you're gonna need 8 for every 2 minutes, so you can flub a warpin and be fine
---
i already thought up the solution and already posted it in this threat doofus, my argument is that it's going to kill 90% of the freighter ganking in the game (it already has)
---
Well that’s a Change of perspective
---
5 can give you a tag at every 2:30.
---
And at 2 minutes, you only need 7, as the timer on the first would end with a whole minute before the freighter needs to be hit again.
---
You won't be able to have more than 5 drones active, regardless of skills. There is one ship that allowes you to have more, not sure if it's still in the game tho so not really relevant.
---
&gt;For high slots:
---
Observe the regular ranges at which you fight during the missions with your friend. Then compare with your current drone control range, and add drone augmenters to make sure you never have to move too much to set your drones on the desired target. 
---
In practice, if you normally fight frigates or dessies that aggro automatically, and you don't have to burn 50 km towards them, you won't need range augmenters.
---
Command Modules: Yes, you do buff yourself. However, at a low level, the bonuses won't be very significant. They are also split in 4 categories, and since you are armor tanked and your buddy is shield tanked, you won't be getting the full benefits of tanking bursts. I would recommend Skirmish or Information Command Bursts to help the both of you.
---
Guns are okay, even if you have no bonuses. 5 turrets will make a difference in a low level mission.
---
If damage and tank are absolutely no problem, tractor beams and Salvager mods will increase your income marginally.
---
&gt; Low Slots: 
---
Damage mods always compete with armor tank. A Myrmidon has 6 low slots, so you have quite a bit of flexibility.
---
You absolutely need 1 repair mod and 1 resistance mod minimum, which leaves 4 "free" slots. From then on, you mix and match depending on how much damage you are taking during a regular mission. The end result would be 2-3 Drone Damage Amplifiers (DDA) and resistance mods for the rest.
---
If you are having trouble tanking, a fit can look like this:
---
2x DDA II
---
1x Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane
---
2x Damage-specific Hardener
---
1x Medium Armor Repairer (as strong as you can afford/fit)
---
If you are fighting a single type of rat or always facing the same 2 types of damage, you can switch the EANM for another specific hardener. If you find yourself fighting all damage types more often, consider changing a damage-specific hardener with a Reactive Armor Hardener. It takes cap and a while to "ramp up" but otherwise it's a nice generic damage reduction tool.
---
When you no longer have tanking problems, you can put in 1 more DDA, and/or replace a second tanking mod with a gun or Omnidirectional Tracking Enhancer (drone accuracy mod).
---
What, a whole system? You need to fly a whole system over!!! the horror!!!
---
If you cant gank a frieghter in 3 minutes then eat shit. You shouldn’t be able to bump them forever that might as well be an exploit
---
Are you providing your defenders with free ships you mined yourself or are you selling the stuff you mined yourself? If you are giving it away for your own defense then you can take this righteous indignant attitude. If you are selling the stuff you mine to your defenders you can sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up because you aren't special.
---
uh no, it's generally many systems
---
tell me, how many freighters have you ganked?
---
&gt;because things can interfere with your ability to point  
---
Like what, the pointship getting ganked? Damn theres a new way of counterplay now, how horrible...
---
&gt;And at 2 minutes, you only need 7, as the timer on the first would end with a whole minute before the freighter needs to be hit again.
---
Bump Achieved - Alt 1 spent
---
2 minutes - alt 2
---
4 minutes - alt 3
---
6 minutes - alt 4
---
8 minutes - alt 5
---
10 minutes - alt 6
---
13 minutes - alt 7

15 minutes - alt 8

Is the criminal timer not 15 minutes?
---
Aggro is 3 minutes. You need to aggro more or less in 2:30 just to be safe.         
---
So you need to aggro at :        
---
(1)2:30, (2) 5:00 , (3) 7:30 , (4) 10:00 , (5) 12:30, (6) 15:00  
---
(before you can use the same char to aggro again)           
---
You can add 7th char to the list if you need to instantly point your target, if not this is your "spare" aggro that you keep if one of the chars will die along the way because with so much multiboxing and stuff happening around you better have +1 for this aka (8) th char that you move initially.                         
---
Add to this a bumper and you are at 9 chars.    
---
How long it takes to form up?           
---
10-15minutes and add to this travel time.            
---
There is big difference in WH hunting and piracy.           
---
You know where to roll to get targets and see even on dotlan if there is something around.          
---
While doing the piracy you look for a target.        
---
It can be 10minutes but sometimes it is 2-3 hours if not 20hours.             
---
You cannot move them togheter, y
---
Well if you are doing it by yourself all those points have to be omega anyway. But you could enlist the help of someone to do it with alphas for you making holding it a 2 man job instead of a solo job.
---
I just posted why the 9 chars in other post here if you care to look.    
---
Like you can cut this to 8 but then a single mistake and that is it.
---
Yeah im with you man, and it completely makes structure bashing pointless. Like why would i spend a stupid amount of time shooting something that usually wont shoot back, just to go “okay cool” once its done and get nothing out of it. Removal of asset safety would create the conflict that null is lacking right now. Why go to war? You literally gain nothing.
---
Care to explain?            
---
If someone is looking for targets in nullsec he just open a dotlan and see when and who is active.          
---
People can also go to areas where you always find something moving.             
---
If you look for some valuable cargo you need to find it yourself, there is no endpoint saying where to go.
---
Sure the tool didn’t technically change but it functionally got nerfed. Watching local is functionally an afk task. Bots can do that — all you need is one account at the entrance of the pocket. Actively watching gates requires attention and is way harder to do when you’re multi boxing which means things like intys can slip through
---
If adapting to this change is so hard that freighterganking goes down by that much then IMO the gankers don't deserve that loot anyway tbh.
---
Words from a person that fights when he have upper hand and runs the moment there is a chance of losing is quite worthless.    
---
Can he even be called a man?
---
literally "I don't like the new patch so I propose a modification that goes completely the opposite".
---
Yes and no.       
---
First of all you are kind of correct as this could work this way.         
---
But you cannot use alpha chars this way unless you want to get banned.      
---
Like i told you you need to do stuff by the rules.          
---
Using alpha chars just for aggro and cycling them is against them and will get you a ban.
---
Adding scrams to wormhole sites would be nice, to counter mjd BS spam. But making the rolled in sig spawn before the scanner has even reached it will only give the targets a head start.
---
well if that's your opinion despite all the facts then there is no point in further discussion, try to remember to breathe every once in a while
---
The bumper doesn't really belong into the consideration of *additional* characters.  
---
And Freighters can be spotted up a pipe which gives a good amount of additional time. Guess you need to start forming now before you 100% know that targets are going to uedama/niarja/etc. Welcome to blueballs, everyone else that does pvp knows what that is already
---
that's abuse of the alpha account system most likely
---
I count 2:30 and emergency aggro on site as you can fuck up easily with so much stuff happening and lose one of the chars.
---
&gt;how horrible
---
i agree, the system is terrible
---
Actually being tackled on gate, dying due to kill right and so on.       
---
I lost freighters due to this kind of issues.
---
i see a lot of people saying this who aren't good at freighter ganking, odd.
---
I'm not saying there is nothing people can do, I'm saying the amount of effort required for the hunter and the target has skewed so far in favour of the hunter that it's just not worth it anymore, which can be seen with the amount of players logged in.
---
The risk vs reward to be a ratter right now is terrible, so why bother.
---
A dozen or so. Not sure.
---
How would it be? You aren't logging into multiple at a time. You log one in un dock do the deed dock back up and log off. All while your main is offline. This is the same thing you would likely do with any other alpha alts that you could conceivably even use.
---
I agree with you. It's fair that all of wh is making more ISk than Delve. I think there's some kind of misunderstanding in the comments above.
---
Yes 7 tacklers.
---
1 bumper and 7 alts.
---
Few pvp fleets are serious.
---
abuse of the alpha system, banned
---
I was not aware of such a rule and tbh would like to get a citation.
---
Yes, 5x 2:30 is 12:30.
---
So the timer ends at 15 and you have 30 seconds to undock and tackle the freighter.
---
So get friends.
---
If you can't get a gank together in 15 minutes, then that is your fault.
---
&gt;consideration of additional characters.
---
that's why i didn't say additional retard
---
Over the years CCP nerfed multiple times ganking.      
---
They lead to situation where only big groups can do it or people like 'Kusion family' with 40 chars.          
---
It is not about "adapt" but more about how higsec works.       
---
**CCP goal for this was not to hit ganking, but to  address issue when new players bumped off structures unable to warp ... and quit don't knowing why they cannot warp**
---
Raise a ticket about this to CCP and you will get this info.    
---
Not all rules are listed down - you cannot abuse alpha chars and this and this is considered abuse.
---
If you haven't already, consider reaching out to CCP. They have been known to teleport a returning player's assets to safety from nullsec.
---
you need 7 if you do 2:30, which has faults, if you're going to being 7, you're dumb to not bring 8.
---
8 is required otherwise you're going to be cutting it too close
---
Spend some time in piracy and you will notice that industry moved much closer to jita and long hauls by uedama and niarja are quite rare.    
---
Trade hubs other than jita died.
---
I had 80 alpha accounts logged off at a location and had a freighter bumped to the location and went through the steps you posted, I was petitioned and advised to not do it again as I was abusing the alpha system.
---
Not too much.
---
It's mostly the same game with the same stuff happening everywhere.
---
Small changes to nullsec ratting and capitals.
---
The big change is a whole lot of bitching. Actually, that's always been there, too.
---
so you have little to no experience 
---
got it
---
You cannot bump freighter forever and if you do for sole purpose of bumping it **it is an exploit**
---
Yeah, the latter generates fuck all isk and isn't worth bothering with.
---
Btw i think Second Galaxy is great, i really like it a lot
---
You have my +1
---
I don't think we're really near a limit.
---
Most of the bitching is making mountains of molehills.
---
In other words, they decided to completely fuck the game, but are too lazy to even do that properly and don't even listen to players
---
For (the equivalent of) 1 tril ISK/month to leave the economy via highsec piracy, there would have to be an average of 67 billion ISK/day. 
---
This is something we can determine ourselves via zk.
---
nope, what is truly and utterly delusional is thinking that players that were used to a certain cancerous gameplay for years will switch their mentality faster than a new bro adapting to the new meta.
---
it's human behavioral attitude 101, always easier to get involved in any situation than adapting to a changing environment than you are already part of.
---
the risk reward is TERRIBLE compared to other pve activities 
---
this was never debated, i'm in favor of significant buffs to nullsec anom payouts and a rework
---
the issue being posed is that it is MUCH EASIER to be a ratter on the defensive making money than being a hunter with an equal number of active players, or an equal amount of skill.
---
I noticed it but we will see in 2 weeks, especially how many ratting ships will die.     
---
This darkness titan was fleet warped from the keepstar so it don't counts :D
---
&gt;that's why i didn't say additional retard  
---
Pretty sure i saw that wording in another thread where this was discussed but might be wrobg, not that it matter.  
---
&gt;and the smart ones see they've been cargo scanned, and dock up  
---
As i said, welcome to blueballs
---
with green expanders like 6k ?
---
the whole 'adapt or die' meme is a bad way to approach criticism.
---
eve is a video game, if you design a part of it poorly people will just quit, as evidenced by the massive reduction of ganks over the last two years and even moreso since this change.
---
Don't want to spoil it for you but i do this for years, ask u/globbyrebornASS even if we don't share same opinions on many things we share this activity and sometimes kills.
---
&gt;you have 30 seconds to undock and tackle the freighter.
---
hardly viable
---
In other words you can not provide a citation and given how much bullshit you pour into this sub you need to excuse me that i won't take your word for it.
---
&gt;Please exclude those freighters dying to :  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\* wardecers  
---
&gt;\* NPC  
---
&gt;\* and this orca that died to tornados as he mined the wrong moon.
---
/u/StainGuy, you do realise that if I do that, your argument gets *worse*. Don't you? 
---
I was being charitable to you by including all highsec freighter deaths.
---
Quite simply because i am CCP customer for many, many years.       
---
So i assume that this kind of give me right to ask some questions to the person that handles the "social" aspect of EVE.        
---
Because if not CCP Falcon then who?
---
Im sure that all happened on tuesday
---
Sure.
---
But you're also ALREADY incompetent to be waiting out the whole 15 minute timer anyway.
---
It spawns when they press jump btw, it's still long enough to warp but no you don't get the 30 second+ warning before they even enter system.
---
A dozen freighter, some as the FC is little experience?
---
it already is
---
No, because you cannot count a freighter dying to NPC or wardecers to pirate activity.       
---
Like those things don't add up.            
---
Like what a guy dying to rats have with piracy?
---
It's almost as if they're trying to do something for player retention by making griefing in highsec harder. Lmao.
---
Okay, you're right on that.
---
But it is still missing the point that you must be terrible to need to start another 15 minutes again.
---
Not a fan of GigX, but everyone drinking politically correct tea with each other in a gazillion 'social' channels or meetings and singing kumbaya is also getting damn gringeworthy.
---
Please also flag "COWARD" every player who is in a corp that use this device so we can see how much they understand the concept of 0 risk vs reward
---
You cannot share communications with CCP, also by rules.        
---
I can say about this to you but i cannot paste the response or screenshot here or just send it to you.
---
Imagine losing a freighter because of a killright lmao
---
do you know how long it takes to form up people and move 10-15 jumps?
---
oh, i guess we'll just limit our operational area to 3-4 jumps then
---
Now thats some high quality shitposting, all that gold you got is well deserved ... keep it up ... you seem tio have a good run atm
---
uh yeah, i've killed thousands
---
a dozen can be done in one sitting and a hundred can be done in a weekend during burn jita
---
Are players returning at all anyway?
---
"if you can't formup and travel to x system in 15 minutes you're incompetent"
---
Donation. Mostly for talwars caracals canes etc. Ice i get isk for but only cause my ceo wont let me give it away for free since myself and other miners get hit alot in the ice belt lol
---
CCP openly stated that this communications rule is just a remainder of when it made sense and is not enforced but nice try
---
Thank you so much !    I hope i inspire others to so some good quality shitposting !
---
To the high dec gankers. I believe the phrase is “Adapt or Die”.
---
Or was it “Get gud”?
---
Griefing  != piracy             
---
Like i said before i don't care about a miner in a hulk on the belt, or a guy hauling mats for a drake, or even this freighter full of drake hulls.         
---
**Don't mix piracy and griefing**            
---
You can go to lowsec and kill a newbie in a venture, pirate will ignore this venture because it has **no value to him**
---
of course they are, there was a massive thing about it about returning players hearing about blackout.
---
and none the less even with how shit eve has felt the past year or so,
---
players are returning after breaks, long breaks, full quits daily. i know this purely because im surrounded by people returning to play for a bit. or got bored of x game so playing eve between other games.
---
to think NO ONE returns, or re subs, NO ONE starts the game, and NO ONE enjoys eve is a mistake, and not real. unhappy people are the loudest, and reddit is for sure full of loud people.
---
once you look at it probabalistically you realize that the best option is to roll the RNG dice and hope the person you want to kill is retarded - unarguably bad game design
---
"You done goofed up"
---
"I backtraced it!"
---
I recommend you to play as Alpha for longer time. You will always have skills you want to train ASAP, once you have 20m skill points, you want a couple of alts and more skills for your mail. But there is a lot of content and skills you wont train ingame, you can become a really good pilot by just avoiding getting tackled. It might sound weird, but survivability is one of the most interesting skills you can learn.
---
After the tutorials, and some agent missions (not a lot) if you feel fancy go ahead and explore the map. Fly a cheap ship far away. The parts of Eve not related to grinding ISKs give you the better rewards.
---
And the starchaser nyx was during an actual fight
---
yes they are. we had threads like botters put 1 pod at the gate and monitor if someone jumps in
---
jump one guy in, blops him back out, botters never rat there ever again
---
I believe he's trying to say you're lying.
---
what blasphemy
---
Raise a ticket if you get other response well lucky you but currently it is forbidden just to use alpha chars for aggression and just cycle them.
---
yes but if if he had of been able to light a cyno and have fax jump to him he might have lived,  but also of course the dreads might have arrived earlier.  So in all honesty you cant make a determination one way or the other
---
you want to split blocks? send in drifters to attack any fleet larger than 10 players. and suddenly you will have people flying in smaller fleets and eventually blocks will splinter as there would be no upside in group, but only downsides
---
i am not advocating this precisely, but there are things that ccp could do to destroy big blocks so that people could start playing and thinking on their own
---
like all the postapocalyptic tv shows.
---
Well i guess you will just have to buckle up and get more subbed people to help then. And if you can't you might have to accept that your playstyle was too niche since you didn't have other people interested in helping.
---
this is the best so far
---
Being highly active in activities that basically rely on people being retarded i fail to feel any empathy for you. This game is full of retards, they're not hard to find.
---
Been there - did that it is a trait of the profession.  
---
In this case it was more about losing last aggression and freighter logging out.
---
Yes it was definitely sarcasm. I was mocking the people going "just roll the holes for 100% risk free ratting."
---
&gt;And if push comes to shove and you *really* have to leave the game for extended periods of time with *absolutely zero* warning beforehand, *and* you will be returning (a series of events that is unlikely to occur at the same time), you can petition a GM and they will likely move your stuff for you given an extreme circumstance.
---
In the future, hypothetical GM correspondence hits your evemail.
---
&gt;Dear Mineus64,   
---
&gt;I regret to inform you that I'll be confiscating the items you looted from &lt;structure killmail&gt; as a result of a petition from another player. As you looted these items fair and square, as part of established gameplay mechanics, no penalty will be recorded against your account.  
---
&gt;Regards,   
---
&gt;GM NotARealGM
---
If you believe that petitions are the best solution, then you should be prepared for the above to happen.
---
I'm pretty sure the GMs will *never* duplicate an item; and only ever restore vapourised items.  
---
So if loot drops, and is collected by someone, then the only options are to confiscate the item, or do nothing.
---
&gt; ".... details will be coLELcted ..."
---
freudian misspelling ?
---
I'm pretty sure most people in this game referring to themselves as pirates would be ashamed to get lumped in with you.
---
must be a heretic !
---
For me is simple.     
---
He was not doing anything in space, he undocked to see the hull in space (just to dock back) but accepted fleet invite , got warped and died.          
---
Majority of the supers and titans dying so far was ratting, sometimes for hours - so you kind of cannot compare those 2.
---
&gt;Though the effort of returning to 46DP failed, Noraus, in a later speech, still claimed that their operation was a “strategical success (though with minor pity)” and he had foreseen the doom of the Legacy. 
---
That's what we in the biz call "spin."
---
&gt;Noraus’ speech cast anxiety and doubt on both side of the war. What is this man trying to hide? Is he still holding a secret card or just bragging to save his separating coalition?
---
It's morale posting. The most important thing you have to do when prosecuting a war in eve is to keep morale up. Once it dies your ability to continue with it will too.
---
**FOR THE EMPEROR**
---
Get the heavy flamer brother, we have heretics to cleanse
---
Fighting outnumbered everyday is my thing but then you don’t do facts do you
---
you rock!
---
Damn, how did people just manage to play from 2003 to 2016?
---
Is it really that difficult? If you have the right number of ships it’s just approach heat kill. Oh you have to ship scan it prior sure. 
---
I’ve done a few freighter ganks in my time, it doesn’t appeal
---
By coming back and not having had all their assets vanish?
---
You’d get more traction with a higher IQ and less shit posting.
---
Nullsec, before citadel spam, had lots of suitecase POS, where people stored their ratting ships, had corp &amp; personal hangars. Finding the offline ones always was a pinata day ...
---
Elite dangerous in solo mode
---
Most of people in this game calling them self pirates go to nullsec or lowsec and shoot all stuff to get kills ^(in the place where is no law)     
---
I don't care about kills but the cargo, i did let go people that gave me isk , ejected some cargo or evacuated enough that they became unappealing.           
---
I care about the cargo not the kill.      
---
If this is makes me "bad pirate" i don't care i want your cargo.      
---
Eject it and you can go.        
---
THX
---
So what you say that "you assume it is easy"            
---
Please take over the cargo of 10 freighters  in higsec &gt;10bil and say it again.
---
I agree, but it’s how we’ve had to play the game for fifteen years.
---
Imagine a high sec ganker shittalking a highly active member of one of the few competent small gang groups, damn i love the comedy in this thread.
---
Assets dropped from POS but not from Outposts, as Citadels replace both there should be a border between the mass spammed M-Citadels (Astra/Raitaru/Athanor) and the L/XL ones that replace or exceed old outposts. For them asset safety would be ok for me, but only if they are fueled. Unfueled citadels should offer no service at all, no tethering &amp; no asset safety.
---
&gt;	I don’t play E. V. E. but
---
Then why even comment lmao
---
You go like a man 'face to face' or like a little girl 'running around and throwing stones' hoping you are fast and agile enough that no one is going to catch you?
---
Or they just warp away because appearently you can't adapt to the changes. FYI did you know that outside of highsec you can point people without getting concorded?
---
If they were in a POS (equivalent to M-Class Upwells - Astra/Rait/Athanor), and the owner did not care about fueling, they were ...
---
Also, if it's a drone ship you can try to prove the drones that were left behind.
---
For some reason pirates always bring enough dps to kill a guy with max skills, boosts and best implants he can have.                
---
Something don't adds up.
---
China #2, Taiwan will always be #1
---
Join big alliance -&gt; keep track of freighter movements -&gt; plan accordingly.
---
Yes i do, this is why most commonly i fly in hictors there.    
---
But you cannot be pirate outside of higsec and we are talking here about piracy.
---
Well he started first ;)
---
I'm talking about submitting a ticket before the fact, clearly.
---
You have two solid points for sure: 1. Ccp goes for cheap solutions 2. They go for extreme ones instead of soft one. Your hypothesis is highly logical : next step would be to remove some easily codable part of asset safety (could be: no asset safety for caps and supers as well btw). There is one thing you really miss though. You’re assuming that ccp acts with logic and consequence and sticks to a clearly defined strategy. Experience shows that this is not the case. Ccp has gone in random and contradictory directions all the time. Previous csm have all reported how uncomfortable it was to discuss with ccp not because they had a wrong plan but because they had no plan at all and no idea about what they actually wanted and were constantly doing random shit all over the place instead of focusing on coherent changes. So tldr you’re right but you’re wrong because ccp is fucked in the head.
---
Yes but the amount of assets someone stored in a station was usually far larger then anyone would have in a POS
---
As a moral post from what is obviously a test alligned person I am supriced you did not try to spin the reset of mangos as some big betrayal.
---
Shurely some smoother brained members of the circle jerk would have bought it.
---
Sorry this is RL i tend to keep my games as different from RL as i can, same for play styles.
---
Yes and they will use the mind police to get your intentions!

---
LOL.
---
cool, it's still cancer.
---
people will just quit, it's a bad change
---
Oh it’s kiting you despise. Guess it’s harder then approach heat kill
---
i was making no comment on any of that, but rather that number of players (or PCU) doesnt necessarily translate into engaging content or political intrigue etc. 
---
there were loads more players during the WWB as compared to the great war, but its the great war that people remember and know about... despite there being perhaps 10x as many people on the PCU for WWB.
---
I don’t understand what you are saying

---
&gt;accept that your playstyle was too niche 
---
CCP killed ganking over the last 7 years with their changes intentionally, it didn't use to be niche they just made it harder and harder, forced people to multibox 10+ characters just to make it happen until they finally took it's head
---
Why would you say fight making fun of a gank like that when all you used to do was fly around in cyno ships in esoteria to drop haw dreads on everything. But please be my moral leader and explain what a bad man I am
---
then why do you play in nullsec
---
title is misleading. should be "how to kill a rorq that doesnt know how to properly light a cyno past september cyno changes"
---
And what about after the fact? 
---
Or does that just not need to be considered?
---
it's finding, predicting, and the meta aspect too.
---
the challenge is actually finding them, achieving bump, being able to form up before his friends or anti-gankers get there, and kill him and scoop the loot at the end. The gank itself is a fraction of what there is to do
---
I agree.  Players keep going on about 'the sandbox' when it suits them when it doesnt its CCPs fault.
---
Tbh its half and half.  Players have had to adapt to mechanics CCP have implemented.  And CCP implemented them because of pressure from influential large blocs and throw a big dirty plaster over the whole thing and implement some ridiculous idea.
---
You definetly can be in lowsec :)
---
It adds up quite well, what you do is a business so you eliminate possible factors that can screw the income.
---
The low effort CCP puts into all this changes triggers me hard. Instead of actually developing and enhancing the game all they can you are some simple SQL updates and sell it as the big solution.
---
You want players to "git gud"? Well git gud yourself first. Like a anticheating system thats doesn't simple remove large parts of the content. Or something else that comes into my mind, why are there still POS and all those obsolete modules like Assembly Arrays in the game?
---
yeah, but you should have also fed into him and his 500 buttbuddies of which not a single one actually brought any kind of counter to whatever it is you´re currently flying.
---
capitals cannot enter 8/10 anomalies or lower
---
supercapitals cannot enter 9/10 anomalies or lower

As soon as I heard the music I closed it, you just know the quality of the vid is about -10 before even watching it.

While we're talking about [weebs...](https://discord.gg/thWrsHS)
---
The community is still toxic and full of people telling each other how to play.  But CCP is really causing a lot of people to turn away from the game with their logout expansion.
---
So like a little girl then.       
---
Grow up
---
but titans can enter 10/10 and boson whole site pffft..
---
?
---
that could be problem.... you see RORQUAL in haven and you are in  ARCHON but you cannot warp in and kill due to restriction - rorqual wins.....FATALITY
---
Because e.g. ratting titans are a rare sight in high sec.
---
the reason the old system wasnt complained about, is because no asset inside a structure that you could destroy was safe.
---
a limit to citadel numbers would be probably an optimal change to the citadel mechanic.
---
unfueled citadels should not offer tethering mechanics when low power, but instead allow docking when pointed. - desicion a bit harder now right?)
---
and the fueling status affecting asset safety doesnt work.
---
i have a car acciedent, i am in hospital for 4weeks, i want to return to eve but my life was in my alliances keepstar. keepstar dies after alliance evacs and unfuels the structure. why should i loose out from IRL unlucky moments.
---
like ive said that removes player return ability, and should be avoided at ALL costs.
---
**how about, killing a citadel pays out LP. (less lp than structure value but still an amountable figure) that LP then gives that player isk for thier work, ''as concord want to clean up the streets' it benefits smaller groups more than larger groups. and killing a keepstar would pay out a pretty big number. to those playing, its also a more PVP way of making money. first step of getting people out of pve money making.**
---
Get a poor night's sleep? Your brain isn't firing on all cylinders today. 
---
That's exactly the point I'm making. 
---
On the 10th of September, *before* the bumping change, [only one freighter died in highsec](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78882317/). A non-piracy destruction.   
---
So, there was zero(0) freighters bumped(and ganked) the day before the patch... even though it was mechanically possible to bump them for ages. 
---
The day before, only one of the three highsec freighter deaths appears to be piracy. The other two very much look like wardecs. 
---
TLDR: Freighter ganking was dead before the patch. Your evidence isn't even circumstantial. Your evidence is just *wrong*.
---
Is this a motherfucking [JoJo Reference](https://www.change.org/p/pearl-abyss-fire-hilmar-veigar-p%C3%A9tursson-aka-ccp-hilmar-without-any-golden-parachutes)?
---
I still don't know what you want to say.      
---
Avox?          
---
Like most of the alliance hauling is done by JF and then by neutral chars in higsec (wardecs).
---
You are asking too much of CCP, next they "fix" this you will not be able to repair anything...
---
&gt; He announced that similar operations will be more and more frequent, and as long as WC can trap Legacy in the swamp of war, it will be his victory in the end.
---
Good, maybe Frat will finally feed their supercap fleet and surrender than. 46DP is a pain in the ass to get into, since supers and titans can only jump in from Tenerifis region, thus you have gate them in...
---
I think this dozen is in nullsec /o\ when a guy was gating or picking up ore from the belt miners.
---
How are you losing that ability?.
---
Your inability to adapt to mild changes is rather wild.
---
How did you handle people logging off before?
---
As you said, blackout was a cheap change, but it was overall quite positively welcomed even by nullseccers, bringing danger back in nullsec. It's really too bad that CCP kept going, trying to balance the game with more cheap band-aid solutions, because now, as many threads already pointed out, players are leaving.
---
So I'm guessing Pearl Abyss will come to CCP at some point and say 'Whatever you're doing, stop it'. If PA really do something else than giving CCP employees their monthly check, I hope they can give them basic lessons about balancing a game, like when nerfing a certain playstyle, buff it in another way, so players don't feel targeted and just leave...
---
But considering the huge drop in player numbers these days, I can't see CCP keep going with those kind of changes unless they really want to kill the game.
---
Uh, what?
---
Assets safety needs to be removed from null. Null has far more rewards over WH yet when it comes to risk, the two are greatly off balanced. Removing assets safety from null will be a positive risk balance.
---
Here are a few things to think about. Because the rewards vs risk is extremely broken in eve. Titans are 45 bil and supers are 11 bil. Faction BS cost prices are 90% cheaper than 6 years ago, plex prices are sky high. What drives these prices? A players wealthy and ability to acquire these goods. Due to null having little risk to umbrellas, WH being nerfed, skill injectors, and rorq changes. Players can easily gather the Game rarest items and build the most powerful arsenal without any danger of losing their assets. This is only true to NS as WH and LS had their income nerfed (excluding FW).
---
Years went by with these broken mechanic. Now CCP has new players who grew up on these mechanics and spoiled veterans whos greedy is more important that anyone else’s entertainment.
---
Blackout is good and asset safety needs to be removed. Nullsec has the highest rewards and suppose to have the highest risk in game.
---
If any one uses a deployable cyno they would be idiots, for the same reason we do not use beacons in the normal day to day.
---
If some one sees it they would not kill it, they would put a clocked saber on it. Then scare the carrier so they jump to the cyno, boom easy dead carrier.
---
So I can forgive your spelling and punctuation mistakes since you are seemingly not a native English speaker.
---
 But if you are trying to write news story please refrain from statements like the following "Though Noraus claimed that WC is friendly to all Chinese players (Whitch is actually not)".
---
 The part in brackets is a huge red flag that indicates that everything you say should be disregarded as you are obviously to close to the situation to be subjective and any information put out has so much spin that you are straight up lying to me.
---
Doesn't really matter.
---
Like 90% of government websites have actually expired https certs.
---
visible disgust
---
Sure, I love slave labour as much as the next guy.
---
Or they attack everything and miners are I cluded in that everything?
---
&gt; Capitals can't Warp ~~to anomalies and krab.~~ 
---
FTFY
---
Now you know the feeling of people that see your posting
---
Like he don't know and that is the problem.       
---
Piracy is 95% of times not about formed fleets but about someone fining a target and getting to it.
---
May be the name needs to be changed to "freight cyno". That way we do not have silly post like this.
---
Just to get this right, you say things that make people quit are bad?
---
You don't murder people in a fight... you just kill them...
---
Ok so let me show you bit differently.          
---
Each 0.1 of sec status reduce the line separating a viable target from "to low and not worth it"             
---
Quite often you follow a potentially interesting target hoping it will venture into area that will make him **profitable**  
---
Sometimes at the 2nd or 3rd gate you see that there is no point in following this target any more as his next 10 jumps will be most likely 0.8-1.0 systems.               
---
Now assuming that he moved into the area that he is a viable target - then you need to tackle it and keep the points running, but with all the DPS you need to also move your own freighter that will secure the loot.          
---
One of the forming people need to start moving a freighter and trust me 6jumps in a freighter that need to be refitted on site takes a lot.               
---
Unless you want to say that you need 9 or 10 chars from start ready.
---
Wait, they betrayed them? Damn, I didn't know that. Thanks.
---
The Rorqual is a capital. So if an Archon can't warp in due to a capital restriction being enforced, neither could the Rorqual.
---
Really? I recall that they did that after the fight was over and he was frustrated that someone had made the decision not to engage more fully in a big fight during EUTZ. Which essentially meant that we were simply going to give up on Vale and lose our home. I just couldn’t fathom deleting an entire Macharial fleet rather than flying from Vale to Tribute. In the face of what was clearly a war of attrition and annihilation, it made zero sense, tactically or strategically. It made me doubt his sanity. 
---
That was a few days before the infamous allegations of the move-op ambush and the stab in the back story directed towards CO2. I have to say that I don’t know whether there was any truth in those allegations, but self-destructing the Macharial fleet out of frustration made the allegations of a crazy plot to betray a Supercapital move op seem more plausible.
---
If you want to stay in this WH =&gt; astrahus (without hésitation)  
---
but you will need to drop a pos first. It's quick, cheap and keep you low profile. You only need the stick, a SMA and maybe a personal/corp hangar.  
---
Use the pos to bring the dst with the citadel inside, some scoot, some rolling BS. you will need these ship to lock your hole during the 24h anchoring timer.  
---
final tips : if someone try to kill your citadel during the anchoring and you cant defend it, try to pay them to let the citadel alive. WHers want more people living in WH (future target) and dont care about a naked astrahus killmail without drop (they will come back in 6 month ^^ )
---
The Limited Edition PI bonused Noctis? Yes I have. What has that to do with T2 Salvage Drones? 
---
You do know the Primar has no Drone Bay right?
---
rorqual is capital industrial. you didnt include it so   lets say he can and archon cant
---
Bots can also watch gates without flaw. That's not really part of the argument.      
---
Same goes for players. Watching local or overview is the same kind of task.
---
Intel got worse overall, the functionallity of intel tools remained the same.
---
it takes 10seconds to kill freighter with 30catalysts
---
Dunk is all about the t2 salvage drones and the primae
---
That’s awesome! Thank you so much. I’ll get a sim fit together then get it built! Thank you!!
---
You can petition it. People did this and people just doing this for this sole purpose got baned.          
---
If someone want to ransom you he also cannot bump you forever as it falls under same rule, also you can just logout for 5minutes  or simply say that you will not pay and wait 5-10minutes.             
---
No one bumping for 'cash' will just bump you for hours.        
---
People are doing this to get ISK and if they are not making any they will just move on.              
---
**Again the main reason behind this change was not nerf to piracy but new players that newer played eve starting the game and getting stuck in the structures in the newbie site there is now.      
---
Those players unable to warp from invisible "objects" simply quit the game and this was CCP motivation**
---
Honestly, if they were going to do that, they'd have done it already. I have no confidence they will do it now.
---
I believe that they should restrict supers from ratting anoms, but as much as they don't care about bitch-slapping smaller null-entities into oblivion, they seem very concerned about making any real trouble for the big guys.
---
That makes no sense, mate. Why would they specifically exclude the Rorqual from ratting anoms?
---
Its not thethering should be disabled when any of these structures are active
---
You are seriously trying to make out it’s complicated. It is a valid playstyle but let’s not imply it is harder then it is
---
You're welcome, and good luck. Hit me up if you need more help. I'm not super familiar with Gallente hulls but common sense fitting is enough for missioning, and I've done a lot of that :)
---
Cheers
---
Well, I think subs are needed in offensive. But their role is only: retain agility for the caps. And punish disconnects, contain enemy subs etc.
---
Subs in the end only matter, if one has no sub support. But as soon as both bring subs, they are equalled out.
---
I remember last year, when "the north" dropped a fort in impass right before UALX. And defended it with only caps. They lost the fort, but the subs sieging paid a huge price. Not sure if you want to count this as "offensive" or "defensive", but they didn't really need their subs to win the isk war...
---

‘So like a little girl then’

In the same post. Ironic

The k162 doesn't spawn untill you jump it. Right now the Krab doesn't see anything until there is a scanner in their hole
---
People talk shit to you because you suck, not because of HK.  You were widely disliked well before that.  It's about your personality, not your in-game actions. While we're clarifying things I thought I'd drop that here.
---
except no one besides small wandering  groups did live out a pos , everyone use stations/outposts instead
---
good bot
---
My arguement is that people think there is a constant flow of new blood like there was in 2012 - there isn't, so anyone quitting is bad.
---
At least you tried.
---
Says another mouth breathing WH retard who has never interacted with me. You guys know about as much about my popularity as you do about personal grooming. Nothing.
---
Try new things mb for isk making? Def complexes with a tengu is relatively safe
---
Should just get rid of tether all together.
---
The two times I ran the amount of stick I got for not having a manifesto was utterly staggering. I'd always try to explain the job of the CSM is to give CCP feedback about whatever they're planning to do which is also exactly the reason why folks who have a representative style are terrible candidates too. You just need people who know their shit about one or more areas of the game and can talk intelligently about it.
---
The only thing that's casting 'anxiety and doubt' on me is that I won't be online when we eventually farm FRT's super fleet..
---
Everybody uses cynos. It is literally how you move things around. 
---
What small groups were Rorq mining and super ratting? Which ones weren’t? Everybody was doing it.
---
Tip: shoot it until it dies.
---
ngl aryth's "campaign" always makes me laugh.
---
&gt; The biggest blue donut in Eve is the first and foremost, the biggest problem. Krabs logging in, other mechanics, etc are secondary issues that get amplified because there is nothing else happening.
---
Political polarisation is cyclical. The active player count isn't.
---
He's saying you're correct, there is no reason and that is the problem.
---
Run abyssal sites in your alliance staging ?
---
Made moving cynos and logistics a complete pain, and just more tedious in general. But on the flip side, it pretty much guarantees the kill since he we can keep an enemy cyno from lighting.
---
I don't think you'll miss anything if you take a break for a bit.
---
You gotta do what you think is right.
---
go wormholes. Amount of isk for little risk in WHs is obscene
---
they should focus on core gameplay issues, nit nerfing shit left n right because someone cries loud enough.
---
and big blobs means sub income so
---
How have they made it harder and harder? Afaik this is the only change that directly affected them.
---
Tbf goons could roll anyone they want, it's quite generous of them to let others have space.
---
Interesting - I’ve always worked on the assumption it spawns when you initiate warp. Thanks for info
---
Noted ty - I’ve always warped my tackle and insta jumped thinking it’s already spawned 😖
---
Why not just run them in high sec? Do it away from any trade hub in a low traffic system. Thats what im doing with my out of alliance high sec alt.
---
This would be funny if you didn't try to use such broken english to fake a citation of someone who is fluent in it. But you get a few points for the style. 
---
3/10
---
I lol’d.
---
Recently we had a fight vs a null alliance after we’d tackled a rorq to bait them out. They warped a ball of battlecruisers in and not one had a prop mod- they said in real PvP you don’t fit prop mods. 5 vs 50.
---
They aren't mutually exclusive concepts.
---
I think super ratting is in it's best place right now, the risks involved are very high and an organised fleet will kill you pretty easy.
---
&gt; with my out of alliance high sec alt.
---
Because not everyone has an subcap alt able to run T4/5+ they are willing to just put in HS and not use for PvP ?
---
Might consider that, wait and see is often a wise option
---
tldr: you can't make easy money, so it's not fun anymore. you don't want to put any effort to be better or adatp or anything.
---
my advice is to go high-sec. people who like playing alone, can't organize and adapt living there. null-sec is for people who can take the risks of it.
---
Quickest and easiest recommendation (just mine) is relic site exploration.  
---
-Train your faction frigate skill (whichever you already have:  Amarr, Gallente, Caldari or Minmatar; use the Magnate, Imicus, Heron or Probe) to IV or V
---
-Train your Archaeology (Relic site hacking, NOT Data site hacking) skill to V
---
-Train your Astrometric skill(s) to improve scanning cosmic signatures.  These are the red ones in your probe scanner window.  Use Alt+P to open it, then detach the large solar system map from the menu/list with the signatures themselves, and always keep the probe scan menu open somewhere in your window. You can then just use the F9 key to open the solar system map wlto scan the actual signatures.  Watch YouTube videos and use EveWiki/EveUniversity sites, they can explain better.  They'll also tell you which other skills to train.
---
-Practice a few High Sec relic sites.  Learn the Rule of Sixes.  Get good at hacking.  
---
-Find wormholes, scan them, practice trying to safely navigate and hack Relic sites.  I say Relic sites instead of Data sites because they almost always have better, more lucrative loot to sell.
---
-When you jump a wormhole you have a cloak and invulnerability for 60 seconds, always.  Always ALWAYS right-click and save the wormhole as your origin bookmark back to wherever you came from so you can easily get home.  Learn more later, and fly with others for more advice.
---
-Get good at directional scanning (D-scanning).  Use Alt+D to open, and detach the menu (just like before, with your probe scan menu) from the large window/map.  Spam your V key.  Whenever you're in wormholes.  If you see another ship, even briefly, be happy with your loot and run.
---
You can easily earn 20-50 million isk per relic site in a wormhole.  Only warp to relic sites that have faction/pirate names (Sansha, Blood Raider, Guristas, etc.).  Though this sounds counterintuitive, they are free from NPCs/rats that will kill you.  Other relic/Data sites need to be cleared of rats with PvE ships or fleets' before they can be hacked.
---
It's a fun playstyle, it's exciting, it's lucrative, you'll get the PvP shakes and poop a lil when you eventually get surprised and someone decloaks and grinds you to dust, which will give you a taste of the pirate's life, and if you run a few of them you can earn hundreds of millions of isk and eventually PLEX your account, all by using inexpensive T1 exploration frigates.  I made it sound easy.  Life is hard.  Learn it the hard way.  The hard way is fun.
---
Message Fuben Ischinon in-game with questions if you feel overwhelmed.
---
The next chaos change will be to remove jump fatigue, and swap the insurance payouts of dreads and fax.
---
Yet it is still done. 
---
Ganking a freighter is not some elite PvP that only the 1% can manage. It is not complicated and yet you assume it is.
---
I thought it was a tears generator.
---
Did you just wake from a six-month coma? That would be the only excuse for this heap of BS.
---
Very few petition it. 
---
Trying to decipher what your bold text means. It was done to allow all players to warp in three minutes for whatever reason. If you can’t gank a freighter in three minutes maybe you should approach and heat faster
---
Just because INIT puts up with you and votes how they're told doesn't mean the rest of us like you.  Don't confuse block voting with actual popularity.  Eve was a better place while you were banned - shame it didn't stick.
---
lol every time I undock in jita I see abyssal traces.
---
Typical answer of someone raised in Citadel hello-kitty-EVE. Except Providence before Citadels many Nullsec Systems had no Station, people living there used suitecase POS with SMA, Corphangars &amp; Personal Hangars. You know before Umbrrellas it was actually dangerous to gate a ratting ship from staging to ratting system ...
---
That's where you're wrong. Industry is going down. I make shit ton of money since blackout because I'm paying people to bring things down that I sell high. but money is a tool, for a goal, and it's fun. I don't have fun anymore.
---
Now can you act like a grown up and read again?
---
If you had a based argument, you would have written it ...
---
Yeah but that's generally out of necessity as opposed to the majority of your gameplay taking place there
---
So the issue is a lack of preparation ?
---
Why would you take risks if the rewards are shit?
---
Please, there are two systems where 90% of the ganks happen in high sec outside of low sec border zones. You all stage out of them, if you are burning 10-15 jumps you are doing it wrong
---
On one hand I think you are a moron for saying "easy" money while I''m pretty sure he just can't make money anymore (too much cost, not enough benefit).
---
On the other hand I have to agree with you, HS is here for people who don't feel at ease with the pvp state of low/null.
---
50isk
---
i really appreciate windsigh and his posting ❣◕ ‿ ◕❣
---
True, but it still was nice to find offline POS with some Bil inside the SMA, or even an XL-SMA with a Ratting Super in it. Today when the Citadel is low power, it still is fully functional, still has timers, still tethers and reps. Thats just not logical ...
---
but why is the adapting always linked to dev decision, not players? or almost always. Why did the adaptation came from someone else than players?
---
Because they don't know.
---
They have something they try to go to, have autopilot set to shortest and Tama is a very common path to arrive on that list.
---
Maybe the understand lowsec but think it may just be hype, or they've run so many level 2 security missions that they're ready for it, then they jump in.
---
So form a fleet. Problem solved
---
Well, for starters, they aren't a system thing.
---
The fastest way for the whole invasion to disapper is for people to fight them, and defeat the world ark.
---
Then it'll go away a while after the ark is defeated.
---
Otherwise I think they last like a week, but I don't think any of them have not been defeated.
---
I'd like to thank Amamake Bois and minmatar vs amarr in general for not using too much bling and drugs and giving gudfights to my T1 frigs. (&gt;o_o)&gt; orbit 500 hugs.
---
I’m just gonna go ahead and say how i appreciate all the krabs making ships for me and flying around for me to kill.
---
Please try and continue even through the blackout &lt;3
---
ok, i read again. 
---
it seems you live in a corp/alliance where people (just like you) can't adapt and do scouting, defending themselves, making an organized fleet for ratting/minding/etc, aka they can't do any harder organization than what it was before blackout (-&gt;"neut 5 jumps away -&gt; all isk farmers docking up ), so the life is hard for you and not enjoyable and funny animore. and you also can't make shitload of ISK out of thin air.
---
should i read again?
---
But ... but ... there is no local ....
---
An Orca.
---
No structure.
---
This boi Guristas!
---
come to lowsec , become a manbrawler, flying bs comps at 0km distance .
---
&gt;there was a massive thing about it about returning players hearing about blackout.
---
There were like 10 posts of people saying they were coming back, I wouldn't call that massive.
---
HA! Now this is funny.
---
[internal conflict of your flair &amp; posting combination](https://i.imgur.com/Uzauz2t.png) intrigues me ( ◕‿◕)✿(◕‿◕ )
---
nobody kept everything they owned in a POS.
---
And to counter this large Nullblocks like Goons or Horde actively fuck up Hisec to harass Newbies as fast as possible from Hisec into their Newbie-Corps to benefit from them/have them as cannon fodder for 1k+ n fleets
---
you forgot your tinfoil hat !
---
Just remember to move all your stuff out of citadels to npc stations, depending on how long the break is (or give it to me :) )
---
2009 player here, lived out of plenty of pos's and I was never was dumb enough to keep my shit there when the station 3 jumps away could do the same job and I didn't lose my shit if it got flipped. Your inventing a history that never existed to benefit your point of view.
---
&gt;I enjoyed this idea of the sandbox where you could do everything.  
---
Fundamentally flawed perspective. You still can. Try addressing gameplay styles that are legitimately being removed from the game, such as hisec bumping. Whether or not you like the removal of nullsec local chat, it's extremely disingenuous to essentially say "well I **used** to be able to do whatever i wanted".  
---
&gt;Intel is almost dead, except for core systems and without local you can't know if there isnt 30 loki / tengus ready to be drop by the single fucker with a nemesis somewhere, so smashing v is pointless.  
---
And why are you entitled to know, immediately, in what is supposed to be the most dangerous area in the game - who is doing what and where? Why do you get to immediately decide when to deny those individuals interaction while guaranteeing a full return on your investment of time?  
---
&gt;High sec is a joke, and market trading is run by rich peeps and bots, there is no place for us there. And i like my alliance, and the people i fly with in fleets.  
---
Is there anything stopping you from doing this? Can you not simply shift the majority of your investments into less risky ventures, like running Hisec incursions, or mining in areas of lowsec where you have an active local  chat system so that you can immediately know when another person enters the system? Then you can go on fleets and mine and do all the  activities you like to do without feeling as though you have no  possibility of making ISK. There are plenty of ways to make money in the game. It's unfortunate that nobody ever bothered to show you how.  
---
&gt;I don't want to win eve, but these changes are killing the gameplay i used to enjoy. I believe i'm not the only one, and wanted to know if anyone can help me like this game again ? understanding where the game is going.
---
&gt;Like a drug addict that doesnt want his drug recipe to change...  
---
It's pretty easy to understand. CCP have realized that over the past three or so years the game has been on a downward trend of losing a large portion of its dedicated player base and that in fact what remains has been somewhat consolidated into large PvE focused communities which are mostly the patched together remains of former D-tier nullsec alliances that were decimated by PvP entities at one  point or another to the point that they moved on to a nullsec bloc in the hopes of never having to lose the game again.  
---
Blackout is not the answer to these problems. Nobody claimed it was the answer to these problems. A good percentage of bloc population is **just now** parroting, "the game's dying! so many people are unsubscribing!". The game has been experiencing a massive decline in population for years. What blackout, and changes like it do, specifically, is show that CCP is willing to make bigger moves in order to try and correct the direction and ecosystem of the game's population.  
---
tl;dr they're making it more dangerous in nullsec because it was too safe for the supposedly "most dangerous area in the game"
---
You just triggered so many Nullbears
---
Keep up the good work.
---
nobody said that o.O
---
Yeah citadel mechanics are the worst
---
If you had a point to make you wouldn't be revising history to make it sound like all of 0.0 lived with all their assets in POS's. When in reality they lived with a few ships there and everything else stayed in the station a few jumps away.
---
The only thing of interest I got out of this extremely long thread is that u/StainGuy and u/globbyrebornASS are the same person
---
NUUN is recruiting and you have a heartbeat!
---
We are conveniently located close to null, low, and jita!
---
too much cost/not enough benefit is just here because people used to that they can make shitload of ISK. if they will not able to do that much ISK the benefit will increase over time.
---
just look at this graph:
---
[https://www.adam4eve.eu/mer\_isk\_supply.php?avg=7](https://www.adam4eve.eu/mer_isk_supply.php?avg=7)
---
is it what EVE-Online devs and CCP should to follow? making everybody a bored afk-farmer trillionaire? as you can see Blackout was the first step to a healthy direction.
---
No, I know this game since 2007, including backdoor deals and shabby jabber rooms, you don't as I see.
---
There are even statements from Goon Lead from some years ago, that it is the deliberate goal of miniluv, minerbumping, burn jita, to make hisec life miserable for Newbies (experienced players know how to dodge Hisec harassment) and push them towards KarmaFleet as fast as possible.
---
look at this guy that has no idea how ganking works
---
oh wait, just like most other people
---
&gt;Yet it is still done. 
---
it hasn't yet, that's the point
---
and it's not worth it.
---
No 10/10 Rattlers actually. VNI was too boring.
---
But thanks for proving my point about people trying to shame others about how they want to play a Sandbox game.
---
I especially love when people bitch about Indy/Miners in one breath, celebrste as they see a decrease in mining and industry and then moan about the cost of their favourite hunting ship going up like there is no connection between the 2.
---
well incursion still do create a lot of isk in HS. Can be multiboxed.

AAR: Just a day after the cyno changes, a TEST corp, Spartan Vanguards spotted a rorqual mining in an asteroid belt in Cache. Initially we take out 18 Nightmares thinking that there would only be a sub-capital response to fight with. However, it became apparent our target was a little more prepared than we expected.
---
The defenders burn a recon in cynoing in a FAX, two carriers and three dreads. Then a second recon which brought in two additional FAX, two dreads and a carrier along with a sub-capital gang of Drekavacs. After killing the majority of the sub-capital fleet, we were able to have some success with the capitals, but it is decided to figure out how to get our capitals onto the field.
---
A second fleet of Drekavacs and now Guardians arrive which were more difficult to handle. While we eliminate this second fleet, we have now basically lost all of our support ships and tackle allowing the Rorqual to get away. As we get our in cyno for our capitals lined up, a third defensive fleet of 15 Armageddons and Typhoons lands on grid pushing us off.
---
Once our recon is ready, we all warp back to grid and cyno in our our dreads, snagging two more dreads and seven of the battleships.
---
Sorry the footage is very sped up, we spent almost an hour in combat. We had a ton of fun with this, hope y'all enjoy watching!
---
what's harder?
---
no U
---
i didn't say that mongoloid
---
Nah, globbys english isn't as bad.
---
Not happy where you are? Move
---
Stop being a whiny little bitch, hell, even nanofags didnt bitch this hard in all the years before the blackout.
---
" By coming back and not having had all their assets vanish? "   
---
Well the situation being discussed is someone coming back and having all their shit gone, so comparing that to losing a single POS worth of assets is stupid, why do you keep making that comparison?
---
You could go to lowsec, or work together to build that intel.
---
yikes my dude
---
I didn't didn't tip toe alot into hunting but now I will with blackout.
---
Thanks CCP, keep on chugging.
---
Wow that quality shitpost !
---
Nobody cares about HS. And nobody cares about goonies in HS.
---
People harassed out of HS are more likely to quit the game than to go to the people who are harassing them. In what world you live, to believe that shooting people in the face is a correct way to convince them ?
---
&gt;How are you losing that ability?.
---
the majority of bumpers don't run 9 accounts, therefore we're losing the ability to project power without spending tens of billions in plex and stuff.
---
I aint revising history, you just do not like any detailed position showing that your koolaid narrative sperg IS koolaid narrative sperg.

It wasn't SOE, it was George Lucas who forced the change down on SOE.
---
GL is/was the owner of the IP and he saw the millions of $$$ Blizard made with very simple game machanics, so the greed got him.
---
he's trying to create coalition level content in EVE 2019, the age of damage capped citadel spam and fozziesov. WC and TEST seem to be the only two entities who have the fortitude (and numbers) to withstand the largely mundane, painful nature of modern EVE war. This thing has been going on for *six months* without all that much significant damage dealt to either side and yet they still drive at it. Godbless, godspeed.
---
Man... You playing right now? Null Sec is more empty than was before. The most players that are leaving game, are living in NS right now. -&gt; Less ppl ion NS = less content possibilities.  
---
And dont tell me about really few opportunities with WH which is really small part of whole pvp in NS.  
---
If we wanna thing big we need to look at players/battles majorioty, which is taking place in NS. Counts are dropping. Battles are dropping. Ships/ISK destroyed are dropping. Thats fact. Which mean these changes didnt improved anything right now.
---
So work together.
---
This is an MMO after all.
---
&gt; hyperdunking, gridline ganking
---
please tell me more you have me interested. in my studies of how the game worked in the past i have found the information overwhelmingly focused on null and wh space and not a lot about things like this.
---
You're not going to convince him - ever. He's clueless, and has repeatedly demonstrated it here for all to see. He trusts CCP.
---
You should apply to work for CCP hilmar would love your lack of effort approach.
---
look at this guy shooting targets that can't shoot back
---
RAM THEM BOIS
---
Who did you try getting in contact with?
---
WHILE LISTENING TO BALTROM PLAYING HIS GUITAR
---
We have heard, yes. 
---
Repeatedly. 
---
;)
---
I appreciate guy in lowsec when I started playing who did not blew my mining Exequor and instead provided me invaluable knowledge. 2012 and still remembered &lt;3
---
i would like to throw out a big cheers to CCP Hilmar, unsarcastically. For the longest time eve online had been heading for a quite dramaless death of complete market stagnation due to isk faucet overflow with near zero risk. nullsec specifically being the friends killing EVE. 
---
the chaos era has made nullsec way less secure, so all the people safetly ratting under super umbrellas in nullsec friendposting "lol just move/adapt" to others on the forums and reddit when they post about whatever disturbs them in x location, now refuse to adapt themselves.
---
eve online can start healing now, there is way more pvp content and way more risk grinding high efficiency isk. These changes are purging the playerbase of bots and rmt, whilst the friends out in null that want absolute security (opposite of what null should be) shout out that "eve is dying! (because i don't want to adapt)"
---
CCP Hilmar, thank you for being brave enough to do what had to be done.

---
Face to face always works better for meetings. 
---
Missing the visual subchannel hinders communication a lot.
---
Yes if you had a brain, and did evacuate assets before going offline, or bringing an alt or friend to the new owners to get stuff out or sell it you did not lose ALL. That is exactly the same today if asset safety was removed. If you had stuff in an unfueled structure, you lost it. Perid. Nothing else was said, stop making stuff up ...
---
i love blackout  ❣◕ ‿ ◕❣
---
" detailed position "   
---
you have no position, your entire argument is based on "once upon a time everyone lived in POS's" Which is completely false, people operated out of them, but there based there assets and their characters in stations specifically because you couldn't lose your assets, even if the station flipped they were still yours.
---
Even for that singular example you picked a terrible argument. Titans can't shoot back? Cool story, i bet freighters do.
---
The point is that the Primae's pretty useless these days. Gallente industrials are far more useful in this role.
---
&gt; your entire argument is based on "once upon a time everyone lived in POS's" 
---
soory, no point in argueing with someone obviously lying or legasthenic not able to understand what was said ..
---
so the issue is, i can't move with them then if i don't have the accounts.
---
i'm stationary and it takes a lot of time to pre-setup.
---
That would be a non chaos issue. They could stop them entering anoms if they were really worried about them. They could remove excavator drones and rorq mining ability if they were honestly concerned about it
---
There's a reason I tend to drop into people's threads and try to gently discourage them from campaigning that way. And try to educate the voters who see it.
---
How effective that is, I have no idea.
---
" That is exactly the same today if asset safety was removed. "
---
No its not the same, stations are not POS's and never have been POS's. you are arguing for the application of POS mechanics to stations because you think it would be fun to run around popping stations like loot pinatas because you are so short sighted you can't see the long term damage that would do to a game like Eve where players acquire their assets over time and frequently take months or year long breaks.
---
nah titans can't hit subcaps sorry
---
10 posts, doesnt mean 10 people, and 10 posts is quite a large number to be honest, im sure there would be some shittier smaller posts that never got upvoted.
---
but considering 99% of english speaking/writing people wouldnt even bother posting, this would suggest these 10 made the final 1%, thats a statistical 1000 english speaking and writing people who returned for blackout. not bad number to be honest with a game that registers what? 25k people in each TZ?
---
plus all those who dont even speak english or write it or read it that dont even know about this reddit
---
Some of us got it, and figured it'd be common knowledge, so it's not worth mentioning. :/ While still appreciating it as relevant.
---
Kids these days ;)
---
nobody will miss that kind of shit [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78630858/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78630858/)

or that one [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78733478/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78733478/)
---
i'm so glad ccp removed local, maybe they can finally fix the nullsec ecosystem now
---
To be fair, including panfam whose just moved in and isn't finished with setup and ADM, and whose half is deployed is kind of counter-intuitive.
---
you: " obviously lying  "  
---
also you: " Typical answer of someone raised in Citadel hello-kitty-EVE. Except Providence before Citadels many Nullsec Systems had no Station, people living there used suitecase POS with SMA, Corphangars &amp; Personal Hangars. "  
---
Why not just say dyslexic? Most people actually recognize that word.
---
&gt;He trusts CCP.
---
I had hoped him being on a CSM would fix him of that problem.
---
&gt;people will just quit, it's a bad change 
---
Making people quit is the only proper reason you provided in your comment for it being bad. 
---
On the other hand i should have come to the conclusion that this wasn't what you meant myself. I mean, a ganker saying making people quit is bad would be too ironic, right?
---
I appreciate miners and industrialists in general for without you guys I wouldn't have ships.
---
&gt;and 10 posts is quite a large number to be honest,
---
So if 10 is a large number, and there have been dozens posted by the people quitting it would seem there are more unhappy with the changes then happy.
---
Excluding it doesn't significantly change the results.
---
I didn't say the changes improved anything. I just said they didn't affect imperium/test/panfam less than others.
---
Who said anything about subcaps?
---
I say Nay! 
---
I'd rather see a change that encourages more pvp and encounters. This change does the opposite.
---
Uh, you didnt make a point I needed to refute 
---
The only people that live out of poses were wormholers, they already don't have asset safety.
---
&gt;Making people quit is the only proper reason you provided in your comment for it being bad.
---
meanwhile you ignored all my previous comments for some inexplicable reason
---
And BTW this has nothing to do with a retarded gamemode where you get ganked on the way between trade hubs.
---
You're working under an assumption they don't have the hardware to run hundreds of bots already, which many of them do. It is so easy to run eve in potato mode and on a virtual box.
---
If your active player base is 30 people then indeed 10 people coming back to the game would be a massive thing :P
---
My friend got some new pets this week.
---
2 cats, 4 ducks, and 4 chickens. I think she is trying to start a zoo.
---
He's right, though. Nobody ever said nullsec was fine and didn't need changes, but it needed well-thought changes and iteration if anything.
---
But what it also need is communication : CCP introduced blackout in one week, and then introduced cyno changes, changed the JF plan the day after for some ungodly reason, and let it land on Tranquility without so much as waiting for feedback (see how fast it came from SISI to TRANQ).
---
Changing nullsec is not a matter of a 2 sec database change or removing a line of code, but it seems CCP's taken the approach of "let's do it now we'll think later". Guess what,  drastic changes like that don't really cut it.
---
But oh well, why am I discussing this again, I thought it was common sense but it seems we lost it somewhere along the way.
---
why play suboptimally on purpose
---
\*Alestorm
---
Get it right
---
Yes it just got deleted.
---
I can't quite follow, sorry. Since when are subcaps the optimal choice to kill a titan in a very limited timeframe?
---
You forgot the part where you then throw the whole body into a lava pit in hope to alleviate the pain.
---
Educate yourself please - Upwell Structures are there in 3 sizes:
---
- M-Class (Astra/Raitaru/Athanor) explicitly are the replacement for POS
---
- L-Class (Fort/Azbel/Tatara) are replacement for Outposts
---
- XL-Class (Keeepstar/Sotyio) are a new class exceeding Outpost capabilities.
---
Btw I am totally fine with XL-Structures and L-Structures having asset safety as long as they are fueled (on destruction, not manually). Usually this type of structures are not "spammed" with Low Power, they are actively used and fueled. 
---
For M-Structures, that are spammed Low Power in the thousands, I have a problem with this. They are the explicit replacement for POS. Not only that they really suck as content drivers vs. POS (timers, timezone-tanking, damage cap), it is also just dumb that there is a magical invul&amp;rep field around them when unfueled. That is benefiting AFK-gameplay, which is not good.
---
dude if it's not in the EULA it's not forbidden.
---
We know that in 2014 null players made up about 20% of the playerbase while Whs were less than 5%
---
Based on that and the estimated player count in nullsec pre  blackout ( about ~ 150k ) 
---
Wh space should be between 30k - 40k players
---
Sadly it isn't but good on you for continuing to get elected despite not being in a null bloc.
---
&gt;if you realize, like supercap hunting, the act of ganking itself isn't the difficult part (it's just math), it's finding and acquiring the target in the first place.
---
well that´s a rather sudden change of policy then
---
There are eccentrics and then there are EVE eccentrics...
---
&gt; The only people that live out of poses were wormholers, they already don't have asset safety.
---
Thats ... well ... just a lie. And you know that
---
Preach
---
Lol, just look at Delve kb, or GSF kb. Content blocker? When i wanna do some small gang nice pvp im flying to Dalve/Kalevala/Eso, to their staging and getting content for 100%.  
---
Powerblocks are content generators even if they dont wanna be this.  
---
Youre telling blob, blob blob. Not every powerblock fleet is blob. There are a lot of nice fights with Horde, TEST, GSF and more blocks.  
---
The only problem is super/caps force, but its different topic.
---
I really think people who push CCP to make nullsec small gang friendly is the group to blame, since this space is made by design for super coalition fighting each other, CCP gave FW and WH space for small gang and yet, for some reason, everyone want to make nullsec like they want to do.. That's how fozzie sov was born, damage cap on structure released and blackout/no cyno a thing, which by looking at the data/feedback only make bot and player run away 'yay'
---
Do you believe this bullshit? 
---
1. I make isk in WH, Im part of a null alliance for PvP. Sorry champ, wrong.
---
2. Bots really are not hard to detect at all, you find hundreds of them in space, many in particular systems, doing the exact same thing with the exact same times between button presses. Unfortunately CCP is just too lazy to try and fix it. 
---
3. Yes, I've heard of login traps, done them myself, but with blackout they are made easier because local can't see you the instant you login. Prior you would have to log out where a player was last ratting in order to get a tackle, or login a dictor to try and stop them from getting back to a safe, now, you can login and roam the system cloaked with no one the wiser, removing the needs for bubbles or finding where the person was last ratting or mining. It has demonstrably made it easier.
---
4. I said many, not no targets at all. The data backs up the fact that less people are being killed too, its data, it doesn't lie. Your desire to close your eyes and ignore it shows volumes, but data doesn't lie.
---
&gt; i can't move with them then if i don't have the accounts.
---
How so?
---
3 would be moving with you, giving you 6+ minutes to move each additional one after using one in a cycle.
---
But mainly, WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE.
---
AND? You post a citation to prove that i said EVERYONE had EVERYTHING stored in POS, but everyonae actually able to understand what I wrot in that citation can see, that I never said this.
---
All I said was "before Citadels many Nullsec Systems had no Station, people living there used suitecase POS with SMA, Corphangars &amp; Personal Hangars." there were no quantities of how much percent of assets people stored there.
---
Less people in wormholes. Rolling holes provides quite a bit of defence.
---
Iterative design isn't supposed to be :
---
\- Let's implement something the playerbase is telling us will be completely retarded once live without checking ourselves.
---
\- Mhm, people are mining way too much/only using sword fleets", let's have a meeting in 8 months about that
---
\- Hey, so during the meeting we saw that it was maybe a little too strong, we'll try to nerf it in 4 months when we have the dev time.
---
CCP development model DOESN'T allow iterative design, they are litterally pushing one thing live and we have to live with it. Sometimes they get 2 days of dev time to fix something and back to the roadmap.
---
The kb just shows its crowded. The rest of the space is empty precisely because everyone is condensed in a single region
---
I am a beloved space important man. There are literally dozens of people who tell me so daily, including your mom. 
---
Sorry that nobody knows or cares who you are, dude.
---
I explicitly stated *proper* reason. Being forced to be more organized for an activity that causes this much destruction isn't one.   
---
And a decline in the streamlined business of ganking which has been a questionable playstyle at best due to the abuse of mechanics to almost exploit level (e.g. bumping for a very extended amount of time, pulling around concord) isn't exactly anything to shed a tear for.
---
&gt;3 would be moving with you, giving you 6+ minutes to move each additional one after using one in a cycle.
---
i have 4 minutes to move each individual account, whilst making no mistakes, while keeping the target bumped, while keeping my timer synced
---
it's a fuckton to do and only maybe one or two gankers could pull it off
---
&gt;But mainly, WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE.
---
sure, and now you need a minimum 2 people and 9 characters in order to tackle things, which means that
---
1) there are half the number of hunters out there
---
and
---
2) you need triple the number of accounts to do the same activity you did earlier
---
and 
---
3) your can easily be countered by a single ECCM ship and you're fucked
---
4) you're much more likely to scare away targets before actually even tackling them
---
5) you're imposing much more difficulty and capital requirements on a profession that has already received significant nerfs and is already dying.
---
Why do you keep talking to these guys.
---
I’m a broken record 
---
Spin me right round
---
they only fucked null players. you want to rat lol gl, mine idk dude. you want to make billions an hour in hi sec with your fancy local and concord protection, sure dude go nuts. wh space has its challenges but you can roll all the holes and have your own safe space for a bit until and hole spawns. Null only relied on itself for protection, player made for players. i cant wait to see what happens if they hit any other secs type of play.
---
Sadly CCP is known to make big changes without any kind of balance. And this is exactly what happens now.
---
And fuck, how do you want people to even "wait&amp;see before crying" when CCP is deliberately hiding behind the "eRA oF chAOs" and isn't communicating anything ? Changes have to be accompanied by communication, follow-up, something to help users accept it.
---
Not the "get that and shut the fuck up" CCP is used to.
---
hopefully i can get them to shardani
---
*Omae wa mou shindeiru*
---
For the scout and guy who initially bumps
---
dude if you create a ticket and you get response to not do it and yet you will do it you will get banned
---
Oh this thing will still happen &lt;3        
---
Totally different things happened in both cases.
---
With the current player numbers that's a huge impact 😂
---
Well, 
---
Again CSM know what is the issue ;)
---
You should hear him when he is drunk, but you better don't hear me at this point.
---
So this gets deleted but Omelet_Golf gets some bullshit pinned?   What did I miss?
---
How is an ECCM ship going to counter you exactly? You aren't using ECM modules.
---
You lack any imagination. That's all this really tells us.
---
You hate working with other people, you hate preparation.
---
And you can't get basic numbers right.
---
It's still 6 minutes, not 4 minutes. 3 accounts not just 2.
---
But once again, stop being so bad.
---
Arguing about who is more Chinese is like arguing about who's dick is smaller.
---
The unbiased antics of /r/Eve's moderators.
---
&gt; bumping for a very extended amount of time
---
You need to define what you mean by extended amounts of time, very few, if any bumps last longer than an hour any more. In fact, you could probably count on a single hand the 'extended' bumps that happened in 2019. This is because bumping isn't easy, and a bumper isn't going to waste their time on some random carebear who isn't gonna put out.
---
&gt;pulling around concord
---
This has explicitly (by CCP, and anyone with a brain) been determined to not even come close to being an exploit. You thinking this has shown a terrible amount of inexperience and stupidity.
---
&gt;Being forced to be more organized for an activity that causes this much destruction isn't one.
---
My reason is that it's going to effectively kill most forms of freighter ganking, outside of the stupid that wander INTO an already formed fleet. I've said this multiple times, it's highly likely that around a tenth of the freighters that normally would die will die after these changes. if you think that's good, then that's your opinion and you need not respond any more.
---
I've already addressed your points, if you think that ganking NEEDS TO BE reduced by 90% then that's your opinion and you need not respond any more.
---
Why would you remove hunters prey?
---
Doesn't matter when you have complete control over who can enter/leave the system.
---
It takes 3 minutes for a bomber fleet to kill a fully tank super.            
---
For some reason supers don't die every 3minutes.
---
yeah but the isk reward is incredible, plus you can reasonably manipulate the wormhole so its near perfect safe via closing. 
---
Null would be great if it provides at least some counteract mechanism for players against afk cloak or cloak in general. Like system wide pulse every 30 minutes or smth from a structure.
---
He's a mod replying as to why the thread got pinned. There was no sarcasm.
---
You have no idea ;)
---
CODE?
---
Do they have a permit :)
---
Definitely. CCCP could be handling it better, like they used to.
---
That's not really related to the fact people are screaming that the sky is falling when the changes actually don't affect that much at all.
---
&gt; Nobody cares about HS.
---
Its just that over 60% of the EVE population lives there, Sov-Null-Members are a sub 30% minority in EVE, sadly one thats very vocal even in case of total incompetence
---
I am well aware these two things are in their execution not very different. The frame in which they're happening and the circuumstances make the difference.
---
&gt;You aren't using ECM modules.
---
extra C, i meant ECM, and you should really know that.
---
&gt;You lack any imagination. That's all this really tells us.
---
&gt;You hate working with other people, you hate preparation.
---
Here come the personal attacks after I refuted each of your points.
---
Listen buddy, you don't have to reply if you're just going to argue in bad faith and bathe in ignorance, if you truly are just stirring the pot then there are better ways to do it.
---
You can't viably do it by swapping accounts, it's too much additional load, too many things to manage for most people to do to any similar level that would have happened before the change.
---
You can say "Git Good" or "Adapt or Die" all you want, but if everyone just stops ganking and 'dies' was it worth it? If you say yes, then your opinion is no longer "it isn't a big nerf" it's now "ganking deserves the nerf", and if that is your opinion then there is no further need for you to respond, because I believe fundamentally that punishing hunters, pvpers, and content creators is a bad thing in this hardcore sandbox MMO.
---
This will not affect Uedama activity in any way.
---
Can't say music selection surprises me with anime avatar.
---
Did you really have that any time in EVE? Wormholes, Nullification etc. An old corpmember of me used to live quite good of diving into NS-Wormholes from Lowsec, finding offline POS. Nearly no week where he pinged us that he needed haulers and chars to evacuate caps or Marauders and stuff
---
My points weren't refuted though.
---
Working together is the main point.
---
Mostly tanking is an unintended casualty, but mostly, it hasn't changed much.
---
And the banking will never stop.
---
As tanking gets less common, people will risk more in their hauling, benefiting those gankers who don't give up at the first light breeze against them.
---
I miss gigX... Was so much fun. Eve was in a better place with his form of diplomacy.
---
TL:DR - You are wrong and should feel bad for being wrong. Te game is great right now and if you don't like how it is right now, you are a bad.
---
The game was very different in 2014. And that was a long time ago as well.
---
&gt; I know people.
---
If only ccp provided data that is something dofferent than the pcu. Do they share any other data regardomg the issue with the csm?
---
still not in the EULA.
---
yeah and that 30% people is harassing the 60% other.
---
Imagine... One single AI dealing with all of New Eden's shit.
---
I like how people outside the nullsec bubble believe people are literaly making trillions ratting in supers without any kind of risk involved. Now with the cyno changes the risk is really high.
---
They do. We can't talk about it.
---
They´re real PvP´ers because they make the tough choices. Either fit a prop mod or guns. Can´t map both to F1.
---
They really should have STARTED the chaos era with removing damage caps from citadels. Really all these chaos era changes mean nothing if it still takes ages to fight your enemies. We want large scale wars that are fun and strategic, not timer grinding.
---
I have a super. And krab in one
---
It’s not an excuse. Its broken and you simply got use to the easy gameplay. It’s like you’re a rich kid who’s parents bankrupt and now you have to work like everyone else for a living. 
---
#Spoiled
---
That is interesting. But i can't say that i'm sympathetic. Even if it was officially ruled as not an exploit its pretty close to one being that it allows you to dodge the 15 minute punishment timer that's supposed to stop you from having a ship in space. 
---
As for the freighter EHP thing i think what they were going for was making it so that freighters could be used in convoys in hostile space instead of just JF everything. But it didn't work out. I think they could probably if they want to keep freighters having 3 lows make it so that a max tank fitted freighter has as much EHP as before. So max cargo freighters are much weaker.
---
I can't really speak super in depth about them tho because i don't freighter stuff.
---
&gt; Is nullsec became Hardcore pvp?
---
No not really, it is just more balanced again concerning risk vs. reward. Now space where you can farm 0.5 Bil ISK/hr consistent (anomaly respawn and escalations from them or Rorqual R64/ABC-Mining) per Account is now actually balanced in risk again. If you do not want to take that risk there is other, and naturally less lucrative, space for this.
---
&gt; Working together is the main point.
---
If you force too many people to work together for too little of a reward, they will no longer do what the wanted to do before. You need to recognize this.
---
&gt;Mostly ganking is an unintended casualty, but mostly, it hasn't changed much.
---
Freighters were buffed significantly twice directly by CCP citing ganking as the main cause, and had their EHP shifted around to a better profile directly because of ganking.
---
Hyperdunking was for ganking
---
Gridline Perches were for ganking
---
superHyperdunking was for ganking
---
most of the ganking nerfs were to combat ganking directly, and this bump timer was specifically stated and designed with ganking in mind, read the original release of the change years ago from CCP.
---
&gt;And the ganking will never stop.
---
you're right, people will gank but it will be significantly reduced, at least the freighter aspect.
---
&gt;As tanking gets less common, people will risk more in their hauling, benefiting those gankers who don't give up at the first light breeze against them.
---
You aren't wrong, it will reach an equilibrium akin to an economic model, however, just like any particular economic model, the new equilibrium will be far less than the old one. I'm willing to bet that the new equilibrium ends up being close to what I predict.
---
Does this happen? I might jave to renounce my Frigate PvP ways for point blank battleship brawls.
---
The data proves at the very least that Imperium/TEST/Panfam didn't get affected by blackout to a lesser degree than others. Since I looked at their regions, there is nothing subjective about at least that much. 
---
Attacking my definition of the "umbrella" is the cheapest jab you can commit. No matter at which point I made the cutout, someone can commit that jab.
---
The claim was that the bigger and more organized an alliance gets, the less they will be harmed by blackout. That claim turns out to be false for at least for the 3 biggest and most organized blocs.
---
An hour is quite a bit if you see it from the freighter pilots perspective. Being bumped around knowing he will die sooner or later. If i was in such a situation i would propably just eject or selfdestruct (granted i would never get into it, the only times i ever hauled something with a freighter i used a dualweb daredevil alt but as i said, retards everywhere).  
---
I am very aware of the point of the concord thing and that it's within the rules. IMO it abuses loose rules but to each their own.  
---
&gt;I feel that penalizing pvpers, content creators, and hunters is bad for the bottom line of CCP in the long term.  
---
Not like that mattered to CCP in the past, they drove away pvp groups that had way more impact in keeping EVE interesting than high sec gankers. That it hits the only of these groups now that propably has a negative effect on retention... well, what can i say ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I am so tired of these posts.
---
That's probably a matter of point of view.: for a nullsec krab, it is certainly dreadful, for a small gang roamer, it is paradise.
---
But how many players in each side ? There's probably way more krabs than roamers. So of course, if one change is affecting the first group drastically, they will see it as more impactful that if it was impacting the other. Note that for the game it isn't really like that.
---
Sadly, I must say, you cannot say that the cyno changes and blackout "don't affect that much at all". They are.
---
&gt; being that it allows you to dodge the 15 minute punishment timer
---
it doesn't, you still die every time. CCP explicitly said it wasn't an exploit, it was emergent gameplay.
---
&gt;As for the freighter EHP thing i think what they were going for was making it so that freighters could be used in convoys in hostile space instead of just JF everything.
---
Nope, it was directly to combat ganking. Read the patch notes.
---
E50M is weak
---
Those who forget the portrait pack are doomed to repeat it.
---
&gt;I am very aware of the point of the concord thing and that it's within the rules. IMO it abuses loose rules but to each their own.
---
The rules aren't loose, there is no exploit there period, to suggest so is dishonest.
---
&gt;An hour is quite a bit if you see it from the freighter pilots perspective. Being bumped around knowing he will die sooner or later. If i was in such a situation i would propably just eject or selfdestruct (granted i would never get into it, the only times i ever hauled something with a freighter i used a dualweb daredevil alt but as i said, retards everywhere).
---
That's why you have to define the terms, if you just say "it's to prevent this issue!!!!" without properly defining it, there can be no debate because I guarentee you, 99% of freighters aren't held for longer than they absolutely have to be because of rampant desyncs, the chance loot thieves might find it, and friends of the freighter might show up.
---
&gt;Not like that mattered to CCP in the past, they drove away pvp groups that had way more impact in keeping EVE interesting than high sec gankers. That it hits the only of these groups now that propably has a negative effect on retention... well, what can i say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Ganking brings many many many people to the game, the atmosphere of eve online being a dangerous place is mostly due to the scamming ganking perpetuated by one or two highsec groups.
---
I started a new alpha account after playing eve echoes and getting the urge to play real eve.
---
It's been fun but man alpha sucks after having had an omega for a long time
---
I still appreciate the ability to play without a monetary investment though thanks ccp
---
Why?
---
But EVE is dead!
---
Haven´t your read this sub?!?!?
---
No more content, no more fun allowed after the cyno patch.
---
shame, shame, shame, sahme, shame
---
(sorry overdose of r/eve today)
---
&gt; Go away, people that don't like the changes should remain quiet because I like the changes.
---
Implementing short term solutions to problems does not negate the development of longer term changes to the game.  It just indicates it was an expedient way to get a result while the longer term solution is created.  CCP has repeatedly said they are looking to create headroom to increase rewards.  There had to be a more immediate and likely painful decrease in order to make room for new benefits.
---
Do you know how much 1 rorqual makes per hour now? You are lucky to get 60 mil an hour mining unless it’s an R64 moon. Excavators are still too costly with how much people just try to bomb them off field that using them is pointless. There is no more reward cause risk is too high and takes too long to be profitable.
---
Oh shit, are you saying that eve is dying? This time it must be real.
---
If someone hasn't logged in for 3 years, I say have all their ships and assets thrown into space so they could be picked up by those who actively play, even if they were in highsec stations.
---
Not that eve is dying, more that eve is in a very difficult situation.
---
&gt; And why are you entitled to know, immediately, in what is supposed to be the most dangerous area in the game - who is doing what and where? Why do you get to immediately decide when to deny those individuals interaction while guaranteeing a full return on your investment of time?
---
It sure doesn't pay like it's the most dangerous space in the game.
---
you  can't. 100% sure
---
They should be equalizing the income of low risk wormhole farming. They seem concerned with people making 
---
I have fingers crossed for delayed or reduced overview. Or a module to provide overview
---
Honestly, CCP needs to take this as a opportunity with all the rorq miners and super ratters quiting this is the time to delete titans and supers, what are they gonna do double quit exactly.
---
What you really said:
---
&gt; REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
&gt; Now space where you can farm 0.5 Bil ISK/hr consistent (anomaly respawn and escalations from them or Rorqual R64/ABC-Mining) per Account
---
I can guarantee you that no single account piloting a single ratting ship can get .5B/hour from anom ratting and escalations unless you get god's own luck and get a dread spawn/escalation every spawn for 6+ anoms in a row.
---
Because they say nothing new and there's 50 a day.
---
But why make it expensive af to light cynos? Its OK that newby ships and capitals shouldnt be able to but thats currently just ridiculous. I have at least one dread stuck because its not worth the money to move anything.
---
CCP uses the club instead of iterating slowly but sadly they only have 2 speeds. 0 or 1000 
---
The Problem isnt one change its Kicks in the nutsack one after another in quick succession. They made it pretty much worthless living in null If you dont have enough infrastructure. You Guys only yell booh nullseccers fuck your empires and dont think for a second that someone else might enjoy the game different
---
blackout is required for eve to grow
---
Complete removal of asset safety will do one thing, it will increase the amount of players who log in when their Keepstar is armor reinforced and there is no saving it.   I mean, who else will self destruct their ships for them?
---
Super ratting is so cancerous. I did it for a few days and I wanted to kill myself after that. After an hour my wrist felt like I was developing carpaltunnel, and my brain was numb
---
 I don't know how people can subject themselves to the torture that is Eve's PVE activities. Not only that, but continue to do it!
---
Leave a jump clone in a highsec dead-end.
---
They certainly need to nerf the shit out of those ships, EHP/Damage output/utility. Then add in some flavour to those ships specifically aimed at situations that don't mean multiple turn a situation into a one-sided mess.
---
Could have fooled me.
---
&gt; Nope, it was directly to combat ganking. Read the patch notes.
---
That feels out of touch. I could imagine them buffing the EHP of T1 industrials because that's what new players use but Freighters seem like end game hauling.
---
Citation needed.
---
What do you accompany the blackout with ? Is it a change that doesn't need iteration or other changes ?
---
I think 50 a day is a pretty large exaggeration. I've seen plenty of posts re: the changes, none pretty much begging CCP to reply.
---
Drink! Drink! Drink!
---
All capsuleers should probably take an annual break.
---
Hecate doesn't get a bonus to AB in prop mode so that's as fast as he'll ever go :D
---
Thanks
---
I think I figured out how to bo
---
Also, I know I am wrong, lol)
---
Yeah sure, delete assets of a playerbase that is mainly old vets that invested sometimes years into their stuff.
---
Way to keep the game afloat.
---
if im not wrong, it gives an inertia bonus? no? somthing that greatly increases orbit and speeds your able to turn at, literally everything you need.
---
overheating AB however? this might help :D
---
WH will receive a bad touch too
---
[removed]
---
But also no covert cynos.
---
Yeah it has the interia thing but under web orbiting a brutix it won't make much difference. Heating AB ofc :D
---
local chat in nullsec makes it so you always know whenever you could be at risk of losing a ship.
---
you shouldn't be aware of this fact, it ruins small gang and solo pvp by skewing the pve risk/reward imbalance.
---
&gt;Is it a change that doesn't need iteration or other changes ?
---
blackout itself? no
---
risk/reward of pve systems? yes
---
CCP doesn't understand their own game, news at 11
---
I don't know I think what I've heard for the past few months, CCP has made their position clear.  We're going to make living in null hellish, compared to what you had prior, and if you don't like it - go find something else to do.  If you decide to quit, that's fine.  We need new blood in the game anyway and we (CCP) are prepared to drive the player numbers into the ground, so suck it up buttercup.  New players are our focus and keeping new players will be our goal.  You old bitter vets, go get stuffed.
---
Relax, man. That is my best advice. The player count will increase again, especially when CCP figure out how to make new players stay and continue to play the game beyond the first weeks. 
---
Anyhow, disruption and chaos is good, the blackout is like candy and the cyno changes are meaningfull from a tactical point of view (lighting a cyno in any ship, even a Velator or Ibis, was sooo OP and a completely broken game mechanic). Btw I am sure there are even more changes and additions on its way to the game we all love... Brace yourself!
---
Hey, why not take a break from your gloom and instead spend some of your time to look at this positive and constructive thread about how to improve the new player experience:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d3bp11/how_to_improve_the_new_player_experience/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
But Goons are saying Nullsec is dead, noone logs in there anymore because of blackout, and all have unsubbed (in their case stpped buying PLEX with afk-farmed ISK). How dare you have content?
---
It’s not the cheapest jab - that would be “why are we accepting math with no work from a philosophy major.”  It’s the most fundamental problem with your dataset, however. You have defined away things that could alter your results to come to a conclusion that, while it may not have been what you expected, is certainly what you want. 
---
I find BigBill’s analysis more compelling, mainly because it makes more sense.
---
You started out arguing that big nullsec power blocs were more impacted and now you’re backing up to day just the big three because you didn’t include the other ones. Why don’t you try including them and see if that changes the results?
---
it's a video game, making friends is inevitable you cretin
---
I honestly don't understand this sub sometimes... or how I can respond in a deleted thread.
---
BBTB2 still puzzled how you managed to misread my thread in your first post. We're actually agreeing, I'm using high sec being able to earn more isk currently than null as my justification to unfuck null... What didnt you comprehend?
---
like i think i said above, or maybe on another post, unhappy people are loud people.
---
you can expect a MUCH greater complaint post than anything else. also people who use reddit are salty AF.
---
and either way, im not saying alot of people arnt leaving, they are, even some mates of mine have, i wish them fairwell and stating theyre wimps and scared. like all the leavers are.
---
everyone leaving, the game didnt need, they never put into the game content wise, they mostly were the problem, let them laeve, flush them out. 
---
eve is for those who dont mind working hard, being intellegent, (and the game should reward these factors)
---
not some dumb afk 6year old that could sit there miing and press cyno when needed and people jump. add skill = high quality game community.
---
im sorry, but the 20,000 rorqual players who never undock unless its a CTA or mining. or 'i dont like sub caps im better at capitals' pilots (make me sick)  im ABSOLUTLY happy to see go
---
To add to your worries I fully expect that the first time FRT leave their fleet 'exposed' that their valued allies Snuff will delete it
---
Oh, did CCP release the CSM summit minutes already?
---
Indeed, it was an exaggeration for dramatic effect.
---
Suppose the idea behind it is its not fair that someone able to buy a super can make more money than me? 
---
Think the entire thing really started out as, and strangely enough, also ends at a human emotion. Jealousy
---
Remove the distance part of asset safety. Can only be redeemed in the same system it was lost in. 
---
Better than stations, still more painful than now.
---
What are they going to reply with? They made their overall intentions and plans for the future pretty clear already. You either agree with them or you don´t. v0v
---
Sadly yeah, that's why people should be farming it while they can. It's the last vestige of low risk very high reward style of income
---
get a friend to web you with your AB on, fly straight. (lets say your speed becomes 50m/s.
---
now turn and do a 180 degree turn.
---
now go fly at that same speed with your AB on, limit your speed to the same as it was when webbed, (lets say 50m/s)
---
without being webbed this time arnt you? turn and do a 180 turn.   i easily could be stand corrected here, but im pretty sure you would be faster doing so when not webbed at turning.
---
NOTE: anyone who comments to this saying anything better not say it sounds like bullshit unless they have literally tested it. web may not affect inertia or mass, however it does affect optimal velocity. which in eve should affect how fast you turn when your at that speed
---
Never thought I’d put all these blue mods on a hauler 😂
---
In all honesty : I know I said a few times that I would quit this game and I didn't go through with it. I kept logging in, making some ISK and blow shit up...
---
This time it's different. I didn't login for 1+ month and I don't even feel the desire to do so due to the changes CCP keeps making.
---
Hint : F\*ck you CCP. Injectors is the cause of this shit. You should fix yourself and remove injectors before making NULL pay for your mistakes.
---
I grew sick of CCP fucking with the game with "balances" after investing money in subscription and MY TIME in learning shit for my pixel self so I found better activities. 
---
P.S. - A bit salty cause of all the wasted time.
---
P.S.2 - Did I say F\*ck CCP?
---
P.S.3 - Can I demand a refund for all the time I wasted ingame cause of stupid changes?
---
well I did this for about 8-10 weeks in Impass in 2017, my standard bounty tick from Havens with a (tanked, not hyperspatialed) Nyx was 120 Mio. ISK, equalling 360 Mio. ISK per hour, a DED10 Escalation sold for 120 Mio. ISK in alliance. You had 1 per hour averge. So thats 480 Mio. ISK/hr. Consider the quite usual Faction Drops and you easily broke 500 Mio ISK/hour.
---
Yes Anoms got nerfed inbetween, but if you have a 3-Rock-Haven-System you can still run without breaks.
---
They've done this before, and back peddled pretty profusely a few weeks later.
---
Lol excellent writeup.
---
all X type hardeners, HG slaves, faction 800 plate? i think.
---
thing is an absolute beast. and for sure the best cyno to bring in multiple blops to light cynos on larger engagements. (to then light for faxs etc)
---
someone once suggested cloaks need fuel.. but yea cloaky camping has always needed some kind of counter
---
You are not my friend. You are my brother, my friend.
---
B-b-but without damage caps how will Little Billy Highsec Miner be able to defend his six personal moon mining stations form the eeeeevil piwats?
---
where is the... wait !
---
looks like a RL threat "in and out of eve"
---
It seems that FRT had orders to NOT aggress AOM in Omist region. There weren't any war between them until now.
---
it was a good one right .
---
That would require work and dev time and balancing things we've pointed out need balancing for YEARS, only to be ignored time and time again. CCP does not have the staff to actually 'fix' the issues. I think we're going down with the ship this time. Hilmar might have another dream, though, where Eve talks to him again and says 'What the fuck did you just do, you fucking moron." We can only hope.
---
&gt;  Btw I am sure there are even more changes and additions on its way to the game we all love... Brace yourself!
---
What changes?
---
&gt;Anyhow, disruption and chaos is good, the blackout is like candy and the cyno changes are meaningful from a tactical point of view 
---
Chaos is nonsense dreamt up to make people feel like they are far more "elite" than they actually are. Its a sales pitch. There hasn't really been any chaos, just nullsec getting utterly slammed, thats not chaos, its cataclysmic. Chaos should have been something that engaged huge swathes of the player base, something most people could enjoy, instead we have less activity going on in eve than anything I actively remember.
---
Pretty sure they will be sending out a redemption code via e-mail to get the skins. Patch just added the skins to the game client.
---
BBTB3 has a more complete data sheet further up this this post.
---
That's been nerfed a lot since then.
---
A perfect skill hel gets around 80-90 chaining only rock haven and bombing 2 waves.
---
STFU
---
I hope thats not their angle because why the hell would a new guy head out to null if ratting in a subcap out there now is a death wish. They are effectively making nulsec useless other than hunters killing sheep that haven't realized the pastures are no longer green. Everyone keeps saying adapt or die but ratting in null is a solo deal you cant get 10-20 dudes to pve with you on the fly. What is the point of having null if you cant do half the activities in it because you have no chance of saving your self from the dude the uncloaks and murders you in 2-3 sec even if you try to fight them they dip out.
---
What does that even really mean
---
I've been applauding and enjoying them since the first week of blackout. Go back under your bridge
---
I am curious how you came to the conclusion that more ratters killing rats at a faster rate generates less isk. 
---
In WHs our subcap ratting fleets often consist of 2-4 nestors and/or leshaks with an optional an Eos. It's proven you can get through the sites quicker which leads to high payouts for all. You could solo these sites in a Paladin, but it's slower and far less profitable. Why wouldn't this be the same for nullsec?
---
Sure, but CCP was another company back then in direction and in manpower and Eve was another game. A rapidly growing game for one with plenty of potential for further growth. None of that is still the case.
---
Go back to bed
---
What CCP want is not what matters here. If Pearl Abyss notice a decline in revenue, CCP will be forced to change tack. Retaining new players has always been difficult for Eve, with the continued toxicity and negativity from all of these changes, how many new people do you think will simply not give it a chance? 
---
CCP didn't think this through, fuck over the playerbase, make many quit, then hope said situation doesn't become public in order to retain new players? It's ridiculous. Of course its going to be made public and talked about a lot, even on a lot of MMO sites.
---
It sounds like I’m doing it wrong, I went budget passive hardeners. I will have to give you the fit later after work but I definitely don’t have a plate.
---
CCP is no longer in control of Eve and if Pearl Abyss say jump, CCP say how high, if PA notice a decline in revenue, CCP will be forced into changing.
---
the game isnt meant to be 'oh i can safely travel around nullsec in my hauler'
---
thats for hisec,
---
buy a JF or use JF service?. haul in lowsec until you can etc.
---
nullsec needs to be hardcore to live in, (in general not pvp)
---
the pvp has not changed, only living conditions have
---
yeah also waiting here, seems like a typical  soon ™ .
---
Problem is player retention for newbros, which is and always has been abysmal. At the rate CCP is shedding veteran players, I think they just signed their own death warrant this time.
---
&gt;Hilmar might have another dream, though, where Eve talks to him again and says 'What the fuck did you just do, you fucking moron." We can only hope.
---
Lets hope, or lets hope Pearl Abyss pull their finger out and bitch-slap them into actually realising they are shitting money down the drain.
---
No worries, people will Get Painted again soon enough.
---
it's already what we've been doing before black out, thanks Einstein  :)
---
&gt; You started out arguing that big nullsec power blocs were more impacted and now you’re backing up to day just the big three because you didn’t include the other ones. Why don’t you try including them and see if that changes the results?
---
If you think BBTBs version is more compelling, then you dont get the point. For 3 years I argued that null is too condense, that the 3 largest umbrellas are too hard to beat. BBTB takes random regions, like places where Hard Knocks or Brave lives, under the definition of "umbrella". My thesis would actually be confirmed if those places have increased their share. The entire point of blackout and cyno changes is making ultra condense regions like Delve more like Brave space. You and him just choose to ignore that entire context to maliciously attack the point of the data. 
---
Btw, I just looked at data only for Goons. Blackout reduced their farm shares more than non-Goons. If organization and being large correlated with how much damage you'd receive from blackout, then they should have been the least affected. So even looking at Goons sends that argument down the drain.
---
one of each active hardener, 800mm faction plate, cloak + MWD + cap booster in mid slots (to keep hardeners active)
---
fill remaining slots with ENAM's go as blingy as you want. maximum tankage (DST's get overheat bonuses)
---
If he going to use it then he should know most everything about it otherwise it makes you look like an idiot.
---
I don´t.
---
Please tell us a story from the old days.
---
Wormholers have been asking for site fixes for years. The thing with wormholes is they do need to be more dangerous, but the income is already pretty low because your sites run out fast. There was a talkinginstations recently with ceos from multiple groups giving feedback on this with Exooki. There are also a couple different methods for running sites that have different risk and efficiency values. Home systems sites (includes farm holes), rolling your static for sites (riskier and increases traffic), and those nuts who triple box nomadic dreads. The biggest problem is that one or two people will claim a farm hole and seal it off to do sites. Those sites would normally sustain a small Corp with isk. If you nerf their income into the ground then home sites are worth nothing, and static sites become very time consuming for much reduced isk. This would harm pvp corps who run static sites, and they would probably stop doing them. This means less active players out and about in space and creating/rolling wormhole connections (Good for pvp). One of the simplest ways to increase the danger in wormhole space is to increase the frequency that wandering wormholes spawn. Now suddenly you have a much more interconnected space and the chance of people popping in on you goes up considerably.
---
The worst situation it's ever been in, self-induced suicide by Hilmar.
---
Someone doesn't know the way the world works...
---
&gt; REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
i mean, go on, explain how these changes are ruining the gameplay you enjoyed?
---
Player count will rise again, what do you base this assumption on? I agree blackout has been like candy, with PVE people being the candy and Hunters gobbling it up, soon there will be none left to eat with no one willing to replace them. Its simply not fun to feed and who do you hunt in nullsec when its not cost effective to do stuff out there? All these idiots tell people to go make money in high sec... ok now people make money in highsec why go to null to hunt the other cloaky hunters? Its just going to become a vast desert in eve with tons of cloaked dudes waiting for someone to undock.
---
Is this a response to the /u/cruftbox thread?
---
Exactly. While I agree it is a gameplay style, it misses at least some coujtermeasure, other than having to sit on every gate with eyes peeled at gate and sound up.
---
i have around 200b in ships alone, sitting scattered at many points. the logistics of moving them myself in a timely fashion to low would be hellish.  also 3 of those ships, no docking point in low.....so would have to take further time to sell them.
---
Combination of moving or selling everything in a sudden change of asset safety because i figure i'll come back someday, but don't currently play - would probably be a 40h week - if not more.
---
The Dreads are usually in Belts now, had an Alt in a QFC-Alliance, and made billions with belt dread spawns. Low truesec systems had multiple spawns a day.
---
Did not know that bounties were nerfed, or is this drop in ticks from delayed anomaly respawn?
---
And why you bomb only 2 waves ? FiBos have 3 bombs each, I always bombed 3 waves:
---
Would be possible if the gankers weren’t both cloaky and nullified. But they always are, so there’s nothing you can do. Even if you camp the gate with decloaking frigates/instalock tackle, they’ll just cyno in the blops and bridge out of system.
---
lol its awesome to see people willing to delete other peoples stuff rather than balance. Your right coming back and finding your stuff gone because, fuck you, is a great way to send a message to that player they should come back and play.
---
The CSM has always been a free trip to Iceland rather then a meaningful feedback system.
---
Ladies and Gentlemen, May I present the salty rage thread of Friday 9/13.
---
And getting results is always easier when it's a friendly relationship, rather than an adversarial one.
---
People are more likely to come talk to you about something, if they dont think you're going to tell at them.
---
Innominate was my mentor in 2011 when I started. He is been the guy I went to for help every time a change came out that I didn’t quite understand. If you’re rolling your eyes at him, then you need to re-evaluate perspectives.
---
I love a good rant. Too much of r/eve is clogged with low effort shitposts.
---
&gt;Ganking brings many many many people to the game  
---
Sigh, keep believing this and one day it might become true.
---
yea i saw i knew this crap was fishy. i should stay out of reddit this shit is toxic.
---
I see the wormholers are downvoting your post to page 2. Nice try anyway. At least you cared enough to speak your mind.
---
Nah this is just  the beggining of a treatment after a long disiease
---
It is what it is.
---
Let’s be real, Eoc was a great update. It allowed bosses and mechanics that otherwise weren’t possible, but it feels really clunky in a game with such a high tick rate.
---
getting a super isn't something that takes that much investment these day's you get like 12 bill and buy one, like the day's where a super was a alliance asset or something you work for years for are long gone, that's also why everyone and there dog has a super these day's.
---
Pretty much.
---
Sorry, it's just that you sound like such a boring coward I had to say something.
---
&gt;but you overpowering your target is OK? 
---
Again, it's not over powering if nullbears drop caps in frigates?
---
Now you are on an even footing. Deal with it instead of crying like a baby.
---
Keep telling yourself that DD. Also, EQ says fuck yourself.
---
52% upvote, for a post hoping that CCP actually communicates with its players? What the hell is wrong with people?
---
Nullsec is now fucked for making isk from ratting or mining...
---
Check dotlan and.the npc kills most systems are zero or very very low

Need I go on.... is this really good for the game??
---
If CCP want more people to occupy systems then they need to give them more ways to get in.. more gates etc.  The cyno changes have just complete fucked that.
---
CCP never ever look.at the bigger picture of what changes do.
---
Absolutely.
---
The problem is, CCP is doing this to control the narrative. They want these guys/gals to be their friends so they can dance around the issues we have and know they can trust them to not go back to us and burn them at the stake. It's a very classic media/press relationship where media/press are pampered in order to keep them inline with the overall agenda.
---
I'm not saying as players and volunteers we shouldn't be friends, hang out, have drinks and whatnot. But, when I read a report saying it's vital to the feedback process that this bond exists, it makes me upset that the only way I'm going to get my feedback heard by CCP through the channel of CSM is if they also have to knockdown another wall of having to be co-workers who trust each other. That's silly. It's a feedback platform. It should be pretty straightforward with feedback being discussed with devs, then devs receiving that feedback, and maybe hopefully, responding to said feedback. Everything else is irrelevant.
---
id like to thank windsigh for making these threads. i enjoy reading them every week
---
I know this is a shitpost but on a serious note that would make botters life a lot easier. They will deploy these on pocket entrances and rat safely
---
You can always imagine a worst case scenario the truth is that most gankers aren't your worst fear they're in garmurs or retris they make mistakes they get delayed by something. You can't always save every pve ship but having a response fleet is the only thing you're entitled to when you are doing PVE in a defenseless ship. You don't deserve any other kind of security honestly.
---
&gt;CCP is no longer in control of Eve  
---
They are though :thonking:
---
Where are these new players you mention?
---
Eve is complex enough to have diplomacy. Pacts are written up, rules and laws are created and apllied. Standings are just an easy way to colour code the overview. Removing it will not change the status of allies and enemies.
---
Got em
---
This, I'm starting to believe.
---
It's a way to form bonds and friendships in order to control the narrative, not communicate critical player feedback to the team nor receive feedback it seems. :(
---
&gt;i have a car acciedent, i am in hospital for 4weeks, i want to return to eve but my life was in my alliances keepstar. keepstar dies after alliance evacs and unfuels the structure. why should i loose out from IRL unlucky moments.
---
Well, what if you live in a WH ? Eve is all about risk vs reward. If you expect to play "safe" don't expect to make profit
---
&gt; But why make it expensive af to light cynos?
---
So that they are used less, and more tactically, instead of being very fire and forget.
---
Thanks for the info
---
What are the subcap people suppose to do for PVE income in null now? Your only chance for survival is hope the moment they uncloak you can get out before they scram you. People say mash d scan but this does nothing for the masses of cloaked hunters going around shitting on everyone. Sorry i just dont see how this is good for the future. I used to be able to tell new people come out to null and rat or salvage in a subcap but both these activities are now suicide, do i tell them go make money in high sec? Only thing i can come up with is put 20-30 guys in a single ratting site and hope numbers can save us but i cant find the guys to do it now.
---
Nope, this is in response to the latest "report" as it was titled. Not the "minutes".
---
CCP is in complete control what the CSM say's either way, CCP can already completely control the messages by tactically enforcing the NDA, the idea that the CSM can speak freely or openly about what's going on is really just a myth, if CCP wants to get rid of a particular CSM member for being to critical they can enforce the NDA more strictly on that member that anybody else, or just remove them arbitrarily.
---
I too like random collections of angular metal bits and antenna spars all welded together with absurdly unbalanced centers of mass.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bpirzk/there_should_be_an_alliancecorp_fee_for_the/entplxx/
---
Thank you. I do mean well. I am a bit salty, but salt is good for the wound.
---
Look, im not going to get into semantics with you again. PA own CCP, if PA say something, it goes, end of.
---
&gt;they're in garmurs or retris
---
That was true a couple years ago, maybe. Its not anymore. Even before blackout, people had mostly stopped hunting VNIs with assfrigs, and instead used cloaky/nulli lokis with 30km webs to avoid any risk of getting gatecamped or baited.
---
I tribute.
---
well how about they permaban you cause, why not? rrally deleting assets as way to fix game. thats some communist crybaby post.
---
If you want to create chaos, just remove everyone's name from the game and make players have to figure out who is who by flag signals! It sucks I can just look at a person and see who the character is.
---
I think PA was pretty clear about leaving the development of EVE to CCP :)
---
did you edit it or revise it or something?
---
it is what it is. No fixes, just weird wannabe balances. But apparently EVe never been better
---
I would like to thank Xirtam for taking me under his wing and pretty much making eve for me back in the old days. He may no longer be with us, but he will be remembered.
---
Are you lying when you keep repeating this? Or are you just so stupid that you ignore anyone who explains to you that that's not how it works?
---
Oh of course, they wouldn't bring developers in, but they will tell them what to do if things go downhill. Its corporate speak, CCP will continue to develop Eve, however, PA can and will tell them which way to do it.
---
800's in a battleship like a nightmare? i dont understand why not 3200's. those 800's didnt even get the dude to optimal cap recharge amount :D
---
Indeed, with people on this sub downvoting the shit out of anything that suggests this stuff is happening. I don't get the mentality behind it.
---
The Red Menace has risen again!
---
new players my ass. Game is unforgiving and takes long to learn. NPE can never be good as real NPE is like year long process. But surely those few upvoters will get more ppl to kill and claim its better.
---
game needs adressing on many fronts, then it can retain players.
---
Anyone remember the Hero Ibis from the alliance tournament a few years ago? Funny stuff
---
so blackout in hisec too, why not?
---
Yea I think that’s his point. Over the last 3-4 years null has become the safest place in space when it was originally supposed to be the most dangerous. Honestly I don’t think there should be local chat anywhere, but then again I’m a wormholer so I suppose I’m biased. I’ve often thought about moving to nullsec just to experience it, but it just sounds so damn boring.
---
they do not want game fixed, they just want their playstyle preffered. As long as their fun is had at expense of everybody it is good.
---
They really don't though.
---
The VAST VAST VAST majority of content, even in nullsec doesn't really rely on local or cynos, and hasn't.
---
Which system are you krabbing in? Asking for a friend
---
Nice video of one omega multibox logi pilot supporting a bunch of alpha T1 BS.
---
&gt;I am curious how you came to the conclusion that more ratters killing rats at a faster rate generates less isk. 
---
Because the bounties get split.
---
You have 5x the dps but you don't warp faster, reload faster, get faster drones.
---
You aren't completing sites 5x faster, because of all the above.
---
&gt; The fleet stroke AOM and TEST hard
---
owo
---
Lol really? Why even do this then? Incursions make twice that even with a bad group.
---
&gt; If you force too many people to work together for too little of a reward, they will no longer do what the wanted to do before. You need to recognize this.
---
And?
---
What is your point?
---
Should we make ganking easier?
---
Was it good design that one character could lock down a freighter for an indefinite amount of time?
---
Your logic is only that it is harder, which EVERYONE agrees with.
---
The argument that you're making though is that now it is UNJUSTLY difficult, which you haven't really proven.
---
&gt; most of the ganking nerfs were to combat ganking directly, and this bump timer was specifically stated and designed with ganking in mind, read the original release of the change years ago from CCP.
---
Yes, related to the ability to hold someone indefinitely, not specifically the ganking aspect of it.
---
&gt; You aren't wrong, it will reach an equilibrium akin to an economic model, however, just like any particular economic model, the new equilibrium will be far less than the old one. I'm willing to bet that the new equilibrium ends up being close to what I predict.
---
And now make the argument that isn't where it should be.
---
This, evictions are fun because of the loot pinata at the end of all your hard work.
---
but muh story
---
what about muh story
---
pls help me to understand me, ima special snow flake watch me glide
---
you honestly did not expect them to do anything right :D
---
After the fact implies the player put all his eggs in one basket (or all his supers in one citadel).
---
Doing that has traditionally been one of the most common way to lose a lot of assets for players in any kind of sec status systems, so i don't see why there should be a portion of these cases that gets special treatment and avoids it.
---
In other words,
---
"I didn't take precautions, but CCP please give me tools that make losses meaningless".
---
People lived in null before asset safety and they did fine. It's just that now that we have it, a lot of people can't think going back to the previous situation, simply because the current one is too convenient.
---
You have no idea how far my corp had to roam to find this content, do you? Just shut up.
---
PA has no fucking idea how to do it properly, that's why they bought CCP in the first place.
---
Robotics are a good one, they're used everywhere in industry.
---
While in VOLT, after we moved to Catch, I had a small core group of people willing to PvP and do home defense. For a while, every saturday morning I would put a fleet up and chase people around our space. We had lot's of fun. However, when the time came to reship into a coherent doctrine to deal with a real fleet, there was hesitation because some didn't want to lose ships.
---
At that point I started handing out ships just to make sure no one had an excuse. The alliance wouldn't support the addition of slack (or ping style program) or fund ships/SRP for our pocket defense and the USTZ was stuck in a spiral of less PvP willing bodies. 
---
So I get what you are trying and I do remember it being fun getting bodies into ships and finding success but when it came time to upship and escalate, there was no one there to do it and I got tired of waiting. But best of luck to you!
---
It happens, right up until Snuffed Out comes in system and hotdrops you. The only place with legit battleship brawls in wormholes, and even there they aren't common
---
I've been around the block when it comes to mining. Several years ago, when I wanted to give "industry" a whirl, I initially set up in a backwater highsec system with an orca and 4 barges mining belts before I graduated to null and rorq boosts from a POS before they changed rorqs and I GTFO of that retarded shit on principle.
---
Anyway. The HS mining I did wasn't awful. 5m/hr/account IS awful though. Isn't veld like the 2nd most valuable ore these days?
---
Living as in keeping all their worldly good there? Yes they were.
---
true true, good argument, but wormholes have ALWAYS been that way, since eve was good and dying, and 'bad' and dying.
---
how about you made a change like, haulers and freighters and capitals could not go through any wormholes. many would stop living there, some would quit. and the change it not exactly nessesary as there would be other options.
---
nullsec for sure should be risky, i mean currently it is lol. cyno changes and blackout have completed that for sure. but instead of risky, whats being said is it should be ruthless. ruthless is a little bit far for a game.
---
i think assets should only have assetsafety if they have a'rig or module' attached to warrent it? limiting it to mostly keepstars or fortizars? due to cost. and no matter what with this rig asset is safe.?
---
astrahus's dont need asset safety imo, no one lives in those things they just spam them.
---
i also quite like my LP payout system.
---
It's easier to get them to return than to get a new player to stay.
---
You know he's right we should quit with it all and just wait we will show them we are right
---
Quality post 😂👍
---
do both so ur safe
---
Blue donut is stronk
---
meh space pixels. 
---
Like if you don't delete them you need to nerf them to the point where you might as well delete them ( the route that is currently being taken ) guess what the same people quit either way.
---
&gt;  a constant struggle to encourage people to go rat in a Myrm or mine in a Procurer 
---
SO do it in low sec / High sec (sorry null sec is not supposed to be easy solo money farm) ? Or make a defence fleet ? Use the Myrm as a bait, don't tell me he will be blopped by 50 bombers. Most of the time it will be 1 solo hunter that will drop on him.
---
Seriously, If I was a karb I would not go alone, or move to wormholes (When my corp go for ISK farming they go in a big squad of BS that is difficult to kill). Solo ratting/mining in null is too dangerous now and I don't get why it is a problem. I have another chanllenge for you. Try to forget all past 10+ years were safe-afk-isk-shower has became "normal" in our mind.
---
Yeah, roaming four hostile regions for three hours and we finally find a target. Gimmie a break.
---
Its not worth moving any cap now. Why go from throwaway to too expensive to use outside of big movements? There could have been a middle way easily. Now all you get is big blops or nothing.
---
Have you ever heard of rolling a wormhole? If a hole pops up in the system you're krabbing in, you warp off the site once the k162 spawns, and either role your static to find another krab hole, or role the new hole. I have never lost a ratting ship while in a wormhole, the only people who do either don't have scouts on holes, don't have their probe scanner window open to see new sigs, or both.
---
&gt;its a post of me pretty much begging CCP to do something, anything, to try and stem the haemorrhage that is quite apparent within Eve at the moment.
---
That's literally why we are where we are.
---
I proposed this at the CSM summit.
---
Is it sad that I actually don’t mind this? It’s the closest I can get to playing EVE on the go without lugging my laptop around with me. The graphics are gorgeous and yeah it’s pretty shamelessly “inspired” by EVE but there’s actually some innovative controls for the game being on a mobile device.
---
Aww. This is more what I was expecting, but it's still disappointing.
---
They could have bought ore. Or have some few legit players mining in rorqs. Or they didn't ask you wether it was possible to bot rorqs and after field tests came to a different conclusion.
---
I don't know the whys. But they do have a sizable super fleet somehow.
---
You can see him orbiting while webbed at some points in the video and he's very close to max speed. The reason I mention web here is because when you're orbiting something closely you will always be going closer to your max speed (i.e. 40% when webbed / 100% while not) when you're webbed making inertia less relevant. 
---
When it's a choice between 33% more resistance and 33% faster reps VS approx. 3% more speed while orbiting I know which one I would choose.
---
Ok.
---
Get fucked
---
It also removes any and all socialization among players that aren't a part of your corp/alliance. Smack talk is a thing of the past because to say anything is to basically give the enemy free intel.
---
&gt;=(
---
yes space pixels. sadly also invested time and money. Why game isnt adressed proper and we get just this
---
dont "roam" in a slow warping faction BS fleet comp with a size bigger than most small alliance could ever dream to field then
---
you also see in the video, that he starts to take heavy damage (to warrent the overuse of his reps and being in tank mode)
---
but he takes the extradamage, and starts to burn in, had he 'manually piloted better' and not let his speed and angle go on the wonk, he would be hit less, and needing to tank more.
---
and as far as catching the dragur? dont run, catch, speed into him, be at 10m from him. like bumping lol. and get there and keep up because you can go 0-max in no time, thanks to our friend inertia :D
---
It is striking to witness how many comments a classic doom and gloom post gets in a short amount of time.
---
The doom and gloom meme is both masochist and sadistic, the former because one discredits the very thing one loves (Eve Online) and the latter due to the common knowledge that any reader will end up somewhat depressed after reading the comment.
---
You know, when there is 100% of something divided in two parts, and on part's share decrease, the other part *obviously* take the missing share.
---
What you did here looks a lot like data obfuscation.
---
You can have it right now, just move to j-space system with a c3 static and join a corp with a few other people. Roll the c3 until you find a system with some combat sites and no j space connections, put a scout on any holes into your home, the k space hole, and krab. If a new sig spawns in home, roll it away or reship into pvp ships and go back to ratting later. If a new sig spawns in the c3, put a scout on it, and if it looks hot pull the ratters back and either fight, or roll another c3.
---
Rolling away from content too much is asking to be evicted, so you can't just be 100% krabs (unless you just anchor 50 astras, all tz tanked, and use that to keep evictions away), but when you do krab, you should never die if you aren't being dumb.
---
Eve is dying and blackout was a mistake
---
I always decline "Dread Pirate Scarlet" (I run burners in hostile space) and "Silence the Informant". The missions you can blitz easily with a cloaky Tengu are:
---
- The Infested Ruins (3 mins, kill 1 structure)
---
- Recon 1-3 (10 mins all 3 parts)
---
- The Assault (kill last pocket only, ca. 10 mins)
---
- Right Hand of Zazzmatazz (kill 4 targets, 5 mins)
---
- Cargo Delivery (scoop Quafe, 2 mins)
---
52% for a whiny post that has been spammed in one form or another bi-hourly for the past week.
---
Olmeca Gold cures cancer, get's downvoted on Reeeeeeedit!  :-)
---
No it was even footing before,you just cried until ccp nerfed the opposing play style.
---
They already quit playing.
---
add a RIP AFK mode which kills every undocked pod without any game inputs after 30 minutes, leaving any boarded ship empty behind
---
you spy on me??
---
Just let me know when it gets into hull so I can whore, ok.
---
Only place you're consistently farming 500 mil/hr is high class wormholes, lol. Ironically that is still extremely safe and untouched by the cHaOs ErA
---
nice
---
TLDR: wahhh plz ccp make nulsec go back to being safer than highsec
---
and to add, at the expense of the game itself.
---
I 100% agree. I have been against the panic module since the start. I personally would rather it be a capital bastion module for the rorqual. One of the stated pillars for the rorqual rework was it is supposed to be a field defense ship, capable to wrecking any unlucky fool to dare mess with the mining op. Instead all we got out role bonus for drones removed from the hull and put onto the indy core. In fact the day before the patch a rorqual with, for example,  1.2k dps with empty high slots, needed to use the t2 indy core post patch to get back to 1.2k dps. 
---
I personally want panic to be a bastion module, increasing defense, rolling nsa into it so it can lock targets fast, increase sentry tracking to battleship blaster levels for gardes, and battleship artillery for wardens, move the drone hp bonuses from the indy core to the bastion module, give drones something like 30% resist to all , and cap neuting resistance %. Pumping the dps of t2 gardes with 3x faction drone dmg amps to 3k dps.
---
lvl 1 skill being 5 minutes, and lvl 5 being 10 minutes, with 10 cd on it after it finishes. Must also have a roid locked.
---
Reduce drone bay so you have to make a choice, 5 excavators or attack drones, but not both. 
---
With this I feel it would better fit the two of the pillars ccp had for the rorqual, and making attacking rorquals more of a challenge vs either a waiting game for the panic to wear off or run away due to waiting and a response fleet shows up. While also leaving counter play on the table since it's primary weapon is drones. something very easily shut down.
---
Not really. Establishment Dems will probably screw Bernie out of the nomination again, force Biden on all of us, then lose to Trump. Once that happens, Dems will go all-out on impeachment proceedings so they can tank orange man for a proper controllable politician (Pence) and return to the corporate controlled status quo.
---
That's the whole reason Tulsa Gabbard got shafted from the debates: she's also too progressive for the establishment's tastes.
---
yeah forgot that one thanks. Sadly, it is in.
---
1. Like I said... explains your bias towards the blackout. You want to find your null holes and see who's there. I understand, less effort is better for you. I also PvP and PvE, yet I'm ok with the blackout. I don't watch local and have zero risk for anything. I'm ok with that. It's called a ratting BC. I use a few, cheap and pay for them in an hour. Haven't died yet because I pay attention to intel. 
---
2. CCP has fixed them. They just come back... Why? Because the game lets them. So guess what. You guys whined about them too much and you got a blackout. The only real fix. I applaud CCP for trying something else. 
---
3. Again... you want it all easy for you. WHs have been blackedout and no one whined like this. 
---
4. Of course less people, but if it's daily kills for me I see no problem. I haven't seen a huge decrease. And like I said a million times, if they couldn't take the risk to be in null, they didn't deserve to be there. 
---
Why don't you stop crying and put some effort into it. I'm 100% right on every account and you can have your opinion, but the facts show you're wrong. Less people doesn't mean Eve is dying. I have fun every day. This game has gone up and down over the years and it'll do it again. 
---
I have more of a problem with alliance blues as far as I can see. That's the players way of destroying content. CCP can't fix that.
---
Hey, moron, we were in the battleships, we got initial tackle in AFs, Sabres and a few Loki's ... and held it until the they arrived.
---
To be fair, only a small, perhaps tiny portion of the playerbase will ever set foot in the EVE forums or this sub. Its not bittervet toxicity that is driving away the hundreds of thousands of new players who annually try this game.
---
Its the game itself that is driving them away.
---
*That* is what CCP need to address. Not coddling and soothing all of the vocal manchildren in this sub and in other forms of social media.
---
Thats right, for effective cherrypicking (especially after the standing boosters expire in October) you dearly need puller alts. Find a Station/System with multiple L4 Security Agents, let the alts just sit there and regularly draft missions, decline if timer is up what you dont want, and if2/3 or more of your mission slots are burners, clonejump/move the dps-char, pull his slots too, and run all missions. Usually enough for 2-3 hours consistant burner running + blitzing possible, even without the booster.
---
Look im being serious here. Despite all the shit we're giving CCP, they somehow managed to keep EVE running (on more than just lifesupport like a lot of other old mmo's) for over 16years. Pearl Abyss only game is Black Desert and while their income is quite good the playernumbers aren't promising a long lifetime. By the time Black Desert as old as EVE it will more than likely be dead.
---
Or would it move to the other dominant trade hubs? Like amarr. I don’t want to “end” economy. Just redistribute the trade lines and area of influence.
---
While that may be true, these are aspects of life everyone must confront and deal with from time to time. Ignoring them does far more harm.
---
as to the new players, I have always contended that dragging new folk out to null to krab for the mega-alliances would be a bad long-term thing as, when changes come, they will quit as they don't know how to play the game and have no experience in all the different wonders tht are Eve.
---
Couldn't agree with you more than I do.
---
Yes they're still quitting, but  according to CCP, they have 70% of their devs working on a new player experience to keep them playing eve.  This will be coming soon(tm), preferably before most other players leave the game.
---
Most of them probably got funneled in to the null sec corps.
---
So they are subject to the same bullshit but haven't had the years in game to build up assets and relationships that keep the rest of us coming back.
---
Nullsec has never been safer than highsec. Ever.
---
Balance is not made around your alliance politics. If it's too risky in a noctis to salvage, you can use another ship. Or do something else.
---
Welcome to r/Eve where if it isn't sucking off Hilmar, Grr Goons,  og Grr FOTM, you get downvoted.
---
Yea but I'll move my ships to NPC stations and just base out of there then. Why would I leave billions in a place it can get blown up if I have other options.
---
no u
---
Not at all what the AAR or you were implying. On top of that 10/10 for swearing
---
What does it matter if the NPE gets updated when the core of the game has already been hurt so badly? World of mouth matters a lot in MMOs and if the number of people playing drops, new players will be less likely to try it. It's a redundant focus for their devs, essentially, they are undermining their work by doing what they are doing right now.
---
&gt;Smack talk is a thing of the past  
---
Speak for yourself
---
Unfortunately, the majority of Rorq, super &amp; titan chars are n00bs who flocked to the mega-alliance with promises of riches and to hell with the health fo the game.  
---
Skill injectors, rorq mining &amp; unlimited manufacture slots have (to me) been the worst.
---
That's the problem. You retards think if you make enough noise you can force them to backpedal. It's not going to happen. The way the game was before was killing the game anyways so there's nothing lost at this point. CCP even stated they knew there would be backlash and people cancelling subs. They could either let it die a slow death or shake the sand in the sandbox up and see where it falls. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. See you on the other side.
---
Damn you're late with this. But GF.
---
Mistakes were made on our side but overall op success, Rorq lived. 
---
May it mine us many capitals... we need about 7. And another battleship fleet.
---
I would argue that you are completing sites more than 5 times faster. 
---
* 5x the DPS means the rats have far less opportunity to local reps. 
---
* The 5x DPS means the rats have less of a chance to move away and spread out before they die, which means the drones burn less to get to their targets and apply DPS quicker. 
---
* You might spend more time warping around because you are killing the sites quicker, but you are more than compensated for it with the rate at which you are killing rats. 
---
* Additionally, you can move to a more efficient (less tank/more DPS) fit because you are killing things faster than they can kill you (think how incursion ships are fit). That will increase your isk/hr even more.
---
Think about it this way: which would have a higher payout, a myrm or a Nidhoggur? It's the Nid by a long shot. You are arguing that putting enough myrms on grid to equal or exceed the DPS of a Nid, you are going to vastly under perform the Nid. That just isn't true. 
---
Let's play devils advocate and assume you are right. For numbers we will use 5x the DPS gives you 4.9x the payout (you lose 1 mil isk/hr/ship). Across the 5 myrms you lose 5 mil isk/hr. Assuming the myrm is 75 mil isk to buy and fit, your break even point is 15 hours. In other words, if you prevent a myrm loss at least every 15 hours, you come out no worse than before. The extra stab or MJD you could now fit, or the 5 myrms ability to haze a sabre, a single loss every 15 hours seems reasonable to achieve.
---
Feel free to prove me wrong with hard data. But the assumption that it is worse just doesn't hold up. However I am curious, what payout system re-work would you like to see?
---
Wait and see.
---
See now you're expecting CCP to think this through past the first few steps, and that may be an unrealistic expectation.  They'll address what happens after the new NPE once they kept a higher % of new players playing past 2 weeks.  That's maybe a 2022 development item.
---
Every day, SPVG does small gang roams. Everyday, we see less and less content, but somehow have managed #1 zkill this week. The person who wrote the AAR had no idea how long we'd been out trying to find content. We just batphoned Seddow when we did.
---
We will just have CCP deploy the triglavians again, don't worry.

i was traveling through 0.5 sec for a soe mission in my merlin. a gate camper tried to put some type of jammer on me, but it failed. i would like to thank rngesus or whatever saved me. amen.
---
You obviously never flew with him. (idiot)
---
so? I can only comment on the information I have. I like your posting though...shows your shining character
---
You don't micromanage at the corporate level. You state goals and say "Meet this goal". It's up to the people working directly with it on how to handle it. PA is not going to make a call to CCP and say "Reverse the Blackout changes". It's not going to happen. If you think that then you know nothing about how corporate management works.
---
Jump clone to high sec. Death clone back home. By doing it away from any trade hub in a low traffic system you should be somewhat safe from war targets and you have local to see if any is there.
---
If I was part of their marketing team right now, I would be sounding every alarm I had available to me. Trying to come back from a mass-player backlash and attract new players is just ridiculous. Pleasing players increases player retention, especially in the age of instant satisfaction pick up and drop games.
---
Hey I agree with you. Most don't take time to calculate their own stats, so they just interpret someone else's stats however they want to spin their own agenda. It's just politics. 
---
Keep up the good work. Cheers.
---
Yea I chuckled.

I'm on the edge of my seat
---
I don't need to win a seat on the space student council, then quit because it was too mean to feel good.  Nor do I need to constantly tout the successes of others as if they are my own.  I do what I want and take solace that it's enough for me.  Your only accomplishment was getting your name on a ballot.  And you couldn't even finish that.  
---
Appreciate the mom joke though - that's original.
---
His only real wrong decision was trusting The Judge.
---
Did you calculate your own stats or are you just interpreting his stats and accepting them?
---
You've made my point for me - your issue isn't with "super cap umbrellas."  It's with the three biggest nullsec empires.  
---
You ask the average hunter, they are not complaining about three areas of space being too condensed and safe - they're complaining about having caps dropped on them everywhere.  They don't care if it's in Delve or if it's in Malpais - if it happens, they lose and they get no content.  That's what drove the cyno changes, not the desire to nerf three big bloc alliances. 
---
How did you look at the data "only for Goons?"  You are using Delve has a placeholder for "all Goons" despite the fact that Goons are all over the place, including in highsec and other areas beyond Delve.
---
This is the problem with what you're doing - your datasets are fucked up, your definitions are fucked up, and the result is you keep coming to a fucked up conclusion that flies in the face of common sense. 
---
The RL was a joke, dude. You know that.
---
PL should be revised to PH, I will make the edit for you

&gt; If i started to play as a F2P clone (who DOES NOT KNOW how to play the game), how hard would it be to earn enough to upgrade?
---
You won't. Plan to pay via CC for several months and expect a lot of dumb fuckers asking ccp to make the game harder to play for free because most countries have an average I.Q. under 110.
---

---
Can we get a filter for Blackout propaganda posts? This shit is getting ridiculous.
---
And sometimes the bling fit abyss runners gets ganked.
---
I'm not sure where you've worked but this is nonsense. With companies who are failing to meet multiple goals direct intervention is a corporate avenue that is taken quite a lot of times. Multiple times in gaming companies, the over-arching corporate "higher ups" will place people directly in production offices to oversee matters too.
---
Spreadsheet is (just a little bit) outdated and does not contain the last changes, f.e. in "The Assault" you will now have to kill the complete last pocket not just only the left spawn. Strangely the other changes are included, as the sheet does not contain "Atack of the Drones" or "Gone Berserk" that were changed from having to kill only one trigger branch to kill all.
---
quants!
---
Oh look another shit tier goon post about player count
---
Don't fall off now.
---
premium afk gameplay
---
Will pretend to be a satisfied customer for a percentage of the take.
---
Can you please define what is considered "Goon" and what "Goon regions" are?
---
That's more of an effect in goons or TEST, but there are still as good chunk of it that is either old vets with less playtime that got into a titan, or people that had already one or more before rorqual were changed.
---
Yes, Titans are more accessible now, but remember that even with lowered ore price and added quickness to mine it, skills injector are still pricey enough to be ahigh barrier for anyone without a cash cow or mom's credit card.
---
I want to throw some huge love and appreciation out there for Eve Scout and their tireless work scanning down WH sigs in Thera.  You guys make 100% of my gameplay possible and provide a huge service to the community.  Also, lots of thanks to CCP for even making Thera—such a cool idea and probably one of my favorite elements in all NE
---
Nope, but I remember the streamer who had a 12 bil Ibis filled with purple mods who nearly took down an 8 interceptor fleet while solo.
---
for someone this arrogant and praising of your corp you have pretty shite killboard dude. didnt even saw small gang content on the first 3 pages. not sure if there is any weight behind any of the stuff you type tbh
---
Next up in this edition of ~~'cHaOs'~~ insanity online. Removal of asset safety. Surrreeeee they'll come back. It was all foretold in a dream Hilmar had.
---
Why not just stop playing if you are not happy? It's a sandbox game, it's up to you to find your fun in it...
---
I feel like they have been communicating lots of the changes happening and taking time to listen to the community and feedback. I see this with youtube videos they post, emails and polls and surveys and throughout the events they host. Just because you don't see CPP implementing the changes that YOU want to see doesn't mean they aren't listening or acting. Just because you aren't hearing what YOU want to hear from them doesn't make them silent.
---
I have plenty more accomplishments than that - I have guys like you following me around begging for my attention. 
---
Feels good. Now you have a story to tell your grand kids. Brisc talked to me once.
---
How to use words and not say anything.
---
No. Local gets blacked out by CCP, reddit gets blacked out by shitposts about it. Such is the natural order of things.
---
Yes, they are extremely mild.
---
Uhhh, why don't you do this region by region, rather than goons vs non-goons, because there is more non-goon space than goon space.
---
I wake up early to get some studying in.  While I study I often have my orca character up mining a little bit in the background.  The orca has decent boosts so I was thinking I could be nice and have an open fleet that people can join to get value from the boosts. 
---
I know this can go horribly wrong as  an open hi-sec fleet will attract gankers and bumpers:
---
  a) I will make sure neither my fleet or maintenance hangar are open to fleet mates
---
  b) I will be running green safeties
---
  c) when said gankers and bumpers show up I will recall drones and warp to structure without armed response.
---
Im wondering what I am missing.  How can I get burned that isnt the obvious "They show up with enough with enough firepower to drop the orca before concord gets involved"
---
Is there anything like "If I am providing boosts and someone attacks a bumper now I am combat flagged" or the like?  Does it matter if the boosts are mining or also include shield?
---
If it looks like a gank is imminent and I call in another character with a scythe to rep the orca will that cause issues?
---
Thanks, -egb
---
I just love how people downvote this guy out of principle and think the rest of us won't expand the post manually and read what he says. And when we do, it's the exact same group of people that keep replying to him and raging under the downvoted comment, lol.
---
This is not your internal alliance forums guys, people will disagree with you and will want different opinions and perspectives other than the prescribed narratives from your fireside chats and SOTAs with your leadership. Deal with it and stop being butthurt little Goebbels trolls.
---
As for the actual OP, the data set is imperfect for sure. This is because we simply don't have as many months of blackout as months without it to compare. So if you want to keep things simple, there are two ways to go about it.
---
You can compare a couple of months either side of the blackout and risk having significant outliers influencing all of the data because you are only averaging over the short-term. Eg, the Tribute fights when Goons were in deployment would probably affect that data by a lot.
---
Or you can do what the OP did and get an imperfect comparison with at least part of the data (the pre-blackout part) being averaged over a longer time. Then you compare it with the post-blackout data which you know will be prone to influence by outliers, because it's only been running for a couple of months. The pre-blackout data is more accurate this way, but it is compared to post-blackout data that are not enough to guarantee the same level of accuracy. So you cannot get 100% concrete results.
---
But what you can definitely get is a trend, and that's quite important:
---
"This is what's been happening in the years before the blackout, and this is how it changed in the months since the blackout. We'll see how it goes from here."
---
That's what this analysis says and it's quite simple.
---
And the trend is not only visible, but it also damages the usual "but muh little guy" narrative.
---
The fact that people are so hung up over the exact definition of an umbrella region is just dancing around words at this point, trying to throw up a smokescreen in hopes that the trend gets buried under the screeching and the narrative maintained. 
---
The guy could have just said "areas with biggest/most oppressive super blobs that discourage roaming the most" or simply named a bunch of specific regions instead of saying "umbrella regions"in general, and he could have sidestepped that argument entirely. That's how robust it is, lol.
---
Sure, the data sets are imperfect, we need more data (which means more blackout to collect it), and the methodology is not rock solid to get concrete conclusions.
---
But a trend is there.
---
Will it continue? Nobody knows. But is it there now? Oh yes it is.
---
And then you saw the warning on my killboard, and Vily's killboard, where we recently got killboard bombed by wormholers. 6,000 ships we never flew, to be exact. Also, get fucked again.
---
To your point I think the use of "this will help goons more" or "this will hurt the little guy more" is a meme at this point and doesnt mean a thing. Both can be added to the extensive list of Eve platitudes like "made you form" "they blobbed us" "won the isk war" or whatever.
---
Did he atleast kill some?
---
Care to point directly to some of those communications for me, with regards to how they will fix the current clusterfuck that is happening? I will wait.
---
I would agree on local if it wasn't for scouting. And even there I'd say it's a good thing to have more uncertainty but it's actually AIDS in reality.
---
As for cynos, tell that to every major coalition trying to wage wars.
---
But gotg picked up a lot of pace in falling apart as well I  that time.
---
Goons vs. The Rest of Eve, this time for *Science*
---
Thanks.
---
&gt; Most don't take time to calculate their own stats
---
Most don't even take time to interpret someone else's stats. They just take their preferred propagandist's words as a given and parrot them. It is unclear whether the propagandist himself has reliable data or proof :)
---
Probably because the GSM has been using their position there to meta in-game events.  
---
But, that goes against the narrative that they (CSM) cares about the health of the game
---
na i just checked the first 3 pages. the total *dangerous* doesnt matter to much to tell if someone is good or not
---
Local reps are a joke, the rats barely rep to begin with.
---
Rats rarely spread out anyway as most ships orbit rather than sort it still, this causes the npcs to corral themselves near the spawn point except the odd battleship once in a while.
---
The rate you are completing sites isn't faster than the rate at which the bounties are split. This is the very crux of the issue.
---
You might kill rats 5x as fast but due all the things you are not doing 5x faster you are not obtaining 5x the income due to having an increased proportion of tour time as dead time as you transition between waves, and sites. However you are still having to split this income 5 ways, still.
---
The fits don't really get more efficient. Most are already packing 3 damage mods etc. Diminishing returns means any extra is essentially a wasted slot.
---
On top of that, it assumes there are always other people on at exactly the same time as you who can group up with.
---
Yeah, think he got 6 of them before dropping. It had an insane shield resists and a very good active regen rate. Dps was only around 400, but his tank was something like 40k ehp with 1200 dps needed to break it.
---
nah  ccp changed it
---
Hisec abyssals also break 500 mil/hr, with almost zero risk lol.
---
Wow! That's insane and a lot of fun
---
&gt; To your point I think the use of "this will help goons more"
---
Really? I've seen that kind of reasoning being used seriously to argue against any kind if change.
---
you're referring to the way I got % notable nullsec value mined, and I apologize for not being more clear on how I derived these numbers.
---
The first value is derived of total nullsec mined / all mined
---
The notable nullsec was notable nullsec mined / all mined
---
I generated the % from subtracting one from another.
---
12 billion (delve price I assume)s, plus the fit, plus the skill injectors required to use it. Still account to a lot in today's term.
---
You should stop considering every player as a 10 alts rorqual army by himself.
---
Well, it should be for a $120 ibis lol
---
Honestly if it's black out that's killing your game then take a break. It won't last forever. They will eventually turn it back on in some capacity either with new stations or as a delayed mechanic.
---
Ok, I'll try it the long way. You're an idiot.
---
THIS IS FUNY BECAUSE IT MEANS UR A NEWB TO CUZ THERE ARE ONLY 2 IBUSES (IBI?) IN TEH PICTURE YES
---
To me it seems more likely that bots did use local out of convenience. Now that it's changed they wait for improved botting software before going back to business.
---
I doubt any notorious botter has a change of heart because of the blackout.
---
CCP can do what they want. Always have and never cared to satisfy everyone. There's always a group of disgruntled players that refuse to adapt and go with the flow. They end up leaving... why should anyone care about them? 
---
You think this is just about local? Sorry mate. CCP wants to change the kind of players who make up Eve and frankly, I'm all for it. 
---
Anyone screaming about content should take a look at their coalition of blues and figure out why that is. Look at all that red content there.
---
well that sucks, what do you get now?
---
Wow, thanks! Your kind of conclusions is exactly what I wanted to derive. I already accept that the data is imperfect, merely due to we just had 2 months of blackout and who knows how the farmshares will shift over time.
---
I hear it constantly myself as well and stand by what Ive said above. Data is what matters and I hope our friends on the island are keeping a keen eye on it and are ready to shift gears when and where necessary.
---
The problem is, and for those who have not helped to run an alliance before, the work that goes into everything is tiring. To have other issues with CCP fucking around with everything makes it even harder to plan campaigns against enemies. Essentially, these changes make it harder to get wars. The cyno changes make it harder to escalate fights. You may think these changes will be good for eve, but in the grand scheme of things, they are bad for large wars - which is what attracts most people to this game.
---
&gt;I think the use of "this will help goons more" or "this will hurt the little guy more" is a meme at this point   
---
It is, sadly it is one some people on both sides take serious for whatever reason.
---
Only a noob if you’re still flying a frigate
---
yeah, for a while it was. not all of nullsec. but some of it for sure.
---
why? Because I am calling u out that you are crying that there is not enough content. thats pretty low coming from some TEST guy or is it that you are the idiot?
---
You actually just said the exact same thing : blackout is not a change that lives with itself, it is needed to add correction to other things impacted by it.
---
Things that may or may not be implemented by CCP, ever. That's why you NEVER implement a change on a system that is dependent on another, or which a system is dependent on, without doing the rest at the same time.
---
Like a few weeks ago before even more people quit? They are focused on NPE but that focus is completely redundant when they are losing more players than they gain per week, and word of mouth from current players is "CCP are fucking things up", turning players away even more.
---
i appreciate you and yours
---
That always makes me wonder. How could someone who used to have 100 VNI bots suddenly scale up to 200 lvl4 runners.      
---
I would have thought he'd use his whole capacity for VNI bots to begin with.
---
what if the people leaving are bot accounts and alts, and we're simply correcting to an accurate representation of the eve playerbase?
---
Just because I am someone with some insights in software desig, QA and so on, and with 12 years of experience in all areas of EVE except consistant wormhole life and write based comments, often with very objective factlists that everyone can check if not lazy, i am an asshole? Btw, I was in Legacy FC discord, its hard to find another discord with that rate of ashemed facepalming ...
---
Yeah because 20bil ships doing highsec missions last so long.
---
Indeed, veld is per cargo hold the best isk/load.  If you mine in a barge, you lose alot of time in the back and forth.  Your recollection about multiple accounts is the only way mining becomes profitable, because you take the running around out of the equation.  But, even then, if you divide the total payout by the number of characters you have actively participating, it's not that much better.
---
With 5 accounts and an uninterrupted ice belt, I can clear about 1500 ice, give or take, which equates to about 300mil, divide that by 5 and you get 60mil per toon.  However that rarely happens, and ice belts are very competitive, with ganky squatters, CODE, or bumpers almost everywhere.
---
Nah, its never been the case, ever. It's just some people would like you to think that. Even with umbrellas, fast hit and runs have been worth while. Destroying mining drones etc... is worth while. Killing ratters and escalating to drop dreads etc.
---
What if I got a wining lottery ticket?
---
Same answer. It would be nice, but we  both know it ain't what's going on.
---
&gt;They are focused on NPE but that focus is completely redundant when they are losing more players than they gain per week   
---
The biggest loss is from the low retention rate. How many was it that keep playing? 10%?
---
The stats are spectacularly dumb, even for you.  Do you take account of the fact that Goon space is the high point and that non-Goon space with little existing mining going on is unlikely to see a fall with this change?  I mean seriously... relationships aren't always (even often) linear.  Check out the MER and then see that most regions are rounding error on Delve.
---
According to CCP Hilmar, your not supposed to like these changes. It is deliberate, disruptive and was intended to drastically negatively impact all of Nullsec's ability to make isk.
---
CCP expects you to freely expose yourself to blind risk for the sake of making isk. No warning, no local, no cyno... (without WH limitations). 
---
So while I don't want to say... Fuck EVE... EVE basically just said... no, fuck you.
---
I suspect any innovative tactics that counter that effort will get nerfed into the ground.
---
No, they don't, but they are rare too.
---
hurr
---
I already assume everyone in the system has cloaky eyes and know that I'm in the system. Doesn't change my game at all whether I talk in local or not. I might even get more content by shouting there.
---
1. If you go in with an antagonistic attitude, you will be shut out. They do not have to listen to you. You get further with honey than vinegar. 
---
2. The relationships built are what makes it possible to get things done. I will listen to somebody I know and trust who isn't a douche before I will listen to some random person who is always an asshole to me, regardless of who they are. 
---
3. The NDA makes it almost impossible for the CSM to be honest and forthright about what they said and how they said it in these meetings. They can't come back and tell you the things they saw in full detail. That's not the nature of the organization. I dislike that, because I think transparency is better for everybody, but CCP wants to control the message and that's understandable. It's their party.
---
4. Dunk's post was pretty good, even if it was skimpy on details. But we didn't expect it to include details, because we all know he can't give them. The minutes will be out in a few weeks and you can see more of what happened.
---
&gt; You've made my point for me - your issue isn't with "super cap umbrellas." It's with the three biggest nullsec empires.
---
Thats true.
---
&gt; How did you look at the data "only for Goons?" You are using Delve has a placeholder for "all Goons" despite the fact that Goons are all over the place
---
Their farm isn't all over the place. The majority of it is in Delve/Querious. As for other regions, they are really not problematic.
---
&gt; You ask the average hunter, they are not complaining about three areas of space being too condensed and safe - they're complaining about having caps dropped on them everywhere.
---
I think I have the rights to call what the average hunter has been complaining about. It's definitely not the Brave space or Hard Knocks space. Its places where you constantly get gatebosoned, and dropped an unmanageable amount of capitals (not just a few).
---
&gt; This is the problem with what you're doing - your datasets are fucked up, your definitions are fucked up, and the result is you keep coming to a fucked up conclusion that flies in the face of common sense.
---
Here, this guy sees right through how cheap and trivial your criticisms are, and even elaborates on it better than I ever can.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d3f9bi/data_does_blackout_really_hurt_the_small/f049zpv/?context=3
---
so all of those in person interviews with hilmar and falcon on exactly what they're doing and why they're doing it dont count eh?
---
why dont you go watch those interviews, read the dev blogs, and literary interviews. then return claiming they have not communicated.
---
or is it simply they havent said what you wanted to hear? i think that is more likely.
---
There should just be special very difficult sites for capitals. It’s dumb that there is no sites with capital ships. If your adm reaches military 5 you should start to spawn capital ship sites and they should be hard.
---
From what I understand, CPU is the biggest issue, since turning the graphics off in eve is not difficult.
---
They nerfed Null to Null holes.
---
Are you doubling down on yesterday's stupidity?
---
The roaming content is drying up in nullsec. I lead a pvp corp. We see it every day, yet we still try. You want content now? Go to an alliance staging system. It was never, eve as bad as it is now for roaming content. Everyone is turtling up, just like people with brains here said they would. We don't mind blackout as a corp. We care that the roaming content isn't there like it used to be a few months ago, and with the server numbers we know why.
---
Meanwhile they add battleship sites to high sec..... wtf
---
Globby is a guy who’s created entirely new methods of ganking, coordinated hundreds of players over various fleets to do different types of activities in nullsec, highsec, and lowsec. He has earned his voice, and uses deep understanding of the game paired with his actual experiences to make recommendations (while yes, also sometimes shitposting.)
---
What have you done, StainGuy, to equate yourself to him? The only reason you’ve shared kills with Globby is that you’re a nameless goon line member who goes to events like “Burn Jita” and became famous for overplaying a reddit meme.
---
I've watched them, they are bullshit, the aspect where Hilmar says people are not risk adverse because they've moved to a 64 bit client, like what?!?!?! You take that stuff as worth while? Its utter crap. 
---
None of that stuff addresses what is happening now, it simply doesn't.
---
Non goon space includes a lot of active space. Test, frat, panfam, gotg, mangos - should i go on? Do you want to tell me these entities don't mine a lot?
---
It politics it all toxic but if you stay out your voice will never be heard to point out problems with what presented.
---
Then they should expect the player-base to say fuck you back, and their focus on the NPE will be completely undermined because of it.
---
This data seems correct from my napkin math, but you are excluding a very important detail that Goons were deployed in the month of June and there for mining value was severely devalued.
---
I rate this comment as **Half-True**.
---
I've been playing for 3 almost 4 years, I know I'm a noob
---
And how many will start playing when a large amount of the playerbase is telling them the game is not worth it?
---
The problem isn’t the NPE it’s what happens after, either plug through shitty missions that haven’t changed in a decade or bore yourself to tears mining in a venture with no clear path or direction and a Corp recruitment system that sucks ass.
---
Not even the dumbest titan story for me in the past year tbh 
---
The other one somehow lived tho
---
Maybe just dont open posts like this and dont make comment?
---
Eyyyyyy nice
---
hello everyone :)
---
our corp has come back to the game due to the recent changes and have been having a great time shooting at our friendly neighborinos
---
i hope everyone else has been having a good time both in game and irl 😊
---
I hope so too. 
---
And I'll remind them your comment whenever people seriously make the above point now.
---
It's possible to introduce diminishing returns to growing larger anr larger. As long as we meet at that point; you know I'm actually as worried as you are about players leaving by specific changes.
---
I didn't know 400 DPS on an ibis was even possible
---
No need to tell me what I experiance every day aswell. I have a big advantage tho. As i am only in a small alliance no one is scared of us. This why your crying is so cringe. leave test. setup shop with your corp in a place where more smaller alliances are. roam. ppl will be way more inclined to fight you. I get pretty good content.
---
You have comprehension issues don't you? The problem isn't attracting new players, that is happening enough. It's to make them keep playing. Also this sub isn't "a large amount of the playerbase" and ingame theres enough players that don't quite share your sentiment.
---
Seeing as this turned out be more enjoyed(or hated) than i expected here is a texted version if you ever want to use it ingame.(or show it to your mother)

GF, I know that feeling (I sometimes fly logi). Thanks for putting up such a tough and unexpected response, easily one of my favorite engagements in my time in EVE. It takes a lot of determination to keep reshipping and get back out there.
---
because in regards to nullsec population goons are 50% vs the rest of null
---
Should be able to capture ships from enemy citidals
---
Bill repost your spreadsheet on this one.
---
Again, all of this depends on your definitions - you're saying "Goons" but I can't tell if you just mean Goons or you mean the entire Imperium. Because Delve is more than just Goons.  And if you mean Imperium, it's more than just Delve and Querious. It's Fountain, Syndicate, Pure Blind, chunks of lowsec, and various other regions, plus rental groups. 
---
You are not the average hunter, dude. You know that. But even if you are, are you honestly saying that the biggest problem the average hunter has is the density of Goon control in Delve? Or is it having caps dropped on their heads wherever they go? 
---
You know where I get gatebosoned and dropped with an unmanagable amount of capitals every time we go there? Detorid. 
---
Which, conveniently, isn't included in your list of supercap umbrella regions.
---
I think it's more "*Imperium / Test / Panfam / FRAT will 'x'*"
---
I could care less what you think. I, too, have been around 12 years on Eve and know when a game just got shot in the knee by Hilmar. You're here every day justifying CCP's lack of foresight. My reputation is and always will be speaking my mind when I see shit going sideways. Hate to tell you again; it's going sideways faster than ever in the history of this game. The numbers and adms speak for themselves.
---
By the way, that dude noted that your dataset was shit, too.
---
They'll come back for 5 mins to make a courier contract.
---
Can you find the killmail? :)
---
&gt;something seems off about this and it's nagging me.  
---
The fact that you seem to at least partially agree with Olmeca of all people? :P
---
What makes you think I meant this sub? This sub is primarily people downvoting the shit out of anything anti-chaos. Word of mouth matters in MMOs, negative news travels fast, retaining players is going to be far harder for CCP with a negative cloud hanging over the games head.
---
I don't think they depended entirely on local.
---
From what i've read about it on this subreddit, the bots either pull data directly from RAM or use some form of optical recognition on the EvE client window (eg, that's probably how they know which module icon to click in order to activate mining lasers on a rock). So they should be capable of reading the overview as well.

The reason blackout made it harder for them is that this doesn't help them avoid the T3C that will decloak right on top of them and get tackle before they can warp out. While before, they could work in conjunction with external tools like Near and get advance warning of hostiles coming in from a few jumps out, which gave them enough time to safe up and cloak, dock or warp to a POS.
---
In other words, i don't think it's a technical limitation, as much as a tactical one that severely shortens their available reaction window.
---
thanks CCP for pulling us from the dying stagnation
---
You can only carry a handful of 3200's, and in drawn out fights like this you usually just need a bit of a top-off, rather than a massive injection. It's not as efficient on paper, but generally gives you more endurance.
---
How many of those goons are active compared to inactive?
---
What he said could mean small fleets doing pvp together, possibly including logi etc.      
---
That would need more than a few guys to engage at least. 
---
I don't think CCP has something like that planned for anoms, though. (in a concrete way)
---
why not
---
&gt;I like pvp, but not ONLY pvp.
---
&gt;High sec is a joke, and market trading is run by rich peeps and bots, there is no place for us there.
---
This right here tells me you have a very rusted-in mentality that doesn't reflect reality, decided by your current playstyle. Highsec is a joke, based on other people near you telling you so? Have you tried everything there is in highsec? Have you actually tried doing market things? Because industry and jita market is my main business and i've very rarely encountered bots while i'm not a super rich indvidiual by any means. 
---
You omitted lowsec, have you tried living there? Maybe getting involved in FW space? What about wormholes? If you like PvP, and you find null isn't fun for your PvP, look elsewhere.
---
&gt;And i like my alliance, and the people i fly with in fleets
---
Are your current alliance and the people you are near worth more than having fun in the game? It's not even like you need to leave them permanently. You already have at least one high SP alt. Break whichever one sees least use off and do other things with it, try things in the game. Or just take a break if absolutely nothing in the game interests you, but if PvP was the only thing you were interested in then i don't think the chaos era affected your burnout that much.
---
The data set is bad. 
---
The methodology is bad. 
---
But you see a trend? 
---
What?
---
the risk for getting suicide ganked in HS is much higher than a fast gank squad going unnoticed through your space intel networks to do a quick hit and run on a single member of 7,000 online people.
---
literally more people died in niarja daily than in the top 10 populated systems in null in a week. that is the definition of higher risk.
---
Bots learned it's easier to control wh connections than fuck with incoming gate traffic.
---
Check out the MER.  Do go on.

I remember people bringing 'a big war' to the motherblob. They ran and hid, IIRC.
---
No, not really. It's not my job to educate you or spoon feed you. Also, what you consider current clusterfuck is simply your consideration not the player base as a whole and I'm not trying to debate this with you.
---
What I am touching on is the fact that you state CCP doesn't communicate or listen it's player base and doesn't comment or talk about the current state of the game. etc.. etc.. Which I disagree with.
---
It's not up to me to convince you though and I'm not looking to change your mind. But I feel CCP does a lot for it's community and it's players. I guess we agree to disagree.
---
Probably missattributing locust fleet numbers

Say that again to my astero. hint, i won that fight.
---
And then they turn back on the NPCs attacking citadels...
---
As rare as ratting supers were?
---
we both dont know shit.
---
only one of us seems to be able to acknowledge that fact.
---
You could probably just say "hostile space" instead of "four hostile regions", as you've probably managed to blue everything but that space. 
---
If you can't take being memed about being the game's biggest donut, you probably should HTFU, or leave the donut.
---
? 50% is not mild. I know some of you wormholers and gankers have raging hateboners for anything that makes isk in null, but lets be realistic
---
1. You think alliances have 7000 people online? Jesus.
---
2. You also think comparing easy kills in a highsec system to ten populated system in nullsec is a fair comparison ? Care you link your data on this btw?
---
Nope, dropping carriers on frigates is considered balanced only by retarded people.
---
Ratting supers were all the rage actually.
---
Why? Not all that different from pos shield.
---
Weird, on a quick look at the google news feed for "EVE online" i didn't see anything i would rate as negative PR. Maybe you should get out of the "EVE is dying, Hillmar bad" echochamber?
---
What are you talking about, frigates are dope.
---
The pcu peaks will come,  they must come.
---
It's just as bad before blackout too. Except now when you tackle a rorq it isn't automatic instacyno and caps.
---
oh, you're approaching me?
---
We get content; it's just exceedingly harder and harder to find with each passing day. We like TEST. We liked our sandcastles, too. We helped build them for over two years with TEST, and I'll be damned if we watch Hilmar destroy that without speaking up.
---
&gt; I could care less what you think.
---
Fine then we are equal ...
---
&gt; it's going sideways faster than ever in the history of this game. The numbers and adms speak for themselves.
---
NO. Again you are lying to defend the koolaid induced narrative. The fastest and most massive decline in logins was caused by Citadels 2016 and Lifeblood Moonmining 2017. After these two patches to right BEFORE blackout, Logins dropped by 50 % (see eve-offline stats and the jestertrek analysis to them) despite accounts-per-player ratio exploded due to Umbrella-AFK-FarmVille-Meta. I speak the (proven and chekable) truth, You lie, simple as that ...
---
In other words, you can't link them. Got it. I don't think theres any reason to continue this chat, is there?
---
Statistically speaking there is a decline everyday... But if you want to be reasonable, there's also a gain somewhere around 2016.
---
This meme that eve of dying isn't based on reality. Don't let yourself get confused just because you see it said on this sub a lot. It's mostly the vocal minority whining.
---
... what?
---
I'm pretty fluent in reddit diarrhea, but you're not making any sense whatsoever.
---
Or they're people that don't sit in eve 23/7 scanning and that realize other people are active in the game too.
---
I've seen Proteus' kill Procurers in null.  Never thought I'd live to see the day when hunters could be so brave and capable.
---
Blackout is indeed emboldening.
---
i think i have finally permanently won eve, which makes me sad because it's cool to see all of the bold changes ccp is making. miss all you spacefriends and hope the game can find greatness once again
---
I wont have time to look at how this data is presented and the conclusions for some hours. But yes I'm hesitant to combine the mining and rating income and would rather see them separately as the activitys is a little different and local/cyno changes is going to have different impacts. And comparing 1 area to everything else by "shares of income" and percentile change can be a little screwed. empire space has not realy changed, their mining is a little up but. Meh. Almost all of null is down. Some regions was low already so their change might not be that big.
---
When i get the time I'll dig in to this also since you got me interested.
---
Ratting in lowsec does not improve ADMs in nullsec. Literally no one is asking for things to be easy, try reading first.
---
So because you disagree with something someone said at one instance you chalk up the whole 3 hour conversation as utter crap. Perhaps you simply stopped listening after someone said something you didn't a agree with and missed all the other interesting things that were discussed. That's a shame...
---
Odd. This was one of the top results for me: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c19esk/the_future_of_eve_online_part_1_acknowledge_there/
---
Life intervenes, and sometimes you just win eve for a couple years.   Sometimes it does so unexpectedly...  wars happen, structures are destroyed, sov changes... all without you even knowing.
---
Now picture wanting to come back to the game for some sweet, sweet ship spinning, only to find out that literally everything in the game minus non-liquid assets was gone.  Your carrier, your ships, the billion plus in relic site loot that you were banking for a big trip to Jita... just gone.
---
Would you come back to the game at that point?
---
The only other choice would be manual asset safety. Frequent carrier jumps (hah!  Is joke because none of my lowsec cyno alts can fly recons) to lowsec to store ships in an NPC station.  Constant freight logistics (either your own or through alliance channels) to get your phat lutes to Jita for sale...
---
That's not space fun.  That's space annoying.
---
.... and, did it ever occur to you that blackout doesn't fix ONE SINGLE THING WITH CITADEL SPAM?
---
No, none of this is about my definitions. Definitions change the cutoff point of a "large umbrella". There are many alternative ways to define that. But if in at least one cutoff point, the larger more organized side gets more negatively affected than the smaller less organized side, then the argument I wish to falsify is falsified. If that argument was true, then under all cutoffs it would be true that the more crowded alliance or region would suffer less from blackout. That argument gets falsified even if delve and querious gets nerfed more than the rest, because they are the more organized side. It also gets falsified if imperium panfam and test gets nerfed more than the rest. 
---
You are just playing with semantics here, not at all engaging with the main point I am making above. You are full of cheap trivial points. Like it doesn't matter at all for me whether I can define delve+querious as goons. Because it is already undeniable those two regions (technically just fake querious even) are the most condense, organized, crowded farmgrounds in eve. All I need to get my argument going is proving that they got affected more than the rest. The rest is just semantics.
---
Well if you take solo turns or small gang turns now, you can actually find someone, because NEAR2 fails ...
---
The less you know the better you sleep
---
It's only the level of a Trig invasion. I mean I know you krabs have massive spaghetti throwing contest every time something nerfs your dear ISK\\hr but let's get real, it's not even bad.
---
This is one those cases you know there's nobody behind you but you have to look to make sure.
---
He really oughtta not say "out of EVE" otherwise you can wind someone up to hell and back and call it RP and it's absolutely fine.
---
Do you think the bounty share increase is driven by blackout and other entities being unable to protect their ratters? or by the bot bans?

---
Yeah and they kept plugging away for years.  Some died here and there but that was rare enough people made reddit posts about it.
---
100bil freighters die, no posts.  It's the norm.  Idiots in freighters carrying too much, idiot mission runners fitting officer mods....you see it all the time.
---
But somehow every super that dies in null is postworthy.  Because null was safer than highsec.
---
I did, especially Esoteria had a lot of mining Value prior to the blackout, but Detorid, Branch and Insmother also shouldn't be ignored. Just because the Value in Delve was astronomic doesn't mean it wasn't high in other regions.
---
Yes, i can read numbers and make reasonable **assumptions** based on them. That's what it is.
---
It's not an undisputable fact, it's just an indication of what might be happening which needs more data to confirm it or debunk it.
---
If anyone with the relevant professional training wants to go full data analytics on this and give us a better report, be my guest.
---
You can remind anyone you like but its just my comment and not an official position that can be used as a cudgel against the argument of someone from my space tribe giving their own opinion.
---
None of it really matters either way I think people have cast their votes on whether or not they like the way things are going with Eve and seem entitled to perceive it all how they please. Trying to drag them to an opposing position seems to do more harm than good as evidenced by this sub reddits current state.
---
Did not say that, but it fixes the completely wrong and game-destroying meta of secure afk-multibox-farming and is reinstalling the basic principle of risk vs. reward.
---
Hi part of Vindi here. It was a good fight I rushed home to come help.  Let's us know if you wanna brawl again.  We'll keep it to subcaps. Everyone from our side had fun. This is what we live for pvp.  Don't care about the loses.
---
I am not engaging in semantics. 
---
You are claiming that your data proves your theory. I am pointing out that your data is flawed because you don't have the tools necessary to pinpoint the data down and filter out variables that have an impact on the final numbers. You are taking regional mining yields and substituting them for alliance names and then extrapolating from there. 
---
Honestly, I do not believe it's possible to prove what you want to prove, because the data isn't going to be available in granular enough detail to allow for a really accurate analysis. 
---
This isn't your fault - I mean, besides the fact that you're trying to claim that you've proven something that you haven't proven - but you refuse to recognize what everybody else is saying.
---
*In narrator voice:* Yesterday wasn't enough, he had to try again.
---
Hilmar is known for many things, I won't go into it but essentially, trust in him shouldn't be high for multiple reasons. I disagree with a lot, but in most cases, I listen and attempt to understand. In this situation, I simply see a game that I have played since 2003 in a state of decline because of ridiculous decisions made by a man who has a negative track record. I am annoyed because I am seeing multiple corporations fold in nullsec and merge into others. I am annoyed because CCP are not looking at the gaming landscape and seeing how things have changed. I am annoyed because there is very little communication in light of the glaring issues facing the community right now. I am also annoyed because CCP promotes the idea of having a space empire, then within a matter of a month decide they dont like it and about turn and introduce a ridiculous set of changes to fuck over those they have been promoting for years. This is an awful state of affairs to be in.
---
Agree completely.  Even this last cyno change wound up being about 20h of annoying gameplay for me over the past couple weeks.  From staging industrials in the ass-end of lowsec, to buying an industrial cyno blueprint, building and 'ceptoring them to the locations, I wound up logging about 300 system jumps all told.
---
I'm all for shaking up the game, but would prefer that we do so in a way that (a) isn't annoying, and (b) has a reward for the players for figuring out a way to overcome it.  Pain without reward is just pain.
---
well i am not saying ccp is doing a good job. not at all. just saying you are also not helping yourself. do whatever but crying on reddit is pretty retarded looking at the situation you force yourself in
---
Posts re: supers are posted because people hate super proliferation and one dying means karma whoring. Nothing more.
---
"I just know guys"
---
Back to playing Fortnite or WoW. Because despite CCP's best efforts, this 2019 *"EVE Online: Battle Royale"* game they are trying so hard to create suffers from one fatal flaw: the newbros you are trying to keep by feeding them all the null-sec PVE players won't stay if there are no null-sec PVE players to be sacrificed.
---
CCP basically said: *"Attention all null-sec PVE players: GET FUCKED!... but also please stay and die a lot so the newbros won't leave!"*
---
We refuse.
---
Interesting, i never get reddit suggested when explicitly looking for news. Even though i spend so much time here.
---
Sometimes we just want to relax and mine while shooting the shit on comms. That is no longer an option in null. You can in high but it's more overhead due to the smaller Rock sizes and roaming Triglavian scouts. Lowsec gets destroyed by NPC miners so there's rarely ever any rocks to mine there unless it's a lowsec with 30 asteroid belts. 
---
I prefer anoms or sigs that have rocks to mine. I miss those in Delve
---
Cyno changes also make it easier for small fleets to roam, and that's really the bread and butter of Eve. Caps shouldn't be about killing small roams, they should be able sov and structures. 
---
I'm enjoying the changes and know full well CCP has more up their sleeve.
---
Local should just be all of a constellation.

3 bomb waves can kill light fighters in a hel at least. If your fighter gets clipped by a bomb because lol bumping off the rock, you can't safely bomb the last wave. The first wave is safe to bomb since your fighters are not there yet, and the last wave is safe to bomb because it's tankable unless your skills are truly shit.
---
Sorry, i still disagree. I would come back to the game just fine and i would be smart enough to not put all my eggs in one basket in the first place.
---
It's not a case of right or wrong, it's just a case of what game you want to play.
---
I come from a time when EvE was harder and i liked it that way because it was more challenging. Other people are more recent additions to the pool and they like a bit more hand-holding. In the end, neither of the two have any effect on what CCP does...if they think asset safety is bad for stifling conflict they'll hit it with the nerfbat, otherwise they won't.
---
No thanks. I already masturbated today.
---
But you can log out in space in a barge and then go alpha and still mine in it as an alpha.
---
Small roams from whom? Alliances? Which could develop into escalations, which are negatively impacted by the cyno changes. The changes are awful. Multiple other avenues could have been taken, reducing the cap drop risk on small roams while maintaining the chance of an escalation, CCP didn't take that route, they simply decided to take the most ridiculous route possible.
---
Don't be silly.
---
I certainly haven't had an issue getting people to jump into doctrine ships, the bigger issues are (as I'm sure you know) around opsec and escalation chains, and of course the biggest issue in our/your war is just timezones.
---
Read some of the Leet PVP Corp recruitment ads:
---
"NO PVE IN CORP; figure something out"
---
Ofc they are going to downvote you; Blackout/Cyno Change is a free pass for them... and will NOT have you fucking this up...
---
Even if it kills the whole game...
---
Was the fourth or fifth option for me.
---
My stance is, afk mining led to awesome fights, where the entire alliance would form to save these morons. It was still content. I don't pve, and neither does most of my corp. I believe - very strongly - that more people in nullsec space means more fights. In short, more people in nullsec = more chance of content.
---
You should read up on timers, aggression, and what limited engagements are and what it means for you as the Orca to interfere with someone shooting "your" miners (e.g. remote repping them).
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Timers
---
a) No need to lock the maintenance hangar unless you are carrying your own ships. "Worse" that can happen is someone stores (read - donates) their ship in your bay. 
---
b) good
---
c) If you're not pre-aligned, you will not escape a bumper since it's by default an extremely fast ship, likely Angel hull so it moves even faster and gets on grid and moving before you can react.
---
Ganking a tanked high sec Orca is a whole nother matter. If you are fit correctly, it will not be profitable for anyone to kill you. You can get to 500-600k EHP using only T2 mods. Of course, if you see local going from 30 players to 100 or lots of reds, you should probably gtfo.
---
Fitting correctly and with safety in mind is simpler than having an alt in a remote rep ship that has to either be cloaked on grid or flown in, heals very little compared to the Orca's massive shield pool, and generally is an extra hassle that is decreasing your time spent doing useful stuff. Yes, it will obviously help, but also carries the extra risk that your logi will become the target of the gank instead.
---
My last bit of advice and something that I've found very useful when semi-AFK mining, is to consider fitting a Higgs Anchor. This (genius, if you ask me) rig will allow you to mine while aligned because your top speed ends up being &lt;20 m/s.
---
Yet CCP use this echo chamber to get feedback. Jeeeeeeeez.
---
&gt; Bob has spoken: the spawn rate and lifetime of some wormhole connections to Nullsec space have changed. 
---
It was the spawn of all Null wormholes. W-Space to Null was affected as well. 
---
I can literally cite a reference for it and I still get downvoted..... That's what happens when you let uneducated people have a voice.
---
Absolutely this.  
---
An absolutely cool guy who really does have a very deep understanding about most things Eve.
---
So that would be like every 3rd post
---
The people who care about botting are most hilarious. Helpless and afraid. Making a big ole boogey man out of something because powerlessness. You can't stop it because its an incredibly simple game and the scripting is equally simple because navigating the 3d plane is not actually needed.
---
It's a waste of breath, CCP already does what every successful company does which is spend as little development time or money as possible when addressing scripts because its a losing prospect. The indecent goofiness CCP pulls by playing off community fears of botting by making it headline news to muffle horrid chaos changes or to act as "reasoning" for changes is the stuff I can't stand.
---
Players being goofy doesn't bug me as much as CCP pandering to the silliest element. It's lip service to assist shoehorning in some pretty underthought development decisions.
---
That's the real botting problem, fear peddling and misunderstanding the effect or matter of bots and ccp playing off that inadequacy of its playerbase. 
---
In a game btw, when people can write scripts more useful than your children.
---
I didn't read this because I don't have a hate boner for any particular group. Just curious if you happy with the way you manipulated the data to support your argument. I know you were very pleased with the last result.
---
Why would you form a whole fleet, complete with logi, and just sit out in space, slowly killing rats for terrible ticks, and waiting for someone to form up enough cloaky/nulli lokis in order to be able to hotdrop you without risking any losses?
---
At that point, just join WTM and run incursions, better isk for 0 risk.
---
When was the last time you checked those numbers lol. Imperium &amp; co are more like 30% of the total players sitting in alliances, not 50%
---
...so you even understand basic human behavior?
---
Like the narrative self and the experiential self?
---
Because you're talking like a dunning-kruger case study.
---
I'm one. Changes have been great. No complaints. I started playing a month or two prior to blackout and live in null in a smallish but old Corp. This thread certainly doesn't speak for me.
---
how did you farm 0.5b isk per hour? i got about 200m per hour at max when it was safer, which already dropped to about 100m if not lower because i cant even use capitals anymore without extreme risk of being dropped.
---
Too late
---
Pretty sure it's 5m on recons.
---
It would be okay if the shitposts were even remotely decent. But you get this fucking trash every post
---
I have to say u/CCP_Falcon, that from an outside perspective it looks to me like: 
---
1. CCP pays no attention to the broader EVE community, and responds to r/eve like r/eve is THE EVE online community--this includes ignoring feedback and addressing the concerns of people on your official EVE online forums;
---
2. Given the metrics we have access to, as someone who once made games like yours for a living you are 'nerfing' socialization in your game, which is quite odd given that you must recognize that retention rates are *heavily* correlated with quality social interactions. For example:
---
   1. You have removed local, a very key socialization tool, from a large percentage of your player base;
---
   2. You have instituted changes that make things people used to do while socializing so difficult *via* risk v. reward imbalance, you are driving people, if not away from the game entirely, to stop logging in *en masse;*
---
      1. Of course, when people don't log in and socialize, you reduce and weaken in-game social networks, which cause more people to not log in, which further weakens and reduces in-game social networks, which causes more people to not log-in--you see where I am going with this? CCP intentionally seems to be creating a feedback loop which can do ***irreparable*** damage to your IP. 
---
All of which concerns me, because, just based on my experience in the industry, suggests that CCP either no longer has the resources to properly design game changes, and then pass those changes through quality assurance, or that upper management is *intentionally* trying to damage the IP as they are on their way out of the door so that their new projects/companies will be better situated to compete with CCP and EVE's IP.
---
You use alts, if you hear a hole fire, you know you aren't safe anymore and dock up. Dscan is actually pretty useless since everything has a cloak, it is the sig popping up in the probe scanner or the sound of a enemy ship jumping a wormhole that alerts you
---
erm, lol, did you really ran havens in a Super? I always had my Fighters on optimal orbit around the gate and usually with T2 Fighters there was no problem, if done right, the bomb does not even hit (10km bomb radius, 12 km Light Fighter orbit). Also there was enough time between the bomb runs for shield recharge that is quite good on fighters. Never lost a fighter to my own bombs, always bombed 3 waves.
---
12 km is 7.46 miles
---
Also the way it’s presented is still misleading. The game is not divided into goons and not-goons, even if Olmeca thinks it is.
---
no asset safety !
---
The life of r/eve now
---
It really isn't. Krabs dying doing dumb things have been shit talked for basically forever. We'll usually attempt to save them despite their best efforts to die, but that has never stopped us from talking shit.
---
I do, too.  I've been playing since 2005, with a couple winning sessions.  
---
Serious question:  Do you live in null?  Prior to the citadels, there was some asset risk.  I still have a small fortune (for some) spread out of sov null that I used to live in, where I no longer have access.
---
But if I really wanted to get to that stuff, I could find a way to either liquidate it or retrieve it.  I could build an alt, get it into a corp in the current owner's alliance, contract the stuff to the alt, then use corp logistics to get it out.  Or, I could firesale the stuff and get at least some of my money out of it.  Hell, I made a couple hundred million buying firesales when we took over one spot or another.
---
Without asset safety... your stuffs just gone.
---
I've had other MMOs where I've returned with all my stuff gone (including WoW, where my account got hacked, and I found my character abandoned in the middle of a mob spawn with my soulbound armor reduced to nothing).  I didn't go back to them.
---
Lol, krabs. You mean the source of everything in eve, and also frequently are pvpers as well?
---
Try mining then!! It will be fun they said
---
Goon brigade lmao
---
Major coalitions having wars are not the majority of activities though. As I said, the VAST VAST VAST majority of content, even in nullsec doesn't rely on cynos.
---
Huge capital conflicts are pretty damn rare. They aren't even the majority of super killmails.
---
You're kind of ignoring the fact there are people out there that aren't as active as you and actual information in the game is sparse. Mostly, the game doesn't say anything about a structure you have things in until after it has blown up, by the asset safety notification. If you do industry remotely, you may well be placign jobs into a structure an hour or less before it loses its armour timer (and thus stops all services and locks in your blueprints) and the game gives zero information about this.
---
So while you say "you had every opportunity", the reality is that it'd be super easy to miss your shit being blown up in someone else's structure if you happen to not be hooked into eve fulltime. People have stuff come up IRL, being unable to be super active in a game for a week should not be a reason to lose literally all your items. Outposts didn't do that and structures in null explicitly replaced outposts.
---
Of course, that's also still ignoring game balance issues. Lack of asset safety would mean the big blocs start cracking the pinata that is every nonbloc player structure with numbers that can't be fought against, forcing everyone but blocs out of null or potentially the game (if they did lose all their stuff).
---
Ask yourself: if tomorrow you lost all your ships, all your items, everything you owe in the game. You don't have friends willing to just pass you a few billions to get going again. Would you be willing to trudge through that, starting over from scratch, or would you just move on to a different game?
---
I am too. Ridiculous. Harden up.
---
More interesting from your work here is that CCP nerfed all activity.  They are literally killing the game this is the only ture conclusion to your effort.
---
Since I'm the one that wrote the report, I'll reply.
---
I get your frustration with the situation, you want something to get done, but nothing appears to be getting done. I share your concern that nothing is getting better. 
---
Yes, we told CCP exact and specific issues that concerned the community.  The huge concern over player activity dropping was repeated endlessly.  Perhaps I wasn't clear enough in my report.  What we said was "these are the huge problems we are seeing in the game, you need to address them ASAP".  What we didn't get into is "the vagabond needs 5% power grid buff" type of discussion.
---
I had 4 pages of notes on all the feedback I had received matched to the session topics in advance to be prepared for the discussions. Exzooki literally gave a presentation to CCP on a topic. The issues were presented repeatedly and strongly.  In session after session, the CSM did their best to explain the problems.  
---
I mentioned developing a social bond because it is an important part of establishing the trust that is needed between the CSM and CCP.  Whether people like it or not, trust is a critical part of making change happen.
---
Lastly, as has been repeated many times, the CSM cannot share the details of what happened exactly at the meetings.  We are bound to confidentiality. I cannot say what was discussed "in full detail".  I would have much preferred that CCP wrote a meeting report instead of myself, but they don't do that.  Hopefully we will get the meeting minutes soon and you can see what was discussed for yourself.
---
If you keep a lot of assets in a wormhole, you deserve to get it destroyed.
---
They will come.
---
I work at a multinational corporation that is one of the top ten in our field. I'm familiar with how things are handled.
---
Can one of you tech nerds do some statistics on *killmails?* Some of us don't play the game to mine all day. Frag availability is the real driver of the game's success.
---
If you are just starting out, learn the ropes first, that\`s my advice. There\`s plenty of stuff to do with alpha account and while you get the sense of the game you should have more than enough to plex your account.
---
I found exploration to be the fastest way to learn the basic survivability and generate enough ISK to be able to plex your account. Find a decent null sec corp, and start craking those relic/data sites. I started 5 weeks ago and after moving to null 20 days ago my net worth is close to 6B now just from exploration.
---
But other than cloaking device I really don\`t see any reason to plex my account just yet, but that\`s me, I like to take things at my own pace.
---
Good luck and fly safe! :)
---
Can I have your stuff:)
---
He just made them up silly. Fearlessly posting garbage as is the status quo
---
Then you will agree with what I have said. I've had it happen at both IBM and Fujitsu while working as a contractor. I've also had it while working in the NHS, after retraining as a nurse, when a ward I worked bank for was under-performing, central office sent an individual to oversee changes.
---
Thank you for the cyno changes, we can now enjoy roaming in battleships again in low sec!
---
Yes there is still a risk but now it’s more calculated!
---
&gt;when the core of the game has already been hurt so badly?
---
No. Its my T2 BPO.
---
Thats exactly why a lot of nullseccers now say, f\*\*k it and go away. The risk vs reward is currently completely out of scale in Nullsec. The thing is, that the empires wont really break apart because of that and other then to say "Hey I have a few nullsec systems with my name attached to it" also small alliances wont make any cut there.
---
And if Mittens had made the comment when the rules for RL threats were that you get permabanned them Id agree but tuat didnt happen when the rules were set like that.
---
In fact they changed due to that and other RL threats. So in Mittens case he served the ban as the rules were laid out at the time. 
---
Your answer will probably be "Well he should be still banned now even though the rule change happened after." 
---
That like someone  comitting a crime, being sentanced to 5 years and after serving their time &amp; being released the min sentence is raised to 7 years and the police throwing him back in jail for the 7 years. Double jeopardy is an actual legal thing for a reason.
---
I do also love how GigX defenders forget GigX's repeated temp bans for previous RL threats )Including omes around the same time as Mittens drunken attack.) before the Judge incident. Nevermind the repeated blatent GigX alts he created after the ban.
---
So 1 drunk incident and RL threat by Mittens vs several RL threats by GigX before the Judgement, one live RL threat on a Twitch Stream during and repeated attempts by GigX to continue playing after being banned. On the scales of who deserves the bans more, GigX deserves the lifetime ban every single time.
---
And you think bringing 30 people to kill a vni is balanced as well. Both situations are 1 party unable to fight back. 
---
Neither group wants a fight, but the vnis accept it as a part of life. You on the other hand don't like when someone brings something to easily kill you and cried to ccp to prevent it.
---
&gt;Removal of asset safety would create the conflict that null is lacking right now.
---
I don't believe that at all. At best you'd see the null blocs blobbing every single structure that isn't owned by null blocs since they're free loot pinatas, then return to a situation where blocs don't fight except the rest of null has been forced to be permanently empty.
---
They'll prey on each other, as it is already done in WH pvp.
---
Don't blame it on those scary wormhole people.
---
Thank you for working hard to make these great vids man.
---
i have been enjoying humping the paala gate like a cheap hooker with my new mates in the horde. standing fleet best fleet.
---
&gt; Full warning, I just woke up and I'm extremely grouchy. 
---
Maybe sleep some more and only post after you have cooled down.    
---
Who are you, to dictate how a group of fellow eve players has to behave towards EVE devs?     
---
The CSM has never had any power over the game development. It's not their their job. It's no job at all. Are you paying them?        
---
Regarding their "reports" from the meeting, they are obviously under NDA.
---
You don't think the core of the game is in nullsec? The massive battles that CCP use to promote the game? The most effort in order to get "space empires" up and running? The most interesting politics? You need to try it, if only it wasn't being destroyed.
---
Upvote because is true.
---
To megathink this. If CCP is no longer in control wouldn't that be a good thing based on the amount of salt towards CCP pre-blackout?
---
Depends which side of an argument Goons are trying to push.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
to be fair. rorqs where good content for blobs and boosh/bomb memes. not for small-midsize groups tho. The panic and therefor defender formup time just doesnt allow that. i know many ppl have fun doing these 100 men stuka fleets etc but i and many others that love eve would never join this f1 pusher content. also ye many rorqs died to small groups and back when i was in HK and we had a NS static we grabbed a bunch too but all of these had been retards.
---
rorqs are not good content. they are just the only thing that cant dock up immediatly after intel fires alarm
---
ETA on when Provi folds into TEST?
---
Mostly source of sweet nothing that is ISK (and juicy killmails). Industrialists are ones making shit.
---
However Goons are by far the largest entity, so every other group is a "little guy" when compared to them.  
---
Without having in knowledge in it i'm sure that's not how that Malcanis thing works, but i think that's the point Olmeca is trying to make - that the rest of the universe wasn't affected worse than the largest entity.  
---
And while it **is** flawed, so are all the "but muh little guy" comments. Especially when you see leaders of small groups step in and say that it's bullshit.
---
Is lime to thank the entire eve community for logging in regularly and keeping the game relevant Eve online is a great game with great players cheers to the years and to many more
---
only 4 more solo kills left so i reach 100 solo kills (✿◠‿◠)
---
&gt;You get further with Meth than honey. fitty
---
You need to leave the Null bloc. Seriously. Highsec and lowsec have ice belts. With a Porp and two covetors, you can mine 100+m an hour before compression and reprocessing. Less if you lack the skills but still profitable. 
---
I didn't join Null out of the gate but many of my friends did. They're still in a Null alliance not knowing what to do. I left at the start of blackout and am making more isk than before and am finding regular content. The changes hurt those unable and unwilling to change what they do while those of us experienced in other things are not affected so much.
---
With that said, the no local thing needs to change ASAP or there won't be any content left for anyone in any area.
---
The newbros are the null sec pve players.
---
Where do all the new players get pointed to? Karmafleet, horde, dreddit, etc
---
Still too long for a ship that costs 400m or more. I totally get that cynos on everything was too much, but they could have at least made it so combat ceptors can also use cynos (give them a purpose again). They would go up to 40-50m again, be dragged into bubbles, but at least you can lose 1 or 2 of them and dont be down a billion isk
---
This is the post r/eve deserves. Shame it's drowned out by the tears of spodbrains
---
&gt; If Pearl Abyss notice a decline in revenue, CCP will be forced to change tack. 
---
I think you need to hit up a business 101, it's not like eve was growing rapidly when it got bought and it's not like these changes have been made in secret behind closed doors. They're quite clearly a long term plan to improve the health of the game, and thus the company behind it. The investors are aware, they're not going to come out of the woodwork to back up your personal opinion.
---
Now it's just 150+ F1 Stuka fleets and shooting fish in a rain barrel. Healthy, right?
---
Suprised there wasn't a post about this yet from yesterday's battle: https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/vSyduJqAajFyv5umG  
---
Notable human errors:   
---
Mangos jumping solo into Elos  Muninns in ZO-, feeding most of their Muninns before the timer.
---
Goon FC warping his fleet to a jumpgate in ZO- that a big  part of his fleet could'nt take. Feeding eagles into Elo.  
---
Elo warping his Muninns to the tackled nyx off  Grid, calling for cancel warp after half his fleet warped off into 3 hostile subcap fleets.  
---
Specially shoutout  to snuffed for trying to bomb hacs with defender jackdaws  OMEGALUL
---
thats what i meant. they always were shit for content if u are not a blob
---
Oh hey, it's Heilung.
---
Yeah, I guess I would choose them for a blood cult soundtrack too.
---
Maybe that's because you aren't brave enough? I'll smacktalk in local no matter where I am.
---
History has proven it would be much worse off in the direct hands of a korean company. Most of the games from there are hyped, fast dying microtransaction monstrosities. Hence why i don't understand why some people are hoping for the magical PA saviours. PA would drive the game deeper into the shitter than CCP ever could.
---
i appreciate all the people who have stayed in touch that i played with even though they've quit playing due to real life things, really shows that internet spaceships are serious business
---
You mean your heavy fighters? Light fighters don't have the range to orbit the gate and still hit the rats that spawn. I've never lost heavy fighters except to dread spawns that target them but light fighters are well within bomb damage range if you hit every rat in the spawn with bombs.
---
There's a reason gods like Kendarr are now gate camping and in snuff instead of fc'ing
---
Then maybe you should pressure CCp to use an actual anti cheat in their software as well as hire a dedicated team to fight botters. While you are it maybe you can convince them to hire a legal team to start taking legal action against sites doing RMT.
---
hey bud glad you lived, if it was .5 sec you were either war decced or not in .5 and in fact in .4 or lower always double check where ya going
---
And again whats that got to do with the lack of T2 salvage Drones. Its the only reason Dunk is there. He has campaign promises to keep
---
And the Primea is a short run special edition ship. Its like the Quafe Miasmos or the Echelon. It exists but there are only a few about and no more BPC's are being dropped so if you have one it should be docked as its worth a shitton more as a collectors item than as a an actual ship.
---
what about moon mining ?
---
No, I don't think it is the "core" of the game. And yes, I already am trying it, and loving it.
---
No they were not, It seems like you never left your cosy Sov-Blob-Home with Outposts spammed in every system. Even now there are still groups using POS to stage &amp; store Titans and Supers, you know people that use them for PvP quite often and do not have the time to grind hundreds of Keeps or dont like being in a multiple 10k anonymous lemming herd that is needed to protect them.
---
16 years later, and I don't have much faith in CCP's ability to make a functional new-player-experience. No matter how many of their devs they put on the thing. - From experience, I can tell you that piling a shitload of devs onto a project doesn't improve the odds of that project working out. Especially when you have no idea how to actually achieve the desired end result to begin with. (And make no mistake: CCP has a long and proud legacy of having no fucking clue how to retain new players.)
---
When was the last time you got hotdropped by snuff?
---
maybe he want to open Chinese restaurant?
---
Years ago when I was in my first 'null-sec corp'  ^(*Read: Renters*)
---
I thought I would be helpful to my corp and make an alt to join a corp from the alliance that was harassing us everyday. Not really sure what I wanted to accomplish as any intel I had would just amount to some warning time that they were coming through. 
---
Didn't take long to realize that their playstyle was *much* more fun than what I had been doing previously. After a few months most of the members of my old corp had joined the one I 'infiltrated' lmao.
---
Obviously, this is a shitpost, but I did put a bit of thought into it - it doesn't nerf gun or missile boats, which both would encourage a bit more variety in subcap ratting and provide options that wouldn't see reduced yields, and to preserve higher-value, higher-risk ratting options like T3Cs and blops for escalations. The biggest rattgin isk faucets on the null side are from supers, and they the brunt of the whack. A straight nerf to bounties wouldn't accomplish either. Ditto nerfing mining via drones but not lasers.
---
Chemotherapy hurts.
---
People quit the game when the activities they like are removed. News at 11.
---
Early on in the war with FRT, we got some nice subcap feeds that way. Not so much anymore.
---
Total removal of asset safety would be patently retarded, since it *severely* fucks up anyone who has to leave the game for legitimate reasons. Since some people play Eve for 10+ years, everyone needs to take a break for RL shit at some point (death in the family, surgery, literal war in your backyard, etc). 
---
If they'd *never introduced asset safety except for the originally anchored faction forts so legacy players didn't lose their shit*, it might be manageable. But at this point safety removal would fuck up a huge portion of the playerbase, as well as driving yet more risk aversion among null alliances. I dunno who really wants to play "stage in lowsec online".
---
Resource wars attempted to do some stuff with single use skins. It got labeled as a new player trap.
---
you're arguing that you're too rich in eve and because it would be difficult to consolidate that wealth without asset safety, asset safety should remain?
---
Black out in effect 12 weeks. Negative growth per week. What data are you basing this statement on?
---
good luck!
---
wow sounds like eve is dying damn that's brazy good luck tho xd
---
Good shit guys, I am warming up to the cyno changes. It pretty easy to see where there will be more room for mistakes here. Still, do not get why the only class of ships to have it is a half bill high SP cruiser.
---
Oh yes delve and querious the two most heavily defended reigons. Doubly so for fortress querious.
---
There is a lot about chinese culture that /r/eve isn’t really familiar with.  I know most of the rus political history, but space china is more opaque.
---
Primarily: Face (miánzi/lian/yán)
---
Chinese dignity, honor, pride, and prestige are fragile things. Chinese player culture seems to be driven by a need to avoid losing status or damaging their image.
---
Noraus broke an agreement with TOAM, because TOAM wouldn’t abandon their friends Legacy At the behest of Noraus. In response, Military Mantou has made comments (i don’t have screencaps, just second hand audio translation relay) about Noraus relying on a waiguo ren (outsider) FC (Elo) after Noraus’ history of trying to make FART the chinese space destination for EVE. He even referred to him as a Banana Man, which is similar to a white guy calling another guy a “race traitor”. (Yellow on the outside, white on the inside)
---
The reality: both of them lean on westerners for success.  Single TZ ethnocentric alliances and coalitions have a hard time without them. 
---
Fuxi and Nuwa were the beef of Pangu prior to frat, and they were in N3. They relied on euro and ustz to carry them through the Halloween War. They have long term ties with NCdot. The Therapists and FRT are the husk of pangu in two separate alliances. These days, they are very reliant Laowai Elo Knight and origin to round out their experience and coverage. They have their own super fleet augmented by ustz.  
---
TAOM play a lot alongside legacy, but weren’t showing up to FRT timers.  Noraus didn’t like that they were friendly with TEST, broke agreements, and now TAOM  are showing up to timers with Legacy. One could make the argument that they are leaning on legacy to succeed, but this would offend them greatly. TAOM now have their first official grudge on tranquility, and it is with other Chinese folks. Why do they have this grudge? To save face.
---
The reality is that its more fun to play with us yáng guǐzi.
---
P.S. I wish I knew/remembered more about ranger regiment to see where they fit into things. If I had spare time, I’d dig through player histories and extrapolate more.
---
Just a random observation: Chinese or Rus have owned the [same wicked creek pocket](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/F-QQ5N) on and off for 5~ years.
---
because it is a new player trap, if you need to pay more in LP store for an item that you can buy it in jita then something went very wrong
---
Surprise secret: It's not you.
---
I had to reinstall my launcher yesterday. Had a similiar issue
---
&gt; I like pvp when it's on my terms
---
you would think that might be the case. but in reality it's not.
---
in wormhole space, the large groups could easily scour space clean in a matter of a couple months. they dont because they want people living there. they want miners mining, site runners running sites, pvpers pvping. 
---
the only evictions that happen are against low power structures. to make room for people who will live there. big "content" evictions happen between the large entities. not big vs small.
---
you're saying that null would cut off their own nose to spite the face of another. ultimately they would not.
---
TLOS is bailing to Snuffed with some big names now. Just think, Kenny, pretty soon, between timezone tanking and few pilots in space, Provi will be a ghost town. Mission accomplished.
---
Would have been a while ago, I haven’t fought them since I was with Horde and we lived in O-VWPB
---
Wow the propaganda concern trolling screeching in this one is reaching a new high. Now CCP are actively working to undermine their game lol.
---
Then what is the core? What attracts most people to the game?
---
Government shouldn't be your model for... well, anything.
---
Honestly, I don't doubt that in the short-term, the bigguns might take a proportionally harder hit.  The "we'll adapt better because we have the organization" meme has always had a bit of lag attached to it to lurch the fat-guy-that-is-us into a new regime.  
---
If these changes stick around, we'll see how things play out.
---
thats right, i am the one who said
---
\- "it would be nice, but we both know it ain't what's going on."
---
and i am not the person who suggested we both have no idea what is happening with PCU numbers.
---
clearly i am the one who is unable to acknowlege the fact that we both have no idea what is happening with PCU numbers.
---
makes sense to me!
---
But maybe that is the point?
---
To make it costly.
---
That you either need to secure your cyno or pay the price.
---
I totally understand your point, but determining what exactly is the ideal price point/risk is going to be difficult.
---
&gt;everything has a cloak
---
found the guy who's lying about doing the wormhole
---
Has nothing to do with politics. Salvaging catalysts are dying in droves as well. The activity in general on salvaging has gone down across the board, rigs have become more expensive to produce, and as a result, rigs are more expensive in general. That player activity is dying in nullsec.
---
That is a new player activity that is not viable in nullsec without some balance.
---
Snuff? Allies? Oh god. Those two words do not belong next to each other 😂😂😂😂
---
I mean it's a shame but inevitable I guess at this point. That means I  can keep winning Eve
---
You seem new to this so I'll keep it simple.  Veteran players are the most effective tool for new player retention.
---
You're pretty deluded then
---
Incidentaly, it is. Probably not their goal, but that's what all changes made the last few years led to.
---
Yea TZ tanking sucks. There's no incentive to try and create conflict and get those fights we had before.
---
&gt;an "Olmeca Shitpost" being defined as "any post Olmeca makes on reddit"
---
Your stats are bullshit because they imply that the only time olmeca is shitposting is when he creates a topic.  You're vastly underestimating the appropriate sample.
---
They can't, because the data isn't available. This is the problem. Olmeca makes way too many assumptions about who is where and doing what, and the level of detail he needs isn't reproducible with the tools we have - the MER and Dotlan. 
---
He would need a tool that can provide him the specific mining and ratting amounts for individual alliances in order to prove his case and he'd need that data for all of 2019.  There's no way to get that.
---
Remove all +attributes from implants. Change Empire implants to be faction based (ex, Caldari navy set, Amarr set, etc).
---
Replace implants in the LP store with Cerebral Accelerators of 5 degrees that improve attributes by a certain amount that also persists through death. Say, the "Improved accelerator" costs double an improved implant does now, lasts 30 days, and gives +5 to all attributes for a month. Now you have constant demand for a navy LP store item since it's a consumable rather than something you can keep forever by being a coward with your pod, new players do not have the cost of implants to deter them from losing pods, and people don't lose SP from using Genolutions/mid-grades.
---
They can start by nerfing Orcas.
---
No U
---
Dunks infatuation with the Primae is missplaced. Its one of the few things I disagree with him on. CCP devs have better and more important things to do than buff a limited run special edition PI variant of a ship that no longer is available to make new and has more value as a collectors ship.
---
Its like asking CCP to buff the Echo Corvette.
---
The lack of T2 salvage drones is a crimr against humanity and needs to be addressed immediatly.
---
Yeah I'm 2006 player new.  Direct your comments to CCP, I'm just the messenger pal.
---
You are correct.
---
You don't need puller if you don't cherrypick too much.
---
Basically you need to accept 1mission out of 10 (did not make the stat actually, just average as it seems) to remain above -2 , because sometimes you can have good missions in a row, and sometimes… bad in a row (like, 20 decline or 30).
---
That's why selecting carefully your agent location is important, both for the system index, the corporation LPstore, and the geography.
---
Also don't forget that excessive cherrypick actually reduces your income. If you accept 1/100 missions, then for one mission you need to spend 99times declining the mission, which can be +-4s each so close to +6min delay average. If you accept 10/100 you only have 40s delay between missions, average. If your agent has total 100 missions inhis pool, but you only accept the 5 burners agents and the 4 burner teams, that's 9/100 ; and if he can send you to 4 jumps and half of them are only 2 jumps and it's a quarter are 2 jumps : if you cherry pick you take 9/4 = 2.25% of the missions so delay is +177s while the added time from 2 to 4 jumps is 1minute per jump so 120s : then you are actually losing time cherry picking.
---
Ok, not everyone has a cloak. But when people bring ships to kill ratters, they bring cloakies. The only exception is the hyperspatial dictor, that warps directly to a cloaked ship or a bookmark made by the cloaked ship, but by the time it has decloaked the ratters are already dead, no matter what they do.
---
Well played sir
---
/r/eve is dying?
---
There is a reason nobody uses them. Ammo is annoying to deal with. Plus it's also a matter of range.
---
I'll wait for BBTB2's real analysis thank you.
---
We need to put together a committee to properly interpret and review the results, otherwise all of the conclusions are baseless.
---
look at that, us agreeing. 
---
who says we cant be friends!
---
We need to find where they get their crack from. Sounds like some dank stuff
---
imo if the attacker could at least decide the *day* of the timer so whoever was off TZ could alarm clock on a Saturday, it'd be less cancer.
---
How are they negatively impacted? Sub cap roams should be met with sub cap fleets. If you want to cap drop use the proper ships now. The insane power of caps and jumping needed to be met with a little more effort. 
---
Nothing's changed. Just the ships that cyno. Big whoop. It needed a buff up in effort.
---
Are you really that upset? Because it seems you just don't want to adapt to obvious changes we needed.
---
Much like Olmeca, you are omitting key data from your post. One must factor in his replies to threads into the shitpost counter.
---
Yep, but with this there'd be a reason TO use them, too (in systems with it active, anyway). Anyway, glad you enjoyed wasting a few brain cells thinking about this silly and fun game with me. See you out there.
---
Reddit says we can't be friends... =/
---
Ketchup Guardian will be my next alts name.
---
Right. Because nothing entices a new player to stay more than being lead into a meat-grinder to keep the attention-deficient PVP player base entertained.
---
Newbro undocks his shiny new Venture to go mine some sweet spod. Gets dropped by a dozen blops 5 minutes later, naturally including the standard *"get rekked dirty krab!!! lol"* local shittalk when he tries to figure out what the hell just happened. - 5 minutes after that, he's back in the Steam store browsing for his next game.
---
All I can say is, that it is currently not worth moving a single cap or two. And if CCP thinks i get 10 or more accounts to move something then sorry not gonna happen. I already struggled If i should get a second account but seen i didnt really have a choice if i want to do more then subcap things i eventually got one. I am not one of the wealthy delve guys with their rorq fleets and whatnot. I just ratted what i needed and looked for PvP else. This way i played got obliterated/ made so hard its not worth it anymore. The only reason im still here is because i love the game but lately CCP really made it very hard for me.
---
Moving i also isnt a viable choice because of all i already invested, so what shall i do?
---
pff. reddit isnt the boss of me. 
---
the Glorious and powerful BOB is the boss of me. He's fine with us being pals.
---
so long as we occasionally brutally murder each other.
---
blood for the blood god and all that.
---
Filthy heretic. You should be purged in the name of the Emperor.
---
I realize this is a meme, but why do you have uncertainty bars on that graph? Are you uncertain in the numbers of posts he has made?
---
Yes, since 2003.
---
I'm not going to argue with something if it's correct, however I have revised my stance on this analysis.
---
Another weakling howls to ccp, how other people could build their empires but he/she is too lazy to build anything.
---
Oh no
---
i am nothing compared to big time industrialists.  they would literally need to spend months to consolidate.
---
I dont like pvp when we are 80 against 10 guys, same as when we are 10 and get buttfucked by 80 guys. 
---
We all prefer small gang pvp, or Huge capitals brawls (just for the idea of being in 1000+ caps grid)
---
now that you said something dumb, can you just be smart and use your brain ?
---
Well what do you need to move your caps for?
---
Ironically he probably doesn’t understand that tapierum is prob one of the biggest factors in why null is so stagnant
---
I'm referring to your 2nd and 5th paragraphs.
---
I read you post 3 or 4 times and I still fail to understand why Olmeca's analysis would be wrong. I understand the numbers you use. I fail to understand what you want to say with them.
---
The only thing I found was that Olmeca omitted some regions that apparently have cap umbrellas. But that doesn't mean the region he showcase haven't lost more than the others, just that the others are not only small alliances. And it still means the most people we have here on reddit complaining are from the regions that adapted the worst.
---
skulls for the skull throne!

12 km is in the area of 2.4855 leagues

but first we need a committee to determine the members of the committee otherwise the committee has no power.
---
also the committee for the committee for the planning of the interstellar hyperspace lane would like a status report
---
Keep it simple. POS style mechanics, RF based upon Stront.
---
They look really cool.
---
Unfortunately the goon shitposts ABOUT Olmeca had gone up by a few thousand percent.
---
Wish they'd just get over him already, kinda embarassing.
---
You previously said:
---
&gt; I’ve played since 2008 and I agree many pvp’ers quit the game, myself included. But in the last 3 months I’ve seen a lot come back :)
---
Today you said:
---
&gt; CCP I have been a loyal customer for 15 years. You have my support in whatever direction you take us.
---
Oh nobody ever doubted that there was noch Chance of adding this.
---
The question is more like at what price will this come and thats a bill CCP is about to get presented soon imo.
---
I know how this ends and it's definitely a win for beaurocracy.
---
I think you're very wrong. I gank ratters in wh space all the time and I dont have a cloak on any of my ships but my sabre
---
Inb4 all comments deleted....
---
I love the smell of Exterminatus in the morning.
---
They are fixing clusterfuck, tidi and all the overload problems. soon will be not enough player to make a fight 1000 players anymore, then all problems solved :)
---
In your response you sound more like you are upset changes have been implemented and you are having a hard time adjusting or seeing other options as game play. That's normal to be honest.
---
As such, what is the VAST majority of content you're talking about ? I'm counting a few things in NS :
---
\- Exploration : Doesn't see cyno often
---
\- Mining (and gas cause well nullsec gas is a joke) : Include getting cyno in place to move rorquals, defense fleet, defense response when attacked, attacker escalation
---
\- Industry : Enough said that industry needs cyno on a daily basis
---
\- Anomaly &amp; Belt ratting : Well, attack escalation &amp; defense response, you don't cyno your super in anomalies
---
\- Escalation ratting : Mostly cyno blobs behind enemy lines
---
\- Incusions : Everyones does it in supers these days
---
\- Roaming pvp &amp; defense : probably involve cynos way more than roamers would like if we just read reddit, right ?
---
\- Sov warfare : sov warfare between mid to large size entities involves cynos in almost every timer there can be.
---
Is there anything I missed ?
---
Depending on your favorite, it could be cynos aren't involved. It doesn't mean cyno aren't involved in almost every activity in nullsec these days and it doesn't matter if you like it, or think it is unbalanced, it is simply a fact regarding the current state of NS.
---
You can never be entirely certain about it.  For example, did Olmeca delete any posts?  I was always taught, "if you don't know your error, you haven't made a measurement".  This is true in physics but it's not true in many other disciplines that seem to think that "if you don't know your error, include the sources of error such that the error bars favour your conclusion".  I don't think that's happening here but it's worth some consideration as it isn't physics.
---
So, you don't have a cloak on your scanning ship/scout? Calling bs on that, lol
---
It's unhealthy this thread exists, that an individual spent three hours preparing this argument because someone on the internet and at least 2 people on different podcasts uttered the "goons weren't effected as much" narrative which obviously holds some truth in it (hence why someone would try so hard to disprove, if there were no truth in the statement the compulsion necessarily wouldn't be so strong to correct the record).
---
Is Olmeca racist? No, but he has that compulsion and it materializes as his over-the-top disdain for the goons. Hatred is powerful but it would be healthier if mere competition was the causation, as is the case with normal player interactions and trashtalk. 
---
In short, not what I want to see a human spending hours of time pursuing.
---
Gtfo with your toxic bullshit
---
I try to min/max every single aspect of every single activity in EVE. It's something I enjoy in life in generally tbh, the process of working it out and nailing the min/max is the fun for me. Once I've worked it out and proved that theory right a couple times I pretty much completely lose interest. This is why I've constantly found crazy good ways of making ISK but am perpetually semi space poor.
---
I've never _not_ did something because it was min/maxed because my experience is that other people suck at min/maxing so  I want to take a look at it myself and either work out a better way or prove them right trying.
---
At a macro level null sec politics are probably the best example of this. Objectively the "best" way to win in null right now is just to recruit a lot of people, give them a safe home to rat/mine. However it's actually a really boring thing to do and basically every single content creator/FC in the game fucking hates it. Yet most still do it.
---
I still have dread out in nowhere. I am invested in my SIG Space Violence, having the option to fight Horde closer to their systems would be something but that would mean 6 jumps to the stager, so 6 lit cynos until I would arrive. Nothing you can do fast anyway because of the timers. Now im just stuck, with the option to either just throw it into the mouth of a Darkness or whatever fleet, hope to sell it for a fraction of what its worth or let it stay in no mans land to forget a 2.4b ship
---
Thanks CCP for making the game better!
---
Amazing!
---
Looks like throwing down a cyno is still possible and requires timing, skill and a bit of planning - far more engaging gameplay as the old "put cyno on every ship and press button"
---
A
---
I think u/fuzzmiester once posted a breakdown of the costs and if I remember correctly the CSM members still had to spent a large amount of their own money because CCP just covers the flight (and the hotel I think?). 
---
Sorry, I am on mobile, can't find the post.
---
You are real life cursed now.
---
Ops I got banned.
---
Well. Just remember once asset safety is gone in nullsec, the next logical step to make wormholes more dangerous will be no structures at all.
---
It was under the premise of new group content.
---
Lol someone down voted me. He asked a question and I answered it. Ffs this place is full of retards
---
Right but I'm not bringing my scanner to kill the ratter. Which is what you said happens. "Bring cloakies to kill ratters" I think you've watched too many wingspan videos or met no forks too much
---
God. damn.
---
Objectively by your own definition you are no better than a bot that does the same thing...  Making mining a more engaging activity would make bots harder to produce you just wont be able to run 50 accounts at once doing a pointless mundane afk money making.  If you want afk go do PI.
---

0.0 needs more of your people. Actually taking out BS to fight BS and not overdropping caps.
---
props to you.
---
Well, ignoring the fact that the straw man Olmeca has set up isn’t even a very common (or new) argument, his data ignores most of the reasons why big groups are less impacted by economic changes - they’re big. They have stockpiles. Yes, a nerf nerfs everyone the same. But if I tell you I’m taking half your food on your plate, and you have a fully stocked fridge, it’s different than if you’re starving in the desert. Jafeelzy?
---
They cant afford to keep the chat servers up and running. What makes you think they can afford a SSL cert.
---
Because on the internet, behind the veil of anonymity, it's important to project power to your peers and flex on them at all times.
---
On this sub, there are certain, very ~~un~~spoken rules.
---
You must hate null blocs.
---
You must hate miners.
---
You must not tolerate players who do not play like you want them to.
---
You're not allowed to like mining or ratting. The only acceptable form of isk making is through exploration.
---
You must downvote anything posted by stainguy, olmeca, and anyone with flair related to Test or Goons, because they - and only they - are responsible for every problem in EVE, full stop.
---
Lastly,  if you try to escape from an unwanted or unwinnable PvP scenario so that way you don't die and lose your ship, it's because you're a bot.
---
I'm a simple man. I see an Olmeca Gold post. I down vote.
---
Everyone takes a break. I’ve taken a few over my 15 years but I’ve always come back
---
Ya chaos is code for fuck with nullsec. It's a bullshit line.
---
&gt;when people bring ships to kill ratters, they bring cloakies
---
I can't think of a single serious jspace pvp group that does this. 
---
The
---
&gt;hyperspatial dictor, that warps directly to a cloaked ship or a bookmark made by the cloaked ship
---
is the only way to go. Except that you rarely warp to a bookmark: they take too long to propagate.
---
The assertion that you have total control over entrances and exits to your system is belied literally by your own comment when you bring up K162s from people rolling in. And that assertion is what I was originally responding to. It's utter bullshit, and that's why I'd like to know if it's a deliberate lie or if the people propagating it are just that incapable of absorbing new information. :) Sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice, after all.
---
His KB tends to agree with the first one and not the second.
---
So... what you are saying is that playing for 11 years, with breaks in it... makes you a loyal customer for 15 years?
---
Yea, sorry, Fuck you. I like being aware of gankers in my system with one quick look.
---
And who are you going to kill when there are no pve players for you to gank.
---
&gt;I know how this ends

Space court?

Honestly if you weren't blue to the entire game you wouldn't have to roam that long.

&gt;If you are incredulous that someone could make so many assumptions based on just raw numbers and assume that a trend that could be completely coincidental or the result of dozens of other variables besides the Blackout, then you, sir, got the point of this joke.  
---
I applaude this rather high quality shitpost but you need a lesson in joking. Explaining is usually a nono. Either a joke is not hard to understand and thus doesn't need to be explained (good) or it's hardcto understand and needs an explaination 2hich makes it unfunny (bad).  
---
This joke wasn't hard to understand so the additional explaination lowers the post quality. All in all i'd give it an 8.5/10.  
---
/useless post analysis
---
&gt;Yet most still do it.
---
Because if you don't then the result is to get stamped on by those that do.
---
See the last 2 years in null.
---
Oh my. 
---
11 years thanks for reminding me. I didn’t have the time to login and check
---
I approve of /u/BBTB2's analysis of this post.
---
it's a confirmed downtrend.
---
Doesn't make him loyal, the numbers don't matter after that.
---
Any data on his reddit alts ?
---
Almost loyal for almost 15 years
---
This is useful.
---
CSM doesn't listen to us, why would CCP?
---
The scanner provides the warpin. The Sabre warps fast enough that a ratting battleship can’t escape. Then the non-cloaky dps comes through. 
---
But the point is, as soon as the Sabre decloaks, the ratter is dead. There is no longer any possible move to escape. 
---
I’m not saying that people use the cloaky t3s for actual dps, but they do use cloaky ships to get initial tackle or a dictor warpin.
---
I myself can't wait for the October release!
---
Looking forward to the next move from CCP.
---
I've enjoyed the last ones. They have not brought chaos, but rather much needed disruption and increased risk.
---
"Why aren't there more people on here talking about how great these changes are and are instead complaining that the game is going downhill" Hmmmm, yes a mystery.
---
It sounds like we need a special investigation instead.
---
Thanks CCP for putting effort in developing this game its something few can appreciate to its fair value.
---
Yeah, I think the point was really well made in a comment I saw a few days ago: When one's stated objective is to "ruin your game", how shocking is it when that person becomes bored because all opposition simply stops playing the game? 
---
Most content creators don't mind a feed, but feeding the same blob of blue donut edgelords over and over and over isn't engaging gameplay - especially when the typical member of those groups seems so entitled and arrogant yet so unskilled. For me, scaling back my time in eve wasn't so much about finding a better game - so much as finding a more intelligent and reasonable community.
---
Can you rerun the analysis for Stainguy?
---
let's see that data bro
---
You can check how many years have passed since 2008 with any Calendar and some simple math.
---
hahahahahahahahaha
---
Exaggerates something to give self credibility. Responds with sarcasm and snark. That's a bold move Cotton, let's see if it pays off.
---
Sabre decloaks? Wtf.
---
Also one mjd and your escape
---
You have no idea what you're talking about and it shows
---
Moons are trash. Only the good moongoo makes money. The rest is just regular ore that you can get in any anom really.
---
it cost about 10 billion to build one from a researched BPO 
---
so 2 billion for overhead is a nice profit margin for the builder. ( this assumes you literally by all the cap parts and don't build those ) 
---
Some random super fit costs like 6/7 billion including t2 rigs, still putting the total below 20 billion. 
---
Injectors are really not gonna drive the price up all that much, let's say you need like 20 injectors for it so that puts it up to 40 billion for a full super. 
---
Now let's say you make your isk in highsec, so you can make like a 100 million an hour in highsec if you known what your doing ( burners/incursions etc ). 
---
so that would mean a total of 400 hours in eve get's you into a super, not exactly a massive wall. 
---
that would mean 4 hours a day spend on your super fund would get one into one from scratch in about 3 months.
---
It's the top post on the sub a whole 30 minutes after you made this comment.  
---
Breath of fresh air tbh.
---
I put together this highly scientific and unbiased chart to illustrate why this is important:

He noted that it was imperfect because we don't have 2 years of blackout data. I already fully agree with that and was transparent on this agreement. He didn't take trivial issues with definitions, where the cutoff of "umbrella" is, and so on.
---
You just want to hate mate.
---
You aren’t contributing anything worth while, please take note of my post and try to hold a healthy debate.
---
&gt;In other words, you can't link them. Got it. I don't think theres any reason to continue this chat, is there?
---
I think you read my response incorrectly. It's not that I can't link them, it's that I choose not to. Because I don't have to. If you can''t see the forest from the trees that isn't my issue to resolve. 
---
&gt;I don't think theres any reason to continue this chat, is there?
---
No problem, thanks for the conversation. The world has many lenses through which it can be seen but some people chose to only use one.
---
Funnest (imo) ships to fly in the game, always useful.

I haven't played EVE in 3 years yet im still subbed here for the quality of shit posts that r/Eve produces. I'm proud to say that you deserve my upvote even though it is worthless.

omg no you called me a n*ob 😳😳😳

This was a fun brawl, enjoyed the content a lot. Although i knew that mistakes in our FC team has been made it's nice to see it from the opponents side, gives a better view on where to start improvements.

Shitters on /r/EVE : NERF FRIENDS
---
CCP : Nerfs friends
---
People with friends : fuck CCP and fuck this game
---
pics or didnt happen
---
Yes your holiday still costs money even if the trip and hotel are free, big deal.
---
my gila  beated up few but timer ended.
---
Ok, I should have been more clear. The actual dps ships are rarely cloaky, i'm not saying otherwise. What I am saying, is that by the time anything shows up on dscan, it is too late for the ratters to respond. The cloaky scout gets an initial warpin, the hyperspatial dictor warps there and gets a bubble up before a ratting battleship can align out, and then the dps ships come and finish it off. 
---
The ratters need to be watching holes in order to catch the first cloaky scout coming through, and then safe up, or they will die. Dscan won't help unless you rat while aligned, which isn't possible in j space b/c MTUs. 
---
&gt;The assertion that you have total control over entrances and exits to your system is belied literally by your own comment when you bring up K162s from people rolling in
---
If people roll in, you see the sig spawn and dock up, then reship to pvp ships/rollers, get control of the wormhole and roll it. Or if you want to go max krab, bring AB battleships with scram (so they can scram each other in order to not get booshed off), and roll the hole regardless of any enemy ships camping it. Then you go back to krabbing. You can't just krab 24/7, but you get warning of enemies in time to get safe, and after you roll them out they can't get back in easily.
---
quite the opposite is the case...
---
i would like to thank everybody for not bringing shitty blackout propaganda into this nice friday friendship thread...
---
quite the opposite is the case..
---
He probably just finished training for T2 missiles and is on a ratting high roll with his raven and this was his moment to shine for reddit.
---
What value is there in debating with someone that purposely misrepresents information as you have so willingly proved you are ready to do? This is not be bashing you, but a valid question and all to often the answer for most people is: zero. When someone misrepresents information or themselves in their opening statement, they have conceded they will continue the discussion in the same manner and any accurate information presented to them would simply be ignored as they have demonstrated they are only interested in how they want to portray the information for the desired result or outlook.
---
Can you imagine how much shit would die?
---
It'd be glorious
---
Again, first time was Incarna.
---
Your first assertion that you built this entire post off is wrong. Wormholes make more isk than nullsec and nullsec just ate two large nerfs.
---
I just re-subbed and really enjoy the Abyssal content, so I'm not 100 percent up to speed on this stuff.  I do have to say this particular room is pretty shitty game design.  Absolute death the first time you see it and trivially easy from that point on.
---
Yeah - I should have taken more time to explain what was left out.
---
He left out multiple important nullsec regions that fall under the "umbrella" categories. When the data is evaluated of "notable nullsec mining value", where notable nullsec = umbrella generating groups, it is analyzed for both pre and post black out. Those pre and post blackout numbers are then compared with the pre and post TOTAL nullsec numbers. From this we can derive the increase or decrease of notable nullsec mining values vs. restofnullsec. When properly evaluated the data illustrates a shrinking mining value share for non-notable nullsec and an increasing overall mining value share of notable nullsec.
---
Goons do claim whatever change CCP can implement will hurt others more than them. My data only aims disprove that claim.
---
I don't claim such division between goons and the rest so it's just your prejudice about me speaking there .
---
Glad you liked it. I was on my way home when all of this started going down and wasn't able to log in until the fight was over... Some alliance exec I am :)  
---
Never the less. We need people keeping the fight up in game. Creating content and having fun. Even though it may have been an isk loss on our end and all of our mistakes came to light :). Everyone had a blast fighting.  
---
This is what we love to do. It's part of the game and should be looked at like that.  
---
I commend you @test for not spinning this off as some cancer post of being the all mighty dinos.  
---
10/10.
---
I don't think I can count that high.
---
This is true and a good argument for min maxing leading to stagnation. 
---
Have we min maxed eve to death?
---
Ccp is famously bad at iterating so I wouldn't hold my breath in this being a short term fix while they develop a long term solution.
---
I heard there are good moons in NS. How comes you are no mining them ?
---
&gt;they’re big. They have stockpiles 
---
You're making the mistake to even consider he could be taking something like this into account, it's completely irrelevant for his reasoning. Hes just looking at income. And regarding that hes not completely wrong by the data available *so far*
---
I thought the same thing, so there is empirical evidence.
---
bcs there is no reason to wage war and no reward
---
I only se...... Nvm
---
In terms of CSM reporting on their Paris syndrome just remember that most people have a typically negative experience when they see for the first time the inside of any management organization.
---
If you're coming into CSM from any background other than management you are 100% going to leave with the conclusion that everyone is an idiot simply because you won't have the background to communicate anything to anyone to understand your knowledge limitations as an outsider or take away anything other than negativity from breaches of your expectations.
---
This issue is compounded by the fact that CCP has to choose what to tell CSM. It's not free for all it's need to know so they might intentionally miss details that would make their direction more coherent.
---
I think Hilmar has been crystal clear about the direction in the recent interviews and anything else is simply not being able to handle seeing how a real world company operates because you come from a sausage factory background into a company management situation. This is also assuming that the people reporting on those issues are doing so in good faith which is far from clear these days :)
---
Take it to the next logical step. The playerbase is aging, pilots leaving for more responsibility or death. Retention bottoms out when death is quantifiable as a way people leave the game and most games don't sport those 30+ year old playerbases. 
---
So from a business perspective, you really need to focus on new players and enough to replace the people who die or move on in life one of which will inevitably happen. A game like fortnite won't see that in it's lifecycle because the playerbase is so young. 
---
It's easy to miss this because it's not what we naturally think about when considering these issues. Death is a bigger factor every single year and quite the unnatural concern.
---
I didn't really take much care in the comment chain, just wanted to add this bit as it's an interesting feature of our aging IP. Not to deter from your position that player retention is hurting, just a remidner that an ever-growing percentage of that means CCP has to target new users if it somehow wants to last in the long run.
---
Food for thought
---
i love gassing bees
---
TbH, I never dropped below 7 in agent standings, but I also did not know that you can go so low on agent standing. Only question I still have, does the low agent standing not lower income? I had the feeling that LP-Payouts dropped on lower standing after some declines?
---
&gt; Objectively
---
There's objectively a fastest way to mine. A fastest average clear time. A tankiest titan. Etc.
---
There's not objectively a "best" way to play any part of the game though, because what is "best" depends entirely on the person doing the playing.
---
This is objectively false.
---
I enjoy min maxing as well. I've been in a corp where someone else was better at it and was "guiding" me to the activities that make the most isk. It got boring though since someone else was solving the issues and hard lining that this is the best way. 
---
What was most frustrating was that he was usually right. But again. The fun is finding the solution. No one likes it when you spoil the ending.
---
&gt;Sabre decloaks? Wtf. 
---
The sabre jumps in, gets gatecloak. As soon as it breaks it (decloaks), the ratter has a couple seconds notice before being bubbled and scrammed.
---
Most ratters don't have an mjd fit, since they need the room for other stuff to actually rat, so they have to refit off the depot. That gives you plenty of time to get scram with the sabre. 
---
If you are ratting with an mjd, with mjd skills trained up so it spools quickly, you can escape. But most ratters aren't in this category.
---
You have it backwards, the vocal minority was what lead to these changes.
---
Lol so making you have to play with other people more actively rather than being able to watch Netflix while super ratting with your finger on the ping button is nerfing friendship in EVE way to opposite land this whole thing.
---
&gt; by the time anything shows up on dscan, it is too late for the ratters to respond.
---
FC what is "Large Micro Jump Drive"
---
The time is now for sweet, juicy, karma. The standard of posting required to get upvotes right now is at an all time low because we've been flooded with such low quality whining about blackout and cynos. This, is actually quite good though
---
I wonder too.
---
Spall liner and controlled impact would like a word with you friend :)
---
is that actual reddit statistics of page views?
---
haha... people are unsubbing for many reasons. IDK why. All I look for in playing is a home and a good group of people to play with.  
---
so far, it's achieved such and will continue to do so.  
---
I just hope the rest of eve can do the same.
---
I am not, and never have been, one of your haters. I give you shit when you earn it, and I give you credit when you earn it. 
---
I just don't think your analysis is good and your conclusions valid. I think the methodology is flawed, the data is unavailable and what is available is imprecise, and I think you're going to be influencing a lot of people to think something is happening that isn't.  That's not hate, just my opinion.
---
I apologise for putting 15 years when it was in fact 11. It was an honest mistake, I was downstairs writing this post on my mobile and not in front of my computer looking at dates. I was not intentionally trying to deceive you. Please get over it and take note of my other points and again thank you for pointing out my mistake. I have edited the main body of the text
---
yes continue :D please tell me, how is this going to bring in new players and shake lets say Imperium?
---
it wont.
---
Funnily enough, Imperium isn't the largest coalition atm (Dotlan numbers, excluding renters):
---
\- Legacy (including the russians and AOM) = 46.659 characters
---
\- Imperium = 46.372 characters
---
\- PanFam + WinterCo = 39.286 characters
---
Most ratters don't have enough mid slots to keep a mjd ready the whole time, and by the time they refit the dictor will have scram. If they're spamming dscan, have mjd ready, then yes, they can probably escape. But most ratters aren't in that category
---
&gt;Most ratters don't have an mjd fit, since they need the room for other stuff to actually rat, so they have to refit off the depot. That gives you plenty of time to get scram with the sabre.
---
No, this just means you're doing it \*incredibly\* wrong. Did you get caught once by someone who got lucky and decide MJDs just weren't worth it at all?
---
The part that im concerned with is if you have a newbie who is looking for help on which activities to do or they find most enjoyable. If you team up with a veteran who has min maxed, does that newbie lose out on opportunities to do something they like because they are being told to focus on getting into x doctrine. 
---
This is most prevelant in null sec but it happens in all areas. Wormholers are probably the second most guilty of this besides major low sec groups.
---
Asset safety was the tradeoff for turning player owned stations which were not destroyable, into citadels.
---
&gt; the risk for getting suicide ganked in HS is much higher than a fast gank squad going unnoticed through your space intel networks to do a quick hit and run on a single member of 7,000 online people.
---
Do you know how to reduce that risk to 0? Have less than 200 mil in cargo for every 10,000 EHP against EMP ammo. If you can not figure out how to do that you are truly mentally deficient. I carried 1.5 bil through highsec on a T1 industrial with zero problems.
---
Nonono, thats simply the derivitive
---
your contribution is bullshit and lies..... does that mean its worthy?
---
The core of the game wasn't hurt with the latest changes though. It was hurt by the constant flow of damaging changes that were implemented over the last couple of years: sov, citadels, capitals, anyomaly spawn rates, moon goo changes. Basically everything the null blocs needed to get their massive empire building projects going into insane effectiveness levels.  
---
CCP made a few drastic changes which helped a lot in stopping the downfall of Eve's economy. The game can still very likely die if they don't heavily iterate on the broken parts (see list above), but neither goonswarm nor Test will like these changes initially.
---
Increasing the reward was something they have already muted at. The game will be healthier if things are balanced

No, my praxis fit just doesn't have enough room for a mjd unless I take off the shield booster, which I can't do while ratting for obvious reasons. Like I said, I haven't ever lost a ratting ship in a wormhole, because I don't rat without scouts up, and relying on the mjd means you are cutting things way too close.
---
They are pleased with nullsec making no money but seem more than happy that wspace nearly eclispes them in even greater safety. So no ccp has 0 clue what they are doing.
---
Post still says 15 years
---
I can take that at face value. You don't owe me an apology, this is mean space pixel pvp chat room. For all of the times I might do any good r/eve poster credit with throwing shit up, my commentary here was straight forward. Anyway, cheers and all that. Also, because this is reddit - poop on you.
---
You know most people fly in one day, spend the next 4 days in a meeting room, then fly out again, right?
---
I don't know about you, but that's not really enticing as a holiday.
---
Like I said, the vast majority doesn't rely on cynos.
---
Your mining doesn't rely on cynos once rorquals are imported, as you can easily gate between the systems on a rotation.
---
Industry may use cynos for imports and exports but doesn't rely on them, as no industry acti ities require cynos, just the trade parts, which can also use wormholes competitively now.
---
Reducing cyno usage on attack escalation and defense response is exactly the goal of the change.
---
So really, only sov warfare particularly relys on cynos, and this change doesn't dramatically affect that anyway.
---
i agree, balance. So stomping on few is achieving it? why not work the game out in meaningful way
---
You think casuals doing pve are the vocal minority? The vocal minority are pvp crybabies who want easy content spoon fed. Casuals are the ones running this game and they are now quitting silently cause they dont like chaos. 
---
The outcry against the changes is coming from people who always have been vocal about them leading large groups cause they see 30-40% decrease in their groups activities.
---
I like how claim the larger player base is good with this change as we see less and less people playing.
---
thats the way she goes
---
Love to see that.
---
Indeed, NPE is in dire need of a complete overhaul.
---
Take a look at this thread to see some suggestions:
---
\&gt; Most ratters don't have enough mid slots to keep a mjd ready the whole time
---
... what's your jcode pls
---
Show me the ascended one who can super rat and watch netflix at the same time.
---
On a typical Iceland trip we arrive at 7am on Sunday on a red-eye with no sleep. We check into our hotel, get ready for the day, and spend Sunday trying not to keel over from exhaustion.
---
On Monday we wake up to go to the CCP office where we sit in a conference room all day. Some eat at the CCP cafeteria for free. Some of us go out for lunch which is typically $25-30 on the low end. We go back to the office, finish up around 5-6pm. Go back to the hotel, go meet for drinks, grab dinner, sometimes after dinner drinks. Then back to the hotel and repeat for the week.
---
It is not a vacation, it is business travel where not only are we unpaid, our expenses aren't even covered.
---
So why do you have a dread out in nowhere?
---
That just makes ratting easier for farm holes. 
---
Because now getting rolled in unless your running dreads ( when it doesn't matter either way because you stuck ) now gives you more time to escape as the locals still have to probe the hole ( that's 3/4 seconds extra escape time ), your own static is easily door stopped with a carrier or battleship, so it doesn't seem all that effective in increasing the risk in running sites. 
---
a 1/2 minute spawn delay on the k162 would solve the harm it does to people rolling in, while still being equally effective.
---
When I was young I worried about it. 
---
Now that EVE is priority #15123 in life I just PLEX, welp shit and ignore ZKILL because I stand no chance against the army of people who have more time to devote.
---
Ccp has been so good at retaining new players, I am sure they will succeed this time and replace the thousands of players who left.
---
How long were you breast fed for you thin skinned bitch?
---
What if you live in a wormhole you say? Wormhole space was introduced as a more dangerous space than nullsec, which from its inception had no asset safety and offered higher rewards with the increased risk.  This was the fine print people accepted when they decided to move into this brand new wormhole space and the style of life different from all others like null, low and high are all different than each other.
---
Comparing wh to null in regards to asset safety is completely disingenuous at best
---
Nobody really wastes an equipment slot on spall liners in 2019 tbh
---
I'm usually memeing when i say it but the E50M is pretty mediocre in the current meta due to armor power creep resulting in everyone just loading gold, hull armor doesn't hold up at all and you tend to die going for rams unless it's late game
---
Or rorq mine doesn't matter the fact is the changes mean subcap fleets are needed more to establish grid control and be able to drop your umbrella. You'll still be able to do exactly what you did before now you have to do it with a few more roles involved - a cyno guy or two more subcap organisation etc. 
---
But sure you can eat the propaganda and be like "EVE hates gons so they nerfed nullsec"
---
Ya they want to change the kind of player to non existant. You supposed pvpers seem to think that you will have constant hunting grounds as ccp works to drive everyone out of nullsec. You don't seem to grasp that has this game continues off the cliff you won't have anyone to hunt.
---
&gt; To the vocal minority. I don’t mind you having issues with the current direction. I feel you should voice those concerns but this last week there have been countless posts from the same people showing eve offline data and lots of statistical analysis carried out by keyboard warriors with the conclusion that eve is finally dying. It has been dying for years. That’s the meme. 
---
This is still the same post, same as every other "blackout/cyno changes are bad/good" are still the same posts.
---
What people fail to consider is this is a war krabs vs roamers with standard people in the middle trying to sort the shit out of this mess.
---
&gt; Go further with this chaos. Burn these empires to the ground and something new and exciting will come out of it. You have the data, you have the metrics. Increase the reward for those willing to take the risk but make sure there is risk. 
---
Why should CCP burn the empires they themselves encouraged players to form ? For the sake of what, the game health ? That would finish killing it. What you want is incentive to split because there is either something to gain by doing it, or because there is nothing to gain by being in a mega coalition.  Sadly, the way Eve players behave is "let's burn everything we see" (which is fine, mind you), leading to people trying to secure their assets and farming grounds, leading to people massing together in a big ball of security.
---
Blackout is a way to please the PvP part of the game by shitting on the PvE part with no balance whatsoever. You said it yourself : increase the rewards and keep the risk. Guess CCP will do that in 2 or 3 decades. Is blackout a change that can bring something and shake up nullsec ? Sure. Is its current implementation doing that ? Well, eh, no.
---
Cyno changes are a way to try to defuse the supercapital force in mega coalitions, by shitting on industrial players and every other playstyles and pleasing even more the lone roamers gettings free 350M kills whenever they see a cyno, instead of limiting it on certains capitals (e.g faxes so we can keep throwing titans at each others) and limiting it to some subcaps that are not nullified/3M ships but not either loot pinatas that people need to specially train in. Guess CCP will add other ships to the list in 7 years and a half.
---
&gt; The players still left in nullsec are those that PvP. They clearly PvE on the side and so this is not a bash against PvE but instead a note that those who now live in null are there and willing to fight for it. The core issues of the game are finally being addressed and people who expect something for nothing are finally finding out that this game is not for them. 
---
How do you know core issues of the game are being adressed ? What about citadel proliferation ? What about the sov system ? What about wormhole being safe havens of krablands ? What about Factional Warfare and lowsec being irrelevant ? What about incusion and abyss money ? What about skill injectors ? What about capital being impossible to balance between "OP" and "Totally useless pile of shit" ? What about goddamn SHIP BALANCE ?
---
We got promise of changes, balance, unicorns and such ? What CCP did actually deliver : Half-baked changes with no iteration. 
---
What information do YOU have than are proof-enough CCP will do something about the "core issues" of Eve ? Unless you're one of these people that are thinking nullsec people are the problem and being able to kills them better and more often with a small gang is the way to go with the game, no core issue has been adresssed at all by any of these changes, just adding more problems. 
---
Your post is the same as the other posts with keyboard warriors and vocal minority members, you advocate for things you don't even understand, while ignoring other people.
---
For you, we got rid of the people that wanted everything without doing anything. We got rid of those not willing to fight. I don't think you understand that this is almost everyone in this damn game.
---
You can like PvP and want to do your farming in peace. You can be the guy that setup half of Delve and just want to enjoy the fruits of his labor, you can be someone that hasn't had much time recently and focus on building his wallet for more pvp later. You can buy the broke PvP guy that needs his wallet back, you can be an industrialist whose gameplay is empowering his mates to do pvp for him while he build. 
---
I will stop there with example, but all that thinking leaves me no hope of ever seeing something remotely interesting ever being debated here.
---
Oh man I love statistics and percentiles backed with nothing!!!!!! 😂
---
For 3 years I have argued that CCP can implement diminishing returns and nerfs for alliances growing larger and larger, blobs getting more crowded.
---
For 3 years the people enjoying the blue donut status quo told me how whatever CCP can do, it will nerf others more than the largest blobs. Or it will benefit largest blobs more than others. And they told me it's just the social nature of things.
---
Today and yesterday I have presented data showing that some largest groups have been nerfed more than the smaller groups by blackout. People making that argument to me never bothered to base their claims on data or any fact. They just based on their narrow and uneducated opinion about how Eve works, informed by how they want Eve to work. 
---
You can send your zealous null members to brigade my topics. You can take trivial jabs at my data. You can memefy my posts. You can hide behind humor in attempts to chip away from my legitimacy. I have been subjected to that metagame for years. It didn't matter. I kept speaking my truth, I structured the non-blob mentality and ways of thinking about Eve, and that truth prevailed. It reached the people it needed to reach, and it is still reaching them.

I am largely supportive of the changes, even though they are admittedly half-baked. Another redditor said it best the other day day: 
---
"CCP should have never allowed the game to progress to the point where capitals and supercapitals are valid methods of solo play. They need to return the game to a state where these ships require support from friends. Getting there is going to be painful" (paraphrased).

Nailed it.

I was told to do  some stats on the reward of the mission, noting also agent, corp and faction standing each time.

I can't tell for faction, but I can say that agent and corporation faction have exactly zero effect on the LP reward, and invisble effect on isk rewards.

I grouped the mission by LP reward. Then I made plotted the (standing, iskreward)

I'm pretty new.  Blackout isn't really what's making the game interesting and none of the things CCP is talking about changing address what is actually driving me to look for another game to play.
---
Because at some point SV was operating there. I want able to participate in the moveop with the dread and now its stranded. I dont really understand what the why is for? Fact is that it now now almost impossible for one person to move any capital ships that arent jumpfreighters. I dont have the funds to just throw away a cap and buy a new one. I cant use the cap with the pvp group i would like to use it and it would be high strain on the group to secure one single cap to move.

The only balancing you appear to be interested in is that of Helmars Testicles on your chin

Well Olmeca
---
your constant pitching and whining on bad bad Goons and other MegaAlliances slowly starts getting fruits.  Your hate will kill Imperium one day.
---
Everyone now is so pissed about this Hilmtard Chaos shit that logging in becomes harder and harder each day. Well, goons less that other Nullsec dwellers, but still.  Soon all will be gone and you can fly solo around Delve and all Nullsec space just as you can do now on Singularity with your 720 accounts.
---
Seems like you really make it by whining constantly. So
---
A.  Please never ever speak about caring about EVE or the players or any other crap you constantly post.  You care for yourself, just feeding your own hate  and you dont care for anyone or anything else.
---
B. Please unsub your 720 acccounts when Nullsec blocks start to strike back on CCP and start killing the Highsec player base, starting to hurt CCP income and killing the game (when it has to die anyway)  in a huge ball of fire.
---
C (just a personal wish of me)  Stop posting your useless shit.
---
Doesn't matter. He made threats to other players and I'm glad to see him removed for it.

&gt; Your mining doesn't rely on cynos once rorquals are imported, as you can easily gate between the systems on a rotation. 
---
Everyone knows all the systems are next to each other in a sequential way and gating capitals is absolutely not AIDS.
---
&gt; Industry may use cynos for imports and exports but doesn't rely on them, as no industry acti ities require cynos, just the trade parts, which can also use wormholes competitively now. 
---
Most of your active stuff as an industrialist in a mid to high size alliance is moving stuff around. Don't tell me starting production in the industry window is the most time consuming process. Wormhole are useless for an industrialist unless they want something quickly moved to/from jita. Planning is not made with wormholes.
---
&gt;Reducing cyno usage on attack escalation and defense response is exactly the goal of the change.
---
So you actually agree this has an impact on theses activities, right ? As they were relyng on cyno before.
---
&gt;So really, only sov warfare particularly relys on cynos, and this change doesn't dramatically affect that anyway.
---
Let me guess, you've never done sov warfare in the last 5 years ? It is fucking with everything there.
---
Your point was the last changes didn't have that much of an impact, but it actually has much of a impact. That you think most of these activities should and could be done without cyno doesn't change that fact in any way?
---
Good good, one more step to ccp killing off the game
---
From what I got in the little discussion I had with him just under this one is I think he is in some sort of denial phase. i bet many null bloc members are there at the moment. hard to take these ppl serious. I am sure they are all nice and good ppl but ccp catered the farmville playstyle so hard over the past 3 years that those that were in D-Team alliances or HS players/playstyles previously feel like they are good at pvp and "winning" in their new null blocs. Everyone likes winning after all.
---
Most of the ppl I played with over the past years just dont play anymore because their PVP game just deteriorated over this timeframe. Many just moved on and wont come back now. Many of the old talent is gone..tbf for more reasons than just the game itself though. Some sort of point no return is already passed too IMO.
---
I dont even want to know how many fresh players just joined the big blocs and never learned anything else about the game than just doing farmville and getting paps once in a while rather than learning the game indepth. So where are the new content creators who is replacing the old talent....sad...very sad

That narrative would make sense if you could bridge subcaps on field to establish grid control. A bomber fleet will always be more mobile/have the initiative since their cyno can be off grid and they can warp cloaked.
---
I will admit I was one of the people who was at least a little concerned about cyno vigils - but my suggestion to ccp in a previous discussion was to just give us a candle firework. 
---
However getting an alt into a cyno sigil is at least easier than training up to cov ops so that's okay with me.
---
Wharp. Drive. Active.
---
If you use humor to undermine my points and contribute to the null blob echo chamber don't expect me to appreciate how funny it is.
---
I want to add to this that in my time on the CSM, the most important things the CSM has done are the things you will never know about.
---
noody is too good for zun you heathen
---
I'm enjoying the game a lot lately
---
I'd love to see a fit for this, I dont even understand how you could get an ibis to 20k ehp
---
So what you're in your home space with a gigantic numerical advantage and rorqs still have massive tank and a PANIC so you get time to form up.
---
That would still be harsher than stations. Once your enemy clears out a system it would be gone, there's no stations to redeem to once your structures are all gone in null.
---
You might be memeing, but you can just run straight to the gate, clear webs, and jump out without killing everything. In this type of room only.
---
What about buff to speed and web and scram but lower armor shield. Make it great for chasing down and tackling but not for solo use. Maybe even give it a bonus for tackling caps?
---
By player-base you must mean afk krabs and bots.  
---
If you dont like it - than leave dude. Save us your whiny bullshit and leave - YOU are the problem.
---
Not true, I killed a Nyx in a Tengu.
---
I never claimed such a thing you are putting words in my mouth. What I said was his thought of the game being in a state of total cluster-fuck is his own opinion.
---
It should be, because this shit is actually funny.
---
CCPlease: cheap solution to fix FW: nerf FW mission LP payout.
---
FW LP is then driven solely on the supply from O-plexing and D-plexing.  This greatly increases the risk vs reward ratio of LP payout and thus the items associated with it in the LP store.
---
Nagh they just need to keep going. This shake-up is needed
---
FYI you can beat the room pretty easily if you know what you are doing. The loot is kinda the same has a full t5 run.
---
&gt;people suck at min/maxing 
---
&gt;so I spend time trying to squeeze a few percent out of solved problems
---
&gt;Example 5: GOONS even SRPd the lost legacy Titans

---
And all the people showed you how your data was wrong --__--;
---
So you should turn alitle down your imagination where you belive you are right.
---
I think I saw a vid with someone actually getting the loot from that room in the frigate version.
---
Stay out of range/kite the leshaks a bit while you shoot the bioadaptive can and use an mtu to pull the loot in.
---
IIRC it was a good amount of loot as well since you needed at least two of the frigates to collect all of it.
---
Olmeca has made it clear that we've never actually stopped with the grr Olmeca.
---
TBH I've never clicked it. I let killmail generation be the feedback to CCP that I'm enjoying the game.
---
&gt;...but was discouraged or turned away entirely because of min-maxxing.
---
Yep, I've had that before. It was often a serious pain-point between FCs of different TZs. I'd been pulled aside for conversations a few times. I will say that as soon as the topic of killboards or group skill reputations came up, the conversation immediately turned sour for me. Nothing worse then someone trying to sideline you because there was a chance that lossmail might happen.
---
On a more positive note, I've also had quite the opposite experience with a group that was much more laid back about it. Some people still complained about reputations and stuff (there are always a few), but even after significant or fairly avoidable losses, the worst I had to deal with was some teasing. I grew a lot there and that was the place where I really started having so much fun in eve.
---
In short, its a lot about the attitudes of the people you surround yourself with. Take a look around you, are your friends discouraging you more than your enemies? How often do you find yourself worrying about what everyone else is doing, and why?
---
I am a master baiter.
---
Was officer mods, high skills, and max implants. This is back in 2015ish so it could even be based on some old rules/skills.
---
Only thing I can think of is some convoluted abortion of logic wherein being partners in that highsec keepstar offshore constitutes literal transfer of money from our coffers to theirs for the purpose of funding their SRP.
---
Oh I totally agree, now that I've seen it and lost a ship to it.  I just feels gimmicky.
---
just memed lolz.. but  they hit hard still
---
of course if you are farming with one agent you can do the same exact thing ;)
---
Maybe I'm wrong and then I will have learnt something. But sol far I could not find a relation.
---
I'm aware, I was just meming. All praise the chieftain and 279(e)
---
you forgot another important member of the bluedonut coalition- pandemic horde
---
Panfam not just horde
---
But if it drops a wreck with dank loot in... im game. Let the station bash happen.
---
Something something biomass
---
horde is only member that matters there, no point to mention all their pets \^.\^
---
I mean, I guess I'm mostly talking about low class ratters in Praxi, since that's what I use and most of what I've killed. But when you're hunting a rattle or leshak, then you just bring a suicide cloaky frigate to get scram until the sabre can arrive. Either way, mjd only saves you if you are lucky, you can't rely on it.
---
What some people call min-maxing, I just call playing the game as it is designed.
---
I wasn't saying otherwise. I was pointing out when ccp tried to put skins in a lp store the community greatly lashed out against it. I am fairly confident they concluded that single use skins were a failure. Now you did bring up a good point, standing requirements to equip skins. I could also see specific skins, like putting an opposing faction's colors on a ship requiring you to be under -5 standings with the faction.
---
You can't just call your own post funny.
---
Key word is "consistently". You have to get out quite a bit to get the non-stop anomalies.
---
As a hunter and a general nulls economic dweller these changes have made it harder for both and players alike, Which is good because you noobs had it to easy anyway.  Standard learn2play. Also htfu or quit
---
Or just roll
---
I think the specifics are a bit weird (nice shitpost btw), but the concept is Golden. The salient point here is that ***CCP HAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THE GAME***. 
---
Many are enraged by the changes, while others are very happy. CCP needs to stop jerkin' off and implement something that allows local to come back to sovereign null sec space and introduces counterpley between the hunters and the resource gatherers and between the alliances themselves. 
---
Please note, CCP, that the worst thing you could do here is simply nerf hunters to bring them in line with blacked-out nullsec. The change needs to be much more nuanced than that, because as we're all seeing, the bull in a China shop approach ain't workin' all that great.
---
If they can pull it off in a way that creates conflict between alliances, such as the need to fight over resources to power local-granting structures, they can kill a few birds with one stone.
---
Nice shitpost btw.
---
&gt; **Dont forget the basics...**
---
Like print screen or the snipping tool?
---
That's great, Karen. I could tell you now that I have played the game for 16 years and have similar professional experience. What does that have to do with anything though? We are still in no position to make demands about how the CSM and devs spend their time.
---
BIG TRUE
---
WOW you mean the game is dying because players play the game?!
---
WOW
---
The portrait pack was better than what replaced it.
---
Though standings in local are an interesting example of a gameplay change which closed the gap between the alliances. It gave a capability previously only available to one group to everyone.
---
Your corp can drop a 500m raitaru and plan a jf blob

You couldn't get your shit back for 500m for the entire corp in the past

Wait..

It's been changed now says 11
---
Big if true
---
I would not call it gimmick, it’s a leshak spawn on steroids that you can choose to not run. Wait till you get the same room but spawn at 0 on the leshak and the gate is 80km away.
---
Can't insurance fraud it?
---
But the rest seems like that is the intent. Make capitals team assets.
---
LMFAO, WH does not, i say again. WH DOES NOT make more isk than null. I honestly cannot believe you even said this. WH don’t make anywhere close to what null pulls in. WH make more isk/hr than null yes. But over time example isk/week or isk/month, null is substantially higher than WH.
---
Even when you factor in isk/hr. The time it takes to prep your hole to make it safe to rat puts you below what null makes.
---
Lets say this, you live in a C6 and you dont care about safety. You have your haw and anti cap dread alts logged in and you have plenty of sites to run capital esculations. This is the only time where you will out rat null. Once those sites are cleared, GG because they take forever to respawn. You should know this if you’re a wormholer. 
---
So either 
---
A) you’re noob
---
B) you don’t know how to efficiently rat in null to make the best isk/hr
---
C) you listen to people who feed you BS on how lucrative WH are
---
D) never lived in null or WH
---
Fortunately for me. I lived years in WH before the drifters changes and after. Ratted for years in C4, C5, C6, wolf wh, cap esculations, etc. I also lived in null for years ratting with VNI alts, super and rorq alts, smart bombing BS, moon mining, production, etc. 
---
Unfortunate for you, I’m not knowledge for your BS to have any weight in this thread. So no, Null makes the most isk in game.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Mature response, thank you for your contribution
---
You are claiming ccp is listening to the player base but that has never been true for large changes. Even beyond the current situation showing that to be the case, the things that lead to this; namely citadels, fozzie sov, excavators and injectors, the community was widely against and told ccp would be bad for the game. They didn't listen then and dug themselves into a hole and now are making drastic ill thought out changes regardless of the community.
---
Got me
---
I am not going to divulge my sources
---
Oh great, another brilliant idea for CCP to neuter the many vets who are currently taking a break and/or winning Eve. I’m sure this idea will definitely help with player retention. Didn’t want my Titan anyway /s
---
How is it fucking with sov warfare? Of you can drop 100 Titans, you can field recon and blops cynos easily.
---
It doesn't have much of an impact. The few things that use cynos don't dramatically rely on them and aren't even close to a majority of activities.
---
The fact they can do it easily without cyno is exactly the point I made.
---
What do you think the word "RELY" means?

I see that on lowest Olmeca activity the ratio of users going to old reddit increased massively. Hmmmm ?

u/stainguy we need your help
---
Would you mind taking a worse quality picture next time?
---
The phone flash left on in the other shitpost really sells it too.
---
can't compute .... error
---
ikr bros just being bros
---
not blues btw
---
This is so true, although sadly all the nullsec randoms have drank the kool aid and aren't allowed to think or they will have to do double pap links for the month and will get fined by a director
---
[insert comment about how K162s don't "spawn"]
---
They are just the ass end of a wormhole connection that spawned somewhere else and was subsequently warped to or jumped through
---
nitpicky wormholer, btw
---
I'd be more surprised if you did post a picture of the ass you pulled it from.
---
My prediction: More bitching
---
HATE THEM FOR PLAYING GAME DESIGNED BY POOR CHOICES BY CCP.
---
sounds legit
---
the issue was not the skin. the issue is that, up to now (can't wait for the prices to grow and the LP store to become worth…)  you had to PAY more  AND add LP to get items you could have for less ISK in the jitamarket.
---
Goons and friends have been slowly killing the game ever since the day the first of them started playing eve. Eve was a still a troubled place before them [BOB] but goons have taken it up a notch.
---
I have no illusions about being bitter towards them.
---
Per the most recent mer all wormhole space made 80% of what all nullsec made. See you going to imply there are even close to 80% of the amount of players nullsec has in wormhole space? Or are these players making more isk than nullsec?
---
I pve too... and you don't seem to grasp you have tools at your disposal to protect yourself. Why would anyone leave if they just took the time to figure that out. Oh, I know.. because they don't want to. Multi-boxing and being semi-afk while making billions was the reason they played. No that there's risk, they don't want to make the effort. Bots took the hint and some moved to high sec. Some players did too. That's called adapting. If you left, well... you're not adapting, you're quitting. Once you realize they aren't worth a squirt of piss, you can move on and be happy.
---
You’re literally talking about how you’re a proud highsec ganker, and then you say this?
---
I think inflation has pretty much been taken care of with blackout+VNI nerf.
---
Ya I am sure all those players dying for you to have fun are also having fun. PVP players never seem to consider the other side of the game and think they are the only group that needs to have fun.
---
You understand what corp I am in correct? Learn your EVE history....we still have many characters in the executive level of goons

---
if the game is so bad what are you doing here?
---
I did two years in worm hole space nearly lost my mind there. then went to HS for a few months and tried out null which had been rather fun until recently. I could go back to worm holes but it’s just feels like  work all the time for everything and I play to have fun not work.
---
i didnt say that anyplace, did I?
---
also i was lifetime wormholer so :)
---
They just have to remove the "Fedex" part of asset safety.
---
Either you establish a new beachhead in the system and recover it there, or you wait.
---
The laws of physics don't apply to me. I'm space famous.
---
As it is our solemn duty to keep this game alive all these years, so it is our sacred charge to know when to put it out of its misery.
---
Sooooo hardcore!
---
I agree 100%. The current direction CCP is taking is breathing life into the game. It definitely spices things up, of course there's still areas to improve, although the decisions CCP has taken so far are great. 
---
The game is less stagnant, from my experience.
---
But it is definitely your fault when you don't like being in anonymous 10k++ lemming herds and don't have enough people to kill something inside the capital pve meta, and the playstyle that you liked simply got patched into oblivion.
---
Well CCP should have never allowed alliances that exceed logged in average by 10,000-20,000 . That number should have been 500 from day one.
---
So you are full of shit.
---
&gt; GAME DESIGNED BY POOR CHOICES BY CCP
---
idk man, kinda sounds like it
---
&gt;Thanks for putting up such a tough and unexpected response, easily one of my favorite engagements in my time in EVE. 
---
Yeah man. Just a line member but I liked it too. I really love this scale of fights over some objective of consequence (like our rorq or later our dreads). Best fight I've ever had in Eve was over an anchoring fort but otherwise pretty similar.
---
Lots of shit going on yet each player can still contribute in a substantial, fulfilling way. Like how I was the third cyno that brought the battleships in that forced the nightmares off temporarily. And these fights are always great learning experiences and present challenges to overcome.
---
I hope we'll make it harder for you guys next time. The content Cache has been opened.
---
To be fair its in CCPs hands to balance and design the game.
---
The players will always min/max what they get and that lead to what WE have today. Farmville online that is shocked and broken over the fact the *sunlight* that was necessary for their farms to grow got taken away. Players who didnt liked the changes introduced with citadels, rorquals and skill injectors were told to adapt. They did or left the game. Today all the farmville krabs are told to adapt or leave. Every player who chooses to leave is missed. pvp and pve focused players alike.
---
In the end its still CCPs fault tho
---
People will make some bs out of game tool to blue each other, these soyboys just can't help themselves.
---
My pleasure 07
---
This is totally accurate.
---
nanana, many choices and their implementation are poor and shortsighted. I love the game, but it seems its beimg aimed towarss certain playstyles as cheap fix imstead of big picture.
---
also goons are like driving force, causin headlines and shit. they only min max what ccp provides
---
Welp that's it, Pack it up bois!

I Fly with Vindi and I have to say for the First day Cyno change, we had a hell a good fight. 
---
shit died, Rorq lived, we all had a laugh. Great fight guys :)
---
That wouldn't stop the formation of coalitions.
---
Its called art baby ... ART
---
\[!!rambling here, TLDR; yes, I think minmaxing is fun-cancer\]
---
I'm absolutely in the same boat as you. Including doing missions for fun, and making tons of screening and even sound recordings (have you heard the song of rogue drones in some anomalies?) 
---
I do love min-maxing certain things that catch my fancies (manufacturing lines, PI, things like that) but when it comes to making ISK any other way I'm probably the worst player ever. Even the "fun" PVE fleets in dessies and frigs literally make me slowly freeze in stupor to the point where I feel like I have an IQ of a bot in a Rorqual. 
---
And sometimes I just go do a cool storyline mission.. or explore the COSMOS constellations, or some part of space I've never been to yet, and that is extremely fun and sometimes rewarding. Min-maxing does affect waht I choose to do, with certain things that I want to do but see no point in doing but not to a dramatic degree. 
---
There's no point in playing if I can't enjoy the game and at least pretend for a while that I'm a capsuleer, not an ISK printing biorobot.
---
I personally dont like having a "if its inconvenient, throw it away" mentality and what you suggest sounds like that for me. And while I know that CCP is very slow on adjusting things, that is currently a full 180 turn while on the freeway driving 180km/h. As I already said I am OK with it that there had to be a change, but that is just a punch in the face, where if you didnt have the time then well now your fucked, have a nice day. 
---
It is totally ok that you and others dont like how nullsec has evolved over the past years but it never was something the nullsec people bribed CCP to do, it was just something were we also adapted. I mean im now around for maybe 2.5 years actively but was ther ever an upcry before that nullsec was too dangerous and ccp should make it safer?
---
Too loose now. Not fun anymore.
---
You saying it and you proving it are two completely different AND important things.
---
LEAK!
---
I dont know who to attribute the quote to, but i think it was a LoL dev, but he/she quite rightly said that:
---
"Left to their own devices, players will always seek to min/max the fun out of a game."
---
Old reddit proportionately is actually slightly lower than average at peak traffic of that year. The yellow bar is mobile web, which was just barely above the average.
---
as the guy that does cap srp this was the last titan we SRP'd https://zkillboard.com/kill/77516766/
---
try harder next time sweetie
---
lol yea it’s CCPs fault the biggest coalitions in game are sucking each others dicks that are lacking ballsacks
---
&gt;  "if its inconvenient, throw it away" mentality
---
Except you already do.
---
You already make choices based on the balance of convenience to benefit.
---
This just shifted the balance in regards to capital proliferation.
---
What did Vile Rat do to deserve this medal? Did he jump on a grenade? Carry out peeps on his back and saved lives? Took out all the attackers?

The Medal of Honor is reserved for valiant acts of heroism in the face of certain danger. I'm not 100% on the acts VR took during the attack but I am highly skeptical that he deserves a MOH.

Ohhhhhhh my god.

If my save everyone some time by providing the following statements to copy and paste at your leisure:

* *All of the posts that are gone now were just bot posts, this is actually a good thing.*

* *It actually affects real Olmeca posts more than bot-posting.*
---
* *All the Olmeca posts just moved to highsec*
---
* *~~Its summer so he's busy doing outside stuff.~~*

* *Its the end of summer so he's busy going back to school/work.*

* *We haven't seen post numbers this low since 2006!*
---
* *This has actually affected reddit-bloc posts in greater proportion to little-guy posting.*
---
* *iTs tHe cHAoS ErA loL*
---
Your posting reaches a dumber new shit tier every day.
---
You don’t exist in a reality based in fact and it is truly astounding.
---
Yeah, I agree completely.  CCP definitely facilitated the problem with buffs to massively parallel PvE over the years.  At the end of the day though, its the players that shape the landscape in eve, and with CCP's blessing, they've shaped the most boring pvp environment imaginable.  Like you, I'm more sad about this than salty at this point, because I really really like the game mechanics and complexity of eve.  I agree that we've likely passed a point of no return with the game's current subscribership and player distribution. I don't think there's sufficient numbers of non-aligned groups to feed the more pvp inclined nullbloc members, and I don't think their leaders will seriously consider breaking up the bloc.
---
Dude even did his research
---
I knew I would loose karma on this comment ahah
---
FC what is a standing fleet?
---
Spin harder
---
also this is semi weekly "why wont goons reset tapi so we can dogpile one side" post
---
The irony is, they blued every Jack and Jill from 4 to 5 regions out, then complain about having no content. You expect CCP to put in mechanics for you, but alliances fail to see they hold all the cards.
---
fuck, he got us, I'm out
---
When is BRAVE going green in Impass, pretty quiet
---
i could try to but you are the master here
---
This is so intensely wrong I don't even know where to start. 
---
Let the record show for the rest of you nerds that sites not scramming is what makes jspace krebici too safe, not the fact that holes can be rolled.
---
No. Texas law.

By the rules of Israd doesn't this mean penif has to make you CEO since you are obviously the worse poster?
---
Click it too, couldn't hurt.
---
Abyssal loot is, by design, is very RNG reliant. And looks like you had bad luck.
---
Although it's not unheard of that doing cruiser T4s will land you in red. I was doing T4s in rather cheap Gila, until I calculated that I was lossing money on it. Filaments, drones, ammo and drugs aren't free, and with bad luck steak lasting for over a week, I simply lost the will to continue doing it.
---
On the other hand I heard that doing Abyssals in frigates, usually beings much more money, and they are possible to multibox, although I cannot confirm it, because I haven't tested it.
---
Correct, both in part to an overabundance of intelligence leading to market saturation of nullsec resources and reluctance on the part of CCP to reward Nullsec players appropriately due to rampant botting and the aforementioned, highly imbalanced intelligence gathering commonplace in most "developed" nullsec.
---
With greater risk *should* come greater reward.
---
Proving Conduits will only appear if enough other people are doing Abyssal sites. The Population of TQ has been down for about 2 months now since the blackout first started, and even more now that the Cyno changes have gone through. At the time of me making this Post it is about 16:20 eve time and there are less than 17,500 accounts logged in. This can be accounted by School Starting back up, poor design choices by the developers related to the Proving Conduits, and a series of bad monthly updates, including forcing all clients onto 64 bit unless they opt out; the last issue causes some Mac users to be unable to login until they revert to 32 bit.
---
Dogpile goons or tapi lol
---
when people buy into there own puppycock
---
No u
---
Most important thing is start small and work your way up. Like you said Eve is famous for its backstabers, so no one is going to give you important jobs right out of the gate. What you can do though is start small with low risk things and work your way up. Offer to salvage behind a ratter. Offer to run ore in an indy ship back to refining citadels for miners. The more you do the more people trust you with bigger and bigger jobs. My corp has plenty of jobs that need to get done so if you would want to help out we can definitely help you. Feel free to send me a DM.
---
is it just me or does those books like photoshopped in
---
Imagine dogpiling on 40k+ or 30k with 15-20k. Yes they should try to dogpile the whole 70k+ with their huge numbers ... literally ... dude wtf?
---
Photoshopped the floor out, actually :)
---
Yes I read it, ccp kindly ommited the wormhole npc data but you can extrapolate it. Find the npc commodity chart, calculate the missing percentage, and then use that to find the total isk wormholes made. Do the same for npc bounties vs total bounty prizes. Then compare these two numbers.
---
Provided methodology so you can't accuse me of manipulating data.
---
60.3% of commodity is wormholes 
---
60.3 of 23.832t is 14.37t
---
81.7% of bounties is nullsec. 
---
81.7 of 21.196t is 17.317t
---
14.3/17.317 is. 82.9%
---
Bonus since i thought of it, not sure if all overseer effects come from null I used all of them.
---
Add an additional 3.33t to nullsec
---
14.3/20.65 =. 7
---
70% of all isk generated in August was generated in wormhole space.
---
Jay we miss you, come back to the darkside. Don't bend the knee!
---
Memes and op heavies for everyone!
---
Harden the fuck up.
---
The axis are not labelled
---
Legend included + 1
---
Wormhole space doesn't have the blob numbers that are in null, doesn't have cyno's to transfer silly amount of supercaps easily, etc.
---
You say null wouldn't harm null, yet here we are in a situation where drastic game changes are happening because players built a big blue donut and removed all the PvP they could from null. Give those same players a chance to make things worse, give them a reward for it, and they absolutely will.
---
No ... he obviously thought of every possible variable and dependency. There is no way you can contribute anything that would improve the quality of the analysis after this reddit post was made. 
---
You must just submit that this is 100% factual and correct because it includes \*DATA\*.
---
When I go pvp, I generate killmails, from my ship because I am bad. But I have fun. So yes some people who are dying have fun
---
&lt;&lt;Can you see any Blues from up here?&gt;&gt;
---
&lt;&lt;What has Blues given us?&gt;&gt;
---
This message brought to you by A World With No Blues
---
Nullsec is the furthest from hardcore pvp you can possibly get
---
You make some good points but also deal in absolutes. I appreciate your response.
---
I feel a reset would be healthy once certain changes are made. The empires would build back up again but if there was a way to encourage a split I’d love to see it implemented. Make people fight for their space, currently people seem to have issue with the citadel timers, spam and some would like to see loot drops. Scarcity of resources has been hinted at by CCP and I’d love to see this implemented. If the playerbase genuinely wants another Chinese server they can continue to blue their neighbours but with the Chinese alliances joining ours there is hope that there will be some wars in the future. 
---
I agree the rewards need to be increased and I hope CCP does this sooner rather then later.
---
The cyno changes bring about an interesting way to make capital fights more interesting. If a capital is caught by a small roaming gang you don’t have to feed a recon to them to save the carrier, you could take a small subcap fleet with plenty of tackle and force them off. If the roaming gang is a large gang then surely intel would have picked up on them enough to argue the capital shouldn’t have been out without support! 
---
Larger fights will require more planning and more skilled pilots to bring in the fleet but I see this as a good thing. 
---
Wormholes are not as some would believe safe havens for making isk. There are ways to improve your chances of survival and maybe this needs to be looked at but it is by no means safe. Wormholers fight for their space and those that don’t lose it. Krab holes are regular targets for eviction but that’s because they can be lucrative to evict. Timers are also much shorter. Nullsec to me was and is the primary problem eve faces as over time it has become safer and safer attracting the majority of eve players who don’t want to fight but instead just want to farm in peace. Supers and titans when introduced were not seen as ever becoming the go to ship for PvP and PvE. Unfortunately changes meant this became the case and although they were supposed to be rare, expensive and force multipliers, now they are everywhere and new players who haven’t learnt the fundamentals are flying them. Null sec coalitions need to teach their members to fight for their space. Take pride in it and leave the safety of their umbrella. 
---
I want people to do what they want in the game but I want the game we used to have as opposed to the game it has become. Increase the risk and offset that with a higher reward
---
the floor looks more real than the books tho
---
CCP: Here, take this sandbox game. Play however you want.  
---
Players: Cool, we will just blue each other and krab all day, then complain to you since it is your game and you should fix it.  
---
CCP: Okay, then I am gonna change a few things to end this stagnation.  
---
Players: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, CCP is oppressing me. I thought this was a sandbox wtf REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
CCP does listen to it's community. It may not implement everything the community asks for because in the end it is their game but they do provide the opportunity for it's community to be heard. That is the point I'm trying to make. 
---
Just because you are not seeing all the changes the community suggests doesn't mean they are not being listened to.  There may be things they can't implement because of limitations and there may be things they don't want to implement and it's a mistake. I'm not saying CCP doesn't make mistakes or get things wrong, but they are one company that stands out as far as it's community goes and a big part of that is because they do engage their community.
---
Imagine hating a group of online people in a video game so hard that you can't even process humor if it helps said group in any way.
---
It's just getting sad now.
---
yes and no. i always shit on bloc players. i couldnt imagine a more boring way to waste my time. but winning is something ppl like and all of these bloc players were definiatly winning past 2 years. ofc you can argue that everyone can set theír own goals etc but that certainly wasnt the core gameplay that was meant to be after changes like skill injectors, rorquals, moon rework etc. The core gameplay was farmville with a maximum of krabbing accounts that all get skill injected and could crab in safety. Revenue for CCP. Being an independed small pvp focused group was definitely pretty hard since than.
---
Nice shitpost
---
Be in TAPI
---
See roaming content fleet enter staging
---
Formup fleet 5 times the numbers of enemy fleet over 30 min
---
Bubble all outgates simultaneously, blob the fuck out of enemy
---
Dock up and pat self on back
---
Complain when no ones comes to staging for fights
---
Be TAPI
---
Your corp? Yes, former member if PL, part of panfam. Now a member of snuffed, a former member of the Imperium. Interesting.
---
They spawn if they have less then 15 hours life if you want to nitpick ;)
---
Sorry, your specific preference is not more important than the health of the game.
---
You should try out minecraft though it seems right up your alley.
---
So what your saying is that I don't like being in blobs... thinking
---
So is it the activity you miss, or the ISK?
---
I think inflations wasnt worth mentioning.  [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d\_economy.indices.short.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d_economy.indices.short.png) 
---
And I think people are still misusing those terms and completely forgetting that inflation is a good thing (to a certain extent which we were very much withing).
---
How does a subcap defend itself when most nullsec gankers have cloaks?
---
I disagree. It is definitely funny. Now get back on Discord
---
I am sorry I see that differently. I dont want to throw those things away without having at least a slight benefit, I mean who wants that? I am asking to make it more reasonable to move a ship because right now, if you are in a region without the infrastructure you are just out of commission. I dont have the option to wait for quieter times since I work during the day and should sleep during the night. trying to move something would mean painting a big red cross on my back for snuffed out someone else. Currently the only way I would have is getting back to delve (yay there that dread is as useless as up in pure blind). For me currently its either losing the whole or part the value of the ship just because its in the wrong part of new eden. For me it feels like CCP actively narrowed down my options on how to play the game.
---
Correction: I am the best poster
---
Due to the small strokes of the pen I had to level the white and black to make sure the very detailed and researched graph were visible, it's making the graph theory book look a bit unnatural.  Oh well.

BUT GOONS HAVE 40K CHARACTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Holy shit you are sensitive. Learn to laugh at yourself occasionally and life will be much more enjoyable.
---
Thanks I appreciate it!
---
You talk shit
---
I wish they would add a more active form of mining to increase your mining rates. Like make it only on sub cap mining barges and give them something like the relic/data hacking game. If they are successful they get big boost to that cycles mining output.
---
It's not about hate.
---
Your group is weaponizing humor for its propaganda. It's hurting Eve.
---
Only if the originating side is warped to, as I noted.
---
Originating wormholes do not instantiate their K162 side unless warped to.  Hence the entire "wormholes are too safe" claim because we can roll ourselves in and not interact with the statics and be cut off.
---
Personally I would rather dog pile on TAPI.
---
This isn’t a MOH, it’s a Congressional Gold Medal. The two are completely distinct from one another.
---
Don't the strip miners turn off?
---
Actually a very accurate description of events ...
---
Please, tell me I am wrong. I am *literally* begging you to tell me that I am wrong, because I have been playing this game for 13 years; and I completely understand that my experiences as a video game developer are both a decade old at this point, and I understand you cannot always generalize even in the insular video game industry. 
---
What I will say, and will argue with you about until my dying breath is two things: 
---
1. Your (not you, *per se,* rather CCP's) deference to r/eve as an EVE community above all others is palpable. Don't take my word for it, go to the official EVE-O forums and actually read what people are saying;
---
2. You know, or should know, I am 100% correct about the connection between social networks and retention--this is the *very* reason CCP changed the war mechanics recently, and whether or not you, or CCP generally, is aware of it or not, I can ***see*** my in-game social network get smaller and weaker almost week by week. That is absolutely ***not*** a place I think anyone who cares about this IP wants the game to be in. The stagnation Hilmar keeps talking to the press about was infinitely preferable. Believe it or not, we would have waited for you guys to really think out changes design wise, and test them;
---
   1. I once worked for SOE, and I saw what the affects of thrusting massive game changes without proper testing and focus grouping can do to a game, and here is the thing... ***at least*** SOE had an excuse, because the SWG NGE was forced on them by Lucas Arts under threat of license revocation. I am *really* struggling with seeing any justification for the way you've gone about the last 3 months as an MMO publisher outside of the causes I listed earlier.
---
Except I just listed tons of situations where ccp made the game worse because they didn't listen to the community. They pretend to list to the community by making tiny changes but ccp has never listened when the player base explains why these changes are bad. Give me one example of a large change where ccp listened to the community?
---
\#1 reddit leaqer leading the snuff reddit crew
---
so i take it you're salty AF?
---
before you ask am i salty AF? yes i am.  I'm salty due to the fact that it isn't balanced or fair was it before the black out no. 
---
Do i think the blackout should stay yes do i think gettting free intel is right no.  I'd like to see eve go active intel only. this means chaos to the hunters and less safety for cloaked ships.
---
cyno changes IMO a bit over the top don't want a cyno on a rorqual or any capital remove it from them also remove it from rookie ships, cyno where OP AF
---
&gt;everyone leaving, the game didnt need, they never put into the game content wise, they mostly were the problem, let them laeve, flush them out. 
---
sure they added to the game might not be away you liked but they added to the game, remember these pilots that have left where income for ccp.
---
&gt;im sorry, but the 20,000 rorqual players who never undock unless its a CTA or mining. or 'i dont like sub caps im better at capitals' pilots (make me sick) im ABSOLUTLY happy to see go 
---
so cos in a sandbox they didn't play how you like to, it makes you sick, IMO you're one of the issues with the game.
---
Well you won't lose the whole value of the ship. Insurance is good
---
A++ Quality Researched.  100% more accurate them Olmeca.

But hes continuously pressuring his own cap by using it like you would 3200's. He should have been injecting every time he went down to like under 30% to keep it at around 35-40% which is close to peak recharge

sober jay follows mitannis protocol , drunk jay tells the truth.
---
&gt;Are you really that upset? Because it seems you just don't want to adapt to obvious changes we needed.
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one who gets this feeling from OP. Adapt or leave the game already.
---
But I have to login to downvote...
---
Hmmm, I see what you did there CCP.
---
Not since the insurance changes on capitals
---
Im sure I would be stoned to death if I made a really funny post on how blackout is killing nullsec and how it's good that nullsec is getting fucked.
---
Way to cherry pick the data, he was deployed in iceland in September, we all know that. I'll call that **half-truth**.
---
I thought CCP nerfed cynos so people can't drop trues that big anymore!
---
VINDI is here, replacing old talent :D  
---
Come join us  
---
TBH, The big blue donut is very concerning. It is causing many content issues. However, at this moment it is needed. Else the bigger powerblock simply push what ever they want and turn the entire map into what Serenity is.  
---
Many join WC, Not because of winning, but because we're trying to keep the game alive. It's hard to have fun while PvPing when you can't shoot 1/2 of eve.

 Being in Legacy, then switching to Winterco. The mentality of the coalitions are like night and day.  I personally would love to see many of these block unblue others during this chaos era and see the SOV map light up with more groups, creating new coaltions and actually utilizing the space without asking papa leader of big blue donut for permission to use the bathroom.  
---
There are alliances that hold sov that don't even know how to form a doctrine or even how to FC. But they are given the "Meat shield" position for legacy. Notice who holds the front for WC? FRT, their exec. A lot of respect in my eyes to WC for handling that front and not making a Meat shield of baddies.  
---
But that's a pipe dream. Until then, we keep fighting legacy, which has indeed been fun. But TBH, Fighting while not being forced into a war that no one wants was more fun IMO.   
---
And I agree with you, many of my friends have left eve due to the stagnant pvp the blocks have created. But we gotta fight the fight my man. Put more work into finding and creating this amazing content. That's what will keep this game alive.
---
Cry more. We want all of your tears, null bear.
---
The fact that a single man put the whole nullsec on their knees, is a fact that he is doing it right.
---
Keep crying, spoiled child. Your ticks will be danked to the death, you wont safely rat again.
---
History showed us all many times that people that will swim against the current, are the people that makes things happen. The others, are just the obstacles.
---
I bet that you are goon.
---
Great, people will just blue each other without the official "Alliance" tag ... kind of like they do now.
---
&gt; duty to ~~keep this game alive~~ exploit all bad game design we can find to the fullest trying to break the game for all others all these years,

I posted the same thing about a week ago,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/czaatw/significant\_increase\_in\_wormhole\_spawns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/czaatw/significant_increase_in_wormhole_spawns/)   
---
Wormhole spawns are way up
---
I mean the guy got elected based on being reddit famous more or less. The very reason this sub is actually enjoying this post is because more are realising he doesnt really know what hes talking about.
---
I would like to thank CCP for blackout.
---
Surely y'all can come up with better Koolaid than this.
---
Well played!
---
You're making absolutely good points, reasonable thoughts, and I totally agree with you because it's exactly what I think, and why I'm logging just to change skills, start research jobs, join some fleet and almost nothing else, and I'll continue until my subscriptions will end, after that I think I'll move to the next lowsec station and wait as alpha doing nothing...
---
Your only mistake was to think to have a reasonable and adult discussion here on Reddit, where people will only reply that you're a pussy and should go to lowsec or wh, that you should adapt or die and all those nonsense...
---
There's a simple concept that all those people don't understand, and it's the core of nullsec way of life.  
---
It's being part of a community that give you the opportunity to try the real sandbox, to do everything.
---
I don't care to make billions per hour in a dread in WH, or to farm level 5 like a machine or make billions a day through trading in Jita.  
---
I don't have to plex my subs, it's perfectly ok for me to pay subs via credit card.
---
What I really want is the freedom to do everything, to do a fleet for fun, after that rat a bit in my ishtars and salvage everything, after that make a 10/10 in my rattlesnake, after that bring something to Jita to sell, and then a bit or rorqual mining just to build a couple of BS for my doctrines or to try something else, and another fleet, maybe a boring bashing fleet (but perfectly fine for protect our systems), and then research my bpos and create some capital kits to sell, and then some exploration or everything else my two accounts give me the opportunity to do.
---
I don't care about elite pvp, alliance pvp for me is totally enough to satisfy my pvp desire, I don't care to learn fighting 1vs1 because simply it's not fun from my perspective.
---
What I really enjoy is to set personal objectives, long term objectives and planning, do everything I can with my toons to reach those objectives, and nullsec always been the best place to do this kind of things, it's the realm of players, period.
---
Reddit shitpost narrative consider every null player as someone who moved there only looking for the perfect safety to rat in super or botting.  
---
There are those people for sure, but the vast majority of null players are people like you and me, people that choosed null (maybe 10 years ago) and we are angry and extremely disappointed by CCP decisions, because after the blackout Eve is not gonna die... Eve is already dead.
---
&gt; What about citadel proliferation ? What about the sov system?
---
I think this gets at what one of the serious problems is that causes the coalition turtling and supercap proliferation: the lack of motivation to smash supercap fleets into each other and destroy them. I'd add to it the near perfect distribution of resources. There's very little motivation for an empire to oust another empire from its space because all regions have more or less the same resource distribution. With the exception of the TEST/Winter Co. war currently, it just doesn't really happen much anymore. And that war has been going on for how long?
---
The great wars of the past were mostly fought because there were imbalances in things like moons and true sec. Groups would take on empires at great risk because they wanted their shit. Now with upgradable anom farming, it (mostly) doesn't really matter which region of space you have, so you just hunker down where you are. On top of that, citadels are such a slog to take down it's not worth the effort for roughly the same quality space.
---
The changes we see now make it easier for small groups to harass large ones, so people can more easily take out small gangs and gank and sometimes get good fights. That's cool I guess for some, but it's not really the game I want to play. I do love a good gank or small gang fight, but I've playing this game for 10 years because I'm drawn to the empire-scale wars. I don't feel the need to pad my killboard anymore. The most fun I've had in this game were the long campaigns to evict alliances. I want to have a strategic objective that involves destroying an empire. This is basically impossible, pointless, or in at best just an unfathomably huge and boring effort these days.
---
I was stoked when the blackout happened, but after some time I think long term the blackout and the cyno changes will further hurt the incentive for empires to fight. The cyno changes make it much harder for the necessary fights to happen. The blackout encourages empires to pull in and coalesce more and become even more defensive. They certainly don't encourage the empires to break each other up.
---
I generally think citadels are better than POSes, but I think taking down a stronted POS was way better than even and astrahus. I also think it helped that POSes were naturally restricted to the number of moons in the system.
---
I generally think active moon mining is better than passive moon mining, but what made there should be a "less fair" distribution of the good moons across regions.
---
TL;DR: IMO these changes are attempted band-aids that don't address the problem that has existed long before them: the relative uniformity of resource distribution and the pure hell that is blowing up citadels.
---

---
Well played sir.  Here is my upboat
---
Make it funny and you'd at least get an upvote from me. 
---
...and let's be honest here, there is at least as many "grrr nulsec" people on this sub as not. I'm guessing at least a 50/50 split of idiots hating everyone who doesnt play their way.
---
I take the point that they just exploited bad game design, but then you should not wonder that everybody outside your organization sees you as the guys trying to deliberately ruin the game for all others ...
---
You understand what source means, correct?
---
How to get yourself filtered as an outlier in 3...2...
---
Ye everyone is blue to Horde as well it seems.
---
Do they not have internet in Iceland?!
---
So much this.  The "You're telling me I'm playing my sandbox game wrong" defense is a testament to just how clueless most members of these nullblocs are when it comes to the root cause of content deficit in the game.
---
\#1 change of blackout is that I upvote Joecuster 100% more often. CCplease fix.
---
This post make great truth strength good.
---
ive never been goon. But as you pointed, shouldnt CCP fix bad game design, imstead of these attempts? delve seems to be doin well still
---
Yeah, I only run T5s in a double A-type invuln fit with a cap battery, which is enough to tank that stuff long enough to clear neuts/clear webs/gtfo
---
As a redditor with goon flair, we apologize that the quality of our koolaid is not commensurate with the spod-infused concoction to which you must be accustomed.
---
Erm ... yes, Imperium has? What you are trying to say else that your forehead has hit CAPS LOCK ?
---
That poor soul... beeboo :(
---
Can you atleast say which titans youre talking about? Or it that OPSEC?
---
1. You cannot make people shoot people they do not want to shoot.
---
2. Your suggestion would have zero effect beyond increasing the number of Standings that Space Management has to maintain.
---
There are workarounds to systemic change as long as you have ways to identify whomever it is you are about to shoot (or not shoot, as the case may be), you can only make it inconvenient as hell to check up on every unknown.
---
For any change to have teeth, it would have to start with significant changes to the Standings system.
---
There is a direct correlation between how much interest I have in EVE and how often Cymek posts propaganda art. I even took a break from EVE when he lest TEST (Vale Police was my fav propaganda art ever). 
---
CCP - this is a HUGE deal and gamebreaking. Put Cymek on payroll to help keep sub numbers up!
---
Frigs are hard mode
---
Reeeeeesearch (found 5 000 789 results on r/eve in 0.08 seconds.)
---
This is the one clear solution presented to us by CCP friends.
---
Don't make yourself suffer, pull out the plastic and enjoy your time on this earth!!!!
---
What is there to even propagandize? Can't make good propaganda if nothing's ever happening!
---
I saw these today. What's it for? PVP? No thanks, I'm in a rather expensive Gila I'd like to keep.
---
Yeah same. I have just as much fun getting exploded as I do causing explosions.
---
Wut?
---
You amount "do as I suggest and ask" to listening, that's where we disagree. You seem to think that any change CCP has made over the years has been done without consideration from the community, feedback, ideas, suggestions, CSM etc... again, I disagree with you.
---
Your examples are random, what does that nyx kill have to do with anything?
---
Also where is anyone crying about having to go far?
---
And test is required to kill all keepstars for your entertainment?
---
The rest is made up shit you can't even prove.
---
Thats what I thougt today when multiple post of me went 10 points down in a few seconds after 1 single goon posting. To say that this sub is dominated by other vote brigades than goons and test is like saying that water is dry.
---
With his talent he could make even the most boring wars interesting. Like the Legacy-Winter war for example.
---
If anything, its the playerbase that will kill eve. It happened on serenity and it will happen on TQ too.
---
I upvoted this post for visibility so that I could watch OP be as retarded as possible for as long as possible.
---
First CCP gave us nullbear tears, now they give us highsec ganker tears. God bless 2019
---
The blame game has begun.
---
What's funny is at the end of the day, it's not horde running that clown show.
---
Possible to multibox and possible to solo dependongnon the tier.
---
100% agree. Eve is headed in the right direction and those who are refusing to accept it are simply prolonging their death. I never cared what anyone did in this game, that's the beauty of it. I've played 16 years and time after time CCP balances it out, and not always in my best interest. However, I realize I'm not the only one playing this game, I can't argue for every aspect of this game, but I can argue for a fair risk vs reward scheme.
---
Not every change will satisfy this community. Just look at the original cyno changes. People wanted cheap cynos for "cyno vigils". In their haste and disgust of the new cynos, CCP took away covert recon cynos for a cheaper version and made indy cynos. We lost covery cynos for JFs... over what cyno vigils? 
---
Those crying the loudest are often not the majority opinion. Eve is transitioning, leaving behind better and more dedicated players willing to seek out risk for greater rewards. That's what this game was built on.
---
Now if we can just do something about the blue wave... players arguing we lack player content should have a talk with their alliance leadership.
---
They deployed widely opposed of changes that made the game worse and have led to the situation we are in, I am not going to celebrate them adding a way to do memorial cynos as they ignore everything else.
---
Pretty much this.
---
You forgot to add threatening CCP with loss of subs revenue.
---
u/StainGuy we need you to do the only thing you're good at here: pinging Falcon. This is an urgent matter!
---
We all have the same stats. It's just what parts of the data that gets used and how it gets represented that changes the conclusions.
---
Fuck you got me.
---
No, no  I don't.
---
You are not alone Olmeca.
---
There are many with you, that why you were elected.
---
Keep those nullbears dunked.
---
I know that delve dont even worth a dreadbomb anymore, i hope they live with that now.
---
How much is a delve minute now? 
---
lol
---
I was playing Eve for more than a year and I'm still a noob, I still have to learn a ton of skills just to be able to drive a new innovative fitting, and I still suck at PvP tactics .-.
---
Toke like a couple seconds tho
---
Great, you are basing your comments of risk vs reward today against an era which doesnt even come close to existing now. What a shocker.
---
The only thing that bothers me about this statement is there have been a number of nerfs to nullsec in the last 3 years and that the CSM literally told Fozzie removing the Rorq from the POS was the worst thing CCP could do. Players were given the mechanics by CCP, even though anoms were nerfed not too long ago and Rorqs were nerfed, too. CCP should have listened then, when the CSM told them Fozzie was on drugs, but they didn't. They doubled down, the citadel spam got worst and Fozzie sov is still cancerous. Breaking things and chasing nullsec krabs away fixes nothing. Send the Rorqs to boost only again, not mine. Reduce citadel spam by making every unfueled structure killable (on first RF) in xxx days. CCP doesn't want to out the work in to fix the game and reverse 3 years of bad decisions, so they're now just going to make it so inconvenient that people are saying, 'fuck it' and not logging in.
---
Nope, confirmed red light atm until leadership comes up with a solution how to reestablish the security for at least semi-afk-PvE. If it goes green again, it will be only in 1DQ range all other systems prohibited or you will even get bluedropped for violating the rule
---
Hold up.  I lost a Gila to a wild T5 room like this where the Bio cache and the dozen or two Leshaks were 95km+ away from me at spawn and far from the gate.  The cache is usually between the spawn and the gate, and never that distance.  Is this the one?  The gate is UNLOCKED from the start??
---
I thought it was a total fluke.  I'd been running T5s consistently until then and gave up after that because I thought they suddenly increased the difficulty level wildly.
---
Imagine that whole group of 12k+ active members, crying desperately against a single guy?
---
Such a bunch of stupid baddies and nullbears.
---
Worthless.
---
r/eve was born in the shitter
---
T4s are shit, run T5
---
HAHAHAHA this dude is fucking dumb.  
---
Players playing the game = players killing the game!!  
---
CCP know their game and don't make bad decisions.  
---
Another Ex-PL butt-hurt person that went grr goons hat goons on reddit.
---
I don't think we are even important enough to be called pets
---
&gt; Personally I would rather dog pile on TAPI.
---
Did we dunk a bunch of your out-of-alliance Rorquals or something? Your jimmies seem incredibly rustled by our existence.
---
I think a similar room in a T3 might be what killed my gila a while back...
---
&gt; Example 3: It's old but TAPI letting Wrecking Crew Keepstar live

An example of SNUFF killing Eve.

CSM, lol
---
I can't express how much I appreciate this humor :'-)
---
Don't worry, I'm sure he believes in Bigfoot and Santa too.
---
I'm weird in that I enjoy min/maxing...when I choose to. I have a spreadsheet for abyssal mag stabs for my incursion vindi, but then I also dumped 1.5m Concord LP into mindlinks for 1k lp/ea instead of making stuff to sell for 50% more.
---
To some extent, min/maxing can be fun. It's when you try to apply it to everything, and *only* do things that are maximum efficiency that you kill the fun IMO.
---
You can’t use bounties to determine WH income. WH rats don’t have bounties. They drop blue loot which ccp buys back in certain station of known space. The only accurate determination of how much WHers have to come from CCP themselves. That wont be 100% accurate but would be close enough. CCP would have to release how much blue loot they buy back on a monthly bases. 
---
The biggest risk with ratting in WH space is collecting your loot and hauling it back to a known space seeded station without dying. This happens a lot and blue loot is also destroyed in the process. That being said, it’s impossible to calculate unless CCP provides the information.
---
What isn’t impossible to calculate is the low percentage of player base living in WH. The time it takes to roll into a WH with sites and to prep it without rolling yourself out. The higher the WH, the harder it is to scan yourself back to know space. When you factor in these factors, it can take 30 mins to hours (8hrs was my longest setup due to rolling myself out twice in a C5.) I made around 5.5bil and it still took me 6 hours to clear the sites and drifters using 4 accounts (30 mins from start to finish with killing the drifter). 
---
Hell i spent 5 hours rolling a static just to find a WH with enough sites to be worth running (3-4 sites minimum). 
---
Lets talk about me in nullsec. I have 3 SB machs and 1 high dps catcher. I log in all my alts, get them in fleet, undock, ignore everything but rock havens, warp to site and every 20 mins, i make 140mil (total) for as long as i can stand it. Interruptions are not factor in as I didn’t factor them in WH. Thats 420mil a hr repeatedly. I can step this up is i used 2 supers that brought me in (at the time) 180-220mil a tick which is 600mil a hr. You cannot substance that income per hour in a WH even if you have your own C6 fully spawned with zero interruptions.
---
Let me be realistic tho. You are going to play with other players in WH so now you’re splitting your loot. You afk vni in null for 20mil a tick. No matter how you look at it. Null makes significantly more that WH.
---
Now you can say no one is in null and everyone is in WH because of blackout. That doesn’t change the fact that null is still the most lucrative.
---
I am supporting my brother hustlan fighting the blue nugget
---
I'm not a diplo, but I guess you're saying coalitions shouldn't be allowed? Ok, then. Take it up with Dran. I'd personally love to shoot a few Legacy.
---
Yes, too, it falls to us to inform the designers of the faults in their plans, and lo, when our warnings fall on deaf ears, demonstrate the folly of their negligence.
---
I guess DBRB gave up on that diet??
---
&gt; Sadly you haven't, you have tried to hit BBC but you fed

lmao 'weaponized Goon humor is killing Eve'
---
Oh my god, I'm fucking dying here. Sure, why not? We'll add it to the list of things we've apparently managed to weaponize:
---
1. Weaponized Boredom
---
2. Weaponized Autism
---
3. Weaponized Humor
---
I can't wait to see what the lab nerds over in Delve Exothermic Reaction Projections come up with next for us to wield against our foes.
---
I'm personally hoping for Weaponized Merriment, it'd really shake things up. Knowing my luck though, it'd be Weaponized Anime or something else equally appalling.
---
"Ma, tell me I'm elite!"
---
So is the real solution regular 5000-10000 player bloc on bloc battles? I can't figure out what you think is the solution, because for me, I want nothing to do with any kind of large scale 6 hour + battles. Simply not interested. I have a son that needs a father to play an active role in his life. I can't be bothered with anything beyond logging in finding something fun for maybe an hour or so, and then pissing off outta here.
---
They had cloaks before, and when they showed in local you just docked up anyway. Was that a good alternative? Ships need to uncloak to jump, they need to uncloak to launch probes. Catch them on d-scan. Look for probes. Pay attention to intel. Most ships coming are alerted several jumps away. Don't use your 1bil ratting ship if you're going to hang out solo. Get in a standing fleet. Be on team speak. And when a hostile confronts you, fight them. Call for backup. If you lose a ship, say "gf" and carry on. Don't risk what you can't afford to lose. Find a cloaky ship and do the same... I'll be the first to tell you, it's not an easy thing to do. Stealth bombers are very squishy. T3 cruisers have skill loss.
---
Maybe argue about a cloaking change, instead of the blackout? 
---
All better alternatives than just quitting.
---
PSA: Abyss is to drain isk from players
---
I mean, sites scrambling would make things more dangerous, although it would have to be like a HIC point so that you can’t just refit to WCS. 
---
But really, what makes it so safe is the lack of cynos. The other factors help, but if you removed any of them people would adapt. You can’t adapt to a cyno bringing in 50 Lokis at a moment’s notice
---
and when a good chunk of the player base leaves and we have no krabs to shoot because people were telling them they were the problem what are we going to do huh? personally i like it when i ratter loses his shit because i killed them, not because their game play was destroyed by CCP.
---
well, guess we will see how it pans out. Overall solution to nullsec wpuld benefit game but that is a no go so. Ill be in my wormhole:)
---
Can I offer you an egg in this troubled time?
---
People will just login to move their shit and log off again.
---
People are actually wrong in saying CCP doesn’t listen to people.   The issue is they listened to the wrong people — carebears &amp; nullbears.  
---
Now their meagre attempts at reversing the road to nerfdom they pursued for the last five years is too little, too late.
---
They describe a measure of relative post quality that, in semi-common circumstances, may allow for a single post to count for more than one shitpost, despite only being one post physically.
---
Thats why this isnt a chaos era. Its just more of the same boring shit.
---
They're unsubbing because CCP made nullsec tantamount to shooting fish in a rain barrel for F1 Stuku fleets, didn't fix anything people have complained about for three years, i.e., citadel spam (which can be solved easily in one quick patch), and mind-numbing Fozzie sov still being a thing. Rorqs also should have never left the POS., but hey, the CSM told Fozzie that, and they ignored that, too. When trust is broken, people leave games. They usually also don't come back.
---
🤣
---
I get it...that’s hilarious...
---
You are entitled to your own opinions, as am I. if seeing a change in-game you don't agree with equates to CCP not listening than so be it.
---
down vote away ...
---
So basically you have no idea about ratting and see just lying. A standing fleet won't help when you will die before any ship can show up to help. A ship fit for pve will not survive against a ship designed for pvp. T3 cruisers don't have skill loss. Like your entire post has no basis in reality.
---
(unzips pants) Alright, link me your ganked lossmail.
---
And his arch nemesis, the Mustard Monster
---
Amazing show
---
&gt;Also, minnie ships should get passive hull regen
---
Bit ironic, given that they also have the lowest hull HP of any faction
---
I agree with you that the current form of blackout is a panicked reaction to the outcome of 2016/17, all the "nerfs" in the years past that were just minor tweaks to OP stuff (fighter application etc) that did not really help. As I see it CCP panicked after they saw the implications of Lifeblood to Login Count and ingame economy (thus the demise of the resp. LeadDev Seagull) and then started to patch headless. 2016/17 patches drove away many many old players, that CCP has completely lost, as with avg. 40 years and up  most people wont come back even if EVE would evolve backwards.
---
And the people that started and grew with that meta and don't know the risky, hard EVE of former days now feel fooled too. Thats the risk atm, CCP has no plan that includes both parties.
---
&gt;  Still, do not get why the only class of ships to have it is a half bill high SP cruiser.
---
To kill caps and nullsec. They don't want to do the work to fix 3 years of mistakes.
---
Maybe you dumbasses made a bad investment. You the players had two years of total prosperity why are you angry?. Because you invested in the most insanely lavish items ever so now they are useless because you chose to flex them to often? Haha look at our 250 man titan fleet got old about 250 posts ago. So where is yhe game logically gonna end up?. I mean cuck 12b for a nyx? Thats with inflation. Smh
---
&gt; Tell everyone you're here to ruin ~~the~~ your game, *not the game.*
---
I'd be fine with that too, it achieves the same objective. The only problem is with 2 timers it gets complicated.
---
lmfao...fuck
---
Legacy and Imperium are the same coalition.
---
Just adapt?
---
 Nice try ... But ... no
---
Read between the lines, you have all the tools.
---
I thought about this, but there are some wise people that are not that toxic. And I felt like I had to share my point of view as well.
---
That's a very good assessment. Thanks for taking the time to write it.
---
\^snowflakes gunna be snowflakes.
---
Not really I had a 2.5 bil Gila fit which netted me in the neighborhood of 12 bil in around 2 weeks of running them. I haven't ran one since because they are to me only slightly less shit than ratting. Safety of it be damned, I couldn't care less.
---
Fantastic remark!
---
Its hypocritical as fuck when they all applauded the changes which killed nomadism (moon mining, jump fatigue) and the changes which empowered them to play that way in the first place (Rorqs, Citadels).
---
You got me there.
---
Ye. 
---
I dont know of that specific fight so cant talk much about it. Like I said its situational.
---
Well, if any of his post was required to be true, he couldn't exactly write anything.
---
&gt; Without industrialists this game would be nothing.
---
Here is an idea to all miners and industrialists in eve how to fight against pvp'ers:
---
Stop mining and building ships so pvp'ers cant get ships anymore.
---
Out of curiosity - how would you rate the results if we were 10 months into blackout and they would show the same?
---
&gt;I mean fuck 12b for a nyx?
---
Try 9-9.5.  Rigged, even, if you're lucky :p
---
Lol. I wish, life would be easier that way.
---
I will give this to you for earlier stuff like the FW-Freighter-Heist. But not for Citadel &amp; Lifeblood, as your lead realized immediately that this would make an organization like Goons ~~nearly~~ untouchable after a period of building up. I did not hear warning from Goons before starting to massively exploit that bad design.
---
Cymek could make the game more interesting for other people... but not for himself.
---
Don't know man, last titan fight between north and goons tapi had even numbers, you might be retarded if you think we are the problem
---
So you had a little bit of time to put towards not being a useless human. That's good.
---
On a more serious note, how is grinding through a 20 year old game without any modern improvements actually fun?
---
In my normal media that covers video games everyone has basically said that wow classic is about as garbage as it always was. It takes way more plugins to make it playable than modern wow.
---
lmao what retard doesn't even know how to print screen
---
newbros*
---
That was a taipan wasn't it
---
Are we talking about EVE Online or Wow Classic?
---
[CCCP] please do not continue on this path

Imagine if you could login and just travel a few jumps for some PvP? Huge bloc battles really don't happen as much since the logistics and time is insane. I'd rather have a push and pull style null sec where my neighbors and I are fighting for space. I agree I can't log massive fleet hours I have my 2nd son due in a month. 
---
CCPs next step is to put in ways to minimize the blue balling of each other. I'm all for random weekly worm holes from null to null space as a possibility.
---
I don't disagree with this at all. In the long run CCP needs to definetly look at and find new ways of attracting players, but as long as the retention rate is this low that wouldn't do much so i think that is more important for now.
---
I'm pretty sure Innominate has a far better understanding of the game than do you. So when see "rollyeyes" I'm not going to take anything from your post other than further concern for this game.
---
Interesting take on this considering it's the null blocs who have blued eachother and krabbed all day, yet also never asked for cyno changes or the blackout...
---
It has literally been everyone else asking for these changes.
---
WoW Classic, because clearly EVE has actually changed in 20 years, while wow classic hasn't.
---
Which is the entire point of the "classic" label.
---
So, no longer is it weaponized boredom, or weaponized autism, it’s now weaponized humor too...
---
He was elected because him and Marsha both have like 100 omega alts to vote brigade.
---
Well... if we're being honest with ourselves... there is no "wrong" way to play a sandbox game, and the irony is profound as it every one of your complaints is, "those guys are doing these things and I don't like it, CCPlease don't let them do those things anymore."
---
You'll understand my confusion of course:
---
&gt; On a more serious note, how is grinding through a 20 year old game without any modern improvements actually fun?
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
:(
---
 I'm with you in supporting the little guy. It's necessary and timely. Keep it up.
---
But defending yourself this way does the cause no good and makes you look an over eager ass.
---
The OP is clearly a joke so treat it for what it is: just a joke. Never treat it any other way.  And "weaponising humour"? For heaven's sakes lighten the fuck up.
---
Daily reminder:
---
When people are left alone, they tend to choose to work together when its in their best interests.
---
Because it would be completely impossible for Goonswarm Alliance 1 through 80 to exist, and coordinate out-of-game.
---
It's almost like you don't realize there was a time before alliances existed, and why CCP put in the pseudo-corp band-aid implementation decades ago.
---
&gt; Complain when no ones comes to staging for fights
---
Anyone remember the alliance tournament? 
---
gottem
---
Don’t miss the fact that Olmeca thinks this post constitutes “weaponized humor.” It apparently goes well with our weaponized boredom and weaponized autism. What else can we weaponize? Obviously not our space ships...
---
damn now I have to clean my notebook screen, dare you XD

People enjoy different things, this makes me MAD

Mum is this what elite PvP feels like?

haha nice meme
---
maybe the chaos era should change the wormhole space. it's the safest place right now.
---
Yeah, been playing non-stop for the three days it took me to send this reply. It's similar enough to Eve you can figure out quickly wtf is going on, but different enough to be very entertaining. The pvp is actually, emm, better? the Eve (imo anyhow). You have to grit through some obnoxious handholding in the beginning, but afterwards it opens up a lot more.
---
we have brawls several times a week the amamake area. Even in black rise stuff like t1 battleships wouldn't really be that threatened by snuff drops. They're an issue but not in that manner
---
HMMMMMM
---
😘
---
now that's some bad taste
---
I own multiple supers, I still think its dumb that they're good ratting ships when they're designed to be huge war machines. Having said that, they're hard to multibox and imo arent as much a problem as Rorquals.
---
Hasn't abyssal loot also been nerfed a few times?
---
I'll do one just for you Merk.
---
Play the game longer than me.
---
Pretend you know how a group other than yours operates, and make no effort to verify your assumptions.

Make an ass of yourself of Reddit.

Oh please tell me how this current shit show is healthy for the game.

I actually saw a clip yesterday regarding the MER and noticed that CCP does indeed release CPI info  [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d\_economy.indices.short.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d_economy.indices.short.png).
---
People keep talking about hyperinflation and shit but I am not seeing anything out of the ordinary outside of the Lifeblood patch. And its certainly not correlated with faucets cause we would have been seeing a much higher inflation if that was the case.
---
The only "strange" thing is that prices are dropping atm but thats because of firesales, i.e., higher short term over supply cause people are leaving. The economy was doing quite fine frankly and was definitely stabile however I would have still gone for faucets simply because of balance and minerals because of cap prolifiration.
---
Not in highsec you cannot. Moons are required.
---
PL preying on smaller alliances that couldn't defend themselves was the biggest recruiting tool that Legacy has ever had. 
---
Almost all of our original members were alliances PL had evicted or farmed mercilessly, so they banded together for mutual protection and formed our coalition. What really did it was their failed takeover of Provi and failed invasion of the south, after which we became one of the big powerhouses. 
---
If someone had just explained the concept of sustainable farming to them (a la the current war in the south) the meta would look very different today.
---
First time I've laughed on this subreddit in too long.

For real though winning timers with 0 interaction, in both sov and structures, is cancerous.

One of the things ccp and I think many players) dont get is how null sec is the engine that drives eve.
---
All the other sections of space react to events, actions and harvesting in null, for the most part more than those parts of eve affect null.  
---
Kind of dumb to nerf the center of the game like that.
---
Imagine thinking krabs want you in their backyard.
---
It's human nature. It's what humans do. CCP forgot.
---
&gt; What we didn't get into is "the vagabond needs 5% power grid buff
---
WTF you asshole
---
Really? Did they change the skill loss? News to me. Also if you are ratting with others a standing fleet clearly helps. I just ratted for an hour with no problems. It was risky by myself but I accepted the risk and the fact I could lose my ship. Did I not login because of that? No. 
---
You could also just do combat sigs. They can't find you unless they scan down the sig and by then you'll see their probes. Then there's always lvl 4 missions in high sec if null isn't for you. Plenty options pal. Pick one.
---
SKILL INJECTORS SKILL INJECTORS FUCKING SKILL INJECTORS.
---
sorry about the capslock but i can't stress enough that skill injectors play a huge part.
---
&gt; Burn these empires to the ground and something new and exciting will come out of it. 
---
Nothing will come out of it, CCP just want their Pearl Abyss bonuses.
---
[I think with a very simple google search you can find otherwise.](https://www.google.com/search?q=otherwise&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS713US713&amp;oq=otherwise&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.1160j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)
---
And Yet, there are more people playing Classic wow then Eve.
---
Why would you say its dumb they are good ratting ships? They put out tremendous firepower compared to a battleship. Both of which can kill ships and rats.
---
I think they function perfectly the way they are.
---
To the multi boxing of super ratting, I'll leave that one to the best starcraft players. I've also tried it and it ended up costing me more in ametat 2's than I could make in isk LOL
---
I don't disagree, and lowsec has also needed love for about 5 years. The sig list auto updating is one of my most hated sources of free intel.
---
You sound like a guy who lost a ratting carrier rather than killed one.
---
reddit salt about goons.
---
Functioning within parameters
---
&gt; there are more people playing Classic wow ***on one server*** than Eve.
---
ftfy
---
They need to change/adjust/revamp sov null content drivers entirely. Fighting war in null is incredibly tedious (Foz Sov and Citadels) Takes forever (Week long citadel timers) largely pointless (asset safety and citadels).  
---
If you set all of your citadels for the exact same time across your region (most of sov null) the amount of time it would take to grind all of the citadels in that region for an attacker is obscene. This also assumes the citadels are undefended. Citadels take 2 seperate days of ivestment to even get the final, long, timer.  
---
Sov is unplesant as well. Sov wanding is either undefended or drags into a 2-6 hour game of wack-a-mole. It didn't lead to multiple skirmishes, it made, what was already uplesant to do, into something worse. Not to mention for line members you have really nothing to show for it. At least killing SBU's or IHBUS gave you a kill mail.  
---
While I'm on this rant, using the hacking mechanic to find out shitadel timers is so stupid. Getting within 5k of a citadel that has PDS is so dumb.  
---
TL;DR: All aspects of sov null are terrible and I agree with you wholeheartedly
---
Just curious.
---
There is a reason these people moved on from that version of WoW.
---
There is a reason they didn't just play on realms that never left that version.
---
The game has been made better since then, so going back to the vanilla state and being excited about geting rid of every improvement seems wild.
---
Still no asset safety in wh space so that's debatable. We also don't get null sec moon goo ore and we can't use JFs so it's not as rewarding for industrialist (or at least the reward is harder to squeeze out of it). 
---
 I like wh space as it is, we don't feel "safe" in there ever but we also don't feel constantly threatened. I expect it to change all the same.
---
*ahem* something with more base and less pitch is all I'm asking for. I mean you could say that aeon was... heavy metal
---
nope, never lost a carrier "Lalu Multipass" is my main if you want to check my killboard. I'm honestly just sad and a little pissed my friends(corpies) are disappearing as they are one of the few reasons i still login. Look i honestly don't care about the changes because they don't affect me a whole lot but if my friends i've been playing with for years leave the game then theres no reason for me to stay, and i would prefer that not happen.
---
The guy is either confusing it with something else or lying out his teeth. 
---
There is no way you can get a corvette with that high dps.
---
A recruitment ground for PH and Waffles more like.
---
Crying desperately against him? For what? He's done nothing of particular note, unless you count being the mascot of 'grr gons' idiots everywhere.
---
If you're talking about all of us that respond to him, I mainly enjoy seeing the mental gymnastics he performs to make reality conform to what he is comfortable with. I suppose there's a small part of me that hopes he'll get the message and break out of his superimposed reality, as the level of creative thinking it requires to maintain that could be put to better use.
---
Blue balling is a tactic used usually when someone brings overwhelming force and batphones to a fight the defender or attacker already won't win.
---
What can CCP do to encourage FCs to pointlessly feed their fleet into guaranteed annihilation?
---
I don't think they can do anything to change that.
---
Uhh Allende was ousted by a CIA backed military coup. The CIA had never been in the habit of installing socialist leaders.
---
I got over 2 tril green my kill board; I’m not sure at what point I’m not a krab 
---
I just don’t need a CCP induced kill feed to be  good player
---
People would have formed coalitions no matter what. PL hasn't been relevant for a while now, but the coalition to protect them from the bully turned bald and 200lbs overweight isn't necessary anymore.
---
If you don't like nullsec and you don't like highsec maybe you could consider lowsec? The safety mechanic of local is still available there.
---
And will die there
---
https://xkcd.com/1205/
---
His art was top tier, damn shame really.
---
Cloaky camping is completely irrelevant with no local.
---
No. This is because there's nothing to do with all your max
---
Lol the ones crying loudest for jump fatigue were lowseccers who were getting helicopter dicked by PL and complaint that PL owned all the lowsec R64's because they could get their caps to a timer in a couple minutes.
---
Wow, your dick must be huge. You should go play another game and tell them about it.
---
&gt; What I really want is the freedom to do everything, to do a fleet for fun, after that rat a bit in my ishtars and salvage everything, after that make a 10/10 in my rattlesnake, after that bring something to Jita to sell, and then a bit or rorqual mining just to build a couple of BS for my doctrines or to try something else, and another fleet, maybe a boring bashing fleet (but perfectly fine for protect our systems), and then research my bpos and create some capital kits to sell, and then some exploration or everything else my two accounts give me the opportunity to do.
---
Well okay, nothing in the recent changes prevents you from doing any of those things.
---
What if alliances had to pick a home system/constellation? And they could only add space connected to their home constellation. The more connected constellations, the better quality of space. Sov was based on full constellations, not per system. 
---
Just an idea.
---
Yesterday I actually found out that CCP does its own CPI (basket) and they include it in the MER.  [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d\_economy.indices.short.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d_economy.indices.short.png)
---
Compare that to the faucets  [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/7qv7bx2vXYthJH9vUH0lli/e0326b545c4e359b6f27257d40c3541d/9aaa\_top.sinks.faucets.over.time.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/7qv7bx2vXYthJH9vUH0lli/e0326b545c4e359b6f27257d40c3541d/9aaa_top.sinks.faucets.over.time.png)
---
You can see the lack of correlation. Some places suggest there being one but its actually not. Its war thats caused this years inflation accompanied by an influx of new player (PIBC from Serenity), its just higher demand and it matter alot cause its HACs online atm which means that T2 mats which are highly restricted during a timeperiod are dying faster than it can be replenished causing uptick in prices across the entire regional T2 product line (would say minmatar T2 ships have gone up the most). There is a bit more to this but too much info.
---
And at the end you see the drop which is correlated to firesales and market oversupply because people are cashing out before taking a long term break and in general lower demand simply because people are on breaks and cant buy things. This is  exacerbated by one war stopping in july and PIBC having already settled.
---
As you can see the numbers will fall for a while until reserves are depleted and might not go up because of lower demand but its hard to tell. Long term Im fairly certain however that prices will skyrocket which means purchasing power (isk value) will drop massively.
---
By no means is the economy healthy. In contrast it was actually quite healthy before. I would still have handled faucets (unrelated to this) simply because its not needed and widens a gap between groups. I would have gone over all the faucets in the game and balanced them to make sure there was a flow. And mineral supply should have been handled years ago but CCP wanted titans online so they let this shit continue.
---
thanks for the info I will take a look at it  o7
---
We don't hide our crab alts in RMT/BOT/hard knocks.
---
&gt; You can take trivial jabs at my data. 
---
Listen, guy - analyzing quantitative data is something I have done, and do, on a daily fucking basis for the better part of a decade. I didn't take "*trivial jabs*" at your data, I took ***YOUR*** data and showed how it was wrong, manipulated, cherry picked, and mis-informing - and I didn't even do that in my normal criticizing way originally. I responded in a manner to open up discussion on how you could better your analysis - instead you ***REEEEE*** bold words on your OP and this shitpost complaining about people "*unfair fake news'ing*" your data when, in fact, your data evaluations is dog shit. Now - when you really want to fuck around with some data let me know, till then keep screeching and running from the slightest bit of rebuttal or rebuke of your grade-school tier science project results.
---
I stepped outside of my normal troll/shitposter mentality to offer an insightful counter of analysis to your dumpster fire of spreadsheet monkey fuckeying, you flailed and kicked like a little bitch, so now don't expect anyone to actually offer any reasonable feedback because we all see how you ***REALLY RESPOND*** to the slightest bit of challenge. 
---
Maybe you could actually not be a fuck-knuckle and learn something for once.
---
So you are fine with CCP listening and then deploying changes that ruin the game? And I am not talking about blackout I am referencing injectors.
---
I just watched legacy vs frt refute that yesterday.
---
\&gt; claims that bubbles are what is dangerous and refitting to an MJD is too slow and also you can't fit an MJD while krabbing because \~\~\~\~\~\~reasons
---
\&gt; thinks you have time refit to stabs and just get out when you're already tackled in a site
---
are you serious?
---
Took me too long to figure it out, lol.
---
Well, then everyone whose not an inflated alliance can then go build their empire. This isn't the end of eve, just of a certain player base.
---
Which isn't good. It sucks that people feel they are being pushed out, neglected. But if your whole issue is that you cant mine or rat completely inoculated to conflict, why are you playing? Eve isnt that game. 
---
Eve is about PVP. PVE supports PVP. Shit, these drastic measures are in place only because groups have created a system where PVE is the main goal. Which is impressive.
---
If every butt hurt PVE mofo unsubs and leaves, yeah it'll hurt. You know who will be left? People who like the game for what it is, those people will still be around. The vacuum forming from this exodus is already creating business opportunities.
---
Which part are you referring to?

Is there a flair bait you don't fall for?

Nope

just use a couple of alts and you can totally solo incursions, you need to setup more around a lack of input ( and likely do armor as it means nestors and free midslots ).

i'd like to take a moment to appreciate the soundtrack of eve online: although it seems to be a nondescript space ambient, i do like listening to it, have a favourite track, often find the compositions playing in my head, and even heard one in a dream. when i have to work, and can only mine ore in the background, the soundtrack keeps me in good spirits.
---
[Use your skills to statistically plot a representation of Wulkan's posting.](https://i.imgur.com/0e9txR0.png)
---
What disproved my post? The Frt/Legacy fight was over an anchoring Fort which only has the one timer. Which is another separate reason citadels suck
---
It's been made different, different is not necessarily better as better in this case is an opinion.
---
It was impossible to stay on realms that had the vanilla version of wow, blizzard did not leave any realms with the vanilla version. Additionally people already were making private realms back then so some people did try to stay on that version.
---
Saying that every change is an improvement would mean that you should have to also say the same of EVE. That means you must think that current EVE is the best version of every system that makes up the game from sov, to balance, to PVE.
---
You can 100% calculate it and I did.
---
Sleeper loot is listed under NPC Commodities which is provided in the MER and I used to give these numbers. Where did you think I got the 14t from if there are no bounties in wspace? Please reread the numbers because these are not opinions I am making up these are literal facts provided by CCP.
---
Also you are saying you don't factor in interruptions but you get interupted much more frequently in nullsec. In wspace you did work to prevent interruptions and counted that time against it, but in nullsec you can't do work to prevent interruptions and have to count them as time in your calculation. Count both sides or don't count them but you cant count for either piece.
---
You can claim whatever you want about numbers you make, but any reasonable person knows there are way less than 70% of nullsec making money in wormhole space. So this means there are a group of people making much higher money in wormhole space than anyone in nullsec.
---
Question : How TAPI and GOONS became such big power house ?
---
Answer : The rest of eve let them krab for years, making fun of every PVE ping Goons were sending back in time, claiming "MER Means nothing" because all the ore mine were going to jita and all the isk rat were going to RMT. I could make a wall with all the bullshit "non-imperium/legacy" leader made over the years to claim "hey we don't suck that hard" at the end of the day, X47 was here to remind everyone "If you let your enemy freely grow and accumulate wealth you will dig your own  grave".
---
Stop blaming goons and TAPI for making their space a PVE haven since "your" leader were making fun of them years ago when they first introduce it, now you are crying it's too much OP and beg CCP to nerf them (while you only nerf yourself heh)
---
Don’t ask me bud, I was simply stating how this game runs.
---
Razor was working on timers, skirmishes went down in 46dp, 77s8, and two others systems im blanking on
---
i wasnt blaming you, merely wondering :)
---
It's like the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons), only instead of over-exploiting limited resources it's [optimizing the fun out of the game](https://www.designer-notes.com/?p=369).
---
P.S. Thank you u/Tsedd for finding that article.
---
Haha sorry for coming off all aggro )
---
no worries, I didnt take it as offense or anything.
---
we'll see.
---
Never heard that term explained that way. I was referring to alliances blueing everyone and you can't bust a nut on them.
---
If you're going to accuse me of being both chauvinistic and presumptuous, u might bother checking both my corp history in addition to how long I've been playing the game.  I was briefly in TAPI (if only it could have been briefer). I've also roamed to TAPI staging on multiple occasions and seen what they do.  Instead of simply calling people names, you might try actually thinking for yourself for once, and offer up some more substantial retorts.
---
Not sure that's really a problem, hot dropping is a bit easy and doesn't really have a counter.
---
CCP has known this for years; however, changing it? Effort™ = too much. Therefore, what we get is cheap changes like the blackout and cyno change, because fuck actually having to think things through and test. Amiright, CCP?
---
Fuck that. Full loot. Also limit structures to one per celestial, with L/XL limited to planets.
---
&gt; You are comparing the peak of isk making levels to current levels
---
fc what is a percentage
---
I dunno if you are going to read this comment but I think its something you guys actually need to know.
---
You can always make changes but if you go full on retard mode which you guys absolutely have with the age of chaos you lose massive goodwill. And when that happens you lose the ability to actually implement wise changes. 
---
The way things are going youre gonna have to revert the changes plus add bonuses to even get people to come back to NS. Which is bad cause then we have to wait a long time again for some changes to be accepted by the community and the first ones that are gonna need to go are the bonuses. Its just such a massive loss in time.
---
Please understand, the path youre taking wont work. Stop it now and you will regain some goodwill, enough for people to actually approve of certain good changes. Show us that you guys are responsible and tried something that obviously didnt work but you tried. Then work on the things were actually asking for. Let us believe in you again.
---
&gt; the month before and the month after the change and well the results are different than what you present
---
Because the Goonperium umbrella was still deploying back home and dealing with drifters in the month before blackout so mining was depressed. That shows exactly why it's better to use a long time period.
---
lowsec solo pvper
---
Thanks for so quickly providing an example of the stupidity to which I was referring. Eve isn't like most sandbox games.  For there to be PvP, there must be non-blue targets (unless your snuff).  taperium blue more and more players / make the game unenjoyable for others, that pool of targets dwindles down to a point where its so boring that even the nullbloc guys start unsubing.  If you think that actions which lead to the death of the server should be avoided because "lol its a sandbox I can do what I want", then please stop crying about a loss of content.
---
Maybe it means something different to others. I never considered it could mean other things. This is how I perceive it being part of a smaller mid sized alliance. I'm curious what else it could refer to, in eve of course....
---
tears, i am here for the tears

And i can guarantee you, null tears are the most sweet ones

If he only had a forum for their 12k+ active members, redirecting people to vote for them.
---
How many CSM are goon minions?
---
Hahahahahaha great find! Very detective.. Much like!
---
If you think bot runners are rational, and were doing the activity that gave them the best isk:time return with their bot, the very fact that they've changed activity - to something which was previously lower isk:time than nullsec ratting - shows that they will have a reduced income, yes.
---
Yep, it's that room
---
You were in tapi, yet the post repeatedly talks about goonswarm.
---
You should go back to talking shit to 12 yr olds on xbox live
---
Unfortunately for you, there's only one server.  We're all playing the same game.  When that games becomes sufficiently un-fun for the minority of people not in TAPERIUM that everyone but you unsubs, you will have no more targets, and no one to blame but yourselves.
---
Can confirm, played Eve for maybe 2 minutes.
---
&gt; it's to be expected that the blackout would make bot detection more difficult, so CCP is likely recognizing a smaller portion of the game's botting income as such
---
Why would CCP's botting detection care about local or not? Obviously CCP can still see who's in system!
---
a over looked form of making good isk is buying cheep in jita and hauling to places like stacmon and selling at marked up prices it takes some research on your part but you can make lots of isk i personly perfer to buy my shit (when im staging that way)at stacmon because the game police dont like me and shoot at me in jita

Did you ever come back and found out your assets are locked in a nullsec outpost that you no longer have access to? It was functionally lost. You might be able to firesell it for a massive loss, or perchance flip the station back two years later. 
---
Given the other massive benefits of citadels over old outposts and POS, i would have happily traded up to a keepstar with no asset safety. 
---
Its only because CCP were dumbass pussies when they first implemented structures that anyone is complaining
---
And it's the only fight i know, when a side only used caps and no subs. offensive or defensive

I am just trying to get on your level Yonis

IMO everyone with blue next to their name is too progressive for current America. I see them doubling down on the topics that got Trump elected.... 
---
Sure it’s politically polite to say everyone should have healthcares and gunrights. 
---
But as an American that talks to people of all walks of life, bruh, you know what I’ve found everyone, every last one of them from all backgrounds of life loves making fun of each other, hell you can play the intolerance song infront of anybody and the only concern you’ll get is people not wanting you to lose your job.
---
Americans are really simple to understand at the end of the day.
---
In the words of the great General S Patton: American’s all true American’s love to fucking fight. The very Idea of losing is hateful to Americans....
---
Fight, from verbal arguments to full on gun battles. Ontop of that, Americans love weed, and a big beautiful pair of racially ambiguous tits.
---
2020 will go to the Man or woman who will give America the most guns, blunts, and tityfucks.

Sorry for the confusion but, this fit uses a medium booster  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78899052/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78899052/)  . I would have liked to hang around 35% but, I was really hesitant to burn through charges  because early on, it was clear  that VINDI was going to put up a tough fight and it was going to be an endurance run. I also should have swapped crystals at a few different points to hang around a healthier cap point.
---
I'm in test, having just come back after a few years out. The character of people there now are way more whiny carebear than it used to be. Safe nullsec brought a lot of would-be highsec players out here, into the safest alliances.
---
It certainly is on average.
---
Nope, it 100% spawns when you jump it. You can warp to the sig, sit on it but until you jump, it won’t spawn the K162 exit. Now if you leave it there is a chance it can spawn on its own within the 15 hour sig lifecycle.
---
For one. Sov has been complained about nonstop for years, especially fozziesov. Citadels have been complained about since we actually have to kill a shitton of them. Capitals have been nerfed for several years. Anom rates have been nerfed more times than people can even count this year alone simply because CCP hasnt even given out information regarding the actual changes. Moon goo changes werent what NS wanted, it was the other side that kept crying that nothing should be earned afk so CCP changed it into an active thing. Coalitions actually lost direct isk because of it.
---
Eves economy was falling down, it is now. Stop using economy as an excuse for these changes. 
---
You are completely missing the picture here dude and just following the propaganda line that NS is whats killing the game.
---
I'm simply restating what CCP has stated.  Note I haven't said I believed it. Reading is hard I know.
---
proving conduits still require activity.
---
Highsec botting it seems.
---
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. But CCP isn't going to remove that major revenue stream now are they? So what's the use in complaining about it? 
---
What we need is to coexist peacefully with skill injectors, and part of that means no more end game ships. If there are 10 different mining ships but everyone interested in mining wants to inject into the same one then *something ain't balanced right*.
---
I've lost two 1.7B Gilas  and made about 4, so I'm just isk positive, but I'm loving the difficult content.  It's nice to have to think a bit rather than just mash F1 and make sure you don't kill the next wave trigger too soon.
---
Historically, when defenders refused to come out of a fortress and fight, the attackers got to burn the fields, drive off all the livestock, and steal all the home-furnishings they could carry. 
---
Eve has never really had that, except in the very limited ability to turn off station services. But with everything in Eve depending on timers (or essentially requiring any viable group to have N+1 in every time zone), it doesn’t really work very well. 
---
Any system has to be somewhat balanced on the effort required for attackers and defenders and be a fun game mechanic.
---
Good troll post.
---
So tell me how I... or whatever you think i am... is the problem?
---
till eve-scout website has only 2 wormholes scanned.
---
You are getting downvoted because you dont understand what is happening. Im sorry but weve had tons of "new" players that consistently say things that dont make sense. Now you might actually be a real new player but that honestly doesnt qualify you to have an opinion. Especially since you think the low amount of new players is matching the massive amount of outgoers.
---
You also dont have the possibility of a super being dropped on your head when you are roaming someone else's hole. Should we even discuss the fact you can isolate yourselves for a time if you dont want to deal with people? What about the fact you all have generated 12T in blue loot in nearly relative safety for only having a few thousand players in wormholes?
---
I upvoted your post from a -3 to a -2. Hope it helps.
---
That "vocal minority" was ignored for 3 years, so what do you think made 2019 so special?
---
&gt;Why not just stop playing if you are not happy? 
---
When people have invested literally years in the game, it's reasonable for them to give feedback before abandoning it.
---
Nah, they just need to put their money on shorting commodities. Then just crank out some more dev blogs and boom: profit.
---
^(Also maybe some financial investigation)
---
let me know what you decide so i dont have to think about it
---
Welcome to cactusjack48 he's a bit of a fucktard and doesn't really contribute much to anything
---
The CSM told CCP when Fozzie took the Rorq out of the POS that it would be game breaking. They didn't listen then, either. From what's been said by those who were there, Fozzie's first iteration was even more OP than now. Maybe CCP, who doesn't play their own game, should have listened.
---
So, why do they have to be big bloc battles? I totally appreciate that you don’t have the kind of time someone in my position has where literally all of my free time is spent on Eve. If the big blocs didn’t exist or more importantly COULDN’T exist, then you’d have many smaller groups vying for the same space and the same resources. I freely admit I haven’t ever tried to take down a citadel. However, if in order to make headway you and a few hundred other people had to coordinate and that was enough to break down another corp’s foothold during a couple of timers across a couple of days, the content is restored. 
---
The angle I’m coming from is people are terrible. In a world without restrictions we will all try to have everything and make sure everyone else has nothing. In the digital world of eve we can live out this fantasy by having enough people (50k) agree to work together for our own interests. Suddenly achieving your interests takes no effort. Now the game is boring. If alliances didn’t exist, corps would have incentive to try to grow and expand or, as others have mentioned be more nomadic and encroach on another corps territory. Break their defenses for just long enough to rob their resources and go back home. 
---
A solution (good/bad/shit/otherwise) would be to remove alliances entirely or cap them at x corps and cap corps at a significant lower number. Then even a max power alliance couldn’t just wipe another alliance away in a few days. An alliance of smaller corps could stand a chance against a single powerhouse Corp. The idea is to prevent the unchecked growth ad infinitum.
---
"Are there some fun things to do as 3 beginners ?"
---
nope.  break out the CC and get to buying some plex.
---
I want to see CCP adapt to having 10,000 paying players left once all this settles
---
I still hope they will wake up but ye. Alienating the only players that actually put up with their shit for years in such a shitty manner as well. Like they basically are telling us to go fk ourselves with every change/comment/interview and they somehow think it wont affect players reviews of the game.
---
Who the fk joins a game where a massive amount of players have recently left/are leaving?
---
correlation is not causation
---
But we don't bring 30 people to kill vnis. We bring at most 3 to 7. 
---
Heck, we bring at most 20 people to kill caps by partnering up with other small groups.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Plus even if some one else brought 30 people to an alliance's home, you can easily counter it with 300 subcaps instead of 300 capitals.
---
Quit. Crying. Ya. Baby.
---
Sov lost its value. I mean it wasnt even all that worth prior to this but now its basically worthless. But hey, this is "breaking" stagnation. People will fight more over useless things.
---
Fking moronic honestly.
---
I'm waiting for another Hilmar dream where Eve talks to him and says, "Holy shit, dumbass, what did you just do to me?"
---
Your 14T is off and your percentage is off which is why I doubt your numbers. It’s easy to disprove. The number of players in WH is less than 10% of what’s in nullsec (before blackout). It’s impossible to sustain the same income as null due to game mechanics and probability, bounties alone in null generate more profits. 
---
What you are trying to do is force data of what you think based on your predictions and logic because it supports your idea. Regardless how many variables are in your calculation and the lack of hard evidence. This is why my argument holds as much weight as yours so without proper data. This debates stop here. From years of experience and living in both space, With the small player base that lives in WH and how difficult ratting is, its impossible for WH to generate the income in null unless null becomes empty. Even with this happening, null rewards are still greater than WH.
---
Now as far as preparing a WH to rat in and interruptions. I can tell you haven’t lived in a WH with this comment. The time it takes to secure a WH is length like I previously stated. Just because you “preped” your WH doesn’t mean you’re safe from interruptions. You’re exit/home wh can get a random connection along with the WH youre ratting in. Null interruptions are not long “as long as you fight for your space” and you can safely go back ratting several mins later. Anyway i can do this all day but whats the point. Null is easier and more lucrative vs WH. 
---
Only thing null had that made a really boring play style were multiple afk alts afk camping your system. Same happens in WH space.
---
Black out finally bridges the gap between risk vs rewards in null. It is a proper game balance that was well overdue.
---
Messengers dont tend to have opinions. Please be the messenger:)
---
This is CCP we're talking about, you should only be surprised if something in particular is NOT broken.
---
Agreed, exactly my point :)
---
Awesome, will be very neat to see.  Thank you.
---
So this post gets pinned when?
---
&gt;" To the vocal minority. I don’t mind you having issues with the current direction. "
---
Bud the minority are the ones who are pro "chaos", you are the minority
---
Damn, hella read that wrong!
---
They have made it rather clear that its a newly formulated plan. And it plans fail which is also business 101, people get fired for choosing the wrong plans as well.
---
Okay first of all, yikes.
---
Secondly, did everyone really _let_ goons krab for years?  Most groups joined together to push them out of their space during WWB, and for all the effort that went into it, all goons did was pack up and move to lowsec and blueball the shit out of everyone and leave them to grind sov.  
---
Now goons have NIPs with pretty much everyone strong enough to challenge them (its been this way for a while), not that anyone has much interest in trying to move on their space anyway because _we saw how fun that was last time_. I mean, you've even saddled up with the MANGO nerds, who basically did this on the other server to the point that they killed all content to the point of it being abandoned.  
---
There's only one game.  There's only one server, and that server has a problem. The problem isn't CCP, the problem is that the majority of the playerbase has been duped into forming a huge blue donut, and baited into blaming the developer for a lack of enemies to fight. How can CCP hope to help you if you're too clueless to help yourselves?
---
I would love to learn to FC.  I’m pretty new and have barely flown in fleets and certainly don’t have a great grasp of the mechanics.  What’s the best way to actually learn these days?  Are there any corps that excel at teaching or grooming FCs?
---
And it gives cancer aswell. If you didnt have cancer and you get the treatment it means you are at a higher risk of dying without any benefits.
---
Hilmar picked up the crack pipe
---
Well the whole problem is that the game is too old to even think about people waiting it out to rebuild later. That's the problem of age we all face where we grow up and have less time to play.
---
I agree that wormhole are not "safe" but having lived there for two years it's not the bottom of hell either. At least you don't get roaming fleets h24 into your hole and can manage some safety, while rewards are much higher but not permanent.
---
As for capital fights, I think your example means easier to kill the lone capitals (which is good) but way harder to have any kind of capital engagement. Capitals engagement already take a lot of planning beforehand, but good luck getting a supercapital fleet on field vs a defending enemy with their own.
---
They can get away with doing mining, high sec ratting, and level one agents as a group of 3
---
Yeah, we'll just go right ahead and break up our coalition in the middle of a war against WC/PL+NC+PH/Snuff/PM/et al. What could go wrong?
---
Messengers can be have many things.  There is no exclusivity.
---
Oh, I comprehend a moronic "grr gons hat gons" post just fine.
---
No, it would move to Perimeter. It’s moving there on it’s own already, killing Jita, whatever that means, would just speed it up
---
No, I wasn't dumb enough to keep shit on places that I might not be able to access
---
Did I stutter, or should we add literacy to the growing list of skills _not_ required to saddle up with your highly relevant blue donut?
---
If you didn't blue up most of the game or go out of your way to turbo-blob literally everything, people would be more inclined to fight you. This isn't rocket science, it used to be (and should still be) common knowledge even among the most novice FCs.
---
You guys remind me of the Dyatlov in the Chernobyl series. Everything is "not great, not terrible".
---
Underrated comment - if this is true then its sad
---
Feel free to invade. Kill the structures and claim the loot. If it is "too safe" as you claim, it is only because you have chosen not to do anything about it.
---
Also, you don’t all need to choose the same race and what not but it does make it easier to choose the same race as it will start you guys off at the same place
---
How are my numbers off they are literally based on the MER? I showed you every step of the way I did.

---
You can see the sleeper loot is missing from commodities but as we have the other two pieces you can determine it is 60.3%.
---
The rest of the numbers I used all came from those two charts.
---
Please explain which step of the following is wrong
---
Wormhole: 60.3% of 23.832t is 14.37t
---
Null: 81.7% of 21.196t is 17.317t
---
14.3/17.317 = .829 = 82.9%
---
Adding overseer to the nullsec total:
---
14.0% of 23.832t is 3.33t
---
Add that to null total above
---
17.317+3.33= 20.65
---
14.3/20.65 = .7 = 70%
---
Oh the ones with the DAU/MAU being the highest in five years?:)
---
/r/evejobs might be a good place to start.
---
They deployed to south so it’s kinda ok atm.
---
But before their deploy, snuff dropped their roquals 4 fun on every target, at black rise, even on couple assault frigs.
---
It’s real issue when they’re around.
---
&gt; How is it fucking with sov warfare? Of you can drop 100 Titans, you can field recon and blops cynos easily. 
---
You can, and you can also blap these ships to oblivion in one volley, making it extremely hazardous to drop huge fleet on a contested grid, meaning defenders get even more of an advantage.
---
&gt; It doesn't have much of an impact. The few things that use cynos don't dramatically rely on them and aren't even close to a majority of activities.  
---
&gt;The fact they can do it easily without cyno is exactly the point I made.  
---
&gt;What do you think the word "RELY" means?
---
Your point was to say it doesn't impact anything, I just proved you that it does. The fact that you can do other things to work around these changes is irrelevant.
---
I'm still waiting for your definition of other activities that consist in the majority of the nullsec stuff happening, I think mine is pretty complete but i'm open to anything.
---
The good news is theres a ton of really great new player crews out there. The games rough, and has a steep learning curve, but theres a lot that will help you through it. There are absolutely good corps out there that will take you in.
---
When said corps reach out to you, please do a favor, and make sure they are doing stuff FOR you. A good corporation provides value to its members, and a lot of corps out there prey on new players who simply want/need a place so they don't realize they are being taken advantage of. If your corp isnt outright making the game more enjoyable for you, and enabling you to have fun you are in the wrong corp.  
---
If you havent heard from several people to help you with some basics by later tonight, hit me up and Ill help you out.
---
The tutorial and career agents are designed to be done alone, but everything else you can do together if you want.
---
I would do some exploring in wormholes. Do the exploration career agent missions then use your exploration frigates to look for Class 1, 2 or 3 wormholes. You can check the type from the wormhole system name [on this site. ](http://anoik.is/) Inside look for other wormholes or relic or data sites with one of the NPC pirate factions in the name (Sansha, Blood Raider, Angel, Serpentis, Guristas). Make sure you always bookmark both sides of every wormhole you go through. Take the loot back to highsec often because you could get jumped by other players at any time. You can make anywhere from 5 mil to over 100 mil from one site. 
---
A medium term goal might be to move into a wormhole of your very own. Read up on wormholes first and how they differ (what the C classes mean, what kind of static connections they have, wormhole effects etc). Pick one that you like, make sure it's empty (check the killboard activity on anoik.is, look for other citadels that aren't in Low Power state) and then anchor an Astrahus or a Raitaru to live in. And there's more than just relic sites, you can get into gas mining, running Sleeper sites, PI or even moon mining, though the ore isn't very good in wormholes. Plenty of opportunity for PVP too. It's dangerous for all kinds of reasons but for a small, close knit group it can be a lot of fun.
---
&gt;Did I stutter,
---
I don't know if you stutter. It's impossible to read stuttering.
---
However, if you had just drooled on the keyboard, then smashed your face against it, that would have made a ton more sense than that bullshit you typed.
---
You can do everything together regardless of race empire bloodline whatever.
---
choosing the same things will just make you start in the same system (or near to eachother) while choosing different ones may take up to 20 minutes to get to eachother.
---
Same empire would be helpful, so you have less travel to meet up. Same school would put you in the same system when you start. But neither of those are required. If you started out Caldari, Gallente, and Amarr, you'd just have to travel to meet up.
---
If you Fleet up, you can help each other with missions. You'll get shared money and reputation for completion. But you won't get credit for completing the missions, as far as the tutorial process goes. So you'd each want to accept those separately, even if you help each other complete them.
---
Then you just keep on keeping on with fleet activities. Fleet missions, fleet mining, fleet exploration.
---
science bitches
---
Secondly, Why did you skip the part where goons were almost dead without isk because MBC stole hundred of bil/player from Goons but manage over 2/3 years to become 1°) the biggestd Alliance in eve ever made 2°) the richest alliance ever made and 3°) the biggest superfleet ever made.
---
I'm talking about that part, that tiny 2/3 years where everyone in their right mind could have seen goons becoming the big fish. But instead Panfam etc decide to become fat and lazy and twist the knife "nah dw they are just krabbing"
---
Idiots is most def one of them. Gj!
---
You mean spending t8me seeding dreads and then hoping hole isnt evacuated? :D god no.
---
&gt; Your point was to say it doesn't impact anything, I just proved you that it does.
---
When did I say that?
---
I never remotely said that.
---
&gt; I'm still waiting for your definition of other activities that consist in the majority of the nullsec stuff happening, I think mine is pretty complete but i'm open to anything.
---
Why would you need to wait? You made a decent enough list, ignoring small gang pvp, or whatever.
---
And your list pretty clearly showed that the majority of activity doesn't rely on cynos.
---
honor tank ;p
---
Join us on our discord https://discord.gg/eeCX7ch if you're interested and we would be more than happy to help you answer some questions and possibly get on board.
---
Thats true actually.
---
In theory, but let's face reality, 
---
blackout and partially cyno changes destroyed most of these opportunities, otherwise how do you explain this massive player drop? 
---
Bots? Cmon everyone living in null can confirm it. 
---
In reality ratting in subcapitals is nearly impossible, you'll be ganked in no time, and when you have several people on you you'll die, no matter your fit, and you'll die so quickly that standing fleets are totally useless. 
---
Someone will argue about "risk vs reward" or "null safety" narrative, but what's the reward? 
---
Where's the safety? 
---
The truth, and we all know it perfectly, is that such safety and such big reward came from a CCP mistake called INJECTORS,that cause this nonsense proliferation in caps, ratting supers and rorqual pilots. 
---
So instead of blaming players for capital umbrellas or 20 rorqual alts, people should blame CCP for creating the requirements for these things to happen. 
---
Same for bots. 
---
The 1st victims of blackout are not bots (who have already adapted) but players with one or two accounts and new players, who are forced to do only a small fraction of all the things that before they were able to do since the beginning of the game.
---
Why they should continue to pay for not playing? 
---
Insted of that CCP should identify players by hardware data, and identify bots by their characters activity,and when they find a bot they should ban all their accounts and block the creation of new accounts. 
---
Some will adapt changing hardware but they can't change hw forever because it will be too expensive.
---
Ye its strange. Can imagine it working tho since the attackers had to stay on grid no matter what. Sooner or later caps will shred you, atleast the old versions. Now they just suck dick.
---
OK, a random goon can asume that snuff (!) has reddit brigade... but you? You should at least kow that we don't have anything on reddit but a few trolls and leadershio that doesn't give a crap what goes in here.
---
&gt; That's not really related to the fact people are screaming that the sky is falling when **the changes actually don't affect that much at all**. 
---
Here.
---
&gt; Why would you need to wait? You made a decent enough list, ignoring small gang pvp, or whatever. 
---
But it's there : 
---
&gt; Roaming pvp &amp; defense : probably involve cynos way more than roamers would like if we just read reddit, right ?
---
&gt; And your list pretty clearly showed that the majority of activity doesn't rely on cynos. 
---
I just made a point that cyno changes AFFECT nullsec players, because today we rely on cyno for most of the stuff. I don't disagree that we can do without it, merely stating a fact.
---
Many usages are also for convenience, which means that these changes made the game even more tedious, but it has no effect on the playerbase, ever.
---
buahaha
---
Sharp words and witty criticism are good supplements to arguments that also contain _actual substance_.  While I do acknowledge and appreciate the burn, I can't help but point out that you've said little to refute my criticism.
---
Lol. Im not certain he wouldnt take that as a green light to further introduce boredom, oh I mean "chaos".
---
If init can spend a year seeding Rage to kill a few keepstars, you can spend a weekend seeding a few dozen dreads. Hole control keeps people from evacuating assets. Simple things. Easy to do. Inner Hell does nothing but evictions.
---
But what am I taking about... it's not like WH space allows you to be bailed out by a cyno and a dozen faxes and supers. High risk game play in high risk space really isn't for the nullsec krabs.
---
I got my popcorn, I got my soduuuur, I got my 60+ rorqual alts all on a moon that papa vily told me to sub because everyone in test needs to, and totally has that many. I'm totally not a unique player with a different playstyle inside a nullbloc, nor do I have have any dissenting options from the norm as that would be against alliance rules. Like... please tell us, how much fucking koolaid did you down man, you need to chiiiiill on the irrelevant bullshit.
---
This is next level PCU shitposting
---
and why nerf wormhole ? buff the reward in null/NPC/LS and remove asset safety, make NPC station killeable 1x/month aswell  
---
i would like to see a great increase in risk/reward right now this "chaos" era is borring, MOOAAR chaos CCP
---
What does the PM there stands for? Just curious.
---
If only he'd turned to drugs sooner. Maybe they'd have fixed this mess nice and gentle like 2 years ago instead of waiting for it to spiral out of control first.
---
I spent my EVE times in wormholes, never lived in null. c5 and 6 sure, how you evict ppl from c3s  pointless discussion amyways, WHs should be more unpredictable for added fun, im usually bored there to no end trying to hunt stuff.
---
also its amusimg that everybody who does not agree is automatically null carebear. such a shortsight
---
Its in such a great place that people arent even doing it!
---
Silence krab your pve would be worthless if not for people blowing shit up
---
Spot on.
---
Haha I haven't killed an NPC in 7 years and haven't mined in a longer time. I couldn't be less of a krab.
---
Very much this.
---
*snort
---
Because you're criticism doesn't even bare refuting.  You're just another angry fuck who feels like all of Eve owes you gee effs just for showing up in D-P in some (most likely) nano cloaky bullshit.
---
You've also posted zero fucking proof anyone in tapi was complaining about not getting fights in staging.  Maybe you got one dumb fuck crying about not getting fights in esotaria, but generally,  we'll happily blob you to fuck there.
---
Our main staging is in the fucking middle of WC space, so we get fights there all the time.
---
So yeah. Get fucked.
---
Oh, a grammar nazi over here.  What's next, you're gonna say that people who don't have perfect grammar are inferior to those who do? That their opinions do not matter? May be they are better be isolated somewhere, where they no longer will be able to harm good honest grammatically correct net-denizens? A solution of sorts? To make it final?

Ibis has 933 base ehp and 2-2-2 slots with barely any PG and CPU to speak of. There's no way to make it match the tank of a t3c - estamel invuln with faction shield only brings it to 3.4k ehp with 11ehp/s regen. For DPS, even if you take officer weapon mods for low and blasters for highest dps you'll only get to around 130.

I've seen you call "old rules of 2014", but ibis hasn't changed that much since 2014. However, for the sake of argument let's make this easier for you and limit the fit to half of your stated numbers - 200dps, 10k ehp, 600 ehp tank.

eve cant handle losing this many people this fast for another 10 months....

or you can do entosis fights just like everyone else does. also fuck people who want to change rules for space they don't use.

Judging by your books, you went to the university in the mid 90s. (Owned the classic by Kernighan and Richie myself.) You must be a senior programmer today, I guess. Hence senior research went into the graphs as well...
---
What's next; *
---
What "null blob echo chamber?" It's not here -- this place is *defined* by its stark, virulent, rabid opposition to nullsec, more rigidly than anything I've ever seen in my life.
---
It's not the CSM. You tweeted as such yourself.
---
Where even could you possibly mean? The only thing I can think of is some sort of extrajudicial decision vector that we've established with CCP itself, powered by fell magic. That would explain all of the headless chicken corpses...
---
The little tick marks under the speed bar.
---
How am I supposed to know if a corp is helpful or not though?
---
Holy shit i love this, often not wanting to give up the opportunity cost of sitting in my +5 learning clone is what keeps me from doing something, I'm not proud of it but its the truth.
---
Ooh, look at them blobbers running in to defend their donuts, entirely missing the whole point. People not wanting content kills the game, not developers not magically creating it somehow.

She has been approved to join Fweddit
---
&gt; Do we have to choose the same empire / bloodline / school ?
---
No. The school defines your starting system and starting NPC corp.  The bloodline defines to which NPC corp you drop if you leave a player made corp.
---
&gt;Can we do the tutorial together ? What about the career agent missions ?
---
I suggest that you do that part independent of each other. Then I suggest you do the sister of eve epic arc. The last part(s) are a bit more difficult for a new player alone so you should team up there.
---
After that you can do all kind of things that you can do in eve. It's a lot so I won't write it all up here. As you are specific three players team abyssals are an obvious thing to check out. Those are instanced PvE thingies which you enter with three frigates. Otherwise, also try to do some PvP together early. For that also just use some cheap frigates ;)
---
&gt; Here.
---
...yikes, your reading comprehension is bad.
---
"Don't affect that much" does not mean "Don't affect anything".
---
&gt; I just made a point that cyno changes AFFECT nullsec players, because today we rely on cyno for most of the stuff. I don't disagree that we can do without it, merely stating a fact.
---
You don't really use "rely" in the same way that the word is defined. 
---
It's much more about it being a near requirement.
---
So the fact the activities don't really need it, except for a tiny bit of convenience would not be relying on it.
---
And even then, a lot of those activities that you listed aren't really affected by this change.
---
Moving rorquals around? not really affected, you'll just use a different ship for the cyno. OR you could not cyno.
---
About the only one meaningfully affected is the JF stuff because of the non-combat nature of the activity and the fact it is done regularly in less-than-friendly space.
---
But JF are not the majority of nullsec activity.
---
The only other thing that really relies on cynos and is meaningfully affected is the ability to instantly call a defensive fleet to your inattentive ass when you get caught by the enemy. Which is a pretty good change.
---
I do agree (at least I think you probably share this view) that this may put cloaky ships and covert cynos as being too powerful, and I'm not sure the best way to change this without entirely gutting the playstyle completely.
---
No sir. We need another New Player Experience. Sure it will dump them out to do the same boring missions and mining, but at least it will be new.
---
Sov is null sec. Null sec gets on/off simple changes to disract veterans until the NPE is finished.
---
I recently returned to EVE and d like to thank the ole buddies PMing me and saying "Welcome back!" :)
---
Funny part is, with alphas, most of them probably aren't even "paying" players
---
Thanks for the gon success story / history lesson.  I was completely unaware that goons went from being bludgeoned out of their space to a super strong untouchable entity now blue with the majority of null pvpers.  Could you please tell me more about how strong the taperium super fleet is, or how great of a leader the Mittani is?  I'm on the edge of my seat over here.
---
The best way to win at EVE is to have more dudes in bigger ships. This has been a constant since beta and entire alliances have spent years trying to work around this.
---
The chaos is making the game a lot more fun! Most of my current corp are all returning oldbros
---
It's not a 'grr olmeca' circlejerk, that would imply he's done something notable.
---
It's a 'lolmeca' circlejerk. I mean, how can you do anything **but** laugh at someone so up their own ass that they call reddit shitposting, "Weaponized Humor?"
---
can we get this in a graph, with colors like OP provided.
---
That was what, over a year ago?
---
Nope, no definite rule there, just an option.
---
I think sniggwaffe really help with that.  Alliances do have some FC training programs but they rely so much on main FCs.  Training FCs end up doing just some small roaming gangs.
---
Best thing is join a large coalition that does large fleets and learn tactics passively with main FCs then get in the FC programme.
---
I'd rather not go back to spod.
---
yea, back then we were the problem, apparently we are still the problem..
---
Bout tree-fiddy
---
Why should they?  Did they trigger *your* precious little fee-fees by bringing the subject up in the first place?
---
NS doesnt want loot drops. NS understands that loot already drops from industrial citas and nobody is rushing to kill them. Why is that? Could it be because NS wont start wars over potential loot from asset safety. And they know if it gets implemented they can just efficiently kill entire groups meaning the long term viability of NS wars goes down the drain.
---
You say make people fight for their space but you have forgotten that people do it on a daily basis. And that they put in the work once already to even get the space.
---
And youre entire argument seems based on a thought of what things used to be but you are forgetting that PL used to crush everyone with their teleporting superfleet. Is that the game you want? Exactly where was this magical era in which blocs didnt exist? When did loot drop from stations? When werent cynos a thing?
---
You keep bringing up nostalgia but you fail to understand it wasnt better before. 
---
And fyi, nobody wants a serenity here. Its pretty shitty that you tell the other guy he deals in absolutes and then proceed to put it as if NS wants serenity or nothing. We want good changes, period. And honestly, I couldnt give 2 shits about how roamers feel. As if its their god given right to score easy kills. Fk that shit dude, you want kills, fking be willing to pay the price for it. If you cant, find another activity that suits your strenghts and weaknesses better.
---
Now I can accept a compromise but you dont want something like that. You want the majority to bend to your will. They wont and shit will get worse and worse.
---
Cant argue with that logic
---
Keep these coming, great reads
---
Given that there's no way to detect someone using this exploit it makes sense to not publicise it.
---
That is valid. Im not disagreeing. But being in the position that you are, do you min max the people you play with? I.e. if you can't fly a certain ship, don't come on this flret, or everyone needs to have atleastone fax/dread/super alt? 
---
My position is that min maxing is a perfectly legitimate lay style, but when you start min maxing people themselves, that's where it gets over bearing.
---
This guy gets it
---
You mean to actually invest money into the game? Shame for even suggesting that!
---
IDGAF about minmaxing... I m just in EVE for the fun and stressing out over tiny increments of whatever aint fun for me.  
---
I dont mind if ppl do it, except their minmaxing starts influencing my "lalalaaaa"-bumble-bee-gaming. Like back in null where folks started poking me not tu run specific sites cause it makes it uncomfy for them to run the one specific type they wanna run. And some really had a stick up their \*\*\*\* about it. Or if a given doctrine changes for the 100th time cause of "just another minor tweak" -.-  
---
Yes, I run gas-havens, so WHAT?! :D
---
CEO says do it... you do it... CEO doesn't give a fuck what some dude on reddit says... To quote my President "We are Winning!"
---
the rate it loses players at will go down when the ones that are complaining are gone. it isnt a straight line because that would require everyone to intend to quit over these things which is A: not the case and B: some are even resubbing because of it.
---
I've had the same thing happen to me. Killboard rep was more important than having fun. Im in a group now that doesn't care and it's everything I thought it could be? 
---
Lose a bhaalgorn and leshak whelping it to kill a Proteus that was a dick. Fuck it go for it.
---
Thing is, I dont see how that could even happen. I mean the game is in decline. Dunno the terms but I find it hard that any terms would involve killing the game.
---
Yes, but you don't mind max people themselves. That's where the difference is. 
---
Min maxing pi, Indy, etc is of course always good to do.
---
This is why I gave up trying to be really serious on here that often. It’s never appreciated.
---
No checkmark option?
---
i know!!! sholud I go hide for it?
---
If you aren't having fun, they aren't helpful. Don't fly anything you can't afford to lose.  Don't grind away with trying to make isk at the start with something silly like mining.  Buy some plex for 15$ and fit up a bunch of really cheap PVP frigates and join some fleets and volunteer as a scout and ask them to teach you about your overview, (unfucking overview) learn about Dscan, Download Pyfa fitting tool, learn about all the different hulls and bonuses, and watch some youtube videos about basics.  Do this (a few hours of reading and watching) and you will be a year ahead of someone that never asked for help. PM me with any questions you may have and I'll try and help where I can.
---
When was this magical era when you didnt have alts that could light your cyno? Its BS. Straight up BS.

Its funny how we are seeing less and less "ohh look the BO is so awesome" and people are slowly becoming aware of the issues. And now we see bargaining from the other side trying to keep this sub hyped about broken things just because they like it.
---
Yeah totes my dude!  I mean, the idea of players killing the game is like the idea of fishermen killing the sea by overfishing.  I mean, there's always more fish in the water no matter what we do right?  If the fish run out it's their own fault for not just breeding more AMIRITE?
---
Gosh these fkn PL retards AMIRITE?
---
Not a new thing. See https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Hyperkittens
---
If you face a counter you'll die. But that's obvious and true for every ship. The nice thing about tristans is that they can be fit in so many different ways that the opponent can't know what to expect.
---
Lol okey dude.
---
Just as an activity that you and your friends could do, frigate abyssals would be good. And low level ones can easily be done with t1 frigates
---
2 dps, 1 logi. Have fun
---
What I think?  
---
1. Eve is suppose to be challenging and the Devs aim to keep it that way. 
---
2. The game has been in a bit of a rough place for the past couple years, I admire that the Devs are willing to take chances to save a game that is on the verge of being in maintenance mode. Do you want to play Titans Online or Eve Online?
---
3. For how experienced you claim to be, have you thought about trying to adapt to the new changes?
---
4. What is the ratio of the amount of time you spent complaining about the new changes vs adapting to the change?
---
5. Are you waiting for your alliance to tell you how to adapt to the change due to a lack of being innovative or laziness? Or are you involved with your alliance to determine how you will adapt?
---
Frigs are the best way to try and get into solo pvp. My advice would to be set your clone to jita 4-4 and then buy a T1 frig of your choosing. Fitted of course and boat over to tama. Or a lowsec of your choosing and then warp to FW plexes and try it out. There’s a ton of different play styles going on in FW and you will learn a ton. 
---
The Tristan you we mentioning is a kite Tristan so you stay out of range of most people’s weapons, you don’t want to get into scram web range or you will melt. If you use the orbit option you will most likely get slingshotted. Which either will get you killed or lose your kill. 
---
This games pvp is very in depth once you start digging into it. Pulling fits from zkillboard is an awesome way to get some fits. But think about the fitting before you buy it. Go over each module and understand why it’s on the ship. Play around with fittings that work for you. They is no end all be all fits in eve when it comes to solo pvp. 
---
Shout to dual rep incursus. It’s my favorite T1 frig (:
---
Was expecting el'miner or urgaypwnd. But the real link was even more sad.
---
Kiting Tristans are pretty popular in FW.
---
You should! Bad bad man. This fine gentleman is trying to teach you how to love shitty things, he only wants you to become a better person, so does CCP, and you reply with wanting them to use vaseline when they rape you and the hobby you have spent a shitton of money and time to nurture?
---
Bad bad man! Be a good sheep and accept what the "elders" are saying!
---
Moral of the story: Just wox some nerds
---
They've gone to plaid!
---
Faction warfare experts: Kiting tristan is recommended. Do not chase short range pilots or attempt to engage destroyers.
---
Armor tank it? Duhhh.. jeez
---
And any attempt to say otherwise is being brigaded for the past few days.
---
That's what I mean. When people start min maxing you it's too much
---
People who can't make or keep friends complaining about people who can, shocker.
---
&gt; you aren't long pointing anybody at that range
---
laughs in arazu
---
If this sarcastic metaphor is CCP as the fisherman and the players as the fish than yes, this sarcastic metaphor is correct.  
---
But if you really are going to be dumb enough to think that players leaving the game because of CCP and Hilmar's fucking dumbass leadership is the players fault, than by all means, be a window liker.
---
Yes, but maybe not the way you'd expect.
---
Eve is a social game, maximizing those connections is often more important than things like killboard statistics. If we're running a fleet which requires cloaks, that's the requirement. But if it is an assault frigate or battleship fleet we're still going to bring newbies in T1 frigates. When you get into caps and supers, it's important to the group that everyone do things correctly. You're not excluding people this way, just teaching them how to be better.
---
The exclusive-elitist philosophy has I think been soundly shown to be a losing strategy as they have lost out to the more open newer player friendly groups. Min-maxing on people today means investing in new players and building a diverse group of many play styles. Half of the people reading this right now are thinking "grr n+1" but it's not about numbers it's about building a community where people can feel like they are a meaningful part of something larger.
---
Not enough of Eve has learned this yet.
---
it will melt down. try erebus
---
Dunk, will you have my babies? Or give me babies? Or anything that would require intimacy in any form or fashion?:)
---
Great stuff man. Thank you for putting in the effort. And not just you, the entire CSM honestly. Even Olmeca (ikr) cause you guys are doing something that most honestly wouldnt do. You are taking on a unpaid second job to benefit us all and I cant thank you all enough for it.
---
And honestly, while were at it, thanks to everyone that does more than they have to in this game. We might not all get along ingame (which is the way it should be) but without you guys nothing would happen in this game. All the logistics people, all the alliance people, all the content creaters (small and big gang), all the people that help the newbro with their first 100m or just some advice, and so on. You are awesome!
---
Besides our obvious differences this is still an awesome community, we could live without some of the toxicity though.
---
&gt;even on 2\~3 assault frigs.
---
Even E-Uni's Merlin blobs. In some ways, it's kind of hilarious that they drop caps on a fleet composition which is that easy to counter (slow frigates with antimatter blasters aren't hard to avoid).
---
Asset safety doesn't make sense and should be removed. Just allow insurance. Problem solved.
---
There should be Dynamics. If you want to shut down all organics , you don't really want a sandbox. Maybe blizzard should do a space game.
---
I honestly believe you guys are more the doctors and CCP being the patients.
---
Thanks for all the work you put in man.
---
Too soon man!
---
&gt;it's the safest place right now.
---
It's certainly safer than Low-Sec, but that's about it.
---
For there to be wolfs there must be sheep a poulation of only wolfs would quickly die..... This is the problem. We need a rule set that allows for people to operate how they want and still provide meaningful content for them. If some random new guy wants to salvage or pve in null for a few hrs a day he should at least be able to come out Isk positive. The current state of the game renders most subcap linemembers feeding the solo or small group  hunters.
---
well, that's like every other game, if you don't log in you lose. Asset safety doesn't make sense. I think it should be replaced by insurance.
---
\*sry, cant resist\*

"Whats the ducks and chickens for then?"
---
If you have a moment friend, I'd like to speak to you about our Lord and Savior of eve PvP, the Praxis.

Undervalued, overpowered, and always underestimated. Fit it how you want , seek glory, and welp away carefree. Take every fight, and you might be surprised at what you can solo with a sub 200m isk shitfit.
---
I think youre being to harsh man. There is a limit to what the CSM can actually do and that limit is pretty much just trying to get CCP to not implode the game. Which isnt even working atm.
---
A+ post.
---
Much approve.
---
Mining is fun if you're in a fleet with other people mining.
---
how do i use a  Caldari State Starbase Charter to mine a moon?
---
That doesn't really make sense in the context of my response, but you do you.
---
I am curious though; do you just see a post with a GSF flair that exceeds your attention span, and just assume it's 'crying?'
---
SOv should be like FW and if you don't own the System from plexing it cost 10x to power your structures.
---
fozzie sov+shitty citadel mechanis +assest safety = no wars and action like before all these crap
---
If only the good die young, r/eve will live forever.
---
Imagine being so retarded to actually spend money to give Brisc a fake internet award
---
Go give it to your local animal shelter or something instead of being a fucking retard
---
I feel you man. All I ever wanted to do in EVE was PvP I ran around had some fun and then went into my carrier just long enough to fuel said PvP as I find PvE in this game uhm "boring" to say the least. I can't do that anymore even without the Cyno changes a carrier was dead before it could be saved. Now with the cyno changes you would need one Pilot for the Carrier one for the FAX and one for the recon for a reward that is not worth it anymore. The only reasonable way to make money in 0.0 nowadays is having a shitload of accounts to save your super (normal carriers just die to quickly) or rorq mine. This cooincedentaly is the "injector way" too.
---
Yes Blackout created content and still does but it has too many downsides IMHO. All I do nowadays is log in run a fleet and log off. Once my ISK reserves are dry I'll just quit. I don't want to but I will have to as my way of playing the game is dead.

Its cute you think theres anybody left to dog pile you.
---
I was thinking more like it's just an iHUB, no TCU, with the reinforcement mechanics of citadels, remove nodes and sovwands all together. 
---
Granted I am not a game designer but I just miss stront checking, or prodding for a fight, which was eliminated by citadels.
---
Government is a waste of taxpayer money.
---
-_- 
---
This wasn't common knowledge to me, never saw a thread on it before.  Thank you!
---
&gt;Secondly, did everyone really let goons krab for years? Most groups joined together to push them out of their space during WWB, and for all the effort that went into it, all goons did was pack up and move to lowsec and blueball the shit out of everyone and leave them to grind sov. 
---
Yep, they did allow us to do so unmolested. (Notable exception to TEST -- they at least *tried.* Ineffectually, but they definitely tried.) All hostiles had to do was kill one asshouse in Ashitsu, which was in range of their stager, and we wouldn't have been able to leave. This would have killed us, obviously. You know how we're all addicted to sucking crok and shooting red crosses, to the exclusion of nobler pursuits such as PVP, or even to the exclusion of basic pattern recognition? Just think -- deny us that need and we'd clearly die off. I guess it was too hard for a 60,000 man coalition to keep a few key systems scouted and scoured of all structures for a while.
---
I dropped that asshouse, too. Really, if you think about it, I was more motivated and more clever than the largest coalition the game has ever seen. Basically, I'm awesome, and a hero. I'm also modest and a sharp dresser.
---
Could it be that no one just cares about potential loot and wormholers in general?
---
So because I'm having a good time with the changes and feel they enhance gameplay I'm somehow objectively wrong? How the fuck does that work? My enjoyment of gameplay does not hinge on one dudes opinion on this sub. What an odd way to think.
---
She has 7 already, this will make 11.

i just assumed that since all these smaller elite pvp alliances are getting *so many* new recruits with the black out that they would band together and nano gang us to death
---
im complaining but not gone becuase i sub for a year at a time, dont really want to leave just cant get much done in null right now as ratting is all but extinct in subcaps. i was excited at the start of blackout but all thats really around is a bunch of cloaky stuff and they wont engage in a fight for the most part unless your alone in a pve ship.
---
they could also play another game and have fun.
---
I said it yesterday or the day before, when the wolves were the top of the food chain in the game, it had 40k players online, when the farmers got to farm, the numbers jumped off a cliff.
---
I’m about a month in and I’m having a blast doing null sec exploration
---
Damn.  Best thing to do there is use the prop mod trick.
---
Leave your prop mod activated/cycling on repeat when you enter each conduit.  It's remains on into the next site, but ALSO leaves you invulnerable and aimed directly at the next conduit burning toward it at full speed.
---
As long as you don't target anything you won't receive aggro for a given time, something like fifteen seconds? In other words, don't any of the NPC ships--I've been able to launch drones and target nearby caches/nodes for a few seconds without aggro, but play it safe and leave drones in &amp; don't lock anything.  Just coast toward the conduit like, "no need to bestir yourselves, gentlemen, I'm just leaving."
---
Learned this trick paying close attention to one random Abyssal PvE video on YouTube.  Can't remember which one or who it was, but he's a wonderful person for sharing.
---
Eve is well known for its min maxing and creative ways of exploiting mechanics. It’s part of what makes the player base so different. There are some real 20 pound brains playing this game. If everyone just mindlessly played as if it was call of duty it wouldn’t really be Eve.
---
Then do an alpha account, and check out exploration and WH space.  Running data sites and relic sites is like a mini game in itself as well as probing down wormholes.  It will also teach you important skills about checking Dscan, wh types, data site types, and fittings.  Lots of very handy skills with that profession for earning isk.

Or is it that I don't know I'm not having fun?
---
The complaint is mostly short term gain vs long term viability of the game. That CCP has/had a short term focus because they wanted to get bought out.
---
&gt; In theory, but let's face reality, blackout and partially cyno changes destroyed most of these opportunities
---
It destroyed them?  You can't do them anymore at all? Or is it that you can't do them in the absolute safety you could before?  You know, that thing you said you *weren't* worried about in your other post.
---
I’m not really sure what you are getting at? A good portion of eve at its core is space navy simulator. Very militaristic in its thinking and with that comes doctrines for FCs to be able to streamline how to take an engagement.
---
If we are looking at it from a game design perspective, In my eyes the core game loop is, roughly speaking, fly &gt; shoot (NPCs, rocks, players) &gt; gather resources (including loot)/build &gt; sell to make isk. That would roughly be the core game loop. It's the standard for most resource gathering games.
---
Then from there we add on more complex systems like sovereignty. So the secondary loop entailing sovereignty would look something like entosis structures &gt; capture areas &gt; build infrastructure &gt; work the land to make isk/resources.
---
Sovereignty is a secondary element of the game. It gives the game structure but it is not the core of the game. The game can can still be played without sovereignty. It's not the core of the game.

1. I like a challenge, but I like options for counters/tactics... I don't like "I have a cloak, you cannot see me, you don't know I'm here, I have all day to cyno 200 people on top of you; and theres nothing you can do about it; I know you can't call for backup, i love blackout btw and... im elite; you're a dumb krab"
---
2. I like a good capital battle; I think those fuckload mess tidi fights where it could go either way are pretty exciting...the last couple of years I have had some good experiences... I appreciate gangs/roaming/bringin back solo... I think it IS a challenge with local to catch people ratting/mining... but this is FAR too much...
---
3. I have adapted decently; what I can do; I'm doing... PVEP fits; recon cyno; scouting... but PVEing I'm 100% at the will of anyone with friends and a cloak... no matter what I do; so I don't PVE much lately
---
4. about 70/30... I get tired of jumping through my ass to try to PVE without dying when not doing fleets; so I now relax by shit posting about how I hate CCP...
---
5. I think im fairly creative all on my own; I think in a 1v1 or 2; chances are I'd kill Mr. Hunter leet man... but Mr. Bombers Bar or Leet 20/30 Man "small gang" VS 1 guy is not looking too good...
---
I think those that come at my alliance are going to pay a heavy toll; lookin at what we have in mind... but its like victims of terrorism; terrorist only hit easy targets, never where you are ready for them... but you have to be ready everywhere/all the time and at great expense... and they still freely can hit the easy target... so... I dunno...

Dear CCP, pls note that majority of criticism of blackout and cyno changes on this subreddit originates moslty from only one specific group.

Only you can decide.  Exooki's right.  Play your way, make friends, help each other.  Otherwise space is lonely.  Just be careful asking questions in-game.  You'll find more scammers, pirates and opportunists who would sooner convince you they'll help you just to have them take what little you have.  They can just as rightly believe YOU are a scammer, claiming to be a new pilot, trying to earn your credibility to take what they've earned.  Welcome to the eternal life of a capsuleer.  o7

Holy crap I think I had that same stats book back in undergrad...
---
Its a sarcastic metaphor which serves to illustrate a very basic concept - that systems can be broken if the influences impinging on it are not in equilibrium.  No, CCP haven't done enough to help the system's stagnation.  Their most recent efforts seem too little too late.  That being said, you scapegoat CCP for problems that caused by your own _style of gameplay_ (if you can even call it gameplay) at your own peril.  You can call people dumbasses and window-lickers all you want, but your stubborn condescension does little to mitigate the exodus of the few players to whom your are not blue.  The real question that interests me is: how long will you pat yourself on the pack for "ruining their game" before realizing that you're alone on the server, and that this was your game, too.
---
yay! for all the naysayers worrying about the population dropping, i have to wonder have any of the players they actually *know* quit? (ᵔᴥᵔ)
---
Large empires are too easy to hold. More territory should be harder to defend. Shorten timers, reduce defensive capabilities, etc.
---
Who said players didn't use alts to light cynos in the past? I agree... if someone does say that, it's BS. I didn't say that.
---
Bought the ore? The amount needed for a super fleet could only be mined in region the cost to ship that much would make it too expensive. Frts super fleet came form running an effective supercapital umbrella where it was safe to mine and build, not some botting vnis.
---
Best changes ever. Keep up the good work CCP.
---
Doesn't absolve them of the responsibility.
---
Let me guess, your IRL work doesnt include going on business trips and meeting people from other companies, institutions etc?? You obviously dont understand how communication works....
---
Same reason I didn't stay on the version of eve with a jukebox and no rorquals
---
Took me too long... Asshole
---
Upvote time :)
---
Thats kind of a romantic way to look at it, when you roll yourself in, you still run the risk of roamers popping up when no one is watching, so you actually can just suddenly have a fleet drop into system with you. You can mitigate this by just watching for new sigs, but if another group is rolling their static into you they you won't see them till they're already in system. 
---
As for the blue loot, getting the stuff usually means going out in specifically fit PvE ships, for the high value ones, this is basically carrier ratting (similar value ship's) and you have to be in a wormhole where a cap actually can just pop into system with you. 
---
I agree that it's much easier to defend a wh then it is to defend a null system, but your corp is basically locked to having all their stations in a single system, with shakey supply lines, and no assets safety.
---
 It's an "all eggs in one basket" strategy. Actually, treat a null sec system the exact same way and you might make more oak with less risk.
---
this is embarrassing lmao
---
So your subjective enjoyment isnt the same as objective truth? You feel it shouldnt be this way?
---
And the new player understands exactly jack shit about Eve. Its like letting a student teach the teacher. You get what knowledge is right? And experience? You simply dont know enough about the changes to talk about them. I mean most would understand that if its not their place to talk then they shouldnt talk.
---
Im not saying this to be rude. And welcome to Eve and Im glad you are enjoying yourself. But people are talking about aspects that are genuinly complex and require quite a bit of knowledge to analyse/predict. And here you are saying "hey guys Im super new and dont know anything but my opinion should matter nonetheless".
---
Im saying it doesnt. But you are ofc welcome to have your opinion and voice it. But people might downvote you and its not because they are retards, its because they belive your opinion to be irrelevant regarding this subject.
---
To be practical, for one we dont know if youre an actual new player. Secondly we dont know anything about what you actually do or dont do in the game. And if these changes have even changed anything for you corp whatsoever. Cause I keep seeing people saying changes have done this or that and when you look at it it turns out there is no correlation. 
---
And this is happening while things with correlation are breaking rapidly and we are seeing an exodus that is probably the worst one ever in this game. This one could quite frankly kill the game. So understand, people are worried and scared that their hobby during many many years might just die because of a vocal majority on this sub convinced CCP to go a certain way simply because they enjoy it.

---
That's making my point, there was some sarcasm involved.
---
If you're looking for someone to fly with for a few hours so you can ask them any question that comes to mind, I'm interested. Mentoring feels, for me, more rewarding that actually playing the game nowadays.
---
If you're still on day 1 I'd recommend taking it slowly, as jumping into a corp can be overwhelming.
---
I'm not sure WinterCo thought it out fully before they declared war on AOM. AOM is out for blood.
---
People are advocating that nullsec shouldn't have asset safety seem to think that will provide incentive to go on the offensive. If nullsec won't spend a week going after a WH group that can't hope to compete with nullsec numbers, then nullsec certainly won't bother another nullsec group who will put up a fight.
---
It's all the nullsec alliances arguing that WH should be riskier. That we get our profit with no risk. That WH space is too safe. Any nullsec alliance worth their salt could burn down every single WH alliance in C5 space within 3 months. Trillions could vanish. If you think WH space is too safe, you are the reason it's too safe.
---
See you could be right but the problem is they made too many changes.   Too quickly.      For example the last set of capital had not fully been felt.      ie the effect of fax nerfs vs dread bombs.  Blackout should of came before any of the nerfs they implemented more than likely.
---
Easy there fella were talking about video game stuff. Keep the irl hatefull talk out of it.
---
most corporations worth their salt are going to give you some free stuff to get you started. T1 frigates, destroyers even cruisers are pennies for any established corp, worth well below what theyll get back for a useful, active pilot.  
---
Im not saying a corp is bad if they dont give you free stuff, but I think most corps that are built to help players like you will have a program for such things.
---
Big oof
---
That quote you presented was in the cyno change post right? And its the only real change to happen in the past days that would affect caps right? And the only change is that caps now need to light cynos on a much higher trained alt than before.
---
So support from friends was never needed. Thats the BS part. The game was never this magical fairy land where supers needed "support" from friends to light cynos. Which means this isnt the game reverting to its natural state but instead its moving "forward". 
---
Basically I keep seeing very strange things lately. People clamoring for regression even though most of the things they say existed in context never really did meaning they just have this dream vision of what Eve was once that simply isnt true. Like in the case above. Thats how nostalgia works.
---
And they use this dream as an excuse for not accepting that these changes are in fact completely new to the game and have never previously existed. Like asset safety removal. Which never existed yet people argue it should be like the old days. Like the removal of blocs which existed since pretty much the start of the game.
---
Its just not real.
---
I do remember. Things is they should have encouraged more moderate numbers in groups. Yeas you can make coalitions a I'll but you have more leaderships from the beginning because the groups.are smaller. Would have moved forward fostering in the modern age of Eve politics and intrigue amongst many smaller entities instead of 4 leaderships controlling the entire game.
---
I like min/maxing my income, and generating stories as my faucet. Lost 300m strat hunting, killed a 100m astero before. Totally worth.

No babies. My daughters are grown now and I had a vasectomy.

---
what happened to the messengers to the King of Sparta :-)
---
unless this is tied to a change in when the Wh itself spawns, this would mostly just mean that the K162 shows up as I am in warp to a new wormhole, since it doesnt exist prior to initiating warp. They have several more seconds headsup than they do now agreed.  
---
You can absolutely start backstopping holes, but i guarantee you where there is effort and attention required, people will make mistakes. Where there are mistakes there will be deaths.  
---
I also would say i didnt propose this as a solo change, if we want to make WH ratting not the safest PVE in EVE there is more than one change needed.
---
And sitting on gate camps all day is not really that awesome gameplay either.
---
This makes my head hurt. Props for being able to run logo like this. Couldn't watch though, hope it all worked out well in the end.
---
While your challenge isn't a bad one, I find it important to challenge your assertion that "grr miners" exists.
---
Firstly: The reason I came to eve was for the scandal, drama, and lawlessness.   In my time over the past 12 years my time now is spent in a WH doing anoms, exploration, gas harvesting, and trying to find pvp for my lonely ass (and I like it).  With the exception of trade, I've tried just about everything and found what I enjoy.
---
Now my point is this: I love killing miners, almost as much as I like killing ratters.  My relationship to getting killed is the same while I'M ratting or mining.  All of these activities are part of EVE JUST AS MUCH AS PVP is a part of EVE.  So when people start whinging about "not being able to mine because of PVPers" that's not true, it just means that they will die periodically.  It's still tremendously profitable to do these activities.  Even if you're not a rorq, if you've done your due diligence you'll evade most attempts to gank you.  Most of space is empty and boring and you will be completely unmolested.  Is it hard for small players that are part of large groups? Maybe, because they have a target on their back... for being the largest wealthiest organizations in the game.
---
If you want to talk about small corps/allianes in null trying to pve being driven out by 24/7 casual roaming fleets from large organizations I'm still not sympathetic to "I'm not allowed to do X."  You actually still can do the activity, it may just not be profitable.  But by the time we get to these arguments it's often stated "I just want to enjoy mining in peace." If that's the case, then it doesn't matter that you're in null or low or high, so go somewhere where you won't be the carrot for large bored alliances.
---
PVPer's can't be guaranteed to secure a kill on anyone they want, but at the same time no PVE activity can be immune to a real risk of getting caught.  Right now the activities that people can do for isk vastly outperform the risk.  This is why there has been such a big push for increasing the rate at which people die.  Is it more of a chore for the defender? Yes, but up until recently it's been absolutely trivial for PVE survival: Watch local, warp out if an unknown shows up.  At the same time, attackers have had to find where targets are (small to medium investment), travel to them (small but tedious), discover where in space they are actually doing their PVE (ranges from medium to requires premeditation) and then act quickly enough to not spook the target.  Blackout on it's own was mild obfuscation of defender intel. 
---
EVE is defined by every action you take is a PVP action.  If you buy something on the market, you bought it at the expense of the opportunity of someone else.  When you mine something, someone else won't be able to mine what you did.  There is scarcity in eve, the problem is the rate at which it out paces player consumption.  If we don't address this issue there will cease to be meaning in playing.  The consequences of this will be players that came here thinking they could spend their days immune to harassment (the pew kind not the "urgaypwnd" kind) might leave.  I guess I'll miss them? But I sure won't miss their whining.  When people organize the PVE vs PVP player argument it's completely ignorant of the fact that tons of PVPers DO PVE however people who identify as "PVEr's" want a space for them to be immune to certain parts of EVE.  And we can't have that, the game cannot support creating a bubble for one type of play.
---
So no, I will not be developing any empathy for anyone who wants to segregate their isking activities from people who want to kill them, because eve depends on players killing everyone including PVEr's.
---
I am still new can some explain why he paid him to leave?
---
Cycle's been on for 3 years and counting.
---
Sub is in a questionable state and your flair sure is not helping the situation
---
Need to be omega first, but yeah, in a WH, with 3 characters at IV IV, I estimate 600m-800m/month (depending on costs, how much effort I put into it, etc).
---
Why do you think using python is insane? I assume that you are speaking in general and not about this specific project as it is quite simple.
---
Most likely cause 2 billion is pritty much next to nothing :) and I thought it was a good joke, Also yay space famous \\o/
---
The detailed answer to all of your questions would take a long time to write out, and it would probably lead to new questions from you. This leads me to believe that a voice chat is probably the best way to get you guys started. If you'd like me to take an hour to fly with you and answer any questions you might have, please let me know and I'll send you my Discord info.
---
LOL I tried to get my friends to play and all three of them said oh hell now that game is (insert every bad thing eve is known for)
---
Still less things to shoot.   except the bots
---
my corp has also seen a sudden revival, feels good :)
---
I want to comment but don’t want to encourage political arguments in /r/eve I preferred when it was just an ominous 2020 comment
---
I am happy when I make a few mill in a day and you say 2 bill is next to nothing lol I want to be like you when I grow up
---
&gt;Secondly, did everyone really let goons krab for years?  Most groups joined together to push them out of their space during WWB, and for all the effort that went into it, all goons did was pack up and move to lowsec and blueball the shit out of everyone and leave them to grind sov.
---
And what did NC and PL do in the north once goons packed up and left? They had the same opportunity to krab and grow their supercap fleet. Im also fairly certain that their space was not roamed as much as Delve was in the following years. They could have had double the supercap numbers they had in UALX, X47, 9-4RP, and established their dominance.
---
imho short delay for the K162 side. Something like 15 minutes or when someone jumps through (whatever happens first). This achieves what you have in mind while hunters still have the advantage if they are rolling for content.
---
I mean he was serious until he couldn’t defend his position
---
You say people but its a very vocal minority saying that. And they are idiots precisely because of what you are saying. 
---
Im not arguing against that. NS doesnt care about WHs. Why would we? But the other side of the argument is that people are/were complaining NS was/is too safe but not doing anything about it so they wanted CCP to nerf us. Many many of these people came/are from WHs and it turns out they have the best isk/capita in the game without any real risk. Far far better than NS.
---
So people are saying why is one thing okey but not the other? Nerf us then you need to nerf them because all the talk has been about faucets and such.
---
Its a valid argument. And people from WHs all of the sudden feel faucets are fine because their head is on the chopping block. Which is hypocrisy.
---
And as you know there are alot of background deals you will never hear of. So I wouldn't bet surprised if there was a deal to let goons go safely so they could continou to play without ragequitting.
---
If one want to log in and travel a few jumps for PVP, and whatever group they're in doesn't allow for this due to whatever muculent political situation their org has excreted from their logorrheic diplomat cloacas, than exercise some goddamn agency and **leave.** We like to joke about eve organizations being autocracies, but every eve corp or alliance is inherently democratic in that *any member can just up and leave whenever the fuck they want.*
---
I have seen the game more polarised in my playtime tbh. What's new is the lower player count and everyone have hundreds of titans.
---
try 16 or so years of playing eve non stop:)
---
That statement is almost entirely meaningless. WoW has always had a larger userbase than EVE, the fact that more people play the classic version than play EVE is neither surprising nor significant. If anything it would be extraordinary if the opposite were true.
---
Eh ..... yeah......
---
This is not how corp funds must be used ??? Are you telling me how to do my job:O
---
You didnt however say no to the intimacy part. Carefully optimistic about this:)
---
Pretty new player here. I carebreared for my first 7 mill skill points in highsec. Now I'm at 10 mill in a null corp fighting against goons.
---
There is no reason for me as a new player to log in if I am not in highsec. The only thing I am when I log in, is content for hunters. Ratting and mining are WAY WAY to dangerous to actually make isk. Full Stop. New players outside of highsec don't make it isk. All the people benifitting from these "Isk fountains" are/were people mining or ratting in Rorqs or supers. If you can't do that, you aren't making isk. Seriously, I use heatmaps and rat in systems far from our staging area, with almost no traffic and I still got caught by a loki goon fleet who just HAPPENED to be roaming at a dead end corner of our space. I may be new and not have tons of skill points, but I can d scan, align to gates and watch intel channels and it won't matter, not one bit. Cloaked fleets are now just constantly roaming and devouring new players.
---
 Veteran players who for some reason did not have a vast fortune or a rorq/super when the blackout happened started explo in crazy expensive astero's. This left explo useless as most sites are now completely looted or filled with mobs because someone has already been there and started the spawn timer. If I do happen to find a site that isn't filled with sleepers or something, most of the nodes contain junk because someone has already been there and scanned and took anything above 2 mill isk.
---
That leaves the only content for me to be in fleets. Except I can't afford to blow up ships all the time. Which means I'm completely reliant on the corp to give me fleet ships. Also low skill point players just get stuck in a tackle frigate and blown up basically every single engagement. Oh and while I'm on the subject I'm fucking sick of frigates and cruisers, no one and I mean NO ONE flies anything bigger so even when I am in a successful fleet and I don't get erased five seconds into combat, I'm still just blowing up the same ships over and over again. 
---
I have no reason to log in really. I want to be able to do things, I want to make isk, I want to contribute to my corp, I want to fly a battleship. I want to build a big ship with stuff I mined. I want to run supplies for my friends. I want to fly in fleets in formations and have clear engagements, not just a bunch of cruisers playing tag until someone screws up.
---
But I'm realizing that ccp doesn't want me to do any of those things. They just want my butt in a ship so someone can blow me up for content. So I've just kind of stopped logging in lately, because I have no reason too. Why log on just to spin my camera around my ship?
---
We just need to have shitty memes and propaganda allowed on this sub. 
---
Right now those get moderated away while bad takes on game design and pure whinging are allowed through without issue.
---
That’s the plan
---
You can't have your stuff jump freighted out if you're away from the game.
---
There are more people in wow classic than ever played vanilla wow...
---
Sure, but the comment i was replying to was acting like somehow pearl abyss would change everything as soon as they find out because they had no clue what CCP is doing, which is just false.
---
This is a question best suited to our [No question is too stupid thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d37m1w/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread/)
---
I'm considering buying a Chimera to rat in wormholes. Just fly what's fun, don't worry about your IPH. At the end of the day, EVE's just a game.
---
The fuck kind of deal could we have cut that would have been more enticing than literally infinite unassailable casino money?
---
nerfs for thee but not for me
---
Strip miner I - only needs Mining IV, which I think is what Alphas can have.
---
&gt; GOONS even SRPd the lost legacy Titans
---
really??
---
don't worry about isk
---
just have fun in the game
---
Missed Option: He's too busy re-reading Olmecca Gold Classic(TM) posts from before blackout
---
and during that you end up not making any isk  bad guys don't fight and kite around then it is to go to bed.
---
Literally everyone.
---
ok your a lot more lucky than I am because the hunters almost universally warp out as soon as defenders show up on grid.
---
Thats why i never take the HED-GP gate
---
Not sure about your post, but it's really easy to see npc kill numbers, go to system, find carrier, drop covert cyno, kill asap and bugger off. I've seen waaay to many carriers die before fax can even jump in and that was before the cyno change. Why is someone going to krab in carrier if it's going to cost them more then they can make? Surely you're not asking people to feed because you said so.
---
that, plus maybe now scrubs will visit us and bring us spoonfed content. All I see is win \\o/
---
Once I start FW I'll be committed to 2 factions forever right?
---
What are the consequences of that gameplay wise?
---
You argue that WHs have the best isk in game, without the risk...
---
*You mean someone big and better than you rolling in to your system is no risk? [That's how the Vehement died.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77855451/). 
---
*Do you mean that no local means no risk? Then what is nullsec complaining about? 
---
*Does getting all the payout in an item that has to be hauled to an NPC station to get the isk, and maybe ganked/killed mean no risk? It's not safely deposited straight in to my wallet like nullsec.
---
*Does the idea of your citadel dying and you losing everything sound like no risk? Let do it for nullsec and lowsec. It's risk free after all!
---
Notice that all the risk comes from players. It the players won't do anything with the amount of risk that far exceeds that of nullsec, then there is nothing CCP can do about it. What changes could increase the risk?
---
Here's an example: Local was a free and perfect intel device. It allowed ratters and bots to do nothing and have perfect safety. It far too powerful and unbalanced. There was no counter play. There was nothing anyone could do to beat it. Removing it did increase the risk. And all nullsec had to do was do something about it. Form up defense fleets. Gate camp. Rat in groups. etc. Instead of adapting, they complained on r/eve. Sounds just fine to me. I'll keep killing your ratters until you learn.
---
your not accounting for the difference between current times and pre fax capital nerfs.    
---
Actually people on the forum were stating super carriers and rorq kills were a non even anymore.
---
This is a much better system than dominion sov. As for satisfaction for trolling and causing grief to the other side so they stop playing the game, and you can forever trolololol, I'm not really sure if that's balanced either.  :)  But sov's the least of EVE's problems at the moment, just lack of players in general is.
---
no you just misread
---
Send 2 bill to Harvey Kanjus and I'll believe you ;thinking;

Hahaha . WTB CAP bpcs

Taste like krab and talk like people.
---
Wtf qlpx isn't even a krab pocket
---
Need to change SOV Null sec better make it so you can't fly ships anymore.
---
I don't really see anyone brigade but null bears and you guys make it obvious like when i go from 4 upvotes to -6 in 3 minutes.
---
Plot twist: Players are the true supervillain
---
Cursing is for ineloquent motherfuckers.
---
I dualbox 2 retributions in T3 electricals, t4s and T5s are possible with bling and triple-boxing
---
The main elephant in the room with wormholes is once the shallow learning curve is plateaued all you need to be safer than null was, is to push the holes to critical and nobody will come through to burn down your farm. Mass regeneration needs to be revamped to make this nearly impossible beyond an established group of friends looking for content.
---
One guy farming billions in safety in one session is not the way the rest of the game works. It's low risk high reward in a place that is supposed to me the most dangerous. So Give pvpers a chance to pvp these holebears equally as we can farm nullbears. It worked in null
---
Only fags care about eloquence.
---
Garst is the leader of my soul, I worry if he ever sounded the horn could I resist.
---
And you sound like a whiny l33t lord.
---
Why? There is no point in even going to war at the moment if "leet" risk adverse bombers  just harrass your home region with zero counterplay available.
---
You can easily do darks with cap stable hawks, very e z to multibox
---
&gt;im sorry, but the 20,000 rorqual players who never undock
---
And this is why I can't take people like you seriously.
---
I literally a krab advocate and i agree that sov warfare is fucking cancer ESPECIALLY with asset safety in null.
---
Asset safety has some merit, especially as long as hunters have lowsec permadocking rights and infinite safety between hunting
---
But asset safety shouldn’t apply to alliance tier strategic assets (titans and supers).  Period.
---
Send any amount and ill triple it ?
---
Mr. Fry would disagree https://youtu.be/7raS7hmLkAA
---
the salt will flow if they do
---
well played.
---
CCP falcons Reddit alt confirmed.
---
&gt; I just feels gimmicky.
---
It's definitely a gimmick. It's only a problem gimmick because you can't look at a gate and see if it's unlocked, which is a problem that all of eve has. 
---
I would love a QOL improvement where the icon for a gate changes based on whether or not you can take the gate.
---
Quite right sir, quite right. Good show i say!
---
you should offer CCP some cream for that burn
---
eve is  butterfly effect.....you kill mining barge in nullsec,you never know if this in future lead victim alliance to be defeated...you save the mining barge from pirates and pvpers and you will be granted tons of minerals,and eventually some ready products.. now you dont know if saved mining barge later  cause your alliance to lose war..  eve is very cimplicated and precise mechanism and if something fails  it turns domino effect on.
---
I think isk making can be a trap that certain new players fall into. They believe in order to have fun they need more than they actually do. The worst path you can take in eve is to grind hard for money before you understand things and then lose it to someone else. I feel that has resulted in a lot of newer people unsubbing over the years.
---
When I watch new players start getting into the game they love scoring some isk, and that's a good thing but what really lights them up and brings them into the game forever is when they have a haphazard story about something that went right for them. 
---
For example new guys doing exploration stuff being chased by someone while they have 30 mill in loot in their cargo and managing to escape back to highsec and sell it. Sure as you get more experienced you know how to do more things safely and 30 mill means nothing to you but that doesn't matter because the part that's really missing is the adventure that you once had just getting by.
---
 "the number of shitposts Olmeca has made on reddit (an "Olmeca Shitpost" being defined as "any post Olmeca makes on reddit")"  
---
Finally someone said it.
---
You guys sure do spend a lot of time bitching and whining not to care, or are you still just salty over the null changes? I'm glad you're enjoying no local and Cyno changes so much. I know I am
---
Who'd have thought that CCP's email system would be worse than Hadean's?
---
Those are for the old system of structures known as Player Owned Starbases (POS). The new system uses structures called citadels. You would find a moon in 0.5 space or below and anchor an athanor on it to mine it.
---
More here: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Moon_mining
---
Honestly I'd prefer to see a total rework of null anoms that would include a nice payout increase like you said, but cause them to spawn more like exploration sites so people have to actually travel to find them.
---
Sure it happens. But how often?
---
No who said that?
---
Which from what I understand isnt actually a real risk right? Again, perceived risk isnt actual risk.
---
Nobody is forcing you to live there right? Which is the kicker here. You knew what you were getting into. Our rules changed midway. 
---
I dont know. Which is why nerfs are discussed right?
---
No it wasnt. You keep chanting that but it wasnt. Perfect means something other than what local was. Yet again, not fking true. Shit died in way much velocity than in WHs. 
---
No counter play? So why did shit die? You cant have it both ways. Stop with the fking narrative and pull your head out of your ass. Talk real now. There are thousands of pages on zkill saying you are talking shit right now. However, there is no counter play atm. And this is not your perceived lack of counter play, this is we cant see what we cant see and there are fucking cynos with 256 man fleets waiting on the other end. Dont talk shit because your head is on the chopping block. Take the nerfs like you wanted us to take.
---
No its fking not. Ye kicking over sandcastles is exactly what CCP has been trying to do with your cheers. We are just asking them to do the same for you. But strangely enough hypocrisy is a thing amongst humans.
---
Not how the titan meta works.
---
I just dont like cunts and bitches that cry for years to get daddy to change things they couldnt handle themselves. Also dont like hypocrites who in reality are just a bunch of risk averse pussies who clame others are.
---
You know:)
---
Right.. And Eve is? if it wasn't for the community, the game itself, is a broken mess worst then vanilla wow.
---
This supposed null absolute safety exist only for supers, titans and rorquals, and even with cap umbrellas a lot of them died. 
---
People always died in ratting or minigg subcaps in null, there was always a serious risk of losing your VNI or Ishtar or Domi or Rattlesnake. 
---
Now ratting in a subcap means being ganked for sure, it's not a risk, it's guaranteed you'll lose your ship, and for what? 15/20M ticks?
---
Is this the supposed safety and high reward of nullsec?
---
The only victims of blackout are newbies and subcap pilots, bots are still running.
---
You may argue that I should rat in super so I'll be safe, and that's the main problem regarding cap proliferation and umbrellas, and as I said that's a problem caused by injectors.
---
and who pushed goons and tapi towards each other in the first place? hmmmmm
---
Could you explain further ? I have no idea what you're talking about lol
---
Combat sites in null are way easier than combat sites in wormholes. Try AFKing a VNI in a wormhole combat site and see how quick you get blapped. The risk isn't just from players in wormhole sites. They are way more skill intensive and require more expensive ships and fits.
---
Hi Lorenzo
---
So when I read that I imagine this is what's talking:
---
 [https://www.amazon.com/TeeTurtle-Reversible-Octopus-Mini-Plush/dp/B07H4K9XYS?ref\_=ast\_sto\_dp&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/TeeTurtle-Reversible-Octopus-Mini-Plush/dp/B07H4K9XYS?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1) 
---
So very unhappy, and yet so snuggly.
---
A super villain would be awesome.
---
it was a simple joke because eve is written in stackless python, thats all
---
Did goons breach their agreement with test with the cap drop killing those Titans? If not I am sure we will see plenty more goon cap drops in test space...
---
As we both know it was a violation of the agreement not to drop caps they only other conclusion is that you are either lying or goons are further violating the agreement by not paying compensation.... Either way the point remains the same 70% of the game is trying their best to reduce the content to nothing to safely krab.
---
I'm your villian apparently, every time I kill that shitfit stabber of yours you bounty me. I think you lost an orca too and bountied my corp. Message me if you ever want help with those fits. I'll keep killing you but you might learn something if you ask for help from the dudes who killed you instead of just bountying and ejecting and shitposting on reddit.
---
&gt; Example 5: GOONS even SRPd the lost legacy Titans 
---
do you have any source for this ?
---
&gt; And GOONS are not allowed to hit TAPI space anymore after Legacy losing the Titans. 
---
doesnt mean we cant shoot them though, which we often do. test also often shoot us
---
Capitals and supercapitals were not always valid methods of solo play because of their astronomical cost. This statement is not mythical, magical, or untrue.
---
They're essentially disposable now. CCP should not have allowed the game to get to this point. Capitals and supercapitals *should* require support, not necessarily to move them around, but to generate the ISK and infrastructure required to build/purchase one. 
---
Interpret that how you will. It's a bit ridiculous that players can (or could a few weeks ago) grind out the ISK for supercapital *fleets* in near-total safety while AFK.
---
Wow. Kill one dude or pay him 2b to leave...
---
It's spelled "claim" not "clame" for starters. 
---
I'm not really sure what you're trying to get out with the rest of your post. The risk averse pussies are the ones that need an intel tool to alert them that there are bad guys 10 jumps out so they can dock up. I'm not sure how putting a ship in space and engaging in PvP is considered risk averse. To each their own though
---
You know ;-)
---
I think the problem is not the polarisation but the scale of it. One side is just simply too big, like Serenity.
---
**Link lossmail**
---
gosh damn those bastards are killing the people who hinder my isk making, those bastards
---
I hear  Alekseyev Karrde is a super duper villain.
---
Spoken as a true lowsec pirate.
---
get me a better one then :P
---
The funny thing is, CCP didn't do anything to address why these groups are able to do this. If you starve a large alliance for content, then they will have to deal with stagnation and internal rot as all their decent FCs leave for more interesting places, and all their mid-to-high tier PvPers leave to other organizations. But the blackout and cyno changes don't nerf long-range force projection and content generation, they just hurt local defensive tools. In order to make Goons and TEST reconsider bluing every region within 30 jumps of their space, you need to:
---
1. Nerf jump bridges that allow multiple disparate stagings to be too convenient for an alliance
---
2. Cut down on the drifter wormholes that allow FCs in large blocks to reliably generate content from their own staging with little to no effort
---
3. Improve the process for clearing out unused sov and structures, by expanding the time windows for ADM 2.0 and below space and allowing low power structures to at a minimum be killed in other timezones, even if they still get reinforced to the day of the defender's choosing.
---
These will let small groups start picking away at the borders of these groups, and make cross-map long term deployments a risky venture if you want to also maintain a super or capital umbrella at home.
---
We don't have some coward ass "no killing each others supers or rorquals deal" people that have those are weak. We don't have any of that shit. We might not want to target test people while they are at war with FRT as a guideline for our FCs but we don't ban that stuff.
---
I'd really like to see the no dropping caps thing you claim to have. [because i dont see anything](https://i.imgur.com/3bWsLlY.png)

I'm reading this right from the shitter!

You and Lady Scarlett would be excellent grammar villains.

Weeeeewwww someone doesn’t work well online.

BURN!!!
---
It's been dying for years.
---
That doesn't mean it's going to die tomorrow but the game has been on a track of managed decline. It's not unique to EvE, WoW has also been on the same path for several expansions.
---
Stop growing, start dying.
---
Yeah, I think you just misunderstood.
---
i dont hate on miners i need them that doesent mean i want to do it fyi i allways tell them how much i love them with my rockets when i can catch them in low

Dude people are actively trying to help you. You complain about pessimistic bastards who harvest newbro brains but we're trying to get you up to big brain status friendo.
---
Then your company, clearly, has nothing much to do with subsidiaries that suck eh?

Goons dreadbomb Eso often, in fact.  Its good content.

No one hates you, it’s just your easy to debunk and entertaining to prove wrong because of the flailing you do afterwards.
---
&gt;Well, then everyone whose not an inflated alliance can then go build their empire. This isn't the end of eve, just of a certain player base.
---
You are kidding?!
---
Once you've managed to get rid of all the PVE'ers currently, then people can go and PVE and empire build?! You are insane.
---
That’s unfortunate to discover. But, I ask, can you successfully compete against a good multiplayer fleet if you are multiboxing Incursions?
---
i got to be honest i am very happy my corp is a pure pvp corp and baby siting is not a thing i have to do
---
Weaponized CSM Xenuria rev 2
---
Cuntaliscious
---
I think its less black and white than this. The recent changes have been terrible for the game. After years of catering to empire building, bad decisions and implementations and essentially cap proliferation, CCP pulled the rug from under those they have given a wide berth. Now, rather than gradual changes a'la boiling a frog style, they basically threw hot water at the frog and expected it not to panic. That aint how things work around here.
---
"Reee certian players looked at the tools they were given, used them optimally, and beat me at the game even though I'm trying to put this nail through a board with my skull instead of a hammer like TAIPerium!"

I didn't invalidate your playstyle buddy.  I didn't ask for it to be invalidate it either.

I have a T2 BPO and am farming quite comfortably in a wormhole. Im fine thanks.

Its a metagame trick so they can say people are logging in.

But today is nit that day!

I need to get my crane out of that keepstar.

How the hell was removing local a change we needed? Adding a mechanic for null-empires to control local may have been interesting. A 30s faze timer that enabled people to not be seen in local, but give sov holders the ability to upgrade the system at a detriment to cost or some such. Point is, this clusterfuck of blackout is exactly that, a clusterfuck with no counter play, hence the severe drop in people doing anything in nullsec anymore.
---
Then send a fit in a pm, or a corp invite lol. The way you help people isn't helping people.  It's insulting lol. You can't tell someone to ask for help and then expect them too. IDGAF how shitty my fit is, I'll die a thousand until I can learn something better or skill up. 
---
Feeding on newbro brains to get them to learn? Sounds like contradictory.
---
It costs too much to rent that IBM quant computer
---

Wars are and will be boring until Fozzie sov and citadels are fixed. That must be abundantly clear now.

Also note, I am in a wormhole, I am fine, I don't need to adapt to nullsec changes, however, I can see what this shit is doing to the game.
---
He really checks all the boxes for “dumb as fuck”, doesn’t he.
---
Yeah because it's risky, if the payouts were better for the risk to be worth it, it would be better. I don't like the idea of just making it not possible to eat in a super.
---
If someone wants to risk their super to eat for higher ticks to should be possible.
---
Weaponized data analysis
---
that one had the noob guns on it and it didnt do 200 dps it might do 20

Not really like if it gets contested your fucked, and with the reduced spawns it's not all that viable anymore to be fair.

Fossiesov Is so unfun and I think that's the point

Change my mind that you are a good poster and your low effort post should stay up

No

you mean Hilmar?

Why are Imperium and associated allies like Legacy etc always mad at Olmeca?
---
Everyone dies in eve man. If we just let the newbros wander around and not fight them, how're they going to learn? Thought I said something to you in local, but I'll mail you some fits when I get home from work.
---
(Looks at OP’s username)  
---
Not people.  
---
You.
---
If sov was more enjoyable and less aids more conflict would happen.
---
I actually enjoyed and appreciated the writeup. I did however wrankle a bit at the need to go out for a beer and dinner with people to develop trust. 
---
I have nothing against this happening, it's good that people can mix (unpaid!) work and pleasure, but it did feel a lot like spin to read that you felt it was important.
---
(talking to everyone).
---
(Just talking)
---
Are you talking to me?
---
You mean like the 20 others like it today did?
---
Come at me bro
---
I'll leave your system for 1bil  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
you clearly didnt experience the wars Cymek made propaganda for
---
If I did that, it wouldn’t be dying anymore.  That’s no fun.
---
This is an issue many eve players have. If people stopped caring so much about their killboard and pixels there would be more explosions and more fun
---
The good old days
---
Yeah!  That's why nobody every shot conquerable stations or outposts!
---
Oh wait...
---
the salt flows
---
I heard mitanni actually srpd it out of his own pocket
---
It's working
---
I mean sorta like the change "opens on both ends" would imply on anom spawn, but even on warp that gives like 3 seconds notice before anything can arrive ( you warp costs you a tick declaration costs a tick and then jumping costs a tick ).
---
like all it would take to prevent that is make it 1 minute delayed ( given it's an existing feature it shouldn't be that hard to up RNG to 100% after a minute and 0 before that ).
---
The backstop solution is less reliable the rolled holes granted but really your big treat isn't really in your chain its people rolling into you or your chain.
---
Like personally I would love a mechanism that rewards people for not doing roll all but the static before running sites. ( with something like that in place you could reduce base pay even and make the didn't roll all the holes bonus make the sites equal to current pay ). 
---
Like running in holes with multiple (known) k162's isn't totally suicide right now but it's more risk then you need to take if people get rewarded for it you would likely see more groups taking that risk means more nestors tackled means more people escalating ontop of nestors/leshaks/dreads means more fights means we all enjoy space more.
---
No...
---
he actually drove to vily's house and srped it with milky way bars then spent the night
---
:)
---
Not that I like the entire thing. I hate nerfs and just because one thing got broken doesnt mean others things should get broken.
---
&gt;It was functionally lost. You might be able to firesell it for a massive loss,
---
Nope.  You'd lose about 10-20%.
---
You could also easily get it out via courier contract.  The new owners are gonna have logistics, and they'd rather head towards Jita with something in their hold.  You'd have to wait about a week or two for the area around the station to calm down enough for the winner to start running regular freight.
---
Were deployed mate.
---
  And fighting cloaky nano kitey bullshit isn't fun.
---
I definitely agree with most of what you just wrote, and I don't actually advocate making mining or ratting safer (my EN24 articles are very pro-blackout and despite seeing the other side I still like the change for the most part), what I advocate moreso is a) counterplay for cloaky camping which is far more powerful now than it was before; and b) rewards which match the level of risk, especially for subcap ratters and miners.
---
The biggest issue I have is that nullsec is balanced around ratting in supers and mining in Rorquals, which is probably a part of the reason Eve has horrible new player retention. Rebalancing it around subcapital ratting and mining would mean more people out for hunters to hunt, and more reward for ratters &amp; miners who take reasonable precautions and play smart. I don't see how that's bad for anyone except capital PvEers.
---
Pog
---
&gt; This supposed null absolute safety exist only for supers, titans and rorquals, 
---
Lol, so you mean the very ships that allow people to farm injectors like a crazy person.
---
I dont think it would work honestly. The issues are far greater at this point. Like if I want to be in a place where local doesnt matter Ill move to HS and be content for CODE. But I dont live in NS to be anyones content and short of buffing things multiple times over I wouldnt do it. Cause right now you dont have a counter against tackling and you dont have a counter against the fleet that is coming to kill you.
---
Your war is with WC, the others come to even the numbers otherwise tapi blobs out the sun.
---
I’ve only ever been in corps where there were no blues as a rule. Maximum targets. 
---
I think this is a great idea - would mean players have to get to know each other and communicate in order to work together. A massive grid where everyone is ‘neutral’ would be to difficult to maintain a massive amounts of blues. Yes they could be in the same fleet but different alliances all using one standing fleet? I don’t think so !
---
&gt; Why is someone going to krab in carrier if it's going to cost them more then they can make? Surely you're not asking people to feed because you said so.
---
you see, you inject just a LITTLE risk and suddenly its like OH THEY'RE ASKING US TO FEED NOW.
---
What a bitch.
---
&gt;Since I'm the one that wrote the report, I'll reply
---
I was gonna say, when I saw this post I looked for the summit notes minutes and couldn't find any.
---
&gt;...yikes, your reading comprehension is bad.  
---
&gt;"Don't affect that much" does not mean "Don't affect anything".
---
Both of us have issue understanding the other. Don't affect that much read as "who cares anyway", which is completely not the same.
---
But I got your point at first, I was just demonstrating that even if you think it isn't much isn't, it actually is for most people.
---
&gt; The only other thing that really relies on cynos and is meaningfully affected is the ability to instantly call a defensive fleet to your inattentive ass when you get caught by the enemy. Which is a pretty good change. 
---
That, which is fine and not fine depending on the case, and the ability to have a supercapital engagement.
---
&gt; I do agree (at least I think you probably share this view) that this may put cloaky ships and covert cynos as being too powerful, and I'm not sure the best way to change this without entirely gutting the playstyle completely. 
---
Without nerfing the cloak itself and moving the cyno to only blops and recons (lol), you cannot really nerf it, and doing so would literally destroy it, yes.
---
If you don’t know who the friendlies are by name you aren’t really friends are you
---
Primarily because they *should* be designed to apply well to, and to kill, other capital ships rather than rats in destroyers and cruisers. I'm all for dropping your super on a dread spawn, but imo it shouldn't be the optimal choice for clearing a battleship spawn.
---
The villian you deserve, not the one you need.
---
Or just let test fight their own war that they started.
---
&gt;You couldn't get your shit back for 500m for the entire corp in the past
---
Yeah, it cost way, way less than that.
---
What, did you think the new station owners wouldn't regularly be hauling freight from Jita?  And those pilots would really, really prefer something in their hold going the other way.
---
&gt;Implementing short term solutions to problems does not negate the development of longer term changes to the game
---
Please point to anything in CCP's history that demonstrates any sort of long-term plan behind short-term changes.
---
There's more activity post black out in wormholes I think. It certainly seems more busy than it was when I quit four years ago. I could be full of shit though lol
---
Of course, it makes hunting easy even for the dumbest hunters.
---
I thought all the rookie ships actually got buffed sometime recently(ish) so they may have been much weaker in 2014 if it was before that
---
Dude, did you really think that comment all the way through?
---
&gt;Nullsec, before citadel spam, had lots of suitecase POS
---
Not really.  They existed, but they were not all that common.  POSes were too much of a pain-in-the-ass to set up, and we couldn't just park ourselves in one system to rat/mine to justify setting them up.
---
Oh nooo! Im broken. Someone corrected my fifth language?
---
Na its you guys. Biggest cunts in the game quite frankly. "Engaging in PvP" luuuulliiilul. "I use cloaky ships cause I want fight, see I only go after PvE targets so you show up so we can fight but I cloak and run off".
---
Luuuuuuliiiluuul:)
---
Hey, dumbass, FRT is literally right next door to TEST.
---
Understanding that it might be perceived as easy against an unaware and isolated target, it isn’t actually that easy. The simplest counter measures can make a cloaky hunter’s efforts in vain.
---
As a hunter, I have to get my tackle pilot into position to hold tackle and survive long enough to get my Black Ops into place.  Then get the kill. The target can avoid death in any number of ways. He can manually pilot his ship in an unpredictable manner. He can fit his ship to move far faster than my cloaky hunter pilot. He can stay close to large collidable objects, which may decloak my hunter prematurely. He can warp at unpredictable distances to sites. He can switch up the sites he runs. He can avoid setting stupidly predictable patterns. He can bring his own cloaky alt. He can fit for PvP instead of max ticks. The fact that many players refuse to take even the most minor efforts to make themselves hard targets does not justify making it impossible to hit drop on players by fencing PVE off behind jump gates or in dead space where no cynos are allowed.
---
Idgaf
---
Ye the FoF missiles that shoot how many hundred kilometres now are so hard. Or the luring of drifters to asshouses to kill them. 
---
Get fking real.
---
Scarlet is a 4 minute mission that gives 30 mil. Why skip? it's pretty much a burner
---
Shocker.
---
Aren't you in a coalition that noped the fuck out to losec and then logged off to play WoW the moment your space was attacked?
---
And somehow everything is the fault of the alliance that actually launched the invasion?
---
That had to be one of the most cancerous ways to run sites. Only Russians really did that. It's not an issue anymore so you lost your point there. 
---
Farming Drifters with Astras is shit as well. I'm not disagreeing there. Drifter is optional and triggered at the end of the site. You have to get to the end of the site first though. 
---
I like how you tried to cherry-pick that though as if those are the only 2 mechanics involved in site running.
---
Unfortunately it wasn't. I read into it, a lady died when the entire apartment building went up in flames because of that guy &gt;.&lt;
---
Memes are automatically removed.  Please submit to /r/evememes instead.

Ok, I have some thoughts
---
Imperium Regions are down in bounties from 10T to 6T
---
Panfam are down from 2.6T to 1.1T 
---
Legacy are down from 7.4 to 2.2 
---
NPC Null is down from 2T to 600B
---
The last time this happened, we were in 10mn gilas and you formed about 5 times the numbers of munins.  None of our ships had MWDs or cloaks.  Don't let facts get in the way of your narrative though...
---
Shouldn't be. I care about as much for your opinion as you do mine.
---
molded by it too
---
Isn't that why CFC rebranded to Imperium? 
---
I figured they wanted to play bad guys.
---
&gt; I want to add to this that in my time on the CSM, the most important  things the CSM has done are the things you will never know about. 
---
/thread
---
Seeing logibro comment on that post hurts my soul ):
---
Someone's got a bad case of the REEEEEEEEEEEs
---
Tbf frat was letting aom live next door and yet all aom did was help legacy, why would frat keep them not reset them.
---
very nice
---
But none of those things have been changed have they? The only thing that changed with the cyno changes is precisely the movement aspect correct?
---
Do you see the issue here?
---
So people grinding for a shitlong time to get a ship is bad now? I mean I dont get your point. Isnt grinding literally what everyone else does to get ships? Whats the problem here? And if you have an issue with people being AFK then change that aspect? Like what?
---
Building supercapitals do require support. They for one require a superumbrella costing trillions of isk and thousands of manhours/day to uphold. They require holding SOV which means massive amounts of the same things. They require miners to churn out ore/minerals. They require expensive structures with 50b isk rigs (t1 and 1 alone costs that much).
---
I dont really get your complaint here. Is this the best you can provide? Not to be that guy but you clearly dont understand what it takes for supers to get built. They are not magical creatures that appear whenever we feel like it.
---
But I do agree that we have too many of them. And my biggest complaint for years (and many in NS) has been how stupidly broken the Rorq is. But this hasnt changed. Its still broken you understand? Why do you think we are saying that these changes are shit, revert them and put some real effort into real changes?
---
People keep acting like NS are a bunch of cunts who want to be OP and its honestly projection. We are OP enough simply due to our size. We want content and balance and we see firsthand what is actually broken, why the CSM consisting of mainly NS people argued against the Rorqual. And we are the ones suffering the worst in this Rorqual meta cause we are stuck in a cold war against all other groups. If we stop then our neighbour will have a bigger superfleet and we can lose our sov. Its such a shitty meta and I have been hoping for it to end for yeeeeeeeeeears.
---
So no, cyno changes only affect one aspect and thats the actual movement and not the support part. There were no issues with caps/supercaps before all the nerfs hit them cause now theyre actually quite shit. 
---
The issue was always in the mineral faucet and thats the only way you can fix this. Nothing else.
---
&gt;milky way bars

No kirkland protein bars? Fucking traitor!

Na shocker that your attitude is exactly what people imagined it to be before downvoting you.
---
That’s good to hear.
---
https://i.imgur.com/sWQUlqY.jpg
---
Yep, that's correct.
---
The problem is, those problems apply just as fully to non-botting ratters and miners, too (not that they matter in the case of a Rorq under an umbrella).
---
It's great that the blackout is hurting bots, but it's hurting legitimate players who mine and rat even more so (again, other than Rorqs with umbrella protection).
---
They do Not posses the creativity to be villians. Just another annoyance, so they've really just become like OP rats in high sec, at least.
---
Or more so a toddler on a bath, not trying to make waves but splashing around all the same.
---
I don't get it. In this comment you defend your right to be part of a large coalition but just up there you complain about how far you had to go to find a fight.
---
Sure, be part of a large coalition. The cost is that you have fewer people to shoot.
---
Finally now you are posting things I can agree with again
---
&gt;The one competent leader in that entire coalition is Garst Tyrell

lmao garst

Looks like you are talking to Valkorsia lol
---
Goons cant go to Legacy space anymore? My alt's killboard says otherwise
---
Nah you can read my comment history. You're not entitled to having an explanation spoonfed to you either.
---
How many years was it in play again?:)
---
Hey you were the one who are talking about how hard it is right, and how risky it is? Like AFK VNIs are such an optimal way of making isk. Wtf.
---
And AFK VNIs arent a thing anymore either so why did you present that? They were gone before the FoF so its cool for you to bring up an obsolete case but I cant?
---
I'm an explorer the only thing I hunt is adventure!
---
Maybe true, but we wormholers also kitchen-sink the fuck out of things because of unpredictability.  Certain fits aren't recommended, but we get to play around a lot with bait-tanking and off-the-wall tactics.
---
If you are not minmaxing you are just roleplaying, which is also totally fine and you should have fun with that
---
Also in Chicago. It exists.
---
I'm gonna multibox the shit out of this isk making scheme.

Yeah you can read.  Garst. The rest of you should take notes.

What part of - don't use any capital letters dont you understand?
---
There are two separate fighterbombers for each situation

One for capital sized targets one for subcapital sized.

Do you think a nimitz only is equipped to destroy battleships and other carriers? Or is it equipped with the full range of aircraft to fight all likely targets???

And if you have been paying attention that's where the pain in this change comes in, for the person creating the content.
---
Lol you just sit and wait for a moment dont you. Its a joke, its in the forward staging system of TAPI....
---
That 3rd noob is looking from that background abyss cloud right?
---
Do you think without killboards, I would undock a fleet to feed it into 10-1 odds? I still would not. At that point the troll is so high that denying content to enemy line members and their batphones is the more effective strategy.
---
So did you leave?
---
Sample size too small.
---
Saw my first proving conduit in months last night... assumed it was a bug.
---
Goon member here: I want the same!

Lol, you play disc golf LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL and you call me dumb as fuck
---
&gt;by School Starting back up,
---
The last time CCP released a median age on players in the game it was over 30 years old, so we can please just stop using the "back to school" excuse?
---
Damn, that would be nice. You should post it on the forums/suggestion thing.
---
yeah i know, i was trying to explain that a medium cap booster with 800's is fine as long as you inject correctly.
---
What does this one offer zkill doesn't.
---
Implying I krab.
---
You get flair baited in 2019.
---
Imagine trying to shame someone for throwing frisbees 400+ feet and getting a workout daily while you watch anime and play spaceships. 😂
---
Your spreadsheet shows the same as Olmeca states (a reduction in the share of 'notable nullsec'), until you add in the completely subjective 'analysis' of what you think are locust fleets for the 'notable post-blackout' value, without adding any guesses for a proportion of mining done by locust fleets pre-blackout into the 'notable pre-blackout' value.
---
Nothing, infact most of the pages on it don't work yet - simply because i havn't gotten around to creating them :D
---
It's a side project that i work on from time to time, but it's just gotten to a point where it's functional enough for everyone else to see it, and who knows - maybe getting feedback will encourage me to do more.
---
I think it is certainly busier !
---
There is a second can far away near the Leshaks, usually has even better loot in it.
---
My point being why are you blue with people when 95% of the time you have no idea who they are. You could kill them instead and have more fun
---
&gt; This isn't the end of eve, just *the* player base.
---
Maria, I’ve found the joke
---
Hilmar plays in WH space, he doesn't want to actually have to deal with "Chaos" so he keeps it out of his personal part of the sand box while shoving everyone else's face in it.
---
10-1 odds - skirmish have raids move around target new places. You don’t always have to go all in or not at all
---
could this be the work of ccp-round?
---
&gt;We need new blood in the game anyway
---
They've been trying for  the last 6 years to get new blood into this game and they are failing miserably, for every 2,000-3,000 thousand they lose every 3 months they gain about 200. That's not a sustainable rate if you plan on driving out most of the current player base.
---
So salty man:)
---
I dunno why I enjoy messing with you haha. Fk Im bored, see this is what happens when you remove a hobby from morons like me. Our brains cant handle it.
---
&gt; People enjoy different things, 
---
Friend of mine who was dipping his toe into Eve used to be big into WOW so he was excited about this new Classic nostaglia thing. As expected of course.
---
I read this article, assuming it was some in joke WOW-Onion style thing about players forming queues in game to farm NPCs. I mention it to him, expecting just a laugh, and he starts seriously trying to tell me how "Kill stealing used to be a real problem, at one point they even started banning people for it"
---
... kill....stealing..... banning people..... real....problem.....???
---
I don't know if Tau even has a reddit account, and Hy doesn't troll very often.
---
I don’t personally do them so I don’t know that much about them. You can read [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Abyssal_Deadspace) everything about abyssal filaments. The “abyssal deadspace co-op for frigate fleets” is specifically what I am talking about, however, if you are going to do them you will want to read most everything else on the page.
---
&gt; otherwise how do you explain this massive player drop?
---
A lot of it actually is bots - did you not see all the posts pre-blackout complaining about whole regions full of bots? And when it's players, it's people quitting because they can't farm in perfect safety.
---
You claim that you aren't one of those people, and indeed that it's just 'reddit shitpost narrative'. So why aren't you playing any more when the only thing that's changed is your perfect safety?
---
**S I L E N C E , K R A B**
---
&gt;Cloaked fleets are now just constantly roaming and devouring new players.
---
Who knew that making it impossible to see a fleet coming that can use cyno's that are essentialy invisible would make it impossible to defend in any way against them? Oh wait pretty much everyone who said these new changes are shit. Sorry you joined just as the company sent the game into a death spiral. It really was a nice game for awhile.
---
Lol imagine bragging about throwing a frisbee 400+ feet LOL. I win, you actually responded
---
We aren't mad at him. We just like teasing him because we're secretly in love with him.
---
Failing to backstop a high class wormhole is pretty hard let's be realistic, as long as the colour on your overview heavily pops out and you use an overlay or second monitor you'd have to make a pretty big mistake.
---
This money is better spent on me than donating to your mom's house, dude.
---
This is peak min-maxing.
---
Me too!
---
Shucks
---
Tau likely not, but i definetly see Hy here and there. Or maybe it's just selective perception because hes a well known name. And then theres at least one ceo of a certain ex PL corp. Never really cared about your leadership structure tho so idk how much weight that position really holds in the alliance.
---
That's such a dick move lmao
---
we have even numbers WITH test showing up.

They re-worked the NPE what 5 times now? And they still can't keep \~90% of new players who join past 3 months, yet they seem to think the answer is to re-model the same system again and see if it works. CCP at least at the upper levels really does seem to have lost their mind, because they continually repeat the exact same mistakes time and time again, and every time it backfires they managed to be completely shocked that it didn't go the way they thought it would. I'm just waiting on the project Nova canccelation announcement so we can once again watch Hilmar and his cronies admit they are shocked that another of their development titles has failed.
---
He won't disclose what happened that night though
---
Ahahaha. No. There was no deal. Just incompetence.
---
Huh
---
Take notes on how to go afk and have your alliance run by other people? Theres a reason TRI are on their like 7th iteration now lmao.
---
"CCP make a change I don't like so they must be ~bunker mentality~ because no-one could possibly have a different perspective to me"
---
&gt; the notion of "Create your own empire" has never seemed so bleak and pointless
---
What, because the people in your 'empire' have to actually communicate to guarantee safety now?
---
The gist is that, for me, the time gates imposed by the skill system are discouraging.  I don't want instant gratification, but there are a lot of little bonuses I'm missing that, together, add up to a significant difference between me and the people I end up facing in PvP, and it takes several months of training (waiting) to close those gaps.  I know about the 80/20 rule, but Pyfa confirms missing 20% of the bonus from 10+ skills adds up to a significant disadvantage, and saying "only 3 more months until I can have fun" doesn't encourage me to log on, let alone subscribe.
---
Yea lol, people like to stick with a narrative based on dotlan numbers..
---
YoU hAvE 80 ThoUSanD PlaYers!!1eleven!!11!
---
This is unfortunately what many thought would happen with these changes. People complained about AFK VNIs but they did serve an actual purpose and in the hands of players, not bots, they were still content. Everybody won but now it seems nobody is actually winning. And its really sad cause it will hurt new players much much worse than players like me and we need you guys honestly.
---
I honestly dont know of a way to help you atm but if you feel I can be of service dont hesitate to hit me up ingame. Ill assist in any way I can. 
---
I would however want to direct you towards LS and faction warfare. Atm I belive it to be far superior for newer players than in NS. You can make isk there and even though most there fly the same stuff aswell there is a lot of variation and battleships are still a thing. But I certainly understand if thats not your thing, it isnt for everyone. Otherwise just hold on for a while, hopefully CCP comes to their senses soon.
---
He probably think it was a good thing the game didn't like the changes. I mean wasn't his whole stance on this "chaos" thing that people shouldn't like it and it should stress them out?
---
All capital ships should be repurposed to be fleet support, not solopwnmobiles.
---
Negative quarterly statements are bad, even if they come with more publicity.
---
Eve used to be more populated. That's the point.
---
topkick loves you  (◠‿◠✿)
---
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.

---
Pretty sure entosis just needs a UI.
---
WTB 1 v 100 made me LOL
---
Oh nice, hope this goes well, the more killboards we have the better.
---
Well now you have to change your behaviour to respond to the change, don't you?
---
One could, but when one is given a dev blog and one has JF's, one needs to follow instructions from the game's owners to ensure that ones JF keeps moving.
---
As long as you believe in Topkick you already ha e the max of everything you need
---
I am overwhelmed with information.
---
I fucking love it!
---
Camp stagings. Or maybe camp Tama with the rest of what's left in Eve. Fun times. If CCP wanted to kill small gang content, they did a fine job, although it's not like the pvp'ers here didn't say that's exactly what would happen.
---
Min maxingis allowed
---
Except for pve.
---
If you do that too well it gets nerfed
---
It is indeed very throwback to the EDK era :D
---
i didn't know the term "spoonfed content" covered paying someone 2b to leave you alone but you do you my man
---
Thank you! - hopefully it scratches someones itch :)
---
just 3 blue buffer regions away lmao
---
pay me 5b isk or i wont remove my cloaky tengus from your system
---
&gt; T3 cruisers don't have skill loss
---
It's good of you to discredit yourself which such an obvious lack of knowledge about the game mechanics you supposedly are complaining about.
---
It would be interesting to have a most improved section, or highlight new bros that are doing good. Maybe something like "Top Pilots under 6 months or something.
---
Everyone wants TCUs deleted.  Entosis prods for fights just fine, probably better than any other system in history.
---
Citadels should be more tied to each other and SOV.  It should be easier to kill twenty citadels in one system, especially if you own the ihub.
---
I love how people say this, despite massive evidence to the contrary. Tribute a couple months ago, Deteroid right now, Deklien and Deteroid at the same time last summer, etc. 
---
But no, there are no wars happening at all. Citadels killed everything
---
right now it seems like only people in the large alliances are even playing anymore
---
You call this SOV warfare cancer, NOOBS, try with every EFFING moon having a pos tower you had to remove.  SBU's you had to lay down, TCU's and IHUBS you had to destroy with lottsa DPS.  This is cakewalk easy. A 2 man wrecking crew that is both bored as fuck and determined can do it.   Titans and supers alliance tier strategic assets???   WTF are you smoke cause you sure must be high as gas.  Individuals make them, not an alliance, Individuals buy them, fit them and use them, Rarely a corporation, but never an alliance.  Get your feet back on the ground and get real, and GIT GUD.
---
I absolutely get that. That I remember from when I started out as well. I took long breaks in the beginning just waiting for skills to be trained. And you also have the problems of expensive pods in LS so it compunds the issue.
---
You know about remapping and learning implants right? And that there is a cheap starter pack on CCPs page which gives you 1m SP plus some other things for 5 bucks? Its a really priceworthy pack cause thats about a month of training time right there. Its enough to get most (if not all) core skills to 4 atleast.
---
Ohh, THIS is why people support the blackout.  I now realize that I have been selfish and shortsighted in opposing it.
---
Hilmar, I retract any and all criticism I may have made of you or your policies, and I now applaud your genius.
---
Carry on your work, good developers.
---
Yeah, cause people use local in null to socialize.
---
&gt; local, a very key socialization tool
---
I see the Goon propaganda department has a new line.
---
Nullsec local had almost nothing to do with socialisation - all that ended up in there was shitpost spam occasionally. If you want a social channel then you want one which you don't leave when you take the gate out of system. A region wide chat might serve this purpose quite well.
---
Hhahah for sure. Omg whatever happens with the game Ive had so many laughs on this subject the last 2 months. The level of crazy shit has been wow.
---
We're deployed...
---
  Only our krabs live in eso right now...
---
  You seemed to have missed the first part of my comment.
---
I'm really looking forward to Price Status for privately owned citadels.
---
I agree, it was a sticky diplomatic situation for them.
---
Omg can we stop with all these "Eve is not dying" posts:)
---
You made the comment here. I'm not hunting through your history to decipher what you think. Spell it out here or don't.
---
100 %
---
u/squizz you asked and someone answered
---
Pearl Abyss owns eve now, only they get to decide to shut down the game permanently. So as long as a profit is made the game will continue.
---
Hurrah!
---
i think  its too early to start making conclusions. Let the game settle a little longer, people are still adapting. Also think some other factors might also be at play here
---
I think we are already in the no turning back phase of their playerbasel loss. Wow has been out just a little under a month and more people are joining every day. Borderlands 3 drops today, Call of Duty and a destiny 2 expac are out in just over a month, FF XIV just released an expac a little over 2 months ago. CCP needs to stop giving people reasons to look elsewhere for fun gameplay because there are a lot of options out there right now and more on the way. Not to mention Eve no longer has a convient monopoly on space simulator games, Elite dangerous and the game that shall not be named are becoming more of a thing and even No Man's Sky seems to be a viable game at this point. This is a really bad time for CCP to be convincing long term players to take a break.
---
Hilmar isnt a dev, hes just a shitty CEO that tells dev how to fuck up a game based on his dreams. 
---
Right now Ill take goons over CCP. Hands down. Thats how bad shit is. Plus goons arent really that bad.
---
He was replaced by Catlos.
---
hahahaha   you are great men hahahaha

Make some form of assets or important building materials regional to inspire people to fight over regions. This would also make being a pirate and camping shipping lanes a real job.

Hm.  I'll check my screenshot(s) but I distinctly remember there was only a bioadaptive cache, no nodes and no other cans.
---
Comparing eve to a mod of arma is bit of a fucking stretch.  
---
The only correlation here is that CCP devs currently are not the ones who wrote most of the eve code.

I've been thinking about rewriting the UI and making it responsive while at it - but frontend in general is a giant can of worms i dislike :(
---
That said, i have been meaning to dive into Vue - so - we'll see :P
---
On a stinkin' Lincoln no less.. must be a goon..
---
IHUB and TCU killmails would be great.
---
I am 30 and university just started back up for me. My excuse.
---
A lot of problems are not solved. People just copypaste someone else's solution to a problem with zero thought, and that pretty meh solution spreads without being min/maxed.
---
&gt; "CCP make a change I don't like so they must be ~bunker mentality~ because no-one could possibly have a different perspective to me"
---
Have a different perspective, but justify it or give us a reason to hope its a good perspective.
---
&gt;What, because the people in your 'empire' have to actually communicate to guarantee safety now?
---
No, because people are quitting hand over fist now.
---
Southside!
---
I’m plumbing the depths of your retardation.
---
Its more likely they simply don't have control to make those kinds of changes yet. Remember there is a performance bonus involved with the sale of the company to PA. If PA were to be given control of CCP while that bonus earning window was still open they would have the ability to negatively influence the game to lower the amount they would need to pay at the end of the performance period. But once that period ends they will have full control of the company, and I seriously doubt they are going to sit there and watch Hilmar continue to drive out 30%+ of the player base from the game they just spent 450 million dollars acquiring, especially given their reputation for milking as much money out of their players as possible. The bigger your player base the bigger potential profit there is in micro-transactions.
---
You are welcome to come fly with me !
---
What we do know is ALL player activity is down including ships destroyed.
---
Yeah, you're right, I let my exuberance get the better of me. I edited out some of the links because they weren't relevant and added a TL;DR at the beginning.
---
&gt; Comparing eve to a mod of arma is bit of a fucking stretch.
---
I compared it because both games have PvP that can happen at any time and permanent loss that resulted from it, and how Womble's explanation of how his clan evolved a "well, it happens, let's just have fun" attitude helped me come to accept EvE's gameplay more quickly and in a healthier way than I would have otherwise.
---
Y'all tried blobbing us in the invasion last summer. Turnabout is fair play homie.
---
I feel it gets in my way of flying other ships.. it quickly becomes a game of.. well that sucks... so does that
---
... Guess I'll just fly my tengu. Or I have to spend so much isk on something to make it effective to where I should have bought something else.. such as a tengu or Gila lol.
---
It drives me crazy... I've been playing since 2012 so a while. Finally this year bit the exhumer bullet and moved up simply because of min maxing. Now I just need reprocessing for crystals ugh! It's a whole thing.. mining is probably the worst for it tho.
---
But on the other side I love ship theory crafting trying to find the perfect fit to run something honestly consumes half of my eve time.
---
Its marshy, you didn't really expect better did you?
---
If you did, you might have actually posted said super and not some skills anyone can train afk.
---
Maybe hilmar shouldn't have gone with the treatment that lists one of the side affects as death.
---
Is that guy seriously holding nearly a trillion isk? I have 2 billion in my wallet and I feel like a fuckin' baller.
---
How hysterical that the two biggest player base crisis events in Eve history were both caused by the same disconnected idiot who thinks he knows better even as the game catches fire and starts to burn down around him.
---
i'm really happy about ccp's age of chaos. it's brought back some of the excitement and feeling of mystery i got from the game when i was brand new back in 2012. never know what's around the next corner!
---
You might kill miners to force people to come chase you with pvp ships. Then you shoot the police fleet that tries to come shoot you. Or you just shoot everything and mining ship happens to be easy target.
---
If you play Eve as a spaceship shooting game why would you even think about that kind of stuff? Who cares what you shoot at?
---
Zkill guide to the ibis when?
---
Yeah probably poor timing to declare war against them but they basically already were in a way, frat will now just struggle way more in China prime on timers.
---
I appreciate the perspective, I made 122 million tonight, which beats my 7 million haul all week, and i was concerned i was 'falling' behind.
---
&gt;  Offering one or two for 5.0 faction standing, some ISK, and LP would be a nice touch.
---
CCPls give SOE marauder skins.
---
What you even talking about.
---
There are more people in the login queue for Classic WoW than on Eve
---
I'm so confused, why does blackout stop afk gameplay...what is afkgameplay....
---
LP isk sinks are not true isk sinks, they are isk convertors.  
---
Insurance is the same way, but for minerals.  
---
Your proposal will not have the effect you think it will.
---
I have stopped playing, as have many others, 3 of my 4 accounts are alpha and I no longer log them in,the last  is ticking down his last omega days but having been in and around eve since 2009 you better believe I am going to make some noise about how massively they are fucking the game up on my way out the door in the vain hope Falcon pulls Hilmar's head out of his ass and wipes the shit out of his eyes in time for him to see he is putting the last nails in eve's coffin.
---
If you play a virtual spaceship game where you can fit huge amount of different weapons on your ship why some players consider using those weapons being a shitbag? If you play for example Counter Strike and shoot enemies are you a shitbag? I've never understood this.
---
Thanks for your reply. It took me all day to respond to this because I went to work after I posted.
---
I'm not looking for change to happen right away. My post was nothing tied to the speed of change after these meetings. My post was directed towards the fact that trust or having that Bond should not be critical to listening to the players overall voice through you as the representative of us.
---
The reason I say that is because you're not trying to sell someone on an idea that is yours. You're simply conveying feedback that it is ours. It should be pretty straightforward on what that feedback entails.
---
That being said I get that you're trying to say that it requires a certain type of finesse to get that feedback conveyed over to the other side and change to happen. My frustration is the fact that it should not be the way to make these things happen because that requires us as players to find the right candidate he's going to be buddy buddy and trustworthy as opposed to just why don't you read the fucking feedback and tell us as CCP what's going to be done about it if anything or Nothing at All.
---
for that they already speak about randomize the mass
---
congrats on being a statistical outlier.
---
It has everything to do what the fact that these are representative of the player base and I am a player. I have every right to question the system and the representatives who are conveying feedback on my behalf. You may not I agree with that but we will have to agree to disagree completely here.
---
thank god for wow classic during these...DARK times. hah. get it. dark. cause iots....its black out. and things that are....yea. heh.
---
 they're designed to be huge **bash** machin\* fixed
---
There's plenty of small gang content, more than there has been for a long time. We're doing just fine out of wormholes
---
Vaun is a smooth brained boy
---
So power creep, with no downside, and adding value to LP farming scams, swell.
---
I always wanted to be able to have ramming damage with a pod.  From Hell's heart I stab at thee.
---
As I said in the other post I strongly disagree that relationship needs to be formed in order to Simply convey feedback on behalf of the players. It's just be back from us not feedback from the candidate itself. If you have to find the right person that's going to have all the Trust In finesse to convince a video game producer or game director or game developer to make a change then we're fucked.
---
That's how all of this stuff works.  The job is as much lobbying as it is passing on player feedback.  That requires trust and it requires relationship building.
---
1) Moon mining in wormhole provides low grade materials. Not ABC ore. 
---
2) Those C1 rorq fleets are making like a couple bil per week not a couple bill per day. The fuel cost from the Athanor cuts into the profit. I will look into getting some specific numbers for comparison.
---
people that mine or farm NPC's passively in dangerous space often watched netflix while AFK  (Away from keyboard) to pass the time because they could rely on intel bots or local chat intel to keep them safe.  CCP games removed the local chat intel and this made people actually have to pay attention and stay at the keyboard.  The same time CCP Blackedout local chat intel, Netflix stock plummeted.  Coincidence?
---
&gt; set your clone to jita 4-4 and then buy a T1 frig of your choosing. Fitted of course and boat over to tama.
---
yes, make sure to feed that gate camp
---
no, not forever
---
Your right on that, second youngest in my university program.
---
This fight brought to light alot of things we need to work on fixing for that i'm thankful. All in all it was alot of fun. GF. On a sidenote we spoted that dread cyno a few jumps out so we knew time was a ticking but we weren't fast enough :p
---
lol, you want to give up asset safety in null?
---
Keeping his side of the sandbox cat turd free :)
---
It really depends on who's running a program and how they push the players towards the Developers.
---
I have run similar programs for other games and I absolutely stay away from the idea of trying to make it where a player has to be in good graces of the game developer in order to convey feedback on behalf of the entire player community.
---
The reason why I take that approach it's because it's too much for a player to worry about when simply just come bang simple feedback that is compiled from dozens if not hundreds if not thousands of other voices that is not just their own.
---
We should not have a developer saying they will not take action on a critical piece of feedback simply because he does not like to CSM candidate. That is the absolute wrong way to receive an act on feedback.
---
PVP? No.  PVE? yes
---
Just implying you've died actually.
---
All signs point to...maybe
---
Some people are super space-rich
---
It could just be people can see you're full of shit.
---
&gt;People would have formed coalitions no matter what. 
---
But they would not have formed them as fast or as large as they did without the catalyst provided by PL/NC actions of the years.
---
Deliver all your stuff to "nothing sus here"
---
More like, thousands of players, entrenched knowledge, a place to call home.
---
Or should they sit in high sec npc corp #3 with some clueless semi bots?
---
Or should they dive into a wormhole and get farmed by elite pvpers like they would in null, but with less help and more skill requirements?
---
&gt;I want to know if you've ever wanted to do something because you find it fun or interesting but was discouraged or turned away entirely because of min-maxxing.
---
For me, but also I'm sure for many others, the pve is not enjoyable. It's very simple, highly repetitive and does very little to create an immersive or emotionally evocative experience. The pop up message that shows up when you warp to an anomaly might be a bit spooky the first, but by the third time? The tenth? It doesn't matter what it says, it has no emotional affect.
---
As such pve isn't really interesting and can't be, it exists as a means to an end and never as an end in itself. As such I feel no reason to treat it as anything other than as a chore to be dispensed with as quickly as possible.
---
The draw that eve has for me is that it is essentially gambling without real money. Every time you undock you're betting that you won't be baited, or that if you are being baited that you have the better escalation. You're betting that your ship has a better fit, or that you can make a better use out of it than the other guy you're shooting at can. 
---
PvP is an incredibly emotionally evocative experience. If you've ever gotten the PvP shakes you know exactly what I mean. The emotional stakes of the game are so high that you're body is tricked into thinking it's in real danger. The narratives that the game builds are more real and immersive than anything some writer could come up with. I may not give a fuck about whether I'm an orc or a human, but holy fuck you just know that when someone posts some "grr gon hat gon" shitpost that they are SUPER invested into the player created narrative.

In the past I've spent lots of time on Sisi, practicing and testing fits in an environment devoid of any cost. Every thing costs 100 isk and all the ships pay out the regular tranquility insurance so you literally can't run out of isk. I almost quit the game because I felt nothing when I lost a ship, and nothing when I got a kill. It was some meaningless bullshit hidden behind an obtuse interface with uninspired mechanics that practically beg you to afk once you turn everything on.
---
The pve therefore is the ante in the bet that is every time I undock. It's some super tedious bullshit that I have to do so that my ship has some concrete value. My ship isn't just leshak #7, it's the two hours that I spent bored out of my mind so that I could buy it. I'm not losing another ship indistinguishable from every other ship in a pile next to it, I'm in a situation where if I lose my ship I'm forcing myself to be committed to more bullshit tedium. This highly creates a huge emotional incentive to not lose the ship, which causes all kinds of chemicals to be released in my brain. Without the risk of real loss there can be no thrill when you win.
---
It's why at a fundamental level I think that things like alliance SRP and the flood of materials (minerals, pirate hull bpcs, deadspace gear etc) that have been coming out of null for the last couple years are highly detrimental to the game. Making everything easily accessible reduces the pain of losing it which makes the game less emotionally evocative.
---
You might call that masochism, and you'd probably be right. There is after all a reason why all of us bitter vets were able to stick through the garbage NPE that we had in the old days.

Grath, I understand you have bias here. When you don't even have empathy how can you understand? It's short sighted or at least come up with something with more depth than "What a bitch!". IF ccp got rid of esi details like npc kills, jumps, etc etc and forced the hunters to actually hunt, you might see more subcaps ratting. 
---
At this point in time, dotlan being the insta intel used by almost everyone, provides a lot of information about a system. I was one of the few people that ratted in subs in the past, mostly because I can have more leverage to control when I leave a site. Now? You need to have a super to even think about living for more than a minute. I don't rat anymore (not that I really care since most of my isk comes from market) but this certainly will hit anyone else that does it for a living. Ratting for more than an hour in a carrier will more than likely get you a visitor. For me personally, it's going to be goons visiting more than likely. They usually range from 10-40 lokis and bombers staging from fdz. This setup WILL kill a carrier in less than a few minutes. 
---
I understand there are people that are complaining about risk. There will always be those people, there never absolute 'saftey' for normal caps and sub caps since blackout. but the TLDR is, Grath go out and rat in a carrier in null and see how quick to get dropped. If you are going to suggest that your play style is better than everyone else's, you are part of the problem.
---
Don't you have a NAP with goons?
---
ayyy

The only purpose of L1 and L2 security missions is to get to L3.

Remind me what made phoebe screech worthy, I wasn't playing back then
---
It's a buff for people who lose pods a lot and a Nerf for people who don't. If you can keep a set of +5's alive for more than 3 months, you've gotten more value out of them than these things. We should never discourage people from losing ships/pods, espically new players who need SP the most but is also least able to afford learning implants for each clone.

you: "So what your saying is that I don't like being in blobs"

also you: member of snuffed

:thonking intensifies:
---
Appreciated. Will most def take you up on that someday.
---
That's the thing - CCP doesn't expect the CSM members to come in to convey feedback compiled from players.  They can get that stuff from surveys, and such. It's as much individual feedback from players the community trusts than anything else. 
---
There are tons of ways for regular players to interact with the Devs, so this isn't the only format available for that. But this is the format CCP wants for this kind of feedback.
---
your playstyle is not logging in AND posting to reddit. Try logging in and NOT posting in reddit :)
---
Even with the changes off late making my idk making hard to non existent, I've been having more fun just on fleets an dropping to save peoples.
---
Gib...gib me
---
Buy skill books, buy skill injectors, buy pvp ships, invest into manufacturing or trading, fly bigger and better ships.
---
Get about 500 Billion more, and you can pay for your next month of Omega game time. Of course, then you'll be piss broke again and have to start over.
---
1 Bil isn't a whole lot these days, what with Inflation and all. But since you're only 2 weeks old, I'd recommend outfitting a dozen Frigates and losing them in PvP. That way you'll learn what it takes to shoot and get shot.
---
High-sec is a joke. Want to mine ore there? What about ratting to make isk? Right I'll just run level 4s all day long. How about incursions? Nvm triglavians kind of fucked with them atm. Marketing? Well I do that already, it easier to sell certain mods in null and make more isk from it. 
---
What else do you do in high-sec? Distribution missions? Hauling? I do enough hauling in a JF to know what hauling is like in high-sec, its cancer and very low pay. 
---
High-sec is WASTE of sp. Cant use bubbles, PDS, caps, DDs, and lets not talk about concord. Living in high-sec only is cancer. Did it for a few years and would rather live in null or low-sec than high-sec.
---
There are some nice chaps in Jita that will gladly double them for you
---
yes, you can look up Netflix stock on many websites or even on your mobile phone.
---
Wait what? Ships or mods or weapons arent the issue. The attitude towards others are. To use your example people hating AWPers in CS is an attitude. Even though is kinda shitty but you get the point.
---
Disliking others because they like other things is a shitbag thing to do. Live and let live brother.
---
Was riding my bike home from work last week and some dude in a big fuck you pick up drive by with that very sticker in his back window. So anyways other people in Calgary play eve apparently.
---
&gt; I'd have been okay with EVE if it wasn't possible to get suicide-ganked / kamikaze'd in high-sec systems.
---
I've gotta give you the Pro-Eve answer.
---
While possible it's unusual unless you're making yourself a target. New players almost never get messed with. Most of the ganking that does happen is people flying ships which are known to be extremely expensive while being cheap to suicide.
---
Everyone is a target of you're brave enough.
---
i love yall, yall are great guys :)  
---
never change :)
---
Am I taking crazy pills? Why are the DEVS sitting down with the stakeholders ? Where the fuck is the product owner/program managers???
---
I had a course in 2014 use k&amp;r as a primary guide. Its still a fantastic book
---
sTOP
---
I have a big truck (not an f-u).. need me an eve sticker..
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/64500126/ thats my most recent loss.
---
For those who play the game regularly 2 bill is literally nothing, people make that in just a few hours.
---
It was a joke
---
You find a low SP fit frig, buy a couple and head out to LS.
---
Eurobrains showing once again why they’re the worst posters.
---
It's cheaper to buy a subscription with real money and that's what I'd be doing once the month is up. My main concern is that it seems like I'm locked into doing explo forever while my pvp/fitting skills train up to a decent point. I can't even properly fly an astero yet because I'm waiting on cloaking IV for covops and drones V + other drone skills. I like what I've done so far, but enough not to grind for months or just pay to wait for sp to trickle in.
---
eve was already trending downward
---
&gt;it is needed to add correction to other things impacted by it.
---
i'd rather have blackout with no changes than no blackout, local chat is a huge issue
---
Wtf are you talking about. Here is the official description of the CSM program.
---
The role of a CSM member is to represent the player community in the ongoing development of EVE Online. As an elected representative, a CSM member will have clear communication paths with CCP and a chance to influence the development of EVE Online many times over the course of their term.
---
Soot, idk about you, but cancer is cancer. Yes the previous sov systems were shit. Doesn't mean fozzie sov isn't cancer either.
---
Make more isk and use injectors.
---
The best way to make money in Eve is to pay for your subscription with real money.
---
A skill injector sounds like the best use for it.
---
Whos that guy? "Adventure"... Whats he usually flying?
---
👍
---
Anytime. I’ll even give you some ships to come die gloriously in :)
---
&gt;It also removes any and all socialization among players that aren't a part of your corp/alliance.
---
wrong
---
Yes, that's the description. Where do you see "provide compiled feedback from players to the Devs" in there? 
---
"Represent the community" does not equal "compile opinions and hand shit over."
---
&gt;Was it good design that one character could lock down a freighter for an indefinite amount of time?
---
3 minimum
---
&gt;The argument that you're making though is that now it is UNJUSTLY difficult, which you haven't really proven.
---
how long must ganking stop for you to recognize this fact yourself?
---
I technically am since I live in S Loop. But not originally from Chicago so not as intense on the S side N side stuff.
---
I am aware of that. Black out has not stopped the downward trend. We can postulate either way on that. Not my point. My point is that we need an upward trend. Anything that achieves that should result in the entirety of the eve population rejoicing even if it is hard to accept said changes.
---
sure
---
refuted on all points, posts a meme
---
good job KillahPee
---
Was expecting urgaypowned. Left disappointed
---
you literally asked me to spell it out you mongoloid  
---
but fair enough my dude i wont lol
---
LOL YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH DEVS?? ISN'T THAT A HUGE CONFLICT OF INTEREST YOU SPACE POLITICIAN? HOW DARE YOU NOT BE 100% IMPARTIAL AND SERIOUS ABOUT THIS VIDEO GAME SPACE SENATE
---
You're really splitting hairs here. The point is, they are there to represent us, however they gather the information to do so. The main difference between them and say, a hired community manager is the CSM candidate actually plays the game and hopefully plays it on an expert level to where they can filter whatever feedback from whatever channel (i.e.: forums, reddit, in-game, etc) based on said experience. Which, I do very much believe makes all the difference and why we need such programs as these.
---
It's not splitting hairs - I just think you've got an extremely narrow view of what "representing players" is.  It's always going to be more than just being a conduit for feedback. It has to be, since we have no tools other than reading and talking to people to get said feedback.
---
Your build's failing and you got no tests! :sadface:
---
I dont think they know yet. I mean it hasnt been a fiscal quarter yet. Or rather the numbers get compiled right about now and presented soon. Dont think PA are hands on but rather they watch from the sidelines and intervene when shit hits the fan. And that takes time.
---
&gt; Disliking others because they like other things is a shitbag thing to do. 
---
Yeah, if someone wants to shoot easy targets like miners then just let them.
---
We will have to agree to disagree then homie.
---
Right the Incarna debacle blew up because of Hilmars mail or something like that right?
---
Wands are dumb
---
I guess it would be, it's just an incredibly underwhelming way to spend it all when I've been window shopping for blinged out pirate frigs at jita lol
---
&gt;Absolute death the first time you see it
---
Alternatively, if you're not an idiot, you would just look and see that it's clearly not a normal room and probably has special properties. One of which is the already opened gate. Don't make the mistake of assuming everyone else is as dumb as you.
---
So, I cannot extract omega skills with an alpha account (Honestly wtf though, such a way to get another PLEX used). I am trying to extract a toon on an account that isn't important and I don't want it subbed. Can I transfer a character from an account in Alpha state to one that's omega? 
---
If so, do I have to use real money to transfer or can I use in game PLEX from my wallet to do the transfer
---
The abyss doesn't remove isk from the game in any way.
