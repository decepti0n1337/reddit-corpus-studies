"  Regardless still stands, you remove alphas player numbers would dip quite heavily. "   
---

---
Not without an actual numbers breakdown from CCP it doesn't. There are plenty of testimonials just in this sub of people who played and quit because they didn't like alpha and never got into the game enough to sub. Without an actual breakdown of how many active players are FTP v Omega we can't conclusively say getting rid of alpha would drop active numbers because that argument as it stands is based entirely on assumptions by the player base. who have no access to CCP's analytics on the topic.

Not like they are wrong but as the company leading the game the less they can do is support us in our choices, at least when it comes to community needs, right?
---
Too bad riot won't pick him up but you can't blame em.

I'm perfectly aware of what's generally regarded as offensive. The fucking problem is the 1% of people that take offence with everything and cause a fucking storm over it.

What about the battle nereus for FC ship?
---
Recon team, best team.
---
Null-sec in and of itself is supposed to be Dangerous Space. There's a reason there aren't space cops out there, it's high risk high reward, or rather it's supposed to be. In practice null is some of the cushiest space in the game because everyone either has a defense fleet sitting around waiting or as this post details, bot networks that cause several toons to warp at once, perfectly every single time, within a single tick while also pulling their drones the instant someone enters local. 
---
A delayed local would just mean people have to pay attention to their dscan instead of the chat window, meaning they have to actually be engaged with the game every so often.
---
Its called local and paying attention to intel, the second you hit local they start recalling, you run the scan catch them as they are coming back to the VNI 2-3 seconds passes you scan again drones gone, that's more than 1 tick, if they are orbitting at 30 in drone bonused boats running drone nav computers they can have those things back in the bay and be getting into warp in 4-5 seconds from when you hit local. Players paying attention to roamers is not evidence of boating no matter how loud people like you screech about it.
---
Who?
---
1469 would almost be like some kind of combination between the sex and the weed number 
---
I joke and all, but g'luck :p
---
I dont think hes actually banned. Probably just taking a break really.
---
Lol find your fav upcoming highsec CSM and bother their ass about it. :]
---
Eve Online is a fun game to play for people who enjoy that sort of thing
---
Not if they started recalling them when you hit local, those drones would already be moving as your first d-scan goes out, then factor in we are talking about a ship that most likely has at least 1 if not 2 drone nav computers and is usually orbiting at 30 km or closer it only takes a couple seconds to get those drones off scan. The use the fleet warp command and everything you have in space magically warps to the station or POS of your choice. Its not botting its mechanics
---
I guess it's true what they say... Shit really does roll downhill.

This is making me realize how much I should donate to him.
---
That's a yikes
---
click on client screen, tap short cut hot key to recall drone, click next account, tap hot key again, you can do it across 3-4+ accounts in 2-3 seconds if you are paying attention, then hit fleet warp if all your guys are in the same room and be gone with a handful of clicks.
---
Focus on RL and the SP will flow faster than u realize
---
&gt;15km/s with 3 navs and warrior IIs
---
Yeah I guess it is entirely possible for a player to easily get these off dscan by the time the second dscan comes around. 
---
If you weren't so easy to bait, none of this would be possible. Again, thanks.

This thread is making me hungry.

That's absurdity. 
---
Im thinking it was a little higher than that.
---
In addition to dscan immunity, we need to buff lock range of interceptors to 50km so we don't have to waste a vital fitting slot on lock range rig in order to point w/ heated faction disruptors. Also the pacifier has high warp speed, imagine if combat interceptors got a warp speed bonus per level of interceptor skill!. Also have you considered the implication of an ISK Damage Control where you can have 100% resist in combat interceptors as long as you can pay 50mil per second to the module.
---
Can you post wayback machine url for us plebs?
---
Waffles undocks too :( 
---
Brave is very laid back. which is nice. Sometimes people forget EVE is a game.
---
Eve should give each player a "self-injector" every 6 month and give newbros one every 45-60 days. Would work exactly like a regular injector but more SP (say 1m to 2m), non transferable, and lossless. Basically a minor re-spec.
---
Pandoralica is arguably the most inventive and technically competent FC and theory crafter in the game. And by arguably I mean you can argue it , but it is none the less true.
---
I dont think you should disregard wormhole space so easily. A C2 with a C2 static and a low sec for instance is pretty unattractive and people certainly wont evict you for no reason unless you really piss them off. From there you could do exploration, its small gang pvp which is the closest you will ever get to a 1v1 and you can mine if your willing to lock off the hole. Logistics are not really an issue if you always keep a month or 2 of fuel on hand and you can do industry pretty much undisturbed. Throw on the PI which will generate around a bill a month per account i think its a very attractive option. Although maybe go for a C2 with a high sec static to start with if your really worried about logistics. You will definately get that building from the ground up feeling :) alternately join an already established corp who can help you but wont be quite so carebear as null sec alliances are.
---
Many thanks for posting this, looking forward to it!  o7
---
Can confirm; I woke up to the consecutive pings at 4am and was like, the fuck? Why?
---
To provide some additional insight.
---
A retri is ~3200m/s cold, mal with a 12% speed nerf is ~3500m/s cold.
---
The retri has no problems catching most targets while roaming. The retri is not bubble immune, nor does it have a longer point range. A mal losing 400m/s will not effect its ability to catch things for initial tackle. Sure, its possible for warriors to catch up to you potentially, but that exists now and you can still fit guns/launchers to defang if needed.
---
For staying power, a combat ceptor may be better. As itll be much faster and most already have a smaller sig. The crusader is a few meters less than a mal, will have the same point/range bonuses and can do some damage. The main factor is if you want bubble immunity. 3500m/s before mods, along with good agility is plenty to still catch ships. Fleet ceptors shouldnt have everything. Thats why combat ceptors have no roles atm.
---
I realise that corps joining Horde is a new phenomenon for you, and I really hate to Hurst your bubble but Horde didn't poach anything. Kismeteer and I discussed Bat's situation and we agreed that Bat would benefit from a new alliance. I fully supported Bat moving to Horde and personally assured Gobbins there was absolutely no animosity or bad blood. For what it's worth I think Horde is lucky to have Kismeteer, his patience and willing to help literally anyone will be an asset to new players wanting to break into 0.0 life with Horde. 
---
FC, too many pings asking me to support my alliance!
---
Im busy pvping spod, plz respect
---
Lol, even without official figures there are loads of alpha groups out there that would cease to exist. I don't see how you cannot acknowledge the fact that there are plenty of alpha players around. They would be gone, regardless of knowing exact figures the fact remains that it would be a significant amount of active players.. 
---
For like 5 years I had a stupid shell script resetting a mac address on boot on a dumb linux PC that had lost a NIC and was a site-wide license server for matlab. You are very very correct. VMs just make this super trivial.
---
I’m not admitting to anything in public. And Hai Rab. Remember when we used to do all the heavy lifting in horde DPS? Now the beans just bosun everything in sight. RIP T2 DPS Max SP supremacy :( https://zkillboard.com/kill/51019580/
---
b-but Mittani said it was ok to bot in delve right ? It should not be hard to find some names then !
---
Because historically, that is how CCP balances things like this.
---
Get an armor HP bonus? CCP will nerf the base HP amount. So at lvl5, you will see more armor than the previous stats. At inty lvl5, youll see 5% more agility than you do now.
---
Now im certainly open to a higher agility buff. But I also want to avoid every fleet ceptor being instawarp with little effort.
---
Just another day of TEST general Discord autism. This is not newsworthy.
---
My only regret is that unlike the botters and the massive blocs that support them, I have but one vote to give for my CSM. 
---
\- Random dice rolls for stat changes on modules.   
---
\- First ever Eve event where the boosters we got didn't actually boost us but encouraged us to purchase skill injectors to take advantage of it.
---
\- More skins and more ads to purchase things are coming my way now. 
---
\- Dev's have no change in progress pace for work on bugs. Things go as usual. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There has been no introduction of pay to win content in the market and I hope they don't. It was a shame this Holiday's event gifts were changed from something useful to something that is only useful if I pay about 3-15 bil for where it used to be a booster that would increase skill training by 2x for the next 12 -24 hours depending on which event and which boosters ya got. 
---
In previous events I felt the need to go out and explore the objectives to get the extra event loot. This time I felt no urge to do the event at all.   
---
I feel mediocre about how Pearl Abyss has been treating us so far, maybe even slightly dissatisfied. 
---
Is that what you said when you came back from wherever you've been and saw the state your alliance was in after progods 3 and a bit weeks of trying to decide whether he was invading Geminate? 
---
&gt;I also appreciate anyone who counciled or advised or talked to me as well, it was great seeing the community talk about shooting stuff in positive light, rather than just the normal rah rah eve is terrible.  You know who you are. :)

That's 14 good-looking pilots!

I'd vote for that CSM candidate, too.

Better dead than red.

You mean 14 good-looking pilots

Yeah i know. I just like to make posts like this for discussion. Thats the intent of forums and reddit. Better than another bot post.

Tri will never Failscade, We have to many members who care about who we are and what we stand for to let anyone Hit the Delete key on us!
---
I see people bringing up "Ohh x corp left the alliance" and "oh u fucked over that dude" literally not knowing wtf they are saying only spewing out roomers they here without the full story..... Tri will not failscade even now as we are fighting outmatched numbers we are still doing what we need to do.
---
I like to look at things from a surprising perspective, A Goonswarm perspective.... If 90% of eve can pound an alliance the size of goonswarm literally making them outnumberd worse then we are now and they are still in game. Seriously Tri has fuck all to worry about.

Now get back to your mining you cheeky shit's

It's 3 AM, you are in your fancy car and there is no one on the road, you decide "fuck it, I going to go ham" and you start to drive fucking fast, full speed, you feel like in a GTA or Need for speed but then a traffic enforcement camera catch you, you are waaaay above the speed limit. Cops after this take away your driving license, are you going to tell them "but hey, it was a quality of life improvement, their was nothing on the road, it did not hurt anyone right ? It made me came back home earlier so it's nice right ?" Do you really think it's going to work that way ? Law is law, if you break the law for a quality of life improvement, no one going to tell you "oh, ok,  it's fair then" no, law is law.
---
I know it can be hard to understand but, do as if Marchy was in fact a goon guy, maybe you can understand why it's bad to break the law since you guys seemto only care about EULA when it's a goon involved.

You guys think a couple of pings is bad? That's cute...

Such is the burden of being #1. When you're the best at a video game, you assume the onerous yoke of Video Game Steward. If we don't hold ourselves to higher standards, there will be *dire* consequences.

I like the contrast between the sweetness of the pineapple and the savoriness of the cheese/meat though.

Farmstink never lost ping rights, lomgrim is a social idiot sometimes, nice try though.
---
Cracks forming
---
We had the grid :(
---
The main thing I dislike about this is that it takes away the Malediction's ability to fly as a solo scramkite/brawling frigate with rockets. It's something of a super-budget, limited Garmur, gaining a little bit of tank (due to the base resist profile and being plated), a huge amount of warp speed and nullification in exchange for trading away all the projection, DPS, and mobility under scram that the rocket Garmur has.
---
It's a rather niche option sure, but I think it's a very cool one and I'd really hate to see it go away, considering that the Malediction is one of a fairly limited number of armor-tanked missile boats to begin with, *especially* at the frigate/destroyer level.
---
As far as "just fly a Vengeance", part of why I favor the Malediction (besides aesthetic) is the fact that as a fleet ceptor I think it's more likely to be underestimated by other solo frigates, and the specific tackle bonuses further play into the particular quirks I want to try and take advantage of, allowing some potentially very strong scramkiting that is somewhat limited by the poor DPS the brawling Malediction has (compared to the Vengeance or the combat 'ceptors, for example).
---
That said that I do dig that Crusader change. If only because %armor HP means room for lawlpolarized fits, which is always hilarious.
---
When I mention EVE to my friends IRL they say "Oh spreadsheet simulator lol". Only one friend has said something else and thats "EVE is my favorite game to read about but never play" which I feel is pretty damn accurate at times when I let my sub lapse occasionally.
---
Basketball or football?

Phoebe followed by 3 years of pve with nerf after nerf to content generation pushed a lot of people away. The PCU is only kept "stable" now by the growing number of injected rorqs and capital alts.
---
cry more 
---
That won't fix it. The dps and speed tank of a VNI is unmatched by any other cruiser fo PvE, and the drone damage bonus of the rattlesnake, again makes it unmatched for dps at range than any other ship.
---
Rats and anoms themselves need to be reworked. Serpentis space rats should be ideal for blasters, i.e rats approach and not run 100km off. Guristas should not be constantly jamming everything and it's mom. Etc.

Don't feel too bad. Horde pinged 4 times for this. Flew to hisec only to turn around and fly home while getting stalked by a bunch of AFs.
---
I kind of figured this was the case, especially after the most active people in BAT have joined SNIGG in the past few days. Horde should be a good place for them to rebuild and become active again. 
---
Ariel Rin is actually the best guy though,

---
I had spent a good 15min debating on keeping the malediction RoF bonus. Even originally wrote its bonuses with the RoF for the reasons you listed. But for the sake of consistency, i decided to remove it. As it would be weird that the mal keeps its damage bonus, but the ares, crow or stilleto would have no damage bonuses/weapon modifiers.
---
I suppose the inertia value could be dropped and just rolled into the base values. Im just a fan of the bonuses making it clear what the ship's role is. And primarily, a fleet ceptor tackles and fits no weapons. 
---
DPS-wise really it's the Taranis mostly.
---
And none of them can fit an ADC.
---
That's gonna be a big yikes from me dog
---
-10% *or more* to warp speed? Bitch that's the whole *point* of an interceptor: *INTERCEPTION.*
---
Yeah but I was in the coalition of the billing and I have no idea what this eula meme is about.
---
pro-Money Badger Coalition, the coalition formed by casino during WWB to kill goons who push a different narrative than the Imperium. Since right now there is only 2 side in eve, Imperial Legacy vs MBC (from my point of view ofc, maybe someone not "deaf" like you could tell us more)
---
I could only read about half of this and then came to the realization that everyone in this text needs to get a life and perhaps dare I say it, “Play less eve”
---
Casinos provided more entertainment than botters did..
---
So there's that
---
Oh my god [/Mikal Voice]
---
Keepstars have always costed around 160-220b to build. The 300b number you remember from before was an arbitrarily made up number set by the guy who runs zKill until he finally fixed it and set it to actual build cost.
---
Gaara was caught doing input broadcasting and everyone was ok to ban him for that since it's illegal, Marchy was caught doing input broadcasting and some people decide it was legit for him to use since and then call Goons shitposter "hypocrite" or "pushing a narrative to get him ban"

He's not banned my friend
---
Decided to stop frolicking in the burning dumpster and jump into the regular dumpster. 
---
You know he isn't banned right?
---
Or just put a praxis on the central point gate in gateway during the race thingy and get over 2 thousand kills in a 2 week period...
---
He hasn't been banned m8
---
Become a smart bomber. We get 12 points for every interceptor.
---
Ok m8.
---
and risk not killing the interceptors and tanked frigates? have you gone mad? 2-3 bombers can alpha t3ds, do you know what kind of salt you get when you smart bomb a t3d?
---
Oh, it's not a great option, but if you want to not worry about driving and parking and want to drink, its not the worst thing in the world.

You would also already have a guaranteed seat as opposed to standing, and dont need to fight for parking in burlington. Pride weekend sees an estimated 1 million people.

This is true

Tell me where in CCP's rules appears "you can input broadcast as long as it doesn't break the game" or any variations of the sort.
---
Can we petition to have Horde change its standard overview to yours?
---
I understand there is a lot, but what is the drawback of being both shield and armor tanked? Besides the opportunity cost of  damage or utility mods instead. 
---
Thanks for the TLDR, a good read!

You guys will fall for anything.

That was a normal conversation had 100 times a day.  That's how you know they love each other.  When that stuff doesn't happen is when you need to ask, "What's Wrong?"

I never said anything of that sort, I’m just curious how that can possibly be game breaking

I would like to see this "ever growing database" you have assembled. I am also running for CSM in 2019 and think botting is bad.

Honestly, what I was thinking was it would initially come up like that, then going into the corner. I also was imagining something more along the lines of what the pilot might actually see. Since some information we would naturally already have.

Ironically I wasn't involved in selection of the dates for Toronto.

---
Sadly this isn't true. There are d scan bots that log everything. There are also the farming ones, one way to tell is they will just warp from celestial to celestial in an uncloacked ship before they start doing sites. This game is fucking lame.
---
&gt;The fucking incursion drama was way spicier.
---
You ain't kidding. A 7 page thread arguing about a hypothetical scenario that hadn't even happened.

There was no actual issue. It was beautiful.

Link ze fit ma dude
---
What if we combine topics.. "N days since my new ceptor fit was abused by bots and how Elo and Mar5hy fucked my gaming experience"..
---
I think the refinement for you plan is around speed tax.. like the negatives balance out the positives and it comes down to scenario of usage. Its not say I agree/disagree with your theorycrafting here, i'm just curious to see how it would be applied to various ceptor focused scenarios to get a sense of how you came to the end result.

No Ketchup?  Sounds like my kind of place!

They could have done something insane like put a bubble on a gate or something.

Have you looked into Brave Newbies?  Caldari is a great race to start with for them. You can go on small gang or large fleet roams but mostly the content comes right to us in Catch... so you can get your PvP chops up in your own yard.  While Brave has grown out of being just a newbie corp, it's main tenant is still to help/teach newbies. So you should have no problem getting help.
---
All newb friendly null corp will give you free ships and being in null you should have no problem making isk. That will at least take the pressure off of having to stay over fit all day.
---
Thanks will check it out when I get back from work :)

true, but at the end of the day it shouldnt be up to us to deal with the botters, CCP need to sort there shit, i know we have had the same 5ish botters for the past year now doing the exact same things been reported no end of times and still no ban

My guess would be that it's basically a part time job that you don't get paid for, and you end up getting stuck doing it for loooong after you win Eve.
---
I would actually tolerate way more bullshit out of an IT dude than I would an FC, and tolerate Progod fleets.
---
`tenant` -&gt; `tenet`
---
I wasn't comparing the tank, just DPS, as that was all that mentioned by the person i was commenting to.
---
DPS wise, the ranis, raptor and crusader can all get to 200-250dps.
---
Crusader with conflag and small focus lasers is 242 dps, with scorch is 173, both are before heat.
---
Raptor with anti-matter is 199dps, void is 222dps and null is 159dps
---
Taranis with anti-matter+drones is 237 dps, void is 260dps
---
Jaguar and vengeance struggle to get past 200dps and the ishkur sits around 220-250dps depending on fits. The hawk also sits around 215dps with scourge and 170 with non-scourge.
---
So, yes, to the original comment, there is very little difference currently with properly fit combat ceptors and a good portion of assault frigates. Do they have the same tank? Of course not, but we were never discussing tank.
---
You're a good man. Let me know if you need assistance with anything. Literally, just name it, and I'll help. &lt;3

Bat County... the corporation Darius JOHNSON joined after "Ten Dollar Bond" failed to be his own Goons with blackjack and hookers and "No Xenurias".   
---
Bat Country... now lead by a former member of Goonwaffe who was air-locked for leaking intel on dread cache locations.   
---
Bat Country... where all True Goons end up, In Pandemic Horde...  
---
I sort of did. Combat ceptors landing without warning is a large threat. A huge part of effective small gang is spamming dscan. Not just reacting to what is on grid, but what is coming. For instance, in fountain there is often a super here or two. Furthermore, there is a bug that crops up where stuff just “appears on grid” we don’t get the time of deacceleration. So you are right that combat recons are much slower. There is time to react! A combat ceptor that can burn 6k with scram is something that I rely on dscan to be ready for. Especially since they can light a cyno. I certaintly agree neuts are an answer. However, a heavy neut would only be on a legion/curse which means a gimped fit or a battleship which is a super long lock time. In this capital meta, I just don’t think a dscan immune ceptor would continue to make dropping on small roaming gangs easier and easier. At least with the combat recons you can move in time to get away and stay on grid. With a ceptor it would be a much larger risk I feel like. But who knows I am just using my crystal ball - it is likely broken.
---
Lol wtf.
---
In b4 Waffles joins Horde.
---
Fuck I miss Reza.
---
That has always been my opinion as well. 
---
I multibox Rorquals myself and live with Rorquals all around me and at least to my eyes Bots don’t seem common. 
---
I think of a few ‘suspicious’ massive fleets who seemed to never stop mining for 20+ hrs, but that is pretty rare for me to see.  
---
Input broadcasting on the other hand...  
---
Lazy bastards with 30+ Rorquals out input broadcasting drone commands.  Pretty much anyone who has fleets over 30 ships should automatically raise a big flag with CCP.  
---
Sure you can multi box a crap ton of Rorquals, but I think at some point people just get lazy and want Max ISK/hr.  
---
&gt; My guess would be that it's basically a part time job that you don't get paid for, and you end up getting stuck doing it for loooong after you win Eve.
---
This is surprisingly accurate. There's also a huge feeling of sunk cost that makes it almost impossible to want to leave.
---
&gt;\-10% or more to warp speed? Bitch that's the whole point of an interceptor:   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;INTERCEPTION
---
Read it again because you clearly didn't read it thoroughly before you sperged out. You apparently glazed over 2 facts.
---
1. Fleet ceptors would be getting a warp speed BUFF, infact all fleet interceptors would be at 10AU/s at interceptor level 5 (see malediction breakdown.
---
2. I did **not** say warp speed, i said SUB-WARP speed, as in, ship velocity.
---
This means a fleet interceptor is bubble immune and warps faster to INTERCEPT targets running away. While combat interceptors have faster on-grid speeds, but slower (relatively) warp speeds (not nerfed, just slower than fleet interceptors). This allows them to INTERCEPT on grid much better than fleet interceptors.
---
Good bot

Just shows how supportive of a family we are :) Servant leadership.

Atleast you have a cool username &lt;3

So is horde going batty or up to bat?

Yeah, we ignore the fact how skill intensive "PL maneuvers" are lol

Why didnt you list empire cruisers, battleships??

Now that you can just buy skill injectors think of farming isk from missions or ratting as grinding EXP in a traditional MMO.  I been playing for less than a year and already have a main that can fly a Rattle Snake with max skills for everything relevant, Vexor Navy for semi afk ratting, interceptors, guristas and mordus legion frigates and cruisers, etc.  I can run missions, do burners, run 9/10 and 10/10 escalations, rat, or fly around with a fleet blowing things up.  I just bought a ton of injectors from running missions and selling faction items from the LP store.  If that got boring I could do faction warfare.  The real way to not get burned out is to get the hell out of highsec and join a null corp.  TONS  of money making opportunities in the big alliances that don't require tons of skills to easily plex your account or buy injectors.
---
Fallen? Joining Horde is like putting a super charger on your engine. You’re just mad because no matter what you do to your Power Wheels (TAPI) it will never be a real car.
---
Nice to see how positive the TAPI environment is... Maybe taking Eve a little to serious?
---
Lol
---
So are you guys officially nullsec now, or?
---
Tapi ITT: Ahahaha guys we're actually this bad
---
True haha
---
How far have the mighty fallen
---
Recon ships and cloaking, bruh. 
---
Fag.
---
as /u/tecnic1 put it, and having been both an ""FC"" and in the vicinity of IT men, honestly the reason most IT people seem like they actively want to kill you is because they're working a second job that they don't get paid for, and unlike being a skirmish FC they can't just get up and leave and have everything work
---
also unrelated, i lost my shit when hudders puffed his chest about being a skirmish FC as if that's a mark of excellency beyond being able to double click in space
---
People have d-scan bots that will cover their whole system so when you jump in a wormhole it will catch you before you can re-cloak.
---
My reaction as well. 
---
You work for CCP dont you?
---
Half a decade of wh shenanigans and it's never been a problem for me. Even if they are as big a thing as you say, nowhere near as bad when it comes to our getting content as instant local is in null. 
---
How does that make any sense
---
Definitely not as bad as null, but they do exist, which was my point.
---
Hi bby

You know, Homewood had some really damn good MtG players in the late 90s.  One of them went on to win a Pro Tour come to think of it.

---
Quick, everyone go hide in a WH system. Be very quiet. They'll never know what happened to everyone.
---
It'd be delayed for everyone as long as the player who enters is cloaked on the gate I'd say. That way players jumping in don't know the room count yet and the toons in the system don't know if someone jumped by watching local until they decloak from the jump
---
Share the love
---
The way I see it, is that fleet can't have been that important if they let Hudders of all people lead it.
---
That sounds like Eve in general tbh

I mean, it looks like he kills a whole ton more shit than he loses in those titans

---
First of all, that he did it at all is bannable, end of story.
---
Second, that he could have 'accidentally' input broadcast into chat means he was input broadcasting for other aspects of the game while in space. That means he was simultaneously controlling multiple ships with a single command, which *does* give him an advantage.
---
You're looking at this with rose-tinted glasses, and you're not going to convince anyone who's not doing the same.
---
I think we can get a better image!
---
Because WHs are the only way to legitimately hunt into K-space.  Otherwise your gang appears in intel channel 10 jumps away from your hunting grounds.
---
Oh, in this case in particular? It's a circus of hilarity and terribleness that I am glad I do not have to witness on a daily basis.
---
I was more just speaking in general, I guess. There are definitely assholes in spades in the IT field, and more than a fair share of hubris-filled arrogant assholes.
---
its also better if you mined the minerals yourself, basically free
---
Both mar5hy and delve broadcasters got reported.
---
Both mar5hy and delve broadcasters are equally easy to be confirmed to be broadcasting by using the server logs. It's not like CCP has to spend more time per person on delve broadcasters. Logs are easy objective proof in both cases.
---
The only difference is people don't make 5 threads per week and block upvote it to create turmoil about delve broadcasters. Delve broadcasters are in the majority. So typically, the side who yells the loudest wins. Which is the thing people are pointing out.

I'm aware of no such directive and don't care. There is literally no way for any player to know if you report someone for any reason unless you volunteer that information yourself.
---
Because if you don't take it too serious, and you don't get overly invested either way, it's fucking hilarious.
---
I was literally in tears watching this unfold.
---
Yes, they went on sale on the 22nd.
---
You would have my vote, blood. &lt;3
---
Then your trying to side track the discussion with a point unrelated to mar5hy getting banned.
---
Sorry to be a nuisance. It logs into Eve fine getting my location, etc and it does download the eve-scout data allowing me to shortcut via Thera, etc. I cannot get it to log into tripwire though(tripwire is running fine logged in etc). Any hints or is this functionality not available?
---
Yes I used etc too much but as its 110 degrees outside and the air conditioner is broke and I am next to a CPU/GPU/heater my brain is a bit addled.

Ran through a lowsec gate with 4 smartbombers.  Did not know how close I came to dying.
---
&gt;why is it that people are so eager to be happy that he’s banned?
---
I asked it in the post... it's still on point on what I'm trying to say
---
Right so in tripwire you'll need to go to the settings and create a user name and password because of the change to SSO, so you'll to setup a manual tripwire login to use on short circuit

Judging by your own posts, you don't actually what to know why people are happy, you just want to throw empty accusations.
---
Someone explained why it makes the happy, and you immediately dodge the topic and start trying to make it a discussion about how input broadcasting breaks the game.
---
At best, you have no idea what you're actually trying to say. At worst, you're intentionally trying to sidetrack the discussion and misrepresent statements made by others in a weak attempt to... iono, apparently suck Mar5hy dick. 
---
Just listen for gate activation. When you hear it, recall and wait to see if its a friendly or neut. Even better, have scouts multiple jumps out in all directions. Then you know they are close and you just leave when they jump in. Its what I do.

that deserved a reddit thread more than this

Your point is wrong.

If everyone you work with is an asshole - maybe you are the asshole.

which is easier:  dealing with mining/ratting drama or herding mid-level leadership?
---
The same type of thing should go for any competitive sport or Olympics. Every players should be required to roid up like everyone else. Free Lance Armstrong. Namaste.
---
Dscan bots don't really matter, imo logging activity doesn't impact much other than tracking seeds, maybe. 
---
Ratting bots on the other hand, unless they dscan at the exact right moment and even then force recon ships exist, cloaky scram means that they aren't going anywhere before cavalry arrives to blow it to pixel dust.

well your error there is comparing the CSM to the house of representatives and not the senate. I believe the Senate would be a better comparison to what the CSM should be instead of what it currently is. Say we made categories ( like states ) and each category got 2 representatives. So say HS gets 2, LS gets 2, Null gets 2, Industry gets 2, 3rd party devs get 2. I guess 10 is close enough idk
---
GF. Miss 100% of the shots you never take.

Factions are actually better if your drones can get aggroed since they have 2x the tank (i.e abyssal sites)

1.Hisec market is wide open, you haven't cornered the Plex or injectors, where the money is. The entire objective of your invasion, stated by your leader was to force cease fire in hisec and for Horde to give up over there. None of this has happened. The primary objective was a total failure. 
---
2. Turtle where? Horde lived in Geminate before you started and we still live there, so do other northern alliances, infact we rat in more areas and in more ways than before making more isk/hr with smaller investments versus before, that's mostly due to Imperium, that slowed down the whole Rorq mining thing in Geminate and burned some sov in Kalevala, but that was Imperium, not Tapi.
---
The only thing you achieved was shift Partisans sig deployement from Branch to Geminate to Kalevala. Frankly that wouldn't be needed either if Imperium wasn't around at the same time.
---
I wasn't talking about injecting yourself to fly every ship in the game, retard.
---
I was talking about skill injected rorquals and cap alts.
---
And that'd be fine. It gives scouts a purpose beyond counting local numbers while cloaked
---
If you are looking to learn you can check out Pandemic hoard. We try and run a caretakers fleet constantly 24 hours a day. The fleet will be PvP or PvE, one of our caretakers even runs two fleets at once to have both PvP and isk making covered.

There is not reqirment to join and welcome any one.

where is the video you promised?

TIL dropping 30 titans and a dozen fax machines, all of which were built by skill injected rorquals and piloted by skill injected cap alts, on the 5 man gang roaming through your space isn't an "I win button".

You have no idea how much the idea "I'm bringing a Mega" in whatever fleet is called for was in my decision making process.

Yeah, all the dudes we lost hurts, but eve is a very small place.

Besides, can only start so many wars with so many alliance leaders before you run out of places to run.

K so you pay for isk, what do you do where you need so much isk, and aren’t doing something big and isk making with the economy?
---
What affect does people buying plex for isk have on players that pay one sub and earn plex in-game to omega a second?
---
Sup dude. :)
---
This is something we have not tried before, and I'm looking forward to it.  There were other options available to us.  
---
But particularly, Test has blue standings to Goons, so it was a reason why we didn't go back to Vily, who I respect as an FC.
---
&gt; Fighters already limit the nano playstyle to the point of making all MWD ships without sig bonus impossible to fly 
---
Could you elaborate on this, as well as how it impacts something like a solo player; IE is this "HAC/100mn or go home" something that primarily applies to gangs or does it also (perhaps slightly but probably increasingly) apply to solo nano fits as well?
---
The rhetoric moves real fast

Seems like you need to ignore the ping channels too.

I wish I had/knew of more abyssal fits, but so far the only T1 cruiser fit I have is a Caracal that can run up to T3s. Check out the in game channel "Abyssal Lurkers" if you're interested in browsing different fits. Some of the cruisers are really blinged out for higher tier sites, but if you look at the T4 Gila fit in that channel, you can use that same basic fit and just un-bling some of the mods. I'm working on testing out additional T1 fits, so I'll add them there once I get them! 
---
As for abyssal guides, the [Eve Uni article](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Abyssal_Deadspace) is a good start! This is something I used to keep open while running sites until I memorized every ship and what they do. Depending on what you're flying, you can use this article to determine what to primary and kill first, and what to avoid. 
---
I mean, if you’re sucsessfully hunting them, you’re going to also be making a ton of isk from the loot they drop.

Stop enjoying it.

There's already lore for the Ammatar, so why not make them the minmatar/amarr "pirate" faction?

Maybe we could get some Cat Ears for Munnins, Feroxes and any other ships that are commonly used in fleet doctrines, that would be kinda cool actually ... I might get some.

Tbh, it’s starting to feel that way. I’ve put so much time in, but why play when someone else can break the game so badly and I have little or nothing I can do about it. 
---
Stabber, not sabre. We usually bring them along to throw at the enemy when they start trying to extract, to keep as many enemy ships on grid long enough for our bigger stuff to kill them. 
---
Shout out to Fawlty7 and TIKLE FC leadership team,
---
Getting to go along to fleets like the structure anchor defence last night was fantastic!
---
Special mention to the small gang FCs like JJ, Mek, Hellraiser and the others who consistently provide content for us outside of these big Fawlty fleets,
---
Huge thanks to the recon team who hunt down and provide fat content for us, you guys are champs, you know who you are,
---
And all my love for the bittervets who come along on these smallgang fleets helping the newbros figure out how to play this amazing game! 
---
Can we rework jaguar too?

I just dont see the objective here? They wanted to feed? Expecting titan kill? Were the 30 dreads just bait for a bigger dread bomb?

I ask myself that every time I look at the General channel in Discord.  Thankfully it's completely optional.
---
TEST Comms, forums and Discord are set up so that there are one or two free-for-all channels where people can sperg and say/do dumb shit, and then the real organizing happens in specialized sub-channels.  They're basically honey traps to segregate the Dharen Wakefields of the alliance into dino ghettos so the rest of us can keep our fucking sanity.
---
It may have been a weird diversion that had nothing to do with the core gameplay. And then there was the fact that it didn’t actually *do*  anything. But the only reason I had it disabled was because it was a total slideshow. If it ran somewhat smoothly, it would have been fun. But honestly I can’t say I even got to try out all the features because it was just unusable.
---
it's not, it's by far the easiest of the three.  Mostly because there's almost always a very clear case of right and wrong.  It's usually not very hard to tell if someone was doing something they weren't supposed to, and even easier to just point at a document and say don't do that again please read this.

Don't explore in Stain in anything other than an interceptor unless you know when to explore there. At certain times of day Stain is camped to shit, and even at other times it's still pipey as hell.

Are you aware that in Rimworld you can craft hats from the skin of your dead enemies!? 
---
Such a good game. ;)
---
Thank you for the advice. I'd certainly look into it.
---
Enjoy your paid vacation! And then come back and complain to Reddit about how hard it is being on the CSM. Then make some snarky shitpost completely unrelated to EVE with the word CSM at the very end so it somehow magically pertains to this subreddit and get Reddit gold for it.

Bat mostly folded into other PL corps after their CEO left, and a few of them who didn’t want to go that route decided to join horde instead. It’s not like PL is bleeding members, they’re just consolidating, and the people who were already mostly inactive are going with the Corp into Horde to try something different.

Never expected to see you in a rorqual

That's like saying everyone in California GTS to vote for each candidate twenty times

Yea. It'll start with them using *"but we're hunting bots!"* to excuse input-broadcasting, but before long we'll have full fledged anti-botting combat bots running wild. Soon after there will be no room for actual players in the game, and we'll all just have to sit back and watch EVE become 100% automated as armies of bots fight each other, one side pretending to be "anti-botting" while the other defend the remnants of the current krabbing bot epidemic.
---
Why the down votes if true?
---
How are you going to find them without probes? The second they see probes within a few AU they can warp off and cloak up. Sure, you can camp the site and see if/when they come back, but that’s not too much easier than setting up a log off trap in null. 
---
Looks to be 13 sov structures?
---
I guess whether or not that's impressive depends on what kind of opposition they put up. Was it just coordinated ninja-entosising of some ADM 1 systems in an off TZ, or was there some sort of fight involved?
---
At least they didnt generate theoretical infinite wealth from nothing like bots. Lol
---
This sub is full of bot apologists who shit on Olmeca and mar5hy any time they talk about things like what they’re doing.

The campers aren’t usually a problem if you know what you’re doing. Gatecamps should be trivial to dodge if you have covops cloak. Drag bubbles won’t get you unless you’re extremely lazy and go gate to gate. And if you want to know if those two people in local are cloaked in the site, look them up on zkill. If they’re campers, set them red to save time the next time you cross them. 
---
The real problem is other explorers. I basically only bother exploring late USTZ, after most Americans and all the Euros are asleep. Before then there is far too much competition for sites, and even if you do find one, someone from any of the Stain alliances just has to start probing to force you out, because you can’t assume he doesn’t have backup. Doesn’t matter if you’re a imicus or combat fit astero, letting a heron from Good Sax get in scram range is probably going to be a death sentence.

Damnit you posted while I was writing up an AAR Post :(  
---
Setup: Waffles anchored a Raitaru off the 9UY Keepstar, being red to Provi-Bloc it was acceptable to remove the structure without violating NRDS.
---
Defenders: Rekking Crew formed an Ishtar fleet and small Retribution fleet
---
Aggressors: Provi-Bloc formed Carriers and Eagle fleet with Tengu logi  
---
AAR:
---
* Provi carriers slow boated fighters 1100km from the Keepstar to the Raitaru pausing it only 1 minute and 30 seconds into the fight (yay you didn't miss the timer!)
---
* RC Retribution fleet lands and starts defanging
---
* RC Ishtars land a couple minutes later to also defang
---
* Provi undocks eagle fleet and warps to Raitaru
---
* Fight ensues with the Ishtar fleet loosing VNI's but destroying the eagle fleet
---
* Eagles mostly die or warp away
---
* Provi feeds fighters into the Raitaru to keep killing it
---
* Ishtars and Retris try to defang but its slow going without Medium drones and limited webs
---
* Provi reships to Machs with Triage
---
* Ishtars disengage and go home as the Mach's warp in
---
* Machs finish the last sliver of the Raitaru which was going to die to fighters anyways
---
* Provi wins the objective

---
Hmmm dunno if blind or stupid
---
Okay, I’m going to at least try to be unbiased, unlike everyone else here, who is just trying to recruit you, apparently. 
---
I’ll start with Horde, since I know the most about them. We live in geminate, which is the most active region for pvp by quite a bit. So, tons of content and fights to be had pretty much 24/7 just by being in standing fleet, in addition to all the normal fleets we have. 
---
As long as you aren’t into t2 cruisers, I’d say most of what we fly is Caldari. For t2 cruisers and up we really use everything but Caldari, unfortunately. The exceptions would be gilas and Basilisks, but those aren’t too common. 
---
For Brave, they are kind of like us in a lot of ways. We don’t really have the emphasis on ‘stay classy’ that they do, but in practice I our rules are pretty much the same, just don’t say slurs on comms and you’re probably good. And while they do have lots of content coming to them in catch, it’s not going to be close to as much as there is in Geminate, and you can verify this just by looking at dotlan. However, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, fewer enemies means safer krabbing. I won’t deny that horde probably has the least safest space for pve. 
---
Next is KarmaFleet. As part of goons, you get access to the safest ratting space in Eve, possibly including hisec. However, this means you’ll need to go out on organized fleets to get content, less room for messing around in a standing fleet doing whatever you want. Also, goons will have the best SRP program, while Horde will have the worst, and Brave will be somewhere in the middle yet again. 
---
Really, none are bad, they just offer slightly different things. 
---
C3 Gila ratting is very possible, however is bad with just one gila. It is best done as part of a group of 3+, as your dps is quite low, and your tank will not be pressured so much as they switch and sometimes split damage.

When people say passive regen, its sometimes confused that passive is the opposite of active, and it isn't quite.   
---
Active - Your tank uses a repair module for max EHP/s  
---
Buffer - Your tank uses extenders or plate for max EHP
---
Regen - Your tank uses enhanced shield replenishment modules for max EHP/s
---
Passive - Your tank does not rely on capacitor  
---
In a perfect world 'active tank' would mean a tank that relied on cap (so an ASB would not be active) and the opposite of passive would be something like 'boosting'. In any case, the gila fit linked is passive regen as it does not rely on cap and maximizes ehp/s.   
---
Your fit would be fine with a max skill toon, but many C3 runners wouldn't have that so a slightly blinged tank is good. If you are doing c3 sites solo/unmultiboxed then I would recommend a passive regen rattle instead

Last Thursday add breakfast food development team decided to install a new Waffle House raitaru in order to feed the pilots of Providence &amp; surrounding area. 
---
Unfortunately this has angered the Inhabitants of Provi and forced an attempt to destroy this expansion of our well known cultural Institution. 
---
With information of this destructive act being forwarded too the proper authorities, Waffles., Calsf, HTP, &amp; RC Decided it was best to form up to try and disperse the hostile crowd. The resulting engagement between both parties resulted in a 500 KM+ Trail of Tears of Providence Eagles In the direction of their Keepstar. During this engagement Fighters deployed from carriers stationed on the Keepstar where consistently streaming over to the raitaru battle to pause said raitaru. This combined with the Provi reship in to machariels led to a Decision to let this ratitaru be destroyed.

I would strongly recommend fuelling your structure as there are multiple groups that go around destroying everything that is low power.

The way I look at it,  Eve pvp is like going out for a fun evening. Nice dinner maybe a movie or something. You have to do work to be able to afford to do it. Can’t just do the enjoyable activities without putting work in. 
---
Other mmo’s IMO are like buying a car. Once you get it, it’s yours to enjoy when ever you want. When I used to play wow I would spend all my time in pvp. You could have no in game income and still do nothing but pvp. Didn’t have to worry about buying new gear every time you died. 
---
This is just my opinion though. It’s more of a second life than a game really 
---
Mar5hy isn't banned, nobody has to eat their hat.

You dont NEED official numbers from CCP to know that there are plenty of alpha players around.. do you currently play the game? If so, just talk to random people who you meet in various parts of the game, I think you'll be surprised at how many are alphas
---
I pvp once a month so that I don't get kicked from my corp, so i can use their infrastructure. participating once a month in a pointless pvp fleet is a lot less hassle than maintaining my own structures etc.

beyond that, pvp is a complete irrelevance.

Yes I'm starting to understand this. But let me ask you this, why am I penalized for doing the activity I find the most fun in the game, whereas every single other thing I COULD be doing(Mining, Exploration, Missions, Industry) makes money, but PvP loses money?
---
I don't blame you. There's really no incentive for you to PvP. 
---
chrrrRRRRRRBZZZZZzzzz
---
Yeah, the cycle of life, the difference is PL aspired to be THE dominating force, they earned it, kept it and eventually lost it.
---
Same for Goons, they've earned and lost it.
---
PL and Goons went for the very top spot, they got it, and here lies the difference between them and TAPI. 
---
For the past few years TESTs aspirations have been at best to be the side kick of either Goons or PL, while claiming to be the most hardened force in the game and stronk independent alliance. 
---
Sad thing is TAPI has the member capacity and capability to go for it. Just that there is lack of testicular fortitude in the leadership to aim for the #1 spot. 
---
Thats just input-broadcasting, man. No biggie.
---
Generally you can tank a ship one of three ways - active,  passive or buffer. When you're fitting a ship you would usually look at the bonuses and figure out what you plan to do with the ship to decide which of those methods will work best. You don't want to combine methods, because instead of doing one thing really well (repping hard with active tank or having a huge buffer to chew through) you end up doing two things really poorly... and then you die in a Leshak to a Wolf. There are some very niche cases where you will want to dual tank something, and that is usually something like a Titan.   
---
Here's some examples of better fits for the same ship so you can see what I mean:  
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74744963/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74744963/) \- Buffer tank. Probably not a solo ship, probably going to get reps from logistics. The extra buffer means it will survive longer to catch reps.   
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74675599/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74675599/) \- Active tank. Probably a small gang or solo ship. Notice the two Large Armor Repairers and the Nano Pump Rig which boosts repair amount. The resist mods and the Reactive Armor Hardener make the reppers more effective. 
---
You're not penalized by the game.
---
You're penalizing yourself. 
---
Stop putting so much value on the isk you're making per hour. Start putting more value on doing things you enjoy.
---
Until you drop that never ending desire to always be looking at how much money you're making every minute you play the game, you'll always feel like you're penalizing yourself.
---
Would seriously fuck with stainguy can't put in a ls gate if there's no ls
---
3Tears, Sean Blair, KlimachRus, Admiral Wheeler I'm sure i forgot a few.
---
Shit I never thought would happen for 500 please.
---
This one I would argue is... much worse... I'm tempted to say it has to be a meme of some kind.  
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74765994/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74765994/)
---
Yeah, that's why we have these standards.  We don't want to devolve into "if it was important they would have pinged 14 times".
---
Uhh what? Huge part of WH income is blue tags, which are absolutely a faucet.
---
Theoretically, Faction Warfare should provide PVP incentives for killing opposing militia members. Alas, we are stuck with having to make money to spend money.
---
actually they, and we, went to kill some jackdaw gang first.. god bless welpsquad
---
This is the lamest meta in this game currently.
---
kekeke on being some nullbear degenerate needing 4 accs to accomplish that in the least efficient way possible. also lmbo for still playing this shitty game in tyool 2019. pod urself irl (and ig ofc).
---
So IOW if you sacrifice literally every aspect of the Drekavac to fit max tank you can get giggle-grade buffer.
---
That... just what even the fuck is this shit. Nobody's going to fly something that godawful fuckstupid. The damage is dogshit and the projection only passable because the Veles faction variant has a little more optimal and you threw TCs at it.
---
Incidentally this claim:
---
&gt; Drek can hit 602k without slaves or abyssal plates
---
Does not seem quite true; even with a mindlinked Damnation providing both links and heating the hardeners, and the slew of X-type hardeners and A-type EANMs, *and* an 8% armor implant, it maxes out at 566k EHP before adding in HG Slaves.
---
If you're chaining links off another Drekavac it's only 509k EHP, though this is with mindlinks rather than 8% armor HP implants. Still A-type EANMs and overheated X-type hardeners.
---
Crazy sure, but considering it's a \~2.5 billion ISK fit I'm not terribly surprised. A- hilariously slightly cheaper- Absolution fit that's similar gets 549k EHP, and the main limit on it is that the CPU is very tight, and so precludes the use of dual A-type *EANMs*, instead having to substitute one EANM for an ANP- also A-type.
---
Incidentally if you throw in HG Slaves, 8% armor implant, a slightly altered variant of the fit you linked (the only real difference is dropping the link because if you're rolling heavy like this you can bring a Damnation to be your link bitch), and a mindlinked Damnation, it's still only 863k EHP. If you get a max armor HP roll abyssal plate it's 898k EHP.
---
Looks like this:
---
&gt; pass's the 1m mark with slave and abyssal plate.
---
is wrong too!
---
In any case I don't see the problem here. Aside from why anyone would use such a retarded superbrick the level of investment required to actually *get* that level of superbrick is so enormous (you're probably looking at 20 billion easy for 2 HG Slave pods, a brick Damnation to be the link bitch and *one* brick Drekavac that will do... nothing except die *really really slowly*) is so monumental as to be impractical for the things the Drekavac is *actually good at*.
---
Which involves lots of small gang shit, and very little of toting around a pocket Damnation or hauling around a Titan just for its phenomena generator.
---
Incidentally I'm not sure how EFT is giving \~870k EHP for a Drekavac with both link *effects* active on it while HG Slaved with mindlinks and heat, I seem to be getting \~807k EHP in Pyfa for two mindlinked Drekavacs chaining command burst bonuses on each other while Slaved with a max-armor-HP roll abyssal plate.
---
Not sure WTF is going on with your EFT there.
---
&gt; As for the leshak, dont forget you can boost it with a dda since you have heavies to use and abyssals, pyro, implants and heat. 
---
Oh so it's definitely a shitfit then.
---
Look with four *max-roll* abyssal radsinks, Occult T2 damage ammo, Augmented Ogres and a faction DDA, *and* the 7% RoF implant, *and* Pyro 4, *and* heat, you get 4081 DPS.
---
Yes, this is a lot. Yes it is technically higher than (most) HAW dreads using faction ammo so that they can actually track shit and while not heating. Of course the typical quad BCU HAW Phoenix is \~3900 DPS *cold* with faction torpedoes so... the best HAW dread is still the best it looks like.
---
Also that's probably on the order of 10-15 billion ISK invested into the Leshak to get those results, between 4 max-roll abyssal radsinks and the Pashan's Turret Customization Mindlink.
---
Incidentally that fit is dogshit for anything beyond *maybe* a hyperbling Incursion fit. So yeah you aren't going to use that in actual PvP unless you're a tomato. Going for a much more conservative (so you can actually fit some *tank* to not die to a stiff breeze) dual max-roll abyssal radsinks, Pashan's, and Pyro 4, you get \~3300 DPS heated with Occult.
---
Impressive but that's after \~102 seconds of spool time, and it isn't sustainable at all- eventually you either burn out or you stop heating. A HAW Rev or HAW Moros (and if I had to guess, HAW Nag) can push 2.8-3k DPS cold pretty easily, to say nothing of the incredible 3900 DPS cold HAW Phoenix.
---
Other problems:
---
\- good luck consistently getting max-roll abyssal mods, especially if you want to pretend to have a doctrine fit for this that goes beyond "if you have abyssal mods fit them, otherwise use T2"
---
\- that's a 5 billion ISK implant just to get maximum RoF to maximize DPS. Pod already costs more than a HAW dread
---
\- have fun wasting a slot on the DDA; this isn't incursions boyo, we need more than just max-DPS-while-still-having-enough-just-enough-resists-to-catch-reps
---
Like what kind of shit would you use that for? If you're throwing enough at a Leshak to make it rival an unheated HAW dread then I can't help but think that the tank on it is going to be shit and it'll die like a bitch to the first carrier that looks at it funny.
---
fookin' wot
---
The extra 5% carried across the fleet can make a big difference 
---
 here's a [bot](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114038301), he was in [ranger regiment](https://zkillboard.com/kill/70940721/), then it was in [goons](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73015920/ ), and then headed to [init's botting ring](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73134976).  He's now in red alliance. The fact that goons didn't report him and allowed him to continue botting in other alliances is honestly hilarious. 
---
Like I said, don’t think of it as a game. In real life you can’t spend all of your time having fun. You have to do something to enable you to have that enjoyment. Games like WOW are designed to get you into action ASAP. Eve pvp is something you have to invest in. Obviously there are ways to spend more time in pvp than pve. You just have to find a balance between the two that you can live with. I normally pvp in frigs in lowsec so Most of my fits won’t cost more than 20 mil. If I spend 1 day a week ratting or salvaging. I can fund my operation easily. Could probably do it exploring sites as-well if that’s further up your ally 
---
Or if you really can’t stand the thought of mindless pve. Just buy plex and fund your adventure that way
---
Somebody's butthurt? Did you message Brisc with your contact information?
---
I swear I'm not trying to be a dick or say you're opinion is wrong, but you're looking at it the wrong way. The main incentive to PvP in Eve is **fun!** I know it may sound cheesy but it's true. 
---
But aside from that, here are some other incentives:
---
* **Objective** 
---
* **Strategic**
---
* **Safety**
---
* **Loot**
---
There are plenty of incentives! If you're trying to get money from PvP, you can definitely do it, it just sounds like you're doing it wrong. [This guy made over 15 billion ISK from PvP!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfhdtOgd7m8&amp;t=24s) Which you can actually check the Zkillboards to validate yourself if you need too. Also another thing to note **- figure out your logistics.** Eve is not your typical run and gun X up and shoot something kinda game. Every single item you use to kill is built and sold by players, and it can't just appear out of thin air where you want it to be ready! Either get a JF alt or be in a group that handles that stuff! Me personally, I hate the thought of someone doing something I can do, so I got a JF alt to bring in everything I need and I seed it in NPC stations all around lowsec. 
---
I PvP for fun. Even after all of these years, I still suck at it, but I try and I still get the shakes during a fight. You'll usually find that Eve players reminsce on fights they've had because of how much fun/how memorable they were. 
---
If you start finding more high-value targets you will get better loot from them and see much better isk return for your time. There's plenty of people that support their gameplay through pvp activities. For example MasL, one of the big Blops hotdroppers, went on the record in an interview for one of the eve news websites that he hotdropped people for isk, to be able to kill them and steal their shiny mods. Evictions in wormhole space is another example, when you go into someone's wormhole knock them over and take all their stuff. You just have to find one of those activities that works for you, and know what you're doing. There's plenty of incentive to pvp. 
---
Bots farm isk, you buy plex off ccp and sell it to botters for isk. You are supporting them directly.
---
Did someone get banned recently for that? while this person from goons, wonder why one person is banned, and the other is let go? Let's ask the Goons council of Stellar Management.
---
I thought hord had their own forum ?
---
Please don't be as retard as goon, bragging over irrelevant details to the whole subreddit.
---
Just buff faction guns and make them pretty much necessary for pvp fits and modify their cost. Example small weapons 5-6mil medium weapons should be 8ish mil a pop large 15ish etc. That way any pvp target with weapons will drop something decent. If they didn't have the weapons then you probably just steam rolled them anyways so who cares.
---
Probably because the progression system of EVE are not compatible with PVP
---
Yes we will often hear some new comers had a lot of fun just doing cheap frigate PVP in low-sec, but that's it, they belong to a rare species.
---
We hear much more people asking for newbie grinding advices than PvP fitting suggestions.
---
Probably 95% of the new players, which want to survive within EVE's sandbox, have to go through months, if not years of PVE/mining grind to accumulate enough asset and skill points.
---
Because of the economic structure New Eden has been set into since the day it was born, every isk, every Trititanium was actively produced(either by players or illegal bots), everything ingame is tagged with a certain value acknowledged, admitted and protected by the entire ecosystem.
---
Unlike many other games use a "direct" P2W or riskless PVP model, despite in many situations losing a 300m cruiser doesn't seem to be a big deal from a $ perspective, because of the entire economic system behind every ship, every module that was lost, they possessed more value in players' eyes.
---
Long story short, the economic system of EVE essentially turned many players into hoarders
---
overrated.
---
I haven't been there in about 5 years now since I don't live in Chicago anymore but if they haven't changed the recipe then I stand by my recommendation 100%.
---
everything is going to be ok
---
2019-01-23 18:56:43: [TEST] Farmstink:this isnt about dunking nerds, its about winning the high sec war and demoralizing nc and horde from showing up here.
---
Good luck tackling orthrus with those stats. Ceptors are fine (except crow), leave them alone.
---
you´re an idiot. dude is completely right. eve was P2W even with just PLEX, multiboxing and the character bazar. with injectors it´s probably one of the most blatant P2W schemes currently on the market. P2W in eve does not mean not getting your ships blown up. 
---
Just stop and ask the locals for directions. What's the worst that could happen? 
---
killing people is fun
---
that people still don´t get that the P2W argument in eve is not about frigates winning against battleships in tyool 2019 boggles the mind. 
---

Get into hunting blinged pver's, you can do it with t1 cruisers, and example would be https://zkillboard.com/kill/71103562/. 30 mil investment, 200m payout
---
people who bait in ships in highsec are usually blinged, example is https://zkillboard.com/kill/68270998/
---
the problem with titles and shit is you wind up with someone unloading 400 t1 fit frigates from multiple bowheads, and they'll be the ones to get it.
---
I think some of the reward is the actual killmail, i know i've had more fun hunting ships barely worth anything if it actually took me a while to catch it. That and the killmark that pops up on your ship.  Or the salt you get from whoever you killed.
---
Yeah? Well ur mom was P2W even without PLEX, multiboxing and character bazar. With injectors this isn't changed much.
---
No, go away.
---
Most people don't enjoy mining/exploration/missions/industry. They do it to get money to PVP. If you could make money reliably by PVPing then the economy would completely collapse. What makes PVP in eve so special is the real risk of loss. It makes losing feel worse and winning feel better. It's why everyone gets so serious and hyped about trapping supercapitals.
---
I don't know who should be more embarrassed, Bat Country or PL..

Touche. You are correct. the solar cell and 1 of each of the data &amp; relic sites have a scram frigate in the first wave as trigger and sometimes in the 3rd wave.  details.
---
I would have thought it would be obvious the only site worth doing is the Fortification Frontier.  Especially in a questionable fit.  Lowest dps, best payout, no scram. webs can be primaried (except 2nd wave where you have to keep one since they're trigger)
---
They are cloaked.
---
Members of Providence should have a say in the rules! :C
---
CCP notices your space, just to kill it.
---
:L
---
I hope this wins an /r/eve 2019 best of for something
---
Most people here will tell you should think about adjusting your attitude. But in the end they´re just telling you to overlook shitty game design and serious flaws within the game. Today there is no incentive to PvP. Besides some boring af niches like Abyssals and ganking. Neither for money, nor space, nor assets. Wasn´t always like that but CCP has been dropping the ball time after time again for close to a decade now while the playerbase devolved into a bunch of merry krabs. I get where you´re coming from, but if you want to play Eve for the PvP you´re way late. You already got the core problems this game has been suffering from after a few months. And that won´t change, so better stop wasting your time right now.
---
Wait..  this isn't fawltys alt account
---
I enjoyed that video :) especially the head shot to the harpy's!
---
It seems from the video and assuming that these are all the major engagements to date that some Legacy alliances have been forming to oppose seem to be losing most of the battles. Is this correct and I wonder if someone could answer /confirm and who is from the invaders point of view.
---
I simply love the tactical and strategical warfare that this game allows us players to enact and cannot wait for more videos like this documenting the major battles of the coalitions or alliances campaigns in Eve.
---
More videos like this please from other military campaigns.

Wait, elo cant tackle a rorq in delve 3 days in a row? 10/10 would belive.

---
Don't try to set up by yourself. EVE isn't the kind of game that is very kind to people trying to do their own thing when inexperienced. I recommend joining someone of medium size or higher with some reputation, learning space, then starting your own thing if you still want to.
---
OK, but that rant doesn't shock me, and I don't care what he said.  If people need to be "ordered" to stop being retarded in ways they'll understand, I'm honestly pleased as piss about that. A lot of people are complaining and reporting and backbiting and it's pretty fucking toxic. Everyone in Eve has by now been reported, and if CCP hasn't banned the dude you see in space, there's a reason for that. You dopes will *never* truly know what that reason is, so shut the fuck up and play. That's what I heard there, and whether anyone likes it or not he's right. This isn't just bad for us, it's bad for the game.
---
Now, what do you think is more likely:
---
a) CCP is ignoring "obvious" bots at the behest of a rich and populous player alliance that's worried about their fake milk money.
---
or
---
b) A rich and populous player alliance is concerned that people aren't getting along because of yet another internet spaceship hysteria and it's really fucking irritating.

You will get evicted from a C2 if you are a pansy and don't take fights for a long period of time. People will drop in 100 T3s just to tell you what they think of you.
---
So if you're in a C2 and don't want to risk that, I'd say get ready to brawl with neighbors or get ready to feed.
---
I mean, it's a spaceship game- No need to take it super-special-seriously all the time. 
---
Yes there is. Fun and tears. It has a cost to get this enjoyment, but you can make money easy (Plex). The first time you get some hate mail when you've killed somebody you'll understand.
---
I've seen your Pustin chat- It's no better mate
---
The playerbase collectively talking themselves into believing that things like PLEX, multiboxing and now injectors are not pay to win because a frigate can still kill a battleship - that, my friend, is a meme.  
---
Throwing additional money at this game will grant you benefits and advantages over the people who don´t that would make even the most blatant P2W games blush.

Delve

You seem to be dumb

unless they assist another player who shot rats, i guess? to prevent logi to warp in after the dps and be safe
---
What corp?
---
As u/Spazzoni also said already, Dreddit is recruiting.  
---
Dreddit is standing at the core and is the founding corporation of Test Alliance Please Ignore.  
---
The corporation was created in Reddit [many years ago](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/culture:history) and thus, is open to all Reddit users who have a reasonably active account.  
---
We are a really laid-back corporation, home to both new players and proven veterans.  The activity requirements are low and not much is required of the members other then actively participating in daily life in the corporation and alliance ecosystems, be that on forums/discord or in-game.   
---
We offer everything from Frigate brawl fleets to super-capital fights all through New Eden. We also have dedicated special interest groups that specialize in small-gank PVP, bombing fleets, structure bashing and more.  
---
In addition, we have an active and well organised mentoring program so, once you are in, a more experienced member can be assigned to assist you with any help you might need.  He (or she) will mentor you and guide you through the whole process of becoming the pilot you are meant to be.   
---
If this sounds like your kind of thing, drop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eeCX7ch) or check our Test Alliance [Wiki page](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/corps:dreddit:joining) for joining.   
---
Looking forward to flying with you soon o7  
---
p.s. As a relatively new dude myself (although biased) I can definitely say that both the fun community and mentoring helped me immensely to find my footings in the game and figure "what is fun for me". I have been where you are right now where I just wanted to quit and Dreddit helped me find my spot in New Eden.
---
This is dumb as shit. Interceptors are fine as they are.
---
[uh oh I see what you did there](https://i.imgur.com/fRUv53i.png)
---
Not if their in multiple channels together its not. We have fleets just for ratters and miners  and coms channels to go with those fleets, intel of reds nearby is relayed in voice as well as corp, intel and fleet chat channels. There are warnings all over the place when reds go raoming in our space.
---
El'Miner killmails will show up in red from now on
---
we have standards too
---
smallgang usually gets 3-5 pings, stratops get pinged until there are enough dudes. jf runs get pinged once every couple of hours
---
and jeffraider pings for madden as much as he wants
---
i do not dispute your proof!

i was watching it in a windowed browser and it looked fine. i too see what you see when i fullscreen it XD

Hello there.  
---
Dreddit (the core and founding member of Test Alliance Please Ignore) is recruiting.  
---
We are a corporation made by Redditors [many moons ago](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/culture:history) and thus, are always open to more relatively active Reddit bros joining our ranks.  
---
We have no high activity requirements and just being an active member of the Corporation/Alliance community is enough to earn you your spot. We are thus, a laid-back bunch of newbros and ^((salty)) veterans looking to have fun and enjoy our time in the game.  
---
We do a lot of PVP and have a great home region in Esoteria where you can mine, explore or build stuff in between aggressive and defensive fleets all through High Sec, Low Sec and Null Sec. 
---
If you also feel you need help setting up, finding your footing in PVP or pretty much anything game related (or life related), we have a dedicated mentoring program that you will also appreciate.

Your connection can go by different route. 
---
clubbing idiots is reason enough to pvp, plus pve is so shitty you should want to do anything but more of it
---
seems like 9uy is the hottest place to be right now
---
He's a karmafleet mouthbreather that unironically believes the empire builder meme
---
looks like crippling social problems too I guess
---
Looks like a retirement move by bat country. Very good dudes but they're mostly old guard iirc.
---
i think allowing botting would be a good thing, and just remove local
---
Neither.
---
So like while I was in goons I had the biggest hard on for fawlty. Especially since Aussie accents are a huge fucking turn on to me.
---
/u/ccp_falcon i don't know why people are downvoting this - **but maybe your network guys want to look at it**
---
Yeahhhhhhhh
---
Will you accept me? I never play and have been inactivity purged from SNIGG two or three times.
---
As you can see my resume is flawless.
---
Also hi Mari 
---
i ran one, i've not been experiencing any issues and do not go through this domain.
---
i just would stuff it into the "wormholers like it but so does null sometimes" corner w/ the prospect and that other T2 Mining frig 
---
Genuinely didn’t know you could drop an mtu in abyssal space. Thanks for that.
---
 &gt;i don't know why people are downvoting this
---
:doubt:
---
Thanks.         
---
Either.
---
Thanks for all the invites guys :) Much appreciated.
---
yes, and if [Raw Damage taken &lt; Effective HP] how is it dead? EHP is your ships hitpoints w/ resists in mind, and as i said the leshak had 12k more EHP (EFT btw, not pyfa so the rep is not accounted for) than he had taken damage   
---
wich is why i assumed he was afk w/ drones out
---
Tf is a sport pepper? 
---
I sort of agree with this, it might balance things a bit, but im not sure how much of the value is in salvage.
---
Some people don't have issues, some have havy issues while playing eve.      
---
If this relates to bad routers before CCP it need to be solved in a totally different way.         
---
I checked this route for a while and in few hours of check i didn't have any loss and no issues ingame, but when the "hickup" started eve had didn't do well.       
---
I mean you just close down the Discord/mute eve stuff when you are busy?????
---
What makes mining drama the hardest? All you need is a screenshot of someone mining something else while there's still ochre visible on the ss?
---
Yes, sorry early morning posting.
---
I mean it doesn't just instantly deposit isk in to your wallet like bounties.
---
true
---
Killed a retribution 1v1 last night in hyperion. Just sitting there minding my own business baiting provi and this random little ballsy bastard just goes for it. Not gonna lie, it was satisfying af when it finally exploded 10 mins later.
---
I too recall my drones when intel says baddies are nearby, thereofore i am a bot  
---
I also do the sinful practice of being 6~8km away from a rock so my drones bounce back and forth w/o orbiting the ore/ice rock to give me optimum yield, therefore i am a bot 
---
Downvoted for getting my hopes up only to waste my mobile data. 
---
Jk have an upboat, dick

---
That translates to: "Random scrambled letters". 
---
Have you ever considered just opening a support ticket, reddit is not the place to get help.
---
afaik there is only a limited number of plex, so bots buying and keeping it for any lengh of time is reducing the number of plex, raising the price in return 
---
Havens belong to VNI's fuck you
---
Other subs have done it to great effect. Deliver and get unbanned, ezpz
---
Hilmar DGAF any more, he's after a payday. New leadership pls
---
But it looks the same. Regroup -&gt; every ship starts to align. This takes a few seconds - enough time to give them warp commands individually. Then they will all warp at the same time, because they started to align at the same time.
---
What if he wasn't banned for input broadcasting but RMT? 
---
have you checked to make sure your internet is on?
---
Ask your best friend Midge.
---
Provibloc are amazing &lt;3
---
Anywhere but your mothers basement.. oh. Wait.. nullsec?
---
the same apoc crew that you have been chasing and reporting is back up and running, now in Stayme
---
rip my bad. will edit
---
I think this is more of a crowdsourcing PSA than a support issue.
---
Other than detesting small talk, I have no social problems what so ever.
---
Also, nobody else has built an empire so it's not really a meme. Except maybe legacy.
---
Because he botted?
---
Fair enough. But you must know, a bunch of the rest of us do find this pretty funny.
---
Yeah bud, go wander in known botlands and tell me they are all real players farming their isk (a few examples of known botting regions : KWG who harbours a shitload of bots and pays enormous amount of isk to half the map to stay under radar, Drone region where you find instawarping VNI's that all orbit the POS stick waiting for the local to clear or carriers that do exactly the same than their VNI friends, Fountain who's full of VNI/gila bots that have the same exact behavior than in dronelands... how curious right?).   
---
Shortcuts? yeah, could be for one of two VNI's that are actually behind their screen but realistically, it's just automated behavior or input broadcasting, both are forbidden by the EULA. But i guess that when you don't have 30k bees spamming IG report/doing daily reddit posts, CCP doesn't care that much.   
---
I was a bit sceptical at first, then i made my own idea roaming through our NS static, go out of your mining anom and see for yourself :/ 
---
So he's a blue?
---
That's too bad. I was thinking I'd just found an incentive to PVP.
---
I talked to my ISP ... like what CCP can do about it ? 
---
Quite probably they don't even have to see the issue, also this is not to get help but trace if more people with issues have similar route.     
---
      
---
I'd dropped out of Eve before it left Goonswarm, and quit the game when they joined PL in 2015. I got married, had a kid, maybe another on the way.
---
My ships are still stocked somewhere, and I;m hoping my kids will be old enough one day to get a chance to use them. Maybe I'll be back then too.
---
Good luck everyone. 
---
Nobody has built an empire. You're clicking a rock and then clicking F1. Plenty of people pvp this way, but EVERYONE who mines, mines this way. And your attitude is shit, for someone who thinks he's built an empire, you sure have no interest in defending it. If you weren't a blue I'd cloaky camp and gank your corp for at least a month for this kind of crap. Nobody likes someone who does the bare minimum to not get kicked.
---
This is a great way to say there is little incentive to PvP and is blatantly dishonest. (directing a month old player to go PvP in the abyss where fits and implants are generally 5b+ and will be lost eventually if not immediately through no fault of your own)
---
Generally speaking, Eve in it's current state is terrible, especially for new players.
---
The economy is trashed, ISK inflation is at it's height, and the PvP meta is who has the bigger dick on the otherside of the cyno. 
---
I hope you like flying frigs, because that's about the only thing that maybe won't get dropped on... actually wait no, we dropped on an AF gang last week...
---
Anyways, balance is slow and near non-existant. I would stay away from the game until another big release that might add what you're looking for. Or you can go to WH space, but again you lack the SP to do anything there right now. However, that will undoubtedly be where you find an Eve that is fun.
---
I live in Null and really only stay here because I have made a lot of friends, and they are essentially the only reason I log in. 
---
Damn some is pretty bored to spend time writing this 
---
MFW Nestor no cloak bonus.
---
:(
---
&gt; Other than detesting small talk, I have no social problems what so ever.  
---
lmao
---
I still want my justice
---
Poor newbro here please send care package.
---
&gt;2019-01-23 18:57:15: Kyle Sev:I just got back from a fucking funeral and this chat is more depressing
---
lol
---
That's a complaint I simply can't understand.
---
I never bought any skins - I don't care about the colour of my ship. If making skins is profitable for CCP, that's great for me. Other people are paying for my game, then.
---
It does the Same Thing in principle as Input broadcasting. 1 Guy reporting Intel, or 1 Input, doing the work for X accounts
---
He got banned for RMT tho
---
Can you do a traceroute to eveonline.com?
---
Only the start that's one day come back in a couple of weeks they fuck with the wrong beee's nest and have way to much sov, It will be deleted soon. Hope skill U has lots of ihub's cause they are going to need them.  
---
Mari is too busy planting his British flag in the portly young ladies of the colonies.
---
Overqualified if anything.
---
Had that problem on a new laptop, had to download drivers from the manufactor that made the network card. 
---
Problem was that Windows installed a old "windows approved" driver for the hardware, and this driver was 8 years old.
---
I had internet connection, it just failed when i ran some games. After i installed the manufactor's driver it worked.
---
bear in mind that the l4x fight was autz and nc and pl are both super eutz focused
---
that said yea horde super numbers are 💪💪
---
Because /R/eve is a subreddit control by The Imperium right ? 
---
Drone regions NPC null should solve a lot of problems.
---
Rancer as NPC null would be fun though.
---
pls no
---
No, Its easy to farm here ... you just have to say the magic word "Rorqual" and you will get salt from all involved XD
---
Having to deal with Hudders retarded ass in 2019, lol.
---
Sounds about right.
---
Small talk is boring. I don't give a fuck how your weekend was, or about your rugrats. If you have Some thing interesting to say, I'm all ears.
---
I'm taking this blasphemy straight to Dran
---
Tourist.
---
Have you considered not posting at all.
---
He is not banned, you are straight out lying or making up facts to push a narrative or following what the koolaid tells ya ...
---
I don't pretend I've built fuck all.
---
I make no secret that I'm only here to use the infrastructure. And I do what is asked of me in exchange for that. 
---
The cerebral accelerators are a hidden login bonus, too.

I too make retarded shit up so daddy will notice me 
---
Kind of was the opposite for me while in TEST tbh. Matalok, Aevum, and Twizted were all super cool people and other than this one time that Durr and Twizted had a slapfight about transferring sov to FA, I didn't really have any interactions that made me not want to deal with them.
---
Implying there is a PL subcap fleet left to bridge....
---
Flair exposes most risk averse playstyle ever happened outside station trading without undocking
---
Hi friend. Hudders is absolutely a fucking retard. This shouldn't surprise anyone anymore.
---
Some People think kill boards matter.
---
Some People think a fake made up currency will bring you happiness and impress people.
---
Some People think they are elite by winning in 400 v 5 fights.
---
Tldr : Some People are morons.
---
they have to be careful, eve lore is fairly deep and made by scandinavian space nerds (please dont let PA read the Minmatarr lore and redcon all the bad things, we need fucked up space people) 
---
no sergaljerk disbanded, lumpy is only... 50% furry (mainly bc of the fox icon attracting them) 
---
Its like these retards genuinely pretend there could be other outcomes 
---
what it needs is codemonkeys to carfully unwrangle the wet code spagetti and make the game run well on the servers and client 
---
No questions just wanted to say I liked your presentation at Vegas. I understand that need to move around to keep the game interesting. Staying in a stagnant state makes you not play.
---
Kill blingier ships, make more ISK.
---
its almost like they've been doing that since 2015
---
If you want to become a massive spodbrain krab join goons
---
If you want to get farmed join brave
---
If you like deployments join test
---
If you want to live in the most violent region for nearly a year now join horde
---
please open the window ... inhale .... exhale ... think of flowers &amp; butterflys ....
---
as a guy who specifically hunted down C5/6 black holes to kill Barghest bots, I can tell you that this is unequivocally untrue.
---
No local is still nice though.
---
salty
---
...they're literally ISK faucets....
---
Some people would rather have fun than be "powerful". If your corporations "identity" and "self-worth" is tied up in being the most powerful, eventually you're going to have an awesome time getting your shit kicked in and going to play other games semi-permanently. I can see why BAT would fall into that category. Gotta cut away the situation if you wanna rebuild and not be stagnant. If someone were looking at an activity base with good support as a reason to join an established alliance, why wouldn't they try to rebuild somewhere like Horde?
---
The only thing Noraus will give you is his credit card details 
---
i got 40fps on a i5 and a gtx750, my laptop bearly gets 20fps on shit tier settings (thinkpad T420 w/ the Nv gpu option) i renember playing this game just fine on my old Phenom II and a R9 270 4 years ago, maxed and no dips or lag 
---
times have changed, currently my 1060 on my main pc goes down to its knees when the grid has more than 100 ships fighting, meanwhile my 6c12t hedt grade cpu is just sitting there twiddling its thumbs... 64bit client was sqeduled for DEC 2018... when do we get it??? 
---
I occasionally run bots
---
 I occasionally run bots 
---
gib lawgz
---
gib plz
---
gib drama
---
I've already clarified what I meant.
---
 have they? the game is harder to run now than it was in 2015, getting 40fps in station on a gpu that could do 100 when undocked in 2014? yea i think those codemonkeys they hired are literal monkeys 
---
```2019-01-23 19:00:53: lomgrim:replace me daddy
---
```    only in test 
---
zt? is that you?
---
im glad you went trough the effort and cut the filler out of the op, well done 
---
dunno, how bout them exploration bots tho
---
(Notice)
---
Um what? The core members of Bat are still in Bat and the old CEO of many, many years is still in Bat, he just doesn't play.  A few people left Bat to stay in Snigg because they like being shouted at or something.
---
wasnt that thing like 7b isk?   
---
are you gonna do handouts for that doc? would be fun to see either way 
---
The mind reels.
---
More like realistic. 
---
Soloers with non-sig-bonused MWD just have to get out as soon as carrier lands on grid - because carrier is essentially anti-nano ship.
---
Remember to turn your input broadcasts off when messagin mumma 
---
nano stabs are fun as fuck, they are just BIG stilettos 
---
&gt; 2019-01-23 19:01:04: Hudders:Anyone that knows me knows I shit talk FCs with ego too. No place for it in a space video game
---
My sides. He's easily top 5 FC Ego's I've had to deal with bottom 5 skill at the game. He's not even good at shit talking. So, a nice cap to put your feather in, I guess.
---
It's one guy and a his alts. 
---
Try east coaster trapped with morons who say Dominos or Papa Johns is good and Deep dish qualifies as pizza instead of bread lasagna
---
No that was BRAVE who dont have caps
---
And make delve shit out so.many ships the hulls will block out the sun?
---
There are also many people in Null, which never had a problem with bots.
---
Actually WH mechanics are a lot more vulnerable to botting. You have to react to threats much faster and you have to dscan constantly. Humans are a lot worse at these tasks than bots.
---
The most effective anti-bot-mechanic is the lack of anomaly respawns. After a relatively short time there's nothing left to do for the bot.
---
May the Fion be with you
---
dont give em ideas, theyll find out a way to use Dscan instad 
---
&gt;looks at PLH  
---
oh wait you can already pull and automize Dscan (V CTLR+C CTRL+V)
---
All hail the goon!!
---
So what are you even doing? What are your goals in eve, why do you play this game?
---
did you show up in hisec btw
---
You should leave your uni campus then.
---
Looks like MTO is becoming the keepstar graveyard, most keepstar deaths? Confirm/deny?
---
*invasion*
---
Just wait, they are waiting a little bit before they absolutely destroy eve, I 100% promise and guarantee it will happen. It's almost like it's their business model. 
---
Tomorrows post will be
---
{Subject; Day %n of %region %shiptype bots not being banned} and we will know for sure 😅
---
not even your isp is willing to care about stain.
---
It's almost like /r/eve is a community of players who come from different backgrounds- with lots of ideas and views, representing many alliances.
---
I have a feeling the word "botting" has become a 'buzzword' that includes input broadcasting, hacking, etc.
---
bro you get hot dropped in a fucking faction frigate, stay in your lane
---
I'm doing a bunch of stuff. I make stuff, i move stuff, and I shoot stuff. I don't really delve that deeply in to any one activity. I like being able to flit between activities at will.
---
Why in nullsec? Because you get bonuses for doing literally anything in nullsec that are better than anywhere else.
---
As for my goals, I just play this game in my down time to chill out. It's a game.
---
C1 are pain to roll so move out :D
---
Also there is plenty of wormhole corps, 
---
Look r/evejobs and i'd advise to join a C4 Corp (don't jump into a c5 corps straight)
---
And C6/NS
---
I don't deny my ISP is shitty, but he don't care to modify packet routing for some random guy playing pixel spaceships.       
---
Like i stated for some reason only eve related communication ventures into those routers - checked "all other online things" and none of them use them - and nowhere else i am getting issues.     
---
Bullshit. If you don't shoot you cant miss. 
---
yes 
---
what about dyson members with horde alts can I come hang out
---
Erotica 1 isn't a Sociopath, he's a damn smart guy who new exactly which targets to capitalise on.
---
reza would sooner see waffles die than join another null alliance prob
---
Like the past 5 years. They didn't go radio silent when PA bought them. 
---
there's not room for what pl used to be having the effect on the landscape that it used to - people don't check their watch list of pl super pilots before logging in dreads on the other side of eve anymore, etc
---
but there's still room for what pl used to be because that's largely what pl still is
---
shut up retard
---
Has Americans even looked at how net neutrality has effected us?? My internet's been throttled since. Huge rubber bands when my bandwidth priority is low. BTW I live on a major backbone.
---
This is actually really helpful. You can discern the importance of an op this way. Sub double digit pings? Trash
---
IT'S SIR RETARD
---
CCP may care. Maybe a company complaining to whoever manages that thing would get some results.
---
Would it be possible to get this in english? This is an english speaking subreddit after all.
---
OP probably just grabbed a few of his alts and reinforced  a few ADM1 systems. Let's see if he responds when the nodes spawn.
---
Okay... Please tell me how botting is a good thing? Eve is not a mobile idle game.
---
Come back Yonis pls
---
Tell them anyway, they can hit up their ISP who hopefully can help bypass or lean on the right people.
---
Have you tried not posting?
---
Oh fuck off, like skill yourself doesnt drop caps in the same manner. I dont disagree with you its a dumb style of play, but dude cmon. 
---
You misspelled pancake m8
---
the triangle is the strongest geometric shape, even wierd wormhole aliens w/ laser pointers know that

1. I didn't break any rules to begin with. These are accusations with in inadequate evidence.
---
2. I'm in Bulgaria
---
3. Goons got cucked again.. again.. again..
---
What we should really think about is how to deal with this toxic part of the game. 
---
Do you really think its acceptable to lynch mob someone like this out of the game?
---
I have a strong head so it doesn't bother me. However, I'm willing to bet the people on the other side of the shit posts either hate their lives or have serious mental issues. Its the only explanation for wanting to release all that rage inside them. 
---
What if I actually gave a shit? This could drive someone to do stupid things IRL. The way people act is disgusting.  
---
Anyone who was part of it should feel ashamed of themselves.
---
Oh and look right after you put the order up, in the same server tick someone already underbid you. Then you  buy that underbid...... and its back....... before my market can even refresh. Great sandbox btw.
---
I totes remember and even saved that comment...unfortunately I save lots of comments
---
i see. you are the generation of gamers that needs theme park incentives to do stuff. eve is already enough fun if you know how to get it
---
&gt;Eve is not a mobile idle game.
---
that's where you're wrong kiddo.
---
&gt;Okay... Please tell me how botting is a good thing?
---
botting is a symptom of bad game design

Got bored after the second para, 1 down vote
---
arent HTP the guys that went and sided w/ PL during the provi eviction? i renember you guys constantly rading fleets and contesting timers (and providing alot more content than PL lol) 
---
you have too much fail in CVA IT to be that vigilant :D
---
Even if you recall everything on the same tick the drones are going to be different distances away... isnt dscan rate limited?
---
The lossmails on days with broken local is more compelling, especially if its multiple in the same area
---
i like how you have dotaofsmitesIII running in the background 
---
Fun and engaging gameplay. 10/10 would plex into the answer to everything.

---
*Downvoted &gt;:C*
---
Its just that its silly how cloudy and intangible your definition of a bot is. 
---
Basically anyone who doesn't lose a ship to you is a bot. 
---
And anyone who doesn't attempt to fight a loki with a VNI and instead just gives up and does nothing, is a bot. 
---
And everyone who docks or tethers or circles the tower while you're in local, is a bot. 
---
And everyone who is coordinated is a bot (Where you see 30 ships recall drones and warp out at the same time, I suspect its 10 players with 3 VNIs each). 
---
And everyone who doesn't speak to the 1000th visitor to the system that day, is a bot (nevermind that you're just some nobody from an unkown wormhole group that the VNI guy hasn't heard about before, so he doesn't even feel the need to curse at you). 
---
And everyone who recalls drones and warps away as soon as someone enters local, is a bot. 
---
And everyone who don't fetch a PVP ship when visitor number 1000 enters local, is a bot (nevermind that its not the staging system, so we have no PVP ships in system). 
---
I have no idea how many bots there are, and there certainly are some, and CCP should definitely do something to kill bots. 
---
But your frame of mind is entirely unhelpful and silly. 
---
Its entirely pointless that you point out all these "bot behaviors" that only CCP can prove to be a bot or player. Its just even sillier that these behaviors could easily just be players. 30 VNIs in one K-space system with good true-sec can easily be 25 players with a little over 1 character on average. But in your silly mind its "OBVIOUSLY a bot!". Have I mentioned how silly that is? 
---
&gt; Not like someone's going to give me recognition because I have a lot of kills on my killboard.  
---
You say that, but about once a week I have some new recruit going apeshit over my killboard. Also, an enthusiastic member of my corp thinks that we're doomed for recruitment until we hit the 1000 kill mark. Some people care way too much, I'm afraid.
---
&gt;Where’s the incentive
---
Dunking on nerds with your big dick energy Orthrus is an incentive in and of itself.
---
And they do! (except for NRDS, which is fundamental to Provi as a concept.)  
---
Are you interested in joining Provi?
---
2 variations that are popular:
---
**Variation 1:** 
---
* Create a chat channel for yourself and invite your alt into there (Two alts is better)
---
* Grab yourself 3 faction ships, usually frigates like Firetails or cruisers like the Vexor Navy. Create three contracts, two for 9,999,999 ISK and one for 99,999,999 ISK for the Firetail or 44,444,444/444,444,444 ISK for the VNI. 
---
* Drag your underpriced contracts into your private chat channel and have your alts accept them so it looks like someone grabbed them up
---
* Spam all 3 contracts (2 completed, 1 not) in Jita local. Use some pizzazz like a 1920's carnival hustler and have your alts "feel" like they won.
---
* Your mark will not pay attention to the extra digit and pick up an overpriced ship.
---
**Variation 2:**
---
* Same setup as Variation 1 with the chat channels
---
* Use faction cruisers that look similar to their empire equivalents. The Vexor and Vexor Navy is perfect for this. Price the two VNIs appropriately (Maybe a bit cheaper to entice people, or add rigs to make it look "Believable" that you dont wanna sell it on market) and the single Vexor as the same price.
---
* Spam your contracts the same way as before, except this time you are peddling a Vexor as a VNI rather than an extra digit in the contracts.
---
* Your mark will think he is buying a VNI when instead he buys a Vexor for the price of one.
---
That still doesn't answer why it's a **good** thing only why it happens (in your opinion)
---
They’re pioneering a new ninja noctis salvage truck comp. Dyson is now New Eden’s Premier battlefield cleanup contractor. ;)
---
I had enough issues to consider not playing the game. No loss but I could very likely lose my ship.
---
I think they downvote you because you usually shitpost and it becomes a reflex :P
---
I know, but first i wanted be sure if other people have same issue.     
---
Like there is different talk when bigger population is affected, also if this is one of the real reasons why many people have issues with eve - goal is also to help to solve it for them. 
---
On behalf of the EVENorth group, looking forward to seeing all you nerds here. And /u/GaussDragon you may get the NC vs TAPI drinking rematch

This is great! 
---
If this is 10 people CCP will not care as it is to small population - i don't blame them.        
---
If this is 1000 people CCP could start to care.        
---
Before we get to the point "who" should care we need to know how big population is affected by those shitty servers.      
---
Tricky stuff is that most of the time you will not see any issue. 
---
Ban all cheaters, thanks.
---
Wow, wasnt expecting such a technical post which indeed makes sense from you /u/StainGuy
---
Tested it: Im not routed threw this AS - And dont have any problems like you mentioned them
---
I have it to V on all characters that have more than 20mil, and also have drone specs to iv on the same. It gives rather nice extra boost. 
---
it's a good thing because it will cause ccp to look at the actual issues in their game that causes widespread botting
---
There are already Battleship hulls that fit covert cloaks - they're called Black Ops, and they're obscenely expensive. 
---
I‘ve donated to various third party initiatives in Eve over the years. Daniel is the only one who ever said thankyou.
---
Ah thanks, I knew what it was, just didn't know the name!
---
But... wouldn't that make every goon allowed to break eula to fight the remnants of MBC due to the RMT scandal?
---
Can you ran a trace and check if you have those servers along the way.       
---
If yes then the tricky part is that you need to run the trace when this short "hickup" on them starts.       
---
I have this WinMTR ready and when i suspect that something bad is happening to game i run it to check what is happening.        
---
Quite often i get nothing ... and game is actually working well, just nothing happens. But when game truly "shit itself" i am getting those packet losses on this as6453
---
do you have any ingame issues?
---
at this point i'd rather have a "day1 of xXxdumbshitxXx" post than a wormhole post
---
But what if you break the EULA to fight people who no breaking the EULA ??? FC what to do ???
---
Thank you. 
---
Did you have any serious chat related issues - out of curiosity ... and excluding jita?
---
That was harpythron😎
---
Ok, finally someone who will probably listen to my story:    
---
This is a know issue for me since about 4 years. I'm currently living in a central european country and can say for sure that my ISP is sometimes thottling my connection to either to the network where Tranquility is located, or to the Amazon content servers, or sometimes to both.    
---
I've conducted several tests in the last few months and on some days its so bad that I get only ~4kb/s from Amazon CDN and Tranquility, but mostly Amazon.     
---
When this happens, I'll lose connection on several of my clients, login screens stay black for minutes and heavy rubberbanding occurs.     
---
My only and now permanent solution is a German based VPN server hosted in a datacenter with direct peering to London networks (where TQ sits). This indeed costs me a few €s more per month, but guarantees me a stable connection - and is working fantastic for at least 3 months. I've gone as far as to set the VPN as my default PC connection on startup. No issues anymore (And I'm pretty sure I've got a lot less chat issues than my corpmates, but this is another problem).     
---
So, in my case, its definitly not CCP's fault, but ISP's thottling their customers connections by sheer money greed.
---
&gt; as6453.net
---
That domain is registered by German legal entities, CSL Computer Service Langenbach GmbH d/b/a joker.com - both are a German GmbH. I'd think the problem might between Frankfurt and Amsterdam and not necessarily at the Amsterdam side. 
---
I've done a tracert from The Netherlands to eveonline.com and I'm not routed through as6453.net. 
---
Buzz off, little bee. There's no spin here. 
---
Well tbh i will probably work on some VPN for the same reason. 
---
You've got a very odd sense of humour. 
---
:huyonis: I am currently pursuing my dream of building a purebred chihuahua farm 
---
2 vni docking on the same tick is not evidence of botting.  Anoms differ in distance don't they.  So if they landed together it implies they left at different times.  Rounding to 2s of course.
---
Anyway my point isn't that there are no bots, it's that your perception of whether or not a character is in fact a bot is a lot more nuanced than reddit tends to make out.
---
1 ply all the way!
---
Last time I checked, Black Ops BS's couldn't use covert cloaks. Did something change? I've been outta the loop for a while.
---
It's limited to 2 seconds. Nevertheless either the "human" who is 7 boxing vni's is always perfectly paying attention and issuing the order to pull within 2-3 seconds of someone coming into local ALL THE TIME or it's a bot. And yeah, you just look at the creation date/corp history/name and it's abundantly clear it's the same "person" running all the VNI's/gilas.

Not true. When WH space came out, it was intended for day trips and for most of us it never occurred to live in j-space. I would venture in there to hunt those day trippers.
---
It didnt take long before I noticed that Russian farmers with dscan bots had moved in as permanent residents. The bots hook into the client and pull dscan data and they would warp off nearly as soon as someone entered system.
---
These were also some of the first in saw evicted as blowing up their pos was the only way to do anything about their farming.
---
There's an equally huge chance that all issues can be traced back to your perpetual bad posting too.

I've been totally against no-local since 2003 (yes, people have been calling for it since then).  I think removing it would hurt newer players, players who derp around in subcaps, etc. i.e. not the big guys who can rely on an umbrella to rescue them.

But... I hate bots and botters, so I'm torn on this.

I had some issues with the chat not beeing synchrone with the system im in, but this was maybe 4 to 6 months ago. Since then everything (except Jita ofc - which tells me 42 in local, but 2k guests in station) works flawless, even in TiDi
---
eve is blatant p2w. but it's also a sandbox, so it's hard to argue having an advantage over someone else when you could've just walked into a trap
---
:thinking: how does rmt work
---
That`s where the magic happens. 
---
But why not add a little extra incentive to kill people so that even those who normally wouldn't be too interested in it do it more often?
---
Pve guys can make some isk (or whatever, but that's thr general idea) PVPing INSTEAD OF MINDLESSLY PVEING. Pvp guys get more PvP because more people are looking for and willing to PvP. How is that not a win win?
---
Trial key makes sense but alas I doubt it'll work. EVE no longer has trail periods.
---
Probably getting downvoted, but big shoutouts to Cowkiller, mar5hy, Dracoth, Avengy, Dex, Andrzej and whoever I forgot FCing for BB for being always friendly on comms, answering all of our 'noob' questions and helping everyone out. same goes for Cryonano, Haunting, Pyke and the rest of SpectreFleet. and of course lets not forget scouts, hunters, blops, logi, booshers, recons and everyone else that make these fleets possible.
---
Well, I'm pretty sure you don't last a year in TEST dipo and recruit five corps and half of Legacy if you're bad at it, but maybe in PL that's the case, I dunno. I needed a break. 
---
mmm ... I want some waffles now.
---
They’re not. And if you think so, I really question why you even play (or played) eve. Winning to you is having the most sp possible? Pathetic.

That’s a problem with the game mechanics, not skill injectors. Thusly, it seems like you’re the retard in this situation.

I haven't had any disconnects, but I have noticed an occasional hiccup. Also, on other games, I have been experiencing the rubberbanding.
---
Nonsense. Isk faucets out of thin air (I mean from Concorde) for killing rats. Why not lore up an ingame group that faucets out isk for capsuleer ship and pod kills?
---
More people will be willing to PvP. PvP folk will have more people to PvP with. It wouldn't take rocket science to make the system relatively unexploitable (and besides, it's not like people don't just exploit pve isk faucets already anyway).

Oh and our alliance Teamspeak server has been acting up, dropping several people at a time, two or three people with normally good connection getting lagged so they can't be understood.
---
Well, i will share it publicly when giveaway ends then, thanks :)
---
Most of the people I hear complaining in game are Russian (known issues) or Americans (net neutrality and ISP fuckery)...I am sure there are simpler explanations. Still, really good post bud, you must be close to approaching your final form?
---
AUTZ player here, yesterday while running a T3 abyssal, i got a "dc" (didnt get a crash error, game just got stuck repeating the same animation over and over..
---
So i tried to reconnect, game woule get stuck on authenticating.
---
My pc doesnt have wifi so i swapped over to my laptop, booted it up, connected to my network's wifi and had the same issue. Swapped over to a 4G hotspot from my phone and I could log in and GTFO the site (drones cleared the room and saved my ass. Had like 3-4 minutes left now, but it was the last room).

Definitely seems to be a fucky provider

---
Pvp for fun is fine. But that isn't incompatible with PvP for other incentive, especially since some players don't love to PvP just for the sake of it but would get into it more for a monetary reward. This would get more people PVPing, and that can't be a bad thing for eve.
---
Just nerf anom bounties by 30% and put that amount of faucet into killing capsuleer ships&amp;pods. Have a new, renegade npc faction hack Concorde and divert isk they normally pay for npc bounties to capsuleer bounties.

#REPORT ALL BOTS

---
  BB: "It's ok to break the rules if it means we get to ruin goon's day"
---
This poster is very obviously in snuff 
---
Put the shoe on the other foot and realize how ridiculous this sounds. How would you react if a Pve guy told a PvP guy that he just needs to get over the PvP rush anf embrace the spot? Lol.
---
There are different ways to enjoy eve. No reasonable mind would disagree. So why not make PvP more enjoyable for different sorts of players so that more players want to PvP?
---
Lower pve payouts. Create/increass PvP payouts. Less reward for risk averse ratting and botting and rorq blobbing. More reward for embracing what eve is "supposed" to be all about. It's a win win.
---
Nerf instwarping. 
---

That is a dangerous life you live there, my friend!
---
Imagine for a second that you have all the SP and a lot of ISK. What would you do now? Your only option is to spend what you have because there is no reason to get more. Actually the biggest part of the game is closed now due to worthlessness.
---
As some say: it’s the journey and not a destination what is fun part.
---
When I was new player I never got depressed because I have no chance to “catch up”. It’s just play with what you have and feel achievement in what you reach.
---
I've hear this alot, and outside of escalations I think it would be rare for every pve'r to be paired with 1x logi
---
PvE is already pretty safe with an active tank, the only dangerous ones are escalations.  If escalations started to get abused then logi would always be primary for rats, followed by whoever is shooting them.
---
as a german, ive never had connection/lag issues, the warp bug is also something that never happend and chat works just fine for me

---
yes been having a looot of rubberbanding, thanks for finding out about this staindude
---
I'm pretty sure you're wrong.
---
Adding payouts (like a form of npc bounties but on capsuleer) to PvP wouldnt need to be immense. It wouldn't reduce the effort required to build a super. It wouldn't reduce the need for (it'd probably I the need for) mining and industry and stuff. 
---
It'd balance out. Supply and demand and whatnot. If more people PvP more often because now there is incentive beyond relishing the fight itself, that increases demand for PvP stuff while possibly (depending on if the person doing this was an industrial sort or just a rat grinder) also reducing supply. This incentivizes industry folks to meet that demand. Etc.
---
Can you run trace on the connection you had issues with? 
---
I think heat can bleed into the rightmost slot and thus disable the weapon group? Ill check on sisi when i get home
---
I think sometimes you can ungroup your guns and use the few guns that didnt get fried, but i cant recall exactly how the mechanics work
---
Although some of the post has the gist of the 3 ship monte scam, this is what it is.
---
1. Be in one of the trade hubs.
---
2. Do a 3, 2, 1 countdown and link an open contract with a discounted faction frigate for 666,666 isk. No need for alts take the 12 mill hit on your wallet. It makes the game seem legit.
---
3. After a couple of legit contracts link one for 666,666,666 isk.
---
4. If the contract gets taken or not, move into faction cruisers. Do it with a one that has a regular T1 equivalent like a Vexor Navy Issue. Sell a couple that's discounted legitimately.
---
5. After selling a couple of legit ones. Link one of the T1 for the same price you have been selling the faction one. I usually sell a couple of these and these make up my losses from selling the faction frigates.
---
6. Sell one more faction cruiser at a discounted price. 
---
7. Hit them with the faction cruiser scam.
---
8. Whether it gets taken or not, tell local you will now have a round of t2 cruisers. I tell them Ishtar round coming up.
---
9. No legit ones here. I usually sell an Ishkur linked as an Ishtar for 125 mill. Or a legit Ishtar for 1.25 billion.
---
No need for alts for any of these.
---
Not only local but Corp / Alliance channels are dead for all my toons, too.
---
Can you run a trace and check the servers you are moving?
---
If you think fewer people should do pve, if you want more PvP, then why would you argue against something that would likely accomplish both those goals?
---
Incentivizing PvP would get more people doing it more often while pulling some people away from pve AND relatively decreasing the value of most pve by relatively increasing the value kf timr spent pvping.
---
Why would you need a LS gate to stain _when all of lowsec is stain?!_
---
Structure transfers can be turned off on the receivers side.
---
During the PL Invasion, HTP aquired the single system of Y-MPL through *completley honest and fair*, l33t PvPs.
---
During the TEST Invasion and subsiquent ransacking an poaching of Providence stations and playerbase. Whilst PL ultimatly lost out on the stations and abandoned holding any other forms of Sov in the region. HTP, like the clingy Ex-boyfriends of Provi, held on, despite combined best efforts. During this time HTP advertised to friends just how fun it was to be a Provi-Bloc alliance, and pushed into the region, "Accidently-the-whole-I9B-Pocket" and making new friends on the way! Like TRC!
---
So yeah we 'Sided' with PL during their invasion, for sure. Grr-CVA, Grr-Space-Buracracy! We're for the booping of all snoots, galaxywide. 
---
Someone pop a help ticket into black pearl abyss 
---
They have introduced new 'Abyssal' mods that use a gambling type mechanic so essentially a pay to win cash sink hole for all the whales to sink their teeth into..
---
imo abyssal is retarded because it takes some of the predictability out of the rock paper scissor game- on the other hand i dont really care because game is mostly a capital blobfest and hardly worth playing anyway.
---
The krab is strong with this one. 
---
Most ratters don't require probes to catch because they run green sites. Scannable sigs are kinda garbage for isk making in wspace.
---
Because of that you usually only drop combat probes if it's dreads or fax in space, due to the high likelihood of catching them in siege/triage
---
TIME TO HUNT BOTS! Also fuck local, it's dumb. 
---
Here you go. In my defence I was cloaked and lining up on the enemy fleet, as soon as I decloaked and launched Bob poo (lol) flew straight into the path of my bomb. I offered to SRP him but he thought it was funny and it was a free ship. And I got to say I killed bob poo. https://zkillboard.com/kill/51137245/
---
&gt;  There's plenty of incentive to pvp.
---
Then why doesn't everyone do it? Or at least more people? Almost nobody denies small gang is awful, that you have to spend longer and longer looking for a fight and less time fighting.
---
What would be the harm in incentivizing PvP a little more? It's likely increase the amount of total time Eve's population spends pvping. That means more dead pveers and more fights for pvpers. How is that not a win win, regardless of whether you think there is enough once tive already?
---
Yeah it's dumb knowing if there's anyone in the system to hunt in the first place. Fuck that shitty thing. Dscan for ever and ever
---
So you literally play this game to watch your isk grow? What a boring outlook on life. 
---
new jove wh accessible (sub caps only) universe please where capitals cannot be built and their is no concord like hs faggotry.

1. Tata communication is one of the largest peering providers on the planet. The chances of someone else passing through the exact same problem hardware in the middle of the route is absolutely microscopic and even if they are saying "I'm having packet loss on as6453.net routers" is like when your parents phone you up and say "the facebook isn't working".
---
1. You made and deleted a post 2 days ago about how you were getting [huge connection issues](https://www.removeddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ai9vr2/question_is_your_client_recently_getting_huge/) that I haven't seen or heard anyone else report.
---
3. CCP don't run their own datacentre and I'd hazard a guess they don't manage their peering about this so I doubt there's anything they can do besides send a polite email to an inbox that will probably never be read ..
---
4. .. because if there is actually an issue on Tata's end I guarantee you they have monitoring software that will do a better job of detecting it.
---
Rather than making shitpost #4354385 on r/eve have you tried using a VPN? Have you tried replacing any of your own hardware? Have you contacted your own ISP? Are you sure EVE is the ONLY thing you're having these issues with?
---
Why do you even play the game? What incentive do you need besides fun? And lastly, what’s the incentive to accumulate isk?
---
Happy to hear the slightly less aggressive monetisation tactics of the western devs are rubbing off - I follow BDO on steam and their recent patch notes seem to have a lot of positive changes in them, hope it continues as I would like to get into it.  
---
All we have seen from this side is a move away from the grimdark and plex sales and more MPT and colourful skins.
---
By that logic, CCP is supporting the bots by being willing to sell you the PLEX that you sell them.
---
Checkmate, atheists.
---
Its incentive that appeals to some people. Just like making isk appeals to others.
---
You want more pvp right? You want mindless pve and botting to be less important in the game right? Adding incentive to PvP via something like ratting bounties on capsuleer would accomplish both of those things.
---
Don't you just love it when the crappy brands rip and tare mid wipe?
---
I cant wait for CCP to blow all its cash into stupid shit like it always has done and then regret selling its cash cow.

I've only been playing for 4 days but I'm watching some highly synchronized mining going on. There's 12 asteroid belts in this system with 12 groups of 7 Venture's defended by a lager ship (forgot which) carrying drones. A group for each asteroid belt. These groups log on and off all at the same time and leave their Venture's just sitting in space where they were when they logged off.
---
I figured out that I can get right in the middle of them and mine away while they keep the rats from bothering me. They do not interact with other players. If these are bots does that make me a botter to :).

Irrelevant to the point at hand. CCP won't walk back moon changes. They might potentially do something simpler with the game that lures people who want to see more small gang PvP back in while also combating asset inflation and having no net effect on isk faucets.

Post 2 days before was before 2 steps above so decided to talk to my ISP and observe it bit more.

Yes i am sure that it is only this i checked 3 other MMO (don't have issues, none of the trace touches as6453.net or i have issues)

Checked other services that i use in the same result.

Did this on 3 other PC at home.

Assumed that if there is no issues elsewhere modem provided by ISP should be working ok.

Yes i will probably move to VPN - but many people have issues and if this somehow can help them or let us validate that issues are not with CCP - then is worth a shoot.

On a more serious node: Seems like you're really lucky. I'm getting rubberbanding all the time and only while playing eve. And that's not only me, often when I run into these issues my corpmates tell me the same and we've got people from almost around the globe.
---
Heaven
---
Cool to see Hedliner throwing a hissy fit over Kismeteer being made CEO of BAT he threw the corp out of PL.
---
Never change dude who got beat up by a twink at EVE London.
---
No it isn't its three guys and their alts. Were you afk so long that you forgot who's an alt and who's a main? 
---
VPN is the easiest thing to check. You can just use a free trial for 20 minutes and see if your issue goes away. If it doesn't and you're not routing through tata anymore you know the issue is on your end.
---
dont worry ombeve is still OMGHHAAGWD

Yep i know. 
---
Like i stated somewhere here this how it will probably end up.   
---
But as in last 2 days i found another person having same issues - same servers it will bring no harm to point those issues - if not solve them at least make people aware of reason they can have issues.      
---
It depends. On New Years Eve in Dodixie I sold
---
faction frigate  for 666 mill
---
faction cruiser for 450 mill.
---
2 regular cruisers at 45 mill 
---
Ishkur for 125 mill
---
All in the span of 10 mins. I really don't know how much i make on this. But I'm not broke.
---
&gt; edit: Actually looks like they do manage their own peering and they peer directly with Tata on AS6453. Tata accounts for ~2% of their traffic.                
---
Wait you want to say that CCP can potentially solve this issue ?
---
Where is Mar5hy when you need him.   
---
The hero Delve deserves and needs right now.
---
I'm bringing the empire back.
---
Were those the dreads that moved out of 319 last night?  Wondered what they were up to.
---
No. The game does not need more ISK faucets and is fine as it is.
---
Mom, I've just bought a lottery ticket. Wish me luck
---
ccp doesnt want us to be able to kill bots..
---
Yes yes. Meanwhile, I'd enjoy to hear you explain away how monetary incentive to PVP would be a bad thing. More PVP? Good. Relatively less reward for AFK VNIs and ratting bots and risk-averse super ratters? Good. Where is the negative here? Ad hominems don't count.
---
I mean, we already reward LOSERS of ships with insurance. Why do losers in PVP get fauceted isk but winners have to bring a PVE ship with them to pick up loot and salvage wrecks? Why not reward winners directly as well for the win win I mention above?
---
Sysadmins can't play less when they already don't play
---
:Thinking:
---
(Also &lt;3 to all the sysadmins still around who have won EvE and keep shit running)
---
Jesus, you're a broken record. Grow up, dude. 
---
Mari actually plants his British "flag" in the "minds" of young kids.
---
Maybe you shouldn't aggro your titan on your own cynos while moving solo through a hostile region you idiot.
---
he did say "try" , fam.
---
Nice try
---
You can use https://eveeye.com instead for the mapping bit, IMHO it's actually a lot better and can track your ingame position in real time as well. 
---
Re-read what I said. 😑
---
It doesn't need to be an additional isk faucet. Reduce PVE faucets, boost PVP faucet. The game is not "fine as it is" ... lol.
---
That was two regions north doesnt factor in. And sure if I do but if i move safely with no in local then can’t be touched which is what it appeared to be to me. A empty system
---
So right now it's exactly the same as it was in Feb-May '18, uhh ok?

---
hey man, we *LIBERATED* Provitence :P 
---
Maybe you shouldnt fake shit to get your Titan replaced because you are retarded enough to move through what is probably the most dangerous region to move through 
---
Magicians actually, but it took you an eternity to cloak, had time for 2 combat probe cycles.
---
It's not as bad as you make it sound. There aren't many games that punish you as hard for failure as eve. It's possible and frankly easy to dunk 40 dollars into the game and lose it all before the night is over, I've seen it done a dozen times. Hell I've probably done it.
---
Honestly, with as busy as I tend to be, I'd never have been able to really play the game if it weren't for selling Plex. It bought my orca and goty station trading game rolling. Maybe I'm biased, but I think that's fine.
---
I like the you have no idea what the MBC actually was

Lmao you're actually retarded. Fuck off dude.

Ok, I'll inform Goon to do better next time. Thank you for your insight.

dont see many ridges on this man
---
very very smooth
---
dont be bad. adapt. l2p. get gud
---
legit like maybe you should ask yourself how much you did wrong here before posting/crying on reddit and getting roasted
---
No one in goons care about botting, as long as they are not super obvious. And i think they do not have to care either. It’s not there job to care it’s ccps job. 
---
Im not a goon BTW i Hunt em do no Koolaid here.
---
Be CCP, disband a botter corp/alliance, watch the sov disappear, enjoy a cold beer while watching the region burn.
---
Can you and those people try to do use this WinMTR to validate if they have any issues?     
---
For me until this rubberbanding starts all network stats are fine =&gt; so you need to start the test when issues are starting. 
---
I knew i shouldn’t have posted all just gonna be rage and saying I’m shit and shouldn’t fake shit. Like chat is fucked right now Im logged in is no one else seeing it, rest of reddit seems to be
---
Does this actually work ?
---
Nice edit.
---
Doesn't matter. Their only limiting factor currently is pilots not ships. Also blowing up their ratting vnis etc would drop 50+mil instead of nothing. It would actually be a feasible source of income as would most other pvp thus encouraging it as a job. Cargo would become important and I could definitely see transport ships being used in gangs. Scavenging players would also be really fun to interact with more often.
---
People would be hunting a lot more if it paid better. 
---
Great beer recommendations!
---
Electric Mud is closed :(
---
Had to correct my mistake but still wouldn’t factor in cause system was empty
---
&gt; Basically anyone who doesn't lose a ship to you is a bot.
---
Nope
---
&gt; And anyone who doesn't attempt to fight a loki with a VNI and instead just gives up and does nothing, is a bot.
---
Where did i write that? 
---
&gt; And everyone who docks or tethers or circles the tower while you're in local, is a bot.
---
Yeah orbiting the stick is a common behavior amongst real players, i don't say only bots do this ofc, but when you see 80% of all VNI's acting the same within a region (like in the dronelands)... let's say it's quite suspicious
---
&gt; And everyone who is coordinated is a bot (Where you see 30 ships recall drones and warp out at the same time, I suspect its 10 players with 3 VNIs each).
---
When all of them are recalling at the same time, it's either scripted behavior or input broadcasting -&gt; both are bannable offenses
---
&gt; And everyone who doesn't speak to the 1000th visitor to the system that day, is a bot (nevermind that you're just some nobody from an unkown wormhole group that the VNI guy hasn't heard about before, so he doesn't even feel the need to curse at you).
---
nope, never said that. I don't talk to people in local when i hunt, i don't really care if they speak or not. 
---
&gt; And everyone who recalls drones and warps away as soon as someone enters local, is a bot.
---
Not at all, it's the impossible timing, not the action itself.
---
&gt; And everyone who don't fetch a PVP ship when visitor number 1000 enters local, is a bot (nevermind that its not the staging system, so we have no PVP ships in system).
---
Nope, they're pussies but that's another problem we won't discuss in this topic. 
---
You must be really naive bud, i don't know how to explain this to you clearly but there are tons of bots on Eve. Missions bots, market bots,  PVE bots, Hauling bots... but you sir must be the only dude in new eden that never encountered one. But in your naive mind, all VNI's of a system recalling drone within the same tick, warping to a POS, orbiting the stick and get back ratting EXACTLY 10 minutes later are real players. Did i mention how naive you are? 
---
You're right about one thing though, only CCP can get the evidences or data to prove that a toon is indeed a bot and no autistic player farming 18h a day 7/7. We players can only get clues, no evidences. 
---
This is some suspicious stuff.  
---
It's infowars time. 
---
Did the deepstate hack CCP servers ? 
---
You're in TEST. I figured you already knew how this works. Apparently not.
---
Stop acting retarded, chat was fine before downtownime when you lost your shitfit titan in the most retatded way possible
---
You'd be surprised. Try for yourself and see
---
Sorry I thought you were being sarcastic.
---
Same?
---
Not much of a reddit guy
---
Yeah, without the troll though it took you nearly 30 seconds to cloak upon entering the system, which was more than enough to guarantee your location.
---
&gt;Just because you can't play 23 hrs a day 7 days a week 
---
Pffft, challenge accepted.
---
reason for all the lag recently.
---
hard reset eve, remove all capitals except carriers

I didn't get a warning, but did have local, so that's cool

this is the real result of skill injectors
---
we dont take kindly to your type of folks around here
---
If it were up to me say a tech II fit Cerberus would be 80mil for hull 250 for modules
---
chat bugged after downtime lol
---
Even autz tries to kill eve. 
---
hahaha good one,
---
It was before too. Like a hour before I would have to guess local stopped changing. Its hard to tell because all systemsI was moving thru seem empty and I was moving thru quiet systems so they coulda actually been empty. Response fleet said chat was fucked as well
---
we have such a nice FPS graph in game, wouldnt it be nice to have the same for ping and paketloss? 
---
no.
---
Just read about this on Kotaku. Have not played in years and was curious and then I saw the article.
---
&gt;"With a scout safely positioned in Rage, they began to move freighters full of battleships into the wormhole.
---
&gt;Over the course of nearly a year, many different methods were employed to sneak these massive, slow ships into Rage"
---
Ah right, that sort of mentality is exactly why I stopped playing.
---
I don't see how CCP could change the game to to not cause people to use bots. As soon as something is a multiplayer game with some kind of currency or valueables people will try to use bots who farm those valueables/currency for them. If there's a way to RMT (= for players to exchange currency/items) then there will be even more bots.  
---
So as long as eve doesn't go the way of diablo 3 where you essentially can't trade or give items to other players at all, there will always be bots.  
---
So what changes to the game do you think should CCP make?   
---
Everybody is really quick to yell about bad game design. But there's no wayy to prevent bots in a game like eve without turning it into a totally different game.
---

Wouldn't work in the US. Everyone is in debt either due to late-stage capitalism (bad) or gaming the "debt creates capital" aspect (good). Debt doesn't equal poor here... we have races, sexes, and religions to do that.
---
Well, i am glad it worked :) Have fun!
---
Yeah, that stopped being funny about 10 months ago. 
---
If you're in the US, welcome to no longer having Net Neutrality. ISPs have full reign to throttle your connections if they feel like it.
---
Very well could've also been one of the tier 1 providers like CenturyLink or one of the hubs for one of the Atlantic loops as well.
---
In terms of price yes, but there is also much higher demand for the gila now and the prices ares still gradually dropping.
---
You'd just have to make sure the module costs are baked into the hull-sized items though. You couldn't have DCUs and damage mods and stuff like this, or it'd be impossible to fit a 1m isk frigate hull for less than 50 million. But if the guns and prop mod and stuff are the expensive modules, it'd be more workable except for some things like BCs needing BS guns or overpropped fits or whatever.

Where is the joke.

&gt;During the TEST Liberation and subsiquent airlifting of stations and select chosen providence members.
---
the point is the reward of pvp is entirely sexual in nature and extremely potent, which is enough for everyone else who isn't complaining about it. 
---
What happens to abyssal runners with this?
---
poor guy deleted his user :/ 
---
Yeah I'm going to throw 50$ in eve to earn about 6B which an experienced player will earn in about  a week or two. Then I'm going to throw a war on them thinking my 6B bought me the victory. And then I realise that these players have been playing for years.
---
Now tell me, you have 10B in your wallet, are you rich ?
---
I'm sure I've f\*cked up the numbers to some point but you get the idea. You can add to that social power, player availability, territory.
---
I'm sure the best players have such a wallet that you'd have to waste thousand of $$ to even start making a difference in what is happening right now.
---
Now of course, I could buy all the SP I want, go into a big ship and go fly it.
---
You can guess how many players would like to know where you are going to fly it, as in eve, having ISK only means you are a good target.
---
What protocol are you using in MTR? LFT (Layer Four Traceroue) can have better success getting through security measures set up by ISPs etc. (uses tcp instead of udp) as some hops on a traceroute may show as packet loss or timeouts, but can be down to firewall configurations to throttle or block certain ports.
---
Also as far as I can see you’re running a trace to the web server, not the game server.
---
I payed 40mil for a vexor once...
---
SCP is only one letter away from CCP :BigThonk:
---
I don't like either of your specific ideas, OP, but I do agree that Eve PVP needs more incentive than "lol omg like, PVP is its own reward you stupid retard krab lololozlol!1!!!!" and being able to loot+salvage wrecks.
---
We already faucet isk to losers of PVP. Why not do the same for winners? Create an ingame, lore-based entity that hates capsuleers. They hack concord, reappropriating 10-30% of NPC bounty payments to capsuleers who kill each other.
---
PVP is (more) incentivized. More people PVP. That's a snowball effect, probably. More minerals are destroyed in a New Eden overflowing with them. Etc.
---
PVE isn't discouraged, but some forms of it are relatively less rewarding than they used to be, including VNI ratting, super ratting, and the other risk-averse, non-engaging, heavily-botted forms of PVE isk faucet grinds that Eve can stand to have less of. Meanwhile, PVE that is a bit more engaging, like running escalations and WH and exploration, and industry, are probably relatively more rewarding than they used to be, as more of the stuff those things add into the game are being destroyed by the increased PVP.
---
Isk faucet balance doesn't need to change. But it can depending on the numbers.
---
Bottom line is more people are PVPing. What can be bad about that?
---
Just did but I don’t know why. What the fuck do you do in this game? Besides be a fucking moron on reddit?
---
Yeah, right...
---
Just check out the last 2 months of this corp's killboard:
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98517701/
---
Roam Delve and you will find a VNI bot named like "jrwhwr Adele" in almost all ratting systems, all belonging to the same chinese corp.
---
good review
---
Ok
---
Maybe come there yourself instead of rallying behind somebody who proved himself to be cheating at the game?
---
He means the contents. You cant stop someone delivering ships to you. When the structure dies those ships end up in space and are often killed because they cant be hauled out.
---
As said KB fetishist isbthe owner of said ships they end up on his KB

[https://i.imgur.com/Ge3bJmJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/Ge3bJmJ.png)
---
I sort of think it the opposite. Unless you explicitly like to do the PvE, the main incentive is to PvP. Thats why we are all so a diligently working the PvE. So we can bank up the ridiculous amounts of ISK it takes to more avidly PvP. I enjoy manufacturing and PI, but my true goal is to have skills in professions that can fund all the PvP i want to do. EVE is PvP, all the other shit we are doing is primarily because PvP is expensive. IMO at least.
---
WETAAADED
---
Do you have shadowplay or just screenshots from local? Cause i have same problem: my cyno hunter is invisible in local for my main, lol. 
---
You're ina 700+ dps heavy assault cruiser with bonuses to drone speed and tracking, and you run away from a rando in system? Wtf?
---
Sorry not an AT ship, good luck with your failed petition
---
Hate to break it to you but there is fof raven bots and dscan bots. Thou I've only heard of a few groups using a dscan bot on those are Russian.
---
delete this thread to improve your petition chances 
---
wouldn’t want ccp to see that you got probed down like an idiot 
---
&gt;I don't see how CCP could change the game to to not cause people to use bots
---
it's not about removing bots, it's about reducing them to such a level that it's simply not worth botting. the reason botting is so prevalent is because there is simply content in eve you can do afk for 20 minute periods without touching your client
---
Bots in a system named 'CCP'.. :thonking:
---
Yeah, he's full of crap, he didn't pop his  cyno wreck and he's was scanned down before he had cloaked.
---
Not trying to defend him.  Delve just needs more cloaky campers like marshy (minus the broadcasting) to stop the true cancer on the game which is bots that require 0 human input. 
---
It'll recover eventually, so I'm just racking up millions of LP
---
&gt; you may get the NC vs TAPI drinking rematch
---
Looking forward to it!
---
"Bye Eve"
---
by ccp
---
This is the Eve wormholers want
---
Well it’s fair enough to grr gons hat gons these days but if you roam every corner of Eve, you’ll see they’re all infested with the bot menace.
---
Roaming will be much more fun when it’s actual people you’re hunting and not a ship scripted to immediately warp when you enter local.
---
Useless
---
... the fuck? Lol
---
Isn't this illegal?
---
But but but spod brains tell me local removal benefits botter...
---
Ffs ccp just drlay local through out null.
---
&gt;Yeah orbiting the stick is a common behavior amongst real players, i don't say only bots do this ofc, but when you see 80% of all VNI's acting the same within a region (like in the dronelands)... let's say it's quite suspicious
---
No, its not suspicious, because its the sane thing for a VNI-ratting player to do when you come to visit! 
---
&gt; When all of them are recalling at the same time, it's either scripted behavior or input broadcasting -&gt; both are bannable offenses 
---
Or its 30 players who all notice your name in local at the same time. In either case all you can do is report it and then CCP has access to data to see if its a bot, input broadcasting or just players. 
---
So if you report him and nothing happens, do you then assume you were correct and the jury was wrong? If you report and nothing happens, I'd wager its because its not a bot, and not input broadcasting. 
---
So report, then gtfo and stfu. 
---
&gt; Not at all, it's the impossible timing, not the action itself. 
---
I can wave my arm at a hundred mosquitoes and they all take flight at the same time. Its not "impossible timing". Its just that YOUR brain ASSUMES its one person in control of X VNIs and then you conclude "huh I couldn't do that without isboxer/botting programs" (And obviously there's no faster person alive than yourself so that's a valid comparison, you think). 
---
&gt; Nope, they're pussies but that's another problem we won't discuss in this topic. 
---
Or they could be like me, I only undock if there's a titan fleet to partake in. The big titan fights are the reason I play this game. Everything I do between those fights is to prepare more titans and faxes for the next big fight. I just don't think subcap fights are so interesting that I can do more than one subcap fleet a month. The snipey speedy meta doesn't help, since there's never a decisive subcap battle, one side just leaves when its apparent that they will trade badly. We might as well just send 1 dude each and have them do a duel at the sun. 
---
&gt; You must be really naive bud, i don't know how to explain this to you clearly but there are tons of bots on Eve.

---
You're naive too. You spend so much effort hunting these random VNIs, don't you think its likely that others spend tons of effort updating their market orders and ratting and hauling and so forth? 
---
If I count the amount of fees I have paid for order updates today, I have probably updated 2 000 orders today. Some days I don't update at all, some days I update once or twice, sometimes I update the orders every 5 minutes or so for several hours. And I'm just one person who don't even plex my accounts. Imagine a chinese bloke who really can't afford to pay the subscription, so he no-lifes the game for a few hours a day to make sure he can play omega for free.

---
Problem with creating more space is that the player density decreases even more.  It's probably a reason why CCP chose not to expand the universe to more galaxies (besides money reasons).
---
Abyssal space works because they're small independent rooms that collapse after 20 minutes.  If CCP wants to create more content, they should ***create some in lowsec and WH space.***

You are now all caught up. Have a nice day!

A golden bullet can kill hard, but it's not as good as a lot of bullets.
---
So you're saying more PvP would be a bad thing and that Eve does not need not want more PvP? Because more PvP is exactly what would happen if there were more direct, monetary incentive to PvP.
---
how hard can it be to move supers :thinking:
---
"local is empty ill be fine, I'll just tab out and watch some porn OH NO MY tITAN"
---
the current most popular bot program now warps bots off and they dock up when local is fucked
---
ping test on high performance core router is not reliable. Those routers use ASICs heavily and the ping is handled by management cpu which is kind of glued into the core routing ASICs. It's not uncommon to have high delays on pings when the router works normally.
---
I lost a carrier once and today local was broken, can i petition too? 
---
the throttling or his workaround ?
---
The ISP Throttling. The workaround seems legit
---
Well thats dissapointing
---
Do you realize you’re saying this literally 6 days after the CCP security team posted a devblog saying they banned 2000 botting accounts in the new year?
---
They’re obviously doing something and they seemt to be stepping up the anti botting fight, hopefully this is just the beginning of something bigger.

oof

This is great - adding them now

This isn't about tackling

People bot in all sorts of ships
---
Please forward me the info on these 20 hours fleets
---
Idiot.
---
This isn't a complaint. It's a call to action
---
Coward
---
It's not only about Delve, I'm interested in bots everywhere
---
Preach
---
It's only january and r/eve has already peaked for the year.
---
Keep your eyes open and please forward me info on any suspicious behavior!
---
Thanks
---
Delete bots
---
Thanks for the support
---
jspace best space
---
More to come
---
Lmao what? 
---
Test junior fc is trash, shocker
---
Awesome, thank you
---
results: nope, doesn't seem to bleed. I burned out my mids before I even did 0.01% of dmg to the guns on my vindi (large blasters + web in mids). seems to be no influence.
---
Additionally, having just one burned gun disabled the whole group, and splitting the group naturally let me use the other 7.
---
Awesome. Thx for testing it 
---
nice travel fit LMAO
---
Sadly in the EU it is kind of a grey area with lots of (intended) loopholes for big companies. 
---
Basically we still have some of the worst internet in the world, even african countries overtook most european countries, but as the politicians responsible for this area usually get all their stuff written by "counselors" payed by the big companies, that will not change i guess...
---
Atm it is possible for ISPs here to limit bandwith to certain Services that use a lot of bandwith over a long time (Streaming etc.) explaining it with "we have to do this to keep equal service for all customers", what is a lie. Bascally this is all about double payment.
---
Honestly, is anyone even surprised? Isn't this guy one of the FCs from the recently failed TAPI invasion? 
---
Please forward me the info
---
My pleasure, always good to test core mechanics like this when in doubt.
---
Yay more face paint...
---

---
Nice.
---
Lets hope the event isn't as shit as the frostline one was.
---
Can confirm, have had terrible issues that started occurring at \~roughly\~ the same time the new chat severs were deployed but by no means does that indicate anything more than a coincidence.
---
I have run trace routes over this time and noticed the connection hanging on multiple occasions generally to amazon registered addresses, but not being a network wizard I was a bit stumped about what to do next to help improve the situation. I was suggested by a friend to consider setting up a VPN but after hearing about a few ban waves that seemed to be triggered by players using VPN's for perfectly legitimate reasons I decided i'd rather not chance it.
---
Nonetheless the regular disconnects have stopped me being able to enjoy a variety of content and there is absolutely no way I wanted to risk high end abyssal's or getting into a super yet given the frequency of the issues.
---
I won't lie its actually kinda great that others are having these problems too because I now have a glimmer of hope that something positive might be on the horizon. Thanks for sharing this info.
---
From my perspective i have tools running / command typed in and the moment i notice something is happening i start it.     
---
Real issues is taking few seconds - but game is broken for much longer while. 
---
As I neighter fly nor hunt capitals I would really like to see an AAR from the hunters and how you go about this.
---
Someone mind explaining what a highsec ping is?
---
it's a 2003 game, it's to be expected
---
&gt; Test ~~junior~~ fc is trash, shocker
---
FTFY
---
Gala Astrahaus?
---
Gala Fortizar?
---
Are we going to have to structure bash?
---
That's so unfair. Thanks for the explanation.
---
are you serious?
---
really? I assumed he was one because at how bad his fleets are.
---
I lived 1 system off that pipe, never known they botted :/
---
LIterally this, The only time I've seen people sperg out is when they've been kicked for being a dick/spy/scammer/awoxxer and someone's forgotten to kick them from the appropriate chat channels too.
---
Quiet different from regular TAPI members being utter cancer to each other.
---
Besides 'Cpt So-bad' cant even spell plusten so I'm not sure if we should really believe he has any credible experience of horde's chat channels tbh.
---
But it IS a game...
---
Well the region can still be passed (as i did several times), maybe you should just not kill your own cynos laying a nice track all over the map and giving nice intel about what cynochar to stalk.
---
Also following the route planning of Dotlan 100% is a nice way to get caught ...
---
If you do a log off trap you usually have an alt in system cloaked 23/7, so you can figure out where they warp to and get the bubble right 
---
Don't tease, person who is definitely not doc weed.
---
+1. Was also in GOTG at the time. I remember ShartDragon constantly spamming for some bullshit crap like new rig, new dental treatment, diapers for his new kid and stupid crap like that? Like literally using his coalition to RMT his RL shit. Some suckers even ended up donating just to shut the retard up because multiple pings a day about a gofundme was getting really annoying.
---
It would definitely need a lot of thought. It'll never happen though so I'm not too fussed thinking of the logistics of it.
---
He deleted his reddit account, lmao.  200 iq tapi move
---
In some countries 
---
Yeah as usernames go its pretty good. Vastly more original than mine either way. Plus I like Lenny Kravitz music :')
---
Yes doing the web server. 
---
Game sever  (TQ) is srv200-c.ccp.cc, web server is srv91-c.ccp.cc   
---
I assuming (maybe wrongly that they sit in same location as when game dies - page is also dead.          
---
(simply don't want put additional pressure on game server)      
---
I used just defaults in MTR as there is no loss until i am getting desyncs and game is starting to die.     
---
If there was something blocking packets it should be doing this constantly - and i totally did not run MTR for like 2-3 hours to check if there is maybe a constant "leak".     
---
If there was additional firewall 
---
EU
---
It is not about ping but packet loss
---
None of those points help at all when 90% of our pilots are busy in RL when the timer comes out.
---
TZ issues are  real thing, mate. Nobody who has experienced this kind of warfare would contest that. (Well, nobody not being a blatant troll would.) There are maybe a handful of groups in the entire game that can realistically project significant forces across the entire TZ spectrum, and none of those are involved in the current Provi conflicts.
---
&gt; Are you trying to say that, you cannot contest or hold your space? 
---
No. The TZ advantage is in our favor when it comes to defending our own stuff, just like it is in your favor when you are defending yours. That's why we've essentially been in a state of stalemate for months now; why we each have citadels in each other's systems that have gone largely uncontested. Why we each basically hold the same sov we have since Legacy kicked PL out of the region.
---
You didn't even engage the machs the fighters did all the work. Km is broken and shows mach dps on structure bc of reship
---
This is good to hear.. looking forward to more hilarious stories :')
---
You can loot fittings / cargo from the people you kill. Isn’t that incentive enough?
---
Pretty accurate
---
Sounds like a great way to crowd-develop Skynet...
---
Where do I sign up?
---
PLEASE TAPI/GOONS TELL ME AGAIN HOW HORDE ARE PETS OF PL.....
---
Horde master race! 
---
\#awoxxersmakeusstronger
---
CCP didn't sell eve, PA bought CCP from private investors.
---
It's getting progressively worse. Logoff traps used to be awesome. Now it's worthless—logging in results in a black screen of 30+ seconds, and you'll often be out of warp and fully decelerated before you can even see someone.
---
Apparently they just combat scanned him before he cloaked, then warped at 0 to decloak him
---
Probe, Tackle, light cyno, HP reaches 0, jerk off.
---
Should I run for CSM?
---
This made me happy to read. You were always part of the fam, now your living in the frat house.
---
Here's to many good fights going forward &lt;3
---
oo ok thanks for clearing that up for me.
---
TLDR: TEST are mean to newbros and are bad at EVE.
---
Would be nice to have a Propaganda tag on this, just to save people some time.
---
Basically this should be the title of the Thread ...
---
That's why the next-level pizza topping of the Hidden Masters is actually haggis and banana.
---
Kissing girls is ok, just leave before they ask you to make breakfast or you're really fucked.
---
Beside gotta get in on some of those autz steadyo op's :'D
---
we dont necessarily need more space, we need good space.
---
I just want some good space.
---
Sorry for your loss
---
Aegis sov, upwell structures and capital rework don't count?
---
I don't particuarly approve any of those in their current state, but I'd hardly call the last 5 years radio silent.
---
Uh, what?
---
This totally passed me by, thanks for posting and brightening up my day! Serious comment btw.
---
Goon did fine 5/5 balls taking on a leash with a wolf. But that lesh fit was trash, give him advice.
---
Structure skins have been announced. Maybe these are the first 
---
only if you in TEST
---
He already deleted his thread. This thread is sarcastic 
---
who?
---
no way really 
---
This. As time goes on I have to dial the graphics back and not because EVE is getting ultra pretty. Other demanding games run just fine.
---
It's not always alts, one time I managed to snag a Firetail for really cheap. I'd still recommend just ignoring Jita local though, it's literally the one single time it's worked for me. Other times it's people trying to Ishkurs as Ishtars. 
---
Holy jesus, CCP finally introduced a basic UI feature after 15 years?!
---
Shitposting has peaked, this is the ultimate evolution
---
CCP needs to make existing space into good space.  Maybe expand WH space a bit so that it's more diverse instead of ranging from empty to why-space.
---
You guys are really salty for no reason.
---
If the local was broken titan will be reimbursed. If he lied about local being broken the titan won't be reimbursed. CCP can easily check that. There's no need to shit on people.
---
Gotta give them bots a chance.
---
&gt; Test ~junior fc~ is trash, shocker
---
try run one eve client on mac
---
You must be confused, FCs are people who lead player versus player fleets. Seddow specializes in logging in his Titan (or I guess, now his Capsule) to talk shit in local and bridge fleets he pinged for but has someone else FCing.
---
It's a Large Collidable Object, just filler.
---
I am sad because I have but only one down votr to give.
---
This is annoying as hell, I do agree.
---
Can I petition CCP to reimburse my titan if I lost it before DT coz local was borked? Asking for a friend
---
Guardian Angels have adapted and have learned that Havens and Sanctums do not work but they should instead spam citadels.
---
Adapt or die.
---
?
---
input broadcasting into a chat box is such a big fucking deal you guys, the local shitposting economy is ruined, no way can a little guy like me keep up with a guy multishitposting with 100 characters
---
I don't wanna play this game anymore, I'm unsubscribing
---
What is activity map?
---
I didn't get that server this time, only a bunch of telstra (aussie telco) related ones, then a bunch of Zayo ones (both uk and us), then srv200-c.ccp.cc .
---
I was tracing to tranquility.servers.eveonline.com.
---
I'll trace again when it's choppy
---
This screams of trying to be relevant...

Famed.... for what

&gt;And I mean if you want to quote Ghandi, I hope you don't mind if I quote MLK :-)
---
Really?
---
&gt;Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness. We must meet the forces of hate with the power of love... Our aim must never be to defeat or humiliate the white man, but to win his friendship and understanding - MLK
---
You are not advocating protesting violance you are advocating violance and it is a mockery of the man to take his words of peace and form them into a sword.
---
You are not even cognitive to the violance you have spewed to other members of humanity. You are purely hate and that makes you everything Martin Luther King Jr, apposed.
---
you camp chokepoint systems and/or collect intel from people with big mouths talking about their solo move to their corp/alliance (seddow is a confirmed bigmouth, so this is probably what happened)  
---
then you watch the map, look for cynos going up, or if you lose the char, run locates. think about where they're probably going, figure out the most relevant mids and particularly where the number of mid options drop low, move a prober/cyno close, the rest is history.
---
there's more intricacy to it but this is the high-level process. 
---
It's not like we've got anything else to do while we roam around not finding PVP and/or mindlessly krab ;)
---
And you're telling us this now because?
---
I imagine if you actually did some PVP rather than just talking about it, you might realise the incentive is the kill itself and for everyone else for over 15 years this has been enough. :thonking:
---
Yes you cannot use VPN, you need to contact CCP first to clarify stuff before you think about using it. 
---
Accelerator blueprints, more dumb resource gathering objectives like frostline?
---
Somewhere deep inside the bowels of TATA there is a network engineer who would love to work on this with you. 
---
The problem is getting to them when you are not a direct customer. 
---
Keep trying. 
---
Right. I don't understand where you're pulling mean to newbros from or being bad at Eve. You two seem to be projecting a bit.
---
Pretty sure CVA Citadels have been removed from our systems.
---
That and CVA recently proved that they could form for our timers, buy destroying one of our Raitaru in 9UY4-H in the early hours of the morning
---
I fix this by having a few routers in different cloud providers, and simply run GRE tunnels between them all. I have a simple script that sets the metric on each link to the latency, and each link has a specific time it is allowed to change metric to prevent any loops. For example with 3 intermediate cloud providers and 1 provider that directly peers with CCP in London, there is 9 links, and every 9 seconds each of them checks the latency with a 1 second limit and are offset to a different one of those 9 seconds. This guarantees that I have no more than 9 seconds of impact for any network congestion and TCP will never fail due to any intermediate provider.
---
Yeah, unable to access Stain via a low sec gate. 
---
OH YOU MEAN LIKE EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE

---
nobody knows who the fuck nightbl4de is, dude.
---

---
LOOK WHO’S TALKING
---
all accelerator drops will come from BPCs from now on
---
So your point here is to prove botting doesn't exist in new eden? Sure those 30 vnis with the same name on D could be 30 players looking local carefully, but do you really believe this? 
---
I can only suggest you go check for yourself since as you mention «i only undock when there's a titan fleet i can partake in». I roamed daily for months, everywhere in new eden and i can garantee you there's a fuckton of bots all around. 
---
Yeah I know, but they are a global provider so that didn't tell us much. The fact that the problems arise between Frankfurt and Amsterdam plus that the registrar/isp of the 'offending' party is a German GmbH might help to pinpoint the problem to somewhere in or immediately after the Frankfurt Internet Exchange, for instance. That's what I thought at least.
---
Yes he only multiplexed his inputs into chat, nothing else!! No proof! No proooooof!

Goodbye and good luck, cya next year when you resubscribe

I work for big company and within there is slight chance of getting to the proper person or someone contacting me ( i don't work in network related stuff ... i don't care or am interested in it as long as it works).       
---
In all seriousness, I mean, welcome to r/eve, dude. You aren’t going to know 100% of all the goings-on of every alliance out there. Anyone who plays in the southern part of nullsec will know why it’s relevant. People talk about things in their region. It happens. 
---
&gt; There's no need to shit on people
---
You must be new here.
---
I’m U.K. based and probably on quite direct tiering to London (will check routes tonight, I work for a tier 1 ISP so understand networking quite well)
---
I have zero issues with rubber-banding or drop outs which seems to go alongside what the OP is saying.
---
I’m direct cabled into my router and on high speed Virgin internet.

And this is why Net Neutrality is important...

Lol whoa. Seek help.

How much it cost you?

Has Titan. Doesn’t spam D scan for combat probes. Accidentally his whole space vessel.

I have a feeling this thread isn't going the way you expected. 
---
pm me link, Ill post it on my myspace

The point is, you're using oranges to test an issue with bananas. A lot of carriers rate limit ICMP traffic. That doesn't mean there isn't an issue, but MTR isn't gonna give you an accurate portrayal regardless.

TIKLE uses non eve chat clients to communicate with our NC PL overlords
---
Much safer and can’t be traced back to us
---
Says the RMT edgelord
---
Then he isn't really a "Famed FC" is he?
---
Has Titan, doesn't know about the great thing that is downtime and holding invuln :ok_hand:
---
Chop hasn’t stayed with either a toon name or alliance long enough to become relevant. It’s not that people don’t know him, it’s that he’s no where near e-famous enough for two reddit posts. Now if he could stay in an alliance longer than 30 days, that’d be reddit post worthy.
---
if the dude was relevant in any way at all the detective would know.
---
You're not getting out of this  that easily, friend.
---

---
*had titan
---
A 1050ti is not that bad is it?
---
kk will check that
---
Silence ... its Golden .... would had been if he had remained silent after the Titan loss
---
Right, because the actual FC has been banned for pinging too much? 
---
Kismeteer is a synonym of "Sabre pilot". Out of these 13.5 years probably 13.4 he spent in a sabre. Trust me, you want him in a sabre.
---
I enjoyed trading, building ships, running a corporation and building structures in space. I dabbled in piracy, lived in wormholes, and moved my Corp throughout nullsec. There’s plenty to do, just takes time and ISK. 
---
In-game they look like bricks made out of a couple polygons.  Since 2003 I've looked exactly once.  Probably why they don't have updated art.
---
 I get tiny rubber banding last night in abyss site I haven't had any issues ever I blame CCP for these new issues
---
What?! When did this happen? 
---
Shout out to Zen Tsai in RvB for that longbow corm fleet where we unwillingly used a tackled Eos as bait for half an hour just because we couldn’t break it. :D Was lots of fun. 
---
Can confirm, in early 2017 I was running 3 clients on medium on a half-broken 2014 macbook pro, lol
---
Now I can run 2, on a much better laptop, at the same level of performance. Some of this was visual upgrades, but idk
---
I'm just saying you make it sound like there's more bots than players, but the exaggeration doesn't make CCP take more action, it makes them take less action. 
---
Ask yourself, you ask your boss if he can lift 100 lbs five hundred times because otherwise the company is going to go under tomorrow. OR you ask your boss if he can lift 10 lbs a hundred times or else the company will lose a bit of money tomorrow but otherwise be fine. 
---
Which do you think will result in your boss doing something? If he does anything at all in the first case, it will be to write himself a big parachute paycheck and begin writing his resume for another job (probably find someone to blame for this company's failure, you perhaps). In the second case maybe the boss will do something along the lines you wanted. 
---
We know enough about the human brain to stop behaving in the exact ways which doesn't get what we want. If you ask for the moon you don't even get a hill.

YO CHIEF BETTER EDIT AGAIN NOW THAT NIGHTBLFOURDE LEFT FRAT

A 1050Ti isn't going to help much if the CPU is a 2.0 GHz, you've got 4-8gb of ram, a slow hard drive, or the cooling is bad.
---
You mean just goons and test?
---
Ah yes, the Test Alliance circle jerk I was looking for.
---
If he was in range to jump to a keepstar where he died jumping into that system 1 min before downtime unironically would have saved him. Poor planning leads me to believe he is a total dingus and hopefully won't get reimbursement.
---
$100-$200 a month.
---
Good luck in all you do guys
---
I didn't have chat service from 20min before dt and onwards, this thread is gold though
---
Yay... new ore which means mining asteroids!
---
Another event to pass for me!
---
Sure, some citadels have been killed on both sides. But only when enough people alarm clock in or dodge work. But that's something that happens outside the norm. We can't do that every other day.
---
I've personally lost a lot of sleep, and even taken days off work, for important timers. I've got the luxury of a pretty flexible RL schedule tho. Most people have families and work that can't just be put on hold because they are needed in a game.
---
Agree
---
1 month and you lost 1 billion? It sounds like you're flying ships that are too expensive. You can be an important member of your team, in a ship that costs less than 5mil as fast tackle. Most corps will have a cheap fit doctrine ship. 31:25 kill to loss ratio is horrific too. You need to be choosing your engagements better. I have single ships in my hangar with more killmarks than that, that cost under 10mil. If cost is really an issue to you, it's because you're doing it wrong.
---
Plot twist, they are actually just assholes. :'D
---
Literally just a random roaming fc 
---
 I have a market bot in Jita
---
Yeah but if you try mining in horde you get a super dropped on your procurers. Ask people like kanakkia or whoever has been around for six months now. I used to be part of horde and the fact that industry is nearly impossible there was a pain.

I got PTSD from the Discord ping noise while I was in Horde. I'm still recovering and I left in 2016.

Now offering New Eden's finest Torch and Pitchfork doubling service!
---
When the divine winds foretell of a super being moved, we sacrifice 5 goats aross the world in a pentagram shape. The center of course being the CCP servers. After several rituals to the dark gods, we blindfold ourselves and sit on the log in screen for 2 weeks with nothing more than microwave burritos and buckets. Occasionally we are rewarded by the demons that tear open a portal in the spaghetti code allowing us to immediately appear in system without a cyno.
---
That or we just had a warp hic in system. 50/50 really 
---
I think it’s a little annoying that I’m forced to do PvE stuff to be able to afford to PvP.. which is what I enjoy doing most. 
---
Sounds like you need to start killing bigger ships then!

Lmao just earlier you claimed chat wad busted 1h before your tit died
---
Local is broken, lets use Dota lobby 
---
Yeah, because this sub is frequented by people who patiently wait for all the facts to be verified before voicing their opinions in an articulate manner. 
---
your honor, remove the witness
---
Please send me information on this ingame
---
Probably
---
Yeah it’s fun. That’s why I do it. I’m wondering where the incentive is though. Every single other game I’ve played gives you an incentive to PvP.. whether that be gear or an in game rank.
---
PL player (according to flair, at least) randomly offering up old stories of how his start in TEST was bad and drove him from the game, while TEST was being driven back by PL.
---
With the TEST and PanFam conflicts going on right now, for several months in fact, you are expecting people to believe this isn't a propaganda piece?
---
I mean, come on. Who do you think you're fooling here?
---
PROPAGANDA ISNT MEANT TO BE ACCURATE
---
This is the solution that eve needs for botting. Just kill local chat.
---
You people are so "Thenthative" around here. Tho Therial...
---
Let's see:
---
1. Jumps in 23 minutes before DT instead of 23 seconds before down time
---
2. Doesn't use a self destruct cyno. The [cyno](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74768788/) was alive long enough for his titan to load grid, lock it (titan locking a stealth bomber takes a bit), and shoot it. No wonder he got caught.
---
You done fucked up son. 
---
The proper way to move a titan:
---
1. Jump in 23 seconds before downtime. Hold invuln until downtime.
---
2. If you absolutely can't wait until downtime, use a self destruct cyno. Cyno up and jump in &lt;5s before the self destruct finishes.
---
are you using a bot to make these posts?
---
What happened 4days ago? Cause delve rorqual botting has been going on for much longer
---
Every single other game I’ve played incentivizes PvP with either gear or in game rank. I’m 29 years old and have played a lot of MMOs. Eve is literally one of the only games I’ve played where you have to have an in game job to afford pvping.
---
I don't say CCP doesn't ban any bots, seems the security team is looking for a permanent solution and i hope they'll succeed. But judging by the amount of bots i encounter (let's say "possible" bots), the problem is actually way bigger than you think and we need to solve it before TQ turns into serenity.
---
I didn't even check for rorqual bots tbh, i'm already getting mad at those fucking VNI/gila/nightmare bots, no need to add some more salt in the wound... 
---
&gt;If you have any information about bots, please evemail me in game and I will add it to the ever growing database
---
Have you ever thought your database might be worth something, if it contained evidence too?

Can we instead talk about OOS botting missions in Venal? ))

My asumption is that they sit in the same location.

Thanks I’m glad at least 1 person agrees with me. It’s frustrating because I wish I could have known this before I started playing.. you have to get deep into the game to see this glaring problem. I made a post on here about how the PvP is in general before I started playing and nobody mentioned this, it got like 80 responses and 99% of them saying it was great.

The kill marks don’t work half the time and honestly who is looking at your ship for them?! You can’t even notice them!

The war you're referring to was in 2016.
---
Spamming this without any evidence is a sure way to get something done. I appreciate your support. 
---
it has basic boosters - this type of event usually sucks ass
---
A petition once told me that Local is not a means to verify hostiles or some crap like that, so therefor losing a ship due to local not being available is not a cause for reimbursement.  I petitioned to a Senior GM which tool 12 days to respond and gave me back my VNI and a few days time cause of the wait.  So depends who you talk to I guess in the ccp/petition world.
---
them having similar naming conventions has nothing to do with them being colocated.
---
im talking combat/infrastructure/industrial/logi alt armies. im talking FOTM and meta injecting. im talking bought supers and titans on an alliance level scale. im talking me flying 4 combat chars while you are flying one. im talking power and coalition level. you talk about being dumb and wasting your money on plex to solo in expensive blingy big ships (which, btw, is p2w as well, just not as idiot proof as literally any other method).
---
Thank you for making it easier for us to stack the CSM with our guys.

You'd think they'd be very familiar with that, given, well, OriginDOT's origins.

maybe... ;)

If you put as much effort into solving your daddy issues as you did botting you'd be happier inside

A friend of mine was reporting rattles not staying close to an MTU as commanded and drifting off, disconnects for one account in particular, and instawarps in a pve rattlesnake. Could it be connected to this?
---
???? No....

Copypasta in a Word document, and an alarm to start the thread at the same time every day.

Gotta respect the dedication.

What? How are you not moved to tears by his sincerity and passion.
---
and most of those are dead in a matter of half a decade. and i guess that all of those MMOs you mentioned aren't a sandbox but rather a theme park.
---
That's the big difference: theme park gives you incentive to do shit. in a sandbox you have to find your own reason for your actions. For me it's being a mean pirate

I have an alarm that tells me to save eve at 09:22 EST daily 
---
AAR , trasher toon comes into local , ZKill check , oh avatar killing his own cYno.
---
CYno went up , combat scan , avatar pilot jumps in , 1x hit , cYno goes does down.
---
Jumps hic Into local,

Second scan same spot , avatar disappears 
---
Warps prober to the spot at 10 , warps hic to the prober , decloak the avatar , warps prober off , tackles titan with hic , titan instantly starts shooting the hic with cap guns,

Since he had cap guns on the kill 2 hour earlier , keep orbit, , warp in bomber for cYno , deploy inhib , more Hics .. dreads dead

Titan pilot gfs in local warps off

---
You seem to be living under the delusion that your chosen activity shouldn't be countered, because it's unfair and microgang roaming for ganks or good fights is some kind of special activity that needs to be supported by CCP. 
---
Fuck off, bitch.
---
Counter them or GTFO is how Eve has always worked.
---
Yikes to see the north on the cringe post wagon
---
this post gave me an aneurism..
---
No, but they are sitting in the same subnet - why then put additional load on the game server if this subnet is not the issue here but stuff before it?      
---
TBH decided to do the main test on the web server simply to not get auto-banned on TQ :P       
---
Aren't you the guy that got blacklisted for racism? 
---
What is horde even picking up in this exchange?  Like 5 active dudes in a corp that's greatest achievement was giving wizard hat the middle finger and slowly withering away into obscurity? 
---
You dig through your neighbors garbage and brag about stealing his dinner scraps?
---
I mean, regardless of whether Local was broken, he did about 15 other things wrong moving his Titan... which is why he died.
---
Hey Sparty, those are funny looking Gilas.
---
they are currently sending pings to form a reddit fleet in order to downvote all these comments. Eve is no joke
---
Hard to say but can be.      
---
If stuff is getting unresponsive and DC then it most likely is related to network issues. 
---
delet
---
I hope you have actually reportet some names and watch them and not just keep posting this just cause there are rorqs in delve
---
I think that has more to do with the ease of accruing Gurista LP than the boosters. It only takes like one or two characters sharing one round of burners to get them pulling too. You can do this infinitely because every account that has a puller pays for itself with one week of pulling. That and the popularity of the items from the Gurista LP store have ensured an oversupply. 
---
I got a br that says other wise.
---
Do you want to run as a Grrrrr Gons or as a Grrrrr Bots csm? 
---
Becaus i feel like rorqual botting is less of a problem then all of the other bots and imput broadcasting( =/= botting). And Delve isn't the only region with bots, all of eve has them, some regions possibly more than Delve.
---
The weirdest bit has to be that only one out of 2 or 3 boxes DCs so it can't be the local internet or the PC that was the problem...
---
Bruh I won eve a long time ago. But I have distinct memories of hudders spamming the fuck out of pings for every inconsequential thing, like ganking a ratting carrier that wasn’t even tackled and things like that. Or, saving his own dumbass carrier.
---
Turns out, when every ping you send is super max important all hands on deck, people just ignore you.
---
Also, isn’t he banned from /r/eve for being a toxic shitter? That should tell ya something.
---
Look I'm in Lazerhawks now.
---
Anyways, I get you and PanFam are in a "war", watching from afar it seems more like you guys are shaking your fists at each other and that the whelps really don't mean much with how much is being built.
---
At least then the war felt real and as a new player while it was going down, it was the only thing that kept me interested in the game. I'm sorry this comes off as a propaganda post against TAPI, I would hope it would be more seen as a flag to CCP that without meaningful player driven content generators the game is boring as dick.
---
same subnet also has no bearing on colocation, you don't seem to understand infrastructures of scale
---
What’s the argument? It’s clear what your argument isn’t but I still can’t figure out what your argument is. 
---
Ummm i mine have since 2009 when it was dirty and not goooney so yeah not sure what you are talking about. But if you want to meet in eve i mine in m2-in delve.
---
Was it a "tantrum" when Susan B. Anthony fought for women's suffrage? Heroic reformers always ruffle the feathers of the entrenched powers.

Ive been in goons for over 6 years or is it 7 i cant remember. But yeah TOTALLY RISK AVERSE OHHHH FEINS HURT FEELINGS.
---
Ouch don't want to spend so much on game :D

Wouldn’t that be the same thing though?
---
ignores the insta warp out mechanic, takes issue with docking.... 
---
Im aware that not all vni's rattles and gila I don't get tackle on are bots and that any discussion should be nuanced.  You literally said nothing in that entire post and instead chose to ignore everything except the docking.  
---
It is clear that talking to your  entrenched mindset is pointless. You are a moron. I award you no points and may Bob have mercy on your soul.

Nope, never had to.

But initially i did it to tq and had similar route (will recheck) so i  decided to use web server.

Depending how much of packets where lost by client.

No, i'm certain that Goons have their share of bots, but some Renter alliances are worse
---
Is there a way I can volunteer to help mod the subreddit?
---
no you aren't, fuck off and die
---
I would run as well, but I have no time. So I will apply with a bot, which is the new meta anyway.
---
You're absolutely right. We need to fight for bot suffrage. Is a bot not entitled to the sweat of its brow?
---
They gave you a 20 minute warning - exactly what you need.

If you’re in Abyss, you have less than 20 minutes left anyway?

you first
---
Could you elaborate?
---
Aww, too bad. Your thread got deleted by a moderator. 残念
---
Fair enough.  To be clear i'm not trying to haze you at all, I'm just working on the first cup of coffee still so I'm a little curt heh.
---
I don't know what's MORE disappointing. That the bots aren't easy prey when local is broken, or that CCP has taken so long to fix local that the bots are now programmed in how to work when the game DOESN'T work.
---
I hate valkorsia.  he's coarse and irritating and gets everywhere.

Well, originally had something different planned with this destroyer lineart, but it turned out too pretty. So I decided to turn it into a wallpaper. Its 1920x1080 since that's my screen resolution, but since its vector art I can resize it for anyone who is not using a poverty display. 
---
I hear a good way to comport oneself is to repost a thread that's been deleted by a moderator.
---
Reality is often disappointing.
---
Well thanks for the tip! I didn't know. 
---
Please put the Catalyst the correct way round... 
---
Cancer requires healthy tissue afaik, Eve is as healthy as a 16 year old corpse that you’ve dug up and have to tape back together before indulging in some necrophilia.

that sounds like a point against your original argument tbh

there is probably a chance a network engineer responsible, or someone who knows the guy, is also an eve player.

I think the intel channels that are automatic are worse than the botting tbh.
---
WOW has gear scaling. You can spend 50 bucks or so day one and buy max level. Join a random battleground and hit as hard as the guy next to you. Granted you still need the skill to do it. My main point was that with eve you have to be able to have a constant income to fund yourself, so at some point you have to do something you might not enjoy in-order to do something you really enjoy
---
A 10% speed loss isn't a minor loss. They're also losing the tackle range bonus uniqueness to combat ceptors.
---
Your proposal weakens them so much that they are entirely eclipsed by AFs and combat ceptors in everything but taxi-ing. You can do everything they can except nullification with a combat ceptor using a hyperspatial rig; moreover they arent strong enough to stay on-grid and anywhere close to a Sabre anymore due to the speed loss, so the nullification is a bit useless as an on-grid positioning tool.
---
The agility also isnt super helpful for positioning either.
---
I agree, this pass would kill fleet ceptors in everything but the travel taxi role.
---
Well in my case that just tells me I'm screwed since I play on a mobile internet connection, which seems to drop packets without reporting it (or at least that's my best idea why I get corrupted downloads)
---
I actually went on a fleet last night killing a goon pos. Then nidia told me I was dumb for bring my carrier :(
---
at least half of Omist is filled with bots in gilas (all ships named agent) and none of the chars are over a month old.
---
Answer these questions:
---
Why are you running for CSM?
---
How much time do you have to dedicate?
---
What kind of experience and insight do you have to bring to the table?
---
catalysts don't get special snowflake exceptions and have to face front, like all the other destroyers. It'd the odd duck out, and has been turned for visual unity. 
---
America doesn't care. We're too worried about McDonald's and Toddlers in fucking Tiaras. 
---
Snuffed left the Imperium a while ago on friendly terms, they will still work with Goons to kick panfams nuts from time to time, all while being able to get dank frags in delve or elsewhere now. 
---
I remember back in the day when EVE had two different clients, the low graphics and high graphics client. I was stuck on that low graphics client for so long with my potato of a computer. Good old Trinity expansion...
---
EVE has always been relatively low entry level, it's one of the best things about it, the accessibility. Though it would be impressive if you could get it running on a reasonably capable tablet, I've heard it can be done.
---
i was expecting actual spaghetti on your keyboard :(
---
All 3 active members are welcome!
---
I don’t know why, but I feel inclined to blame this mar5hy guy
---
They misspelled 20 hours
---
Nice sluthing, but there's one problem.
---
[eveonline.com](https://eveonline.com) is their web servers.  Not Tranquility.  IIRC they aren't hosted at the same datacenter.
---
You need to run your traceroutes to Tranquility's IP address, which is [87.237.34.200](https://87.237.34.200) according to [eve-offline.com](https://eve-offline.com).  Your packets will not get all the way to tranquility because ICMP gets dropped before it hits TQ.
---
The Catalyst has already been given special snowflake exceptions because you put it that way round. I understand why you've done it, but the ship should be 90 degrees right...
---
It simply looks wrong that way round, as it is just not correct. 
---
"Why does everyone have cat ears?"
---
Tell me how pvp is supposed to be "more enjoyable".
---
I am aware that this may bother some Catalyst pilots. CCP please fix Catalyst, its clearly flying in the wrong direction :D
---
This post is such an epic example of how someone with no technical knowledge except a few buzzwords can drop a 5000-word post and get it upvoted by other idiots with absolutely no technical understanding.
---
Upvoted for truth. My condolences, haha
---
F
---
You're not as deep into the game as you think you are if you claim that the lack of isk-making in pvp is a "glaring problem".
---
Can you tell Hudders and the IT dude sperging in the logs this golden nugget of knowledge?
---
Well, can't blame the brewers too hard here. You have to make some bottom of the barrel shit to break even at that retail price (1.25$) and unless you're Molson Coors or InBev/Labatt/whatever, you either have insufficient volume or your brand will take too much of a hit.
---
That's not really something to trust to randoms.
---
why not make one interceptor not show in local?  
---
like how combat recons don't show on D-scan.
---
&gt;uses tcp instead of udp
---
Traceroute uses [ICMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol), which is not UDP or TCP.  And there are no ports in ICMP.
---
&gt;simply don't want put additional pressure on game server
---
You won't.  CCP's firewall blocks ICMP.
---
Looks like just another boring event =(
---
YOU CAN"T HANDLE THE TRUTH!
---
Nooooo Seddow!!! Noooooo!
---
Why would anyone ever lie about horde pings?  That's something anyone can easily verify.
---
I had exactly the same problem. 1-3 disconnects a day and packet loss at a TATA router just before tq. I changed providers and problem was better 1 disconnect a fortnight or so.
---
Hey I just signed up to let you know back when I was playing Black Desert Online a lot, one of my friends began having the exact same problems you described, with the packet loss problem seen using a traceroute. He talked to his ISP about it to no avail, as well as Pearl Abyss. A small amount of other people had the same complaints and  if I recall correctly could be tracked down to Pearl Abyss's side, though due to the nature of the beast, the ISP and the game providers are just going to point fingers at eachother. My friend avoided the packet loss by using a VPN, which I guess used a different route. 
---
Hope you get the issue sorted. It's a more common problem in MMOs than is talked about it seems. 
---
Windows solely uses ICMP, other OS’s can use other protocols. 
---
lost more titans moving then fighting
---
It was released in October 2016... so "a few years ago" it was pretty much a top range card.
---
That thraser has a zkill history of *just* cynp ships.
---
Who would be foolish enough to think something sweet is dropping with that guy in system.
---
:thinking:
---
Nightbl4de is a fun FC.  He hands out ships, doesn’t care about losses or killboard stats, he just roams looking for fun fights.  We were sorry to lose him, I loved his roams.  I’m glad it didn’t work out with Frat, maybe he will come home :)
---
You can use other protocols to do something like ping and traceroute.  But if you literally run ping or traceroute on linux, MacOS, android, DD-WRT, iOS, or your toaster, it will use ICMP.
---
Sorry but CCP runs Eve Online, they are responsible.
---
Have you seen the rest of this subreddit today? ITT: "local couldn't have been broken, this dude is clearly lying". In this sub: "Reeeee local isn't working, CCP pls restart servers". Smh.
---
Devices can be on the same subnet, on the same network, and be in different parts of the world.
---
Best bet, if the buy order is only 10% less than the sell order, then sell to the buy and be done. If it's a huge margin difference, you will encounter the resistance you did. That gap might be there for a real reason, or it's being manipulated. If you want to see it sell fast, then stop playing the small game (worrying about 100K isk for example, and just mark yourself 10% lower than the best sell offer. It screws the 1iskers, and while it may short you some cash, you'll get paid faster
---
The timer is 20 minutes, and you got a 20 minutes heads up, not sure I see the problem.

You know becoming a famous meme on r/eve isn't cheap 😞
---
I ran two clients on a 2012pc with no GPU.

PC died two days ago. But I feel you bro.
---
Also no eve now gg.
---
I think I got 3 forms of cancer when I joined Deadman's Squad when their leadership had Hudders and Proxy Imity. I'm surprised he made it this far.
---
I'm curious on the actual timing, so is local fucked before DT or just after DT? 
---
Did he say local fucked before local is actually fucked or the local is indeed fucked but just for some people ?
---
I enjoyed reading it
---
No you don’t understand, he fit his titan like that BECAUSE local was broken. It’s all CCP’s fault
---
tfw side catalysts are mini myrmidons 
---
:o
---
If they don't notice the notification, they're fucked. But the shutdown being 20 minutes long means anyone in an active pocket would already be out or dead.
---
&gt;who at CCP thought it would be a great idea to change the shield and hull alarms of a 16 year old game?
---
nobody u did it yourself

Almost everyone lives on or near a major backbone.

Technically, your connection can be throttled at any point from your demark to the destination router.  If your destination is on the other side of the country, your data could be carried by 10 different companies in numerous different routes, back and forth.  It's not always a straight shot.  I'm about 300 miles from Chicago, but if I route to a data center there, it could go to Nashville first, which is the opposite direction.

Catalyst drifting is the way sideward

I will concede to your point 🙂

Maybe they're finally going to display territory by ihub instead of TCU.

Also jump bridges shouldn't require a planet and moon anymore.

I'm guessing this is an attempt to be Evictus propaganda, you should just leave it to test, they are much better at it.

Haef, the racist in imperium right? You should probably check what people say about you mate
---
If you have 20k HP with with all 50% resistances, you will have 40k EHP. But the killmail will say you took 20k damage.

happy to explain.

Who was coming where now?
---
And why would anyone firesale in the days of asset safety?
---
Combat Recons dont show up on D-scan at all tho. I think you can still probe them.
---
Why are the moderators of /r/eve in league with botters? Do they hate the game and want it to be worse?
---
Cannot fucking believe they brought Eagles to fight Ishtars (who were extra kin/therm tanked)..
---
The day that my ISP gave up and connected me with a network engineer was indeed a magical day.
---
Had issues on a specific node on a route to a gameserver, explained to the guy, mailed him some diagnostic stuff. Five minutes on the phone and he put in an order to do a peering change to route around the issue. Called me back the next day after the networking changes propagated, had me run diagnostics again and the problem was gone.
---
If he was bubbled by a onix can’t he doomsday the fuck out of it and warp off to safe and cloak?

Just run a dscan bot like lots of WHers do.....

you fail to realize NB doesn't care about losing fights, only about having fun, so posting a video of one fight you won is irrelevant anyway :p
---
Why is that a thing ? A solid half of this game doesn't want to mine rocks ...
---
interesting, i have seen killmails w/ rattings ships (vnis usually) w/ "taken damage" in the quarter or half million range, so i assumed it just counted the incoming damage and tallied up as it died 
---
I'm not. I just decided to post seriously for once.
---
Saw all the hate towards that guy. People shitting about his pings, fc skills and whatnot and kinda felt bad for him.
---
At least for now we don't know if his local was borked or not. Chances are it was (as many others complained about local about DT today and CCP did reset the servers). For me it's not as clear as the Pohds case so I kinda want to give him the benefit of the doubt.
---
Anyhow I feel like this whole nullblob warfare (The South vs The North) turns into reddit hate towards the other side. Member folks, memes are good, hate is bad.
---
Played this scam game against a character named JitasBillyMays or something. Never had so much fun being scammed. :) Accidentally bought a VNI for 411m. Made some of it back though with the discounted contracts.
---
Judging by your post history you don't even know whats going on in Test lol
---
The problem lies with your ISP and their route to ccp servers.
---
I and my corpmates that are using the same ISP had a problem last year with random socket closes, we all got them at the same time. 
---
We had to contact our ISP and query them about this and send them traceroutes to tranquility and they fixed the issues with adjusting the bgp routes to tranquility.
---
Cool story of a big war swirling around a new player who has no idea what's going on. Probably should have dropped the anti-TEST shit though, they will all downvote it. Looks like anti-TEST propaganda 
---
Scrub local allready ffs, then you won't need to worry about your pissy banned botters ddosing you.
---
Yet again, CCP delay local in nullsec.
---
Yeah, reminds you of PL's GLORIOUS triumphs in Provi right? Next time PL loses a big toy I'll be sure to generalize it to your entire falling alliance as well.
---
I love these events!! Can’t wait
---
You "fail to realize" that I am neither black sky nor frt, this is just a feeble attempt at propaganda.   
---
Test has a learning program for the mentally challenged on how to reddit if you need help.
---
I feel like anyone who complains about the amount of Imperium members in CSM don't really understand how CSM works and probably shouldn't even run.
---
It's almost as if they want you to conduct proper warfare.
---
Welcome to Horde!
---
&gt;Why is that a thing ?
---
To make them more valuable? To make people actually work for them?

Then just buy them on the market.

Usually constructed of stainless steel, which is easy to clean and durable, but may be cold, hard, and uncomfortable to use. Also, the supporting area of some products is very small, and prolonged use can cause pressure ulcers. Picture for reference.

dude its reddit.  serious + reddit = you need a beer.

You described every corps' comms.  
---
Did you pipe up and ask questions?  It's pretty common for guys who have been flying internet space ships for years to talk about their level of internet spaceships. It is also common for newbros to be intimidated so they stay quiet. Best way to fix that is to just ask your question.
---
Annoying? Well, I mean it's Test comms.
---
I know right? He forgets prop mods

is this 1444p or 4k? Whatever, I want it.

You didn't like 1 site per region, stripped of value shortly after DT?

I'm waiting for tier 3 destroyers/attack destroyers.

Well for me, the incentive is in the experience and to improve. The game has so many different mechanics and niche's that PVPing just for the fun and the learning experience is enough to keep most people busy for quite a while. Also while it's definitely true that PVP is generally an isk negative activity, its entirely possible with experience to come out on top.
---
I am by no means 'great' at pvp but I have just shy of 3000 kills to 230 losses and at that point I would say I kill vastly more than I lose, maintaining that K/D ratio and having fun at the same time provide all the incentive I need. In-game ranks are all well and good but would actually act as a deterrent to fights since it would be a huge red flag to engaging players that are marked have more experience/kills. Forcing fights is hard enough as it is, personally I don't think providing players with more reasons to avoid fights is a great strategy.
---
35K coalition vs 2500.

Also, third most active PVP alliance with only 2500 guys, but are still dead

Yeah because the posts on this sub are so precious...

That was a pretty significant client overhaul and ended support for some older machines. We're probably approaching that situation again with the 64-bit client coming Soon™.
---
I have different hosts on the same subnet on different continents.
---
&gt;   anyone in an active pocket would already be out  
---
What? The shutdown was immediate and lasted the exact duration of a site. Meaning anyone who was in the PVE portion of a site is 100% dead. 
---
Why don't we just break cloaky camping as well so the carebears can be even more safe.
---
Lemme get this straight... You want to take away SP because someone put a bounty on someone else? That would give ANYONE the ability to place a bounty and obliterate a character's progress with 1 kill. Even with limitations, wiping someone's progress that took -years- is silly. This is an awful idea
---
&gt; talking to your entrenched mindset
---
My entrenched mindset that there's nuance involve in deciding whether one set of facts implies another?
---
And you think I'm the moron Mr Dunning–Kruger?
---
CCP doing their part to kill off abyssal pvp as fast as possible. 
---
The countdown before shutting down was 20-something minutes. Notice the post time, compared to the shutdown time?
---
&gt; To make them more valuable? To make people actually work for them?
---
Because running the sites isn't working to get it ? If they want to make them valuable, make it longer to obtain, not force people to mine to be able to build it.
---
&gt; Then just buy them on the market.
---
Yes because the price isn't massively more important due to this
---
There is t3ds, but they can only go into medium plexes. Would quite enjoy flying mini oracles though. That said, would quite enjoy mini versions of all the ships. Shuttle sized Avatar, when? 
---
Try harder next time
---
The notification says 'immediately'. Was there another pop-up from CCP 20 minutes prior?
---
The mental gymnastics required to see your point of view are borderline heresy against the human condition.
---
For both of them trace route was the same until last to hops, so i didn't want to put pressure on the game server.       
---
Checked just now, it is still the same - but today i don't have Frankfurt on the list and it starts with Amsterdam 
---
Yep.
---
judy mikakka is a fag
---
Jaguar isn't an interceptor though. While i don't oppose a rework that maybe is for a different discussion?
---
and a protector of the bots
---
You can put the krab in the super but krabs don't have people hands and are unable to control their ships beyond the F1 key
---
In that case only people in the PVP arena could potentially have gotten screwed. Sucks to be them.
---
In the Frostline event, the ratters would get the skins and Accelerator BPCs.
---
To build them you had to acquire the components (mine)
---
Get over yourself idiot
---
No one cares about you
---
He posted first, talking about how he knew exactly what he was doing and did everything right. 
---
Turns out he actually did almost everything wrong.
---
People would care a lot less if he didn’t post. 
---
Newbie here. I know Jita well, but what's all the hullabaloo about Stain?
---
Perimeter Ops are SuperImportant.   
---
You will be going there alot.   
---
Have fun!
---
What? No. There exists a tier of battlecruisers (larger ships of a class of ships that fit cruiser weapons) that fit large guns. So it appears consistent to give the destroyers, of which there are only two tiers for each race, a third tier to reflect the same structure of the battlecruiser class which have tier 3 which fit large guns. 
---
Make a 3rd tier of t1 destroyers that fit medium weapons.
---
Yeah this seems like a good call for sure. One day you'll get that gate bud and all the shit posts and mediocre posts will be worth it &lt;3
---
It's more due to people being afraid of losing their ship than being afraid to lose income.
---
Even if we adopted your proposal, why would anyone pvp given that there is the risk of losing your ship and getting nothing. Even if you decrease NPC bounties, people will just spend more isk getting additional alts for lower guaranteed income. They won't suddenly become pvpers overnight just because you decided to open up another isk faucet.
---
This is awesome! Do you have any plans for more?
---
&gt;so i didn't want to put pressure on the game server
---
1) The pressure of an ICMP packet is trival.
---
2) Your packet won't reach Tranquility anyway, because a firewall will drop it before it reaches the server itself.
---
this put a smile on my face.
---
/u/seddows i haven't forgotten about you, shithead. 
---
The constant need for attention Elo is starting to get old. Just get over your alliance is stagnant and you arent going anywhere, not getting any ISK to RMT for Cocaine or rent. You arent going to make a difference with the bots, you arent going to make CSM. Just get over it.
---
Yes and before you would get the skins and the Accelerators. So you have to mine to get it, or pay to get them. So basically you either have to spend more time, invest in SP, or pay isk to get the reward, which makes it not that worth it if you dread PvE in general.
---
I mean at least PL took a region to lose with their sub/cap deployment, unlike TEST's 0 systems in Geminate right now.

It never occurred to me until looking at this that the Catalyst is a slightly less spiky horizontal Nightmare and now I can't unsee it.

Pretty much anyone who started after 2013 has 0 idea what you're talking about re: tiers of BCs :p
---
Because of the invul field and the shield rig, the shield will last a bit longer. But in this time, the armor repairer does not work, the armor rigs do nothing. Once the shield is dead, it's the other way: The invul field does nothing but eat cap, the rig does nothing. 
---
It's much better to give up these few seconds shield buffer and improve the armour tank instead and/or give more attack power - e.g. another armor rig for stronger tank and a second web or a target painter to kill tackle.
---
There's another clear sign for a bad fit: The costs are very unbalanced. 400M ship, 300M rigs and what about the modules? Only cheap shit, not one of them more than 10M. If you can't afford some blingy modules, too, don't put that much money into hull and rigs. That's never efficient.

Surface pro? they're pretty decent machines.

I'm afraid I don't have an actual answer for you, but what does downtime have to do with this?
---
Eve, the only game where if you don't have a degree in economics, it will actually hurt your chances of doing it right.
---
Kids, google opportunity cost. 
---
IIRC the corp standings are recalculated at downtime

personally i'd recommend one of these, a must have accessory for all rekkingcrew pilots and budding super hunters like.

Stain is a (nice) NPC Nullsec region but can't be reached through anything else than Sov Null around it. StainGuy (and others, but mostly him) have called for a Gate to Lowsec from Stain for years now. It's some kind of evergreen meme on eve subreddit.

Typical fleelo knight ran from delve and now fleeing from the reality his alliance is trash and couldn't even take one system in delve from goons

Second this. Would love to see if you have more!

Its funny that you think that literally anyone cares about Providence 9 months on. If you guys were less focused on what we did in the past and had your heads in the present you might not be getting triple roasted by a bunch of new beans, some dead has beens and some dudes who don't undock. 
---
Yeah and like I said all of the network engineers I know would be excited to work on locating a problem like that with a customer that actually knows how to provide diagnostic data. 
---
This has nothing to do with anything client side or ISP throttling, it's interesting how you noted this however.
---
The server in front of the main TQ server is the load balancing proxy node. It determines the order by which commands come in from the clients and which to prioritize sending to the TQ python queue first.
---
Explains why you only notice it in high volume fights where rubber banding and disconnects occur.
---
poor probes get all neglected

1050ti is a pretty limited model, tbh. Low end of the 10x0 range.

Which ISP? Good lord, I haven't heard of a residential ISP caring enough to actually create a ticket for demonstrable routing issues. You sir have a good ISP. 
---
I don't see TNT, I just see Proximity Alert. We took a shot on a target we didn't originally plan on and it went as expected. 
---
I actually prefer to jerk off through the entire process.
---
Hit or miss huh?
---
Which is kind of what you'd expect and hope for if you were told the basics of EVE and started theorycrafting.
---
Worst case is what happened to Serenity.  One big blob.
---
It's no secret that CCPs upstream network service provider is crap. They should probably have done their research on the NSPs performance before spending millions building out a datacenter and running fibre... Sorry guys, not sorry, the fault here lays squarely on CCP.

Taking the flair bait. We tried to follow with TEST example of feeding dreads but we could only feed so much at a single time. Maybe if we brought subcaps we could of said we won too.

how exactly does this cause local to not work?

Did you know TEST has the best PI program in EVE?

Trust me you don’t want to see judy screenshots and leaks

They literally are losing nothing but speed. 
---
They get a warp speed buff, inertia buff and the scram/disruptor range bonuses are added to roles instead of a traits. Same as the cap usage role bonus.
---
Dang, it took you half an hour to calm down after getting two threads got?
---
That's fair but to also be fair every skillu engagement so far has been chain headshotting unless all anchors use monitors. They have a spy who calls anchor the moment we switch every time. Legacy comms can be quite the fucking shit show anyway though.
---
Lol whats with the down votes dudes, it was clearly a comical reference to the test guy who lost his titan; [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ajc2si/quality\_reddit\_content\_thanks\_to\_dead\_test\_titan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ajc2si/quality_reddit_content_thanks_to_dead_test_titan/)

Sadly no, some store brand thingymajigger. Its got a decent amount of Ram and the CPU is fine, but integrated graphics means potato mode most of the time. 
---
&gt; I forgot to say I learned how to do this from watching a dude named Finnie Caderu in Dodixie and have seen his contracts get taken in the ranges of 13 billion to 60 billion. 
---
I just can't help but think, any multi billion "scam" is actually RMT.
---
Nullsec mining is actually pretty fun if you enjoy the social aspect of the game. I do it for that reason and for near-passive isk making. You should explore null if this sounds interesting for you. There have been a few different corps suggested here. I recommend looking at each to see what you like best. 
---
If you want to solo pvp, you can't really go wrong in Black Rise or any FW space for that matter. Black rise is probably the most active and close to null but you can find blobs here too so your solo roam will turn into a gang bang in a hurry if you're not paying attention. Some of the people here are dicks. Others will tell you exactly why and how you died and even share fits to help you get better. I also recommend some NPSI public roams if you're just starting to get into pvp. These are much more forgiving than solo and can be a ton of fun while also showing you the game. Bjorn Bee (a popular streamer) runs these semi frequently but there are other options out there. This is what got me hooked on the pvp aspect of the game many moons ago. 
---
Your other activities can be accomplished wherever really. Go explore npc null or wormholes if you're in to that sort of thing. Wormholes are generally less picked over and less bubble camped but the lack of local means the risk is quite a bit higher. 
---
Good luck, o/ 
---
CCPls rebalance the dragoon or take it behind the shed and shoot it. Corax too, we need a stronger U-boat.
---
Also a tier of battleships that can fit anti capital capital weapons. 
---
&gt;Saw all the hate towards that guy. People shitting about his pings, fc skills and whatnot and kinda felt bad for him.
---
Man.
---
I’ve seen people fall for ones like they’re describing while trying to sell stuff in Jita, so it does sometimes. The problem is you have to actually sell some of them at a loss to get people interested, so depending on how much it works you could still go isk negative 
---
Thrasher FTW. Never had more fun doing pvp in fleet than in a Thrasher fleet.

I multibox with up to three accounts on medium graphics on a shitty laptop with a GTX 660M.

I come to reddit to get away from stupid user tickets not read more of them wtf
---
Imo, Dragoon works fine as tanky neut brick, and i think Corax got some more fitting room lately. Dragoon is legit one of the only tech 1 dessies my gank coercer will consistently struggle with. 
---
No need, just stay in jita and local these days will take care of rest.
---
Same here. I am playing on a i3 laptop with 4GB RAM and basically no video card - integrated Intel HD 5500.  
---
I can still multibox 3 clients easily.
---
I always keep a Minmatar on hand to read me the notifications. Helps to have a slave nearby to take it out on if I receive bad news. 
---
I did read. No u.
---
&gt; losing nothing but speed.
---
Speed is literally everything in an interceptor. It's how you tank drones, get positioning, survive tackling things, dodge ramming Jags.
---
The warp speed bonus from 8 to 10 is not a significant buff and can be accomplished for a combat ceptor by adding a hyperspat if really need be. Sure, double hyperspat fleet ceptor will be faster, but those rigs are often important for lock range, fitting, etc.
---
I'm not really sure if you've flown much of these ships to understand how huge a nerf a 10% speeed cut is.
---
Moreover agility is not really helpful except maybe to taxis. Fleet interceptors already have enough agility. The inertia buff is going to be wasted.
---
Also you seem intent on removing cargo. This doesn't impact their viability significantly as a travel ship. The only thing this impacts is their ability to cyno--which to me just feels like as a whole, you're aiming to change the fleet interceptor to be weaker against the styles of play you prefer without much insight as to how this impacts other applications you don't have experience with. Therefore I'm not convinced at all.

Elo is very annoying and I wish people realized it. He isnt the lord savior that people think he is, he is just a cringey idiot who constantly seeks sttention (re: look at all the reddit threads about him) on a daily basis. He isnt going to make any changes, he has no authority with anyone besides his own alliance. He isnt magically going to convince CCP to give him power. Ugh.
---
Seems the facts aren't exactly flattering though, heh.
---
Omist and Oasa used to be fun places. 
---
Damn Russians. 
---
There's no basis for that. There is not a class of ships that is analogous to battleships as battlecruisers are to cruisers, or destroyers are to frigates. So there is no basis, and it is nonsensical to suggest that there should exist a class of ships of subcapitals, or tier of battleships that fit capital guns.
---

He doesn't know himself. He's got feelings hes never felt before and hes confused.
---
&gt;nah has to be one per new eden now and you need titan umbrella to take the site. Leave it at +1 stats for 24 hours still too.
---
Youre still bubble immune in a fleet ceptor. There is no rig for that.
---
Reducing the ability to cyno was not the intended effect, but certainly a bonus. Nullified ships shouldnt be risk free travel taxi's or bubble immune cyno injectors either.
---
The proposed mal is 300m/s faster than a retri, and retri's catch and survive against things just fine. Keep in mind, most dont have ADCU's, theyre just going with double heatsinks, rep and nano.
---
If you dont need bubble immunity (lowsec for example), then the new crusader will be much faster than the current mal with the same point/scram bonuses, plus able to do damage if you so choose.
---
Bubble immunity is very strong that people feel entitled to and have never had to compromise on. That is why combat inties have felt "worthless" once they lost it. There is no trade off with fleet inties. They have almost the same speed, some have tank bonuses and are more agile than the combat counterparts.
---
Now each inty has a role. One for getting in front of targets to catch them (fleet) and one for intercepting on grid (combat).
---

Recruiting for a WH Corp is always going to be risky. If they are new, they are unlikely a threat, but they will get bored quick because they can't clear sites for money and have to be babysat in terms of rats for mining or huffing, and they lack the skills to make more than a single major mistake in hacking cans.  
---
 If they are an Alpha, they will likely quit EVE and be done. However, if you do manage to pickup a self-sufficient person who just needs to be shown the ropes, you will do okay, but also wonder if they are a spy if you suddenly start getting attacked.
---
yes the entirety of the legacy coalition managed evict us from an entire region in supercap range of their main staging, which we had taken from their allies a few weeks before, basically for lulz. an incredible story 
---
  \*\*they will still work with Goons/TAPI to feed panfams nuts dread balls from time to time\*\*

Corrected it for you lad :)

Nah, what I mean is that we're basically at proto-Serenity, where we have the north, the south, and skillu/FRT's east, and if you're not directly under one of them and inside their established space, good luck trying to do much of anything in sov null

I came back on a new computer, new client, I didn't change anything from default..

&gt; Then why doesn't everyone do it?

There's plenty of people out shooting people in space everyday. If you think there's not enough incentive to shoot people you are either doing it wrong, or in the wrong space, or both. Heck, if you fly for a group with that gives out ships for ops you legit make isk by losing your ship via pvp since you get the insurance for the ship you didn't pay for. There's already lots of ways to make isk via pvp. That was the point of my response to the OP, if you want to support yourself through isk via pvp there's ways to do it, if you know what you're doing. Or, you pvp just for the fun of it and make your isk elsewhere.

Basically you're saying learn how to deal with Eve being a pain, been there done that with a one, maybe two ships.

Low end of the performance range.  There's much worse cards in the 10x0 range than the 1050 ti which is in fact a decent budget gaming card.  My 750 ti manages 60fps constant on Battlefield 4 with medium/high settings.

Because if Elo can, anyone can!
---
Actual non-shitpost answer:
---
1) To help breathe life back into FW and lowsec, make the Widow great again, make sov more easily assailable (nerf fozziesov), and counter the Imperium influence, bringing balance to the Council.
---
2) I'd say 8-10 hrs/week. Varies a bit either way based on work, of course
---
3) Combination of lowsec, FW, wormholing, and several years of nullsec fuckery ranging from line-member to small alliance leadership (no desire to repeat that experience though, the burnout was real).
---
But what if I like shiptoasts...
---
I can updoot this for sure, playing on a hand me down 2012 toshiba laptop from my mom and it can play 3 on potato or one on max as well. I also have a 50% functioning toshiba laptop from like 2011 that I used to use as my primary but the screen broke and I dont have a desk right now.

because monitors can't be used with every fleet comp? If you are tied down to fewer comps then you are easier to counter. SkillU's strat is to spy headshot and to only field counters. It's a good strategy just makes the game really boring is all. Also not exactly gloat worthy video wise lol. It's why all the engagements after these couple fleets have been both sides reshipping for an hour or two and then neither engaging. I just wanna shoot something man.

Isn't that what you'd expect?  What's your ideal alternative and how would the devs accomplish that?

Can someone give me a serious response please? I can't be the only person experiencing this.

So to go over what this is NOT

1. This is not a setting I changed, this is default everything

2. This is not a matter of changing when the alarm sounds, but which alarm is sounding

3. Nobody who has played EVE for years ever forgets what the hull alarm sounds like

I can give you another fun fact about ISPs in Europe.

They cannot even guarantee you the bandwith they sold you. The basic thinking of non-digital greyhaired greedy managers was "Oh they won't use more than 10% of their bandwith for 90% of the day, so just sell 6 Mbps packages on a 100 MBps backbone to 100 customers". That leads to stuff like in rush hours your 6 MBps connection cannot play a 3 MBps stream ...

I’ve seen multiple feeds outside of this from legacy and xix losing a HAC fleet to lokis so I’m gonna go ahead and say that legacy is being paperpushed into not engaging 100 man subcap fleets because nightmares aren’t a “counter” to eagles and a muninn fleet isn’t a “counter” to 300 people that inexplicably decide to fly frigates - it’s jusy them being retarded

Lowsec, so he was hic pointed not bubbled and likely couldn't track becsuse he had capital guns not Haws fit. Targeted doomsday doesn't work on subcaps and an aoe doomsday won't work in lowsec, and even if it did it has a longer cool down timer. 
---
I went through the menus and see no option to even change which sounds play, ie. an option to swap shield and hull alerts. So I don't see how I could've possibly done this, or how I can fix this. Where are you getting this idea that I did this? Because if I somehow clicked something then I can fix it but I can't find anything like that. Once again I'm not referring to the threshold modifier but the sound that plays.
---
&gt; If he lied about local being broken the titan won't be reimbursed. CCP can easily check that. 
---
I think you're putting way too much faith in CCP.  It took them almost a year to even admit it's broken, I doubt they can tell when/where it is broken for sure.
---
I just fail to see why you’d use one of these combat ceptors over an assault frigate. A pure tackle jag is already extremely tanky (can fit 3x Medium Ancillary Shield Booster) and can hit above 4km/s heated. Making the combat ceptors fast enough to be useful despite their paper tank would probably make them overpowered. 
---
&gt; Besides the opportunity cost of damage or utility mods instead.

besides the thing that's a massive drawback, what's the drawback?

---
Retributions aren't a good comparison. They have the dps to shed tackle and kill a variety of threats, including drones. They are also tankier, and have better cap. You're cutting the speed to Retri levels and removing much of their defensive dps, and don't see the problem? I mean sure, if you gave the Crusader the same grid and dps projection as the Retri then the speed cut would be more than made up for. But as it stands, I can't see these proposed fleet interceptors being up to their current strength.
---
Combat inties were deeply cut by the bubble nullification for much the same reason. Some of them don't have the speed to keep up with any of the fleet inties and perform an anti-inty role, and the Dramiel is much faster and serves in that niche. They do have some remaining niches but the primary reason for using many of them over the Dramiel or Daredevil for anything was their nullification.
---
If you gave them a hunting or anti-support bonus like hot MWD speed or dscan immunity, then they would edge back into many niches because they have something unique to offer. As it is they're just faster frigates that are painful on fitting, and that doesn't stand up as a T2 hull.
---
Your entire reasoning is not something I find convincing. If your goal is to give each inty a role, why are you dismissing the reality that you would remove the fleet inty's? Are fleet intys in any way overpowered that they would deserve such a cut? In fact, why touch fleet intys at all if you want to bring combat intys to the fore? It's not that fleet inties eclipse combat inties because fleet inties are too good at their job--it's that combat inties are too weak.
---

How do you figure they make any where near 30bil based on the number of kills on dotlan figures? Are you counting escalation?

This has been addressed multiple times. I am aware of the threshold modifier. That only changes WHEN the alarm sounds, not WHICH alarm sounds. How many times do I have to say this?

BUT I KNOw yoU
---
The reason there are less bots in wormholes is not so much the lack of local as the lack of infinitely respawning sites with instant payouts.
---
WH bots can't run 24/7 and you don't get your isk payout until you haul out (not a bot-friendly activity).
---
That too. Ihubs and infinite anomalies are the worst decisions CCP has ever made. 
---
And we all know that's saying something. 
---
Our recent northern deployment against horde for example went amazing. we took the high sec markets, we dropped a ks, we made them turtle in one little region at the very top of the map, all of their offensive action stopped.. everything about the north was a win and we did it without supers.

Not really

Querious: Only fake querious, which is geographically Delve
---
Fountain: Only south Fountain, and it's sparse because it's not defended like delve is.
---
Why use delve as a target in your title then? Seems to me like it immediately alienates a significant group of people who might otherwise help you, simply because it seems you're targeting them specifically. I would love to see a CSM candidate who was dedicated to the eradication of bots, but I'm not going to support someone who thinks the meme or whatever is more important than actually starting meaningful conversation. I don't know if you've noticed, but there is a lot of unbiased observation from smart people even within the Imperium, as long as you don't hit them in the face with accusations, especially that are generally false, right off the bat.

Thanks!!

Lag stinks. I have used a VPN for years, but now I'm seeing increased efforts across the internet to stop VPN use, or stricter "geo-blocking"... 
---
Internet is a contraction of interconnected network - and if you sever those connections you don't have an interconnected network anymore, you have a LAN... 
---
Behaviorally speaking there is more VPN use in EVE and it's growing.  It's not illegal to use VPN's in EVE - but if you are going to do that, please use a 2nd Factor, as it's helpful to know that you aren't being targeted by a baddie who also uses the same VPN.

I did some analysis on connections on my own local machine, out of curiosity, and it's staggering how much of today's internet runs in AWS, for example. If Amazon has problems, you'll really notice it. Thankfully their up-time is quite alright...

When I started at CCP in 2006, we hadn't seen the cloud yet, and a lot more stuff was hosted in-house. Iceland also had a weaker internet backbone. I remember one day the country lost internet because some Scottish farmer cut a line. There was no backup, or it was not working. I grew up with the internet and so it was weird to not have it for a while. Also complicated answering your tickets. Nowadays I think Iceland has a great connection. 
---
Actually most people don't realize this is not necessarily illegal, nor wanted.
---
Your ISP has a limited connection. What's more, some part of internet may have even more limited connection to your ISP. If your data route goes by such a part, then even if your ISP is providing INTERNAL full bandwidth, the more people are trying to access this part of internet, the less they can access it. Then it becomes normal for your ISP to set priority-based access, like video or from some CDN that helped build the infrastructure more than google, amazon, facebook, etc. are.
---
And of course, then it becomes the good solution for you to use a VPN : it makes you not use the route that is overloaded, but another one.

That's kinda the point of the Noctis, to be the best at salvaging actively. It does it quite well and there's not really much a need for improvement upon it.
---
A drone salvaging ship like the Algos fitted for it doesn't salvage faster than the Noctis but is cheaper and does the job, so I don't see much need for iteration there either.

So probably not.

Nowhere did I say anything about there being P2W in EVE. I made a general statement about micro-transactions in games in general. 
---
They are absolutely a cancer that preys on the lesser parts of human personality.  Eve could have released the original skin tools that allowed us to color ships using a palette of colors(Which they accidentally did on SISI for a bit, but then "Corrected" it)
---
To clarify my point regarding EVE specifically. It's become clear to me at least that the development energy has been mainly steered towards mirroring monetizing and game play systems that exist in other games. For the express purpose to fulfill some checklist put upon the future and now current masters of EVE's fate. Pearl Abyss. Not furthering the overall EVE idea, which was to  give people all kinds of sand to play with. With just enough oversight to keep it a healthy melting pot for all kinds of play styles.

---
is this the thread for the Reddit brigade?
---
Insurance/killright scam.
---
Freighter pilot shoots main/alt in high-sec, gets concorded and lets the other person set an option for anybody else to buy the killright (i.e activate it in space). 
---
This means that when someone activates the killright, that fee gets paid to the same person who owns the freighter (or someone connected to them). In addition to this the freighter pilot insures the ship beforehand, which results in an overall gain when it explodes. I'd imagine it's in the region of 500m+ everytime one dies, assuming the killright fee is set to around 900m or so.
---
Genius-ish.
---
Through observation. they are using Macherials to smartbomb havens.  Most of the rats average out to 1 million isk (roughly) and they kill 30,000+ every 24 hours. so 30 billion isk.  I'm not factoring in loot, faction spawns, etc.... I'm sure it could be more, or it could be less. but either way, it's a shit load of isk. and he also doing in in a second system with around 20,000 NPCs killed every 24 hours. 
---
You're a sonovabitch, you know that?
---
My bet is that the GSM knows something that the rest of people doesnt know yet
---
Join goons. Your krab ass will fit right in with them. 
---
You can show info on the gates and holes to sometime get some info.. But no man just go ask google..
---
well, I dont think it will affect much. People who realized how cool new boosters are few, and they are pretty quick buying out those boosters. As we hit the summer Impetus-75 will cost like 350mill. So LP/ISK rates are safe. 
---
Think the "hypocrite" part has to do with the amount of alleged bots within the Imperium that went (and are going) unreported while Goon shitposters went on an anti-Mar5hy crusade. I haven't seen anyone say it was "legit" for him to use it. As a third party though, I agree that the "pushing the narrative" bit doesn't really make any sense. It wasn't really a narrative. Dude got caught red-handed.

---
this may shock you but when you're a member of an alliance you will often be referred to as a member of that alliance
---
The only way, that will prevent bots while not fucking up actual players are one thing: Build in captcha system somehow. You could make a captcha trigger, when your account does something that would usually require activity (not to punish vnis too much). Maybe make the captcha only for local chat... I mean, they know botters usually do. So they just look up which step needs actual activity (if someone is not botting). For example warping, they could implement a warp tracker, because noone warps without using a mouse, like noone! And this can be tracked via captcha.
---
Well I'm sure posting in all caps on an unofficial subreddit will fix the problem.
---
Lots fancy words and yet gibberish. It's a game and it could be fun. Go back to make good pvp videos and leave us to dream of what ifs

While we do hoard all the loot we get ^^ out actually Corp name is horde :p
---
NO, BUT IT'S GOOD FOR MY NERVES

This so much.
---
Capital guns need more space for fitting, energy/power and so forth. So how it could be balanced is that it would have minuscule cargo bay. Only space for few ammo etc. 
---
I see, thx

Hey man, have you cleaned out your fans and redone your thermal paste? It makes a world of difference and could increase your comps performance.

I didn’t say that. You did, your logic not mine

Well, unfortunately logoff traps are one of the only way to combat bots. If CCP wants 'proper warfare', maybe they should address that problem.

They also need to get rid of static sites. Force people to move around for PVE. Sitting in one system all day shouldn't be a thing.

only bright side of zealot is that its funky ship. and no one expects whats gonna happen. even zealot pilot myself.

A small price for providing a sustainable supply of frozen burgers for said poor individual.

I agree, the random assortment of Janitors and other junk in the hold confirms this. If they were a real freighter pilot going about their business they wouldn't be flying around with all that.

i thought corps NPC standings change in 7 days after adding or removing a char from a player corp?

great video that last kill on the moa was insane... just barely got away :D

Given how many they've lost and that it's in dodixie, this totally checks out.

Get your Energy Weapon rigging skills up, should fit with that to IV or V. Get MG snakes and you have at least a *tiny* bit of speed.

Most importantly: it’s better in a gang where you have buddies for control, a zealot can’t defend itself and will get shanked by a ramjag or even a “normal” wolf.

I've been on a lot of subcap mining fleets in Horde and the only time I've been dropped by caps is when we happened to be on a moon in Kalevala that was within jump range of some random alliance. Most of the time our moon mining is only harassed by small gangs of frigates/cruisers that are easily seen off by a few PVP ships in the fleet and Procs with scrams.

I used to run factory planets that were being fed by 9 characters.. 6 planets each. The factory planets are cool and all and will increase the value of what is used in the factory planets by nearly 40%. But it takes commitment to keep those factories churning out higher tier PI.

its worth it dude.

Wait, people in the WHAT? I am on an EVE break atm
---
No, it's like two blobs. One of my issues stems from the fact that projection keeps being made easier and easier now for these large groups, combined with the fact that there are fewer and fewer reasons for small groups to exist outside the fold. 
---
Another big problem with only having these monolithic groups (aside from the lack of chaos factor that having more smaller groups brings) is that the game simply can't handle them. The biggest battles come down to whoever has the bigger percentage of Titans that survived tidi disconnect waves and can get their doomsdays to fire. Supers offer little more on a strategic level than a deterrent against enemy supers, and a guarantee for 10% tidi lag on the field. Caps outside FAXes have accomplished essentially nothing since 2015. This, ultimately, is no fault of TEST, or Goons, or NCPL, or FRAT, but the direction CCP is taking the game.
---
As for ideal alternatives, I've had about a billion hot takes on what could work and I'm not really comfortable with any of them. I'm not sure it's possible to make EVE that much better overall, given how much of the playerbase's interests have shifted over the years. I just know that at some point between this time last year and now, I slowly found it less and less possible to play the game in a way that was interesting to me.

Thank you for your kind words.  I think that's why we went so different than what we've done before.

You're not wrong.  But Eve does thrive on cult of personality.  Personalities drive this game.  Some of the guys in my group do have some names.  While we might not be a huge group, though.  We will see what happens.  It's some real irony hearing complaining someone flagged with an alliance of 2 people, though.

in tier 3 and above abyssals at the end theres now 2 gates you can take one to k-space one to a new pvp arena with a extra cache, the arena is empty of pylons etc  so 2 dudes enter one dude leaves with all extra cache and whatever is left in the opponents wreck
---
also if there's not enough people running the sites the pvp gate just no shows 
---
I'm guessing the goons needed the space, told RMC to either sell the space or get wrecked, and now RMC is moving elsewhere, probably NPC null to try to take sov elsewhere.

For australian providers in particular this is a regular occurrence. They have bad peering routes in alot of cases. You can change your server's provider and have ping spike from 90-200MS because suddenly your traffic goes via outer mongolia.
---
Back when I played Tf2 for example, my favourite server changed proivider. My traffic then went from NZ &gt; Sydney &gt; Los Angeles &gt; California &gt; Australia
---
My ISP had bad peering routes, so after requesting it be raised with their actual network support team it got sorted and the ping went back to 90MS, with the traffic going straight to hte server.
---
These changes also can occur because of damage to the main cables connecting AU to the rest of the world, so they have to use alternate routes which are almost always badly optimised and not very well tested. As a result you get abysmal performance until the main routes are fixed.

Or in this case. You see an avatar blapping his own cynos on zkill on a route from a plug and play auto generate jump plan from dotlan, move a hic to his next mid and just warp to his cyno for a free titan kill. The spodbrain is real in this one.

Because the server tick will process the information, and then the overview will update. They can send the command to loot it while the overview you is still updating.

Fuck. Another example of how broken this game is. But I still love Eve, perhaps in the same way a domestic violence victim still loves and makes excuses for her violent partner.

What if the auto looting boots were designed by the haulers to stop ganking??? Top conspiracy

---
so yeah, goons
---
Well, as sad as it seems, some ppl who are either extremely incompetent and/or annoying get "promoted away to Brussels", so ppl are rid of them locally. Doesnt really improve EU-workings...
---
Yes but the command to loot it, still requires it to appear on the overview according to your explanation. I'm not doubting that the bits can do it faster than people, just your explanation that they're accessing information not available to people

He used broadcasting to control characters, and got caught doing it in local. Cheating is cheating, I don't care what type and neither do most of eve, they just like seeing people get banned for cheating.
---
I saw your shrink. He kinda sucks. Take your meds.

wasnt there a post like 3 weeks back about chast being shit and they were geting rid of it.... ^(tm)

It’s a meme bro - his titan got killed this morning.

people get reported all the time based on assumptions, put some actual proof in a post and get CCP's attention and maybe something will happen.
---
This

Kak in Dutch, close enough.
---
I personally didn't care until he got caught broadcast chatting in local, all him being in space did was make people have to actually pay attention to their shit while in space. Intel channels were the most helpful they have been in 6 months during his stay because everyone was more aware of the threat and there was a lot less AFK play going on so nuets and reds were called out almost instantly.
---
same happened to me. raised ticket and ccp gave me rewards
---
Another citadel shoot that doesn't need to happen. 😑

either it works now or we will roll back or something like that?

2019 and NC is posting about high-sec Azbel saves and 16 dead Nestors. Someone wake me when this circlejerk brigade is over.

Nah, e.g. I am just an ex-customer-service-guy, meaning one of the folks that get thrown at the front to best bash off all user-inquiries with some prefab, default copy-pasta-answer. No matter if that answer actually fits the users issue.

I come in system local is empty so i just warp my pod to the gate and bam im dead but local was empty?? CCP really need to fix this it just not fair
---
thats how campers works, pick off the weak but makes the rest of us stronger

Can someone with a TEST alt ask him what happened to his pod?

Latest update has some changes to minimize error messages and give you a bit more detail. You may need to re-register the application and start over.

Nice Leshaks btw.

Latest patch has prices from structures option. See patch notes for more info.

Dude, what's with this sudden echo chamber of 'DELETE LOCAL', i'm telling you from past games that have done it, it is NOT a good idea, have a long thought about the actual fallout of deleting local.

The same can be said of TAPI

Stop trying so hard XD Do you guys need a morale post THAT bad that were post 16b fleet fights?

I'm not even one of them.

agreed. even worse, actually. shouldn't have been posted
---
No FC is perfect we all have things to learn and places to improve.

I get that they lost the titan, so dock the pod up and bring it an insta warp ceptor or something, why try gating it somewhere?

well gratz. My post is up 12 mins and -13 downotes. Where is the Reddit brigade Discord? Can I come?

i mean... if its worth posting 1.7b bomber km br's then this is definetly worth it right?
---
The hate boner thing is just a narrative of the people who liked what he was doing. A large majority of goons didn't care he was there, the majority of people I played with went on with their daily play like normal we just all stayed aware of where he was, and kept fleets on standby to deal with what ever he dropped.
---
No, really. Do you guys save this crap in some folder somewhere? I mean ...  2 years ago? Is this game really worth that much effort? 
---
The real question is...will everyone quit in the 5 years it takes them to roll it back?
---
Is it brigading if *everyone* thinks you're a mongoloid?

I have [no idea](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/instant-pot-bbq-pulled-pork-103.jpg) what you are talking about.

Yeah, dunno why that was posted. Bombers Bar died again .. what's new lol

At least he's bothering to create content.

Remember how you had to buy clones so you don't lose SP after you die

Just so you know I had me a couple tasty toast sammiches in the mean time, your words can't hurt me now.

PanFam has me on speed dial bro. You new here?

Good fights all round. Had fun :)

I ran it on a little tablet. Some little dell thing, close to five years ago.

I was legit having fun in that with all the hisec bears going "wuuuuuut is going ooooooonnn" with 500 dudes in local.

GF

because he is bad?

I honestly thought you were taking the piss but no, it seems you were actually serious.  You have ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PLUS characters?  You need to be in a psych ward.

Have you ever considered that you are just insufferable?
---
Good point! Added
---
Anyone got a translator for this?
---
Im not a fan of this content tbh, thoughout all the times ive encoutered his fleets he has either blobbed us with loads of unnecessary batphones when he may face a challenge or just third parties. None of them are exceptional. He has made a reputation for himself by being an autist in local and questionable choices so I dont really have any sympathy for him.

Go find a bot near you!

The following filters show only NPC kills, which generally means that a living player wasn't at the helm. Don't report without evidence.

Here's a handy zkill filter for VNI bots:

Many thanks to u/squizz for letting me mash together url search criteria.

If you can keep getting sites Salvaging is one of the best things for a newbro to go for. It's just alot of the same clicking so people seem to only do it for awhile but you can pull in some good numbers with it.
---
Good luck hunting people with a 5k player count. Local might be a flawed mechanic but 15 years in really isn't the time to be tearing apart the fundamentals.
---
I'd love to get the citations on this. Sorry to put the onus on you here--I'm just so used to a very different set of pro-local arguments that I don't think I've actually seen this one before. Which games are you referring to, and what (presumably negative) fallout occurred?
---
/r/eve is more toxic and vindictive than a 3rd ex-wife.
---
&gt;put some **relevant observations** in a **botting/cheating report in game to** get CCP's attention

then, move on with your life and have fun with your friends playing with spaceships :)

Vedmaks are dominating abyssal PVP. What's a good counter? The Curse seems like the best choice, but are there other viable options?

I did not receive the reward either, but I am yet to submit a ticket about it.

Or fix it and give a delay based on security status or something.
---
I'm living every system like it's a wormhole try it sometime you'll be suprised
---
If you don’t mind me asking, what were the changes and how did they affect the game? From what I know I started after they took place and so I’ve never really know Eve without them.

one mans "relevant observations" (aka calling ice miners bots because doesn't know the excav mechanics) Is another mans waste of time.

I'm looking to join a 0.0 corp belonging to one of the big alliances soon and I have a few ships that I need to transport, nothing crazy but I just wondered what the procedure is?

Do you literally just contract over your stuff to a "designated" freighter pilot in the corp or what?
---
If they delete local what will we spam?
---
real players are still going to buy plex and put it up for sale and real players in game are still going to buy and use that plex. All banning bots does is remove the artificial price inflation of plex by decreasing the demand. Meaning people would need to buy and sell more plex to get the same amount of in game isk. If anything removing bots would make CCP MORE money not less.

Every group has their own methods, if you join a large alliance there will likely be websites or forums with this information.

Dragoon is fine these days. Corax is still hot garbage.

I'm not Test or Goons. I just downvoted you because I like to downvote poor sports.

I disagree. ISK value of PLEX is irrelevant in this. Total amount of bought PLEX from CCP using IRL money is what matters (to CCP). If a boatload of bots go bye bye, so does probably half of those sales. Maybe the deflation of value will make more people who does not bot buy PLEX, but I don't think the number will add up to the amount of bots.
---
CCP could do a lot of things to detect bots, but there's really no reason (for CCP) to do it, as it brings no benefits (to CCP).
