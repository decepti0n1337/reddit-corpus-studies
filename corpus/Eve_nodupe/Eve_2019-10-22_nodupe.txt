Some of my favorite moments in EE were our constant harassment campaigns between our two alliances.  Despite all of the shitposting, shit talking, and general wankery, you guys helped make the game a fuckton less boring than it normally is.  I learned a lot murdering and being murdered by you.  So long and thanks for all the fish. o7

They could make it like Star Trek Online had and continues to have with their Lifetime Subscription. The issue is if you de subscription the game then you have to increase the PLEX store sales to make up for it, Star Trek Online has lockboxes and the best ships hidden under several hundred dollars worth of lockbox gambling.

Homie, we're getting paid. Stop rorq mining for a dang second and come fight

Well, the only available answers to the question are "yes" and "no". And if you really want to know, the recruiter literally just said, "I don't know about this guy. His app seemed pretty 'eh' and there's some questionable transactions in his ESI... but he said 'yes' to being a spy so, fuck it. I don't want to deal with it anyway. I have other apps to work on."
---
I'm sure I sound like an ass saying it, but the reality is that we get a lot of applications and we don't want just anyone. If you couldn't tell by the many replies to this thread, Bovril has kind of a shaky history. We know we're better than we used to be, so we can go along with the jokes, or even go along with the facts and try to turn them into jokes. But also, we do what we can to keep up to our current standards. Including rejecting a lot of applications if we don't feel they're right for us. 
---
So, there you go. For whatever that's worth.

make a referral link for yourself or use a friend's  [https://www.eveonline.com/recruit](https://www.eveonline.com/recruit) , dont use steam as 30% of your money goes to valve instead of CCP who are supposed to use it to make the game better  
---
Also referal links dont work with steam so if you make more alt accounts youre gonna have to use 2 launcher systems

Horrible idea. No matter how much you increase the limit, there will always be nerds who exploit that and get game breaking advantage, if they are more experienced.

Join a newbro friendly corp: Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Eve University, Karmafleet. That's the easiest way to learn the game and have max fun.

Do not listen yo idiots who promise you riches, if you start in their crappy highsec mining corp. It is a waste of time.

I can kinda agree on that yes. Post-rebalance they seem to be quite adequate though

How about CCP add Clear skies rust bucket as an NPC that roams around and you can't shoot. Just like Tom's shuttle.

I did almost exactly the same thing haha :)

I also had my corp members warp to it to split the bounty.
---
And when you instantly kill the MTU, he doesn't get loot and warps off to Jita (i followed one) to get a new MTU.

So you can just pick up all the loot yourself (yes you will get suspect!).

NICE.

But it's not to compare meta vs T2 guns. For that you should use pyfa. While the fleet simulator is a fun thing it only works on rather conventional fights. There you can actually pretty much see the numbers in your head anyways. Still it's a very fun tool to play around with and it's very impressive as one person's side project.
---
Don't worry, CCP forgets about everything FW-related anyways. We're used to it.

I thought if you bought a sub in the first 2 weeks of a new character you get 1/2 off sub for 30 days. At least I got a notice on my new alt. Been more than a month ago.

Reset /r/eve confirmed at eve vegas
---
Use your old account from the Eve website to refer a friend, then start a new account through Steam.  Then buy the $4.99 Starter pack from the website first for each account, and then buy it again from Steam for each account.  You'll get an absurd amount of skill points and stuff for each account, and you can now dual box Omega accounts.  Figure out how you want to play and train each character accordingly.  If you're going to be playing for real reals, like you say, you're going to want a second account soon anyway.  Use the referral for the extra rewards.
---
He is pretty afk but his last act was to ban pictures of people in dino costumes so that bought him a lot of credit

What if op is that bot?

Obviously the core game change announced at Vegas will be Triglavians as playable race. This is the avatar that you can create. Triglavians will be the only race that won‘t have clones aka once you get podded you are permadeath. Probably with mad bonuses or available sp to distribute freely.
---
Yeah I figured you can get on sisi and simulate fits for it, but you can't check DPS numbers because the actual ammo item hasn't been added yet, but you can see the stats for it, which means you can calculate DPS and alpha manually (which I've done for some test fits)

For npcs, I presume you are hacking ina frigate? Don't go to ghost or sleeper data/relic sites.
---
Stick to pirate sites (Gurista's, Sansha's, etc)
---
For dealing with players, it's about d-scan, d-scan, d-scan. d-scan ALL THE TIME.
---
The other part of it is knowing the extent of the chain, and what those connections imply.
---
Highsec connections tend to be high traffic, so it can be common for explorer hunters to camp highsec connected wormholes for people like you to come in.
---
By comparison, a whole connected to deep Aridia lowsec 4 holes deep from a highsec connection is very unlikely to have a camper properly staged with perches/scanned down sites.
---
If you aren't at a celestial or anomaly, it will require they use combat probes to find you. To find this, D-SCAN!!! A good prober can get you with their probes with the probes only on your scan for 2 seconds, but many people are worse than that, or get decloaked and you can d-scan their ship.
---
Mostly, like lots of space, it's knowledge and predicting behavior that has the most benefit.
---
You learn how people behave based on the conditions of the space.
---
If it's easy for you to get to, hunters know that and will be watching. If it's hard for you to get to, it's hard for hunters to get to.
---
I've done some risky stuff, and still been very fine in wormholes, like bringing out the Tengus to run anoms in an active chain that just 10 minutes prior has unknown probes in system. But when all I'm seeing are the occasional Astero, they are VERY rarely going to actually be a hunter capable of taking me, and are more likely to just run away when they see I'm out and about.
---
But also, CLOAK.

Imma be completely honest here, I was told more than once that this sub was really preachy and left leaning, and I would just like to know your opinions on that. I know nothing about the game or the gameplay, but if it is or isn’t true I’m curious why anyone would think it was/wasn’t. 
---
I’m not making judgement either way, just really confused overall.

Look in your character sheet, you can find all your kills/loss and killmails you were involved with.

Yes! which triggers killmarks!!!

I've always been of the opinion that the only faction supercapital that even approaches its value in cost is the Vendetta, and only if your Vendetta pilots can aim their bursts. Even then its probably still a bit overpriced, but at least 83% webs is a huge increase in effectiveness over 55% webs considering it is an AoE effect.
---
By comparison, the only real improvement faction titans get is off-faction DDs and a bit more tank. Two titans of any type will be better than one faction titan always, but you can't say the same for the Vendetta which gets exclusive access to the higher yield web bursts.
---
Same. Loki is fav. Me like much.

Best tracking dread volleys for more than an arty nag, I can't see this being oppressive, oh and more DPS than a moros

But did you do the Dark Ochre first! Mining regulations state you WILL mine the Dark Ochre first or be disciplined. All indiscretions will be reported to the spod commission and you will be processed for commissar. Your Corp will face 100 percent taxes for a month.
---
Plenty of excellent suggestions here. 
---
\*\*\*Make sure you have a properly setup overview. Make sure all ships are visible in your overview along with probes (combat/cores). If you are hacking, you should hit your dscan every 5-8 seconds while hacking. 
---
\-Don't ever stop your ship when hacking, always orbit if you can and never go at "0" on your target.
---
\-BM safe spots to warp to 
---
\-Make sure you have visible objects (like the sun or customs) on your overview that you can warp to in a pinch. (Nothing like scrambling for an object to warp to safety when an enemy lands...)
---
\-Don't hack if you see activity in the hole, like probes or other ships. If you are not capable of defending yourself, better to move along to another EMPTY hole. The risk is not worth the reward!
---
\-Don't fly an exploration ship you can't replace because you probably will die at some point. Don't get discouraged :)
---
excuse me wtf

just like this comment

noraus is sending armed thugs to my home i cant fight them off forever oh god one of them has airpods in
---
depends on what faction of level 4's you are doing. in 'general' (not all the time but quite often) a standard battleship  (think dominix, geddon or raven and their navy counterparts) pirate faction (snake, mach, nestor) or a t3 (tengu/proteus) are best when it comes to hisec pve. use the corresponding best ammo to racial weakness (amarr enemies are weak to em/therm, gallente weak to therm/kin etc). you dont really need a marauder (although they are awesome at pve, just very expensive for subcapital ships)
---
I used to use a tengu for all level 4s because selective damage and easy to configure for racial damages. but really, its all about finding out what works best for you in terms of fun to isk to time ratio.
---
I'm not sure you understand the definition of edgy
---
Looking at Zkill, Avdot lost a large amount of activity after it joined snuff, down to 17 PvPers in last 7 days in Zkill and only a little over 300 kills this month which has 9 days left.  
---
Snuff killed avdot confirmed?
---
I think Heron is the best t1 explo frigates because of its slot layout. Exploration depends a lot on how much people are in the region, if you're in a crowded region then it's likely that all the sites have been cleaned out. After you get the hang of using the probe scanner for finding the sites and then hacking them in highsec, I recommend you go to wh space or nullsec because the loot there is much MUCH better. In a good wh you can net 100-200mil isk. I don't know what killed you but it sounds that you encountered a data site "ghost site" which are different from regular data sites. When you warp to it a timer starts (no one knows how much time you get and it varies) after the timer ends some strong NPC's warp in and start shooting everything there, you and the cans included. Oh and if you fail to hack the can the can explodes in your face and you die if you're not tanky enough.
---
What’s the gram account?
---
I don't know about anyone else, but every time I roam into test space I get hot dropped like nukes being dropped in 1944. Not everyone brings bomber ganky ships to fight. While I personally don't like the kitey bullshit meta, it exists because supers make the meta stand out so well. 
---
There's probably a reason why people only go to test space with stuka/goku comps, or at least based on your response that is the case maybe? You should probably think about it. I'm not sure why you are specifically referring to bombers. 
---
Bubbles are also a thing, I'm not sure why you think people have to comply with what you think is fun. I personally think people should bring more brawl ships, but you can't force people to use those comps.
---
You're preaching to the choir here, although I'm not sure I'll ever have big enough balls to warrant throwing AT ships around like some do.
---
You linked a normal type blops fleet
---
It's not null-sec corps that are killing the game, it's the CCP build structure, they need to kill farms and fields but with the current player base that's never gonna happen and they have alienated everyone else.
---
I'm not saying you can't pick up kills here and there because you totally can but really the amount of effort it takes makes it way beyond worth the reward especially when you remember when you could just sit in somebodies staging system and they would undock a reasonable comp, like that seems to work only on wormhole space these days.

People should bring whatever they like to a fight; I was just saying he's a bigger part of his perceived problem than I am.
---
I'm with you.  I sincerely hope Eve Vegas just gives us a vision for the future.  I don't want them to make major changes, unless it's a rollback/balance pass on something already added.  Something "new" is just as unlikely to bring back players as an Angel titan will.  Fix the core game, then add shit in - that's my hope for the announcement(s)
---
I dont make anywhere near a couple bill per hour. Please teach me your secret. If I could make a bill and hour I would pvp 23/7

You clearly underestimate the autism of players that dont bot.
---
&gt; And what's the point of building an empire if you face literally zero competitive fights as a result?
---
you don't build an empire to get "competitive fights" you do it to build an empire. some times, people just like building shit - that's why lego is popular.
---
&gt;Does it make you feel powerful in a video game to be able to say "Me and my thousands of friends are so strong!" How does that prove that your individual skill plays a part in that at all? Why couldn't I just replace line member 5934 with a trained monkey, in that case?
---
honestly dude, it sounds like you're trying to use eve to compensate for failings in other parts of your life.
---
if eve is the only thing you have where you can prove you have any kind of skill, that's pretty bad. eve is a game, i play it to have fun. if i want to prove how much of a skilled (or not) individual i was... well, i do multiple times a week - that's what my other hobbies are for.
---
seriously, is there really a problem with just enjoying the myriad of other shit eve has to offer that isn't the irrelevance of wasting your time throwing away pointless frigates so that you can pad some other guy's killboard?
---
Are you literally just being this obtuse dude? I'm saying what does WoW offer, in terms of "anything special" on the PvP front, that Eve doesn't? That's what I asked you to explain....and you talked around it, because you clearly don't have a coherent answer/comparison.
---
You said "but World PVP isn't the only pvp content in Wow", and my response to that would be "And Sandbox PVP isn't the only PVP content in Eve (Abyssal PVP), but it **IS** the primary form of it, as is the case with World PVP in WoW (at least during classic/vanilla era).
---
So again....you don't see this problem in other games. You don't see players ONLY PVP when they have a full god-tier character. They PVP the entire progression up to that point **BECAUSE THEY ENJOY THE PVP ITSELF*. Why are most Eve players, specifically krabs, so different, in that regard?
---
What I'm basically getting from you is, you don't find PVP fights, in general, to be "enjoyable" in Eve?
---
Next time don't go in a 4 man bomber fleet?
---
Man I second you on every word. Been trying to write down an personal vent of sorts about eve and it’s state, about the *viscous* cycle of love/hate relationship many of players have with EVE but its too big. Its been a part of our lives for like, half of the life?   
---
I’ve seen people die and people born when this game was already out and they played together, it changed so many lives that people are damn serious about eve. Some can actually put ‘ruled an intergalactic empire for a few months’ or ‘led a thousand people in a final battle and won against all ods’ and prove it in RL.    
---
EVE is more of a Legacy now, its not a just game, not in a sense gamers usually put it but in a goddamn serious way.    
---
We may hate it but we still love it and many of us would not be themselves without eve, without what it become, without what it added and what it changed in our lives.   
---
Does CCP and *muh korean overlords* (happy 1 year anniversary on the sale btw) understand what EVE actually is?   
---
Its not just a game that needs fixing, overhauling etc. there is more to it and the happening is bothering (maybe subconciously) quite a few people.
---

https://youtu.be/9xhUGGEnJcU
---
&gt; I'm saying what does WoW offer, in terms of "anything special" on the PvP front, that Eve doesn't?
---
well for starters, quantity of content.
---
&gt;They PVP the entire progression up to that point BECAUSE THEY ENJOY THE PVP ITSELF.
---
stop and fucking think for just a fucking moment. follow me on this one.
---
people pvp in other games with no issue, because they enjoy it. therefore, if people enjoy the content, they will do it without prompt. yes?
---
so if you're having to prompt people to do pvp in eve - that must tell you exaclty how they feel about the quality of the content you're insisting they must participate in.
---
Maybe CCP should start giving players an isk allowance for pvp.  Disposable income so I dont have to spend hours of krabbing to pvp for a couple of minutes.
---
I'm gonna need a bigger scooper.
---
CCP just kinda forgot about the Iron Fleet.

---
Really dude? Personal attacking me because you can't actually argue on the topic being discussed?
---
I have literally everything going in my favor IRL, thank you for asking, and Eve is just a game I login to, toy around with, enjoy the company of friends, and blow shit up in.
---
I'm not saying you have to "throw away pointless frigates" to make Eve better, I'm saying you don't need to have 4:1 odds, or a SC umbrella, or an FC to have fun in Eve PVP, which is the entire point that OP was making, in my opinion.
---
idk either, but i've watched it twice now...

---
I really like this post and agree with each point raised. I really think grinding for sp would be ok up to a limit and removing attributes just makes sense. The jump clone change definitely should happen too.
---
giving the same three responses to everything! Good job m8
---
&gt;I still think if more people were consistently out roaming, you'd run into defense fleets, you'd run into others roaming, etc.
---
I would agree if the map wasn't as big but you could easily have 2 fleets just pass each other unnoticed.  You mentioned blackout and I agree there but that *was* something roaming fleets were concentrated because they were all going to common ratting pockets.  I know it seems artificial but if there was some sort of incentive to going to some grid knowing that the incentive could bring other fleets to contest I think that would be interesting.  I kinda think stuff like FOBs were supposed to be that but their mechanics made that not be the case.
---
Also a possible spoiler of the expansion date...
---
Or they can respect that you have a hobby that you enjoy. Sounds silly right? But think about it. If your hobby was going out hunting in the woods and setting up in a in a deer stand at the crack of dawn they wouldn’t/couldn’t rely on you all day. Of course I’m not saying to disregard your family for a dumb video game but parents need a little “ me time” too. I think we forget that or consider it “ selfish” to not be on call 24/7. 
---
* again I’m not saying to play for 12 hours and abandon your family for internet spaceships. That’s going into video game addiction levels*
---
My wife has her hobbies that she loves to do and when she’s doing them I leave her the fuck alone. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.
---
People don’t like to PVP more than PVE. See WoW and GW2 or any other game out there. You lose those players it’s not economical to keep your game running anymore. 
---
But whatever, it’s not like people have made the same point 100xs already and the pvp crowd responds the same way every time.
---
People doing PVE tend to be risk averse, the most risk averse answer to save a rorqual are caps.  If you don't want a cap response don't shoot things that have an efficient cap response.  Go after domis and gates on the outskirts of an alliance's sov in small gang brawly stuff if you want a small gang brawl.  
---
I don't blame people for bringing the appropriate meta response fleet to a fight; you shouldn't either.
---
a very interesting find
---
We are proud of our alliance history
---
They don't hate null-sec, look at all the Dev time around null-sec, look at their communication to recruit new players.
---
What happens is we beat the sandbox by min/maxing it. And it gives a dev nightmare : how to balance things without ruining all the players' sandcastles and time spent to build it.
---
Hey nice! you made it! congrats!
---
Not only am I a krab. I am a krappy and krabby krab.
---
Well don't stop now!
---
If you're going the solo/self-learn route, remember that youtube,  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main\_Page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) , and reddit are your friends.   
---
Whenever you have time, in-game, take a moment to get very acquainted to the "ship tree" feature and read the ship traits, bonuses etc.
---
Your secret wet dream of being able to kill a titan Solo in a tiny frigate will never come true.
---
  Enjoy the beatdown.

Fappin !!

Tfw still no Logi

To fleet me like you do?

Vindicator: Engines? What's that?
---
Please don't use the word "promised" to describe any software development feature unless you have a contract that explicitly outlines that the feature will be available.
---
This isn't so much idiot-proofing as it is removing poorly-documented mechanics that were designed when the intent was to build out this lore-rich RP works.
---
If we keep it, we need to add warnings to the route that player is entering a hostile empire. You shouldn't have to check ownership of every system before jumping into it. And once you add the warnings, even fewer people with die to facpo. Which is effectively the same sort of "idiot-proofing".
---
As I said in another post, it's just not a good system as a part of the rest of Eve. It's this vestigial thing that has no impact on anyone except long-term highsec mission runners.
---
What makes it worse is how hard it is to figure out how to repair your standings. Which brings us back around to asking what the purpose of it is except to get a few new players killed unexpectedly from time to time.
---
Sounds like a 'rich' thing to say but AT ships kind of lost their touch for me? Like, it's just another grind. And for what?
---
At some point I kept soloing in 10b+ battleships, but the game doesn't really get better at that point, nor do your engagements
---
In the end, all that risk is kind of meaningless if the gameplay just isn't fun anymore
---
I should probably do the opposite and instead of flying more expensive, stick to T1 frigates and see what I can kill with that..
---
or at least interact between the two. I've got BILLIONS sitting in my character's asset list... Sure would be nice to send over some isk or a Mackinaw or two. xD
---
More ISK faucets than sinks in the economy = inflation.
---
More ISK = More inflation. 
---
This simple fix is what some African countries tried and ended up purchasing a single banana for a billion of their currency.
---
I would honestly be shocked if TQ isn't literally testing for EVE Echoes at this point expect to see more of these "features" added over time the randomness makes sense as there A/B testing against new accounts to get the best customer rates from them. 
---
I suspect soon it's gonna include a visual count down for how long you have to act on offer of "sale"
---
i dont know why i laughed so hard at this
---
I do appreciate that "Upwell" is a lore code-word for "we entirely rewrote all of this shit code"
---
Just want to add that bigger isn't always better. As some others have recommended, T3 cruisers are also a good option. Not only because of their damage output but because their ability to "speed tank" which means they could effectively mitigate damage by traveling faster than the NPC ship's weapon systems can track or apply damage.
---
SkillU called it months ago... everyone else, enjoy your stale blue donut
---
OK
---
Have they yet asked themselves if sucking the blue donuts dick was a good idea?
---
&gt; The best part is that you can't be ganked while krabbing so it's 100% risk free.
---
Clearly you dont work at a gas station in the sketchy part of town.
---
There is still content?  I thought the only people still playing was just titan ratting and losers who wish they could titan rat.
---
Most seem to be going into hibernation. Those who stay active - disperse, I guess?
---
Dunk and Brave being the prime example of this new meta.
---
Nice
---
faction titans are complete and utter garbage what are you on
---
Go to faction warfare and practice. Practice keeping a manual orbit around a poco or something. 
---
Also I did nothing but die my first few months of learning how to actually pvp so you'll be ok, especially if you're in j space
---
Oh no not the scary koreans mans god save us all
---
I love this
---
Maybe have this mechanic in place but some systems have higher regeneration rate. So holding key systems is still better and more beneficial but cannot be constantly exploited.
---
Or maybe a slider scale, more mining in a system means more pirate roams that are legitimately difficult. Less mining equals less kills for pirates, meaning smaller easier roaming gangs to handle for space that isn’t used.  
---
Aka: Make the pirates like actual pirates, “if you wanna mine here so much then we will make sure to bring bigger tougher ships to take your stuff” or on the other hand “eh nobody really mines here so just send a few scouts here and there.”
---
E: but I mean like actual legitimate tough pirate fleets that, if the alliance wants to keep mining a certain system so much, has to actually organize a fleet to kill the pirates in the system.
---
Im not sure what you are asking me.
---
Escaping bubbles, killing other explorers, mapping the chain and finding targets for mates, finding Geckos left in despawned combat sites, BMing and coming back Prospects for Vital deposit gas, then again to clear the rats, scaring bunches of PI haulers to dock up.
---
ugly,i don't like this.the Chinese player like bright colors.
---
You do get that the important part of the passive income from moons was the alliance level right, like giving players passive income isn't all that great especially passive income that doesn't do anything outside of being income. 
---
The moons gave both a contest point as well as being painful enough to control that monopolizing all the moons is very painful, but I would agree with you all the patches in the world don't matter until CCP reverse the carebear centric nullsec meta, move income making back out of null like in the glory days.
---
This is incredible. This is my favorite configuration of my favorite ship and you've painted it. It's the nastiest looking ship in the game. The thing looks and performs like an apex predator. You've really captured its mischief as the name implies. Amazing ship and amazing artwork.
---
Thanks man, glad you like it!
---
Try running DED 10s in a Revenant. I get your point but imo you just compared apples to oranges.
---
Fucking this!  CCPlease pay attention to this.  Well thought out.
---
why do you even still come here? You clearly hate either the game or yourself. It seems very unhealthy.
---
What’s the difference between “return to Drone bay” and “scoop to drone bay”?
---
Question for known elite space pvpers.
---
When calls out that your ceptor has tackled a krab. Do you:
---
A) Get easy kills
---
B) Let them reship into something that can fight back.
---
Option c keep mining.
---
&gt; though I don't see any other nationalities getting skins for their legacy localisations. 
---
Were skins even around when the last language was added?
---
A true newbie will quickly learn that mining can be dangerous, so mine aligned ready to warp out. Fantastic practice and teaching them to fly smart right out the gate.
---
Weird fit.
---
Probably because you watched this.
---
https://youtu.be/teE6Tu9bYTU
---
Indeed. Yet somehow CFC has perfected both.
---
that would be ccp's side to find a solution on. with recent announcements one would think npe has a high priority and i wanted to give my feedback on that.
---
What about this is making Eve easier? Leveling the field on SP generation by removing attributes? Removing useless static NPC content that has no storyline attached to it? I mean MAYBE you could argue that removing empire standing penalties from missions is making it easier, except that the problem is that the game fails to present you with any information regarding the impact of these drops in standing. In a game where spaceships cross light-years in an instant, there shouldn't be arcane knowledge of basic issues like that. It serves no purpose but to get careless or ignorant players killed and mildly inconvenience those who know how to deal with it. It's not a mechanic that adds any value or content to the game besides "lol that guy got blown up and I stole his stuff."
---
You shouldn't have to Google something to find out that jumping the wrong gate gets you blown up. That's absurd and we need to quit thinking that it's okay for a game to be so poorly documented that people die to mechanics with no warning.
---
Wormholes? Sounds like a lot of waiting around.
