20?? Back in my day it was 10. Inflation is high these days.
---
---
---
You could even make a case of special ships having the auto-aggresion to solve some issues.
---
In that case can I have ur stuff?
---
Not strictly true. The injectors' diminishing returns are based on the amount of SP you have, sure, but the amount of SP in reserve is not taken into account. So you can have 100Mn SP in reserve and 5Mn in your character and successive injectors will still give you 500k SP each.
---
its rwoj
---
Thanks man, thats really fascinating. Alsl thats a lot of money. Would still be interesting to see how it crasher market and everything. Also, can't you buy skill injector with PLEX directly, to avoid all that market crashing?
---
addblock plus...
---
Loot already drops when you kill some structures in k-space.
---
Username checks out
---
CCP out here playing everyone
---
&gt; The only option now is to krab in full PvP fit.
---

---
Why is that a bad thing?
---
When you have 100 dreads cloaked in a sanctum waiting....
---
God damn dude...you take life very literal don’t you.
---
This is what happens when you buy replacement parts from a 3rd party minmatar dealer
---
Right...means they would have to destroy them
---
&gt;Would still be interesting to see how it crasher market and everything.
---
Selling large amounts of anything on the market increases the supply, which shifts the equilibrium point of the market down. Fairly drastically, in this case.
---
&gt;Also, can't you buy skill injector with PLEX directly, to avoid all that market crashing?
---
No. You can buy skill *extractors* with PLEX, but not skill *injectors*. I suppose you could extract SP from a massive wall of skillfarm alts and inject a single character, at the cost of $4,258.75.
---
Either way, that's a lot of money to spend on pixels on a screen, but if you're a millionaire and you really want to financially support CCP I say go for it.
---
What to do and what to learn depend massively on what you’re interested in. Look at the the possibilities, then use eve uno wiki to figure out some of the details about how to get started. For anything that’s not clear, ask in the rookie help in game channel. Support is key so join a Corp early, but don’t just join the first group that pops up. There’s a lot of wanna be emperors out there. Happy to expand upon this further, but homefully this is a start.
---
which is different from cynoing in 100 dreads how?
---
This proves that CCP thinks bots (especially bots using auto-target systems) can't use guns.....
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm betting you eventually see bots with guns to make up for the loss of drone dps.
---
damn...how do you have the mental ability to quad-box with everyone doing different things?
---
You had logi, dictor, scanny tengu, bifrost...
---
The better Kathy
---
Yeah but it kinda limits the character's progression. As mentioned it's fine if they were at some point in omega status, but an alpha character who never went into omega is kinda punished in this scenario.
---
Goons are on the same side now too :)
---
Imo it's really despreciable (I don't know what is the correct translation, but it means that: you can avoid taking into consideration) how much extra HP the drones have, at least I can now see where my production lines can be focused.
---
your wife tries to act interested?  Impressive.

Yes. This one isn't a douche.

I saw a post recently that argued for removing auto-target from most drones and creating new auto-target variants with a damage nerf. It was a good idea.

---
It's superbly easy for one of those dreads to be a spy and blow your trap. Any group large enough to field 100 dreads has plenty of spies from enemy blocs that can ruin such a preparation.

No you werent?

In a P2Play model that means being clear and honest. Don't suggest true F2P when what you actually get is a handicapped trial-in-disguise.
---
The populists at least. Politicans that take their job serious know that you can't allways simplify things.
---
Life and politics are sometimes more complex than a simple "yes" or "no" and often both sides have good arguments.
---
I hope you don't live in Iran.
---
It's about perception. CCP atm is suggesting new players are getting a proper F2P game with Eve Onlne, while in reality and by any modern game standards,  Alpha is nothing more than a dressed-up trial/demo.
---
Forgive my newness on this one. Aren't MWDs supposed to make you easier to lock and hit to a degree? I would expect a capital to lock me if I blew up my signature with a MWD. From there the smaller than me fighters should be able to hit me.

I just don't attack the things at my stage of the game. I have roamed your space a bit and got vaperized. I just don't "REE" about it because unlike most people here I don't think I deserve kills.
---
Delivery goes both ways!! W TTs will be rattled a little... No Local... Gank bombing bombers is a very nice pastime...
---
I'm a fledgling ratter. The one solution no one had brought up yet is to limit the amount of rats to pop in any given system in null. If the resources become more scarce, people will have to go farther to find them. Right now I can rat to my heart's content in one system. If I had to go 27 systems away to find more rats to kill, that isk resource locally would be more valuable to me, but it would also be more valuable to others who want that same resource. Fighting over a scarce resource would encourage more fights. This guy's analysis of the problem was correct, but his solution did not match his analysis. If we want more fights in Eve, we need more motivation to fight. I think that if there was some way to limit the amount of anoms to run it would have the desired effect. Right now a high and creates more anoms to run at higher levels. What if a higher adm meant less anoms to run? (My idea is probably bad, since I'm new to null, but I won't know if it's bad until you guys with more experience tell me so.)
---
Honestly I'm not sure what you're complaining about here. 
---
The article IMO is largely correct. No, the blackout will not solve a lot of EVE's core problems, but it's a step in the right direction. I don't think the author is even arguing against the blackout itself, just the perception that it is the one-stop-fix-everything solution. 
---
There are plenty of more problems, that need to be solved with different solutions, and these solutions can certainly include the continuation of the blackout.
---
Awesome video. Great to see these kind of big fights going down in WH space. Praise Bob!
---
Almost as if they were just staying to try to steal the KM.... :thinking:
---
Did that in horde all the time
---
Man, this sooo reminds me of Dominion.
---
So, back before Dominion we had that awful POS based sov that no one liked and everyone blamed for 'stagnation' in null sec (hmmm, sounds familiar). Well, in introducing Dominion (which also coincided with the addition of re-spawning anomalies in null, aimed at increasing sov nulls ability to support more players per system which it did), CCP made claims in various places that the system would introduce more "small gang objectives" and that the system overall would mean that players didn't have to group up so much in mega coalitions like the old Northern Coalition.
---
Well, we all know how that went lol. Not only did it do none of what CCP claimed it would, it made the situation WORSE as people learned that these sov structures die faster the more people you have shooting them and that the bigger your group, the easier it was to defend the sov capture things you had to drop at gate (remember those, they were horrible).  Hell, Dominion help RENTING become even more viable, giving more power to the big blocks.
---
That little history lesson wasn't the funny part. The funny part was ALL OF THE PEOPLE CHEERING DOMINION ON. Because they hated 'the big blocs' so much, they'd buy anything anyone said would hurt the big blocs. so when CCP claimed that the Dominion system would do just that, they rejoiced.
---
When goons and others told them "naw, this will let us screw you over more because there are so many of us and we have the resources to withstand whatever", those cheering folks laughed it off as Goons just lying out of fear.  "It's going to be great, TAKE THAT GOONS AND BIG BLOCS"
---
So the funny part is the cheering folks were, in actuality, cheering for their own screwing over. Their prejudice against the players they didn't like blinded them so much that they couldn't properly analyse the system to see how flawed it was.  When (month later) the affect of Dominion sov became so apparent it was impossible to lie about how great it was anymore, those cheers and cries of "take that goons" turned into ashes in the mouths of the cheer squad.
---
I don't have a crystal ball, but there is a good chance IMO that history is repeating itself.  We'll know in a few months I guess.
---

What's your point? The reasoning behind these changes is pretty clear, to nerf afk alpha vni pilots.

It's unlikely that people will convert their 5 vni alts to omega in order to use ishtars. If you are only using a 1 or a few omega accounts then it shouldn't be a big deal.

I'm not sure who you want to hurt with this. Capital pilots can easily keep a fast warping cyno ship in system on an alt. Defeats your inhib, defeats your lack of cyno, and there is nothing you can do about it. If he's not shit fitbhe will live. If he is he will die. Just like it is now. Stop trying to make things more complex or second accounts nessisary.

Well that sabre was just burning with spheres of auto repeat, dps is just anchor and f1 until they call a target swap, and once the cap chain is set up you can just watch for a shield broadcast on any account and just swap to your logi.

Nooo! Why? Botters are the best for those alliances!! They contribute so much in Corp taxes!!! Why will they be booted?  Imagine if you could bot rorquals?

A nice pastime: get to Null in an interceptor, cloak, Scan down the Rorqs... make the information public... the AFK dudes will never notice or care!! They pay protection tax! But you and your buddies will score big in ZKB... and if you record it and put it YTube!! Content!! Real content... maybe the TTs from Wingspan will make you a honorary member!

The bigger your SP, the less amount of SP you get per injector

Its like 500k, 350k, 200k, 150k
---
Something like that i think
---
Thats not true, already tried that.
---
Huh. I heard that was a case a little while ago, it might have been changed. I don't use injectors myself, so my info might be outdated.

---
MCAV coming in with the big platinum SWORD fleet easily ready to snatch grid control from shitty F1 PUSHERS but get forced off by the BLOB . SAD AND LOW ENERGY.
---
So how would you prevent, as knockons:
---
Sov null players pulling in feelers to near invulnerable keepstars
---
The only groups able to survive over some arbitrary limit being the people who can SPAM those keepstars
---
The return to coffin alts and the decline of willingness for players to acquire supers (this is a non-problem as far as I care but it's still a change so I'm trying to be neutral here...)
---
Stupid crap involving clouds of structures for super staging instead because the costs are near trivial for the null blocs
---
IMO?
---
Put a payout on asset safetied items to the destroying alliance or corporation, drawn from the wallet of the owning alliance. Nobody likes losing assets but this makes it costlier while also giving an incentive to targetting active structures
---
Make asset safety a very expensive IHUB module in null? Bring back the constellation capital system and only allow it in the capital?
---
Asset safety and the peace of mind it brings is a massive carrot for players of all stripes, but that same safety keeps a lot of people willing to have expensive things on hand to risk. I wouldn't keep 15b in small gang ships immediately ready in our staging without having that safety, I'd stage them somewhere safe and trickle them in as I wanted them. Knowing that our staging ihub was threatened in the first hypothetical situation would bring in another layer of dread for me and get me engaged in ways I wouldn't otherwise, because either I couldn't lose meaningful amounts of my cache or I wouldn't have it anyway. Make it another asset for players with some provision for players on holidays
---
Because August 27th there is no competing with Wow Classic... but august 28th is fine :P

You just have to remember that it has a reload time in which you will receive 0 repairs from it, while a normal shield booster doesn't run out (when you got enough cap)

And then the guy just starts trying to warp to each person in fleet when he sees half ticks.

Lol. So you were just guessing, but I who knew I was correct and provided evidence 60 seconds too slow should get a downvote? Ya fuck.
---
that's like everyone everywhere man. We feel the candidate is a good person just because he talks like us (like that southpark episode). It's naivete at best.
---
That’s true, but the regular shield boosters are definitely not sustainable for me yet. I just bought my first cruiser 5 minutes ago.
---
Well said.
---
This exact type of change in regards to the VNI has been talked about and suggested since LONG before the new CSM came in and CCP did nothing with the suggestion.
---
Well damn, that's definitely misleading to new players.
---
I didn't downvote your original reply, my dude. I downvoted your subsequent replies because you're a rude cunt, sure.
---
:)
---
Just make sure you can afford to lose what you undock :)
---
Eye for an eye then! My eye for being correct but not being polite, and yours for being incorrect and, uh, upset that someone didn't give you a consolation prize? I guess?
---
Every time we remirror sisi's it gets reconfirmed. Unallocated SP pool is counted towards total SP
---
So nothing can ever be nerfed, things can only be made stronger. This seems healthy for the game...
---
You realise that there is a long history of CCP taking action against styles of play that were unhealthy for the overall state of the game? I'm guessing you weren't around when Tracking Titans were a thing that subsequently got titans nerfed pretty hard (iirc titans basically became only used for bridging 99% of the time)? That was back before skill injectors and keepstars when it required a dedicated character per ship that had been trained for years in order to properly fly it, and yet CCP made that change and the community was largely fine with it.
---
Nowadays with injectors and keepstars, if you're unhappy with shit then rip out the SP in that area and stick it somehwere else or sell it. Keeping a stale system because people worked hard to make it as stale as it has become is a shit argument.
---
You're really salty over imaginary internet points, my dude.
---
The fleet boss can tell.
---
Alright, my info was inaccurate. Again, I don't use injectors myself so I'm getting my info secondhand.
---
That was also before skill injectors were a billion isk each?
---
Hnnnngh if it blows up so will my heart.
---
But I have the venture to grind with so I guess that’s fine (: everything’s fine.

Shower thought : would it not have been nice if they started black out on the first of a month, so we can compare apples to oranges on a MER.  this next July MER is going to be half and half, and we have to wait an extra weeks aggregate to get solid results.  Nevermind that everyone will be able to push their own narrative off the July one, no matter what it says.  
---
That's too long for a shower thought.  Useless observation?
---
If you were to inject all the injectors in a single click since you can inject multiple at a time, you probably would get the full 500k SP benefit if you injected all 3,000 at once, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it broke the client code and crashed. Not sure if it would even let you inject that many.
---
Thanks, at least your comment is decent. I think most of the support is coming from a very loud vocal minority, the numbers haven't shot dramatically up either. Infact if you look at Eve Offline the numbers shot up shortly after the change release, but have been on a steady decline ever since.
---
Thanks for the Recommendation of Albion, and League of Legends, I'll check them out. Thanks for not being a dick like the majority of this sub.
---
I would say VNI rebalance or redesign.
---
Agency events have subgoals that often once achieved have 12hr-24hr cooldowns before you can do them again, so no, it will be capped at a max per day.
---
&gt;CCP have stated that when people buy PLEX it is not "Counted" towards their bottom line (or statistics for profit) until it is USED and no longer in the game. So people who stop plexing their accounts actually hurt CCPs budget more than those who stop direct subs.
---
I think what they meant is probably from an accounting standpoint. They probably record plex as unearned revenue, it's recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. The revenue was already made just an accounting thing. It doesn't really hurt he company. Direct subs are almost always the best thing
---
Did you check contracts as well.  Some of the clothing can only be gotten from contracts.
---
also add in more differentiation between regions of space, possibly shuffling the stats over time somehow too? best thing to do in the current meta is to turtle up in a region where you can just shit out caps/supers from a central point and then spam structures everywhere so it's too awful to attempt attacking properly. If staying stationary long term had negatives associated with it might encourage movement of groups and keep things interesting as groups have a reason to try and invade each other beyond "fuck those guys"
---
" a bot cannot. " With every thing we have seen bots be used for, how can simply locking back a ship that agresses the bot and scramming be too hard to program?
---
That's a good picture. +1 upgoat
---
OMG, I TOTALLY FORGOT CONTRACTS!!! LOL
---
I'd rather play EVE than WoW Classic to be honest.  EVE has continual improvement.  WoW is a grind to level 60 then smash your 40-man raid against the same boring bosses again and again.  At least the nullsec wars have players that change tactics all the time.

Sometimes when I am mining an asteroid belt I will come up on one with 4 other Ventures mining one asteroid. They are called Joint Harvesting Venture. They all have 3 slots on the Venture filled with miners and the top of the ship for a total of 4 miners on each ship. Didnt know that was possible.  
---
Are they bots? What are they? some type of player controlled mining operation?
---
Did you use OBS to capture multiple eve clients? If so, would you mind letting me know how you set that up?
---
Adapt or Die or Out....I'm Out.
---
It's a Navitas/Thalia.
---
what about the newbies who join null get sick of it and leave? I'm not even sure what your point is.
---
But do you remember the orange dot?
---
well, the incident I come from is 4 'canes, an enyo and a confessor getting dropped on thinking we'd fight a gnosis, a drake, and a coercer camping a bubble after the only eventful bit to our roam was a citadel PDS trap.  what's more annoying about it is what didn't die to the super drop died because the subcaps that probably could've whipped our asses at 100% camped a jump back and cleaned up. one group only got to kill me because i scrambled to the wrong system. 
---
I'd bet my life that we would've all logged off happy had we just fought our kitchen sink fleets, even if we got wiped anyway. It beats getting disrespected like we did.
---
please look away from the non navy 3200's
---
Put in a population growth formula maybe?  Adjacent systems affect local population as well, make it like hunting.

Agreed, try being more of a daredevil
---
Should have said "gay and pwnd."
---
Lol more alts and multiboxing. One for bursts, one for barge, one for auto agro rat killing. I think special ship is a bit of overkill. But still some part of me thinks that rats in mining belts should be a bit stronger.
---
I've been doing this to Horde ratters for years. Alt gets burned and kicked, roll another account. Rinse, repeat.
---
no cyno and you pick the range
---
it's an alpha account, it's not costing you anything to maintain.
---
as long as your myrm lasts ~4 ticks, so 80 mins. it's literally already replaced.
---
The trick is to do this with players that can barely find the undock button and have zero recruiting standards- like Horde.
---
100 dreads is like 5 people...
---
Treat ships as ammo
---
You time in space like it’s your last time in a game so fly to have fun!
---
Don’t be shy to talk in local, yes there are many wolfs in sheep’s clothing but also many diamonds in the ruff!
---
you don't pick  the range if you're already there cloaked, you end up at whatever range they end up at. a cloaked dread isn't dictating the range of anything.
---
I thought it topped 4 last month

EVE definitely has some great music. I listen to this for hours.

&gt; The one solution no one had brought up yet is to limit the amount of rats to pop in any given system in null.

uh... hasn't Olmeca Gold been saying this for a long time?
---
What are you interested in doing in eve? And why is it not PvP? 
---
PvP is eve. There is tons of different kinds of pvp and not all of it is ship vs. ship. 
---
But my biggest thing I’ll say is don’t play this game alone. Find a Corp that fits what you want to do and has active players. Have a mic, be on discord pumping out memes, and so on. Eve isn’t just about what you do in game. It’s the community and the interactions you have with other players. Be them good and friendly or you trying to take and kill their shit.
---
There is no game like eve out there. That’s why I still play it.
---
Still not saturating the market.
---
That seems like the casual players apporach to playing the game. Not going in as a casual. Can't "afford" to play as a casual. Goal is to learn vital information as quicly as I can and apply that for early grinding for resources and isk, as well as light pvp skrimishes to understand combat mechanics. All in order to build my skill up at a faster rate in an attempt to join an average powered or powerful clan, guild, corporation and partake in full scale war against others.
---
I was not aware of this, and I stand corrected. My apologies.
---
Not really. Warp to 100km, alt tab for 20 minutes, warp to another fleet member. I mean, it didn't pay for my titan, but it's the most effort I will ever put into PVE in this game, and more importantly it's literally stealing money from the pockets of our enemies.

And here's a list of everything in eve
---
https://english.eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg
---
Only if you go into manufacturing.
---
Nope that’s the only way to play eve, if you try it any other way you will become ether a carebear or a risk adverse pilot.
---
Plus eve is always changing, learning what happened in the past will help you when it comes to certain scenarios you will run into but in general means jack shit about current meta etc.
---
Fly to die or you will become another statistic in the non retaining pool of eve!
---
[quote]But my biggest thing I’ll say is don’t play this game alone. Find a Corp that fits what you want to do and has active players. [/quote]
---
No idea if quotes work on reddit.
---
This is my primary goal. Main plan is to try and quickly grind up the captain skills, ships, resources, and isk. While at the same time rapidly improving my overall understanding of the game with gamepllay and further research, and overall skill. Then attempt to find a highly militarized and very serious corporation.
---
Thank you, these will help get me started.
---
We generally enjoy newbros (as new pilots are often called.) Bringing new blood to the game and seeing the newfound awe of a new player reminds us of when we weren't bitter vets. While there is a steep learning curve, and you will get killed, they aren't out to get you personally... One thing we recommend a lot is to run those start story missions and get some cash, then buy some frigs to welp and just go out and learn to fly. 
---
I'd also recommend finding a corp to join, as people are what make Eve. There isn't a bunch of storyline, or questing, or raids, its mostly about your interactions with other pilots. Find a corp that does the things you are looking to get out of Eve. 
---
Shameless plug, Dreddit is Recruiting! We also happen to offer a mentor program to help pair a newer pilot with an experienced one to help show them the ropes and be around to answer questions for them. 
---
We live out in Null Sec, as a member of TEST Alliance, which is outside of CONCORD protection. We have regular fleets of all sizes, from a handful of nerds going out for a roam or camping a gate (to protect our space), or larger fleet battles over larger objectives in an over arching campaign.
---
NPC's. Their fitting requirements are #devhacked
---
&gt; Protecting or plundering a scarce resource would encourage more fights 
---
You vastly underestimate the size of the super umbrella of the big alliances.  For example, the existing Theta squad in Goons could cover 3 regions via 3 standing fleets and still get the same "crush anyone" coverage.
---
Also, your system requires them to take those 3 regions, which means less fights because there's fewer groups in null after Goons steamroll someone.
---
What's the only way to play Eve?
---
That's why I need subjects to learn. Weither it is past, current, or future changes. Lore, economics, political, mechanics, ships. Doesn't matter. Starting at a begining level where it is vital to know first and then progressing on. 
---
And knowing information both of the past, current, and future gives me an idea of how the game changes throughout time. Thus adding a layer of predictablity of what can change.
---
You use a &gt; at the start of the line to do quotes on reddit.
---
so they are just there for show?
---
TAPI*
---
Oh yeah, I bet you still have a year left of omega 🤔
---
Ah, thank you. I'll make that change now.
---
Mostly.
---
Unless you shoot one...
---
Test and brave are hard to recommend after legacy donut if you like pvp
---

---
Ah I was wondering why all of my rokhs sold at once today...now it makes sense.  Gl Volta.
---
I have an account with a 100M SP toon, a bunch of RL books and a resin ship model.  How do I find someone who likes the game enough to offload it all on to?
---
silver just for you then
---
So for a 6 hour in noon what did they take from alphas? I'm just getting going and dont have funds to earn or but omega for a decent while so I was hoping some one could eili5 it for me.
---
&gt; simple: make cap weapons suck dick at ratting 
---
Then the ratters quit, and you have no targets.
---
It's amazing to me the number of people here who are unable to understand that when the game changes, other players change what they do.
---
&gt; also people already gravitated towards super ratting anyway, there was never a point in recent history where going towards a supe wasn't optimal 
---
Actually, this is something r/Eve has gotten very, very wrong.
---
Super ratting requires being at the keyboard.  It's way simpler to AFK rat with a herd of VNIs instead.  Sure, your ticks are smaller, but you do it for much, much longer and so make more money.  So that was actually the popular way to rat even when you had a super.
---
With blackout, CCP ends AFK ratting being worthwhile.  Which means that advantage is gone, and might as well actually rat in the super.
---
So congrats guys!   You're driving people towards more caps.
---
Imagine spewing this much salt over a pretty well written article.
---
This... this is phenomenal. I am going to do this.
---
&gt;. At least the nullsec wars have players that change tactics all the time.
---
ok then

just orbit the site by the time they land on you you'll be 10km away.

Playing EVE isn't the problem, telling her he's in a group called waffles is the problem
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=144&amp;b=8701680&amp;e=90&amp;t=fq
---
You mean this?
---
Have you actually been pvping in null during the blackout? Please tell me examples of how you think it is working? The article is correct, the only thing that the blackout does it force the lazy null targets to adapt and get smarter making them harder to kill then pre-blackout. Groups are consolidating under a super umbrella, perma-bubble gate camping, and actively paying attention. Bots are rewriting their programs and some real players are unsubing alts that they didn't need in the first place because they psychologically don't like no local, at least at first. 
---
The result? Less targets, more empty systems to roam through, more gate camps to deal with, and tougher targets turtling up under a super umbrella. People are copying the Delve model which has shown will only result in more PVE activity in the long run. Only the most elite groups of pvpers will have success under blackout conditions with little opportunity for improved solo pvp. 
---
The killboards don't lie. Much less PVE ships are dying. More PVP roaming ships are dying. The first few days there was lots of activity and now it has already started to die off. The gate camps are successfully deterring visitors who are tired of roaming through countless empty systems. As the article discussed, the only way things will change is if CCP finds a way to make people willing to risk the big toys. Personally, I hope it is improvements in tech that will allow the big fights with the big toys to go more smoothly.
---
It's an NPC mining operation.  It is intended to give players some additional things to shoot at - you can wait and pop their hauler and steal their ore.
---
If you do attack them a defense fleet will warp in and try to kill you.
---
People come up with this idea of reducing anom spawns... then don't think what would happen if suddenly the amount of space Imperium lives in didnt meet their needs anymore....  
---
Lol.
---
the tragedy of wormhole space is that it probably would be more bearable if everything was the same except that the wormholes themselves didn't need to be scanned down and just pop up. Nothing would be really safer, just easier to navigate.
---
In that page's nomenclature, an "aligned" bookmark is a safe spot that is directly between two warpable objects.  (Start at planet 1, warp to planet 2, create bookmark while in mid-warp).  He calls it "aligned" because it's on a line between those two objects.
---
What...the fuck
---
Ok I will fill you in,
---
Past = Reeeeeee Goons
---
Current = Reeeeee Goons
---
Future = Reeeeee Goons
---
Ok you have now caught up on the political matter, economics and lore.
---
Ships you can only learn if you get in them and fly them, anyone can be F1 monkey being told what too do. Best pilots aren’t afraid to fly and die. Try new things etc.
---
Predictably just went out the window sunshine, CCP just got bought over and the new landlords want money. Nothing better than building up a sandbox making people pay to win. Then giving the box a good thump so they have to rebuild and too spend more money to adapt again if they want to adapt fast enough to the changes.Genius really but that’s a different story.
---
So can you post YOUR fit?
---
It is good to know that the rumors about the community are not all what they claim to be. As well as I appreciate your offer, however it will still be some time before I can play as I need to get a new power supply for me PC. As well as I take games very seriously, which results in many players not liking me because of it. Think of someone of the mentality of being the perfect soldier, and the military is the only thing they care for.
---
Where's that starter? And is it only when you start a new char?
---
why do you curse me with this
---
An office just lets you have corp hangars at that station.
---
Who says it's stale?  Just because you want easier big-isk killmails, doesn't make it stale.  It's still, "make my way easier by making someone else's harder".  Millenials and their participation trophies...
---
Brother that's just not for some people and not necessary

I looks like this is where you go to kiss a dev's ass.

---
Advice for the Philosophy of Ship Fitting:
---
1. Enhance your strengths. 
---
2. Don't cover your weaknesses (except for resistances in tank). 
---
3. Avoid getting into situations where your weaknesses will matter.  
---
4. Put one amusing item in your cargo hold to entertain people looking at your Lossmail.

---
Why don't the Goons go for the win of total conquest? They have been banking for so long I think they could do it. What is the thinking for why they don't? Is the goal just to bank and bank? Are they playing Stardew Valley
---
The lore is more or less for my own personal intereest, not really for the necessity of skill and competition. From my understanding of the economic and political situations of the game, they aren't that simple. Seeing how it is completely driven by player influence. Expect for this NPC invasion I've heard about. Reguardless of that, with understanding of how player/human psycology and understanding of economics will give me a big boost in the early game. Although yes the game my not simulate the political and economic scale of real life, the general idea of it does seem to exsist to a degree.
---
Also I do know that there are more ways of learning ships then just flying them. I can see that ships have extensive stats and using those stats will give me knowladge about their strenghts and weaknesses. Their weapons systems, damage, resistance, mobility, and ect... And using those stats to compare with other ships. Although I'm not sure if this game has moduels or upgrades for ships, those too will change their stats still giving me an idea of their combat potential. As well as watching expericance and skilled players use specific ships, and watching many different players use them. Will help me see what form of tactics can be used in many different forms. And give me a broad idea of how far the ship can be pushed and what situations to avoid.
---
Predictability was probably the wrong work. More like possible expectations.
---
I see. So essentially outfit a ship to have a high amount of fire power to do as much damage as possible in a short amount of time. While maintaining a postion where you take little to no damage. Basically becoming a glass cannon or a DPS fighter, while another ship that can take damage distracts and absorb.
---
There's a lot wrong with this idea but making it harder for nullbears isn't a bad concept.
---
In every way possible
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/97079651/ All of these kills last night wouldn't of happened without the blackout
---
But they will still know it's you when they initiate warp to you, and land in their site, or can't warp to you due to being too close.
---
Just web it on an alt.
---
You would know on the first tick...
---
Who said I want "big-isk killmails"? I'd rather go out and trade kills with a fleet of hurricanes or some shit than jump around ganking supers/caps/carriers. Also, it's not like ratting/mining under the cover of a fleet of cap alts is "high skill" gameplay.
---
Worth noting that the changes that brought us to the current state of eve could be described as "make my way easier by making someone else's harder" for people wanting to mine/rat in 0.0 so even by your logic we should revert them and make eve more dangerous again.
---
Anyone other than afk ratters that thinks the VNI change is a nerf is just plain silly. Ship will be baller now for so much shit.
---
you are either gonna need a cruiser like a caracal, or grab 2 friends and do it in frigates.
---
lowest tier abyss works in trash T1 frigates, so that might be your best bet if you are super tight on ISK in the beginning.
---
but keep in mind fitting needs some thought behind it, and the type of filament strongly influences what you need to bring (for example, there are filaments where turrets get negative modifiers, you wont wanna take a turret ship in there)
---
isn't that set in the store right now?
---
don't underestimate goon hatred for other goons
---
The game is free to start.
---
Just jump in.
---
their leadership have said in the past that they never intend to actually conquer everything because then what tbh
---
also you seem to underestimate what it takes to "win everything", it's more than in-game wealth or arms superiority. goons are comfortable on the top of the food chain, but swallowing the entire thing not only requires way higher material cost and effort, but also requires the whole organization to shift into a certain mindset.
---
Boring!
---
I have to replace a power supply on my PC first. Hopefully that's the only thing that's wrong with it, if not then it's going to be even longer.

eh, i've been in some proper mining fleets like you described not too long ago. its just a matter of finding people that arent lazy, and enjoy chilling on voice chat while actively doing stuff instead of watching netflix alone.
---
the yield is a LOT higher with the fleet. barges technically are in a good place, and the orca yield on its own is pretty garbage. its just that many people tend to avoid the activity and social interaction of a fleet, and rather sod off to their corner of space alone and afk mine.  
---
.....and then there is nullsec, where the solo miner gets the yield of 5 barges from his drones for his afk ship. but thats a whole different topic.

Dreddit is recruiting BTW. If you haven't heard of us we are a large corp that belongs to and founded test alliance. As one of the largest corps in test we offer many things to new and older members. For any newer member i would recommend looking into our mentor program as it pairs new pilots with old vets to help you in the many challenges of Eve. For older pilots just looking to fly with friends, we ping fleets every couple hours. Whether its a nano gang, kitchen sink, or bombing run theres always someone looking to create some content for you to enjoy. If you questions feel free to pop into our public discord and anyone would be more than willing to answer any questions about us as a corp. https://discord.gg/eeCX7ch

Do you really think a krab is going to do this?
---
You must be new here.  Enjoy and embrace the Naz
---
&gt; Then the ratters quit, and you have no targets.
---
they quit null sec, they won't quit the game.
---
most pve is done to fund pvp (and kill time between fleets), it's just a necessary evil.
---
anom ratting was an efficient and easy way of doing it, when it stops being so they'll do it elsewhere - i remember back in the day 30+ of the 40 odd members in any given high sec incursion were just null alts farming isk for caps/supers. before rorquals were a thing.
---
&gt;With blackout, CCP ends AFK ratting being worthwhile.
---
kind of ends all subcap ratting being worth while - the only real way to defend yourself while ratting in a paper thin ship that's worthless in a pvp encounter is to not get in to an encounter to begin with by avoiding a fight. (and by fight, i mean one sided gank where you're literally just waiting for an ec300 jam - dice deciding your fate for not paying attention).
---
once you start doing the whole "then pve with a pvp fit bullshit" you've already reducing  the effectiveness of your pve ability such that the pve you're doing in a bait ship isn't worth doing to begin with.
---
&gt;So congrats guys! You're driving people towards more caps.
---
yep, the very thing they whine constantly about. something to do with proliferation and umbrellas.
---
so, you and 4 spies.

Interesting will look into it.
---
awesome glad i didnt disappoint :)

Honestly above 1 bil isk + is a potential target. I've seen empty freighters die too. Just be aware of the bumpers and when there are fleets up to kill you

**Expected consequences**
---
* **Some alliances will immediately start wanting to look for better space**
---
* **In the longer run, there'll be more conflicts going on, with more localized goals**
---
* **Newer alliances will have an easier time getting a foothold in nullsec**
---
* **Coalitions will be marginally less stable**
---
* **Alliances will have to choose more carefully what space they develop, where their staging systems are, and so on (low truesec systems generally tend to be in strategically inconvenient places)**
---
Not only did it not work, it made things worse. People just sent (or made) alts to go pve for isk else where like high sec incursions, missions and low sec faction warfare stuff.
---
History shows us that people don't fight over anomalies and other pve when there are other less costly methods of making money. EVE has WAY more isk making methods now than it did in 2011 (Abyssal deadspace, invasions, burner missions etc etc). And by the early look at the abyss materials market, it's already happening.

So iirc dave is with the serpentis, but this is the sansha. Whats your friends name? :D

So... they have effectively got rid of just one more thing for alphas to do in nullsec. So other than exploration and mining... there’s really no point for alphas to be in nullsec. So exploration is about to get too competitive and mining well... is mining. L4 mission running it is!

what the fuck i gave him silver i could have given him nothing but now he has food to eat a roof over his head and a life to lead don't boo me
---
My girlfriend has less that fuck all interest in anything sci-fi. You have my jealousy! 
---
But she does like playing Overcooked and Stardew Valley, so there's that
---
look at the skins you get from the trig invasioin LP.
---
This thread is going too on for an Aeon
---
The two-ship combo you describe is definitely the right way to look at it. 
---
Obviously, that's not the only successful way to fit a ship, but you've got the line of thinking down already. And this should help you make smarter skill training choices too.
---
Yes, either that or stop rafting.
---
No u
---
Science journals are fake news. Follow Twitter only for the real alternative facts.
---
It worked in real life, so no reason why racing to the lowest common denominator shouldn't work in Eve =/
---
What's the cheapest thing that can solo a c5 site? 
---
And what's the shortest skill train to solo a c5 site?
---
I'm in a c5 Corp and an experienced player joined the Corp with a maurader that can solo them and I was just curious. I only have 1 account currently. I want to get more after i get a new computer.
---
Nope, 1st account expires in August 2019 and 2nd in October 2019. No, you cannot have my stuff.
---
If you pay for it, sure
---
That doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
God damn I've missed you
---
Don't forget youtube!
---
Yeah 100% agree with you, people say "oh you won't be missed", but actually yes they will be missed because that'll be x number of targets left for them to hunt! I just cancelled my two paid for with real money accounts because of this stupid blackout, and will be looking for another space mmo, plenty out there.
---
Is there any ingame channels for finding npc mining hunters I want the gallente skins for RP I like the gallente stuff can I solo any of them? I'm currently in a c5 Corp so getting to hs is hard sometimes I'd like to just be able to join one when I have the time and the opportunity rises.
---
They laughed when I said I wanted to rat in an armageddon. Who's laughing now? WHO'S LAUGHING NOW DAD?
---
Its not?
---
It kinda is. Its in VIP mode

because that screen lists base HP, before the drone durability bonus is added.

was it adblock that started selling whitelisting for ads?
---
Your Tsedd talk needs more substance
---
Shit changes \*\*nerf\*\* as usual!
---
something weird is going on with the calculations.
---
1664 is the base ehp for hull+armour, without shields or skill bonuses.
---
Lolol - do you even Eve, silly man? Or are you theory crafting while feathering that low sec gate somewhere in the middle of nowhere?
---
welp, that's odd but I'll take it.
---
Naz has surpassed being Mittens herald. He is Eve's herald now.
---
When half of your weapons already could deal 400 dps, yeah, sounds balanced
---
Not till you have cloaky-warpy dreads, lol. What's wrong with you..
---
Honestly the Brisc Resurrection one is my favorite, hard to top that
---
Yea it's a bug I think, submit a support ticket. It'll probably solve itself after downtime, but with ticket you'll prob get an extra free day of omega.
---
You make solid points but I dont fully get some of the things youre saying.
---
No one expected good online numbers? Who are these no ones. People were parading about how they were coming back to the game and this was basically the second coming. I would say that constitutes as quite the opposite, people were expecting higher numbers, a return to the good ole days.
---
And the bot question, I mean. You cant really base any discussion on what bots do or dont. For one, we can assume we know who the bots are but in all honesty, its really hard to actually 100% know which ones are bots unless they die and warp back in capsules and try to pew. And even if "bots" in NS have stopped logging in (which is a big if cause they could have been regular players) that doesnt mean that bots in HS havent gone up to cover that particular login loss. We simply cant base anything on bots in this discussion, not even CCP can do it since they dont know who is a bot until a long time after.
---
What we can say tho is that a couple of thousand drop (which was like 4,5k during saturday primetime I believe) is most likely not a random drop nor is it insignificant. Just run the numbers, 32k online before this, saturday primetime. Lets say 40% is NS. Thats 12,8k in NS, most likely the drop comes from that segment so 4,5k out of 12,8k is roughly a 35% drop. Thats by no means "meh doesnt matter much". 
---
And regarding zkill, people keep saying PvP has gone up. Maybe it has but to my knowledge no one has actually compiled any real numbers yet right? Is the total destruction in NS lower or higher than before? More players or less involved? And so on. Im not saying youre wrong in any of the things you say but Im suspecting bloc PvP has lost ground but small gang has gained some. Is net PvP positive or it is negative?
---
I.e., did we fuck over both PvE and PvP for NS?
---
*NC.
---
Used to be you showed them the "This is eve" video followed by the This is REALLY eve" video and that would cover it.
---
This kind of wrongheaded thinking is how I got ganked in a miasmos while still alpha in my first week of play while autopiloting through uedama. I had an empty ore hold, and was hauling some inexpensive fittings back in the cargo bay.
---
I figured nobody would bother given my ship, fit, and the cargo was worthless. I was very wrong. Many people simply *do not care* if you are hauling anything, if they're bored enough you'll die because they can kill you.
---
Now certainly, hauling expensive stuff *will* get peoples attention and make you more likely to die - use a freighter or orca for its strengths, and make it move the really big things nothing else can do.
---
...
---
But you can't really assign a price limit to your cargo and make the presumption nobody will bother - trust me, someone will eventually, if only because you are there right that moment.
---
Oh, and the autopiloting thing? Don't do it. Just don't.
---
When it comes to hauling in general, and this applies to a freighter/orca - you have to get it through your head, you're going to lose this ship sometimes, so even if you *think* you'll be fine, be prepared to lose the ship, your clone, and all of the cargo. It *will* happen some day.
---
The front fell off?
---
Accurate. Also a thing to keep in mind when ccp does something "for the new players".
---
If there was a way to harness the power of angry nerds we wouldn’t have to drill for oil.
---
Why do I keep reading your post
---
This change was first talked about in feb(to my knowledge), so the old CSM maybe? Looks like Suitonia would have a hand in. Him and Jin'tan are generally great with balancing mechanics.
---
He says it like it's an insult
---
Imagine a new player corp not requiring new players to complete an application to join. What a concept.
---
Sounds awesome. Could you share a typical fit for each?
---
Not just when you start atm, though soon ccp said it might become just for when you are new i think.
---
https://secure.eveonline.com/DLC/
---
The ship is no longer active so your drone durability skill is not taken into consideration?
---
My point is bots can't ask for help from their alliance or key up on teamspeak unlike players. Also most current bots just do nothing and die currently when they get caught
---
Are you repairing a ship you aren’t currently in? Could be the reason why the skills aren’t being calculated?
---
*Shame the writer didn't proof read for mistakes either.*
---
I dunno, I think I did pretty well for writing it in 90 minutes. Also: I feel like people are going in *adding* errors. I swear I did actually proofread it, and so did the other editors.
---
Yeah, Im with you on this one. Do... do we need to make a donation drive to get this guy a spot in the nuthouse? Or a writing deal with Stephen King?
---
*I don't think the author is even arguing against the blackout itself, just the perception that it is the one-stop-fix-everything solution.*
---
Precisely. The Blackout isn't even billed as a fix. It's a *test*. CCP wants to gather data, and that's going to take at least another 2 weeks of this. At least. And we shouldn't get impatient.
---
So far, it *is* a good thing. There's ways to make it better, but you don't change your testing conditions mid-way. I just hope they have the balls to keep going, and don't just call this 'good enough'.
---
Shrug,  that's why brawling ship use blasters
---
It totally does.
---
Basically saying "Why are you doing THIS when you haven't fixed THIS OTHER THING?"
---
iunno you have bad taste
---
try reading stephen king like i did that was great except for it, the sex scene at the end was really fucking weird
---
The US Army would invade Azeroth at the behest of Horde-Haliburton

Ever tried actually *reading* the article?
---
Also, no, that's not what the political saying means. What it means is that you didn't communicate clearly enough the first time to not need to explain. It has nothing to do with honesty, and everything to do with setting the tempo and direction of the discussion.

---
Yes, that's how MWD works. No, no one is entitled to kills. Reducing fighter application to subcaps doesn't "guarantee kills"  
---
It means there's an actual choice to be made regarding what to bring to fight people who come to your space. It used to be you had to make a measured decision on what ships to bring, what support to bring, and what tackle ships to bring.   
---
Now, it literally doesn't matter. A single player in a supercap does all the roles that used to be filled by individual players thanks to EWAR fighters and busted LR fighter application. Who needs to bring a defense fleet that includes a whole bunch of people when a single person in a supercap can counter a fleet by himself. Let alone 2 or 3 supercaps.   
---
If you like, go read the VNI change devblog. It is being changed for a variety of reasons, one of them being it's current stats completely remove any *decision* or *choice* or *variety* in what ships to use for anom ratting in 0.0, especially for cruiser size hulls. Likewise, I'd like to see the same being done to carriers that have for too long encroached on the role of subcap defense fleets, but also specialized roles that once required t2 ships to be be accomplished.  
---
Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.
---
No, that's the only ship I had in station. Only thing I can think of is maybe the game only applies certain skills while in space? Other than that, I got nothing.
---
I would name him mark, becouse it's zuccubus
---
You have never experienced wierd until you met that sisi corp.
---
They will hot drop you, shit talk, and tell you to go back to your ez mode server 🤷‍♂️😆
---
Its actually an imp ree but close enuf
---
Which is a totally valid criticism. It has to do with priority, and has nothing to do with whataboutism.
---
Yeah, it was kinda weird, that an ishtar was basically the same in terms of ratting. But costs like 4-5x more.
---
Shit right sorry forgot my glasses
---
Convo fleet boss, ask who is in system with you. Warp to them or have HR check wallet logs. Don't say anything in comms. If that guy has anything blingy, get him to undock and Scruff him.

Eve has a great ost. Sadly i cant fond my favorite track because there are so many of them. :( Im talking the one which sounds like wub wub wubwubwub. I remember doing that mission where they explain you why eve space has sound. Feels so nostalgic you, incursus, wubwub, so cute.

Lucky (unlucky for me) you can see fleet member in the same system via starmap
---
Are you using any Asus products? Looks like Asus Sonar a software you have installed maybe?
---
 Thats a core mechanic change whilst the ECM one if a nerf. 
---
Going from "your target can't target anything" to "your target can target only you" is a core mechanics change. A nerf would have been adjusting the jam values so it gets harder to jam things.
---
My point is that you never should assume CCP isn't going to change mechanics suddenly, escpially those people are complaining about for years.
---
&gt; Nobody is complaining about nerfs 
---
You must be new here and also might want to check the forums once a nerf hits.
---
&gt; Ofc it was intented for intel, what other purpose would it have? 
---
I wasn't there for the first few years of EVE, but my guess is that it was just the easiest way at the time to show there are other people in space at all. With the intention to give players a way to interact with each other.
---
&gt; There are a lot of specific issues to NS. 
---
Care to name a couple that are nullsec exclusive?
---
&gt; People joined and stayed in NS based on that ratio of advantages-disadvantages 
---
That applies to all areas of EVE. Now CCP made the decision that there are too many advantages.
---
&gt; But changing a core mechanic changes the entire picture, it no longer becomes a question of advantages-disadvantages in that sense, it becomes "do I wanna live in a WH" kind of thing. 
---
If WHs had titans, supers, cynos, jump bridges, unlimited ore and anomalies with escalations I would agree with you, but they don't.
---
I've funded my horde spy for a few years like this, it's even easier now.
---
Can I get a TLDR version of this pls
---
Lmfao
---
Except it IS when it's being used as the argument for why THIS is bad.
---
Alphas can also get Light Drone Operation V for T2 light drones.
---
Naz is our flagship shitposter, if B happens let's just say it'll be a night to remember
---
Oh nooo my anom ratting was nerfed! There’s literally nothing else I can do to make isk!
---
If you can’t adapt to your style of ratting getting nerfed then please fucking quit (make sure to biomass so you aren’t tempted to come back).
---
Funny how null sec thinks super ticks are even good to begin with. It’s almost like they’re too risk adverse to jump into a wormhole without a giant blob of f1 monkeys with them
---
And experimentally, so we'll see
---
"for the little guy" always ends up fucking them.
---
Hate citadel timers? They were literally designed this way to cater to people who can only play on weekends and don't want to lose their assets in timezones they cannot contest.  
---
Hate fozziesov? -&gt; little guy  
---
Hate jump fatigue? -&gt; little guys  
---
etc
---
If, from a game design perspective, CCP was to acknoledge the AFK/multibox playstyle and cater to it openly, there's no reason no to do this for all weapon types. Make it a high-slot AI module allows all of your weapons to aggression the way drones do and carries a hefty damage/tank penalty. Heck, go one step further and allow players to load advanced scripts on it to code their ships behaviour to optimize encounters and fully embrace the simplicity of EVE PVE. Krabbing without automation or multiboxing is often so boring I don't blame people for AFKing. So acknowledge it and make it a strength by catering to that style while preserving balance.
---
Extract the SP instead

---
The accounting part is very very close to what was said, i was just paraphrasing because I can't remember exact to quote. And while you may be right about direct subs almost always being the best thing, the PLEX itself is still a bigger revenue than subs if you have mulitiple accounts PLEXed vs SUBed.

Are this kind of events that you must land final blow or take part of the kill?

Reported for a use of slurs

There aren't good alternatives for an alpha account especially now that they can't use augmented drones.

Gila would be the closest t1 ship but it's much more sp intensive, also affected by the nerf to alpha drone skills.

A compilation of Gangs and Fights direct from my stream with my Arty Wolf as a Tribute to the Blackout event. May it last for ever.
---
In only one week of streaming our Blackout roams we got an insane number of solo gangs - fights so we honored BoB by engaging everyone and everything while trash talking our way to victory.
---
I am by no means top tier pilot but i hope this video will give you a roughly idea of the targets you can possibly take down with your arty wolfs by exploiting more inexperienced pilots.
---
Thank you CCP. Best change ever.
---
Fucking agreed. EVE's music is just magical, and I've been playing it as I work or sleep for many years, long after I shut off all sound in the game. It's incredibly peaceful, and a bit dark without being morbid. Just you and the unknown. 
---
If I somehow live long enough and have enough money to see space tourism, as I orbit the earth looking out over the horizon below me...[Surplus of Rare Artifacts)(https://youtu.be/ZoJDApTMM6g) is what will be playing softly in the background as I do.
---
Well I wish I was a millionare, I would do it.
---
I didn't know I was subscribed to an EVE version of NSFW writing prompts
---
Missed you too
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
Blackout works because everyone decided to pvp all of a sudden, using blackout as a rallying cry. Nothing related local.
---
Ah ye no. Kills like that were regular before the blackout. Meaning the odds of them purely being due to the blackout as being low.
---
Ill give you the excav kills since the only counter was local but the Rorq itself? Wasnt like it would usually hide behind a rock if you entered the system.
---
And the point he was making is that the more you get of these kills, the more players realise that they actually dont have counters against being ganked, the less you will see these kms since people will simply stop undocking them. And instead start undocking things your crew cant kill fast enough, i.e., supers.
---
So in the end it will be a netloss, not a gain. You are happy today but if no local becomes permanent then content will dry up.
---
Cool
---
Hehe so true mon.

I’ll drink to that bro, I remember my first naz post. It’s truly an enlightening experience when you get all the jokes in a naz post, and achieve perfection retardation.
---
Just started playing earlier in the week. I'm finding solo mining in high-sec pretty good as a semi-afk activity while watching Netflix on another monitor, reading, etc while spending my active time doing other stuff. I'm leveling up skills to get into and properly fit a procurer. I was wondering at what point do you become an attractive target for suicide gankers? if you're well fitted and in high sec do people still try? At the moment with my venture I haven't really had any issues.
---
So, Peter?
---
Ever heard the saying, "the loudest voice is the weakest in the room"?
---
That is you guys posting on reddit.
---
I mean, I only went there a few times, but I would have gotten a good solo jackdaw kill if I hadn’t been bad. Haven’t been recently because getting in or out is a massive pain, since you really need to use wormholes or you’ll die to a gatecamp, but from what I’ve seen it’s not bad once you’re there.
---
There's also another saying, the devil is in the details.
---
It makes me wonder what EvE would look like without GrrGoons.  There are even developers who were swayed by it.
---
Fun fun fun

It's eve's version of "Think of the children!"

You're completely right. All those coalitions shoot eachother, except for the anti Rorqual whaling agreements, except for the anti cloaky camping agreements, except for the NIP between legacy, GOTG and imperium, except for the NIP between FRT and Panfam, except for the mutual drifter defence agreements, except for the burn Highsec agreements.
---
The reason goons declared war was because it was pre ordained, they definately weren't called in because TEST, pirat and Horde couldn't handle 40 stupid wormhole bros. It was just a formality.
---
Repurpose would do aswell
---
When I did the math last year it was 6008 injectors accounting for diminished returns, it was only 4.3t isk but that's because you were still able to get them for 700m each.
---
It is 512m SP to train everything. Actually I just remembered this was before trig skills were expanded so slightly more now.
---
You can use web alts to speed up your time to warp (some ships have web bonuses) and scouts can help if you have ganker corps red listed. 
---
If you are going through low and or null sec you probably want a jump freighter.
---
no u
---
Two things are so very wrong about this argument: 
---
1. It might seem like you are arguing that botters/krabbers are actually good for the game, because they buy plex to keep their accounts going - that is obviously not true.
---
2. Having say 10k people buying plex so they can continue botting / afk-farming is in no way good for active players - even if those active players sell plex to said botters.
---
Yes. Plex prices would be kept up, because you'd have thousands of accounts being run by eithers "bots" or "afk-ratting", but the very same accounts are inflating the entire ingame economy by hauling in endless amounts of ISK while not providing any actual content or REAL money to CCP. They are bad for the game, bad for CCP, bad for everyone.
---
I don't mind people who run their accounts by plexing, but plexing your accounts was something which was meant to take some effort. Anyone can - by spending a relatively small amount of time in the game - plex their accounts, but simply being able to have an endless amount of accounts because plexing can be done without even being at the computer is just stupid and NOT how the plex system was intended.
---
Next thing CCP should look at, is the "skill extractor"-abuse, which is yet another way people keep hundreds of accounts running without ever actually playing with them.
---
nah, was just short of 3.50
---
No
---
Needs to be graphically delivered in Marvel comic style.
---
My killboard alone says otherwise. I've killed plenty of bots who cant cheat now. And lastly, would you happen to know where replicator is camping right now?
---
my source of factual information are critical furry skeptics on YouTube
---
I have the old eve music and from to time i play it for a whole day when i am at work.
---
You would not. The injection prompt may say you do but you definitely do not get the SP once you cross the threshold. I found this out when I crossed the threshold at 50m sp.
---
Venture 😸
---
There is a disconnect. In the first half there is an entire section dedicated to the gathering of data and how it's affecting the game, logins, jumps etc and then afterwards there is a section entirely about how CCP doesn't know anything. 
---
Then apparently telling someone to eat your ass in an online video game is apparently enough to trigger a war but that's only true if your ego is such that you would attempt to use personal slights as a reason for war. A complete disregard for what that war would cost and what the risk of that would be. The game isn't the same as it used to be, people aren't throwing down over people saying mean things about people's girlfriends anymore, so trying to say that this personal damage is enough to trigger fights anymore doesn't work. 
---
The part about ratters having to get smarter almost mentions the ease of PvE in the game but doesn't go so far as to actually do it. The increased skill floor to make money being raised means that there is a drop in the amount of isk being pumped into the game, something that has a macro effect on the economy on the game, something that could change the tectonics of how the economy works. 
---
 This talk also of how smaller groups are screwed also shows a very limited exploration of the possible outcomes. As the large empires contract to keep their umbrella active over their denizens there will be empty space. Something pointed out as a negative but that space is where small groups could operate and be unleashed. As the mass pumping of isk is reduced and markets start to be affected by this change there's a possibility that this in between space could be traversed by isk seeking risk takers. The day trips into nullsec instead of having a permanent presence in those systems and could open up interesting  groups operating in them. The space could return to the wild. 
---
I look forward to how the game will turn out.

You definitely did a good job on the article my dude. I didn't need to mention the mistakes but I thought it a shame as so often overly heavy criticism attaches itself to small things. Thank you for taking the time to write anything.
---
Got any VNI fits?
---
&gt;This kind of wrongheaded thinking is how I got ganked in a miasmos while still alpha in my first week of play while autopiloting through uedama. I had an empty ore hold, and was hauling some inexpensive fittings back in the cargo bay.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I figured nobody would bother given my ship, fit, and the cargo was worthless. I was very wrong. Many people simply do not care if you are hauling anything, if they're bored enough you'll die because they can kill you.
---
People *do* care. Yes, flying or autopiloting an empty untanked ship that can be exploded by a few million in destroyers is always risky, and someone my pop you for fun or out of boredom, but if you fit enough tank to leverage the cost CONCORD imposes on the attacker for doing so, you massively decrease the risk of being shot. No one is going to spend hundreds of millions of ISK in gank ships to explode your empty tanked Orca for example. Sure it can happen if you are in the wrong place during some event or when a FC needs to feed a ship to his bored members, but it almost never does. 
---
Keeping your cargo below the limit of profitability will keep you safe from the professional pirates who make up the bulk of the risk for real haulers - they will scan you and if not profitable they won't think twice about attacking. The weaker your ship, and the more easy to be killed by a solo player or small fleet, the more risk you have of being shot for fun or ideology, but definitely profit is a primary factor setting your risk.
---
Your advice to be prepared to lose the odd ship is good - I just bristle at those that suggest nothing you do as a hauler makes a difference as there is always the chance you can be ganked. That is wrong: you have all cards in mitigating that risk and flying with sane value of cargo is maybe your best one for keeping safe.
---
Been waiting for this since the start of black out, thanks naz
---
You just approach people one by one and when you allign to one you know it's them then you get them kicked from alliance. This was a thing before the blackout sadly OP didn't discover hot water.

How do I sign up for this service?

Too bad they removed the jukebox and I have to turn music to 0.
---
Nullsec music is always the same soundtrack and it gives you depression after some time :/
---
Also enjoy listening to the good old highsec music myself, even outside of eve
---
Its funny. He will notice it immediately. People who rats checks the ticks. Besides he doesn't need to check fleets. He can make his own private fleet. 
---
If you really want to be risk. Start belt ratting in a stealth bomber and hit bs.
---
how hard is it really to tell the bot to say something in a certain channel? They are already running the mouse, how hard can working the copy+paste function be?
---
Well to be fair, I did make it before they added the x-page header XD
---
" Imagine a new player corp not requiring spies to complete an application to join. What a concept."
---
FTFY

Except they know as soon as they kill the first rat as many people have said. This isn't even a new concept.

"Nouvelle Rouvenor Hero" and "We Fight Proud For The Holder" are my two favorites... i even began to name my gallente ship "Nouvelle Rouvenor"... rip to all who died on that day by caldari scum...

i need somehow to get back into this game.........
---
I'm glad you're getting this addressed and stuff, but, why did you make the decision that despite nothing rendering on your screen, it would be safe to jump?

If your client is demonstrably not functioning correctly, docking up is probably where you should be until the issue is resolved.

Are you sure?

Can someone explain?
---
Or just check the map and you can see who's in system youself. I guess the fleet boss can tell you who's in a cloaky ship tho.
---
Citadel is about to be destroyed - right click on all assets - deliver to "my asset safety alt that was never logged in"
---
Was thinking the same thing
---
So I deleted the post because I will concede the their fit was highly optimal.  I always assume no-boosts, as I assume worst-case.
---
You are correct that with boosts, this fit is the top tier, but only under the consideration of 'how much -gj/s can I soak', like I said somewhere.  
---
If you accept a minor reduction of gj/s, you can massively increase the tanking potential.  
---
Prey tell, did this 100bn monstrosity die to nets, or 30,000 dps.  I suspect it was the 30,000 dps since there are fuck all neuting ships on the KM.
---
Ergo, nice fit lol.
---
I was told Hull pen
---
Not surprising.
---
1. Get a job

2. Work two hours

3. Buy plex with cash

4. Sell plex for isk

5. Make those dank 2bil/isk per hour ticks

Maybe edit your post to have the hull timer! More people might show up!

It should be around two days from now.

Eve's New Project in  Vr? What's that?

Ok will try get fleet for it! See you on the dance floor!
---
I plan on being asleep for it. I have to go to work.
---
The data centers are missions, so you need to have a minimum standing to accept them. Unfortunately, that makes them rather unsuitable for repairing negative standings.
---
The real travesty is we don't have an option to use the old multicoloured Neocom
---
You only need the standing if you want to join the NPC militia corp. You can just join a player fw corp and quickly get your standings fixed by plexing.

Oddly, I think a lot of partners would prefer to know their partner is gay / bi then a gamer ...

Did you dare to log on again?

Thanks for *explaining*
---
&gt; The first few days there was lots of activity and now it has already started to die off. 
---
This might be related to the first few days being a weekend and most people having less time for EVE on weekdays. Let's see how this weekend goes!
---
Yeah. It's hilarious to see a fleet of battle logis running around Black Rise.
---
Someone should teach an EWAR class and take a fleet of brawl Griffins to Tama.
---
Yea my skills are pretty high but its not like Ive spent 2 months specifically just for the fit to work. Here’s the fit
---
[Gila, T4 Gamma Gila]
---
Rapid Light Missile Launcher II
---
10MN Afterburner II
---
Large Shield Extender II
---
Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
Nanite Repair Paste x100
---
Scourge Fury Light Missile x8000
---
How is arty wolf projection? The dps has always looked a touch anemic
---
JB's didn't kill that, wormholes did.
---
I was playing before that time even, I was there and did that and saw the changes first hand.
---
Damn that looks fun
---
U guys recruiting?
---
Your Best one.
---
I am not permabanned you moron and was not banned for RMT with IWISK lol... My ban was posted on here multiple times.
---
And it was it was more like 22.5k worth of skill injectors and 1.8k in skills at the time due to some being rare skills from releases such as Red Moon rising.
---
And yes I was not retarded enough to spend RL money buying all them skills...
---
More like 400 to 600 mil depending who and where you bought from.
---
get out, we hate you
---
Wow, such great argumentation
---
Abuse
---
WTB more T1 frig fights in the warzone. bob1069r Arnst btw.
---
\&gt; Goon flair
---
Someone might find it funny to respond by bringing a fleet to Delve with Benghazi-related ship names.
---
What makes you think you are entitled to it being easy?
---
There are a couple good situations for me as a solo pvp pilot, where my drones can attack something even though beeing ecm'ed or damped to shit. 
---
So i can understand your point for PVE activities, but it saved my pvp ass a couple times not being able to do anything with my weapons, but my little drones did free me :)
---
&gt; As well as I take games very seriously, which results in many players not liking me because of it.
---
This won't be an issue in eve, the amount of commitment people put into this game is argue it's near impossible to do anything major without taking the game at least semi seriously
---
[HTFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvM7av1o1Q)
---
nice video! maybe a little editing to speed up some parts would have helped with the pacing
---
Beat me to it, these are basically what I fly. I'll buy a few blingy ones and a bunch of basic ones. When I feel like just flying fast and loose til I die I'll take the cheap ones.
---
Wut it doesn't? IT'S NOW UTTER TRASH!!   It was already but this is crossing the line!
---
That's the best story i read in while. 
---
Take my Upvote, you magnificent sir.
---
Don't get attached to your ships. They will be destroyed sooner or later.
---
Well thats true. I guess thats a core mechanic for ecm, but not for the game in itself. You have to agree that changing the entirety of null into delayed local is a hell of lot bigger than changing a a specific subset of ships. The ecm change, although the SP required is different, is in line with the VNI change or if drones become useless due to droneaggro being changed or something like that. Not saying it doesnt suck and dont matter but reasons for picking a specific shiptype and reasons for picking a place to live isnt the same.
---
People will always complain on the forums, thats human nature. But if you actually live in null, thats where you can gauge if people are actually butthurt about a nerf. And I can tell you people werent really upset about the previous nerfs but no local has pissed many off.
---
I wasnt here either but from what I gather it got introduced 2011. Showing that there are other people in space is intel, its information. I cant think of any way local would be used for any other means than information, what you do with that is another question entirely, but the first step is always just that info, intel.
---
PAPs, rules and regulations, worse markets, having to do multiple hour long fleets for the good of the group, having to do multiple multiple hour fleets on some days, tidi. Now this can be applied practically anywhere but there is no place these things exist in the same manner as in NS. And the list can be made longer and longer.
---
CCP hasnt made any decision other than they want to try something. Why they are doing it is speculation until they actually tell us. Sure we can guess but we cant know. And honestly, remember now that CCP are the ones who introduces all the shit people are complaining about. To just forget that history and assume that CCP are doing a good thing here is a bit premature. 
---
 You said it, they dont. Which is why one cant apply something that works there in NS and expect the same results. WHs dont have to worry about a cyno opening up on them, they have holecontrol and in general a different culture. Those things (and others) make no local work.
---
I get why people are hailing no local and I get why people are vehemently arguing for it. The issue is for one that so many are happy whilst its made many others miserable. No matter what, that wont ever be a good change for the game. Any good change will make both sides equally miserable.
---
Secondly, I doubt many are actually looking at it objectively but instead just going purely of "im having fun". Pretty much everything that people are hailing today will change in time if this change becomes permanent and it will only be another step in a long line of CCP steps to ensure more stagnation.
---
I simply dont believe this will fix nor put us on the right path to fix the real issues. I only see it as another mechanic that will compound the problem. And it shouldnt come as a suprise that people often go for the easy way without thinking about the long term effects of ones actions. I just hope we dont fk up too much before people actually realise this change wasnt for the better.
---
Years of reading killmails has taught me that is impossible.
---
Lol, that is reserved for friends who ask what is the game "evo" I keep playing.
---
Everytime I play space vidya I always put on the EVE soundtrack and mute their music. Nothing will ever top that first moment of warping with Below the Asteroids softly flowing in the background.
---
Perfection.
---
As someone who loves blops, I would love a cyno spool up. Something similar to the MJD time (longer spool without skill, shorter spool at max skill). However, hunting ships would need some way of surviving that time.
---
If we can balance hunters to be able to live for that long, with good pilot skills and player skills (eg. heat management, drug usage, etc) then I think a spool up would be great.
---
It would slow down blops, yes, but it would (like you said) also slow down the ability for big groups to just cyno in an umbrella anytime something is tackled in their space.
---
Welcome to EVE! Message Alexander Otium in-game if you'd like some help, I like helping new players.
---
Pretty much this. You join one of the big null blocs and you know what you are getting everytime. There will be a support structure there for you to learn the game as most of these have buddie programs and newbie fleets to help teach how to play and the chances are there will always be someone online available to help you. Joining a small "noob friendly" corp might not be as active, they won't have as large of a support network set up ect...
---
Icons and description are not a valid reason .
---
Being boosters is one.
---
As others already said, rep bonus.

then no wonder he died.

I like rafting, they got some good water in tirol.

You can't deny me that. :(

Just to add skills to training..
---
Mittens is a Loch Ness Monster?
---
No we don't want any more of this monetarizations in EVE.       
---
You have no idea how the eve works.       
---
Just to give you an example.      
---
Currently i have 5 omega accounts running, 4 of them i consider permanent the 5 th one is one of the 15-30? (aka i have no idea how many i have) alpha accounts that i have and that i sub them whenever i need to utilize chars on them.       
---
Sometimes i sub 2-3 of the alpha accounts, sometimes i go down to 4 omega.        
---
Currently i am thinking about "kickstarting like 20 new alpha accounts - for the same usability"          
---
To give you better idea those alpha accounts have all chars with at least 5mil sp each, on some i have chars that have up to like 15mil sp.         
---
I am 'small guy' but there is plenty of people like me.      
---
Tell me how CCP handle this situation  ;)        
---
Simply it cannot.
---
OPs is right about the inn blog. Big posts and big words with more than five letters. I dont trust it because i struggle reading it.
---
but if you inject all of them before you actually apply the injectors, doesnt this not happen?
---
so just inject it all in one go and your golden
---
I agree with you that a lot people arguing for the changes are doing it because they are having more fun.
---
&gt; Any good change will make both sides equally miserable. 
---
I think you got mixed up there, you are thinking about *compromises*. A change that makes things worse for everyone doesn't make anyone happy.
---
Stagnation is a serious issue nad I agree with you, that it will not be fixed with local changes. To be honest, I can't come up with any good solutions to counter stagnation at all.
---
I however don't think those changes are aimed at fixing the real issues. As someone who likes those changes, I hope the data will prove this change was for the better, we should not jump to conclusions at this point, since we have no clue about which metrics exactly make it "better" from CCPs perspective.
---
depends on the systems you go through.
---
I sometimes haul up to 3b in freigthers, in jita.
---
I think I would prefer 50% of wormholes appearing as immediately visible anoms and 50% needing scanning.
---
Was a fun fight
---
The anti-what-agreement? We have such a thing? I need to tell my corp, squad and sig directors about this because they don't seem to know about this...
---
Ha!  Well played!
---
1. Find a c5

2. Put a fort and 2 pve dreads in

3. ???

4. $$$$$$$$

i love you &lt;3

That looks awesome

Human rights..I giggled
---
Well, that means it has evolved from being a ~~fidget~~ ship spinning simulator.
---
Well for a big part of the society , videos games are bad, make people violent it's only virtual things, stop you from socializing and so on
---
Like it's hard to understand how someone can enjoy play with things that are only virtual with people that can be far away and have strong bonds with them
---
so sit in a stealth bomber aligned out. got it

Naz makes me love this subreddit

If I buy omega now will i get access to the skill points from the days I missed of this event?
---
and it blinks up with every new entry, didn't knew that zkill map until now and it's awesome .. but i am missing the lines and system names i only see glowing points?! I am kinda used to orientate  myself on the map using the lines more than the dots
---
I could understand this notion for null, but how does it break immersion for the constantly monitored empire space?
---
we can call them BLACKED ships
---
Reported? You should fucking sue them!
---
That changed over a year ago, in practice you will still get ganked even at less than a billion in cargo, it depends if the gank squads have caught enough recently to keep them from being bored, 1bn is a good benchmark. 
---

Don’t use destroyers, start in frigates (in my humble opinion, of course).  They won’t output as much damage as a destroyer, but they are far more nimble, meaning that you can quickly get used to one of the most important concepts of PVP in EVE... dictating range.
---
My opinion is that the Tristan is currently the gold standard for learning PvP as a beginner.  Why? Because it can viably fill all of the different combat piloting styles - namely brawling, scram-kiting, kiting and anti-kite.  It is probably strongest as a scram-kite, but all of the flavours are commonly found in faction warfare.
---
Don’t worry, these terms will be alien to you now, but they essentially relate to the range you fight your opponent at, that gives you the best chance of victory (based on the range of your weapons anhelpd utilities). Simply, you are looking to put yourself at a range where your weapons will do the most damage, ideally whilst avoiding (or minimising) your opponents. This is a complex area, but it is the backbone of PvP in EVE and the Tristan will allow you to experience all of this.
---
It probably is a longer skill train than the others, as you will need to skill up drones. But hey, you’ll then have drone skills built up which will be useful for so many other ships in the game. It’s also not the strongest ship at any of the given roles, but still perfectly viable and the element of unknown will win you fights. I have killed plenty of destroyers solo in these.
---
Also, yes, Faction Warfare is the best arena to start in. Joining a corp is good to get advice and enjoy the social side, but I wouldn’t recommend signing up and just flying in their blob if you want to get good - solo encounters are the way you will really start to hone your piloting skills. A mix of both is ideal.
---
Good luck!
---
It can kite quite well and if you bait correctly you should win within 10 volley vs a frigate
---
I believe even if it’s unallocated it still is added to your overall pool for sp
---
but still...if you do them all at once at 1000 SP
---
surely youd get maximum for the first injections
---
Tldr?
---
&gt;  People who rats checks the ticks.
---
Bots don't :O
---
that's a great point. i'm glad you agree removing local and automated intelligence tools that protect botters and ratters in general is great.
---
No because it will still calculate as you pass each threshold. So as soon as you have over 5m it’s going to knock you down even if it’s done all at once it’s reading it ahead of time depending on how many you click on to inject at 1 time.
---
Sound advice, ships are indeed ammo!
---
Haha I missed this somehow, nice!
---
lol disrespect. ...
---
If you can wait until next year to do it then you will only need 15, due to all the free sp CCP will have handed out to try and keep login numbers high.
---
Terrible.
---
He doesn't need to see you. If he lands 500km from a busy anom and you're not there, he'll know it was you.
---
Look, at some point you're gonna get pvp'd. It just is going to happen. You're going to get your hauler ganked or something. If that really is a deal breaker, I'd say just move on; there are other games with better pve, both mechanically and in terms of achievement.  
---
BUT, I'd make the case for you to at least give pvp a try. I wasn't ever much of a pvp person either until eve. It's pretty dope and you'll be hard pressed to find a better feeling in a game than your first kill in eve. 
---
But hey I also hear the new Final Fantasy xpac is pretty good.
---
Why would bots rat in a standing fleet ?
---
I mean we had a 90% tidi fight over a fortizar against test/goons. One hour later we were bashing highsec structures together lmao
---
10/10 for effort
---
Thanks for explaining with your small wall of text.
---
dank leaks :)
---
Well and those small groups should be team #3, they were trying to catch people jumping gates to join the fight and stuff like that
---
I wish Eve looked more like this and less like [this](https://i.imgur.com/rVyuYvw.png)
---
You never have to engage in consensual PvP, there's tonnes of PvE content that is quite fun. Sec missions, combat sites, incursions, invasions, just to name some. However, there will be times where you cannot avoid PvP. If someone is intent on finding a suicide gank target in high-sec and you look blingy, you're probably gonna get locked and engaged unless you pre-empt this behaviour and act accordingly. Not to mention if you want the most rewarding PvE content, you have to go to null/wormholes where you can be killed by anyone.
---
That said, the threat of PvP action I think makes PvE more fun. I'd be so bored of exploring WHs to grind iskies if it weren't for having to spam d-scan and keep on the intel channel, the danger makes it more fun. I also like responding to threats and possibly getting some PvP content, but I know it's not for everyone.
---
So for sure you can avoid instigating PvP and still enjoy Eve, but if you think that being shot at by humans is a deal-breaker then I'm afraid Eve is not the game for you.
---
A small step for you.
---
A big leap for the game.
---
well they just introduced a blackout, which killed 90% of pve players. good luck
---
&gt;"No, you psychic vampire of nullsec," Hilmar growled. "Human Rights."

fucking 10/10

If someone has an opinion you don’t like label it as tears and post about it on reddit. Profit.
---
We have these on screens in the office :D
---
I’m not into PvP myself either. I’m really not interested in being farmed by people with more time, money, and skill. While EvE is primarily a PvP game there are many avenues of PvE that can soak up a whole lot of time.
---
I have come to enjoy running my missions, industry, planetary interactions, mining etc. while keeping an eye out for someone wanting to deprive me of my goods. It’s a satisfying feeling denying an attempted gank on my mining barge. :-)
---
Change is on SiSi, not Tranquility
---
Pretty easy but then by extension once the bot gets banned every single person in that channel who is responding to save bots is complicit in botting and they can all eat the Banhammer.
---
FAKE NEWS
---
plenty of things to do even if you dont want to shoot other players. market trading/ industry/ mining/ exploration/ missions/ incursions/ ratting/ etc.
---

---
The problems is that due to injector, rorqual and infinite anom there is a disbalance of isk in the game, super and rorquals are injecting way to much isk in the economy which lead to an unbalance and unheathly game. So to turn it again a heathier game nerfing cap/super ratting and rorqual mining (which is so easy to multibox) is necessary. 
---
When I first come to eve people were telling it's a high risk high reward game well when you are super ratting (and I did) or rorqual mining under an umbrella it's the safest and the most reliable way to make isk if you are able to look at intel channel, fit a cyno, look for inhib and a non shitty fit.
---
What are your ideas to improve the game ? (No troll real question here)
---
I hope you don't have fat fingers.
---
Speak for yourself, here's an Alpha who uses drones for PVP.
---
Well when capital are proliferating way too much and are injecting ton of isk into the game it's normal to try to rebalance the game ? 
---
Or do you prefer a stagnate game?
---
Eve PvE is pretty terrible
---
If they implement such a change is not that hard to close that kind of loopholes.
---
\-ZE EEEEND- #voiceofendofworld

ftfty
---
imagine unironically believing this
---
&gt;This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything useful to the discussion.
---
You can subcap ratting, you have to go to wh space, ratting fleet can be very efficient.
---
Or you cab do ded escakation.
---
Also for a 4m player that's normal to not be able to fly a carrier, a dedicated alt is like 8m if I remember correctly with poor skill and around 6 months of training, a lot of null player have an alt dedicated to it.
---
To keep up appearances?

Alphas provide content, alphas consume content. Alphas are so handicapped in industry and trading that those will always remain paying player domains.
---
You should *want* alphas, unless y'know you're scared of them being able to go omega via plex... cause clearly that's the sort of thing that should be restricted to elite incursion runners, nullsec missioners, krabholers and null carrier pilots - who incidentally aren't paying to play the game either, just doing the same shit that's complained about with alphas, driving the plex market.
---
Doesnt actually work this way, strangely enough. Unallocated SP doesnt count for the purposes of determining SP gain from injectors.
---
Maybe 90% of people AFKing VNIs, I think the people blitzing missions, incursions, and the invasion are doing just fine.
---
Oh, also, none of this changed how I or my corp does WH combat anoms, because we've dealt with no local as the standard.
---
Yeah you unsubbing those accounts are bad for ccp but good for the game and being in test should let you with a big super umbrealla ready to come help your 20/30 accounts.
---
Yeah the game becames more dangerous but it sjould be high risk high reward right not (extremely)low risk high reward
---
Who are you and what have you done with the real Havish
---
Well some of the clothes are harder to find then razor :P
---
&gt; All in order to build my skill up at a faster rate in an attempt to join an average powered or powerful clan, guild, corporation and partake in full scale war against others
---
You don't actually need to build up a lot of skill to join the most "powerful" alliances.
---
Alliances used to be more elitist in the beginning, but around 2013-2014 there was a big shift in mindsets. In large scale fleet combat, the individual's skill doesn't really matter. Having one more pilot in a ship, regardless of how bad of a player, regardless of how bad the ship, is always better than *not* having one more pilot.
---
The alliances who embraced that mentality and started recruiting and helping out new players on a large scale are now the most successful ones.
---
You won't have any issue joining a powerful nullsec bloc almost right away if that's your chosen path.
---
Event? You mean fixing droping population? Its not working.
---
ZKillboard works on Player-provided api-keys. So if neither you nor your ganker (or their corp) provides an api key to zkillboard, it will not see the kill.
---
zkill only adds killmails that someone post by hand or from pilots that have api setup on the site
---
to post the kill yourself press the small bars top left then "copy external mail"
---
then go to zkill and press "post" in the top row
---
I'd like WH to be truly dangerous.  That is to say, the WH that appear are unscannable from inside the hole.
---
And you are posting the same comment over and over, say some idea to improve the game instead

Suprisingly, I could read that as a Norwegian.

As long you are semi Afk it's fine they start a convo and bump you at first to check if you are Afk then they ask for ransom. I don't think they will suicide ventures, but a procure is a potential target, I would recommend a buffer shield plus invulnerability you only need to live till concord warps in maybe put some attack drones on your ship to get on the kill mail

Is this still valid and does it still contain the best resource websites out there? Is there perhaps a more up to date list? I know it's only a little over 2 years old but some links don't work anymore.

Go to the top left, right click, copy, go to zkill, post, paste.

If we could remove the dscan sound that would be great, also I don't understand why it's manual. "Space radars" should be able to run all the time, maybe adding a mechanic that make you easier to combat scan if you use the automatic mode or when you are spamming the manual mode
---
Also mass limitation, no cyno, no infinite anom arr quite big differences
---
It's hardly a narrative, it's an empirical fact that the population is dropping: https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
Something that is (outside CCP at least) more speculation, but likely true, is that even at its current rate, a lot of it was propped up by significant numbers of multiboxers, especially after injectors were introduced.
---
I thought they deserved a little praise. Since black out I've actually been krabbing. Those skillpoints just got me two new hunters ready.
---
Well eve should be dangerous, lack of asset safety reward the attacker, push the defender to defend and other people to come.
---
I guess that all the ks that died undefended would have been a different story with no asset safety

I'm more talking about the narrative that this means that EVE is dying for the millionth time.       
---
The loss in players does not in practice translate into a loss of content, and it's content that makes the game healthy.
---
Oh dear, does that mean Morgan Freeman is constantly losing?
---
And probably the number of active accounts per real player has decreased.
---
If a big part of "active player" that left were multiboxing ones it's much less dramatic
---
Well WE FORM V0LTA did everything to bring that on them, except there are lot of enities missing.
---
Although everyone hates you, doesn't mean the others planed to hit you together, it just means you made every an enemy. (Sort-like)

Yeap.

There is no way to grind your SP up. It just naturally occurs. You can buy injectors but that’s a lot of money.

Isn't this enough of an incentive?
---
Make it restore local in the region it's built in and one will probably be constructed within a week.
---
As someone that recently bought a Bus off the back of making my mining alts raisins I too.like free SP.
---
True, But don't you think the insane cost should provide something better than what it currently provides?
---
The point of building it is nothing other than being first to build it and for the rest of the game (everyone will presumably join together to destroy it), to be the first to destroy one.
---
I mean it would be marvelously entertaining if, say, Goons did it and fought to the bitter end to defend it.
---
So, the last time I played EvE, I joined a small group in Provi. Based on my recollection of their play pattern and risk adverse attitude, I bet at least half of them are no longer logging in or have quit the game. This is a huge problem, and not just a minor detail. You rarely see a gaming company implement changes like this, that instantly alienates parts of their player base. 
---
Many of them relied on some income from VNI ratting and/or mining, and every penny / ISK they lost in PvP came from those activities. 
---
No, I don't care if you think that they are playing the game in the "wrong" way, so "good riddance".  Every player in this game, even he/her wants to - or not provides content in some way. 
---
The player base is too small, and the recruitment of new players is too low for this to not affect the game negatively, long term.
---
Yeah you are right, i would like to push people to defend structure but at the same time not let big groups to farm smaller ones continuously
---
Now wouldn't that be the ultimate troll from CCP? :d
---
isnt what you are doing here also explaining?
---
Of course it's a high priority reward.
---
Doesn't mean it's a good idea to dish them out like candy at Halloween, though.
---
As if anyone would oppose goons even if they did that...
---
It is my legit serious hope some wh group makes a bonkers deep safe and anchors one in secret in like a c2 or some shit so the second one gets the 1 per universe error message after getting all the mats together.
---
No, because 500 regular keeps are a far more vulgar display of power
---
Haha that would be amazing.
---
lol, I don't know if it's funny or pathetic. Maybe both. :P
---
So much generalization in this article. He talks about how all this hatred between blocs fuels conflict and endless wars. All I see from that point of view is arranged fighting and defense of sov. Author also mentions the fact that nullsec orgs tend to play the long game instead of instant gratification. Even if that's true for nullsec peeps living in nullsec it doesn't apply to everyone who utilizes nullsec as a place to find content. Just because you hold sov in nullsec doesn't mean you can dictate the mechanics of it. In my opinion that's where the disconnect occurs.
---
At least some people might train PI and make passive income and therefore be able to do more PvP.
---
I hate CCP for making this possible
---
&gt; What to do with free SP? 
---
Whatever you want to do. If nothing comes to mind, just keep them in the redeem system until they expire. Then apply whenever you want to speed up something.
---
I recently spent all the free SP I have accumulated from the removal of learning skills and other giveaways on triglavian ships for example.

What, TAPI, Frat, PL, NC and everyone inbetween v Goons?  Of course they would.

---
Since the ganker dies to NPCs he would be the only one with a copy of his kill mail. It would therefore be up to him or his corp to provide zkill access to it.
---
Gankers routinely don't provide that access and post what they kill manually so that their killboards only show kills, not losses.
---
No.  I'm doing doing that bullshit either.
---
Also fleet commander can see where you are
---
I waited 15 years to install Eve for similar reasons. Last June there was an ad for Solo PvE! and welp. Did stuff, joined Goons in a low participation corp and got to it. It was less than 4 months before pvp was more fun than krabbing. I still like the PvE regardless of what anyone says about it being trash, but small gang roams and gate camps with chill dudes on comms beats the shit out of any solo experience this game has to offer.
---
Dive in, learn to earn. Then spend that isk on the dumbest shit that makes you laugh. Brawl a bit with cheap shit you don't care about. The important thing is though, don't forget to make some friends along the way.

Or we could do away with attributes so we don't have to be stuck on an awful remap to train those skills at a reasonable rate.

So I read a few paragraphs, got bored and just scrolled a bit and randomly stopped at the titans section. I already knew this a dumb article written by a clueless propaganda dude at the cats and squirrels story, but... Is this man seriously saying that battleships are no longer being used by navies because they're expensive? Yeah, let's ignore that modern weapons technology has made massive leaps, where defensive tech ala armour hit a brick wall last century making slow fortified ships obsolete. If this guy thinks getting the first result from google and pasting it makes for a satisfying analysis, he most certainly can't predict the effects of the blackout on the game.

I saw DeaDraah at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
---
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
---
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
---
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

I'm still in shock! Anyone else had similar experiences?

I don't know if I could handle an entire book of Eve shitposts but now I want to find out

That is how bots "function" without local. The fallback mechanism of "warp when hostile on grid/in overview" warps of the bot farm, script checks local and sees system clear, warps back to Anom after set timer. On landing hostile decloakes, tackles next bot ship, rest warps off because of fallback mechanism ... https://zkillboard.com/related/30000818/201907170400/
---
"a bit".
---
It is not A BIT
---
Actually, PVE in Eve can be a lot of fun if you bother to keep it interesting and switch between activities.
---
  After you build up reputation with factions/agents, you can run lvl 4 missions in hi-sec, which lead to running burner missions, which can be quite profitable.  When that becomes boring, you can switch to running combat anomalies and then get escalations, which are like continuing the same site/objective in other systems.  When that becomes boring you can switch to ratting in low sec.
---
  You will also want to find trustworthy friends in eve, which is actually very hard.  Other than my real-life friends, I only know 3 players that I completely trust.  Being able to fight/mission/run with others raises the fun level tremendously.
---
Eve can stay interesting indefinitely for a primarily PVE-focused player in a good corp.  Often, it's even more consistently fun than PVP, since PVE players have access to regularly available content.  PVP often requires roaming around and hoping to find someone weaker to kill.  It's very randomly engaging.
---
Well this one did for sure XD https://zkillboard.com/related/30000818/201907170400/

---
What you say is correct, however that's not what the OP said, which is that the population is dropping, which is factually true.
---
For what it's worth, we have seen CCP be very, very cautious about any major gameplay changes in the past. That they dropped the hammer with blackout, knowing it would shake things up, suggests that they as a company were concerned with the status-quo.
---
That's not making a personal judgement on if EVE is dying or not. Only that there is evidence to suggest concern at the highest levels of the company.
---
Wouldn't that be epic, to be in space and listen to Eve Online? Such a nerdy thing to do, but the music is perfectly created for a voyage into the universe.
---
I'm also too lazy for it.
---
squad lead and wing com too, but not precicely, just what ship and solar system...
---
unless fleet comp got a recent buff?
---
Yes! FTL! I did a video about that game as well. It's much more minimalist by design, but still an effective soundtrack.
---
*starts saving ISK* ... one day .... one day ...
---
I guess the game should be completely silent as it's in space. You're right.
---
&gt;  it's a PVP game 
---
No it's not. It's a sandbox MMO. I hear this argument all the time and it's getting a bit annoying. Just because a lot of people find PvP the most exciting in this game doesn't mean it's a PvP game. Battlefield is a PvP game. Counterstrike is a PvP game. Leage of Legends is a PvP game. Eve is not.
---
Eve isn't designed for people just to shoot at eachother because if it were, you would respawn after getting killed in a new ship designed for PvP.
---
Eve is a sandbox in that you can do what you want. Say you want to build something. You don't want to build just a tiny house, no you want to build a large castle but you fret that it will be too much work for just one person so you find a friend to build it with.  
---
When you're almost finished three other boys show up. They are nasty boys who just want to destroy things. You try to stop them but they destroy your castle and then leave. You and your friend are sad that your castle got destroyed but you start to rebuild it.  
---
Two other people show up and wants to build things too. You greet them and ask them if they'd like to build something together. You tell them about the nasty boys and your new friends agree. Those boys are very nasty. They say they actually want to build a town, not just a castle but the town can have a castle and lets build it. You are inspired by their enthusiasm and decided that it sounds fun and all four of you start working.  
---
After a while the nasty boys show up again because they are bored and remebered how fun it was to smash your castle. This time however you are four against three and manage to protect your castle and send those nasty boys running.
---
I might've gone a bit too far with the analogy but I got caught up in it. It isn't a perfect Analogy but close enough.
---
Eve is a game of spaceships. On those spaceships you can place guns or you can place mining lasers. It's up to you. For every ship that is destroyed someone must've build it. The game is filled with both builders and destroyers. Some are just destroyers and some are just builders but there are also some people who are both.
---
Eve shouldn't cater only to PvP players because without miners, haulers, inventors and builders this game would suck. This game should not be designed so you and a handful of friends can easily waltz into a large alliance territory and get kills. It should be hard because you are going up against an organization with policies designed to stop people like you. Blobbing has proved to be effective so that will ofc be used.
---
I personally like the blackout but if the point is to remove free intel then all free intel needs to be removed. Why should I (as a member of the Imperium) be able to see where Horde is ratting? Why should I be able to see who holds sov in a specific system when I'm half the galaxy away? If some small group is trying to establish themselves in a remote region that none uses they should be able to do that without me being able to see it. If free intel is a problem then it needs to be removed for everyone. Hunter and ratter alike.
---
**TLDR: Eve isn't a PvP game. It's a sandbox MMO.**
---
That is about as wrong as wrong gets.
---
Remap for isk or Plex tbh
---
They are "forcing" you to login how?
---
It's the classic bait and switch tactic. I used to play a game called Rift (from former Trion Worlds) that pulled the bait and switch tactic on it's player base constantly.
---
They would release things to the player base for free, only to then later down the line bait and switch us and put those said things behind a paywall.
---
This is essentially what CCP is doing here. Giving Alphas all this stuff for free, then later down the line locking it behind a paywall.
---
I feel like this is only the start of it and I fear there will be a lot more coming down the line.
---
Though I think this may not be fully CCP's fault and more the fault of Pearl Abyss forcing CCP's hand into doing this.
---
CCP before Pearl Abyss = Gives Alpha clones things to do.
---
CCP after Pearl Abyss = Starts putting some of things for Alpha clones to do behind a paywall.

AdBlock Plus run a whitelist of websites with "Acceptable ads" that is enabled by default, but can be disabled. (Reddit is on this list)
---
Being whitelisted is free but they have some criteria on what's accepted. (I believe limited tracking + limited size. IE, on top banner and sir banner, can't be mid content etc)
---
They did talk about some form of monetization, but unsure of how that ended up. 
---
*In general* their policy of "Not all ads are bad ads" isn't that horrible, but telling the good from the bad can be tough in some cases.

Any tips on how to be stealthy? I'm trying to do wormholes  with a small ship to do exploration.  
---
I got omega for now so I got a cloaking device.
---
I guess what I need to know is how hunters go on and find their targets. I'm not sure when I appear on their scanners exactly. Like for example that one second between coming out from warp and going in cloak. And if their combat probes always show up on my scanner and do they really need their probes?  
---
And am I always safe while being cloaked? Can I for example literally sit cloaked 2km away from a wormhole and never be spotted?
---
Hey thanks. I'll give the cheap one a try, and splash out once I suck less.
---
after 5 years of suggestions, most op cruiser who had 700dps on 60-100km coming for nerf. Congrats CCP you are so fast.

I agree. CCP probably did the skills thing as a form of preemptive damage control

did they changed that you dont get half of the ticks if you are cloaked?
---
It’s okay.  My wife calls eve the other woman in my life.
---
Eve PVP is a bit like PVE in other games. We are each others content, but it's not as hostile as you might expect:
---
In eve you accumulate in game currency and skills and have fun.  That's all that matters.  Your ships are consumables. We aren't talking about a game where you farm NPC's to get super rare items. The vast majority of the ships you fly and the things fitted to them come from a chain of other players and can be bought easily on the open market. 
---
 You make money, your ship eventually explodes, you laugh and get another one out of your hanger.  It's a totally different mindset to other games. If you chose to PVE you will eventually come into contact with PVP, even if it's just someone sacrificing a ship to get the stuff in your ship. 
---
But try it. I suggest you roll a char and treat yourself to a paid account via the Meteor Pack and Starter pack which should set you back about 15 pound / dollars. You will get a million skill points from the starter pack, and 110 plex to sell in game from the meteor pack as well as full omega status meaning you train skills quickly. I would then apply to one of the bigger newbie friendly null blocks, (Horde, Brave Newbies, Goons), and just dive in. Make sure you get involved in the groups discord, voice coms and forums. Eve has a steep learning curve and your first few days are important. 
---
And then just get out and have fun making other people explode.
---
wtf no it dont mean your lying, it means that if you have to start going into details and  justify/defend/debate the odds just are that the other person aint gonna be pursuaded, it has nothing to do about what your saying being wrong, it has everything to do with how the human nature is, the fact of the matter is that if you try to change other peoples minds by using facts to dismantle their argument there is actually a lower chance of them changing their mind than if you dident talk to them at all.   
---
that being said i havent read the article, but you sir need to ither educate yourself or stop lying.

It's better when you let him know and say this is for your protection.

&gt; "All of those changes," Fozzie responded with disgust, "are good. And popular. I hate both of those things,
---
&gt; nullsec was dangerous and interesting, like wormhole space if anyone lived in it
---
I chuckled ...
---
Absolutely, as long as you weren't previously in MCAV
---
Would an ex-goon actually be better than that?
---
No change can happen without a compromise. Perhaps no local is better for the game, but in its current iteration its very low risk for the attacker but high risk for the defender. A compromise must be made to allow the counter of things that right now have no counter. NS wont be happy, but neither will the other side. When we reach that point where both sides are grumbling and moaning, then atleast its a change that perhaps still fks NS but atleast not without counters. Then atleast it wont be mostly the attackers advantage.
---
Ye, they could honestly be going for something totally different than we are expecting. I really do hope so, because right now theyve basically greenlit all of NS. If they did this without a good reason, well... There will be consequenses no matter what. NS was perhaps already mad about the drifters but this change only ensured that most people will back a boycott against the rest of the game. How harsh that boycott will be depends on CCPs further actions.
---
I dont personally like it, but the die is cast.

ooh, interesting bits!

I kinda do agree with the "not all ads are bad" but I also agree that their management would be a nightmare.

That is the thing. Goons are usually the ones on here laughing at whatever idiot that thinks building one is a good idea.
---
Dscan immunity for Blops
---
That's interesting. I'm constantly hearing stories from nullseccers that SRP's so good they actually make money on ships they lose, yet everyone also seems to have to constantly mine and rat to afford new ships. Personally my PvP is almost self-sustaining. It definitely was back in lowsec but when you're flying with others thats a bit more difficult and I don't want to be the guy that insists on getting his cut from the loot. So usually a plex will last me for a couple of months. Other than that I sometimes go do pve in lowsec in bait ships so it doesn't get too boring and pvp is always just around the corner. That being said, all my isk usually goes right into new ships and pretty often i look at my wallet and there's like 600'000 - 900'000 ISK in it.
---
Considering non-consensual PVP is only allowed in like one system on sisi, ganking anyone on there can get you banned from the test server.
---
A lot of hunters won't need combat probes to get you, what usually happens is they will see your probes on dscan, then, they will scan down anomalies themselves, or, they will have already scanned them down, sit in cloak, and just wait for you to start doing them.
---
Remember also, split weapons also means split weapon upgrades, or only upgrading one half.

Nope!

&gt;I guess what I need to know is how hunters go on and find their targets.
---
Usually it's one of two ways - d-scan, and combat probes. D-scan is undetectable, so you can never know if someone is picking you up on their D or not. The downside is that it only works if you are next to something they can warp to, like a planet or a wormhole they scanned down previously. The counter to this is staying in a safe spot (warp somewhere, Ctrl+B to leave a bookmark mid-way, then warp back to the bookmark). 
---
The other way is probes - they can use core scanner probes (same as yours), to find the exploration site/wormhole you're currently on, and warp there, or they can use combat probes to scan down your ship itself, at which point they can warp directly to you, even if you're in a safe. Both types of probes can be seen on d-scan, and they will need to be closer to you than 2AU to pick you up, so make sure you have those added. 
---
The nastiest way of finding you is a combination of the two - with intelligent use of d-scan, they can narrow down your location to a 0.5AU wide sphere, then just cycle their probes once to get you. That way, you only see their probes for like 10 seconds at most, then they're gone and there's a cloaked stratios in warp to you.
---
&gt;I'm not sure when I appear on their scanners exactly. Like for example that one second between coming out from warp and going in cloak.
---
You appear as long as you're decloaked. Both probes and d-scan has to be activated manually to work, but most wormholers run their d-scan all the time. The d-scan range is 14.3AU, and probes can pick you up anywhere in system. Usually people don't drop probes unless they see something on d-scan. Note that your probes appear on d-scan as well, so if you're trying to hide, make sure to get those out of the way (just move them like 20AU above the system and cycle once, or scoop them). If you are using a prorotype or improved cloak, you are visible even during warp, not just when exiting warp. However, if you cloak immediately and you didn't warp to something obvious, it'll be very hard to get your location in that short window of time.
---
You are also visible after jumping through a wormhole/gate and before activating your own cloak.
---
&gt;And if their combat probes always show up on my scanner
---
As long as your d-scan is set up to pick up probes (it should be), they will always appear on it. Remember that they have to be fairly close to you to get a read on your frigate, but it pays to pick them up even when they're far away as it will give you more of a heads-up that someone is in your system.
---
&gt;And am I always safe while being cloaked? 
---
Yes and no. As long as you don't get decloaked, you can't be scanned down, d-scanned or otherwise interacted with in any way. However, sitting 2km off a wormhole is a great way to get decloaked by accident by someone jumping through that same wormhole. Since you have the luxury of a cloak, I would just get a safe spot like I described above, and sit in there. Sitting cloaked in a safe is pretty much as safe as you can get.
---
Finally, keep in mind a few cloaking-related caveats:
---
1. Your ship doesn't cloak immediately. After hitting the button, you are immediately no longer lockable and probes can't find you, but you will appear on d-scan and grid for 5 seconds before vanishing. 
---
2. You cannot cloak if you are being targeted, so if someone managed to lock you, you can't rely on your cloak unless you manage to warp away somehow, or break their lock (for example, with ECM drones).
---
I hope that helps, enjoy wormhole diving!
---
So where do you see the problem if one omega account would unlock endless omega accounts? 
---
CCP possibly losing monetization? That would be compensated by the new paid Delta account.
---
Keep in mind that players with multiple omega accounts are only a niche part of Eve's player base, probably less than 5% or so. 
---
The endless omega accounts being "abused"? Again, only a very niche part of the total Eve player base is willing to actively sustain multiple accounts. Multi-omega account economic activities like skill farming and mining have been there for a while now. It's for the hardcore-only, not the average Eve player.
---
And omegas having free access to multiboxing, multi accounts and multi-character progression would actually get rid of all these monetization services. Omegas would only profit from it. New players however, would be far more likely to one-off pay for the game, then they are willing to take a subscription.
---
Hull pen did it..
---
Wormholer, btw.
---
I think CCP is doing this to compensate for all the people doing a "boicot" or not playing because they are afraid of no local or haven't adapted yet; but the blackout will last longer than that so there will be good numbers go get a clear picture... I guess CCP wants to compensate for the initial panic until people gets used to it and things go back as usual but without local.
---
I spent an hour yesterday ratting with an Ishtar and nothing actually happened... blackout works both ways vOv
---
None, a mining permit is your only reliable protection from ganks.
---
Hey there,
---
Totally understand your angle !!!
---
My recommendation: Join the Discord of Malevelon Roe; they’re a robust PvE corp with great experience of all PvE types across the board. They also dabble in PvP when required.
---
Chat on their discord and get a feel, hang out with them they’re really friendly. It’s run by some community streamers. 
---
https://discord.gg/spv5X2F
---
Let me know if you have any questions, I can e-introduce if you prefer.
---
Good luck.
---
Absolutely. 
---
*Because someone might take this seriously, obviously every player, no matter what corp, is judged on their own merits. Corp history doesn't matter, how much of a dick you are does*
---
I actually encourage people to take their time, be patient, and check out their other options thoroughly before deciding on a Corp. I'd rather let a random dude chill in our discord for a week so he can see if he actually likes us, than take someone in and see them quietly leave a few days later.  It's important that you've got compatible vibes with people. Got that and everything else can fall into place most of the time because you'll work together.
---
I wasn't giving an opinion, just stating a fact. I guess CCP didn't enforece that rule enough? Not really sure what you want me to say.
---
You essentially want local on descan. Scared you’ll get jumped?
---
Cold iron as others have mentioned. Also the Serpentis skins.
---
Are you talking about the bubble that he landed in and stopped him 50km from the other dreads? Or was it your pro damp piloting, and constant whinning to leave grid the whole time that didnt let him land where intended?!?
---
Are you mad?
---
Misdirection.  They're secretly building one in 1dq.
---
Ever heard of countries not doing so well economically?
---
Exactly :) Best asnwer here!
---
Good luck proving that in any way, shape or form.  A person in the response channel has no way of knowing what's on the other side of that keyboard any more than you or I do. Short of them admitting to knowing its a bot in an in game channel there's no grounds for banning them.
---
Please this!
---
flawless?
---
You must not be new here.
---
On point. Best description of our dudes during the whole fight!! Carry on with thy great wisdom.
---
when did I say that?
---
It needs more more ammo ... to shoot only once.
---

---
I was casually moving around 500m in stuff from Jita to an undisclosed location when i got instalocked. In my initial shock, i didn't want away right away and had to cycle my burst jammer a second time and only after I disabled my safety. Apparently you cannot be green even if aggressed by someone else if you want to activate the burst jammer.
---
Ill prove it easy. Its not OUR game its theirs game, read EULA nothing in this game is yours.
---
People find money for cigarettes, they can find money for Internet spaceships.
---
log in numbers and concurrent player numbers should be two very easy to separate metrics. You can log in, grab the skill points and log back off in about 30 seconds it should be easy for CCP to sort those accounts out from the ones that log in and actually play unless they are trying to hide the real numbers.
---
No - he is saying that modern super sized aircraft carriers are incredibly expensive to maintain and that building them is the easy part. He goes on to say that this is not the case in eve - all you have to do is build a titan and it is forever available. If this were the case with modern navies IRL they would consist of nothing but these huge modern aircraft carriers. He goes on to say that the design of eve makes it so that more and more and more titans being built and fielded as complete fleets is inevitable.
---
You should really read an article before raging with your armchair-general hat on.
---
Or, normalise attributes, make every thing at the same speed.
---
They actually had more subcap dps than ships than we did.... if you take the time to actually look. 
---
In no way, in no world are nighthawks, claymores, and ab bassys a counter to sleips and scimis.
---
Regarding your point  about high level concern: it could be that not too long ago they were bought over by a large company who can absorb the drop in subscription money while CCP tries to revamp the game with the hopes of increasing player population
---
It does if you leave the null blocks.
---
Ctrl f9
---
Until your wife steals your Titan
---
The state of EVE for the past few years has been absolutely cancer. Uncontrolled stereotypes and casual racism put us on a course for an assured yet slow death long term.
---
A fuck ton of content but pvp will find you...
---
And usualy kill you
---
Also, that bug where if you activate your cloak too soon resets its cooldown made this all possible.
---
I don't know what being in a null block has to do with it. 
---
I haven't been in one for a while now. Not being zoomed out is a bad decision no matter the scale of the fight.
---
And not a single care was given.
---
No, this "faction" version is only to troll people.       
---
CCP initially assumed that there will be just few titans ingame due to immersive cost.         
---
TBH CCP didn't expect for sure Imperium having like 50 keepstars and getting ready to drop more.
---
Its not a pve or pvp ship, its a jumpgate that can cloak
---
And Nullification? Woah just imagine "haha you bubble camper ..." woooosssshhh battleship gets through ...  :D
---
What about this lowsec gate to Stain?      
---
Like if CCP cannot do something then Goons will do it "on yesterday" &lt;3
---
Misdirection. We're building two so we can have races
---
Great vid - top piloting keep it up deadwood
---
Not even preemptive, stats were down before this event
---
What would it take, do you think, for test to blue frat, pl and nc? A strong wind?
---
I asked for hats though. Where is summer of hats?
---
1. U are not the ship. U are an immortal, ships are consumables.
---
2. ISK don\`t matter, only the flow of it. Find a way, that is fun FOR u, to keep ISK flowing (play the game as U want, not how others tell u to, but try as many aspects as u can to find ur thing).
---
3. Rclick &gt; show info, google or ask in chats. Then read read read, as many guides as u can find ... google: for "eve compendium" (some are outdated but the basics are ok).
---
It'd have to be an optional refund (sounds fucky) or a limited time SP giveaway as not all alphas are always alphas (and may want those skills keeping).  But yes, its a kick in the tits if they don't do something about the SP.  I find the reduction to drone interfacing a bit over the top as that's going to impact a lot of other alpha ships probably unnecessarily.
---
Also if they check wallet logs to make sure you are a good PVE member you will pass that check :)
---
Do you really want Naz working with Stephen King? As if half the civilized world being afraid of clowns wasn't enough?
---
The state of EVE for the past few years has been absolutely cancer. Uncontrolled Citadel spam and casual Cap dropping in subcap fights put us on a course for an assured yet slow death long term.
---
Sell it? Use it? Contract it to a lucky member of this sub for the low, low price of 1 carbon? 
---
These are your options
---
That's boring.
---
In the last 6 months or so excav prices were dropping all on their own due to over production. And NPC kills are dropping in all of nullsec not just the bot hot spots.
---
First thought was - it's a squished vexor
---
It's not a bad idea either. Devalues skill injectors, SP farms take a hit, there aren't any downsides for most players.
---
You should post that on r/eveporn its better than most of the shots on there
---
I think he's referring to since the blackout.
---
And I think he's technically correct either way
---
&gt;The state of EVE for the past few years has been absolutely cancer. Uncontrolled homosexuality and unchecked proliferation of Weebs put us on a course for an assured yet slow death long term.
---
Just create an overview filter that shows only ships except capitals and you should be fine
---
The article contains a *lot* of bullshit.
---
Nothing is going to be a one stop shop to fix EVE, but this is a pretty large step.
---
The article eventually gets around to a decent main point, but all the supposed support it uses to get there is conjecture that's probably the opposite of what will happen.
---
excellent video deadraah! I am practicing with the wolf so that i can learn to kite as well you do
---
A palatine keepstar.
---
I like the blackout a lot, but let's not get carried away. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
---
Lowsec gate to Stain for the cost of a Palatine (ofc you need one on each end)
---
Only if you normalise them to below 26 across the board.
---
BLOPs in general are all kind of shit for solo hot dropping, mostly just because in the age of account spam it’s just more cost effective to drop in your own t3c or bomber gang.
---
The state of Grindr for the past few years has been absolutely cancer. Uncontrolled inflation and unchecked Chinese botting put us on a course for an assured yet slow death long term.
---
What, exactly, is interesting about half your skills taking longer to train?
---
Mining missions.
---
Sounds amazing, but I think it's asking a little too much.
---
The only bad thing then is if you have people who login to also APPLY those skillpoints to their queue, in which case would start skewing numbers even more
---
eMeRgEnT GaMePlAy
---
Holy fuck, Dave. 
---
If AFK farming was the issue they were trying to solve, why the fuck wouldn't they just do the one thing that would fix it? No goddamn shit, because they're not trying to solve AFK farming. Which is exactly why they have said, fucking repeatedly, that they're not trying to fix it. 
---
The time you've spent playing, combined with the time you spend here bitching, would be far better used to learn how to fucking read **THE** lines, instead of making the shit up between them.
---
Is there anyone Test hasn't blued at this point?
---
Dude have you seen High Sec its only been a week since the blackout started and its full of Trash null renter corps making life difficult for new pilots. If this goes on they will all leave the game and the problems in null will continue with falling numbers increasing. The renter guys don't own any structures so are safe from wardecs.
---
This is stupid.  You don't even have to log into a character to receive the free SP - the character select screen is as far as you need to go.
---
They can also tell how long you stayed logged in, and what you were doing while you were logged in.  If some nullbear logged in for 5 seconds to grab his free SP before logging out, that is something they can trivially filter around.
---
Better idea. Change the name to the Tuzy keepstar. It might be built if it were.
---
They should be fighting bots by getting the botting software, creating hashes/thumbprints of the executables, then monitoring clients for those programs, then banning people who use them. 
---
But like usual, CCP used a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel to perform brain surgery, and in the processes are pushing away a large chunk of players who aren't elitest pvpers but who are vital to Eve's survival. And they sure did a number on small alliances who don't have massive cap umbrellas and relied on good intel instead.
---
I agree, also the last login "event" was also to negate the effects of blackout.
---
I turn off combat music but during FW plexes the megaman music keeps coming on.
---
You don't need to keep them in redeem, keep them as unallocated SP.
---
&gt; Existing alpha clone characters with these skill levels trained will find them disabled while they remain in the alpha clone state, similarly to how other omega skill levels become disabled while a character is in the alpha clone state.
---
Curious to know whether alpha characters with Heavy Drone Operation IV (going to III), Medium Drone Operation V (going to IV), and Drone Interfacing IV (going to III) will get their SP back.
---
Because that's a hefty chunk of skill time I put in and if I'm expected to branch out and do other things, that SP would be super useful *and* would represent more SP than the current 7-day event.
---
I want D-scan improved, but not this. I just want it to be correct when you sort by distance. "-" is not closer than 1,000 KM. Sort by distance should, you know, SORT by DISTANCE, regardless of whether I can tell what the distance is or not.
---
I just finish up what I can with it
---
The skillpoints don't expire till next year you can sit on them for awhile before needing to use them.
---
Jump Fatigue worked.  TEST wouldn't have been able to build a super fleet without getting far, far away from NCPL.
---
It effectively prevented groups from being able to cross the galaxy with their supers to join an ongoing battle.
---
It required more planning and made space bigger for capitals.
---
It's a shame they caved to player demands for essentially "fast travel".
---
They scramble to get set back up.
---
Mirror CTA's lol
---
If you keep them in redeem, you can give them to any of the 3 characters on your account
---
I've done it and caught someone leeching and killed them. So, yes?
---
What about those Chinese from the other server who joined us recently? Theyre brand new and have yet to gain a reputation. Cant imagine they are already blue to test, right?
---
Looks like a fun brawl without caps
---
For such a super badass looking ship, it is pretty shitty. Give that Widow some love!
---
I love those "loki + solo blops" ppl :) in the time of blackout and no local, chances are so high they drop on me before checking what i fly :D
---
We'll have to wait and see. If you've just spent a few hundred mil on a company with a winning formula, chances are you're not going to want to wreck that formula.
---
Like you implied, a large company buying CCP means they can prop up their liquidity while they experiment with taking a failing or sub-optimal formula, and chopping it up and removing the failing portions, hopefully leaving it better (and more profitable) overall.
---
In this thread: “reeeee, I can’t watch Netflix and Rorq mine completely AFK while maybe getting an officer spawn”. 
---
I’m a Goon, for what it’s worth.
---
Mind control
---
I guess OP is one of those people who think nullblocks likes bots...
---
Bots fucks over everyone. Botting causes inflation and it makes ore mined less valuable. None benefits from having bots around.
---
SENT INTO BATTLE, CAME FROM THE SKY
---
Yeah bait is obviously still a thing, though it still puts the ball on their court so to speak. Baiting is now much more difficult as you have much less information available to help you set up.

Maybe to much. But avoid D-Scan could be nice. The Nestor should too.
---
Maybe a reason for cloaking V and special blops cloak for Blops only.

&gt;casual racism
---
China isn't a race. Also, part of a series on Serenity and why nobody plays on that server anymore. But go on, virtue signal harder.
---
&gt; join horde. i've been in it 3 years and only go on comms for ops i want to go on. standing comms are cancer anyway. don't have any friends in horde or anything, just play for my game. i literally said "fuck it" and did solo wh shit for a few months a year ago. when i got bored i could come back and do a fleet or two.
---
thats one of my biggest issues with big alliances and stuff... standing fleets/coms. i understand coms for ops and stuff but coms just for the sake of it? dont feel like it
---
But then how will they pay for that fancy new iPhone?
---
It get's even worse, some of the players apply those skillpoints, then actually *use* the ships they skilled and have fun playing the game.
---
When you have enough creativity and talent to become a successful author but use it on EVE shitposts instead lol
---
Not sure it's overproduction, there was the mining yield nerf along with the rorq nerfs that lowered demand a lot.
---
Let me clarify, my point is they added the drifters, had them in the game about a week and then introduced the blackout and now the login event.  They aren't giving any of the above a fair chance of working out the effect on the player base.  That's my point how can you get the effect of the drifters in a week?
---
How can you take the numbers from the blackout if you're running a daily login event.  CCP aren't giving themselves enough time to get the amount of data they need for these changes to decide whether they should be permeant.
---
To be fair it's a lot easier for both sides to take a fight when it's clear there won't be capitals involved.
---
This is propaganda.
---
It's easier to write here than the six horror and two scifi/fantasy stories that are stuck in my head and that I can't get down on paper lol
---
that's The Division. You've been activated.
---
Rustled krab detected.
---
I mean, if it's worth being black listed over. I'll fire up a stream and start warping. I don't have to catch you. It just has to say my destination is the same anom I am in, that's 100 % conclusive and enjoy being banned from the alliance with all characters tied to that one on auth.
---
Thanks, a lot of valuable information.
---
So in essence:
---
The few seconds between warping and wormholing and cloaking is not something I need to worry about other than it might reveal my presence in the area. 
---
I appear on dscan while warping and remain still on dscan during a few seconds while I cloak. Which means if someone is really looking out for me (which I suppose happens in Eve?) he might see the disance between me and him not move for a few seconds. Which means I'm there for sure cause. So this might be something to keep in mind? But then again he can't warp to me if it's a bookmarked place and using probes is impossible since I'm probably already cloaked.
---
See I'm trying to find those windows between travelling and cloaking and standing still which might be opportunities for hunters to locate someone. But it seems there just aren't that many if you constantly use cloak when standing still. Cause they can't locate your exact location without probes and before they can deploy the probes in your area (don't know how close they need to be) you're already cloaked. You're always a step ahead, right? So that's a good thing :)
---
I guess the weakest part of exploring is that hunters know where you're going (as suggested by Jaypact just below) and they can just sit there and wait and not much you can do about that?
---
Oh how propaganda do tell
---
We agree to disagree on this.
---
propaganda really how?
---
Thanks.
---
And there's nothing you can do about that I guess? Except try to warp away. But I got literally killed instantly. In fact I didn't know what was happening until I realised he also killed my capsule.
---
also nighthawk, ishkur, caracal navy, corax, the gallente interdictor, rook, etc.
---
Gib public link?
---
So you preferred hats in the feedback polls as well? 😛😛😛
---
The only requirements to get into playing EVE Online are having the right mindset (it‘s a harsh world without safe areas (only “safer“ areas) and very few rules regarding player interaction) and a willingness to read up on things, ask for advice and generally learn. 
---
Best to start out and learn as you‘re going along since the game is way to vast to really study all relevant information in advance. The things you need to read up on also vary heavily depending on your play style and role.
---
Join some newbie friendly corp and listen and learn. You‘ll be fine.
---
Welcome to EVE and see you in space!
---
Ahh, good to see i'm not the only one that likes playing sw music over eve :)
---
Reading a Naz post is like going into a gay bar but you roofied yourself first.
---
Not even memeing, those guys already announced that they plan to at least temp blue legacy
---
Was it recorded? Id love to hear.
---
if tapi could, they would have set them blue while they were still on serenity...
---
Hey hey leave ma Potato alone!!!!
---
Green nebula, below the asteroids, battle rock 1-4, and the HaZoR trailer beatdrop.
---
Yeah, because they totally haven't been spending their time trying to reduce anomaly income, and they definitely haven't already recently adjusted the vni have they?
---
I think it’s also important to put it into context with the market. MMOs in general are declining from their height. A declining player base is to be expected in many ways and doesn’t make EVE any different to its counterparts.
---
Huh
---
In before we see widows as scouts in all ns....
---
go to highsec thx bye
---
Blops arent bad for solo dropping. Its just that they're obscenely expensive, and not remotely cost efficient.
---
this event was planned long before the blackout was announced
---
This is actually a pretty much impossible way to solve the problem, only a way to raise the bar a little bit higher.
---
From CCP's point of view, the player computers are inherently untrustworthy, therefore every computation result is untrustworthy as well. Client monitoring does not work if you can't trust your client to do what you want it to do.
---
Debugging the anti-botting software, patching API calls or the checking software is not difficult. There are ways to make it harder and more painful to achieve, but ultimately they rely on results from an adversarial environment they don't control, so from a general information security standpoint, checking for file hashes or a set of signature or heuristic markers doesn't solve the problem.
---
can you fly a venture?
---
I havent been playing eve for a long time but GMVA was a great alliance and had multiple great corps that have been very active.  No idea if they are still around
---
all you have to do is be a good boy and go to the log in screen and redeem all your SP bud
---
Oh ffs I'm in one of these again... Have a grr upvote.
---
only 1 can be deployed in new eden at a time tho
---
CCP is saving the game one placebo at a time..
---
I mean the alliance in question could up their standing fleet defence game and patrol/defend their space to try and keep their ratters safe...?
---
Is that to much to ask of botters and afk rafters?
---
Do they really depend on the old broken meta that much?
---
*No, It's the children who are wrong.*
---
&gt; What would be the best way for me to gain the most SP from this event?
---
Just log in every day
---
&gt;he might see the disance between me and him not move for a few seconds.
---
Fortunately, unless they are on grid with you, their d-scan doesn't automatically tell them how far away you are. They can find that out by altering their d-scan range - for example, if you appear on d-scan at 12AU, but not on 10AU, then you are between 10 and 12AU away. They can also narrow down their cone to find out which direction you are. However, these things take considerable time, so they won't be able to get a good read during a short window like that. 
---
You are most vulnerable while you're doing an exploration site. You have to stay uncloaked in order to hack the cans, you're on top of a site that can be scanner with core probes and, worst of all, you're distracted by the hacking window so you might not pay attention to your d-scan. 
---
The other time you're vulnerable is jumping through wormholes. There might be a camp already there, in which case they don't need any fancy d-scan skills or combat probes to find you - you're coming to them. So they might decide to not even bother finding you, and instead just try to guess where you came from and wait for you to go back. It's probably more effort than people are willing to spend to find a T1 scanning frigate like yours, but it's possible.
---
If you get warped on while doing a site, not all is lost. Your ship aligns very quickly, so your first reaction is to warp somewhere. Your safe spot is the ideal choice, but you can just warp to a planet or moon to save precious seconds. You will probably have a short heads-up that someone is coming for you because you will either see them on d-scan (if it's something non-cloaky), or warping in (if they decloak in warp), or they will decloak next to you, in which case most ships take 6 seconds before they can start locking you, which is long enough for you to escape. 
---
&gt;there and wait and not much you can do about that?
---
Indeed, if someone predicts which site you will warp to, or if they scanned all the sites before you even got there, then they can be on top of you and there's not much you can do about it. But again, this is a lot of effort to find a T1 frigate.
---
I love how the heretic? Is that irrelevant that it's just the 'gallente interdictor'
---
Keep moving around the anom and he'll never decloak you.
---
sweet summer child, downtime could last hours in the old days
---
I’d rather drop a scram prospect in on a target and a kite t3c than a single blops. 
---
They’re too expensive for the utility you can gain out of 2 toons.
---
Havish you're only supposed to welp in game not on reddit, damn man :p
---
Green Nebula and Below the Asteroids are two of my favourites too.
---
unconsensual pvp my friend.
---
This is such an original comment.
---
Make sure you drag/drop the skills onto the correct character.
---
\&gt; and they set sail to London where the genetic memory of the last time a  group of Icelandic men landed on the shoreline compelled the population  to throw down their jewelry and flee in terror 
---
This is the best part of it all
---
They can make pretty decent isk on Low Sec.
---
i love your salt. it keeps me young.
---
Oh come on, they're just playing dirty tricks to keep people logging in during the nullsec blackout. Won't work on me ccp, already unsubbed my 2 accounts.
---
the real reason for price drop of elite drone ais are the potency boosters to mass grind them in missions...
---
but then they have to *gaaasps* RISK THEIR SHIP
---
Idk if you clicked on the link that I posed but I think we're talking about 2 different events..
---
He posted the picture of the event in which you have to kill NPCs to get a bonus amount of SP.   Not the login event.
---
Pbuh?
---
The Widow is still a very good ship, hell, it’s a very good BLOPs, 8 mids gives you an insane tank (only the Marshal gets a better tank, and only with good sec status) and the DPS is, if nothing else, decent. It could do with a small buff (change the RoF buff to 7.5%/level, this puts it on the same level as the Marshal, alternatively, swap it for a 10%/level damage boost, it has less DPS than a Marshal, but better per-reload damage on RHMLs, also maybe change the ECM bonus to a missile application bonus) but people calling it useless besides being a bridge bitch are making no sense...
---
you mean my army of alphas? oooh the horror
---
Get a fucking grip. Prejudice towards one group of people, is literally the definition of racism. If you had said  *'unchecked botting'* the would have been understandable but all you did was illegitimise you own post with your sperging.
---
this shows how the real question was " what will mitigate the blackout the most? "  i too answered skillpoints
---
They explain the real problems with EVE though, and I think they are right the the null blackout does little to address them.  CCP needs to make bigger changes.
---
Unless they have the align time to get away they will just die the other side of the gate lol.
---
good to hear, it came from my bath water btw
---
LP store and mineral prices are 100% player controlled
---
u/ccp_falcon would not be flat-spin kicked into a dry wall. He's way too short to be reached by whirring legs of anyone doing a hand-stand.
---
Other than that - great story bru XD
---
... the heretic is Amarr. Eris is Gallente
---
You would be surprised ... i don't wanna reveal all secrets :D but if you think a bit more into it ... baiting is much easier now ...
---
All you see is a ship ... you don't see the pilot ... now just put the ship into a situation you would assume it's clearly doing pve-things ... and wait for all the hunters that are out there ...
---
from time to time ceptors are coming, thats usually what i want to avoid, as ceptors most of the times indicate a fleet behind them, but a solo loki, proteus, tengu, legion ... well be my guest on attacking me ;) ... not to mention stratios's :D
---
Erm, you see the pilot dude. No one warps to a target without checking who the pilot is from the overview.
---
Let me guess ... and you can anchor only one ;)
---
Who let the Wombat out of his cage? 🤔😂
---
Good idea, while you can do it to their VNIs I guess they can do it to your ratting Supers.
---
There's still a lot a things to take care of , just to mention a few : 
---
\- Capital proliferation ;
---
\- Skill injectors that can be used without discretion ( there's should be a monthly limit on how many of  those you can use ) ;
---
\- Overpowered triglavian ships that overshadow the rest of subcapital ones ( it's like Apocrypha reloaded ) ;
---
\- Infinite resources ( CCP has tried to somewhat limit those , but imo, there should be a respawn timer longer that what we have now on them ) ;
---
\- Citadel proliferation ( seriously , make just one timer for those with a 24 h response time, that's why you are a nullsec powerblock with thousands of players ) ;
---
\- Way too generous bonuses in time reduction for building supercapitals on engineering complexes ;
---
\- Small and medium structures are too affordable to manufacture ;
---
\- HAW guns that are still ... ok . In the past we got rid of tracking titans for a reason ;
---
\- Fighters that still apply ok damage to subcapitals . As for NSA... well, now we got triple sebo carriers and supers... still cruiser lock time there, no big deal ;
---
\- Homogeneous distribution of resources in nullsec .
---
\- Etc.
---
CCP seems to be on the right track , but major issues still need to be tackled and I suppose we can only hope for the best.
---
The state of your posting for the past few years has been absolutely cancer. Uncontrolled stereotypes and casual racism put us on a course for an assured yet slow death long term
---
Don't asume someone is doing, what you do!

I think you start bad in the life if you need to hide stuff that you are doing to your wife.

Close to a holy place, gating through high sec, 1 day old. It is and always be my favorite track.

does shadowplay follow window focus?
---
Damn... I will be calling it the gallente dictor too from now on
---
wait mcav are dicks?
---
&gt; Keep in mind that players with multiple omega accounts are only a niche part of Eve's player base, probably less than 5% or so.                
---
Like no.      
---
All peoples that i know are running multiple accounts.           
---
Eve is designed in such way ... that honestly, you cannot play without at least 2 accounts.          
---
I read rest ... but before you give more suggestions play the game.             
---
It is clearly visible that you didn't play it, or played occasionally in higsec.
---
its literally the skilling spree thing its literally just free SP, the stuff its mentioning in your screenshot if the invasion stuff like the trig incursions
---
Tell me what is big group and what small?
---
That would be *reall*y evil. I like it!
---
Do not join test or any big blob.
---
Well ... there are more "sites" then anomalies ;)
---
lol thera cucks showing how shit they are when they arent hunting ratters, cant wait for us to bring the hammer and steamroll these script cheaters.
---
I'm a big fan of 10mn dragoons.
---
A neut is basically a delayed web.
---
And it's got an even phatter ass than OPs mum
---
Cco fanfiction is the best
---
I know you only see black or white, but no, i just want to see if the ship in space is friendly or foe, and that can do radars on earth as well.
---
And another differenc is, local gave info instant and automatic and system wide, dscan would only show in the radius of 14 AU what ship and ticker - and most importently only if i use it.
---
Bot's would have to use a keystroke every X sec. broadcasted and then CCP would get boter easier to ban like iskboxer.
---
Fair mix up to make, I also had to look the names up lmao. I have also never seen either in space.
---
It’s not very common that blops hunters bother with hitting people in DED sites, namely because anyone with half a brain running them can see you coming in.
---
go to an eve meet for the physical stuff?
---
Obvious bait is obvious. I can't see any sperging, pointless reeeeee posts apart from yours, hell there'd barely been any comments before you posted this comment. Most of the other commenters are giving legitimate rational points. Try again nerd.
---
I think only if you multibox on one screen. Which I do.
---
sry you don't get it, i just want to know, if the ship on dscan is from my corp/ally.
---
Not scared of getting jumped cause a) umbrella, b) space rich, c) lived in wspace for years.
---
Wait the widow is used for 10/10s really? 
---
I didnt know that.
---
Holy christ the goon salt in here is real
---
There's plenty to do without actively PvPing.  However, you must learn and understand how to avoid being PvPed (aka ganked).  So you're version of PvP becomes avoiding PvPers.  Learn what and where ganking happens in High Sec and don't do that.  Learn how to move through Low Sec, Null Sec, and Wormholes without getting ganked.   Don't carry 1 billion ISK of cargo through Uedema in a T1 indy.  Don't mine in a busy system in a Hulk.  Don't blindly jump into Low Sec without a shield tank and a bunch of Warp Core Stabs in your lows (assuming you are passing through). There are many lessons to learn.
---
You will lose ships as you learn, but it gets less frequent the more you learn.  Eventually it can become very rare.  This actually makes the PvE more exciting and makes the payoff feel that much better.   
---
Eventually you may see someone doing it very poorly and you will gank them because you can.
---
Yeah this is basically what I’m getting at.
---
Happy Friday, folks.

First week back in the gym since my medical procedure. Felt good to be back.

---
A disgusting display of unity.
---
As if people had time to actually read the post before being assholes.
---
Warping between ticks doesn't stop the value that flashes on the screen being half and that is very noticeable for battleship kills.
---
I know those feels! 
---
Physio gave me the go-ahead to start weights again. Only isometrics so far, but it's great being able to do something apart from cardio.
---
Don't need to decloak. Just need your exit point for warp to be the same anomaly to conclude who it is.
---
They are indeed still around and seem like good dudes. I’d recommend for a galmil Corp in FW.
---
It does say "any NPC" so I would say just ratting would be enough. You can find easy pirate sites all over.
---
&gt;Open map
---
&gt;Select "fleet mate location" or whatever it's called
---
&gt;Get some dude blacklisted for being a leeching dick
---
Just run abyssals with two buddys
---
If a hunter t3 or stratios roams through systems and they have combat probes with them, i would assume the least they will try is scanning you down. I would be very surprised if they are like "oh look a tengu, some wreckages ... ahhh i could kill him, but i ignore him, as he might see me" ... 
---
If the assumption people "would" see you prevents you from hunting people or trying to attack them, then you could assume there is a cloaky guy watching a gate flash in every null, which leaves you with nothing left to hunt :)
---
You are right, a ded runner could get out ... but how often did you get a kill, and were happy about trying it, even if your victim could have escaped if he would be watching d, or would be more cautious. :)
---
Spreading the Imperium out (and other nullblocs) diminishes their supercap umbrella advantage. Sure it is still there, but everyone cannot be defended as timely.
---
It does, it's on the right hand side on top of that boxy winglet
---
heretic is good because you can cram combat probes
---
Nothing at all would have happened if it were possible for caps to get involved.
---
Really? I haven't seen it tho. Maybe that's more relevant in WHs?
---
Eve is primarily a PvP game. Even buying, producing and selling stuff on the market is PvP. And the "ingame police" NPCs that exist in some areas of the game (high security space, or hisec for short) do not prevent crimes, they just arrive after the fact to punish the offender.
---
There are tons of things you can do in EvE that are under the PvE category. But sooner or later you will have to engage in PvP in order to be able to protect your ability to PvE. There is no such thing as "let me PvE in peace", apart from joining one of the big power blocks in null sec (they all have corporations that accept newbires) and farming under a capital ship umbrella to protect you.
---
Even that is slowly changing (the developers are experimenting with ways to make it riskier because it causes inflation in the game economy) and you will still have to attend alliance fleets from time to time. That's beacuse you are expected to contribute in defending your turf if you want to be able to farm in it. (That being said, large scale fights do look a lot like PvE for the majority of players. Unless you are a fleet commander or someone with a crucial role like a scout, etc, you just follow someone else around and press F1 to activate weapons on targets they tell you.)
---
If you don't join one of the big groups, you still have to know a bit about PvP.
---
You might have to evade some suicide gankers (groups who kill haulers and miners in hisec, they get blown up by the "police" NPCs but their friends are nearby and will still get the loot off your ship wreck).
---
You might spend months learning how to do an industrial activity that gives you profit, decide to place an engineering station to optimize your profits and then start getting war declared by other corporations who want to be paid protection money.
---
You might invest a few hundred of your hard earned millions in a market plan, only to have some guy with much more money and assets manipulating the market. The prices crash and now you are stuck with a bunch of stuff you bought for almost a billion that are now worth less than half their original value, and you have to sit on them for months until the prices go back up, tying up a bunch of your money.
---
You might form a small corporation and decide to make a home out of a quiet low sec pocket and do some mining, only to find out the locals don't want to share the resources and will start shooting your ships the moment you try to mine anything (happened to a guy i was in the same noob corp with, when i came back to the game and made a new alpha clone to see what had changed since i stopped playing).
---
And the only way to manage all that (i say manage, because you can't 100% avoid it) is to engage in some of it yourself. If you don't play as the hunter or even the "bad guy" from time to time, you will never learn how they think, how they operate and how to defend against them.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
What type of an incursion is this ?
---
&lt; drops elite widow on ishtar
---
&lt; scan res of dread, takes 20 secs to lock
---
&lt;ishtar has core stabs and warps off
---
&lt; log off
---
&gt; Capital proliferation ;
---
Short of just outright nerfing capitals, what's the solution? Capitals take a long time to train for (at least they did when I first started in 2006) and for many are seen as *the* ship to aim for.
---
The more time that passes, the more and more pilots that will have access to capitals.
---
just because something exists irl doesnt mean it has to in a game. balance should always stand over that.
---
if you want to know if a ship is friendly, just ask on comms? is that to much to ask in an mmo?
---
botter easier to ban? pls.. it was to hard for ccp to ban ''players'' online 24/7 for weeks. as if this would change anything
---
i can only see bots or riskaverse players benefit from something like that.. and noone likes those anyways.. so fuck that
---
mad ticks with this strat
---
4 days.....
---
oh my, those evil chinese.
---
do you hate the russians, too? or just asian people?
---
if you can afford internet you can afford a sub
---
The reduced speed penalty for cloaking makes nullified Blood a hilarious thought. It's an untackleable _battleship_.
---
could you show us  please? that's sounds interesting!
---
Lmao, "happy to help", sure. Your support team can't even answer a ticket regarding unrightful ban for over 4 months.
---
The community is good, just be ready for people to try to kill you. Like that's just part of the game, you'll eventually meet some one somewhere who will decide to murder you for no apparent reason, even if you're in a high security area. You'll lose ships and assets, but that's part of the normal dynamic.
---
Good tip, take the time to skill fitting skills, especially with free sp right now
---
Aideron Robotics iirc.
---
In Serp and/or Gurista space. It's the resists.
---
great stuff deadwood, good flying and nice kills. i liked the little krabs too lol
---
&gt; Blopping around
---
&gt; Decides Ishtar is worth dropping

&gt; Gets what he deserves

&gt;Have you ever seen a not risk averse pvper

All the time. Come to wormholes. It's fun.
---
SOAB, I just finished skilling up to get my VNI to max dps on 5 large T2 drones.  MF.
---
i was having a pretty rough day yesterday and logging in to sit in rookie help and english help for an hour really brightened it up. thanks for being understanding about the outage yesterday &lt;3
---
also wig :3
---
From the wording and seeing a few in his time
---
Cheating in China is EXPECTED and is a way of life. It is culturally acceptable to cheat in school there.
---
Cheating in games is even more accepted because its how everyone does it and you need to remain competitive.
---
So its no wonder the folks in serenity come here and bot the living shit out of the game.
---
Not really true. DED runners are actually the favorite of most people blops hunting. They are much safer, and require more effort than "warp to anom, tackle, light" but they're also way blingier and more fun to hunt.
---
Have considered that it may be too late to save null? Nobody can even remotely touch goons, and this will persist for the foreseeable future. Conflict in null is essentially over, and it's unlikely it will return, no matter what CCP does.
---
It's safer for you move that Nighthawk by itself than inside of a T1 hauler.
---
Damn really so no proof or anything inconvenient like that just reasons well cool thanks.
---
Any corp in Villore Accords. Moira, FWII, QCATS, Hell Too, etc :)
---
That's really depressing.
---
Hell if I know what's the solution ... obviously we're going to have more and more of them , so in the end I think it's a more of a matter on how the players choose to use them .
---
You seem to be an expert in this area. Can you help me fitting a covert cyno on a stratios, please?
---
That you're suggesting its easier to solo 5+ accounts instead of 2-3. And that he has quite a bit of experience with BLOPS.
---
Rorqual miner detected. If you’re upset enough to post such an emotional reply, who’s really reeeing, my dude?
---
And the sperging in question isn’t limited to this thread. If you’ve been on the EVE Reddit for the last two weeks, you’ve probably noticed it. It’s a minor feature of the reason changes.
---
They need to make capitals the objective warfare ships and give subcaps the ability to control grid and escort them.
---
There are also a **lot** more hulls than there are cap-capable pilots. I wouldn't be surprised if all the powerblocks had atleast 50% of their current cap and supercap numbers just in stockpile, waiting for pilots.
---
tHeRE's NO botS in DElVe GuYs
---
Wow another Naz post I upvoted.
---
What the fuck.
---
It's called supply and demand. You sell things to other players. Doesn't mean it's PvP.
---
You can argue that what some traders do is "Market PvP" but for the normal person this isn't the case. You did something and gained a thing of value. You can then sell the thing but that's not PvP.
---
Blackout is nothing new. Wormholes don’t have local. Plebs afraid to leave Jita find themselves in null doing fuck all and get bored. It’s players fault this game got stale. CCP shouldn’t be the ones having to save it.
---
Someone was probably going to shitcan the game and one guy was like wait wait wait... let's shake shit up. Give me 3 months and see what I can do. Right? Got nothing to lose.
---
If you post it twice, it must be true.
---
why is PIRAT with the blocs?
---
I didn’t say the potato was bad, I’m just tired of having like two choices of blops vs the four available. Like typhoon looks great to me but is kinda doo doo as well. See where I’m going?
---
Look at the screenshot, then at a calendar.
---
Because that one exam determines how well you do in life. And if one school stops cheating from happening while every other school doesn’t, then it does nothing but prevent anyone in that school from being successful. 
---
If the cheating were addressed on a national scale, and the response were the same, then you could talk about their culture or whatever. But the real problem is having one test decide the rest of your life. Obviously people are going to cheat when the stakes are that high, and stopping certain people from cheating while allowing others to cheat is more unfair than just doing nothing
---
CCP should add a cooldown timer for coverops, so they can't cloack forever. They also should have a sense of danger.
---
You still get 10 frigates out of that, the other 10 get ganked by recons.
---
Skilling spree and the current login event are not the same thing.
---
Skilling spree is next week's SP for killing things.  Like, the pun is kind of obvious.  Killing Spree?  *Skilling Spree*?
---
Ahh, the classic goon. A racist piece of shit.
---
Just a bit of friendly WH rivalry. Don't take it seriously.
---
There was a post awhile back that suggested instead giving them a D-scan immune bubble as a deployable. The Black Ops ship would still show up on D-scan, but everything in the bubble would not.
---
Basically you simply use the Widow and leave it behind so you can focus on the important task at hand
---
Well my corp/alliance has minning op with guys doing hauling, others gatecamping, a few probers/wh rollers.
---
Even for the PvP guys they are pretty ok. We talk and laught on comms, as we spend time as a group.
---
you are wrong. VNI lost his drone speed bonus and even with two navi computers it not apply full dps to fast target...
---
I prefer that you stop writing nonsense on Reddit and instead come and sing on comms. Hello? :)
---
Time to make GalMil winning again
---
Yeah, honestly learn to play first, then decide if you want to join a null group. That way the good corps in the big blocs will take you, the null small gang groups will take you, etc. You actually get to have more fun. The days of Old Brave fun/hr seem to have passed and it's about krabbing for taxes.
---
I'm gathering material.
---
Give widow huge buff to range of ECM burst and it strength.
---
_mmmmkay ....
---
Stick a load of crap around the gate, can't cloak, easy tackle.
---
I was referring to hunters in general. I think you can't fit one it ... but there are people that are solo hunting with stratios's ... neut fit on top ... i don't see an issue there from a hunters perspective ... 
---
I just brought the stratios up, because it's one of those typical covert cloak cruisers. It's not a hunter for lighting a covert cyno, afaik.
---
But what is the exactly benefit for player numbers, for smaller alliances, for a change in political landscapes etc ?
---
I understand that this fuzzy feeling in the tummy of the smallest entity in the game, the solo/small scale elitists maybe was worth it to "nerf these rich people up there" in nullsec. 
---
But what is the major "problem" in New Eden since a long time ? It's the absolute dominance of Delve, and the incapability of every other entity to hold up with the one, big powerhouse.  More people will joining the Imperium, because you get there atleast some kind of response to your tackle. 
---
The Renting System should be dead by now, so zero income for smaller groups in Nullsec.
---
What was exactly the numbers back in the days of solo/small scale elitists. Will the Return of Chessur and Co have a massive impact on player numbers ? How much of these "hardcore bitter vets" are coming back ?
---
At the end, CCP gave you the good feeling of doing something "against these bad and rich people up there". Does it really changes anything besides of giving you the good feeling of some shitpost on reddit ? I highly doubt it :/
---
For big would be several thousand players like test, pandemic horde, goons, init, fraternity, deadco for the most known, I'm not on my computer so I certainly miss some and misevaluate the numbers.
---
Small group would be up to few hundred I think
---
As long as it's not limited to trig invasions, because my main can't go into hisec lol.
---
I guess I can krab abyssals.
---
As dumb as it sounds, as a new player it can often be worthwhile asking the player who killed you for advice on what just happened. 
---
Many players (not all though) will happily take some time to explain how they caught you, and anything you could have done differently.
---
Give it a jump drive
---
t2 links for those solo battlecruiser shenanz?
---
fucking rip
---
The trick isn't nerfing capitals, nerfing Rorquals, or nerfing Engineering Complexes. Having no-TiDi capital fights is fun! Ganking rorquals with normal response fleets is fun! Shooting structures... is and will always be cancer, that is what it is.
---
All of the issues above are severely symptomatic when you merge them with large player groups. If coalitions/alliances were substantially smaller, then the health of the game and nullsec warfare would substantially improve. And yes I've heard the argument so many times, people will want to play with their friends, safety in numbers, etc. etc. There are still certain game mechanics CCP can institute to make "zerg" warfare much less sustainable or viable.
---
Oh look, another bargaining thread about trying to add more intel back in because of the loss of local. 
---
Too bad the minute something like that happens an automated tool will come out to parse Dscan and have a regional intel network back up. Nice try though
---
I don't know if it's savable to the fun some of us remember, those days are gone. But it's heartening to see that CCP are willing to tip the applecart up and see what happens.
---
We started to hunt hunters. We set up a VNI bait and wait until some t3c tries to kill the vni. We can get pretty good money from doing that. It's also hilarious then the hunter starts to cry and calling us "krabs".
---
They're pretty much the only ones left from GalMil AFAIK.
---
I feel like carriers make sense in an anti-subcap role, but I dont think they should really apply well to sub-cruiser size ships. I also think they should crumble to dreads.
---
You could buy him a jump freighter. He's been asking for one for some time.
---
So what you want to say is that if i transfer my keepstar to 5man corporation, and just give access to all people in my huge alliance ... no one will be able to touch assets of my members?
---
With only 4 lows for cargo expanders it's not even that good bridge blops.
---
You say that like you thinks it's only temporary
---
blackout is the best thing to happen to eve in s long time. i have really enjoyed it over the last week and have had so much organic content because of it.
---
Green new deal? I'm ready for the free shit since I don't feel like working
---
Lol k
---
Neut Tristan's sometimes have a chance... Scram kite atrons,  dual web Merlin's, tormentors.. they tend to stay least win some
---
Because it's viable to drop solo blops on Rorquals and carriers. /s
---
While I agree with your premise. That's not actually what that quote means at all.
---
"If you're explaining, you're losing." is a political axiom meaning voters are much more susceptible to simple concepts than they are complex ones. It has. Absolutely nothing to do with truthfulness or lying.
---
That was indeed a great one.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
You can implement some sort of penalties for that i suppose . Like high maintenance cost for your structures , if your numbers are high , etc.
---
tired of seeing people crying for nerf after nerf against mining and pve but expecting their playstyle to be totally untouched as hunters
---
Nah it's a pretty noob friendly community, most of us are happy to teach. Join a newbro group like Eve University or Einstein-Rosen Brigade that really focuses on teaching (rather than the big null groups that seem to just want you to krab these days). There are others, I've sent a few newbros to Stay Frosty lately, for example. Part of it depends what you want to do. All of these groups are politically neutral so if you DO want to join a big bloc later, with the knowledge to carry yourself, you can make your choice. Not that line members moving between the big blocs is at all rare; even in high command they do that.
---
Yes, I'm in one of those big blocs myself. Frankly I'm only there because my friends are and all I fly is solo/small gang. It's nice to have a big alliance economy backing it, though - that's definitely a perk I can appreciate.
---
How many people i need to kill in jita to take the sec stat to 0.49 ?     
---
How many to make Niarja and Uedama a lowsec :D           
---
Next thing is that this is good idea, but it have also a significant flaw.          
---
Players are to heavily tied to space they live in by structures CCP introduced and that you cannot move.
---
Amusing over the top comedy skit that gets old three paragraphs in
---
Works fine in Provi too
---
It’s supposed to be just a trial.
---
Where are you the last years ? I mean, its cute to see you creating plans in your little tristan or kiting shippie in Lowsec/WH or wherever you doing your vegan PvP.
---
We always had Dreadbombs in NPC Delve ready to drop, we always had spys in Delve (ASCEE), we always sold Dreads from 1DQ into NPC Delve etc.
---
Your whole post is just another +1 for the "omg finally these bad and rich people getting punished by the government" Circle Jerk on Reddit. 
---
You will celebrate every single Super/Titan Loss in the next weeks like it would be an exclusive Blackout Kill. 
---
Sorry for shitting on your dreams of a fully Vegan World. But even when you believe that your vegan lifestyle will have any impact on the enviroment, at the end there will be still 95% Carnivores in New Eden 
---
&lt;3
---
after blackout and vni nerf, please, nerf supercap unbrellas next. ty.  (◕‿◕✿)   
---
another resubbed vet.
---
If only there was something other than poors fit HACs and caps.
---
Do it to the new guy and tell him that rat bounties  in this area must be different than where he was before. I guarantee you could get at least a few people to fall for it.
---
I'm one of those fucking retards that actually like to mine in eve online. Now that afk mining is gone or at least not worth it i have seen a decrease in ships mining which ofc is a good thing. (Less miners, more valuable ore, easier start for new players, more profitable industry etc.) Next thing i would like ccp to do is make the afk miners in low/hisec fuck off as well. Especially those 30 player bot groups mining ice since even CODE doesn't want to fuck them.
---
i would actually like to know if i can just continue doing abbysal sites and get sp from the Triglavians i meet there?
---
ccpls bring navy caracal out of the dunce corner
---
No. You are not alone. Fuck all that
---
Can confirm we use Heretics extensively in Odin's
---
rock....
---
im sorry in the spirit of the blackout i decided to not bother reading it
---
Don't forget your fuel truck!
---
Awesome ty.
---
Anyone know why this happens sometimes? Someone a few weeks ago had a theory that sometimes they may bug out and spawn without guns but i think im able to see some weaponry on this ship.
---
It conceivably makes implants a cost/benefit analysis. If you actually cared about training times you'd fly around with +4s or +5s.
---
what?
---
at least we're not worthless mouthbreathing provi krabs
---
I can tell you they weren't called, they just showed up lol. That said, it's still shameful how the big null blocs interact.
---
Carriers should be able to apply damage just to battleships and somewhat to battlecruisers.
---
Supercapitals should simply not function without subcapital support against other subcapitals.
---
Aideron Robotics and GMVA are pretty cool guys, would be worth checking with them.
---
No you fail to get the point. Dscan is not meant to be an all singing and dancing at a glance to let you know whether you’re safe. It’s up to you to determine whether what is on that scan is a danger or otherwise. And in any event, all you need to do is ask in corp/alliance chat.
---
it is known for a long time bots have atoher means to detect other ships than just loking at local or dscan. All this blackout killed is real players, and the only ones farming are bots. silly CCP played themselves ( again ).
---
I want a Netflix series based on this.
---
It says "any npc", so i guess that should work
---
Mango's blue
---
Now just train for an Ishtar and u'll be all set
---
The state of EVE for the past few years has been absolutely cancer. Uncontrolled chinese and casual botting put us on a course for an assured yet slow death long term.
---
Show us killmail where Theraboys hurt you
---
Im not.  JF arent that safe.  WH mass limitations dont really matter here and you dont need as many people as he is claiming.
---
I do.
---
+4s near constantly.
---
i just got my very first kill, so i guess it's a pretty good day
---
yea that makes sense
---
I never ran a 10/10 with a widow i always used an ishtar myself. 
---
The long lost days of deklein living. So much money from garra and zungen geez.
---
Ouch lol
---
Don't be mean, the Widow is the best soccer mom Blops out there!
---
Keeping your stuff for when you enter a new CC and resub right?
---
&gt; You vastly underestimate the size of the super umbrella of the big alliances
---
Really?! Can you show me a fit or you think its on zkillboard?
---
Thats a far too much seasoning
---
Tell us your route and when you want to do it, we'll be here to escort you, no worries, so you might not even need to fit your orca tanky!
---
It would punish them if they got the skill removed and lost the skillpoints. Alphas are already gimped in so many ways, they're really meant to be an introduction to eve and not a constant way to play.
---
There are always ways to get something if you really want, but not everyone prepares every camp very carefully. :)
---
But blops are not supposed to be in a situation that the tank keeps them alive. More like range and jamms but the jamms are useless now.
---
What is the point of an "insane tank" on a blops ship lmao
---
RDRAW, [the all time top galmil corp](https://zkillboard.com/faction/500004/topalltime/) is recruiting and active!
---
Russians are asian
---
Just saying heretic is an amazing ship!
---
Now if you meant the eris then ive no clue never flown it.
---
People don't understand that criticizing a culture doesn't make you racist.  Surely Asian/Chinese Americans are less likely to cheat than Chinese citizens.
---
lol :)
---
Nice avatar maybe nyx time it will be jagar level of fast
---
Cheers mate
---
Haha thanks man til next time :)
---
Yeah its strictly a cultural complaint. Not a racist one. There is nothing fundementally hardwired into Chinese DNA to make them inferior or superior or more likely to cheat.
---
Its entirely about culture.
---
This was good until you made a MAGA reference.
---
nerfing is the solution. Ships in eve are supposed to be specialized, the generalists are supposed to suck. Titans should be heavy anti capital, carriers should be focused on killing subcaps, dreads should be focused around killing caps, and super caps, and structures.
---
Don't run SBAs with ancils. Run resists.
---
Perfectly accurate as usual. This is actually what happened.
---
Apart from me throwing the first punch - I never throw the first punch.
---
Also, I'm a biter. Biting people hurts.
---
farm them yourself, or as the blackout-lovers say: adapt
---
Nice one and i feel ya :) i also go through t1 frigates like its no ones business
---
Exactly
---
Blops all need love, can't believe I come back after 2 years of loads of new ships, balance patches etc and blops haven't changed
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)
---
They push F1 and generate taxes, at least once they learn to play.
---
Is organic content arriving at a null sec gate with 3 boson titans, 2 supers and a handful of kitchen sink sub caps sitting there....that’s been the only thing I’ve seen....but nope, eve isn’t broken
---
&gt; Oh nooo my anom ratting was nerfed! There’s literally nothing else I can do to make isk!  
---
Yeah, someone who's got a stable of VNI alts is completely prepared to be a large-scale industrialist.  Also, they totally want to jump to a different playstyle, but will magically do that within Eve instead of a playstyle in a different game.
---
&gt; make sure to biomass so you aren’t tempted to come back 
---
Your whine might be a tad more convincing if you knew enough about the game to know that biomassing isn't permanent.
---
&gt;  It’s almost like they’re too risk adverse to jump into a wormhole without a giant blob of f1 monkeys following 
---
It's almost like they don't want to spend a while scanning chains and rolling holes when they first log in, and instead want to start playing quickly.  Or any of the other differences between wormholes and null.
---
If you need the tank on a blops you're doing it wrong.
---
sorry i cant find a br of volta fighting another pvp entity and winning
---
Whats wrong with russians lol?
---
&gt; buff subcap pve 
---
You can't buff it enough to make it worthwhile during blackout.  Unless you're going to literally hand out isk for warping to an anomaly.
---
I mean, Flattening attributes doesn't rule out implants existing, They can still exist, Just as multipliers to training speed instead of more points into an attribute.
---
Then just make the cost difference continue to exist by going and doing 1-5% implants for each slot. Which stack to a max 25% training speed boost or such
---
Yeah but wheres the style in that... I didnt buy this sweet redeemer skin to ship spin
---
I dunno, roam somewhere else? 
---
That was happening before the blackout, not because of it.
---
oh right i was thinking of the other event that comes right after this one ends where you have to "fight triglavians" to get up to 250.000 sp
---
This people dont seem to get the stats on black ops allow them to pvp.but their not truly ment for it a t1 hull tanks better and does more dmg. I'll admit I have enjoyed some juicy kills when people do try to use them to pvp
---
didn't we already learn that effortless intel is bad?
---
So blackout hasn’t ‘fixed’ null blobs and supercap umbrellas - if anything it’s just bunched large groups closer together
---
You have the burden of proof wrong. 
---
    “CCP is saving our game. Here’s how.”
---
 FTFY
---
very active indeed
---
I find these puns anathema to good comedy.
---
afaik, only dread and marauder can solo C5. nothing cheap or quick to skill.  
---
but living in a C5 doesn't mean you have to stay in C5. a cheap drake (100M) can clean every gas site except vital and instru. so, you can :  
---
probe(astero), gas (venture), clean (drake) and gas all the remaining gas, then react it.  
---
several ships but one account, no high SP needed but some specific kills to have
---
You heretic
---
no habibi?
---
second weekend of blackout. let's roll out the wrecking machine!
---
It really does. Especially in those moments when you're alone (solo mining, exploration, etc) and the music hits, it makes you feel like you're alone in space.
---
Still acting like a little kid I see, lol.
---
Dude, why are you consistently trying to ruin everyone elses game? Nobody is forcing you to be in WHs, if you have issues about their state take it up with CCP. Dont drag others down to the level you are used to.
---
And fixing those issues, all the while not buffing mega alliances and giving smaller groups buffs not nerfs. 
---
The issue with caps isn't their number, but rather the speed and reach said capitals have. **What's easier:** Titan bridging a fleet or popping a cyno and jumping caps? Found the problem.
---
i know it's a hard concept to grasp for a lot of people, but i'll let you in on a little secret: goons are not the only null entity. shocking, i know
---
&gt;\&gt; in PH
---
First mistake. 
---
&gt;\&gt; Exploration sites in PH space
---
second mistake - it's full of exploration bots that will get all the sites before you, players should try Stain since all the random dictors kill bots. They'll kill you too if you're not prepared tho.
---
&gt;\&gt; 1s of action before getting popped
---
You're probably being too aggressive on tackling, and you're probably burning straight at your target. Burn at an angle and spiral in, and make sure when you go for the tackle your fleet bros are either in range, or 
---
If you want a newbro friendly small gang corp, try RvB, Stay Frosty, Dirt 'n' Glitter, if you're USTZ Dreddit has very active small gang, and lots of wormhole corps do it too.
---
gratz =) keep killin
---
Curse got WAY more active in the past week, idk about the rest
---
thank you o/
---
Because they need the iskies :)
---
Goon pets that live in Querious, that theoretically fight each other in a limited war agreement. I'm not sure how well it's working these days. When Pandemic Horde first started there were a bunch of good groups there. Then NoFun Coalition came and ruined everything.
---
he is actualy guarding you as you most likely have good standings to sansha :)
---
The problem is most redditors can't separate race and culture so everything is racist ...reeeeee
---
Repurposing the roles of supers and nerfing anomaly spawn rates (maybe combined with a reward boost) - then redoing the anomalies with the new AI, making them more fun, challenging and at an 'at the keyboard type activity', leaving mining as the chill multibox activity would be a good start.
---
habibi
---
This has always bothered me. It would benefit a great improvement.
---
Surely OP is talking about the likely hood of Chinese CITIZENS to bot and their culture.
---
My implication is nothing so drastic though I would debate some of the points in afk krabs. The point is if someone pays for their sub in plex they are effectively paying $20 a month for it.
---
&gt; Like high maintenance cost for your structures ,less resources, higher manufacturing costs, if your numbers are high
---
Wouldn't work. Say you implement an exponential cost to holding increasing numbers of structures.
---
We split each alliance down into alliances of 1/2 corps and blue each other. Structures now massively cheaper, same effective alliance.
---
Wait you want to say she is fat?
---
For the skilling spree, you'll get SP as a reward for killing any NPC, so you can hit up agent missions, go belt ratting, cosmos, go looking for triangles or drifters, whatever you feel like!
---
Hitting agent missions might be the best for you if you're looking to increase your standings with a given corp or faction at the same time.
---
It's up to you really, so long as you're killing NPCs, you're all good!
---
The true reason for price drop is the shadowy organizations that rule the eve underworld.. or under galaxy? Under star cluster? Under universe? Send help
---
Reading comprehension, yo!
---
I said people joined to kill goons.  People also joined to help goons.  People joined to 3rd party both sides.  People joined to do more indy because in a war there is shit-tons of isk to be made (margins increase!).  People joined to move stuff to the battlefield.  People joined because other people seemed to be joining.  People joined because all the gaming magazines were writing about this stupendously cool war that just couldn't happen in any other game.
---
And very few dropped out.  Because who wants to miss all the fun?
---
Lol think your flair Sums this up ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Just so you know, I've not played the game since 2016.  But reading about the blackout caused me to omega last night - literally the first thing I did this morning was reopen my handbook to start refreshing my memory on the delivery service.
---
Now all I need is a few hours back in the pod and some good references on what has changed (other than blackout) since I left the game.
---
But truly, thanks for the handbook, and all that you and the delivery service does, you create content disproportionately greater than any other group in the game.  Well done!
---
TAPI gave them space to bot in
---
Hey, don't shoot the oracle for being the harbinger of the apocalypse prophecy of good comedy.
---
Sounds good to me
---
Don't forget at least one battle badger.
---
ccp please stop titan proliferation (✿◠‿◠)
---
People already refuse to fight to save their structures they shouldn't be able to uproot them for free.
---
Solution: Only t3 structures can do this.
---
Derp, I misread that as TQ
---
Everything about caps is problematic. Too much mobility, too much application, too much damage, too much EHP, too price effective compared to the ship tier below them.
---
You could get rid of BPOs, making BPCs rare drops from data sites (that'd make data sites worth running, too. Two birds one stone).
---
Blackout success?  Naz is back?
---
Are you a stabber? Couse u stabbed me now I need to get my legal guardian.
---
The comedy is so good I might bowhead to op of the comment I just can't see a porpoise to this but I can't close this widow either
---
Whenever the fallout from the Summer of Monocles ends.
---
Using a large injector just to prove a point on reddit... hats off to you, my dude
---
&gt; Imperium is tied to Delve and cannot ever leave the regions when structures alone represent 1-2 year of work.
---
Goons could delete every structure they had and fully re-built them from scratch in &lt; 3 months. 
---
The correct answer is large / xl structures with jump drives that can move &lt;x&gt; systems per interval (systems, not lightyears).
---
Botting in Insmother, I'd only be less surprised by Deklein
---
Wrong.
---
GoG, Aideron, and Sons of Luminaire are also active
---
Word. The discord tells you to join a specific Corp in Iron Crown (Frats Rental Group)
---
I've been in Facwar since 2011 with Minmatar first and Galmil for the last few years. 
---
Currently with GoG now.. We're the 2nd biggest Galmil group, but still small enough to be tight knit.
---
We're the premier Amarr Rp corp in Galmil militia (joking but we fly a ton of Amarr stuff, hope you like lazoring shit)
---
I'm not quite sure what the term "Big Bloc" refers to in the game. If I am to assume, it means a colloation or federation of smaller corperations?
---
Fry ticker, if you cba to watch it.
---
Nice advertisement for your botting software. Is there a referral code involved, maybe?
---
I've not played the game since 2016. But reading about the blackout caused me to omega last night - literally the first thing I did this morning was reopen my handbook to start refreshing my memory on torpedo delivery services.
---
Now all I need is a few hours back in the pod and some good references on what has changed (other than blackout) since I left the game.  May even mess around with faction war...
---
But truly, I spent much of last night just moving ships around, remembering the past thrills and looking forward to the new ones.
---
Is wingspan and bombers bar still active?  After I remember how to d-scan I need to go whaling....
---
Sounds like an NC. patch.
---
Yes I am aware of that, however I'm attempting to take steps to minimize the changes or amount of times that I will be killed. Will I still be killed? Yes, but I'm trying to prevent from dying all the time.
---
Goodbye Stacy
---
&gt; Fraternity ticker
---
Not surprised at all.
---
Can you please explain as to why?
---
Don't worry.
---
At least none of the recent changes encourage more people to get caps/supers....
---
&gt; loose
---
Referral code “非常大的鸡巴” for one free day of rental in Insmother.
---
No Scam.
---
All those 10/10 Rattlesnakes that have multiple safe citadels per system with instant tether and a docking radius of your mom?
---
I disagree with the idea that inflation within eve was uncontrolled I have been in games with actual uncontrolled inflation even plex prices which are by far the outlier in rising prices.  My main concern is that the attempted fixes to these problems may be coming too close together to accurately determine the cause of any delayed effects on the player base and in game economy.
---
First thing to do: DELETE FAX. Refund SP&amp;ISK. 
---
No more FAX-alts to get that additional buffer for the response fleet to save your ratting titan, no 50 FAX in every Cap fleet to make alpha-dmg the only viable strat to kill anything...
---
 [https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/type/36480/](https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/type/36480/) ?
---
&gt; CCP Listen**ed***
---
While I won't disagree that they have been on a decent run lately, I feel it's a bit early to start making blanket statements like that. 
---
They have had good PR runs in the past too, only to either 'leave well enough alone' and leave features uniterated on to the detriment of the game or do a complete 180.
---
But I will say that seeing /u/ccp_falcon and Hilmar in the wild talking frankly about the game does give me the hope that things are changing for the better.
---
Something something you're racist for pointing out Fraternity bots something something
---
Do you think the problem is mainly supers? I don't think I've seen a group shy away from a fight because both sides have dreads or carriers, but it feels like everyone wants to avoid fights when supers are involved.
---
Pinkylein is a master baiter dude
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77833130/
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77833152/
---
Yo procurers too spook now
---
I know this is a joke, but delete this. CCP doesnt understand humor, and they usually have terrible ideas.
---
just put together four or five dudes and go roaming outside of bloc space. there is no shortage of fights to be had with other small gangs.
---
you might struggle with your ticker tank though, depending on your alliance. if another gang sees a goon scout, for instance, they could assume there are a few dozen more behind him/her and not take the fight.
---
unrelated, but unspoken is recruiting and literally no one is afraid to fight unspoken.
---
&gt;Capitals take a long time to train for
---
See point 2: Skill Injector use.  If you want to have an alt that can use a fully decked out capital day one, you absolutely can through the use of money.  Are you "paying to win"?  Not exactly; it's the same tools that everybody else has access to, just that you can get to those tools much faster.  And the fact that people can just inject up a capital alt leads to capital proliferation, and that in turn means standing fleets turn from a bunch of battlecruisers and battleships to a full capital umbrella.
---
Eh, CCP could also adjust the mat costs/drop tables to decease the manufacturing cost of the rigs.  
---
If the cost of fully t1 rigging was equivalent to the structure cost itself, the math would shift a lot.
---
but vov IDK
---
Sounds like RvB, dosnt it.
---
wish it would work that way
---
No offense, but this is 100% hypocrisy. The wild west wasnt even the wild west and do you think people just accepted outlaws? No they formed posses and killed them, they introduced and enforced the law.
---
In our case people built a superfleet. Its the wild west so anything goes right? No, cause people have been bitching non stop, you included in this very post.
---
So you want us to live in the wild west yet play civilized but you dont have to abide by any rules? Thats BS on a very high level.
---
PIRAT is blue with Test so they share objectives. This was one of them
---
&gt; You are not supposed to be able to(!) unless you are in overwhelming numbers.
---
Have you met our lord and savior, the Triglavians?
---
Lol I'm not saying it's balanced at all, I was trying to point out "Right tool right job." Solo blops to kill afk VNI/Ishtar is silly.
---
Then what is the role of the carrier? To only get used against the handful of battleship fleets you see? 
---
\- Carriers don't do enough damage or have the tank to take on even solo dreads, supers, or titans (all of which can easily tank a carrier)
---
\- Carriers can't tank enough to keep up with most med sized gang cruiser dps. Fight a few T3Cs with logi, the carrier will almost certainly die anyway before a nerf. Even a small gang of T1 cruisers with logi and some ew will dunk a carrier.
---
\- Barely anyone small gangs or solo roams in a BS. Most BS fleets you see are 80 machs which will nuke even a gang of carriers. 
---
\- Solo drop on t1 3-4 BCs with logi and it will be a tough fight if they maneuver correctly. 
---
Recently, I dropped on a small gatecamp much like that, the logi pilots did very well to get out of point/neut range and keep their friends alive. Forcing logi off once (they could rep enough to tank 2 fights/1siren but not 3 fighter flights), I then only broke one BCs before they were repped and back on grid in a better position to rep each other. We then got into a weird stalemate for a few mins and disengaged. It was very fun for all and isk lost was comparable between the fights/cyno and one BC. They create content for the little guy who isn't so risk adverse for with them but still not enough tank to really live against a decide small gang. 
---
These changes would absolutely kill the carrier. From a small corp aspect, where you dont have then numbers always, fielding a few carriers in the current state is a nice help to even things out and get a GF. It really is a good equalizer to the subcap blob fest at times. Numbers shouldn't always win, but currently they almost always do. Carriers help break that cycle at the risk of getting blapped by even a solo shit fit dread. 
---
I do believe they should be more expensive to counteract their usefulness. It is pretty sad a cheap fit carrier is about two fitted machs/t3cs. I don't believe they are in as bad of a place as this sub makes them out to be.
---
Yes. It refers to the major coalitions - PanFam (Pandemic Legion, Horde, Northern Coalition), Legacy (mostly TEST and assorted pets), and Goons (and their assorted pets). They are large organizations built around huge fleet operations that are usually weaponized boredom.
---
Caps take a long time, but doesn't a BLOPS take as long or longer?  Caps don't need BS V anymore, they don't need cloaking or covops.  They cost qas much as a Dread but have much much shittier insurance.
---
Cost in SP, materials or isk isn't and shouldn't be the way to balance a game.
---
Too bad? It's something that needs addressed by CCP.  Your analogy is also off.  Supers like everything else in the game do need to get sploded.  Because of the sov owning requirement as well it is very difficult for smaller groups to even get them to do any contention.  Pretty much you're just wrong.
---
CCP pulled bait and switch tactic. Expect no reimbursement from them.
---
Also expect uber elite omega people to tell you go to fuck yourself for being an alpha.
---
I like where your head is, but we need to be careful using cost as a balancing factor. That’s originally why Titans were justified in being able to kill entire subcapital fleets — because they were something entire alliances had to invest in. Now the cost is trivial, and sure their abilities have been scaled to some degree as well, but with isk slowly inflating over time it can’t justifiably be used as a long term balance measure.
---
China. Is. Not. A. Race.
---
I've watched a vast greater number of casual players leave nullsec than step up and become more active. Are we okay with running off casual players from nullsec? Are we okay with losing active players because they are casual?
---
It would be awesome if you all could setup skillpoint bounties for killing particular NPC's to encourage people roam and explore different parts of New Eden that they are not familiar with.
---
For example, to encourage people to explore low sec, set bonus skill point rewards for killing Clone Soldiers. This would create pvp as well since people would be running into each other while hunting them in asteroid belts.
---
Dude, the last part is gone right? So all that remains is the first part which means intel goes in the hunters favor, no matter how you dress it up. Makes literally no sense why you would have any fking intel into sov space whatsover, never did. And it makes no sense why sov space doesnt have any intel in their space, never will.
---
And thats before even commenting on the arguments.
---
Another way to nerf carriers is that fighters should die to some frigates, even if the light ones can pose some danger to frigates.
---
Brilliant video and piloting!
---
That's like saying small entities should automatically be able to fight the biggest entities in the game without going through the whole growth process. Both in numbers and shipwise. Not how it works.
---
Well what else am I going to enjoy my morning wank and coffee to?
---
Disable unanchoring if the Structure has been put into a timer for the past X amount of time.
---
Fortunately, we have stats to show you how wrong you are and by how much. 
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/puu3s1/monthly-economic-report-june-2019
---
and its shit at that since it has the least lows for cargo expanders
---
By the nature of being cringy. It is not hard to understand.
---
fighters should be jamable  
---
also GNI rework when?
---
Maybe attempting to scrap a structure could make it vulnerable? Could make for some interesting scenarios
---
The culture in Southern China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are all very different.  yet they are for the purposes of this conversation the same race.  So you are wrong, saying the Chinese (unless he meant as a race and not regarding PRC) is not racist.
---
Misdirection
---
Cannot wait for the follow up post wherein you tell us about how she kept a secret from you for years and now the paperwork is being served.
---
I’ll add, nerfing covert cloaks. Make them cost something besides cap! Like LO! At a certain point you need a fuel truck or head back home. Make camping require actual planning.
---
I think making them less cost effective would be a big component of bringing them in line.
---
Go to HS.  Veldspar is one of the highest yielding ores/ore hold since Trit has been on the rise.
---
Bro, do not use "bro" so much, bro. Not a good bro look, bro.

It isn't racist to point out bots. It IS racist to label all persons of a particular race as botters.
---
I like to think these get forwarded in work emails. Or put on the rec room fridge.
---
Oh maybe Im' thinking pushx. Their freighter limit is 2b
---
Nothing is really ever "too late" since CCP is god in their universe.  That said, it doesn't mean they know how or want to make a change.

The issue with capitals isn’t the dreads, carriers, it’s the supers.  The requirements for alpha are high, too high... and their repair scale or neut requirements are also too high.  Issue is that people like sitting their alt in their big expensive purple ship, waiting until something comes that they can mass deploy and blap.
---
The solution involves scaling these ships down (nerf) or scaling everything up but these ships (while everybody’s says, yaay buff, it is the same effect as nerfing these ships down).  Do it either way that people seem happy but scaling hp and damage has to happen.  
---
The real issue is purpose. Carriers and titans should be for sub cap deployment.  Specifically....
---
A nyx is ready to jump, it has defenses against capitals, but none against subcaps.  Instead, pilots dock/latch onto it. Nyx jumps, people unlatch and go into fight (aka replace fighters with subcap players).  The nyx still has fighters but primarily for attacking other caps.
---
The titan has the same thing, except bridging now bridges the titan at the end of the cycle (you want to mail a squad of people to a system, the titan joins soon after).
---
Prices to build on these ships cut by 50%.  Prices on dread carriers and others increase by 10%.  Offset the rest somehow.  
---
Something like that.
---
This shit right here. This shit makes me wish OP would just go back to fuckin' school.
---
What do you mean by weaponized boredom? I'm assuming larger coporations are more political focused. Not trying to avoid warfare completely, but to a degree to where their losses doesn't justify the means for the war. Otherwise avoiding unesseccary and wasteful wars.
---
Um, no I’m not.
---
It actually is how it works. Anyone can wardec anyone else.
---
disclaimer I don't actually believe that lol. I have two friends living in my house who can in no way afford internet or an eve sub, and only have access to the internet (and utilities at large) because I pay for it. So yea I do get it man
---
When did I say I have issues with their state? I think they are a strong model for how a lot of nullsec should work
---
Judging by the first pass attempt at education, outlook not too hot on the second.
---
&gt;to high
---
to high what? What are they going to high?!
---
you clearly joined after the fighter changes
---
The state of your reading comprehension for the past few years has been absolutely cancer. Uncontrolled blurf and hurf durf put us on a course for an assured yet slow death long term
---
There will be less conflict, as structures are literally the only thing left to fight over. Now you would just show up with your opfor and they just uproot and run away. Just like they do now, but now they actually lose something if they choose to abandon their position.
---
There's very little they can do to even the odds short of deleting goon assets or "randomly" targeting them with something much worse than drifters
---
The issue isn't that subcaps should be able to kill capitals without overwhelming numbers, the issue is that capitals shouldn't be able to fight subcaps. As in apply damage to them.
---
I am not talking about just wardecking and getting a chicken shit kill here and there. I am talking about if two entities of vastly different sizes goes to war with eachother in null. Do you think a 100 member corp should be able to conquer a 15k member alliance?
---
i wonder how many players would take an isk refund (from ccp) to dissolve super assets (to effectively remove them from the game)
---
Oh lol
---
...Except that's exactly the subject of this idiot thread and what the original poster is saying quite explicitly with you in agreement. OP thinks that players are a "problem" directly due to their alliances. Even if players aren't breaking the rules, he says, "Do you have to blue everyone up?" You chime in about abuse in the setting of my assertion that players aren't breaking any rules. Therefore, no strawman at all, unless you are not saying the things you are both pretty plainly saying. You aren't real good at this, are you? I would advise maybe taking a step back and not letting your hatred of goons color your quest for logical clarity.
---
That's not like saying that all.  I didnt say they should win but being able to destroy some of the supers is good and important./
---
I think they should be able to try. Why would you even think stopping the attempt is a good thing?
---
"drop in your own t3 or bomber gang" heavily implies you're doing it yourself
---
Reeee my 6 rorqual alts
---
“The same tools but faster” in exchange for real world cash is definitely pay to win. 
---
I don’t blame anyone who has the money/time/inclination to spend their money that way, but let’s call a spade a spade.
---
I'm not saying I know how all of this is going to turn out, but players leaving nullsec doesn't have to be a bad thing. Null was supposed to be high-level content for the elite players who were willing to live dangerously. There are two other "secs" for people who want lesser degrees of risk, and they're important to the health of the game, too. There's a reason you can make more ISK in null: it's not supposed to be the easiest place to operate. The fact that it is has completely screwed up the economy. People who want to afk mine and rat should be able to do so with relative ease in HS or maybe LS for higher income and higher chance of getting ganked. But they should not be pulling in the high bounties and more expensive ores and exploration rewards that were intended to be a reward for playing on hard mode. So IMO every casual or afk player who leaves null is restoring the proper economic balance to the game.
---
Long fleets, lots of structure bashes, fights aren't very interactive. Often they avoid engaging at all and just blueball each other so less people will want to show up next time.
---
Avoiding unnecessary war makes sense, which is why we have all of these limited engagement agreements between the major blocs. Full scale bloc warfare is a lot of work.
---
I'm summation, what you have is a jump bridge that can't bridge ships, a reconnaissance ship too conspicuous to do reconnisaince, and a quasi-battleship that has less armour than a snowblower but carries enough ammo to blow up half of Domain.
---
It’s been a week. 
---
Be the change you want to see. Stop suggesting every newbro join a nullblock. Do something more than log in for pings and push F1 in your ferox/muninn/eagle.
---
Or go to a wormhole and not worry about supercap proliferation.
---
Or don’t. And keep crying on Reddit about ccp not catering to your exact playstyle 100% of the time. 
---
The only people I’ve seen complain about the blackout are risk averse nullblock Krabs. The only people I’ve seen white knighting for small groups are large nullblocks. Haven’t see a single small group complain about it. Really makes you think.
---
Hopefully we will see asset safety removed next. Or my unpopular suggestion of removing faxes. Or put ADMs on a bell curve. Or skill injectors unable to be used on skills above a 4x multiplier. 
---
Happy Friday friends.

BuT FrAt doESN't BOt
---
Comments in this thread are golden, armchair experts going wild
---
A tech 2 battleship should at least be *usable*
---
So you mean that a capital shouldn't be able to defend itself at all against a subcap ship? So if I tackle your super in a frigate I should just be able to shoot at you and hold you down indefinitely? Until one of us gets too bored and decides to go eat dinner?
---
Well I do, yeah. But there’s a big difference between 2-3 toons and the 5+ you’re suggesting.
---
Implying anyone flies an Ishtar
---
I think if they are so hard to kill by subcap forces they shouldn't be allowed to exploit ratting income with them.
---
oh no, horde has spies???
---
Actually more conflict - because you can save some of them.       
---
Look what goons did to NCPL.       
---
NCPL just folded and moved out, now if they had to start to unanchor structures in various places at the same time - you cannot have blob in all places.        
---
You need to split it making manageable by smaller forces - and in those places you will send no one people can recover some of their stuff.
---
The problem, I think, is that it's very difficult to have overwhelming numbers. Large groups can bring in more and.more and more caps and supers to the point where any attacking game is outnumbered by supers.
---
Do you get 10,000 sp with every tick just like bounties?
---
No one likes to afk raft.  You fall out of the boat too much and that water is COLD!
---
(reading comprehension yo!)
---
Can you add some ports so my little guys can stick their guns out the side? More DPS!
---
i literally said you don’t have to. i haven’t been on standing comms for years.
---
Sadly, this is the most accurate description of the Widow that will likely be presented. It's the ship I want to love, but can't...
---
This is totally incorrect. Dreads cannot be remote repped in Siege Mode, yet to do any more DPS against a structure than a battleship, a dread must be in Siege Mode. 
---
Ergo, your instance that carriers were built to 'remote rep dreads' cannot be the case. What is more, for the first 4 years carriers existed there was absolutely no such thing as a triage module. This was added much later than the ships themselves, so again... it makes it really hard to assert that carriers were designed around the remote rep role. In fact, CCP actually *added* faxes because they *did not like* carriers in that role. 
---
And of course, up until the carrier rework--so the fast majority of the time carriers and supers have been in the game--carriers could field massive amounts of standard drones, with which they used to great effect against sub caps. Even today, light fighters apply excellent DPS to subcaps. 
---
So really... 'all capitals were designed around structure bashing' is incorrect. The *only* capital designed around structure bashing were dreadnoughts, and even dreadnoughts had a secondary role of being, at least until heavy fighters came around, the *best* counter to fighting other capital fleets--including carriers. 
---
In any event, as someone who has played this game since early 2006 I can tell you that what you are saying is not accurate regarding the initial design of capitals. 
---
And then now days, structure bashing is barely even a thing now that POSes have been removed from the sov mechanics. I mean, they are sort of useful still in this role... BUT, again... with the current structure mechanics this is mind numbingly boring. 
---
AND finally, to come full circle, given that I have literal *years* of training in these ships, given the really small (and necessary, but absolutely boring) role--at least with the current mechanics--you would like to see *all* capitals in, I reassert my point--the skill point investment of these ships is too high if you want to confine them to this very, very small niche and boring role. 
---
Ergo, sure 'change them'--I wouldn't, but hey--to this; however, you better be prepared to refund a significant amount of the skill point investment capital pilots have put into those ships.
---
A dread is ballpark 10 x the cost of a T1 Battleship. It has ballpark 10x the tank and 10x the DPS. The battleship itself does not have anything close to 10x the tank and DPS of a T1 cruiser, that costs 1/10^th the price. Maybe double the DPS and 4-5x the tank.
---
Ships should get less and less price effective as their cost goes up, this doesn't apply to caps.
---
Uhhhh, the MER does a breakdown by region. Not highsec, lowsec or nullsec. BTW just because Jita, the place where literally everyone in the fucking game goes to buy shit, has the most amount of isk destroyed, does not mean that it is representative of the entirety of highsec.
---
Partially because I have a personal Rokh investment, how effective are they?  Not alot of folk using as much anymore.
---
It's because the true currency of eve is people, and just like the real world, the more money you have the less each dollar is worth to you. No one knows how to appreciate money quite like someone who's poor but gets the occasional windfall. A small group usually appreciates people and finds them valuable on an individual level, a big group spends players en masse.
---
Good changes overall, but they’re punishing normal alphas for something they didn’t do, and wasting a month+ of their time.
---
1. Hunter
---
2. Bridge Blops
---
3. At least 4 bombers, or two T3Cs.
---
That's at minimum 4, and from the wording you use I would guess more.
---
Plot twist: Goons want to move
---
I mean it's not like you're paying for a ship that is outright better than anything else; it's the same things as anybody else. You shoot the same ammo, you blow up in the same explosion.
---
Hunter/bridge are so ridiculously easy to multibox it’s not worth mentioning, and two t3cs are simple to manage on grid.
---
I think if you are interested in staying in lowsec/highsec, you are better off running missions (L4) for isk than doing anoms.
---
I think there are decent guides to mission running so that relatively new characters can participate. 
---
I have only ever lived in null so my knowledge is limited.
---
It's not racist really, is it.  I mean if it's prevalent or much more common within one group than other, it's OK to call that group out.
---
You make a LARGE logical leap from "friending everyone ruins the fun" to "making friends is abusive".
---
You see that? That's the strawman you made.
---
The OP is clearly following the well known gaming issue that "given the chance, players will optimoze the fun out of the game".
---
I don't even hate goons. I was in CFC during the second fountain war.
---
&gt; ov
---
No, I get that... and I get "a" for armor and "s" for shields; however, this seems like a really dumb reason to change the name of implants that have been in game for 14 years. 
---
Just change the the faction that Slaves come from, leave the name the same for continuity purposes, and call the new implants "shield amulets" or just "amulets."
---
Better solution: Delete all structure rigs
---
It is quite good. Painfully easy to tell who has spent time actually solo blopsing, compared to dropping 10 RR Blops on an anom farmer. Not saying there's anything wrong with that, I've done plenty of both and they can each be a ton of fun in their own way. But what some people are saying is just... Well you know :P
---
That's not what I want to say, that would be stupid.
---
 I think I reply to your main post instead of one of your comment ^^ was the one no asset safety and you said that big group would farm smaller ones that are not blue once every 1/2mouths
---
Welcome back to pos warfare, which was bad. Not being able to anchor a hostile citadel to a launch an attack from provides the defenders way to much of an advantage.
---
Entosis as a carrier mod? lol
---
Aren't they already sleeping on Test's couch?
---
Shame there's nothing a Widow can to avoid being shot at now.
---
honestly that is a fair point.  Make hem more pvp focused 
---
But the issue is pve mechanics, fixable by adding ship restricted gates like ded sites though
---
Not saying they should not be able to try and fail, that's their right as players in a sandbox game. It's when people start whining about not being able to do so in just subcaps, or shocked why they fail in just subcaps I fail to see logic behind.
---
I don't see how the two are related.  And of course ratting is self-limiting, in that it's so tedious nobody in their right mind would do it for more than a few hours.
---
I believe both are still active
---
Kind of like how when people whine about others whining.
---
I fail to see that logic.
---
I am no theory crafter, but there are a lot of options as to what to target:
---
Create a counter.  
---
Nerf the way caps are useful in all situations vs any threat.  
---
Make them spread.  Sure they will still be OP if they are in one place, but if they have to spread out they won't be able to be in more than one place at once.
---
Sure it requires creativity and risk.  But the empire building part of the game is now over.  People have taken the sectors of the map they want and blued everyone else.  You are now a sandbox without empire wars.  (What do you call a sanbox in which some ways to play aren't even any longer a choice?)
---
Explain why you think highsec and lowsec have lesser degrees of risk?
---
I agree the widow needs fixing but the purpose of a blops is to pop in and gank something that cant fight back effectively.  I think I've been in maybe 3 or 4 actual fights in my blops and all of them were mistakes on our part, even the victories.
---
I would say invest in an Astero, Cloaking IV, and do some NPC null exploration. Can easily bring home 2b-3b in a trip.
---
༼ つ ◕‿◕ ༽つ bless
---
But the defender should of course be able to defend his stuff right? There are a lot of public fleets with huge numbers! I'm not sure what people people think, do they really want to be able to kill capitals with their 5 man cruiser crew? WTF
---
There's like 200 dudes sitting in R10- (Horde's man ratting system). Probably a good 50 of them are in the same sanding fleet.

---
goon alts.
---
Sure...except you can't tackle a super in a frigate. Also, you should probably have friends or a plan. But yeah, if the frigate has no friends, and you have no friends I see no reason why it shouldn't just be a stalemate forever. I can tackle a battleship in a jag and it will be stuck until I let it go (assuming it doesn't have nuets or ecm drones ofc)
---
So...fit some ecm on your carrier or have neuts if you're worried about this happening. lol
---
No you can't "easily" do that.
---
Let's go ahead and set aside your l33t PvP skills and not even address the mechanical side of your argument. The sp and isk investment of running 4+ accounts is not insignificant like you suggest. None of the ships are cheap, and the less you use the more they generally will have to cost.
---
Wow dude are you being racist against redditors?
---
test literally gave them space
---
RIght! Azbels should be able to produce supercarriers! So smaller entities can compete easier!
---
Yeah, you actually can. Well, maybe *you* cannot, but I know many of people who can, and do, regularly.
---
You know there is stuff in between those extremes right?
---
There is something between 1000 supers dropped on a frigate and Titans having 1 hp.
---
&gt; In any event, as someone who has played this ga
---
I agree to an extent; however, and this is hard to justify with a shrinking player base, but I think this should be combined with the addition of more null sec space. The intention being to spread exiting sov holders out more, and to allow for new player organizations an opportunity to stake a claim in null sec.
---
I'm sure you don't.  Unless you're talking about burners in Venal.  And how long is a "trip" anyway? 
---
Remember the rule:  Divide the amount claimed by 10 and multiply the time asserted by 7.
---
That was easily one of the best evenings of music I’ve ever had in my life.
---
I've believed this for years, since my first month of playing and doing all that study in fact.  Corp and alliance sizes need a giant nerf bat and for this to do any good, standings lists need gone.  I've heard all the arguments and gripes here too.  But it is the best way to bring smaller fleets back.  Small prevalent fleets will help restore pvp fun and the game.
---
Yeah, I agree with that. But then it sounds to me like smaller entities should be protected or immune for a period of time so they could manage to get to a certain size first before being submitted to attacks from a much larger entity. Difficult to make work in a sandbox game without a reset though.
---
&gt; I'm sure you don't.
---
Then I have nothing more to say to you.
---
I wonder what all thoae fleets we have run for weeks that were not 4:1 and didn't have goons?
---
Heretics are useful if you're cyno hunting
---
I'm a botter and not Asian, and your comments offend me.
---
The Sansha frigate captain watched the helpless little venture in its scopes,  the venture captain to his credit had not deployed combat drones or tried to flee the normally terrifying visage of a Sansha warship the Sansha captain thought to himself.   
---
It had been more than a year on the same assignment.  Scout for prey, report to the combat fleet, and retreat so they could come in and claim the prize (and glory)   a generally unpleasant assignment for which he was certain was his because he had upset a higher ranking member of the organization, otherwise he might have a better assignment by now like some of his other initiates that joined at the same time as he did.   But even as the Sansha Captain thought to himself about his toil, another thought entered his mind, a time before he committed himself to the glory of Sansha's Nation and was but one of many on some backwater outpost in a system that even the capsuleers hardly exploited due to its celestial insignificance when he would work in the docking ring of a old mining station and occasionally chat up with the docked captains and crew of the local mining rigs that were willing to go out and find the raw materials the colony and its supporting stations needed to sustain itself. 
---
 Back then, it seemed that people ,like this Venture pilot now, were more inclined to initially treat him kindly, or atleast without hatred and he had even counted a few among those ship crews friends.   Fate seemed to have different plans for him though as Sansha's Nation had invaded the local cluster, abducted him and the entire population of the colony and... educated them into understanding the power and importance of what Sansha's Nation was fighting to achieve.  
---
However, several years in and having been left mostly to himself and his tiny crew for the majority of his assignment,  The Sansha captain had begun to question the Nation's motives and his place within the organization. Instead of seeing every non Sansha's ship as a prey or a threat, he wondered about their lives and motivations,  if that Venture captain, who had still been mining long after the Sansha captain had made his presence known, had called for reinforcements or if he was unconcerned, or just desperate enough to continue a mining operation despite a potential threat in the area,  or perhaps, the Venture captain was like him in that he was tired of the constant violence that seemed to be commonplace in the lives of the citizens of EVE, and like him, wanted a moment of peace and friendship before the next disaster or crisis revealed itself.  
---
And so, in that moment the Sansha's captain made a decision and wiped records of this particular venture from its scouting logs and added in what little protection he could, placing a 72 hour no kill order on the little mining vessel, into the Sansha Nation combat net.  Knowing any communications would be logged and immediately transmitted to fleet command for analysis, the Sansha frigate quietly continued its orbit of the venture.  keeping just outside of its normal weapon range and with its guns visibly powered down and in the docked configuration as to be a visible display of its non aggressive action.      
---
The Venture captain seemed to understand the meaning and had one of its mining drones break away from the asteroid it had been extracting from and do a casual, non threatening flyby of the Sansha, ejecting a tiny bit of silica from the asteroid and creating a beautiful shower of sparkling rocks that shown spectacularly in the local stars light.   The Sansha captain smiled, despite the violence and despair that plagued the citizens of EVE, he had seemingly overcome some of the biggest odds of fortune and quietly among the void of space, he had made a friend.
---
And all of a sudden exploration is dead
---
Fuck no. Carriers are perfectly fine to apply good dps to subcaps. 
---
They have great strength and great weakness. Big glass cannons that can be defanged and destroyed, but present a massive threat to subcaps and other fighters. 
---
It shaw dreads with fuckoff local tanks and tracking titans with bosons that are oppressive
---
I should really point out that I’m 100% NOT anti-Goon. Let me be clear, I’m a Goon to the core and am thankful for the opportunity they’ve provided me.
---
Agreeing with changes CCP makes doesn’t make me a an undesirable/communist. Goons who read this post might feel that way, but I’m not. Honestly guys, HTFU, adapt, and stop being a pussy. All this cucked AFK shit is destroying the game.
---
yes.  
---
Frigate can go under BS guns, a cruiser cant do under carrier/super fighters.  
---
also, their warpcore stab bonus is absurd
---
&gt;Prove me wrong.
---
Ok:  [http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility)   Set to 2w.
---
Also, declaring victory against bots is extremely premature.  They are the entities that have the easiest time adapting to blackout.  They just need the time to implement their gate watcher bots.
---
Fax are already the endgame of entosis fights.
---
This one time in Perimeter, we were five against five thousand, damn did we fuck up the five.  
---
What a joke
---
In the interest of full disclosure I cancelled all 5 of my accounts when Blackout launched.  The one thing that really appealed to me about Eve is I could play the game how I wanted.  Not anymore.... 
---
Ask me in 3 or 4 Months, especially if the "Blackout" stays, how successful the approach is/was.  
---
I believe the "bitter vets" who cancelled might re-sub but they will be gone in a couple months when the newness wears off again and it's more of the same.   The game is simply not that different.
---
Can Eve survive a loss of 25% of it's subs?  I mean, since everyone who is not a l33t small gang/solo junkie is nothing but a Krab bot that should easily account for 1/4 of the subs.
---
Guess we will see how it plays out.
---
As opposed to worthless mouth breathing bearholers?
---
Top 3 looking hull in game honestly :(
---
Just trying to say give the guy a bit more credit, he might have lost a lot more than 5 mil
---
Yes. Both are active. The blackout is awesome.
---
Again, doesn't bother me in the slightest. I live in Delve under the largest super umbrella in the game, own three supers, and thus when I am really bored and decide to run anomalies, I will do so with absolutely no increased risk to myself. 
---
It is difficult to make the case that people being more scared is going to affect ratters in my part of null sec--or most of null sec. 
---
So... again, yes it does reduce botting which is good for the player base generally, but it impacts non-botters as well; however, only the non-botters in sub caps.
---
Imagine not being able to multibox a hunter, bridge and 2 PvP toons... yikes.
---
It's also a very valid concern.
---
"Chinese" botting.
---
Botting fix is short term most likely. No local will fuck over current bots, but they will adapt. It's not like there weren't bots that used ravens running belts when there were no standings in local. They'll just switch to dscan and have an acceptable loss, as long as they're making money they're happy. There are also already intel bots that watch local, they will just switch to watching overview on gates.
---
More PVP is great, but nobody knows how long it will last. A lot of people are excited about killing PVE boats with the blackout and are roaming around, but really the changes are more likely to consolidate people under umbrellas and to use bigger boats so they're not as easily ganked. The 2nd bloc in the game is already doing this in fact.
---
The economy is still pretty much in the shitter, inflation is still crazy high. The isk faucet of ratting going lower will help but it's still not an answer, it's been a problem since the beginning of the game. The only reason items haven't gotten more expensive is because they've also been making them easier and easier to get with the game as well. That's why items and ships are the same price or cheaper then they were 10 years ago when isk was much much more "valuable".
---
And the biggest problems, plex, injectors, and rorquals are still here. Even if they take them away there is a TON of damage done, could it be undone? And people will cry that it's unfair. It would be, but sometimes you need to do what's been done. Touching plex will probably also not happen as it is a big source of income for them. 
---
CCP is doing stop gap things that look nice and aren't saving shit imo. Time will tell though, but I have serious doubts that this is anywhere close to fixing anything as they didn't tackle any of the real issues.
---
You are not supposed to be thousands of supers in game. CCP said maybe at most 5 in all of eve. So what's your point exactly?
---
Shit done changed.
---
actually.....that's not a bad idea
---
I’m surprised they allow extracting from alphas.
---
&gt;There are still certain game mechanics CCP can institute to make "zerg" warfare much less sustainable or viable
---
No, there really isn't.  Any mechanic you introduce to make it hard to be a giant alliance will result in the creation of alliances Goonswarm 2 through 30, with them coordinating out-of-game so that they behave like a single entity.
---
Imagine being so clueless you strawman and argue with people that have plenty of experience. I'd suggest you check out u/Pinkylein and u/Windsigh then adjust. I've got my own fair share of solo blops experience, not that I think I'm any authority to speak on it.
---
I didn't say it was difficult to run those accounts, I said it's a hefty investment. But you do you boo.
---
No thanks, I'm not trying to play bridge online
---
&gt;Create a counter.
---
Goons can build and field more, purpose missed.
---
&gt;Nerf the way caps are useful in all situations vs any threat. 
---
Entity that can field the most of them gets nerfed least, goons indirectly profit, purpose missed.
---
&gt;Make them spread. Sure they will still be OP if they are in one place, but if they have to spread out they won't be able to be in more than one place at once.
---
Goons have roughly the same number of caps and supercaps as the rest of EVE *combined*. I'm convinced they could cover at least two, if not three or maybe even four regions with umbrellas. It also wouldn't be hard to hold that space due to citadel mechanics.
---
&gt;the empire building part of the game is now over.
---
It was over in early '18 essentially. We just didn't know yet. Every day since then is just exacerbating the problem.
---
&gt;What do you call a sanbox in which some ways to play aren't even any longer a choice?
---
A very shitty sandbox.
---
You'd absolutely have to allow them to receive remote reps for that to be viable. With the diminishing returns on FAX reps, this could lead to some interesting small cap brawls. The current state of entosis timers would have to change a lot before it's interesting, the balance of damage application would be a big sticking point as well.
---
Hey hey hey, Concord cloaks are what real men fit instead of purple
---
Thats not what you said tho
---
Music takes me easy back
---
thanks mate, found it!
---
Welcome to 2019
---
Where am I supposed to fit the extra fuel?
---
Yeah, I flew with red frog for a while and now mostly just service private clients I hard cap the value at 1bn as I afk a whole bunch of freighters whilst doing other things.
---
never knew that.
---
Yeah dude I know, I was doing the same in Sagain and neighboring system, don't remember the name. At first it was literally every second poor soul that made 15+ jumps in a shuttle and died 1 jump before waypoint and now he 100% will be late was messaging me or throwing bounty, it was glorious.
---
I think the event was fun, just system choice was bad and exploitable.
---
I agree!
---
It was about time to stop this.
---
No more free ISK for us, so let's try something different and make the best out of the situation... like actually enjoy the game. :D
---
&gt;A nyx is ready to jump, it has defenses against capitals, but none against subcaps. Instead, pilots dock/latch onto it. Nyx jumps, people unlatch and go into fight (aka replace fighters with subcap players). The nyx still has fighters but primarily for attacking other caps.
---
We called those Motherships.   When it utterly failed, we converted Motherships into Supercarriers.
---
For a battleship that costs as much as a carrier, the entire blops class needs love.
---
Covert cloak to start.
---
MJD bonus that spools faster would be hawt.
---
And can they not have a build cost more than a carrier?
---
HEY CCP.
---
My ideal EVE is themed on the idea of diminishing returns rather than hard limits.    
---
 
---
Want to fit a bunch of the same module? Stacking penalties. Doing PI and want to put a ton of extractors on the same spot forever? Resource depletion. Want to do a ton of industry in a particular system? Increased taxes via industry indexes. Want to do exploration or DED sites in a busy region? Gotta wait for site respawns.    
---
Why can't we do the same with citadel damage caps, capital weapon application, mining (moon, anoms and belts), anomalies spawns, bounties, triglavian and abyssal drop rates, and so forth.    
---
To some degree we have it with skill injectors, but clearly it needs to be looked at again.
---
Definitely didnt say that.  But you also dont need sov to put up a sotiyo.  That being said I think its a better idea to introduce a tool like a suicide heavy bomber or something that with 10 to 20 of them youd have a chance of blowing up a titan with them.  JUst something to punch up better and preferably see some more supers getting destroyed on a regular basis.
---
Why do people keep replying this? Of course limiting alliance size won't stop grouping. What limits grouping are disincentives such as scarcity of resource, limitations on concurrent production per structure. Combat mechanics such as anti-supercapital bombs could dissaude titan/super balls. Etc. 
---
And no, none of the above would be a perfect or even good solution to stopping zergs but they are examples of fixing the zerg issue at it's root.
---
Tired of the screeching botters
---
Most underrated comment here. I love you.
---
Found razor
---
You're right. I suggested there was other ships besides AFK anom farmers, and carriers. You suggested DED farmers arent realistic targets. I totally agree that citadels have made hunting them a fucking pain, but many *actual* hunters (IE not prospect warping to VNIs and lighting) have adjusted and found some unique ways to adapt. It's nowhere near the level of pre-citadel and pre-DED nerf, but still entirely possible.
---
biology hardwires..
---
I've unsubbed my alpha before it was created! xD
---
There are playstyles for you, they're not in the null blocs. I don't sit in Fleet 6 either. 
---
Sounds like you might enjoy being in hisec more tbh.
---
Possible != practical, fun, engaging, or time-worthy.
---
There are some counters, but nothing perfect . 
---
Firstly, bind mwd and cloak to f1 and f2 for easy access. 
---
Second, set default keep at range to 2250m. This is close enough to loot but far enough away that you can cloak. So if you need to cloak at any time you can do so immediately. Make sure to stay away from the random objects in a site that would prevent cloaking. 
---
Last, and I only do this one if I am pretty sure I’m being hunted, make a bookmark 200km off the site. From there, warp to a can, hack it, and warp back. Always have your screen set up so you can see both a warpout point and your overview while hacking, and if anything appears hit warp with your mouse and cloak on your keyboard. This is good because the hunter doesn’t know where you are going so they have a little less time to set up, and the constant warping keeps you on your toes so you don’t get relaxed and die. 
---
However, two things you need to watch for that have no real counter. Dictors and bombers. Bombers can lock targets immediately after decloaking, so if one is camping a site you won’t be able to escape no matter how good your reflexes are. If you are using an Astero, a decent fit will allow you to 1v1 a bomber and win easily, but if the bomber has friends there is nothing you can do. A dictor is more rare, because they have to be waiting in the site the whole time. But if one is camping, it will wait for you to get close, decloak, bubble, and then burn for decloak on you. The only way you survive this is hitting mwd and aligning away from the site, and hitting cloak before the dictor can lock you, and praying you don’t decloaked.
---
&gt; carriers should be focused on killing subcaps
---
I would argue against this. If you take your suggestion the best fleet is still titans and carriers. No room and need for subcaps.
---
They should have superb projection, good anti-sub dps with horrible application and add a little cherry on top. Maybe some actual mobility like jump cooldown, higher jumprange, being able to carry a few frigs through the jump with them or a MJD.
---
Also capitals are way too tanky. They need it for fleet warfare but then the rest have to balanced for that use.
---
Besides being a pretty subjective thing you might as well quit playing eve. Isn't much left that's practical, fun, engaging, or time worthy. Especially so for so players outside of lowsec
---
Concord
---
The issue is with the new tenebrex jammers. They are horrible to deal with. They basically ensure that a cyno will not be lit and no escalation can take place. And if you do kill the jammer you get a small 5 minute window to jump in, but then it gets jammed again and all the guys coming late get locked out...no FC want to deal with that, so you don't see them die much anymore. Jammer should not be removed, it has its place, but it needs heavily modified
---
The fact that its a "national" problem pretty much proves his point about the cultural ethos regarding cheating
---
Let's just delete carriers tbh.
---
Or make them just be the ratting capital lol
---
Um, am I arguing with you or with Windsigh? Or are you the same person? 
---
It appears to me that I’m arguing with you - and if you genuinely think that it’s hard to manage a standard solo blops setup, not really sure if there’s much else to say other than, lol.
---
Removing jam bonus and changing it to a pure combat should would help a lot. It simply can not do both.
---
Blue donuts &gt; blue waffles
---
&gt;I feel optimistic about EVE’s future
---
That is likely not shared by many players.
---
&gt;NPC kills in the most botted regions have dropped dramatically.
---
If there is any chance they can come back, they WILL come back, and CCP will continue with small scale bans.
---
&gt;The price of injectors is going down
---
Injectors are a major part of the fundamental problem.
---
I would counter that with saying I am a casual player and I returned just because of the blackout.  
---
Solo exploration and small scale pvp has become more possible in nullsec.  Where before I would be hunted across systems by intel guided locals.  Now I find more people risking sites.  Folks who would normally only uncloak if nobody was in local are risking themselves.  It is quite fun to be honest.
---
&gt;What limits grouping are disincentives such as scarcity of resource, limitations on concurrent production per structure. 
---
Why?  It's way easier for Goons to conquer 3 regions than for a small alliance to conquer one constellation.
---
Also, per-structure limits?  Have you been to Delve?
---
&gt;Combat mechanics such as anti-supercapital bombs could dissaude titan/super balls
---
Does it occur to you that the giant blocs would have lots more of these bombs?  And so be able to use them to annihilate any smaller group's caps?
---
&gt;And no, none of the above would be a perfect or even good solution to stopping zergs but they are examples of fixing the zerg issue at it's root.
---
And this is why you keep getting the same replies.  You think these are fixes when they actually make the situation worse.  You don't seem to think past what people are doing right now and into what people will do after your proposed changes.
---
oh no please don't tell the thought police !!
---
if you need covops cloak - or even a t1 cloak for explo you are doing something wrong
---
always wanted to reply to ccp dev on reddit :3
---
wait my whole life is a lie
---
Why do you think small structures should be more expensive?
---
Man you're retarded stop acting like anyone in a super umbrella wasn't already trying to krab their way into rorqs/caps/sups
---
A lot
---
eve-o preview or just alt tab?
---
Nobody has.
---
A start would be to make those skills not injectable. Cynos should be on a 5 min delay. Damage must be severely nerfed against all things subcap.
---
Interesting read, and I agree with the general sentiment of it. Its hard to think of the knock on effects that outright nerfing capitals would do (which is why balancing anything in eve is such a nightmare) but it does feel like there's two games being played. Sub capital and capital/super capital are world's apart, and it's to the point where unless you can match numbers/caps, it relies entirely on large fuck ups from the defender or their side to do anything but feed/retreat.
---
Eh youre right, it is subjective and im projecting my annoyances.
---
Ive switched to AFs and T3Ds for ganking cheap ratting subcaps, its not even worth the little time I have to cloaky camp in T3Cs.
---
Is that why Tribute was a series of uncontested bashes? Legacy wasn't anywhere near Tribute, and we still had superiority.
---
Then they should be able to also fit a solid tank so they can last longer than 2 shots if they get found while decloaked.
---
There's very little CCP can do.
---
There's plenty the players could do.  But that requires a hell of a lot of diplomacy and work by the players.  So it's not gonna happen without the NCPL block getting leadership willing to do that.
---
Lol ok
---
that's it? pfft. people should be ok with you gaming as opposed to many things you could be getting yourself in. 
---
My wife knows I play EvE, I explained my avatar as a big penis ship and other's want to take away my penis... and of course smaller ships. She knows anything but titan ops I can always close out of and help her with what she needs so sometimes a convo goes: "Honey you playing with your penis?..." Me: no.... "Her: ok come with me grocery shopping please...". :P
---
So... Ummm..... You were right.
---
You're arguing with everyone, like a moron. Feel free to peek through my KB and let me know, though.
---
I dont think thats the same issue.  It IS an issue I do agree for the big cap fights but I dont think that is the issue pertaining towards the smaller trying to punch the bigger.  At least not as much imo.
---
You can lead a horse to water...
---
Still, you will get caught just by someone else warping to all fleet members in system, or the fleet boss checking who is in a cloaky ship in that system.
---
Command made me say it, they are really dicks, get the message out plz before they find me.
---
&gt; I havent claimed any 1%. What are you basing this on?
---
My bad on that.  It was a different post from someone else on the same page.  Got a bit confused.
---
&gt;  Last I check they do not publish certain numbers, like sub numbers. Ofc you cant make the login data your only input but saying it doesnt say anything or that you cant back track is meeeh. It will literally give you login data, no more no less. It will mess with the counter, thats all Im saying.
---
Here is them publishing such numbers.
---
https://youtu.be/xUgxLdELYyY?t=1223
---
&gt; Ofc CCP knows how much real effect it has but we dont. And that opens up for onesided information. Like how is this strange to you?
---
It isn't strange it me at all.  I am a software developer and every project I have ever worked on keeps track of metrics like this.  Its almost always a requirement.  It is almost 100% of the time never made public.  CCP has a really great track record of being transparent with both there decision making and there metrics.  They have been doing things like publishing market data and dev blogs years and years before it even became a rare thing in the industry.
---
&gt;Especially those 30 player bot groups mining ice since even CODE doesn't want to fuck them.
---
Who do you think is running them?  They gotta do something when they aren't roleplaying.
---
Why not...its there game...if they want people to play it they are responsible for the product.
---
In lowsec you need to either probe down your anomalies or warp to a mission anomaly. Both of these require you get combat probed or probed down yourself.
---
In highsec if you don't jump your 8b golem through Uedama and autopilot it around you're not likely to die. The same goes for most other mission ships. If you don't want to be ganked mining either you can just use a procurer instead of retriever, or even skiff. Or just have an orca with shield reps on grid.
---
Highsec has gotten a lot safer as of late with the changes to wardecs as well - PIRAT, marmite and other groups that used to wardec and pick on mission runners that don't fight back can't do that anymore unless they drop structures.
---
I feel you. Almost a of my play was solo blops or so hunting in wspace, and I had a lot of those annoyances as well. I just came back after quitting prior to the AF change, and holy shit they're wild. Looking forward to taking a couple out just for that purpose :)
---
That's alot of words just to say nerf caps but you also forgot to throw in nerf infinite anoms
---
People rat in carriers because of the isk you make not the safety. People mine in Rorqs because of the isk you make not the safety. People join large blocks for the safety.
---
In wormholes you can roll and watch all your holes and make easy isk in a gila or spider tanked domis. In null you cannot shut off the entrances to your krab pocket. Short of making krabs go to DED space there isn't a mechanic that would be able to stop a good defense. But the attacker chooses the time of the engagement and the amount of guns he brings.
---
Really the only way to kill carrier ratting and rorqual mining would be to decrease the reward or make something else more profitable but more dangerous. If you nerf the faucets to hell people will quit, since they won't have the isk to fly what they want. You could increase risk to the current ratting mechanics by making bounties drop like blue loot thus requiring more effort and the movement of said bounties to a station but that would probably also piss everyone off. Maybe CCP needs to introduce ratting licenses or a module that make you essentially invulnerable to rats but nerfs your tank against other players and it is impossible to rat against null factions without it. Maybe they could change the ESS so there is a node you can attack and nuke the ratter's profits.
---
If you want to kill carriers go to horde space, they are usually shit fit.
---
yep, next on the list is an ishtar (not as cheap as a VNI) and maybe fit out a Gila.
---
Same was said about Goons a couple years back.
---
Aint CCPs fault MBC didnt step on the bees throat after kicking it to the ground.
---
Upvote for the thought out suggestions.
---
True, but a max afk/multiboxer might not notice that. But they will notice that their ticks are low
---
Wait, are you reeeing to my reeee in response to a reeee? No no good sir, this isnt reeeeeception. Not a Rorqual pilot, I'm actually already winning EvE because I have played for over 2 years now :P
---
Props for saying screw the ISK-war and brawling it out while outnumbered.
---
&gt;The trick isn't nerfing capitals, nerfing Rorquals, or nerfing Engineering Complexes.
---
At least you are not shying away from representing your own interests at the expense of the game.
---
&gt;Ganking rorquals with normal response fleets is fun! 
---
Blob warfare is so good for the game! 4% new player retention!
---
Think about it more like ego/reputation preservation thing. After all it all comes down to FCs to decide if they want to use super fleet in a potentially risky cituation, and many choose not to risk them at all, even if your alliance can replace 50 times what you can possibly lose - it's still a shitty deal if you will be the one responsible for it.
---
I wasn't thanks. 
---
I have no intention of setting up a bunch of cyno alts so I can have a ship  I don't want.
---
And yet...you've now made your big alliance much less effective at entosis defence, for example. You lose maybe some bureaucracy through ratting taxes/mining ledger.
---
Again, it's not perfect, but it's not just as simple as you think it is.
---
Why not both?
---
Someone should illuminate this for them.
---
Lack of materials on the market
---
&gt;literally no one is afraid to fight unspoken. 
---
:thinking:
---
regarding ticker tanking, yesterday there was a small mcav gang gate camping in malpais and they happened upon a lone pl sabre
---
so he bubbles them, they think nothing of it and start shooting him, and [then 30 muninns landed on them](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001150/201907172200/)
---
I'm not saying that to talk shit, they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, gatecamping a pipe without a scout and disrespected ticker tank
---
there is a *lot* of content to be had right now during the blackout, and panfams old space in tribute, vale and pure blind is utter chaos... but that doesn't mean you're completely safe anywhere. no local hides you, but it also hides everyone else, take precautions, be careful, remember to hydrate, and have fun 0wning
---
They did this in the last war already. They unanchored a ton of structures. We should not be making it easier.
---
But it is. it realty is. You change that jammer so that it cant be anchored with a citadel, making it have to exist in open space, and you promote more subcap fights over it. Hell, even making them vulnerable to a couple entosis cycles would be better then the current system in promoting subcap fights.
---
&gt; Edit: also any API that can provide Intel needs gone too.
---
But how can I take a fight if I cant see what his fitting is? You saying I dont have a right to know this? What? /s
---
A country's population isnt a "race". But it is a distinct group with its own cultural values. And values directly correlate to behaviour.
---
wait... isn't every human from the US?
---
Because frat was busy with Legacy and couldn’t come help. Also Gotg has a half decent superfleet which would have been on helping y’all.
---
Even in a WWB type scenario, the odds are even. Not that that would ever conceivably happen again. Sure, blame us and feel better about your revenge boner, but that won't save the game. 
---
By the way, now that the north is essentially not a worthwhile target anymore, where do you think goons will go next? Think about that really hard please
---
&gt; Why? It's way easier for Goons to conquer 3 regions than for a small alliance to conquer one constellation.
---
It's the ongoing maintenance and carebearing that becomes an issue when a group spreads out more. Who gets the good space? Who gets the prime protection? 
---
&gt; Also, per-structure limits? Have you been to Delve?
---
Structures still cost fuel and maximum efficiency require expensive rigs. Who gets the preferred and rigged structure time?
---
&gt; Does it occur to you that the giant blocs would have lots more of these bombs? And so be able to use them to annihilate any smaller group's caps?
---
It was a spitball idea. It's basically down to skilled gameplay versus zerg gameplay. Skilled gameplay has been greatly neglected. Zerg has been a problem for years, before I started playing, and PanFam was just as guilty at it as Goons. Yes, the masses could have the skill-based tools, but can they use them effectively?
---
&gt; And this is why you keep getting the same replies. You think these are fixes when they actually make the situation worse. You don't seem to think past what people are doing right now and into what people will do after your proposed changes.
---
Indeed. It's up to the game developers to solve this. Right now they're not solving it. They have made progress in nullsec hunting but nullsec warfare will still be problematic due to game mechanics not supporting skill-based gameplay versus zerg-based gameplay.
---
&gt;carriers should be focused on killing subcaps
---
No. There are too many of them and cynos are broken and injectors are as well.
---
No, it proves that the government is corrupt and lazy. Hardly a problem unique to China
---
ccp proposed reducing the build cost of supers a whole back and people said, that's not fair to people who already own supers, you need to give them a partial refund if you do that
---
then ccp introduced sotiyos and now titan hulls cost like 45b
---
no refunds were ever issued, ijs
---
I mean sure it makes life a lot easier, but I was still hauling in \~50mil ISK /h as an alpha. Just have to know how to circumvent bubbled gates
---
thats gonna be a no from me dog.  
---
D scan isn't meant to replace local, it tells you whats out there. WHO is out there your going to need to work for.
---
And now they are cheaper, so we get more capitals! Fucking great!
---
meh
---
&gt;\- Infinite resources ( CCP has tried to somewhat limit those , but imo, there should be a respawn timer longer that what we have now on them ) ;  
---
&gt;\- Citadel proliferation ( seriously , make just one timer for those with a 24 h response time, that's why you are a nullsec powerblock with thousands of players ) ;
---
Did you notice things like these two proposals directly offsetting each other?
---
You make people spread out, they're going to anchor lots more citadels.  When you've got 4x the structures to bash, removing 1/3rd of the timers isn't terribly helpful.
---
Aside from super long range assault I don't see what role they should have that dreads don't already do.
---
That horse is pretty much hamburger meat at this point
---
Carriers are the solution to supers. They should be the equivalent of an AAA ship, that is there to screen other ships from supers. They should be support ships - I'd like to see them be more like capital command ships with better boost stats (and probably take boosts off of faux to not only help balance faux self-repping, but give carriers a better raison d'etre), with great anti fighter/bomber capability, but very little role outside of boosting and screening.
---
Hell, i'd even like to see them maybe get burst projector type weapons (cause let's be honest, supers rarely bother with half of them) as a way of having some sort of battlefield control effect, but make them purely supporting rather than the oppressive and versatile role they certainly had, and still do to an extent.
---
You realize that not only the situation is different now, but that we would have reached the same predicament much sooner if MBC had stayed together?
---
The Grey/Orange set is in the NES right now.
---
its almost like nobody wants to invade one another, shocking !
---
rhml/torp widow is bae
---
That sucks

hello goliath (◕‿◕✿) :3
---
&gt;Are you "paying to win"? Not exactly; it's the same tools that everybody else has access to
---
Strictly speaking, no, but its probably irrelevant. It is using the same unethical mechanic to allow players to instantly access end game stuff for the purpose of making CCP more money. CCP benefits and players have pay the price in the form of imbalance.
---
I would not say reception has been positive. There are hundreds of voices on both sides of the aisle. Simply because one side is in a mode of "eat shit and die and haha quot the game" posting level doesn't mean there is now an overall happiness with the black out.
---
Honestly i kinda like the way caps are balanced(caps v subs at least). I spent half a year slapping the shit out of roqs and everything that comes to protect them while flying stukas. Obviously you need allot of guys but you have all day to form. Defenders have only a panic cycle to form and get on grid.
---
You don’t need probes to warp to combat or ore anomalies. Also, you’re saying to the casual player “you don’t need structures”. So basically you want all the goodies for the leet dudes. I guess we can make eve more restrictive and less friendly to casual players. Who needs a thriving base of players.
---
Yeah I do think that if somehow Tidi was resolved, and big fights were actually player vs player instead of player vs server there would be a LOT more destruction, which is something that I am all for.
---
But then they just drop caps and super caps in after the jammer is down?  That's not the same issue.  While it does promote I think more cap fights, but it doesnt really address the issue of a larger group with an overwhelming number of titans vs. a smaller group.
---
Because of obscure mechanics such as gate guns or concord. But lowsec became most dangerous because of no intel channel while at the same time having shitty mining and shitty anoms, removed local changes this dramaticaly.
---
To which CCP has done a (mostly) great job on.  It's the players who are risk averse, min-maxers, or flat out inexperienced and complacent which has caused this game to because stagnant. But let's all take the easy route and blame CCP for our shortcomings. 
---
I'd say its 70% player fault and 30% CCP.  They build a great sandbox for us to play in, I just don't think people, especially new players or &lt;1 year, know what to do with all the sand.
---
Pulse thrasher
---
Actually does more dps than normal thrasher in scorch range
---
Probably brought a decent few new players to the game too. It's stories about this crazy game that get people to start playing or in my case come back... Couldn't resist coming back after the recent news haha
---
Is there an SP limit?
---
The first half sounded like the opening to a porno...
---
Yeah, and each government affects each culture in different ways that cause stereotypes to be made of them.
---
Artifical Singularity implosion bombs: a.k.a "Space Nukes". Would do damage across the entire grid based on the mass of a ship and distance from said weapon detonating.
---
As well as better means of interdiction to interrupt ships jumping in-between system, but Idk if this game is designed to calculate that or not.
---
I remember a time when my afterburning frig got two shot by a super from maybe 50km+. It was good. I could really feel how well balanced the game was!
---
IDK, I think it goes more beyond a tactical level decision. I was watching DurrHurrDurr's stream once and this topic came up. He said that so many plans in TEST weren't even lifted off the drawing board because the first question asked would be "what about their supers". That kind of tells me that supers are seen more as a strategic resource much like how nuclear weapons are IRL. Though I can't say for sure since I've never even been at the table at a strategic level of a large alliance, I've only FC'd small gangs.
---
Stratios can fit a covert cyno, yes.
---
&gt;Sure, blame us and feel better about your revenge boner, but that won't save the game.
---
There was a chance to actually cripple Goons by following them to Delve before they could build a fortress.  Y'all decided it was time to krab instead.  You also had a chance to somewhat reset the animosity you developed with what are now the Legacy alliances over the years of farming them.  Instead you decided to attack them after WWB.
---
Actions have consequences, and they aren't "revenge boners".
---
&gt;By the way, now that the north is essentially not a worthwhile target anymore
---
You vastly underestimate the hatred you've inspired.
---
Also, let's be honest:  The North (in its current leadership) would never "lower itself" to helping Legacy, so this threat is rather empty.  With no help coming from the North, the best option is relatively friendly diplomacy with Goons against our common foe.
---
be nice :), it's friday  (◕‿◕✿)
---
Best dictor for tackling supers due to armor tank and small sig!
---
&gt; I feel optimistic about EVE’s future
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That is likely not shared by many players.
---
not true
---
&gt;Fight a few T3Cs with logi, the carrier will almost certainly die anyway before a nerf. Even a small gang of T1 cruisers with logi and some ew will dunk a carrier.
---
Not sure if I believe this, but should it be true, it just reinforces the reality that logi is overpowered in general.
---
They are also instantly appearing.
---
The people like CODE who suicide gank in hisec mostly do it for fun and mining salt. Max tank procurer should stop them, but if they are feeling like killing a procurer they will just bring more people and kill you anyway.
---
CCP listens, except for stainguy
---
Battleships are in such a bad place right now there is little point in even considering them. A few kiting frigs might as well be a death sentence unless mjd.
---
For hunting npc haulers, use a polarized max dps Hecate. Just kill the hauler, loot, and then switch to prop mode and warp off before the response fleet tackles you. No one actually fights them with fleets
---
&gt; Currently it’s not possible for small groups to affect null mega coalitions in any significant way.   
---
&gt;I wont comment if the proposals are good/wrong ... but it is not logical or natural that a small group to affect a mega coalition in a significant way. In RL, to kill an organization/system of a certain size (manpower &amp; resources), u need to oppose a similar size organization/system or bigger.  
---
&gt;Ofc devs (gods!) can introduce some game mechanics that will accomplished that but I think they will abused a lot as they will be inherently overpowered.
---
Im sure CCP is totally happy.
---
The 15-20% drop in logged in players disagrees with you. Set it for 6 weeks.
---
http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
The vocal minority is happy, but the actual majority isn't. 
---
If the blackout was a good thing, that number would be increasing. Time for CCP to cut their losses, revert the blackout, and never listen to the idiots in /r/eve again. 
---
For the people in favor of this, I'll concede that it's a good thing when you can show me hard numbers that actually show more people logged in than normal. Until then, the burden of proof is on you to prove it's a good thing, since existing data shows us that it's not.
---
Is it the feelings again?
---
Brought this to corp thunderdome last night. Man that was trolly. Thanks for the fit.
---
The group with overwhelming super superiority should be able to roll over a small group. This is already how it is, as that group also has the same superiority in subcap numbers. The problem lies with wars between groups that have a closer more even match, but too many advantages for a defender, making blueballs commonplace where it should be a great battle. UALX would have never happened if tenebrex existed in july of last year. CCP has done a great job with the issue years back, where superior groups could hold space 3-5 regions away from their main deployment system, they have done great in that regard. The massive superior force can roll through and burn everything, but in order to hold it all they have to really occupy it, which is really good. The north has really opened up to a lot of smaller groups.
---
I think the best way to fix large supercap numbers is to make them kill each other more often and keep the windows of escalation open. This makes for great publicity too, eve videos with millions of views and pcgamer/forbes articles aren't written about fights between battleships. That is just how it is.
---
If you make them take and hold more space it will make them more vulnerable and cause more conflict.
---
o7 julianus I have been flying with you and recommended GMVA , has always been a pleasure flying under your flag
---
Before my time.  It sounds cool.  How did it fail?
---
That's pretty much all that's left for them in the current meta, and VNIs are about to go away. Rattlesnakes aren't very common anymore but caps, rorqs and supers are.
---
goatse
---
Thank you, I will look into that.
---
As with everything, they have their niche use, but they're currently sitting fairly uncomfortably outside the meta, with just about every vanilla BS.
---
They're just a bit too slow to be useful and a bit too outside the scope to have people train into them. However, with Naga doctrines becoming a thing again, the Rokh might see a resurgence, but probably not on the large scale as the Naga is basically its cheaper, faster, easier to fly baby brother.
---
hi im 9days old i have 0experience in pve but some in pvp i teach you u teach me?!
---
&gt;It's the ongoing maintenance and carebearing that becomes an issue when a group spreads out more. Who gets the good space? Who gets the prime protection?
---
You realize these are pretty trivial to handle, right?
---
At most, you're developing a situation where alliances or corps jump between large blocs looking for a better deal.  Striking out on their own would result in being crushed.
---
&gt;Structures still cost fuel and maximum efficiency require expensive rigs. Who gets the preferred and rigged structure time?
---
Everyone.  We'll just build more structures.
---
Legacy's dropping Keepstars in our war against Frat like small alliances drop Mobile Depots.  The resources available to a large bloc are enormous and would remain enormous even if you force us to use two regions.
---
&gt;Yes, the masses could have the skill-based tools, but can they use them effectively?
---
They can easily recruit an "elite" group(s) from within that would vastly outnumber a smaller alliance's entire roster.....and they already do.
---
&gt;They have made progress in nullsec hunting
---
\[Citation Required\]
---
You're declaring victory waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too soon.
---
&gt;The sp and isk investment of running 4+ accounts is not insignificant like you suggest. None of the ships are cheap, and the less you use the more they generally will have to cost.
---
For you maybe, PLEX + injectors are a thing.
---
Its useable not optimal. Most of the stuff it can bridge through its portal are cheaper tankier more dpsy. My black ops are all fit to ecm neut and runaway. Their entire for being is to bridge follow at the end warp and hide to bridge rest out.
---
Learn to scan and go plunder lowclass space.
---
LOL who'd have thought
---
Due to the way eve is, anything you do to help small gangs, will also help the big gangs. So unless there's a direct nerf to big alliances only, big alliances will always benefit from a change made to favor small gangs.
---
Noone called me mean names this week. No local has changed my playstyle (sperging like a tard in every system)
---
that would make ratting in general a lot safer.
---
cant light cynos in gated dedspace, just keep a cloaked alt on the gate to warn you of anyone comming to pvp you. no ratting caps/supercaps to dreadbomb
---
That won't work because people get off on killing bots and all they would have to do is look for gate watchers and then stick a cloaky in that system???
---
Players overmine for 2+ years. Minor nerfs to the mining ships didn't stop them, could have just reduced the anom respawns to 1/6 slower forcing said miners to leave their safety area. Instead they try listening to the pvpers and remove local. Now everyone blobs so hard pvpers can't get in edgewise. 
---
Players spam structures at an alarming rate for over 2 years. Instead of putting some kind of fee, or cap, or any other limitation on placement, said structures couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag and get killed even easier now by fewer ships (as few as 1) 
---
Players complain about capitals being everywhere, but rather than limited how much everywhere capitals can be, capitals are nerfed, making it harder for the small guys to use them.
---
Players complain about bots, be they market bots, mission bots, salvage bots, mining bots, ratting bots, intel bots, ect. Instead of actually taking the steps to remove bots from the game permentaly, CCP nerfs drone boats repeatedly and shadow nerfs mission runners to only do level 3 or under missions.
---
Players complain that small groups/gangs are struggling. CCP instead makes jump fatigue shorter, introduces no fatigue jump gates and 
---
**CCP may listen**, but they sure aren't showing any indication they listen to anyone but a pure pvp player.
---
I dont' get it.  If a couple of handfuls of pilots with a decent fleet comp (combined arms), decent FC, and competent pilots is facing a carrier...   I want the carrier to fucking LOSE!
---
That one player should be able to counter a bunch of  competent players who brought a decent fleet comp and flew it well, all because  "carriers; hurr durr", is dumb game design.
---
Maybe don't spend hundreds of billions of isk on rigs if you are a small alliance that wants to be somewhat nomadic?
---
I did this for over 4 hours and not a soul even tried to kill me.
---
\o        wait...
---
Then quit bearing around the bush and make a ship that does literally nothing but act as a covert jump bridge. 
---
Having blops as something that pretends to do anything else while being horribly inept at it is just shameful, it's like ratting with a marauder when carriers are an option, the T2 battleships are just redundant at best.
---
and how much more logical is it that a single rifter should be able to keep a supercarrier or titan tackled?
---
&gt; You'd absolutely have to allow them to receive remote reps for that to be viable.
---
Didn't they already change this the other month, I don't do entosis but I'm sure I remember a change where the entosiser can now receive reps?
---
&gt; You realize these are pretty trivial to handle, right?
---
Okay. :)
---
&gt; Legacy's dropping Keepstars in our war against Frat like small alliances drop Mobile Depots. The resources available to a large bloc are enormous and would remain enormous even if you force us to use two regions.
---
CCP could address that.
---
&gt; They can easily recruit an "elite" group(s) from within that would vastly outnumber a smaller alliance's entire roster.....and they already do.
---
TEST has a decent AT history, Goons does not. I played with a TEST dude at the recent Eve North tourney. Not every group has a large body of "elite" players.
---
&gt; You're declaring victory waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too soon.
---
That wasn't a declaration of victory. That was declaring progress. Some progress is better than no progress. Time will tell. There's no way of knowing whether CCP can truly drive a wedge into large coalitions, or if it even wants to. But that's the only way you solve the largescale nullsec warfare issue of being n+1 and TiDi snorefests.
---
Do you ever feel like you have been widowed down to nothing ? :V
---
or they just pm the fleet boss and say "hey is there any cloaky ship in fleet in my system?"
---
Mixed feeling on this one, its good for brawling pvp (VNI will be a monster brawler) becomes redundant for PvE and kite/nano based pvp.
---
Some SRP is great but it's situational, some have little to no SRP. And if you are renting, gotta pay the bills. That would be my goal tho, to be so good at PvP that it sustains me, but I'm not there yet. In the end we are in the same boat, subbing, buying Plex, and doing what we can to make more isk to keep going. Look at the monthly economic report for June, and pay attention to the one for July when it comes out. ISK generation in null is gone, wars played a part. But with things going the way they are, you just won't see the numbers and ships you once had in null.
---
Wow. Thank you for that truly insightful comment. How could I have overlooked this solution which is totally not also a significant investment of SP and ISK.
---
They basically worked by having cavernous Ship Maintenance arrays, with the idea that they could bring re-ships for anyone who gets popped.
---
Also, Titans and Rorquals were given cloning bays in an attempt to make it so you could jump/deathclone the players to them, and they'd pick up their ships from Titan/Mothership/Rorq.
---
The problem is if the battle has reached the point where you're reshipping mid-battle, it's reached the point where you need to retreat.
---
And cloning bays didn't work well enough for people to use them for mining ops (buggy, could only use the clone when that Rorq pilot was online, etc)
---
I used to think so too.  The Blackout give me hope.  VNI nerfs give me hope.
---
I can tell you that I have had a blast during blackout, and I was in the "Eve is dying crowd" before then.  Love ya Scrogz, but the fact that AFK'ing my 5 Rorquals was even viable was sad for Eve's longevity.  I will gladly dock up my alts, and go back to a reasonable amount of characters if it means that Eve and Brand Newbros last another 5 years+.  The way things were going, that wasn't going to happen.
---
You really should come on, hang out, and try Blackout.  It has brought the corp closer together and teamwork actually matters again.  Isk and ore are gaining in value, Excavs/Rorqs are cheaper.
---
buy one from one of the public keepstars or on the eve forums
---
Uhhh, what?
---
But PLEX with cash, sell for ISK, buy injectors + ships.
---
No doubt. I can't reach see how you justify solo blopsing anything besides DED runners anymore. The isk investment for an anom farmer is pretty low, especially when you compare it to that of a blops
---
&gt;suicide heavy bomber
---
you mean shadows ?
---
Thanks for Jack Fit, will try and compare with that I'm currently using.
---
&gt;\~1 month old char

&gt;Jackdaw  
---
&gt;Something's fishy.
---
Well, skill injector is a thing. I'd looked into my zkb, first death by NPC (during tutorial) is in 11th of June.
---
The standing fleet in Goons is large enough to blanket 3 regions.  TEST can easily do two.  NC/PL could also similarly expand.
---
The "more conflict" would last only long enough for a large bloc to conquer the space.  Then the conflict would be over.
---
dreadnoughts and stealth bombers would like to have a word with you
---
o shit its havish and the welpies
---
I know right, imagine a fucking frigate dying to a super capital. Shit is crazy. Un-fucking-believable if you ask me. Basically what's killing the game.
---
I heard Malpais has nice weather.
---
Your mean we've finally done it? We've actually achieved the blue doughnut? Thank God, I'm finally going to see my family again.
---
Thank you
---
Multi-monitor is important. From there personally, as long as you can assess situations quickly it's not hard to do.
---
Also, priorities. Logi is more important than scanning when a fight starts.
---
All in all its really fun
---
&gt; They'll just switch to dscan and have an acceptable loss
---
Haha.  The issue for the bots will be the fact that you can 100% counter them with a single Blops hunter in a world without local.  They have zero ways to know which systems are safe, and some people like Marshy have enough alts to cover an entire region alone.  I do not expect bots to disappear, but it will be difficult for them to be cost effective with anything bigger than a cruiser before being discovered.  Carrier and super bots should be dead.
---
See, I feel like you just like sitting under a security blanket.
---
There is still more to be done, some more treatments required. Cap proliferation is an issue, but some solutions I see people suggest are insane. It is just as simple as fixing jammer mechanics then you'll start seeing them burn in fires ten-fold.
---
&gt;There was a chance to actually cripple Goons by following them to Delve before they could build a fortress
---
This would have led to the exact same fucking shit we are in now. Just sooner
---
&gt;You also had a chance to somewhat reset the animosity you developed with what are now the Legacy alliances over the years of farming them.
---
What is it now? Did we krab or did we farm you? Also, why would we buddy up with you? We want conflict. Not that you dinobrains would understand that.
---
&gt;Actions have consequences, and they aren't "revenge boners".
---
You are mad that we broke the coalition that was meant to be temporary from the start. You are mad that we didn't kill the game after WWB. Now you want to destroy us at all costs. Sounds a lot like a revenge boner to me.
---
&gt;You vastly underestimate the hatred you've inspired.
---
Nope. But I doubt goon leadership is going to force it's FCs and line members to invade one of the most easily defensible regions in the game with supply lines stretching across half the map. Especially at the risk of PanFam pulling another Tribute and just leaving empty structure bashes.  Or they do and burn out within a few weeks with no progress at all made.
---
&gt; With no help coming from the North, the best option is relatively friendly diplomacy with Goons against our common foe.
---
Goons invading you because they lack better targets is not upon you to decide. If you honestly believe they are not going to do that, then I'm sorry to burst your bubble.
---
Y’all are all sleeping on the torpedo Widow.
---
I have enough cognitive overload triple boxing matching ships in the same role...
---
Maybe it takes a lot of practice.
---
Sorry maybe I'm not following. By paying real money for Plex to sell, to get injectors and ships, you're suggesting that means it's *not* an investment?
---
&gt; your vegan PvP.
---
Dang
---
I'm stealing that one
---
Yeah, I'll accept it.
---
Hey everyone, I'm racist against bots. Stupid me, send me to the gulag for my wrong-think.
---
If people got off on killing bots that much, they'd have been killing plenty of bots before blackout.  A simple login trap does the job.  Instead, people didn't kill all that many bots, and decried how not-fun it was to do so.
---
Also, your "cloaky" causes the bot to dock in that system.  The one tethered to a Raitaru on the gate's grid stays out.  If you do a login trap for that bot, you're back to where we were pre-blackout when people weren't hunting bots all that hard.
---
Are you sure your girlfriend isn't actually your boyfriend?
---
I got you fam, can't stop the signal
---
A Mega Incursion to rebalance null sec? This gets my vote!
---
Maybe a fast tracking high slot module that allows Frigates or Destroyers exceptional tracking against drones/fighters?
---
Oh cool, didn't know that, i was reading the description and it didn't state it :D so thought it couldn't :)
---
&gt;Skill injectors
---
Skills need to just go.
---
You get skills by spending $ on sub time or $ on injectors. Or both.
---
The only reason skills build time-based, is because it creates an incentive for players to log back in because "the skill queue runs out" and "next week I'll gain 5% small explosive dps!".
---
It's a dumb trick eve doesn't need anymore and I wish people would stop defending it.
---
I use Eve-O Preview hotkeys to swap clients. Bound to side buttons on my mouse.
---
Thanks, I suppose that you are referencing to hacking data/relic sites?
---
I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a penis but I will double check
---
poor dinobrain thinks removing local means he can't play how he wants anymore as if it's illegal.
---
I've seen too many people say that you won't be ganked so long as the math doesn't add up.
---
But, as in my miasmos example where I was killed by several *battlecruisers* - some people will eventually get bored enough where if you're there, they'll try to kill you, and profit be damned.
---
... So as a counter to this, I want to point out no matter how slight, there is a chance someone *will* be crazy enough to gank you, even in a triple bulkheaded freighter carrying nothing.
---
For starters, capitals are no longer allowed in rat anomalies.
---
No, I’m just arguing with you, perhaps you missed the sarcasm, no worries though.
---
Imagine losing an argument and trying to boast over a trash killboard, lol.
---
I don't think it would accomplish much. As soon as they notice that their sandcastle is getting kicked over and nothing else, they'll evacuate everything expensive/important and just retake their systems once the storm is weathered.
---
No, its part of the cost and dynamics of owning a citadel and I do not believe this would cause anymore fighting.
---
Just ignore him, the dude has been going down the whole thread making snide comments to make himself look leet at the expense of others. Trolls gonna troll, don't feed him.
---
Dreadnaughts and Stealth bombers word on the matter is that they die to supers in a ratio that more than heavily favors the supers.
---
huh?
---
Who in gods name fits people to their ship
---
They did, yes.
---
It seems unlikely youll ever be able to get them in the amount to really contest against a larger group with current mechanics
---
Let me guess, you're also just pretending to be retarded, like you pretended to have any clue about blops?
---
tldr version https://i.imgur.com/nDtEXbu.gifv
---
I remember one group doing a meme blackbird roam years ago, RPing as the police and using nonlethal weapons (ecm) to neutralize hostile ships. No guns, just jams and memes.
---
Do I need some sort of a month subscription or to buy dlcs to play everything that this game have to offer?
---
I always found it weird that blops ships couldn't covops cloak.
---
Like the cloaked velocity bonus is hilarious when you're at the point that you can literally move faster cloaked than uncloaked but i would have traded that in an instant for the ability to warp under cloak
---
I disagree that it is, but I dont disagree with your ideas for the cyno Jammers and that they need a nerf.
---
Bad bot
---
25%? You’re completely out of your mind.
---
inb4 CCP gets bought by GabeN
---
&gt;CCP could address that.
---
Not if you want small alliances to be able to drop anything.
---
&gt;TEST has a decent AT history, Goons does not.
---
They'd have to care about the AT to bother fielding a good team.  It's not like the AT helps empire build.
---
&gt;That wasn't a declaration of victory. That was declaring progress.
---
Then you're declaring progress waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too soon.
---
Right now, botters are either implementing a gate watcher or waiting to see if CCP turns off blackout.  The longer blackout goes, the more they're going to implement a gate watcher.
---
I read a great analogy about this: when POS sov ended, all sorts of people declared that finally the game wouldn't be dominated by large blocs because of all the POSes those blocs could make....forgetting that the large blocs could do better with SBUs and the rest than any small group.
---
You're doing the same thing on bots.  Bots are the entities that can adapt the easiest to blackout.  They're the only ones that can perfectly watch every gate 23.5/7.
---
I think ccp was clear on their use. They dont have t2 resist and again they do less dmg then the t1 hull and tank worse. Again they have a role and it's an effective, it doesnt mean you cant use it  for direct combat it's just not generally a good idea.
---
I disagree that they should roll over them entirely without any losses.
---
I got the email too and said no offers available when I went to log in. I think it was another bad email sent
---
The Eris is so irrelevant that you thought it was called the Heretic lmao
---
Not to mention the potential for a passive tank that could make a Wyvern blush.
---
shout out to every independent alliance who doesn't need a mega blob and a bat phone tariff to get stuff done o7
---
Gotcha cool.  So why are Nagas coming back?  The blackout making them more viable?
---
No, I'm just able to think through what the people who made a supercap umbrella would do.
---
All T2 BS need huge buffs to be honest. Their price vs capitals is way too high for so little effect. Make marauders have upsides beyond their bastion tank and give blops something more to play with.
---
But what if you can only afford internet because your internet is free because you work for the internet company?? :big thinky:
---
Try the "No Stupid Questions" sticky at the top of this subreddit.
---
Pretty sure you need to be uncloaked when the rat dies to receive the bounty
---
Cool post. Thanks for sharing opinion... just might be enough for me to hop in and really dive deep enough to check out how the changes are effecting things.
---
Far more rorqs and supers were being killed on a daily basis before the blackout than after the blackout. Rorqs are also using mining drones more now due to the blackout instead of excavs leading to less isk kills. The more kills that happen, the more organized groups will become so if kills are already less than pre-blackout, they will be exponentially less once null has fully adapted. 
---
Elite PVP groups like Olmecas will always be able to adapt and get some kills but they won't be as easy as before. The average PVPer or solo PVPer will not be able to adapt as well to deal with the tougher targets. This has happened in the past, people say something will hurt null blocks so they cheer it when infact it only makes them stronger. No amount of free SP for logging in will make the statistics show that the blackout is resulting in overall more kills of PVE targets. PVE activity will be down in the short term due to people waiting it out or rewriting their bots but in the long run, it will be more than ever with super raters replacing VNI ratters and rorqs continuing to reproduce like rabbits.
---
Sansha and Blood Raiders would like a word.
---
Exploration doesn’t need a cloak if you do it right. Also if it costs low amounts...like 1 LO per 2 min cycle, then what’s the problem? LO is cheap and exploration makes billions.
---
That's obviously communism
---
Really makes you think.
---
Celestial pings ftw
---
"You can literally drop 50 dreads"
---
ahh, small gang in 2019.
---
Really though, when were BLOPs last rebalanced beyond jump fuel changes?  They need a balance pass to make them viable as something more than an expensive jump bridge.
---
😂
---
15$/month for subscription to gain access to all the skills and ships in the game. Although it is possible to get the subscription by in game currency (isk) but it's gonna be hard and probably you're just going to burn yourself out and quit because of that. With proper knowledge, skills and investment later on you can "plex" your account without paying any money. But again, if you are able to invest the 15$ a month (it gets cheaper of you get 3, 6 or 12 month sub) then it's the easiest way to enjoy the game
---
(citation needed)
---
Idk... They started selling skillpoints so that isn't helping.
---
To me it looks like they don't know what do about the game so they're just trying to shake things up and see what happens.
---
While I am no expert, could we make an upper limit on skill injectors? Or restrict certain skills? Skills like capital turret, carrier, dreadnought, invulnerability core, capital industrial, titan, etc are skills you can NOT inject. You must train those the old fashion way.
---
Go to bed Hilmar.
---
&gt;K$5ha
---
What is this abomination
---
recruiting btw.
---
Wormholers are used to probing and mapping out chains, it's part of our daily routine. 
---
I don't see this as a buff to wormhole life, it would just be a buff to k-space people finding your wormhole more easily.
---
People think reddit is the consensus and move from there. Anyone who disagrees will get down voted.
---
Look at all these retards in r/eve latching on to 1 questionably 'decent' change by CCP and proclaiming EVE to be saved. You're really dumb if you genuinely think this was the only or even the biggest problem that EVE faces. It's not. Not by a long shot.
---
Go roam around in null-sec looking for relic sites in whichever T1 exploration frigate you can fly: Magnate, Heron, Imicus or Probe.
---
You might die to hunters, or gate camps, or $random-reason; that doesn't matter. The ship is so cheap that a site or two can pay it tenfold.
---
I recommend that you find some systems reasonably close to empire space and drop off your first few sites' worth of loot immediately just so you have a couple hundred million in the bank for when you inevitably explode. 
---
After that, roam around for however long you feel comfortable flying with hundreds of millions in your cargo hold before dropping off the cargo.
---
Ratting in a subcap is pretty shit ISK, it's mainly done as an AFK activity requiring about 5 inputs every 30 minutes. Explo doesn't require much in terms of skills and can give you enough money / h -- while probably teaching you some basics of survival in New Eden -- to quickly finance other things, whether that be seeding some trading assets or buying you ships to blow up in FW or on solo roams.
---
Pando just got an erection and doesn't know why...
---
If injectors get cheaper but capitals get more expensive in return, it may entice more players to inject for cheaper ships.
---
Rofl
---
That would be one of the pros of the idea, wouldn't it?
---
I never said they should win without loss. I would love to see a force with a 30 to 70 ratio stand a chance if they can outplay, out maneuver the enemy, for sure! But some people want a 1 to 50 force ratio to stand a chance when it is totally unrealistic. At that point you turn the game into league of legends and not a space warfare simulator.
---
That's a good thing.  Wormholers want the game to be as difficult and dangerous as possible.  More traffic in your hole ticks both these boxes.
---
Anom-based wormhole connections are a fine idea, but I wouldn't have that replace the current system
---
the current system is good
---
but having a secondary system with lower stakes (smaller mass, duration, etc) would be fine, and a nice release valve for WH residents who don't want to put up with the scanning requirement on any given night
---
Probably unpopular opinion: It's shit as a direct result of the ECM changes. BLOPS ECM ships were gutted, falcon included. The Falcon/Widow used to have niche uses that still made them viable, but with the ECM changes, made them useless. Falcon could grab a solo target and survive through the cyno even with the tank of a sheet of paper. The widow had a spot in BLOPs fleets to jam fighters and allow a smaller gang to take on carriers.
---
Both niche roles were gutted when ECM was changed to a taunt. When a ship with no tank is the one doing the taunting, it doesn't end well...
---
But TEST members on Reddit ( /u/tellur86 &amp;&amp; /u/Aktilos ) told me there would be no \~real\~ fight because TEST have too many blues.

Is Suitonia faking this video? Such a shame TEST can't change the situation they are in :(
---
I think there's a new guy in the Sending the Email department at CCP HQ.

I was going to ask a question about it myself.  Also I heard about some other deal, which is 3 months of MCT when you buy a 3 month sub.  One of those "apply once only" deals.
---
It’s actually not if you stop and think with your brain.  The big three coalitions have a profit sharing arrangement.   They may not agree on much but do agree Volta are colossal pussies.  
---
I fail to see concern here
---
I like the idea of smaller, shorter lived anom cruiser holes too. +1
---
I hope this works for Abyssal...
---
I think no one would argue this
---
sounds like some good isk,  I will have to give this a ahot, thanks very much!
---
What if wormholes had local, wormholes are supposed to be more safe than nullsec after all
---
I saw that deal... however the next day it was gone :'(
---
More targets too!
---
*MasL intensifies*
---
&gt; They have zero ways to know which systems are safe
---
Take a small system, get a bot to ping Dscan every 5s, log everything on after downtime and keep pinging. Voila.
---
Carrier and super sure, but regular people will stop doing them without umbrellas as well. So other then the 2 pockets there's people going to be doing cheap stuff. Ratting will likely go down as a result, and if isk value goes up with it it'll be cost effective for them to do stuff like that.

---
I am a member of a big null block and have only tried solo hunting a few times. It has been disheartening to jump into a system and find the VNI/Ishtar POSed up by the time I finish dscanning. With the new blackout changes, I figured I'd take another crack at it. 
---
It wasn't long before I found my first victim, an AFK VNI. I dispatched him with ease and hurried on to my next target. 
---
I find another VNI and I know I showed up on his dscan range as I entered system, but he keeps on ratting. I get next to him and watch him from my cloaky loki named Fe2O3. He is happily ratting and I have a nervous feeling. 
---
Does he know I am here, is he bait, am I being hunted? I wait for his orbit to bring him towards me. My breath quickens, my heart races, I decloak and wait out the 5s delay anxiously. 
---
Point! 
---
Web! 
---
My HAMs start ripping into his explo hole. 
---
DSCAN: Nothing.
---
DSCAN: Nothing. His armor falls, and recovers, falls some more.
---
And then it happens, a stratios decloaks next to me. They are trying to make my HAM loki into a ham sandwich. 
---
My hands shake as I align out. I press warp. I try to warp again. WARP DAMMIT!
---
I make it out! My hands are sweaty even as I relay this story to you. EVE felt risky again. I feel like a fresh player again. I feel alive. 
---
As I calm my nerves and run away with my tail between my legs, I am not deterred. I look for another victim. I pause as I move close to an Ishtar....Is this bait, is this another trap? 
---
I hold my breath as I decloak. I surgically get point and web. HAMs a blaze, he pops his ADC and I wait... No Cyno, DSCAN clear. As his kill mail pops up, he had a deadspace prop and repper. He also had a cyno and scram, but I played it perfectly and he couldn't stop me.  
---
I loot and slink away from system, never knowing who else was looking at me. The blackout cuts both ways.
---
It's gone?  WTF? I was going to advantage myself with it next week.
---
came to ask how to make decent isk, got my post deleted. 
---
thanks
---
Just get rid of the cloaking support systems, nobody’s gonna wanna cloak this thing anyway. It’s a battleship!
---
Agreed in the sense of the VNI and alpha changes. However, if you think bots can't just rewrite their programs to deal with the blackout, you don't know botting. The end result of the blackout will be tougher targets hiding under a super umbrella. Instead of afk VNI ratting, you will see more super ratting. Instead of afk rorq mining with excavs, you will see afk rorq mining with mining drones which aren't much worse in yield so once they are scaled higher, will result in more mining. 
---
I am encouraged and optimistic at CCPs intent to solve the problem. They hit it on the mark with the VNI and alpha changes but swung and missed with the blackout, though I do applaud the effort. The intent is clear to combat the bots and uncontrolled inflation. I have no idea how they will be able to solve the problem but hope they will think thing through more in the future. 
---
I cannot envision any changes that would stop people in null from rapidly building supers, titans, and rorqs. Therefore, I think the changes need to focus on finding ways for them to actually be used in combat more frequently instead of as a deterrent and actually die when they are used. I see titans eventually being used like suicide dreads. It will still suck that you will need titans to counteract them but at least they will be used and die instead of infinitely multiplying and collecting dust as they move from staging to staging. 
---
TLDR: **We need changes to make people less risk averse, not more. Good job with the VNI and alpha changes but swing and a miss on the blackout. Applaud the intent and effort though.**
---
I remember when all the people complained about PANIC and fighter changes and EWAR fighters and capitals locking subcaps faster than other subcaps and the response from the nullbears was "eat shit and die"  
---
The pendulum swings (not nearly enough), time for them to take their lumps.
---
&gt; and I was in the "Eve is dying crowd" before then
---
Do you seriously mean to tell me that you thought that local was the reason EVE is dying?
---
Real problem is citadel spam. Prove me wrong
---
&gt; but players leaving nullsec doesn't have to be a bad thing.
---
xD
---
\*delete wormholes entirely
---
My guess is that it will be through the agency, and it will have those sub goals for the event where when you have completed one it will have a cooldown timer that triggers for 12-24hrs to cap the max you can get per day
---
Breaking gate cloak and recloaking is like a 5 sec delay despite the graphics
---
Delet eve
---
Right, gotta make sure it's all evened up so both sides look like selfish bitches. Makes sense to me.  (also, as I recall carriers and rorquals have been nerfed a combined 15 time in two years each to a chorus of yeeeee-boyyy from the Chessur clones)
---
I've heard this a lot and to be honest it's such a BS comparison. NCPL once lost anchoring keepstar to multiple subcap fleets and then 2-3 supers and a titan(?) upon the extraction simply because their super fleet couldn't reach targets on the massive keepstar grid. Even if we look at the imperium supercapital fleet numbers - there are still limitations to what they can do, and you can just take a gate to another system and be relatively safe from them (if they already have jump reactivation timer) and possibly be out of TiDi.   
---
Sure you can blueball people with them and shoot some structures but we live in the era of 1 day anchoring sandcastles so no big deal if you lose a few.
---
Just started playing a week ago, and I'm just so happy with it. I had an account from 2012 but didnt think it was very fun back then. Having asked questions in rookie help and getting people adding me to friends has been an eye opener. A guy sat with 3 large ships in a fleet with me for over an hour and taught me mining/protected me. Was just such a big thing, it's hard to explain the feeling.
---
Report back
---
Nice convenient choice of goalposts there.  Did it ever occur to you that raw numbers of logins don't mean a healthy game if large chunks of them are avoiding all player interaction in this ostensible MMO?  40 afk VNIs logged in is not better for the game than 20 active players.  CCP benefits from the game not dying a stale, krab-induced death far more than they do from a few extra subs.
---
&gt;an incentive for players to log back
---
That's literally backwards. The time based component allows you to set a very lengthy skill plan and log out. You aren't forced to grind in the game for hours long sessions to push the skill up, your game play is not tied to the hours you log in.
---
I'm all about getting rid of injectors, though.
---
Hilmar and I have actually been talking to eachother a lot more about EVE recently, given that we're both vets from release.
---
There's been some pretty cool chatter between people at CCP in the last couple of months, very interested to see how it materialises in future.

To elaborate on cap, zealot gets 5% rof but 10% reduction to cap

---
good shout actually, upvoted
---
probably printed out and then a bunch of hearts are drawn on it particularly around Naz's name
---
She's not \_that\_ famous.  Almost nobody talks about her in Eve.
---
Exactly. People fucking write bot programs to fly burner missions in venal, they can write bots that provide intel about what jumps through a gate where lol. All about other changes.
---
The patch that added HAW weapons, fighter bombers, and gave supercaps a huge EHP boost was too much. I personally think the EHP boost was what did it. Supercaps became so much stronger then regular caps and would obliterate sub cabs. I miss when the meta focused on subcaps more.
---
The main issue with your thinking.  You say people can't effect large coalitions. That isn't true at all. If people stopped being whiney and afraid of a fight,  then the space could be conquered, but both sides are guilty of not pushing hard enough.  Imperium sacked tribute,  but didn't conquer it.  In my opinion, that was wrong.
---
And why injectors should only be allowed on sub capital mods and ships. Not for any capital skill or mod
---
If the game isn't different then why did you cancel. Oh wait.

Burners and DEDs is what i do as a single box dude.

---
Let's go back to the original comment and use these brains of ours. 
---
"Is there anyone Test hasn't blued at this point?" it says. There is very little about Volta in this comment. At least from what I can tell, the question concerns TEST. Further using this referenced brain, I sense an underlying implication about TEST, that being that they are prone to ally up with anyone they can. While this is certainly exaggerated and by all means not definitely true, as the OP video shows, there's cause for concern as this kind of behaviour/gameplay killed the chinese server. While you of course will disagree with that outcome being a possible future one, you should be able to recognise the source for this referenced concern even though you disagree with it.
---
Agree. It needs more tank especially considering the changes to ECM. What's the point of making the target lock on only to you when you have less hp than a cruiser?
---
Damn, Test is even pre-emptively bending the knee these days
---
Except it (Alpha) has always been an unlimited trial, with heavy restrictions, such has longer training times and less available modules/ships/skills.
---
ALWAYS.
---
Right next to the button that says "play free" is a button that says "play premium".
---
Again, you get what you pay for.
---
I think it should also flash at me and make a noise if there's a new WH within 5 jumps. thanks
---
Greatest copypasta of all time
---
You don't have to fly to it you can just skip the wormhole entirely from gate and go straight in. You can also cyno from inside.
---
There agree some benefits, and drawbacks to being in a large corporation like Dreddit. The biggest pro, to me, is that being casual is okay, so long as you're trying. I've got a busy life and don't have tons of hours to spend on fleets. This slack is made up for by numbers. 
---
However those numbers can also make it hard for you. People often complain about getting lost in the shuffle of large groups. This was inde if the main reasons for starting our mentor program. 
---
Also remember, nothing is permanent. If the Corp you're in doesn't fit socially or with you're wanted play style, you are welcome to search out the group who you do fit with.
---
It would not turn it into league at all and unfortunately since some groups are that stupidly large it is necessary for some loss for the winners even at a 1 to 50 ratio.
---
i love nullsec blackout. it is fun and very good for friendship. yes, much friendship indeed. sending many hugs all day during blackout. yes yes, much hugs. much friends. many friends. Largest friends. making many friends during blackout. many friends have come to join the blackout party. friends making more friends bring huge friends get friendlier friends. long live the friendly blackout of friendship.

It is mind boggling that the area for new players to start pvping and be content in space has such negative consequences/disincentives.

Until you click the link, and right beside the "play free" button is the "play premium" button.
---
This was a fun fight. A little casual, but it was good entertainment
---
You don't need probes to warp to cosmic anomalies - cosmic anomalies and anomalies are different categories. The majority of lowsec anomalies are ones you need to scan down - and there are even ore anomalies there. Mining off of an athanor in lowsec is extremely safe as well, you still have local and can just fit two sensor boosters in the lows with neuts in the high slot to make most things either drop tackle or bugger off.
---
And no - you don't NEED structures. Players got along fine without them for a very long time, as far as my bittervet ass is concerned they're a new extremely cushy development. I'm used to a POS that will shoot you because it has glitchy code when you don't warp straight into the bubble.
---
If you don't want to put effort into things, don't play this game. This game is one that rewards the amount of effort you put into it. Highsec is a place for little effort, lowsec is a place for moderate, and null is a place for high effort and risk. Even then there are many alliances that live in tiny lowsec pockets that have 20-30 athanors in that one system that do nothing but mine and people just leave them alone. If you don't like how nullsec is right now, go elsewhere. it's not like you can't make 100m/hr churning through L4's in highsec, or running incursions.
---
TL;DR - A thriving playerbase is what we already have even with this blackout.
---
If they land in site, it’s a 100% confirmation anyways.
---
I think we should have fluctuating security status. Concord getting dunked on by the same NPCs we do like trigs and drifters causing the security status of systems to always be changing unless we help. Then put an fightable Concord in low sec so we can help drop the security if we want or help Concord and raise it. Wanna drop Capitol ships on highsec go to war with Concord. Wanna stop goons from dunking on you all the time help Concord get the sec status of the system up.
---
The post is literally by Volta about Volta.  The comment is a beaten to death meme on test bluing all of eve which they’re no worse than any of the big three.  Further, they’re all fighting various wars against one another. 
---
Further further eat my ass.
---
Diplomatic agreements not to invade one another's sov or enact in activities that are total dick moves (eg: cloaky camping) but otherwise gate camping, roaming, dread bombs/bomber fleets to blow up rorqs &amp; supers is DEFINITELY the same thing as being set blue in a big "donut".
---
There's totally no warfare going on in nullsec, nevermind Legacy vs FRT/Panfam, or the power vacuum in Tribute where smaller entities are enacting a Darwinion game of who will come out on top to control the region. Or let's just gloss over the fact about CCP dropping drifters on nullsec, stifling active wars and more than likely proving to be an inhibiting factor for starting any new ones what with whack-a-mole still in effect to have to avoid structures getting reffed constantly.
---
Volta's only goal with dropping Azbels with low tax rate isn't to make money, you'd be completely fucking naive to think that they give two fucks whatsoever about a 0.3% to 0.5% tax increase of the TTT. They're ISK negative already with the ship losses they take in the brawls over their timers. They are wormholers, who's fountains of ISK in their C6s are the stuff of legend. They don't give no fucks about money.
---
Their problem is that wormholes are so fucking safe that they're incredibly bored and starving for content. So they made up an excuse to drop troll Azbels in order to generate that content and have an outlet for their oceans of money. All the while leaning on the same old tropes of "blue donut" and the tax increase as a means to try and poke the bears into forming. Why should they care about nullsec bloc standings and NIPs, they are completely removed from that aspect of the game and have zero stake in the matter. It's all a show to generate fights and nothing more.
---
Link please?
---
*Don't let him find out you know!!*
---
I think the change needs to be how they move around besides jump fatigue. My thought would be jump spin up time and if cyno is destroyed before they finish and jump, they are flung randomly into constellation/system. Or jump is aborted but they still take fatigue hit. Probably give Jump Freighters a role bonus to severely reduce this. 
---
Thats my biggest issue with capitals, cyno goes up and bunch of ships show up with little warning ready to melt your face.
---
I'm suggesting that it's not necessarily a "significant investment" (your words) depending on your situation in the real world.
---
Honestly I wish it had an orchestral track instead of synth
---
&gt; unchecked Chinese botting
---
Yeah, there definitely weren’t any bots before the Chinese migrated from Serenity.  Not at all.
---
Agreed
---
Yeah, now actually look at what I've said: the first week's #s are the system shock. It's going to take a total of 3 weeks just to get the first useful data (2 data points for each day after the system shock period). And btw: The numbers for today, the 2nd Friday, are at or above the 2 weeks prior to the Blackout. Numbers started to hit parity about halfway through Thursday. So maybe don't draw conclusions yet?
---
Tenerifis.  Not hard to find.
---
There is already a great loss at that ratio....It is in the form of 'time', and 'fun' :P
---
What kind of loss should you expect at a 1 to 50 force ratio?
---
Bad logins &gt; no logins.
---
Would I prefer 10k more highly active people? Yes
---
Are AFK VNIs better than no logins? Yes
---
You can actively hunt those VNIs, they provide content. Maybe not as much content as another player, but they are still there. 
---
I also notice that you didn't provide any concrete evidence behind your response, just anecdotal evidence that doesn't conclusively prove anything. 
---
Prove me wrong with hard evidence.
---
90% of bots in Branch do this week. Expect it to become norm after VNI nerf hits live - and they all fly with a cyno fit.

Lmao

Lolwut

With pictures to prove it

You can do t1 in a t1 solo frigate like a breacher or a kestrel. Use missiles.

Unfortunately it only lasted for two days
---
Gallente master race.
---
what do they do when something is pinged on dscan?
---
does your system imply they would all dock until next downtime?
---
Implying hull pen could muster the competence to actually reinforce an undefended citadel
---
Well, at least they're eating Plex if they're using Ishtars. Cyno bots? Sounds like fun kills.
---
You've put quite a lot of thought into this, I'm impressed.
---
I would say you've hit most of the nails on the head here, and this could certainly be employed to stop afk plexing. But I do think PurityOfHerpes has a strong point in that new players shouldn't be getting that kind of punishment.
---
This would be a significant buff to wspace. You mean no one has to actually scan out their chain, you can just enter a hole, see how many connections there are, and chain them? Basically you map as fast as you warp? I get the idea behind what you're suggesting but I think it has some major pitfalls beyond kspace implications
---
Oh nice. You should probably be able to cyno from anywhere in the galaxy too, since wormholes can open anywhere.
---
Don’t forget to add links... pop them if you see yellow boxes and you may get lucky.

Mail says: Upgrade to Omega and get over 3x more free Skill Points during Bonus Skill Point Week! Act fast and make use of this limited time 25% discount on the 1 month package, available only until 11:00 UTC on 25 July
---
So basically "no u", alright.
---
This wouldn't reduce structure spam
---
The vast majority of structures in space don't have rigs. They simply aren't worth the investment for what you get out of them - you only start seeing them on larges &amp; above and even larges usually only get 1-2 max.
---
Rigs however, do need a bit of economic tweaking. They've been out for quite a while and only the most used of them have become cheap enough to warrant them(Tatara Reactor rig.) for anything other than the largest of alliances.
---
It's a bridge ship, hardly a battleship, it's going to draw all kinds of fire without a cloak. What, do you want me to put a sign on it in fifty languages, "I am a jump bridge not a combat vessel, please don't shoot me"?
---
I was thinking like, the cyno would just automatically navigate wormholes to get as close to where you're going as possible. So if you were in the drone lands and someone lit a cyno in delve, you could just go to that cyno through a wormhole chain
---
Fang-tastic

This ship was built to be rocked. I think we are all looking forward to what y'all have in store.

You did a lot of explaining about everything except how this proposed mechanics would actually WORK.

I don't care noob. I only disputed the statement that bots have no way of knowing which systems are safe. Don't change the subject.
---
CCP is not trying to fix your game, they're trying to fix the game.
---
One of us. One of us. One of us.
---
Redo soft ewar for highslots instead of mids and redesign carriers around SS duties and being ewar platforms (highslots ewar would also mean that blackbirds would actually be usable in shield fleets.)
---
aha, I do the same but with isboxer
---
To what? It's like a hundred guys, we figured we'd give them some space so maybe they'll grow into something we can reset and fight later. At least that's the official spiel, before I went back to Dreddit I fought em in lowsec a bit.
---
If you use eop or isboxer just use monitor capture instead of window and target your primary monitor
---
Oh, huh.
---
Just go through Naz’s post history, I am on mobile so I can’t link it. 
---
However, you really should read all 3 Brisc posts in order, they are all good
---
Nope.  Local has obviously existed since I played the game.  However, the overwhelmingly safety of sov null sec has turned Eve into a game that people play while they are playing another game.  It got boring.  Citadels, out of game intel capabilities of alliances (made possible by local), supercap umbrellas, new jump bridges, etc all made it possible to play Rainbow 6 while making the Isk for my titan.  It was always heading in this direction, but other changes CCP made meant that local needed to be changed or those other changes need to be walked back.  CCP is never going to take OP citadels away, so we are left with changing local.
---
I don't care. I only disputed the statement that bots have no way of knowing which systems are safe. Don't change the subject.
---
But sure, let me answer your stupid question anyway. If you want people to stop fucking with you, counter drop them. Do it succesfully a few times and you'll become 'that guy'; they'll leave you alone.
---
Glad to see you're recovering from the the penis size reduction surgery
---
Literal press F1 to navigate. For those who just press F1.
---
I'm not sure about the exact proposed changes, since they would need a lot of balancing to get right, but they are a good basis for spitaballing ideas and i agree 100% with the sentiment.
---
It's not even about wormoholers vs nullsecers. If you want to influence null bring caps, if you want to have fun and have fights, bring subcaps. It's like 2 different games in the same sandbox and it feels weird and disconnected. It's also the reason most of my original group quit the game back in 2006 or so.
---
I've argued about similar issues in another post, mainly the idea of interdiction in the military sense (there need to be supply lines so people can protect/attack them, you should be able to shoot and quickly shut down station services and so on, with less timers and structure grinding, etc). I also saw some interesting suggestions in a INN article about the blackout of all places, which argued in favor of returning supers to their original role of providing logistics and repairs, like movable stations for people to use a mobile staging. I wouldn't mind if motherships were a thing (in fact the supercarriers were originally called just that) at all, especially if there was enough of a role change to also adjust the cost. Dreads are for structure bashing, carriers are for killing enemy battleships that try to kill the dreads but apply badly to cruisers and below, and motherships are just a mobile citadel you can stage out of. If they were cheap enough, it would also entice roaming groups to put some more skin in the fight so to speak, and also act as an alternative to structure spam.
---
The whole issue is a can of worms, because for years CCP has tried to balance things out by applying band-aids, which often have unintended consequences down the line. And everytime something gets buffed, it's very hard to nerf back into a balanced state, because now people actually pay real money to skip the queue and sit in one of those ships. I don't know what would be the best way to solve all this (even though i do have a lot of ideas), but i do miss the time where you could force an alliance to disband by repeatedly hitting their miners, ratters and haulers, making their wallets run dry and their manufacturing grind to a halt. I think CCP should just set a vision of a meta to achieve first and then start applying the changes to make it so, instead of applying one-off fixes, buffs and nerfs without enough forethought on how they will affect other areas of the game. And like i said in my other post, hire a military historian. Large scale warfare in EvE is so static it's almost medieval in nature. It would be much more fun and fluid if we could instead replicate tactics from WW2 and onward, not to mention the effect it would have on spreading the fights out across more systems and helping reduce lag and tidi.
---
doesn't matter what game it is, if you and your opponent use the same equipment, its the one with the most equipment win. you either have to get more than your opponent, or fight when and where your opponent doesn't have more than you. i.e dreadbombing ratting supers and titans
---
the shadow fighter bomber have a suicide ability that deals massive damage to capitals
---
How does the removal of local remedy the cancer that is citadel mechanics, or supercap umbrellas, new jump bridges etc.?
---
How you gonna tell there's a guy cloaked 1AU off the gate d-scanning it?
---
The ability to warp while cloaked would make them push T3C hunters out and mean they don't need any support. I'd rather see them able to MJD while cloaked - and maybe have a cooldown bonus on it. Give them some on grid maneuverability instead of a cloaked warp. In lowsec their cloak makes them almost untouchable already.
---
I have been playing since November 2018 and I find myself at work thinking about EVE.  
---
Exploring, fitting out frigates, checking the market for deals warping across the map to pick them up.  Staying on the downlow, checking DOTLAN and Zkillboard for activity, being chased and getting away from others on the hunt.
---
Way too early to say if CCP is saving our game - I mean, they're the one's that were breaking it and making it die over the past what... 5+ years?
---
Now one change and it's "saved"?  Eve didn't just get religion nor a 2 week christian retreat where they've seen the light. (Bad metaphor but that's all I could come up with on short notice.)  Let's see if the issues that have been plaguing Eve for years, and some new one's they've created are turned around.  I agree move PVP is good for the game, yes it's a step in the right direction.  But I'm cautious since Eve's been taking bad steps for miles.... show me this is a REAL turn around and stop fucking things up though December and maybe I'll jump on the "CCP is saving our game" bandwagon.
---
10 dreads kill 1 super easy peazy. 10 - 20 stealth bombers kills a carrier easy peazy. if you cant win vs your enemies full strenght, fight him when and where he dont have his full strenght
---
Capital Proliferation is like Gun Control in America.
---
You can throttle production and limit access all you want, but the real problem is how many people that have Caps already.
---
&gt; Carrier and super sure, but regular people will stop doing them without umbrellas as well.
---
The good news is that carriers and supers are not the best way to get rich.  Honestly, they are a trap.  For the amount of SP, time, Isk, and attention, you can make far more Isk with far less effort just running VNIs/Ishtars.  You would be surprised to find out that the dude running the single super is probably way behind the guy running 3 Ishtars because the second guy can run them AFK 3x as long as the super pilot can while the super only makes 2x as much per hour.  I paid for my titan/super/rorquals with my VNIs and I did so much faster than I would have by going the traditional route.

I multibox across two screens though, I can't get it to swap to the currently active monitor when recording.
---
&gt; Short of just outright nerfing capitals, what's the solution?
---
Outright nerfing them *is* the solution. They should not be the auto-win button against all other ship classes, otherwise there's no reason not to use them. They're not meaningfully more expensive after insurance while being vastly more mobile (with cyno), doing vastly more DPS, vastly more tank, and generally being just better. Either something needs to happen to make them more expensive, or they need more meaningful counterplay and better defined roles.
---
&gt; Take a small system, get a bot to ping Dscan every 5s, log everything on after downtime and keep pinging. Voila.
---
Ok, congrats, you know the super got tackled, but so does the super.  This method won't prevent a single cloaky from killing any bots it wants within that system.  It will just tell you that it's happening, but so will the crying super pilot.

   Xxxx xx xx xxx x xxx xxxxx xxxxx. X        cc
---
yeh Thats an interesting one never encountered one of those before what has really surprised me in the past was an arty catalyst seemed like it would do all right.
---
they aren't friends mate.
---
In a sense they did. They along with a number of other null sec blocs set up coordinated ops to help pbc by attacking the tranquility side of an alliance that had a serenity alliance as well. 
---
https://youtu.be/qa31nDBsUJI 
---
Mentioned around 30 minutes in.
---
You are now losing EvE.
---
I cant speak for test as Ive never been a part of them, but there is certainly a perception that some larger null groups hoover up newbros to bolster their fleet numbers. Relying on sheer brute force and 'shoot this target' than fostering individual piloting ability. For some that's fine, for others it can be frustrating. That being said, i hear some larger blocs have some really impressive training programmes.
---
I personally found my footing in a small low sec faction war corp and never looked back. It all depends on what you want out of the game.
---
IDK I think it's probably just there as a big-dick move.
---
I figure Imperium is probably going to be the first to build it and just because they can not because it's worth it. That's what I would do with all that money.
---
You said bots have no way of knowing which systems are safe. This is a way of knowing. I don't care if it does or does not prevent anyone from killing anything. That's not what you said.
---
absolutely - picking gal or min shouldn't get you locked out of half of hisec and the two best trade hubs in the game
---
&gt; If people got off on killing bots that much, they'd have been killing plenty of bots before blackout. A simple login trap does the job. Instead, people didn't kill all that many bots, and decried how not-fun it was to do so.
---
Not quite.  Many log in traps were tried, many were successful.  Far more were not because the bot owner adjusts and moves the bot elsewhere or changes settings.  If I can simply leave a cloaky prospect in system and wait for the super to warp, the bot is dying.  Log in traps give notice, but beating the super to the next site, dropping an inhib, lighting cyno, and bringing in a kill fleet does not. 
---
If what you believe was true, explain why every time local breaks super bots feed?
---
You are correct in some of your points (hey, it's been a long time since last dabbled in those kind of fights), but surely the intention was not to make any smaller class of ship practically useless in comparison. What is interesting though is that you started playing just as i was quitting, so maybe more things got changed down the line to the tune of what you describe.
---
Initially though, capital ships were all about structure bashing and supporting or killing other caps. As for the massive carrier drone swarms, they were unintended and caused too much lag, that's why they were patched out of the game. It's the same reason for the changes to the drone interfacing skill, which initially was +1 drone in space per level and allowed even a thorax to spam about 10 drones at a time. So it's not really an example of capital mechanics, but a wider reaching case of careless design choices during the game's early days.
---
Caps were initially useless against anything that wasn't either a POS or another cap. How do you think we scored the first dread kill in the history of the game? The guy brought it out to brawl and lost it to a few battleships, supported by HACs/t2 BCs and t2 frigates. Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt43tpQWdAg
---
They fucked it up in the first place. Let them sort out their own mess before citing them as saviours first.
---
I quit EVE a long time ago, but I returned because CCP showed that they care about their game. Next up on the list is the blue donut problem. I'd like to see nullsec be more divided into little groups rather than big blocs. The problem is complicated, but it will end up beneficial for the game in the long run.
---
I am calling the police
---
Yes they are. They're a couple, one of them I've known for 15 years. He's helped me at my lowest and I'm more than happy to return the favor by spending marginally more on utilities and letting them have a spare room.
---
It used to be awesome before the ECM changes.
---
&gt; Drones 5 is a definite requirement for any drone boat
---
guristas btw
---
Let inhibitors affect PANIC too.
---
Aye, but that's before I could afford one.
---
I doubt that the Drifters and the Blackout are a good longterm solution, but something had to and still needs to change. The citadel and capital spam after the structure and Rorqual buffs has reached ridiculous levels.
---
Does it apply to sleepers too?
---
Fair observation.  Editing.
---
&gt;If what you believe was true, explain why every time local breaks super bots feed?
---
Because the bots weren't set up with gate watchers and similar features necessary for a no-local environment.
---
If blackout is permanent, they will add those features.
---
A change to Upwell rigs could greatly reduce number of needed structures.
---
Idk, wouldn't this make it harder to catch ratters with their pants down?
---
I have been waiting to be this excited for eve since 2006! the good ol days are back!
---
Now we just need to turn 0.0 bright with Christmas lights and we are set.
---
What skills should I train on my hauler alt after I am done training transportation related skills?
---
So far I did: PI &gt; T2 Transport Ships &gt; ???
---
They made it so alphas can't do level 4 and level 5 missions, because botters were doing them.
---
Fly dangerously! o7
---
They were nice.
---
Jump in and just permajam. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTf-tklFpw
---
If Dreads were viable "valhalla" glass cannons and CCP would introduce a subcapital vessel that is anti-capital (like stealth bombers are to subs); capital proliferation would at least require competent subcapital fleets to assist them.
---
Don't play EVE until you play Witcher 3.
---
Just make anomalies have to be scanned and give them warp gates. The inability to warp in at range safely now deters capital ratting heavily.
---
You have seen the BR at the end, haven't you? That wasn't a fight, it was a slaughter.
---
I mean, props to them for fighting outnumbered and I guess some of them can derive some happiness from being the underdog and not doing too badly, but can that really last? 
---
But please, feed us more ships, just don't delude yourself that this is a fight. It's the highsec equivalent of getting your T1 cruiser roam dropped on by a super umbrella.
---
As for us changing the situation? Why would we? To wage a war of attrition in highsec? To give up advantages until it's effectively a roll of the dice who gets to control the market until the next group comes around insisting that it's their turn to throw the dice?
---
I can't agree more with your reply. The fact that you've pointed out that all perspectives matter is a refreshing change from the one sided tribal drivel that usually seems to dominate reddit. 
---
I would have assumed that null sec generated more purchases as people buy plex to inject into capitals fairly often, but admittedly I'm not basing that on any real evidence.
---
I agree with your assessments and am impressed at the well thought out ways to tip the balance. However, I think if all of those were implemented, it would favor the small gangs too much. Groups as skilled as yours would always be successful in bringing down the ratting super or rorq and would result in infinitely less ratting supers and rorqs. PVE would go back to subcap ways. I can certainly see why you would want this. 
---
The issue that I see is that there are infinitely more people in the null blocks who would not want this and who put countless hours into building up what they have with certain objectives in mind. There should be some reward for building up the isk to buy a ratting super and organizing thousands of people around a small pocket of defended space. While it may be fun for you, it wouldn't make sense that a small gang should be able to put less isk on the field than what they are killing for almost guaranteed kills and that those ships can easily get off grid after the kill without suffering heavy casualties. Good wormhole groups almost always leave without losses after both successful and unsuccessful attacks. 
---
In the real world, small groups of terrorists can't significantly disrupt the economic backbone of countries with large armies so why would it make sense in EVE's sandbox? The proposed changes would also not solve the super cap proliferation for PVP, only PVE.
---
  So you want people to pay rent for their dreadstashes? Fair enough
---
You know what I would love to see because it will make it 1000% easier to find bots?  Gate watchers that type in local like the Frat bot in QRFJ.
---
Gate watchers will not do anything to stop Predditors, Marshy, or my hunter alts from easily killing a bot.  They can either move systems or die because they will never know if the system is safe or not once I show up.
---
And you can do t4s in that totally fine? 
---
Is the loot significantly better than t3s?
---
That sounds like the same risk-averse bullshit that everyone bitches about when the krabs don't just line up to be slaughtered. If the drop is a foregone conclusion where you don't even have to think about your tank, where's the excitement?
---
Barely failed drops are some of the best times I've ever had in this game, even if I have to go dump another 5b into a new Panther.
---
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic because it is, in fact, ridiculous.
---
Battleships don't tracking frigates at range perfectly without plenty of application mods or support. Why should supercarriers? See how there's a disjoint in the logic?
---
...Ok, so you know after the fact???  What have you accomplished exactly?  No, it is not a way of knowing which systems are safe if they are finding out as they are dying.  That is asinine.
---
I am pretty sure I am female
---
Titles reminds me of Gordon Ramsey introducing his next challenge. #GiveWidowSomeLove
---
You realize most hunters pve quite a bit to pay for their playstyle?
---
How is the guy cloaked going to do anything other than know I may be there?  I can log off today, and kill something in 2 days.  Are people going to abandon any system a hunter enters unless they see the hunter leave?  Do you know how many hunter alts people have?  I have 5 dedicated hunters personally.
---
That cancer still exists.  It's just a lot better without perfect intel AND all of those things.
---
Super ratting isnt a problem, supers chaining sites is.
---
The carrier will lose. If my carrier was buffer fit the day I dropped I would have died. 3 battle cruisers were doing 1800ish dps. My tank only holds 2k. If they had one more they would have killed my 2bn carrier with around 300mil in ships. Seems balanced. I’m eve if you spend more you can win more if skills and game knowledge are equal. 
---
Same situation but I woulda had a 2bn nightmare and killed them all this wouldn’t have been a discussion. 
---
Faction fit nightmares need a nerf! ;)))
---
Nice
---
iunno probably not
---
You're not arguing in good faith, I'm done here.
---
Yes and yes. Although it should be noted I have quite high skills in drones, missiles, and shields so if you dont have I’d say atleast 600 DPS and 175EHP/s (put it into pyfa) then don’t run it
---
Mass limit plus spool-up would be a pretty effective rate limiter though.
---
BlackOps BBs need to be reexamined. They really aren't worth the investment besides being able to initiate covert cyno hotdrops or sneak people into systems.
---
You find out when they log on retard.
---
The current meta favors long range, high(ish) DPS, maneuverable blobs. Booshing Nagas, with the right pilots and FC are perfect for this role. 
---
I don't think the blackout has much to do with Naga doctrines, rather it's a another piece in the constantly shifting Ferox, Hurricane, Munnin meta.
---
&gt;That's literally backwards. The time based component allows you to set a very lengthy skill plan and log out. You aren't forced to grind in the game for hours long sessions to push the skill up, your game play is not tied to the hours you log in.
---
Nono.
---
The point is *engagement*.
---
When they get you to care enough about progressing in eve that you even think in terms of "saving time playing the game" and about "planning your skill queue", the strategy has already succeeded.
---
Because "planning your skill queue" means you will actually care what happens to your character in a week or a month or... what's the training time from scratch to battleship? Like 10 months for sure, right? 
---
That's 10x subscription.
---
They have zero desire to control the market. They're just bored in their safe space wormholes and want fights so they drum up these excuses in order to sell it.
---
Who needs range control when people will willingly ram you.
---
It’s true, anytime you want to solo drop your carrier on a 3-4 t3cs please let me know and I’ll be happy to show you. 
---
I tend to agree with logi being OP. It’s hard as hell to kill a good logi wing, that is why we are seeing alpha dps fleets so often (machs). Only way to break their logi is to bypass it.
---
&gt; Cyno ships should be limited to certain ships
---
That doesn't actually help anything regarding getting blobbed - locals can just use one of their many characters to sit in a cyno ship, even more confident that they can't get counter-dropped.
---
Does it involve brining back Covert Cloaking Titan Drivebys?
---
&gt; No it's not. It's a sandbox MMO
---
Eh, I see what you're saying, but even in the bits of the sandbox where you want to build things, you're always open to other people coming to shoot them. That's what I mean by a PVP game, not that people are actively seeking PVP at all times, but that PVP is always a possibility and that's what makes it exciting.
---
Missions are an infinite resource though...
---
Go find you your girlfriend and tell her, on the authority of a grateful spaceships on the internet community, that you should bed her down in a rictus of delirious sexual congress such that she temporarily forgot her own name or where all her body parts are.
---
Then you shall reserve for yourself the option of taking her hand and promising to be joined by the bonds of holy matrimony to celebrate your union.
---
But the black out really isn’t that bad
---
looks pretty stable the last 4 years
---
Hello? Police here, out of our jurisdiction, please call animal control.
---
I use an isboxer setup with tiny clients on one monitor and a primary on another full-size, imagine eop can do the same
---
You don't get ticks when cloaked, which demonstrates that you just thought this up on a whim without possessing any knowledge on the subject. As well, doing so uncloaked would get you booted in a heartbeat.
---
And I'd wager EVE has much more long term stability than any other games Pearl Abyss owns.
---
As this girlfriend; what the fuck did I just read 😂
---
No no, it's not a multiboxer problem it's a recording problem. I can box just fine it's getting obs to record the right screens :)
---
your logic fails if people who pay subs for pve toons do the same.  
---
Needed amount of subbed pvp toons is less than those needed for pve.
---
Except it's impossible as you don't get bounty rewards while cloaked, womp womp.
---
cool thanks.
---
EWAR highs would be cool but then we would see tanky ass black birds everywhere like we did griffins previously. They do need a tank buff but that might be too much. 
---
But why would you drop a really big not very tanky EWAR carrier that would just get deleted instantly but dreads. EWAR always dies first and currently they are not tanky enough.
---
Honestly, I think that the biggest impact that all these changes are to newer players and small alliances.
---
I've been krabbing in null despite the blackout.  I mine in Rorqs, and just went to disposable drones vs. excavs (which means reduced income, but still making money).  Since the blackout I've had one person warp in on me - a hurricane that spent like 20 minutes trying to grind my rorq's shields down to like 90% lol.  Meanwhile I'm letting my subcap miners just expire on their subs, because I'm not going to have subcaps sitting out (just like I'm not going to risk excavs).  
---
I rat in a carrier, so the VNI nerfs don't bother me, and I have an umbrella over me just in case.
---
But the newbies trying to grind out isk with subcap miners or VNI ratting?  Boned.  Smaller alliances without an umbrella?  Boned.  And these are the very people the game needs in order to stay alive.
---
I really think that CCP has missed the mark with these changes, and ultimately are hurting the game.
---
lol
---
Boy I want to see you posting one of this days about your first pirate titan killed
---
Not when they have faxes they don't.  I disagree with these numbers attacking supers ( regular caps aren't my concern they seem to be in a good place honestly.)
---
It is mostly true. If you play it even halfway right, a small gang can evade and defang fighters rendering the carrier useless if said carrier has no subcap support.
---
There was a point you could have said the same of Frat, and now they're a very large alliance. Frat consists of the little guys from the Chinese server that got crushed by PIBC. Now imagine if PIBC commit what that'll look like. That's what you guys are worried about, why your leadership are working with them.
---
TIL, I'm crazy.
---
i mean what else are you gonna do, stand down cause you might lose a rokh? oh nooooooooooooooo
---
ah okay, that still requires a kind of super though so that doesnt really solve the problem.
---
Why on earth would they allow this
---
Caps should have a situational role, rather than being the tool for all jobs. In my opinion that should be (i) structure bashing, (ii) anti-capital and (iii) support for subcaps (mobile refit station/hangar is a good feature in this area).
---
What they shouldn't be is better at shooting at subcaps than other subcaps. That's as dumb as if a battleship was better at shooting frigates than other frigates were.
---
When you build one, ccp will acquiesce to these demands
---
&gt; Blob warfare is so good for the game! 4% new player retention!
---
Yet that's what ends up in the news and spikes new player registrations. I'd be interested to see the article for
---
&gt; anonymous nanogang overwhelm afk Cruiser in anomaly; shitposts in local
---
and how it affects login numbers.
---
I disagree and know there are games that have counters like this one should in regards to certain lets say equipment.  THis game needs a better counter to supers for smaller groups.
---
Improve the game for whom?  I have one usd-paid account.  I haven't logged in for anything other than eve mails since the blackout.  This isn't improving my game at all.
---
It can be based on the number of structures in system/constellation/etc. I agree, basing it on corp or alliance (particularly with ACLs mitigating a lot of the negatives of splitting) wouldn't achieve anything.
---
&gt; would make them push T3C hunters out
---
Nope, BS scanres is garbage compared to cruiser, useless for initial tackle.
---
That is not the loss that is needed but rather materials and isk at some level.  I expect explosions.
---
because the playerbase can run eve better than ccp
---
Uncontrolled inflation? Thank CCP for upwell moon mining. Botting? not even an issue, so many people are so uninformed. If CCP wanted the bots gone they would be gone, hell CCP probably was the bots to inflate their player numbers. The level of ignorance in the players is so high, fuck it, let em have this dumpster fire.... enjoy.
---
Anti-fighter?
---
you could set your isboxer client switch hotkeys to trigger a scene switch in obs, and have a scene set up for one monitor and a scene for the other?
---
Yeah sure... Let's make program the botting right in the client. Easier all round!
---
Don’t drag me into this
---
Says the guy who went with the "security blanket" personal attack.
---
Leave carriers alone nerd..
---
Worthless?
---
How much is worth for you? Anything less than 100m/hr? 200, 300?... Etc...
---
Because no one seems to do shit for less isk... But everyone is whinning about the amount of supers...
---
Reduce the general income, the supers will back to be something special.
---
Anyway, the blackout didnt nerf the reward or income. It just nerfed the AFK reward/income and make people actually to play the game.
---
&gt;Feel free to calculate the statistics yourself. Not a huge drop but definitely less post-blackout. Also, Goons were on deployment and didn't use rorqs for almost two months before the blackout. Check pre-May losses and even more evident more were dying on a daily basis pre-blackout. Sure, you may say less people are mining so less kills but how does that increase your pvp enjoyment? And how long do you think that less mining will really last? [https://zkillboard.com/ship/28352/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/28352/losses/)
---
I would argue the black birds wouldn't be Soo much tankier then a celestis for example. Or to be more precise would actually see shield tanked black birds (as blackbirds are almost exclusively used with armor fleet or with 0 tank). 
---
Also you could give carriers a bit more tank if needed.
---
It is an old political saying, you're but off on the meaning.  What it's implying (sadly correctly) is that when it comes to politics, soundbites, political theater, and bad mouthing your opponent win elections while a sound explanation of why your policies will be better for the country loses.
---
Classic jintaan video, 30 seconds of sometimes accurate information in 30 minutes of video
---
&gt;How is the guy cloaked going to do anything other than know I may be there? 
---
He's not. I'm just saying that 'looking for gatewatchers' would not be very effective either.
---
i would have done that but I dont have the skills
---
This can be solved by introducing a hefty damage and application bonus to all subcap weapons against attack fighters and fighter bombers. For example, add a fighter tracking script that increases missile explosion velocity, tracking, and missile sig radius by something like 500%, meaning subcap fleets can switch to hazing bombers at a moment's notice. 
---
This makes subcap fleets a viable counter to supers/carriers and makes it economically infeasible to actually fight subcaps with these. At the same time, both carriers and supers still retain their ability to molest other capitals and structures from standoff distances, *as long as they are not screened by subcaps*.
---
It gives subcap fleets an actual role beyond being an annoyance.
---
no sorry wormholes were overlooked
---
Possibly, I didn't think of this, I'll try it out.
---
I believe it was a marriage proposal by proxy
---
Russians are infamous for cheating and botting in games, like Chinese
---
&gt; “The same tools but faster” in exchange for real world cash is definitely pay to win.
---
No, it isn't, and the plethora of idiots misusing the term have robbed it of all meaning. It's especially stupid here because every single "advantage" gained from buying PLEX is available by spending Isk.
---
Unless you consider Omega P2W. Which you might, given your ludicrous interpretation.

Hi, capsuleer! 
---
Do you know what kind of stuff you want to do? If there's a streamer or something that brought you here we can help guide you to that kind of content. 
---
Many people (most?) join a corporation to find stuff to do and people to hang out with. New Eden (the world of EVE) can feel lonely since you can be killed or scammed by anyone at any time. Corporations are like guilds in other games. Multiple corps could join into an alliance. 
---
I recommend the corp I'm in (of course) if you are interested in being in one of the big power blocs that basically run the game world. Dreddit was started on this sub like 10 years ago, and I joined immediately. They're good folks, not too serious, but still quite effective. 
---
By default you will be in one of the NPC corps, which are basically nothing. Threes no leadership or services provided. 
---
High Security and Low Security corps are player run, and while they can be fun they're only a shadow on the cave wall compared to a Null Security corp, IMHO. 
---
Dreddit has optional fleets every day to join, often drunk fleets too! Anyone can run a fleet for any reason and get at least a few people to join, so if you're interested in being an FC (fleet commander) it's a nice corp to grow in. Basically all our corp fleets are SRP'd. A Ship Replacement Program means that the corp pays for you to replace your ship when (not if! ) it blows up. Dreddit has forums full of nonsense and useful info, a busy Discord, voice comms to chat when playing EVE or anything else and for fleets especially, a wiki, and an HR department. (Seriously)
---
If you want to be cloaked and sneaky, Dreddit has fleets for you. If you want to get into Capital ships, Dreddit can help. If you want to mine or kill NPC ships for money in the safest space in the game, Dreddit is for you. If you want to get in fleet vs fleet fights with hundreds on a side, Dreddit is for you. 
---
We have free ships and free skill books for new players. A mentor program to pair you with a veteran to get you where you want to be. Fleets specifically for newbies. Ships and doctrine fits (the equipment on the ship) for absolute newbies to be useful in any fleet. 
---
Check out Dredditisrecruiting.com or or public discord at https://discordapp.com/invite/eeCX7ch

---
did you buy the wrong size ammo
---
Ah, thanks.   Never realized they are now Omega-locked.
---
a counter for supers and titans that also the bigger groups can use? if not, how do you define a smaller group? corp size / alliance size?
---
Limitations on cynos in lowsec and general cyno spoolup mechanica have been raised as ideas that people seem to like.  Perhaps even something like a 1m cyno spoolup for subcaps that goes to 5 min for caps or something, so you really want to have support.  I've also heard people suggest making a 3rd king of t2 battleship (t2 abaddon, hyperion, mael, rokh) that can cyno block with a sort of bastion module.
---
There are a lot of options for how to make caps less attractive tactically in most situations.
---
Maybe its the wrong size. You have to look for "s"

P.S. Do you have a sister?
---
I think I know what the problem is.  Did you check if you're trying to load projectile ammo into a gun that requires projectile ammo?
---
Indeed but under no local if there is going to be a lot of hostile activity subcaps would not be as safe as carrier/super. Yet to be seen if it will be that bad or not really.
---
I did that when i was a wee spacelad

---
Your lack of fluency in English gives you away comrade. 
---
Your feeble attempts at trying to get CCP to add something back in to fix your botting tool is pathetic at best
---
Yeah I think I bought the wrong size. I needed small apparently.
---
I'm sure this is all well written. But I'm American, we have short attention span, can you like condense this into 3 sentences?
---
As a graphic artist myself I can offer the following critiques if that is welcome, if not then I meant no offense and believe it is a very nice piece overall despite this feedback. 
---
Light sourcing for the Loki seems a little odd, I believe you used a 3D model render from the game engine for your reference, these tend to over emphasize reflection and de-emphasize cast shadow because of the way games render light.  Some time invested in understanding the shapes and cast shadows would go a long way I think. 
---
Star-field is too uniform in color, and intensity of stars. 
---
Nebula could use more variation in shape and color throughout, and perhaps some gas infused “light clouds” to blur its outlines and the stars behind it. 
---
Overall composition could be more exciting if the general sweep of the nebula and the attitude of the ship were opposed to one another and not on the same axis, main object could be brought towards the left of the composition and adding some engine trails that also are off-axis to the background would infer movement and more interest. 
---
All said it’s well done, and I hope that my critique is taken as a suggestion of things to consider for future pieces and not as a insult of this piece or your skills as an artist.
---
They are only seen as the ship to aim for because they were made to be better than everything else. Thats a problem you can adress with rebalances.

Throwing up your hands an declaring there is nothing you can do to improve your chances because you can't make yourself 100% safe is counter-productive. That's all I want to point out.

There is plenty you can do to shifts the odds of successfully moving freight massively in your favour.

Not by corp or alliance size, thats just unpossible.  But something like 10 to 20 ships vs 1 super and limited by maybe a debuff that gets applied to a single super that only stacks up to a certain amount in a certain timeperiod of something.
---
I have always been anti-afk/Bot.  It is probably fine for the vast majority of players and good for them.  Just not my deal.
---
Honestly, just look at Widow losses. Most will be PVE fit. Theyre quite good at it and allow you to cyno to and from your DED and not have to gate
---
My hard evidence is the steady decline of that login graph before your precious 6-week cutoff.  The stagnant nature of the game was killing it.  A more active 20000 users can breathe life into the game that might reverse that decline.  Continued catering to 25000 instances of stagnation just leads to it being 20000 instances of stagnation in a few months.

As someone who quit 3 months ago after playing for a year straight again. I'm very jealous of the current state of eve and I might have not quit if these changes were implemented before. 
---
The worst parts of playing eve for me was having slow days on gate camps and not being able to find people in null sec after 20+ jumps. Then when you do find someone they just warped to structure or brought Africa in back up.
---
The blackout would have brought me and my coro many alternate ways of finding content and I'm very happy to see you all get to enjoy it.

"Hey CCP, can you change wormholes to show up as Anoms so that they don't have to be scanned? It would make it so much easier for me to scrape the data from the scanner window to provide intel and warnings to my group" 
---
Yeah, lets get right on that. You people are fucking pathetic. Your thinly veiled attempts to ask for changes that you can exploit to provide automated intel and warning systems under the guise of "improvements" is sad at best. Why don't you just hold up a big flashing neon sign that says as much? 
---
I doubt you're a wormholer btw
---
Why noone ever talks about making defensive plexing work as offensive does? NPCs you need to defeat in order to defend the plex would solve a lot of bullshit.
---
Also, if you warp away timers should just reset.
---
I don't think you understand inflation. The only thing that has massively risen in price has been plex, and that is due to ccp reducing sale frequency.  Most ships and items have actually been decreasing in price due to the increases in mining yield.
---
I think you need to hit HAW pretty hard too. There's a reason they nerfed tracking titans.
---
Make them have mobile cyno inhib. #balanced.
---
It'd be a great meme to give them some near useless bonus that becomes god tier at Blops 5... Imagine "20% reduction in decloaking distance per level"
---
Yes, now delete the empty space so the people that actually want to play can.
---
That already exists to a pretty decent degree. With no local and some coordination, pipe bombs are a thing again, in uncyno jammed systems at least. Gorilla tactics can always be used to inflict damage on larger groups. Stragglers an easily be caught. There already is a cost and risk vs reward ratios. Or do you want something way more extreme such as allowing every astrahus and raitaru have a keepstar class doomsday mount on it?
---
No but I have a brother ;)
---
the weapon attributes tab has what size ammo it takes
---
should even have a "used with" tab to be super sure
---
I like this idea. Thera has proven to be awesome for everyone and this is similar to that.
---
Ah thanks! This helps!
---
You can still warp to them no matter where they are
---
Do you know how much damage they do in one volley?
---
I think the idea of taking panic away from Rorquals is a good idea.  Buff the amount they mine but make them simple to kill.  This way people will still use them. 
---
The cynical inhib mechanics like you want are broken.  You could buff it so it would extend 200 km.  But it would completely have zero counter play if it jammed the whole system. A titan will take 25+ seconds to warp toward the inhib in a safe.  Like I said zero counter play for caps and supers. 
---
I think cynosure and inhib are in a good place.  You buff them to much more or need them.  You will see people fight less
---
Blackops BS need buffing in general, but the widow is trash as shit.
---
Imagine being the self anointed _kings of lowsec_, and getting your subcaps thrashed so hard by one cheeky korean lad, that you must blob 2:1 _and_ use titans to win.

Thank you so much! When he said I just started Photoshop he really meant it, I have no knowledge whatsoever about anything, I use a screenshot and hand drew the lines with my pad and then coloured it with a pencil and then added some light and dark shades by hand 😂 I watched a tutorial on the background but I didnt make it the same, I just needed to learn the tools I could use for that. Thanks for the advice, I plan On learning some more
---
Please tell us what online game would ever allow this?
---
I didn’t, but maybe you are just referring to all Brave members.
---
If you knew anything about the origin of goons you wouldn't be wondering this.
---
I feel like there are two approaches they could tank to make it good again...
---
1. Convert it into a full combat Blops. Works, but imo a bit boring.
---
2. Give it ECM range bonuses as good (or maybe even slightly better than) the scorpion so it can have its own niche as long range ECM support.
---
That's not even remotely a response to what he said.
---
He didn't say anything about arbitrary soft caps on alliance sizes...
---
Stop. Don't give me hope.
---
&gt;I mean it's not like you're paying for a ship that is outright better than anything else; it's the same things as anybody else. You shoot the same ammo, you blow up in the same explosion.
---
You can also pay real money to access in game isk. So you're paying real money to level up quicker and gain financial access to ships other players have to grind out for. This is definitely pay to win but every game nowadays has some form of it. It's just ccp's way of access that market.
---
ONE OF US.
---
Maybe, but I am hesitant to suggest that. HAW dreads as a counter to subcaps is a legitimate strategy. They are not exactly great at any other role. Especially if subcaps become a hard counter to fighter blobs, you need something like HAW weapons to allow some sort of capital response to subcaps beyond trying to boson them.
---
A small gang should not be able to do strategic damage to a nullblob. For example it wouldn't make sense for you to be able to take sov or blow up a structure with a roaming small gang. But it should be able to do tactical damage to a small corner of their space in the time it takes to get a big hammer response.
---
Not only is this more fun, but it's also realistic (hit-and-fade tactics) and it helps to balance the game's economy a bit.

Why are you out there with your venture for 40min? Isn't the ventures ore hold too small for that amount of time? What are you hiding out there?
---
It doesnt already exist, there is very little super loss outside of ratting supers and even the ratting supers are still minimal and nearly irrelevant,  Pipe bombs I dont believe do anywheren ear enough damage to supers.  I would definitely NOT add a doomsday to astras...though just the thought is pretty funny.  But yeah something extreme but extreme both ways.
---
You got out by yourself.  Excellent!  
---
Just remember, bring an extra set of probes.  I got out of the habit.  Once upon a time you could war/gate out of a hole or system and you had to go back and "reconnect" your probes.  Now they auto recall if you jump.  But if you disonnect and are out longer than life of the probe you will have lost your only set.  Only thing to do then is ask for someone to rescue you, which is unlikely unless there is a reward big enough, or pod yourself back to your home station.
---
I want to hug you.
---
i want to open language files. it allow to make community translates and then maybe more player inflow ;-)
---
Ah, thanks... Never realized they had been put behind an Omega-lock.
---
Demote them to the Nigerian Princes of Lowsec.
---
It's not as big of a problem if they're being run in subcaps. It's two different, somewhat related changes.
---
So you'll be addicted for about 4 and a half years, then CCP will do something dumb or, announce something cool and it it'll never happen, and you'll be like wtf eve is dying it was in its peak in 2019, and then someone will say pfft, don't you mean 2012? And then someone else will say, pffft don't you mean 2008? Then you'll win eve for 5 years and it'll happen all over again
---
It's absolutely not about wormholers vs nullsec. It's about nullsec period. It's about us being able to take out fun roams and actually get decent fights, it's about smaller groups having opportunities, and players actually having the play the game instead of having the game played for them.
---
Small gang health is game health, that's just the reality of it. Until the game makes the big blocs have to learn to play eve, instead of prevent eve from being played, player numbers and intake will continue to slide.
---
We can't even recommend the nullsec newbro groups anymore. Look at where we are as a community. This is WRONG.
---
It dies quickly but usually does not die before something comes through the cyno. You can believe what you want, It doesnt change that bombers  are way overpowered for their  size, low cost and low sp requirements.
---
&gt; Casual Players
---
&gt; Nullsec
---
See the issue?
---
If it's at a random safe outside of the fight, I probe it and warp to it in a random fucking hecate and blap it.

Let it be able to jump to a cyno.

Open industry window, facilities tab. It'll list what each station/citadel can do and with what bonuses. Pay attention to system tax index as well, might save a lot of money by doing your business somewhere less populated.
---
"Server nukes" would be more fitting
---
I'm not going to speak for the OP, but I will put my two cents in as someone who ran a small gang PVP corporation for three years between 2006-2009 and then flew with RK from 2009-2014.  So I have a good decade of small gang PVP experience before I simply gave up on it as a dead meta.
---
The problem isn't that we can necessarily effect a mega coalition in any way.  I don't think that anyone in a small gang organization realistically thinks they're going to topple a mega organization with some nightly roams.  The intent is guerrilla warfare, harassment and maybe forcing a fight with whatever the locals can scrounge.
---
In modern EVE, due to the incredibly fast reaction times of most mega coalitions, you can't even make a dent.  In fact, you can't even finish swinging your hammer before you're dead or run off most of the time.
---
From 2006-2009 this wasn't really a problem, I used to regularly fly through the back end of Geminate attempting to find PVP every night without having a QRF of 150+ people drop right on my head.  The inherent risk of living away from the main population hubs in a region was that you might not get saved if you get caught.  Now that risk is practically gone.  
---
The population hub, through the introduction of multiple fast-travel options, can jump anywhere within their region, or multiple regions, quickly and efficiently, so now almost everyone doing anything in a region of space can realistically expect to be saved.
---
Corporations used to join alliances to protect their structures and preserve sovereignty.  Now corporations join alliances and alliances band together to protect *individual ships*.  The balance is way off.
---
Also, there are too many goddamn Rorquals to begin with.  They should be *mining support ships*, not mega hulks on steroids themselves.
---
imagine shitposting this hard from the dumpster
---

I wish I was around when there was this many playing.
---
What MMO allows this?
---
Balancing things by price in this game has *never* worked. Remember when Titans were supposed to be rare?
---
Np sweetie
---
Where the f did you get this info lol?
---
&gt;The ability to warp while cloaked would make them push T3C hunters out and mean they don't need any support.
---
Idk man, I’m pretty sure being a BS is going to continue to hold back BLOPs from dominating the hunter meta.
---
On the topic of friends, I'd rather play solo. I don't like being dependend on others to get stuff done. That's also why I want to avoid joining a corp. Not to mention that without a corp, I don't have any obligations and I don't get dragged into stuff I don't want to be part of.
---
That's not true at all. Guerrilla tactics are often used by smaller forces to combat larger forces with great effect. Attacks on supply lines and hit and run tactics to inflict massive damage to critical infrastructure are tactics that are all used to great effect in the real world,  yet have no real in game equivalent. 
---
Rorquals have the PANIC module to allow them to become invulnerable while reinforcements arrive, and structures are a complete grind fest that force you to slug it out toe to toe with the enemy. 
---
I'm not saying make everything instapop to a handful of ships, but the way the systems work now there is absolutely no opportunity for any kind of guerrilla warfare.
---
Zing

You fucked with squirrels, Morty.

Are you in a corp? If you're looking to be in a group of friendly idiots, have I got the group for you!

Dreddit has lots of newbie programs like free ships and skill books. Mentorship programs, in game and Discord help channels, newb fleets, and ships/fittings that anyone can fly in a day or two and be useful on almost all fleets. 
---
Daily fleets with full SRP (Ship Replacement Program) where they pay you to buy a new ship when you get blown up. Which you will. Often. 
---
Don't get me wrong, Dreddit does good work in our various wars and huge fleet fights with hundreds on a side. Capital ship combat, system sovereignty warfare. But we are more new-member-focused than most of the other big corps. 
---
Check www.DredditIsRecruiting.com for the HR department Discord. Really.
---
what a dumb thought
---
I guess that falls on an argument of "How much should predator ship be in relation to prey?" They can very effectively drop on DED runners and kill them more often than not, but the problem is getting to them and their low numbers. I'm not saying they don't need some love somehow, just that there is still use

Ok, explain how you're going to force people into smaller alliances without arbitrary soft (or hard) caps on alliances.

I'd prefer to keep the ships I put my ressources into. That's why I said I wanna avoid PvP. I'd most likely run away if I detect another player in my vicinity. Not taking any chancer that someone might gank me out of boredom.

Indeed. I have some friends who've barely logged in since last week because of the blackout. Admittedly, other than fleet ops, even I've been spending more time on my highsec industrial characters than on my nullsec characters. And I'm one who thinks the blackout is interesting. Not great; just an interesting experiment. 
---
I'm all for getting rid of stagnation (and botting), but I feel like the pendulum of balance between hunters and hunted has been tipped far too much in the direction of the former.
---
To me, hunting ratters is like "hunting" cows. Catching an errant ratter was already an easy kill. But now the "cows" are blindfolded. Was that really needed?
---
The best fix I could think of for this would be to have a subcapital-only module that repaired capital class ships better than FAXes can. This would require you to have a constant escort of capital repairing subcapitals, which in turn would require an escort of subcapital ships to defend the capital repping subcaps. You would have to be insane to drop a capital fleet without proper logi support.
---
The kicker here is that FAXes would have to change as well to prevent people from just dropping both or just dropping FAXes for the better defensive value. I would actually think that switching the FAXes away from a ship-repairing platform to a structure-repairing platform would be kind of interesting as it would produce a new objective on the field. The problem here is it would be pretty boring for the FAX pilot during the fight.
---
These were just the thoughts that came up when I saw this comment, didn't think it through much further than that but I think it would be a reasonable fix.
---
I prefer PvP in designated areas/modes where I deliberatly go to fight others - should I ever be interested in that stuff - over just having some rando blow me up when I least expect it. And I'd also rather play solo than tie myself to a corp that dragy me into stuff I don't wanna do.
---
You mean clearing like a retard while an alt drop mtus in anom ?
---
Yes, I would like to see them die much more. But do you want to see them dying in a fire more, or so you want them nerfed or countered so hard that the ones that currently exist aren't used at all due to a skewed risk vs reward ratio?  
---
I would like to see them die more, but it has to be done in such a way that they will actually be put into a position to risk themselves to begin with rather then them becoming a decorative ornament to not be utilized. Might as well just remove them, and I don't think that adding battleship doomsdays is the right answer.
---
Getting paid in LP is already deferred rewards. You can't pay the bills with LP. Teaching new guys how to cash out is already a slog. This is adding complexity to a system that's already not very well put together.
---
uh lots
---
bad argument
---
Having skilled into ECM before the nerf, this would be a good choice.  At range 150+km most ships will not be able to hit you even though your technically targeted by the ship being jammed.  Wouldn’t apply to Carriers of course, or cruise missile boats.
---
WOW thats alot of games that I never know allowed the client to be modified.
---
It would be very weird to see Galmil staging out of Caldari highsec.  Much as I hate Jita, the geography is kind of important to give meaning to.  Logistics is one of those main reasons you team up and gain cooperative efficiency.

---
Did you even read? I said what ***ONLINE*** games
---
Thanks mate!
---
Could get rid of having multiple alts, force people to one account and then you would probably have more player involvement. Since you could use your alt to do what a player now has to do.
---
Precisely!
---
Nothing has made me consider logging back in to Eve like this event.  I got sick of the big corp lockdowns and poltics and quit a good 4-5 years ago.  Logged in once in a blue moon to rotate training and see how much money I still had.  
---
But the screaming and crying from losers like Mittani make me want to log in and play again.  No local means a whole new way to play.

Danke \~ The Cringy Krabs are direct from the stream coulnt remove em :P

AAR:
---
SGGRN formed for Major timers, Tatara comming out at ET 1103, Azbel comming out at et 1150. Battle start at Tatara, BBC/AVDOT brought self rep fit Moros to stop timer. 
---
but Tatara has X-large sized Neut, so moros died quickly. after killed a Moros, AVDOT brought Self rep fit Rev, which can tankable against citadel neut. SGGRN bounced after kill moros, to get more good position. BBC/AVDOT also bounced and warped to us. SGGRN were in Arty mach, BBC/AVDOT fitted AC with Web. 
---
when they landing, they dropped 2 revs and tried to blob. SGGRN lost machs, but BBC/AVDOT also lost Mach asw. then, SGGRN brought two suicide faxes to prevent sub cap losses. at this time, BBC/AVDOT dropped 25\~30 dreads to kill SGGRN faxes. even suffering losses, SGGRN kept killed BBC/AVDOT sub caps. after BBC/AVDOt dropped dreads, HKRAB&amp;HAWKS Bhaalgorn fleet joined battle to aid BBC/AVDOT. 
---
SGGRN start killing Bhaalgorns first, cause they has web bonus. After SGGRN had enough ranged from BBC/AVDOT dreads, BBC/AVDOT bounced and warped again. same situation repeated. SGGRN also lost machs, but BBC/AVDOT lost more. meanwhile, BBC/AVDOT kept hit Tatara with local rep fit Rev, SGGRN dont have muchful time to stop him. So tatara rfed. 
---
Since tatara rfed, there are a no point to stay ongrid. SGGRN decide to warp out for preparing 2nd round(Azbel timer). but AOM muninn fleet also show up, SGGRN decide to give up Azbel.

You mention resource distribution. I don't think it's the homogeneity of the distribution, but the static nature of it. It should be possible for constellations and/or regions to experience droughts. The pirate population migrates to avoid getting slaughtered so much, driving down the ratting site density, moons have a dry spell, that sort of thing. It would create incentives to move around the map a bit more.  
---
The more lucrative the space, the more dangerous, we already have that. It should also have less predictable PVE profits. This should be fine anyway for the sorts of highly organized groups that think pretty long term already. Being able to weather a famine is part of being a big and well ordered empire.
---
new players shouldnt be in rorqs, the fact that you think a new player should inject millions of sp and jump into a cap shows you are just being stupid
---
Arty Wolf is the worst troll ship ever. Underpowered as hell.
---
Totally different things.  LP store is where you go from generic LP to goods.  The "rewards account" mechanic means you can't earn maximal LP without participating in a variety of activities and being active in the warzone over time.  Corp LP taxes, LP contracting, or an LP market of some sort has been proposed in other discussions.
---
It’s an encouragement for OP, our fellow pilot, to keep this lovely and talented woman by his side forever.

---
You missed my point... those fights were a blast and some of my best memories in eve, but they certainly weren't *intended* to go that way.
---
Fitting a blops with the expectation that you'll be using in a close fight is wrong.... they are ambush ships
---
Oo
---
Took me 30minutes total to make it :P
---
&gt;  I just really believe people under-estimate the impact of fewer, multi-account players in terms of revenue and continued viability.
---
The players that sub with cash from CCP and leave will hurt the bottom line, but they will also be replaced by people that come back to Eve because they prefer a dangerous null sec.  However, my extra alts, bots, and a bunch of other characters that are PLEX'd do not directly.  We should see a fall in PLEX prices on the in game market when people that PLEX unsub, but CCP will likely not see any fall in income.
---
atlas mmo
---
Please remove asset safety from nullsec!
---
Asessing risk and handling loss.
---
The problem is that that's no longer the case. The whole game has been absolutely wrecked by skill injectors.
---
Would have liked to gotten into EVE back then, but sadly after being destroyed mentally, physically and financially from World of Warcraft I kinda vowed to put off ever playing/paying a full subscription based game ever again.
---
Seems logical
---
&gt; But for example if there was no local I don't see rorq use declining that much
---
I will disagree there because it will be a lot more dangerous for people to multi-box Rorquals without local because a couple bombers can decloak and nuke 5 excavs within 11 seconds.  I may cut back to less Rorqual characters myself from the 5 that I have now.
---
Depends what y wanna do. Cyno alt and covops alt are two classic examples, so is bait tackle, which you probably already have the tanking skills for.
---
I don't really want to have anything to do with those big corps. I don't wanna tie myself to any obligations to other players and neither get dragged into stuff I don't wanna do - like going to war with others or having a feud within the group I've joined burning all my assets. From the stuff you said only the part about having my own little pocket. A pocket where I can go after my business in peace without the attention of some randos who'd like to see my ships blown up and grabbing my hard earned ressources like hyenas. I also have to say that I have pretty much 0 interest in fighting other player, like AT ALL.
---
If the way resources are spawned was flipped to the opposite I would come back tomorrow and play forever.
---
We shouldn't have MORE shit spawning in crowded systems but less of it.
---
We should have MORE resources spawning in EMPTY systems to incentivise movement and content.
---
I'm coming from a singleplayer/solo play background and I'm not very  used to playing against other people - or with other people for that matter. I also want to avoid being blown up by other people as much as I can.
---
But like.... who do you fight when everyone is blue? 😜
---
Yeah, but the Chinese bot far more than anyone else does.

Selling skillpoints is actually great for the game. People playing eve for the first time that fall in love with the game don't have to wait a year to fly anything bigger than a cruiser decently.
---
I proposed it a long time ago with a few fweddit friends but ccp gave some weird excuses. It would fund all kinds of corp hull initiatives.
---
Directions not clear, inserted dick into auto cannon.
---
Literally the weirdest thing I ever experienced was them
---
Asteroids
---
How smart are you exactly if you think that is my view?
---
I support getting rid of injectors, mate.
---
If the gatewatcher is to be useful, it needs to alert people to the hostiles somewhere.  The shitty Frat bot just types it out in local.  Others probably post to intel channels.  However, if the bot owner posts the intel in local it backfires and if they post in the alliance's intel channels then tons of people will see the bot.  The difficult part is sharing the info with everyone that it would help (other bots and AFKs) without opening the entire alliance up to CCP ban hammers for harboring bots at a leadership level.
---
Ok ho chi minh
---
Just fixing the Cyno jammer isnt going to really solve that problem.  I do want them to die more and I do understand not wanting to then risk them but I do not think that having a subcap or rather alot of subcaps be able to deal better with supers would make them unusable and is what needs to happen.  I also believe the subcaps should mostly or all die in the process  ( I like the heavy suicide bomber idea.)
---
I sure hope you calculated that carefully to not give endless SP. If there is a reasonable cap to daily SP it's all good though and a nice event especially for new players.
---
BS have big, slow moving turrets, carriers have small, fast moving fighters, you see the disjoint in your logic?
---
remove skill injection totally
---
Ya know, normally I hate watching these long fleet videos, but this one was pretty damn good. Also i was internally bitching about the FC not broadcasting primaries faster, then I realized he was doing it intentionally due to the long reload of artys. Good shit.
---
Everything you're saying is exactly what I described.
---
&gt;This is adding complexity to a system that's already not very well put together.
---
&gt; how you're going to force people into smaller alliances
---
Well, considering nobody mentioned that, I'm not sure why it's relevant.
---
But mainly, what people want isn't necessarily many smaller alliances, but many smaller player groups.
---
Soft caps on player density in nullsec could do this without having an arbitrary cap on alliance sizes.
---
Simply have other factors that mitigate the benefits of being in a large alliance can get people into smaller player groups and alliances.
---
Like, if only 1/3rd of goons can live in Delve profitably, the rest have to live outside of it. Some may decide to just make their own groups since they aren't getting the main protection of the larger group anyway.
---
If you're using an extra character to do that rather than rat elsewhere then it's a huge effective reduction in isk/hr/character.
---
I'm sure Sort Dragon would never allow that.
---
You literally linked me to a steam page that has a bunch of single player games. And of those games the ones were you can create mods (not modify the client) we're designed from the start to allow this.
---
Link doesn't work on mobile for whatever reason. Anybody mind uploading a mirror? Or just poke/ping it on discord..
---
Thanks!
---
How will those SP be rewarded? Do they go straight into the character that gets the kill as unallocated sp or will they be redeemables (ergo also available to claim on your other characters)?
---
That would have been a great idea when they first came out.
---
i did the exact same thing
---
Red icons
---
on official servers please.
---
As things look with the game, the more blingy stuff doesn't look that tempting to me. If I can just haul my stuff in a beginners freighter, I will do it and not bother with any of the more expensive ships. Also, I get that the bigger and more costly ships are a magnet to pirates and gankers, making them in my opinion not really worthwhile investments.
---
\&gt; some weird excuses  
---
It's just engineering speak for "not now".  In reality, the features of the LP wallet are so few that it would be, even in the worse case, easier to break out changes into "new LP" code and just leave the old crap in place.  Any time you change LP anywhere, you just update it to the new internal API and voila, the old stuff's dead one day.
---
your realdoll can draw?
---
Hey now hy is a good FC and has never backstabbed anyone or blobbed.
---
The game is a sandbox, there is no right or wrong way to play as long as your enjoying what you're doing. 
---
Not that hard to grasp is it?
---
Thanks, but that corp looks a bit too large for me. Looking for a more intimate experience and gain some friends while learning :D
---
Praise him.
---
I don't understand how this fixes fw?  How would you combat people just suiciding their alt into a plex in order to earn greater rewards.  There's a reason LP payouts for killing opposing members is so minuscule right now.
---
Now Russia can impersonate mittens now!
---
I don't recall
---
Wizard hats are a summer hat right?
---
I read something once about titans not being allowed to fly close to certain planets because they can warp gravity and cause tsunamis and earthquakes because of the sheer mass of them. 
---
IMO they should make having tons of caps on grid rebuff them.  80 titans on grid? Well their mass warps gravity around them making their hulls weaker by a certain percent per titan after x titans on grid. I’m sure they can find a way to lore it up. Make using hundreds of the things worthless 
---
100 carriers on grid within 50km of each other should each get a nasty rebuff to raw ehp due to space being warped by sudden mass changes.
---
Wizard hats?
---
Proper F2P games also have Premium modes, which is why this is so misleading. Instead of "play free" it shoud have said "play trial".
---
What's the limit on SP?
---
Or you might lose 10 T3C's.
---
No worries. I hope you have fun!
---
This one is easy. Remove all remote-repair/remote-cap. It was a mistake from the get-go. Remote-eccm is fine, it can stay.
---
The fleet meta is stale because alpha is king. The engagement meta is stale because fights became binary; you either win with no losses or lose everything you can't extract.
---
It should *not* be possible for two sides to start a large scale capital fight and come away with NO LOSSES. Remote-rep/hardening/cap transfer all need to be removed from the game permanently and completely.
---
WoW does, to some extent.
---
scouting with a recon sounds OK to me
---
That's life in a nullsec bloc. There are always reds and neutrals roaming around that you can counter gank. Enemy space a few jumps away. Fleets, wormholes, etc. There's plenty to fight!
---
The concerns are independent though.  Say we get LP-store-anywhere and more BPC's to make it easier to dump LP to ISK without all the roundabout.   Whether or not there's a "rewards" program, it would be easier to convert LP.  
---
I sympathize with the desire for less complex dynamics for new players, but it's impossible to have nice things if we don't do some work on how facwar economics &amp; player behavior interact.
---
Most F2P games have Premium modes. This is just misleading for new players who have no knowledge of Eve's Alpha mode. It should have said "play trial", not "play free".
---
And if I log on before you?  Way to be simple minded.
---
Even if I don't, are you going to just never do anything in that system until you see my character on a kill mail elsewhere?  If so, I have accomplished my goal and your bot isn't making Isk.
---
Maybe if you lubricate your projectiles.
---
Start off with eve uni mate
---
The rules of logical debate hold regardless of what the debate is over or the platform the debate is held on.
---
it's literally a game where thousands of players interact in the same world
---
is it an MMORPG? maybe
---
but is it an mmo? factually.
---
Dont tell me what to do! You're right.
---
You loose a lot of application because of this sebo. Also shield carrier are fucked because they need application / tank / sebo on same slot. So yeah with nerfing application and nerfing nsa; we can feel it (as a carrier / super pilot )
---
In fact, Alpha mode was originally designed to be more than just a trial, as it is also specifically catered to returning vets.
---
Either way, new players can't know any of this, which is why "play free" is so misleading.
---
Personally I think between 3:1 and 5:1 is fair, but I think most people can agree that 30:1 or 50:1 (for a 3-5bil blops dropping on a 100mil VNI) is a little extreme.
---
I actually put in my application there, but they seem to take forever to approve it.
---
we're moving the goal post so much:
---
I went through the first couple of pages and have seen 9 multiplayer games that allow modding.
---
What the fuck do you mean by 'modifying the client'? all of these mods quite literally modify the client ie the running process.
---
I talk about her in eve.
---
This has been addressed in both the OP and 8,183 other write-ups.  As long as the instant-conversion value of destroying ships is less than a ratio of 1.0, we're good.  Because deferred rewards would require a lot of followup activity to actually pocket LP from manipulation attempts, would-be system gamers would just wind up playing the game to try to play the system.  The first attempt CCP made at paying LP for kills was extremely vulnerable to manipulation.  Robust metrics have lots of prior art in the wild.
---
Yeah we should buff the hp of citadell and remove all the timer, you kill it just in one way. This should be like this.
---
&gt; I talk about her in eve.
---
Flare doesn't check out.  D&amp;G is recruiting.
---
Well, you are using the wrong gun, that's all. If you would use Hybrid Ammo and Hybrid cannons, life would a lot easier.
---
But I dont think you need to modify the client for those those mods
---
The fallacy in your statement is logic as the assumed playing field.
---
Next thing you know, this nub is going to try to load medium ammo instead of large into dual 425mm autocannons, just because single 425mm autocannons take medium ammo.
---
Yep! I understand that now, but at the time I didn't know what in the world I did wrong. That error is non-sense.
---
I mean have fun, the capitals it's meant to drop on you will be the problem though.
---
afk farming not RIP
---
About twoish years ago there was a Galmil corp living in calmil highsec 2 jumps from Asakai. Ascending Angels or something, they weren't very good as a group but they had one or two good solo pilots.
---
OHHHH NOOOOOOOOOO NOT TEN TECH THREE CRUISERS OH MY NO
---
Welcome to the world of Hybrid weapons. You will be happy hereafter and deal significantly more damage. Long live the Federation!
---
Maybe nullsec is no place for cows. Also you can bait much easier now. Just fit a cyno or bring a cloaky ship to defend you.
---
It makes no sense that null is safer than hisec when null is more rewarding.
---
It was rhetorical. Also why bloc life is meh. Especially when in a block that is blue to nearly all of eve.  But that’s just like.... my opinion.
---
"We're still dps capable let's keep going" 
---
GF boys
---
Yeah, it is crazy fora VNI which is why I think 1-2b DED runners are the only realistic targets. That puts it closer to 2:1 or 3:1. Apparently people didn't like that take though
---
The problem with reading Stephen King is that everything you read after that suddenly becomes very dull and forced.
---
In what fucking universe is skyrim a multiplayer game?
---
Not to mention with games like stellaris all players on the server need to have the same mods installed.
---
And yes I moved the goal post but originally the discussion was too broad.
---
&gt; Eve is designed in such way ... that honestly, you cannot play without at least 2 accounts. 
---
You absolutely can play this game with a single Omega account, that's in fact what the far majority of Eve's playerbase is doing, including me. You obviously have little knowledge of the demography of this game. I suggest you watch one of the Fanfest presentations, the far majority of the playerbase are nullsec carebears. Not hardcore multiboxers like you.
---
Either way, I still not understand what your objection against beefing up omega accounts is.
---
&gt;projectile ammo
---
I think the issue is all he has is  projectile ammo. A common newbie error.
---
So load the Large 425mm instead of the Medium 425mm into the 425mm?
---
&gt;In what fucking universe is skyrim a multiplayer game?
---
special addition has a mod that: gasp : makes the game multiplayer
---
&gt;Not to mention with games like stellaris all players on the server need to have the same mods installed.
---
doesn't change the fact that they modify their clients
---
&gt;And yes I moved the goal post but originally the discussion was too broad.
---
so then just say you were wrong
---
Muninns don't do well against Eagles, their resist profile is bad vs kin-therm.  They're more in vogue because they 're slippery and deal with most everything else pretty well.  The higher per-ship alpha means your critical mass requirement is lower, too, which is nice for groups that don't fill a fleet on every ping.
---
&gt;it's still a shitty deal if you will be the one responsible for it.
---
A lot of it has to do with the usual mindset of the people who play Eve a lot.  Sure, not everyone is like that (see Evan McLean), but there's a lot of social pressure to conform to a standard, and if you take risks, that means that you'll lose more often, and people will start screaming at you about how shit you are, etc, etc.  
---
So hardly anyone does it.  
---
And that's a problem whose blame lies entirely on the players who can't break free of that risk-adverse mindset, even when, like you said, they can replace those losses 50 times over with just the piles of resources that they already  have.  
---
When you take a step back from Eve, and look at how players behave with such pressure to conform, it's a bit bizarre and not what I would predict happening for a sandbox game. There's probably a psychology paper or two to be written there. :-)
---
You have no way to play this game on single account. 
---
Let me tell you why :       
---
1. Jump freighter, cyno, cyno, cyno, cyno, cyno ........      
---
2. Freighter , webber              
---
3. Capital, cyno        
---
4. Bait ship, tackler            
---
5. ....... and so fucking more.
---
It's a valid opinion for sure. Bloc life is different from low sec and faction wars. Wormhole gang. High sec carebearing. Lots of playstyles to suit anyone.
---
Sound gay to me
---
&gt;But mainly, what people want isn't necessarily many smaller alliances, but many smaller player groups.
---
So you disagree because I'm using a slightly different word, or you don't understand that the blocs are made of smaller player groups.
---
&gt;Soft caps on player density in nullsec could do this without having an arbitrary cap on alliance sizes.
---
No.  And already covered many times despite your insistence that I'm not talking about the same thing you are.   
---
 The large blocs have an advantage in taking and holding space.  Their large size means they could conquer the space to begin with, as well as repel invasions from others.
---
&gt;Simply have other factors that mitigate the benefits of being in a large alliance can get people into smaller player groups and alliances.
---
And as I said above, there is no factor that can actually accomplish this.  There are no "soft" advantages you can give small groups that large groups can not exploit better.   And as I said above, hard limits will be worked around out-of-game.
---
&gt;Like, if only 1/3rd of goons can live in Delve profitably, the rest have to live outside of it. Some may decide to just make their own groups since they aren't getting the main protection of the larger group anyway.
---
You vastly underestimate the size of Goon's super umbrella.  They could cover 3 regions via 3 standing fleets that crush all roams right now.  And changes like blackout drive PVE players into supers even more than they already are.
---
Meanwhile, you've nerfed a smaller group that's just trying to hold a constellation, because now they need a region to support themselves.
---
And hey, this is *exactly* what I was talking about when you insisted I was talking about something else.
---
Now imagine yourself what you can do playing multiple accounts at the same time.
---
That is basically asking that some group that has gone 'all-in' on grid with hundreds of thousands of hours of work, years of it...to be third party killed by everyone in the game over a couple hours, who would be sitting in drifter wormholes waiting for tackle.
---
Heavy suicide bombers are subcaps...So they would travel through wormholes, be unaffected by a siege module, they would be really mobile. And you know that a couple hours before a big timer there would be many of them sitting in drifter wormholes. These guys would have nothing to gain from a fight or objective, except to solely third party over someone else's with the sole intention of wiping out those years of hard work for laughs and memes....Meaning it wouldn't happen because the supers wouldn't ever undock against certain death.
---
Fax reps have diminishing returns now. You can do pretty well with a dread bomb these days if you execute it right and you aren't tenebrex cheesed.
---
I think that was the original intent, but the death of lowsec and the rise of super ratting has drastically reduced the number of those targets to the point where they're more of the exception than the rule. They exist, you can find them, but not enough for a sustainable style of gameplay.
---
Good ideas? In this reddit? I'm sure this is illegal or something
---
Multiple alts = multiple subs = more money = more profit. They're not going to bite the hands that feed them.
---
Subcaps were preferred causes supers were more expensive and took longer to train into.
---
Salems Lot was too good
---
Who'mst've'est
---
I've got someone registered on my seat (excorp member) who did exactly this.
---
He was from the Saudi's I think, and basically dropped a fuck ton of cash to get to max skills, think it was 512mil sp. I'll see if I can find a screenshot of it.
---
I think I estimated it at about $100,000 if he bought isk via nefarious methods. Buying via plex would be a LOT more
---
I’m being facetious in the sense that nobody who plays eve is having fun. 
---
This fucking reddit sometimes I tell you.
---
Change cyno mechanics to force an escalation over time and prevent any and every ship from being able to drop a super fleet.
---
why you mad I wasn't even trying to bait this time lol
---
In a nutshell, blops were designed to be apex predators in a meta that went away long ago. In today's meta they are outclassed by T3Cs and, even worse, struggle to find prey offering a reasonable risk/reward balance.
---
To fix this blops need balancing to be more effective (especially the Widow) and/or less expensive.
---
The beauty of eve.
---
&gt;special addition has a mod that: gasp : makes the game multiplayer
---
Are you talking about the dumpster fire of a mod called skyrim together? 
---
&gt;doesn't change the fact that they modify their clients
---
At the resort of not being able to play with people as they would need the same mods.
---
&gt; so then just say you were wrong instead of grasping at any chance you have of being right 
---
Not once have I stated I was right, I am just continuing the discussion.
---
&gt;for why THIS is bad.
---
Nope, the piece does not say this is bad. It's making an 'and' argument, and not a 'but' argument.

Doesn't even have to be a real job, can just be a side hustle.

Gotta Welp everywhere. In game, on website forums - soon it will be real life!
---
That was a good article. It addressed the boot strap problem that is at the heart of Supercapital proliferation and stagnation and offered some solutions. As the owner of two Titans, I support “death to all Supers!”
---
The only reason I still sub to this place are the Naz posts. Not the best work, but any nazpost is a good post
---
Oooh, evil!
---
Maybe I'm crazy but I've always thought the main issue with Caps wasn't their firepower but is instead their inhumanly fast response time.
---
The pre-capital ships are based around the idea that large ships = more weapons + more tank + more fitting options - smaller = speed + increased difficulty to hit + cheaper
---
But then you hit capitals and suddenly you get this massive spike in mobility due to jump drives. What is the point of having a subcap ship if upgrading to a carrier gives you infinite strategic mobility within a region, in addition to massive upgrades to fire power and EHP. Capital ships should be slower to respond and designed for fleet battles (which they should stay the masters of), they shouldn't be able to jump on a small cruiser gang immediately after a cyno drops. It undermines the entire point of subcap ships.
---
yes, [yes we are.](https://i.imgur.com/bMUnrWv.jpg)
---
&gt; Are you talking about the dumpster fire of a mod called skyrim together?
---
ah, so this is where you go "BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY TOGETHER DOESN'T MEAN IT'S MULTIPLAYER"
---
bro you're grasping so hard just let go
---
&gt;At the resort of not being able to play with people as they would need the same mods.

also irrelevant, they allow the modification of their clients
---
&gt;Not once have I stated I was right, I am just continuing the discussion.

https://i.imgur.com/B1bpvOO.png
---
You can make something expensive enough people wont use it.  So there must exist a price where they will be used cautiously.  But that doesnt mean set the price and walk away thats how we got to the current titan situation.  Insurance is a large part of the issue with caps.
---
Yes pls

How do you know a nerd has a girlfriend?

Yeah, that and the FC wants as little time between the broadcast and the order to fire as well, in case enemy pilots are actually not shit and broadcast when yellow-boxed.
---
Will they chew until it bleeds?
---
Will they get up off their knees?  
---
Are they brave enough to see?  
---
Do they wanna change it?
---
That would have been bad -o
---
Well, better late than never. May even have some effect on the PLEX market as well.
---
Yeah facetiousness and sarcasm can be pretty hard to convey in text, it didn't really land dude.
---
Specially if it has a healthy dollop of 'grr goons' thrown into it.
---
You've already said that there's only two activities, exploding and closing plexes. What other follow up activities would these people need to game? What kind of "climactic events" are we even talking about? System flips? Some systems stay in opposing hands for years, and those wouldn't be worth fighting in under your system because they're never flipped so you'll never see LP from them so they'll never be fought over.
---
This. Tryhards feathering low sec gates with limited commitment and need for instant gratification are the ones who have failed to adapt.
---
Im so happy to see a non blackout related thread
---
You should, remember Han shot first.
---
Congrats, I'm happy for you man!
---
Quad light beam lasers take medium. Dual light beam lasers take small.
---
They would become the PIBC of TQ and nobody wants that. I guarantee CCP would send something worse than the drifters if it ever happened, as well.
---
Any bias is a bias. Devs being unable to think three steps ahead because of 'grr goons,' but generally, 'grr nullsec,' is not a good thing.
---
Ok, that's a good reason to look for a new corp.
---
"U Mad Bro"?

---
Shut up and take my upvote!
---
no you're just retarded. You've made assumptions about me that are just wrong, why would I justify your stupidity by putting effort into a response?
---
That depends whether the excavs can return within 10 seconds and whether the bot owner is around to prevent it from being killed by a fleet.
---
He appears to have quit so...
---
&gt;  I'm using a slightly different word
---
That has a very meaningfully distinct definition.
---
&gt; blocs are made of smaller player groups.
---
blocs are made of smaller alliances as well, but you still felt alliance was a meaningfully distinct term for some reason.
---
&gt; No. And already covered many times despite your insistence that I'm not talking about the same thing you are.
---
The large blocs have an advantage in taking and holding space. Their large size means they could conquer the space to begin with, as well as repel invasions from others.
---
Cool. What does that have to do with anything I said?
---
&gt; And as I said above, there is no factor that can actually accomplish this. There are no "soft" advantages you can give small groups that large groups can not exploit better. And as I said above, hard limits will be worked around out-of-game.
---
Sure, but if the extra effort involved in scaling the exploitation of those differences is higher than the benefit...that's literally the definition of a soft cap. It's an N+1 scaling problem. Similar to all the complaints about drifters attacking structures. The bigger the group was, the bigger the individual commitment of directors was to managing the problem. Smaller groups could more easily respond without burnout.
---
&gt; there is no factor that can actually accomplish this
---
Maybe, maybe not. We can't know until we try everything.
---
&gt; You vastly underestimate the size of Goon's super umbrella. They could cover 3 regions via 3 standing fleets that crush all roams right now. 
---
But what about 6 or 10? The number was arbitrarily picked to demonstrate a point. Would 1/10th of Goon supers want to stand by somewhere while 100% of PL supers ready for an attack? Who knows.
---
But if the power is spread out, that weakens the benefit of the super umbrella.
---
&gt; smaller group that's just trying to hold a constellation, because now they need a region to support themselves.
---
The smaller group may not need a region under changes that would push goon-sized entities to many regions. You're assuming a linear scale. That's just not how soft caps work. Ever heard of diminishing returns?
---
&gt; this is exactly what I was talking about when you insisted I was talking about something else.
---
Yet somehow you're still here saying things that weren't really relevant to the discussion and are poorly thought out.
---
Maybe the 18th try will be the one that succeeds?
---
We must keep our eyes on the prize.
---
Pfft. It's age is a testament to what the game offers. There is a reason people who play eve.. always come back.

  Yes you should play eve. PM me if you want help getting started.

Dont overlook how tags are acquired. I think its something that should be examined if payouts for FW are going to be changed. 
---
 I use to chain smash the supplier a level 4 mission for the brutor tribe (not in FW) that dropped around 80m in amarr tags per site. doing these missions pretty casually i was able to stockpile the good general insignias to cash in on the TLF lp store. This method was way, way better than getting the tags from plexs or the FW missions. Obviously this situation is not ideal, something that involves you in the conflict should provide you with more tags than a highsec level 4 mission.

I wouldn't say zero desire but I agree that they are not expecting to take over the market. They sure as hell wouldn't say no to a slice of the pie though.
---
Obviously, as long as there is no real chance it's all for the memes. If that were to change however...
---
Point being: Playfights are fine, just don't expect anyone to risk significant assets over them.
---
Hi, capsuleer!  
---
I recommend the corp I'm in (of course) if you are interested in being in one of the big power blocs again. They're good folks, not too serious, but still quite effective. 
---
Dreddit has optional fleets every day to join, often drunk fleets too! No mandatory timers. Anyone can run a fleet for any reason and get at least a few people to join, so if you're interested in being an FC it's a nice corp to grow in. Basically all our corp fleets are SRP'd. Dreddit has all the usual services: forums, a busy Discord, voice comms to chat when playing EVE or anything else and for fleets especially, a wiki, and an HR department. 
---
If you want to be cloaked and sneaky, Dreddit has fleets for you. If you want to get into Capital ships, Dreddit can help. If you want to mine or rat in some of the safest space in the game, Dreddit is for you. If you want to get in fleet vs fleet fights with hundreds on a side, Dreddit is for you. 
---
I don't know how much SP you have, but we have free ships and free skill books for new players. Anyone really, they don't seem to ask questions.  A mentor program to pair you with a veteran to get you where you want to be. Fleets specifically for newbies. Ships and doctrine fits for anyone to be useful in any fleet. 
---
Let the discord know if you have any questions! 
---
Fly safe. o7

Mad over what, being told I'm not a wormholer? This is some low tier trolling m8
---
Happens. I've been playing since '13, but I still discover new things once in a while. Bought a Rorqual a couple of days ago because it was cheap, and expected to use it to jump some ships around. Did not read the description. https://i.imgur.com/vQmkrlC.png  
---
Then thought, I guess I could at least prestage some Cyno Ventures, bought 15. Nope, their cargohold is too small for enough Liquid Ozone. Sigh. I suppose I could go for cyno procurers, but I was so pissed I sold the damn thing. At least made a cool 100mil profit on the deal.
---
Gotta lubricate the hole too!
---
When you find another pvp entity please let us know.
---
&gt;It should be possible for constellations and/or regions to experience droughts
---
Then the blocs conquer more space, and leave it fallow until they need it.  They also remove anyone trying to set up in that space, because the bloc needs it to be not used to ensure it's available for them.
---
&gt; here's only two activities
---
There's at least four kinds of "focused PVP" content proposed in my longer doc.
---
* System control progress checkpoint plexes
---
* System flips
---
* System upgrade / downgrade fights
---
* Climactic arc events - big cooperative, multi-event things that do not exist at all yet, but would be really cool to have as a victory lap after getting to high tier
---
&gt; Some systems stay in opposing hands for years, and those wouldn't be worth fighting in under your system because they're never flipped so you'll never see LP from them so they'll never be fought over.
---
Completing plexes in these systems would earn both immediate LP from capturing the plex and "rewards" LP when you flip _any other system_.  LP "rewards" accounts would not be per-system, but per-pilot.
---
Its fucking senile at the point so fuck it might aswell tag along for the lols
---
&gt; only large weapon system Alphas never got.  
---
&gt; only  
---
I didn't notice *only* i guess
---
How do you know a nerd doesn't have a girlfriend?
---
Don't worry, he will act edgy on reddit
---
Is that what they call...
---
*Sunglasses *
---
Pull To Talk?
---
Or European, depending what part of Russia they're from. Also, OP is racist.
---
Or not for level 5 of any skill. Use them to get yourself viable in a new skill tree quickly, but not instantly master it.
---
Why's that?
---
I don't know if there are rorq bots for sure. I've heard people talk of them but if they are used I can't imagine that they are used without the owner watching as it's too much isk that sits there that needs to be able to call in help.
---
It really is. The sandbox nature of the game combined with the lack of penalties for meanies makes the game interesting and exciting.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
and Asset Safety
---
Neither did I lol
---
That's true, but a cyno inhib isn't a huge problem for a small alliance vs a large one. The small alliance wasn't ever going to bring caps against the large alliance, or go toe-to-toe against them. If the big alliance comes to evict the small one they're going to roll over and die (well, move out anyway). That or bring friends, and in that case it's big vs big so no harm done. Basically, it's a one way weapon. Likewise if they deleted all capital ships and jump bridges. Now it's much harder for large groups to bully small groups or respond to them quickly. Small groups don't have that issue, but they're small.
---
&gt;You will be happy hereafter and deal significantly more damage\*
---
\* Except when you can't apply a goddamn bit of it because you're too slow to control range.
---
there are fucking 20 pages
---
Scouting with a recons in useful only in some situations. 
---
Some people rat with combats out, and constantly refresh them. Recons are not immune to combat probes. 
---
Recons are also not great for tackling things like tripple Nestors and twin Rattlesnakes because you slide onto grid from a long way out giving them around 15 seconds of you being on grid before you've even come out of warp. And by the time you'e landed they've MJDd already. Or the offchance that they dont see you sliding onto grid for 15 seconds, you grab tackle and die; because recons have no real survivability against twin Geckos, cruise missiles or a death ball of Nestor Drones. All the while, the sleepers have switched to your ship too...
---
Will you give me isk if i PM you?
---
&gt;Doesn't change the fact skyrim is a SP game.
---
it's a game that can be played with multiple players
---
but i guess it's single player
---
Probably one of the best pitches I’ve ever heard how do I request a join?
---
what are you talking about
---
yIkEs
---
its just counter intuitive at its core.  people in a chat room doesnt equate to intel about space until you teach yourself to think that way. your intuitions tell you that only using your instruments can give you intel, like using a dscan or launching a probe.  in terms of video games and fun mechanics, local chat ranks very low. to me it seems like an oversight that never got corrected or just a very ill conceived solution to another problem that was never improved upon.
---
It's a good thing that players in this game are not connected to a general information transmission network.  Otherwise they could exchange data without using CCP's servers!
---
&gt;You shoot the same ammo, you blow up in the same explosion.
---
Which ships? 
---
A kestrel and a nag do not shoot the same ammo and they aren't even in the same ballpark.
---
I bet this is the mittani posting this because no one else cares
---
&gt; That is basically asking that some group that has gone 'all-in' on grid with hundreds of thousands of hours of work, years of it...to be third party killed by everyone in the game over a couple hours, who would be sitting in drifter wormholes waiting for tackle. 
---
No it isn't, this is just disingenuous.
---
&gt;  Heavy suicide bombers are subcaps...So they would travel through wormholes, be unaffected by a siege module, they would be really mobile. And you know that a couple hours before a big timer there would be many of them sitting in drifter wormholes. These guys would have nothing to gain from a fight or objective, except to solely third party over someone else's fight with the sole intention of wiping out those years of hard work for laughs and memes....Meaning it wouldn't happen because the supers wouldn't ever undock against one hundred percent certain death. 
---
This is why there should be upper limits on how many of a heavy bomber could affect a super at once.
---
&gt; Fax reps have diminishing returns now. You can do pretty well with a dread bomb these days if you execute it right and you aren't tenebrex cheesed. They are pretty cost effective and more spooky now that local is delayed. I don't think you should be able to get a dreadnaught with the mobility of a subcap for three hundred million isk. Although buffing siege modules to allow propulsion, warping with extremely slow aligns in seige, and less effective remote reps could be a decent and exciting middle-ground! They would require effort and coordination. 
---
The fax reps were nerfed but not enough and they still outrep dreads alot of the time.  I DO think they should be able to get a dreadnaught with the mobility of a subcap for 300 to 600 mil that dies nearly every time, sounds pretty awesome.  Especially if they can only affect supers and are as slow as a battle ship.
---
You could always play as Alpha? They are doing Daily Login bonuses also. This week involves skill injectors and temporary attribute enhancers.
---
&gt;it's a game that can be played with multiple players
---
No its a singleplayer game that has a ganky ass mod that allows multiplayer. Let's first see if the mod can last before the author does something to screw it up like in the past.
---
bye felicia
---
So what you're saying is that Eve isn't dying? This doesn't bode well, lads...
---
it doesn't matter if it's janky, it's literally the definition of multiplayer regardless of how you feel about it.
---
Then the blocs just conquer more space, and leave it fallow until they've depleted the region they are in.  They will then do a crop-rotation-like thing.
---
The giant alliances have all the advantages when it comes to taking and holding space.  Making them hold more space just cuts down on the room for everyone else.
---
Dude was just fine without silver, you ass.
---
Did you record this on your phone?
---
It's only worth playing if you have the desire to play an MMO that is unforgiving; where your ships are ammo rather than possessions to be prized; where scamming is allowed and the vast majority trade interactions are out to dupe you; where it takes years of patience (or a hefty credit card expenditure) to play with the big boy toys; where most players who you engage against will outright eviscerate you in combat because they've been at it for over a decade; where the company that runs the game gives zero fucks about your opinion and will shit in your cornflakes then pull the rug out from under you and your preferred playstyle on a whim.
---
An unforgiving, complicated, geopolitical, sharp and dangerous game that has the potential to consume your life.
---
If that's the kind of game you want to play, then yes.
---
If so, then go straight to EvE University and they'll get you on your way to success. Do not listen to the suggestions of joining anywhere else, such as Goonswarm's Karmafleet, or TEST Alliance's Brand Newbros, or Brave Newbies. Fuck all of them as they just want to put you into the meatgrinder to churn you and your organs into their perfect disposable line member to benefit their power blocs without actually teaching you the game.
---
If none of that sounds appealing then fuck off and never look back, as this isn't the game for you.
---
Make the character Doogie Howitzer MD
---
I'm just waiting for the triglavian ships to leave Manarq in Genesis.  that is all.
---
Don't you think the need to roam for resources spreads out the big block corps? Giving everyone opportunities to gank them as they venture out for resources. Dismantling their massive gated communities for krabbing under the protective cover of caps and supers!
---
Also providing a bump in income to smaller Corp areas who are in distant and less ventured systems.
---
I'm excited to buy everyone firesaled VNI only to resell them at double when they become great for small gang roams.
---
So:
---
&gt;System control progress checkpoint plexes
---
This system does not exist and isn't defined. 
---
&gt;System flips
---
Relevantly rare occurrence unless in the bell curve of a swing, then it's possible to have multiple in a downtime. What if that pilot didn't participate in the system flip, will that matter at all?
---
&gt;System upgrade / downgrade fights
---
This system does not exist and isn't defined. Currently upgrades are by LP donation and downgrades are deplexing.
---
&gt;Climactic arc events - big cooperative, multi-event things that do not exist at all yet, but would be really cool to have as a victory lap after getting to high tier
---
This system does not exist and isn't defined.
---
-
---
What are you actually proposing? Nothing so far is realistic in any way and you're relying on other vague concepts to shoehorn your system into another already broken system.
---
MBC?  Oh, you mean the Holy Crusade to purge the North of the Goon menace? :-D   
---
Hats off to the goons and their leadership, one heck of a comeback!
---
WTB skin
---
Paging Mawderator
---
Props to volta for bringing it. Most groups would dock up and cry about numbers. Respect.
---
What about the ability to directly sell LP to another player? This is already being done (especially with incursions' Concord LP), it would help with people who just want to sell the LP for cash, instead of having to learn how to cash out.
---
What do you mean?
---
What's the big deal. I'll announce that on pay per view. No shame there.
---
&gt;This would have led to the exact same fucking shit we are in now. Just sooner
---
The shit we are in now required Goons to hold space.  I'm talking about not letting them do that.
---
&gt;Also, why would we buddy up with you?
---
To have sufficient military power to counter the Goons.  Not that complicated.
---
&gt;You are mad that we broke the coalition that was meant to be temporary from the start.
---
I'm talking about "Here, you can have this space".  "Nah, we're gonna take that space now".  Not temp blues for a war.
---
&gt;Now you want to destroy us at all costs
---
No, we just dislike you more than others.
---
&gt;Especially at the risk of PanFam pulling another Tribute and just leaving empty structure bashes
---
Yeah, remember how that totally stopped the Goons and they immediately left?  Oh wait....
---
&gt;Goons invading you because they lack better targets is not upon you to decide
---
They don't lack better targets.  They have you fleeing whenever they show up and declaring it a victory.
---
I mean you *can*, I just charge extra for it.
---
So now that automatically makes it a multiplayer game? If I mod in pokemon does that mean I am playing a pokemon game?
---
"The Miata sounds like a fun car, but its also been around since the 80's. Is it worth getting one, since it's old and all?"
---
See, thats why I always joke about beating off whenever someone asks me what I am doing on coms. That way if I ever do fuck up and forget to close ts/mumble, I can play it off as a joke.
---
Abyssal sites are pretty good income flow also. You can buy a frigate that costs as much as a VNI, and run missions earning the same, if not more, than nullsec ratting. Or you can spend as much as a carrier and earn double of what you can earn by ratting but doing T5 abyssal sites. All within the confort of highsec.
---
Go to nullsec, kill a battleship on belt get 1.500.000 isk for it.     
---
Lot it, get 500.000 more.      
---
Salvage it ... and get like 300k more.
---
This man has a plan
---
The major resource every player has in eve online is time at the computer. If you can make 1billion isk/hr using 10 characters, it's much better to do that than doing 200m/hr on a single character. With skill farms, alts are essentially free.
---
But it's originally a SP game, people are not going to start calling skyrim a multiplayer game because a mod allows multiplayer to work when it feels like it, as it tends to crash after 1h.
---
Somewhere IRL a few thousand bosses are loudly lamenting about "employee disengagement" lol ... can they run the servers off that too?
---
For a first attempt I think it's a great job.
---
That's what she says.
---
&gt; \- Carriers don't do enough damage or have the tank to take on even solo dreads, supers, or titans (all of which can easily tank a carrier) 
---
The tank is fine as it is right now. Maybe I would increase damage of fighters , but take away more of their application . Why would you want to be on top of a dread with a carrier ?! He tackles himself and you can blap him from very far away with fighters .
---
&gt; \- Carriers can't tank enough to keep up with most med sized gang cruiser dps. Fight a few T3Cs with logi, the carrier will almost certainly die anyway before a nerf. 
---
So what do you want ? To kill a gang of 20-30 cruisers with a single carrier , I'm sorry but it will be just stupid ... As for the tank I assure you, dual rep carriers can tank amazing already.
---
&gt; \- Barely anyone small gangs or solo roams in a BS. Most BS fleets you see are 80 machs which will nuke even a gang of carriers. 
---
I'm sorry, but I've seen many using Leshaks in small gangs that dunked on carriers. Machs... I haven't seen those in ages around after the removal of the low slot.
---
&gt; \- Solo drop on t1 3-4 BCs with logi and it will be a tough fight if they maneuver correctly.
---
And it's the way it should be. If they are good pilots with good piloting skills and pvp experience , also well organized , you shouldn't be able to do that . There aren't that many pilots there that can pull that off , the average pilot out there will most likely die before catching/landing any reps.
---
Not true. I flew one once fitted as a glass cannon for killing Asteros. Then I tackled a ratting Ishtar on a gate. In a +5 clone. #neveragain
---
Too bad because the Eris is a very sexy looking ship. Has that JU-88 look and reminds me of the Catalyst I flew in Level 1 missions when I was a new player.
---
At least Gallente have the Hecate.
---
The bigger problem really is the application of caps to subcaps. A single cap shouldn't be able to apply well enough to a cruiser, it basically ruins the "you can apply to 1 class lower" meta in subcaps. To kill a cruiser gang, you should have to send a bigger cruiser gang, or a battlecruiser/battleship gang. That bc/bs gang can be defeated by caps, which should be defeated by supers, or "Heavy Bombers", a cruiser with XL weapons (or something similar, that when put in a fleet, will kill caps, but can't really apply to anything smaller), with can be defeated by a cruiser gang.
---
There should be counter plays to every fleet.
---
Why would they roam?
---
Let’s apply this to TEST and pretend you need to switch regions every month to keep resources up.  Month 1: rat/mine in Esoteria.  Month 2: rat/mine in Paragon Soul.   Month 3, back to Esoteria.  And so on.  Umbrella moves to citadels already anchored there, and that are left there since we’re not giving up the regions to others.  Ships move mostly via jump gates so it’s not like hunters could hit much during some sort of migration.
---
Wanna make it deplete faster?  Ok, we’ll do it weekly instead of monthly.  Want to make the recovery longer?   Ok, we’ll add Feyth to the rotation.
---
You can’t think of your changes as a “what would I do” situation.  You have to think of them as a “what would they do”.
---

That sounds like a seriously shitty isk/hr activity.
---
Well, what you ask for is not possible in EvE. You can probably get by under the radar for some time, but the moment you want to do bigger and better stuff, is the moment you'll start attracting attention and competition. The entire game is built on competition and cooperation between players, it's meant to be played with teams.
---
There are quite a few things you can do solo, but usually it's either things that heavily limit both your potential and the fun you can have (in other words,  you'll get bored doing them and quit), or require you to have more in depth knowledge of the game before you even try them out, llike market trading for example.
---
How do i know? Well, i came back to the game after 12 years of absence and i casually play a few months at a time as an alpha clone. Sure, i can make a few billions here and there (despite all the restrictions on alphas), but in the long run i always stop playing after a few months. If i had the time to properly play the game i'd join a group of players, pay for omega and play eve the way it was made to be played, but i can't justify the time commitment required to do it currently due to certain real life obligations.
---
Long story short, your expectations do not align with what the game is. You can try it as an alpha clone and see if it's for you, but don't get too attached to your virtual assets until you get your first real loss and see what it feels like. If you can take it and keep going then keep playing, if it upsets you too much save yourself the stress and play something else.
---
The problem with "skill based tools" vs the Zerg is you end up with a Zerg with the same "skill based tools".
---
This was part of the thought behind command destroyers.  Boosh some of the zergs ships away and kill it away from the blob.   Now we have 250 man booshing fleets.  
---
There is very little beyond diminishing return effects to provide a  disincentive to bringing more people without just giving the larger groups even more tools in their arsenal.
---
I get that reference.
---
One of the things that’s broken in this game is the idea of some players that everyone should be able to do everything. Null is not better than high or low sec. It’s different. It’s not every player’s God-given right to be able to play all null sec content without risk. Null life isn’t the point of the game. It’s a sandbox. When the game is properly balanced there should be valid reasons to live in NS, LS or HS depending on your play style and goals, generally falling on a spectrum of more interaction, skill and risk leading to higher ISK-making. If everyone can have the “goodies” whatever that is (capitals, keepstars, I don’t know) they become meaningless and all other content goes unused.
---
How about all those titans being clustered in just a few and then heating up all sorts of space warping engines.  You could fit into the lore that these things change so much space for the mass of each that having one warp in an area creates too much space/time turblence for another to warp until some time has passed.
---
Maybe a limit to how close to each other they can land.  Imagine Titans having to land halfway across the grid from each, wouldn't that expose some to danger?  booshing?
---
Even today such a thing holds true for airplanes.  No "light" plane will take off too soon after a "heavy" did because the air is still too turbulent for a while after the big plane took off.
---
&gt;The shit we are in now required Goons to hold space. I'm talking about not letting them do that.
---
The shit we are in requires an untouchable powerbloc. Which a not-dissolved MBC would have been.
---
&gt;To have sufficient military power to counter the Goons. Not that complicated.
---
Goons were a non-threat at that point. Why ally with someone just to fuck one alliance in particular?
---
&gt;I'm talking about "Here, you can have this space". "Nah, we're gonna take that space now". Not temp blues for a war.
---
It seems you would have preferred the temp blues to be perma blues.
---
&gt;No, we just dislike you more than others.
---
How many others outside of your blues exist? You are bluetral to goons specifically because you hate us.
---
&gt;Yeah, remember how that totally stopped the Goons and they immediately left? Oh wait...
---
Yeah, remember how much fun all the goon linemembers actually had and how they **totally** didn't burn out after a month? Oh wait... 
---
Plus TKE is much bigger.
---
&gt;They don't lack better targets. They have you fleeing whenever they show up and declaring it a victory.
---
You are aware that wars in EVE are primarily fought for content? Something they will not get from us.
---

"Overall it appears the consensus on the blackout has been positive"
---
By what methodology did you conclude this?
---
Look, I'm not being adversarial.  Chill with the line-by-line.
---
Checkpoint plexes are a mechanic that got proposed and well recieved by vote on the facwar discord.  https://discord.gg/fR26KX
---
&gt; This system does not exist and isn't defined. Currently upgrades are by LP donation and downgrades are deplexing.
---
We hate LP donation based system upgrade levels.  It's easy to AFK alt grind through that LP.  If system ownership matters, this is unacceptable because ninja-plexing is anti-competitive.  Definitely we need new combat style objectives here, super-plexes or something, harder DPS checks.  I will refrain from defining exactly what.  I recommend multi-timer events here to avoid TZ gaming.
---
The other content, you can find proposals for the _critical_ mechanics on this reddit post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c10tx3/fw_climactic_fights_events/
---
I'm not going to go into specifics of where the rats appear where in highsec burner missions or anything like that.  It's not going to have any bearing on what CCP does and also doesn't tell them what abstract behaviors we think are important.
---
Finally you guys are seeing thru ccp bullshit..
---
Maybe make the cost go up per constellation regardless of alliance.  Gives some added incentive to keeping your space clean if someone drops a dozen citidels in your space.
---
Can I get a TLDR version of this too pls
---
Not sure if expensive trap or not. . . 
---
Fuck it, I'm rolling an alt already, when I get hacking skills done I'll see.
---
that's irrelevant, it's literally a multiplayer game now
---
it doesn't matter what you think it is
---
How the fuck would you even look for that?
---
It is. It's a known spawn glitch/exploit, but it's such shit income that CCP doesn't care
---
/#team200
---
Is there disagreement?  I don't know about other ships, but with the sabre, 200mm always if you just can fit them.
---
You use 200s unless you can't fit them and/or your main objective with the fit isn't dps.
---
Then minecraft is the answer to MMOs that allow mods.

Its just that we arent blue with Horde only because we got sick of defending the market against them and decided to let them in on the profit instead.

only shit players who need the extra stats use 200mms

I'm pretty sure they'll be just fine.  For max performance a 9900K is still probably the best desktop CPU though (single thread performance).

Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and screaming. - Dr. Ian Mcdonald

Until roaming in anything more threatening than a T1 frig doesn't incur a legitimate risk of being dropped by capitals and supercaps, I won't be resubbing. It's just too little too late at this point.

Expanded cargohold II is your friend
---
10/10
---
Awesome work dude! This is rad. Such a good looking ship
---
This statement still never made sense to me, how do you say nullsec is safer than highsec? In nullsec it requires players to intervene and track you, in highsec concord enforces it. It's safe becauase hunters are just as risk adverse as the ratters.
---
I also bought a bunch of the wring ammo because it's the same thing but in three different sizes
---
When a structure goes lower power for its final timer, can it still use guns/neuts/fighters/bombs, or do all of those go offline?

I've never actually thought about this before but in PYFA using a sabre only fit guns and long range ammo the 200mm get 8 more DPS &amp; 1km more range, the 150mm is slightly better tracking...  probably worth it to go with the 150mm, hit better, and have more room for fitting other stuff
---
Do we do something or nothing at all? Not changing the status quo DEFINITELY leaves us in the current predicament. Perhaps the current predicament is preferable to you all?

That's cool!

What would be the point in hunting in something smaller when you can put a 1k+ dps battleship on grid just as easily? Warp speed isn't a primary limit on current hunting. Though it does make a plus.

Wasnt me. Sorry im late. Been working on farm so no time to game.
---
Don't vunderstand =down vote
---
I wouldn't say it's something that should be efficient, by any stretch. IMO they shouldn't be used for ratting at all but you do have a solid point.
---
impressive1400 alpha shot with the help of Tatara powerful weapon.  it's more interesting than fishing rorqs at Tenerifis.
---
hope we keep this good fights the whole summer.
---
Scanres doesn't matter too much when you're dropping on carriers and such, why put a T3 on grid that can be alphad when you can use a brick tanked Sin to neut and tackle at the same time as drop?
---
They beat Verge of Collapse out of Thera.
---
Despite the isk numbers and no logi Volta did kill quite abit of ships.
---
Like I said, diminishing returns on things is the only way to really fix it, like the fax change limited the effective blob limit on faxs.
---
Damage caps are also a good thing for this as it limits how many people are useful attacking a structure.  Maybe a limit of how many can effectively shoot the same target before shots interfear with each other.
---
Putting more toys in the box doesn't do anything to address n+1 game play.
---
true it seems to really only make a difference when the target has an impossibly low sig radius
---
From a WH small community as well and agree with the sentiment of your post. However, I disagree with the approach to cyno inhibs. I think their biggest weakness is that so many ships (both capitals and subcaps) fit cynos to their ships and are trained to light a cyno the moment they are tackled. There is 0 counter-play to this. If it's a subcap we can likely kill it in time unless it's some amazingly tanked ship, but if the person has a fleet on standby 23/7 like the major blocs are doing, there's no chance. It's fucking sad seeing a staging system that has titans, supers, and FAX all ready to jump the moment ANYTHING is tackled. 0.0 is supposed to be lawless and risky, the risk has been lost as time progresses in this game. 
---
Back onto my point though, the cynoinhib should turn off a cyno the moment it is online. OR make it so a cyno requires a specific ship type, or some other kind of hindrance so that every ratting ship in the game isn't holding a cyno.
---
In short, nope. Bounty will only turn the guy on tbh. Usually it's either a sign of an incoming gang or some other miner using his hauling alt to bump n keep all the ore to himself. I think you were unlucky, mightve been trying to make you agress him.
---
basically drones, but pvp sabres have a web so there's basically never a problem tracking even them
---
Looking for br of goons fighting an entity of equal size and winning.
---
I see more 2018-2019 toons in capitals that 2014&lt;
---
There's also no counter play to cynos as they work now. Inhib is still on-lining when the cyno is lit 99% of the time when my group catches something (yes outside of Delve as well).
---
&gt; Simply because one side is in a mode of "eat shit and die and haha quit the game" posting level doesn't mean there is now an overall happiness with the black out.
---
This is what I've been told my years from people in big sov blocs. I think the other side (the one which I am biased for) is happy to finally have something that doesn't feel like a direct nerf to small gang.
---
You’re just not determined enough.
---
Thera is not a wormhole.
---
I thought there was supposed to be a patch years ago where a ship would eventually, after some minutes, warp no matter what bumping is taking place...  was it never implemented?
---
I don't think you'll find a lot of afk mining in low

Tell me more about these WMDs you have....

Used to be you could report them for griefijg after enough time has elapsed.

If the militias would be earning same level LP, and the LP stores would be discounted based on faction tier, the pilots on losing side would less disincentivized to keep fighting.
---
I began playing about a month ago, I've already tried the game once but never tried to put my "head" into it. One day I decide it's *the day*, I read all I can about it, and decided to go for exploration, first two days, I go for low sec, not even looking at isk making, but I know that the real deal is null/wh, but I'm afraid. 
---
At some point that day I say fuck it, let's do it, I find a wormhole and dive into it, boy I was scared, it was a weird feeling, I was shitting myself while having a great time, welp, been a month since that, I'm not looking back at low sec, not even once haha explo is so fun for me right now, can't stop playing this game anytime soon.
---
Still haven't tried real PvP, or playing with other people for that matter, I limit myself to not get killed when I have 700mil of stuff in my 8mil ship. I probably should give it a try at some point, don't know when, don't even know if as an explorer I should join a corp.
---
Long story short, OP, don't limit yourself, and YES, jump into that wormhole when you see it! It will be a blast!... perhaps...literally.
---
ps: bookmark that motherfucker
---
Maybe not reset, but tick back to 0.
---
&gt; On a related note: If I put like a billion bounty on him/her, will they actually get killed?
---
Bounties are a waste of your money, the system isn't useful
---
Claim you don't feel safe and move to one of the better countries.
---
Any system that can be gamed to make it easy/lucrative will be farmed.  You can't depend on people to be honest.
---
Looking for PL fighting an entity
---
Hm so maybe I shouldn't habe tried to warp to a different location? Though I'm pretty sure I tried a single location for a couple of minutes at least.
---
I think the feature was never implemented.
---
FBI, this poster right here.
---
Somehow I doubt that.
---
It was 3 minutes but I'm pretty sure it was never done.  Something about spaghetti code.

Thanks, I feared so.

You? I'm guessing.
---
CCP is saving their game. Its not ours. There is this thing called EULA where they state your shit belongs to them.   
---
So, CCP is saving their game from CCP.  Makes sense.
---
No, they need to keep it this way to be consistent with how they handle rapid light missile launchers.
---
5m isk/hr botted 24/7 makes a plex and profit on top
---
the best way to counter this effect when a pilot gets bored and wants to do this to another is to log off safely if you have no timers and re log in
---
It can use them.
---
oh rite
---
We're having just the **_greatest_** (kind of exhausting) discussion over on the Discord right now.
---
Where things stand, a lot of the mechanisms have been discussed.  Ultimately, having a ratio of about 1.0 for total payout _potential_ from PVP is a good design goal.  However as a safety net, the potential to buff any activity value with PVP should start to grow less and less at high values, using a low base logarithmic function.  If the ratio is only 0.5 by the time you hit 50bn ISK destroyed on grid, it gets much harder to game the mechanics at scale while still favoring all the typical galcal sized gang fights.
---
Insurance is a thing.  All that other stuff is a thing.  Keeping net asset creation from happening through buffing rewards with PVP has to consider all of that and then use robust metrics for value.
---

---
What you did there, I seent it.
---
&gt; Is there anything I can do against this?
---
&gt; I entered a mining belt in high sec in an Orca
---
Yes
---
Look at what size ammo you are using?
---
Why not use a cheap, lower SP, no-decloak-delay bomber as your in cyno that'll take them ages to lock?
---
...and yet after all your ridiculous mental gymnastics, for which you deserve the gold, the OP is still off base and wrong and we are left with this boring conversation

Assuming fitting isn’t a concern, the only time I would use 150s over 200s is if the ship is really fast and designed to orbit close (like the Dramiel).
---
Try to get into their public channel and talk, they will probably sort you out fast enough
---
Very well done! You should make one big enough for wallpaper engine.

---
Ferrari sounds fun, but it's been around since 1940. Is it still good?
---
fit a Higgs Anchor rig, it increases your mass making you harder to bump. Keep your mwd on as well as it increases your mass too.
---
How about just being able to flag a probed site/wh for corp/alliance?
---
A reminder to everyone that seems to forget the definition of inflation,

"a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money."
---
The opposite is true as everything is ridiculously cheap atm and you can get a lot for very little. The economy of eve is healthy especially considering the amount of money that's been pumped into the game via the faucets. Whether or not you think it's healthy for the game is another story.

That kind of depends on where you live.  I'm out in bumfuck nowhere, it would cost a ridiculous amount of money to get any kind of taxi service to bring me home from even the closest bars.  As in, it'd be cheaper to rent a night in a nearby hotel.

We have a different understanding of "significant" it seems, lets take some examples from RL:
---
1. special forces, yes they can do very high dmg to infrastructure but that is not significant until u follow with the bulk of the army to take "sov".
---
2. 9/11, they did a lot of dmg in lives and property, but it didn't crippled US ... thinking at macro lvl, it was not significant.
---
Please biomass useless fag

Noone in V0lta gets a slice of the pie. The guy who set this up has plenty of money to keeps this going as long as NS keeps docked in their NS space even under their NS super umbrellas. V0lta members get ships given and the profits from taxes going into a found for a new structure untill it runs dry.   
---
So after this 1st week the account is filled for another 4 weeks even if those structures make 0 isk.  
---
Now imagine how much TTT makes with 5x the tax and about the same upkeep cost.. while living in the safest and most profitable space of this time.  
---
For some people its about the iskies and god forbid have a fight anywhere and for others its about acutally having a fight at all (and on the side playing their opponents to pay for their fights even).

Every 100 burner missions completed in a region lowers LP payout by 0.2% for that week.

---
And if you try to create a corporation without having trained Corporation Management it will only tell you that you don't have enough ISK.

It cannot, hence my slightly ironic comment. Stratios and Astero are the only ships that can fit a covert ops cloak but not a covert cyno.

The frontline thing and deleting the missions is the fix we need.

I am an orca pilot as well and ive bumped people and i have been bumped a lot of times, most of the times to get my augmented mining drones but still A lot, and the sad part is that as the orca pilot the only thing that can save you is another bumper to bump your bumper.

I didn't even know about this until an hour ago. Would a cheap frigate work for that? Or even a shuttle?

u/CCP_Falcon is this ANY npc, or were sleepers and drifter in wormholes overlooked?
---
Yeah it’s a little inconsistent, especially since they can take blops bridges. I guess it’s because they’re technically T1.
---
I see what u mean, but in my opinion, u were able to do something back then because of lack of organization.
---
My personal experience, in 2009-2010, I was in a small alliance (80ish persons), just took sov in a constellation and hunters were coming to our space. We rat in PVP ships! 3 ppl in an anomaly (ppl, not alts). Whoever came to our space, died. After, 2-3 weeks of constant loses, hunters didn\`t come anymore.
---
My point is, what really diminish the hunters capabilities are not the ships/modules (rorqs die everyday) but the fact that big null alliances are capable to organize them self in order to protect their PVE ppl ... and that is something CCP can\`t affect, as is out of the game.
---
For example, lets say tomorrow CCP remove all capitals from game. Big null guys can organize something like a mobile defending fleet and 5 logis in each system (they have the man power to do it). If some1 is caught, logis warp to him and keep him alive until the defending fleet comes ... will that make reddit say logis are overpowered?
---
Thats easy fix. All capitals bpo to bpc. Only drops doing fw offensive plexing from rats.
---
Yes always. Using an MWD increases align time. Instead of trying to educate the new player about how *turning it off after a cycle* can help larger and slower ships enter warp faster, you just wanted to be a shithead because of flair.
---
you're so retarded you contradict yourself in 2 lines.
---
I started my first corp in december of last year. Its growing and going well. Been hard work but i love my corpies. They are amazing people.
---
Yes, It really sucks... People have been complaining about what the community has named "bumping" for years now, and so far nothing was done about it --"
---
You need 75% velocity to enter warp. By pulsing the MWD one cycle you can get to that threshold much quicker on some of the bigger shipa, and when your MWD is off cycle you'll be fast enough to enter warp. Generally only works on BS+ sized ships.
---
No dipshit, I even italicized the part explaining why the trick works. I'm not sure if you're a bad troll or actual fucking moron? The lines are so blurred these days.
---
Init. probably

"Using MWD always increases align time"  
---
"Oh except after you turn it off after a cycle"  
---
"dipshit i didn't contradict myself"  
---
Were you born this stupid or did you have to go through some special training?
---
/u/atlasdiari is a nice guy (✿◠‿◠)
---
Wow! Amazing what you can do with photoshop and a drawing board
---
An MWD increasing align time is different than using it to help enter warp faster. Those are two different things. If English isn't your first language it could be a semantics thing. But I'm guessing English is your first language, I'll leave this here though because I don't want to distract you long enough that you forget to remind yourself to inhale.
---
But this happens now: u can kill/steal excavators, u can kill subcap ratters fast, u can even kill caps/suppers/rorq if the pilot is stupid, u can practically shutdown a region/constellation by cloaky camping etc ... u can already do "tactical" dmg.
---
Do range bonuses on hulls benefit short-range turrets (to cover their disadvantage) or long-range turrets (to maximize their advantage) more? Tracking bonuses?
---
Railguns are effective at long(er) ranges, they suck against fast moving ships that close the gap and outdo the tracking of your turrets.
---
But that’s what blasters are for!

The point is the more people involved in breaking ToS, the more likely someone rats.  The more people that can slip up and give it all away.
---
If it helps, in the "Fitting" window, there should be some tabs just above the items. There are two that night help. One that only shows you to see what you have to skill level to use, and one that only allows you to see items that can work on that specific hull. It helped me a lot when I was looking to upgrade my fit.
---
Standings are fine, getting shot on site because you participated in FW sucks though.
---
CCP created this issue by trying so hard in the early days to avoid central trade hubs, however. If there was a neutral system that people could buy/sell shit in then the standing loss would be absolutely awful - you *CAN* grind it back if you wanna run missions in other faction space or get better rates, etc.

You will recieve bounty if you are in the same fleet. I suggest you undock and try it before posting again.

Can't wait to see Snuffed conveniently not commenting in this thread. Honestly it makes me sad, they must be so used to capital blobbing every other lowsec group at this point that they just completely forgot how to fly subcaps. The batphones too... Embarrassing
---
1. Our covert operatives and special forces topple governments all the time. They don't need to bring in an entire army to do it either. 
---
2. The 9/11 attacks cost the US over $3.3 trillion and caused almost a 700 point drop in the DOW. I don't think that can be considered insignificant. All the while it only cost the organization responsible around $400-500k to plan and execute. 
---
The US has still been dealing with the long term effects of the attacks to this day. Look up the money still   
---
being spent and the effect on people's lives. Just because they didn't land troops on our shores and   
---
march on the White House is hardly a reason to dismiss it as insignificant.

I've been waiting for an opportunity like this to sell some of my stuff a little bit overpriced.

You could really tell this was fiction when he said millions of Eve Online players.  The real result is that the player load will be smaller, so less electricity needed.
---
It *should* be the way the game is balanced, but the problem is that rorquals have destroyed that balance completely, and keepstars let any monkey pve in a supercapital and still use their toon for other shit. So having things that are very powerful locked behind extraordinary amounts of materials makes sense when it's actually an exclusive few people who can afford to do it, see every major war in eve prior to 2016, but when you give those tools to literally everyone with a pulse you get the game we have today.

For anyone who wants to try T5s, remember it has a heavy rng factor. One unlucky starving leshak spawn then it's a km for your shiny ship and pod. Or a dc, which ccp will not refund. 4~5 suicide tornadoes waiting at your exist can do that as well.
---
&gt;All within the confort of highsec.
---
If you run T5 there's nothing comfortable about it. They can and will take your 5bil Gila/Iki/Eagle  + Pod  away from you. Especially if you go to the PVP proving ground rooms. 
---
Some people run T3 in a PvP fit orthrus/Iki just to get into the proving ground and kill people who are unprepared, and take their loot.

I did see a guy in the abyss chat kill an Iki with a gila, pretty impressive imo.

---
You’re wrong about people needing to join null because n+1 meta.
---
You hit the nail on the head.  You won’t see vnis as much as caps, you won’t see caps without umbrellas, you won’t see hulks or subcap ops.
---
Because they’re WEAK to the players who literally play all day every day for easy kills.  Blackout means a loki uncloaking on your vni or myrm is a free kill for the loki, and 99% of loki’s are ONLY looking for free kills.
---
I tried mining with a rorq protecting covetors and procurers.  with shield boosts and remote reps, a group of loki’s spent 9 hours coming to the anom repeatedly until all the covetors and retrievers switched to brick tank procurers. 9 hours of trying to kill 20mil barges.  
---
The meta requires capital spam BECAUSE subcapital ganking is so easy it isn’t even funny any more.  T3 ships exist for one reason, to easily kill subcaps.  They do this RIDICULOUSLY well.
---
Same with bombers.  Anything that has covert ops capacity is uncounterable in blackout because they choose when and where to engage AND have the fps to win upon doing so.

Right or wrong doesn’t matter.  This is why people use capitals.  Why fly a 300mil hulk that people will camp for 9 hours because it’s easy to kill when you can fly the most shitfit of rorqs and force those same griefers to take their time and consider how to kill you? Why fly a 120mil VNI that can literally be volleyed by something you can’t see until they decide to shoot you, and you can’t beat even if you did?  
---
The ONLY defense for subcaps vs griefing style players was to run, or switch to a ship with enough ehp to live.  ONLY capitals can pve with enough ehp to live for help to arrive, so only capitals will be preferred.  People will gank hisec for 200mil, or less.  Imagine what they’ll do to a 1bil ship without concord intervening.  People will desperately hunt those, so you need help.  24/7 help.  Only null alliances have that.

Over ten years griefing has been made so much easier that pve has become a carebear grindfest to counter.  Capital spam has become the counter to 24/7 camping and nonstop gank playstyles...
---
If you want to fix the carebearing and capital spam, fix what caused it.  Fix the absolute imbalance the aggressors have in eve for everything but citadel timers (which is a different cancer entirely)

No, it's: "I have no recollection, Senator."

The most risky part in JF journey is actually undocking from Jita if your ally got even a half-decent logi group. I collapsed a hisec hole today with freaking T1 indies. And that's it, we might not get a good one for days unless we rageroll like crazy and have everyone doing just that. 50 runs, and it still was barely enough to fill a couple of hisec freighters. So no, if you think WH logistics is so easy - get into one and show me how ez it is.

You could take an alt in a webbing frigate to help you quicker into warp. As long as it’s in fleet. Sometimes helps. Certainly helps long travel anyway.

Hull tank FTW

Lol, been playing since 07 would never have known
---
Why can't we nerf things that took "time" to train for? It didn't stop CCP in the past with things like tracking titans and AOE DDs and now we have extractors/injectors it's less of an argument than ever before.
---
I started in 07

Agreed. I always felt it was natural to have a few jackdaws in the nightmare fleet to screen for bombers and tackle. It just feels wrong to me on a deep level that larger ships don't need screening in eve.
---
It is bannable to bump someone for an extended period of time as it is griefing, you need to be actually trying to kill them/trying to achieve something from the bumping
---
Yes. No place do I feel safe and comfiest as in a t5 abyssal in Jita.

The game mechanics to generate ISK are the same for every single player in the game -&gt; level playing field.
---
The moment you use external resources (spend real money to gain ISK) you pay for an advantage that not everyone has access to on the same scale --&gt; very uneven playing field.
---
Really not that hard to understand, isn´t it?
---
Sry to Prove you wrong,
---
First i wasnt that sure about how i feel about the Blackout, No Local sounds great for PvP doesnt it?
---
That Pices for Skillinjector are dropping is cause there is less Demand, Exploration Loot is raising cause less ppl flying Relic sites.
---
Npc kills dropping hm let me think maybeee cause you cant go Ratting in a Capital without a good Ambrella?
---
Infact Null Space is even more Dangerous then Wormhole Space, you cant crit the entrance you can cyno in ect ect. Even if you put a scout char to your entrances you most likely have already hunter in your system. Yes we made Pvp we had Fun Pvp we just crab wen we needed new ships for Pvp but cause the Pvp now i cant afford any ships so i could do Pvp. 
---
Activity from my Alliance just dropped to less then 50% in less then a week and i can imagine others will follow.

I tried Amarr and Minmatar guns, don't like both, damage output is terrible. Second, I generalized to saying Cannons for a reason. I didn't mean either, but both.
