part of that can also be CCP using the CSM as a data source how aware the players/alliances are of botting.
---
---
---
The answer here is that they are not common enough, that any group can be expected to have them. If you use them with any frequency outside of eviction defense it paints a target on your back, and your group will be under interest of larger groups. Either you get baited and die at that point or people attempt full-on evictions to force usage.
---

---
Also unlike in nullsec they are not used as commonly and it's considered quite rude to drop dreads in some situations especially C4 and below where it means you're dropping dreads on subcaps in your home. Being not-rude to people is important because it encourages fights, so overall you get more content and improve public image so it's easier to get help if you need it. Unless you're outright feeding that dread then people will be strongly discouraged from fighting you in situations that favor you again.

This could also be something for Serenity, they put those on SISI too.

I am proposing that they stop the focus group and instead work with their customers from beginning to end and not just at the end.

Only one of my kill rights have ever been activated. It was a doozy though. I would have loved a copy of the mail.
---
I'm not sure about that, but for posting on r/Eve, it generally is.

I sure did: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/489296331](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/489296331)
---
Might even do a little analysis of this fleet at some point cause there is a lot of material for me to talk about/improve on :D
---
You're correct that if you're sitting cloaked anywhere it's hard to find you due to no dscan/probes, but think of it less like a tracking someone down exactly and more like anticipating habits.
---
Mid safes are bad because using them drastically cuts down on search area for the hunter. If they have eyes on the wh/gate where you came in then they can see where you warp off to and then  trawl that path. There's also intuition stuff like people generally preferring to warp to objects farther away and dropping their safes in more "remote" locations in system away from most celestials. 
---
If you do a lot of explo yourself you'll generally get a feel for where to place safes and then you can exploit that knowledge when hunting by asking yourself where you'd hide. Look at the system map and a handful of 
---
&gt;if someone is cloaked at a safe created at the midpoint of two mid safes, are they 100% in the clear?
---
Pretty much. Nothing is 100% but it's very very unlikely you get caught out by anyone but the luckiest and most dedicated of hunters. If you're in a covops ship you have the added advantage of being able to make safes without revealing yourself beyond the initial jump in. It's way easier to wait at system entrances and exits (choke points) or for your target to do something that requires decloaking (like a site) and jump them then so that's what the vast majority do. The hunters are looking to exploit your laziness and you should be looking to exploit theirs.

If you click on show info of the incursion rats you can seenl the lore about where people were abducted from and what not.
---
eventually people are gonna get tired of just farming all day as an alliance goal and will:   
---
1. quit the game  
---
2. try another corp/alliance
---
No!
---
And then you can sell the Rorq and snicker about a guy having a Rorq where you farted into the ore-hold. And some day you ll buy some ore somewhere and you ll be thinking "That smells remotely familiar..." and you ll know your old boat is still around...

Its not surprising a Tapi Hel tries to use cyclops to kill a frig

It's been hinted at in a lot of places, the last of which (before this) being last week on [The Scope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxd2FMd1oWg).
---
It's both.
---
Subjectively, the CSM summit sounds like a nightmare. I would not want to participate in it the way that it works.
---
Objectively, I understand the purpose of it, CCP's goals, and why they do it this way.
---
Objectively, I think CCP is making a huge mistake and passing up an opportunity to use customer input not just to assess their own ideas, but to help them prioritize their ideas in the first place. Currently CSM is used like some filter, according to those who know here, to keep the really bad ideas from getting out. I wonder why they couldn't solicit ideas from the CSM (or a better construct of customer representatives) and have working sessions with them throughout the lifecycle from idea to deployment to make decisions in a more focused, efficient way. 
---
But in the end, I'm really just ticked off at the idea of being held hostage in a meeting for three days and not even making a fucking decision. Jesus Christ. I can barely stand my commute.

Someone could setup a jump bridge lol

I support the 3 day war

Would probably give me a reason to actually undock for something thats not a fleet. Poggers
---
Eve is the best....send me your isk and I will double it.
---
It would be absurd if you read that. But no one here suggested it but you, so far, so you can lower your terror alert level. 
---
I would tell my customers to put a group of less than ten people in a room, perhaps not selected using the current system, into a room, and let them vote on what they want to discuss. During the meeting the CCP folks could take notes while those people discussed things that are wrong in the game. They could put some time limits on the discussion and skip the Hilmar chart. They could ensure the topics discussed were the most important ones to the entire group. They could then go through and wrap up by listing what they learned in the session. Hell, they could end it there. That would be better than what they do today.
---
I didn't say they should change their business model. I think they should change their customer engagement model.
---
Chinese just took over basically the north with their recent purchase. Eastern Chinese failscaded. Southern Chinese blue to tapirium.
---
Yes. Damn phone. I would fix it, but most of these guys are drunk or high, so only you and I noticed.
---
Funny you mentioned strapping a rocket to a rock and painting it towards a station. I'm reading (well listening actually) a book called Leviathan Wakes, where they talk about how they don't need big ships to destroy a station, just propel huge asteroids and bombard it
---
&gt;But is it pay to win with the alpha thing with the subscription, and would it be worth my money to invest in it if I‚Äôm starting brand new?
---
EVE is a P2P game with an extended free trial. It is not a F2P game.
---
It's not pay to win. You can pay to get the most expensive ships and die 30 seconds later because you don't any seat time or understanding of mechanics.
---
Give it a try, I'm getting close to 6 years, I can't stop playing.
---
&gt; someone needs to turn this post into a dilbert strip.
---
The comments are even funnier. There's two kinds of people in the world: people that think about the future and people that pay attention to the present.
---
People who think about the future don't care how things are right now, they care about how they should be. They imagine better or worse in the future, and that's what they talk about.
---
People who pay attention to the here and now cannot hear someone talking about the future, because they don't do that and do not understand why anyone ever would.
---
This is common in any change management experience - even when you just suggest the meeting not waste time. 
---
Future guy: This meeting could be shorter.
---
Present guy: This is how long the meeting is.
---
Future guy: It doesn't have to be this long. It's too long. Make it shorter.
---
Present guy: You don't seem to understand how long this meeting is. 
---
Future guy: I know how long it is, and I hate it. Make it shorter.
---
Present guy: You are so fucking stupid. This is how long the meeting is. 
---
Eventually, after months of this, one of the two types of guy is fired to stop the conflict. The future guys are fired and everything goes back, or the present guys are fired and removed as an obstacle to people doing things differently (and hopefully better but there's no guarantees in life).
---
These comments basically repeat this same pattern. Count how many people say "You don't understand the purpose of the CSM" and just discount the possibilities open to CCP to change the purpose, the format, the location, the time taken, the way it is run, the entire goal for doing it. They just assume that everything today will be the same tomorrow, and anyone complaining about it is wasting their breath because life is a mountain you climb not a rock you push.
---
Can attest, hes in my pub chat all the time. hes addicted i tell you! And needs an intervention.
---
But no in all seriousness it's a great game give it a shot.
---
The trouble with Invasions isn't bringing enough DPS or enough Logi. It's being able to loot the field before the ninjas get it all.
---
Looks like a fun fight. Spod overdose on you bud.
---
I didn't suggest meeting minutes should be done away with. I think they should fit on a page instead of being a transcript of the entire meeting. Good meeting notes only contain the decisions made. This is not meeting notes. It is a transcript.
---
It certainly pays better before you to tell them than after. But usually the idea is to sneak up on them so they realize themselves that they are asshats instead of yelling it and going full Jerry McGuire. Although that can be fun too.
---
When did I say this was only for C5 brawls?
---
From second one theyve all had great tracking. I was popping frigs the second i could train into a leshak at 18 km. They only have some trouble under 14-ish km against frigs, everything else is pretty damn solid tracking

IIRC the rats are named after the system from which the pilot was abducted.

There were two Bobs in Office Space, and ultimately, they did the right thing. They found the guy that just handed documents back and forth, and they put the victim over his torturer. What's not to love about those guys? Besides, one of them was the doctor on Scrubs.

Heya, Im looking for information on running some triglavian invasions. I have multiple accounts and was thinking on multiboxing some minors but I has no fits...

because he is a tapi brain that can't even manage to do the same thing some ls meth addicts were able to

&gt; It's a bad system, but not because it doesn't run meetings as well as they do in Atlanta.
---
If they ran meetings well in ATL, I wouldn't be employed. It is a bad system, AND they run the meeting really badly.
---
The reason is because all of the faction dreads are not substantially better than the regular Empire counterpart, or are straight up worse, especially for the very neut heavy WH meta. 
---
Vehement: a very powerful web bonus, but the guns cycle too fast and you'll lose all that webifier and firepower once you get neuted out. 
---
Chemosh: same principle. Can't use your neuts or the guns if you're cap dry, though its stats are better than the Vehement's. Offers very limited advantages over flying more Bhaalgorns or more expensive Bhaalgorns for a much higher cost. 
---
Caiman: straight up garbage. 
---
Katherinesilens is half true about the usage of Faction dreads. If you are known to have one, people will occasionally set up in anticipation of an escalation where you drop it, and will batphone other corps to come in and help secure the kill. This is not a guarantee at all, though, and other factors like cost, and actual performance matter more.
---
Vehement has a web bonus right? Make it cheap so we can use it for solo provi 1v30s
---
We all know that. The point is that it should not be.
---
Would it be haram to drop a single dread with light support ? I.e to try 3-5vX with a dread for memes
---
or just loot faster cause you control when the sotiyo dies in the first place?
---
Ehhh, goons is more like 500 trigger happy soldiers and 9500 crabs hiding in their shell whenever danger pings about anything within 10 jumps.

Yeah fuck the people who put in the time and assets to run it just so some retard with an autolooting script can steal their days worth of effort spent scouting, prepping and running the site.

Link eve account to amazon account, subscribe there. Done. Its what I do because my credit union doesnt allow overseas purchases.

I wonder...when we try to exit the arenas we start taking damage, but if abyssal space is that hostile then how can anything survive out there? Maybe the Trigs just saturate the area around the arena with damaging energy? Probably not the case, but I‚Äôve been wondering how anything can survive on the planets there, if such life even exists.

You can also MITM or side channel or other vector attack encrypted memory.
---
Eve is just a glorified league waiting room these days.
---
You don't need to live in Eve to have fun in Eve. But you probably do at least kinda need to live in Eve to "be successful" in Eve, on account of it being a very broad and very deep game. There's lots of different things you can do, and there's quite a bit to mastering any one of those things (generally).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's not pay to win though. You can indirectly buy skill points and ships and ship fittings and stuff for your character, but it doesn't pay off in the same way it would if you bought levels and gear in most MMOs. The bigger they are, the harder they fall is definitely a thing in Eve. Lots of folks have gotten into the biggest, rarest, most expensive ships in the game only to lose them immediately to players with run-of-the-mill ships.
---
If you go omega, the Helios is a quite nice upgrade to that. And it can fit the covert ops cloak
---
Came here to say the same things.  The vast majority of security is by obscurity...
---
I mean the only thing i've seen is us asking that and people telling us to fuck off. Or telling us that "yeah ok" but actually they brought multiple leshaks and bhaalgorns to the hole ready to jump as soon as we make a move.
---
Maybe? It would certainly make everyone‚Äôs lives in nullsec more difficult, but I‚Äôm not sure if it will stop botters.
---
Says the boomer.
---
You dont understand the scale of the game if you think t1 battleships are any kind of comparison to carriers and up. Its a whole different world

I meant like in the eyes of a newer player, Battleships seem massive
---
What is the align time of a DST versus a freighter?
---
Is there any good starting guilds or whatever they are?
---
Just plex the account.  Free trials shouldnt get cloaks in any form, period.
---
I live in eve and I'm still not successful. What do FC.
---
What is isk?
---
Genuinely curious as to why you think that if it‚Äôs made impossible to abuse
---
They take like 10 minutes to run and are low risk. Does every single activity in eve need to have a massive isk payout?
---
The astero is unbelievably good (its my second most flown ship ever, behind the tengu) , but the price tag is steep for beginners. 
---
Cloaking IV is a hefty train for beginners.  I wanna say its around a week or 2. But its been years since ive trained it, i dont really remember. Never train cloaking 5 unless you get into extraordinarily specific things, like recons. Its super worth it, but to fly a helios you also need gallente frig 5, so thats more training to do. I would save up enough isk for 2 months of omega, do the training while making more money, and then try out a helios with covert claok. You should be able to make omega pretty regularly with that. And worst case scenario, back to alpha and the imicus until you can get it again. 
---
But word of advice, constantly grinding for omega burns you out bad after awhile.
---
Wow your attributes must be impeccable.
---
Genuinely curious as to why so many fucking mongs like you can't just get a subscription.
---
Genuinely curious why you‚Äôre being an asshole for no particular reason
---
The amount of effort eve players put into things is inbelievable.
---
True, that would explain why so many people on this subreddit call me a ‚Äúwhorish cunt who should die‚Äù for no real reason lol
---
Are you STILL fucking going on about cloaks? For fucks sake theresplentyof ways to move your shitty little 300m out of null
---
I agree, but here we are.
---
Just sub your account. Literally just $15.
---
Well, people didn‚Äôt like the idea of Alphas getting cloaks because it‚Äôd be abuseable, and so I‚Äôm trying to find a way to *not* make it abuseable
---
My guess is that their ships are immune to the Abyss's effects while the reverse-engineered ships we fly lack that.
---
And the Trigs probably live in stations deisgned for the Abyss. Either that or they all live in World Arks.
---
So if they won‚Äôt fix the game, why give them money?
---
You‚Äôre part of the problem; you wanna know what companies listen to? Your wallets. If you‚Äôre gonna shell out a bunch of money *every* year to *one* game, no matter what they do, you think they‚Äôd listen? No, because they know that no matter what they do, the majority of the playerbase will keep on sucking their dicks
---
What I want is a transcript.  The meeting isn't being held for the benefit of the participants. It has a function for the broader eve community. The transcript serves an important function.
---
Is this people to play with?
---
1) I don't
---
2) lmao vote with ur wallet good meme
---
That's been my experience basically any time someone engages into us. We try and fight, we get curbstomped, then they won't let us roll the hole because we haven't fed hard enough they come in and attack one of our structures thinking that would make us more willing to feed.
---
There's a subtle difference. Eve is unhappy people playing eve. /r/Eve  is unhappy people who used to play eve

Ah, so we‚Äôre doing the old history digging; let‚Äôs see what you come up with...

Posts- only on EVE subreddits

Okay let‚Äôs check comments... aaaand its all on EVE subreddits... subreddit activity maybe? Nope, same

Kinda sad dude

yeah Eve University, they have a wiki, I plan to join them Soon‚Ñ¢  too

Vote with your wallet isn‚Äôt just a meme, it‚Äôs the reason why EA actually fixed Battlefront 2

Please keep posting, you're fucking hilarious

This argument was even funnier when you could do the ame thing in an instawarping nullified ceptor, yet retards on reddit were still defending it.

This is why you should not listen to retards on reddit.

Actual concrete "wall" is blinged with Corpum A-type energized kinetic membranes.

I mean hey, you‚Äôre the one getting *really* worked up over a game, so I mean hey, my only complaint right now is that I can‚Äôt find popcorn
---
&gt; why does one person always successfully loot them when no one else can?
---
Give it a try and you will either hate it, or be sucked in forever... Just remember that regardless of what people will try to tell you, Eve is whatever \*you\* want it to be. Explore, build, trade, fight, lead, follow, lore, hell just flying around looking at the sites is fun. There is something here for everyone
---
\-12yr vet who still finds fun and wonder in the game
---
Yeah, this one guy who *only* posts/comments on EVE is following me, personally attacking me, etc; not exactly surprised but oh well, best I can do is grab some popcorn I guess
---
Don't bother, if it was the original "lootable with an nullified interceptor" mechanics, these retards would 100% still be defending it.
---
It‚Äôs money in eve
---
Most groups stopped running them because they were always losing it to him. The point of this entire chain was, making it require a freighter does not in any way make it safer. It means if he wants the reward he will have to work for it instead of risking nothing for 400b isk.
---
Im NoT MaD u ArE!!!
---
From what I‚Äôm reading it sounds and looks awesome
---
The game is made to be played over long periods of time, so some heartbreak and ruined plans are inevitable in the long run. You can plan for just about anything though. For example: I play with a very small but dedicated group of friends, no more than 4 of us at a time. We decided to finally take some space to hold as our own and lay claim to it and we erected a citadel (essentially our own personal space station, fairly large investment at the time). We were lazy though and didn't take all of our precautions seriously, and sure enough... Some enemies snooped us out and blew up all our hard work. Several of us quit for a few weeks, but that is the nature of Eve. We have pulled off impossible scenarios, heists, wars, stumbled on secret marketing illuminati meetings, laughed, cried, and just had a great time. The game is not perfect at the largest scales, but its good enough for years of adventure at the smaller scale even now
---
I am an idiot and didn't even think to show info. So simple. So in front of my damn eyes lol. Thank you.
---
&gt;Most groups stopped running them because they were always losing it to him.
---
and yet a group was able to do it within a day of theorycrafting given field advantage. 
---
i agree however, its not safer, if any of you think ya gonna get that freighter off grid now oh boy
---
Ooohhhh that's cool then. I will be looking at show info as the gentleman above you suggested as well.
---
Because I dont want freeloaders to cloak.  Quit being a fucking poor, its pay to play, alphas are just glorified unlimited trial accounts, if you want all the features then pay a sub.
---
No one cares?
---
This is, unfortunately, the case. When the rorquals changes went in we had just set up in new space, were trying hard to rebuild, and so we embraced rorquals and mining as a low effort high-income group activity. The rest of the game was still hung up on nullsec being PvP only, PvErs get out. So we mined. And we mined some more. And we kept at it while other alliances ignored at best or persecuted at worst those who wanted to start running rorquals.
---
A few years later, we have supercapitals so cheap that spies join just to asset safety them out of Delve, it being far cheaper than anywhere else. We have built up such an absurd lead in both supercapitals and active players that it will be years before anyone can catch up. The problem has been ignored for so long that there is no quick fix. Other alliances need the tools to be able to catch up, and it's going to take time.
---
The current attitude towards nullsec is to nerf income, umbrellas, rorquals, everything that we used to build our position. Removing the tools that keep the king of the hill on top might be a good thing. But if those same tools are the only way someone else could contest them you're just cementing the situation in place. These kinds of changes need to be done carefully to avoid making the problem worse, though I expect this is what is going to happen ultimately.
---
Quit being poor, got it
---
Cool
---
You really believe his lies.. come on man. He takes it before it even appears on peoples overview or the wreck appears in space.
---
I agree with basically everything there. Toothpaste is out of the tube so to speak.
---
I'm sorry you feel like you are entitled to things when you are paying literally nothing.
---
You understand as an alpha you actually cost the company money?  You understand that paying customers keep the lights on?  Why should they devote even a minute of dev time to your wishes?
---
First, find Rhiload, and tow his ass back to making videos with dollar bills
---
Yeah the coffee thing is really dumb lol. Like $8 for a single small ‚Äúsuper anal rainbow whipped delight‚Äù or whatever they are
---
Look, someone just discovered the Internet
---
&gt;Pretend this was an official announcement from fucking CCP or something and they‚Äôre asking for what should be done with their concept
---
No, just fucking subscribe, you scrub. Why the fuck should we pretend this is an "official announcement"? Fuck off.
---
Make it a single flat fee like $60 and I‚Äôd happily play; I mean, you can get a good AAA game for that price, so...
---
When yall get so retarded... wait
---
.. goon.
---
I mean if we‚Äôre going on the economics thing and ‚Äúdemand,‚Äù well... CCP could(and has been) just ignore the players, but then they could probably increase the price to like. $1000+ a year and people would still pay because EVE is their life
---
Fair enough I suppose, I should be lucky that it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly‚Äù like $130 a year, because they could easily multiply that by 10 and most would still shell out the cash(in all seriousness tho, I honestly think the majority of the playerbase would still shell that amount of money out)
---
You know I. Can have a conversation without being condescending to one another right?
---
Karmafleet
---
Brave Newbies
---
Pandemic Horde
---
Eve University
---
Look at all of them, each have their own character, even if you don't like one you might like another.
---
I imagine it would be due to price point. I mean you're on the fence about a 15 bucks a month sub. 
---
A one off cost for a game of eve's size (data centers aren't cheap) would be insanely high that very few, if any, could even afford it.
---
you run like 3x WCS 3X Istabs - you have a full 24 hours to get a good bookmark too, currently there is ZERO risk to the dst because you're already aligned out when you land. Nor can you be tackled / bubbled preemptively because  you can come from so many directions.
---
True, but I meant like the usual players would be willing to shell out the cash, not the minority of new players
---
Yes. And I was asking if the bigger Cancer Blue is going to move against the smaller one now that its Chinese allies failcascaded.
---
You‚Äôre literally being an asshole over a video game. Mocking and insulting over it like a 5th grader. Go back to your tendies that‚Äôre payed by your little gas station job
---
Okay so the first thing to know about EVE is how to pay for it. It is a MMO, the software is free, there is no mandatory monthly fee, but free-to-play players are severely restricted. A lot of MMOs these days have adopted this strategy (SWTOR, WoW). In EVE, F2P players are called "alpha clones," because every time you die your mind is beamed into a fresh clone body. Alpha clones learn skill points at half speed, and can only learn basic skills, and have a maximum skill point cap of 5 million. Once you pay for a monthly subscription fee, you get better clone bodies, called Omega clones, which have none of those limits.  
---
But wait, there's more! Alphas can buy a special kind of skill point injector called Daily Alpha Skill Injectors. They have a 24 hour cooldown, they're like 60 cents a pop, which translates to $18 a month (compare to 15 for a subscription), and they pack 50,000 skill points each. That's 1.5 million skill points a month just from alpha injectors. Combined with the 650k from their retarded skill point progression, that's 2.15 million sp a month. That becomes 2.25M with +3 implants. You can goose it even more if you use neural remapping to optimize your attributes for one specific skill, but that's situational, and gets complicated and expensive. An Omega clone "only" learns 1.3M skill points a month. +5 implants can punch that up to 1.6M/month, but all implants get destroyed if your clone is killed, so really expensive implants are not recommended for nubs. Neural remapping can goose an Omega with +5 implants to 1.95M/month, but that's still 300k/month less than an Alpha injecting daily with cheap +3 implants who doesn't even bother with neural remapping.  
---
So there is a clear advantage to being an Alpha clone buying Daily Alpha injectors rather than buying a regular subscription. You get almost 1 million skill points a month more than an Omega would. It does mean you can't learn advanced skills like cloaking but it does make you focus on boring but essential skills like power grid management and shield optimization. After you hit your 5 million skill point Alpha cap (in 67 days), you can go Omega, and be in a great position for when you do start advanced skills like cloaking. As in "I can do more than just sit in this ship, I can fit it and fly it and be useful." Or maybe you buy 10 Daily Alpha injectors and you play the game for a week and find out you don't like it and you're only out $6.  
---
One thing I don't recommend is the other skill injectors. Unfortunately in EVE "skill" and "skill points" are two different things. You could easily blow $300 on skill injectors and have 20M skill points within a few hours of making a new character. Even if you have the money IRL, you do not want to do this. That is because if you don't have the actual skill to fly a, say, stealth bomber for example, having a character who can fly a stealth bomber is not useful. You will still get wrecked because you need your skill as a player to match your character's number of skill points. Both will increase slowly over time. Do not rush it artificially, because you cannot rush it, you can only make yourself poor and embarrassed.  
---
Friends don't let friends use skill injectors. I mean what if you make a character, buy $300 worth of skill injectors for them, and then decide the name "Poopy McStupidPants" is actually not a hilarious name at all, it is in fact terrible? "I'll just pay to change the name like in every other MMO" you say to yourself as you navigate the EVE website and slowly discover with rising panic that there is no such option, it cannot be done, for any price, and the community feels very strongly that this is a good thing because of corporate espionage and in-game reputations. Let your player skill grow naturally in time with your character's skill.
---
Aww arent you cute!
---
Even if it was a gas station job at least it would be more than your free loading ass does :)
---
Please keep leaching off of everyone else paying for the servers your entitled ass plays on!  Go tell mommy to get you a bug juice!
---
Lol; you spelled ‚Äúleeching‚Äù wrong bud
---
Update: Found a single relic site in a wormhole, printed 25m.  I legit don't remember them *ever* paying out this much, or even having this much blue salvage.  Even the orange/red cores never had this much, and it was a paltry sum any time I ever went into wormholes or did explo when I was in nullsec.
---
Unless I literally hit a jackpot can and this is the only high paying site I will ever find, which is also a possibility.
---
Lol arent you cute, you can spell words, but you dont have even a basic grasp on economics.  Apologies, mea culpa mea culpa.
---
See I can apologize for my fuckups,  You however dont seem constitutionally capable of apologizing for being an entitled little freeloader.
---
I mean if you plan to be an english teacher or an author, sure, maybe.  Otherwise its a nearly useless skill.  I mean back in my day they told me we had to know cursive and we would never have calculators just available all the time.  At your age you are too dumb to even realize how dumb you are.
---
well yeah in wh there much lest chance of just having it nuked, so what small advantage  they have they can use,
---
New ships -&gt; New ship skills -&gt; More sp required -&gt; Injectors / Omega time -&gt; $$$
---
New ships -&gt; New ship SKINs -&gt; $$$
---
Making changes to the game to ‚Äúnerf‚Äù 1 individual  making use of a niche part of the game... wonder whythe game is trash
---
As others said bellow, to expensive  for that bonus or just plain worse then.
---
this is likely for new players, there are isk rewards from that.
---
Yes. A group specifically catering towards new players, focused on teaching  people how to play the game.
---
The people who stick around in that corp forever tend to be High-Sec carebear types because if you're doing anything else, you can do more in a corporation which specializes in it. However, if you're interested in doing something else, it's the best group to get started in before you move on and join some other group. I'd just recommend heading immediately for the PVP-oriented elements of the corp and do not fall into the trap of thinking that the best things to do in the game are mine in an Orca, run missions in a Rattlesnake, and panic when war targets are spotted anywhere in Verge Vendor.
---
They could, the problem is how bad would there impact be on the server.
---
He teached nothing looting wise
---
Always hilarious seeing "Hunters" complaining about prey fleeing as prey has done since time immemorial.

I always come back to ghostcrawlers blunt words (blizzard wow lead designer). 
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to make the best game for you, I‚Äôm here to make the game that you are willing to pay for. ‚Äú 
---
There can be different agendas in the room and in the end CCP will do as it pleases.  
---
I would rather have them call it what it is. Don‚Äôt paint the pig.  I just wondering how many on CSM would join if they was just a focus group where some might get a trip to island as a present to join. 
---
Because if it‚Äôs a focus group then you can go with bigger groups.  So big that you can start to draw conclusions from them.   (I worked with that when I was a student). But they should be filmed during the entire session so you got visual feedback to what did they like etc.    That you during the analysis can playback. 
---
We also don‚Äôt know if CCP is having a great meeting from the focus groups meeting and from that hash out the next big thing.  I personally doubt it. But we don‚Äôt know.  
---
But from my own POV CCP should change there meeting structure. I my self would also be frustrated because there is one thing I hate it‚Äôs meeting that don‚Äôt answer.  Then what?
---
Is NC. an official member of Pandemic Horde now?
---
only 20k sp? I assume you mean 20mil. anyway, use heavies for brawling(under 70km) and sentries for long range(100km+). pack some hornet IIs for the frigs and dessies. the target painter makes sure that your drones aren't the ones dying, and it's you dying instead(yay). What you do is just paint any rat at the start of a pocket, and the rats should immediately start killing you.(rats hate EWAR.) if they start attacking your drones, then target paint another rat.
---
sure, enjoy ISK making. Plex will go up every month casuse bots ara back.
---
I seriously don‚Äôt get why CCP doesn‚Äôt care about bots
---
How do I access?
---
Fairly new to EVE
---
Is that one a specific one?
---
cope harder
---
Then how is my success rate of looting sotiyos I run 100%? 
---
I catch nerds trying to. Enter the grid instead of trying to catch them leaving
---
Is the abyss different from WH?
---
Ince you rat/mine in Goons for years, have few titans, few supers, a dozen of regular caps...  you can't just move all that... you will stay with goons... until you unsub
---
Yes very it's a dungeon you can't go in and out, you have 15 minutes to compete it you won't meet other players only exception is abbysal arena
---
lol Gitzo :D
---
{Eve system name} + {part of the brain}
---
more friends isn't the solution
---
Ok thanks. That's one I had thought of but never flown one. I'm 5 in all large hybrid weapons having flown a kronos at one point.
---
Is this new?
---
That's who is used to include, now it's pandemic horde and a collection of what's left of NC/PL
---
Hi Bob
---
You know they sell different items right
---
 I am a k-spacer and you are not, therefore I must have superior mechanical knowledge of the F1 key that can't possibly be contained in your feeble little wormholerbtw brain. My willingness to do an annoying amount of having fun and VNI ratting in Eve instead of just joining a w-space corp with a C6 rental service and doing something productive IRL with the saved time makes me a far superior player, and frankly all of you filthy casuals with "other games" or "more important real life commitments than some MMO" should bow down and accept your place lower on the food chain.
---
Yes it should, it was never intended to be what you want to make it into. You're trying to optimize it into something it neither is nor ever was supposed to be, that's where the massive mistake in your reasoning is and which makes your entire post moot.
---
Nobody would ever fight again from the massive tidi that would cause.
---
So we need a zkill guide to finding rhiload?
---
That wouldn't be such a bad thing actually.
---
How's your dads Joe
---
Are they gay?
---
To be fair, in Maila you didn't had to deal with bubbles.
---
~~fun~~ fact: ccp is going to nerf the jack instead of fixing fw missions or fw itself.
---
I saw that on pornhub once.
---
Feel free to give it a go. Because of Alpha accounts, there's no risk to try, and if you like it, then feel free to subscribe. If you don't like it, then you can put it down knowing that no money was wasted.
---
We'll even help you get started if you choose to take the dive.
---
You are in Reddit. Dont try having reasonable conversations here.
---
Btw the mjd shouldnt be buffed only so your have an easier time running missions or ded sites.
---
Every Module has to be balanced around PvP at first. Pve is secondary always.
---
Thanks for reminding as that EVE can be pretty.
---
Been out of the game for a little while - what's wrong with that fit? I've got 6 rorquals fitted very similarly
---
And then people bitch about everyone bluing each other lmfao
---
fuck off krab
---
Bot bad
---
I looked at this one.
---
‚Äúthey adopted the same rules the elite alliances they outgrew by not having the same rules
---
FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL!!!‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs like the USA becoming a communist dictatorship because some third world countries really keep their people in line and the usa should too to catch up with far more aggressive corruption
---
/s
---
In a dst you scoop loot, mjd away from the npcs pointing you and moonwalk out.
---
Its the difference between looking at the situation from how it "should be" instead of realpolitik.
---
How are the drone regions? Ready to get evicted again?
---
WE already have a million different items and s complex system around it. Making it even more complex isnt a solution.
---
Btw all tanking mods have sizes from small to extralarge (Capital). Yes you can put a small shieldbooster in your raven but it wouldnt make sense. Also prices Not only come from rarity but also from demand. 
---
I think your idea is Bad and should never be implemented. Otherwise good try.
---
&gt;The word "racist" is the last hail mary of someone who knows they can't contest a point on its merits.  
---
So if we follow this logic, then any right thinking person would know not to call someone a racist if they want to have a rational debate and avoid knee jerk reactionaries ruining it. Or in other words, calling someone a racist makes you a stupid person, regardless of whether or not the other person is a racist.  
---
What the fuck kind of censorship is that?
---
I'm no miner so I don't know the specifics, but it's not what is mandatory and the pilot was a dick about it when told to get his shit together.
---
The thing started from him being told to refit.
---
Do youeven know how mjd work? On a 150km large wreck
---
I'm sure hunters have been complaining about that since time immemorial too. 
---
Although in my case I more hope for a gudfight. killing a lone domi with 3 frigates can be good. killing a domi with 20 dudes is kind of meh, only serves to meet our corps activity stats and kb rankings.   
---
The best fights are like 10  v 10's where both sides get bloodied. I play Eve for those moments, where pilot skill and battlefield awareness begins to matter a little bit and big risks can secure that kill on the stratios, or result in an expensive death.
---
I love when official emporium mouthpieces dig in my past just for a weak ad hominem attack.
---
Oh, and no, I got bitter before bat. Around the time of the book kickstarter, the "shocking" leaks about mittens getting money from all the advertising spam on goon jabber and Reagalan telling junior FCs that if they want to have fun they should probably get the fuck out of goons. I was WiDot around that time. Get your story straight.
---
I hate the regurgitation that newer players say, where all they drink up is the propaganda their Big wig masters say to them without thinking
---
Some times you have to think about situations before speaking, (bigthink idea for r/eve I know)
---
&gt;  Systems term would be positive feedback loop. We also call it the runaway leader issue
---
Fork yeah!
---
I'm not sure how feasible this is without reworking it completely. As is, your kill right is activated and you immediately get a message; whatever it was activated on has not died and may not die at all in some situations.
---
Yer considering we created the dead co branding
---
So butthurt I can't stand watching his shows anymore. Sad, because he used to get interesting guests that made them interesting. Now he still has interesting guests but he keeps interjecting comments that barely makes sense or are so stupid it's unbearable.
---
 Makes sense they are goon bitches
---
I am simple man, I see suitonia video, I upvote. Keep up the good work fella.
---
You are actually assuming that mission runner farms give a f*** for system upgrades or are willing to spend their isk there. Fw fighters do care for upgrades, but they have to compete with runner farms AND make isk for replacing their ships. Removing missions from the equation means you need to fight or run the plexes to make isk. Add in the venture change and farms won't be able to affect prices, LP prices will rise, fighters will have an easier time replacing ships leading to more people joining the fights. Sounds good to me, remains to see if the plan survives contact with the enemy.
---
And stars too.
---
Did the arch enemy show up to help your old allies that you backstabbed just a few months back? Queue feigned shock and outrage.
---
How dare an alliance of 7000 toons batphone  for help when being attacked by a coalition five times their number. The bloody nerve of them. Disgusting.
---
What he means is, you can pay to get better skill levels, but that wont make you a good player. Last year (I think?) A player bought an AT ship (one of the best, highest cost limited edition ships in the game) and died to a newb in a shitfit low level ship. Paying real money can get you good things, but it cant make you good at the game.
---
Plenty do.
---
And running missions is the best way for the fighters to get the systems upgraded as well.
---
I saw a good analogy regarding the 2 sides recently  
---
Legacy+gotg+imperium+Fire - Are all about empire building and playing the game to make isk, being strategically blue to each other doing so, with structured pvp made from agreements  
---
Pamfam+frt- are about making isk to make content, and focus on fights over blue status  
---
Current game mechanics favor the first option, people nowadays like a casual experience of PvE or Spoon fed PvP from a standpoint of superiority (eg- Gotg Autz Outforms pamfam, however gotg brings init and goons to major fights)  
---
2 different playstyles made with 2 different methods
---
It almost always happens in a Hel if you don't manually control them because the Dromi gets the range bonus but the Siren does not.
---
Oh sweet Jesus lord please link that zkill

---
unfortunately it looks like the killer has since quit.
---
No NC are great at being carried by PH.
---
It is 20 minutes
---
If only my toaster could push out graphics like this without having 10fps
---
Agreed, although these playstyles are not mutually exclusive, much of the strategic blueing has been in response to the actions and the loss of trust towards panfam due to the shotgun diplomacy where you cant trust them to build long time bonds, while other parties do allow this. Just look at what happened with test after WWB and Deadco after getting a deal. Panfam has a history of turning on allies, thus leading to people being hesitant to ally with them. This loss of trust just leads to a cascading effect we see today.
---
If panfam would not have turned on test and deadco i think the whole balance of power would be in your favour.
---
So I haven't tried stealing a ship like this recently but I think you can just board it without ejecting first
---
The only reason I play the game still is to mine in HS belts. If they took that out I'd straight up stop playing. I play 0 pvp as I'm shit at it and that would ruin my experience.
---
There were events in the build up to the release of incursions where Dev controlled Sansha fleets would attack a particular system in order to abduct the citizenry. These were often repelled by player fleets, but the lore was that many people were abucted anyway/before we got there. 
---
Source: Was there. I've got the corpse of one of the Dev characters who led the fleets :)
---
hey, why cant ccp just tell everyone inside nc. to get points by killing darkness or goons? etc... dont do it by somthing like standing that can be changed. but manually pick it out for the largest groups in nullsec, lowsec and hisec.
---
then have a smaller system for smaller groups more pushed towards killing people in certain systems or enemies your at war with
---
triv caps, nerfs to munin and some type of delayed local (im okey whit you showing up in local after you have decloaked)
---
and ofc i hope for some new pve that dont have anything to do whit trivs
---
FW does it. 
---
Loot does it
---
SOV did it, not so much anymore
---
Farming forces pvp for money
---
theres many ways to implement income in pvp fighting or farming.
---
What if there is none. No announcements, nothing new and CCP just phone it in at Eve Vegas like they have the rest of this year. Hell they are even dumping Eve Vegas.
---
It's funny. That's exactly the spot where I turned off that episode. I usually start watching his show/s but never finish them anymore. I think the last one I watched in full was because Ron was there and Ron is love, Ron is life.
---
Raid standard by

Fax/supercap rework. Hey a dude can dream right?
---
Hey, I'm on TV!
---
We waited so long for you guys to form, but at least we had a nice brawl. The FC nearly had us leave, but I am glad we stayed :) 
---
Come fight the blob with Fweddit :)
---
That's the spirit. :) If they didn't paid enough to win it they just need to spend more ;)
---
Lmao explain how NC backstabbed you.
---
Bonus points if you can keep the copy-paste statement you are instructed to post by the Officio Politica to 300 words or less.
---
But am not using any of the above, contrary to what people keep claiming. So it is in fact changing gamemechanics due to someone being better than another at something.
---
highsec incursions got nerfed from 3 spawns down to 1
---
Did PL and FE shoot each other?
---
Am I obligated to join a corp or is there a way to join you using fleet only?
---
Thanks !
---
How about closing Eve altogether? It would be easier and it would deal with literally all of it's problems.
---
Guilty until proven innocent then?
---
Although [muta.space](https://muta.space) does list all current contracts. Rarely will you find YOUR perfect module there. For that you need to get onto the discord and make a deal.  
---
There are containers and containers full of abyssal modules that will gather dust until you ask for them.  
---
Over 200,000 modules have been rolled so far, only about 20% ever made it onto contract.
---
Ospreys are chaff, idk why'd you'd LA in one and expect to live.
---
All of their ships are so broken.
---
Zarmazd is my favorite example. Faster than an Oneiros. More tank than a Guardian. Always capstable with 1 capacitor mod. More powergrid. After a few cycles it reps the same as most guardian fits, with the abiity to rep what, 1.5x? as much.
---
CCP is mental.
---
He's just jealous that Deadco gets the fights and not him.
---
only reps 1 target
---
bigger effect of ewar cause spool breaks
---
no proper remote cap ability cause low cap tranfer range so no combat cap
---
there are ur negatives. prolly more if u look properly. its a niche ship for small gangs/fleets. if it would be OP every blob would use it
---
Maybe 18M once you actually sell the stuff. And you have to open 6 cans while praying there is no bomber cloaked next to them. Add to that all the scanning... 
---
I could make more money mining in a Retriever.
---
I wonder why SLYCE is with PanFam again.
---
The Kikimora, because fuck yo' frigate.
---
That's pretty grim, I also think you're right :-o
---
who knows, i just pulled something out my ass,  and decided to throw my shit at reddit to see if it could make a interesteing and productive conversation, i mean, it sounds like a MUCH funnier and more "destructive" (which is eves version of productive) format than the current daily login rewards.
---
A tip if you want to boost your Caldari standing fast is to buy the glamourex standing boosters and do the career missions for caldari. The boosters only work for 3 more days tho.
---
i always said. why cant concord or the triglavians pay out LP for every citadel destroyed. and it pays everyone on the killmail. (i know people would whore but w.e)
---
the payout must be less than build cost of a structure) maybe 75% of cheapest known possable build cost in LP payout.
---
its an incentive to clean hisec, lowsec, and wars in eve maybe start earning people money fighting. if the triglavs payout. maybe some purchasable triglav stuff make thier ships a bit cheaper..... etc etc.
---
if this was implemented, and worked, maybe lp for pvp could be a thing. CCPLEZ make it so i can earn a REALLY little amount for every ship killed so i can purely pvp for longer. :D
---
And skins, skins are important.
---
I've still got some snowballs that haven't melted.  
---
It's cold in Amarr.
---
iirc I think at most its around 50 vs 50, there's a very quick clip of a mach fleet from a bigger fight.
---
That's pretty small in comparison to how the null blocs take their fights.  
---
The fleet composition kinda dictates what it'll look like on video.  In some of those fleets we're just ramming into targets, in others we're all moving as one.  Depends what we're against really.  Here's a fight where you can see us using [Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsO9Fon4U_8) against two fleets.
---
To them you're an annoying bug invading their home that they need to crush under their feet. If flies could write on Reddit I'm sure they'd complain about the unreasonable OP flyswatter too.
---
Are you hunting for pveers? Pvpers? Opportunistic?
---
Generally any dscan hunting guide would apply.
---
This is EVE 2019 trailer.
---
Having rear active, like target painting make you a higher priority.
---
You paint your own drone since the drone won't die, meaning you can ask harder.
---
And women
---
Isnt that already in though? I had kill right on one guy and first time it was activated, nothing happened. 
---
Then second time it was activated, shortly after i got the message that my kill right was removed because target was killed. That means that the game already tracks if whoever took your kill right was successful or not.
---
"xxxx has been killed using your kill right. The kill right you had on this capsuleer has now been removed."
---
They could just add link to kill to that mail you get when it happens.
---
Jesus, PanFam can't even pick on GOTG anymore.
---
Wtf is happening.
---
its diffrent groups, but i do agree with the sentiment. we need balance passes.
---
Nobody really cares about your humble ‚ÄúI am smarter than you‚Äù brag, but nice diary post
---
Everyone is just sitting on their pile of WMD
---
Absolutely fuck all of note
---
The person saying it‚Äôs easy to decloak you there either made a typo or doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about, most the time just landing at X planet while cloaked and double clicking anywhere in space is more than enough anyways
---
Yeah. Balancing can often be hard, but I feel like just regular small adjustments to the bottom and top things to bring them closer together would be good 
---
Just like every month do 1% tweaks to things.
---
I feel like you need to go work at CCP for a while
---
Transparency is pretty much always a boom the game health, even when players hate the changes being made. The developers being clear about goals is always good!
---
your successrate is 100% because you are using a script to instantly loot, everybody knows this
---
He literally included them in the deal, your perspective is due to propaganda. Yes a deal was made, and guess who is living in the drone regions now.
---
I love my slyce bros, but they did have some issues. In the context at the time i dont think they had many options. And panfam needs all the help they can get, as can be seen by their joining up with them.
---
Greetings Capsuleers!
---
As we‚Äôve been discussing for some time now, we‚Äôve been working internally on a feature called ‚ÄúShareable Bookmarks" Today we‚Äôre excited to announce the beginning or a public testing period, taking place on our alternate public testing server, [Duality](https://community.eveonline.com/support/test-servers/duality/). The server has been updated with a recent mirror of Tranquility and is now open so please feel free to log in, test out this feature and tell us what you think!
---
To bring everyone up to speed with the feature, lets recap the details!
---
**Shareable Bookmarks**
---
The Shareable Bookmarks system will entirely replace the existing bookmark or saved location system, allowing you to create links to locations in space that can be navigated to (through the right click menu or places tab of the People and Places window). Whereas previously, Capsuleers could create bookmarks accessible to either themselves or their corporation, this system is designed to be less restrictive and more flexible. In almost all other ways these new bookmarks would be functionally identical to the existing system (for example, we do not intend to change the rules about what you can point a bookmark at).
---
**1. Bookmarks are stored in folders, which are accessed through** [**Access Lists**](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/208289645-Access-Lists)**.**
---
* Those folders can be shared with your corp, alliance, coalition, friends, whoever you want!
---
* Folders can contain sub-folders to allow bookmarks to be further organized (Existing bookmark folders would be converted into sub-folders).
---
* Sub-folders are just a one-level organisation tool, they cannot be nested and do not have individual permission settings.
---
* Shared folders must be ‚Äúsubscribed‚Äù to - they do not pop up automatically.
---
* Shared folders can be linked (By dragging the folder into a text field) to allow anyone with access to subscribe.
---
**2. Shared folders have multiple Access levels, each of which can be assigned an access list**
---
* View ‚Äì View, Warp to bookmarks
---
* Use ‚Äì Add bookmarks, Edit/Delete own bookmarks, Copy Bookmarks to a different folder
---
* Manage ‚Äì Edit/Remove bookmarks or subfolders
---
* Admin ‚Äì Delete/Rename Shared Folder, Change ACL
---
**3. Capsuleers can set Shared Folders they have subscribed to active/inactive**
---
* Only bookmarks in active folders will be visible in space (r-click menu, sensor overlay, brackets in space).
---
* Bookmarks can only be added to active folders.
---
* Capsuleers will have a maximum number of active folders at any time.
---
**4. Bookmarks can be set to expire automatically**
---
* Bookmark can be set to expire automatically after some time (from a set pre-determined choices).
---
* Bookmarks saved in Folders or Sub-folders will default to the previously selected expiry setting.
---
**5. Addition/Removal/Editing of Shared Bookmarks, Folders and Sub Folders will happen instantly (pending performance testing) for all characters with access**
---
* The ability to warp to a newly created bookmark will now have a hard delay of 2 minutes rather than the old 5 min cache time.
---
* Bookmarks that you cannot yet warp to will not appear in right click menu.
---
**6. The new proposed limits to bookmarks and folders, Personal and Shared, are as follows. Please note that these numbers may change based on performance testing:**
---
* Bookmarks in Shared folder = 500
---
* Bookmarks in personal folder = 3000
---
* Maximum active shared bookmark folders = 3
---
* Maximum active personal bookmark folders = 5
---
* Maximum bookmark folders created and existing = 30
---
* Maximum bookmark folders known = 30
---
*For the less arithmetically inclined, that will mean a new total of 15,000 (active) personal bookmarks and 1,500 (active) shared bookmarks, compared to 13,000 personal and 500 corporate currently.*
---
**7. All existing personal and corporate bookmarks have been converted**
---
* All bookmark vouchers have been converted to new bookmarks for their respective owners (Capsuleer or Corporation).
---
* Please be aware that after the voucher conversion your total bookmarks can exceed the limits, which might cause client performance problems. You may find that you need to delete some bookmarks to be able to add more.
---
* Existing Corporation bookmarks have been converted to a shared folder.
---
* A transitional access list has been created for each corporation that includes the CEO and directors, this access list will be used for the ‚ÄúManage‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù levels of any corporation bookmark folders, and the default corporation access list will be used for the View and Use access levels.
---
As this feature is still in development, expect there to be some bugs, and some placeholder UI and text. Please report any issues you experience, and provide feedback for any things you feel should be improved. Some specific known issues to note for now:
---
* The options for bookmark expiry are not final.
---
* Some of the text (like help text or error messages) is not final.
---
* Localized names of the transitional corp access lists are not not fully functional.
---
There we have it! We‚Äôre very excited to bring this feature into your hands. Thanks for taking the time to read this thread and please join us on Duality to test this feature out. We look forward to the discussion!
---
CCP Lebowski for Team Five 0
---
Was fun:D
---
&gt;why the hell is the store bundled into it.
---
To ask the question is to answer it.
---
Hey come on. That's just not nice. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
How is that not of value? Old app couldnt do half of what this one does. I love eve players. "This is shit i camt do amything with this app.-5 minutes later- why in hell did u make new app that is actually of use to me!!!"
---
Awesome stuff
---
&gt; you could sell someone access to your list then give them a bogus coordinate 
---
You can also do this right now with a contract or item trade
---
&gt;I'd rather have 30 folders of 500 bookmarks 
---
You can totally have 30 folders, but you can only have 5 personal and 3 shared active at once
---
&gt;Not to mention it's unclear whether you can still trade someone a bookmark in your trade window. 
---
This will no longer be possible
---
You can copy directly out of any shared folders you have "Use" access for, currently copying is not limited to a specific amount at a time.
---
No AT = No Rhiload
---
Prove me wrong
---
I think it's mostly not about the new features, but why did they release a new app, instead of just update the old one.
---
Your reading comprehension needs work.
---
The new app is basically the old app except bundled into a slower framework with the store on top, with less features.
---
There will still be informal ways to do this (selling access to a "Trade" shared folder), but voucher trading will no longer be possible.
---
can't argue with that.
---
&gt; This will no longer be possible
---
So the answer is yes you guys are throwing it under the bus and the downvotes are unwarranted.
---
8 year olds, dude
---
The reality is that the apps are probably not made by the same team. It's entirely possible the old app as per the play store is owned by a contracted company and not owned by CCP or whatever new company makes the new app.
---
It's a dumb arrangement but that happens often enough on first companion app versions.
---
It was made on a bet by a bunch of interns who don't know any better and they decided to cram store into it and just push it out.
---
I'm not going insane though right, wasn't the old app basically only out for somewhere between 1-3 months?
---

If you‚Äôre gonna inject it, get it to IV.
---
Can the admin knows which corp/characters have access to the bookmarks?
---
&gt;So, is ACL permission "Everyone" respected here too? I was just thinking if not, then it would be better suited as special access list in structure profiles only.
---
Everyone is respected here (though people still need to be given a link to subscribe to a folder, theres intentionally no way to search for public folders, so that "everyone" can be used as "everyone with the link"
---
&gt; Would be possible to have one level of nested ACLs 
---
Interesting suggestion. Not likely something we could do for this feature's release, but I'll pass it on.
---
Admins can see which access lists are set for each access level.
---
Hope something cooL and game changing that will make me and other shitlords get interested in EvE again.

Concentrated teenage autism is a powerful force with few counters uwu
---
They will have to announce timeline of possible changes to sov-warfare and citadel spamming, and how both will affect capital and super-caps.
---
&gt;Btw all tanking mods have sizes from small to extralarge (Capital)
---
Not the ones related to resists, so you put the same mods in all classes of ships i.e the Adaptive Invulnerability Field, and if you look at the prices, there is no midrange, only cheap and super expensive. Since frigates, for example, already have less slots, having better mods to compensate for that would be a fresh air in the small ship meta and PvP in general, since 5% resists bonus  on a frigate won't make it a better ratting ship to compete with the classes above, but will give it a slight edge in PvP only. 
---
As I said in my post, the demand will come from people willing to PvP more if we offer a wider range of mods and fits that are not super rare, instead of telling them to suck it and either spend hundreds of millions in a bling fit or go for a poor's man TII algos...
---
Got it.  Good changes, then.  Thanks!

I think you can still pull and create bookmark you can contract to someone.
---
I asked for CCP to fix the skillbook in the Little things thread in the forums to reflect that!
---
As a newbie, your krabbing will usually get you around 50mil isk/hr once you find a good krabbing area. At 1800m isk for 500 PLEX, it'll take you 36 hours to PLEX for 1 month. Eventually, you might find better krabbing methods and reduce PLEXing time (I can see you reasonably achieve that in 6-10 months to 1 year) to 10hr. You can reduce it even further, but this usually necessitates multiple accounts that you'll have to also PLEX.
---
Trying to PLEX with ISK means you'll usually spend 90% of your time krabbing and 10% of the time actually playing the game. Most players who start out with this goal usually burn out and leave.

When you subsribe to a folder, is it a personnal subscription or it can be corpwise?

Just to put this in perspective he spent half a page telling ccp they should redecorate their room.

Looks far too bright in the background and the structure stands out too unnaturally...

They answered this in the thread about it.
---
The old one was limited tech, to accommodate for skill changes etc, the new one had to be designed from the ground up.
---
&gt;The new app is basically the old app except bundled into a slower framework with the store on top, with less features.
---
&gt; Less features
---
What? Where on the old app could you edit skills or apply sp? What features did it have that the new one doesn't?
---
I know, but like i don't want to play games on phones.

I dont care wether you agree with facts or not, it wont change them

Yeah what I'm trying to get at is, illed rather have a stock off blinged T1 dreads then a single slightly more powerful, dread that's also blinged. It mite help win the fight but  if you lose it, it's just that match more to replace rather then having the isk you saved for back ups.
---
Well, if giving compliments triggers such hostilities, I don't wanna try criticizing anyone.
---
If there were I didn't see them, seemed like the perfect companion app for the only things you'd need it for. Checking an account is still training.
---
You did not compliment anyone, you made a sarcastic insult to someone you dont know.
---
You sir, need to learn how to speak to people, before you try telling people they are doing something incorrect with the English language in any way.
---
But i do agree with you, you should stop criticizing people, that all in all gain nothing for them or you, until you learn how to constructively criticize.
---
Yeah that ‚Äúnew player shouldn‚Äôt join any corp‚Äù stuff made my brain explode
---
The new app I can actually adjust my queue on the fly.
---
There was an expansion in game called the Empyrean Age and the book describes some background details and lore of what happened.
---
Editing skills or applying SP is a gimmick. Easiest example of a feature missing is that we can't move characters around. Depending on which accounts I've subbed I may have to scroll to the middle or bottom to see if one is skilling or not, it's stupid. 
---
That and the thing is bloated. Having the store there is insulting.
---
Yeah, true - but who cares? Seems stupid to implement something like that when they need people actually logging in (especially right now).
---
I could see it being handy for skillfarms i guess, when you cant queue up more than 24 hours. Apart from that, there's no reason not to have weeks/months in your queue at any time so it's sorta redundant.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
You can already multi-select bookmarks and copy them all in one go. If you open a folder in its own window, then you can easily also use CTRL+A to select them all.
---
You just miss  the part where if NC dot is there so are the honorable third-party folks in Imperium
---
Thx, it is good to know that this option stay.
---
&gt;That and the thing is bloated. Having the store there is insulting.
---
You're acting like the buy Plex screen wasn't half of the last app. I don't care for the store much, but some people do.

Editing skills or applying SP is a gimmick, but being able to put characters on order is not..?

Okay mate. I personally use edit skills more than I'm bothered by re ordering the characters

This is my current plan, but i will need to throw a PC on top of it.

Their "issue" was offending the fee-fees of renters who were likely bots, and Sort decided keeping renters was more important than keeping a long time coalition member.
---
That is whys i said you have to mark them by using an hash key, which you can only identify (to be fake or real) if you know the salt to decrypt the hashkey
---
Not sure about "less features", but the blog did say they plan to add more to it over time. The current app is just a framework and some initial features to get it started.
---
Hopefully the newer features make it worth loading Unreal 4, because right now theres an awful lot of overhead for changing a queue around
---
They should announce 2020 as "The year of the Capsuleer" and devote the majority of the year specifically implementing ideas from the community and improving overall quality of life.  They should also try to actually make the game fun, which in never has been.
---
As soon as Brave makes a contribution to a campaign beyond feeding rorqs, let me know
---
This is some great stuff lebowski, I'm finding it very hard to nitpick specific issues (besides the whole escalation selling thing which isn't a big deal to me personally). But I do have 3 very small issues that I can see.
---
* If you're setting certain individual bookmarks to expire, I can forsee a lot of mistakes where bookmarks are set to expire unintentionally because people forget to change the option. I think that this would work better if we had the option to set a sub-folder to automatically set an expiry on any bookmarks saved there, rather than doing it per bookmark.
---
* Edge case here but worth pointing out - The longest a wormhole should last is 48h, however often wormholes last up to 1-2h longer than their intended lifespan, meaning bookmarks set to 2 days may expire before the wormhole. I'd suggest upping the 2 day expiry option to 3 days.
---
* Is the decision to set the newly created bookmark delay to 2 minutes for performance / technical purposes or for gameplay purposes? If it's the former then fair enough. If it's the latter then I can see this causing some issues in some cases, and I don't see a good reason for this limit. The current caching is annoying but we can currently bypass it by keeping reinforcements on login screen while a scout is scoping out a target.
---
The automod bot is currently a little broken and not is not updating the OP to show the modified discord link.
---
The correct discord link is: https://discord.gg/tWeMAek or you can use the perma link: animeistrash.org/eve

As a side note this should be fixed this upcoming week, god bless.

I've been on some pretty dysfunctional teams, but the problems were always much deeper than listening to the customers wrong.
---
It‚Äôs gonna take the biggest act of eve treachery yet to shake things up( where‚Äôs he judge when you need him) 
---
That or a change in mindset by a large portion of the player base who want to be on the winning side at the cost of having no one left to shoot at. 
---
One or several of the big imperium alliances are going to have to decide its more fun having less blues and switch sides or actually strike out on their own
---
I don't think you understand what half those words mean.
---
Would custom expire time be possible?
---
Yep, app specifically says, that you need an omega account to be able to manage skill training in any way
---
Titans are huge, there is no way the gravitational fields of dozens jumping in wouldn't cause ridiculous stress on each other.

But mostly, I'm going to be bitching about citadels and rorquals. Make a big point about mineral faucets and imo, we should get rid of asset safety.

‚ÄúThese new skins are only on sale for a limited time and will never be available again‚Äù
---
It's really true. Someone will complain about literally anything.
---
I see this as being annoying for selling escalations.
---
It was written for CCP by another company. CCP have created a new one inhouse, which better models connections to Eve, allowing for more functionality, such as the skill management. 
---
It's not finished, either.
---
Thanks, eastwest_indy.  I missed that, appreciate the help.
---
We'll at least they finally gave us side arms. Granted they can't be taken from the holster but I guess it's something from that awesome trailer of lies.
---
Watching that video I always wondered, if you killed a pod pilot when he's not in his pod is it perma-death?
---
Actually, it's something which has been asked for, by a fair number of people. Mostly when time limited skins have been added to the store.
---
Well...what can you do after killing an AT ship solo?
---
Well, I have mixed feelings about this. Is the massive blue donut healthy for eve? Probably not; however, I would argue that this massive blue donut does not exist because of RMT and especially not because 'grr goons.' 
---
The massive blue donut exists, as I keep telling people for a number of reasons. Chief among those is that wars costs too much:
---
1. They cost too much because fozzie sov is cancer;
---
2. Like real life;
---
    i. The cost too much because the economies of these large alliances 
---
       have become too intergrated;
---
    ii. Large conflict between what are essentially eve 'super powers' now 
---
       represents an existential threat to anyone engaging in it--there is 
---
       just too much to lose;
---
3. Because of the actions of CCP in as much as CCP through the drifter 
---
    event, blackout, cyno changes, etc., etc., has created a sense among 
---
    null sec alliances that they, as a group, are being singled out for 
---
    punitive game changes; 
---
    i. The community does not help, when wormholers and high-sec 
---
       players foam at the mouth about how awful null-sec is;
---
As far as point three goes, this has served to create a single null sec identity, and not only is it an identity, it is an identity built around the feeling that people are being attacked because of their collective null sec playstyle. 
---
When this happens it causes new in/out group notions to form, and once everyone in null sec starts thinking "we all have more in common with each other than we do with all of the other groups that spew hatred and demand how we play is nerfed" and what ensues is, as you can guess, null sec groups joining forces to fight against their perceived outgroup threat.
---
I would love to see battleships in generally get a 50% buff in tank and damage 30% increase in sig radius for shields and 50% for armor and leave everything else the same. That pushes shield doctrines out of the bombs= instant death levels and makes them viable. It also makes bomber more effective at applying to armor tanked ones. Also this makes it where BS size guns actually all apply without needing target painters(Looking at you cruie missiles.) Obviously as the meta shifts CCP can then tweak them up and down to a balance. As it stood before hacs online yet again only 4-5 Battleships were even viable as a doctrine. Plus the increase in damage and tank puts them more in the middle of Battlecruisers and capitals. Right now some BCs can get close the a BB tank without being big slow and applying shit damage.
---
You may not remember it, but it was there.
---
And in the new app, it's just another button, down at the bottom of the screen. easy enough to ignore
---
there is not nearly enough glue huffing going on here to qualify as an accurate depiction of goons
---
Its not really that big of a difference, if you wanted to scam somebody with the old system, just make a fake bookmark, they would have zero way to know. Involves exactly the same amount of trust.
---
Those numbers are correct.
---
Fighting the blob one outnumbered fleet at a time!
---
Nobody has asked where it is that you're going into low sec that you're getting blown up.
---
Gate camps (people hanging around gates with the intent of blowing up shit that jumps through) are more a thing on beaten-path routes. The Nourvukaiken gate in Tama is a lot more likely to be camped than is the Ushi gate in Ishomilken or the Oisio gate in Hysera. (And the same kind of reasoning applies to entrances to null... in general, when proceeding into lower-security class space than you're currently in, look for a border system with low traffic.)
---
 
---
Get away from the shortest-distance hauler routes between hubs and you'll have better luck finding low-sec border systems that you can enter without getting mugged.
---
ganking catalysts.
---
Some people just "know" these things. We're not supposed to question it.
---
You can't think of a way to steal from a freighter?
---
They are not ruining everything, just one thing. All of WH and most people using WH (yes, that include NS alliances) will have it be a lot less of a PITA to use WH.
---
i also thought it would be so cool if they started up a new server
---
This... looks like more work than alliance bookmarks.
---
Custom expire time would make the UI a little slower / clunkier to use, and there's not use cases I can think of off the top of my head for custom expiry where just setting it to 3 days wouldn't be acceptable.
---
The unfortunate part is that it is mostly a failure of dev time (though I guess that is probably true of just about every wish we have for EVE)
---
* Bookmarks are currently inventory items
---
* ACLs don't apply to inventory items
---
* CCP makes Bookmarks a NewThing(TM) so ACLs work
---
* Bookmarks are no longer items and cannot be hauled, contracted, etc.
---
What is unfortunate is that there is still, of course, the coded idea of bookmarks as items (vouchers) in EVE.  It probably isn't too much of a leap to envision some kind of "drag to create voucher" feature where you essentially spawn an item using the information present in the ACL version of a bookmark.  Who knows how much coding effort that takes but on the surface it seems logical such a thing could exist.
---
it would. but i would hate to loose ALL my progression, and IRL money put in on plex transfers. the issue would be it could split the community, not somthing the playerbase could handle atm.. but its a nice thought to rewind time
---
[deleted]
---
Curious on the limit of three active shared folders.  It seems like this would lead to a lot of micromanagement of what bookmarks you can use at a time, if you keep them organized in different folders, such as docking BMs, wormhole BMs, corporate BMs, gate tac BMs, etc., etc.
---
Edit:  I should add, really excited generally about these changes, especially for managing bookmarks across alts
---
I mean, that's a gameplay niche that's going to disappear (selling bookmarks to 10/10 escalations). It's by slowly losing gameplay niches over time that this game became what it is today.
---
20 minutes
---
Still fully able to sell access to the folder. Fucks sake
---
Can we not spoiler alert this stuff? even the title? and have it state its revealing future content?
---
triglavian in different to faction also...
---
He's not even good at that because GOTG retreated to Deklein, which is pretty terrible space for current mechanics, and abandoned Branch, which is a much better region to pack your coalition into.
---
Yeah, make something already unpractical even more unpractical right ?
---
Yeah let's keep shit code and mechanics that are garbage just so you can sell 10/10 bookmarks marginally easier. Are you actually that fucking retarded?
---
Yeah not talking about them.
---
Alphas can use rattle, right? That‚Äôs your best bet for an upgrade. If you‚Äôre not looking to upgrade, praxis is your best bet
---
The game is extremely multifauceted and you cant move a piece without striking a few others in the process or it wouldn't be a proper change at all.
---
Start a new character and see how utterly annoying it is. And cyno changes have nothing to do with anything lol.
---
That's the beauty of it : we won't need to enforce it. Right now the Amarr mission hubs are falling to us and vice versa. We can't dock in a system controlled by the opposite faction.
---
As long as FW alliances &amp; corps agree not to send their pvpers to take a system, the agents will remain out of reach.
---
is that daily or weekly?
---
&gt;Unless CCP decides to actually put effort into killing bots functionality it will remain wack-a-mole.
---
Congratulations, you finally got my point! Have a gold star!
---
That's a novel idea. Wonder why no one thought of it yet.
---
I assume vouchers in corp hangars will be put in the default corp bookmarks folder?  Will this include bookmarks currently in cans?  We have substantially more than 500 stored this way at present.
---
&gt;As a side note this should be fixed this upcoming week, god bless.
---
[suuuuurrrreeeeee](https://i.imgur.com/FXLThSZ.jpg)
---
No they don't. You can run the emerging conduits solo in a well tanked BC.
---
By that logic, we should strip out the market + contracts system and only leave the trading window. 
---
I'm sure that would be great for the game /s.
---
We literally pinged baltecs yesterday
---
They won't need to optimize the engine for 5k player fights if only 600 people play the game anymore.
---
Nightmares present a one-size-fits-all solution to 90% of fleets that aren't 150+ HACs, where you just can't trade fast enough to be isk positive.
---
Machariels are sometimes used by small groups, but aren't really seen outside of lowsec or some smaller russian groups in null.
---
These Pirate BSes are the only ones that can even somewhat effectively deal with fighter blobs, nightmares by being the only battleship that can sort of sig tank and machariels by just being really fast and also warping fast to ping around and keep control of a fight. Everything else can't survive against capitals and is too slow to be worth using in 90% of cases. 
---
You will sometimes see leshaks in lowsec as well, since they can get some pretty strong tank and the ability to use amulet pods makes them significantly stronger.
---
T1 battleships are too slow and immobile to keep up with HACs, to big and plodding to deal with capitals, and have a host of other minor problems such as shitty lock times, slow warp speeds, and a vulnerability to bombing runs. Boosh ravens are the only T1 battleship doctrine deployed by a large group, and that's a cheese doctrine.
---
Grind for your first omega time is boring; one should NOT encourage newborns to do this.

In my experience 10/10s get bought up instantly anyways. So it doesn‚Äôt really matter
---
All this, plus the Jita 4-4 expansion, and you've covered the bases.
---
If you can find a Game Gear that still works without a full refurb on the inside and/or a new screen panel.
---
It is almost as if they have no idea how we actually play in this game day to day...
---
Its hard to say. This last nerf didnt really nerf the income of Rorqs even though it was an excav nerf since many stopped using the ship. That raised the price of ore making the nerf less harsh (maybe not even being a nerf, it was hard to tell tho since the blackout came rather quickly after).
---
If you remove excavs it will drive off more Rorq pilots (raising ore prices) but I think the dedicated miner will just start using subs to mine (lowering prices), like it was originally intended. I think all in all it would be a nerf but not as bad as one might think. 
---
Still think they should do it but carefully and with a lot of "niceness". Give Rorq pilots the chance to remove some of their specific ship SP back and put up NPC orders for Rorq buybacks (maybe at 1b or something).
---
Still have access to sell them, but just through some bullshit new mechanism that is more of a ball ache than it was before..
---
Moving to an ACL based system
---
We will have done this for all corporations on Duality, so I encourage you to log in and take a look at how it worked out :)

yea i did watch a few video's first they recommended the same thing i finished the tutorial and im going threw the agent missions now.
---
4 Rorq lost in a month is feeding now?
---
Better not say that to your new PH masters their Rorq loss rate makebthem look incompetant in comparison.
---
Also you way we font fontribute and in the same breath say we kept blobbing you during the Frat war you gotta stick to one narrative you are making yourself look like an raging salty idiot.
---
Hahahahaha, FRT not empire builders, hahahahaha!
---
They just need a role bonus for 2x or 3x bonus from extenders and plates
---
This is exactly what I was thinking about while reading this post. Make it extremely hard to build trig dreads, like titans were in 2005 or 2006.
---
Full overhaul of the bookmark system. The new version has access controlled folders and it's pretty sweet. Now you don't need to give a physical bookmark anymore, you can just grant access to the folder. 
---
That means no more bookmark contracts however, so you'll just have to send the money directly and have the seller manually grant access to the buyer at the time of sale.
---
I mean look at it from a more zoomed out perspective for a bit.
---
So for an alliance to turn into a rorqual farming entity there internal culture and playstyle has to change they have to behave more like an empire and less with the primary goal being the most fun place to live especially given they start with a core player base that was there for something other then rorqual mining.
---
That's still the case because people that want to rorqual mine are generally already in goons and if they really hate goons they join test ( even know there is literally no difference but people hate stuff for irrational reasons ). 
---
Now could a NC. or a PL do the same absolutely and they would likely have been in a better position today, they would also no longer be NC or PL similar to how Test of today is really not like the Test pre-rorquals or the best example of this brave of today.
---
Now the question becomes is the logo on a sov map what mappers or having unique groups.
---
GET BACK TO WORK ON THE APPLICATION QUEUE!!!
---
Edit: Wow some major saltboi downvoted you for saying happy cake day.

The NC. Downvote brigade is out in force today.

Babies must be really butthurt about PH being the new leaders of PandaFam.
---
* Contact seller, agree to trade
---
* Send seller isk
---
* Seller grants buyer access to folder with bookmark
---
Slightly more complicated and requires a bit more activity on the seller's part but not exactly game breaking.
---
I'm finally going to plex an alt for the purpose of scouting wormholes, PI, hauling and rolling wormholes in support of my main.
---
Once I hit 5 mil sp I plan to just extract any SP beyond that to help plex the alt. Is this viable?
---
Are you mental ? What about the trig ships are getting ignored, it's an addition iv not heard anyone complain about. Till u
---
Most of them still suffer from anemic damage and application also some pretty tight fitting space. Doubling the damage and ehp on most of them as a base opens up more options for fitting teams to theory craft applications lock speed movement and cap life. without constraining them to you still need to fit to X amount of ehp to play.
---
Yes.
---
What's so hard about starting a new character and injecting all the books you want and setting up a skillqueue?
---
I'm failing to see your problem here, I can't think of any scenario where you'd need to rush changing the character skilling on one account.
---
See, you're looking at it from the perspective of getting good umbrella coverage, because you're anticipating using the umbrella in combat as the first option.  Sort's looking at it from the perspective of being as far away from everything as possible, with even umbrella combat being an absolute last resort.  Look at this map: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Deklein#npc24 Everything past the 3T7 choke can only be jumped to from within Deklein.  Everything in the pipe towards Branch can only be jumped to from multiple gates into Deklein.  It's impossibly remote, and that's all Sort wants, to be left alone to krab.
---
Which in the context of the question means that they're effectively paying 50m for their omega subscription.
---
Yeah and critically it doesn't require any more trust than it did before since you could always get a fake BM
---
What means "HAC"?
---
 yes but adapt or adjust as cheaply as possible for a good ton of reward.
---
If they remove wormholes where will we rat safely? Don't be silly now
---
a Danish corp, who is generally hated by the danish community in eve because the CEO fireball thinks hes some kind of important politician.
---
Not even a single guy from PL in a PanFam fleet? Is there some reason behind that?
---
well looks fun :)
---
Heavy Assault Cruiser, T2 cruisers
---
Eagles, Cerbs, Ishtar ect
---
Praxis is like dirt cheap these days. Rattle is a bit expensive for an alpha I would imagine.
---
Hac (pronounced hack) means Heavy Assault Cruiser. The T2 DPS cruiser ship class.
---
The theory that new players require training wheels and kid glove treatment in order to become successful is a fallacy. That's not how EVE works. I'm disappointed that your opinion of new players is so low. One of the distinguishing qualities of EVE is that you don't need a high character 'level' and a fat bank balance to be capable.
---
Nerfing the game to allow anyone to prosper is not a solution. That would only remove any sense of accomplishment. 
---
Losing a ship to another player is the very thing that's most likely to give a new player a reason to become passionate about EVE. When left to their own devices they become bored with the predictable PvE and quit without saying anything.
---
Because you still are having to go to one account, pause, then go to another to start it. Doing on app removes steps. Sorry that you lack the capacity to understand. 
---
Good day.
---
Initially, probably ye. But the yield difference isnt that big, the tank and utility still is ofc. However, you are sitting on tons of SP you can extract. That might convince plenty to go that route.
---
And ofc, I dont think the new miners will go that route since Rorqs are a much larger investment (mainly SP). It will take time for the meta to actually change. Long term I dont think Rorqs will be as as common if excavs were removed.
---
I still think we need another approach though. Like excav removal is one good way but I would rather they went with a limit to how many can be used in a cluster. Like a "cant use indy core within 1000km of another" type of thing.
---
You can keep the excavs in that scenario, initially atleast, and see how it works out.
---
No, your omega still costs the total expense (cost) for the flex + multiple training certificates. Your net profit is -50m.
---
We can go on duality and test it out. Not having the 10 bookmark limit would be just wonderful.
---
Yeah, great idea. You gotta take a page out of runescape's book and routinely be adding shit that's bigger and badder. It keeps players interested and has 0 downsides
---
u/CCP_Lebowski If you let players share more than 3 folders you could open up new play styles of selling locations of interest. Maybe ‚Äò20 shared folders with players‚Äô x ‚Äò75 bookmarks each‚Äô instead of 3x500
---
I was.
---
Now what does that have to do with this?
---
That is exactly the distinction I was trying to make. It still costs the same, you just generate revenue in a way that makes it less time commitment to manage.
---
We need a zkill guide
---
Can you let us mark bookmark folders can-not-copy to prevent this insidious unethical spying I‚Äôm hearing of?
---
I don't blame them.
---
Does it really count as feeding if you're outnumbered that much?
---
I literally took out baltecs yesterday lmao
---
The limit of 10 bookmarks at a time is only for vouchers, which we are removing. Copying or moving bookmarks between folders is much faster and already nearly unlimited on TQ. Initial testing of copying 3000 BM's at a time looks quite acceptable (at least from a server point of view), but we are still running further tests for sure.
---
lmao did you lmao.  that's nice dear.
---
Game gear with no power cable, you mean a paperweight?
---
Well if you don't, contracts are also not an option.
---
-New mobile game update / announcements
---
Y'know IRL there's always that one friend who is really nice to you and generally a great dude, but is a massive raging asshole to people he knows who made lifestyle choices that don't quite align with his world view?
---
Yeah that's what it feels like to be in a corp with one of those "As a wormholer..." reddit posters.
---
Escalations aren't so reliably obtained that you can make an activity of chain-running escalations based solely on your own obtained sites. And having to shift gears from ratting to escalations causes a lot of down time. Basically, if you don't cash out hard from the escalation you end up wasting a bunch of potential time/isk
---
This would be so sweet :(
---
I guess its time to invest in Blue Loot.
---
When I started playing EVE I immediately joined BRAVE, I tnink it was in 2014ish and BRAVE just moved into null. Kiters from all of EVE would come to our home system and farm our frigates with offgrid links; a pilot called KillerGX would get 100+ kills with his slicer each day. And then CCP released the (unnerfed) Garmur and Orthrus... PL likes to use their old sniper Tengus. Station camps were a thing and our station was camped by a fleet usually when I log on. We would undock a massive kitchen sink fleet to attempt to free our undock. But it's real cool to see the kiters slow down, die or leave system after their offgrid link gets probed and killed. 2014 EVE was a lot more fun even when I lost 10 times more often.
---
I've done eve on and off for a decade or so. I get sucked in, spend a few months, then real. Life work and family pull me away.
---
I've been an alpha only player for a while and I'm perfectly happy with that. I can't get the biggest ships or own corporations or any of that, but for fly a frigate into battle, exploring wormholes looking for sweet sweet treasure, or just mining to gather funds for a bad day trading idea, it's great.
---
One word of advice. Set aside at least 2 hrs for the first go at eve and get through the tutorial and a couple agents at one go. It will help a lot in your understanding and you'll get several different ships and some funds to start out.
---
The game is dying
---
On a different note,
---
&gt;I'm hopeful for some pretty major news but I've been a bit disappointed lately. Still, I'm enjoying the game and remaining optimistic.
---
Mind if I ask what's giving you hope/keeping you optimistic? 
---
Personally, I've been pretty bummed out. From what little I know we've got similar play styles (I actually use your hunting tactics video as a reference to train newbros), which I feel has been pretty consistently nerfed over the last few years. In your opinion, what's the silver lining these days?
---
Our art team has been working tirelessly on our reimagining of the bellicose! New skins for endurance ( not prospect or venture ), cyclone, some other shit no one flies. 
---
All players will have to solve a random trigonometry question. Effort to keep bots from logging in. 
---
Excavator drones capacity halved, speed increased 10%, look at them bad drones go.
---
Cyno gen no longer required to be in your fleet. Jump to any cyno you see and now you can see them all! C H A O S B I T C H!
---
&gt;New players have always had a high washout rate early in the game.
---
Just because this is the case and more data now supporting how bad it is -- it doesn't mean it's okay and ignore it. It needs to change. There's a segment in EVE that is not a sandbox since the beginning of time and that's high sec and starting systems. This segment of the game should continued to be strengthened.
---
CCP's already moved towards nerfing bully mechanics like high sec war decs. It's the right step. I think more ideas along this direction will help.
---
&gt;What we're really talking about here is reinventing EVE to be more palatable to a wider audience.  Which means losing its niche and competing on level ground with more conventional games.
---
No, we want them to get out of high sec so they can actually play the rest of the game.
---
Being blown to bits after a few days or weeks and new players quitting the game is no good. This is not "reinventing" anything -- it is reinforcing retention.
---
&gt;To complicate things, as time goes on, I feel that fewer gamers find the idea of exploring EVE's extreme libertarian universe to be exciting.
---
Baseless statement here, no data.
---
&gt;I see that as systemic discrimination against, and devaluing of, the established playerbase.
---
Enhancing player retention is a buff to the established playerbase. More people coming into advanced play areas (low/wh/null).
---
As for random generic gripes and not specific to my comments about new player experience, then yes, we can have those random generic gripes with no substance of data all day, just know its not related to what I'm talking about.
---
I like this
---
best 10 minutes of my gaming time!!
---
Correct, but you also need another mptc for your main char.
---
It also seems logical (at least to me) that a logout button could exist, so we can switch characters without closing the client. Unfortunately CCP have said they won't be doing this because of the months of dev time it would take. 15-year-old spaghetti code is truly a beast to deal with.
---
These changes make  selling bookmarks a PITA, but are a huge game-changer to basically any other scenario where you need to share bookmarks between people.
---
Amazing. I remember those days, I'm a boring sober person now :(
---
GF
---
Because it's stupid?
---
Tbh this is a good copy pasta for all the ‚Äúwormholer btw‚Äù posts
---
Yeah 2 mptc plus omega plus extractors and taxes etc
---
This is more like six steps forward one step back. It's a minor inconvenience in exchange for a feature that's been heavily requested for 10 years. Hopefully they figure out a middle ground.
---
Probably going to allow botting and Rmt seeing as they do fuck all about it now.
---
To save time. Period.
---
There is no reason to bitch about the app like a blue waffle, but here you are.
---
And again, I said good day!
---
we need a zkill guide on how to save this game, actually.....
---
And after months of complaining, they'll nerf the Proteus.
---
goddamnit
---
XD Feel free to laugh then!  I know little about him.
---
Thank you for all the info! I'm both doing exploration for ISK in a covops and trying to learn to hunt in an astero, so I appreciate it.
---
With your idea, you're still going to need to convert bookmarks between the two "types" (items or ACL) when you move bookmarks from personal to shared, so would be the same amount of legwork for CCP.
---
Unless you're saying that you shouldn't be able to move bookmarks between the two groups, that would suck even more. What if I accidentally bookmark something that I intented to share as a personal bookmark? Instead of a simple drag and drop, I'd have to go back and re-bookmark.
---
The actual proposed system allows you to make a temporary folder and add a buyer to the ACL. Then you can just delete the folder the next day. It even has an advantage over the current system - there's no need for the buyer to come over to a specific station to pick up the bookmark. You can complete the sale while both docked in different systems. The only PITA part is that you can no longer just stick it on contract and log off. You have to be there to make the sale.
---
First time player. What do I need to know?
---
Same. I'm part of the crew that thought Dust 514 had a lot of potential, so I not only do I hope for Nova, but I also hope for a PvP Nova with vehicles.
---
I feel like keeping both systems would've been a good system either way. I'm not sure why they removed the system we had before.
---
Dude you have to add a /s (for sarcasm) at the end, this subreddit is full of people who would say that seriously...
---
You were not serious, right?
---
I would *not* take this fit into a C3. Tank is thin, and no tracking or range mods mean it can't hit frigates or battleships. Sleepless Upholders like to sit at 65 km! C2s are definitely more suited for alphas. Those can be comfortably run in a battlecruiser, even by an alpha.
---
In CCP's defense, a better NPE could be vital to the survival of their company. I agree with the other points though.
---
it already exists.
---
Don't purchase things out of CCP or trusted third parties. What is killing the game is people actually creating a business by accepting to pay money for external services.
---
drek has command burst option !!
---
Angel caps?
---
Yeah but you can only have 5 total, and you don't have the resolution of only sharing 1 bm you have to share the whole folder.
---
For lowsec the current kings are the Bhaalgorn Leshak combination. and the Armor machariel.

The idea that it's "old code" that is the problem is laughable. Yes, old code can be a major problem in development cycles, but regardless of how bad the code is there are always ways around it. It's a problem with the \*\*current\*\* devs being bad at envisioning solutions.
---
We want a "log out to character" button. CCP says old code would make it months of work. That means the client probably retains way too much stuff in a way that it couldn't release easily to switch characters. The problem with that line of thinking? They still have a launcher that \*does\* maintain the status of an account; meaning, it has visibility into your connectivity. It could be as simple as closing the client and then pushing a message to the launcher to attempt to launch the client again for the given account. If the launcher is closed or something goes wrong...the game would just close anyway. The launcher probably only maintains visibility of online status of accounts, but adding another flag to the response wouldn't be too hard.
---
Do I think it's all "easy"? No, but it wouldn't be "months of work". If they truly believe it would take **months** to make a change like this they are ridiculous bad at their jobs.
---
Can't really reject your logic there because its true.
---
Considering they're already going to convert from old-to-new they have to come up with a sustainable system for doing so anyway...so it wouldn't be that hard to reverse the process.
---
Indeed. If in doubt use a reputable broker.
---
I saw some video guides where people complete this anomaly with Praxis without warping out.
---
Well, at the moment it's pretty grim honestly, but I came back because of the blackout and I know plenty of others who did as well and while it had some pretty big downsides in the way they implemented it, I was really happy they were at least trying something. 
---
This is just pure speculation on my part but I think their intention was to iterate on blackout while it was still active and bring some balance back to the risk vs reward in 0.0 but then caved due to pressure from their new owners because of declining profits. Some of which was encouraged by very negative teary eyed morons who can only see as far as their flashing wallet and couldn't possibly conceptualize the fact that what's good for them personally may be bad for the game as a whole. Which, granted is CCPs job to recognize and fix but the crying players just collectively pushed a lot of people away from the game with all the negativity, especially here on reddit.
---
I get it, it's a business, but I think the short term monetary downside was outweighed by making big plays to try and unfuck the game since it has unfortunately stagnated and was/is on the path to a very boring equilibrium and life support until it's unplugged. 
---
All I'm saying is, if the writing is on the wall that the game is doomed they might as well swing for the fences trying to save it, and I'm optimistic because they have swung for the fences and hit home runs in the past, so it is still possible.
---
Can you share your fit please?
---
Only if you forget to apply scarcity to both sides of the transaction.
---
The people outside your time zone can't sell bookmarks to you anymore.  Which means there's both fewer buyers *and* fewer sellers.
---
Even before Rorquals this was the case. In 2015 a Triage archon costs like 1.6 B cheap fit and still handily outrepped and out-tanked 5 guardians. A Moros still easily out-DPS and out-tank 10 Megathrons, which is what they cost in minerals.
---
The fact of the matter is the jump in power between caps and subs is way too large for their cost difference. So you either nerf capitals down to a price point relevant to their cost (~3 times the DPS/Tank of a battleship), or fix their cost to be proportional to their power (which is this proposal).
---
 You're being prejudiced with alphas haha. I pay but omega but I have alts alpha.
---
The only mobile thing that would get me excited is a stripped down mobile client of the actual god damn game. 
---
This would almost instantly fix player counts and populate space.
---
My brother showed me eve echos on his phone and it's so close anyway, I hope so bad they just go for it.
---
my alt no have skill missils yet
---
Precisely, people are way too risk averse to even try using them outside of their group ops, and FCs aren't as much inclined to possibly to welp entire cap fleets. 
---
Caps are already pain to use without support, and if it's not somewhere when friendly cavalery can arrive fast enough, they can be dead pretty fast. Supers, are much more forgiving in that regard, but they'll die fast enough, provided you can give that intel to someone with keys to nearby dread cache.
---
&gt;people that farm these sites are NOT afk by any means
---
They are when they go to bed.
---
All the 10/10s I've sold were bought outside my timezone.  Granted I'm not farming them so the number sold is tiny.
---
I still think the change is worth it, but that doesn't mean the change isn't creating a PITA that was not all that hard to account for - don't remove the voucher object, and let us create one from the new and exciting bookmark window.
---
Which makes it better.
---
Or Band Of Brothers. Goon can shiver, they will take back Delve...
---
No sorry, there is no bob.
---
?
---
Refer to my previous post.
---
AAA please do that we could use the excitement.
---
retention is a good thing but first make sure your current playerbase isnt on the verge of quitting
---
the only comment that i would have cared about as noob (and the thing that the guy obviously asked for) is all the way down on -1 while the top comment talks some bs about how he should do missions
---
lol
---
U forgot to block local, and the victim, and your fleet members, and the grid, and the screen
---
Didn't a bunch of former BOB members end up in Goons?
---
Add it as a supplemental option to existing subscriptions. 5 bucks more a month to have a mobile option. I'm sure they could make their money on it somehow.
---
Dreads    Triglavians     There are options.
---
fuck
---
More context please, at the moment the only thing that makes this unique is that it's in the only named system in Syndicate
---
Look at dat fukken cat

you dont fit a scram to your sabres?  I mean fuck me, do you reaaaaallly need a step by step guide to catching a DST

Makes me giggle how you all prefer needing a freighter to come scoop this thing over just catching a DST XD
---
No. I can think of like 2.
---
Imagine being proud feeding to horde. Chuck my dude, come back to FW lowsec. Horde does not deserve content delivered to their doorstep like this.
---
Desperation for content doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be content with feeding fleets just for a fight. There are better fights out there my dude. 
---
Groups like horde who don‚Äôt understand how to respond appropriately need to be starved of content until they change.
---
Feeding to horde isn‚Äôt good content, it goes to show just how desperate this game is for content. Don‚Äôt fight for the fight, fight to win, fighting just for the sake of content and feeding to horde has casualized this game past the point where probably only a few dozen pilots in game still play competitively.
---
Stop feeding horde out of desperation for content, there are better fights out there.
---
They'll probably just put up a slideshow of the checks PA wrote everyone and then walk out as it plays to the score of "Bitch better have my money" by AMG.
---
Dread v dread shit has been happening like this going on 2 years. The main difference is that Darkness. intentionally denied ncdot + panfam opportunities to kill supers/titans.  My recommendation to everyone playing is to build dread caches in npc 0.0 pockets and bait out dummies, then enjoy the fruits of a good dreadbomb or two.
---
Eve needs a lot more of that.   Would solve most issues people complain about.
---
.... You think so small.  Don‚Äôt forget there are rorqual groups who can single handedly build 20 dreads a day.
---
Now realize there are dozens of those in each alliance.
---
Make maelstroms great again
---
AnOtHeR BoTtEr DoWn LoL
---
yup that too, and calling this a niche is weird as it's a common part of nullsec PvE
---
Or, we could... not.
---
To be fair I'd call this three steps forward and one back. Alliance bookmarks, bookmarks you can open up to friends to give them a wormhole chain, and expiring bookmarks are all great additions.
---
I only have one rorqs (just started rorqing 2 weeks ago) and have never built a cap but it sounds like i need to stop parking it on moon fracks.
---
And everyone wonders why the player base is dying. "Nah you're just bad, now devote more of your time to this dumpster fire of a game or just GTFO cuz were l33t around here."
---
Fucking castrate yourself.
---
It's both, they have the Russian stubbornness and the mental issues of an eve player.
---
And there have been, for two years.
---
lets also remove nullsec and lowsec, because according to CCP stats highsec, and market like Jita specifically are the most popular places to be.
---
who cares if those chars logged in there are just market alts of all other players...
---
Problem is, that these fights are rare
---
Why is that a problem to anyone...?  ‚ÄúTHEY HAVE CAPITALS OMG &gt;: ( HOW COULD THEY GRRR‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs just stupid man stop it
---
Don't grant access until after payment??
---
&gt;And then they don't give access to the bookmark. Whoops.
---
Hey, it's me, your contract with a fake bookmark.
---
 This game is unsustainable without alpha unless ccp changes the way it handles more accounts.
---
Basically this change is slightly inconvenient for 0.1% of people who actually sell bm's and extremely useful for everyone else flying in non-corp only fleets. Having someone in a friendly Corp following you around and bookmarking your bm's was a pain in the ass and this is a damn welcome change.    
---
Now my "coalition" can just have folders with access shared between us all. Fantastic.
---
Imagine a game so starved for content you post an AAR after getting blobbed. 0_o
---
Well to be honest they got the devs they got, how many people would like to move to iceland for a job with average pay. Its good they still have some devs
---
Hey I fucking loved the jukebox... Literally flipped my shit the day they changed the icons to the shit show they are now.
---
Keep fighting the good fight against the wormholer poster menace powers. I'd happily delete my reddit account if it meant every other wormholer had to delete theirs as well.
---
I, for one, do thank you and share EVERYTHING you've done in here and in Eve, and I can't but sympathize with you for your efforts in FCON. You're one hell of a straight-to-the-point guy, what eve needs, but doesn't deserve, especially CCP.
---
Its just funny. I remember when we used to play in Syndicate!
---
&gt;I've already surrendered my dignity.
---
Obviously, you just told the whole world how fucking useless and depressing your occupation is.
---
Was gone a long time for RL reasons so have missed a lot. What have been ‚Äúhome run‚Äù changes?

How many days since the last dev blog?

that's exactly why your business sucks. Proof? You're here.

This one was difficult to cut up as we fought in 3 different locations, 3 different doctrines. The second 'fight' was like a 30s-tagged-us-on-gate so I decided not to feature it as video rendering time is killing my soul today.

---
Non-wormholer here, surprise! Not to spoil all of your hard work, but this is a feature I've never wanted, or thought about wanting. In my 13 years of playing eve, I have mostly made my own bookmarks and had someone trade them with me. 
---
On the other hand, I have probably sold bookmarks on contracts over a thousand times. Now this will require much more effort, which is incredibly annoying. While I am glad that CCP continues to cater game changes to maybe 13% of the player base, could you not have come up with a system whereby an object could be generated so that individual bookmarks could be sold the old fashioned way? You know, in the same way you will be able to past links now, couldn't dragging the bookmark into your item hangar have created an... never mind. 
---
I literally give up even trying to get you guys to think through how changes you make impact other aspects of the game.
---
You are pretty much spot on. What again did Grath contribute to the general benefit of the game or the community again during these 13 years?
---
Man you've got it all figured out huh?
---
When's your biography gonna hit the shelves? I'm sure it'll be a FASCINATING read.
---
"There's 2 kinds of people in the world" STFU.

Anyone who thinks they can condense the the entirety of human psychology into 2 distinct and well defined groups is a fucking moron.
---
Ya know, I miss Makalu.  He went to PL and retired.  :(
---
could be like 50K, does it translate to earnings directly? no. The funny part is devs don't want to work for free anymoe.
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Be different; fly a muninn like everyone else.
---
Didn't they already live in Insmother in 2004? I remember reading this in Empires of Eve
---
You'll just grant them access to the folder. For corporations, you can grant the whole corporation access and everyone will be able to use them.

Wormholers are cute.

I mean they literally just are a 3 point coordinate # lol

Bring back the Circus Maximus

Suicide gank stuff worth 100m in highsec or camp gates in low/null.
---
You are mixing up THE GENERAL HEALTH OF THE GAME and ALLIANCE X. 
---
I have never seen Grath promote anything that he could not reap the benefits off personally or for the sake of PL. The point is, with his well known persona he could have added weight into people advocating good changes for the health of the GENERAL GAME AS A WHOLE. That means, since you have been missing the point over and over, high-sec, low-sec, null-sec AND WH space. 
---
I am still waiting for an example.

CCP used Unreal Engine to allow mobile phones to interact with the API? LOL... no wonder this game is shit and dying.

Skill farming is generally profitable but it depends a lot on how you're buying and selling the PLEX/MPTC and Injectors.
---
Current profitability: https://eveintel.net/index.php?p=market_plex (updates every 15 mins unless ESI takes a shit)
---
I have very bad luck with that sort of thing.  Games I get that for die.
---
Making it your mission to shit on every person in as pithy a manner as possible that doesn't share your very specific opinion and world view isn't what I would call an achievement.
---
Sorry but "IT'S A CAPITAL SHIP" is no longer a relevant defence when there are more active capital ships in the game than most Battleship hulls. angry-mustache is completely right in his analysis, Capital Ships break eve's Jedi Curve, and this was fine when they actually meant something. But Capital Ships are no longer difficult to obtain, produce or fly.

Oh this again. How many times has he quit now?

Grath's [12 Black Legion Spies](https://soundcloud.com/nan-6/xxxgrath-ragexxx-full-version) rant created more entertainment for the community than you ever will.

It can't hurt to try... so you probably should. You can mess around for free now so the only real cost is your time. 
---
But honestly, Eve is not it a great place right now, especially PvP-wise.  
---
A lot of things need attention, and there appears to be a bit of a leadership/direction problem at CCP these days. 
---
Also, they are apparently spending 80% of the dev time this year working on new player content and the new player experience. I'd probably hold off until they announce the release of that later this winter, or at the latest next spring before making your next attempt.
---
Evil Thug, where are you!?

EVE is in a far better place right now than r/eve. Compared to a decade ago there are many, many more user friendly portions of the game.

He was one of those content creators that made wars happen in the past. There are not many players like that in the game left. Most just sit afk on a belt in rorquals or something.

is that "log in when someone catches something"?

Like, I get that you are proud of being in a storied and strong alliance and good corp, but if you don't personally do anything different than Generic Alliance Member #0193019 in NullBlob Alliance #111391 please get off your high horse.

Krabs are hardly known for adapting well, but rather screaming about how others should

been playing since 2015, who is this guy?
---
&gt; Make it extremely hard to build trig dreads
---
Well this has certainly never gone wrong before.
---
i can name a great many genocidal dictators, but few scientists.

just because a person is well known, doesn't mean their contribution was of positive value.

The Rokh has its place!

Battleships are still uses in wormholes for eviction fleets and defense fleets.

Best counter to the leshak meta is to just alpha the leshak. Vindi + Arty Nag or a group of Arty BSs is the way to go there.

nobody is really interested in yet another damage cap timer that the other side aren't going to bother contesting. which is pretty much most wars these days.

This is 2019 lol who needs to move to Iceland to be a software developer? At my company a good 20% are remote employees, and the number's only that low because we have offices all over the world. If we're talking about "how many aren't at the corporate office, where all of the main data is stored", then it's probably closer to like 75% are remote.
---
You don't have to \*live\* somewhere to \*work\* somewhere, in tech.
---
Yep
---
Look Dave, just because you have an encyclopedic list of mass murderers vs. scientists rocking around up in that grey canopy of a brain doesn't mean that the rest of us do.
---
Who?
---
Hello, i have trained for a Marauder and an Orca back when I had Omega.
---
If I do not currently have Omega status, when I log in will I be able to use those ships or will they be unavailable for me because I dont have Omega?
---
Locked out.
---
Vastly overlooking his leadership and military capability in PL in favor of his pithy one-liners.
---
To be quite honest, if I had to deal with redditbots posting their slipshod, half-baked opinions or angry nullbears who just want their peaceful krablands to sung kumbaya in for now and forever, my patience would run thin as well.
---
Autism isn't an illness, it's a feature.
---
Came to say the same, who?
---
Yes
---
See I'd disagree with some of that. Speaking as someone that has multiple Rorqs there is \*absolutely\* reason to use other vessels to mine, and they absolutely have a purpose. Capital Mining ships didn't ruin the market/game. I'd argue the way they've nerfed them has ruined \*them\*, more than anything. Now these ships are worth 8b+ and mine like 110m/hour (meaning it's 72h of mining, minimum, to even just pay for the ship). Lose your active Excavs to a bomb? That's another 4 hours of mining just to recoup that cost.
---
The problem isn't Rorqs...it's just the proliferation of them. There should be a limit to how many can sit on a site so people have to stretch out.
---
The problem isn't "nerfs", in general, it's that they take the shortest route. Delve mining too much? Make the primary ship they use to mine a piece of garbage. All it does is drastically hurt people that \*aren't\* in big corporations/alliances, which is the opposite of what they said they're trying to fix. The people that saved up for a year and a half to get the skills to fly a Rorq and buy one are now shit-out-of-luck with a ship that probably won't ever make back what it cost to buy.
---
Take an upvote instead. Joined PL, stayed a month, poured bleach in my ears and took a year break to regain sanity.
---
Leadership so good they didn't adapt for 3 years.
---
People. What a bunch of bastards
---
somebody else already beat your lame slow ass to this one bud.
---
Syndicate was unfortunately very sad come \~2014/2015.
---
I mean if u want to break it down to its simplest form then sure.. everyone logs in, boards a ship and plays the game!
---
Oh no, the empires in a 16 year old game might fall, how will we ever recover.
---
Thats most def true. But I dont think people would skill into them if it took longer to pay it back. Like people with rorqs currently wont prob fully change their setup, some might tho. It will take time, maybe 2 years or so before its somewhat sane again.
---
Everyone always knows better, right? I can relate. People so very often want their opinion to be important, but more than that they want to be right.
---
The fact that SP farmining can be famed for a profit is fucking broken.
---
It's always a good fight
---
https://youtu.be/TIk0aQTlnlc

Yea, only judging from the brain drain in the alliance and their continued adding of new corps just to stay at the same numbers, they weren't right.  At all.

Grath is entertaining in the same way that Alex Jones or the late Colonel Khaddafi are entertaining: you're laughing for about 10 minutes and then you've had enough

Not so subtle dig at Hedliner?
---
Steve
---
I mean Im not complaining, just wondering. It will be harder because you need to be online and first find the buyer and make folders and fiddle with access lists and invite/kick people.
---
But its still a good change overall.
---
Absolutely. Whether in Waffles or PL, Grath was someone who could send out a ping that X and Y need to be done, and it would get done -- immediately. That might be in part from intimidation, but also because people knew that orders from Grath would almost always produce content in one way or another. He is an excellent motivator when it comes to people being idle/playing other games.
---
We're are going to hit your hole so hard your going to get a prolapse lol

you can beat my ass any day cutie
---
That has the tang of words that are painfully true that you take no joy in saying.
---
Internet space pixel shit talk aside, sorry it's not fun for you anymore.
---
Actually it matter, like you don't roam in capitals every day, you don't use them as travel ships, you cannot take them in many places and they have different mechanics than subcapitals.           
---
They are also goal for many players.       
---
People need goals and flying **big** ship is one of the most common.                    
---
Like i stated at the beginning we know the issue why they became so common and why they are so cheap now.           
---
Until those issues are solved ... or addressed there is no way we have **any balance**
---
so get off ur high horse :)
---
We're definitely not friends anymore thats for sure.
---
but you have heard of him
---
Truly. The odds were stacked against them here. If OP bought twelve guys as backup it would have been an even fight.
---
You would never have to read another reply from me.
---
I'd never find you, you're always in a cloaky proteus.
---
Bwahahaha
---
Holy fuck you are deluded if you think the game caters to wormholers
---
Iterations that reduce/trade functionality are not good iterations, the new map for instance, adds nothig new and is harder to use than the old one (which i still use)

man, a web loki wouldve done you wonders

Yeah, sadly not too common. Its how eve should be played :)

or you undock a fully neut fitted shield chemosh and then feed to HK
---
There has never been a better time. EVE is in flux and we can‚Äôt wait to see what kind of mayhem you unleash in it.
---
It would please me a bit if, whatever it is you‚Äôre going to do to people, you‚Äôd not do it to people in the Throne Worlds region. I‚Äôm just throwing that out there.

Lol. Small wonder that you're an excon and irl loser

EVE just isn‚Äôt as fun as it once was, so I don‚Äôt blame him. Everything is so safe now. 
---
Plus, with the upcoming bookmark changes, my livelihood might be in jeopardy if it becomes a cancerous process to share bookmarks in mass. That‚Äôll be -3 accounts from me.
---
Absolutely. Come back and give it a go. There are way too many vocal people in places like this who whinge and whine about it all the time. They should either play, or leave and stop ruining it for those of us who like it.
---
Come back man, look up some corporations or ask some advice, particularly on the Eve forums. As others have said it IS better with a group of people and shared goals.
---
There‚Äôs plenty to do, see and learn and a wealth of excitement. 
---
Good luck

Who is garth? Sorry i must be not giving a shit enough to know who he is... but seriously, who is it?
---
But you didn't say "There were no gameplay updates" brainiac.   You stated " There hasn't been a dev update in quite sometime  ..."  Next time think before you make false bullshit statement on a public forum.  The low IQ section is in r/Dumbasses.
---
This seems petty and without merit.
---
Either a Catalyst or a Tornado.
---
You could talk to more Waffles.

Dont worry the test brigade will keep you high on the upvotes.

Join CODE, they are the best at that sort of stuff. Hardest part will be ship scanning and finding ones that are blinged enough that ganking them is worth it, and then predicting their movments. Actually killing them is just a matter of looking up how long it takes concord to respond in the system you're ganking in, how much ehp they have, and how many people you have to decide what gank ships are best
---
You definitely don‚Äôt know me, and I only know you you via your appearances on the many podcasts for this game. You should keep your shit man. I know it‚Äôs probably not what you want to hear, you‚Äôve been playing this game for a lot longer than I have, so you would know better than me what the record of ccp making good iterations is for this game. I just think that having the option to come back outweighs completely giving it up out of spite. I‚Äôd absolutely love to face off against you some time in the future. Maybe it‚Äôs because you kinda remind me of my dad if my dad was a little cooler and actually played video games, I dunno. 
---
Anyway, I wish you well man, I‚Äôm confident everyone from your friends to your sworn enemies will read this and think of new eden being noticeably dimmer without you in it.
---
Even if you can‚Äôt yoink the BPC (never had an opinion on this either way), there are other things about Sotiyos that make them cheesable, RNG cancer. I wish CCP would just seed faction capital BPC‚Äôs on the pirate LP stores and make their build requirements very, very high like with the Serpentis caps. 
---
An Angel Cartel Titan would be pretty nice, too.
---
gotta get that sweet imp navy small cap booster on there xD
---
Why wouldn't you try to kick down some sandcastles instead? You helped build one of the empires killing the game, then leave and blame the game? I don't really understand. You coulda helped burn some shit down instead, instead of choosing to hope and watch.
---
It‚Äôs probably the only way I‚Äôd reinstall the game. And I‚Äôd only do it to RMT enough money to send a shitload of glitterbombs and garbage to CCP
---
How's "I'm a poor" grab you as a reason?
---
Also I'll ~~double it~~ give it all back if you ever return.

So you add exactly nothing to the conversation and that other guy is the idiot?

Heh.  I think need is a strong word, get to without fear of any counter whatsoever is more accurate.

&gt; Making it your mission to shit on every person in as pithy a manner as possible that doesn't share your very specific opinion and world view isn't what I would call an achievement.

How do FCs get warpins? It depends. Will we see more spies compromising in-combat bookmarks in order to get warpins? No.
---
When I FC, I'll often have a scout or two on grid and I'll ask them to get me a good warpin. An FC who can't or prefers not to delegate may have alts on grid for this purpose. One common tactic when you want to land right at the right distance from the enemies but other landmarks don't matter is to combat probe the enemy fleet and punt your fleet at a certain range to one of the scanned ship sigs. The combat prober has to be in a squad/wing/fleet command position, and no bookmark is generated.
---
As a scout, I'll routinely compromise hostile pings during long-duration fights. No spies required. They just need to warp uncloaked to it at a time when I'm not busy doing other things.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

I get that, but I'm also curious as to what the upper limits of bookmarks is before it starts hurting performance both on client and server side.
---
but if I was running this lootscript or w/e CCP would easily be able to spot it, yet I am still not banned so how bout bringing some actual evidence or just stopping the cancerous slander Mr. Testicle in disguise.
---
Grath has had a larger influence on Eve than everyone else in this thread combined.
---
is there anybody else left in panfam ?
---
I'll take "players I never want to be on voice with for $500, Alex."
---
Yeah an easy answer...
---
Russians feel bad when they are not suffering.
---
What happened to the Eve players? This is why all the vets are leaving. Smack talking scrub nation. We've become littered with the Fortnite generation. No one wants the effort, they want zero risk, and all the rewards. Bring back the blackout. At least dedicated real players kept playing.
---
I think the next one will be announcing the departure of Hilmeth as CEO, who his replacement will be and the list of new pay to win items being added to the game by Christmas. The shutdown announcement will the one after that.
---
Play EvE? 2019? HA
---
Honestly, if you think Grath wasn't a damn sight more important than your average Eve nerd, you're either disingenuous or kind of thick. He's not exactly some vital component without which Eve'll collapse, but he's done a damn sight more for a lot of people in this game than.. say, you or me. 
---
There's no need to cast shade on it when someone who actually is a bit iconic in Eve throws in the towel and lets us know. They've earned it.
---
I enjoy playing sports with people who can act like mature adults, not toxic jerks who regularly call me and their teammates things like "pieces of human garbage"
---
Eve is better when those kinds of people stick to playing League
---
Test still uses nightmares, low sec and wormholes use them for bashing and defense. Small null groups use machs someone it looks like
---
I mean, you still haven't reimbursed me for all the SRP requests I've sent you over the years. I mean, I've never been in the same alliance as you, but still. You owe me.
---
personally I think we need to bring bigger ships. there is nothing wrong with rorquals. you just should not expect to beat one with a fleet that cost the same or less then one of its drones
---
I will post this to CCP forums daily.

Yeah man, predicting that groups in a 16 year old game will fall apart. That's just genius level predictions, someone get Grath a job at the White House, it's where geniuses belong.
---
I remember when Rote was a strong independent Syndicate alliance who didn't need no blues.
---
Boooooooh
---
Wow, the last time I flew in an arty abaddon fleet was back when White Noise, Dead Terrorists and Sys-k tried to invade part of catch.
---
When was that, 2010? Somewhere around there.
---
It went well until -A- sent a super fleet into our home and left their main line to defend.
---
Sys-k started to lose their home and we had to retreat to defend it, and then our allies started to lose battles on the main front and then we quickly lost the war, ahaha.
---
Good times.
---
Honestly, that line of thought contradicts with business philosophy "The Customer is always Right." This philosophy is based on an appeasement-based marketing scheme designed to ensure that a given product or service reaches a maximum level of satisfaction relative to the competitor. Most businesses are based somewhat on this model as it has been the most successful historically speaking. Naturally, there are extremes to this philosophy and I'm not going to humor tongue-in-cheek satire based on those extremes, but within reason and within the domain of the product/service, a business should actively seek 100% customer satisfaction, even if that goal isn't realistically obtainable. At the very least, a business should not demand that a customer simply be satisfied with what they got for what they paid and be told to piss off otherwise. While CCP isn't saying that, many of the players are apparently assuming that CCP should.
---
Loads,  the current Sov system, The lack of ccp ballanceing ships, Rorquals, the 2 biggest coilitions in the game NIPed, Moon changes, The death of content in lowsec, skill exstractors/injectores, SP farming,  the CSM every year, the loss of eve bet and the AT, to name a few.
---
"Customer is always right." Is a myth, if customers  were always right, then every company in the world would of gone bankrupt a long time ago. Those that practice the "Customer is always right." often have a high turn over rate, and any profit gain are often cut into by the constant staff training, and yes staff training has a massive cost. Here, let me post the often used training plan of most big box stores.  
---
Be respectful. Just like with customers, always treat employees with respect, even when they‚Äôre wrong.
---
Train for conflict: Teach employees how to deal with upset customers. This includes learning not to get defensive, showing empathy, and using positive language to dampen customers‚Äô negative emotions.
---
Back away: Allow employees to disengage with customers when they are being disorderly.
---
Learn from mistakes: Review situations when customers are wrong to identify (and improve) areas where your organization may be purposely or inadvertently misleading customers.
---
Say goodbye sometimes: Don‚Äôt worry about losing customers who can‚Äôt‚Äîor won‚Äôt‚Äîbe happy with how you run your organization.
---
The bottom line: Customers aren‚Äôt always right.
---

To be honest, I don't know. Sure, there are issues, but that isn't a dealbreaker. I think the old players are just getting tired of playing, but they wanna stay so they complain.

I bailed when CCP sold out, Grath.  My Eve "birth date" was 7/4/2003.  You held on until far closer to the bitter end than I did.  Some of the fleets and camps with you and the boys in the war with Goons 2010 Edition are some of my best memories of Eve.  Give 'em hell in whatever you choose to do next.

Note to self.  Fire sale everything because caps devalues everything eventually
---
So Grath is quitting Eve *again*?
---
Dude ironbank, chill man... I get you're pissed after all these years for being busted for RMT, but you got to let it go bro.  This kind of petty hate-mongering is killing the game way faster than CCP ever could.
---
Besides, I think this is like the 2nd or 3rd time Grath has gone on hiatus since leaving SNIGG.  He'll be back eventually, and if not, then it'll be ok.
---
Because I dont want to hang out with the amount of people the game now requires to achieve that
---
I just spat my tea.
---
People have been preaching that eve is dying for nearly 15 years.
---
Maybe, but why do people like me more than you?
---
Avoid player corps for now, only one I'd personally recommend is eve uni- but only once you've wrapped your head around the basics. I thinks it's best to do the tutorials before anything though.
---
You remember those good days? The ones where you hung out with friends on the game, did stupid stuff together, and just enjoyed everything?

Well, some of us still have those days, and we‚Äôd love more stuff to lose. You‚Äôre welcome to support our endeavors.

Grath Telkin. Former leader of Pandemic Legion, the last null superpower before the current era of Goonswarm (this is like five years ago by now). Currently (or now immediately former) leader of WAFFLES., which at some point jumped from being a null empire entity to a guerilla warfare group. Kept his name and ego after leaving PL leadership. Feels pretty grr goons but more eloquently than most of the goons so gets a bit of reddit karma for his stinging.

Man, and people were using RK as an example of a group that was doing just fine without needing to join any big bloc...

If your going to bling anything start with tank the gyros are a waste of 300m.

Grab some pith resist mods instead passive is better. Also heavy missiles are better if you can fit them. Also use a Depot to store your cloak of it's even on your ship it reduces your lock times. looks good tho.

Oh and if your going to use the imobility drivers at least put one web on lol

I make 4 injectors every 32 days so the table has 4 per alt. In case you wanna know this is the final formula.

---
My reason is: Don't. You never know if you'll decide you wish you still had it, if nothing else to have something sentimental to remember what you *did* like about Eve.
---
can i have your stuff ? you know i like whelping ;)

My liege, my wish is your command you must only speak it. Your keyboard is crusty, mi lord? I will lick it clean sire.

I've wondered before  if any HK/Chinese people have ever got in serious trouble for making some post in the EVE forums like "CCP are a bunch of idiots!" or something. Considering how the Chinese gov't monitors everything I wouldn't be too surprised if that happened.

---
better just drop it and use the cap bonus one.
---
Absolutely! Jump in and explore all the new stuff to do. A lot of it is really good. Don't listen to this subreddit at large, its like 25 bitter old pricks yelling at each other about things that very, very few care about. Join a smaller corp, make a place for yourself, and have fun. I'd avoid all the big newbro focused nullsec corps, they are a meat grinder in my opinion. Find something where you matter, and aren't drone #1343. But a lot of folks enjoy them, so to each their own i guessm
---
Since hed chased everyone else away there hasn't been a fleet he's lead where he didn't take open shots at everyone else who worked hard to make the alliance great in the past.

You are already bypassing the great chinese firewall to post on the eve forums/reddit, so yea. Doesn't really matter at that point.

The greatest cancer has been the pairing of two of the largest coalitions together with one another. CFC/HBC in 2011 until 2013, CFC/Legacy now. You can whinge and complain about PL and Grath all you want, but you are deluded if PL is the main culprit behind the professional bureaucratic apparatus that exists at the core of the CFC/Legacy, which has done more to push eve into a state of stagnation than anything else
---
I fully support Icelandic Socialism
---
looseing them lols :)
---
!remindme 2 years
---
  Is eve still a thing
---
You'd change your tune pretty fucking quick if the tables were reversed
---
and it will up the "daily logon" statistics for daddy
---
Tucker Carlson would beg to differ.
---
Thats beautiful man Get to the Choppa
---
Empires have been a thing in eve since 05... The book titled "empires of eve" speaks of this at great length...
---
The SkillU way?
---
I will listen to emo talk about her poop until you decide it has been enough torture and let it end. Also it's main use will be taunting the people it DIDN'T go to while I also have eve uninstalled and play other games. You should look into escape from tarkov.
---
Get a ship with cloak.
---
An astero May be expensive for a newbro but definitely worth the money if get a covert ops cloak and know how to use safe spots. 
---
You can usually pay it off threefold in one day trip down  a quiet chain doing only ruined relic sites.
---
Rule of thumb - if there‚Äôs other players in your hole, get out.
---
I mean thats been nice to people... also you do know that quote comes from him talking to people internally who had chosen to be there.... Kind of a big differance.
---
Lmao
---
Bitch, I know Eve history.  PL is equally responsible for the blue donut.  You can't white wash me boy.
---
Most Eve Goons can't even spell SA. Those that can, like to gloss over all the toxic shit that Goons have done.
---
Hey, you've got the right to be as wrong as you want.
---
A good crack fix is escape from tarkov.  It is all the best parks of like, dayz and such, but without the complete shit parts.
---
Mod shadowandlight even if he doesn't play the game or use reddit on that account anymore
---
Well that‚Äôs fucken gay
---
He retired because he was fueled by failure and hatred of stupid f1 monkeys in his fleets. In PL he didnt get that.
---
Its fake. I have it in good sources.
---
No one has anything to be impressed with in a 16 year old videogame
---
The change is how it never changes, by always changing. Which is how it never changes.
---
The perfect meme doesn‚Äôt exi-
---
I hope the irony isn't lost on him
---
that's why you dont run one I assume
---
Well, yeah. All three of the morons that I listed above happened to be, like Garth, quite delusional. And you're right, I would strenuously be making the same argument that my popularity comes from my genius and other grade A qualities if I was in their shoes
---
Like I said though, popularity doesn't prove jack
---
It is, it brought a lot of old friends back and we had a great time. Then they shit the bed and pulled it because lol low numbers. They got the farmers back. They're losing a lot more now, numbers arent improving, they're sliding off a cliff.
---
If you give your stuff to me, you would have even less reasons to reinstall Eve ever again after that last time.
---
Life of Brian was a great movie
---
In resume, they need cheap capitals for drops because #poors.
---
Reaper with a gat cannon an mining laser. Good luck pilot.
---
Deal with it.
---
I don't think you think, period
---
Name one leader of something important in eve who is not been playing atleast 10 years.
---
Where did I say it wouldn't be?
---
according to my sources, serenity had people doxing each other with chat logs showing them being critical of the Chinese gov... id say one of if not the biggest terror living in a communist country is your neighbors having direct incentive to sell you up the river the first chance they get... how can anyone ever relax?
---
New player hoping to show off
---
I don't speak Triglavian :(  
---
Please translate....
---
Who is this guy and why should anyone care that he uninstalled eve in particular? Why does his salt matter more?
---
5 and they would trump NC üòÅ
---
6k dps is the damage cap for medium structures. It's 600dps for the structure to stop repairing, you can easily do it with a single ship. There are no small structures, only mediums, large and XL.
---
&gt;Did NPCs sell stuff and just got slowly replaced?
---
Yep, sometimes years into the game.  Even minerals were effectively supplied and price locked/capped by players reprocessing NPC sell orders when the prices were right.  Shuttles used to lock Tritanium at 3.41 ISK, and Pax Amarria (yes, crunched up spacebibles) locked Isogen and Nocxium, IIRC.
---
bad idea
---
40 minute*
---
I stand by everything else
---
You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
---
reinstall sisi and make gif of you trashing all your assets
---
How about  you come up and see how much ‚ÄúNC is failing‚Äù
---
 Nullsec: Where EVE goes to die
---
They a prison gang multiboxing isk for the warden?
---
Very viable, although you want to give him the +5 implants, it really makes a difference in the cost of the alt.
---
You can also suspect bait them.
---
And the dounat grows again
---
What defines important?
---
Really? what's weird to me is how lacking in self awareness you are
---
I'm entitled to post my personal opinions on your dumb comments just as much as you're entitled to post the comments themselves, Garth
---
So the answer to his question was: yes.
---
I'd imagine just walking while also breathing is a challenge for your typical TAPI member tbh
---
People always return because of their investment in the game, remove the investment and you remove a significant portion of the temptation to come back.
---
Not really a reason why you should give specifically me your shit, but hey, it's my reason, I claim it.
---
NPCs used to sell some equipment like Tech 1 Modules, they also had buy-orders for minerals. 
---
If you click on an NPC corporation in eve, then go to the Market Activity tab, you can see the old sell/buy prices they used to have, even though those orders were removed 
---

---
For Example, Hyasyoba used to sell Warp Scrambler Is for 70k ISK (And other hybrid ammo, tackle modules and shield booster modules) and had buy orders for minerals.
---
You might of been told A history.... but what gets told and what really happens inside PL are totaly differant things.
---
It's not. I can write up a long-winded post on what lead to this but let's say the future of Tribute after the glassening was pre-determined.
---
test gave it to them
