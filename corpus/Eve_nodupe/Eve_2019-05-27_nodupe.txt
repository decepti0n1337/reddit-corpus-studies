If youre on your own, it can be difficult.

---
The trick is to find a group where you can have people you can rely on to do things for you (and do things for them when they need it). 
---
Also joining a group that has a good market doesnt hurt. 
---
But yes, there are ways of making money to plex more than 1 account. 
---
Joining a group that has R64 moons, and mining those, is one.
---
Joining a group with a very good market, and then supplying that market/profiteering is another. 
---
Building capital ships in places where they are sought after is yet another.
---
I heard the numbers were multiplied by 5 or something. Which I thought there was originally 300\~ on field. If those numbers were real (for a non-hyped keepstar). People would be saying the is falling even harder. If you have access to fireside the Mittani mentioned the numbers of titans deployed during that fireside.

No assets anywhere

Oh wow a climate change denier too. Do you wear MAGA hats?

---
The wardec issue would be the main reason not to. As well as it will cut into your profits keeping it fueled, running, and defended.
---
The coolness of calling something your own and customizing rigs to exactly what y’all produce would be the main reasons to do it.
---
PM me your in game character name, I'll throw ISK at you
---
If only there was a Thermodynamics VI, nice video!
---
I've flown in a bunch in an alt and tell them "my main is in TEST" they never cared

Was the plan to roll the windows down and throw his ammo at the enemy?
---
There are different types of cosmic signatures. You’ll want to find the ones that resolve into a square shape (data) or a semicircle (relic). The gate you found probably goes into a combat site, which is more of a diamond shape symbol. 
---
The other kind of sig is a wormhole, where you’ll find more valuable loot but is considerably more dangerous. 
---
Check out the Eve University wiki for more detailed help on exploration.
---
Yea I'm definitely going to do a lot more research into this and try and figure out if it's worth it or not.
---
Those are mighty kind words. Thanks :D
---
Code takes what they want. It's okay to think you deserve something, but if you can't manage to get it then get better or try something new.
---
If you believe you are owed something and then take it within the parameters of the game then there you go. You did the work to earn it, making it true!
---
How's your mom doing? I heard she was in the group getting some heat for giving their children bleach enemas to combat the autism virus
---
Not trying to be harsh, but given the fact you couldn't find the 20ish min to pply during the reg period, I'd suggest the RealLife needs more of your attention at the moment. The additional time suck of CSM could be detrimental. 
---
Hope all is well! Maybe next year will find yourself more available.
---
This is a great idea that will never get implemented because CCP has limited resources and there are way more urgent stuff to fix or change before a trivial thing like that gets implemented.
---
Aww. Another person with self esteem issues. Therapy is good mate, get some
---
When did I deny climate change? Tornadoes in tornado ally is not an indicator of climate change. It's normal.

You're all actually retarded

I’m very thankful of your offer. I’ll send you a dm.

Jahaha
---
I did. That video helped me a lot.
---
Thanks I did just what you typed. It helped me a lot.
---
Would Goon Attack The Initative if the made a deal with PAMFAM?
---
OFC they would.
---
goddamn that hellscape of self loathing known as factorio. The only game where I truly feel completely and totally stupid every 10 minutes.
---
This is why i love the proviblock
---
Now get your racial frig skill to 5 and train into covops frigs and put all those mods on one of the  hulls bonused for scanning and you can get the lvl 5's without to much issue.
---
Easier to defend. A lot less eyes will bump into you. &amp; you don’t commit to one specific area of the game. 
---
You get a chance for hole control. You get a chance to move across space with your structures. You’ll never face supers and in most lowclass it’ll be battleships. 
---
Smaller fleet sizes for the most part.
---
How do I sell blueprints? Exploration loot
---
I've tried undercutting current contracts in Jita.
---
I've tried subtracting material costs from item costs and subtracting another 10% or so.
---
Both methods have quite low success. Any suggestions?
---
Eveskunk's extensive spy network clearly work behind the scenes towards Explicit's downfall.
---
Jeronica is a good man.
---
I honestly can't think of any by name. I consider a war a full deployment with the intent to evict someone. Hasn't been one since...
---
I'M not doing anything
---
No World of Warships? (WoWs) I feel like a lot of eve gamers went here at some point. It still has me hooked at 2.5 years
---
All planned at Wheelers bachelorette party.
---
No but this is:

---
So nothing of value was lost then?
---
that hit me harder than i expected...
---
I run some for 2-3 person corp, it's great. Find a quite system and no one will bother you. Wormholes are awful for industry.
---
Rorqual mining was extremely lucrative and proliferation of super capital ratting. The blue donut allowed the expansion of safe isk making areas.
---
die
---
I have low power Raitarus anchored in various places under alt corps. They have their advantages. They could take their time deciding how best to use the structure and wouldn't have much on the line to start with.
---
once every 40 game hours or so. i have videos of a few weeks ago finding 3 in one night.
---
&gt; Halo implants are nice to try and sig-tank but outside of small ganging, there aren't of any use.
---
they also have no use in small ganging, pretty much every advantage halos would give you in mitigating damage snakes do a **far** better job, and are also way more versatile.
---
you might be right, my memory might be blurry. I recall it having 8
---
you're making 5b per hour doing wh escalations? damn
---
Ezpz. Just bring more ramjags.
---
I fly that cancer setup because I try my hardest to stir up content for my Corp, and nobody wants to turn down a potential Kiki kill.  That, and it's a super fun comp to fly because it lets me stay on grid "solo" against quite a few things.
---
Just picture how much more cancer I'll be when my Kiki gets replaced by a draugr
---
Was a fun fight after a whole day of uncontested structure bashes.  Thanks for showing up NC!
---
ez gg
---
I’m at 1.2 but I’m on the way to 4bil. Might have overestimated by $10
---
shocked_pikachu
---
If anything I would have to thank you for being one of the few individuals i came across in the 7 years i have played this game that left a completely positive impression.
---
4bil? solo? are you 2 cycling the sites?
---
After they murdered the imperium, somehow the jump gate and cyno jammer got knocked into hull and shut down.
---
I had a fantastic experience today because I didn't have perfect intel.
---
Scanned down a wormhole in a lowsec system that lead to null. I was in a Magnate with SOE launcher and probes, too impatient to train the skills.
---
Jump through hole.
---
Bubble and two cruisers with drones all over the place.
---
Fuck...
---
I made it back with 50% hull.
---
They tried chasing after me but I managed to warp off before they even started locking onto me.
---
My hands were shaking for the next 10 minutes.
---
I know this doesn't really relate that strongly to what's being discussed but I hope it helps explain why non-perfect intel is so damn fun. One moment a wormhole is safe to jump through but two hours later it's camped and you escape by the skin of your teeth.
---
Hell, I wasn't scanning for wormholes even, I was scanning for relic and datasites, found the wormhole and just thought to myself "oh what the hell, I found it, let me give it a look."
---
At least, for me, if I knew the wormhole existed I wouldn't even have bothered in that system anyway.
---
tl:dr Found a wormhole. Oh what the hell Ill explore it. Almost die.
---
Haha thanks for the offer but that is ok, that makes it too easy, I need to feel the loss of the Rattlesnake to push myself to be smarter xD
---
  AAR (Not FC) Imperium POV:
---
  &gt; Imperium fleet ref first cyno jammer
---
  &gt; Warp and start ref the 2nd
---
  &gt; Fort manned and start dropping bombs
---
  &gt; At 30ish % shield, a rogue NC. cyno lit and local spiked
---
  &gt; FC, local? Wat do?
---
  &gt; First NC. Munnin fleet engages, 2nd on the way
---
  &gt; Shooting between nerds, losing battleships to bombing runs and that gods damned fortizar while we kill logi, support and the odd Munnin
---
  &gt; 2nd North fleet arrives
---
  &gt; OhShit.png
---
  &gt; Ping for reinforcements
---
  &gt; Battle on until reinforcements and fax arrives on grid, bombed multiple times by bombers proper and that fortizar
---
  &gt; Primary Alphastar
---
  &gt; Primary 2nd nerd I forgot name
---
  &gt; See Hedliner, proceed to nos poor guy until he flew 100km away
---
  &gt; Got killed here
---
  &gt; Fight continues until both sides extract
---
Good job NC. and other northern bros for the fight!
---
Please come again!
---
Lol yeah let's "streamline" the game for the lowest common denominator IQs like yourself. That worked out well for WoW.
---
Salty? Tell us, where did you feed them your super?
---
I mean, you've become the laughingstock of the community. Maybe drop supers on provi again, surely that'll get your feared reputation back.
---
I understand the science behind climate change....
---
He's getting a negative response because he's got an entitled attitude and expects other people to provide the content for him, and at the same time he's shitting on the state of the game while admitting he's new and thus has a very limited perspective in the first place.
---
I could sell you mine I never have open the cd or played it
---
hi friend my guess is you’re not scanning correctly and it doesn’t have as much to do with scanning skills. watch a youtube guide or pm me for help scanning.
---
Hilariously fed all the logi to harpies while leaving but otherwise fun af.
---
gf gf.
---
I like how they leave out that we achieved the objective.
---
Regardless, that was one hell of a fun fight, with little tidi. I hope to see more fights with these guys.
---
praise bob

---
They murdered the baltec fleet and then ran when reinforcements arrived, so we held the field afterwards.
---
Yeah, lets bring the old wardecs back!
---
So awesome, Please do more of these!!!!
---
Do you find it's hard to operate the structure with such a small corp?
---
This whole time I was praising Rob. I need to praise Bob!!!
---
libtard destroyed with fax and logi
---
NB4 some real life comparison of society.
---
sounds like someone got outplayed
---
sounds like they could handle 3-1 but not 5-1. but you RF'd a structure, good for you :D
---
Exploration blueprints are largely pretty useless which is why they are such a hard sell.
---
pssht. Everyone knows adderall is the winners choice when it comes to eve.
---
gj shooting structures.
---
I have questions but then I realized it's NullSechnaya we are talking about here and I decided I don't want them answered.
---
if you say so
---
Provi's been farming them for about two months now.
---
That's a far cry from fallen apart. But sure, things change. One thing is certain, this summer is going to be interesting.
---
Also, drugs are your friends.
---
yeah they'll try and pretend it never happened but we made the fuck out of that timer
---
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PURELY ISK LOSS IMP CAME OUT ON TOP BECAUSE ALPHA'S MONITOR DIED OK?
---
A lot of groups go on a vouch system. Just chill in low-sec, fight people. You'll make friends, and a reputation. Once you have a rep, you're in.
---
When you can afford it, get yourself a set of 8 Sisters probs. They help and don't cost too much. I wouldn't mess with the Sisters Probe Launcher though. Not just yet. Too much ISK to lose as a noob. Good Luck!
---
Yeah munnins against baltecs is a pretty hard fight to begin with and we're taking some time this war to let new fcs take out big boy fleets. A more senior fc would probably have done better but things got a bit out of hand until we got reinforcements in.
---
Was very fun indeed gf. Our Bhaaltec FC stayed cool while eating shit against the 2 Muninn fleets in the first half of the fight before reinforcements could arrive. Was his first major engagement as a newish FC, top lad.
---
damn, you'd think people would figure out momentum is key in wars and 2-3 good losses at the start can cripple an offensive
---
Only memes gained.
---
Sounds like a typical Eve fleet encounter to me.
---
technically wardecs matter in lowsex because you can agress without taking gate guns, but nobody bothers doing it just for that
---
fighting into your counter means you're dumb, don't care, or got outplayed
---
Come join the beans a great group of guy best few months I have ever had in my 5 years of EvE https://youtu.be/hI8CRaCCsEc
---
But it isn't.  
---
Asakai is an example of being able to teleport across the universe at a moments notice allowing fights.  Today, Asakai doesn't happen. Because people can't get to the fight to make it into a thing without living next door to each other... which creates the perfect intel situation complained about.  
---
I know we all have some nostalgia glasses... and OP is correct about perfect intel being a negative. But what it doesn't do is stop major fights.
---
Was a pretty fun fight, good stuff NC
---
I think I will actually, they looked really well organised !
---
'NC.' nc and alot of other dudes.
---
2-3 losses isnt going to stop this you would need 4-5 big titan losses maybe
---
That was a fun fight! 
---
I was tackled by a damnation and than neuted out. I got left behind as we were MWD away from the goons and I ended up right in the middle of the goon fleet, smack dab in the middle of a large bubble. No cap and on my own I slow boated out of the bubble and warped to the fort. 
---
The goons never shot me, lol. I was so close that the ice cream truck that travels with them went by me, I got out of my pod and had some delicious  soft serve ice cream and had a nice chat with some of the other goons eating ice cream.
---
Goons are all right by my book!
---
was fun, lost my guardian, got into another one, kept fighting
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
proper
---
Love that idea, thanks.
---
Don't be ridiculous.
---
I love this battle report!!!
---
Yeah but that's tapi lol
---
I've been doing wormhole exploration with my Astero for some time now, and with nearing level 5 mastery with it, i grew confident and blinged it to a dual rep pvp fit (463 mil isk). I decided that seeking action in wormholes is too much of a hassle so decided to go to lowsec and find some fights there.
---
Once I arrived, I saw 3 guys in local and started scanning for sites. Being the idiot I am, I jumped to a relic site and started hacking. One second I was looking at the hack window and the next second I was in my pod with a bunch of hostile npcs on my overview, trying to comprehend what happened.
---
After warping my capsule to safety, I opened detailed combat log and saw damage from depot only, which exploded my ship. After a little research I learned it was a ghost site and it exploded on me, and this is not w space and I shouldn't jump to sites just because they don't have "forgotten" or "unsecured" in front of their names. 
---
What's weird is, the ship loss doesn't show at my combat log. And yeah I checked "losses" instead of "kills", which shows my most recent loss from a week ago. It's been a day now, why wouldn't it show there (or zkillboard for that matter)?
---
CCP needs to make Triglavian industrials just for this man
---
It's internet spaceships not life or death.
---
besides playing eve no idea if this chart reflects me.
---
it was 2 muninn fleets on their fortizar grid vs one baltec fleet, yes they did well to begin with but were unable to hold the field on their home turf with all the advantages.
---
Going to bet you were trying to scan a "ghost site" and not finding it saved your ship.  
---
Sisters Probes are really cheap for a heafty bonus, the Sisters Launcher costs quire a bit more than the bonus is worth.  Getting a pinpoint array in the mids can help if you have a hull that can fit it, but idk if a t1 ship really can?  
---
Definitely check YouTube for probe videos and Praise Bob you don't need to probe like we did pre-odyssey, that was a bitch and a half.  
---
And read up on Ghost Sites, once you can scan them you really need to know what you are doing or you'll get wrecked.
---
Also, check out the Blackglass Implant and the blingy Zymurga Analyzer, you will need to go on a scavanger hunt for the implant, which is fun, and the two together are really potent for hacking.
---
A nebula of excited gases.
---
Thanks for turning this into a doxxed thread. I kept RL names out of it for a fucking reason. I was hoping to show Ethanpow this thread if he wakes up to help him know people aren't all assholes and that people do care. Now I fucking can't.
---
After invasion expansion: 
---
Triglavian fleet: Triglavian open up!
---
how do you find fights like this as a solo bs?
---
I just see nothing or caps
---
[Got primaried, still got to record the fight #rude](http://g.recordit.co/EXAwbaYwL2.gif)
---
"With all the advantages" please elaborate?  Are you saying we should have escalated with dreads/carriers?
---
As someone who was flying Logi in the Goon fleet, and was overwhelmed by armor broadcasts (I had no idea Wtf was going on besides REP ALL THE THINGS) this AAR is just what I was looking to find, lol.
---
Great fight, NC! Thanks for not blapping me off the field straight away, I actually got to play space priest for a bit.
---
Triglavian covops WHEN
---
You are probably using a single probe. Friends are the first things you scan for in eve, else you'll be lost.
---
I hope you'll take /u/ashterothi up on his offer.  Both of us are a part of a highsec corp called MALRO that offers new players lots of help and benefits.
---
I don't care. Take it up with the admins. These are their rules.
---
He wasn't doing any of this, he was trying to scan at 4.0 AU range without ever moving probes, lmao.
---
Maybe the case. But they won their objective qnd...  let's be real they could probably lose a good hundred of those fleets before the felt a dent. Itd be an annoyance to build no. Cap ships for them and little else at this point. 
---
Doesnt change that they while holding a vast numerical supremacy got takennadown a notch in that fight. Additionally its reported that, the fc in the engagement is fairly new and this was their first major battle. 
---
Either way both sides got some content.
---
Sounds like a good time was had by one and all.  
---
Goons got the objective and a good fight, NC got to blow of a lot of ships till Goon reinforcements arrived.  
---
Every one leaves happy feeling like they got done what needed to be done.  A good start to a pleasant deployment.
---
Can I get a screenshot of this formation, and maybe a how to on how to change my formations?
---
Yeah I have an alpha that’s training into the warp to me shield Hyperion, it’s about two months of training for an alpha without implants, a bit less with +3s and a remap
---
this is a very long winded “didn’t want that anyway”
---
and you don’t win a war of attrition on the other side of the map from home by losing fights with 20% isk efficiency
---

From 2008.
---
I did move the probe .
---
Thanks for the input.
---
Damn that's one hell of a screen resolution
---
"advantages"? What's a Dino doing in goons?
---
Hey thanks! It looks like Estamel is problematic since I won't have a carrier before at least 6 more month of skill points. 
---
Should I try another type of pirate then? Maybe some of them have more dps and less tank.
---
I am thinking about trying to kite them with a polarized stealth bomber.
---
Hey thanks! Unfortunately I will not be able to fly carriers before another 6 month of skill points minimum so Estamel will be a problem.
---
Should I try to hunt other pirates than Gurista then? Some with more dps and less tank but kiteable?
---
*m7
---
Get into help/Corp chat and start asking questions.  No one figures out Eve in a day. No one figures out Eve alone.
---
yeah, it did seem a bit weird to be true.  But stranger things have been true after all.
---
Except goons could lose every fight with 20% isk efficiency and still dunk the north because they have infrastructure and a strong economy. They still got the timers they formed for.
---
The salt just never ends from you people
---
Sounds like a fun fight. Hopefully another one happens next weekend when I'm off work!
---
&gt;don't care
---
I think in your native language this could be funny, in English it’s not.
---
Yeah, i’d sure hate for shingly to get dinged for copyright strikes over perturbator.
---
It's not that it wasn't wanted I'm sure. It's just what was losses was worth it for their objective. And ultimatley losses on this scale would never financially concern them.
---
Gj being irrelevant
---
it's pretty naive to think wars are won by economics
---
Draugr is gonna have around max 30 km range with Mystic and considering you’re already using a bifrost in nullifies the main advantage that you would get
---
I think you underestimate
---
1. The wealth of the north. NC and probably some corps in other alliances have been renting for ages, doing moon mining (when it was afk), and have tonnes of old money. Goons have gotten extremely wealthy in a few years, but I’m willing to be a lot on the depth of Northern coffees
---
2. The mental grind that has. Imagine almost every fleet you go on ends in a welp. That would suck big pp. Even if we got some objectives.
---
  Sounds like a fun fight :)
---
Scanning is super easy and has been dumbed down over the years. Having said that you have to SEE it happening, THEN you get it and then it's easy. 
---
Check this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhBHxzSA9ZU&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhBHxzSA9ZU&amp;t)
---
Was more like 220 Imperium vs 2 Muninn Fleets + Fortizar + Bomber Wing until reinforcements arrived.
---
Right, but wars aren’t decided by one battle. I’m just memeing a bit by implying that this one battle forecasts the rest of the battles in the war. I would be a bit alarmed as a goon if you are getting 20% isk efficiency for what amounts to not even a major major major objective.
---
House debt is kinda different because the interest rates are so low. Ideally you want to make the minimum payment every month and then save the rest because your going to outpace the interest gains of your house loan.
---
lmao aint thats why MANGO is moving to Omist now and TEST blue them to get that tax money?? fucking hypocrites
---
Prices are SKYROCKETING [https://i.imgur.com/13XaWw7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/13XaWw7.jpg)
---
No not all wars are decided in one battle. Why would you be alarmed if you lost by 20 percent in terms of isk when isk means nothing as srp covers them? Also as you said this was just one fight over a simple objective. These war machines take time to move and gear up. Teat has been at war with frat a month or two now and only now actually fighting with force. Just finally started anchoring and roaming with multiple mass fleets. So...
---
it is your space isnt it?  you live here
---
I'm a mentor in Dreddit, there was a recent change in leadership of that department and in the confusion you might have slipped through. If you're still interested, please let me know and I'll do my best to make sure you're having a good time.
---
There's plenty of way to enjoy the game with low SP. Give it a serious try.
---
Collateral Damage
---
How would you define relevance in EVE 2019?
---
As I said in another comment, no, wars are not decided by a single battle.
---
But considering the strongest showing of a group is *usually* at the start of a campaign, this doesn’t bode too well.
---
Especially considering the absolute steamroll goons claimed this would be.
---
I dont think its realistic to do then with your current limitations. Maybe RR Rattlesnakes? I you need a surprising amount of tank and DPS to deal with them. I don't think kiting will work because they use a variety of e-war (Nos, web, scram, etc.). 
---
That being said my entire experience officer hunting, has been the belt spawned Unit-(XYZ) in Drone lands. So even my knowledge has very limited application to what you want to try. I have no idea the differences between  the officers i spawned and fought, to the ones you plan to go after. Just expect to either need a hand when it comes time to kill it, or go big.
---
I like recruiting WH pilots this way. You get to see if they have a good attitude about loss and they're clearly already interested in WHs but could use a little guidance.
---
gj beating stainguy as the biggest moron on the eve subreddit
---
Half the shit he does, off stream, is find and set up the condutions for these fights. Picks targets, times, and ofc the location. Its a lot of work and behind the scenes prep for awesome encounter videos - and sometimes he gets smacked with caps anyways. See his "100$ fight" video, its an hour long but its got english subtitles and you can kinda see the amount of setup he does.
---
That's what I keep telling my parole officer
---
With that logic I'd be the smartest man alive, sadly that is not the case
---
Well.. I can agree that maybe they forgot to increase the amount of Isogen needed.. I seem to have way too much of that left over after every build of anything in game.
---
What happened to elo on the ticket?
---
Aren't you basically perma deployed to Providence now anyway?
---
I've been doing this for years, been in this game for at least a decade and still my most favourite role is fast-tackle/scout.
---
You can do this role almost your first week in, and you can literally do this for anyone or just yourself.
---
The OP is just clueless, which I fully understand, I've been there multiple times, it appears to me OP just hasn't found the people he wants to stick around with yet.
---
P.s. :Karmafleet is recruiting.
---
&gt;Compayn (Mcav)
---
Oof
---
Just leaving me out completely
---
Good video, but also depressing to see the ongoing krabification of eve.
---
And the death of many playstyles of eve because of it... .
---
I hope you get on the csm and can make a difference!
---
Yup - he did great!
---
negative ghost rider
---
Logi did great despite all of that.  Was good flying it with you logibro!
---
I'm a small corp and had no issues with structures in highsec. Look me up in game if you need assistance or have questions.
---
They were afraid that Elo would unhinge his jaw and swallow CCP Fozzie like a snake
---
Same here.  Although the new Guardian just doesn't feel the same as the old one that carried me through the last war (including the battle of X47)
---
/ Δ \\\\\_/\\
---
Ugg, did the CSM even protest this?
---
What a stupid change, removing even more wonder from eve.
---
This is not eve anymore, just a carcas of the eve that used to be.
---
Naah - we just podded back, reshipped, and rejoined the fight.  
---
Although a few actual defeats (like where objectives weren't met) *might* have an impact on morale...
---
Good for him stepping up when none of the other FCs would get out of their recliners.
---
Not quite.  The spanked the baltec fleet with 2 munin fleets before back-up fleets arrived.
---
They moved 1,300 titans in gear for this: and some wars are decided by one or two battles.
---
Also as I mentioned. Test the second largest entity has been at war near 2 months and just starting to really show their hands of force. In eve it can take entities a long period of time to get moving. Also in terms of steamroll: they could blitz them quickly I am sure: but content is content. Just rolling over an entity would be no fun. And this is a game overall.
---
It's pretty naive to think they aren't.  
---
I mean let's be real - there's a lot of ways one could measure success.  This was my 6th fleet of the day, all of which up to that point were bashing structures.  Multimle ref timers, jump gates destroyed, cyno inhibs blasted.  All completely uncontested.  
---
So that vs. one bhalltec fleet getting spanked - and the bash objectives still met anyway (by the same spanked bleet and the members who reshipped and rejoined).  So what was lost, some ships that are "already replaced?"
---
Not taking it from NC - they formed, the fought, and well done to them.  But in the end, objective was still met.
---
&gt;ruined Kikimora
---
Lmao yea kiki's are ruined. I'll buy all of them you have for 30 mil each. Totally gonna be useless.
---
FYI, your narrative stinks. I had "Casino Money" before "Casino Money" was a thing as well as quite a few others in our ranks. I wouldn't underestimate the wealth a player can accumulate after making hundreds of billions of ISK per month for many years.
---
Exactly.  The battle report shows total forces in the entire time frame - not a timeline.
---
Or u can also kill other ppl in their internet spaceships and make isk that way
---
But it's so comfy redline
---
This wasn't the first time there was a brawl.  https://br.inyour.space/?s=857,858&amp;b=8621640&amp;e=90&amp;t=ub
---
Why not just undock and actually do something?
---
You dont have to be a history or economics major to realize how dumb this comment is as that is literally why wars are started and fought.
---
Wait your not a QFC ?
---
Pamfam was outnumber already before the 130+ eagles &amp; 2 FAX cyno in.
---
Amen.
---
For WHs nothing really. CCP has neglected them pretty hard. There are a lot of changes to null you should read up on cause I dont have 7 hours to type it out. 
---
If you are logging back into a WH after 5 years you're gonna see some player owned structures and whatever POS you lived in is probably destroyed
---
Thanks for these man, pretty cool to see a write up over the battle that happened in ishomilken
---
Mystic is trash its a good 35km with meson and frentix
---
Wormholes also don't have fucking cynos, and you can lock down your systems.  The rewards are also greater.  Forcing spamming dscan like a retard in null without MASSIVE cyno nerfs would cause a huge amount of people to quit, and CCP can't afford that.
---
Pretty much.  Hunters should have to at least put as much effort into hunting as krabs do in being safe.  Doubly so when you can hunt in a ship that costs basically nothing, while krab ships are expensive and can't really fight off PVP ships.  The balance is skewed too far towards safety right now when all else is equal, but 99% of retard-roamers that I've seen just want content handed to them on a silver platter for no real effort or investment.  When that happens, half of the game will quit.  CCP can't afford that.
---
bad link?
---
As many have pointed out war dec corps are going to be your main downside and enemy. Outside of that it is just making the isk to fuel the thing, which is not difficult, but not easy either. It will cut into your isk making potential a lot and means always needing the isk, so no long breaks.
---
Find a quiet system away from any trade hubs or main routes to and from a trade hub and you will be fine. I recommend dropping your first one in high sec to learn how they function and their benefits; you can always scoop it up and move it to low sec later if you want, the only thing you will lose are the rigs.
---
Eve is about trying new things, don't let doing the wrong thing or the advice of others stop you from trying something out. After all it's just pixels.
---
Thank you,
---
have you read or watch a tutorial on how to scan? if thats too much for you, you might be right with your headline. the eve community is a very newbie friendly place. new players are the most valuable thing in this game. eve itself however is not. read or watch tutorials. everytime you have a question. many players did some amazing work to help you out. so do that. or bitch about it on reddit. that will help
---
You could have an out of alliance holding corp to own the structure and just give your real corp access to it.
---
more like 230 Baltec vs 120 NC Muninn and fort bombs. Soon after PL/PH fleet landed.  More Baltec keep reshippin/jumping. Reinforcement consisting of a Fleet of 130 eagles and a 50-60 Harpy fleet dic/booshers. at one point yall had over 600+ dudes
---
It was a good fight so stop spinning it .
---
Its not the structure the main concern about wardec.  
---
Its your haulers. High sec wardecers arent going after your raitaru. They targeting the hauler docking/undocking in Jita. In wardec, your haulers in Jita could be ganked. As long as a corp in your alliance owns a structure.
---
Yeah I had this happen too with an astero in Sansha space awhile ago. the last kill for a secure mainframe on zkill was [march 12](https://zkillboard.com/ship/33533/) maybe an update or bug to whatever reports kills?
---
I think the BR would disagree
---
Like the other guy said, the majority of bps are useless. I like to hoard the shitty blueprints until I have a crap load and then sell the whole pack for like 1-2 mil per. It gets a quick sell, and it’s not like you can sell it for better. The actual good ones (like mtu/depot/polarized/implant bps) that have a market and are used often I sell individually though.
---
And then you still can get war decced and have to defend it. Nothing really changes.
---
Is spending your time mining supporting the eve community though?
---
Gila’s sexier tho
---
What about the other shoe?
---
If you create it in lowsec you will get extorted. If you create it in high sec you will also get decced and maybe extorted, but it may take longer. If you create it in a WH you will be fine until the locals find you and then you will get attacked.
---
Meh I've build a 50 rockets/min factory and I still have more hours in PoE than factorio. Once you start blueprinting entire factories, factorio becomes actually kind of casual. There is a very clear endgame.

Cringe bait m8

It’s good to see you guys are getting some subcap fights! May there be many more.
---
Im not him, tho you can search "standup" stuff for the fuel blocks and calculate it yourself. Each service got different fuel cost.
---
an Astra with only reprocessing service need half load of DST to fuel.  
---
The static is the biggest concern. Highsec static will give you easier time to hauling but with highest traffic, making your hole filled with cloaky Loki. Null sec static is the hardest IMO if you dont have JF, tho low trafic is the best. Highclass WH with C2 static will give you the best balance for me.

I would say your fear is more a lack of confidence than anything. Alot of the gamers you play with were  young gamers once too.... they probably didn't have access to comms the way we do now.
---
We have some young people in our group and they are fine, respectful and competent players. That said, spend a few mins on YouTube and look up grungy kids on comms....if you're anything like them, then yes... be quiet.
---
A common problem younger players have is thinking they need to constantly talk. Know that you will learn much more listening, and the corp/fleet chat channels in game are the best place for your questions.
---
Window licking ice cream, dammit you made me laugh.. have my upvote.
---
God I can't wait. That'll be my answer to the cap spam.
---
Start talking, get social.
---
Makes being in a corp way more fun and helps you getting rid of that anxiety.
---
They allowed you in the corp, they won't care about age.
---
I'm only 18 and my corp mates still consider me as a child lmao
---
If you can't get into any of the null blocks as a willing newb you are either a troll or a very very annoying person.
---
Well, off course they must defend it.  
---
Im talking about Jita camper. Its likely something that OP dont know yet. and jita camper is such high frequency that I think this will be helpful. Its like twice a month some wardec corp aiming us in Jita.  
---
That if we using the industrialist as perspective. If we in wardec-ing corps, this is annoying because they need to go to the structure and bashing it. Instead of waiting some hauler in Jita and drink some beer.
---

Well i am not that young i am in my later Teens.  and i am not the much of a talker most of the time.

I just went looking and apparently I lost both my CD and my ripped tracks :(
---
Most of your allience are children
---
I think goons don't care ^(and don't have to care) about zkill stats...
---
We have an FC who is like 14 or something(I can't remember exactly).
---
Go chat on your comms and be an active participant in whatever group you are in. You might get some comments, like woman do(girls play eve?), or I get as a South African(say fkin prawns!, or you sound like Korg).
---
 But run with it and just have fun dude.If your alliance has an issue with your age, get another one.
---
Just go for a bigger ship. It takes no skill and no IQ to fly a titan in a large battle.
---
i r8 this b8 1/8 m8
---
I am trying to build standings with SOE.  Just found out their only Level 3 Security Agent is in Simela, a constellation with only one other High Sec system.  I don't relish the idea of taking my Gnosis into Low Sec solo. Should I switch to running Distro missions until I can pull level 4's and just skip the L3 Sec Agent all together? 
---
o7 Thanks

Go to bed, Mike.

TESTs last offensive in the North. Goons deploying to Hakonen, INIT deploying to Hakonen.
---
All three "invasions" were squashed before they really got started.
---
wow it's almost as if i'm talking about eve: online the video game and not real life ya fucking mong
---
The quality of goon bait posting has really declined lately.
---
Bring back StainGuy!
---
morale is the deciding factor, not economics
---
Remember that for anything you're having difficulty doing, someone has probably already done it and made a great video about how to do it.
---
How's tribute going, bitch?
---
Not really, there is no way ncpl or anyone in eve right now can beat goons (well beside if they ally like they did in the casino war but I don't see that ever coming again tbh). We already know the outcome of this current war and those about to come goons will  (sadly, don't get me wrong) win every war
---
If you knew how small is the NC pocket, you wouldn't say that.
---
NC have a very few ratters, and I think there was like 3 titans ratting.
---
are you stuck in the irony dimension
---
Visio possibly. You can make nice diagrams in that, it's mostly used for network diagrams but you can insert your own icons etc.
---
I have few my ex corp members in NC atm.       
---
All PVE chars landed in NC renter groups including the titan chars.
---
low effort....

I distinctly remember being called retarded and getting shit on for suggesting NC. actually fight us in some good ol wargames.
---
***Hmmm***

delet this

&gt;lol zkill stats are more important 
---
Mmk.
---
Your english will improve if you use coms and speak up.
---
What does this even mean? Are you on drugs? I loved the sad email you sent to all my corp CEO's. We all got a good laugh at your expense, Hila. Shall I post it? I don't want to embarrass you too badly. it shows how pathetic and butthurt you were over being called a renter. Trying to claim your renter status was old. Would you like me to post Frat's standings sheet? You're still a renter. I really should repost that one thread about Dran telling you you're a worthless pile of shit before poaching all "your" corps and telling you to fuck off. Or the same ones from Noraus kicking you out of the coalition and telling you all you can ever do is rent. you guys are hilarious.
---
I still remember vividly you begging and begging me for help with teneriffis and how you failed miserably toasting one single TCU in teneriffis while I toasted the entire region + stations without losing a ship. Don't worry Hila, impotence happens at your age. you'll get used to it. Just be glad, 97%+ inactivity in your alliance is still better than your sperm count? So there's that...
---
It’s ok to talk, but just don’t be an idiot about it. If you’re annoying, yeah you can be kicked.
---
You spell Rorquall wrong

I thought you were a nice FC redline. Wtf happend how you got so salty? Ego?

Mate I started playing at 14 before my voice dropped, and I did fine in Goons, Brave, and Snuff. You got this.

I think alot of Americans don't class themselves as an adult till 21 as that's the legal drinking age

Yeah Mike is 15 and FCs ferox fleets like a champ.

I’m 17 and started when I was 14. I also fc’ed a bit when I was 15 and nobody cared about my age tbh.

As long as your behavior is mature you have nothing to worry about.   :)

So what you are saying is that the baltec fleet hold heroically until the field was stabilized.

Sounds like fuuun.

Cool story bee poster - goonfleetdotcom is that way 👉
---
You know that the character "Chessur" is no longer flown by the actual Chessur, right?
---
&gt;what future can we expect?
---
that depends entirely upon whether people actually want to play the game as it is, or not.
---
If you use the 75% standings booster you can decline missions with no standings loss. Use one of those and spend 2 days grinding to lvl 4 before it wear off, and just decline any mission not in HS.
---
What’s worse: bee posters allowed to post on reddit or your shit bait posts?
---
How does this even respond to what I said? Like I said, get yourself some balls SRP'd by lord master Gobbins young grasshopper. Then come talk to me. Otherwise, post your actual identity or shut the f*ck up.
---
Yep
---
I really wonder what the point of all this stuff is if it's "not in the pipeline". Don't they have stuff to work on that's actually going into the game ?
---
Obviously, you're with Test :D
---
You mean "Two Hundred dollar Battle".  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTn3vzCWS4o
---
so even though you are advised that 1300 was inaccurate you leave it up there.   Mittens confirmed the number that had moved so far.  That DSCAN has already been acknowledged as completely fake.   You should really correct your erroneous statement and either find the number mentioned on the fireside or reword it.
---
My personal record is 71million in 1 venture from 1 wormhole. Average is probably 30-40 million
---
I'm sure he learned a lot by seing his fleet getting deleted, a long fc path awaits him ^^

Current dread payout is like 500mil isk, they already stopped free dreadbombs.

Found 2 in my eve career 1 while rorq mining other one while searching an empty colossal to mine (did not found rock but officier :p)
---
4b/h solo is a weird number. This basically means you’re doing 8 sites an hour so you basically one cycle everything. You did not take in consideration that you need to roll the holes, (find one if nomading) make bookmarks and warp etc.
---
I think 2-3b/h is a more realistic income.
---
I’M SO SCARED OMG
---
Are you using faction pullers? How often do you have to remake them? Idk.how this strat will hold up after october when the boosters expire

For the officer stats.  
---
There was a post about officer hunter (wich i can´t find atm) in wich someone gave insight in how he hunts officer wich had most of the infos that i heard often enough that i tend to believe them.  
---
\- home regions  
---
\- cycle through !A LOT! of belts. Cycle the belts of a constellation with a lot of belts.
---
\- carrier to kill  
---
I have seen 1 officer in 5 years, in fountain.
---
For example "fountaincore" is running tengu bots in belts to spawn officers.
---
They neut and web pretty far out. And have an escort of BS with them.
---
&gt; Icelandic 
---
I'm pretty sure is a scandinavian thing. You see the same behavior from Dice, Starvault(Mortal Online), and Paradox Interactive. I don't know why it is, but these companies all hate player opinion.
---
Guys, stop this blue donut bullshit. This is why you always think that nullsec is about to collapse into nothing going on, while at the same time conflicts and fights are happening all over the place.  
---
If you free yourself of the wrong idea of a blue donut, but accept that diplomacy and allies are needed to survive in nullsec, you will find a much more realistic picture unfolding before you.  
---
Also: Even after a complete eviction, which I think would be good for the health of NC., they would rise again and build up. It's the circle of live ;)
---
This is part of doing work that's going into the game. Either figuring out the parts of the current ships they're introducing like the Trig stuff or preparatory work any redesigns they do later on. They may not redo the Thorax anytime soon but if they do redesign another Gallente ship, elements they like from these concepts will flow into that.
---
A lot of corp recruit via kills. Especially if they have a good attitude about losing their ship since that is the kind of people you want to have around you.
---
Similiar thing happened with my wh corp last night. Three of us in sabre's were chasing a cloaky pacificer around our hole. A legion uncloaks beside me.. I jump into a Tengu on the other side and we dock up to decide what to do.
---
We saw a Legion and a Tengu so decided that the 5 of us that were online would go fight them. Most of us were low skilled and we didnt have enough people for logi so decided on t1 bc fleet to fight and one t1 battleship. Well as we landed there was now a Leshak there too. Also a Sabre and two guardians. We thought ah screw it let's take the fight. 
---
Another Loki uncloaks and then a boosher was there too. After my ship went down before I could even crash into the hole it wouldn't have mattered. On the other side another sabre had bubbled up and there waiting was a balgorn, 4 more guardians!? an absolution and 2 more Loki's.
---
Regardless of the blobbing they didn't pod us or loot our wrecks which was nice of them.
---
lived*
---
Agreed. Tho I would extend that too *everybody,* not just goons. More carnage, more fun. I think the EVE community as a whole is far beyond the whole "elite" thing at this point. Relic of the past.
---
this will definitely be in next video right?
---
I don't bother anymore, swapping ships in citadels takes forever and I just don't care enough to reroll. If the chain sucks it can stay sucking and I'll go play something else. Cuts down on the stress and the Maths.
---
Just as an aside: you do realize nobody calls it "Providence Bloc", right? We all get what you mean by it, but it just looks weird.
---
test i guess
---
Logibro are the best, sometime it's hard to see the needs through the spam of broadcasted rep, watch your watchlist to keep your logi bro alive, check that the anchor is still right and see if primaried but what is better to save someone that is on low structure?
---
where are all these morons coming from?
---
Wait what, when did that happen?

Would love to see an after action report in your words with links to zkill and what not

  You should have seen how stagnant null was when Northern Associates and Goons controlled all sov back in 2014

I will try lurking Amazon/eBay though.

I really want to join one of the big alliances and do stuff now. Reading the stories and it sounds extremely fun.
---
Actually, considering that you have a week of invul timer in highsec, does this make any sense? The war will be over before the structures hull will be vulnerable
---
Apparently.
---
America is extremely weird with those laws. Though its prolly better than suddenly losing all limits when 18 and drunk driving just cause you can.
---
So, the Dscan you linked started appearing after the KQK onlining fleets. [This](https://adashboard.info/intel/dscan/view/ly4ahgUE#zg-total) is the dscan I have from our fleets.
---
Funny how that everything except for the Aeon and Apostle it's exactly 4 times higher than what we actually had.
---
no, but economics are the base and spine of succesful empires. Every war will be lost if your supply can't match your losses. If you destroy the enemy's economy, you win.
---
Horde is the new retirement home for elites
---
So far i have 3. I buy those +75% standing boosters. Once i run out of missions i jump clone to null sec and wait till i can request missions again.
---
Woh haha, you know the thought had never crossed my mind up until the other night / and your story. That groups go to this much effort and organise a kill. Now I know all of this it makes it so much more interesting to know that, you just never know what is watching you in WH SPACE!  Think I need to join a corp, I am only in my own single man corp. Im finally flying  Loki , and I think after a bit more skilling I need to get involved in this 100%. Cool story Mizova !
---
As a follow up, he did message me. We have chatted a bit, but then he... well he had his critical moment as CCP just recently called it. I EVE mailed him. I hope he gets me back.
---
Yeah, maxing those skills makes a world of difference.
---
Are you kidding? With the wardec changes, it has been a blast. I am full time MALRO now :D
---
Huh? Only people salty here are the ones downvoting me giving props to a newer FC for stepping up in a coalition where people don't.

try DCSS

This, have an old German Corpmate who learnt English from talking in our English corp. From what he says it really helped with his job irl.

no cares about your age as long as you don't act like you're 10

Not everyone is beyond it, find people linking kill mails and BR's thinking it makes them look good often enough.
---
I started this game when I was 13 years old, I had just read Enders Game and looked up space games online and came across Eve Online. I’ve never had an issue with playing the game except for being broke most of the time, but my age never made any conflicts. I love this game and the people I’ve met through it. Game has really shaped me going into adulthood with great people I’ve met.
---
Fuck it. Olmeca Gold for CSM maybe he'll do something about bots and not forget us Wormholers
---
&gt; retirement home for elites
---
oh right, BUSA is ex-PL aren't they?
---
Goons, man. They love you when you provide them content but hate you when you stop. Toospooky.
---
It's a serious post
---
just look at the prices. minerals are nearly the same (or lower) as 10 years ago. That's why we have a massive oversupply. Compared with the inflation of plex, titans should cost now 350-400B and supers 100B.
---
:)
---
&gt; they would rise again and build up. 
---
With 1300 titans on their ass I'm not sure...
---
Tapi has a nip
---
Triglavian?
---
no
---
To be fair even as a 28 year old, i class an 18 year old as a child.
---
Even Goonswarm want a big opponent. Alliances leaders don't take care so much of contents
---
actual is this the fabian strategy... dont pick fights till enemy has a weak point then deliver as much pain as possible... 
---
maybe not totally accurate but courently kind a waorks... WE already also had fleets we fucked up big ... and Init made a delicious smartbomb run on our eagles ... we where lucky there not loosing 50% of our ships there... 
---
And ofc there will be some baited stuff where we eat shit too. This is the playstyle we choosed to play against that number of opponents.
---
&gt; Won’t Caldari or Amarr forces attack me since I’m Minmatar?
---
It doesn’t’t work like that. Ypi have a faction standing. Should it get too low, then yes.
---
You know bill gates right ? He made his war chest in N... ! Ohh wait !? This is wrooong !
---
I think paying an account, doing PI and research/inventing from that one toon for passive isk, then use it to fool around like;  
---
Camping uedama with sniping throaway frigate to steal killmail from the ganker.  
---
sniping command dessies with one turet, mjd, and a cloak in a war as neutral to steal killmail is lot of laugh.  
---
Or sniping gate camp and join the kill mail as completely stranger from the camper.  
---
I dont know whats with me and sniping, but you must have something for you. find it. Treat the game as a game. have fun with these box of sand.
---
so? they can still be a good opponent hypothetically
---
No idea why your being downvoted? It’s a legitimate strategy, the north has no chance directly fighting goons head on
---
Officers are wildly different, some can be killed in a VNI, others will rape any subcap other than a passive tanked Rattlesnake.
---
It’s ok, I’m use to the dumpster :^ )
---
Saving the comment to read later.
---
Regarding PI. I've thought of doing as much as I can on a single toon since I rely on ingame PLEX to sub and currently I cant support more than one toon. Do I need to do PI on an alt or can I just focus it on a single toon? Only thing I'll ever do on an alt is mining.
---
I don't have a scrennshot but it's literally just a cube. You have 8 probes, a cube has 8 vertices. Imagine a cube and put one probe in each corner.
---
Goonswarm doesn't want a big opponent. They want to be the strongest in the game because they were once the weakest. Now that they are, they will not let another group build up to their level unless they have them shackled by the balls.
---
That's EVE. And it would take all of EVE to unseat that alliance from the top. 
---
But that doesn't kill nullsec. Nullsec will never die as long as their are people playing the game. Despite thrashing anyone who poses a threat to their force, Goons know they could simply own nullsec if they wanted to. That's not what they're after though.
---
You fit in well with test then.
---
You have the perfect attitude to actually enjoy EVE for a long time. Keep at it and don't become bitter.
---
What's so hard to understand about "there are cynos and tanky ships with small noses everywhere"?
---
Damn, that sucks.
---
Started with 16 and was quickly annoyed by age limitations on some corps recruitment and also didn't like the huge null comms, but I quickly found my home in a wh corp that took me with open arms, kinda grew up in the game with them.
---
English skills don't matter at all, can't be worse then some romanian/french FCs I've flown with. They say the command 10 times and I still don't understand.
---
Don't want to get better? Not able to google information? Yeah, you probably are too dumb. Good riddance
---
Check out public fleets!
---
these NPSI fleets will take absolutely everyone, no matter the corp and you can have fun, right out of highsec.
---
Google "Spectre Fleet" for normal roaming and "Bombers Bar" for hotdropps with alot of bombers on capitals.
---
We get kids in test sometimes, they get headpats and made fun of occasionally, but we're generally cool to em. Pretty sure most corps are like that. We had a few squeakers, I think the youngest we ever had in our fleets was like 11?
---
2nd strongest supercap is Legacy, not NCPL, maybe last year, not today.
---
Problem is no1 and no2 are allied, so there isn't much room to make big plays.
---
opponent =/= ally
---
He is a really good pilot no doubt but his best skill is finding people willing to fight him.
---
With fax nerfs, chances of loosing a dumbo Titan to a dread bomb are much higher than before and you always have a few of them in standing.
---
f
---
And yet when ncph sends a fleet east, you get to eye level of mittens belt buckle
---
This made me chuckle. Have my upvote
---
Good strategy,  but its only useful if they plan to fight back another day and we just dont see that happening with a fractured northern bloc.  I seriously doubt GotG and PH becoming but buddies ever again and pl is just a shell of what it used to be and they seem to be resigned to playing a different type of game then other traditional null groups; mainly trying to avoid big tidi fuck fests.  
---
NC isn't big enough on it's own right now to counter the Imperium without a functioning cooperative north  and even if they did they still need an industrial and non-rental empire to be able to build up just like the Imperium did after the Casino War.
---
I started FCing at 14 - You’ll be fine. EVE players don’t give a fuck about how old you are, what you look like, or what you stick your dick in, as long as you’re good!
---
Do you fucking know the meaning of hypothetically?
---
I've been playing since I was 14. I was cringy af and hate my memories, but mmy alliance mates were generally super nice, and gave me loads of support. A whitenoise menber called Byteme Scruples taught me loads and gave me a billion isk (which I still feel bad about), and effectively got me to enjoy the game and find my confidence on comms (even if I was annoying). You will find some people that dislike you, but you will largely find more friends. It is worth it. Just be respectful and willing to learn. Age does not matter a lot honestly. 
---
I've had 15 year olds better than 30 year olds and vice versa. Age does not completely define you.
---
I take a reddit break every time the computer tells me heat is forcing it to throttle the CPU and shutting down Rimworld might help performance.
---
He has a shit ton of experience and knows exactly which parts of space he should avoid and where he can find interesting fights flying solo.
---
I sat at 40% armor through all the fight until I got primaried, but I was repped twice to full armor
---
We suffered 7 or 8 bombing runs + constant bombs and neuts from fortizar
---
Everything you said is false:
---
&gt; Goonswarm doesn't want a big opponent. 
---
Oh yes they want
---
&gt; Now that they are, they will not let another group build up to their level unless they have them shackled by the balls. 
---
Legacy is in peace. 2nd strong coalition, 2nd ratting coalition.
---
&gt; that's EVE. And it would take all of EVE to unseat that alliance from the top. 
---
 More than half of EVE is in Imperium side (From GOTG to Legacy).
---
&gt; But that doesn't kill nullsec. Nullsec will never die as long as their are people playing the game. 
---
So Serenity is not a problem for you?
---
&gt; That's not what they're after though. 
---
They don't want. Look at NC how boring it can be to hold so many systems (from tribute to Malpais)
---
Pretty accurate tbh, however you still need to choose location wisely
---
You gotta sacrifice people to the blood god sometimes.
---
I don't care. I see that they aren't, it's all that matter for me.
---
You mean the [Tiamat](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tiamat)?
---
NC, PL, PH, TRI, FRAT, BOT, TIKLE, SNUFF, and RR are only a few alliances who shoot goons. Imperium
---
may have the upper hand in direct confrontation, but that can change. If something forces Legacy or Goons to set the other red someday, or if the new Mango coalition grows like Fraternity did, then Imperium could lose probably lose a war. Many things can happen that could shift the odds over night believe it or not. NC PL and another alliance or two could merge into a single organized alliance. Who knows what could happen, but things will continue to develop and change.
---
Why only 1 adaptive? My passive Gila has 2.
---
We were literally 111 people at the beginning of the fight and until PH came.
---
How is that not outnumbered ?
---
Hon Hon hon
---
Oh, that's interesting.  Care to elaborate?  What happens to players docked in structures that get destroyed?  They just drop out into space?
---
Baltec fleet being twice our numbers until backup arrived from both side.
---
Best way to learn any language is by listening to people speak it. You get to hear the pronunciation and in what context it can be used in

I shot you on field, but we had lost a lot of the critical mass to shoot you through reps before reinforcement arrived at that point
---
Thanks for this good answer.
---
Indeed many thing can change but atm nothing shows that it's going in this way.
---
In my post I dont mean that I want kill Imperium. Just balance the sides.
---
Let's also mention that they had triage on field why outnumbering 2 to 1, and still had to bring another eagle fleet.
---
Great report keep this going!
---
Isn't it against the developer agreement to use ESI credentials for something without telling the user?
---
Add titan 5 to a skill plan and see what happens
---
I started playing this game when I was 13. Can confirm, as long as you have a good attitude and aren't a screecher, nobody cares how old you are.
---
i remember when i was oh so very bad at scanning. training up the skills helps and techniques already discussed in this thread also help.
---
What was you drinking?
---
The Hydra and Tiamat are pretty bad, sadly.
---
Haha... owned!
---
J'ai pas compris
---
Create a specific one man corp to operate the structure, and that character should have the structure skills for missiles, engineering and electronics to IV.        If you decided to defend it just move your PvP and logi toons in to that corp, otherwise leave the war deckers to it and continue krabbing up to replace it.
---
I am enjoying it so far.
---
I give u upvote for that
---
Not just listening - having a chat with. Seeing/hearing others’ reaction to your fumbles is important. Especially is there’s a friendly banter around it.
---
what is: export to Jita
---
and also - if you put real stress on the supply lines, destroy and capture the mids, then the import will be a pita.
---
You can have quadrillions of ISK, but when you can't buy anything for it or get your stuff to where it's needed, money is worthless.
---
I just hope there's a garlic butter pocket next to it :D Snails are actually fucking good when you get past the weirdness of it.
---
VR chat in jita station
---
&gt;It’s a legitimate strategy, the north has no chance
---
what year is it?
---
You lose standings if you decline too much. Some missions i prefer not to run since they take too long
---
Can I join in? Looking for some highsec shenanigans
---
Is that some 3rd party app?
---
More or less. That being said, it's really hard to prove a website is engaging in any wrongdoing.
---
Lmao
---
Yes it might be the place your looking for just remember that wh living requires alot of scouting and everyone doing there part in the search for content. Alts are also really a plus in whs for scouting etc. I would just have a look in r/evejobs and have a look there. Otherwise I can can put you in contact with my corp CEO for a chat if you like, we live in a c4 with c3/c5 static which is really nice for ppl that are new to whs but can already fly some more than just starter ships.
---
Are GOTG and Legacy "on Goons side"?  I think they're kind-of neutral.
---
No one really cares about your age, it's more a question of comms etiquette. Like I've heard people that are at an age where you would think they would understand that be total cancer on comms.
---
Know when it's time to speak, which situation to say what, etc
---
It's a lot but not that much (see the last meta-show for more info).  There were 1,000 faxes though.
---
You know how EVE is. Its a very deep game. The political narritives and player-driven storyline develope slowly, they always have. Someone is always at the top of the totem-pole. Not long ago we were in the position that NC/PL find themselves in now. We've been the underdog multiple times over the course of the games history. What currently sets us apart is the way we have chosen to approach empire building. Any other group could choose to do the same and succeed.
---
No one is denying the objective thing. I guess all get why they came for :)
---
Delet C4
---
They're a bit rubbery but the idea is that the snails are a delivery mechanism for the garlic butter.
---
Must have been an accident.
---
A mix of PI and SP farming make my alt paid for themselves
---
GOTG is currently fighting alongside goons in the North, Legacy is a kind a goon pet until they think they are safe by blueing 75% of the universe.
---
If The Imperium would've left NCPL alone for another year the power disparity wouldn't have decreased. It would've increased because the way NCPL run things doesn't inspire growth.
---
Yeah the trigger
---
How do you make that much hauling?
---
How about use stuff to ref the fort without its Range... like we did serveral times in the past. Maybe Long-Range-Dreads or 6 of the 600 Titans you brought up north and so on. I am not saying you did a bad job. You had other tactical cards on hand to deny us the fun we had. 
---
To be clear i can understand you didnt expect a fight and where kind a pants down in the moment of the start. You did best what you could and won the objective too.
---
Gnosis w blasters + a bubble often works pretty isk efficient
---
Every coalition can lose every fight with 20% efficiency without it meaning anything to their SRP wallet. 
---
Wars are lost when people stop logging in
---
I am pretty sure megathrons are easy to replace and I don't think Goons have problems replacing Bhaals while living in Blood Space.  
---
Still nice to see space pixels getting blown up
---
Happy Cake Day Shalmon_! The only dare you ever want to take is the dare to be all that you can be.
---
imagine thinking that reddit account is actually killah lmao
---
You find items that sell at 10m in null and buy at 16m in jita, haul, proffit.
---
This is probably an insanely dumb question (as I installed the game few hours ago), but how do I equip my standard stock weapons back to my tutorial ship? I’m on a tutorial mission Balancing the Books 2/10 and while I was looking for a civilian scavenger, I unequipped my turrets by a mistake and I have no idea how to get them back because all other turrets are out of my skill range.
---
It was fun:
---
No goons on grid. Hit jump.
---
*insert elevator music while in jump tunnel for a minute*
---
Finish jump, align, overload MWD, wait 15 seconds until mods start to kick in.
---
Watch goons uncloack, lock and scram immediately.
---
Thanks CCP.
---
Maybe he means people that dodge taxes.
---
&gt;if you put real stress on the supply lines
---
impossible, takes far more effort than it's worth
---
&gt;You can have quadrillions of ISK, but when you can't buy anything for it or get your stuff to where it's needed, money is worthless.
---
this never happens
---
Good fight NC, way to bring the heat.
---
Go for cheap frigs and dessies. 
---
Double web hookbill is pretty good. Also extremely cheap because calmil is at tier 5. 
---
A brawl algos is super fun as well for as little as 15mil or less. 
---
For cruisers, a scythe fleet issue is a good solo ship. Fit rapid light and xlasb.
---
Money wise the most you can get is to join calmil and run l4 missions in jackdaw/Hecate when in tier 5. If you cash out at 800isk per lp you still make 800m in 1:30h. 
---
If you have patience you can get way more.
---
lol.?
---
Now you need to find the frog :D
---
Train social V, or use both the 50% and 75% boosters.
---
Your welcome :)
---
That would be more convincing if nc wasn't bleeding Ihubs. They are rapidly running out of time to get their shit together.
---
If the value of it being cool is high enough for you then go for it. If you don't go out of your way to upset people, and don't put it up in a near-hub system like Perimeter, it's unlikely you'll get shot at.
---
Good luck lol....
---
Just eat pure garlic butter then?
---
There are multiple fights everyday.
---
goon hunting strategy guide:
---
krab hard for 6 months on 2 dozen alts in relative safety to earn hundreds of billions of isk.
---
go to delve and moan unironically about risk averse goons.
---
Hecate is probably a really good choice
---
We pretty much hunt reds in anything and everything.
---
You'll love getting bosoned on a gate.
---
Hi, you can temporarily join Pandemic Horde, ride on their logistics and seeding setup, make your life simple. Solo hunt or hunt in groups. Plenty of blops going around too.
---
We've had plenty of younger people in corp, the only ones who have really turned out to be problems are the ones who are *obviously* young and obnoxious. If you're chill and you fit in with the corp culture, nobody will care what your age is. And if you don't fit in with the corp culture, there's plenty of other corps out there.
---
Besides, if you get kicked simply for being young, but not otherwise being obnoxious and stuff, it's a shit corp anyway and you can always join another one.
---
goons only deploy so we can get more toddfa vids

Join eve Uni if you want to learn about the game. They've different campuses that provide a taste of just about everything excluding Sov space alliance battles. 
---
They offer classes, a wide collection of staff willing to answer any questions you have, each campus has their own program and a lot even include reshipping. Hell, they even have skill book reimbursement (Up to 3.5 million per book per day.)  
---
No obligation, come and go as you please, stay and learn or find some new friends along the way and join off them. Either ways, its a great place to hang around and learn about New Eden while you build experience. I don't think there's many corporations that have much bad to say about The Uni either.

Get a blue alt (very easy to do) and a Hecate.
---
Blue alt to Goons? In what would that be helpful in the long run if this is what you are talking about?
---
you won't pull the spod over my eyes, BOB-boy, i listen to the fireside, i listen to the meta show, i'm at the bleeding edge of truthdom and nobody is going to cover up our success

Some salty goons in this thread.

Scouting gates, scouting targets without scaring them off.
---
From you people... Hey there guy calm down no reason to get all nasty, it's just a game.
---
If you care to get the knowledge you can also make good ISK with cherrypicking L4 Burners in Lowsec. Usually gives you the same ISK/hour like supercarrier ratting.
---
I would have thought that they can identify a blue alt quite easily but I’ll keep it in mind
---
Nous sachons!

AAR.

I'd just finished having a late dinner when the ping went out. The baltec fleet was full so I couldn't get in. Then I remembered I had dropped some pasta down the side of the oven when I was dishing up. It's quite difficult to get to, the oven is heavy and there are units beside it so I thought I could reach it with a pen but it was too short so I tried taping two pens together and that was also too short. 
---
Ran into the bedroom and grabbed a coat hanger and tried using that but it was too wobbly and just flapped about like elo knight. I grabbed some more tape and some more pens and used the pens to stabilise the coat hanger and create a rudimentary coat hanger claw. It worked a treat and I have started using the coat hanger claw for every day tasks such as petting animals and reassuring worried children.
---
Then I got in the second fleet and shot some things using the clawhanger. What a time to be alive.
---
The 1st and 2nd are allied against the 3rd, which they both dislike more than each other.
---
Once they get rid of the 3rd (which it very much seems like they are finally getting around to) they will eventually get bored and start shooting each other. Maybe if enough of the pilots from the ruins of the 3rd join/ally with the 2nd, it can become a fairly even fight.
---
&gt;feed us long range dread kills
---
That's all I got out of this message
---
Is that Gary?
---
Wait a second. The last war, which included tapi, you guys squashed before it started. But this war, without tapi, you guys are so outnumbered, so out matched that goons are just bullying you like children. These conflicting narratives fc what do?
---
No you don't. Removing local would destroy a lot of other playstyles and your writing makes it clear that you do not give a damn about that.
---
a thought that i had dovetails neatly with this - could you configure the bot to only care about one system per channel, then set up channels by system?
---
then, if people aren't concerned about systems other than their own, they can mute those channels and suppress @here in them
---
Good with the dick, right?
---
Glad to hear those changes have been positive for you :)
---
This, Also get Scanning rigs, and Scan upgrade mods for you ship.
---
Rig:  Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I
---
Mid Slot:  Scan Rangefinding Array I
---
Problem is that 2nd pretends to be like 11th or something. There is simply no ambition there.  The current 1st and 3rd have always played to be no.1 and have gotten it and lost it over the past few years. 2nd is in it for the participation medal, not the gold.
---
Even with the 75% Booster you lose standing, I blitz Burners that way with 3 pullers, after usung booster on one puller for about 3 hours the char lost from 9.9 to 7.9 agent standing. So I switch the char using booster every time, and sometimes I just do the missions I get in 12 slots with 1 decline.
---
When the baltec fleet first undocked and bridged, we were 160 mans and women in fleet
---
Alright. Is there any risk of losing the items before being able to pick them up?
---
\* respiration lourde \*
---
Something similar has happened to me. I like having my items in a specific order on the fitting window. If I move one item to another slot, the previous slot would still be occupied. I'd have to remove the item and put it in my inventory for it to fix itself.
---
Baddest of the Bads. The Baddies!
---
The tutorial / civilian turrets should be in your hangar. To equip them, you can either right click them and select the "Fit to active ship" option, or open the fitting window (Alt + F) and drag and drop them in your ship's free turret slots.
---
For the record if you dock at any station in your pod where you have no ship you will get a free corvet again.
---
regarding your weapons you probably have unfitted them in your item hangar so check it out and drag it in a high slot on the fitting window and if should be good.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers when solo battle ventures with 1-2 warp stabs were the most cancerous things to engage in low sec FW.
---
Just dont act like a little shit, i started playing eve at 12 and was fine. Its only ever an issue with whiny kids who cant take the losses and are immature.
---
This ^

Just dont act like a whiny kid and you’ll be fine, i remember leading shitty kitchen sink frig gangs in calmil when i started eve (12 y/o)
---
OPSEC pls delete this
---
By what? Titans should have been deployed. If it gets tackled then no one is saving it, and goons will join in at laughing at it dying (maybe even whoring on the mail themselves).
---
do never not tell him his chat with u/Themittani is all based on lies.
---
Blue alt that can use covert ops cloak, warp to sites cloaked, get close to target and allow your main to jump into system and warp to your alt. Just remember to warp your alt off before main lands, you don't want to decloak it and have it kicked.
---
Using comms, talking or not, already makes you a winner. People who join fleets and refuse to open comms should be beaten into complaince, in game of course.  It is my experience people are way harder on themselves than their Corp mates. I mean as long as you aren't acting like a douche nobody cares what your voice sounds like.

Oh god, what kind of fit/pod do you have to reach that insane 4k dps?

Awsome vid btw, I'm waiting for more !

Grab yourself a Wolf and go ham killing VNIs. Use a hecate and kill Excavators and miners. Anchor a bubble in 1DQ1 on any of the gates and get dudes moving carelessly cause Delve is so safe.
---
If you have more than one account, use a hecate &amp; magus to boosh excavs and kill them before they can recall all of them. Get in contact with Olmeca or whomever and organize drops on supers watching over the rorquals.
---
What the others already said, we have a 13 year old FC in Goonswarm and for his age he does a friggin good job at it. Dont be afraid to speak up. Most people here only judge you by your actions and not by your age, even welcome young blood
---
not all frigs in wh space are ours :)
---
I'm sorry to say this video shouldnt be compared to an RnK video. Infact you go way more in depth about how the tactics work and explain a lot more. You wouldnt believe the difference this makes as u might inspire some people to go it alone and adopt your tactics! Great video, appreciate all your hard work on it. o7
---
What are you talking about? It can fit a covertops cloak so it can also take covops bridges.
---
I was thinking T3C but I guess nothing lives that long in Delve so probably better off with a Wolf or Hecate as most people are suggesting
---
Depending what drops we will see in incursions.       
---
For sure price will spike for BPC needed for invention of new ships.      
---
I expect up to 100mil for triglavian cruiser BPC.          
---
It is not only that many ships will be constructed, but also about simple fact that you will use up a lot of those BPC for invention.        
---
I am also interested what those incursions will be drop.         
---
Like if CCP will introduce triglavian module/gun drops it will cut what people can get from the trig space itself.

In my experience, killmails form ghost site are bugy.

You can use a cloaky arty loki and bubblecamp a popular travel pipe, but yeah its cheaper to use a hecate and wolf.

Provi

We always welcome people to come and test themselves in a harsh and violent area. There are lots of kills to be had. Just so you know flying out in your pod is not really that great though because there is not a public market for anyone other than Imperium members. Try to get in with one of the groups that hunt us and figure out what you can get or if they have a logistics service to get you ships out here.  Those of us charged with defending the homeland are having a great time, as well as all of those who have come out to harass us. Look forward to possibly seeing you in our space.
---
Give it some time. I don't think I saw a single offensive ping for a fleet until the KQK-keepstar was up. After that there have been constant pings every day. Things are burning, you just haven't gotten updates of every single thing that is going on. Up untill Yesterday move-ops had been going on several times a day. The war is only just starting.
---
You can get 2 Bil. with 1 hour work IRL, why should I grind this shit ingame, then it wouldn't be a game but a 2nd job ...

New "incursions" but triglavian flavored and only in HS for now. New ships (AF, HAC and command dessy) and HS war revamp where you get a HQ to kill to win a war. All the rest is negligible.

&gt; 2/ i got lot of stuff far from jita and went through few low sec system. How is the gank now ? Is it completely unreasonable to make my way back with a battleship loaded with my stuff ? Or is there another way ?
---
Depend how much we're talking about, I would scout my way ahead and check zkill for kills on the system you're traveling to check for gate camps.
---
I have to say, this works whether or not Goons are deployed.  But of course it helps if you're blue to the campers.
---
Spa faux
---
scram will shut down his mwd  
---
web will slow him  
---
neut will shut down every thing else  
---
If you put all of this on him, your heavy drones will wreck him
---
Add a set of warrior or EC-300 to deal with kite AF like retrib
---
2 months isn't bad at all for the level of isk/hr incursions bring in.
---
It would really spin heads if the 'good fight' mentality went as far as, "Hang on, you don't have enough ships, here some of my guys are going to fight with you to even it up."
---
I can't help feeling like this would be a step in the wrong direction.
---
Current structure mechanics have a lot of problems, the end result of which tends to be excessive grinding and blue-balling. But I'm not sure the right thing is to outsource that grinding to NPCs, and those NPCs certainly won't serve as replacement for actual content.
---
Also regarding the mining fleets. Kind of sounds like you're suggesting CCP just give in and just program mining bots into the game itself. At least now the mining bots are player characters flying real player ships. Turning those bots into actual NPCs would remove any remaining incentive to hunt them at all.
---
DO NOT QUIT THE GAME.
---
Take a look in youtube tutorials! I passed through the same pain when i started, at the SAME thing (scanning).
---
You need the playes skils + right fitting + character skills to be effective. This doesnt mean that you NEED them, the great they are, the better you are to do those stuffs.
---
Please, keep trying, soon you will be great doing that, believe me!
---
High IQ is great but persistence can beat it several times.
---
Make a friend so that you can at least scout for each other.
---
Easiest thing to do: google "eve gate check"
---
Ebter your route. Links to zkill automatically and tells you where there have kills recently on the gates.
---
two heavy neuts will definetly save you from a ramjag, maybe not from the rest of the grid, but certainly from a ramjag. Not sure where you're taking cynos and tanky shipd from my reply
---
They always do that, from time to time while selling plexes

lol

Fun and learning &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kills
---
I started at 15, nobody cares. I was even Director at one point.
---
I did translate the $200 Battle and some other videos, but I'm not the sole translator.
---
You do realize that npcs are mining regardless of weather you contract them on not on asteroid belts right . I suggest you form a fleet and go fight them to see how bad ass their response fleet is . I am just saying let the mechanics be of use to players than just mining away to nothingness. How is that you think they wont serve as content . You either undock and fight or you lose your structure ? You would rather stay there and grind any structure in a timezone you dont wanna even wake up to where the enemy is probably sleeping as well. i think its a means to an end .
---
How come you had null loaded? Instead of anti/void.
---
Ha nice
---
/care
---
Don't need more NPCs; need less. Want to improve LS/NPC null? Stop allowing massive groups of people to sustain themselves off tiny areas and force them to expand. This also addresses super proliferation because a much smaller amount of people would be living within the same jump range.
---
Anyone who has ever played a classic RTS can understand this: Imagine if you could gather infinite resources from your base without the need to expand and build outposts or compete for resources. Obviously there would be no incentive for players to take risks because there is no reward and the most logical choice is to just keep collecting resources.
---
&gt; You do realize that npcs are mining regardless of weather you contract them on not on asteroid belts right.
---
Yes, but right now they are essentially just a means to remove resources from the game. What you are suggesting would be a way for people to passively gain resources without having to put any assets on the line; mine without making themselves a target. That's not creating content, that's the exact opposite of creating content.
---
&gt; How is that you think they wont serve as content .
---
Few people would consider NPC fleets as a replacement for what we generally consider "content" in EVE.
---
Again, you would be able to act without having to put any assets on the line. Even force your enemy to put defensive forces on grid without having to put anything at risk yourself. (And no, ISK and sec-status doesn't count.)
---
Those defensive forces wouldn't consider a NPC fleet "content" worth forming for. Just more grinding added to a structure mechanic already very heavy on grinding.
---
...will never know the EVE sandbox.
---
CCP is intentionally turning this into a themepark.
---
I'm sure there are still a few Titans left in Delve, and I'm sure someone is dumb enough to try it.
---
One of the best FCs I ever flew with was like 14 when he started, we made jokes about him being a kid bit that kid was very much welcomed, your age doesn't matter your attitude does.
---
In Eve you have skills that not only able you to equi certain ships or modules, but they make you better at that thing. You need to keep training scanning skills. Also, there are ships with bonuses to scanning. You can scan with any ship but if you use a Helios, Astero, Stratios, etc. they have bonuses. There are also modules that help ou with scanning. Sum up all that and you can scan whatever you want.
---
It is common for MMOs with PVP to end up with one dominating force. The most frequent way I have seen those broken apart is with drama or stolen accounts / assets.
---
The majority of players are risk adverse and want to be on the winning side.
---
Just get into 1DQ and join the local gatecmpers. We're losing morons left right and center to them. Ass frigs and bombers are high in course. Kikis are rare but effective too.
---
NBDS ( not bee dont shoot )
---
How long does it normally take to clear out an entire gas site?
---
Sleeper sites are very difficult to scan down.  It's quite possible that you might have one of those.  Go on to another site.  Most high sec anoms should be fairly easy to scan.  
---
Have you tried the exploration career agent tutorial yet?
---
Great corp and bunch of guys - been in eve nearly 15 years and 5 years with TDSIN.
---
Corps are the people:
---
Exo is great laidback Ceo, particularly like all the guys you get to meet IRL (TDSIN likes evemeets - been to Fanfest (we usually have about 10 there) Vegas, Eve Northeast (twice - run by EXO) Eve Glasgow (also TDSIN run) and Amsterdam with these guys.
---
Can you share a fit?
---
Yes but the its a win win for the defensive force . For one you get paid for your defense in LP and Minerals, 2, the aggressor is going to pay more and more for the next contract ? Its better than No consequences at all for unchecked structures? Yes they will be mining without making themselves a target but this also means the aggressor for aggression get paid more than what needs for making the attack of aggression ? Assuming you ambush an R32 moon that was contracted to mine and by attacking at the opportune moment you can get away with close to 500mil in loot + probably a bill in moon ore . See both sides of the picture at the moment there are so many ppl just dont want to even mine these moons in lowsec/NPC because its not worth it .
---
I'll admit I chuckled.
---
&gt;&gt; the idea is that the snails are a delivery mechanism for the garlic butter.
---
&gt; Just eat pure garlic butter then?
---
Only if you eat it at a snails pace.
---
Haha, i am 28 and still being younger in my corp :)
---
But, like others say, nobody cares about your age, it's your attitude what really matters. Of course, if you have a child attitude, you will be treated like a child, even you are 40.
---
As long as you know what you are doing, or are atleast willing to learn, almost noone will care how old you are.
---
Just act mature and most people probably wont even notice.
---
Also, speaking helps with learning english.
---
welcome to EVE
---
That wrecking hit on the Tengu tho.
---
Can you please tell me which"Massive groups are living in NPC null/Lowsec right now(Other than snuffed out). 0 . Also you fail to read my post . 1) You lose standings if your contract gets destroyed , 2) Its more and more only my dear friend its exponential. 2 the influence is regional . The person has to grind for a more and more LP for more and more contracts . Without Building and outpost ? the whole point of contracts is because you have an outpost ( ie your refinery on the moon) and you still need to move all that ore . Dude listen we had poses which did worse than what i just proposed to moon  mining and still loved/played the game . If you are on that 5% who wants to make the game a chore then be my guest . Right now we don't have enough players to fill any of this space that you are so righteously defending about . Everyone is Sov null right now .
---
You age has notthing todo with your ability to blap ships does it? :D
---
I agree with that. As I recall it, around release Jetcan mining wasn't even a thing. I think I read in an interview or something that the devs had plotted progression curves under the assumption people would use the old mining frigates (which had 300 m3 hold or something) and cruisers to work up to a battleship's worth of ore in a few months; only to see those estimates completely blown out of the water when things went live. I wish I could remember the source!
---
I think the fit that Suitonia and Squishy use are the current common ones: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76693462/
---
Check out Suitonia's twitch. he has some good solo fun in Delve.
---
Or any other animal...like say a Narwhale...wasnt there a corp or alliance
---
Just bring something shiny, and if you could bring some nano paste with you, i need some
---
you cannot clear an entire gas site with one venture unless you have someone to come in an clear the rats in 15 minutes after you warp in.   
---
the question is: how much can you huff in 15 minutes and the answer is about 1500 m3 of gas with alpha skills (unless i've overestimated something).  
---
Finding the best gas (which currently is c320) will give you about 18m/15 min in a venture in this case.
---
Market is already so over saturated in t1 bpc's though.
---
You're either a troll or you're as informed about eve as my 8 yo nephew who never played. Check history, man
---
Not really gonna happen ... i cannot really imagine any solo Battleship beeing able to kill his Trig-Ships. Even Gulnar would be a sad panda with his Sin against that Leshak.
---
Just bring ramjags lol. It pretty much a hard kiki counter.
---
you can find some info here -  [https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/wiki/ded-sites](https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/wiki/ded-sites)    
---
not straight up (which is the eve way) but you can examine those fits and see what they provide in terms of tank/dps.
---
Im suprised that this isnt brought up at all anymore when talking about GoonsNBlus
---
But he didn't even turn it on.  If he had, he would have at least gotten KB ticks for all the NullSechnayas dying around him.
---
Yes, characters that are still docked *and* logged in fall out into space when the citadel dies.
---
Normally fairly rare, as logoff in structures is instant, regardless of any timers you may or may not have, but happens sometimes, usually when people go afk without realizing that the timer will be soon.
---
The ewarp from having been logged off in a now dead structure places you where that structure used to be, but that is scoutable and people won't camp it for long (if at all) unless something exceptionally valueable used to be there.
---
Joyeux cake day
---
Well - I was specifically saying that in reference to the FC keeping it together and not getting overwhelmed.  Sure, some mistakes were made (in my opinion, anyway), but he reacted well through the whole thing.  
---
Shit happens - especially when you're outnumbered like that.
---
Nope
---
Horde is currently deployed. You can temporarily join them and be a part of their numbers. That gives you a head start in learning the region.
---
Pax Sex does what you want to do. True solo in small ships in Delve. His twitch channel is called "anarckos" if i'm not mistaken.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/249261834/
---
It's wartime Delve so you won't find a lot of miners and ratters. Since the umbrella is gone, Goons often give goodfights in Delve now. You can find bees willing to fight you 1v1 etc.
---
thats a shit tool tbh
---
How come?
---
Can't speak for what is going on with TEST and INIT, but I can guarantee you that one subcap fleet getting whelped is hardly "squashing the invasion."
---
Meh. Roamed through Delve the other day and it was dead as fuck, guess the krabs don't login without at least 5 titans on standby.
---
Lol we'd hope so. But solo titans completely docked after we killed 2 of them in the first day of deployment.
---
Get in an Astero and roam WH space. Hack relics and kill explorers. Good times.
---
He must have felt guilty
---
Removing local doesn't destroy anything except no-brain krabbing, and it would make small gang hunting and counter-hunting with subcap defence fleets feasible, which would be a big net gain.
---
I would say they are both relevant in their own way.  But yeah, run out of either and you will bleed people to the point of becoming immobilized.
---
Fortunately we have an abundance of both, and whelping one subcap fleet won't even scratch either the morale levels or the isk levels.
---
2) depends on how much stuff you need to move. An instawarp shield-tanked astero can bypass 99% of gatecamps and has a reasonable cargo hold to carry your most precious modules &amp;loot.
---
No one lives in NPC null other than a few select people for PVP reasons. This is not because NPC null sucks but because there is no reason for group A, B or C to leave their farmville corner of space where they are able to stay 100% safe.
---
If you forced people to expand and break away from their massive force projection safety blanket by reducing the available resources per system, larger groups would become more vulnerable and more small groups would form and less desirable areas (such as NPC NS or LS) would become more populated.
---
Why do you think WHs are dead and null is thriving? It's because people prefer to compensate for reduced income with quality of life in the form of complete safety and low effort.
---
^^^^
---
Not quite true on either - but it's ok, NC needs the morale boost more than we do :D
---
I agree with your first 2 points . But first point i don't think ccp will do anytime soon. Removing burner missions is a massive concern as they can be done in frigates and easy to navigate through null . I think when ccp decides to remake all the missions they will be done ... I am not sure about the industry part ccp wants sov  null to be end game/best . I would prefer more ways to interact with NPCs because it being NPC space than just making NPC null look like a tonned down version of sov null or lowsec . PI is a good option . But PI/Custom offices in itself does not create any content. The reason again is that ccp wants Sov null to be the best ingame that they wont increase PI in NPC null any better . which is why my ideas are more towards interaction NPCs than making it compete with sov null
---
it only matters if you make a big deal out of it lol
---
because its bad intel. 
---
You should be scouting that gate anyways. A gatecamp could just be starting, or the one the tool gave you could just be ending. Eve servers can fuck up and use extremely long time to register killls (or zkill/gatecheck could be fucking up), or the campers and their targets could not be api registered on zkill, this is normal for ganking groups. 
---
It doesn't really give you any intel on what camp it is either, a smartbomber isn't really a problem for anything with tank. 
---
Its not worthless, its just not good enough to remove the need for a scout, and it can be replaced by dotlan/zkill or your in game map
---
I wish more people would come kill my dumb coalition members.
---
This will burn quite fast. Remember that Trig cruiser was not so good ships after all.
---
Well yeah i agree with above. Its not perfect. But its low effort. Guess value of cargo decides scouting method.
---
Ok the whole reason why to remove frigate burner mission is due to 2 facts :             
---
* they generate insane LP numbers           
---
* they can be done in frigates         
---
This means that small group of people totally not related to area can generate huge number or LP in a very short amount of time on a daily basis.    
---
Those people can use very cheap ships if they utilize a lot of frigate chars.           
---
This leads to fact that farmers can easily kill income for a whole LP store, thus removing this income from people that actually live in the area on the main characters.            
---
Without burner missions by living in the area you can control who is running missions, also those 10 guys running burners, logging on 1AM for you cannot kill the value of LP store.
---
This is funny coming from ex culture
---
Lol I like it when Goons compare my booshing to their krab.
---
1) My booshing is an emergent mechanic which took a great deal of creativity and innovation to develop, and now takes a good amount of gaming skill to conduct. Only few people managed to replicate it despite my transparency. Your krabbing can be done by a 4 year old with semi-developed motor skills.
---
2) My booshing is essentially PvP. It's conducted against many people hunting me, lots of supers on grid trying to save drones, people camping gates, bosoning with titans. Your Delve krabbing is the activity with one of the lowest ratio of PvP interaction possibility across all New Eden.
---
3) The money I make from booshing is reinvested into more pontifexes or suicide dreads to feed to players of Eve (mostly Goons). The money your folk make is invested into titans which never have a real use outside the safety of your umbrella.
---
4) Risk/reward essentially applies to PvE in this game. The higher reward a region is (in terms of PvE reward), the riskier it is supposed to be by game design. You can't apply the same concept to people making money from other means, to blops hunters, to wormhole evictors, to citadel thieves, to corp thieves, and to drone booshers. By choosing to interact with you, they are already taking risks. It's up to you to make the activity risky and unworthy.
---
You can gtfo with your comparison.
---
I think he was referring to a bug where the tiamat couldn't take a covert bridge. I don't know if the issue has been fixed since though. It has been a while so I guess it has.
---
Just use a shipping service to move your stuff
---
Atleast they move ... right now the problem is no one is there. Which is my whole point and i am addressing a completely different aspect of the game . In sov null PVE and Mining act as 2 different forms of income . By linking LP /isk to mining contracts the 2 activties become linked and this can be only dont in NPC /low sec space. while in sov null while the profit might not be as good as sov null it will be a lot easier than sov null . Again you should understand its ccp's intent to make sov null look like end game. I dont not want to go remove their ideas of that. I have less knowledge of wormholes so i wont comment on it .
---
Please explain.
---
Drinks on Dunlop boys!
---
And that's why we have more then half a year of supply lines up. I myself have 600 ship bpc's sitting in a can unused and I don't even run abyssals that much.
---
I know that ways to generate LP and FW plexes in lowsec to generate LP is not what i am discussing about thought . I am just discussing about how to use this LP that just crash the very small market they have and how they can be diversified into other markets as Loyalty towards an NPC corp should mean something like loyalty towards a null space alliance .
---
Wait... Is that an accurate map? I mean, if someone controls F5-FDA, they effectively locked down 9 systems?
---
It must flow

You're making the right choice.

They are not pretty fucking good, dont tell people that lol.

UKoC best koc! - Sappo

If you remember my name (I’m on phone and this name I don’t recognise off the top of my head, it’s been a while...), drop me a line in game :)
---
Were you one of us that moved to UNSEC?
---
Hey thanks!
---
Well yes, but then 600 bpc that is put in invention give you 300 T2BPC that require a lot of T1 BPC on top.          
---
Like i am saying if materials will drop enough, T1 BPC will burn as people will actually fly those ships in opposite to the current T1 Cruiser.
---
&gt;I am also interested what those incursions will be drop.
---
Triglavian Sealed Crate, a mysterious box that seems to require a key that's made from pure PLEX to open it without destroying everything inside.
---
Yeah I wouldn’t be sure about that
---
Oooh both?:0
---
Would a Sin be appropriate for hunting in Delve. It’s quite pricey but I am considering it also if the risk - reward is acceptable.
---
Anyone else get to the end of the title and go huh? And then realize CD wasn’t command destroyer and check you’re still in r/eve.
---
Wish you were a little slower (like a snail!) earlier today OP, could've been a nice dunk :p
---
Started playing at 16
---
Never used comms untill my corps first meeting
---
I expressed my feelings about leadership decisions (moving newbeans from highsec to wormhole space when we were clearly undereducated and unprepared)
---
Leadership didn't listen, most members including directors agreed with me
---
I told leadership to suck it and left. 2 hours later I get convo's from ex corp members... who also left corp after me.
---
We started a small shitty highsec mining corp that didnt last very long and an ex director helped by joining us with an orca alt.
---
Point is that it doesn't matter how old you are or where you're from. Just be understandable and know how to speak in general and you should have no issues.
---
Delve ain't drone region
---
Not Snuff
---
Age is something people use as an excuse to dismiss someone else's experiences as less important than their own.  
---
Most of the EVE player base would like to think we are above that type of pettiness explained in the previous sentence.
---
Rap battle - select your champion and step into public comms
---
Oh okay, so you're just speaking out of your ass as  a simple line nerd
---
the other shoe was left, along with the suit jacket
---
Lol sorry I had so many goons complaining about my risk averse grabbing activities in delve.
---
They just need to be seasoned well and cooked right. In China there's a few different ways to spice them that I know of if you're not a fan of garlic butter.
---
Yeah but who are you again?
---
I'm not sure where you get your intel but I'm startng to get why there are no opposition most of the time.
---
I've not seen anyone complain, really. Maybe the people who you affect do but the general attitude is that it's their own fault. Krabs are content generators though, they probably keep a lot of people interested in the game whether that's people trying to kill them or people trying to save them.
---
wait what? Even the Goons of today won't go as far as saying they're the Good guys.
---
Just a question... Does that works with WH ?
---
Like let's say im in my C2-C5/NS czn I see the sigs of my C5 and NS static ?
---
If so its just sad....
---
:) they use different booster slots, and the 50% is dirt cheap
---
If you want to fight in lowsec, you usually fight in faction warfare complexes. They limit the ship size you can fly in, but the most common solo fights you will get are with frigates, so that's good with your Astero. Otherwise, nothing stops someone from dunking your little Astero with a T1 cruiser, no matter how much bling you fit.
---
I suggest you do what is usually suggested for learning lowsec pvp: get a bunch of T1 frigates and fit them with T2 modules. It'll cost you roughly 10 mil per frigate (I suggest the Tristan, since it can be fit in almost all engagement profiles). Go to a novice complex in a contested system and start taking all of the fights. Learn what you can engage and can't.
---
The Astero isn't a great frigate for lowsec pvp, it's just a pretty good frigate for ganking other explorers while exploring yourself. You will probably beat any T1 frigate that doesn't flee from you, but any pirate frigate will outdamage your reps and you won't be able to kill it in time (the Astero has a pretty poor dps).
---
Surely your IQ is not low enough to search for a tutorial on YouTube..
---
Xtra Squishy approved
---
They wouldn't need more people if they had more allies.
---
Looks like a rage quit to me
---
dont worry I'm 30 and no one likes me
---
No, not really.  Snuff is the height of irrelevance.  Though they try to act big and tough, and certainly get kills, they do not sway the Meta in any direction.  They don't know what side they are on, and the leadership of Snuff is rapidly losing touch with their members as Penifsmash takes a larger role in what goes on, which, is actually quite bad for Snuffed Out in the long term.  I understand you may not know what goes on in Eve, but many of us do ;)
---
You could try making the item and selling it. After Industry V, most blueprints only require a short train to use.
---
What do you call it?
---
Instead of making a counterpoint for everything and wasting my time on some pubbie im just gonna say "lol"
---
That is because you have no counterpoint.  You have put forth nothing, because you have nothing.
---
I guess you conveniently forgot that Hakonen deployment that got stopped after about a week or two of getting turbodunked by NCPL.
---
Honestly, there are countless examples of Goon Mainfleet giving up on an invasion after losing a couple of battles.
---
Not that I think that will happen this time around. Your leadership has too much invested.
---
Appreciate it dude.
---
let’s face it. It took 2 maxed fleets of muninns to get nc. to undock to fight the initial 200 baltecs.
---
Tribute is burning, their list of “allies” are shrinking. Won’t be long before NPCL. Retirement home in lowsec becomes a reality now.
---
&gt; Fight continues until both sides extract
---
Nope, munins ran away and we went on to reinforce more things. We held the field and completed all of our objectives.
---
600 haha, guess again
---
It all depends on the wormhole as some have shod boosts and others armor boosts so depending on the hole to how you would fit one
---
Why you say that his killboard is mainly green lol
---
Ohh lol just logged off after a loss and never returned
---
Pmed you
---
Your bread and butter is:
---
1. Warp in at 50km. Spiral in by manual piloting, then orbit.
---
2. Wait inside a FW Plex 30km away from the warp in.
---
Proper positioning is key to success.
---
Crystalline Isogen Must Flow

Well I don’t loose as much sleep playing eve than when playing factorio
---
I'd really like to know what the north has, most of NCdot is veteran players so they ought to have the assets and income capable of being converted into titans, especially since the last war shows that they'll see use.
---
I do not fully get how removing burners that are a huge part of Income for people living in Lowsec like me should help? Do you want to force me to put even more hours into PvE grind than Lifeblood already did?
---
Yes

Well it works but you need to use some expensive modules.
---
Yes it is accurate.
---
The easiest way is to use a mapping program such as Tripwire. Hoewever, you can always look up the jcode at anoik.is to find the information by hand.
---
this is how I play minecraft. I spend about a week putting up automated quarries and sorting systems to quarry and sort all the resources in a 1000x1000 area down to bedrock, then I put soil over the bedrock so there's grass, and then I don't know what to build in my crater (I always imagine a nice town that spans up the sides and the entire middle bit). So I plant some trees and quit until I fire it up 6 months later and start a new world and repeat the process.
---
Provi-Bloc.
---
I don't know, maybe it's just me, but it looks really strange to see it spelled out like that. "Providence Bloc". Just feels weird. Like somebody unnecessarily calling you by your full name, and pronouncing it wrong :P
---
Please share more useless information. The fact of the matter still stands, your egotistical. The whole of your alliance is now made up of people who can't properly understand English so you can spin it how you like and they just become F1 monkeys for you. How many thousands of real money is it going to take for you to understand you won't fit in anywhere in null since your ego has pissed off just about everyone. Eventually you wont be able to wallet warrior your way out of something. Its only a matter of time before the north burns you next then where will you go?
---
Those days also made wh corps the most paranoid in the eve so no newbie would be recruited anyway.
---
NJED is always looking for more people!
---
&gt;They just need to be seasoned well and cooked right.
---
i can say this about pretty much everything
---
I am saying about NPC nullsec.      
---
NPC nullsec LP stores are quite limited, most of the time those are just implants, on rare ocassion ship BPC (aka guristas gilas or worms - as they are OP).      
---
But in most of the cases it is just implants.         
---
Burners let people from other areas of space farm LP without brining anything value to the area.     
---
If we want to fix NPC space we need to start with this ...
---
Nope. No one can interact with your stuff until it is in your hold and you are trying to get back to a market. You just need to find somewhere with ok tax. 
---
The new agency system coming out tomorrow will give you a lot more information on the different planets in a system.
---
Just train for a Gallente hauler, the epithal has a big hold just for PI materials. Cloak and Microwarpdrive. Dodge in and out.
---
You can look up a 20 day or so training plan that will include the skills for the Gallente transport ship, which each alt will need. 
---
Then as long as you are plexed for the account you get three characters worth of PI
---
This is actually good advice because nobody talks in their alliance chat so you won't immediately catch cancer. Just for the love of your sanity never join their actual chat channel.
---
If you let my Lowsec burners live, I am fine with that
---
Mata here, 
---
Not mad at you. Please focus on school. But if you decide to come back you know where to find me so we can talk :). Always had good talks with you in the past.
---
I wish you ther best of luck o7.
---
I’m a pretty good shitposter there, too.
---
I am hoping for it. I imagine we will see, at least, an initial spike as people begin researching and building the new T2 ships, but depending on the drop rate of the mats will determine if the spike sustains.
---
Goddamnit I’m so glad you saw this. I give my most sincere apologies, but first thing when I get back online I’ll be talking to you.
---
This isn’t a shitpost, this is a trash post
---
Yeah, I ran a tengu in C3s for a bit. While it ran it much easier than a gila, it is a much juicier target than that gila.
---
to be fair, some manchildren in eve act like they're 6
---
I'm pretty much repeating the same things but you're age is not an issue in the eyes of anyone else.  Eve is a global game and many players (my corp included) speak English as a second or third language.  The diversity is part of what makes this game great.  
---
It sounds like the only obstacle you have is your own confidence (which is a good thing because it is within your power to step outside of your comfort zone if you want).  One thing that may help is talking to individual corp members privately at first to ask questions without an audience to build up your confidence.  As long as you have a positive attitude, people will be happy to help and work with you.  If they don't, that says something about the corp, not you.

Thx, it looks usefull.
---
Indeed it is also safe to use scout (but as a solo player for the moment, it will be hard)
---
What fit did you use?
---
IQ is negatively correlated with ship mass
---
Yes, please come and visit us. We are expecting you...
---
Yes to all of this.
---
I am at work right now, but can get you my fit when I get home. If I recall correctly it ran about 1.4 bill.
---
it seems it is better than nothing or a very expensive shipping service contract.
---
As a conclusion : scouting is the best option, but probably not available for me at the moment.
---
Yan here, hope you ok m8...take care and dont be afraid to hit up old buddies if you get back :)

Best of luck m8

Sup man thanks a lot I will :D

Damn these EVE players ...

so CCP said "We gonna force them to actively mine the Moons now ... no more inactive, afk DST-Piloting on autopilot in Lowsec to empty those passive moons (Thats how Hilmar thought it worked from his elaborate 2003 playing expertise)".
---
EVE-Krab-Players "Hold my beer, brb writing some bots!" - coming back with NEAR2, TACO and now discord bots that read out the mining anoms and warn you of signature spawns in range to protect them from those scary wormhole people. Also helps in tabbing that engaging active gameplay out to concentrate on Netflix ....

A new version has been released. It now supports removing of timers, listing all timers and filtering timers down by different categories or system. Let me know if you think of anything else.
---
Ok...since you aren't giving anything away...wouldja take say..100 quatloos for the whole kit and kaboodle? Oops..wrong universe..not quatloos...wouldja take 100 iskies?
---
Holy shit you are dumb.  Seems your hate boner for the Indian god of Love, Penif, is effecting your cognitive functions.
---
Thank god ive stocked up on mats specially crystalline isogen, got over 200k that I’ve bought over the time for 160k-190k a pop, I’ll be fine even if they spike haha
---
I will look into this. It's an interesting idea and I do see how it could be useful. I released a new version that does support filtering by system for active timers.
---
Sounds like a threat. I already like it!
---
Lowsec LP stores work differently than nullsec ones.
---
Thank you! 1.4b is a little expensive though, is there any bling that can be downgraded a little?
---
But it is, unless you're implying that you had to bring more than 500 people to reinforce your baltec fleet.
---
How can we turn into french, so we can inside that guild?
---
You are making the right choice for sure!!!   
---
You earn by what you learn...  and self-discipline is a key life skill.
---
Eve will still be around when you are ready....
---
See ya later. I've had to do the same thing a few times. Eve is addictive and whenever I have something important to focus on I delete Eve, leave and associated social media and try and cut it completely out.
---
Have you been doing the SOE arc every 3 months? If not, do it with a 75% booster. I think the arc gives a lot of soe standings.
---
if there were, he probably wouldn't have it on the fit

Yeah, someone who got ganked with injectors in cargo and kept playing is totally gonna walk away because of a dictor loss. ^/s

It's crazy how stupid these people are being. Global warming is happening without a doubt. Tornadoes in tornado alley in may.... is not evidence of anything. It's really frustrating to be surrounded by idiots, but only like 17% of the population has an IQ over 110.
---
I kinda like it. I payed some iskies for 90 days of Premium and I can see what ships and groups were involved.
---
So... good luck I guess? Learn to balance games and responsability maybe?
---
Not sure why you posted this on reddit instead of sending a mail or something more personal to the people that actually care.
---
It would be cool, not just your charter bit see other people too, like the "trade hubs" of Warframe.
---
Oh relax already. Eve has gone through this cycle multiple times in the past, and it will probably go through it again in the future. We're not Serenity, we have different rivalries and grudges and geopolitical circumstances than they did.
---
Our current political situation is being driven by NCPL. Goons were allowed to rebuild because of their failure to follow through. Legacy formed as a counter to them. Imperial Legacy formed because of their poorly thought-out attack on the south. The common tie that binds us together is NCPL more than anything else. They're the external enemy that motivates us to work together. What do you think is going to happen if they become a non-factor? Do you really think Goons and Legacy, as the last two remaining super powers, won't eventually come into conflict? Sure, we'll probably get our shit kicked in, if we stand alone, but either way it shakes out it would create more people open to fighting the Imperium (and less allies for them to call on).
---
And all of that is ignoring the most interesting wild card of 2019 -- the rise of the Chinese-based alliances. Fraternity and the Army of Mango have the potential to radically (and quickly) reshape nullsec politics in the coming years.
---
You would be surprised at what people can accomplish in this game.  For instance, I'm surprised that you can string a few sentences together.  Wow, you looked up my corp history.  Yet you have failed to look at what I do in this game.  Due to the fact I'm obviously conversing with a fool, I bid you adieu and farewell.
---
I wouldn't say that. With enough neutingpower (or ECM from a secondary source) a Trig ships lose the ramp up over and over again and then it is tankable. I think we can safely assume that the Bhaalgorn seen in the video is not in the same pricerange as his Leshak.
---
Any "normal" solo Battleship would just die way before that is a possibility tho you are right. Adding to that iBeast is probably a way better pilot than whoever he is fighting.
---
You honestly believe Penif is good for Snuff?  You are an idiot.
---
Finally i have been waiting for this news on Sunday for weeks now.
---
We have a couple of guys in our corp that started playing and FCing as kids, now they are adult and kind of space famous
---
It was just a joke brother calm down
---
Also make sure u use the proper scanning ship (like Probe, Magnate, Heron or its T2 variants, possible Astero...)
---
And skill up the corresponding frigate skills as they give you better scan probe strength.
---
Can you elaborate on the advantages of having low powered raitarus spread around?

cool, see you in a month.

I heard Horde was being Hazed by NSH in Goons, something about 10 guys locking down 50?

You've must have mined your brain into nothing if you think that it would have been smart for us to escalate.  My guess is you are just butt hurt that we dont spoon feed you fleets.  My hope you are meme'ing and not that dense to see why it would have been a bad idea to escalate.

may the bots generate isk in peace now in pure blind ))

&gt;[...] The main change here is the visibility of the number of available signatures in all systems. [...] We are aware of the implications of this change and will monitor the effect on New Eden and the Exploration career, with the possibility of balancing and tweaking in the future.

Just gonna leave [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bo4zed/i_was_on_eves_csm8_i_was_spacefamous_for_a_long/encyfnk/?context=10000) from Jester's recent AMA here:
---
&gt;"This will be iterated upon."
---
&gt;Can't count the number of times CSM 8 was told that. Five years later, literally nothing we were told this about has been iterated upon.
---
We're running a 5k to raise awareness.
---
its not about the stats its a measure of whether you won or lost the fight... i guess if you dont care about being good and winning well thats a different type of player.
---
Lol.  I think I went with a blinged amp over a tp, since I would clear some sites in our c4, and I went with faction BCS.
---
So I could probably shave off 300-400 mill.

for a second there i thought i was in the hell dump section instead of reddit

Oh. Yeah, Provi-Block does sound better,  but I always assumed it to be short for the full name.

Stop lieing, you're leaving to play classic wow.

they should ~~go~~ come to war more often.

I mean I guess he DOES know what its like when other FC's in his coalition cant even be bothered.
---
Later in the chain here he says that it's "just reddit".
---
Then deletes his account because he can't take the bantz. Hah!
---
Aye, you basically have no 5-run-bpcs in NPC-Nullsec, am I right?
---
I'm amazed they're still unironically telling us "Don't worry we'll iterate on it" despite their 15 year track record of never iterating on anything.
---
17 minutes per site. Any longer and sleepers show up
---
I used to live here, it was a great pocket. Having jump bridges in RNM and V-K would let you "jump behind" and trap in anyone who came to your pocket
---
Well the bots to abuse this for even safer "resource collection" (aka krabbing) are already written and announced in this sub -.- ....
---
Word. That was fun.
---
Must be pretty funny to see.
---
My Kiki can reach out to 80km with meson with strong Frentix and my bifrost giving remote boosts. So I'm sure I can get the draugr out pretty far too. And it will sig tank a lot better with the mwd reduction.
---
Lmao fuck exploration right
---
There are a variety of wormhole corps that operate in a variety of different ways. I would recommend talking with the recruiters from several. Keep in mind that wormhole corps are a lot more tight-knit than most nullsec corporations, so you're looking not just for a vehicle that will provide you with a base to solo wander from, but a community you will need to become a part of.
---
Note that what you've written so far isn't exactly a strong recommendation, but I suspect that's more about the way you wrote it than the thought behind it. You've separated "hunting" and "cov-opsy stuff" from "PVP", which is going to get you a lot of strange looks from most wormholers.
---
\*Franchouillardise s'intensifie\*
---
Ouvrez les oeils !
---
Isn’t this an example of them iterating on something?
---
I will never understand CCP’s insistence in pushing “features” that nobody asked for, and that everyone says they don’t want.
---
The only thing that they iterate on is stuff that affects new player sign ups.
---
What’s wrong with that?
---
It could be, if the new agency resembled the old one in any way.
---
Just go kill excavators in something cheap, quick warping, and with a shitload of dps.
---
Why is so much time invested in that agency? It's the first thing I disable on all my accounts and never have missed anything.
---
Is it actually a big deal for many players?
---
I’ve been an olmeca victim.  Do I get salty about it, sure, but salt is a big part of the game.  Like you said, if it was easy, there’d be tons of guys doing it.
---
It means that they hemorrhage old players as an expense, while continuing to not understand what keeps new people in the game. 
---
What little advertisement they have done is trying to explain how Eve is just another generic MMO but with spaceships, so won’t you please have pity on our game and give it a try. Look we even made it free to play. Oh, we’re doing a special event, give it a try and get a booster pack to get you caught up with the level 90 Mages. You don’t know what to do? Here’s a cool tool that we’ve been working on that tells you exactly what to do, the moment you log in.
---
And thus, the wonder is lost. The free form sandbox becomes another theme park. And the game is dumped en masse for the next flavor of the month MMO.
---
lol. I wish
---
So what should they do instead?
---
Of course, you would destroy Nullsec-PvE for small ships and small alliances even more.
---
1) Subcap PvE ships will just melt if you drop just a small fleet on them, no chance for defenders to get in. Well, maybe if they are already formed up and sit in the same system. Consequence: More caps are used since they can stand to a PVP fleet at least for a while
---
2) With the Intel-situation basically reversed from what it is now, you either need to position scouts on the gates or you just depend on your cap-umbrella to rescue your PvE-caps. Both of these are things that work better for large coalitions that just have more people on standby. You could also say that the gate-watching is super boring for a human but actually really easy for a bot to do.
---
Drop your sin on orcas I heard that works well..
---
You aren't the target demographic. CCP wants to recruit a more casual player base to sustain the game.
---
Flew twice with a 15 year old FC last night.  Both times I came away with the opinion that “this guy has his shit together”.  Decided that I’ll be going on any fleet I can with him.  Attitude and competence.  Age is just a number.
---
looks great!
---
Hello
---
1 run.    
---
For most of the NPC null LP stores quite often you are negative when trying to get BPC.
---
Let their base continue to do the recruiting, like always. Word of mouth is how damn near 70% of the people in this game came to play it (outside of the first generation).
---
They should dump their advertising budget into making exciting trailers that showcase things that actually happened in the game, or things that resemble things that actually happened in the game.
---
The main problem, right now, is that it appears that CCP (collectively) finds out about big events from reading polygon/kotaku/pcgamer, and not from actually flying around in their little Polaris frigates. I’m sure this is not actually the truth. How could it be? But that’s what it feels like. The decisions that they make appear to be driven by middle managers, and not the devs.

Cyno nerfs would help people hunting ratters more then it would help well people ratting. 
---
Sure you can no longer blops that sucks ( i'm assuming you include the covert cyno in full delete ), but you can also no longer cyno in your friends to safe you so really once your rorq is tackled unless your friends are in system there is a fair shot to kill it.

you can't just press 2 buttons and well have faxes there to safe you.
---
I've never known people to be intolerant of players on comms.
---
I've never known a player to be kicked because of their age.
---
I have known some young players that were frickin' amazing.
---
Heck, there is a series of videos of a 4 year-old girl PvP better than me.
---
Do you think the officer equipment helped?
---
Hordlings process it like this: Content at undock? *Proceeds to undock, get whelped* *let me try this in another ship* *Welps* after several Welps, an FC sighs, proceeds to ping and busts the camp.
---
Win win for hordlings either way.
---
Don’t be afraid to make mistakes with English, it’s a screwed up language.  Practice is the key.
---
Yeah I am sure people will walk away in DROVES over something little as having visible signatures 2-3 jumps away. Oh god the horror. 
---
Something something the vocal minority.
---
if goon goal is to kill as much NC assets as they can and NC goal is to save as much they can .... who won and who lost :D
---
CCP probably think of it as really important for new players. Probably not as useless for missions maybe but who on hell use it for anomalies ?
---
Do it bro, they offered coz of your cool attitude! No salt, just good fun had by all involved.
---
Keep this attitude and you will go far in this game.
---
What was the name of the corp by the way?
---
Extracted from game files. Lossless upload via reddit.
---
Previous expansions: [Abyss, Lifeblood, Onslaught](https://ibb.co/album/kNK63v)
---
Nobody asked about a several dozen things that kinda turned out okay. Because 99% here does not even have the creative mind to come up with something like, oh the trig sites and complete racial shipline with an entire new weapon system to go? 
---
It is not like you are going to scrape 4.000 manhours because there a handfull of crybabies on reddit about it.
---
If you don't know what something is about ... it is about how to get more money from you.          
---
This old saying kind of always checks out.
---
It will indeed ;) It was "do I press the broadcast another time" close!
---
In defence of some of this:
---
Eve has had one of the worst information dearths of any game going. A lot of information is pointlessly inscrutable, and mostly available through voluntary player run initiatives. Getting some of that information into the client is no bad thing. 
---
But please. Don't put cosmic signatures in. That's so antithetical to the way they work that I cannot believe ccp are considering this. Don't give us this "we're monitoring it" crap, if you think it's an improvement then explain why. Because "we think it might work" does not inspire confidence.

the easiest way to make a fit is to look up the dps and incoming neuts for each anomaly and make sure your fit can sustain that, this site has all the needed data [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#)

Hey Capsuleers! Check out the latest version of the worst 'improvement' to the UI in EVE's history! It's even bigger and more useless/unnecessary than ever! Now it literally takes up THE ENTIRE SCREEN! It's BIG, It's BEAUTIFUL; we may even rename it THE UI WALL!!
---
I am 95% convinced CCP is TRYING to derail/end this abomination of a game.
---
Now you have to in order to compete.
---
putting all your eggs in one basket is never a wise idea. Trying to diversify was the correct decision, sadly dust didn't work out for them. Eve valkyrie is a good game, but it didn't take off either.
---
And i thought i was doing well saving up 45k from sites :(
---
To compete against who to do what ? I have yet to understand how catastrophique this all is.
---
I just PMed you - we do small gang pvp and are new bro friendly if you can fly tackle :)
---
I love how they're still touting one of the dumbest decisions ever as a COOL FEATURE.
---
because back then there were two dominant groups, now there are one
---
I wasn’t saying that people would leave because of this change. People are leaving because playstyles are being killed off in favor of krabs, but mostly because the game is not being maintained. Old bugs are still not being fixed. Old broken features are still not being “iterated upon”. And you’ve got to do all these things to grease to wheels to keep the older generation of players, some of whom will be gone, anyway, because this is the natural progression of things.
---
Content creation takes so much out of you, over the years. People burn out. But sometimes they come back, because hotel california.
---
All that CCP can do is try not to drive them away any more than usual.
---
I understand that they’re in an unenviable position. Keeping a game going for coming on two decades is... a feat, itself. Most games are dead and forgotten, by this point.
---

---
Every time they iterate on the New Player Experience, they throw out every (good and bad) they did on it before.  Most of the time the iteration isn't even any better than the previous, just different.  If the amount of time they wasted making side-changes to the NPE was actually invested in something that would last more than 3 months, EVE would be better.
---
The best part of this genius change is that EVERY relic site is now going to have a cloaky hunter sitting in it, instead of just some.
---
C'est une conspiration, une conspiration ! On en a gros ! \^\^
---
&gt; Loki 
---
FTFY
---
It's fake.
---
This may be truer than you realize.  Some of the decisions that come out of this company are so hilariously retarded that the only logical explanation is that they don't even play or watch us play.  The other alternative is that they're horribly incompetent, so I'm not sure which is worse.
---
Just dont run the site then, find another.
---
That might be possible, but they can’t have both. The sandbox requires hardcore players to make shit happen. There have always been casuals, but if CCP continues such a line of planning, the game will be vastly different in the next decade, and incompatible with many of the people that are presently here. Not all, just a large number.
---
That said, I’m not sure that I agree with your initial theory. I still don’t see *any* cohesive plan, from CCP.
---
I have a theory that Himlar's niece designed the agency, so they have to keep pushing it no matter how shitty it is.  Only thing that makes sense.
---
Un oeil, des n'oeils. \^\^
---
Maybe that is is why they are making this change, since they can't fix the relic bots, they did this?
---
The Abyssmal shit has been the single biggest waste of dev time in the last couple years.  Instanced content in EVE is about the last thing the game needs, and further destroys the sandbox.
---
Don't worry guys Hilmar is really "in touch"  with the game
---
C6 best life
---
Or probably just as importantly, have all the content available in one place easily accessible for new players.
---
While conveniently forgetting that there wasn't a supercap fleet presence on our (Goon) side in Hakonen, so NC. and PL were dropping theirs on us at will.
---
Been living in GW for over a year. I've never seen that before and now I can't stop seeing it.
---
Vive le escargot
---
No
---
It's unbelievable that they're ploughing ahead with this when the responses are 90% (being charitable) negative. Their stated reason doesn't even make sense, and if it did, all they need to do is show stuff one jump away, not anywhere in space.
---
This sort of stupidity is why I don't believe the stuff Hilmar said in that interview is actually true. If anyone at CCP knew anything about how people - even new players, for exploration - played their game, they wouldn't push this change.
---
I think I started playing around 13 years old with a high sec corp full of eastern Europeans, they didn't give a shit and I had a great time
---
Less funny to experience. 
---
Most expensive shit I ever took.
---
structures are there to burn out attacking forces
---
Sadly I have terrible minmatar skills on the chat I'm doing this with
---
l would love the Abyss one with a glia or a cheeky Legion for the ship lol
---
for sure putting an alt in horde and let them freight your stuff will be the easiest. That or buy things in npc delve and haul the fits through thera. But i would strongly suggest to start learning how to fly solo in fw.
---
You can easily make a T3C that can do C2, but it's a shiny killmail waiting to happen. A typical mid range active tanked one should be ok in a C3, but a shiny Gila or a passive Rattlesnake is probably a more cost effective option. It's hard to get a good range and DPS on a tengu, and HAMs don't apply well to sleeper frigates.
---
Reprocess or making a hauling contract out to a trade hub.
---
I need to sell my stock of krabitals, i agree with the post above. but at the same time I am a dumb member at times....eheh. shit...
---
If you type in the name of the system in google, you'll get a site that gives you the class of the system + the effects that apply oj it.
---
Yeah here's one idea for you https://i.imgur.com/UOG6NUz.jpg
---
wow, dark..
---
. "keep the older generation of players, some of whom will be gone, anyway, "
---
i mean you are not wrong, but god damn dude..
---
Right click, trash it
---
I want to focus on combat, do I need to learn exploration and other stuff? I've been playing for a couple of months
---
But it is a pain in the ass for a new player, especially when ninja huffing, explo, and nullsec salvaging are also real profitable and have a couple hours of skills to do it well.
---
That was a super fun fight for the POV of a bomber...IMP FC did a pretty admirable job staying bubbled and spread out after the first few runs...10/10 would bomb again...
---
The color "green" does not exist in the bleak future of EVE Online.
---
I feel ambivalent towards this change. Maybe someone could enlighten me as to why this is the killing blow to the game everyone keeps going on about it being?
---
I’ve come to accept the reprocess into minerals as a great outcome.  All the rat shit you get running vni sites is my mess.  Pull out meta mods for doctrine fits and anything of real value and then reprocess the rest.   I actually use minerals and it wouldn’t go completely to waste.
---
I’m not talking about death. I’m talking about getting married. Having kids. Taking on more responsibilities at work. Or just realizing that if you had put the kind of effort into $thing that you had put into Eve, you would have had $reward by now. And/or realizing that the sunk-cost fallacy that keeps so many of us here, is real, but also a lie.
---
As someone who has been on both sides of this, these situations are my fondest memories of null.
---
Its not a killing blow. Its just a baby step in the wrong direction and there is no legitimate reason for it.
---
TIL being a recruiting officer in *Karmafleet* is the pinnacle of Eve.
---
"There is no reason for it" is not a reason against it. This is why i have asked.
---
Where in the game files (path) ? Oh and ty!
---
Dude has been on **THREE** killmails with his supercapital man - you better show some fuckin RESPECT
---
The reason against it is that it provides another means of free intel to major blocs who are already safe enough, as it is.
---
The agency may in fact be the first thing they've ever iterated on... and by iterated I mean completely redesigned to be more annoying over and over.
---
Congrats, 27 people killed 2, way to shit up Reddit.
---
do exploration in t1 frig for money. Only train relic skills and do relic sites, out in null.
---
Oui oui
---
/u/Jibrish can we update the subreddit header with this, it would be so cool
---
Looks like I can explore without undocking. Heck yeah!
---
Tight arse
---
Well have a good one! I will get back to one of these one bloody day! 
---
Much love nitro
---
Yes, and your point is?
---
The failure of your deployment was still a failure.
---
How do you hack a citadel to know the timers? Do you just go with a hacking module and play the minigame? Does the defender know the structure has been hacked?
---
I feel like Abyssal should have been an expansion in WH space. I don't know why they're an instance where you can fly to a quiet corner of the universe to run them uninterrupted. It seems like the antithesis of the entire game.
---
Have my daily REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I hunt explorers so this change helps me. I still don't like it. It just gives everyone more free intel.
---
It's not like I led 77 fleets (topped by only one person) throughout the last northern incursion because no one else would. That dank FC for ISK was calling my name.
---
Checkout pro-synergy
---
Somehow, one of my ships ended up getting saftied to lowsec, so I send my alt there to pick it up. The place is a faction warfare system and it was full of ships, so I logged out in the station where the ship was. I log on *as the server come up after downtime* in the morning. The login screen says there are 2,000 players logged in, and 6 of them were in this very same system.
---
So less flying around needed wich means less interaction possible between players, like that is what eve needed, less interaction... .
---
Who the fuck has a downvote brigade? You're being downvoted because you're attacking someone giving props to a new FC while simulnateously attacking the rot within the coalition FC team.
---
The Agency has zero fucking appeal though, even as a new player. That's what I don't understand. Who wants to do fucking NPC quest grinding? Why?
---
I use station containers to sort through stuff. I usually pullout anything that’s worth over 100k. Trash/reprocess the useless stuff. Ship the rest to Jita and sell it without looking back.
---
Interesting dscan
---
Lol what does that even mean post my actual identity? Why are you trying to come up to Wisconsin?
---
Don't make it sound like you got blobbed. You still outnumbered them from the get go. Just bomber wings are really strong vs. battleships.
---
i only said you were salty, i did not attack your giving props, but you seem hell bent on beeing a drama queen. Your narrative does not fit.
---
I need to be sober. . .ish :)
---
Soon . . . .
---
That will never ever happen.
---
I've had this problem before -- I was fitting 4 guns and one of them was just Not Showing Up and Could Not Be Unfitted Until I Reload Client even after repackaging, moving to different slot, clear cache/data, etc. It turns out that it was one specific gun that bugged out for some reason (which somehow persists even after repackaging and stacking them). I sold that one gun and after buying a new one everything worked as usual.
---
Ohh he's mad. Did someone talk bad about your PVPness?
---
*You're* clearly ignorant of history. Come back when you have something to contribute.
---
Something I agree with this subreddit on for once, those exploration changes are awful.  Ccplease listen for once before hand and not do this!
---
AFAIK you need a data analyzer and that's it. I don't think the defender get to know if it has been hacked.
---
It really depends where do you live and what do you want to do (aka enjoy) in the game. If you live in NS or WH, exploration is a good and easy way to make isk for very little skill point and isk investment.
---
Mostly I plan to live in HS for now, so if I do move to NS or WH I will start to do that kinda stuff
---
Bah, figures the one day I miss fleets is the day we get a great fight. Glad to see the war is finally...war-y. :)
---
If you live in HS you can run missions and/or abyssal (up until T3, after that you get a suspect timer and people can kill you). 
---
I would *really* advise against staying in HS and just running PvE solo. If you enjoy it why not, but Eve doesn't really shine playing alone just for the sake of accumulating isk. That's up to you and how you enjoy the game of course.
---
How many times will they have to reinvent the fucking wheel before they hear us saying we'd rather walk.
---
It makes things less safe for them because people know where to go looking to shoot them...
---
Unwilling collateral damage.
---
Well it was not a true exploration after all.         
---
Remember the old days when you drop probes around system and had a chance to find something random?         
---
This was 1000x times better that stuff we have now.
---
In k space you have local.
---
Yeah, I've only been doing pve and it's really boring, but I'm kinda worried about moving to null and losing all my money and stuff from repeatedly dying, how much should I have in money and skill before I venture into nullsec?
---
Never heard of it... I think it's the solution to my problem.
---
I see the idea behind the Agency, and it's not a bad one: to help new players find things to do in the universe and feel a little more secure about their decisions by giving them more information.
---
Old or not-so-new players won't use it, because we don't need it, but I see their intention of making things easier for newbies.
---
BUT they decided to go through with the Cosmic Anomalies bullshit that everyone said is gonna be a disaster, which is some seriously stupid decision.
---

As long as you arent one of those twerps who constantly tell people that you're going to fuck their mom, you're fine. Try to act a bit mature but remember that we all came here to have fun. After that, nobody has any fucks to give over your age son. Just come lose ships with us.
---
You basically have two ways to get out of HS, either in low, null and wormhole. either in an alliance who really organize the arrival or new comers or those that don't.
---
Those who organize it generally hand out free ships that you can fly in almost all situation for free while not being useless, and plenty of good option for really good isk making (much better than HS).
---
Those who don't will probably not offer the free ships, but it doesn't mean they won't teach you any less or offer you less opportunities for isk making, you will just have to bring the ship yourself. Those alliance generally are more tight grouped and offer better experience to know and play the game in a different way than most large alliances. It's easier to make friends and feel like you're part of a corp when you're playing with the same 20 people rather than 200.
---
It will also let them know where the new wormholes are.
---
c'est un escargot
---
my body is ready
---
You do play the minigame. You are safe even if you fail it however,
---
Can you link the stated reason for those living under a rock ?
---
As usual whenever there's a negative reaction against a change the csms nowhere to be seen(here or on the official forums). Wonder if they agree or if ccp doesn't want them posting negative opinions.
---
Flourishing.
---
Totally I am 43 I’m still scared, but it’s really your attitude that people care about, they will like you if you act mature, calm, and fun . Just be cool
---
So if I roll a WH and land 10 jumps from some nullbears they know instantly now?
---
/u/MartinCorwin got to it before I could because I was going to pull out a similar pun.
---
Damn.
---
&gt; We feel that this increased transparency will encourage bewildered players to travel outside of their system if there are no anomalies present in the current system
---
Quoted in the forum thread.

Good luck shooting them when every hole in ten jumps is rolled

If you're in highsec you can get people to haul it to a hub for peanuts.
---
Isn't FW/lowsec the place for subcap PVP?
---
we're about to get 3 new subcap ships and CCP also nerfed/buffed Damavik and Kiki what the fuckare you talking about dude
---
You already have this information on dotlan, so it's not likely hunters need this. 
---
More importantly hunters will now be on a ever heavier timer because if you come from a wormhole guess what the full region got notified. 
---
It gives you less options to catch somebody with there pants down really the only way to fight somebody that beats your force projection, it also does horrible things for k-space statics.
---
Anyone got a link to a video or stream of one of the huge tidi fleets of a keepstar timer? I wanna make a funny video about it, but only can find cinematic videos.
---
Any chance we can get this in 4k Resolution?

Aaaaah merci

Imperium vs legacy in 2020, it will be great :) panfam in third party :D
---
I have a hauler alt but any alt can work well. Contract it to them  and use the personal assets window to find all of your stacks. Wait till they build up to enough volume/collaterall to make hauling them worthwhile n either haul em yourself or set up courier contracts to a popular trade hub. Managing 100 1 item orders is a pain but if you let em build up to a decent amount, just logon the alt once n a while (like weekly or monthly) set it as the lowest sell price and watch the isk slowly trickle in with minimal effort. 
---
This helps to clean up your personal assets on your main too so I'm happy with it.
---
while a good suggestion, not entirely practical solo. The majority of the time spent is scanning and/or rolling holes to find a site and that can take hours if slightly unlucky
---
Daily reminder to adapt or die.
---
It wasn't that no one else would, you were literally leading pointless fleets in the wrong TZ for most people, solely to pad your stats.
---
Just join a large military focused corp like those in null space like Pandemic Horde, Brave newbies etc. They give out ships for free
---
Not from the game, original res is 2k.
---
right which is why I said people only care if you act like a kid. Act like an adult and I don't really care how old you are, act like a kid and I don't care if you're 50 I'm going to avoid you.
---
I was in the moveop fleet.  That's how I know it's fake.
---
I’m new, could you list a few of them?
---
Have you seen the kikimora? Nasty little ship that can kill entire fleets if used right.
---
PL. is nearing half the kills of goonswarm, despite being only 6% the size. NC.s numbers are looking similar. Hell, PH has just about 400 kills less and is only one third the size. By any respectable measure, Imperium are the ones that are inactive
---
They all look like Windows 98 clip art.
---
having hunted in relic sites the reasons there often not camped is because of a lack of explorers believe me the majority of time when you position a HIC into a site like you will be there for hours before somebody shows up.
---
RIP exploration
---
Lol.  I assume you explore in catch, near the Brave Staging system?
---
Try exploring somewhere where Simple Farmers don’t live, that will help a lot of your problems. Hardly anyone camps out in Esoteria/Paragon, for example.
---
There's people who play casual board and card games in a hardcore fashion, eve will always have hardcore players.
---
Other than goon alts being cancer, not much. But those get blocked by everyone pretty quickly so it’s not too bad
---
Jin'taan was young once and a FC for Provi Bloc
---
T3C is better than a Hecate/wolf in every way except price. However, that price also means it’s worth baiting you, while baiting out a wolf is a waste of time.
---
Would be interesting if CCP turned off ESI for an entire month. I wonder how people would cope
---
except the 3 new subs are trash lol
---
he said changes to pvp not adding useless ships
---
So I'm still confused about this change.. Is it going to tell you if there is a relic/data site in said system or is it just going to be showing that there are signatures that need to be scanned down?
---
&gt; solely to pad your wallet.
---
FTFY.
---
They do have a point, but this is just another one of those solutions that helps the established folk as much, or more, than the little guys
---
Thanks for posting this.  Will use this for the thumbs on some of my shows.  :)
---
Not the first time for Clara Mayaki.
---
Why does anyone think they can transport BILLIONS in value, and not have anybody notice.
---
worry not young lad, though I'm in my thirties, ppl still think I'm a 19 year old fart ! Nobody cares how old you are as long you have fun with them !
---
Just speak loud and show your fellow capsuleer they are worty of your presence (or vice-versa).
---
I frequent the great wildlands and rarely encounter another explorer. Catch has an active intel channel where they report and try to hunt non blue explorers.
---
So what are we supposed to do with all our scanning skills?
---
18 to fight and die, 21 to do all the other fun stuff.
---
If we could make a last minute change and delay the information by 15 minutes, that would be awesome.
---
per account
---
Make filters.
---
Meta 4:  Sell    
---
100k ISK or higher: Sell    
---
Salvage:  Sell    
---
Everything else:  Reprocess
---
I predict that the price of iso-10 and zero point will drop significantly, minerals for are going to be available alongside the new mats needed to build t2 ships, bpc's will increase in value, t1 trig ships will drop by about 1/3.
---
it'll tell you theres a sig. Its not a problem really for relic/data sites but it is for wormholes.
---
Here is my take on it. Ccp is try to appeal to the masses by making it more casual friendly. The problem is, eve is so niche that it will never really appeal to the casuals no matter how much you dumb it down, and by doing so you end up alienating thoes people that look for that niche. Results are pretty obvious! Ccp should just double down on that niche, sure it won't bring you that wow following, but you would still have strong, healthy and dedicated fan base
---
I second this! I was a founding member of signal cartel and the ceo is fantastic. Mynxee is her name. Tell her Sinagain recommended you. Great to learn exploration and pve aspects of the game, plus a super fun community.
---
At the moment I’m in eve uni and enjoy that very much as well. Literally whatever you want to do, they have it. In the past week I’ve null sec explored, some incursions, lvl 4 missions and a few other things with eve uni. They have campuses spread around the galaxy so it’s easy to stage stuff for whatever the uni does in that area.
---
Are you guys recruiting? I picked eve back up recently and I highsec Corp sounds like fun.
---
Test + Panfam can beat goons. As long as that is the case then there’s a chance for another WWB type thing to happen.
---
That's what I kinda figured, thanks!
---
Not quite, they will know there is a sig popped up 10 jumps away, but they will still have to go there and scan it down to find out what it is. But to answer your question, yes it does make safer for bears
---
That won't happen though
---
I'd say NC goal is more about making them bleed. So everyone's a winner.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.
---
Well then, it's a bit pointless to vote then isn't it?!  Cause we are not getting a vote of a people, but a vote of whoever has more alts
---
remember when probes died and you had to use new ones?
---
They've slowly been changing the game to suit superpowers and not small organic groups.
---
It's widely agreed upon that we have a tough time getting even those niche players hooked. I think this is what this intel change is aimed at. It's just a surprisingly potent addition, especially considering the acknowledgement of balance issues of intel in the game , that's all.
---
I mean, that makes sense from CCP's perspective, since the more alts you have the more important you are. Also, how on earth would they enforce a "per person" rule? lol
---
Pretty much the latter.
---
While CCP can trace this, there's a little effort involved.
---
well but you had chance to find something that was not there
---
That's like 4 hours of wormhole krabbing, or 1 hour peak efficiency
---
Perfect exactly what i was going for xD
---
Lets see how it goes first?
---
Sorry I'm not at my computer. If you search "background(something).png" in `resfileindex.txt` for SISI you'll find it.
---
but we know how it'll go :thinking:
---
You still need to scan it for what kind of sig. it is. I understand for null/low that it has higher implications then high sec. But it’s not like that there is a lv4 DED or unrated combat site spawn in system XYZ-123.
---
Not a wormholer, but man is this ever going to make it easy to find their outhole if they roll into a region looking to whale. Just send a bunch of cyno ceptors towards their first reported location and check all the unknown sigs, cyno in some rolling trash, and roll them in. 
---
This is going to be a shitty “Feature”
---
when is voting open?
---
Nah, but they probably were camping the bombers inside.
---
They have stated before that tracking a person-based vote would be almost impossible due to the fact that many people plex their accounts and never ever used a credit card to sub; so no real way to distinguish who already voted and who didn't, at least not without a fuck ton of work that would be hardly accurate.
---
its more; krabs get tackled, check for new sigs, wander a couple disposable BS to roll that hole to trap their fleet in your space. Less people roll holes because of this; Krabs are safer.
---
The literal only way people die in krabbing ships in null now is due to the groups who roll holes, this effectively kills off everything which threatens them
---
Finally making that one account thing a thing!  You know where you have all your characters on one account
---
I just hope that the character selection screen music changes... 
---
1. I hate the current one
---
2. They used to ALWAYS change it on an expansion
---
Wasting development time and effort to put in balance passes with subcap pvp doesn't generate revenue. Better to just keep piling on expansions to attract more krabs since each lost pvp pilot subscription can be replaced with a VNI or Rorqual alt.
---
Can you explain why it is bad to see there is X amount of annoms next jump over? 
---
They don't show you what kind of anom or anything. You can just see that they are there.. 
---
How is that such a bad thing?
---
Genuinely curious here as I think I'm missing something.
---
[take a look at this one](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VgfLU6cDPLRMqv7C8)
---
10/10. Would faceplant keyboard again.
---
i kept null loaded in that moment for when i had to stay in armor mode for the extra resist and rep time, also it does more thermal damage then the other round the void will do about 9 or 10 more thermal dam then the null ammo but you would not have that range and cant risk when rapid lights are coming in at times going to sharp mode timing is key o7
---
Small and medium gang subcap, yes.
---
I forget the exact numbers, but I pay for all of my yearly subscriptions with 25 hours straight time of real life work. I work another 15 straight time hours a year to pay for plex. Overall 40 hours of work equivilant a year to pay for something I spend easily 800 to 1000 hours a year doing. I get overtime, so I usually just spend 26ish hours of 300 to 500 hours of overtime a year and pay for my favorite hobby, EVE. In game I get to do whatever I want and never feel strapped for cash. 
---
I would have to grind almost 6 hours in EVE with 9 accounts to make in ISK what I make real life. The numbers just don't make sense when you look at it from that perspective. When I was in high school and college, I was all about hours and hours of ISBoxer and incursions and grinding hours on end, but now that I'm an adult with a job, way more fun and easy to just pay CCP back for years of fun and enjoy my time in EVE and in real life.
---
I agree.  One option might be to make them subject to manual approval and charge a few Plex to upload a custom logo to offset the cost of the manpower.
---
Great Wildlands has terrible loot. Don’t explore there unless you’re alpha and can’t dodge gatecamps or something
---
Ok
---
Or you could still create multiple accounts for multiple votes.
---
It is a problem for relic and data sites.  In hs and in some parts of null there is significant competition for these sites. Before this change you actually had to explore for the site. Now everyone will know where the cs are. This makes it easier for players just to zero in on sites as soon as they pop which ramps up the competition to a whole other level.   Basically it’s going to have the exact opposite effect of what ccp thinks it will do, as the experienced players hit these sites efficiently while the casuals lack the skills to compete.
---
You're missing PvP based updates.
---
/topic
---
Bring polarized blasters or go home.
---
No.. 
---
No one will know where you came from. 
---
Any of the 10 sigs in that constellation that just popped up could have been anything from wh to combat site to relic site. They won't know where you came from. And if you have enough alts out to see what systems they popped up in (since it only shows you within x jumps) you can do the same thing now with Intel channels and watching when sigs pop up.. 
---
Reddit is just doing its thing and screeching REEEE over something that does nothing but help a few newbros find signs to scan.
---
In theory, but FW is full of bots, citadels broke the existing shallow system lockout mechanic, assault frigate ADCU swung the frigate meta to almost always favor assault frigs thanks to the 15s of invuln and then you have groups like snuff, shadow cartel and other pirate groups that just drops caps on things in the area or hide cloaky recons in plexes. So most experiences players have in FW, are generally not good (not to say good fights dont happen, its just getting rarer). 
---
Its been ignored for too long to call it "the place" for subcap pvp.
---
You mean the minerals and other will drop from incursion as regular loot?
---
We have been ganking krabs in Frat space successfully in the past week with:
---
* blops
---
* dread bombs
---
* shotgun ceptors
---
* goku fleets
---
* small brawly gangs
---
* gatecamps
---
See b0rt zkill for evidence.
---
if drinks are on Dunlop in the Hillhead bookclub, Dunlop is gonna be not only skint, but in debt by round 2 :P
---
Dotlan is not live intel.
---
Its not. Reddit is being retarded again.. 
---
One months from now no one will remember they were mad about this.
---
Brilliant!
---
Just rat one system deeper than the really stupid :p
---
Not if it's against EULA to have more than one account since there is no need for it anymore?
---
Even as casual player, after clearing combat sites in one system, it is much more enjoyable (for me at least) to fly through space looking for new sites, compared to clicking through some windows. If i want to click through windows i can just browse internet, and not bother playing a game.
---
extract them and inject into the new ship building skills
---
Bullshit, I went to Provi X times in a solo frigate only to get gatecamped by 20 bored mouthbreathers.  
---
Provi is worse than Horde or Brave space, and that says something.
---
Sounds like consolidating important doctrines in preparation for northern war. 
---
1/10 shit post
---
I’m thinking those same fights were always there you just had to be done with your 1v1 before 18 Faxes suddenly appeared.
---
One difference is that they are basing a lot more of these decisions of collected data. That is what's driving this change and potentially others coming up so it's likely that if the date shows that this needs work, THAT will drive the change.
---
Your point being ? That you can read horde pings ?
---
It’s called the krabification of Eve, it’s Hilmar’s retarded venture mining inspired vision
---
I wonder why when vets screech REEEEEEE over basic changes.. not to mention ones that help new players and don't hurt vets..
---
I hope this shit works for j-space regions so we can finally figure out if site respawns actually work.
---
brb making 100 alpha alts to trigger sites.
---
Yup, I do remember :) I sold that character years ago, been kinda drifting in EVE since that time really, took a break and returned a short while ago.
---
&gt; It's unbelievable that they're ploughing ahead with this when the responses are 90% (being charitable) negative.
---
This is classic CCP and the reason why I dont trust their design qualities. We have so many examples of this sort of shit now. Some shitty design decision gets out, people an masse indicate it's a stupid idea and also clearly point out why, CCP pushes through, the shit we warned about happens, and CCP fixes it, "listening to the players". 
---
FUcking dumb stubborn CCP
---
It's reward vs effort. Before you actually had to jump from system to system to find out if there is a sig in system (potential wh) something most players would be to lazy to do! Certainly wouldn't go more than a couple of jumps away from home system. Now they can see if there is potential wh 20 jumps out in any direction without ever unlocking.
---
He better go sell his body on Sauchiehall street!
---
Can bee posters receive bans for garbage posting?
---
Trying so fucking hard. Every alliance in eve sees these pings.
---
I mean, the odds that one of the last 10 sigs to pop up are a wh are so low you might as well just burn you self system by system and scan for WH any way. 
---
I defo feel this is a huge REEEEE that none will remember in 2 weeks
---
I actually didn't know about Jita camping.. that definitely changes things lmao
---
The hull won't because there are mountains of minerals waiting to get used up. Any T2 modules or ammo will increase in price.
---
They were deployed to Delve?
---
Also i was facing shield fitted ships so Kinetic was not as viable as Thermal Range at that point
---
1. Set range to 8au
---
2. Double click on the anomaly
---
3. Move the cube right over the center of the anomaly, align top and side view
---
4. Scan the anomaly
---
5. If you get a single point, move the range a step below (4au) and repeat from step 2.
---
6. If you get a 2 points, move the range a ste below, choose 1 of the point and repeat from step 3.
---
7. If you didn't get a result, then you have to align on the other point.

Most of the reeing has been over changes with hurt the vets, so...
---
Thats jay maccaroni. He just can't quit it
---
No, no, no, your shit isn’t emergent bro.  It is “essentially” a response to a response that came out of, in hindsight, a poor game change...specifically injectors.  I watched your pathetic video complaining about n+1 and thought your play style is exactly that except it’s n+1 accounts multiboxing and injecting skills so you can fly capitals.  There is nothing emergent about that.  If that “krabbing” you complain about so much did not exist what would you do with your 100+ accounts there Mr “I have a $200 a month electric bill”???  
---
People create the safety in a given place.  A given region is not safe by design, the players make it so...that is emergent as much as you adding more accounts to boosh with.  And your complaint about Titans having no use?  Wtf is that all about.  Yesterday, in Pure Blind, I bridged on 6 different Titans.  They certainly have their uses but since they don’t fit your play style you want to see it nerfed.
---
gtfo with your narrow minded and selfish views.  Emergent my ass...if you do get elected I foresee you being the idiot that fetches the coffee and donuts while the intelligent folks actually coordinate and work with other people to get things accomplished for the good of the game.
---
I can already see the discord bots, wh group in intel, in the last hour these 3 systems had new sigs, their wh must be there.
---
Time will tell, but my money is on this is forgotten pretty fast.
---
It's not x jumps away tho. You can literally see any system, any constellation, any region within k-space.
---
Why are you locking/ deleting all the Goon propaganda,  but leaving the nc/ph posts active???
---
That self-screening against the Malediction is some of the sexiest dualboxing I've ever seen. Great vid.
---
Simple farmers don't camp relic sites. Doing so would put them at risk of being baited and caught.
---
If I am mistaken than ok. I still dont think it is going to be as bad as people feel lol
---
I mean if hit your head against the wall with no results, eventually you will stop hitting it
---
Sure but it gives you enough of a map of the ratting pockets to known where to go, like the anom despawns isn't something you have time to wait for anyway, specially not now that your wormhole is likely to light up Intel in seconds. 
---
Like in theory you could sit next to a system in a empty system and look for anom despawns to get a carrier warp but in practices your hole is lighting up intel along with well you having to find an empty local next to a ratting system that rarely happens.
---
11 years of playing and have never looked forward to a release/expansion less than now.
---
&gt; Not if it's against EULA to have more than one account since there is no need for it anymore?
---
It's against the EULA to have more than one account if "there is no need for it anymore"? 
---
What?
---
Without the coyote nobody could root for the roadrunner.
---
If you can have infinite amount of characters on one account thus removing the need to have more than one account. How is that hard to understand?
---
I believe that iso-10 and zero point will drop or will be a by product of mining / collecting the mats needed for t2 production, possibly bpcs, but not mutaplasmids, this I believe will remain  exclusive to abyssal sites, I have nothing to back this up, it's just gut feeling
---
Partisans were, not the entire alliance
---
They probably are.
---
There's several threads about it in the last week with reasons in.
---
The main issues are that it takes away the feeling of exploration from exploring, and that it will make krabbing even safer because now you don't even need to post a scout in surrounding systems to know when a new sig spawns. Depending on exactly how it works there may be issues with being able to see where a wormhole static opened and things like that too.
---
&gt; and CCP fixes it
---
if only
---
That’s fair. I don’t know why people are knee-jerk-downvoting you.
---
You’re right that they can coexist, but I would suggest that, while you can convince the hardcore autists to shower and hang out with the casuals, making Eve into that game would be radically different than what Eve has been, in the past.
---
I would also suggest that you cannot get casuals to play a hardcore game.
---
And lastly, I would suggest that making Eve into a casual game would destroy its uniqueness. Which is fine. But now I have no incentive to play it over anything else.
---
Well I hope they/you aren’t leaving just yet, there’s probably still some worthless ex-renter turbokrabs around who don’t even know there’s a war
---
Was the goon propaganda particularly stupid or offensive?
---
I created a omega alt specifically to put it in medium fw plexes in a bait tanked Maller with remote sensor boosters while my main sits in there with a Curse or other recon.
---
How smart is this?
---
you want sub cap fights? stop blobing 500 to 150 man fleets lmao
---
Do you have any recommendations for small corps I can join?
---
It really depends where you want to live. LS, NS, WH ?
---
You have to use the exploration tab to be able to compete. If you simply wander around looking others will be swooping in and taking them. If you have to wonder what system they are in, if any. And they know what system has how many they will win out. So for explorationists who have always competed for sites, they will now, from anywhere in the game k ow how many sites a given system may have.
---
You think people krab endlessly with no objective in sight? They do it to build up supercap fleets, and when those clash, the servers melt
---
Dont worry, we'll stay around to inform them.
---
Ouvrez vos quenoeils!
---
That and the date at the bottom is wrong, corps are left off. Ez
---
3 chars per account. only the account can vote. you can have an infinite number of accounts.

Nah lets dump money into the agency art window
---
BAG8 RECRUTE 
---
OH WAIT 
---
WRONG TOPIC
---
&gt; specially not now that your wormhole is likely to light up Intel in seconds. 
---
Unlikely.  Just because a sig spawns doesn't mean that it is a wormhole.  Just because it is a wormhole doesn't mean that it is a dangerous one.  The majority aren't.  There are what, 100 systems in Esoteria.  There will be so many new sigs that the info will be meaningless.  Announcing them in intel would be a very good way to shit up intel and make it completely useless.
---
I believe the people that think null blocks care about or fear them so much that we will be yelling about every new sig in intel lack perspective.  
---
As a primarily small gang PvP'er myself, the intel I will gain as a hunter trumps any intel I will give.  The people that tend to die to wormholers are not the type to watch intel to begin with.  The same types will die to wormholers that did before.  The smart ones will live as always because CCP made sov null too damn safe.
---
There was 1 meet i stayed sober. . . Never drinking that much coffee again!
---
Why is this getting downvoted?  Have you guys never flown one or just salty that he’s spewing the truth? Kiki’s a bad bitch, great for small gang and roaming and the command destroyers gonna be even better. Yeah it’s losing it’s drone bay and having a minor nurf to power grid, not a big deal with max skills and implants.
---
Updates like this are why I unsubbed. Glhf.
---
I did try this and it didn't fix the problem. Also tried clearing all settings, changing profiles, everything short of a reinstall. The only thing that works is moving around the 1 visible module into the other slots. a fairly simple solution but not one you would jump to when your modules are stuck offline and can't be removed.
---
I've explored a fuck ton and I have still to understand what's bad with this. If they are X anomalies in a constellation that are randomly spread through the systems, scanning all the anomalies in the system with the most anomalies or in the surrounding systems isn't going to be a vastly inferior.
---
Lol, sure.
---
I, too, like to delude myself into thinking that the entire purpose of EVE Online is to build up assets for a year, engage in a single server melting tidi fest, and then go back to krabbing for another year.
---
You can only have 3 Characters on 1 Account.
---
Do you know what you're talking about or are you just being mad for the sake of being mad?
---
Doesn’t iterate just mean “go over again”. Doesn’t necessarily mean a change will occur does it?
---
you want a sub cap fight stop droping caps on 5 man fleets 
---
you want a frig fight stop bring pirate frigs and freinds
---
you want stuff good for you so does every one else.
---
this is the eve online year book we do it live on my stream on twitch description is in the YouTube link. we usually do it on Friday or Saturday evenings around 7 - 9 pm my time which is western North america.
---
we make a short video of toons that were sent to me via eve- mail or ones seen along the way these toons consist of three categories they are either color coordinated or amazingly done or just plain right hilarious..  
---
all we ask if you participate is that you say one thing before you say anything which is " I will always Remember "  
---
then say what you remember could be someone you fought scammed did something stupid they killed you so many variables or you can just say something hilarious about the moment you are seeing it makes for such good laughs live and smiles.  
---
we will be making a few real life copies near the end of the year and they will be given out freely to people who have won are in game events.  
---
we have one of the best gaming communities in all of the industry and we need all of your help to keep the year book growing i hope to see you all at the next one this weekend.  
---
thanks for taking the time to read this and check out the video i hope it to brought a smile to your face like it does for us o7 you beautiful capsuleers

I've seen plenty of goon prop for the war posted here
---
Dude read the conversation above!  We are talking hypothetically here. Ccp talked about how they were working on feature (which got scrapped) that allows you to consolidate all characters on one account by allowing you to have more than 3 characters on one account. By introducing accounts with infinite amount of character slots, would eliminate the need to have more than one account.
---
You copypasted an open-group's ping w/ a timestamp and provided zero context, information or narrative.   
---
You're an idiot and a waste of pixels.
---
I mean assuming that it matters to you, you’re probably in Goons, meaning pretty much everybody in goons already knows that.
---
What was the point of this, who cares? Lol
---
Have Goon titans done anything besides move ops yets?
---
&gt;With its ally dispatched, Providence Bloc’s fleet came under fire from every quarter, leading to its destruction as well as that of its capital ships. This allowed RC forces to secure both the Fortizar and the field.

A more accurate phrase would run along the lines of:

---
Dont they have meds for that sort of thing?
---
Paving the way for exploration without login!

You are actually a moron.

they made you evac before even moving up lmao

Likening NC. to Noble 6 is just disrespectful to Noble 6.

As long as you have nothing to do with Goons or Test (not sure how PH is), you’ll be pretty much fine with your anxiety..
---

---
Take it easy. Eve itself is a VERY slow burner. Enjoy just fumbling about. Learn stuff on eve uni. Maybe join a chat channel or two and just lurk. And if you want to shoot stuff with other people at some point, i would suggest to join fw and be active on their comms. Lot's of people (with all sorts of anxieties)
---
Would you elaborate to explain this piece of art?
---
M8 do yOu WaNt mE to dRaw YoU a picTUre?!?!??! I really don't get how is it hard to understand?  Or are you just baiting
---
Try one thing at a time. I tried mining in highsec. Exploring. Did that a LOT because I loved it. Meanwhile, trained bomber skills, ratted battleships in Null (dont do it), moved up to ratting in a carrier. Was bored quickly. Dud some FW PVP, meh, not for me. Did tons of trading, loved it. Now trading, krabbing in a wormhole, flying expensive-ish ships I dont mind losing. Found my own niche. I'm sure you will too, if you try. That reminds me, I should try industry.

Ccp bad, exploration dead
---
I like Thrashers
---
Excellent!
---
This is the complete opposite of the truth.  Smaller groups tend to want you to be on coms more.  You can disappear into a big group more easily.  I do that (also suffer from anxiety issues).  I rarely speak up on coms.  I don't rat in a super or mine in a rorqual either because if I get caught I've got to shout out for help on coms.
---
I do type a lot in chat though!
---
So my advice to OP would be to join a big group like TAPI, Karmafleet or Horde (I've missed somebody I'm sure but those are the main 3).  You can still be active and participate.
---
I have a character in all races just because 😂 i Just enjoy the game in general
---
We are staged in the same system we have been for months
---
The agency: we will find more excuses to make you open it. Here have a look at some signatures. THE AGENCY WILL BLOCK OUT THE SUN
---
chad bees are sacrificing virgin PL to the whelp gods to gain favor in their war
---
There are meds to reduce the feeling of anxiety, yes.  However they don't change the aversion to speaking, which is learned over many years and needs a lot of cognitive therapy to overcome.
---
Where is the 15W KS again?
---
Why is it a shitpost?  He's just relaying the ping.
---
My point was smaller tight knit communities are more accepting and friendly, meaning he can actually get comfortable using comms eventually, which will make his eve experience better, can’t say the same about the big groups. Toxic, immature and damn irritating.
---
Suitonia took earlier feedback to ccp, they said they would look at it. Nothing happened.
---
Did you have a bad experience with a big group or something?  I've not experienced any toxicity.
---
I’ll roll C5’s &amp; C6’s cause capitals.
---
[It’s possible.](https://youtu.be/7fujQNeLPd8) although definitely the high end.
---
Oh really? Ever been on a Goons fleet and looked at local? Damn, I even got flamed for “undercutting” the market when all I was trying to do is provide cheaper items to the people..
---
I’ve been on TEST fleets while I was in legacy, racism, autism, all kinds of bullshit, equivalent to Goons tbh.
---
&lt;3  
---
viendez chez nous y'a du PQ
---
I would suggest going on some public fleets to get comfortable with fleet comms. You can leave anytime and most public fleets tend to be more relaxed because there is no objective other than fun.
---
Maybe we can skip to the real content we want. A spinning wheel that you get, once every 24 hours (more if you buy keys with plex) or of you pay an additional 9.99 a month on the accounts sub you get up to 4 per day but only 1 an hour.
---
Note* the above statement in relation to eve made me want to puke.
---
No he is not.
---
Have you got those pics without the 'Tribute Burns' text and logo? They'd make pretty cool wallpapers otherwise
---
Madness!!
---
fly safe friend, enjoy your time irl, you still have a great group of friends and enemies to come back too :)
---
Haha thanks dude.
---
Max your learning skills first. It'll help you train faster in 2006.
---
You were flamed for undercutting the market, in local?  Seriously?  You read 1DQ local?  I've been on hundreds of Goon fleets recently (within the last few years) and the "edgelord" culture of ten years ago really doesn't exist anymore.  Apart from the odd joke, I've not heard much objectionable sperg.  There's "No Chattah" on fleet coms to avoid it on most fleets in any case.
---
I think you probably need to recalibrate your experiences by joining a big group.
---
I understand where you come from. I have some serious social anxiety although it lead me to gravitate towards more smaller scale communities, small gang warfare, etc. Not as many people at a time.
---
I can definitely say that it does help a bit as when you join a corporation, for the most part it's just a bunch of people that want to be there and have fun with internet spaceships, you've already broken that first layer of ice. And usually people don't really ask too much of your personal life stuff, for the most part, so it's kind of cool that you don't have to break those layers of ice. 
---
Just make sure to find a good community, and don't be afraid to try different groups to experience different things.
---
I’ve been playing for a good few months. Goons was my first big group and I left it for that exact reason, my second big group was legacy in which I was for about 4 months, which I left 2 weeks ago. What exactly do I need to recalibrate?
---
I don’t know why you’re in denial, I’m sharing my PERSONAL experience and you’re making an argument out of it?
---
Have you heard about wormholes
---
https://i.imgur.com/C2C7EOV.jpg
---
Why did you make this video?
---
I saw something about exploration escalations in the agency on Singularity last night. Maybe they think those will balance it out? I'm sceptical regardless.
---
It isn't a terrible idea, though people usually use a punisher in the bait role. You will start attracting the ire of the locals if you only gank and don't fight, though that isn't necessary a problem. Just be aware that after a while people will try and counter-bait you.
---
Probably LS or NS, is LS any safer than NS? In theory it should be right? From what I've heard I need more experience before I go into WH
---
As a virgin i find this offensive!

A properly fit rattlesnake will work against any officer. Just control the range and make sure you have the DPS. Aim for 1400+

---
I'm not arguing with your personal experience.  I'm just curious to understand why it's so different to mine.  I mean you've been playing "months" not years, so I'm not sure how extensive your experience actually is.
---
It's possible it's you, not the group, that's the problem here.
---
Literally spends the first 2 minutes explaining why he is making this video.
---
Thanks a lot man
---
Are you leaving Delve after 1 week or not?
---
What about the ability to create our own corp logos?
---
eve has sound?
---
Wanted to highlight your left leaning position where you decide where others spend there money.  I’ll make it how I wish and spend it as I wish you commie fuck.
---
What difference does it make unless I’ve been playing for days?
---
I’m pretty sure it’s not me as I mind my own business most of the time and I normally fit into the more chilled out groups. As I stated before, on a personal matter it was the market incident, the rest has been general toxicity and racism whether it was in local or in comms, I don’t see how I could be the problem in this case.
---
I always hate all new corps i get into, 20 people on comms talking to each other and you know nobody is shit. I found myself in very small groups so I can get comfortable with the players, once I really know everyone after a couple weeks I usually really grow.
---
Blueballs or helldunks from NC., what's the matter?
---
Not enough information. Got a link to your kill-board?
---
a link to your killboard so we can see what you are fitting and how would help
---
Pretty sure the guy intentionally posted this ping instead of the one before, as the first one would've indicated something else ;)
---
Holocausts of the future are fun and heroic!
---
People keep pointing to this as a thing, but I don't see it. There is already so much info out there with Intel reporting tools that this really is insignificant.
---
Also, not a single person that explores does it to "explore" they do it to make isk, so that really is one of the dumbest arguements.
---
Lol it's incredible how you internally fostered so much hate you even manage it to make it ideological.
---
When have I told you how to spend your money?
---
In more popular areas people are actively scanning and running the sites... there will be new sigs popping up constantly. This isn't some new magic tool to know when wormhole bogeymen are coming.
---
Don't give up on it just yet. First time I tried eve, I really got nowhere. It is a difficult game to learn, especially if you're used to other MMOs, which frankly do a lot of hand-holding.
---
The way I finally managed to break through the learning gap was by joining Eve university. They're a brilliant corp especially geared towards helping newbies.
---
Give them a try, or alternatively, look into other newbie-friendly group like Brave Newbies or Pandemic Horde. 
---
They usually don't have as many scheduled classes as E-uni, but they take a more active part in Eve's wars and politics and they frequently offer free ships and the opportunity for low-skilled players to fill in some role in their main fleets.
---
I make about 60-100 mil an hour there. Is that bad for a relic hunter?
---
You already can, though im not sure if they're still following through on the process as it took ages between batches (i think its the same as corps?)
---
regardless, they would require GM approval just so people dont put porn as their logo just to get CCP in hot water
---
Give us some of your losses. Chances are high that you're not fitting your ships properly and are dying before you have the chance to learn anything.
---
Thanks but what has PL sacrificed exactly?
---
Shall I quote you or are you intelligent enough to read your own comment?  Seriously, people like you have a hard time understanding or modifying your thinking when someone calls you on your hypocrisy...guess it’s just a little too complicated for you to understand.
---
I dont plan to put any guns or drones on the maller. Its purely there to attract people. Im positive people will still get pissed though.
---
Ah.
---
Tristan is life. Super easy to fly and very versatile. Can shit on mostly anything except firetails. Slicers in general are super easy to dunk once you start manually piloting, hookbills and kestrels can be sketchy
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75232227/
---
Nano tristans aren't my speed personally, with the bulkheads and the AAR you get a ton of tank. Lots of people will tell you to fit more neuts - I find that the one is plenty and the autocannon DPS is actually useful. You can play with it
---
&gt; It is “essentially” a response to a response that came out of, in hindsight, a poor game change...specifically injectors.
---
"Emergent" means players coming up with ways of play that were unintended by the game designer. Whatever description you have is mutually exclusive with "emergent".
---
&gt; People create the safety in a given place. A given region is not safe by design, the players make it
---
The tools players have at their disposal to make regions safe or risky are parts of game design. CCP can make the game safer by making it easier for players to make their space safer, or can do the opposite.
---
The whole goal of Dust/Legion/Nova was supposed to create a slice of the EVE universe that can appeal to casuals. And you know what, it almost worked. Look how hyped people get for FPS gameplay in Scam Citizen. We need this shit in EVE if they want to expand the universe to more casuals without ruining EVE Online proper.
---
If you're determined to be offended you'll hear sexism, racism and homophobia everywhere.
---
Urh no it's not
---
PL is the sacrificee, not the sacrificer.
---
It can still technically happen but you pretty much have to fall asleep at the computer.
---
You are doing demagogy my mate. I've never told you what to do with your money.
---
practice makes perfect
---
Exactly, what has PL given to goons as a sacrifice lol
---
The main reason why I left those groups was the immaturity. My initial post was aimed at OP, if he has social anxiety I don’t think all of this is going to help him. It never really bothered me, but I was tired of drama and bullshit in comms and in chat.
---
The only other group that I can think of that can be considered “Big” is Brave, and they’re very strict on the “Stay classy” Rule, I was with them, great bunch of people but I wanted to leave the blue blob anyway.

If English isn't your first language, don't be stressed out about your English not being that good. Most of the people that you're playing with only know one language, so you're already ahead of the game.

Keep 2 accounts, run one in an explorer and the other in a combat ship.  Scout scan and do sites in your explorer, gank with the combat ship whenever you find something.

---
That’s actually a lot better than I was making, maybe the lack of competition makes up for each site being worth less on average. 
---
I think I make just over 100 mil/hr on average, but I have to time my exploration for non-peak times, so between that and the time it will take you to find a good pocket and learn who the campers are it probably isn’t worth it
---
Guess we can start with this? https://zkillboard.com/kill/76945779/
---
"Security status" is a very bad statistic to look at and just concerned rats and criminality. LS is a lot less safe than NS because everyone can live in LS. in NS, if you live in a system you most likely own a lot of systems around and maybe even surrounded by allies. If someone can dock, either you're near NPC space or you're being invaded, but most generally people have to jump a few systems before they can get to you, and generally they can be reported on coms and you and your allies will have a defense fleet. That's not a thing in LS.
---
You should check r/evejobs for ads for corp in LS or NS.
---
Haha thought about it xD
---
here you go 
---
that could be it 
---
Ask the op. He's the master spy here.
---
The problem is your target selection, you have no chance of winning the fights you're getting into. In your fits you should only be trying to engage other tech 1 frigates.
---
Il pm you , I won't make them public i guess :)
---
Thanks for your help, in gonna build up some money and move once I finish this epic arc I'm doing rn
---
A lot of your deaths look like simply being outshipped/outgeared, so don't take it too personally! I saw a smartbomb death or two, a death from a Stratios, and a death from a Proteus. Other times, it's a T2 frigate (Ishkur) or a Faction one.
---
Keep working toward T2 modules; a lot of your fits are T1.
---
For PvP, T1 Frigates will get you fights the quickest. You pretty much just head straight to any FW zone and warp to 10 at any popped Novice (popped ~ a Novice site that is on the Overview).
---
I love to fly Gallante and Minmatar so my go to's are:
---
*Atron ~ H: 3x Light Neutrons, M: T2 AB, T2 Web, T2 Scram, L: T2 DC, compact MagStab, SAAR, Rigs: 2x Aux Nano Pump, Trans bulkhead
---
 
---
- The T2 AB, Web, Scram is super important here, it allows you to have the best range control mixing the 60% slow, AB overheat.
---
- You can drop the guns to Ions if you want to fit a small Nos.
---
*Incursus ~ H: 3x Light Neutrons, M: T2 AB, T2 Web, compact Scram, L: compact DC, T2 MagStab, Adaptive Nano, SAAR, Rigs: 2x Aux Nano Pump, Hybrid Collision
---
- for me, running hot, I get 235dps. Again the T2 web and scram are super important here for range control. Collision over burst just for cap management.
---
*Slasher ~ H: 3x 200mm ACs, T2 Nos, M: T2 AB, T2 Web, compact Scram, compact Tracking/Missile Disruptor, L: T2 DC, SAAR
---
- This is a really fun frigate. Its very fast and nimble, and the tracking/missile disruptor allows you to take a lot of fights you normally wouldn't think a slasher could. Being not common as a combat ship most people think this is forward tackle for a gang and often cat and mouse a lot until they realize you're solo.
---
*Rifter (my pride and joy) ~ H: 3x 200mm ACs, M: T2 AB, T2 Web, T2 Scram, L: T2 DC, compact Gyro, T2 Adaptive Nano Plate, SAAR
---
- Although being my favourite frigate, the lifter is pretty weak right now. With it losing its utility High it got even worse (imo). It's not very good at anything which is why it's in a bad spot. It's strength comes from it being slightly faster than most other combat frigates(Tristan, Merlin, Tormentor, etc.), whilst having slightly more damage than scout/tackle frigates (Executioner, Condor, etc.). You will have to master range control vs specific targets and using the right damage type. Also, everyone and their dog will take a fight vs a Rifter, so if you want fights fast, this is the go-to ship!
---
T1 Destroyers and Cruisers are fun to go out in as well, but they are a bit slower and don't target as fast as frigates so any fight you get will be consensual... So I would strongly suggest to not cat-and-mouse too long with them as when your target does concede to fighting its probably because his friends are en-route.
---
** Pro Tips: **
---
* As a general rule AB+Scram+Web are almost always a necessity in lowsec, because you will lose range control to any ship that has those. Most low-sec PvPers aren't spod-brains so they will pull range and disengage if they are losing.
---
* SAARs are almost always the go-to for any armour repair, and if you can spare them on a shield ship they are great too. With nanite, overheated, they repair 172hp ~ so 7 cycles gives more health than a T2 400mm Plate. They also use relatively low cap, when empty (compared to Shield AARs), so make sure you always disable auto reload and just keep pumping it hot and dry.
---
There are corps that will randomly wardec hoping to catch you moving things from markets. It's a pain in the ass and nothing you can really do about it. Having an alt own the station is your best bet
---
We are!  Feel free to join our discord and ping me (same name there) https://discord.gg/rGJ3ft
---
okay, so I should maybe be running cruisers or destroyers if I want to take on a wider range of ships?
---
It might be helpful for new players.
---
You will be able to see exact exploration site types before entering a system
---
where do i find this?
---
Quite simply every Corp has people in it just like you (and me). No matter where you end up most groups have some sort of recruitment process where you will have the opportunity to express your feelings. They can then get you introduced to a couple of peeps and then it just kinda takes off from there. The big alliances mentioned all have new player friendly corps. Feel free to DM if I can help you out.
---
- First, never ever fight against a pirate or faction frigate if you are in a T1 frigate. I know pro frigate PvPier will tell you that there are some match up you can take : don't listen to them, you don't know that shit yet, and until you do avoid all non T1 frigate at all cost. This is what cost 90% of your death.
---
- Second, don't fly cheap. Use T2 modules where ever you can. Never ever use T1 drones, always fly T2 or faction (yes, they are most expensive). Never ever use T1 module, always use meta if you can't use T2. Yes, it's a pain that you have to pay 10mil per frigate, but you will never be able to win anything with 1/2/3mil frigate.
---
- Third, loosing fight means learning. I'm a 3 years old player, I still loose more than half the fights I take 1v1. I learn a lot, I get better. I was exactly like you at the start. It's frustrating, yes, but that's how the game works. Ifyou would be playing Starcraft 2 and loosing all your matches, I would tell you the same thing.
---
- Finally, join a corp. Don't play this game alone, and go in a roam with people who will teach you shit, allow you to get on some kill and contribute.
---
Not in live client yet AFAIK
---
Yes and no. You can definitely get into more fights the larger the ship you use but the targets you're choosing will be very hard for you to take down alone. You are engaging faction ships, in other words more advanced ships than what you have access to. Regardless of the size of ship you use, you should be looking to engage people in other tech 1 ships, these are the ships you'll have access to.
---
Maybe someone can post the yearbook for frigates 2019 which is a nice deal on fits and fights for frigate. Informative.
---
is nc docked?
---
Some of your deaths look like you fought against significantly higher class ships than your own. I wouldn't worry at all about your Kill - Death ratio and instead focus on joining a corporation that you make friends in. So just choose your engagements and if you fight against something better than you, fly at maximum range and make them come to you.
---
Check out /r/evejobs for a list of corps currently looking for new members. Also, check out Fweddit: http://join.fweddit.space :)
---
It was good enough in 2003, it's good enough now.
---
Unrelated: Thinking of upgrading my modem. Any recommendations?
---
I had a little play around with it on test server and the only saving grace it doesn't give you sig ID, all it says "unknown sig" and it won't save in agency window after you scan it down. For all you know old sig despawned and new one popped up, but to you it will still look like that one sig unless you go there and check ID. It literally just says "hey look something is here, go find out what it is!" I'm still on the fence about it though
---
Far too relatable. That was my brother and I the other night after we got complacent...
---
Haha, nice
---
I've been playing for ~ 3 years and I don't have any other accounts/alts. I do everything on the same tune. It keeps things simple for me :/
---
That being said, a hauler alt would definitely come in handy ~ 1 month of training can get you pretty much the best skills you'd need for a good PI Hauling Alt (Using the Gallante hauler ~ Epithal).
---
I'm super casual with it and do 1 week cycles. A handful of corpmates and I set up our PI to be able to make Nanite repair paste and it gets the 4 of us 100-150mil each/week.
---
Tfw this coulda been a thing to "provide content" in Molden Heath by having lore nerds team up with dust bunnies before dust 514 shut down.
---
(I'm looking at you pie. ;) )
---
Yea they do it to make isk - consequently there is competition for sites. Now with everyone knowing exactly where every site spawns the moment that it spawns that competition is going to be turned way up, and the people that are going to really suffer are the new, causal players, as the vets will use these tools too and are much more efficient in running them. 
---
Basically this is another counter productive change from the people that have no idea how to play their own game.
---
Escalations have been in for ages, I guess this moves the ui forward and turns it into a giant button instead of an obscure tab hidden within journal?
---
polarized stealth bomber would probably work for most officers if you max range fit it and never dropped transversal. it would not work for guristas officers though, not enough dps.
---
Okay so what I'm getting from this is train for T2  as soon as, and don't be a cheapskate. Thanks guess I've gotta get use to the different ship metas.
---
First off, you should stop flying the Maulus as a solo ship. It's more useful in a support situation and trying to fly with it as a combat ship is just going to get you killed.
---
Second, stop using Small Shield Extenders. You should look to train Power Grid skills and the Shield Upgrade skills. Most Frigates can easily fit a Medium Shield Extender that'll give you a much bigger pool of health.
---
And finally, a lot of your deaths are just poor match ups. A lot of Pirate frigates (like the Worm) and Navy ships (Hookbills) will just rip apart almost all T1 frigates.
---
If you see those ships, just stay away and warp out instead of trying to fight them.
---
I get that, but this was specifically under the Exploration section. I was hoping for data/relic/ghost escalations, but maybe not.
---
56k quad bonded... fastest modem out there.
---
You try to fight something way above your weight. fits are ok though. PVP is a lot of trial and error, and practice. I really recommand people to join corp/alliance to get mentorship in EVE. EVE University and Pandemic horde are great allaince to get mentorship.
---
Content denial is Goons calling card. Such short memories. NC is just going by your playbook,
---
Okay, so larger ships are will be easier to find a well-matched/advantageous fight in. Will faction/higher tech ships always win or are there fights the underdog can win?
---
Pics or it didnt happen
---
I also used to live there - with FUITA.  Had a blast fighting in and around there before it all went to shit.
---
I'm seeing alot of "go to delve go kill peoples drones" lol not saying anything but that sounds really boring.
---
Come to me. Ill give ya your first killmail. Fly blingy please
---
Also maybe try finding a corp. That maulus you were flying is a great addition to any small gang and most players would love to have a decent maulus/Keres pilot along.
---
Why would they do this? It makes no sense. Exploration appeals because of discovery and this takes it away.
---
Might be something to do with Hilmar ending his 12 year bot addiction ie we are moving into a realm of profitable pve only being accessed by cosmic sig escalation instead of grinding annoms non stop which are easy to bot?
---
Bees dont wear cowboy hats.
---
I would suggest not using ships larger than a cruiser until you have more experience. Stick to fighting ships that are in the same category or smaller. Underdogs can win but you need a lot more experience and a bit of luck.
---
7 systems. The other two are in a different region that dotlan wont show here.
---
Okay that's reassuring. Thank you, will have a look.
---
Daily reminder I'm one of your candidates for more explosions.
---
##MEDA
---
Ok, so first I would start off with saying work on picking the right fights.  A maulus isn't going to beat a succubus, a tristan isn't going to take a worm, 3v1 against macharials was probably you jumping into a smart bomb gate camp so you can't really do anything about that. T2 fit thrashers have a huge damage advantage over you so its not a great match up for a T1 frigate.  
---
Polarized mods like the rep you have on a lot of those fits do have better stats than average mods, but the trade off is you lose your resists, which lowers your effective HP on a frigate its going to make it really easy to kill you.  
---
Make sure you are training support skills that compliment your fits, a lot of people train into guns but don't train skills like surgical strike, controlled bursts, rapid firing, trajectory analysis.   
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/76898005/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76898005/) always fit the same gun in all gun slots to avoid having different optimal  ranges on your weapons.  
---
Your fits definitely seemed to improve as time went on so you are getting better at that just make sure to keep the guns identical and you usually want to avoid polarized mods outside of very specific fits that use them. The biggest thing you need is experience knowing what the ships you are facing can do and which ones to avoid. If you are going to fly solo I would stick with either the tristan, or try the incursus. It would depend on what you have trained more for drones or guns. And obviously keep training the small stuff, you will have more success in PVP if you focus on small guns and small ship skills and get up to using tech 2 frigs and weapons then if you just skill into a larger ship like a destroyer or cruiser. T2 guns and tank mods can make a huge difference when it comes to 1v1 fights.
---
I think Eve is pretty dangerous already: https://zkillboard.com/
---
Mmmm I don't drop caps on five man gangs and I only fly pirate frigates solo in low sec if I ever feel like wasting money...
---
You seem to be confusing me with someone else.
---
Errrrrrrrr. I don't... I don't choose how many people turn up to a fight nor do I choose fleet comps, the time we depart or how many people to wait for. I'm not an FC anymore so it's not really anything to do with me.
---
okay sounds like I mostly just need to learn my place in the pecking order and not get in fights with higher tech ships. Starting to think I need to look at ship tech levels not just size when I pick my fights/get jumped :L.
---
https://i.imgur.com/WF2NtxM.png
---
Same question
---
At least the game wont last five more years at this rate. Then we will all be winners!
---
Fly with friends first to learn the ropes.
---
Your engagement profile should be relegated to fleet tackler for now.
---
You're on the right track though... At least you're getting out there.
---
Props to you.
---
My point is, eve itself as a game won't! But eve themed fps?! Hek sure that has lots potential to hit big with the casuals. Especially if you introduce cross game play. For years I have been trying to get my friends in to eve just so I can play with them, but being filthy casuals they just can't get in to it and on flip side I can never really get in to games they recommend. When dust got announced I was really excited, finally I can play together with my friends playing two different games. Just think about it two different games EACH OF US CAN ENJOY!  That was awesome concept which I was ecstatic about. But they released it for ps3 and we all know how that went down. Ccp needs to capture that crossing of two worlds for nova to become successful

“...invested in to Titans which never have any real use.”  So, you are telling me I should “invest” in something, in your opinion, that has useful purpose?  In other words, you are saying if I buy a titan I’ve spent my money in a way with which you disagree.  Fine, I disagree with you spending so much money on dreads, pontifex, and accounts.  Regardless, all this talk of how your play style  is so much better than other players has me wondering what you think you could actually do on the CSM.  Will you take that same condescending attitude with you to Iceland?  Is your intention to get CCP to change the specifics you’ve talked about in order to benefit only your play style?  If that’s the case I probably won’t play much longer as I don’t intend to plex 100+ accounts.  You see, I’m ok with what they’ve done except for one thing:  skill injectors.  Injectors have enabled your game play as well as the players who have spent their money on super caps.  There is no difference...neither of those two things would exist at current absurd levels (you with all those accounts and grrr goons with all those titans) if it were not for skill injectors.  Will you support their removal from the game?  If not then you aren’t exhibiting fair mindedness and a “for the good of the game” point of view.  You talk about skill and creativity but I do not see either play style as involving much skill or creativity...just ever increasing numbers, be it accounts or ships.  So attacking one’s choice in this ccp created world over yours is faulty and simply proves the point that you are being disingenuous when you say you support risk/reward balance over safe asset acquisition when you have done the same thing.  You say some are “asset acquirers” but are you not guilty of the same (currency being an asset after all)?  I’m not defending CCP’s decisions but you are guilty of attacking how the players have dealt with it...I’d suggest taking a broader view if you intend to engage with executives and developers.
---
Rorqs are safer than ever
---
How are they not focusing on PvP? Abyssal PvP was the largest PvP addition they have made in years, and this next expansion is building on Abyssal Deadspace - the very arena where this takes place. 
---
I really cant think of a more pure and dynamic form of PvP that could trump Abyssal. So many variables are controlled that a pilots skill is the most relevant factor. 
---
While not confirmed, I am really hoping and guessing that this Abyssal stuff eventually leads to an area of the game where dropping and large fleets are not a thing, where small gangs and solo pilots are the only player entities around.
---
Thanks, I have done an unfortunate amount of research which is part of the reason I was getting so despondent. I do have some friends that go on roams every now and then so will just have to be patient I guess.
---
And the race for the last killmail ever will be amazing!
---
Research only means so much, at 2 weeks old PvPing solo is an uphill battle. 
---
You've got to fit better, fly better and choose your targets well which is very hard for a 2 week old character to do.
---
Everyone you fight probably has 20%+ more dps and 20% more tank.
---
treating eve war like MuH HiStOriCaL wAr

lmao
---
So is a krab anyone in Eve who pursues a stable income of Isk essentially?
---
found the dickbutt
---
&gt; So, you are telling me I should “invest” in something, in your opinion, that has useful purpose?
---
No. You're just too hateful to be able to follow what's actually going on.
---
1) I misunderstood the post of OP (https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/btkgrz/delve_as_a_solo_hunter/eoz4b1b/) . I thought he was referring to me, saying I was the risk averse krab while I was complaining about your risk averse krab. My entire post was due to that misunderstanding. We solved it here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/btkgrz/delve_as_a_solo_hunter/eozqz1y/
---
I just didn't delete my own post afterwards.
---
2) So given all the above context. I mistakenly thought he said I was a risk averse krab. I responded by citing what you guys do with your money, which is more risk averse than what I do with my money. So if he thinks I'm risk averse but Goons spend their money in more risk averse way, that'd be a contradiction. Apart from that I have never said anything about how you should spend money, whether you should be risk averse or not. I'm fine with the idea of people doing whatever they want with their money.
---
AFAIK the invitation will sit there forever unless it is accepted, declined, or revoked.
---
Alright thank you, will pay much more attention to tech level of my targets from now on.  Also will git good.
---
ahahahaha this post is goons 2k19
---
My post stands...you aren’t seeing my point.
---
see if you can uninstall and not reinstall that dangerous!
---
Let me tell you, honestly, that I understand exactly what you're saying. But, unless you could be logged into multiple characters on the same account at the same time, then the idea is worthless. People don't just have alternate characters to have them. They use them to be a scout, a cyno, a tackle, a fleet of drone-assisted Algos on a stargate, 17 Rorquals mining at the same time, or 48 Skiffs sucking the same space rocks. You take that away and you remove a LOT of people's primary playstyle. Also, if people are already paying CCP 3-10x as much as some people for multiple accounts, why would they create a feature that actively loses them money?
---
If the invite expires and they won't let you apply again there are many other corps out there that would be willing to accept a new player who is just trying things out.
---
Newbros are welcome in the majority of corps so you should have no problem finding a home.
---
Abyssal just turned in to ridiculously binged out fits that the majority of players can't afford to run efficiently from what I've seen.
---
As long as these areas are spread out enough that the full player base can enjoy them then sure. I find it a joke that unless you go in to abysall arenas with bling fits, implants and boosters you don't stand a chance.
---
Actually that happened!
