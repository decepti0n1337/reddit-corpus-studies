Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

If you can find the Telugu version, that's the original vocal track. You lose some great voice performances with the dubs.

Alpha begins end lf the month. Sooooo pretty far

he's a retard

Tritanium would win

eve porn!

&gt;slap the hauler right in the titties, and then blow you.

Just came here to say that sounds kinky AF.
---
Easily the best character in the movies. Katappa.
---
Lotta singing in these too, but it's great.

---
I watched guys fight each other in full armor in the blazing California sun. How the fuck can you breathe in that shit? Pretty sure I would suffocate within a minute.
---
Part of the game is being shot. A lot. And this was already dumbed down by a lot. When i started playing friendly fire in corps wasn't something that could be disabled and you could even shoot fleetmembers with no repercussions. People actually went around inviting newbros to fleet pretending to help them and then killed them. The tutorial missions would send you to a SOE station in nullsec. Can flipping was still a thing.  
---
  
---
The possibilities to grief newbros were trimmed down massively since back then and still we have a lot less players now. Sorry but who still can't get over the bit that is left wouldn't stay in the game for long anyway and thus shouldn't be preferred over a lot of people that already play the game.  
---
P.S. link lossmail
---
Wow great post! I agree the heatmap isn't perfect, but the main intention of the heatmap is to give you a general idea of when an entity is active. In the current form it definitely does that.
---
I do like your logarithmic idea, and I'm going to +1 that to put it on my list.
---
I would love to! But I don't want to start making assumption and then CCP actually fixes the killmail thus making my assumptions wrong! The onus is on CCP to fix the number of fighters in the killmail, not a third party tool.
---
I’m dumb I see now
---
Sorry that you don't want to lose the player base that doesn't want to drop supers and titans every 26 minutes
---
Is there a way to get more accurate prices for Faction capital hulls that get blown up, like the Chemosh.
---
I dunno, I'm enjoying the mismatched voice to mouth visuals and the voice actors who don't really seem to put the same level of effort into the dub. 
---
It's like the voice actors were shown an overly cartoony animated version while recording
---
I wish! Unfortunately the market for faction hulls can be crap at times, I should look at maybe implementing the contract system, although at this moment I'm not sure if that's any good either for something like the Chemosh.
---
This game is best played with friends, I'd suggest joining a newbie corp that's not a massive blob. Red vs Blue is very PvP-focused, Eve University is more theory-based but they're incredibly good at what they do, AK.S in Apocalypse Now is part of Provibloc who are very anti-PK.
---
You will die a lot as a beginner, but with good friends around you you'll recover fast and get into this amazing game. You're already doing so well to have tried so many things.
---
That is for zTackleboard :)
---
You genuinely think it's harder to click a cyno button and cry for help on comms than it is for the 'lazy gangs' to do route planning, fleet composition, try to maintain intel with maybe 2-3 ceptor alts, d-scan hostiles, get on grid, get tackle...? What a funny joke.
---
I don't know if you've noticed but capitals aren't great fast-moving roaming ships. I've done my fair share of dread bombing from NPC null and it's fun, but it doesn't beat a fast-paced roaming gang. Again, multiple viable playstyles is a good thing.
---
How much time does this take you once you practice your craft to regularity?
---
It’s not bad, it’s just a LOT of work, and most engines don’t support it. So it’s left almost entirely up to the developer to implement, on a code base that isn’t theirs. So that comes with a lot of technical debt by itself. 
---
Then, on the server side - it’s not so much bad. It’s just a question of how much speed increase will it get that map reduction / other paradigms can’t because, truthfully, it’s very rarely a lack of threading that’s your bottleneck
---
Probe and seed my warm hole
---
OK this is well drawn I have to admit.
---
More than I'd like, honestly. 
---
Yes, removal of cap cynos would hurt JF logistics, especially for far-flung reaches of the galaxy. Players would adapt because the profits for deep space smuggling would be pretty crazy.
---
lemme roll that hole with my plated carrier
---
Now everybody warp to the dance floor.
---
Still needs to be done on CCP's side if done at all.  Also I don't think it needs to be done.
---
Clearly you didn't play back in 2003/2004 when session changes were a minimum of 30-60 seconds.
---
Or half a squad, since it would tend to average out in that case.
---
But it's impossible to get it right.
---
Give us back the way ECM worked in gemini.
---
Start with drivers, disk checks and run memtest86. 
---
I just had this happen coupled with a constant ccp.exe has stopped working error. Turns out after weeks of screwing with drivers, I ran memtest86 and found a severely bad stick of ram. Changed that out and I’ve been good ever since. 
---
Other games were giving me access violations and surprisingly I didn’t have any seemingly related blue screens. I blue screened once like 6 months ago and haven’t had a repeat since so I dismissed it. Windows 10 is a tricky bastard and hides those blue screens well or I was just unlucky. Either way I’m glad it’s fixed.
---
where is all the fellow scotsmen on this one. it was warm as fuck last week as well!
---
You need a longer self esteem
---
The joke being there's a sequel to a movie called The Conclusion.
---
I think that repeated use of the splitting process is going to have a greater cost than you expect. 
---
Anchoring on the FC means you're bumping into loads of ships, which each are bumping into other ships. That itself is hard to split, assuming it's even possible to do so.
---
Well u can plex easily within that month and never have to spend no money on omega again
---
Aaaaand everybody just scrolled back up
---
Don't we all?
---
Only if your name is Yonis. Can be accidentally primaried when we shoot at actual Yonis.
---
What is the most efficient solution to the All Points Shortest Path problem? 
---
Suppose I have a graph `G = (V, E)`, and I need to find shortest path of `V_i` to `V_j`, for *every* possible `V_i` and `V_j`.
---
How many lines of code?
---
Lots of good info here.  Basically eve must be taught for you to be successful.  It’s going to take a long ass time for you to just trial and error you way to success.  
---
Find a noob Corp.  you don’t have to stay forever, but that’s how you learn the game
---
New Weebden.
---
Eve shall finally be purified of the weeb taint
---
You can also follow conflict zones in null and pick up drones/loot from fights. If you are careful it can be good money
---
Ty
---
I too, love increasing my sig radius and reducing the time it takes to be locked
---
Confirming that meme fit nereus is a decent option
---
Here's how you play eve.
---
Log in, find the biggest group of players you can, join them.
---
Next, use only ships and fits they tell you are good.  This game has widely varied and comprehensive ship fitting and hull variability?  Screw all that don't look at it ever, someone else is better than you at doing that so just close your mind and listen to them.
---
Third, make sure you dont play unless at least half a dozen guys are willing to play with you, or on the other hand, you have half a dozen alts ready to help you on your "solo" experience.  You'll probably need the alts for pve later so might as well get started on them early. 
---
Now last, and this might be most important, but check r/eve at least daily to check and see what the eve player base is angry at today, so you can blame all the bad times you're having on the game killing problem of the week.
---
Disclaimer: You probably shouldn't listen to any of my advice.
---
Nobody is against pvp dude. Geez you guys really try hard to be an ass. So eve sucked before, and it sucks a little less now. And it took them more than a decade to come here. Player count is lower because of CCPs snail-like progress for fixing things. 
---
Don't be a bitch and accept your failures. Just because you had a shitty experience when you were a noob does not mean others should too. Try to have some sympathy. I know that is just asking too much from a bittervet but try.
---
Ahh race conditions.
---
hi there and welcome to EVE.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
im sure many people including me can say that youre a unusual newbro ;) youve experience more content than the average newplayer does in months. but none the less its sad to hear youre not enjoying your time while playing eve. while im sure many including myself can relate to your issues. EVE is very much a waiting game at the start. as your enjoyment out of content is usually always linked to skills. i found once i had my core skills all to 5. i was enjoying the game more and more as i was able to get more out of my ships. which then lead into solo pvp.  
---
for me when i first started playing i got into mining and industry only to quit about a year later. i came back when the game went F2P. and decided to switch it up. i used the starter pack i picked up off steam to get started on a new character and start fresh. and it was instantly into low sec. making isk in low sec was hard as hell. you where pretty much reliant on exploration to get your first set of income. i had been in lowsec for nearing 8 months or so before getting my first real taste of null with mercenary coalition. and from there on out it was probably the most fun ive ever had in eve period!  
---
we all know how hard it can be to get yourself up off the ground and start to really enjoy the game. but personally i think for a good majority of people would agree on this and as my advise to you would be. is to search out a new player friendly corp. most notable in nullsec if youd like to have more options when it comes to ISK income. as well as branch out your knowledge and understandings of game mechanics etc. its then up to you if youd like to stay or move on!  
---
you can choose from a plethora of corps/alliances like EVE uni, Brave, Pandemic Horde, Test, Goonswarm etc etc. they all have people willing to help and guide you as well as answer any of your questions. EVE is a game of patience. that or you spend alot of money for space cocaine (skill injectors) and instantly boost your character into many ship types with all your core skills learned.  
---
try get your engineering skills maxed out ASAP. and if youre having trouble with isk. depending on your skills. low sec exploration might still prove valuable as difficulty for cracking relic sites isnt all that hard.  
---
i hope this helped in some way and we hope to see you in game o/
---
the logic as i understand it (I dont remember where I got this from, read it a long time ago) Is that Gallente ships are more automated and have far fewer crew, to the point that like a Tristan can run with just a capsuleer.
---
quit, uninstall, be happy, thats all there is to it
---
Burn Jita doesn't 'function as normal', since in the more recent years alphas have been a huge part of that. You can't multi-box alphas without risking a ban.
---
I wouldn't play in an Eve 2 or an Eve Classic. 
---
Just don't have that spare time. Got a job, and a partner. Life has moved on from back when I was a university student with loads of nothing-to-do.
---
"I understood that reference"
---
Unsubbed/Isk rich... looks good to me
---
AT least they are honest about the purpose of their coalition.
---
Is... is this... is this sarcasm?
---
You really don’t know what you are talking about right? You can’t use more then one alpha account on a pc! If you get ganked by someone with multiple accounts these are probably omegas ;)
---
You play by the rules that exist.  If you wanna make up extra ones on your own that others don't have to follow, there's a word for that, Scrub.
---
"  Currently high sec gankers exploit the alpha system by creating infinite amounts of catalysts ganking alts to multi-box."   
---
Then CCP should just ban them because operating more than one alpha account at a time is against the EULA. Why change game mechanics when you can just enforce the rules?
---
High Sec Ganks are older than Alpha accounts.  This change would achieve nothing.
---
So dust
---
It's almost like the largest corp in our alliance is named reddit.
---
Nullsec has become an empty wasteland of dotted by pockets of hyper-densely populated mostly by super capitals. It is the complete opposite of what Nullsec was like a few weeks after Phoebe launched i.e. when "fozziesov" first went live but crucially before citadels launched, but when the original force-projection limitations were still in effect.
---
Small groups in nullsec are now effectively extinct, they either need to go to into the \*relative safety\* of wormhole space or quit the game. I have no contact with WH space so I don't know for sure but ti seems the latter is the more popular choice.
---
Pity, because that aside I personally am LOVING the local blackout, but I do own a super and am in a mega-coalition.
---
I'd say less than an hour. Longer if you want motion tracking.
---
Well, for starters the more common term is the All *Pairs* Shortest Path Problem, but you wouldn't care about proper terminology since you're just a prick on the internet who thinks he's smarter than everyone else.
---
But to humour you, the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm works well in dense graphs, doing it in O(|V|\^3) in worst-case, best-case, and average conditions. As for how many lines of code to implement it: fuck you, pay me. I'm under no obligation to write a pathfinding algorithm for a random moron on the internet.
---
It's worth noting that while F-W does give good average performance, Dijkstra's Algorithm works better for sparse graphs assuming your edge weights are positive, as does Johnson's Algorithm which allows for negative edges.
---
Might have to try it then
---
There's a ton of ways to address this.
---
Number one, of course being fix the bug so we don't need session timers at all.  It's a horrific band-aid.
---
But barring that, every one you can eliminate or make shorter helps.
---
Compare it to page load times in web development.  A one second load time is atrocious.
---
I'll disagree with this heavily. Grinding for isk to continue plexing is definitely not the way to get the most out of a single month of Omega. Unless you really *enjoy* PVE, don't do this.
---
What do you like doing OP? I'd suggest training skills towards that gameplay style, in skills that will still apply if you go back to Alpha status.
---
I see you are a man of Permaband, as well.
---
Haha, are you taking your training clone in there?
---
God help you if you have to stash your clone somewhere other than your ship location.
---
PM me your ingame name and ill throw ya some space money
---
or how about you stop being a mouthbreather and blaming your failures on others. just because you're retarded doesn't mean the game needs to be changed according to that. there are far more important issues in the game that need to be fixed and lose it more players. the fraction suicide ganking really makes up is abysmal.
---
also as someone else in here already said:
---
&gt;New Eden is a harsh place, people should learn that as soon as possible. 
---
if you want a game that holds your hand, don't play eve. that has nothing to do with bittervet or new player, that has something to do with how the game fundamentally works.
---
Hahahaha I didn’t notice it when I first watched it.
---
Bring back Steve the docking manager
---
He could do this for an hour a day for 20 days and plex then he could do whatever else he wanted without having to pay for omega or worrying about not being able to use skills
---
This problem was solved for me by leaving a null megablock corp and joining a corp living in a wormhole.
---
I couldn't help but read this in a voice as if I was from Alabama
---
Hmm never seen that.
---
&gt;Meh, doing pve doesn't prepare you for pvp at all. 
---
When you're learning the basics like how to warp, making bookmarks, and using your overview it does.
---
&gt; high sec alpha multi-box gankers  
---
such as ?
---
An hour a day sounds terrible honestly. Playing to plex, especially at low sp/newbro levels of Eve is painful and skyrockets your chances of burning out. If he likes PVE or sees the value of Omega worth it, by all means go for it.
---
I like Signal Cartel. I'd be very interested in joining you guys, but I also like PVP.
---
Well to each his own but I see your point an hour in fleet coms goes by extremely fast so it’s not just afk stuff
---
Jin'taan has been doing nullsec updates on his youtube channel, so that might be a good place for you to look.
---
&gt; rely on the same members to show up for fleets all the time. 
---
Unlike every other alliance, right?
---
I can give them some hints.  First of you ping everything as a MAX MAX ULTRA MAX CTA that stops meaning anything.
---
If TEST pinged that under a known FC right now, we'd fill three fleets in five minutes.  People would drop what they're doing because we don't get more than one of those pings every couple years.
---
Second, if we say something like "we're going to double logi srp" then we *actually* do that.
---
Those two are free.
---
Blackout: CCP has removed local chat from null security space. That's it.
---
The Invasion: In highsec, some systems are taken over by the Triglavians. It's similar to a Sansha incursion, but I gather that unlike the highsec Sansha incursions, Triglavian invasions will eventually find you and kill you if you idle afk on a gate.
---
I keep trying to find the one where the main guy dances into a tent and I guess starts a meeting in the typical musical fashion?
---
and BTW, post your lossmail
---
This made me laugh entirely too much.  :)
---
&gt;but don't expect decisions to be made (now of all times) for the health of the game - they're for the success of the deal.
---
A healthy game would drive higher subscriber and log in numbers making it easier to hit whatever metrics they need to get the full paycheck. But given Hilmar's continuous demonstration of his inability to understand simple concepts over the past decade I wouldn't expect him to figure that out.
---
I've been ISK-Halving for years.
---
This guy gets it.
---
&gt;"yeah we run 8 hour ustz marathons 
---
That was Elo, not TEST.
---
I'd recommend carrying a flight of each. You should have the drone bay to support it. Then you can swap loadouts if the situation demands it. In *general*, I think you'll find yourself using the heavies, so if you're wondering which to skill into first that's definitely the one to go for.
---
&gt; I like to use WoW as an example. You couldn't start playing today and enter a max level raid by next week. 
---
Step 1: Buy $60 boost to previous expansion's max level.
---
Step 2: No-life your way up for ten levels and unlock world quests.
---
Step 3: Either pray to the Random Number God that your world quests give you gear that allows you to meet the minimum for LFR difficulty (since that's easy mode, pretty much) or get into a guild (or A Reddit Dystopia's public runs if they're still doing that) that does it on Normal difficulty since that's still pretty easy.
---
It's like any other competitive internet team game.  You go up 2-0. Someone on the enemy team leaves.  Then suddenly it's not fair because you have more people.
---
Yeah, they left because they were losing.
---
Set yourself a PVE goal and go for it. Every PVE task carries some reward, so at the end of the day they are all "just making more money". However, that doesn't mean you have to do them for that reason, nor that you have to optimize your isk/hr.
---
I fly Endurances into hostile space and mine their moon goo. This is far lower isk/hr than killing sleepers in my home wormhole, but I do it anyway because I enjoy it.
---
For you, abyssal sites (mentioned in the other reply) might be a good challenge. DED sites could also be good, or you could go hunting for an Officer. I hear pirate faction burner missions require a decent amount of skill to complete and are also quite valuable.
---
Nice fanfiction
---
Get yourself a friend. A public hauling corp is going to have the same concerns about the lowsec as the open market of hauling contracts, they're just going to have the resources to calculate the added risk and pass the cost on to you. Your friend knows you aren't out to backstab them, and so is able to work for much cheaper.
---
[deleted]
---
I enjoyed this totally real story
---
&gt;This seems like a unintended mechanic
---
No, it is a 100% intended mechanic.
---
Also, link lossmail.
---
Classic anyone. 
---
Unless if some random neutral whose alliance you had fought not even that long ago convoes random member of your alliance's fleet and asks "can I DD that rorq over there you guys are shooting" and then proceed to do just that... your alliance honours that "agreement" and let the titan go.
---
But then you are in the minority.
---
There are quite a few. What size are you looking for? Do you have a wormhole class/statics in mind? What activities are you looking for? (Do you want to hunt out of a nullsec static? Do you want to bear all day in a C3 static with your solo Rattlesnake? Do you want to get into wormhole capital brawls? etc)
---
This would remove honourable pod express from FW pvp
---
What's the question here?
---
Trick question. There's no such thing as multibox alphas since the EULA and the launcher prevent it. While you *could* use VirtualBox, you'd pretty quickly run into issues with resource usage.
---
Well, no one asked us for any help. Or got backstabbed. Just some weird neutral guy assuming that if he asked someone in a convo he is safe...
---
I would argue that if he's the type to get bored in two minute while going through Undocking 101, he might not be the best fit for EVE.
---
This is very much a slow burn game where you need to set your own goals and work towards them without a giant orange arrow guiding you to your next right click, where the next step of measurable progress might be weeks away, and where sometimes nothing happens.  It's God damn awesome, but it's pretty far from instant gratification and flash -- and thank fuck for that.
---
What fucking movie is this??!
---
An hour in fleet in incursions is simply not worth it, because you will probably spend more time for traveling to focus and waiting in queue
---
It took me 3 attempts over many years to finally get into EVE. It just seemed like so much waiting in skills before you could have fun.
---
Hey welcome the the list!
---
My brother is joining here in a few days. This is exactly what I’m going to do to him but I’m going to awox him with an alt. Thanks for sharing this.
---
Why did they hammer those tabs into the sides of the tree?
---
I know Molden Heath is often described as dead, but I don't know 'why' thats the case. Can some one explain?
---
Also a PVP tutorial in the little intro missions... then after some AI guide practice... have to go to the opposing faction newbie system and like... have a incursus vs kestrel or whatever 1 on 1 with another newbie... the winner gets 25 mil isk.
---
&gt; You really don’t know what you are talking about
---
Look pal, there are ways. Even if you're not the one guy with bunches of input broadcast alpha gankers, your one of the other guys who make alpha, gank, use omega to get swag and then when it doesn't work anymore trash alpha and remake, thus bypassing all the penalties for committing the act. 
---
But what do I know, I always get downvoted by npc level pvp players.
---
If you are being robbed, just ask them politely to stop. It's illegal for someone to take your belongings without your consent.
---
More
---
Thats not enough for most of the baddies
---
Of course it’s Input broadcasting.. alphas.. what’s next? Ganking bots?
---
Interesting - blackout must make a nullsec haulers job much harder. Relating to that - do cloaked characters show up on the local chat (before the blackout) ?
---
" Even if you're not the one guy with bunches of input broadcast alpha gankers "   
---
You should watch the streamer from CODE who occasional on stream flies a fleet of more than a dozen catalysts not counting, scouts, bumpers and scoop ships by hand. Input broadcasting is a lot less popular then the crybaby people dying to catalysts think it is.
---
I rewinded and paused it a few times just to read it
---
Reddit would loose their minds about how OP some ships used to be.
---
Can you please add a total count in the header for number of supers and titans on the /supers page?
---
Do you have proof that these are alphas?
---
Last week called, they want their killmail back.
---
Another option would be to change the number to represent number of ppl involved in kills rather than number of kills
---
Also true. I guess it'd need to be limited pretty severely just like standard bpc "max run".
---
Jump clones and u always leave your ship at the current incursion site
---
http://www.verite.space/maps/influence/20141011.png
---
True it was actually only really 2 main groups. But jump fatigue did more damage to that then entosis sov ever did.
---
Its not really much of a discussion when all you say is "Thats incorrect" just because you dont actually have anything else to say to counter what I have said. 
---
Something one person has 'seen' doesn't really reflect the actual state of the game.
---
i had no idea this existed lol
---
Good to see Hull Pen is still garbo.
---
Warm if hole.
---
If you have unallocated skillpoints. It won't matter if you're alpha or omega when you use them. The distribution is the same. It only matters if you want to train omega skills. 
---
As for what to do... I'd do what you enjoy. Plexing the game is a huge waste in my opinion. But if you enjoy plexing to just play more by plexing than go ahead. But the real fun comes in working together. Fleet ops. Fleet pvp. Fleet pve. 
---
Even a tiny ewar ship can have a huge impact and is crazy fun to run in fleets.
---
&gt; The movie is called Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. And this is one of the more moderate fight scenes. It's on Netflix.
---
A scout is more useful than a scort, for a hauler. That's the only way a newbie could help in that field, at least as far as I can think. 
---
Regarding nice profits, try exploration. Relic sites in low, null and w-space can net you up to a hundred million a site, and you can run them with minimal investment on ships or skillpoints. Fit an exploration frigate, scan down sites and wormholes, and hack the cans for nice loot. 
---
You will die, but if you do it right, your ships will pay for themselves really quick.
---
Not either group but it looks like someone just tried to dread bomb a super or something
---
I saw someone suggest being able to do Project Discovery on mobile on a thread about Echoes. I personally have a really shit phone with a cracked screen that I don't even use as a phone, but I bet people with bigger phones or tablets would be able to get pretty accurate analyses done for PD. 200k ISK for helping science while I'm taking a shit? Sign me the fuck up!

Snuffed out got Snuffed out I guess.
---
Maybe like an outdated future map of Eve with plans for a lowsec gate to stain
---
There are better options than F-W and Dijkstra... which are not on the Wikipedia page that you've quietly looked at. 
---
Either your claim of 'a reasonably trained professional can solve any problem in no time with a few lines of code' is rubbish, or you're tacitly communicating that you're not a reasonably trained professional.
---
&gt; Eve University is more theory-based but they're incredibly good at what they do, 
---
I'm kind of hoping that more of us will start running practical exercises too.
---
haha
---
IT'S A TRAP! HE'S TRYING TO TURN YOU FURRY!
---
I don't remember the exact numbers but you need at least 7 Gankalysts to destroy a Procurer in highsec.
---
This means either seven people willing to go to where you are and take the standing hit, or one person 7-boxing(after previously trained, i.e. paid for, the characters)
---
**Literally no one will be bothered to actually do this.** It's just way too much time and effort.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
this almost looks like a Bovril production, but they tend to be a better job with the subtitles.
---
And clearly, the Tempest can run with a crew of 3.
---
What is this??? I don't speak furry.
---
almost no event utilizes alphas other than burn jita
---
&gt;You will also be called a krabber for a while until you figure out it's just best to skip high sec and low sec all together and join a bigger group in nullsec.
---
Yeah just drop some real life cash to inject up a Rorqual alt and then inject up a cap/super alt for some ultimate space Jewing.
---
that 800x600 res looks sweet
---
Gotta crawl before you walk. Gotta walk before you run. Or some such.
---
So it's even easier in EVE since you just buy a lot of PLEX and then use it to get injectors AND the gear.
---
A limited engagement will allow podding.
---

If EVE Classic would really kill current EVE, then current EVE deserves to be killed.
---
What game can't stand up to its predecessor from over 10 years ago? A shit one that doesn't deserve to live.
---
&gt; You get Classic EVE by fixing all the stupid bandaid features
---
Yeah, but CCP won't do it, so...
---
Just like Blizzard won't "fix" current WoW.
---
Jesus!
---
Highsec pvp mechanics blow my mind. Saving your comment for later.
---
Wasn't there so no AAR from me, but it was the online timer of a Snuff Astrahus.
---
&gt;Either your claim of 'a reasonably trained professional can solve any problem in no time with a few lines of code' is rubbish
---
Of course it's rubbish. *I never claimed it was true*. In fact, ***I explicitly criticised other people for believing that.***
---
That was the literal point of my statement.
---
Also, congratulations, you have more experience than a first-year CS student. Good job. Have a gold star. I'm sure you feel *very* good about yourself.
---
Honestly, that would be as useful as telling someone that water is wet. If someone doesnt know what wet is, then it wont matter.
---

---
I found that getting your wife pregnant, while finishing a degree, and having your gaming PC HD go tits up is very effective at reducing your eve time.  Give that a try.
---
Might have to check this out, warm hole diving is a good hobby of mine.
---
Escort, scout, same thing sometimes. Escort 1 jump ahead on your route in an orthrus or something else good at killing tackle. To make it all actually profitable and more risky, get more expensive loads for your buddy to haul. Be elite and have him flying a BR for max safety and doing super high risk courier contracts. Just don't go crazy and risk too much isk.
---
Join the Hauler's channel, you can advertise your new elite combat courier service!
---
Do not give up. They way that you are already playing, it means that you will be a great player/PVP'er one day, believe me.
---
The amount of stuff that you already did in such a low amount of time, its already bigger than many people that play this game more than a year.
---
Some shit will still be happening, but i bet that you are learning very, very fast.
---
Think about the (amount of learning)/(invest time) that you already got there. Seems to be a lot, after some more invested time, you will see how things works and start to take advantage for you.
---
Eve is learning, dont give up!
---
If you are really about give up after some time, please, call me here, i will help you!
---
This is one of the worst aspects of the Eve UI. Cumbersome and lacking in many basic features. CCP really needs to iterate the order management interface, as it's impossible to do any serious market gameplay without third party apps.
---
Omega skills disable once you are back on alpha.
---
Ahh. My apologies. Your original wording had me interpret it entirely backwards.
---
It really depends on how you make isk. Many methods allow isk making at a rate that beats low paying jobs.
---
Ok, that I get it, I really do, but what I don't understand is why is it that CCP is creating so many failed projects like Dust514, Project Legion, World of Darkness Online, Sparc, Gunjack, Gunjack 2: End of Shift, Eve: Valkyrie and not dedicate those resources toward making something like Eve Online 2 (even if it's only for core programming) to get rid of the legacy code for a more maintainable code? It seems like they have priority wrong and not putting in more of their focus on Eve Online. If any game deserves an upgrade, Eve Online is it, because all of the other projects failed or not produced the same income that Eve Online provides.
---
This is the one thing that bother me so much that I stop playing Eve Online for years, CCP really need to sit down and fix Eve Online, it simply have too many bugs and crufts.
---
My point exactly.  
---
"Ebil gankers multiboxing alphas" is a boogeyman.
---
IT'S A TwAP! HE'S TwYING TO TUwN YOU FUwwY! uwu  
---
 tag me to uwuize comments uwu
---
You see now uwu
---
&gt; But what do I know, I always get downvoted by npc level pvp players.  
---
You get downvoted because you pull "facts" out of your ass.  
---
Join CODE or Miniluv, get to know all major players on ganking scene.  
---
They all are very wealthy and successful players.
---
&gt; So what, does it mean I can't play in low sec if there is someone in my local because It could potentialy be a stealth PK ? Sounds fun.
---
No, it means learn how to keep track of others around you and evade capture, which IS fun.
---
You being a debbie downer about it doesn't change it.
---
&gt; Do I need to spend 95% of my time running from people that just want to kill new players ?
---
No, they don't care if you're new. You're another ship, so they want to destroy it. That's EVE.
---
Nobody is out to get YOU, they are just out to get fights. If you choose to leave highsec you are fair game to be killed by anybody that wants to (hell in highsec to, but the threshold for effort is much higher).
---
But nobody is out to get new players, such behavior is bannable. Dumb inexperienced, illprepared players are fair game though.
---
You stay hydrated and in the shade as much as you can...
---
&gt; max level stuff isn't gated
---
Well, some of it has gates.
---
Te rest has wormholes.
---
Terrorist Watch List? I assume you got on that the minute you downloaded the Eve Client?
---
PVE doesn't require any of that.
---
Just warp and drop drones.
---
Nah WBVB is still in tickle. As of a roam last night.
---
Before the blackout, cloaked characters would show up in local, yes.
---
Honestly, the gameplay, for a mobile game looks pretty good.
---
It'll be about the universe and how mechanics work in the larger scope that make it interesting.
---
Lol. 
---
No.
---
I'm always impressed by people who manage to haul with normal freighters through null sec.
---
I've never heard anything about hunting new players being bannable.
---
Yeah but that is actually how half of Eve plays.
---
Nah splinter group of post DT guys that live out there because reasons
---
Yeah didn't we go a fairly long time with no sales?
---
Yeah, competition.
---
I'm pretty sure it would be a cancerous grind in one way or another, even with no tidi.
---
Tama
---
Second this, good guys and yeah all over NPC null
---
&gt; Angel Titan that they’ve got cloaked up in a well known lowsec system
---
Where did this come from, anyway? I've seen it several times before but - this being the internet - I can't tell if it's just a gag or the result of some CCP dev dangling hints in front of us like candy.
---
Yeah but if something is being botted, it's price will collapse. Unless it's isk via rats, then inflation.
---
Tempest is great for "kitey" fits or buffered fits, but the maelstrom for fits that require big active tanks
---
I learned the best way to help them is not to help them. Let your friend finish the tutorial and career agents and give him some hints on the different professions. He has to decide what is fun for him or if this game is nothing he wanna play forever.
---
Sure: tips and tricks at the beginning are okay. but dont throw everything at  him. its just TMI and the most stuff doesnt care in the early stages. i brought five friends to eve: 1 left after i rushed with him through all the stuff he needs to know... not because i told him the stuff: but he had nothing to discover and no real motivation since i told him what he needs to know. i let the other 4 guys start the same way most of us started... without leading them into a direction and just answering what THEY wanted to know and not what i thought they need to know. We didnt even play together, just hang out on TS talking about our experiences. 2 of them followed me into nullsec.. not because they wanted to play the null-meta but because i was already there. we still play together and have some fun but they are not really dedicated at all. and the last two guys went their own ways with their own motivations: one is part of a WH group and one started to participate in the market war in jita.
---
So its a mixture of luck and the mindset of your friend if he stays to get someday a bittervet or leaves after the first experience outside of highsec.
---
To be honest, I'd like to see the end of the bpo system as we know it.  
---
The goals of an overhaul should be to preserve development assets as much as possible, create a more streamlined interface, create a more responsive isk-sink, broadly increase utilization of the system by players, and of course to encourage conflict and competition by other means.  
---
To this end, I would propose eliminating the BPO as a "physical" item ID in the inventory.  To that end, simply roll it into the industry interface as a "blueprint subscription," licensed by the empire corporations.  That makes it simply a part of a drop down menu for eligible users.
---
The subscription rate on the blueprint would scale based on the number of subscribers, giving a dynamic, recurrent isk sink.
---
Creating of BPCs would essentially constitute IP fraud, and only be allowed in low security systems.  BPCs can still be transported as inventory items, and utilized by players without valid licenses.
---
Research would be sublimated into upwell structures, improving them not simply with one-time resources, but allowing them to further burnish their specializations over time.  No advanced research benefits will be available in NPC stations, except by using BPCs.
---
A nice complementary change to this would be to allow non-global market slots in every structure a manufacturer visits.  That would help populate the other thousands of underdeveloped markets across the cluster.  So would linking invention to metacide, but I digress.
---
I'd be happy to work on the mobile layout, tried to get local dev setup but got stuck and gave up a while ago. LMK if you need help, happy to do it as long as I can get local running :D
---
Ikr, dsts and brs are the shit! For wormhole logistics i like one of those dualboxed with a loki.
---
You just desynched yourself and cant do anything. Everything you tried to do that required a server interaction failed.
---
Looks like CCP has speed up the alpha because a competitor is also releasing their space Sim soon (Second Galaxy)
---
Lose all my skills, ships, and ISK that I've put in this game?

That's going be a hard no.

If CCP sees this post, please for the love of god upgrade the system so key words don't ping you unless they are specifically their own word or you've used a wildcard such as "\*vas\*".

Heard Delve is pretty nice this time of year.
---
That is right. Looks like the UV map there is not fully flattened.
---
Nope, time to change your main.
---
You can live nomadically outta your ship from wormhole to wormhole for explo and hunting
---
SPECIFICALLY hunting new players, meaning killing players in new player systems, is bannable.
---
Even activities specifically designed to target exclusively new players outside those systems has occasionally hit up against the GMs.
---
But mostly, outside of those systems, its hard to distinguish, but also, people don't target new players, because new players aren't hard to trick, and they have nothing of value.
---
You'll be more successful learning how the game works (and how to exploit it) and then acting on that rather than coming in with your preconceived notions and trying to execute them.
---
I'd recommend joining one of the large newbie corps.  Dreddit, Brand Newbros, Brave Newbies, Karmafleet, or Pandemic Horde.  Go on fleets. Figure out what you want to do within their framework. Learn how the game works, and after that you might see opportunities to do stuff on your own or as a small group.

You can combine pvp and pve at the same time. You can roam low sec in a T3D or cruiser while checking d-scan, killing any clone soldier rats or NPC haulers, or running  DED sites. Or you can hunt explorers in a combat Astero while hacking. Or join FW and complete plexes. The isk/hr is decent for these activities (50m-150m per hour), while you get to enjoy some kills.

Snuff dropped an Astra in Dek during EUTZ (for content I guess?). Snuff with a few other friends brought dreads, nightmares and some bombers for the onlining timer. Dead Co out formed them (being a jump from our staging) but Snuff and co took the fight anyway. Goodfights were had, props to Snuff for taking the fight.
---
... we had mines and they took them from us?? I feel robbed wtf that sounds great
---
Isk is like $2/b firesale $3/b when not. What job does $1 an hour beat? If you use plex prices from CCP it's not even good because they set their shit to compete with the black market through sales/packages.
---
You would need to bot a substantial amount of accounts to have a living wage in any country that somehow found a 15 yo niche game and even still your kids will starve because you botted niche uncertain future game instead of Path of Exile.
---
Imagine botting 7 accounts for 3 weeks so you can afford 1 dinner in iceland. 
---
For this reason I disagree. The last time I could maybe see it was few years ago when isk was $6+ per billion on the black market. 
---
The only method I can see competing is looting faction titan BPOS because 500m/h sure doesn't cut it
---
Wormholes
---
Which moba?
---
Your prospects of that are low, but there's a decent chance if you have the endurance to continue and venture deeper you'll

Imagine being in Avalanche *shudder*

i hope one day this would be the only EVE problem i can  talk about
---
I gotta be honest, whoever named the Sleipnir should be ashamed of himself, and everyone at CCP who is from Iceland should have corrected him. Named after the fastest horse in the Nine Realms, and the damn thing moves slower than some of my industrials do, going by the base max velocity.

"You can be attacked at any time while in space, by  capsuleer and non-capsuleer alike. - CONCORD"

Easy fix is to make you play alpha for a month two and then start injecting.  have some kind of means for learning how to fly with a little less grind.
---
No rail fits?  I miss Pete Fleet.
---
But then you realize that the other side brought slightly more, so you stand down claiming it was all part of the plan anyways.
---
U actually listen to the in-game music?
---
&gt; Isk is like $2/b firesale $3/b when not. What job does $1 an hour beat? If you use plex prices from CCP it's not even good because they set their shit to compete with the black market through sales/packages.
---
 So since English is hard, $2-$3 is the black market price. Through CCP you can get around nearly $5 per billion isk from a 50% off 'star package' . $24.99 for 1 month time + 2 MCTC + 500 plex
---
That's $2.50 an hour $3 at best if you make 500m isk an hour.
---
&gt; Many methods allow isk making at a rate that beats low paying jobs.
---
Practically zero methods allow isk making that competes with any popular economy based game, let alone a job with minimum wage. Same reason why the botting epidemic is overblown, you aren't feeding a family on  EVE realistically, too niche, too late.
---
The best way might be shading it based on a bellcurve type thing. The activity in top 25% is bright; median plus and minus 25% are medium; bottom 25% are dull.
---
Check the killboard, alot of blinged Marauders have been dying in the low class sites, because even the low class ones are dangerous. They are even dangerous to blitzing carriers (in lowsec duh) if you're not careful or are dumb enough to try it in a no tank blitzing carrier..
---
How do I set up that?
---
Well at least they will now put out the Alpha at the end of the month once there IS a competition
---
I agree. Buy your ganking permit at least.
---
Why are you talking about black market prices? Are you reocmmending this guy buy isk on the black market and then Plex his account that way?
---
That star package can only be bought once per account. So that's not really an applicable argument.
---
I hate you
---
I was going to slip in 'orca', but that'd be a whale of a killer pun
---
Aridia is better than Delve for marauding the NPCs who live in sov Delve.
---
Curse or Stain are pretty nice, I like Curse personally.
---
I think it's just a popular way to quit the game.
---
Saw those, and I'd love to see them in-game too.
---
I actually didnt realise CCP implemented this retarded shit that gankers can now use alphas. Wtf
---
Imagine flying a half/half arty fleet with only 22ish people then. Last i checked most faction battleships need at least like 30 to reliably alpha shit.
---
Arty abbys were cool in like what, 2011? Though with any arty comp you dont really run em unless you have critical mass + some to spare to alpha. Most pirate bs’s that are properly fit usually take 25-30ish to alpha, sometimes more.
---
Marauders are just bad in general.

---
&gt; Are you reocmmending this guy buy isk on the black market 
---
Are you suggesting my skin is black and you will judge me on that instead of the content of my mind?
---
Because it sounded about as dumb as the shit you just inferred.
---
As far as spending money for isk, it's a great argument because those sales directly compete with black market price; which is what killed any possible notion of people botting for a livable wage in EVE. 
---
Several such offers exist, I offered one example and it is comparable because people don't buy unlimited isk - they buy isk to plex that month first and foremost.  It's very much applicable.
---
Not in jita, they may warp to it to kill a suspect biter, but they do not camp it
---
Thanks :)
---
I suggest him to play on ROBLOX instead
---
&gt; Because it sounded about as dumb as the shit you just inferred
---
Of it's not what you're saying, then what does the black market have to do with the decision to Plex vs paying for a subscription?
---
That's what I'm getting at.
---
The black market price of isk is irrelevant to this discussion, but you came in here with that anyway.
---
Im not arguing against more information. But its like saying "youre going to die someday". We all know it but we dont comprehend it. 
---
And it still doesnt alleviate the fact that you can be attacked. If you dont know the rules, which you wont know if you are new, it just make it harder to get into the game. An almost completely safe zone will allow someone to atleast get into the game long enough to learn things about it.
---
delve is free content nearly 24/7
---
Very situational. I've seen Snuffed use them (months ago) but nobody else so far. They don't deal a ton of damage so if your enemies are in HAC fleets, which is common, then there's not much you can do.

Solo or small gang is a different story. Sniper fit petes are fun, especially to pick off tackle on the edges of someone else's fight.

3 days and you were in Hightsec, lowsec, Nullsec and wormhole space? Dude, you´re hardcore! I´ve spent my first 3 weeks in Highsec (and still died when I was gatecamped at a LS chokepoint).
---
The game has an insane learning curve and unfortunately dying is part of the experience. Its just annoying when you grind enough for a good ship and loose it an hour later. Try to get into a corp for questions and some basic protection. Do a week or two in Highsec, you are mostly safe there. Do missions and figure out in what direction you want to evolve. Then make your way to Nullsec. This space is usually even safer that HS and the real money lies there.

---
&gt; What does the black market have to do with the decision to Plex vs paying for a subscription?
---
The value of ISK, which you brought up by implying you could make comparable isk to a real life job, which only really rings true if you expect to pay $20 for 500 plex. People don't do this, they buy from sales to get 'value'.
---
Practically no methods do, and even than how many accounts do you want to imply the alpha to omega thread should need to turn his one alpha account into an omega. It seemed wildly disingenuous and not an opinion you want to get caught arguing.

There are 2 routes you can take here:

A) You go back to Alpha. In this case DO NOT TRAIN OMEGA SKILLS. Omega skills will disable when you switch to alpha. Omega ships can not be flown anymore. If you go with route A make up your mind what you want to do. Trading, Expolring, Ratting, PVP, whatever. Do not take the mining path. All worthwhile mining ships are Omega only. When you figured out what you want to do check for alpha fits for your purpose. When its PVP most major corps have alpha doctrines for several ships. Same goes for PVE and ratting. Copy the skill list, go omega, insert skill list and wait out the 30 days.
---
B) Path B means you want to stay Omega. In this case I still suggest you figure out what path to take. 
---
You now have to make up your mind: Will you pay for this game or not. You have the option to buy plex on the ingame market to buy your subscription with it. This means that you will have to earn a certain amount of ISK/month. For many players, especially casual players, this feels like a 2nd job sometimes. Your sole focus will be on earning the ISK and only doing the most profitable things. These things are not necessarily the things you enjoy most.
---
The other option would be paying the fee and having the liberty of doing what you ACTUALLY want without having to worry of meeting a certain isk goal. This also frees up plenty of ISK that can be used to buy better, more expensive ships and gear. If you have a stable, decently paying job I would highly recommend this path. Omega - to me - is very much worth it and and $15 a month don´t break my bank. But if you´re a student, have debt or a low paying job I can totally see why paying might not be an option to you.
---
Yes, this is exactly what happened in that mining chat after I said it. :P
---
Which ship combo would work better for C3 duo ratting: 2x RR Praxis or 2x RR Dominix? After doing some research people generally recommend Domi over Praxis but I don't understand why. I can get 1k+ dps easily with Praxis while I struggle to get over 600 dps with Domi. What am I missing?
---
isn't station trading a lot harder now after the tax changes?
---
The chat notifying you of key words? There's a gear icon in your chat window, set word filters.
---
5/7

damn, you made me log in to gank
---
Well, the Russians have been crushed several times. And Tranquility is already on the borderline of becoming a unipolar political atmosphere anyways, since Goons have already proven they can easily crush anything that stands in their way, alone. Not to speak of all the allies they could muster if they wanted to/needed to.
---
If the Chinese did make some kind of hyperpower megabloc akin to the DRF in its glory days, I actually welcome it. Cause let's be honest, right now the disparity in power is huge.
---
I think that becaomes too boring too fast best thing i think is like stuffed said join a corp do fun stuff together . I havent dont any missions after career
---
Don't make me drop an Obelisk on you
---
&gt; Along with logi kill marks.
---
Add it on the stockpile of things we were promised as soon^TM
---
They're so good Ishkur kiss you.
---
A neut on a ship that isn't supposed to brawl is often used as an anti-tackler measure, so it kind of makes sense in some contexts.
---
Seeing at that ship is seemingly fit for PvE, it makes no sense here.
---
Poitot
---
Well, remove it from the world filter then or untick "highlight in chat". You manually enabled both those options so you only have yourself to blame.
---
Well, less people in space, less targets, cyno fitted on all ships from myrm to carriers (and systematic drop ofc), NS blocs are getting more compact and harder to roam. Just the opposite of what the game actually needed.
---
Tbh after the drifters attacks and how it primarily affected big coalitions/alliances, I thought CCP was going to boost small groups and kill big ones by introducing ressource depletion in order to give incentives to spread on the map... but they did pretty much the opposite O\_o   
---
I wonder how the game will evolve if the BO was a permanent thing, I wouldn't be surprised if there's only fortress regions held by big blocs and nothing in between but an empty no man's land. 
---
I'd say the main good point is how it affects plex/injector prices, we'll see if the slope keep going down. But it doesn't really impact me, my subs won't be renewed except for my pvp main/alts that i'm paying in € anyway.
---
How do you lose to a hecate in a t3 missile ship? I don’t get it
---
A single alpha catalyst cannot solo gank a barge, even with implants, ive tried.
---
Awesome video, excellent  storytelling. Loved it, keep up the good work.

will we be able to advance search for half life 3?
---
This thread is a Procurer of puns, of course it was on porpoise! Although if we want more puns we will need an excavator to dig up more good ones
---
i think the wormhole stats takes it just past the line of acceptable in my eyes xD
---
be interesting to know what it had outside the wormhole. and im pretty sure i could get an impel to align quicker than a bustard with tank fit on both and still have more tank on the impel by a large margin.
---
purple aside. as theyre not available en-mass
---
Would be only a display thing. Multiply point calculation result by 10 before rounding it up and storing in the database. Divide it by 10 before displaying on the website. This way database / backend performance won't be affected.
---
An acumplishment... A... Revelation.
---
Don't let this meme distract you from the fact that we need a lowsec gate to stain.
---
Because of the math. Hecate sig radius is 75m prop mod off. Heavy missle explosion radius is 140m. This means that you deal 50% of your dps from the get-go. Also, dps on heavy missle is lower than rapidlight but has more range. So that loki prob could do 150 dps at best against him. While he does 600 dps to your anus.
---
i mean, im preaching to the dumb and specials here.
---
morals and honor are not rules made up by me eliteshitposter bro, 
---
and, fyi, scrub does not mean that. a Scrub would be an alliance who are too useless and pussyshit to standup for thier own structures inhisec alone, and without help from paying another group to assist them 24/7 xD
---
Don't worry, EVE-Central will back in September!
---
I know there is practical content too. E-Uni on your Corp history is considered a huge bonus by a lot of top corps.
---
Basically what Yonis said,   
---
I started out like 3 times before the game stuck to me. And the reason it stuck was, I was accepted into a tiny newbie corp with a couple of guys that where somewhat on my level of game experience. We had all the freedom to do what we wanted and so we moved into a WH the corp provided and had some fun on our own there. After a couple of months we moved to Nullsec, still keeping alt chars in the wormhole. We had a lot of fun, camping the HS entrance, trying to trap people who used our WH system to transit their haulers, killing newbros who went day tripping in our WH and such. Everyday is a new day and new adventures lie ahead if you got a small group of good guys playing and exploring the game with you. Just watching guides and playing on your own is only for a tiny portion of people.
---
Well it's not about solo is it.  You gank with a few catalysts.  So fine for solo but when you have say code just using throwaway alphas all day long then that bullshit
---
Well thats the thing, if you work in a group then yeah youre gonna wreck stuff, and rightly so. As multiple people are dedicating their time to the activity.
---
Not allowong safety red for alphas will train new players to fear loss, got enough whining hisec babies as is. Ccpl buff alpha gunnery skills

dude, he is playing on his Nokia 3310. That's rather nice for commuting on public transit.
---
From what I've heard, TEST has at times blacklisted us because it's pretty easy to get a spy alt in. But I've definitely seen a lot of ex-Uni people in respectable entities.
---
When someone says 64-bit they are talking about the size of addressable memory, not how big of a thing you can store.
---
You can have 64-bit integers on 32-bit systems.
---
But a 32-bit system has a limit to the amount of memory it can use overall (without some shenanigans).
---
And most 64-bit systems (from what I understand) use something closer to 48 bits to address (and not the whole 64 bits) at the moment.
---
Anyways, they probably just chose to use ints (most common variable size -- 32 bits) to store the 'quantity' of items in a stack. Considering that most things don't even come close to capping out 32 bits, they would essentially double the storage for *everything else* to deal with a few items being a bit too easy to obtain (if they used 64 bits for everything instead).
---
I think if Zkillboard and CCP work together? on a zkill blackout, i think the best options to be are.
---
* Allow player to 'go dark' and delay all killmails they get from posting for 1hour
---
This would allow roamers to 'go dark' and benefit from a blackout, and no one would know when or who is on this option.
---
What i get from what ive heard and read, if delaying killmails may assist the site to run better, what about a kind of points system. Where a certain type of player, lets say, somone with many recent kills? or many solo kills recently? gets thier zkill post quicker than somone who is quiet and not playing as much? almost as a reward style.
---
ill be honest i dont wish to delay zkill's posts on anything im involved in, but in what somone else is involved in? i dont mind ata all. i just love seeing the zkill kill layout of MY kills. if a roam gang near me had thier kills (and intel) delayed i really dont see an issue.
---
Oh nice, did no try logging in and then checking settings again. Thanks :)
---
The Evernus bitbucket repo is still up I think, so you could also build it for yourself.
---
Jesus check your notifications and mail.
---
I sponsored it btw
---
Printscreen too hard
---
Not my screen.
---
they paying me to use thier site? i mean, zkill works. how can you top that :D
---
I've noticed in other games that the most efficient way of getting people to keep playing a game is to let them learn how to do things by themselves first.
---
In eve I'd probably recommend them to try all of the career agents and then do the sisters of eve arc. Once they're done that and they still need guidance I'd guide them towards either trying out FW, Exploration (high/low at first but mention how much you can make in null/WH) or to do some highsec missions (I know it's boring but in case they don't feel comfortable with the combat system yet). I'd probably buy them the drug that gives you more standing just so they can get to level 3 missions faster because doing level 2 missions after sisters of eve is so demoralizing since the payoff in raw isk are so low. They might not be able to do the level 3 missions at first but they at least won't be forced to grind standing in missions that doesn't give you enough reward. While this is happening I'd talk about how much better the game is when playing with others and recommending that they should try finding a corporation.
---
Could be interesting, every day orso the route you need to take to get from your favourite mining system to your favourite refining/manufacturing system is random. Some days it's next to each other, other times it's an hour trip. And you'd only know if somebody has mapped that particular route before and given you the information
---
I set up "lit" , "420" etc so it always appears green. Didn't know people had a genuine use for the feature.
---
Run your motherboard’s memory test and diagnostic, reinstall your video drivers.

Install Intel Extreme Tuning Utility, and check your CPU is not overheating. Use Nvidia’s software to see if your GPU temps are ok.

Wow I didn’t even know.
---
So I’ve ran the Minor sites in a Leshak. CCC RIgs and full deadspace (C-Type EANM) single rep tank bar 1 Entropic Radiation Sink. 
---
The main problem is hitting the frigates (especially under weapon disruption) currently I am dual web and grappler. 
---
So, it is completely possible to run them in a Marauder, but you need to make sure that you can apply your damage and not get capped out easily. 
---
I am not at my PC but I will edit with a fit when i am so you have a point of reference
---
Hi guys! Is there any difference to play the game on steam instead downloading the client from the site? Thanks!
---
No I didn't, what's your point?
---
Eve is Harsh and Unforgiving. You need to be very skilled to play the game and you get this over time. weeks and months of time not days.
---
It took me 2months of living in lowsec to understand how lowsec works. what to do and not to do.
---
It took me 4months to learn what not to in Nullsec. (to get to a stage where my deaths are not often)
---
You will spend Months learning eve, its a rollercoaster with ups and downs. only to find that every turn has somthing you did not know.
---
Eve is not for everyone but you seem nice, and brave to do what your doing, so i hope you stay :)
---
I hate you.
---
Have you ever heard about **Print Scrn** button ?
---
They work extremely well against all kinds of sub-caps when fit with stasis lassoes.
---
i know, you know, even /u/ccp_falcon and /u/ccp_fozzie know about this, hell i bet even /u/CCP_Lebowski know about this issue, same as /u/ccp_paradox         
---
The real question is with all those people aware about this **WHY IS THIS STILL AN ISSUE!**
---
**sells/buys one item
---
Maybe, but look more like a SP farmer ...
---
medium booster, no extender, only a 10MN AB, 
---
do heavy missiles take THIS much power? like, where has all your power gone :D
---
Last seen every day two years ago
---
Ok so some ideas for 1 month omega.
---
* maybe try to get into an interceptor. and travel around nullsec. end up in goons space and die to a titan :D
---
* dont train any omega skills, unless you plan to stay omega, as when you go back to alpha they will not be accessible to you
---
* what do you enjoy, train things to level 5 on those things, as thats what you do the most.
---
* maybe grab a cloaky ship if not the interceptor. and try out covert cloaky thingys and spy on people MuwaHAHAHAHA and maybe kill them if theyre alone :D
---
have fun!
---
I wonder why furries aren't classified as zoophiles which is usually a criminal thing?
---
i've killed a prot with a svipul (and his griffin alt) and mach with a hecate .
---
it's just pvp vs pve fit most times
---
to be fair, many places earn less than 1$ per hour. maybe not USA, England, and i mean, some guy above compared money making to buying a meal in iceland (the most expensive place in the world to buy literally anything xD)
---
The big question is: Will Darkness drop supers again if snuff moves their own for the next timer if they do one?
---
You need to find people to play with, make friends, join an alliance/corp.
---
why would you be in the public "Mining" channel?
---
only 4 T2 catalysts to kill a max Buffer tanked Rokh? in hisec? damn thats crazy cos hell have drones too to take at least one down early
---
Squishy's Hecate fit probably does nearer 900 DPS. Blasters with void fit with hull tank. No way he's tanking that. And as you say the heavy missiles just wouldn't apply, the damage type of missiles wouldn't make that much of a difference, they just wouldn't apply.
---
My temps never pass 70 and already did my drivers
---
I didn’t realize the markets in stain were so competitive
---
Wow.. telling someone to skip on the fun part all together. Nice tips brother.
---
No, they earn money from the game, they should be investing some of that back into the companion app, not charging us for it. They could pay wall some features as omega only. The companion app could then be a marketing tool. You're in every eve players pocket now with this awesome app, sell em skins and cosmetics and Plex with it. Get people more engaged in coming event, keep em interested, keep em playing &amp; spending. A decent app is a marketing tool
---
Baahubali 1 was so much better than part 2 . I think Ramya krishnan was the mvp of Baahubali 1 . while i liked the flash back in part 2, the ending was as disappointing as Game of thrones ending.

Getting gangbanged is a really traumatic road into manhood in my opinion, but to each its own I guess.
---
Not when its throwaway free alpha ganks it's not OK.  Think about it.  We need to keep new players not keep having this HTFU attitude that clearly based on latest stats isnt retaining anyone.
---
Anyway we agree to disagree.
---
twitch emote
---
If I were to have one month Omega right now I'd start skilling into cloaking 4 and then scanning/archeology skills (don't bother with data sites and the hacking skill to begin with) and start doing null/WH pirate relic sites. Get an astero (not bother with cov ops).
---
This will give you enough isk to afford another omega before the month is out. If you only have one account you can do this quite easily. Just doing this a few hours a day for a week I made over 2B isk. My exploration skills are almost maxed out and I've done this for quite some time so don't expect that much isk but you'll most likely get enough to support omega for the next month. Your characters skills are only half of what matters though, learning different techniques on how do this matters at least as much as pure skills.
---
Pros of doing this: You get enough money to continue Omega and later make enough to support other endeavours. You get forced to learn how to fly in dangerous space and how to avoid dying. You learn how to scan down targets/anomalies more efficiently. You become more independent and it doesn't matter what kind of corporation you join and you can still make isk.
---
Cons: You have to dedicate some time skilling into skills you otherwise wouldn't make use of. They are not useless to have but most people probably don't bother with scanning skills until a lot later.
---
High Sec, not for the rest of your life. Just until you have a clue of what's going on. Which you won't get in 3 days of playing.
---
I don't understand it, may you explain me a little bit better please?
---
I mean, by working an extra hour at work I get 1.4 billion isk worth of PLEX (with current prices). I don't think stupid is the right word for people who can afford to buy plex for irl money.
---
Yeah don't warp from the keepstar straight to a gate, people are watching...
---
Of what, 3 years ago?
---
can someone start documenting trash stainguy posts and post statistics
---
vas ist das ?
---
ho yeah !!
---
got a slight chub when i heard "avatars shoot nightmares" then saw they were at 200km
---
Thanks!
---
I wasn't talking about buying plex. I was talking about buying these overpriced skins with plex you paid real money for.
---
Fc what is the broadcast window
---
That's as idiotic as saying weebs are pedophiles
---
Holy crap that’s a garbage fit
---
&gt; It hurts the people who do it since they **almost always** make bad mistakes and feed supers.
---
I assume you are talking about new'ish players, who inject? And not veteran players who quickly want titan or rorqual alts?
---
Do we know who uses the most injectors?
---
You're not connected to the server.  
---
Your idiot of a client couldn't read the "go back to the main menu" note.
---
Not really
---
Your profit just went down by 20-25%
---
It also depends on the items you trade
---
Clearly you have been playing a different game. Eve is filled with people putting way too much time and effort to kill a random guy.
---
I've done the same for 7 months.
---
Then I had a few really good days and exceeded the 301 market orders that my main could do and made a second trader.
---
Now my main buys things and the other Toon sells
---
What failures exactly? I haven't given you any, you are just assuming here. Doesn't make this one any less of a issue if there are others too. If it was that low, it wouldn't have appeared on the most upvoted steam review there.  
---
This isn't about lowering difficulty or anything, but you are too stupid to understand if you are still thinking like that after all that is said here. Griefing is just trolling in a game. And this makes new players quit before they commit and try the rest of the game. It is bad for the game, period. Now move along assbreather.
---
Buying the plex for in game money is the same as buying them for the skins. If the skins are still buyable on NES for plex you'll obviously choose the cheapest option, either sell plex and buy the skin for isk or just use the plex to buy the skin.
---
Can I bring a drake?
---
Top receiver according to this post.
---
If you do get a marauder, could you at least put some rare pirate faction ammo in it, please? I go through paladin killmails all the time and the stuff in the cargo just makes me think New Eden is full of bads that buy multi-billion isk ships, then use T1 ammo, don't carry more than one or two ammo types, and don't carry any "oh shit" boosters in with them.
---
Don't worry i'm not one of those.
---
Always booster and faction ammo and multiple types for different ranges and such :)
---
Join a group of people and ask them what they need. Every group needs a low skill profession like salvage, target painter, hauler,... There's a lot of low skill profession. Ans as a beginner you need to play with people to learn the game and compensate what you can't skill right now

Nah, that wont work, Evernus relied on its website for the API sign-ins
---
What weapon system are you using in the Praxis? Drones in the domi have the advantage that it's very easy to multibox. Warp to site, start your RR chain, keep at range 1 Domi from another and assign the drones from 1 Domi to the other. Then you can stay on the first Domi, without having to really care about the second.
---
Also, what range do you have on your Praxis and can it apply well to frigates? Some ships spawn 70+km away and want to stay 70km away from you at 680m/s. Either you burn to it with a mwd or you get weapons that can hit to 70km. But then that weapon system will have trouble applying to the frigates. 1000dps is only 1000dps if the sleepers are at your optimal amd have big signature radius
---
Heavy drones will take a bit of time to burn to 70km, but they can go there and apply well. Then, they can come back and apply that 600dps on the frigates too.
---
You can, but if you hit another player or another players drone you'll be concorded.
---
I remember I time when some mission runners discovered smartbombs, and Noble pirate would find them and cloak and fly next to them, and then loot the wreck after Concord had their way.
---
What was that dududu song again? I think it had something with sand in the title, that should be added to this.
---
Take your goddamn updoot and get out.
---
yeah no lol i dont even have a training clone lmao
---
because 5 dollar is reasonable
---
Ahh fuck yeah it’s highsec lol
---
Mobile game? Fuck, I was actually hoping competition would soon be real.
---
I’m fully expecting appropriate Impetus cosplay next Fanfest.
---
maybe take him on a NPSI T1 frig fleet? they are pretty fun, the comms are always friendly and he will probably get on a few kills while he get's a taste of the shakes.
---
Another tip would be to have a a different ult pull and sub contract to your main toon. That way the cargo is double wrapped and they can’t cargo scan the items for a gank. and if it’s a bait contract they can’t just set you main to red standings and wait for you on a gate.
---
Wait...
---
Why? That star is smaller than the Sun (in radius, but let's assume also in mass) so it should "live" longer, and since our star could last a total of about 10 billion years those numbers sound at least possible.
---
Ooh my home. You should visit alachene.
---
Apparently I've been playing too much Slay the Spire recently because the title's implied meaning is not my first association with the word "draw" right now.
---
Doxxed
---
The star with the oldest known age in the Milky Way is 14b years.
---
You can't multibox alphas.
---
Buy a stack of T1 frigates and join faction warfare. Let guys in the FW chat know you are new and they'll make sure you get on fleets and start learning the ropes (as far as FW goes at the least).
---
You're still going to die a lot at first. You need to accept that as part of the game. Been playing over a decade and I still die a lot.
---
Interesting fact! But just as our star, the Milky Way is a fairly young galaxy; afaik all what I said before is just theoretical knowledge.
---
We do not have any clue which part of the universe the EVE wh was connected to
---
Why? Epic historical movies are a good thing.
---
Give them your credit card, I'm sure they're legit.
---
&gt;Many sources of isk can crest 1b/hr and some crest over 3b/hr.
---
But you can't do that for 8 hours, you also need time to set up in most cases.
---
EVE timeline states more than twenty thousand years from now.
---
And afaik there are far older galaxies than our own, but you might have a point there. Will have to read about it tbh.
---
Hey, I've been looking into other ways of making isk by incursions but have no idea how to get into fleets or groups for them
---
Is EveMarketHelper the same guy as EveMarketeer? Confused because link didn't match title of post.
---
You raise an interesting point, there is a drive currently to remove perfect remote intel, this would fit into the general concept.
---
there are a number of ways to deal with the issue.
---
1. the black out concept.
---
2. delayed data updating
---
3. variable (random) data updating
---
and
---
4. unreliable remote data. Only accurate within a percentage of norm.
---
Scenarios 3 and 4 would prove the most effective at dealing with bots, with the accurate data provided locally on transaction confirmation Think of the add to your basket to see discounted price offers on the internet as a real world example designed to prevent price scrapers functioning by competitors.
---
Could be interesting if accompanied with a "warning Data may not be accurate until order enquiry at station.
---
This would be pretty fatal to bots, and would make market flipping a manual task, so those engaged in bulk station trading and/or manipulation would find their workload increased massively, but the question framed in neutral terms, may yield the answer that it would be anti inflationary and provide greater stability for the wider player base. 
---
It might justify investigating as a concept.
---
that's not really relevant though, the universe in still only so old.
---
Eh, it's in dog years. So it's not as old as you think.
---
Releasing a mobile game in asia is good for business
---
Man I wish I'd had a chance to serve on a battleship. Iowa and New Jersey were mothballed towards the end of my time.
---
I cannot downvote this enough.
---
Red dwarfs can easily reach that age, but they'd need the universe to have existed that long first.
---
Perimeter is absolutely not a noob system.
---
Well I sure do, heck most of the time I leave the client open overnight, the ambient station sounds are amazing too.
---
Ohhh, I totally understood that as "life expectancy" for whatever reason (just woke up being the most likely) and now your comment just made me take a second look.
---
I stand corrected, it's impossible for anything to be that old (in this Universe at least, but let's not go there).
---
Naglnear, naglfar naglwherever you are this comment will haunt you
---
CCP blackout
---
And the 15 he spend for friend invite since that account you do it from needs to be omega.
---
It was frustration probably ;)
---
ccp make my gameplay great and others shit kthxbai
---
What about the logo?
---
You are right, I totally missundertood the info being given and edited my comment accordingly.
---
I also tryed to edit my previous answer to you but I deleted it... anyway, you are correct. 
---
And EVE's timeline is about 20k years from now btw.
---
Gallente btw
---
What about Blake Hock?
---
Will have a look, thanks!!!
---
How do we know it's our universe?
---
That's the way hilarious killmails are happening
---
Like seriously? I never was able to make friends with the alternatives, I'd love it to come back.
---
They will notice and you will be kicked
---
as always, templis is recruiting
---
Current scientific data is wrong, Eve is consistent.
---
Same with planetary orbits.

Do you call Atlanins your home too?
---
Only a bit, and yes, you can do it for 8 hours if you want to.

..and breathtaking.
---
&gt;But do we know what earth year EVE takes place in? If it takes place in another 30b years from now, then a star could potentially be that old.
---
We're in the year 23357 AD, the EVE gate opened 7987 AD so not even close. 
---
But we don't ***know*** how old the universe really is, we have a pretty good idea based on our current understanding of science but some fundamental new discoveries/theories could change that number drastically, so whatever. The Big Bang model is less than a century old, who knows what they'll believe/know 20 millenia down the line.
---
Thanks, what about a decent passive shield regen tank? Would a Tempest be able to accomplish that? I like getting close with ACs guns blazing sort of style.
---
I believe the lore is specifically that these humans came from Earth, so it canonically our same universe.
---
You sure you are not mistaking universe with galaxy? I mean there is a theory of multiple universes, but besides some weird numbers in-game I don't think it was ever hinted at that Eve is supposed to be another universe.

Another feature abandoned by CCP.
---
Unless I'm missing something, that site seems to have been left alone as well. Maybe the admin is taking a holiday, but it still doesn't have the latest ships/components iirc (i.e the Nergal/Ikitursa).
---
Sure, but I don't think it being 3x off would be too likely.
---
What would be more likely is learning what came before the big bang and lumping that into the age of the universe, but the potential age of a star would still be limited by the big bang.
---
Unless somehow there is existence beyond the big bang.
---
this is genius AF!
---
Why not? Its interesting seeing the conversations that go on there. Like the idiots that reveal the location they are mining in and half an hour later complain about being ganked for some strange totally unknown reason. Or those guys bragging about having a billion ISK of compressed ore in their cargohold while in a trig invasion system. As if that wasn't a dead givaway to how to find them.

I do. No matter how far away i go, it’s always home. I’m normally in alachene but Atlantans holds most only stuff

Everything in EVE is a mess.
---
Vas.... deferens lolol

---
Technically the lore doesn't really specify which *universe* the EVE Gate connected to, so it's possible that New Eden is in some other, much older, universe. 
---
It's also quite possible that current scientific knowledge is crap and the universe is a lot older :P

&gt;high sec alpha multi-box gankers.
---
You can't run an Alpha account concurrently with other accounts. If you suspect this is happening, please report these people to CCP.

CCP has done extensive analysis which shows that players who lose a ship to another player during their first 30 days are more likely to sub to the game.

Show me...

&gt;Currently high sec gankers exploit the alpha system by creating infinite amounts of catalysts ganking alts to multi-box
---
They don't and if they did it would be against the rules. They would get banned really quickly because people love to report gankers
---
&gt; Burn Jita still functions as normal
---
Burn Jita is probably the only time people actually use alphas to gank but again people aren't multiboxing alphas.

&gt; Sure, but I don't think it being 3x off would be too likely.
---
Why not, we're basically taking measurements from a few years and extrapolating them back 14 billion years. If all our theories are correct and everything happened consistently it might be correct, but there are a lot of things we can't currently explain (like why the expansion of the universe started accelerating at some point instead of slowing down) and dark energy/matter. For all we know the expansion paused for 30 billion years and started up again for reasons unknown to us.

doesn't mean that the eve gate was just a space to space connection, could well have been a dimensional gateway too, potentially ot a much older universe.
---
Thanks for explaining. One more question if you don't mind: How can I control another characters drones with my main if I multibox? The only option I have is to 'assist drones' to another member of fleet. If I do this, drones will just orbit my main character but I can't actually control them.

I'm not sure what bearing that has on the claim that "players who lose a ship to another player during their first 30 days are more likely to sub to the game".

Interesting.  I’ve been training another trader alt that I was planning to stick in Amarr.  Maybe I should just expand my Jita operation though.

1. No it is not proftiable. You would be better of flying two haulers and moving twice the stuff or split it to reduce the lost from a gank. If hauling in LS/NS/WH, a scout is best.
---
2. Yes many ways. Frig abyz are great

&gt; (like why the expansion of the universe started accelerating at some point instead of slowing down) and dark energy/matter

The dark energy/matter IS the reason the expansion is accelerating...

Asides from that. The client still needs the information and extracting market information from the client is fairly easy.

Someone who has been ganked has zero way of knowing if their attacker was Alpha or Omega unless the ganker had an Omega only mod on their ganking ship.

Factions don’t mean shit. You can fly whatever ship you want as long as you train the relevant skills.

If you assist your drones to your main, they will the attack whatever your main is currently attacking. You can't control them directly, but they will attack the ship that your main is attacking.

The 970 specifically has a hardware defect when you memory utilization goes above a certain threshold.  Eve on its own won't get close but are you running something else in the background maybe?

That fake reflection/glint on the logo is terrible

I believe you're referring to  HD 140283, it was originally stated that it was older than the universe. More recent calculations have brought it more in line with the age of the universe at 13.6 billion years give or take a few hundred million years. It's considered a second generation star, which is still pretty impressive given that our star (the sun) is so young in comparison. A few years ago original calculations put the star as older than the universe, which would have had giant implications on our current understanding of the universe, but it's since been given a more proper age.

That's like saying "I can (litterally) be anything I want and have 100% control, so I'm choosing to be part of a monarchy that celebrates taking and killing slaves and has only one authority: the emperor, which is a god (or claims to speak for the god)."
---
Don't you see a problem with this?
---
Well, I don't try to blame or shame any Amarr players, I can only speak for me...
---
I'd rather be a freedom fighter/tribalist, capitalist pig or corporate puppet (in that order) than a member of a slaver theocraty.

Is that supposed to imply that it's hard to get a spy alt into TEST? :D
---
As a newer player in a small gang corp in low sec non-fw space, I have learned a LOT and I'm about to hit 100 bil destroyed in around 40 days.
---
That being said, I'm having trouble because I feel like I'm always spinning waiting for someone else to log in and help me get some content going.
---
What are some things I can do to generate content or do solo that I can then maybe ping my fleet for? I have bene scanning down WH and such but we haven't gotten any content out of them. Last week someone else found a good bait WH and we baited out a Proteus, but I'm not too sure what I'm looking for to identify that. I've asked corpmates but their suggestion is to find another hobby until fleet OP times.
---
We have at most 6 dreads on at a time (typically 2-3), 2 logi, and 4-6 pilots, a few of which are pretty low SP.
---
I think he just wants to mine in complete safety.
---
&gt; I died in a WH because it seems it collapsed behind me 15mn after I entered and a manticore killed me, but it was fun and unlucky. 
---
Sounds like you had some fun, if you found this fun carry on doing it. Don't do the sites in a WH directly off high sec, go further down the chain as they are less likely to be camped. Use something like tripwire to map your wormhole chain as you go.
---
As others have said EvE is much more fun in a group. Maybe find a WH group who cater to newbies so they can teach you the ropes and maybe do a bit of PvP or PvE with them.
---
There are a lot of rich, stupid and ignorant people

That's a nifty idea.

Also possible that wormholes travel through time as well as space.

I mean, we accessed new Eden through a wormhole.

Could have been a wormhole into another universe altogether

they better release these arrays so we can have local back
---
I would like to point out that you can upgrade architecture of server-side code and still keep 32bit integer limits within that code. All 64 bit does is open up more modern hardware and allow use of more ram addresses.
---
For example: In C++ a int bit width is 16 bits, allowing the signed integer to max out at 2,147,483,647 which is the number you quoted, this is a very standard type for most programming usages, and is also very standard in most Databases for storage types.
---
The next highest type is a Long int which bit width is 32 bits wide, Knowing CCP and how they usually aren't great with programming, wouldn't often be used and legacy wise "Who would use these"
---
In a 32 bit compiler would produce +2,147,483,647 for it's signed maximum and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 on a 64 bit compile.
---
Now on to a Database, MySQL's current standard sets int to 2147483647 which lines up nicely with C++'s integer and has 2^63 -1 for BIG_INT.
---
TL;DR, CCP probably just sucks at programming and is stuck with legacy code as they attempt to dig themselves out of a Techdebt ditch and are floundering hard
---
What hoe
---
That was proven to be a miscalculation and misinterpretation 
---
https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/19446/how-can-hd-140283-be-older-than-the-universe
---
Yeah but the Amarr have such sweet looking ships! And shoot LASERS! And have tons of armor!
---
And the old moon mining system generated more content then anything currently in the game. Entire wars were generated by moon rebalances. And I don't care about 'free moon mining' I care about healthy conflict generation for the game. Right now there is no reason to invade someones space because every region is worth essentially the same.
---
Be whatever race you want. It makes absolutely zero difference to what ships you can fly, what skills you can learn or what kind of RP experience you want (if you're into that sort of thing).
---
Where are the supers jumping to cynos tho
---
And a lot of people are attached to their space pixels. I would prefer a healthier game over the hundreds of billions I've earned throughout the years.
---
Yeah the older era of EVE was definitely a huge time sink.. especially the old wars.

Screenscraping can be done 100% outside the eve client, so you don't get flagged because you're not manipulating the client or reading its memory.
---
Just to get you pointed in the right direction, if you hover your mouse over the icon of the eve client in the taskbar windows draws a little thumbnail which is actually fully downscaled video output. This is a feature of the DWM (Desktop Window Manager) from windows itself and you can actually API this and have windows send the information in a program of yours where you then can proceed and - well screenscrape whatever information you want. Better yet, you can even let it send you only a specific sub-area so you only need to process the area where the relevant widgets are and you don't need to scrape the entire full window, saving processing power (although modern pcs can handle that just fine too).

Once they train the skills need to fly a cata, they can just convert the account to a skill farm and get free omega every month.

EVE is programmed in Python and you get true multithreading there (for computationional things, not I/O) exactly when they manage to remove the GIL. Which some have been trying for over 10 years and it will never happen.
---
So when there is a full rewrite in another programming language that actually has normal fully funtional multi-threading or when Python finally gets rid of the GIL. Both of those are far closer to never so I wouldn't hold my breath for it.
---
&gt; Our favourite faction lorewise is amarr but both like though and tanky ships and we dont know which faction is the best for that.
---
Amarr is a good choice for that as well. They generally have the best armor tanks. Caldari has the best shield tanks. Minmatar has the fastest ships and Gallente has a thing for drone platforms.
---
You are not limited to your choice though. You can cross train into any ship. Alpha clone limitations may apply.
---
The only benefit is the look of your character. And I think maybe your initial standings if you do the early missions.
---
I always assumed wh space was a future version of new Eden
---
If you do anything in a dead end, and use the bottleneck system as a filter, or any systems leading to the bottle neck. Its the only time I condone not watching intel so you're actually notified.

---
That, wuild be chaos. XD
---
I downvote you without even reading
---
amarr used to be a bad pick for alpha characters due to amarr's T2 crystals being very powerful, but I don't know if that's still the case. Gallente was considered the best for alpha thanks to their powerful drones, but i dont know if that's still the case.
---
But in general, Gallente tend to combine very close range and powerful blasters with drones for even more damage. They can go full drones, or use rails too. Gal tend to armor tank, but sometimes shield tanks and sometimes even hull tank. They're not that fast generally but some of them can be quite swift.
---
amarr can be WAY more tanky, but when they do that they lose speed. Their ammo allows them to switch their effective range very quickly. They sometimes have drones, or missiles.
---
minmatar are super fast, and good for hit and run, they can do shield OR armor, depending on the ship. Their ACs want to fight in falloff, giving you more range than you think you have. it gives you the option to dive on someone and do full damage, or take advantage of your speed to kite the shit out of them. Most of their cruisers are just bad, but the thrasher is one of the best t1 dessies in the game, the slasher is just retarded as a light tackle (Heat your MWD and go like 6000 m/s as a total newbie and you'll hate slow shit forever), the typhoon has just absurd burst DPS and power projection with lots of tank AND speed. Minmatar also have artillary which is the highest alphaing weapon type. tornados can easily drop 10k+ damage bombs on people. (I love minmatar ships :3)
---
caldari are shield mostly, and also fairly nimble. their missile systems make them quite popular, particularly their rapid light platforms. They also like to use railguns. It also happens to be the faction I know the least about. all I can tell you for sure is that they're popular for sticking new players in for fleet fights. 
---
Hope that helps!

The chat's highlight words system always removes spaces. It can not be used with spaces. I tried. I can't make it ping "Vas Vadum", it removes the space. I can't make it ping " Vas ", it removes the spaces.
---
"Vas,Vadum, Vas, Vas ,Vas ,Vas Vadum" became "Vas,Vadum,Vas,Vas,Vas,VasVadum".
---
And who the fuck mentions people by full name every single time? Hell I was in TEST Public chat today and someone said "Hey Vas". Now if I disabled it from pinging me when people say my first name, how the fuck would I have been alerted to this?
---
I'm getting a little pissed off with the fact that everyone here has had asshole responses to a report that the chat mention system is slightly broken. I even mentioned a fix and people downvoted the fix. What the fuck is wrong with you people.
---
Initially players had to figure out that the numbers on a wormhole actually meant something and that there were constellations and capital escalations and mass limits and time limits and so on. There was almost no help from CCP when wormholes came out beyond that they exist and have temporary connections between them that you scan down.

Once again, it's a sandbox.  As you said repeatedly.  Just because you don't like or understand a playstyle doesn't make it bad or wrong.  I don't understand the fun in sitting on a rock mining for hours.  Just because you don't like something doesn't make it wrong.  You're thinking about this game all wrong and you want CCP to cater to your playstyle at the cost of someone else's.  That's selfish and contrary to the sandbox.  Maybe you don't understand what that word means?  Or maybe Eve just isn't for you. HTFU

/universe/structures/{structure_id}/ will get you basic information about the structure.
---
 /markets/structures/{structure_id}/ will let you pull orders from a structure.
---
to be honest there is very little mumbo jumbo once you know what your looking at. experienced wormholers can tell you the mass, rough time frame, and where it goes just by looking( and/or listening) at it.  
---
CCP does not have a great track record with tools, i think we are all better off letting 3rd party devs do this one.  
---
Local is bad, we do not want it. If you really need to do if there are people out there say marco in local, cloakies are required by texas law to reply polo.  
---
Depending on what you meant specifically this may be available already. There are way more people in k space.
---
I did say ‘as few as’ implying that it could take more... Obviously reading comprehension isn’t a strength of the bot aspirants.
---
When you grow up and have RL, work, wife, kids ... this is what decides when you can do something in EVE.      
---
Big groups allow you to jump into fleet more often during those 'free time' periods.
---
nono, im more aksing, than being sarcastic, as a code member your geneticly implanted to know how many catalysts it takes to take down and hull max tank in hisec
---
i was more hoping youd say rokh has x eHP and itll tank x amount of catalysts to kill in a 0.6 system
---
I think it's something you can work around.
---
Seeing as 2014 wasnt the end all be all of Dominion times you're incorrect:
---
http://www.verite.space/maps/influence/20121011.png
---
Theres not much to discuss when the point the other person is making is wrong.  There isnt anything to counter when its just plain wrong and im not going to engage it.  It's up to you to realize that (you wont like many others.)  
---
&gt; Something one person has 'seen' doesn't really reflect the actual state of the game.
---
Seeing as alot of people including you on this subreddit do exactly that, I would say that this is also incorrect.  Alot of folks here go off their experiences and I do the same.  I also tend to have a different mindset than almost everyone here.  I dont mind things like structure grind, and I like entosis.  I was with alot of people at the time of dominion hating the n+1 super structure uncontestable grinds.  With entosis littler guys can at least try and do end up getting some kills versus none.
---
What's their culture like? Still very Old Stain? I know a lot of the toxic assholes from back in the -A- / Stainwagon days joined Test.
---
Hey... I stumbled on this thread googling myself for the lols.
---
Tiller here, I'm actually back playing, but Tiller is permabanned so I re-rolled a month ago. With a few carefully applied skill injectors I'm already BBQing people :)
---
Look up Miss Missile in game... drop me a mail or sumthin
---
Either take a break from the game (a good thing if you are feeling a little burned out) or go try something new... either LS/NS/WH, or a new corp that likes doing what you do.
---
Got that covered. Small gang allows you to just jump into the game, see who's on, and go kill shit.
---
How's the content been in the pirating business? I mostly raid nullsec these days.
---
&gt;WH's feel like slow dancing with your sister.  
---
Nah, I don't get boners in wormholes.  
---
Also, I can take care of your assets while you're away :3
---
Yeah. If you don't want to play, don't. 
---
It's a game. It's supposed to be fun.
---
I had to rewind twice to make sure that was not a collapsed child that woman is sheltering. It's not, all good.
---
&gt; a report that the chat mention system is slightly broken
---
it's not broken. your input is broken, and you're claiming that the system pinging you when it detects a word you manually, explicitly chose to have it ping you for is the system being broken and "retarded"
---
if you don't like it, don't use it, like the other 99% of the playerbase
---
also have you ever heard that saying? if you meet one asshole, they were probably an asshole, but if you meet assholes all day, it's probably you who's the asshole
---
what they sell  on LP shop?
---
I don't feel we can blame them for running from a fleet 4 times their size. They came to shoot miners and a
---
AFK vexors after all.
---
As Goons will probably point out, the Mittani (in the Imperium section) wizard hat incident was 7 years ago and arguably, hasn't had such a public drunk mistake like the wizard hat incident since.  So probably not the best example.
---
The video overall I thought was done pretty well, and points out some interesting and unique things that no other MMO can claim.  It does get a little bit in the weeds, but yes this is the mature lady and gentleman's game.  I'm sure some wall street sharks who may also be space nerds would be salivating a la pavlov.  Eve is immersive, huge, all encompassing and habit forming.  Once you get it, you're hooked.   A good video for anyone on the fence thinking about getting involved who's already seen the big historical space battles.
---
There's a decent number of caps moving through to points East/South, and there are occasional DED runners coming in from escalations in Scalding Pass and elsewhere.  It's been a minute since I lived in the area, but there was a German corp that perma camped the HS entrance in the NE corner of the map you could occasionally gank/get a fight from.  And NSH lived in the NPC stations area and could be fun for a small cap fight now and again.  It's not an "active" area though, at least compared to others.
---
Old Man Star
---
They are where I get all my furry porn
---
Errr, get 8 Accounts, multibox, be happy
---
i'll do it for 9.99%!
---
Yeah take a break.  Its a game, come back when you want to play it for fun again.
---
It really doesn't though.
---
I'd suggest joining a new corp that does something that you've never done before. I used to be an indy guy but got burnt out over and over, I joined a LS PvP group and this has been my longest play through yet!
---
I was thinking to grind some standings with them. 57 well endowed agents, for distribution and security missions, in high and low.
---
Thanks for doing the great work you do!
---
I would but I really hate doing api checks and filling out applications. I'd rather uninstall then do an interview like it's a job.
---
Cock and balls spurting hot thick cum
---
Sounds like you're a ganker, therefore you deserve whatever annoyance chat gives you.
---
The implants are on back order. I’m waiting for it to arrive. Sorry to disappoint.
---
And there is always someone running the other way!
---
The astero is pretty popular. It’s pirate faction so can be flown by alpha (I’m pretty sure)
---
It has decent bonuses to relic and data analyzers.
---
And very importantly it can cloak. 
---
Making getting around in wormholes and null a little safer.
---
Unless you join a WH corp or a superduperserious nullsec corp, no one really cares that much other than some basic questiona
---
Been pretty fun lately in the Cal/Gal warzone, Amarr/Min seems a little more inactive atm... I think the blackout brought some more people to lowsec, but that's just my first impression. Of course the place is also palgued by risk averse mission runners in really hard to catch Jackdaws and Ventures d-plexing, but that's sadly usual at this point; and probably some botters also left NS for LS.
---
We are also enjoying some NS roams lately, with the blackout it has become far more enjoyable.
---
Closed beta sign ups began this week and will start on 26th of August. As for what the game involves, can't find much info. You also need a compatible phone; Note8, Note9, S8, S9, Huawei P30, or Google Pixel 2.
---
Until my neuts shut off their hardeners and weapons.
---
Some Amarr players RP as a freedom sub faction fighting the good fight from within the Theocracy.
---
I'm just barely getting back in after a break since last October. I went to Eve Vegas and then didn't log in until a month or so ago. Breaks are good. I was able to read different things going on and get excited again. It also helped me not feel so invested.
---
Cap booster fit Vag or Golem, mid grade crystal, bring a lot of cap boosters with you(use a bulkhead), don't get ganked
---
A Lawyer.
---
Found the roleplayer
---
I like the slot amounts on the imicus, it seems to be the most balanced for exploration. It's as ugly as they come tho.
---
Pandemic Horde does not do an API check or interview. You just apply to the corp and get accepted. If you like pew, there is plenty of it there.
---
I probably was not clear enough about the point I was trying to make there, it was to point out how political figures in eve are still raked over the coals for inappropriate behaviour in the same way a real life political figure would be.   
---
I am glad you enjoyed it :)
---
Cloaking is Omega only. Everything else about the Asteroid is still good.
---
we are burning bots, not witches.
---
get with the times
---
*5 hours later:* "Just *one* more jump. Must be some content around here somewhere!!!"
---
Yeah, those guys are mostly bots. That's the new normal, it's very safe to bot in lowsec. I wish it wasn't. Wish money was a lil better for real players. It would be nice if they buffed the riskier pve options in lowsec, like clone / mordu's hunting. That often gets you fights in my experience.
---
Astero is good, but from what I read, this ship without cloak is not much useful for alpha player. Or not?
---
You should buy a mining permit, otherwise that belts can be dangerous.
---
Escorting isnt profitable.
---
But what you guys could do, if you like pvp you could join FW in a seperate corp and have your friend haul in your ships in and your loot out. He could make some extra money by hauling in some market items in the closest hisec to the mainhubs and you'd have ships ready all the time.
---
How old is your kid?
---
Take my downvote
---
The slope starts between may and june so i doubt the blackout is the actual cause, it must have had an impact but i'm not sure it's that big. Skillfarms stopping due to low rentability maybe?
---
Tipical
---
This 5 step strategy, I may don't understand every step enough
---
Because you can't fit a full rack of tachyons on a baddon without going over power grid. All Vs, no other mods. 
---
Because alpha is often more important than raw DPS in fleet engagements, and beams have poor alpha. 
---
And finally, because you're not using Abaddons in your fleet because they have a damage bonus, you're using them because they have a resist bonus and a whole bunch of low slots.
---
And also we need the game to play itself, give food and beer IRL as well as a free titan kill each time you jump a wormhole.
---
One more thing, take my downvote and go back to wow scrub
---
Ayy, what about Star Citizen?
---
Right guys? Guys?
---
...
---
^(Hello?)
---
huh, i felt more like "oh hey i can have a extra PI planet and a few extra trade orders now..."
---
Yea im solo in a VNI on a gate for 45minutes. Im terrifying. Lol.
---
I feel personally attacked. I named mine “HAWdy Y’all”
---
Didn't you listed to CCP Hilmar's podcast? It's not supposed to be fun; it's supposed to cause premature, panic induced heart problems.
---
a/s/l?
---
For those too stupid to understand. I'm trying to lose the whole 'show info' and read some lame worded text when it would be just as easy to show the exact stats instead of looking at 3rd party sites. 
---
As for local I agree the blackout is great but even CCP said they may bring it back and use system arrays of some sort for local. 
---
And finally... where is the harm in knowing how many players are online in all of J-space? I'd just like to see the activity there compared to K-space. 
---
Damn this community is broken.
---
Yup, just like how OwO, ^.V.^ and others are faces
---
But the Gallente have no issues with human rights!
---
well I call mine Peter because it so sma... err I mean I call mine Arnold because it used to be... nevermind, sorry. I call it Hafþór.
---
Join us in lowsec for danks fleets and content! Pm me if your interested, im fcing fleets almost daily, come have some fun with us ! I can hands out ships if you need :) also welcome back !!! o7
---
Agreed!
---
To be fair some of those chinese Jackdaws are actual players and have shot back at me, which was a refreshing tbh. But yes, most of them are totally bots.
---
Ahahaaaa. Goon humor. A mix between not understanding what I'm talking about and a teenage girl.
---
I'm not. I just find that anyone who pushes their information to the public chat then complains about being ganked is funny. I've been a miner for a decade, and I know not to disclose information publicly at all about where I am, when I'm mining, how much I have on me or at all.
---
I've even helped people in the chat with their questions. I don't outwardly insult people either but, common sense says if you complain about being attacked after telling people you have a billion ISK in your hold..... Welp.
---
But I applaud your hate of gankers. I hate them too. However I also watch my chat and warp out when known gankers arrive if I need to. I'm well tanked as well and prepared. Survived Hulkageddon, 7 gank attempts. I love telling that story about how I survived with 2 hull points in my Hulk back then, and the two guys who tried were sitting there in their pods and I said "Hey. I think you missed a spot." and then when they warped out "Wait, come back, aren't you going to finish? Oh wait, you can't." My best story ever, I wish I could have recorded it back then. Would have made a great video.

WINMATAR!! In rust we trust

Looks like a fidget spinner

How is showing stats of a wormhole different than showing the words representative of the stats? This I'd like to know.
---
Flair checks out.
---
I stand corrected. o7
---
14/f/cali
---
Should you take a break? 
---
It comes down to if you are feeling burnout then take a break. Play a different game, focus on your job, workout, put more into a hobby then you normally do and if eve is your hobby then explore different ones. Because let’s face it we all get the eve itch to come back and shoot things either rats, rocks, or people. 
---
If the game is boring because your doing the same grind as before? Well that’s eve a grind fest that gets blown up quickly. That’s why people have skill injector farms from like 10-30 alts just grinding skills and never playing. Also PI alts same thing as well. Try something new. Do exploration, focus on faction warfare, do invasions, join bombers bar roams, become a market tycoon buying low selling high, become a Jita scammer. 
---
This is a sandbox game and it allows you to do almost anything you want. If your not really interacting with your Corp pack up or fire sale and find a new one. Hell even make your own build it up and either make an alliance or join one. 
---
Your only limited by yourself. Nothing in this world is free but you can definitely enjoy your time by expanding your horizon.
---
And yes we all know Fozzy SOV is aids.
---
I have a similar feeling. I love eve. I came back and soon after i didnt want to do anything because everything seemed booring an stupid. Today i decided that after 3 years in null i go back to highsec to try out the new stuff. I personly habe never done missions, market pvp or low sec pvp. And this new stuff excites me. Maybe try new stuff out. But if there is nothing left that gives you joy or makes you giggle then its best to take a break.
---
It is generally best to not admit mining in a public place like this. You seen how trollish everyone is. Most of them are likely PVPers or griefers looking for someone to harass.
---
I'm not the type to lie though, and I don't want people thinking I am a ganker.
---
So your friends quit and you want to revenge them by camping new players so that they too stop playing?
---
Do you want to kill Eve Online?
---
Well the idea would be that skill injectors wouldn't be a thing or rorquals or plenty of other things.
---
A 10 year old instrumentation contracting company :P
---
NOS Domis, but I was thinking more post nano-nerf pre fozzie sov.
---
I didn't need to read the content of your post, just the title. The answer is yes.
---
I've taken longer breaks than most people here have played. Yet here I am, 16 years later. I always come back. It certainly wouldn't be that way had I not went on and lived life outside of eve for extended periods of time.
---
"get with the times" - Titanium-Ti
---
You're about 6 weeks late mate.
---
Yeah so the "every 15min dadyyyyyy!" is ahead of you.      
---
Read this when your kid have more than 6 years and starts asking constantly questions ... trying to explain for the first 5 minutes what he exactly want to ask.
---
wat
---
No, you cannot camp newbie systems. 
---
If newbies are the only people you can kill, maybe WoW is the game for you.
---
Burn Jita did not kill it and I doubt the EULA was consulted on each shot. It will do just fine!
---
Next patch, "WE'VE UPDATED NPC CORP LOGOS! we've finally fixed EVE."
---
This reminded me how boring 1v1 buffer tanked combat is to watch. Orbit, activate modules and wait =\
---
That's not meant to be a reflection on you or your piloting, it's more the gameplay.
---
Done the "highly involved godfather" thing, my partners have done it a couple times. I think we'll do alright. Honestly if my kids are anything like I was the 4+ years are the ones I'm looking forward to the most. I still remember doing that to my dad, and getting involved in his hobbies of adventure gaming and model building when I was 4-5. Still doin it today. :)
---
New players are the lifeblood of any game. If you camp them to the point where they will quit the game you are efectivly killing the game.
---
And I if you want to protest against the blackout do something smart without ruining the fun for others.
---
it will still help you. It's better then a probe/heron. And tbh, for an alpha there isn't actually anything else that you can fly which is really better
---
There is only the door. GTFO.
---
One of many ships that makes no physical sense. In the real world it would just spin in circles unless it was perfectly balanced.
---
Well, the internet was made for porn.

Whee! Old references!

This. You should join your friends and unsubscribe.
---
Honestly this is one of my lost enjoyed memes.
---
For me it was... Oh 1/3rd of the way to battleship 5 :(
---
You don’t say , your preaching to the choir here. the afk pvp killers love easy pvp just as much as the easy pve players love peaceful pve.
---
They act like there superior but they ultimately want the same thing
---
 An easy game on there terms.
---
CCP runs a business there concern is profits.
---
Unfortunately there only one way to vote and that’s with your wallets.
---
So yes the game has turn in to kinda a civil war between pve players and pvp players.
---
Way to Alienate people CCP !
---
Just have to wait for the money to talk.
---
And if it shows pvp heavy makes CCP more money then I guess your friends are quitting.
---
But if not then I can’t imagine CCP not reverting back to a more pve friendly environment.
---
Just have to vote with your wallet and see.
---
Hey I played with the character Amanda shadow sword. I was with you when we got ginger magicians cap ship banned. I’ll message you tonight when I get home from work
---
I roll with a new character call Xeno Templar
---
Probably. Not like I know.
---
Thick armor and lasers. 
---
Lasers are the primary weapon type for amarr with instant reloads and the t1 ammor never has to be replaced.
---
Some amarr ships also have drone bonuses and usually they end up with some missiles on the fit.
---
Slower then usual but thicker armour.
---
Your decision has no impact on your ability to play.  Thought people tend to argue that amarr ships are inferior until you have all the support skills such as capacitor skills and skills to reduce capacitor.
---
Ultimately just pick what you like the look off. You can easy go meet up with your friend and do missions or what ever with them.
---
Imagine being this fragile.
---
So far from what I have seen go cheap and expect to loose them hand over fist. Exploration is a safe(ish) new player activity only if you are Omega. Not enough scan resolution unless you overspend for an alpha in even .6 systems.
---
You actually don't need to call it anymore because those Widows are dead already, so w/e.
---
I wish they’d bring back the old billboard messages and all. Was better than getting told to buy glasses every jump
---
Jita isn't a starters system, so the EULA has nothing to do with it.
---
Today I learned I've been slow dancing with my sister my entire eve career.....and I've liked it.
---
I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or not, but such is the internet.
---
Thanks! I'm halfway down the rabbit hole and the light's fading fast!
---
If you are planning on killing other explorers, it will be useful to you.
---
If you're planning on fleeing at the first sign of danger, it will be slightly less useful.
---
It can align sub 2s if fit correctly, but your money would be better spent on a T1 exploration ship at that point, since you could lose them tenfold and still come out better financially.
---
The Astero really outshines the others with Omega status and a cloak.
---
&gt; I find this action OOG and deliberate.
---
I find this post OOF and degenerate.
---
No. The people who are refusing to play because of the blackout are the type of players who should either move to low/high sec or GTFO. Either way they clearly don't belong in null.
---
Yeah, after that last paragraph she should be feeling more than a little moros.
---
I dont think an ingame system would be better at all. It takes up a ton of window space. I also dont think that CCP could ever make everyone happy, so we are better off being able to make our own mapping tools than have to use the one ccp gives us. See tripwire VS vippy VS siggy VS pathfinder. All are fine tools, and plenty of wormholers will argue strongly about which one is the best. People look for different things, and can take the same piece of software and thing it is both amazing, and trash at the same time. I would much rather have CCP focus on developing things only they can do, and let us build the tools we want.  
---
We USED to have the mappers in game, it was awful.
---
If isk is not an issue for you, I suggest starting to spend it. You don't want to quit the game with a full wallet. I've been playing for 15 years and when I get bored, I started spending my isk on structures and crazy ships to go die in.
---
Some of us think that's fun.
---
Did the manticore that got u in wormholes SRP ur imicus? Killmail?
---
Does anyone have a full list of those, BTW?
---
I thought the site may have just tied in to marketeer somehow. That's why I asked.
---
Yeah, trolls are one of the worst parts of the game.
---
&gt; a teenage girl
---
glad you are finally ready to say these words aloud
---
Prove me wrong: 
---
The Minmatar are criminal scumbags ["A fair number make their living on the darker side of the law, acting as pirates, smugglers and peddlers in all kinds of illegal goods, and many of the larger criminal groups in the world of EVE are run by Minmatar."](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/minmatar/)
---
We, the righteous Amarrians, kept them in line.
---
What ?
---
Maybe you should listen to the interview again because you clearly missed what was actually said.
---
On a side note, if an effect of the blackout is players like this quit then I'm glad.
---
So . . . If you think this will hurt bots you're literally retarded. Legitimate players use the API to give a real UI (or discord alerts) to monitor their orders, botters just read straight from the client itself. This would be a buff to bots.
---
Sure these tools aren't exactly publicly available and perhaps a bit unfair, but botters have no need for the API. If it actually upsets you then you're welcome to set up your own ESI alerts.
---
I mean....
---
Every time I see this clip, I think to myself how it does *so much better* at portraying superhuman badasses than many Hollywood films. The fights that come anywhere close to this one in feats and intensity are surprisingly rare, as far as I can remember.
---
YOU YOU CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE WANT THESE GLASSES. 
---
W E L L H E C A N
---
Dunno, for 1 exploration run on probe yesterday I get 70 mils in wormhole, and I ran away from the battleship with scout drones.  
---
For me exploration is kinda fun and challenging as for a new player
---
What is going on with Rattlesnake prices? Is it because of VNI nerfs?
---
Huh, so that’s why I’m always randomly selected at airports!
---
So your friends used local to be 100% safe and not interact with other players? No real loss lmao
---
No, move along.
---
Kinda wish it was like that bc if the lulz alone.
---
the epic arc is about some 14-ish year old boy that is an up-and-coming star/hearthrob.  But some crooked people at Impetus arrange for him to be sold to the Syndicate for forced prostitution.  Dark.
---
Is stepping up from an astero to a stratios to do combat exploration a good jump in income? Is there any C1-3 combat sites it can’t run and are they good isk?
---
ITT complete moron doesnt realize it isnt CCP's fault, but his own.
---
Exactly that... and I'm not sure it reached a third, but didn't really look how much SP it requires tbh.
---
Please no, there are major pitfalls to extending a complex pc game to the basic functionality of a phone. I saw games like hearthstone slowly go from an intricate complex game to shit because the mechanics were too complicated for a mobile.
---
The extra mid slot on the Heron pushes it to the top of the list. As a newer player, that is an extra array to assist in scanning skills.
---
There's plenty of ISK to be made in lowsec, bot.
---
The whole idea is to simplify and streamline. I don't know anyone who enjoys entering information into the wormhole mappers. It would be great to implement in-game. You probe something down, you right click, send info to corp or alliance. Done. Maybe that info can be sent to 3rd party sites. There's obvious ways to improve the process.
---
That's the point. Neo is loaded with only one skill for starters. In the next scene dozens of martial arts are uploaded into his brain.
---
and my baguette !
---
Can't take the burn? Salty much?
---
Gallente. Damned degenerates
---
so glad I rescued your dread pilot from you
---
So you are salty that the risk averse fucks you play with are ragequiting like noobs and want to take it on new players in starting systems?
---
To begin with, no you can't do that.
---
To end it (because you barely deserve any attention at all): LOL GET FUCKED!
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
I'll take an easy afk kill, sure, but I prefer the fight I get from a response fleet.  The myth of the risk averse small gang player is just that, a myth.
---
It’s technically possible, but you would have to commit all your lows and mids to the tank. My mock-up fit only produces about 700 ehp/s regen. You’d be much better off fitting normally for combat and bringing a friend/alt in a logistics ship.
---
Well we knew the security team isnt really focused on combating botting/RMT, so this makes sense.
---
Amarr master race, scorch ammo is the best in the game. Hands down.
---
I can relate to this! I quit my Corp for a few months and joined another group. It made the game fresh and new simply because I was interacting with different people, making new friendships.
---
For me what makes this game fun is the people who I interact with!
---
Uhm don’t get it I speak the truth !
---
unless you like to loose pvp matches ? 
---
Nah I suggest all you fucks stop being hypocrites and admit you love a easy pvp target.
---
You ain’t no different then the pve afk bot that loves easy pve.
---
You want an easy game just like everyone else! 
---
Fucking hypocrisy of these fuck head so called pvp players.
---
Most ships were already dong-based, they are just streamlining the design.
---
You still getting fun frig fights? I find balance has really skewed getting good fights these days, I haven't missed fw that much.
---
Impetus has the largest archive of yiff in New Eden!
---
Until you go isk negative
---
Upgrade to Impetus Premium
---
This is HORRIBLE! And I’m in fucking CODE. Get your head out of your ass! You’re going to start a war against new players, because they ruined local for you. You’d ruin the whole game because you can’t adapt to a changing meta. WOW!
---
I used to be active bombing shit with Dingo and annoying the hell out of Boat and Sort with Wrik's Cloaksquad, but burned out some time after the Fountain War, mostly because most of the people I played with eventually o7'd out. In retrospect I should probably have taken up FC'ing myself and try to get good at doing it my way, and people would possibly x up for that, but I didn't. I stayed subbed for a while to keep connected to the sperglords in TEST, but didn't log on to the game any more. Eventually, I just unsubbed and stayed so until I got purged.

My point is mainly that if EVE doesn't excite you anymore, you can either enact some change to make it better for you (learn to FC, join a corp with cool people doing what you like (Dreddit is recruiting, I guess)) or you can just unsub and do something else in life for a while. You can always come back. I believe I will, with all the exciting changes that's been happening in null.
---
The life blood of the game are fc's, market players, haulers, solo pilots, gankers, roleplayers, hunters and so on. Not newbies, but the ones who emerged from an useless noob to someone putting his assets in space or facilitating others who do.

Go get blown up a few times, get the old adrenaline pumping :)

are crybabies _STILL_ whining about this? lmao

Start flipping minerals and T1, to build cash. Then experiment with meta modules to get bigger wallet, and eventually move into proper speculative long and short investments, especially in RAW and Hulls, pay attention to patch changes and wars, and build actual portfolios composed with strategic thoughts. How much , why, and why in that composition. Also get involved with other traders and share tips and do mutually beneficial deals.

Last I heard they'd raised the money to repair the immediate hurricane damage, but the hull was still in degrading/leaking like it has been for a while.  There was supposed to be a plan to dry-berth it to solve that, but it's been mired in government incompetence for 10 years.  Ask r/worldofwarships if you want more detail, it's a bit of a passion project for that community and Wargaming has pitched in to help run a few fundraisers for her.
---
Wait. Did they miss the whole group of ships entirely then get wiped?
---
I've been using Magnates and I've only been able to do max 84% on data/relic sites. I'm glad you were able to find a way to 100% them.

For me it was oh another million SP I may use one day. 223m SP already in my head. 3.35m stored for future skill uses.

Not quite sure what you mean?  Losing ships is part of being a small gang or solo PvPer.  I have a pretty solid income stream from other in-game activities, and I've been known to buy plex now and again if I really need some isk fast.  I don't really worry about my KB or isk loss. 
---
If you're talking about not taking certain fights, sure I will fuck off once the Fax lands on grid, but that's because there's no hope of killing anything at that point.  But if there's a non-fax supported response fleet, I'll stay on grid and hope I can pick off a kill or two.

Nice

PvP in certain areas has truly become Black Desert Online. No pvp to be had in the blackout of the local desert in space. I figure introducing new players with a proper introduction will save them the trouble to see if they like the game or not. Happens all the time in other areas of high sec. Why do nobs need their own systems. No section of space should be safe.

Meh i think best is to let him on his own and only act as a mentor when he needs advice about a skillplan or a goal. Once he shaped up you can take him with you for roams or fleets.

I've quit twice, biomassed once (and CCP un-biomassed me).  Each time I came back, I tried something completely different and found enjoyment again.  First time, I quit because I was playing solo in highsec, mostly running missions and hauling for PushX, then solo in wormholes.  Burned out, quit, and came back and went out to a small null group.  Participated in WWB as part of the Drone Walkers, got evicted, moved to Tenal.  Burned out and went into a carebear wormhole group.  Got tired of them, so I joined a real-deal small gang wormhole group.  Loved it, but we all burned out.  Biomassed after doing some highsec PvP.  Biomassed.  Now I'm back and running a manufacturing set up in highsec while my main solo PvPs.  I'm going to start doing solo BLOPs as well now that the Blackout made that viable again. 
---
Bottom line, just try something completely new.  If it's still not fun, then take a break.  Keep your skills training though - biggest mistake I ever made.

Trial and error. I doubt any trader will give u info.

Congratulations, you have reached the state of a bittervet. Do yourself a favor and unsub because in one or two years you'll ask yourself why you wasted so much time doing absolutely nothing ingame. If you ever feel the urge again, you can always resub.
---
I was in exactly the same position more than a year ago. Nothing to do that I really wanted to do, rich as fuck, ISK was meaningless. I liquidated everything (including skills), gave it all away and quit for good. Best EVE related decision I've ever made.
---
For laughs I check the subreddit from time to time to see how CCP fucked up the game even more. So far I haven't been disappointed :)
---
What fit is that? Care to share?
---
I like the Imicus because i like gallente ships. It's also a bit faster with the ability to fit 3 nanos. The heron isn't a bad choice because the extra mid lets you fit a scan upgrade which can help you scan sigs faster as well.
---
The probe is gonna be about the same as the imicus. The only bad one is the Magnate because it doesn't have enough mid slots for prop, data/relic analysers and a cargo scanner.

Have a look at squishy's kill above, click on squishy to go to his page, then show only losses then find the last Hecate he lost, that's likely the same fit.
---
Sunesis. U get the probe strength bonus as a lvl5 explo frig, but u wont have the hacking bonus. Cheap and u can make it warp under 2s. Has some tank so u may live a smartbomb camp.

To be fair, trading is something you have to learn for yourself, there is no hand holding tutorial because traders don't want competition and all advice you get is going to be bad or horribly vague, like above.

New player perspective:
---
Kill them all.
---
C3 combat sites can be very good ISK, however starting from C2 you'd need a specialized ship to actually run them, I doubt a Stratios would be any good there.
---
Sincerely, if you're focusing on the data or relic sites, stay with the Astero. You'll be way faster, which help you avoid gate or wormhole camps, and you'll maneuver around the sites way easier. And IIRC, Stratios can only run the lower end sites, where the good ISK is in higher DED sites in null, or combat anomalies in wormhole.
---
Special mentions to the sleeper relic and data sites. They are consider one level higher than the wormhole where they are (C3 data site = C4 combat site), and net a bit more ISK.

Jesus. I don't know what the original clip is from, but I'm sure it's something terrible. Never change r/eve
---
Personal example : a few years ago we had a an event where we could farm one very good item (c3-x Ballistic control) I farmed some of them and also bought them for around 100m isk each, thinking that with time they will get more expensive because of rarity. I was right. I Sold them a few days ago (they are 300m worth each now)
---
Yeah, but if an app like that only helps you get/keep players about as good as some advertising, then you can imagine why apps like that get poor support. If the app has its own net income, then it becomes better than just advertising, cause it's paying for its self. If the app make CCP money in a way eve can't, it becomes drastically more realistic.
---
There was not much of a fight to be had, too much biggus dickus on grid but was a good laugh.  Thank you Test
---
Why are you currently situated and what kind of gameplay are you involved in right now? Null sec? Wormholes? Faction Warfare? High-security 'maybe tomorrow I'll find the content' purgatory?
---
I'm in null sec and content ships itself to my doorstep everyday and I'm having a blast.
---
International check-in at SFO during an earthquake.
---
Good. This event has been aimed at players like you, not salty veterans who have 350m sp, have been playing for a decade and are bored of the game.
---
Keep enjoying it and don't worry about the opinions of this sub, they're usually wrong.
---
Snuff would never risk losing supers. It would have to be a force of overwhelming majority for them to commit or a surprise attack. 
---
See Camal fight for reference. Init and Snuff moved titans for the fight one jump away. Did not commit because they were afraid of what Test might do 3 mids from home.
---
Also added commentary
---
Once I finally started leaving high sec the ISK really does become better in low sec even if a bit riskier.  Still not feeling brave enough for Null Sec but really am enjoying the greater flow of cash that exploration can Net you that makes gate camping not an issue as you are making way more than it costs to replace a ship anyways.
---
I actually wasn't aware of that at the time of posting my comment.
---
 
---
Though after looking into it, it really does explain why so many YouTube app ads are cookie-cutter Asian-art-style asset-flips.
---
Its awesome that you are finding enjoyment.  I have a feeling that is the real reason for the event is to try to increase new player retention.
---
Even as a bitter vet, I am not bitter about this event at all. If this event puts more targets in space for me to hit, I am all for it.
---
it's a t2bc and it's probably either the fastest or second fastest in its class
---
*drifts away in 500mn sleipnir to the tune of deja vu*
---
i am new and i agree with this
---
Daylies are kindof against the spirit of eve, that’s why people don’t like them. The advertising that CCP used to put out was always made the fact that you don’t need to login and grind like WoW, a feature, and this kindof flies in the face of that.
---
Not a big deal but with CCP and especially Pearl Abyss... lets just hope it’s not a slippery slope.
---
i think its been stated that new eden is within milky way
---
can you share?
---
It wasn't overall balance that was an issue when I was last in fw (I'm not exactly a pro though) so much as the fact that t1 vs faction vs pirate frigs are such enormous differences that it really limits your GFs to the people you find in the same ship class as you.
---
Beating someone 1v1 in a ship just +1 step above you relies on you being perfect and them really fucking up.
---
Astero
---
You know an app is good when its ads look like a AliExpress/DHGate listing.
---
Wait... Have anyone complaint about free skill points?
---
Definitely try wh life.
---
You are right, using the astero without covert ops cloak is definately not advisable, its too expensive and you will definately loose it. Use a heron, imicus or probe (heron probable best with 5 midslots)
---
Look man, they cant just give you what you want.
---
Next thing you know, other people will be expecting to receive the things that *they* want too. Be reasonable.

Can you do lvl 2 missions in a tengu?

I agree, we have that zone, it is called hi-sec. But the degree of safety needs to communicated. Knowing about it's limitations will certainly help alleviate the sting. And if you die, you should get an AAR. What happened? How? Why?

What about this set of 3 bling domis?

If quantum mechanics is correct, our universe could have popped into existence inside another one.  That would really impact what we think of the age of universe.  Hell, it would impact what we think of our universe in general.

I guess they said ships instead of characters because otherwise people would start crying for wanking in stations again
---
I post an Alpha log now and then here,  When I mentioned the free skill points in one post it was filled with negative comments about it 🤷
---
Do you honestly believe NetEase is going to take the burden of funding this new game? I dont.
---
wrong.
---
Dark matter and dark energy are two different things. Dark matter is hypothesised to exist because the gravitational attraction of galaxy clusters is higher than the mass that exists within them, and thus there must be more matter there that we simply can't detect. 
---
Dark energy is the theoretical force that is driving the acceleration in expansion of the universe, but again rather than being something specific, it's posited to exist because there presumably needs to be some energy source that is powering this expansion.
---
I'm not an expert on this by any means and perhaps I'm misinformed but this is what I understand to be the ideas underlying these two concepts. You might thus be correct in saying that dark matter is linked to this expansion, but In my understanding DM isn't.
---
You might get booted for such actions. Alliances / coalitions want their market seeded and don't want to have persons a personal profit on actions which harms the market availability overall.
---
This. Learning to cope with getting blapped early on is probably better for player development than (me) venture mining in hisec for a few weeks before burning out.

Oh wait. I did forget to mention the endless never ending grind of Incursions in high sec. Two flavors as well. Triglavian incursions are a loot pinata with no loot while the Sansha Incrusions can make you like 100m ISK an hour for almost relative safety yet people complain about nullsec. While you can make ISK your eyes will want to bleed and you will want to quit the game while doing this type of gameplay. 
---
You all shame everyone running missions, mining. Or doing any live related activity as bots or care bears. So you can come own off your high and mighty horse, but dont stand on the soap box either, as you might slip right off.

(or is that too soon?)
---
Heron is decent but has horrible align time and can't fit stabs if you want to fix that. High(est?) likelyhood of getting ganked, be it wormholes or a null bubble.
---
Magnate loses data analyzer if you want to fit cargo scanner but makes up for it with fast align time and ability to fit 2 stabs.
---
Don't know about the other two.
---
As someone coming from BDO, thay slippery slope is really something to be wary of.

Couldn't agree more I'd be gone if I had to endure some of the 5+ day queues. Being able to jump a few has gotten me a lot closer to where I want to be, and i can stomach the longer ones now.

Looks like only certain European countries can even participate in closed alpha. Watch this flop like every other venture CCP has undergone in last 10 years.
---
100% agree. Its important for survival of the game. So what a salty vet stops logging in his 15 alts. Especially if new player gets hooked makes another 15 alts lol.
---
Got rid of my main years ago, I have another character but it only has 700k sp. Is there any benefit to starting a new account or character?
---
Or maybe the reason was with test being on the defender side while imperium was attacking. And while they are "not" blue they wouldn't fight each other?
---
You and your friends are worthless krabs please uninstall
---
lmao
---
NSC is good dudes.
---
Others have given you plenty of good advice already. I just want to add one thing that new players tend not to realize: The space that is most convenient to get to is the space that is most likely to be camped by hostile pirates. You went to lowsec and immediately got killed? I bet you went to the lowsec closest to your starting system, or the lowsec closest to a trade hub. Try going to one off the beaten path. You still might get killed, but it's much less likely to happen. Gate camps in null are actually pretty rare, but they're pretty common at the convenient gates between highsec and nullsec. Use a wormhole to get from high to deep in null, and you can often wander around for quite a while without being jumped.
---
Eve University's Low, Null and Wormhole campuses used to be very active, Low in particular used to do a really good job of helping people into pvp with regular fleets in most TZs, impromptu small gang roams whenever anyone got bored and help and encouragement for people to try solo pvp as well.  I hope that's not changed?
---
You must be a linemember. Goons/TAPI had a no shoot agreement at the time turning that keepstar into a diplomatic clusterfuck.    
---
But hey, whatever supports your narrative. :thumbsup::skin-tone-1:
---
Heron for the extra mid slot and fitted with 2xIntertial Stabs or a Magnate with 4xWarp Core Stabs in the lows. Either of these will offer better results in getting away safely. You'll still die early on due to learning mechanics like dscan but you'll get there

Sure. You can also do level 2 missions in an Algos, I believe.
---
Dual rep Domi. Bling it a bit, use a cap booster, and you should be fine soloing.
---
Say it aint soo! This site is excellent, are there any alternatives?
---
I would recommend offshoring to offset at least 1 side of the broker fees.
---
Your isk level that you start with determines what you trade, but my general thing is never be worried about getting out of a market you dont like, just cut your losses and move on, and also do test orders to see how quickly things move.
---
Agreed. In an age of Eve where people have already been creating day old Rorqual pilots or whatever they wish, skillpoint events shouldn't even be a blip on the radar for seasoned players. I think it's a great way to get new players into a ship that they feel makes a difference in whatever they chose to do.
---
\*yawn\* post
---
Rattlesnakes are Gurista ships. Think about where Gurista missions are given, who's living there, and what might have happened recently.
---
I don't actually know this for certain, but I bet the war in the north disrupted mission running significantly and cut the supply. At the same time, demand went up due to the VNI nerfs. As a result: high prices.
---
It can be fun to roleplay as something you are not. You could argue that playing a "good guy" is just sort of lazy. Especially when the reality of EVEs backstory is that everything is just shades of grey. 
---
In the end though just play whatever provides an interesting enough background for you to enjoy.
---
I was running in a Golem, cruise fit.  You need web, TP, and missile guidance mods, and Precision ammo, faction might work.  It will have to be bling fit as well for tank.  It's slow going.  If you get a random spawn ontop of the minor just get out, you really can't handle the DPS of more than two Leshaks unless you have high-grade implants.
---
*citation needed*
---
Honestly, aside from the issue of bubbles, nullsec is probably safer. Fuck all people out there outside the big blocks. You just have to get familiar with the pipe systems that are regularly camped by people like me.
---
Jokes on you, bot. I would rather lose and learn from it than win and gain nothing. Admit it, bot, you got too used to perfect intel. Now you're taking it out on everyone else. Well, I'll have you know, bot, that I couldn't care less about perfect Intel on either side. Want to know why?
---
It's because I don't log in, bot. I don't. Log. In.
---
Yee, and I say this with Extreme prejudice, Haw.
---
&gt;that is extremely aggressive in the pay2win department for all their games.

Man I wish there was a part of the world that loves this kind of development. Would be even better if this game was aimed at that market.

oh wait

That's not a blingy Domi, that's a middle class Domi.

No, I’m just saying that the beta just opened, I’ve known about it for a long time

LSC died for a while. Current campus manager revived it and moved it to Eugales (technically most LSC people operate out the High-Sec pocket next to Eugales since that's where the market Fortizar is, but that's the official location) with a dedicated, close-knit, and active community which is out solo or small-gang roaming daily with at least one or two fleets per week. He did something similar last year when he was assistant manager of WHC. You will never hear anyone from the Uni say anything but the highest praises of Urban Oxide. Unfortunately, he just announced his resignation from the campus manager position yesterday because he's dealing with real-life stuff (family member's medical issues), so I don't know how long it's going to last.

Market pvp is undercutting other sell orders / higher bids on buy orders. Not lowering available items on your alliance / coalition market.
---
I would be very careful at assuming that. I roam long distances to find people to shoot at and know others do too.
---
The vacuum of space doesn't matter. If the net force doesn't go through the centre of mass then it will rotate.
---
Having some experience in Trigvasions and Marauder's I can tell you the danger is roaming fleets. You can figure out what you need to deal with the base spawn but if you get jumped and cannot de siege in time you could lose it. A couple Marauders at once though can sit at optimal to each other which works nice. Or like a Marauder and a Vindi to blap frigs.

I got the grantable role of X and I grant you the role of X and you are now X. However, you can't grant other people X, because you don't have the grantable role.
---
Nah not hull tanked. None of his recent losses were hull tanked at all. Dual web, max dps fits. Hull tank would mess with the DPS. Also no repper either. So even if 90 DPS was applying that's a pretty impressive kill. Was a shit fit Loki though so it would have melted quickly.
---
Ive been playing for 12 years without a break except for the lack of internet while moving a few years ago. I cant really relate to people who cant find anything fun to do.

One thing I might suggest is try something you do NOT think is fun. Ive seen people get into a rut because all they ever do is chase after things they think are interesting and get bored when those things run out.

That's what they do.

Knowledge about the so called mumbo jumbo is what makes a dedicated player better than a lazy bad player like you.
---
Take a break. Either from the game, or from the playstyle you are currently doing. I had this a while ago, when I burned out from FCing. Went to do some wormholing which was fun, then I left EvE entirely.
---
Good thing about EvE is the variety of gameplay styles. Have a look around and find one that works for you.
---
One thing you can do is check out dotlan (just Google 'dotlan evemaps') to get more info about the systems you're in/going to.  Besides just traffic stats, it shows a 2D layout of the map.  Important thing here is that geography matters.  A hub system that's connected to 3-4 others is probably going to be busier than a dead end pocket, but that dead end pocket might be the home system of a group if it's advantageous.
---
Try putting up a sell order for 1 round of ammo or something else real cheap. Broker's fee will be 100 isk.

Right back at you lol. **closed alpha** will start on the 26th (in almost 3 weeks). No beta, much less one that just opened.
---
I guess I can, I was just looking at the rigs and 2-3m rigs in a 250k ship didn't seem realistic at my income level. I am up to 10m. So that's good.

I have a good amount of isk from the past, like 10b. I do not want to invest anything, I wanted to start with about 500m. What items do you recommend with this amount of money?
---
Hes an alpha. Scorch doesnt exist for him
---
Clearly the appropriate response to a 3 man assault frigate gang is to dock up everything in the region for 45 minutes until you can form 30 cerbs then subsequently dock back up because the gang got bored and left.
---
thought it was about the 3 holes tbh.
---
But I get 1,000 of dongs from pounding my “v” key
---
Come hang out and talk with some fellow spaceship nerds!
---
It's worth it, once you start hitting the good sites you'll be making enough that the rig cost don't even matter.
---
Wait till you start flying around in asteros with sisters scanners and T2 relic hackers.
---
Astero without a cloak is really not worth it and it's a shiny killmail waiting to happen. It *is* still better than a T1 exploration frigate, but not enough to be worth the 50m cost.
---
Unless you combat fit it I suppose. But that's a pretty big risk with alpha skills.
---
Astero's main value is that it can fly covops cloak before you skill into covops frigates.
---
only thing that comes to mind, is Out Of Game, but that doesn't make sense.
---
Then again, OP's whole post doesn't make much sense.
---
Maybe you need glasses, I don't think that's the line 😂
---
It just feels very mobile game-y. Like how they make the early levels super quick to traverse then when you hit a wall you want to feel that rush again and so you spend money to progress. Thing games where you have to wait for stuff to upgrade (clash of clans, etc.)
---
I feel like having to wait early on taught me a great deal of patience with eve. It's what allows me to sit in someone's system for hours on end just for the chance to drop on a carrier or dedicate over a year of training just to fly one ship.
---
Having to wait a few days to fly a ship early on feels excruciating, but it teaches you to be patient, which I feel is so fucking valuable in eve.
---
Factions are meaningless and you can train all ships theres no faction restrictions or training penalties.
---
Yes
---
the issue with your hypothesis is that matter is not moving through space at an accelerating rate, but space itself is expanding and thus the relative positions of matter changes, without the matter itself moving if that makes sense ;P
---
I hope it's a big floppy one like the one at the end of Idiocracy.
---
Yup. Welcome to spodbrain retard country
---
WTF is this shit
---
Hacking with 4 stabs fucking sucks though.
---
Says the guys that do nothing but camp SV5 and annoy me because I have to take the long way to provi to get actual fights.
---
It'll happen sooner than you think takes no time to train t2 small
---
Jesus. Fucking CODE. calling this guy out.
---
Heron is great, all those mid slots give you the space for prop mod, cargo scanner, both analysers and a scan array.
---
But that Loki is AB fit. Even with it  webbed up Xtra squishy would have needed his prop on to stay in range. 
---
I’m not sure what exactly the Loki did to lose, but whatever it was it had to have been something really stupid
---
Yeah I can imagine you'd be mad about the patch if you lost your shirt on plex
---
I ended up with 18 duplicates of every item, so.....
---
Yeah.
---
Implants. To enhance your attributes.
---
More like economic warfare
---
6PM: Man, felt like shit all day, I will go to bed early today.  
---
3AM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHLdYVELWrQ
---
Well I mean ..the game has been out forever and not like WOW where you do something to earn that time.
---
It is 5 days and that is that. You say it feels very mobile game like
---
If you have 5.0 standings in Gallente and haven’t had a chance to try it yet, and high recommend running the Gallente Epic Arc. Lots of cool stuff about the Gallente and the Impetus corporation, including a lot of porn studios
---
Well, yeah. It’s radical and highly unpopular, horrible, gruesome, etc. But technically, it can be done. 
---
It’s not less of a moral downplay as any High Sec Wardec engulfing easy targets. The difference is motive.
---
And proves the point that anyone could tap the “Chaos” smokewagon but not with a real and exposed reason similar to CCP’s arguments because yeah, your inner Amidala might hemorage. It’s funny tho, how fast the conclusions crapscade. 
---
Don’t point at me! I’m just showing that there are other ways to percolate Chaos to level the battleground, or attempt to with high risk of fail. Doable, legit and well within a concept not new to EVE.
---
I'm saying the availability for new players to skip through the early levels makes it mobile game like.
---
It's what mobile games do because it works. It's psych or something idk. Gives you loads of dopamine hits early on like "wow I'm moving up so fast! look at all that I'm unlocking!" then the freebies end and you're chasing that dopamine high so you either buy plex/skill injectors to do so or just quit cause you can't chase it.
---
Actually plex is one item i never invest. 
---
I am happy as it will let me run more ganking chars
---
That’s because providence is dead now (because of blackout), not because people don’t want a fight. There’s barely anyone left in assfrigs/t3ds, and those obviously don’t want to fight a VNI, and I haven’t seen anyone roaming in anything bigger, outside of a Test HAW dread meme’ing around 9UY for an hour (goes to show exactly how dead providence is right now)
---
Weeellll you ruined it for me.
---
I don’t think I’ve actually read the billboard in over a year loool. I can see his face clearly tho.
---
Choose faction for your best waifu
---
Each faction has different appearance and char portrait is very important.
---
Same bruh, but dumber: 178m sp, 1.8m ready to rock.
---
Play tft while you rat
---
"Has anyone complained about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
---
On this subreddit? Yes.
---
Yeah defense fleets generally tend to be ignored or everyone and their dog shows up, and then FC has the uninteresting task of catching 5 Brutixes with a 50 man HAC fleet.
---
Hard to argue that....
---
They probably have a log in with Facebook option.
---
Can you quit too please?
---
lowsec is so much more dangerous than null its not even funny. Null is a cakewalk in comparisson
---
Wasn't even a few years ago, it was last year. And I too just sold mine for 300m. They were selling for like 50m during the event. I farmed a handful and were using them, but since they have gone up so much in price I decided to sell them all.
---
Why such the difference?
---
Once you get older you can join us for the \~300 day queues.  Nothing will meaningfully better for me for at least that long. edit: this isn't a complaint, just saying it's fun to see the discrepancy of goal lengths as one plays.
---
They probably should make daily rewards for actions like killing rats or shit a thing that activates day 1 when you create a char and goes on for about 1-2 months, so it  help newbros but not skill farmers and vets.
---
removing the market would also fix bots
---
Same, been Null since 2007, was only in HS for a week before the move, my Eve cycle is i burn out after about 7 months of play then return after about a year break, rinse repeat.  This burnout cycle i decided to do it a bit different, since I have never mined or built anything i finally decided to start a HS account and i am having more fun in HS then I have had in a long time. Doing the missions and relaxing next to a pile of Velspar to mine is just the reboot i needed, actually did lvl 4 missions in a fleet with a bunch of 1 day to 1 month old players, was fun.
---
But it doesn't get a missile bonus
---
Great video! Very nice and well thought out progression through explaining how this thing works.
---
&gt; Keep enjoying it and don't worry about the opinions of this sub
---
Especially ignore the text based vomit that StainGuy spews out constantly.
---
Except the matter is moving in relation to a fixed central point.
---
Talk to your Corp CEO, see if you can take an extended break without being kicked. Most will usually be fine with it.
---
Isn’t the point of the Domi that it’s cheap? Why bling fit it lol? Dinobrain
---
I would still fit it with a full rack of torps for the memes.
---
It is if you're a spy/infiltrator and are using the target alliance's nice market to profit from personally while also simultaneously fucking their market by de-seeding :)
---
Like buying out contracted doctrine munins from a target alliance, replacing the munin with ruptures, and re-listing them as doctrine munins on alliance contract. You'd be surprised how well this actually works in practice XD
---
If you are enjoying yourself you are already ahead of the competition.
---
&gt;hat incident was 7 years ago
---
I was at that Fanfest. It was a fairly decent-sized flap at the time :-), I didn’t hold it against him although he should know not to attack people who have genuine issues, and that is an issue for a worrying % of our number, sadly.
---
Also, this is EVE. These things live forever, since we’re immortals and that is how our reputation is made.
---
/I don’t have anything against The Mittani. He’s actually as smart of a cookie as you have to be to thrive in that insane asylum we love to call home.
---
Eh lol, summertime, look at fleet numbers.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Doesnt need one. RNI doesnt have a damage bonus, just application and range (neither of which apply to RHML i might add).
---
8 torps with 3 BCUs is still 948 dps before drones. Has more alpha than a t1 raven, just shoots slower. Also, a triple BCU t1 raven or navy scorp is also 948 dps. So its still balanced for dps. It would just be a tankier t1 missile battleship option.
---
8x RLML Rokh?
---
yes pls
---
As a die-hard creodron customer, I endorse your campaign.  CCP MUST ADDRESS THIS.
---
Pretends that this is behavior exclusive to goons.
---
I think 3x warp core stabs is probably plenty, as it prevents faction scrams from stopping you. If you get hit with 4 points of warp disruption you’re likely dead anyways. That extra slot could then be used for a nanofiber instead for faster movement.
---
Like buying out contracted doctrine munins from a target alliance, replacing the munin with ruptures, and re-listing them as doctrine munins on alliance contract while shipping the repackaged hulls out of their space to resell. You'd be surprised how well this actually works in practice XD
---
If you're just wanting to look up orders, market.fuzzwork.co.uk 
---
Though its typical of my design aesthetic. And that's the story I'm sticking to. Its not that I cant think up a decent design.
---
Sure, why not. People already fly them with medium blasters.
---
your friends might leave because of how toxic they think the game direction and dev changes are and the reddit community cheers 
---
You ask if you can within the rules return the favor and they get butthurt and offended
---
You should have picked a better target audience, but this is sad how edgy this community tries to be
---
Here I thought that would be someone on /r/Eve
---
Better yet! Give us a faction rokh already!!!!!
---
Make this one a dedicated missele ship, and let's shot ze misseles on ze brique!!! xD
---
Nullsec is safer than lowsec.
---
Yeah it's not in the milky way. I would like to note that in the old EVE intro it says; **"The first brave pioneers to enter this portal emerged unscathed, instantly transported across the universe, to a virgin system they called New Eden."**
---
&lt;lore&gt;It's not rocket powered. The warp core drags the ship around by its center of mass.&lt;/lore&gt;
---
Sometimes it bums me out that I was born during this time, and not say another 100 years from now when hopefully our understanding and capabilities are greater.
---
It feels good! :)
---
On a tangent here... But funny enough, this skill season CCP is implementing will most likely give me the final push to reach 100M skill points on my main character! 
---
Delicious milestone. xD
---
Wormholes are fantastic!
---
Implying that side launch would be better than glorious Vertical Launch tube action.
---
&gt; I think it's a great way to get new players into a ship that they feel makes a difference in whatever they chose to do.
---
Even more so with the recent changes to recruitment program. They can now get 1,000,000 SP instead of 750k.
---
For a new player, those 1 million SP are fucking massive.
---
Which one of these guys would like to rape then kill a fresh young player, like yourself.   rape, THEN,  kill is important in this situation 
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/PGd7hbZ29DM6N8rr8
---
Because people are under the impression that Null sec is full of people who want to nothing but pod you, your family, and your pets. When in reality there's not all that many people. Low sec is full of pirates hunting brave care bears who are under the impression that low sec is safer than null sec.
---
Some general tips for new traders:
---
* Get your faction standings up - Station trading has been made even more competitive outside of TTT due to recent tax changes, standings are even more important to narrowing down how much ISK is lost to individual fees.
---
* Never over-leverage yourself - This applies both in terms of ISK put into escrow and how many open orders you have. You never want to dump all of your ISK into trading, play it safe when starting out. Also, always keep some market order slots open, you never know when you'll come on some quick scalp that you need to dump before the margins close. Or when someone fat fingers an order and you can grab free ISK from them.
---
* Understand your market - Knowing what to trade usually requires a bit of meta knowledge, as the most commonly traded items like ammo have a lot of competition. Identifying reasonable margins is a big part of this, but you must keep an eye on trade volumes. If an item only trades a couple times a week, that ISK will be stuck in escrow for a long time. Also, never try to trade more than you can shift in a single day as a new trader. Always trade well below the total daily volume at the start to protect yourself from ISK getting frozen in market orders. Because if the margin closes while you're stuck with excess stock, you just lost ISK.
---
* Keep track of your margins - Be aware of how much you're spending in broker fees, taxes and other transactions costs, make sure your margins cover these costs. [Here's a tool](https://evetrade.space/) that can take some of the hard work out of that. Some will even use these kinds of margin checks to identify what items to trade. This can work but swings in the market can work against you.
---
* Be consistent - You don't have to login every minute of every day, and accept that you have to do some .01 ISKing if you're just station trading in one place. But to be successful, you have to keep your orders updated.
---
hot take: I don't think moving capitals should be allowed near downtime.
---
Disable cynos for 1 hour on either side of DT.
---
So we use the warp core for sub light speed too? The thrusters are only for the looks? I doubt the lore guys are that dense.
---
what’s NRT?
---
Tokyo Narita airport.
---
How many times does this crap need to be reposted?
---
How old is your account?
---
Hecate is smaller and faster base speed. And 1 web roughly counters an AB in terms of range control.
---
Squishy flies dualweb fits.
---
Nah even after playing 1 year i'm still considered a "noob" (low SP) in Eve and probably another year, they just need to make those "Free SP" un-extractable
---
i would recommend some other "drastic measure" like remove skill injector and make the "free SP" don't apply to capital skill and their Lv5 requirement but i don't think CCP want that'
---
Beta alpha same thing, and it’s close enough...
---
And it’s opened to registration...
---
Running Eve's *only* legitimate ISK doubling service, of course.
---
no one hits my domi except me!!
---
-TEST dread, probably
---
Eve for me is like a really expensive chatroom
---
R'lyeh is 30b years.
---
Evepraisal? Hello? HellooOoo
---
Best bet would be to just drop 20 bucks on PLEX.
---
Tbh that probably isn't good way to do it as anyone with half a brain knows it's a scam
---
Obviously, but it isn't sustainable solution
---
I don't think you appreciate how high a standard you are setting there.
---
Honestly I'd like to know how many fall for that classic scam.
---
Wait it actually gives you million sp? I thought it only gave you 250000
---
Ganking
---
If looking to do missions, should train up your social skills which helps a lot to get higher level agents faster.
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203209712-Rookie-Griefing  
---
Thats the line.
---
The wallet approach takes the work aspect out of playing the game.   If you are attempting to do this to plex the account it will be a second job for you on average.  
---
Join a null alliance and move, high sec isk is pretty horrible unless your doing very specialized things that are not new player friendly.   Even with the blackout you will still be way ahead doing things in null vs high.
---
except amarr also happen to be the faction that specializes in out-neuting everyone else. Not counting pirate factions of course.
---
Probably should do that, lvl 1 and 2 won't pay much and are really boring to run in confessor
---
This. I decided a little space trucking might be fun, and haulers chat has made the whole experience much better
---
Plus I'm moving people's stuff around, so it reslly feels like I'm a part of this game's famous economy
---
Yeah it took me three weeks to get killed in all those places
---
Care to tell about these spesific stuffs? Do you mean station trading and hauling? (wich require few billion capital to get into)
---
Thanks. Can you tell me how to push standings the fast way?
---
Someday that'll be me
---
If there would be one best way, everyone would do it.
---
Problem is, if everyone tries to do it, profits will go down for many reasons.
---
So everyone is pretty secretive about the best way to earn ISK in highsec that fits their playstyle.
---
L4 missions if any kind, incursions, combat anomalies, rifts things into the abyss, mining, scamming, hauling, ganking, trading, ninja salvaging... there are many ways (in no particular order).
---
Chose one that you think you might enjoy and try to be most efficient over time. Experiment and adaot your playstyle.
---
Remember. EVE time is spare time, which shiuld be used recreational, so if it feels like work, try something else.
---
dO yOu HaVe A cLeAr ViSiOn? H
---
hE dOeS!!
---
I need to give that another shot, I tried it for a bit and never scanned down anything interesting
---
No its not the same thing and registering for a closed alpha doesn't automatically mean you'll get an invite either.
---
Guess I stick for abyssals for now, and try to get better and go back to wormholes. And maybe go wardecking.
---
Here I thought that would be TEST Alliance chat
---
PI, exploration, ratting, mining are all much higher isk rewards than in highsec.   
---
Yes with the blackout you are in more danger now but even that is all dependent on how well you pay attention to intel and dscan.
---
Im considering on going back to wormholes a bit later. That was fun.
---
Hauling valuable cargo from a high tax location (Jita 4-4) to a low tax location (Perimiter TTT). 
---
It's super extra high-sec, so don't worry about gankers, any T1 industrial is fine. If you want to really make money, keep your isk invested in the market, not in your ships.
---
We Should  just embrace her for what she really is and give her a smartbomb bonus! All hail the disco queen!
---
( Permaband for the win!)
---
Isn't jita "the most dangerous hi sec" In the game?
---
WH life can be rewarding, I just dont have the time for it anymore so I moved to null.
---
You forgot one:
---
Bitter Vets - People who have EVE version of Stockholm Syndrome. They hate the game so much. They claim it's dying (since 2008), yet log in more hours then anyone else.
---
If the lifeblood of the game is fcs, market platers, haulers, solo pilots, gankers, roleplayers, etc.
---
Where do we get new ones if not from newbies trying out the game and sticking to it?
---
Heh, yet the reason I left EvE last time was failing to log in for a few days and not knowing about a wardec that destroyed my tower.  So YMMV with the whole 'don't need to log in every day' thing.
---
*from the senate
---
Lol. No local in null is toxic? GTFO
---
Big iq time
---
As a returning vet I've also really loved the little boosts.  Since I am way over the alpha limit, but trying the game on an alpha account, it let me try out new things like the ORE mining frigate.
---
You go and do that. Let us know how it works out for you.
---
What do new players have to do with you and your friends being huge crybabies that cannot handle the removal of local. Holy shit can't you just quit instead if this somehow made the game unplayable. I sometimes wonder what players like you do in this game tbh.
---
Buy low sell high. It's that easy
---
Join RvB and finally blow all that isk you have saved up over the years! We will liberate you, at the same time you can have fun.
---
We relight that old flame in many a pilot. Never give up just try it from a different angle.
---
Same
---
lmao retard
---
What is in 300 day queues?
---
i just said this community is unnecessarily toxic.  
---
your response “lol? Gtfo”
---
My point is made
---
One thing I do NOT like about this game so far is the apparent need for alts. Kinda feels broken and helps people with cash and IT prowess irl.
---
They're not thrusters, they're exhaust.
---
It's the lore reason for why ships act so much like submarines.
---
I can only imagine how many new players have been lost over running into a 2+day skill train. "Oh this won't be trained for a few days, guess I will just play again then." Then never logs back on. These events give new players are reason to play daily. And having SP to instantly train some low skills to get a taste of an activity is far more forgiving than having to invest and then probably have to wait until your next play session to even try.
---
Getting Isk through selling Plex isn't sustainable? How much isk are you going through?
---
and what do you think an fc started the game as?
---
You can do bpo research buy cheapish bpos like missiles and research them to 10/20 and sell them on contract
---
I mean what is the point of playing eve if I need to solve my isk problems by paying € to get isk
---
It used to have 4 launcher hardpoints. It's been done and was changed in order to be a dedicated gun platform. Sorry you wasn't around then
---
All hail Papa Nurgal
---
The Loki has a  50% bonus to raw AB boost. There’s no way a propless Hecate could keep up if the Loki had heated his AB, even with dual webs.
---
Good riddance. We want Pvpers anyway
---
Enough to keep people doing it
---
Here's some food for thought: if it weren't worth their time they wouldn't bother doing it in droves.
---
Jita is top 1 on zkill. By this measure it is the most dangerous.
---
Why is noone suggesting Incursions
---
Jeez man just let me have my fun, I’m just excited that I *might* get the chance to try out eve online mobile edition
---
Well on TEST fleets some people are calling Seddow Seddowo
---
&gt; Some of my friends are affected to a point that they are not playing and I am worried about many of them unsubscribing EVE for good.
---
&gt; qualifies as reason for engaging in a war against new players as retaliation
---
You father must have been a weak nothing of a worm if this is how you turned out.
---
I'm fairly sure they are just bots who spam it to chat every x minutes
---
You can buy/sell flip things in Jita well enough. Just watch volumes, and consider how often you want to update orders. You don't want to be stuck with 300 items when daily volume is 50 and you are only updating orders twice a day.
---
Understand the graphs, the donchian channel can be a good quick visual indicator of things to avoid without further thought.
---
Diversify, many of the more established traders can tank a market if they want.
---
This is all very general, I haven't been playing in about 8 months. When I was, I was most recently building t2 rigs in Amarr and it was pretty profitable, and doing longer term hull speculation in Jita. The daily station trading was less interesting for me than producing something people needed for their ships.
---
Also, I had initially started market trading with 50m until I was confident I wouldn't lose it doing something stupid.
---
Regular combat sites have a chance of a faction spawn that has a chance to drop nice loot. But more importantly the combat sites have a chance to trigger an escalation. That's where the money making loot drops.
---
probably play that mobile trash they are about to release, but we all know you will do that anyway...
---
Advice to ship in t1 industrials is awful unless you're only shipping 10 million isk at a time or something.
---
My HG Talismans and blinged out Bhaalgorn would like to have a word.
---
No one can prove that that isn't the case. Cosmology is mostly guesswork at this point.
---
Then report them for botting.
---
How much isk are you going thru?
---
What you need to kill those escalations? Is confessor with t2 lasers enough?
---
Any maurader will cover these perfectly - provided you can handle cap pressure and can hit fast little frigates. 
---
Personally, I love my Kronos and it loves to blast triglav ships to dust.
---
I’d love any reason to fly a Rokh again. Maybe I’m weird, but it’s one of my favorite looking hulls.
---
Usual ship loss is something between 100-300m confessors/gilas/kikikomoras. I have atm total of 1.2b isk. So it's not a problem for a while in hi sec. Just trying to find out what to do there to obtain good isk
---
So far I've only done relic and data sites. The loot there is pretty decent, usually enough to more than pay for your ship and modules in each site, and sometimes a whole lot more. I've heard combat sites are pretty intense. I haven't looked into them yet, but the salvage from those wrecks is probably worth a shitload.
---
There are also gas clouds which can be extracted. That's what I'm looking to get into next. If you have Omega, there are ORE ships with class and role bonuses geared towards "huffing" the gas, but it can be done in any ship with turret hardpoints that can be flown through a wormhole. There's a guy in Mining chat who huffs gas in a Gnosis. If you talk to him, he can get you started and tell you about some of the hazards you might face while extracting gas in J-Space.
---
Yeah, TDF fleet makes 31.5m for the best sites, takes about 7-10 minutes and they will run these for hours.  You will need a Battleship and some decent T2 skills just to start, however.
---
That's good to know. Still though, I think the name would have been better suited for one of the smaller and faster ship on the tree. Maybe the interdictor class, since they've got better warp speed than other ships.
---
Is there a general chat for j-space stuff?
---
It still has 4 launcher hardpoints, im saying give it 4 more for a total of 8 launcher hardpoints. Meaning the Rokh could be a gunboat or missile boat.
---
If youve the sp and starting isk, incursions are a great way to make money and still have a social aspect of actual people to interact with... bar that doing some low level escalations or missions.
---
Ive always taken on the outlook of the best way to make money in hisec is to go to nullsec but if youre not into pvp then the latter 2 would be your go to.
---
My alt's Bustard hits over 650k ehp (with overheating). It's fairly blingy, but not overboard.
---
I think the problem here is "netease" as opposed to "mobile."
---
Plenty of good legit games on mobile, but a ton of bad studios.
---
Pvp is fun, currently trying out hi sec. Probably going back to wh, or find null people since all fun like bombs, and smartbombs are banned in hi and low sec.
---
It depends on the escalation. DED 3/10 could get dicey. 4/10 is gonna depend on if you have the dps and speed tank. 1/10 cake 2/10 ezpz.
---
Edit: come to think of it i don't think that 1/10 and 2/10 will admit t3ds i think that t2 destroyers are the biggest ships that can get in.
---
&gt; it would be better if we would ~~fix this.~~make this the default behavior
---
FTFY
---
Guess I need to get better ship than confessor, using my wolf rayet solo fit to run those hi sec sites.
---
Ty good sir, the time line was a little blurry on my memory
---
lets do the same for the typhoon, it doesn't have nearly enough rapid jesus hardpoints.

I kinda agree that people with multiple alts can have an advantage. However contrary to what everyone on this sub says, you ARE NOT required to have any alts to enjoy the game. I played for 5 years before making my first alt and experienced everything from losec piracy to living in jspace. Sure alts can be helpful, but you don’t NEED any to find success in Eve.

What does sponsoring do?

I got burnt for a good while myself. I didn't sub for about 5 months after 5 years of playing pretty consistently. It gave me back my craving for the game, thats for sure. The only mistake I may have made was re-joining the same huge coalition I was in before, but for right now it's all good, and taking some time off helped me narrow my focus and I have a better idea of what I enjoy doing most.  
---
Different strokes for different folks, but it certainly helped me to just put it out of my mind until that time came when I couldn't get it out of my mind again.
---
Have you tried filaments?
---
FINALLY
---
Yes t1-3,they were okayish, especially 3.
---
Very nice video! As a daytime Finance Geek and night time EVE player, I got a kick out of this video. For the part about the investment side of the calculation, I don't think you will ever be able to get an accurate figure as it is mostly done behind closed doors with a smaller group of super-wealthy individuals. There are a few though like IChooseU who make their investments available to the general public. Last I checked they offered interest-bearing bonds in 2 billion isk increments which make monthly interest payments.
---
Highest would be doing abyss sites. 
---
You can make more potentially doing other things, but you need a quiet and low traffic area for most of them. 
---
Incursions are good money, but bad for the new player that doesn't have the isk or skills.
---
One good way is to hunt for good escalations, but it's time consuming and often sends you to lowsec.
---
yeah, I noticed that. The number increase each time you open the contract, and then comes back to its proper value after downtime
---
I enjoy doing them :) what did you use for the T3?
---
looooooooool
---
Alpha, make one of each and train them up.
---
Gila, and rapid light launchers
---
Phoon is fine, RoF bonus is the same as 8 launchers dps wise.  Also, 8 launchers + RoF bonus would be very high dps, essentially it would be a faction BS for t1 pricing. It would also need to move a slot since a t1 phoon doesnt have 8 highs.
---
Take a look at the magnate and tell me what kind of exhausts those are? Seems like the lore guys are actually dense (and/or the 3d Designers)...
---
Thx for answering though, I never had much interest in/knowledge about lore. :)
---
Unless you're a high SP character already, then it's more like "Ah, thanks to the 1mil SP I just learned how to open the trunk of my super."
---
I know I was just playing around because my RHML phoon does like 1300 DPS lol
---
I call it the poon phoon because I'm very funny and original!
---
Lossmail plz
---
Besides the censorship, internal espionage, and repression of ethnic minorities, sure.
---
Which is a great goal
---
When you first start out and have to do a few dozen skills to 3-4, t2 small at half speed is not gunna happen for a long, long time. Much better priorities to work on.
---
If you want to know about activity in jspace you can look up some nice data that was graphed based on zkill data.
---
ahhh okie
---
Mainly stuff for supercarriers and titans and stuff. I have near perfect subcapital skills on my main and i think the longest train was 37 days for..... i dont even remember. Battleship V? I think?
---
probably the most fitting would be the new wolf, which is very fast, and a powerful ship
---
maybe jaguar too. 
---
Vaga was always a fast and cool ship.

worse than the confessor actually. But for 1/10 and 2/10 they are so easy you can do them in pretty much any kitey t1 frigate because they have very short range. An imicus with 3 ddas and a mwd is enough.
---
I really like this idea. Give the brand new starting player a reason to log in and actively engage in the game.
---
I'd suggest also mixing up the action that earns the SP a bit to encourage new players to try different things. Kill a rat. Mine X amount of ore, scan down a signature, salvage a wreck, shoot at another player(!) etc.
---
You're not burned out... This is EVE. Undock, scan around, see nothing, fly a few jumps, scan around, see nothing, fly a few more, scan around, see nothing, fly back, dock up, log off. Day after day.
---
Yes!
---
We want to buyback resources from our players via contracts made private to corp that players get their pricing from using a method we provide.
---
The problem is...
---
Anyone can accept contracts in the corp then. What is the best way to easily manage a buyback program through contracts that can only be accepted on behalf of corp instead of anyone in corp.
---
i have the same problem, so i play wow now... and not even classic, i play retail... wormholer btw
---
good sax are cool guys
---
Wow. I have half braindead Krabs that lose orcas in combat sites who cry less and are less risk adverse. I hope you idiots lose your space.
---
For long, I've been wanting a top kills, together with sidebar statistics (top pilots, top corps, etc) for the solo page -  [zkillboard.com/kills/solo/](https://zkillboard.com/kills/solo/), like each ship or pilot has available. 
---
Would make it easier to see what others fly when they are flying solo, for inspiration, as well as add some competition/prestige for a playstyle that needs more love!
---
I'm clearly not a goddess, cause I keep on having boy problems.

This all reminds me of when I got caught cheating on my fiancee, hahahahhahaha
---
He's not "returning the favor". Day one newbies had nothing to do with the null blackout. He's lashing out at actually defenseless people who are still learning how to warp. Unsubbing IS returning the favor, and if that's what they want to do they're welcome to that option.

Great video.  But those estimates based on delve would just be goons.  The imperium controls more space than that so it’s a low estimate.  It also ignores a lot of activity.
---
But where is the peanut butter?!
---
My succulents fly better than this
---
There's a perfectly valid argument that goes like this:   
---
Free SP giveaways reduce the overall 'value' of SP. 
---
I used the recent SP giveaways to train-up a capital alt. That means more capital-proliferation, skewing the meta a little bit more. 
---
More SP means more ISK/hour, meaning more inflation problems.   
---
CCP needs to be careful to not overdo the promotions unless it starts to affect overall game-balance. I'm 100% OK with the recent promotions, but there's a fine line where it'll start causing problems.

Also a much more condensed version maybe a mini fac war but using citidels in 6 sytems. Each side controls 3 systems and if you destroy their first citidel you can place your own. Ideally it goes back and forth in "rounds".

Nice video! I saw a couple minor mistakes, nothing too major. You showed a graphic that said alphas can fly ships up to t1 cruiser, they can actually fly up to battleships. You also said zkill had every kill in the game when it only has the ones people upload manually or via api.

But that's for warp, not for sublight. Is there anything in the lore about how sublight works?

Once again, you are wrong. Sandbox does not mean do whatever the fuck you want. Are you able to destroy NPC stations? No. Why? Try to guess. I don't want CCP to cater to my style. You are still delusional about what I do or that I lost something to a suicide gank. Move on pleb, there is nothing here for you. So, one more time for your little incapable brain, if you have one at least....Suicide ganking is sometimes used to grief new players since it does not have real consequences and thus causes low new player retention rates. GTFO.
---
A few more tips : 
---
\- Make safes around gates, don't jump from gate to gate  
---
\- Make safes in middle of warps, people tend to warp off to planets/belts when they see a camp or are being chased. It is far more easy to find someone that is warping near celestial bodies.  
---
If you make safes during warps, then they will need combat probes to find you. and you see them on dscan and know when to warp to your next safe.

Prove it motherfucker.  Saying it over and over again doesn't mean shit.  Back it up.  Or better yet, stop playing the game.
---
If you have to ask this question, you know the answer.
---
Thats not quite true. They use standard sublight thrusters (which is why aux thrusters and low friction nozzles and afterburners exist), but having the warp core online at all is what causes submarine shit, something something higgs field basically.

yeah it's been a bit since I lived out there so my data is probably wrong.  They used to bring small groups of caps (like 15-20 dreads max) and you could have nice little brawls.  Sadly that was mostly over money moons in the area and CCP saw fit to kill that off.
---
This comment has really just proven how stupid you really are and that there is no point actually talking to you.

They can’t form more than 4 or 5 caps now, they’re just Frat pets

Thanks for your advice. I plan to inject Min BS today so I'll try it out!
---
Pi on even three chars in hisec will give you 30 mil or so every 4 days - that’s about 225 mil isk a month passive. One plex is about 3.2 mil currently, 500 plex is around the price of a takeaway pizza. So buying plex every three months plus pi profits gives you a burnable stack of over 2 bill every three months. Add a secondary revenue stream of two and you could be space upper lower class.

It looks like this on high settings aswell.

I haven't played even in a long long long time. Saw this battleship hanging near a gate that I could activate a kill warrant on, thought what the hell.  To my astonishment he was AFK as I slowly bashed it.  Now I realize it's probably a scam, but I'm unclear how it works.
---
Thanks for the replies! That helps a lot!
---
But I don't get it, you can put a bounty on yourself, then collect it when you die? Or I guess you use an alt, kill your alt, your alt puts a massive bounty on yourself... then some idiot (like me) activates it without thinking, alt gets the money, alt transfers the money to primary account ?
---
With low capital I suggest you invest into "leopard" 20AU warp speed and use hunt for cheap items abroad. You can use external trade feed pages to find the stuff which is someone selling for much cheaper. Jump into leopard pick it up and deliver to Jita. Sell, rinse and repeat you will be trilionaire before you can spell SCHVEC.

Best free advice man you got -1 for it. People these days cannot appreciate a true friend 😉

Planetary interaction or Planetary production. Take a look on the eve university website. You think vaguely about it for a bit, stick some things on planets, connect them up in an awful interface. Click go, come back later and you will have stuff that other people will buy. Minimal skills are needed meaning it’s something that you can setup on every char slot you own. 
---
Rewards are minimal in hisec and better in wormholes or null but it is entirely passive isk.
---
Considering the video was about goons though. They are api verified and all their losses should be there.
---
Rubs your face in it.
---
You've got it. Sucks that you got scammed. Good that you've pieced everything together.
---
I've been playing off and on since 2005 and have never used more than one account. I do use the other two characters for various things but generally only to log on for a few minutes and update industry/PI. Everything else is done on a single character.
---
My net worth is only about 9 billion and i have a little over a billion in liquid isk, but I can fly lots of things and do most in-game activities. I make more than enough to replace the stuff I fly, including in PvP.
---
You don't need alts except for very specific things (and technically those can be done with other people instead).
---
In fact, I would go farther and argue alts are overrated, especially on alt accounts. Here's why.
---
There are two ways to pay for alt accounts. First, you can pay for them. Each one multiplies your game cost by that amount. Now you can get double the isk income, right?
---
Sort of. There's an opportunity cost with an alt account. If you're spending $15 a month on an alt, you *aren't* spending $15 a month on PLEX to sell in Perimeter. Unless that single alt is going to earn you the same isk as $15 in PLEX you aren't actually gaining anything from the account...and your *actual* gains are only what you earn in excess of the PLEX value. Many people don't take this into account when they brag about their isk income. And unlike just buying PLEX, you have to do more in-game work to make that alt profitable, and either have to wait for it to train or buy injectors, which mean its slower than PLEX as well.
---
The other option is to pay for the account with PLEX using isk it earns. But this has the same ultimate issue...your actual income with the extra account is only what it earns in excess of the isk used to pay for omega. So if an alt earns 3 billion in a month, and spends 2 of that on PLEX, you've earned 1 billion isk/month for that alt. Which is less than an industry/PI character on the same account, except the industry character is more friendly to vacations.
---
Ultimately, does someone with more accounts make more isk? Yes, but only in very specific situations with specific setups, and those often take a lot of game time to create. Each account you add essentially adds a ~$15/2 billion isk "tax" to your game play time, and unless you recoup that expense you'd be better off with a single account.
---
It's really not as big of an advantage as people act like it is, *especially* for more casual players. And more casual players are not going to have the income of more hardcore ones, period, no matter the number of accounts. Active isk income takes time.
---
You can enjoy Eve just fine with a single account. I do and I have no interest in multiple ones. As long as you have the income to fund what you want to play, who cares if you have 100 bil or 1 bil? Or even 500 mil? People get far too obsessed with flying the shiniest bling they can when you can have just as much fun in a cheap shitfit you can fly dangerously and crazily. I have 60 mil SP and nearly everything I fly is a T1 or T2 frigate/destroyer/cruiser. And they are a ton of fun.
---
warp to a spot out of line with the gate, like in a normal horisontal system a spot 250+ KM above or below the gate.
---
From there warp to the gate once you can see what is on grid.
---
Anyone else have a total system failure when creating a new character on a dual monitor setup?
---
I've tried to create a new character three times now but when I reach the screen where it asks for a name, the client will freeze for a moment and then goes completely haywire where my keyboard doesn't respond and ultimately leads to a blue screen or requiring a hard reset.
---
Alts are a thing.
---
Alt A goes and shoots Alt B, giving Alt B a Killright.
---
Alt B puts the 190m price tag.
---
You pay Alt B (really just paying the same player) to blow up Alt A.
---
Insurance pays Alt A for the loss of their ship.
---
Now the player (after rearranging wealth between A and B) has the KR price tag, plus the insurance, to cover the loss of the ship.
---
The one on Steam gives 250k, the one currently sold for example at CCP's own website gives 1mil.
---
&lt;3 1977
---
Video was good too.
---
It's hard to get a figure for government spending for the Imperium as ships aren't replaced at a 1:1 value (Very close however), not all ships are covered and our space jews do release a monthly SRP report on how much was spent and on who but there is more spending beyond that factored in as well as taxes collected by all the Imperium.

Your wormhole corp happen to be recruiting, by chance? Been a while since iveived in a hole, wouldnt mind going back with a chill group.

If you're trading in Jita, which you likely will be given how dead some of the other trade hubs are, you can push Caldari Navy standings with the [Data Center Missions](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Data_centers#Kamokor). This isn't cheap for a new player, but it's a quick way to push standings a few points.
---
It's not a scam tho, you can see exactly what you get before you pay the killright.
---
Oh?
---
You might be a perfect candidate for wormhole space, being an explorer who knows how to dscan.
---
I guess the Keres, interceptors, logi, recons, links and anything other than the F1 people don't deserve recognition either
---
Enjoy your 190mil killmark.
---
Yeah, it's not perfect but I find it to generally help me more than hinder - we don't get in bigger fights that often.

Fucking peanut butter, CCP needs to add Skippy BPOs already.

This one time a maller with a 10m killright changed it to 10b in the time it took me to lock and bump him once.
---
He died though.
---
Backdoor sluts 9 was a classic.

Fighters 5 was painful.

It's not really a scam tho. You paid for a killright, you got the right to kill him.

You made your choice, with no hidden information.
---
No you?  Stop being dumb?

oh that shitfit needs a lot of things

I didn't use alts until over half a decade in the game. It's all about what you make it.
---
Amarr certainly can do tough and tanky.
---
60 days for JDC 5 for BLOps bridging.   That was a painful one.   
---
Made more painful by everyone I knew stopping blops runs after I finished it.   I'll have a reason to buy that Sin someday....
---
Oh yes, I fell in love with Thrashers the moment I sat in one.
---
I literally thought that nobody fell for that stuff...
---
Congrats on helping him earn twice what that ship is worth
---
I could sit in a Thrasher and look cute as hell, :3
---
Yeah but if you posted it on reddit, it would crash the servers.
---
Classic case of eve burnout try something you want to do or take a break it usually works.
---
Also insurance.
---
Can’t tell if toon soon joke....
---
Or the FBI is actually here.
---
Theres an eve related shitpost
---
There we go, just the response i expected from someone with nothing interesting to say, or anything useful to input.
---
Design is hard! Implementation of a design tends to be easier.
---
I’ve been using “jump desktop” on my iPhone to connect back to my pc at home. It allows you to get the full eve experience which is great while at work! Only downside is it can be tedious compared to using a mouse and keyboard sitting at your pc. Works like a charm for me though when I can’t be home.
---
I don't see how it is a "scam". You pay the isk to kill the ship. That's the deal.
---
No you.
---
Definitely sarcastic (but also secretly hopeful)
---
Why would you grief new players? Any new player is more than welcome to join Karmafleet to learn how to play in null sec!
---
EVE failed as a dating app. The gender distribution killed that aspect. Grindr already had the market share.
---
But it isnt. Its still quite dangerous. And honestly, if you compare Eve to many other MMOs the biggest thing that stands out between them are ideology. Eve is the superiour MMO yet its the smallest right?
---
Something is wrong and imo its ideology. We have crap retention because players get thrown into the deep end right away. Like I said, its griefers I dont like. Ganks are okey if they actually fulfill a purpose other than griefing cause one is bored. Without griefing its a much safer (psychological) place and it will give the player a sense of being able to stay safe long enough to learn the rules.
---
And I mean, at some point we actually have to start listening to the new players who are leaving reviews about how they got ganked and they dont wanna play the game anymore. Its too many to ignore.
---
But I very much like the idea of an AAR.
---
Also a noob question, but how best to do this? Whenever I "warp to X" It seems to always keep me on the same linear plane, just X distance from the target. How do I warp with...uh?...angular distance, I guess? Or is it really just warp to an object and then take the time to fly 250km "above / below" the gate and then bookmark it?
---
Lmao you cant even spell horror right
---
Where can you find the evernus tool?
---
lols, people who are grasping at straws usually go for that.  You and the Mittani have something in common :P.  No shit it's misspelled...its a user name, had to misspell to get it way back in the day.
---
Or make barghest cheap!
---
The whole point of skill farming is passive long-term income, so the number of skill farmers who go kill a rat for 10k sp is probably vanishingly low. 
---
The big-ticket login campaigns are another story, but because they're large amounts the amount of outrage from restricting those to new accounts would be a lot harder to manage.
---
"I miss spelled it on purpose, im not retard lol"

Yeah mate, gotcha

You are trying really hard to act smart and it's just not working out for ya.

I am not associating WormholePerson with my ingame identity.
---
But I can 100% recommend [Einstein-Rosen Brigade](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/erb-expand-your-horizons-in-wormhole-space/143508), they are ready to take players at any level and have better in-hole infrastructure than us, we were associated with them for a time and I can say they are good folks.
---
How new are you?  Have you done all 12 stations of career agents?
---
I had over 160m isk from running the agents and selling all the ships they gave me
---
Never touched caps, requires multiboxing or extreme trust in randos and I dont really care for either. Fighters V looks like one hell of a training tho
---
Nooo dont buff the rokh, I just ran out of my bpcs of it :( why you screw me over now?
---
Judging on how pimped the Damavik is -hasn't it's pilot never heard of Nergal?
---
it's not a scam, if you wanna kill it pay the killright and get it
---
it's a profit for the man who dies though
---
That is a straight up falsehood. They are such shitlers that they dont even have caps. The didn't drop a single one while evicting all of QFC.
---
Yeah I have way more cap skills than someone who didn't own an alt for six years probably should but of I ever want to Welp a carrier I can.
---
Its not hard to look smart when talking to you, so far all you have had to say is 
---
"No you, its wrong"
---
You really are a horrer
---
Alts - he just sold you killmail, while making a nice afk tick.
---
thank you :) I do take pride in my name.  On the other hand you are making it very easy to look pretty dumb right now.
---
lol htfu
---
boyz got skillz.. and killz
---
awesome work
---
Nice comeback once again,
---
"No you"
---
lol thanks!
---
Rub your eye after you check, let me know how that goes.
---
Only if you lick it after, daddy &lt;:(
---
Yes you make a perch by manually flying there, create a bookmark. Shortest distance is 155k, 200 is usually enough. So instead of warping to the gate you warp to your bookmark and see if gate is clear.
---
But dont linger at that place cause people can probe or just fly to the vicinity and bookmark the place themselves so they can catch you next time.
---
That's the protagonist.
---
Maybe he just wanted to say his farewells to the ship before he switched to the af
---
Its not inherently safer. Sometimes people on this sub are special.
---
NS is more dangerous than LS pure mechanic wise but if you go to where big blocks reside (in NS) its usually safer for the inhabitants. And its easier to roam around there as well since the big blocks dont care much about roamers (situational). The blackout has changed this tho.
---
But, a lot of NS space is empty atm so you can pretty much just venture around as much as you want to without risk.
---
&gt;in a ship just +1 step above you relies on you being perfect and them really fucking up.
---
Or meta counters.
---
They should give out SP the same way injectors are capped for certain levels. Giving less to players with already large amounts of SP. It wont fix the issue but it will slow it down.
---
Cheers :)
---
The damavik is a better ship.
---
You can do lvl4s in a Tengu easily...
---
Since wormholes can also move you through time, what if the EVE wormhole took us 26 billion years into the future.
---
Das ist Vas.
---
Do links assist your own ship or is it only other ships in your fleet
---
I would like to give new players the tools to understand the game.  Suicide attacks are very much a part of eve and something we should strive to keep imho. But new players need to be aware of it and given some understanding on how that works so they can plan for it. 
---
They are very much thrown into the deep end of the pool compared to other games. On this I feel we are in agreement.
---
the nergal is too mainstream.
---
yes

We used API for internal verification; but afaik, we do not share any API information with zkillboard.
---
Appreciate the dedication to opsec o7 
---
I will check them out for sure next time I'm feeling holey, thanks :)
---
yeah they assist your own ship also, I used to fly an awesome self-skirmish-boosting cane fleet. it whoops peoples asses because they don't expect a cane fleet to do 2.5k/s and have a 22km web. inties get alpha'd, it's hilarious
---
Yes. You can activate an extractor via your assets, you don't need to be in that station. The injector will then appear in the inventory of the station where the extractor was located.
---
Prove what exactly? Whining to me like a bitch won't make you right either. Don't like it? GTFO.
---
Recruit a few thousand botters/ no lifers. Have them swarm nullsec in ratting ships. Isk fountains without a corresponding sink cause inflation.
---
I don't get it.
---
I think this needs to end with a lossmail.
---
It was a bad investment, but the Scorpion's actions are designed to pressure you into making an impulse decision. 
---
You see the price of the killright. But you don't see the price of the fit, and you don't see the insurance payout (unless you ship scan, and research the insurance payout). It's deliberately hard for the 'victim' to get this information. 
---
Yes, it's technically not a scam, but you're splitting hairs over semantics.
---
Another killmail procured.
---
Tom? From Myspace? Where the fuck have you been man?!
---
Storytime? :)
---
Maulus : 22 fits.. hahaha.. Your pyfa looks similar to mine, do you also sometime need to take time to rename, update and remove fits?
---
good corp can recommend

Maybe you should have taken naming your character a little more seriously and you wouldn't have to suffer the grave consequences of ur actions

I started this game 22 years ago, those first few months were extremely enjoyable. Forget skill points, forget isk, just have fun at every stage, you'll have enough opportunities for frustration later.
---
Scams, bots, production, stock market hft  
---
taco bell job
---
Yeah. EVEN if new players came with unlimited SP they would still need to play and pay for experience and knowledge.  I am pretty sure, take any new player and give em full lvl 5 skills, a seasoned player will chew him.
---
I mean, my approach wouldnt be making HS into a fortress, more like making all systems into 1.0 so Concord responds faster meaning more ships required to kill. That way ganking is still viable but the cost of doing it goes up thereby lowering pure griefing. 
---
But as I stated in my first post HS has lots of other issues. The complexity in this game is stupid and instead of removing some CCP constantly adds more (information about when you are safe is part of this complexity/lack of information). And I really think newer players need a guide that truly guides you for the first 6 months or so of your gameplay, giving viable suggestions about activity and corps in different sec systems.
---
Scanned combat sites in hisec. Find a nice secluded area where it seems like anoms and signatures are building up, run 1-5/10 ded sites. Often you get garbage, tags and ammo. Other times you get valuable implants, blueprints, and deadspace/faction modules. Sometimes it gets frustrating when things don't work out, but other times it's possible to make 300 mil in an hour of work. The more sites you can run the better the odds it works out.
---
I would consider buying some skill injectors to speed things up. The game really gets fun when you can field a roqual so you'll want to skill into that straight away. They're really tanky and hard to kill so you'll be making at least 350mil isk/hr with basically zero risk  
---
you can use a fit like this if you're just getting started [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78301939/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78301939/)
---
This is the correct answer.
---
That’s going to sting a little :-)
---
More evidence that mommy's credit card doesn't buy skill
---
Good work, that's exactly the kind of approach that will hopefully get you hours of enjoyment from this game!
---
Lots of LowSec space _appears_ quiet, do keeping an eye out is wise indeed!
---
With the rise of the doughnut, is there a region in null that is still known for getting good solo and small gang fights?
---
Which goes to show you: you can’t buy your way into the big time. You can buy the PLEX to shoot up the skills to buy the boat, and then you don’t know what to do, where to go, how it works, why it works, who to talk to.
---
The learning curve is there for a reason. If you take the slow way, you’re going to make the mistakes at a reasonable price. If you think you’re skipping past the boring parts, you’re going to make the same mistakes but now they’ll cost a fortune.
---
But he already spent his quota for this year. It's all shit from here to january.
---
People usually do it in fast, small ships but if youre in something bigger or perhaps cloaked you can always warp in the direction of a celestial then warp back to the gate at 100k and bookmark it, then warp back to the celestial and warp 100k to your bookmark. Lazy mans approach, in general avoid making bms towards celestials because others might have done the same.
---
Jesus. Hope I can take part in something like that one day
---
I like this a lot.
---
Welcome to falling for reddit flair.
---
I mean heck they also had WW3 in Star Trek, seems like it's about time
---
He's not talking about PLEX the item, he's talking about novice (com)plexes that only allow T1 frigs
---
So i took the fight knowing damn well what the procurer could do. Dont really care about a space pixels loss. Been playing for so long hat expensive losses are just losses. If anyone in this thread wants to 1v1 find me in amamake, good for the procurer pilot. 
---
Dealing wih a support ticket directly about this fight. Will see if the error report i submitted wuth the ticket actually pans something else out other than "our logs show nothing".
---
Leave high sec
---
Daytrip exploration into wormholes is probably the best bet if you still want to live in HS.
---
Unpopular opinion - I'd rather see all pirate battleships just as expensive as the barghest.
---
My friend, no plex bought here ive been on this account for years, i honestly dont care, i log in for fun and fights whenever i want, look at my kb. Im aware of what the procurer does, wasnt expexting a closing client midway through the fight? But good for the guy who got the kill.
---
VNI can't launch 5 heavy drones now, Ishtar can.
---
[This was already done, but wayy better and with actual effort](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7d8uww/skill_injectors/?st=jz3bfi6v&amp;sh=978ace0e)
---
Guy thought he found a easy kill, the barge was fit with a tank, nutes, web, scram, and combat drones.
---
Look through the barge pilot’s history, he has got lots of unprepared people looking for cheep kills.
---
And hang around in bars.
---
Myrm or domi
---
Salty.
---
so I guess it's just a risk choice huh
---
Is my name :*
---
Yes. The more expensive and higher skill ship should be generating more isk.
---
yes.
---
either 'upgrade' to a dominix, or go cheap with a myrm.
---
Evidence of "i have my own job and support my own habits" dont like it? Well thats not my problem :)
---
last time i bothered to do the maths, 3 accounts was where it was better to have an orca than an extra miner.
---
This is true, but keep in mind that alphas have a 5 million sp limmit per character. This means you can't really train for every race on one, you've got to pick and specialize.
---
just change the guns to the meta 4 variant.
---
job done.
---
Not reeeaalllyyy look at my KB i do the same exact thing with a procurer, i just..... dont..... care.... hahha i bought another one, twice as expensive. Why you ask? Because i can. &lt;3
---
Myrm has been a consideration. it seems pretty equivalent to a vni
---
Thanks for the clarification. And hope. Hope is good.
---
There is, however, the 5 million sp limmit for alpha characters. It's better if you specialize alphas to fly specific factions and their strenghts. (IE, If you fly only caldari on a character, you don't need to spend much of those 5 millions on armor tank or laser skills).
---
Fair enough!😁
---
If i buy the starter pack on the website and select steam as payment method, do i get the steam's 250k sp or the full 1m?
---
Lol. Seriously though, do you have a link?
---
And then make one for each pirate faction.
---
Yeah...cluster shutdown in comparable to Tohoku. Mass hysteria and radiation leaks. Of course there is a tsunami that kills a ton of drones too.
---
that and several magnitudes cheaper than ishtar
---
But if i uses 3 retriever and get a fleet booster is better than 2 cov and 1orca?
---
My misreading. If you’re a seasoned hand, I’m not going to wag fingers. I was thinking about the guy who had his Navy Raven all blinged out, lost it, bought the same configuration and handed it over to one of the Goons, with PLEX in the hold!, so that he could transport it to null. That kind of thinking.
---
Obviously not applicable to you.
---
Fly however crazy you want. o7

Oh, I thought Caish had welped a fleet a la BB lol.

There's only one thing i dislike about caish fleets.
---
he pings for them when i'm at work, or asleep.
---
And with no tank you're going to get alpha'd away anyway. No need to scram you.
---
Stabs on an exploration frig are pointless (har har). You don't have enough tank, you'll get alpha'd out, no tackle needed.
