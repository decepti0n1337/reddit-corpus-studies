dont burn right into a structure and get stuck

but have they heard about the nipples? think of the nipples!

its based off of market data, so if things you own tank or spike in value, it will be reflected as well.

Uhh yeah that's some great advice but I came out of warp inside of it from a combat probe.

I'll most likely also be needing a translator next time I go out looking for bots, assuming PIBC turn up

Also bring some dignity and brain otherwise you might get scammed
---
We regularly have people break down and say things like "Im a grown as man, I don't have to take this shit from you" while essentially crying because we gave them critical feedback.
---

---
Yes blindly warping to cloaked eyes at 0 with no notice is stupid, yes we are going to call you out for doing something stupid.
---
being stuck in the physical model of something and bumping off of it, being unable to escape is not a bug and will not get you a reimbursement.
---
You could fly dual web shits while you get the hang of it, if you see others pop up outside your site on dscan, you can just full disengage.  AB/Web/Web hookbill/firetail are good at this.

Bring up the assets list for JEveAssets, should show you

Don't worry I'm not like those people who think Chinese culture is the same as ours regarding cheating in internet pixels

Reasonable reply to a reasonable post... who are you, and what have you done with my /r/eve?
---
No, but you do let me know that retards are all over the planet
---
Appearing inside of a large solid object and being unable to take any actions while your ship ping-pongs around doesn't seem a little buggy to you?
---
Yes, and you may be able to find one surprisingly close to home, if you look hard enough
---
more like CULT. amiright
---
Now it's probably my turn to bring a translator
---
how is running into something and bumping pff seem broken to you?
---
sucks to suck, lmao
---
It's just a little warm foamy piss.... Op may be R kelly.
---
Thanks to JBs geography is irrelevant. Thanks CCP.
---
Nothing about that sounds broken to me. Now appearing inside of a building and getting completely stuck inside of it with no possible actions you can take to free yourself besides self destructing sounds pretty broken to me.
---
Imagine having credit to give
---
The volume is from product that wasn't on the market. It's not that it wasn't in the game, it was simply never listed, sitting in peoples' inventories, especially those like I mentioned looking to appeal to collectors and such.

Chief among them that high end farming would simply shift heavily to mining, even more then it already is, and the loot-based ratting income just refined into more minerals.

hope u die op (in game).
---
ppl play games to escape irl. its not like they chose to be born there. most of the ppl ive talked too are awesome even if they think botting is ok. deff dont wont them all on our server and ruin it too, but bringing up the fact they live in a shithole and reminding them of pain and suffering is pretty fucked up.

if they banned watshisname for joking about cutting someones hands off, i hope they ban you op.

welp rip drones.  you know. enemies that dont drop anything.  guess thats a decent chunk of nullsec dead.

and its not like loot sells well. most people just dissasemble them cause they so worthless that it cant even buy ammo

what building did you get stuck in?

how did you get stuck in it?

Since news of this broke, Brisc has gone from high ranking member of a goon pet alliance, to high ranking goon, to head of goons, to entire leadership of goonswarm

Someone needs to have a good read of the ToS and EULA.

If ya ask me cyno's are more the problem than supers. dropping huge balls of Faxe'n'caps for a response seems to be a bit too easy from my perspective.
---
Increasing fuel cost for larger ships makes plenty of sense, I've got nothing against supercaps and all that jazz but I do find them to be a bit too mobile.
---
Anywho this is a boiling water frog situation they already got a nasty nerf recently no sense in adding insult to injury too soon or we might lose all our juicy cap pilots and that would be no fun now would it!
---
All of yous dudes complaining that ccp should do something about it - stfu git in an FVB fit stealth bomber with some mates and solve the problem one supercap at a time.

YASSSSSS!! Another Naz post upvoted!

It's incredible the number of people who seemed to think that he wouldn't lawyer up, and if he did nothing would come of it.

well if they weren't going to take botting seriously before they pretty much have to at this point.
---
Came out of warp dead center in a large citadel to which I didn't have docking rights. Would have had shit tons of time to warp away but it was impossible to align as my ship was getting pushed in a new random direction every tick. I warped to a ship that I had combat probed.

wolfpax. i see you're stealing NC.'s gimmick

Too bad. A lot of people all over the world play games to escape irl too, for rest and relaxation. And I'm sure there are tons of cool and chill chinese gamers, but when a large portion of their communities have the same "cheating is fine with chinese because whatever shitty excuse" in game after game, you can't really be shocked there is a little backlash from other people worried about seeing THEIR escape ruined by a community with completely different views on whats acceptable or not
---
He also spelled Bisc. :)
---
NCdots leadership has certainly said this to people before so it is very ironic.
---
Fuck it’s been awhile. Welcome back.
---
I can't imagine a letter from a lawyer would compel something like "we will issue a full and frank apology." Legal CYOAese has a certain minimalism to it, which this doesn't have. That last line sounds a whole lot like admitting fault (while you could interpret it as "we'll apologize to anyone we wronged, we just didn't wrong anyone" I can't imagine any lawyer advising CCP to promise to deliver "appropriate reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we’ve taken")
---
The only legal aspect of this is any attempt to invoke the legal consequences of breaking the NDA. Permabanning his account is something separate, that they can do at any time, for any reason, at their discretion, and aren't required to give any justification to anyone for. That's almost certainly what the last paragraph refers to (rather than handing any lawyers a blank check) and is thus about mollifying the community rather than deflecting legal consequences
---
are you really active in welpsquad? I haven't logged in, in like 2months :(
---
guess they don't like nano
---
 ya you gotta pay attention to where you warp to
---
Because you are able to tell the difference between a botter and regular player! /S
---
&gt; I would assume not all PIBC players are dirty rotten botting cheats
---
Just enough of them to have shut down Serenity, and now they wanna do the same thing on TQ.
---
\&gt; "Ayuh," CCP Enis said, pretending to be from a Stephen King novel. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This is around how far I got before I took notice of the new dev team member's name.
---
The thing is if they suspected an NDA violation there are real legal consequences they could bring to bear. Those wheels were probably set in motion, and the announcement about the bans was to keep the community informed/get ahead of any damage Brisc might try to do.
---
Waiwaiwait. So because """"""""wardeccers""""""" are the """""""risk""""""" in Highsec, they get to enjoy having zero risk?
---
Now rest of eve understands how important this is to NCdock they are likely to continued focus from groups ongoing. It also exposes several other vulnerabilities now by making this move that init and snuff might be excited by.
---
I don’t think market bots are as bad, they at least reduce the annoying buy sell gaps
---
can't downvote reality nerds
---
I actually agree we need to nerf bounties. There shouldnt be that much isk flow into the game. I would prefer an LP system like the ess but not steal able and concord LP and change the concord LP conversion numbers. Probably tied to ihub upgrades for full effect like the current spawning ones, that can change what race or maybe amount paid out.. It needs work dont get me wrong.
---
But we do need bounties in some form. I think they should be limited to HS tho as you know THATS where concord operates.. We can make an argument for lowsec but nullsec its honestly kinda dumb.. Like the "police" pays us to murder thousands and thousands of "pirates".. Idk again I can see the justification in HS as thats like an invasion but to pay us in null is like paying us to invade their space..  
---
Its always felt wierd to me. But im a WH guy...
---
they have the same risk as the people they wardec, player interaction

Did you know that you can bot without using a VPN?

Are you sure accounts that are online for 24 hours a day aren’t banned?

I maintain a character 24/7, it is not a bot. It is logging chat for our recruitment channel.

Thanks. How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back is probably my favourite Futurama Ep, followed closely by Million Dollar Mon and Lethal Inspection (turns out I just love Hermes eps).

The past year? I think you mean the past always.

I like all the racists hiding their shit behind 'OH GOD MY ISK IS GONNA BE WORTHLESS!!!111!!'
---
1) Your isk is already worthless, you can't, or shouldn't be selling it and if you are lol, fuck you
---
2) Considering you used to get 90 day GTC's for under a billion isk in EVE and you now pay 2 billion for 30 days....hahahahahahahahahaha.

They don't need proof honestly. Everything that is happening now is just a show to save some credibility.

I would, lol.  And probably would win.

you talk bullshit so you are either one of those pirat faggots with their small weewees or you are total off track. either way, regarding your comments i can only assume that you are one of those authistic borderline-wannabe-important guys in eve that have simply not seen anything of the game and/or completely lack in any understanding of how this game works.
---
They should put everyone guns on Safe for a month and let the PvPers feel the struggles of PvE.
---
the page title for the gila loss is "The fighter in the shooter lost the lizard in the AD167 - EVE national service hit list"
---
Yes, please.
---
They could easily have done that without telling us anything, as I think most companies would have. At that point, there was very little damage Brisc could have done, since he knew literally as much as we did about it, so  he could have done exactly the same thing he has been doing, deny guilt. Then, when properly investigated, they could have decided if they wanted to pursue any damages for the NDA
---
just vanilla recently, but started to find Admiral difficulty boring. might give some of them a try
---
You're being completely braindead if you think the current wardec mechanics require you to actually defend your structures.
---
imagine getting banned because you used microsoft paint unironically lmao
---
It's not.

&gt;you talk bullshit so you are either one of those pirat faggots

nope
---
&gt;completely lack in any understanding of how this game works.

yikes, imagine being this stupid
---
Good watergate Sam Ervin reference.
---
yep a lot of retards on this subreddit seem to believe that CCP doesn't ban for completely idiotic reasons.
---
the upcoming in may will. dies the headquarter, the war bound to this structure drops and you cant redecc for 2 more weeks. structure must be in highsec, structure will be shown to the other party of the war.
---
lol faggot
---
cringe
---
Drop dark matter again
---
If Brisc is not banned now, then that means the CSM member that got him banned should be punished. 
---
That CSM member must be banned must be kicked and banned from the game entirely.
---
That or Brisc stays banned.
---
/ANY other outcome means CCP allows cheating as long as you reveal your real name. I’ll make a hundred bots, reveal my rl face and name, and bot away, CCP wont be able to ban me even if I signed a ToS with them, because I’ll sue them. /s

Kinda weird relogging doesnt work. Because it should for sure.
---
The volume on the market history reflects the number of units that changed hands, right? So would that mean it’s not just that more were suddenly up for sale but that more were actually being sold?
---
Lol you really hate us, don't you? Did your corp get denied because you recruited off our blacklist or something?
---
 Burn the whole rotting temple? Insane ;D

Us liberty squad guys are fucking pumped for more of those USTZ fights, have had a lot of fun flying with you guys.

They did. We just keep burning this end of them lol.

Aged fine. Sometimes you assume people are smarter than they really are. Not much to see here folks.
---
Pretty much agree with everything you said. +1
---
ok, here's my question... How do i get "agent mission" window to show up after I undock. I accidently closed it and now for the life of me I can't figure out where to go for encounters.
---
ok answering my own question... there is a button that can show or hide it.
---
Using the override function (global-&gt;attribute overrides) is the easiest way to do this until it gets added to the TQ db. You'll need to compare the charge group between the t2 and faction modules and then change the faction gun so it can use T2 ammo.
---
I mean this is CCP we are talking about.
---
Also, you know, it’s still entirely possible Brisc did do what they accused him of and they backpedaled anyways. We may never know.
---
Have you ever taken a poop so big you felt gay?
---
Winner winner chicken dinner. Go check faction guns. Most of the dark blood types were completely wiped from all markets 48 hours per announcement.

Going nanos with rlml is the braindead version of solo pvp.

i thought i could win eve but i lost again
---
No problem habibi!
---
It’s letting you know you can’t use that one if you have Big Dick energy. Come back with some wee Caldari dick and it’ll be fine.
---
You can't save what isn't there at this point. Even if it turns out Brisc did it, the fact they didn't actually conduct an investigation prior to all this makes me concerned that these people at CCP have my personal information.
---
Thank you!!
---
yep wheres all the hurf blurf about there being no way that CCP could make a mistake on something this high profile, and he was obviously guilty.
---
Every goddam day
---
if its something that drops from all enemies, equal to the same ammount of isk bounty,   and can be reliably exhcanged in any station.
---
then sure.
---
Imagine being this desperate to defend the incompetence of a company as incompetent as CCP has been show to be public time, and time and time again.

As a small tip from a lazy person, I use multiple launch pad on 'a' planet. u could forget it for few days

what if every site had  minigame like the hacking minigame that was needed to start a site and spawn enemies?

If you recently sold plex, the plex value you sold stays on your net worth until you log out.

Everybody i know they've ever banned did dumb shit, idk where this narrative came from that CCP started randomly wrongly banning people but its literally not true at all.
---
Little retard...
---
0/ is a person waving.  07 is a salute.  I think that's unique to Eve.
---
There is a strategic advantage to having comms discipline during big fights.  Some military lingo has spilled over like "check check" or "break break".  I've even heard some systems spoken in military phonetics.
---
Cooperation is huge in this game.  There are many corporations (groups) that even have people dedicated to just teaching people about the game.  See Eve University.  Generally the more numbers you have the more powerful you are so it is in everyone's best interest to accept and teach new guys.  I've seen players strongly discourage the use of the word "nub" and insist instead of the term "newbro".
---
Blob (verb): To win a fight by bring more ships. Not to be confused with Brilliant Strategy where my side wins by bringing more ships.  Lol so in Eve there is no such thing as a 6v6 or whatever. Fleet sizes are mostly limited by the size of the people that can be organized together (a purely social limitation).
---
In Eve, we never trust anyone! Well, that's not really true.  We just don't trust anyone with something we can't afford to lose. Hopefully...
---
There was only this one extremely rare case where I thought I was playing the game with someone younger than 18 years of age.  Eve Online is not welcome to the younger generation.  However it seems to be a great niche to some as old as 70.
---
I did it, 44 injectors will sit you in a properly fit pvp super with all refits.
---
In before someone asks to translate.
---
I joined EUNI way back in the day and they had lectures and presentations about PvP that I attended. To tell the truth, I didn’t find them very useful, PvP in Eve is dynamic and complicated. 
---
If I were to set up a program, I would do it as small gang roams where the “teacher” is also the fc. However, the gang must be very small (5 people max). Everyone would have a role to play and the teaching and advise would be given in context during the roam. Also, it is very important for everyone to be active on comms and constantly talk and relay information. I’ve taught many people to PvP in Eve and my best success was with people who flew with me in small gangs and got thrown off the deep end over and over.

---
It should be noted that CCP *don't* run Serenity. The decisions over policing bots, RMT and suchlike (or, failing to do so) have been made by whichever Chinese company runs Serenity under license from CCP.
---
So they are coming to a different environment, where they don't have the overwhelming dominance they are used to, and they can't bot or RMT with anything like the ease they have been able to.
---
Welcome to the shark tank PIBC.
---
How much is that in money language? $$
---
naaa, i think imma just hump this spod with my rorqs and mine 20% longer than before
---
40 bil, or 8000 plex, give or take.
---
Correct.
---
Market history only tracks completed sell orders - note that sales are the ones taxed, not buys. The order is completed, so far as the server tracks, when and only when a product is transferred from a seller's inventory and into someone else's, and a sales tax of some amount is paid by the seller.
---
This is why you can see dozens of 0.01 isk buy orders for random collectible/rare shit, but have a sale volume of zero... Because no one's actually filling those orders.
---
What would really be most telling, although I don't have the game open right now, would be donchian channel for these boosters. I'd be interested to see whether it busted wide open when the announcement was made or not.
---
Lol, as someone maybe in SV your wrong on both accounts.

---
Trigger happy new staff.. getting a CSM scalp is a big deal. What is more intriguing is why they decided to push out an interim almost mea culpa.
---
What's the definition your friend gave you?
---
Well done!
---
Sounds like you're increasing the value of isk by making it harder to get for legitimate players while making it more lucrative to bot, decreasing the value of isk
---
Sounds to me like this would be an incentive to bot and would hurt legitimate players while helping botters
---
It doesn't matter what current bots are doing, if tomorrow drone boats didn't work bots would swap over to missiles or gunboats. Why would bots care what kind of ship they're using?
---
A little more complexity? Sure but still simple compared to other games' bots
---
Your last suggestion is the first step forward, especially for proxy bots which can send commands that aren't accessible otherwise. Change the ship targeting command call back and fourth daily and anyone who continues using the same script to Target ships every day without first remaking their script gets flagged 100% as a bot. Do that for every interaction and suddenly bottom with proxy inputs is no longer available
---
I picked proxy inputs bots because they're simple though, screen readers or other things are more complex. The answer is large rewrites and lots of money, I don't know that CCP has that in them
---
After that going after legitimate income sources from afk playing seems like a reasonable next step
---
Are you a belter?!?!??
---
It's mere existence is what screams volumes. Releasing a non-clarifying clarification is high irregular and intriguing.
---
When they blued Goons and created a turbo megablob like nobody has ever seen before, and then they have the audacity or retardation whatever it may be, to post about how it’s “everyone vs test”, trying to get Chinese players arrested posting things about “tiananmen square” in local and a long list of other idiotic things you guys do as a group
---
You guys are fucking cancer
---
If the bans were to hold, there would be no reason for them to say anything at all. Only reason to put something now is to signal to the outside world that a reversal is coming, and let people take the mature "oh they apologized, give them a pass on this." instead of being ridiculed to death.

Very nice

Take that away and people might have to spend their time doing pve to fund their pvp instead of turning on a vni and checking back on it every 20-30 mins while they pvp
---
They feed alot.
---
Attackers have been able to use extremely boring gamestyles that would get them kicked from the servers in any other pvp game. For example sitting for hours on jita undock and oneshotting stuff and avoiding actual fights via abusing deaggro timers / neutral logis etc. This way defenders can go destroy the war hq if attackers try to avoid engagements. Tweaking the mechanics to make annoying gamestyles harder is just better for the game.
---
There's a difference between Brisc denying guilt as he's doing now, and doing so while CCP remains silent. If Brisc is saying "I was banned from EVE because they're jealous of how big my dick was and they also want to kill goons because they and NC. are all in a big gay polycule" and CCP's response is "we can ban anyone for any reason at any time" then there's only one *explanation* for what happened, which is what people are gonna go with.
---
If CCP went ahead as they did, but didn't explain themselves, people would start asking questions. Brisc is free to provide whatever explanation he wants (either on record or filtered through rumors) for his ban, and then CCP is left looking like they're hastily covering up if they later contradict him.
---
I suppose they could pursue the NDA violations and NOT ban him, but that then means you have someone ejected from the CSM, which people are going to notice anyhow. 
---
Like, look at how things are now. They already GAVE us an explanation and people are already claiming full fledged illuminati goonspiracies. If they just banned a high profile player with complete opacity you think the shitstorm would be *better*?

None of the outcomes are good: 
---
So if brisc is not guilty we have multiple csms willing to use there position the CSM to get a fellow CSM member banned from the game this means the CSM holds insane power like taking alliances out of the fight at will levels of power. 
---
if brisc is guilty it shows that with enough public pressure you can break the rules, the not guilty scenario is likely worse, because it means it's not just a rogue entity it means CCPs system of preventing the CSM from gaining advantages is fundamentally broken to the point that a fair game environment is impossible to ever achieve.
---
lmao so does my wife, hates it

Good more players. More targets to shoot at

Are you the dude who wrote the gigx gay story in the Goon forums a while back and won a character? I think that had a guy named Steve in it too.

Sounds like you volunteered for that job.
---
&gt;Attackers have been able to use extremely boring gamestyles that would get them kicked from the servers in any other pvp game.
---
like what other game?
---
fantasy eve online (aka albion) has the exact same issue lmao
---
&gt;For example sitting for hours on jita undock and oneshotting stuff and avoiding actual fights via abusing deaggro timers / neutral logis etc.
---
they take 'actual fights' all the time, and lose ships all the time. this is a myth people who have no idea what they're talking about parrot
---
&gt;Tweaking the mechanics to make annoying gamestyles harder is just better for the game.
---
if you're not willing to commit the same amount of effort they do,  you do not deserve the ability to beat them
---
My guess is the one and only reason they care is they banned someone who was required by law to sue them.
---
There are lots of people in FRT hates PIBC, we will see a good show then.
---
Is the loot in c3 sites generally higher or lower value than sites in Nullsec?

Also, as my character is "Girl Named Steve" Lawyer named Steve is totally a great alt name.
---
Pretty sure it does count things like clones, but it appears to be lagged and randomly so. So you’ll get some stuff double counted and some not at all since the different values are cached (right word?) at different times. That’s my best guess from what I’ve seen. 
---
The NeocomII app does a full estimate too that’s much more accurate and shows each category separately.
---
At least log into jabber to get the havish spam and borrox updates about your mum
---
Do you know why FRT found? There are a lots of corp been defeated by PIBC and run aways to TQ. Now PIBC comes, it will probably have a fight then...
---
Can't say I feel too much sympathy.  That stuff got dark.
---
 Let's see:
---
1v1 combat at the sun.
---
Ransoming players you render helpless either for isk,assets,the ship they fly or by getting them to come on your coms and sing something.
---
Giving isk to new players we kill because they don't fully know the game and we feel bad for killing them.
---
Hating on CCP.
---

Hating on Star Citizen for stealing our vulture

 Any t1 cruiser could do tier 1 so you get a feel for the basic rats CCP had some fits for t1 cruisers on a dev blog called surviving the abyss I think. My best advices would be get your resists more or less even across the board,use an ab,have a stasis webifier, have a large capacitor battery or a cap injector  to maintain your cap and modules

Phyzix Rotsuda in Pandemic Horde (Geminate) enjoys frigate and destroyer 1v1s. pm him

No he admitted on another post he acted on information he had as a CSM, information other players didnt have, and used that to gain an in game advantage.

In null you get only the faction specific to a region, for example - Angel in Angel space and Blood Raider in Blood raider space. In WH it could be any faction. The benefit of it is that you can get can loot not specific for certain faction/region. if you are lucky you will have lots of Serpentis/Guristas sites with the most valuable loot like Drone salvage components and intact armor plates.

I run abyssals with a friend in Jita and we worry about suicide ganks.
---
If I leave a cloaked alt on the abyssal entrance and gankers show up, I can summon CONCORD by uncloaking and hitting the gankers once.
---
With CONCORD on grid, will ships get more than one volley off before they are locked up and jammed? For instance, if catalysts were trying to gank our hawks?
---
TLDR: if concord is on grid, will enemy ships be able to shoot more than once in a gank situation?
---
That could be done via preference option indeed. Will add it for next release which i will do soonish.

That was pretty fun, thanks!

At some point 2 fitted supers costed more. Not sure how different things are these days, but it feels surprisingly cheap for what used to be a matter of at least a year (IIRC? maybe I'm wrong here) of focused training.
---
When you finally find a good relic site after fucking hours of scanning... just to have it picked over. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. 
---
This shit drives me crazy, now I scan in an interceptor so I can gank these fools.
---
&gt;fantasy eve online (aka albion) has the exact same issue lmao
---
Then they should fix that also.
---
&gt;they take 'actual fights' all the time, and lose ships all the time.
---
Five corporations are responsible for 50 percent of the wardecs. Destroying 105 ships for every one that they lost. Only 4 percent of defenders were able to score a single kill. I wouldn't call that 'all the time'. After the change they might actually lose at least the structure a lot higher percentage of time.
---
&gt; if you're not willing to commit the same amount of effort they do, you do not deserve the ability to beat them
---
Committing effort to defend in a wardec in current mechanics is imo huge waste of time. If I have time to play Eve I definetely won't spend it in highsec fighting people who play docking / neutral logi / neutral bumber / neutral fleet bonus / neutral scout -games.
---
How exactly is 86 Battleships in a system, doing an incursion, proof of botting?
---
This subreddit really has a way of jumping the gun on everything. If there are any krabbers or nultiboxers, the immediate reaction is to take a screenshot and cry "BOTS" on Reddit.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Milu
---
They were always a major consideration. After all, null is the original space with the least mechanical limitations of what you can do. But it wasn't always very nice to live there. Even I still remember the period when many nulseccers ran L4 blitzing alts as their primary source of wealth.
---
not less than 10.000 bots
---
In catch its invariably some neut explorer cherry picking. There's several cherry picking asteros that are around so much that i suspect at least one must be a bot and a goon interceptor explorer who hardcore cherry picks. 
---
They are their own worst enemies tho. If they aren't turning up on intel no one knows they are there, until i start finding chains of cherry picked sites. And sure enough if i start burning up the chain of systems lookie there is a neut explorer every time. Then i grab a dictor and start hunting them.
---
Spoken like a true pirate.
---
Oh great now there's two full-fleet incursion running multiboxers? Wait I know these, one's a Russian who uses server stacks for this, and the other one must be Blobert.
---
They are all identical characters with same name &amp; portrait.

They will be blue.         
---
FRT is mortal enemy of this group that is coming in....

What was different before, if anything?

Fuck yeah !
---
We more than happily fought NC alone when they shot a fort of ours a few months ago. NC came back this time with Phorde right from the start. There wasn't much option for it to be "only us lot" this time around.
---
Happy cake day :)
---
Thanks!
---
I never thought green skins would invade New Eden
---
But here we are, how far has technology became
---
The average value per site is only determined by the system's security status. Wormholes are always -1.0 but there are places in nullsec that are -1.0 as well. But generally finding more sites would be just better than higher quality ones.
---
PLA is not from PIBC.
---
You forgot The explorer bots that have been operating for months with kill boards of nothing but asteros going back months
---
Well see got rejected from karmafleet cause they thought an isk donation for plexing my accounts from a very close friend was a grounds for awoxing them. Oh well. Rip me
---
It is EVE, blow up their ships if you hate someone
---
Cleared sites respawn immediately, cherry picked ones at least 30 minutes later. Cherry picking is sometimes the right option if you are not alone in local. Otherwise it is a bit lame.
---
Image removed?
---
No. But before we leave we will.
---
Your Icelandic is top notch.
---
Boo look at prices of Disintegrator Specializations
---
When I played I used my cargo scanner to fail the shitty cans on purpose. I think the sites despawn after an hour or two now once the first can is completed, I could be mistaken.
---
They haven't included the legendary wormholer btw
---
I thought there were actual killmails?
---
Run Frigate T1s solo in a worm and make way more than cruiser T1s
---
Probably not, but I promise you the chances of being probed out are slim to none, no worse than anyone running a random industrial through Jita.
---
Have you pulled up D-scan? Do you not see the dozens of filaments in system at any given point in time?
---
It was pretty good prior to the introduction of supers/titans..and for a while afterwards while they were still rare.
---
Dreads were hard countered by subcaps, and carriers were niche, mostly used as jumpfreighter equivalents but some specialized roles.
---
HAHAHA, epic !
---
They have. He's cloaked.
---
I feel people were a bit too hasty to join bashing of Brisc at the time, and I feel people are pretty hasty right now, acting as if CCP already admitted an error.
---
Many people think FRT=Anti-PIBC, it is completely wrong.
---
Those Chinese Corp. in GSF were founded by PIBC management level or PIBC friendly. But FRT also acquire lots of PIBC immigrant.
---
Most importantly, the Anti-PIBC wars in  Serenity  is just a way of playing EVE. Instead they had another kind of friendship after frighting with each other for years.
---
As for Botting and ISK farmers
---
Check the Economy Report and zKillboard, and you will find the ture farmers. They already in TQ after Serenity was closed.
---
how do you get through a camped wh with a kitey fleet?  I find it extremely difficult, usually - someone always gets caught which limits the kitey fleet use to home defense or very particular situations. The moment the enemy slipped through the hole it's basically it, no way of following unless getting proper fucked. 
---
HOw do you guys handle it? is it about acceptable losses?  like get one dude to decloak first and die so the rest can starburst? I like flying kitey a lot but it's super annoying when I have to wait outside a hole when i know the other fleet is clumped up on the other side.
---
that we haven't done but it makes sense now that you said it :)
---
Very much agreed.
---
Get a stealth bomber (ideally a nemesis with a target painter and tackle) and sit cloaked up next to a can in the next site.
---
and we would not have brought anyone else if you didn't batphone goons after the initial rf
---
idk??? I didn't mean to quote anything at all
---
Must have had that highlighted on the page somewhere or something
---
In our wormhole chain I  try to despawn the sites asap. If we have a null connection I'm more picky, since I don't want to risk my ship there and I'm ok with the locals earning less. Also when I find a relic site before downtime I leave one can unopened so the site will respawn there.
---
When I lived in Catch I started to use a Cloaky Tengu with rapid lights to do exploration. Every so often I would come across a neutral in a site. Sometimes get the kill sometimes not. But they always started complaining in local about me trying to kill them.
---
About time CCP released the names of Rubal's CSM accusers. 
---
If their evidence was false then we deserve to know who they are before being asked to re-elect them.
---
Clever
---
CODE is just a bunch of high sec thugs. They believe they are the masters of pvp, but they pretty regularly lose out to any kind of actually pvp, small gang or solo. They pretty much are just gankers for the most part. The “mining permits” are a load of crap, they’ll still blow you up even after you’ve paid it (I’ve never paid on one, but a buddy of mine did).
---
[Tackled by a crow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4hrebp/leaks_horde_cap_fc_gets_tackled_by_crow/)
---
He is not wrong in that PLEX user doesn't pay real money to a company. What would be wrong is claiming that PLEX user doesn't contribute to company's income in any way. There's a difference, although it's practically minimal as long as PLEX supply keeps up with demand.
---
Which is also a relevant part. While supply/demand thing works, I am really not sure if significant increase in demand will stimulate supply equally significantly. Maybe it's relatively safe to assume this, but I'd leave it to someone more familiar with EVE's real world economy.
---
It's so satisfying when you kill an explorer and see that cargo scanner in the KM.
---
Dude...
---
"...And then some guy pulled out a gun and shot the urinal!!! 
---
I was like WHAT THE F???!!!"
---
You are never, ever safe anywhere in Eve. That's rule number one (closely followed by "don't fly what you can't afford to lose").
---
CODE are just roleplayers who suicide gank people for funsies. They enjoy making people mad. They are generally good at what they do and good at manipulating those particular sets of mechanics but most of them are not so good outside of that. Don't pay them anything, don't respond to anything they say to you, and always make sure:
---
1. your ship has a tank (either with modules or speed)
---
2. you're paying attention to who's in local, who's on grid and who's on dscan
---
3. don't carry too much expensive shit at once.
---
1. Nowhere is safe from PVP. You consent to PVP by clicking the undock button. You might even get market PVP'd inside the station.
---
2. They kill expensive cargo ships and loot them. Many of them also have alts elsewhere that they use to generate money for themselves.
---
3. Very serious. As a matter of fact, they are required to at least ask you for money or a GM could say that it's just griefing. When they ask for money, it's extortion, which is all legal in EVE.
---
4. They just do it for fun to see how you react. If you explode in local after they've destroyed your ship, they've got their actual reward.
---
5. Pay attention to what's around you. Do not haul expensive stuff in T1 haulers.
---
6. Every ship has a role. Pick a role you want to fly in and check which ships fit into that. You need to be more specific about what kind of PVP you want for us to give more specific answers.
---
7. In my opinion, CODE. is an important part of EVE. I wouldn't join them, but they are a reminder that this is a cruel and hard game. I like it that way. If I wanted to be safe and just farm NPCs, I'd go to a different game. It's rewarding to be able to outsmart other players.
---
That doesn't sound very sustainable in the long run considering there are so many people willing to spend so much more time PvEing that that.
---
I feel that was going to come to an end pretty soon regardless of any changes made by CCP.
---
Tbh this is CCP doing what CCP does.  This is down to their own arrogance.
---
What I want to know is what was the advantage given and what was the leaked information.  I'm curious how this worked
---
The truth is - you can kill people in highsec. You just get a criminal status (anyone can shoot you without repercussions), you get a security status hit and the Concord police comes and destroys your ship (this cannot be avoided). This is called ganking - you use a cheap ship fitted for maximum DPS and the goal is to gank somebody and kill them before CONCORD shows up.
---
Ganking usually happens to either: 1) miners (especially covetors/hulks because of their paper thin tank); 2) freighters and jump freighters (depending on the stuff they carry); 3) other very blingy (expensive modules etc) stuff.
---
Ganking and Code - not sure, I don't necessarily would say they are some losers sitting in their parents basement. Its has a sort of a roleplaying aspect to it as well. Thugs, that extort money or punch you in the teeth. People sometimes have alts just for fun to do something like this.
---
You're in a big bloc, you fucking hypocrite noob
---
Well that was actually helpful, I thought I would of been belittled just cause I know some of the older game bases tend to be more toxic lol
---
I can be fine with this. I'll see how better I can get and if I'll stick it out. Even after losing a ship that I actually worked for I'm still interested
---
Thanks
---
1. Nowhere is entirely safe from PvP.
---
2. The ships are pretty cheap.
---
3. The "permit" is a fraud, they'll still attack you.
---
4. Yes, Code is actually pretty crap at PvP, which is why they only attack unsuspecting newbros.
---
5. Be on your guard to fight back or warp out. Move to our-of-the-way systems. Or move to nullsec, where Code is too afraid to fly.
---
6. Learn PvP in T1 frigates and cruisers - they're cheap so you can blow up a fair few while you learn. 
---
7. Ganking, fraud and blatantly one-sided battles are part of the entertaining chaos of Eve.
---
Why the fuck you want to ruin yet another server?
---
So about $415
---
Not as much as I thought. How many so would that give you?
---
Good to know thanks
---
I dont think I enjoy these gankers, kinda like I wouldn't enjoy being mugged and punched again haha
---
get professional help
---
In reality they will blue Goons, due to historical ties.
---
The specific advantage being a single journey between a hisec station and a POS in that same system :clutch pearls:
---
Fair enough, I hear learn to PvP and CODE is bad in a few ways good to know
---
We *weren't* surprised
---
Give that dude some gold plz
---
It helps to think that ships are just ammo. Do not pour all of your savings into one because you could lose it to a player in a dumb way or you could just lose power in your house or get disconnected and lose it in a dumb way to NPCs. Do not get attached to your ships.
---
You and me both.
---
I was having problems with neutral asteros chasing my helios out of sites so i started using a neuting stratios and suddenly no one wanted to fuck with me.
---
&gt;1. I thought high space was safe from that
---
Incorrect assumption
---
&gt;2. How do they get the money to afford losing ships like that?
---
Lots of idiots basically donate isk to us by being greedy haulers
---
&gt;3. How serious are they with their "permit". I heard/read that eve has legal fraud so I don't think I should pay them
---
The most common misconception in EVE is that CODE doesn't actually honor permits, which we do. We have a database with over 800 active permits in it.
---
&gt;4. Are they just terrible players that want to feel better about themselves cause there not really good at the game? Kinda like people using cheats in other games, it just seems pretty low to kill newbies.
---
You get the best tears from new players
---
&gt;5. What can I do for this not to happen again or at least the least amount possible?
---
Tank your ship, don't afk, follow the code.
---
&gt;6. What ship should I train for to PvP, they seem to change all over the place from YouTube videos
---
anything, doesn't really matter
---
&gt;7. What is the communities thoughts on these sort of things?
---
code is the only real in game villain pretty much at this point. goons are kind of villainous but more for out of game reasons.
---
code
---
&gt; Then they should fix that also.
---
not the point, you said it wouldn't exist in other games which is false.

&gt;Five corporations are responsible for 50 percent of the wardecs. Destroying 105 ships for every one that they lost. Only 4 percent of defenders were able to score a single kill. I wouldn't call that 'all the time'. After the change they might actually lose at least the structure a lot higher percentage of time.
---
Why would a group willingly declare war on a group that would actually fight them?
---
Why should a group go out of their way to fight fights that are risky?
---
&gt;Committing effort to defend in a wardec in current mechanics is imo huge waste of time. If I have time to play Eve I definetely won't spend it in highsec fighting people who play docking / neutral logi / neutral bumber / neutral fleet bonus / neutral scout -games.
---
neutral fighting is dead per ccp
---
I am aware, but thhis results in them ONLY being able o use t2 ammo, and not faction ammo, kinda ruiningg the whole comparing pprocess, or at least making it a pain in the ass
---
this is the true way.
---
Greyjoy's what?
---
In a home def/hole controle situation, you realy don't want to jump your fleet trough a WH.   
---
If the hole collapse with your fleet outside, you are fucked.
---
At least you get it.  
---
It'd be like if someone started posting anti-Trump memes and talking shit about corruption in the America, and I started yelling "RACIST!"  
---
That'd be pretty stupid.
---
Even then it doesn't really matter. As long as theres not something like an NDA or any other legally binding thing involved that is.
---
I heard GoT ends with an avatar cynoing in and bosoning the 7 kingdoms, then the dead try to use dragons to escape and they get bosoned again
---
and thats perfectly fine, alpha state is effectively just a trial version with no time limit, you will eventually run out of skills to train but it takes like 7 or 8 months.  
---
omega is where the game is really at though, so if you are enjoying it, i'd suggest getting a subscription.   
---
yes you "can" earn enough isk in game to plex your account, but honestly I wouldn't recommend it. it can take years to be established enough, and experiened enough to earn that kind of isk without turning the game into a second job. and especially when you are starting out, that 2b isk per month that you are saving by subscribing instead of plexing goes a LONG way.   
---
The rule of thumb that I always suggest when it comes to paying with IG currency, is that you know you are ready to start doing it, the moment you stop wondering if you can afford to do it.
---
They are gate campers who focus on ganking newbros hauling expenaive stuff (jump freighters of value greater than say 10B).
---
They kill the ship with high DPS , low cost ships, loot it, repeat. Of course after every gank CONCORD kills them all, but the value lost vs the value looted is negligable. They kill a freighter in a few seconds, then it takes the police a while to clear them. But they would for example lose 15 ships, 100M each and would theoretically loot a lot more.
---
So this is what they do - low tier content.
---
That's actually a great idea! You get all the good cans but don't have to spend time hacking the ones you know only have 1 carbon in them
---
Best Eve Online 3rd party software by far.

Do frigate sites have more loot than the cruiser ones?

not as good as the first one imho

Just in case you're serious: CCP can ban people when, how and whyever they want. Your friend can use the money for different things because a lawyer would just laugh at him (or take the money and lead him into a case he can't win. Noone that was banned has any legal right to get unbanned). The problem here is not CCP banning Brisc, it's them making a public statement about him breaking a legally binding contract, an NDA. Hell, even IF it turns out they were wrong they could still keep Brisc banned and he'd have no way of doing anything about it. They would only have to face the consequences regarding their statement about him breaking the NDA.

Ships that don't disrupt you from 30km away for 100 Alex.

Yes as they are made for 3 players. So provide equivalent loot.

You realize that those two ships are the garmur’s hard counter, right?

more likely it just cloaked. 
---
we re now following the new scriptures of bob.
---
bob is not merciful, he's more like a combination of the norse loki (not the avengers one) and the hyborian crom.
---
He likes good fights, but he also appreciates a good gank. He will roll you out on perfectly safe holes and will keep your hisec in aridia for days on end.
---
His true domain is the c5 highway but his presence radiates into the c6 crablands and is also imparted into the lower classes.
---
Every citadel you plant in a wh is His house too, but forget to fuel the fire on His altar and He will make sure an interested party will roll into you 24 hours before your timer.
---
His legacy is paranoia, panic and destruction and his most important commandment is an upgrade to the old "dont fly what you cant afford to lose" - it is "all you bring in the house of Bob is a sacrifice to Him that you haven't performed yet".
---
I know a lot of people run them in Jita, but he streams occasionally and it's easy to narrow down which one we might be in.

There is a saying in EVE: "The best ship is friendship" - Try to find a good corperation that hepls you get to know the game. I'd say EVE university is a good starting point(never was part of them, but I heard they're a help for new players)

one thing i would like to add about code, for as annoying as they are they are some of the best RP players i have ever seen in an MMO, they have full doctrines worshipping the word of their founder. that to me is insanity i have played many MMO's for a lot of years and the closest i have ever seen to the amount of in-game character dedication was vampire the masquerade as some others have said CODE is important to the game on the basis of helping people remember the game is cold and harsh but they are also important to remind us that sometimes people can let themselves be immersed.   
---
granted i have the same feelings about the leader of goonswarm "the mittani" that dude also has a religious following which is amazing to me and gives me hope that some people still let themsleves get into their characters in game.
---
&gt; Why should a group go out of their way to fight fights that are risky?
---
If they are not willing to take any risk then they shouldn't do pvp.
---
&gt;neutral fighting is dead per ccp
---
Good change!
---
I'm reading it and still online :P
---
So, how expensive was that KM?
---
You can't honestly somehow be construing CCP supporting the LGBTQ community to be anti-Muslim, can you? Or like, political? Do you really think making it clear to their playerbase that they accept their homosexual players is a bad thing? Do you really think being okay with the existence of gay people is *political?*
---
Lmfao. Alt-right teenage boys are so lost in their own reality.. Creepy.
---
&gt; If they are not willing to take any risk then they shouldn't do pvp.
---
They do risk ships every day
---
it's laughably easy to kill some pirat with equal number of guys
---
&gt;Good change!
---
it's kinda shitty that you don't know anything you're talking about and are talking
---
Yea but if you kill them, feed them their own shit an cherry pick/kill only the good ones.
---
&gt; Most Chinese players are not botters
---
Most Chinese players you talked to, probably. Which means some part of those interested in talking to you and building a community with you at all. Which I'm afraid is not the same as "most of Chinese players", not by a long shot.
---
This isn't racism. I wish I lived in the world where i could afford to give anyone and everyone benefit of the doubt despite any tendency that exists wherever that person comes from. I mean, usually we can do this, but on a case-by-case basis, huge events like this are, however, impossible to handle with such a personal approach.
---
It makes more sense when you remember that half the reason the CSM was created in the first place was due to breaches of trust by a dev who was giving shit to his non-dev corp, followed by CCP mishandling the situation about as badly as they could have.  AKA the T20 Incident. That probably still informs the way CCP views the CSM and how they handle it when someone abuses their position.
---
ignor the permits its a scam
---
Well, to be fair, when people call to proverbial arms under the banners of stopping more potential botters, that's hardly a stab against government.
---
Requiem Eternal - doing stupid shit and always get tackled since 2013.
---
1. Hi-sec is not safe. No space in EVE is safe and you should never expect it to be safe. It’s safe-ish.
---
2. You engage in all the activities EVE affords to make money. Plenty of ISK to go around. Some people, stupidly enough, actually pay CODE
---
3. You will never -ever- pay CODE. Nobody tells you what to do in EVE. That’s why you have ships with guns.
---
4. They are using the in-game client to do the play style they prefer. They’re assholes, but they’re EVE assholes. Sadly, that makes it ok.
---
5. Don’t change a thing. Get a ship with better fitting. Don’t worry about your boat being blown up. It happens all the time.
---
6. Depends on what you want to do. There’s a role for every ship in EVE. Find EVE Uni for more information.
---
7. Violence, shenanigans, sundry bullshit and downright idiots are very much part and parcel of the environment. It’s hard-coded [ahaha] into the environment. Don’t fret about it, don’t give them your tears, don’t nag about it [this is not nagging, you’re new, you have questions, perfectly fine], don’t complain to the DMs, it’s just EVE. This is why EVE is the place it is.
---
Fly what you can afford to lose. Don’t let anyone tell you what to do. Take their names. When you have better ships with better guns, and a bunch of buddies you found along the way, chances are you’ll meet them again. You don’t have to show them more courtesy then they showed you. It’s EVE Online. You get to shoot back.
---
Welcome to EVE.

This might honestly be the best shitpost ever to grace this shitpile of a subreddit. 5/7

And we thank you for it :)

They Re rare as fuck. When I do a day of t5 fillaments I am happy to get 2.
---
I won't claim to have perfect, or even very good mental health, but what about anything I said above triggered that response? I get that you can disagree with me about whether or not you like Brisc, but mostly what I was saying above was just me admitting that a decent portion of why I posted my original comment was emotional. Or is it insane now to try to self-reflect and admit one's biases?
---
The killmail is eve online
---
&gt;They do risk ships every day
---
 Only 4 percent of defenders were able to score a single kill. Statistics in low/null/wh seem a lot better.

You too.

He said fight, not win the fight.

This was really funny and I enjoyed it. Sorry its not upvoted as much as it deserves.
---
Netherlands is doing fine with soft drugs. It has less weed puffers per capita then say the UK, where you get a big fine or even jail time.

I was more as referring to really hard and unhealthy ones, since what he suggested is really bad for the game as well.
---
3. They do not have to ask for money.  Non-Code. gankers do not ask for money.  They cannot gank in starter systems, everywhere else is fair game, at any time.
---
I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this post.
---
I gained a lot of perspective and enjoyed interacting with you!
---
I've mined the following knowledge out of your spod filled cranium cases:
---
*No one is going to give you free isk. You are all wise, experienced visitors of Jita it appears. Scrooges. 😜
---
*Mining is best done with large numbers, using a min-max approach to rock licking.
---
*Exploring is a viable money maker, can be done solo and requires some investment, but pays well.
---
*You can't out earn bad spending habits - this one stuck with me
---
*Shiney ships see silly showup shootoffs.
---
I took what you had to say and digested it. I ended up plexing my main, and consolidating all my assets into one place. I will use that isk as capital to begin ratting and exploring.
---
Once I've established my entry level ships, I will curb my spending to replace the isk spent and get to plex level.. Then I'm grinding out isk to put away for a replacement or two. Finally, having established a safety net, I can begin exploring upgraded ships.
---
Now that I only have one character to concentrate on I find I am enjoying the game more. Exploration is actually fun for me, because I'm not keeping half of my concentration on the other screens watching my miners.
---
I earned more exploring the last two days than I have in the last 2 weeks.
---
Thanks for all the advice. I'm glad I got to listen to your collective wisdom!
---
That doesnt make any sense.
---
If the CSM member reported that something potentially suspicious was going on then it is CCPs duty to check if there is any merrit to those allegations.
---
The CSM member probably just did what everyone should do and reported something suspicious. If they now punish him for that then no other CSM member will ever tell CCP about potential wrongdoings of other CSM members ever again because they would have to fear to get punished for it later on.
---
there is a saying where i come from: "the dog dies from the long journey, and the stupid man dies from worrying about others". i hope i adapted the translation somewhat to be read : GFY
---
Glad you enjoyed it \^.\^ And that's alright. Things happen.
---
My corp thought the same thing.
---
&gt; Only 4 percent of defenders were able to score a single kill. Statistics in low/null/wh seem a lot better.
---
yes, they intentionally take fights they'll likely win
---
welcome to eve online
---
&gt;You too
---
i'm not the guy unaware of neutral assistance changes lmao
---
the sleepers relic/data sites are usualy done by pve ship to kill the sleeper and get the blue loot, sadly, the stuff you get from the cans is prety wortless (talocan is the only exception).
---
Sometime you have to try and fail the hack to triger the next wave of npc.  
---
C3 forgotent relic  are juste awsome.  
---
Doing Pve in a scannable site rather than a regular green anomalies is a little bit safer.  
---
I usualy do Relic/data in my home hole just to have a clean probe scanner
---
I don't get it, but I like it.
---
That is correct. They do not *have to* ask for money, but a GM could interpret that as griefing if they don't. [Here's a little bit of history](https://web.archive.org/web/20130707174049/http://www.minerbumping.com/2013/06/the-secret-origins-of-new-order.html) regarding the subject. I only linked the wayback link, because the GMs asked him to remove the pictures a little bit after they were posted.
---
Its about 40B to inject a super pilot. Then theres about 3-4 months of skills you can train the old fashioned way while flying it to save money.
---
Wear proudly the "In Rust We Trust" o7
---
Never ever pay for their permit. Just dont. They are known assholes. They will take your isk and shoot you anyway. They always come up with some made up bullshit reason to do so, but its just extortation.
---
You might be underestimating the Chinese
---
dodixie was a great place to trade 6 years ago, products moved a lot faster. Jita is the best place to shift product, amarr is really over stocked and moves awfully slow. While hek and rens shift huge amounts of T2 and T3 frigates/destroyers at premiums, exporting assault frigates to hek/rens is a hot market with usually 25% profits depending on the week/day.
---
Am i the only one that has 0 idea who the faces are?
---
I'll have you know, I only welped 90% of my last few fleets!
---
" I bet these people litter IRL " Yes they do. Also they ARE litter.
---
even STK thinks brisc is a scrub tbh
---
In the past 6 years since that article was posted, how many accounts have ever been disciplined for bumping without a ransom?
---
Theyll need to start over, but its not hard to RMT enough injectors to start botting again
---
Jump gate, hold cloak
---
I have no way of knowing that as I'm not a GM. Do you have stats on that? Do note that this is a different kind of bumping than the current freighter bumping to prevent them from warping.
---
YOU are the one not underatandibg you autist fuck.

shut up retards

Praise James!

Nah its goons or nothing at all.
---
Yeah no. You guys too paranoid.
---
Yeah why not?
---
Irdk?
---
You can solo certain data sites in a stratios by killing all but one cruiser of the first wave and hacking the cans while tanking it. Generally it's only worth going for the talocan loot, which is quite spikey in value, a bit hard to sell, and quite large so you need to make frequent trips out to sell it. The regular hacking loot is not at all worth it.
---
Oh god hahaha will do?
---
Yeah no.
---
No u
---
Did that. Thought my crab legs werent crabby enough
---
I love how this also confirm Mittani narrative about not reporting people because you think they bot I'm soooooo going to have fun next time I see someone posting the edited video "duuuuuh look Mittani protect bot"
---
Yeah but i only got 9bil tho :(
---
Is this really a thing? 😂
---
Finally something that made sense
---
Ez
---
Cause goons.
---
Noted
---
Yeah no. I tried applying got rejected immediately cause for some reason, some starting isk for plexing accounts from a very close personal friend which isnt even concerned by null sec politics or drama, is a very big red flag to you guys. Thus having my application rejected immediately. Oh well. Moving on.
---
Cause goons
---
Already did. He told me my love for red buttoned up shirts wasnt hard enough
---
Hahahaha yeah i paid 2bil too to sundering corp. For the same reason. Oh well. Ill just wait (Kappa)
---
P.O.S ? :)
---
This is the part of EvE i actually hate. 
---
As if we did not have enough corrupt, lying and evil politicians IRL. 
---
Now i have to deal with them in a fucking game i use to escape all this shit around me.

I am starting to think that WoW might be the better game for me. :(

Thats why im trying to get into goons, to git gud

10s are usually already enough. To hunt bots these days, the biggest issue are systems that are too big to be in the site in time. 50 AU to the site even with a hyperspatial ceptor and you can be sure almost every VNI is gone before you land. Hit the wrong site? Have fun waiting for another 5-10min before you can try again.
---
Well, on our old server, GMs had to do the AFK check manually.
---
Just partly true. You want your staging system to connect to as many other systems as each of those will by used for more jump gates. Goal is to basically spider web the connections across the region. A dead end system is just bad for that...
---
i have seen one post from brisc and nothing but radio silence from the other two (which was even smarter)
---
There was some public questioning of CCPs approach to the issue, which they created themselves. There were some init tags among those but mostly random dudes.     
---
The vast majority shat on brisc, not CCP.
---
I can see i'm clearly in the minority of oppinion here, sorry in advance for the wall of text, tho i doubt meny will read it due to the negative karma :)
---
It does depend on if its within the rules of the game. I mean in your example of a race, if your friend trips someone, you'd likely be disqualified by association (or the race would be made null and void). Changing that example to Eve, if you use a bot program to generate isk, you should be banned and have any isk traded off the character who made it (and anyone that they sent it too) made negative.
---
Eve is special due to it allowing loose interpretation of the normal rules of society, for example robbing, suicide ganking, awoxing and scamming. IRL these activities are deeply frowded upon in polite society, but in Eve they are accepted as normal. If a player chooses to ruthlessly play Eve, betraying, stealing their way, theres nothing wrong with that. Other players may not like it, they would obviously have to deal with the concequences of their actions. 
---
The line is drawn at cheating, if a player crosses that line, they should be dealt with by the game publisher.
---
This is just a personal opinion. I dislike mass branding of people, i've played PUBG, i've been guilty of screaming "REGION LOCK PLZ!" myself, in retrospect i think "Why should an entire region be punished over the actions of guilty players" tho i do admit, it seems like a 80%/20% to cheaters/normal players . I believe the burden of enforcing rules belongs to the publisher, if punishments were swift and final, botting could be dealt with.
---
I'v seen a site in system that got picked over last hours. I'v never personally tested this tho, but yeah last time it happened in my home system the site lasted hours and I think it only vanished after some one actually went in and cleaned it up.
---
I got Nokia 6.1, Android 9. Battery lasts from 1 day to a week, depending on actual usage. Right now I'm at 20%, last full charge 3 days ago. Can't complain :-D
---
I wanna be frank: I hate these posts.
---
Not that I don't get where they come from and I can't really argue against that. 
---
But having really discovered and jumped into Eve since the beginning of the year, and loving the game so far, yeah, I hate seeing posts like these.
---
Doesn't mean there aren't some needed changes, doesn't mean any of this is false, but it's truly depressing to see the game depicted that way when you plan on staying longer in the game.
---
I hope never to become a bittervet. :&lt;
---
That controversy was created by CCP for themselves with that initial blog post.
---
OK normally I fkn hate these, like really hate em, but this one was actually funny and made me smile so GG!
---
It's kinda shitty that you are a merciless liar.
---
The permit isn't a fraud, it's just that you need more than the permit to avoid being attacked: you also have to follow the [New Halaima Code of Conduct](http://www.minerbumping.com/p/the-code.html). You can't just buy a permit then continue to AFK mine...
---
Hey but don't worry. CCP says as a new bro you loved being ganked and will no way shape or form quit eve because of it.
---
I'm glad people are enjoying it. I originally made it just to give a few laughs to our corpmates and saw it in my folder while browsing reddit and decided to post it.
---
I do know. I was talking about the old system. 
---
And it should be harder to take fights you know you are going to win if stats are that bad. 4% is horrible gameplay. Stats are better outside of highsec because it’s harder to avoid risks there.
---
Just some highsec plebs.
---
Its totally a fraud.
---
Or better yet learn where the Permit Patty Patrol likes to hang out and choose to live where they don't and afk mine to your hearts content
---
nope.
---
If you want to go with C#, go with .net core and you'll get cross-platform support. if you want to go with a web app, that's even better, but you'll loose features like fast price copy, margin tool, market analysis, etc.
---
But, **before you start**, make sure you are able to pull data from citadels, especially given how ESI handles errors. If you can't get that to work, don't bother IMHO.

I think you misinterpret it: only "Change Charge (All)" menu item has been removed, "Change Charge" is still there. Difference is that former sets charges to all modules of the same type while latter is just for selected modules.
---
When even Trump has a thicker skin...
---
I am wondering if I should come back to the game. I have my character (alpha clone) in a Vexor Navy Issue with some Caldari Navy Wasps and a few basic modules. Any recommendations for activities I could get into with an alpha clone to see if I feel like buying omega?
---
I also have a couple hundred million ISK and was feeling like trying out a WH corp or a small null sec corp, but I don't think I could do much to participate in those with an alpha clone.

What a horrible title to try to get your point across.

However you can find superior covert research facilities in any wormhole class. (Look for ghost sites on google)
---
i feel its a valid tatic if you dont live in the space ie null or low why would you want to open the shit cans ?  im not a pve guy i only do low sec pvp in FW my self but i can understand the other
---
They actually reinburce you, just need a permit, be friendly and mail the right person
---
Can confirm, although their cancerAIDSlupus forum script is a powerful deterrent
---
*sigh* I guess it's time for the monthly LOOK AT US post by CODE.
---
i would post something usefull but seems others have allready took care of that so all i will say is code is a groupe of dicks that pvp so they go around picking on others that can in a place they cant fight back want to fuck code fit out a bait tanked prock and mine in a code system and murder them when they come in odds are they will leave you be tho because a proc and defend its self long enouff to get at least 2 kills on them "drones on one point on the other soon as they red box"
---
Yes they are terrible players, and you lost to them, guess what it makes you?
---
there was a youtube movie 3 part series about 3 hours worth damned if i can remember the name now but i found it a good watch dont know how much it will explain the culture your looking for but still

Doesn't China already block EVE from their end?
---
It's why I did a fresh restart, away from alliances, politics, blue standings and massive fleets. Did it a few days ago: new character and gave it a bit of SP, not aligned with anyone or anything. Just doing small scale stuff and trying to find the fun again.
---
People really do talk out of their backside on this subreddit lol
---
Wouldn't these guys end up with low enough security status that they can't enter high sec pretty quick?  Are they just so dedicated to be jerks that they are willing to spend hours rating to get thier status up so they can gank ventures?
---
yeehaw🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
---
Some VPN's (OpenVPN?) security protocols can overcome  Chinese firewall's packet inspection algorithms, I think
---
It's a matter of how persistent VPN user is to learn those things
---
&gt;Everything that is happening now is just a show to save some credibility.
---
Their last statement was nothing more than an attempt to soften the blow for what ever comes next meaning they think there's enough of a chance they will be wrong that they need to start trying to repair the damage before its even done. I'm going to be buying popcorn in bulk for their next blog post on the topic.

Always always cherry pick. It is a zero sum game and the correct action is to cherry pick. 1 the fastest you move the less likely you are to make a mistake and die. 2 you are in the next system faster. 3 you make it shit for your competition.
---
sue for discrimination, clearly.

How do you fail a can with a cargo scanner?

Criticism of government policy of other countries including China isn't racist or derogatory, I don't think the comment you were replying to was referring to that

Shut up we dont do logic in this subreddit.

Another beautiful addition to the collection.

Can you give source please?

Excellent concept for a show, imo. I think I’ve seen them all and the acting sucks every time.... but I still watch bc the plot is amusing.
---
Certainly wouldn't be surprised if suicide ganking went the way that wardecs did. It's an overlooked and tolerated mechanic, but the reality is that it killed whole career paths in high sec (mining and hauling).
---
&gt; they are the risk of owning a structure in highsec  
---
&gt; they don't have to have arbitrary risks imposed on them for BEING the risk itself
---
Why should they be exempt from the risks in highsec because they are the risk? They now have to risk something to be the risk according to your logic.
---
1. highsec doesnt mean people cant shoot you. it means that if they shoot you they will die 9-15 seconds from when the first shot is fired.
---
2. the value of your ship was probably worth more than 6 of theirs. 
---
3. you should absolutely buy one to stay safe
---
4. HS ganking is eve endgame content. only the best can do it successfully. CODE. does it the best.
---
5. tank your ship so that it will take more people to blow you up. the more they have to spend to kill you, the more your ship has to be worth to make it worthwhile for them to kill you. also buy a permit. buy 10
---
6. start with good fitting skills (cpu/pg 5, etc) then train good skills for smaller cheap ships. as you get better at pvp you will know how to take an expensive battleship out without getting owned.
---
7. its hilarious.
---
You are gay pwned

Some people like to cover themselves in filth and shame for a bit of attention. But, you should already know that, no?

i have never once ganked a permitted miner who followed the NHCoC. its not fraud
---
I've released new update with a few fixes and ability to change the behavior. I left current behavior as default - because it should be more intuitive for new users (and pyfa is already confusing as fuck for them), but people who understand what they want can change it via options.
---
I mean people do inject into Titans and supers in a single day.
---
But that doesn't take into account the year of saving isk to afford it...
---
Maybe you should wait for the CCP update next week before making assumptions &amp; jumping to conclusions.

&gt;How do they get the money to afford losing ships like that? Like 6 of them just exploded when they destroyed me.
---
They gank freighters and HiSec mission runners. The loot they collect is sold to fund ganks and other things. Also the ships they use to gank cost about 1.2m isk. 
---
&gt;What is the communities thoughts on these sort of things?
---
I can only speak for myself. I don't have an issue with it. Eve is a sandbox and this is their play style.

If you are looking for a corp to join, check out https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/. Corps post of their sometimes to let you know they are recruiting and what they look for.

Good luck in New Eden. It's a tough place but is full of good people.
---
Yes and no. This would remove the top end anomaly ratting almost completely which is tbh quite ok, and ofc top end anomaly bots with it. Low level expendable bots will still be profitable. Right now even if you know the timer of a boting system it takes just to much effort to kill one worthless vni every 10 minutes while the botter is just making the money back in his 3 other systems. But generally the bots will just move further into other activities like abyssal stuff, missions, fw.
---
at the rate plex is going its going to be a lot cheaper than you think better than wasting a year worth of sub plexes
---
That’s not how that works
---
here's the math behind ganking
---
your ship has a certain amount of hitpoints. catalysts deal a certain amount of damage before concord arrives.
---
divide your tank by catalyst damage to see how many are needed to kill your ship. that sets the price to kill your ship. 
---
about half of your loot will usually drops when you die, so if your loot succeeds about 2.1\* the price in catalysts, you are a valid target. 
---
for capital haulers youre looking at about 1.8b max value, for t1 haulers youre looking at like 30m

Thank you friend I’ve been looking forward to this release!

I want to start making some spreadsheets, but have no experience with API, ESI or anything like that, nor have I got any programming experience. So I watched some videos and now know that I can pull market data using API in Excel. But I think it is possible to use different sites for that, like Eve Central, Evemarketer, Appraisal and Fuzzwork. What is the difference between those sites? Any pros and cons? I've read that Eve Central only updates once an hour, for example.
---
And also, if I want to pull some data from Eve, like the number of item X i have in my hangar, is it correct that I have to use ESI for that? If yes, can someone direct me to a video and or document that explains how to set this up in Excel? 
---
Living in 0.0 meant you needed to have at least 1 carrier alt so you could bring in your own shit to fly in null. I remember training my second character to fly a chimera for this exact purpose.

You'll notice the last line of my post is that CCP has to balance their game.  IMO insurance is not the best system, for exactly the reason you described.  So, in the current model, I totally agree with your point, but my point is that inflation will keep going up if we don't change things like insurance, with or without bots.  Bots will make it worse, which then just means both anti-bot moderation and anti-inflation balance will be needed
---
&gt;Cheat, steal, lie... The Chinese way. 
---
That sounds like The EVE Way.
---
I don't doubt it. I remember when like? Last time I had a similar discussion was 4 years ago before citadels. And the best nullsec Stadion was at best at place 7.
---
I assume the reason this changed is a mix of way more supers/caps/rorquals. Maybe it's also just more minerals. I'm not really into eve economics :)
---
We waiting a long time for the response fleet, but all that came through the cyno was some harpies and a special ed ratting Thanny.
---
pfff best ship in the game is the orthrus
---
It’s actually less value than certain areas of nullsec, but more than others. Each pirate faction has a different loot table in their space, and the different faction’s loot varies quite a bit in value. So all else being equal, which in reality it won’t be, in some areas of nullsec you’ll generally find sites that are better than the average relic site, while in others you’ll find ones that are worse. All types have an equal chance to spawn in wormholes
---
They despawn in about an hour, maybe less.
---
I tried this about 10 times about a month ago and got nothing, pretty much. Has this changed or do i just gotta tough it out a bit longer?
---
Shh quiet you ;)
---
Turned 300mil into 40bil within a month of real active marketing in a major null sec hub.

Maybe because what you got told about Russia and Chechnya is one sided propaganda (just the other side) you compare the armed rebellion and the killing of 300 children in a school by islamistic weapons &amp; drug dealers with the peaceful protests on Tienanmen Square.

It must be interesting to be such a shitty person that you can justify your own existence with unrefined lies and believe them at the same time.

If you want to be safe, join a big nullsec bloc (newbie corp), go to nullsec and learn how to watch intel, watch local and get safe when a threat is near.  High sec has never been safe.   Of course if you're just an alpha or low skilled pilot, you may have problems actually doing anything when you get there.
---
2 of the ones on the right are totallt bots
---
&gt; but when a site isn't completed does it not stop new sites from spawning across the system

The sites despawn after an hour, once started.

You might not have and if so good on you for actually following the RP of the group. But I have seen Permit Patty Patrol gank people even if they have a "permit".

How does that prove that they are botting? If I was running more than a few then I would make them all the same too. That way it was easier to watch for gankers and stuff.
---

You want me to harvest slower so that the people who compete with me on the market can harvest faster?

That is far lower than I imagined.

---
I've noticed this too.  It's intensely annoying.  However I'm never sure whether the site is half finished because the player had to GTFO, for whatever reason, halfway through.  I have done that before (half done a site then reds entered local, or doorbell rang, etc. etc.).
---
join for guild, Judging by the fact that you made this thread your path is likely to pay $10 to enjoy access to something awful forums, perhaps additional fees to unlock archived posts and maybe when you feel comfortable applying and referencing that SA membership.
---
 \&amp;nbsp; 
---
But you'd still just be fake, and a j4g for all intensive purposes. As someone else referenced you can join Karmafleet and enjoy much of the same pleasures or most affiliates and maintain access to goonfleet. (arguably culturally rich forums that somewhat diverge from SA)
---
It's weird, why GoonWaffe? To pretend? That's not you, you didn't grow up on those forums. You don't know these people. So you want the tag because that means something. You don't share the culture and can't really back into it without it being awkward and forced or odd. In EVE (you are on the EVE online reddit), you can join affiliated alliance or coalition corporations and enjoy the vast majority of what gewns provide  including the better bits of SA through goonfleet.
---
Look for people with similar interests, people you will form bonds with and fly with. You don't get that by targeting a specific tag and working backwards. Plenty of people force it this way, but they're weirdos. Goons branded and franchised a culture to be accessible to all which offers some semblance of a 'family' to the droves of members that call Imperium their home. You simply join sigs, make friends and fly with whatever homies in whatever corp you've made. it's weird to want/desire GoonWaffe specifically given these truths. 
---
Alliances in the Imperium coalition often struggle with culture and sometimes seek to differentiate or distance themselves and claim regularly that they are not goons. Plenty of coalition members identify as goons and still others maintain some resemblance of independence to hold their (often inferior) cultures. It's not that their cultures are worse by normal measurements per se, it's that goon culture has been manufactured and caressed into a sort of  über Kultur that can be found palatable to a wide audience seeking acceptance. Any pubbie can get a first class ticket to the best and worst forums on the internet via goonfleet with an Imperium season pass.
---
So you can be a j4g, join SA as a measure to backdoor (frontdoor really) into goonwaffe and live with your shame of having joined simply for the guild (nobody will really care in the end) or you can join just about any affiliated corporation and enjoy the more refined goon culture and skip somethingawful. If you want to be a goon for some reason other than culture just stop and turn away. 
---
Maybe, like the average reddit user you reside in the United States (California specifically), your politics align leftwards and you feel reddit is the best forum. Than fortunately you have the option to join Dreddit, an eve-based corporation based upon the reddit forums. Dreddit sports twice as many members and finds it's home in Test Alliance Please Ignore. Karmafleet is a goon 'proper' corporation that also spawned for/by/with reddit (in mind). These places likely make more sense b/c reddit.
---
*Note* If you found yourself scammed you likely won't find yourself in goonswarm as you would have reason to go rogue or cause damage. Typically, you'd have to be some pubbie who cared way too much about a tag and so little about friends or what makes any of this work as to blindly walk into a scam demanding your isk or assets for citizenship. Like actually the worst type of recruit, unwelcome in the swarm. If you want to give all your stuff so that you can tell everyone you're a goon based off some perceived prestige you're not really an ideal candidate. Find a corporation that matches you as a player and app to them, see if they fit you instead of trying to force yourself into fitting them for the best results in eve.
---
\&amp;nbsp; 
---
Judging by your posts it looks like you want to join goonwaffe just to be a goon and it has to be goonswarm so that you can indulge in having a guildtag. This is a pretty standard definition of a j4g. You can ultimately achieve some pseudo stolen valor and stake claim to your great goon membership and brag to someone equally as dumb about said membership, but you'd really just be fake and gay, more so than the average eve player who merely embellishes their accomplishments instead of downright pretending to have anything to do with EVE or any organization within.
---
Today I learned something.  But how do you intentionally fail them?
---
&gt; It doesn't matter what current bots are doing, if tomorrow drone boats didn't work bots would swap over to missiles or gunboats. Why would bots care what kind of ship they're using?
---
Firstly, there's inertia - just changing anything means a bunch of bots don't work (see: local breaking). Then there's the fact that to rat in a drone boat you literally have to deploy drones and wait for the anom to get cleared; to bot with guns or missiles you have to manage target locking, module activation and reload, and unless they're lasers with T1 crystals, also ammo resupply. Finally you can't use gun or missile boats from 80km by orbiting the rock with a 100MN AB so the bots would actually need to know how to tank or pilot. It's a huge step forward from AFK VNIs.
---
&gt; Sounds like you're increasing the value of isk by making it harder to get for legitimate players while making it more lucrative to bot, decreasing the value of isk
---
I don't know where you got the second part from. I guess my question to you is really - why don't you support increasing the value of ISK and making it harder to bot/AFK?
---
There are empty boxes and there is a cargo scanner... LOL You are probably asshole IRL too
---
This is why people are bitter. Imagine sinking 5-10 years into the game and now someone can spend ~$400 and literally pay2win their way into a super in one day. Honestly this game is way past repair
---
If they didn't fuck up and had got it right they would've never even released this, they already got it right the first time.
---
It sounds like you're trying too hard to enjoy yourself.  It's a common mistake.
---
No legal team in the world is going to tell you to speak publicly.
---
Moving on is fine as long as you don’t screw people over. Players change more Corps per month than the amount of times they’ve showered.

Does this count for supers and titans too?

Breaking news: CCP bans NazAlGhul for industrial espionage. "We're not sure how he did it, but NazAlGhul's writing makes it clear that he has infiltrated CCP at the highest levels," commented security team member CCP Oopsock. According to sources familiar with the matter, CCP has asked Icelandic security forces to sweep their headquarters for hidden electronic surveillance devices, or "bugs." NazAlGhul denies any wrongdoing.

A good thing you can do if you still want to play in hi-sec, add the people who killed you and set your standing to them as Red or Orange. This way, anytime you see them in local, you can dock, switch systems or avoid them. Really, if you're careful and pay attention, you probably will never get ganked. Join a corp, they'll help you get back on your feet and will help with continuing to play, watching out for CODE (if you join a hi-sec corp) and make the game more fun by dicking around.
---
I do recommend joining a newbie corp in low or null (or even wormhole if you want). Hi-sec isn't really the most fun place to be in Eve, even as a newbie.
---
And the skill books.
---
I found many so far in C6, C2 and C3....
---
OP this is the type off people you are against, cherry pick them, cloaky camp and gank them then kill their pod and loot their wrecks, enjoy the cries of the sperg.
---
our Memes are now like CCPs wormholer policy and we are now to act like you dont exist
---
&gt; They believe they are the masters of pvp,
---
They don't take themselves seriously. Most of them know they're a meme alliance and play into it for fun. 
---
They even took it that far that they signed up for the AT, planned to show up in traditional "gank ships", like Catalyst and Talos. When their opponent banned exactly those ships they forfeited.
---
If they really saw themselves as elite PVPers they wouldn't have used the AT just to meme, but at least tried to play a serious match.
---
It's pretty easy to spin up a new alt and get ganking really fast. The gankers that attack miners just enjoy the roleplay aspect of it, the reaping the salt from miners.
---
Do you mean the user has to do it manually? 
---
I installed this once, loaded it, bunch of shit was wrong, (minokawa reported as most expensive fit?) so i uninstalled it. 
---
I mean, if you are a mass shipper or something it might be useful to help track stuff, but i just don't give enough fucks about seeing my "wealth" to deep dive and manually adjust a bunch of prices.

Zenith of a fallen empire adds a massive endgame to Stellaris for those who have already sunk countless hours into Vanilla. I'd also recommend Sins of a fallen empire, which is basically an expansion of the above addon (in beta stages atm). It brought back memories of the first time i had a endgame crisis.

Buy orders are there for those of us who feel its a waste of our time to play the market micromanagement game when we could be doing something we actually enjoy. You eat the loss of potential profit so that you can get on with your life.

It's windows' smartscreen, you can stop it by searching SmartScreen using search icon on left bottom side of the screen, there will be an option named "activate smartscreen for applications" or something, click it then disable and the issue will be solved.
---
Also put PvE / PvP ships across multiple systems. Some on gates, in belts, on stations. They need to dscan them for fights and find each other. Maybe lowsec would be best for it as they could use the sites to restrict third party.
---
Or use the test server

It's much better to burn 150 off the cans. You can warp to the ones they are actually hacking that way.
---
Google, YT and forums for a year (or two) and you will know almost everything. There is no other way.   
---
You can move your ship in any direction, but usually its better to keep distance, approach or orbit.  
---
This things can be confusing in the beginning, but that is because this is not a game. We are space pilots. wasd and your ship moves in 3d like in 2d is for kids.  
---
Fly Safe

Very fun ;)
---
Vily had a rough night.  If I could have given him a hug, I would have.
---
So, from an "explorer pvp" perspective, leaving the shitty cans wastes the time of those that don't fit scanners, thus allowing you more time to get further ahead of them.
---
TLDR, fit a scanner, or never be the lead dog.
---
You've said multiple times that it bores you to death and you hate it.  Why would you do something that bores you to death in a video game?  Have fun, don't do things you hate.

Rorqs are going to have to die quietly more often now.
---
Between not being able to tank much anymore, and the shorter PANIC, there isn't really enough time to actually ping and get anyone who isn't already in standing fleet logged in/jump cloned and in fleet before that shit dies.
---
Is the intent was for more rorqs to die, this patch worked great. If the intent was to get more fights, there is still work to do.
---
Dont be such a fag. The dudes are doing something for the Eve Community and generating publicly available content..

I think we can understand the 1,942 at least

I can read it just fine. It says 1989 tiananmen square infiltrated by winnie the pooh.

How can't he see the Titan? 😂

You can easily suicide gank even with -10 security status if you know what you are doing.
---
negative security status dosen't trigger concord, it triggers the faction police, who are pretty easy to escape from.
---
ran out of memory, use jmemory instead, ran out memory, gg.
---
Spinning up new alts to deal with security status problems is considered bannable by CCP, its not with anyone with a brain does.
---
Diablo3 \*cough\* please don't it was bullshit....
---
Test formed something like 100 battleships and did nothing with them. They only dropped harpies and titans.
---
Its perfectly believable, the joke is anyone following the NHCoC is ungankable because they are not afk.
---
Yes. One of them convinced me to start playing chess again.
---
4. gives this away for the bait it really is.
---
Does that matter?
---
&gt; 1942
---
Damn, they already started WW2 memes.
---
Not only is it the strictest DPS race in the entire game, CCP keeps increasing the difficulty of it. It's absolutely endgame.
---
Any bets on where in null they will try and take?
---
As opposed to nearly instantly if you clear the whole site even if you are just popping the low value cans. You shoot yourself twice, once by leaving evidence of your misdeeds and twice by preventing sites from spawning ahead of you as you move up the chain.
---
Dude, loot oxes shit EVERYWHERE
---
Only in the context of putting down other people's alliances but you are too scared to flair your own.

Kay.......   🤣🤣🤣
---
(and which also force it such that the only viable HS activity for low sec status characters is ganking)
---
I wonder who they will join, or if they’ll start up by themselves.
---
To be fair, most people who did this do not live in the area in which they are cherry picking.  I know back when I was in Darkness. If you got caught cherry picking you would get reported and usually have to pay fines.

So this means you are likely in Test space.  I personally cherry pick there all the time.  Test space is the best relic site space.  There for, many people go to Test space for relic site hunting.  This has made lazy testicles learn how to kill relic site hunters quite efficiently.  So I will not waste my time on grid hacking a can that I know is only worth 1.5m isk.
---
Also, as you stated, there are people more desperate for isk than me so I know they will hack the whole site.  This allows me to find more untouched sites and therefore make more isk per hour.
---
So as one of those cherry pickers, Thank You.
---
Good on you for doing your research before shelling out your money to them. There are a lot of really great organizations that will teach you about the game and won't scam you in the process. Feel free to mail me in game with any questions you might have. IGN: Blazingbunny
---
No it isn't, biomassing low sec status ones to make space for new ones is. Alpha accounts are allowed to be made in any numbers
---
Eve to push 30-40k peak again?
---
Assuming you're really new, you're probably mining in a Venture. That ship has +2 warp stabilizer in it so whenever CODE turns up your best move is to warp away. Dock if it's a station and tether (or dock) if it's a citadel.
---
With more advanced mining barges you can make them so tanky that they can only kill you if they sacrifice a lot of ships to CONCORD and they don't like doing that. Theoretically you're not safe but practically you are.
---
Wtb translations please.
---
Am i the only one who doesnt even get half of this?
---
Yup, And most of the rest of winter co. 
---
So, I guess good luck to Winter Co.  If PIBC gets them in their sights, They are going to need it.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong but do you have source for this?
---
100m an hour for solo T1 Frig sites? 
---
I'm guessing its been a while since you did them? I've been tracking time to complete, and evepraisal value (plus any BPC value) and the value of T1s has dropped considerably. The last time I saw \~100M an hour would be in Feb when the Avg site gave closer to 24M. Of course if you only run a few and get some good sites you might hit that, but on average I just dont see that currently.
---
My April averages are below over 18 T1 sites. There are minor variations in time to complete based on Filament type and Ship used but overall they are all very similar.
---
Would that make them friends with our russian community? :O
---
True, if the press release stated that he'd broken some in-game rule it likely wouldn't have been an issue. It's the fact that it's an accusation with real world implications for him which makes it potentially defamatory.
---
Fountain and Cloud Base? ... something something FC's banned? something somethings, cannot fight back anymore?
---
Astero ship mastery.
---
its Cantonese
---
I understood a part of them already joined the People's Liberation corp in goons, unless I heard wrong about that
---
some anoms can be tricky or undoable without a sensless pimp.
---
that's why Gila usualy chain FFS for best ISK/h
---
for solo C3, I think the rattlesnake stay unbeatable
---
that is correct
---
If they join TQ they will need to build. Winter CO is already established here so might not be that easy.
---
It does slow down re-spawn rate and it should not be done in friendly space or space you farm daily.
---
Not showing any evidence.
---
You’re wrong about that
---
All of the scanning skills. Alpha can’t train everything but they can become pretty capable scanners anyway.
---
Mate you don't think that's the first thing Amarr tried?
---
Funny how with ships made of rust duct tape and dreams we've been kicking amarrs arse for decades.
---
And god knows how many bots.
---
I LOVE CCP
---
It is only 2000 people at a peak announcement, so do the maths
---
I thought PanFam had to do that... But krabbing...
---
Or whenever you talk about banning someone, especially when that someone has a *law degree*, you don’t want to say anything contrary to what you’ve already said.
---
This is why I kill explorers
---
I am so excited by this nice screenshot in Chinese symbols I do not understand.
---
With 2k players they could evict sort in t1 cruisers, he better prepare more appeasement citadels.
---
made you press f1
---
Remember when high sec was actually supposed to be a safe haven? Now CCP has let CODE completely break the game. There is no consequence for them. They are doing it with alpha clones. Everything in EVE has risk and reward... except being in CODE. There should be no exceptions. Take em down CCP
---
Petition the loss. I’ve gotten my ship back from stuff like that.
---
a lot of mango
---
yup. def happy just to have a tourny to play in.  although.... biggest ship alive wins is a lame LAME L A M E, rule.
---
Train all the scanning skills as high as possible. 
---
If you are going to full time live in wormholes its hard on alpha, Cloaking is vita and iirc you can't cloak on alpha.
---
Apart from that you need all the support skill sfairly high and A Battlecruiser class to 4, preferably not Caldari as most wh groups run armour fleets.
---
Oh cool, I would like to read that one.
---
Firstly, this is a pvp game first and foremost.  You need to understand that.  Them killing you does not make them bad people irl, it makes them pvpers in a game about pvp.  Dont be that guy who cries because your shit got blown up.  Learn the mechanics and keep on space trucking.
---
Secondly, there is a delay on concord's response time for attacking would be gankers.  This gives an aggressor time to kill your ship before they arrive on scene to wipe the gank crew.  Few people actually tank mining ships, which make them easy prey for a Thrasher or two.  And many people fit those no-tank ships with ridiculous valuable faction mining mods, which makes them valuable targets.  What you probably didnt notice was the neutral scout alt who scooped your wreck after Concord had popped the gankers.
---
A gank thrasher is very cheap.  Even a few stripminer mods or t2 drones dropping in enough to pay for another.  If by chance you had shinier gear, they could have had a payday off you.
---
As far as the permit, some of the CODE people do in fact honor these, but there are others who dont, or who wont bother checking for one.  What you have to understand is that there are also plenty of gank corps who are unaffiliated with CODE and to whom these permits mean fuck all.
---
When it comes to defending yourself, the best thing you need to do is just pay attention to your surroundings.
---
1) Drag your local window out of your corp window to break it off into its own pane.  Being able to read local is less important than being able to see the character list for local.  
---
2) Search for the CODE. alliance in your people and places browser.  Be sure to include the period at the end.  Right click and set standings.  Set them to Orange.  Now every time anyone from that alliance enters local, you will notice it.  For the smaller, do this as well for any of the smaller non-affiliated corps who also gank.  Basically, flag anyone you see go flashy red and slowly build up a list.  PAY ATTENTION TO LOCAL.  This is your very first line of defense.  If CODE enters system and youre alt tabbed and get popped, well, you had it coming.
---
3) Fly a tankier mining ship.  A Procurer is more likely to be left alone than a Mack.   
---
 And a Covetor is a free killmail for anything that looks at it crossways.  After youve got a tankier ship, *you need to actually tank it*.  Dont just grab a Proc then load it up with yield mods a scanner and a AB then wonder why it still died.
---
4) Understand how concord works.  The sec status of the system determines how quickly a police response will arrive to defend you.  In a 1.0 sec status system, concord will arrive in about 6 seconds.  Concord respone time get slower as the system sec status drops to 0.5.  In a 0.5 system, there is a 19-20 second delay.  More than enough time to pop almost anything.  Not even freighters are safe.  
---
One last point.  If you are the salty snowflake sort of player who is going to sit in the reddit, or the mining channel, or local and smack talk gankers or brag about your expensive mods, then you can be sure you will be singled out for special and loving attention from precisely the sort of people you want to have not notice you.  And there are ways to manipulate concord response times in higher sec systems.  CODE can and will get you if they really really want to.  So be polite.
---
2000 people with 3 accounts could be big boy numbers

3 bots you mean. They will surely give a slight boost or at least slightly flat activity line across all TZ. More likely we will see snall increase of 1-2k during the 19ET peak, that is shit these days anyway, but I doubt it can surpass 40k.
---
ok thanks yea eventually i will become Omega i just want to get the basics down on exploring and writing down on what i needs to i can make a plan
---
Many wormhole corps will accept new players that are willing to learn. I wouldn't wait to train your skills, I'd jump right in. Your new corp mates will gladly help with that stuff. The best place to learn is in the environment you want to play in. :)
---

I just started up around a month ago, failed twice and just started off again, lots of good information, here and on the web.

But youre right tho. I just wanna join goons for the corp tag of gewns. Idc about everything except for that tag and thats about it
---
Empty jump freighters have become absolutely unusable near Jita. Even regular, empty freighters are often ganked in Uedama.
---
This kind of ganking serves absolutely nobody. It's a single dude having fun blowing them up while the victims might end up quitting.
---
Hey atleast your friend was allowed to make a new account. Think about fcs like Pando and Dark Shines that would have to try ban evasion shit and we all know how well that worked for gigx. I dont think the amount of assets should play any role in a decision like that.
---
cool thanks do you have recommendations?
---
I mean, they did feed a bunch of subcaps sooo. Can't really help it if the other side doesn't want to bring a real response fleet.
---
Then yeh, scanning as high as possible and Cruiser and Battlecrusier skills.
---
Even at C5 and C6 corps Battleships arent used that much because they take too much mass.
---
Eve-University have a wormhole campus and are worth looking into. I think you have to graduate from their main corp but they teach good skills and i dont think it takes too long, probably just about long enough to train up some skills.
---
What would be a good anti ganking ship?
---
I'm looking for: 
---
-relatively cheap,
---
-offensively counter (so it will be Concorded) up to tornados in high sec. Essentially I see a ganker ship land in grid, I want to shoot it.
---
-It will be for protecting mining ops, so not looking to counter gate camps
---
-preferably 5 to 15km range maybe further but I don't know.
---
His posts have been pretty entertaining and that one in the forums was awesome too. If he wrote a full book, I'd definitely read it.
---
Officer mods aren't calculated properly when it comes to this. As well as anything you have in the market isn't counted properly IMO.
---

That half is a direct take from some game called Skyrim. You probably never heard of it since it was released after eve, but I hear it was popular.

The rest is pretty self explanatory of course.

There are 2 different PLA atm, one is a single corp alliance witth about 650 ppl, one is a Corp inside Imperium. Not sure who is who ...
---

---
You come here bitching about a behavior which is pretty much THE FOCUS OF THE ENTIRE GAME, and when someone calls you on your bullshit and tells you how Eve works, you throw a fucking fit and spit in his face. The only SJW here is you, with all your whining and "save me from the mean stream snipers" special little snowflake bullshit.
---
Much like in life, no one in Eve gives a fuck about your delicate sensibilities or even whether or not you're still breathing at the end of the day, because to us it really doesn't matter.
---
You are a nobody, high off his own arrogant bullshit yet lacking in any defining characteristics or ability. You think you deserve special treatment for being completely average and uninspiring. Then you have the audacity to level attacks and insults at those who are gracious enough to try and help you out of the miserable pit of self loathing that is your life.
---
Do yourself and everyone around you a favor, get off Twitch, get off Eve, and go find some fucking perspective you narcissistic twat.
---
We'll be here, taking the good WITH the bad.
---
What PLA is the current PIBC vanguard, i always thought the corp in Imperium? What about that PLA alliance? Anyone knows Imperium standings towards them ?
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
If you are simply travelling, look at inertial stabilizers and look up the cloak + microwarpdrive trick to get past gatecamps or gankers.
---
None specifically as I am not a wormholer myself, but there are often recruitment ads on r/evejobs. I am sure a wormhole bro who reads this will be able to give better info.

Welcome to Period Basis. How may I be of assistance?
---
&gt;Remember when high sec was actually supposed to be a safe haven?
---
No, because that was never the case.
---
...And suddenly theres a lot more structures out in the boondocks of Solitude.
---
Injectors and a shitload of unpunished botting will fix that. Don't forget, botting, P2W etc is not a bad thing in China. You count as stupid if you dont do it.
---
kick suad
---
Yes... Yes it was. Before CODE, what wasn't safe about highsec?
---
 Something like a blackbird with jams skewed toward gank ship races like gallente and minmatar and alot of scan res even so it's not guaranteed you'll land the jam but better than nothing on the flipside you could also try a griffin .Note that you may not stop alpha strike gank like artillery nados but stuff like catalyst vexor and taos gank could be stoped if you're on the ball and there's not too many attackers
---
TQ is not Serenity. I hope CCP will prepare for this and make some changes to anomalies that can make botting harder or even impossible
---
The concept still works - recall is instant I think. Drop probes off dscan, dscan to 1AU, probe and recall as soon as you get a hit, even if not 100%. Repeat if needed if you didn’t get a 100% on the first try (I.e. recall and relaunch off scan instead of scanning again)
---
Yes.
---
Hey! I would like to try trading too. Can you give some advices for the dumb F1-monkey?
---
Cool.  I’ll test it on Linux later.
---
And some just haven’t ever been available. Aurum is the word you were looking for, btw
---
Yeah I thought of that route but my concern is cost considering that I plan to be proactive, not reactive. So I would be the one on the receiving end of the Concord response.
---
Instead of a cloak expedition ships should be immune from d-scan, you could then mine in an asteroid belt without detection unless somebody is willing to warp to every mining belt/anomaly in system to check.

The PLA alliance in lowsec is ran by PLA

Apart from, you know, a lot of the corps in winter were already from PIBC.

Skills determine what you can fly not where you can fly.

I joined a wormhole Corp with less than 5m SP. I didn’t have cloak for a month or two. It’s perfectly possible and there are jobs you can do. From day 1 I was scanning in an imicus, and ratting with the Nestor fleets in a Dominix. Sure things might be easier with more skills, and cloaking is awesome. But if you want to live in wormholes, just live in wormholes. Alpha or not, skills or not.
---
So they joining FRT?? I am confused and who are these guys anyways?
---
It already is
---
I cherry pick in wormholes. 
---
1. It makes running them faster making it harder for someone to find me.
---
2. When a site despawns it is removed from the scan list. Someone watching the list would know I was there even out of dscan range. Why give free extra intel?
---
3. The respawn will be in some other wormhole system I am unlikely to visit so why should I care if that happens.
---
4. It generates a new reddit post at least every six months.
---
&gt;p, And most of the rest of winter 
---
well, it'll even it out somewhat, 70-30 is kinda less fun so yea it'd be better for overall tq server unless you want it ended like serenity, we're almost there.
---
evictus and req are trash? that's news
---
From what I was told Test leadership told everyone that our allies are stupid or retarded or something like that.  but don't quote me on that.  I mean you ask everyone to go an crab in one region.  You do not have protection for your peeps this is going to happen.  Making your allies feel like crap is not the answer.   I mean your allies are your backbone of your coalition.  I mean moral is a fickle thing.    You really need to watch what you say.
---
As someone who hates damavik fitting requirements thanks for using kikis.
---
 If I were them I'd begin in FW until members gained bit of sp through training then move to null .  Regardless few things are sure to happen. PLEX will rise faster and faster as they enter the market more as consumers some meta modules may go up as they'll need them looking especially at meta 4 cruiser and bs guns,suicide ganking will rise as they can use it to gain fast isk by using cheap ships
---
Imagine being such an edgelord you CARED ENOUGH TO REPLY 🤣

Come on now Elo, you love fighting our talwars.

suicide gankers have existed as long as EVE as has existed

This is the most satisfying option.
---
Actually, he doesn't fight talwars. Skill curve is too much. Doesn't know how to fight em'.
---
If you intend to kill suicide catalyst and get Concorded you will loose a lot more than them and they will still be able to suicide gank your mates later on.
---
Dumb question but how exactly would PIBC come to TQ? Would they be starting from scratch? Or do they already have a presence/allies/ISK here to get started? I'd imagine they could mobilize quickly, but starting with zero ships and ISK would be pretty daunting for an organization of their sophistication.
---
The irony in your comment is off the charts.
---
He like your Rorq more
---
If even half of those bot their way into titans they can stand toe to toe with goons
---
Thanks 4 clarification, so that remy guy is just shittalking

Pathfinders is recruiting.  We can teach you the way of the interceptor explorer...also would love to know which dick is cherry picking.  I tell my folks that is bad ju-ju.
---
It's based on average price of stuff on market, the average price paid for low volume item is usually junk because it's dragged down by the super low-ball regional buy orders. For really low volume items, 2-3 transactions are enough to completely change the average by a large margin.
---
I think that all may have had something to do with Intel about 200+ Muninns heading their way, yet dudes still managed to stay in core.
---
Something like that.
---
I think Vily pinged something along the lines of “our allies are fucking idiots”
---
But... but... I might never get more than 3 killmarks on a ship again!
---
You can tell by the pixels. ENHANCE!
---
Yet another reason to DELETE C4
---
(They spawn in all classes btw)
---
You really shouldn't do that. That's begging for them to come with brick tanked catalyst and watch you die for free.
---
Hence why I am asking. I am trying to find more knowledge about it. There is not much out there about active high sec miner protection. Everything is reactive and also a thought towards saving the anti ganking ship. I'm wanting to come from the perspective of a ship is ammo and so my thought process is it is expendable.
---
Dude this is the most fun I'll have today holy shit.
---
Ghost sites are in all security levels (hs ls NS and wh). Ofc ourse the loot differs. They dont havre ennemies for say but they have a timer. After couple of minutes ennemies warp in and deal massive dmg. Sleeper caches are only in empire space (hs ls and ns). They come in 3 différent difficulty levels and they can (to make it short) be done with frigates (almost no damage taken)
---
 A catalyst won't kill something like a barge instantly also some of them are already flashy red
---
Winter Co has a massive advantage atm as they krabbed together a sizeable Titan fleet already, also they have "friends" in the north.
---
This will inevitably lead to PIBC TQ-spinoff hugging the enemies of this block, Imperium + Legacy.
---
One of my favourite ships, perfect for wormholes and many ways it can be fit.
---
This just reinforces the fact that Evictus and Requiem are not very good at PvPing on their own, and that Holesale, despite all attempts of trying to convince everyone that they are a wormhole corporation, are in the end a highsec wardec corporation.
---
Very true but again you are consolidated into one region you should be ready to defend your allies.  Tactically it makes sense to consolidate.  On the other hand it gives one location for enemies to concentrate there attacks. It boils down to if your members cannot make money or plex their accounts they will go places that they can.  Just a thought.
---
They always drop in the site right after you decide to stop.
---
What time zone are you?

Aww. Poor Elo can’t help but trash talk in a perfectly unbiased, well written AAR.

Looking at Serenity's 24 hour login peak (https://eve-offline.net/?server=serenity). Serenity is really just PIBC at this point. Must be lonely.

they will most likely get isk/assets from their friends in goons (PLA)
---

---
lol
---
57 vs. 101 in blinged out ships. Losing 2:1 *MUST* mean Evictus and Req are shit if they lose that objective. At least we undocked and fought, isnt that what matters?
---
old goons vs new goons would be a rather interesting examination I think
---
That is the whole point of the Abyss expansion - serve as an isk sink. Same principles as a gambling. Risk your 3 bil  ship in a hope of winning something valuable.
---
Treat it as if you lost your money in a casino, sad but nothing to do.
---
CCP won't get your ship back unless it is their server failure.
---
If it's 3b for your ship+pod how much do you make an hour? I know investment for t4 and t5 is quite high buy profits must be high too right?
---
I'm assuming t3 and below are very low profit wise
---

---
I hope you dont think that Brisc would actually have a chance in a court case do you?
---
And how would you know they "didn't actually conduct an investigation prior to all this?"
---
Oh I understand its a PvP game, just wanted to understand it more and Reddit usually has more direct points and many diffrent views on certain things. The more I know from different perspectives the better it is no?
---
And I'm not salty at all I was just trying to figure stuff out IOT better protect myself from stuff like that.
---
They come over through VPNs and bot the everloving shit out of the game.
---
Busy little bee you are this morning.  That makes sense since your home land is Deseret...right?
---
You're have the right mindset but the wrong direction. First, your miners should fly the highest tank barge/exhumer in HS, always, that will do the job for 99% of gankers. 
---
You really should just fly some battleship, lock them when they land on grid and start killing them the moment they aggress. Or just fly logi. You could just look and see if you can just split your gun and kill two at the same time. Gank catalyst generally paper thin, sneezing on them would probably be enough, and they don't alpha they just have high dps so killing them after their first cycle should work.
---
I thought you spoke Russian.
---
To research bpos during a time when other players didnt know to
---
Your ship drifted out of the arena and died to the death fog probably. Atleast that's what support told me when I had the same problem. THey didn't reimburse me.
---
Yep, when you have intel about enemy fleets heading your way but you decide to continue mining, but calling your allies "retarded" doesnt make it any better. Everyone makes mistakes and sometimes those mistakes take the worse out of us...we are humans after all...I m sure Vily didnt mean it. :)
---
How so? I just asked questions about what I know from other MMOs. If you don't feel like answering or helping out you could have just skipped this. How else am I supposed to learn about stuff? All I had from this CODE corp is 2 opposing point of views. 1: CODE is a savior 2. Code is terrible. I need to understand what is what don't you think?

Damn it I feel you and I are ideologically aligned on this one. Don't forget the line where it talks about falun gong.

Well I'm not part of them if that's what you mean but do they do posts like this a lot?
---
So you missed all of malcanis and bliss posting, ok? It's all here on reddit
---
Get back to work. Hey do they have green jello in Central Russia?
---
Why a lot people say pibc will be friend with goons because of PLA corp ? I know nothing about the relation of the them, and I played both servers.
---
Or maybe if you're not ready to defend them, because you just jump cloned somewhere else to defend a Rorq from the same fleet you are warning them about, you pass on the Intel, and tell them to get out of core and dock.
---
If they fail to do that, they are being retarded.
---
Use your polite words Elder. Remember who you represent.
---
Can I jam drones from their ships, if so how long are they jammed, and if I can jam them can I scoop them?
---
I just used my experiences from other MMOs for the questions, I don't know if this is really how stuff works in EvE. Think of it as you will but at least say something helpful this answer was completely useless to me.  
---
Thank for trying?

---
Not an isk sink. Losing the ship is, in fact, an isk faucet. (Because of insurance)
---
It's a sink for expensive mods, but that isk has already been traded to another player and still exists in the market. When I ship explodes in the abyss, the only change in the level of existing isk is the insurance payout.
---
You are much better off sitting in a Logi and trying to counter the dps a bit.
---
You can't win them all. Each loss brings our line members, logi and FCs experience. I was proud of how we performed.
---
"talk trash on somebody who be actin' a fool"
---
&gt;I don't know where you got the second part from. I guess my question to you is really - why don't you support increasing the value of ISK and making it harder to bot/AFK? 
---
These aren't actual solutions, making it harder to produce a bot doesn't actually effect the users of those bots. Any increase in value of isk would benefit bots in a situation where bots are the only ones left able to afk rat
---
Those solutions end up helping botters (with more value/time) and harming legitimate players who lose a way of making isk
---
People aren't going to suddenly enjoy clicking red x's for hours just because they can't afk a vni anymore. If people can't turn a vni on with one character and go do something they actually want to do on another they're going to be pulled towards boting
---
Reeeee not an isk sink, a highend module sink!
---
Although it probably does sink more isk than it pays out, since cruiser insurance is minimal and module price increasing -&gt; more taxes.
---
Who the fuck let the corp hopper out of his cage?!
---
and pibc is the winner of chinese server, it has hundreds of corps, why pla corp so important? and pla corp has a shit reputation in chinsese community, dissed by most of chinese players on tq atm.
---
MINERS EVERYWHERE FEAR HIM
---
They had to... How do you actually think it would be all been okay if they silently banned a CSM member, someone the community VOTED for, and then refused to comment? You're really not a thinker are you.
---
Okay, that's the endgame. Where do you think they'll be starting? Holding space where, and with what political backup?

This is Jason Andrus.  He was using the name Mason Pierce in *Threats*.  Not sure if we're going to keep the tattoo or not.  Depends on reader reaction.

They'll only reimburse from any server side issues. Loss of internet doesn't qualify, but once in a while you'll get someone who may have a heart and bring your shit back, but this would have to be your first issue.
---
Imperium alone has more than all of PanFam. What rock have you been living under these past 2-3 years?
---
How? I thought filaments were hard locked to cruisers for solo and frigates for party of two or three? Or does that go down to party of one as well?
---
Which raises the question, why not destroyers?
---
Same same... but different.
---
You don't need Abyssal sites to lose ships due to internet failure.
---
Time to crowdfund rmt money from gotg to appease the new Chinese overlords
---
There was even suicide gankers in the Beta 😂
---
Yeah very true.  But again calling people that word is really offensive.  People do not need to be using that word to regard stupid decisions.  Shit does happen.  Its unfortunate but it does.  
---
The question really is, if everyone is supposed to be in Immensea for deployment.  Why is Test still ratting and mining in Esotaria?  Seems to me the breakdown is not with your allies but within TEST.  You are asking your allies to meat shield for TEST to crab in home region.  Please note I am just stating and observation.
---
Just invest in a lowsec gate to Stain obviously.
---
underrated commented
---
The cans are close enough that I've never had problems repositioning if they go to another can. But that fitting space a scanner would take can be used much better by other mods.
---
my personal theory is that it may be a corruption or spelling drift of the scandinavian Korstog or "crusade".  
---
while its true that the trigs are based on slavic myths instead of nordic ones the two real world cultures are rather close geographically, and there seems to be at least some sort of connection between trigs and minmatar (who are heavily nordic influenced)

It's not racism. I know people like to throw that word around, but it's not. Is it unfair to VPN users... yes. Would the majority of VPN users happen to be of a specific race in this situation.....yes. But is this user being racist by suggesting sanctions against VPN users.....no.

###TRANSLATION:
---
&gt;Dear fellow knuckle dragging botting filth,
---
&gt;Content has been difficult to obtain lately, not that many of us
---
really care because our python scripts interract with the game more than we do.  However, for those of us wanting to engage in 1337 pvp like dropping 100 lancing titans on a lone dreadnaught, you'll notice that virtually everyone on the server is blue.
---
&gt;To resolve this matter we have explored several potential solutions.  One director suggested that PIBC dissolve, once again creating multiple independent entities which might breathe new life into our thoroughly stagnated server.  The director in question has been sacked and his assets frozen.  
---
&gt;We metastasize to new sever in 1 week.  Please prepare to migrate your botting accounts to facilitate optimal acquisition of skill injectors and lancing titans.  We have reached out to Imperial legacy for immediate blue status and crabbing rights. 
---
###LONG LIVE PIBC
---
##TIWAN NUMBA WON
---
Funny as hell, and good to see the return of CCP Enis.  A treat to read.
---
Some people like to play this game by joining the strongest entity. It doesn't make sense to me on TQ, but it made even less sense on serenity yet they still did it. I assume they are not the type to try and be independent or the underdog.
---
Awesome, I'm sitting on 30 of them I need to sell.
---
Ummm...
---
So quick question, what was the "17 km" "ARMOR HACS ARMOR HACS ARMOR HACS" back and forth about? Clearly it was a disagreement on target selection and I've never flown an armor HAC doctrine, so I figured I'd ask.
---
It's showing chat channels, the top one (1 Conference Hall) has 1942 people in it.
---
I honestly don't really know anything about the political landscape of the game to answer that, all I've heard is that Frat hates them although it's hard to tell how long that will last once they're actually in TQ.
---

---
I bet this happened over toilet disputes...
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/the-49-u6u-slaughterhouse       PIBC Coalition
---
Pan-Intergalactic Business Community:
---
Consisting of over 25,000 members and also known as PIBC, this group is Serenity’s biggest and oldest alliance. They own most of the western side of nullsec, including the sought after regions of Delve, Querious and Fountain, along with Outer Ring and Period Basis. After recent events, they also have a strong foothold in the north, with control over Tenal, Tribute, Vale of the Silent, Geminate and part of both The Kalevala Expanse and Etherium Reach.
---
VENI VIDI VICI:
---
Usually known as 3V, this group used to be a pure pirate alliance but have since evolved into a strong ally and mercenary contractor for PIBC which bolsters the coalition’s fleet strength significantly. The close ties between these two alliances are thought to be linked to the close out-of-game ties between their leaders, who both live in the city of Chengdu, in southwest China.
---
RACOA/FDK coalition
---
R.A.C:
---
Serenity’s second-largest alliance, totalling some 20,000 players, this group was part of PIBC until September 2008. An economic dispute over the Stain region saw a large number of PIBC secede and form R.A.C., which now controls the entire south of Serenity’s map, including Stain, Impass, Tenerifis, Detorid, Esoteria, Feythabolis, Omist and Paragon Soul.
---
Fadeklein Alliance:
---
Serenity’s fourth-largest alliance, FDK had been friendly with PIBC almost throughout Serenity’s eight-year history, until the recent conflict. It holds sovereignty in Fade, Deklein, Cloud Ring and Pure Blind.
---
City Of Angels:
---
Also known as COA, and sporting a member count of over 10,000, this is the sister alliance of R.A.C and Serenity’s fifth-largest alliance. It holds sovereignty over Providence, Immensea, Wicked Creek, Catch, Curse and Scalding Pass, and secures R.A.C.’s access to a number of chokepoints into empire space.
---
FOF:
---
A relatively recently formed alliance made up of ex-PIBC rebels. Many of the corporations in this group used to be part of PIBC in Fountain, and it is said that their leader has personal dissatisfaction with leader of PIBC, which caused them to splinter from the main alliance.
---
July Alliance:
---
July Alliance wasn’t involved in the 49-U6U epic battle, but they do remain part of the story and no longer exist now since their defeat and disbandment in January 2014. JA were at one point a subordinate alliance of PIBC and held sovereignty over Tribute, Branch and Tenal
---
I think you've been drinking too much panfam coolaid
---
Someone is a genius!
---
Yeah foundtain has some , pretty sure other npc regions aswell
---
A 21-hour-long engagement ensued, which became known as The Bloodbath of B-R5RB. This fight, along with the attempted interdiction of reinforcements on the way to the system, resulted in the destruction of 75 titans, 13 supercarriers, 370 dreadnaughts and 123 carriers, totalling an estimated value of a little over 11,000,000,000,000 (11 trillion) ISK, eclipsing the Battle of Asakai as the largest and most costly single engagement in the history on EVE Online.

I don't think ECM modules cause drones to disconnect from their host ship, but this would be some sick pirate gameplay if say you could jam and scoop someone's shiny new geckos!
---
TBH it seems laggy more than anything else, some of the new characters I made recently (zero assets) were still showing hundreds of millions after I moved stuff to other characters.
---
Mainly importing
---
CCPlz if this isn't in the game make it happen
---
COSMOS constellations.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/COSMOS#COSMOS_constellations
---
They have special missions that reward *'storyline'* items.  They're also the eight constellations that used to be the sole source of gas used in booster manufacturing.  But now that stuff can spawn all over.  Though those eight constellations are still the most lucrative ones (more gas sites, larger clouds).
---
&gt;The most common misconception in EVE is that CODE doesn't actually honor permits, which we do. We have a database with over 800 active permits in it.
---
Mind you, that is exactly what he would be saying if it was a scam.
---
&gt;The question really is, if everyone is supposed to be in Immensea for deployment. Why is Test still ratting and mining in Esotaria? Seems to me the breakdown is not with your allies but within TEST. You are asking your allies to meat shield for TEST to crab in home region. Please note I am just stating and observation.
---
So you think Test should stop krabbing so they can protect you while you krab?
---
I got nothing man.
---
💳 sell plex
---
Death to rainbow road.
---
This exactly.
---
Pull your zap and full send.
---
TEST is still losing more shit in Esotaria anyway.  The whole thing is kinda piss poor planning, but whatever.
---
Inb4 unspoken retreats to lowsec until PanFam gets bored
---
"At least it isn't us in Esoteria again"
---
You really need to get a life.
---
You assume that I live where I'm hacking.
---
You'd refit the cargo scanner afterwards. Alternatively, just sit next to a "Ruins" can and hope. 
---
Repositioning in time is also a function of how fast they can hack, and cherry pickers, being smarter and more experienced than your  average explorer, would also have the skills and the skills to hack fast.

Have you heard about the first poster-in-chief, butterdog?
---
You left out MTU hunters.
---
they cant do that, not allowed
---
They are all sub channels' name
---
Probably the same one your leaders were hiding under when they allowed Goons to (re)build that fleet while you evicted your own allies at the end of WWB.
---
Now they're enormous and PL is a punchline.
---
What do you use to pay for stuff then, your Walmart credit card and EBT stamps?
---
&gt;At least we undocked and fought, isnt that what matters?
---
I mean not really. It's good to know you're doing less botting/kicking people for awoxing bots and more pvp, but feeding if you can't win isn't wise?
---
Your link currently links me to one of your specific responses in the previous thread? I'm on mobile so maybe that's the issue, but I think you want to be linking to: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bbzn0t/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_april_11/ instead

Imagine thinking ganking miners is "fighting against a player".
---
Imagine thinking being isk positive when ganking is somewhat skill.
---
:')
---
So you can steal drones, though it’s kinda a pain. You need 5-6 command destroyers, and have to chain boosh them 500km away, them ecm them before you can steal them.
---
Have not played in a long time, well before the subscription/omega changes. Wanted to try to free version of the game on my old account. Have a quick question on the pyfa though if anybody can answer. Will it recognise that my account is not an omega one and instruct me on what builds I can use or not?
---
I think he is saying that TEST told everybody that they had to leave their home regions to come to immensea and act as a meat shield while they stayed in Esoteria.  Not a bad plan on TEST's part, but imagine that the rest of Legacy thinks that plan sucks balls.
---
i miss you wally

Yawn, not even a proper cooypasta. Also,

&gt; implying NC cares about renters

LOL
---
1. only starter systems are safe for newbros. if you get killed in a starter system you can petition CCP for EULA breach . The exact list of systems is here https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203209712-Rookie-Griefing . Any other system, or if you are not a newbro anymore, anybody is free tokill you.
---
2. right now you have a hard time to get ships, but later on just farming a little bit can grant you those ships values in less than 10min. They can even farm with one alt, while the other is killing you.
---
3. their permit is worth what you pay it. period. If you pay it, you will learn for a cheap price that you must not trust people in eve. (10M is cheap)
---
4. actually they are doing a job of making new player think about the game, have interactions with other players, discuss on reddit, learn that nowhere is safe, etc. which is a very important part of the game. They don't gain anything from killing newbros, and though their RP (and permit) is BS they actually are very consistent in making the game rougher to play in HS.
---
5. ask them :) Some of them are very nice people, once they killed you. Just don't fall in the "permit" scam.
---
6. you can't pvp someone who does not want to play. forget them, just make them lose their time trying to search for you.
---
7. the community does not exist.
---
mastery is a trap..
---
But astero is the shit.
---
Wow, dropping that thermonuclear cringe bomb

Welcome to EVE. You just became a real player with your forcible introduction to PvP. Congratulations! You will be considered a trespasser if you use highsec space without a mining permit. The purpose of the permit is show that you appreciate player-generated content and are willing to follow the rules of the sovereign.
---
See the CODE. new player guide: http://www.minerbumping.com/2019/02/eve-online-new-player-guide-part-1.html
---
You're seeing TQ in two years, tops.
---
nice work with a missed opportunity of editing the menu bar
---
Not to be rude, but what sort of class exactly? 
---
Your post history from the past two months has been nothing but these surveys every couple of days. So I’d personally like more information before answering your survey. 
---
Maybe it’s just me, but this is mmo where scamming is a legitimate career. So I’m understandably cautious.
---
"Smarter and more experienced than average explorer"
---
Ok, you guys have some misunderstanding. Many PIBC members already joined FRT two years ago. I was a PIBCer, moved to TQ 4 years ago. Many immigrants developed Fuxi Legion (now the biggest corp in FRT). And 6 directors including me come from Serenity, some are PIBCer, some are Anti-PIBCer.
---
I'm a Goon, homie, never trust flairs.

---
Quite a few NPSI groups stage out of Berta.  Fairly well-stocked market for basic ships, a couple of contracts always available for simple ships, etc.
---
Querious is just next door, and it's only a handful of jumps from Provi if you feel like bugging the fringe miners in a REALLY fast doctrine.
---
Back when I FC'd for RR, frigate-heavy or fast-warping destroyer doctrines are able to clear a couple of the groups that like to capitalize (heh) on slower-moving ships or slow FCs in the area.
---
Immediately into provi?  Shedoo, Gamis, Bar, Gomati, Assah, G-5EN2 (Provi).  Given, it's usually camped or whatnot, so you need to have scouts spread their feelers out.
---
Go into lowsec in Derelik?  You've got Shedoo, Ihal, Mifrata, Sendaya, Onsooh, Shamahi and a couple of branches there.
---
Straight to nullsec?  Shedoo, Ihal, Mifrata, Sendaya, Doril, and then you can go either to:
---
Curse:  Utopia, Litom, Jamunda, 1P, FAR2-Q (there's a couple of pockets here), ZXIC-7 (branching to Tenerfis or Immensea).  
---
You can also go from the other end if you have an INCREDIBLY fast doctrine to get into Catch via HED-GP and then straight into Provi from there.
---
The usual way is Doril, Jorund/Utopia, Hemin, RMOC, K-QWHE (be careful, the groups here like to do bubble traps and use bombers IIRC), CL-85V, 8G-MQV, VOL-MI, K-B (this is a pocket), D8, 0SHT-A ("Oh shit", one of my favorite systems), U-Q, and you've got a lot of time to get back home if you've had half a fleet devastated via HED-GP/Kerberz.
---
If you want to go REALLY deep or you have good intel, you can head into Querious from there, via V-3, HY, Q-U, 4-07MU.  That's pretty much the point where you either whelp the fleet or you start losing people due to getting bored or falling asleep from lack of (or too much!) content.
---
You REALLY have to be careful taking groups through Mifrata &amp; Sendaya (the first two lowsec jumps out of Berta) since NPSI groups generally have a LOT of spies for larger corporations in them, intentionally or unintentionally.  This means that the lowsec systems of Mifrata &amp; Sendaya are really dangerous for small but expensive doctrines because smartbombs are a thing.
---
The local groups also like to drop supers on large enough fleets if they're really bored.
---
Start over from scratch with some RMT and Botting.
---
I think eve uni has a Wh section but im not 100%
---
Whs corps are becoming smaller and more tight nit or solo these days baring high class.
---
But as many have mentioned scanning skills, beyond that gas harvesting in a venture will be your second best income. (I think alphas can get lvl2) it will Quickly move to first if you can get high class gas like c320 in c5-6s. Ask google for specifics.
---
They should just freeze everything in that pocket upon logout. Yeah its very risky due to extremely difficult npcs, not to disconnect. That's just stupid.
---
You can fetch your character skills and set clone status to alpha yourself. It will correctly limit your skills and show which skills you have missing, in the skill tooltip.
---
Best advice I could give you is to fit up a T1 explorer and find wormholes from HS into C1-3's and hunt relic sites. Once you understand how not to die and have a little isk, get an astero and hunt relic sites and other explorers. You could then maybe join a corp living in a C3/HS or a C4/C3/X and rat in the C3 with nestors/rattle/gila to make some pretty good isk, while also being able to pew. Check r/evejobs for some active corps. Also while alpha is fine starting out, omega really is a game changer given the use of covops cloak.
---
This.

Are you chevis?

are you a knock off Grath?

Non-code gankers aren't hitting the same targets over and over again. They would be judged as griefers because their targets are random and based on the non-permit holder's loot value. CODE. sometimes needs to keep going back to the same belts repeatedly though, because try as we might to get out the word about the importance and value of holding a valid HighSec mining permit, some pods are just really hard to reach. The worry is that a GM may be new to the game, and not know about all of the safety concerns that obviously happen when industry isn't at least minimally regulated. By adding that monetary component, we can make it clear that it's not about ruining one person's day. Rather, it's about improving the entirety of New Edens health and safety. 
---
We do this FOR our fellow players, not "to" them. CODE. is a free public service for everyone.
---
How do i make isk if my rental space has been burned by a group
---
That is exactly right - I am not saying TEST should not rat or mine.  I am saying be on the front lines with your coalition.  And Tecnic I am on the other side just making observations.
---
I love Eve for that kind of diplomatic talks.
---
What happend ?
---
*grab popcorn*
---
Have you taught them the “log off when overwhelmed” truck yet?
---
FRT is a TQ alliance, it was here 10 years ago. Was a core member of The Old N3 co. At that time, Pgd was the main commander.
---
If you didnt get a km id petition but most of the comments are right.. Shit happens in abyss space. And thats why most of us dont run t4-5.
---
Il play with a t1 or faction but I wont superbling it. my eve has a tendency to drop one client out of three mostly for the lulz it appears cuz I have a stable connection. Its Scary enough in a DED couldnt imagine losing my rattle/mach with of isk to an abyss hickup.
---
I guess we won already by default too
---
Hey, thx for your help. So I've fetched my kills via the eve sso feature. Do you know where I set myself as an alpha within pyfa?
---
Unspoken has been bullying NC and BOT, they killed off pretty much most of the rental space and NC still needs to be paid.
---
These scum of the earth must be eradicated, so NC is in full motion, kicking people that dont deploy.
---
[I think you're obsessed, bud](https://imgur.com/27Wmg7q)

IIRC it was 3 days. Especially the third day was a lot about diplomacy between subreddits

Your young, soft mind is a true blessing. Those of us from 08 and beyond see you as either a youthful renewal or a complete jackass that's only spent a year in the game and knows nothing. Good luck on your travels my beautiful, naive, glimmer of hope.
---
Never too old to be bitter
---
obviously, you guys are much better at the game, way more indepth knowledge of game mechanics and better individual pilot skill.
---
Should be an easy win, no way it lasts longer than 2 weeks.
---
It's audiences numble, not year numble (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
---
not allowed by who tho
---
Then why an eternal enemy member became director of Frt...(I mean, me)
---
&gt; **PIBC meeting,2000 membre ready to join** 
---
So that means what ? 2000 members, lets say 10 average bot accounts each, so 20 k accounts ? Add to that alt accounts, scouts, transport, indy, etc. so maybe around 25k accounts ? What is their average actual player to bot ratio 1:20 ?
---
that's a weird projection.
---
i mean... the sad part is, that this is the only content you really can get in a big group nowadays. 
---
tackle rorqs and pray for that 1%chance the defenders dont just drop a bazillion of supers.
---
''FUN''
---
You know those could be your respawns too right?  
---
The side effect of what you are doing is that you have to spend more time looking for sites because the sites you don't finish wont respawn anywhere else for a considerable time.
---
&gt; When I do a day of t5 fillaments I am happy to get 2.
---
Heh, they have weird drop rates, sometimes I get 2 day, but most of the times I get none for 2 weeks straight.
---
When all you want to do is run your bots in peace, it makes sense to join the group that offers the most safe space to run your bots in peace
---
Eve actually has a very friendly community, despite its reputation. Yeah, people are savage and will kill you without hesitation or regret, and scams are totally allowed, but that doesn't mean everyone's toxic and mean. Most people are quite friendly and helpful. Trust is the most important currency in Eve, and once you have earned some, you'll find it becomes quite a different game. The best way to start earning some trust, like others have said, is to join a decent corp.
---
*The first Rorqual was in Eso
---
Is PL a thing?  Hopefully NC will now show up more then Horde.
---
This could be the most exciting thing to happen to this game since WWB
---
I'd say just solo play through starter missions and lvl1 epic arc and you will have a decent idea if you like the game. As a newb it will take quite a while to complete those and will be completely doable as f2p.
---
If you take breaks, just logging in once in 24h+ will keep your skills upgrading even when you are not actively playing, and once you get the urge to watch space explosions you will feel the progress done while you were not playing.
---
So I'd say eve is a nice fit for your playstyle.
---
The intent was to balance them. They could tank 100 HACs easily and still have 7 minutes of invincibility.  
---
Before it was too easy to drop 100 supers/ titans on a tackled idiot. Larger alliances will need to adapt.
---
Most smart people tend to feel queasy when the conversation turns to things like "certain death" and "total failure" and the idea of a "doomed alliance." But not me. I am comfortable with these themes. There is nothing new about them, except when they come all at once. Any conversation that can make smart people confront a mix of Death, Doom, and Failure with a straight face is probably worth listening in on. They don't come around real often, and when they do it almost always means that at least two of the people doing the talking are in very serious trouble.
---
“They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end.
---
The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies;
---
The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned;
---
Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes.
---
A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned —
---
The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned;
---
The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned"
---
ironically would be less cringe coming from an actual NC. member rather than you (unspoken)
---
Now I can’t get the image out of my head 🥺
---
hey wait a minute, i thought EvE had people who were noble in their speech.

*leave it to Reddit to dismantle that.*

I should know, I'm in Rote.

That's a good question, do you plan to stay with FRT or join the official PIBC entity in tq?

Sure, but you also need to have a better strategy than just "Shoot that guy", especially since you know who is coming and what they are bringing.
---
 Use eve marketer to find region price discrepancies
---
My only abyssal loss got a resounding "logs show nothing" when I had the login server also die for me.
---
All other internet things were fine, just eve was fucked.
---
If you want to rat or mine in whatever region you want under your own super umbrella, I'm sure no one is going to stop you.
---
It doesnt matter where you rat or mine if you ignore intel that there are 200+ Muninns looking for rorqs. You're gonna die pretty much regardless under the new patch.
---
didn't test move capitals and supers to 08-n precisely to help defend people keeping ADMs high in Immensea?
---
they didn't burn their faxes, supers, and titans to eso lmfao
---
Does that mean we're just going to YOLO them every time someone ignores intel?
---
I'm sure you would like that, but that's just not really smart.
---
carriers and faxes were undocked in l-5 for basically that entire fight. plenty of time to form, they just didn't.

this is the post that, roku's basilisk style, killed Rote Kapelle from the future

I pray everyday for the extermination of  C4 space. Why? Because  The common C4 linemember, due to weeks of  genetic  inbreeding via ts3 since their chains are fucking shit so they  cant get any members, has been rendered retarded, autistic, and without  senses  of honor, armor brawls, or pvp mentality.  The large C4  "communities" are actually cancerous  growths caused by an inherited  genetic mutation in what was once the  frontal lobe of the brain  due to   high levels of liquid spud in the brain. This is also known as  radiated C4 spudbrain. Look at WH tapi brave division. They live in a  fucking C4 wolf rayet. Cancer on top of cancer.
---
The  daily routine of the common c4 corps  consists of  scanning, scanning,  scanning, scanning and when you get something other than a C3 site  runner passive rattlesnake ( that still kills like half your fleet and  mjds out) you roll out content with yachts. Then you ping for a mining  fleet and get dunked on by a couple frigs because you left the frig hole  open like a classic c6 russian dread runner.    When  the C4 corps are  getting camped and thus mining is unavailable, c4 directors have been  known to release their pent up mining blueballs on their own members,  looking for the most minuscule excuse to enforce C4 commissar tapi/bee  like laws on newbros and executing them via koolaid  injections ( with  the poison, in game)
---
C4  corps have an irrational fear of high class space. They imprint this  tapi like  mentality on all their members via mining links. They  unironically think,no, believe  that just mentioning the slight, very  minuscule possibility of moving to C5 space is gonna spawn HK and  lazerhawks in their C4 wh like some fucking voldemort hitler shit ICBM  curse on their gay ass azbel and print 350 caps out of it to evict them.  If they dare move to C5 space they wholeheartedly believe their new wh  would be preseded by HK  and hawks via 10,000 dread alts.
---
But   C4 corps are evolving, c4 corps killed hk, they helped init, everyone  knows this but their biggest secret is that they know how to kill C5  corps without even undocking. Please take a look at lazerhawks discord  server, specially the members avatars. Have you noticed something? Yes,  you have. **the  lazerhawks  discord  members avatars makes you think you are in a furry convention discord  server. I rather mine fucking veldspar in tdsin home hole in a gila than  look at that unholy heretical discord server again.** **like fucking holy shit what the fuck michael, purge that thrash asap.**  C4 corps implanted their spudbrain furry shit on C5 space to kill corps  from within. lazerhawks can still be saved from this heresy, once they  are purged by fire from glorious, honorable, weeb/furry free C2&lt;NS/C5  masterrace corps. The rest of the non-infected wormhole pvp corps (  except wolf rayet corps/ duralexx/ holesale/ hole control/ pancake bs  users) need to group up and evict and burn this thrash from wormhole  space. If  some furry  c4 wormholer starts throwing buzzwords like “we  are wormholers too” and “what have we done wrong”, feel free to ignore  them and evict them at  will. The general rule is if you normalize the  extermination of  c4, the wh bushido law will have no choice but to  follow suit.

How did you word it? Last time I died my PC frooze, I sent a ticket with the event viewer logs and everything and told me it was an issue with my end so they would not refund the abyss ship + pod.

Does anyone know what was said in this meeting?
---
You can get banned for blueballing. He who brings the most feroxes deserves feeds no matter what.
---
Paging endie to confirm this
---
You pretty much cannot do what you'd like to, on this front. Every second you have another char sitting in a ship waiting to protect your mining / ratting ship, is a second that character could be in another mining / ratting ship. Having a second character making money will essentially always, on balance, leave you much better off than protecting one ship.
---
So the solution is to not give a shit about dying and instead just boost the money you're making.
---
There was a clear yolo event at the end of the video, its just they were so fucking late to save the rorqs

They could evict the whole of GotG in noobships over a long weekend.

Code. is just basically a griefing alliance that harasses players in High Sec for fun. Just move to another system.

CCP is OK with this play style in High Sec so you just have to learn to live with it or stop playing Eve. It's that simple.
---
Not really. The economy was far better back then. There wasn't the over supply of isk, and drops were actually worth money
---
No, once we formed enough shit that it was an acceptable level of risk, we jumped supers/titans.
---
That's the opposite of a YOLO.

I haven’t done it with abyss but I basically said “My power went out and I came back to my ship being dead. Any assistance would be appreciated  “

I'm saying this as a dude who Krabs with droneboats, while it's frustrating emotionally I objectively don't REALLY mind hunters scanning me down, and adding the chance they could wreck my DPS is exhilirating (sp, phones being a bitch). Ditto if I'm the hunter, myself.
---
The biggest problem with rorqs as fight bait is their ability to be a hugely tanky in-cyno for as many FAX/supers/titans as you want, so naturally that's what people respond with.  If you gave people incentive to respond with subs instead (like, say, capitals being bad at killing subs), it could still work.
---
Also, the PANIC nerf gives you less time to form, but unless it's a solo Rorq tackled it still takes a decent amount of time to grind through the HP to force the PANIC and then kill them after.  We were on grid at least 20-25 minutes, and we hadn't even forced PANIC on the 2 rorqs that got saved.

---
🐱‍👓
---
did you see how many fuckin titans and supers they jumped in. use your noggin. Literally 2-4 faxes save all those rorquals. MAYBE you lose a fax. MAYBE. Each one of those rorqs is worth 2-3 faxes. There was enough undocked in l-5 to save those rorqs. 
---
TEST formed 100 battleships to go save a rorq that had already panicked - smart play, instead of forming mobile cruisers that could actually get on grid in time, they formed a big, slow counter. 
---
TEST formed a harpy fleet (lmfao) and supers to defend their allies in Immensea. Vily took the time to ping the whole coalition that their allies were retarded BEFORE the save. There was tons of time - Jenny alone tanked for like 3 minutes before panicking. TEST just fucking spaghettied, dude. And to think, TEST makes fun of green light/red light in frt and then just watches their allies feed while slinging shit from the sidelines.
---
Good AAR
---
Become a exotic dancer

&gt; once we formed enough shit that it was an acceptable level of risk

so you just let your allies die because your blob wasn't _quite_ big enough? woof. Imagine letting the allies you forced to move to Immensea to keep ADMs high die because you were scared that 40 titans wasn't enough.
---
Fit pls
---
&gt; They just created simple "AFK check".  
---
This will not work here. Back in the days of UO, EQ, etc. bots were simplistic. They were mainly just basic scripts that hooked into whatever was used for input and used logs or whatever form of feedback was available and you could often run into them while they were broken and malfunctioning and ended up doing some weird shit. Nowadays it is right down silly for a bot to not adjust and time their input to avoid any sort of AFK timer, and they can further randomize it and imitate what a player can do and make it into a series of inputs if needed with extreme ease.
---
Nah dude its 420 bot accounts each, so we're looking at a grand total of 6.9 million accounts coming over from Serenity.
---
Yeah, (All) was the one I most frequently used, setting for a single mod isn't a super common use case for me. Usually if I'm fitting ammo or scripts, I want to max out one stat (or else I'd leave it unscripted)

Something with smartbombs maybe? Like pick your t1 BS of choice and a full rack of large smartbombs

The only place in the game where you can get 1 vs 1 pvp is in Abyss space. You will need a cruiser, learn how to do tier 3 Abyss sites, complete them, and you will eventually get some gates into the PvP room at the end.
---
Why you need to get them so far away in order to disconnect them? Wouldn't they already be disconnected if they are outside of control range?
---
If your excuse for cherry picking is that you don't want to die or get ganked, then you are exploring wrong.

I mean, its highsec. The number of tactics to use are pretty limited. We actually lost a couple guys to Concord too, so some people learnt what not to do real quickly. Either way, I'm happy that my guys chose to fight. It really wasnt that much of a feed either. 
---
For example: If you take the structure out of the BR,  and look at the actual fleets fighting eachother, the isk war is closer.

I have no idea of the mechanics, but I do know drones can go some distance beyond control range (i.e. able to issue orders) and will still be flagged as drones in space.

I'm guessing there's some hard limit on the order of hundreds of km where that is no longer the case.
---
Oh, I'm speaking from experience from living in Querious for a couple of months.  It's dead a lot of times but you can get some interesting fights with the locals. (Especially if you give them a heads up to form up beforehand in something reasonable)

matters to what? to being good at pvp? no.

File a ticket, be nice on it. You will most likely not get your ship back since it was your internet and not CCP, but you can try, most that will happen is it will simply get denied.

yes, the return on investment is good. t3's and under can be "okay" but its much more rng dependent, you can blitz them faster so you get more "rolls" for the caches per hour, which means more chances of getting something like the small spec book (around 450m last i checked) the higher tier ones you get fewer rolls on the caches per hour, but the average value of each is higher so your income is more predictable.  
---
running t5 electricals I make on average 80-100 per filament, and they take me about 15 minutes each so somewhere around 350-400m/hr.  
---
I also buy my filaments for efficiency sake, and also use improved drugs for extra safety, so after expenses I clear somewhere around 280-300m/hr profit.  
---
so about the same as you could make super-ratting, for about half to 1/3rd the price tag, but you do need to pay attention or risk becoming an expensive loss-mail (I managed to loose about 20b worth of ships/pods in one week due to me being dumb) and the payout is in loot instead of isk so there is some extra logistics required before you actually get paid.
---
Wally, I've seen you in local last night and had the worst sleep after that. In a dream, Rote Kapelle icon graffiti was on every wall in my town, also for some reason it always smelled like trash. I knew that you were involved, but no idea particularly how.

NC isn't going to do anything about defending renters. None of the carebear slumlords do. They have an understanding that renters and renter space are nothing but deer in forests... and all of the blue-circle-jerk have full license to hunt in any of the other's forest. This has been the case for about 3-4 years now.
---
They have a fairly strict policy with abyssal losses that they do not reimburse unless it is an actual document-able bug.  
---
only abyssal loss I ever got reimbursed was a legitimate bug (ended up in a completely empty site, no rats etc, so the gate wouldn't activate) that came complete with a bug report and screenshots.  
---
power outages etc are almost always a "tough shit, you knew the risks going in"
---
Oooohhhhh, okay. Pandemic, virus, got it.

I sincerely always thought it was supposed to be some weird fucking octopus or something. Maybe a bean with limbs.
---
&gt;did you see how many fuckin titans and supers they jumped in.
---
I was one of them.
---
&gt;Literally 2-4 faxes save all those rorquals. 
---
K. So like it's impossible for FRT to escalate?  We can just safely assume whatever is on grid is all we have to deal with?
---
&gt;Each one of those rorqs is worth 2-3 faxes. 
---
These dudes straight up ignored Intel. They deserved to die.
---
&gt;TEST formed 100 battleships to go save a rorq that had already panicked - smart play, instead of forming mobile cruisers that could actually get on grid in time, they formed a big, slow counter. 
---
If this is about the Eso Rorq, we still would have saved him with BS, but mistakes were made.  He also deserved to die.
---
I get that you all wanted a fight, and wanted us to feed you something besides some legacy rorqs, but it just wasn't happening last night. 
---
I don't get what you're all worked up over.  You won. You killed a bunch of rorqs. What's the issue here?  We don't owe you a fight every time you open a Muninn fleet to everyone not in Test or Goons.
---
Basically, we've just accepted that the new patch means more rorqs are gonna die.  It is what it is.  There's no point trying to save them under some circumstances, and one of those circumstances is people ignoring Intel and staying core green when there are 200+ Muninns running around.
---
why leave the comfort of your own home though
---
And what about CCP Enis &amp; [GM Socket Closed](https://zkillboard.com/character/94025671/) that could have been used as authors, too?
---
Don't be dense.
---
If FRT counterforms, the number of sabres you had on grid was more then enough to hold us down while FRT mids, and in that case 40 titans is not enough.
---
You sure would love for us to do something dumb with our supers, wouldn't you?
---
And fuck yeah we'll let allies who were ignoring Intel die to not feed a bunch of supers.
---
CODE has an important role. They remind highsec players that nowhere is safe. Highsec is actually the most dangerous of places.

you strategically left out NC. entire renter empire along with several key alliances such as triumvirate, skill yourself and whatever is left of hardknocks + renters along with  volta, laserhawks and odins call. All of whom have answered panfams callls in the past and actively work together today. Also you imperium numbers are about 40k too high as goons have 33,862 http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Goonswarm_Federation with initiative as the second largest with just over 5k http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/The_Initiative.
---
Legacy has allied with panfam in the past and will ally again if the winds favor that route. Imperiums only intervention and alliance with legacy was during UALX which in a spectacular fashion test has to be outnumbered 4 to 1 before you even commited supers but because imperium came to shit on PL and friends they are somehow pets? 
---
Also test has a combined 17k member count http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Test_Alliance_Please_Ignore
---
and brave collective has 9k http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Brave_Collective with every other member of legacy having no more than 3k so where are you getting your numbers?
---
Also your numbers for panfam are very low, i assume youre apart of this group and its funny you think so little of it to portray it as weak. As the map stands, panfam has swung the majority with their workings with fraternity and its absorbtion of origin and most of the chinese goon corps as it was discovered that several were just spy fronts for frt and panfam.
---

---
Oh cool that's super helpful thank you. Running t3s I guess would likely be about 60m an hour I've heard it estimated at which sounds about right. 300m/hour is very good but then yeah as you say, easy to lose much more. Good once you're comfortable with it though

CCP should bring in a quit penalty like in CS:GO - you go alpha for a day if you blueball too many fights

This is the correct answer if you are in hostile space. If you are in blue space there are hidden costs (reputation, booting, lack of sites).

TEST told everybody to move their super umbrellas up to immensea.  BRAVE / REQ etc. had a super umbrella (abet one with a few holes) in Impass that is no longer there. 
---
If they were pinged that there was a fleet in range, then yea, kinda stupid, but really, when you move all your ratting / mining to a region that is always in range of a fleet (and Elo is on all the time in USTZ) then you should be used to it.

I guess Rote Kapelle has a different idea of "maturity" than I do when they list it as a corp requirement over on /r/evejobs.
---
There's nothing wrong with using a cargo scanner if you use it to save time and blow up the cans that are empty/carbon without bothering to play the hacking game.
---
That being said, like the poster below, I keep mine in my cargo and only fit it for ghost sites.
---
We are monsters ):
---
Hint: triple box t2 fit Hawks. T4s are pretty easy, and you still turn a good profit on 5s, but you'll die more.
---
&gt; What can I do for this not to happen again or at least the least amount possible? 
---
Move to out of the way system, do not base yourself in or near any of the major trade hubs or travel pipelines.
---
Beware of joining any corp. If you join a corp there is a good chance that it is or will be wardecced and you will lose a lot of ships to the wardec. For the beginning, just stay in your newbie neutral corp and just move somewhere else. Once you figure out how the game works a bit more then look for a corp to join.
---
&gt;you should be used to it.
---
"Be used to it" does not mean keep mining.
---
Forming against a fleet that big is not trivial.
---
Oh for sure, that's fair. Its something that null alliances and blocs need to have. With the way the current game mechanics are, structure bashes as this one in highsec rely on the F1 pilot. You cant use eleet PVP skills to bash a structure or defend it. I also don't expect a single AAR to sway the thoughts of a whole alliance one way or another, nor should anyone else here.   
---
That being said, Evictus has plenty of solid PVPers who excel in solo and small-gang. They also consistently steal unanchoring structures and caps left in towers, and are doing a pretty good job.
---
What the fuck title?
---
This reads like a u/Wallymarts post
---
&gt;As opposed to the instant intel you give when the site despawns? no thanks, I like my way.
---
What instant intel? If you are in the system with me i already know where you are, you are in the relic site. And a site respawning in the system i'm in says nothing about who despawned the previous site in another system.
---
&gt; I also completely skip data sites,
---
So do most people, but sites left with all the cans up raise no suspicion.
---
the spod must flow.  
---
anyways, i'm not sure what went on, if they ignored intel, they were afk, or they thought they could handle it.  Either way, it was like 150 muinns a few jumps out of staging?  they couldn't drop a handful of fauxes to save the rorqs?

I feel like i've learned an incredible amount in just a couple months. I also feel I've barely scratched the surface of that game and I like that there's a lot more to discover.
---
I've been a veteran of other games that ended up fubar at some degree (Guild Wars 1 notably) so I've already seen IG friends take the route of endless complaining on forums while afk'ing in the game while some others tried their best to keep it lively because they thought there was still something unique to the game that made it worth trying. I remember more fondly the latter than the former.
---
That doesn't make me blind to the facts either way.

my understanding was that on Serentiy it was join PIBC or be eradicated. Were you hard core PIBC or a member of convenience back there? Do you think many ex-PIBC already on Tranquillity will be in a rush to join back up?
---
all fear wally the autism
---
risk for Code is that they spend 6 hours looking for kills and don't find any because highsec people have smartened up and stopped carrying cargo that pays for the gank
---
highsec gankers are motivated by profit, stop giving them free money and they would die
---
Guy in my corp has been running these consistently for quite some time.
---
Blaster nemesis, sebo, 2 scrams. Great for exploration ceptors too
---
Make a fleet with your alt or a corpy etc and solo them in an af. Retri and hawk both good. Loot table is much better but will cost you 3 filaments a pop. Add a few bling modules and you can do 2s / 3s also.

---
what
---
the best PVPers affect sleepers
---
So lets get this straight.       
---
It will be FRT vs PIBC + Goons + Test          
---
NC will be third-party shooting PH showing on timers from time to time ... as you know they are blue             
---
Quite probably we will see 3-5  people from PL even camping gates to systems where the fight is happening.

Did i got this right ?
---
Welcome to Eve 2019
---
Fair enough.  Can relate.
---
&gt; they couldn't drop a handful of faxes to save the rorqs?
---
Personally, if someone had Intel for something like 20-30 minutes that there was a huge ass fleet out looking for rorqs, and they still insisted on staying core green, I wouldn't drop a Cormorant to save them.
---
Would it surprise you to know that only Evictus, RE and Pirat care???
---
So what is your recommendation? Because that's one of my reasons.
---
is 7959 the year that we are in if counted by chinese time mesurement?
---
that's a fucking ton of injectors...
---
Haha, stale memes are are stale. Get some new material ya washed up has been.

Hey! I don't let any one say bad word about hedliner - he is doing grate job!

---
You're welcome.
---
7975 its chinese chat software name is YY .chat channel
---
So you want to say that not only more people will show up against FRT, but also FRT will lose people changing sides ?
---
ACKSHUALLY it says (anti-BOT and RMT)[https://translate.google.com/#view=home&amp;op=translate&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%E5%8F%8D%E5%AF%BEBOT%E5%92%8CRMT]

This is the alliance they're going to use btw
---
What are you flying and where are you cherry picking? Low? Null?

PIBC = goons
---
Frat = bob
---

---
one-day supers is just one aspect of a bigger problem. If you can have super-skills in one day by inserting some dollars, you can have anything else for many less dollars. Now eve is just like any other f2p pay2win game, where you have those with money who can shortcut their way to anything and those who would rather not spend can play "classic eve" and slowboat grind and accrue SP.
---
And nobody plays anymore. Not only have numbers of actual players been steadily dwindling since f2p mode was announced, I think we can all agree that the numbers of alts and bots has skyrocketed.
---
I guess even if we got a recording we still dind't know that.
---
Armor Nighthawk.
---
Yet here you are!
---
Nope, renters are not really relevant since they won't form for you. But okay, adding BOT and WERMT would give another 10k, Imperium is still huge in comparison, and they are allied to the second largest coalition. 
---
&gt;along with several key alliances such as triumvirate, skill yourself and whatever is left of hardknocks + renters along with  volta, laserhawks and odins call
---
Lol. none of these alliances would help panfam as long as they don't get anything in return. Most of these groups live from hunting NC. renters. If you're going to put these groups on the northern side you need to add Snuff, QFC on Imperium and Provi on legacy which would give another 2k to the imperium and 6k to legacy. 
---
&gt;Also you imperium numbers are about 40k too high as goons have 33,862 [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Goonswarm\_Federation](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Goonswarm_Federation) with initiative as the second largest with just over 5k [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/The\_Initiative](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/The_Initiative).
---
Goons: 33000
---
Bastion: 3300
---
INIT: 5000
---
INIT Mercs: 1500
---
INIT Renters (You wanted renters added so here you go): 4000
---
TNT: 3500
---
LAWN: 1400
---
over 50k in total
---
plus random small shit: PBLRD, DUTCH, LUCK: around 1k together or something. 
---
&gt;Also test has a combined 17k member count [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Test\_Alliance\_Please\_Ignore](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Test_Alliance_Please_Ignore) and brave collective has 9k [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Brave\_Collective](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Brave_Collective) with every other member of legacy having no more than 3k so where are you getting your numbers?
---
TEST: 16000
---
REQ: 3000
---
BRAVE: 9700
---
R-R: 624
---
TIKLE: 712
---
DV: 523
---
TW: 1106
---
IOU: 3100
---
W4RP: 2100
---
36k in total 
---
Add KWG since you wanted renters: 1700
---
I was thinking of XIX and razor so that would have added another 5k but i guess they're off doing their own thing now. 
---
&gt;Also your numbers for panfam are very low, 
---
Not really.
---
PL: 2100
---
NC: 3600
---
HORDE: 19000
---
25k
---
As i said, adding renters would give them another 10k. So you can argue that Legacy vs Panfam would be a interesting fight, only problem is that won't happen without 400 goon titans deploying.
---
Someone hack some cloning stations
---
There is literally a huge ass fleet pretty much every day.  Kinda the downside of moving all your ratters and miners closer to the enemy.
---
It's always good to have options.

(some crashes redacted for opsec) All since Jan 1 of this year. Clearly you know better. I should risk 5B isk for each crash. I'd only have lost more than 100,000,000,000 isk just in the last 4 months. I could only have plexed 50 accounts for that amount. :)
---
I remember when your trash tier alliance first moved to branch, every system had similar named ishtar pilots farming 24/7 with perfect warpouts to POS's anytime neuts entered any system. Your entire garbage alliance is botters from leadership down.

Hello soyboy

It's illegal, you literally cannot do it

You get gas sites in C1-3's as well, but not usually the most valuable gas ones

I almost asked if you were retarded... Then I realized who the op was. Bless.
---
These posts really should be translated if you're going to post this stuff here. We want to know about these things but it isnt helpful if all we see is a bunch of Chinese characters and random words taken out of context.
---
It depends on how many, and what they’re fitting. Wardeccers fly like massive wimps, and the way I’d fly tornados like a massive wimp is fit a shield tank, warp stabs and be aligned to a safe, that way there’s very little chance you can catch them. If you do, they’ll be arty fit with BS guns, so a destroyer or fast cruiser could get under the guns pretty easily. Which leaves you with just the tackle frigates. I’d use maybe a caracal, because rlmls are good vs frigates, and it can go pretty fast.

They killed a Rorq in Eso. Some of the dudes in that fleet came from up North. It's a mobile doctrine that covers a lot of space fast.

The first task is to stand up and follow.

Is it necessary to force the regiment into the camp : we are dish cooking Union, not forced into

8K might be silly resolution but it's also a nice way to capture the scope of an Eve battle.
---
To provide an example, [consider this screen in 1080p](http://www.rooksandkings.com/Eve8k/frame1080.jpg). It's a fairly busy shot with a sea of wrecks, Titans and a nice planet in the background. 
---
Now consider that the 1080p image linked there [consists of only the white square shown here, in the full 8k battle scene](http://www.rooksandkings.com/Eve8k/fullscene8k.jpg). 
---
Metaphorically or aesthetically, there is still no bigger game than Eve.
---
Yup sounds like a rote statement

So one guy and a sperg force CCP onto their knees? Sure, buddy.

nothing wrong with the nighthawk

you can't change my mind

Can you put effort into shutting the fuck up please
---
Wow man, youre super intelligent aren't you? When it's called highsec literally meaning high security... I think there shouldn't be a ton of risk in the area. If that's too hard for you to understand then that's quite sad.
---
Thank you for the relentless development! Kudos!
---
How so?
---
&gt; youre super intelligent

I wouldn't go that far, but I'm certainly more intelligent than the r/the_donald regular who's claiming hisec has always been safe and still should be. Fuck off back to your cesspool.

Most underrated comment this side of Xmas.

CCP going to give it more drone bandwidth and 3% increased scan res lmbo
---
Since no killmail ever registered, you exploded to time &amp; space (boundary violation)
---
As you already found out, I've added option to switch the behavior. The reason to set "ctrl for all charges, no ctrl for selection" is that it's more friendly towards new users.
---
There're basically two scenarios: 1) load charge to all modules 2) load different scenarios to different modules. Second scenario is not too uncommon! Mixing scripts in tracking computers, doing 1 sensor booster with ECCM script and second one without script, loading different scripts in command bursts.
---
If i would've set default to "ctrl to set selection, no ctrl to set all" then 2nd scenario would be impossible to do (without doing strange module manipulations) unless you know about ctrl key modifier. While with current default value, both scenarios are equally and obviously supported even if you launched pyfa for the first time.
---
I understand that "ctrl to set selection, no ctrl to set all" is more convenient to power users, but i believe power users can find that option and change it.
---
Anything you do that'll get Concorded won't work. At the very least, there will be a window of vulnerability while you're getting blown up by Concord and they can reship faster. (And you bet your ass they'll be back during that window.) Others have suggested putting this pilot in another miner, which is a reasonable response. Here's two alternatives:
---
First, many highsec gankers don't bother to fit tackle. Friendly webs can let your miners escape faster than Concord arrives when targeted. Correctly tuned jams can break the lock of a ganker mid-gank, but you'll need correctly tuned jams and good lockspeed for this. A decent bumping ship with a good angle can bump a ganker out of their optimal range mid-gank, but I haven't tested this one. Your best bet is probably to field a boosting ship and slap a shield extension and/or shield harmonizing burst on it. Massively increase your miners' tank, and let the gankers fail to Concord while you laugh.

Plenary session on the evening of April 18, 7959 23:13 201 On April 18th, PlBC is the Justice League. All things are open and transparent. The most fearful thing is the vest. In the future, YY will continue to use YY as the primary task of communication tools.  Correct your mind, do your own thing, come up with your own qualities, do the right things, and improve the influence of Chinese.  Putting down the grudges, to the European service are brothers against BOT and RMTo to engage in bureaucracy.  The person first activities near the guitar, starting at the guitar will choose the block low security as the first step, the foothold may be self-repairing in the early stage. You now like to abuse yourself, playing the wolf to play the black soul, this is a good thing, we can go  The European service was abused in the early stage.  The common problem is that the future choice of a good husband and wife as an ally also needs to be considered.  There are two ways of language barrier: learning (xiao) foreign language, Chinese patch.  Language is not an obstacle, does it require the regiment to force the stationed: We will cook the alliance, and we will not force it to enter, but in the future we will focus on the European service, we will not throw the national service brothers (sincere face), the national service will do the territory compression, Netease will conduct the service once  Recruit new and help cultivate new anti-crime forces.  Sv chicken will always come to Europe to lead the team.  Executive Army Name: The Army of Mango Alliance 8: The Army of Mango Alliance (AOM) Why not continue PIBC?  Because it was squatted.

Gas sites are common in all classes; since Data and Relic sites are more popular, gas sites tend to go untouched. The ones found in C5-6 ave more valuable gas, but there's no difference in the quality of sites found in lower WH classes.
---
[This](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gas_Cloud_Mining) article on UNIwiki tells you everything you need to know about gas harvesting, both in Jspace and Kspace; while [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ew-27FWLQZ8y5kudmpUbM9SAbZma2WmDuOVuAoO-XNM/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet shows you a breakdown of all the relevant data for all the  gas sites in Jspace.
---
A few tips that aren't mentioned on either webpage are that you can survive the sleepers warping in to a Jspace gas site if you warp out as soon as they appear on your overview since it takes them a few seconds to start locking you, you can activate a regular cloaking device during warp (allowing you to "cloak warp" without a covops cloak as long as you decloak between warps), past LVL 2 the Gas Cloud Harvesting skill provides no further bonuses to huffing gas until it unlocks T2 harvesters at LVL5, and the Ordinary Perimeter Reservoir can be run in a Venture if you follow these instructions:
---
&gt; " warp a cloak ship or capsule into this site, bookmark the Fullerite-C72  cloud at the top of sentries, then warp your Venture to that bookmark  and start harvesting safely IF YOU KEEP STILL. for the sentries have  limited engagement range (100 km) and the C72 cloud is about 120 km far  from them. "
---
That one is the only one with sleepers on the site when you warp in; if you find a different type of site with sleepers already on-site, then it means someone else has already ninja harvested some of the gas, triggering sleepers to spawn.

I'm guessing you were flying a Retriever mining ship? The Retriever has no tank and it's a favorite target of CODE. People pick that ship because it has a big ore hold, but you need to fly a Procurer because it has specs and slots for a good tank. It's almost a right of passage to get ganked in a Retriever by CODE.

When a ship has a fleet hanger, like an orca and a bowhead, can a member of fleet "dock" in it and then if I as the pilot of the bowhead or orca can I warp to a location or use star Gates and they come with me?

don't be so angry that TEST is eating shit left and right.  Can't defend Eso and then hangs their allies out to dry.   
---
IF you claim to provide a super umbrella then be ready to use it.  TEST has gotten lazy and slow. 
---
And yea, you can always just dock up whenever there is a fleet out, but 1) that is a boring ass way to play the game and 2) why the fuck do you even have a super fleet a few jumps out if you aren't going to use it?

---
2)  It seems incredible to a noob, but with a bit of experience, making 50m isk per hour is quite reasonable, even low by some people's standards.  So, an hour's "work" will get you maybe 4 fitted Catalysts that you can go gank people with.  Some people may have PI passive income that is in the 20m/day range.
---
3)  The permit is half roleplaying and half scam.  Well, it's a complete scam, wrapped up in some roleplaying.  A permit will not save you, but it's a fun excuse to go around blowing people up enforcing "mining permits".
---
4)  CODE. is not highly regarded as PvPers, but that's kind of not the point of what they're doing.  It's a game, most of those guys have other alts that do other things, and they fill in downtime harassing highsec miners as CODE..  Some people have complete contempt for them.  I think they're kind of funny, but that wouldn't stop me from shooting them if the occasion arose.  They *may* have checked to see if you're new, but probably you were just there, and they were there, and so they shot you.  Not personal, I don't think they particularly target new players - anyone in a venture would be the same easy meat for 6 destroyers.  No skill or experience or fitting would save even a 15y EVE veteran.  You were just unlucky.
---
5)  You can flag CODE. (the corp/alliance) as red, so you can see at a glance if there are CODE. guys in system by watching local.  If CODE. is there, move elsewhere.  A more permanent fix is to join a null corp and move to null.  The money is better, and CODE. doesn't go into null.
---
6)  CODE. will not PvP with you.  They specifically pick on miners, so no amount of PvP skill will prevent CODE. from attacking your mining ship and killing it.  Not being in a mining ship will stop it for sure.  As for PvP itself, it's a bit rock-paper-scissors - there is a counter for most things, so you pick something you like, train/fit for it, and avoid the things that can kill that.  It's a more complex topic than you can get covered in a reddit post.
---
And another bold assumption is: 2000 in the meeting.  300 Frt members were there, also 50 PLA members from Goons, 100 audience from RR (GOTG), and maybe some other journalists and passerby.  So the real Mangos number was about 1400. If half will successfully immigrate to TQ, you get 700 men.
---
&gt; K. So like it's impossible for FRT to escalate? We can just safely assume whatever is on grid is all we have to deal with?
---
Vily is fucking praying for FRT to drop caps/supers in Immensea at 0300 you're a fuckin moron lmfao

You heard it here first, folks - TEST forces their allies into Immensea to protect them since Legacy is deployed for war, then just lets them die when they fuck up. TEST doesn't care about their allies. Never have, never will.

Now go out there and live the armor nighthawk dream
---
Yes, because they should pose a risk to other players yet have no risk associated to themselves. What a stupid fucking concept. Risk should be mutual. Nobody ever gave a shit about the ability to get ganked in High-Sec; people were annoyed at the fact they had no means to punch back because of shit mechanics and trolls that loved to exploit them.
---
C4 space is hell

This is why you are most likely not in charge of anything worth being in charge of. Literally everything you said was wrong except that we'd love for you to continue doing dumb shit with your supers

First you would have to have the mind as a rorqual pilot to light your cyno.
---
Naaaaah, it's Ibis

I would assume HAMs. A Nighthawk is likely to be better at face-tanking than kiting, so you might as well enjoy the short range DPS boost.
---
I live in provi bud... the opposite of high sec, I just think the words high security should mean pretty safe. Really not that hard to understand.

PIBC is against Bot or RMT.

Our first step is Jita. We will find a good low sec system as our first staging system.

SRP like we did on Chinese server will not be viable in short time.

We are ready to eat shit and maybe together as we just moved in. But we will fight back very soon.

It’s still discussing who are we gonna be blue to or hostile to.

Rorq saves are (1) not very fun and (2) strategicly bad. If you give the bad guys gee effs, they come back, and we would rather be fighting over something more important then a stationary mining ship.

---
I hear people asking questions like this a lot, and while this answer is a bit of a cop out, the best way to learn is to just go out and PvP with people. All the classroom-style PvP in the world doesn't do you any good when you land on grid in an actual fight and freeze up because you're not used to actually having something on the line.
---
FW space is great for it because you can run novices and stuff in frigs and learn about engagement profiles, range control, microing reps, etc.   
---
Granted, some people need to get a feel for the basics, stuff like that, but that can all be done in actual combat. Just my 0.02c, none of the good PvPers I've ever met have come from training classes.
---
It used have a small niche with being a relatively solid HML platform before the navy drake got a buff and has the same application with selectable damage and an actual decent midslot layout.
---
Sure, nighthawk tanks more, but DNI is cheaper, shoots farther, can fit mwd+mjd and tackle, selectable damage and its considerably faster.
---
I can understand the vulture being slow since its a rail sniper, but the nighthawk has no range bonuses. A T1 Raven is faster than it.
---
Also, caldari being the "shield race", its kind of insulting to only have 5 mids. When the claymore has 6 and the sleip also has 5. Yes, yes, they both have shield bonuses, but minmatar are not the "shield focused" race. 
---
Now is probably the time someone will say "but the nighthawk has the strongest passive regen in the game, hurr hurr". No one cares that actually wants to use it for things other than meme fits or neutproof wormhole tank. Its a command ship, it should be the equivalent of the damnation but for shield fleets. Maybe not quite as tanky, but could be a hell of a lot better than it is.
---
Needs a reasonable speed buff, more fitting, slot rebalance (with shield HP adjustment if needed) and most likely reworking the traits to be a better fleet ship instead of a tankier but worse in every other way DNI.
---
&gt; it's hard to tell how long that will last once they're actually in TQ.

About two hours before they realize they're surrounded by gibberish speaking barbarians who hate them and the old enemies are the only ones with a shared culture and who are also sieged by the barbarians.

Oh man look at all these people that are supposedly part of panfam.  We should really make them help us out more.
---
This whole fiasco illustrates perfectly a common problem in the gaming world...
---
Game companies issue bans with the basic statement "We say you did this, therefore you are banned.  We will provide no evidence, nor will we provide you an appeals process.  Thanks for the money though."
---
Game communities then adopt the position that everyone is guilty until proven innocent - and without evidence or appeals, there's no way for someone to prove themselves innocent.
---
The only reason this is getting any attention at all is because it happened to a prominent player in-game who happens to be quasi -prominent outside of the game as well.

Of course they're against botting and RMT. Much like the major alliances never based their industrial and financial power in botting, input broadcasting or a combination of both and have a strict anti-botting policy which they all enforce thoroughly.

Hisec bears are somehow still worse than the F1 monkeys in null. Congrats on being enough of a retard to reply to the same comment twice though, I'm sure it's me who's crying.

"DID THE HOLOCAUST REALLY HAPPEN? CCP FALCON INQUIRES"

holy shit this is amazing lmao

It was about the range and speed. At that tie Armor HACs had a very specific range they worked at and you had to also be at a specific range to hit them without losing your fleet.

---
Wormholes, you need scanning, for a probe launcher.
---
You will want Cloaking, Hacking and Data Analyzing modules also.
---
In general you should go to certificates and max out the following:
---
Core Spaceship Operation
---
Core Weapon Fitting
---
Navigation
---
Navigation Support
---
These help make ship fitting easier and let you fly ships better over all. I know those are alot of skills but just train them one at a time and work on leveling up those certs in between weapons and ships.
---
I wish I could upvote your eloquent words more than once.

I wonder how EvE would be today if PL and NC has chosen a different target than test.
---
From a test perspective:  the tribute war gave us confidence.  We knew we were fighting a battle we couldn't win, but we did quite a lot of damage to the Panfam invasion with our subcap fleets and held the line for some time.  
---
For an alliance that got "evicted" (we left before vale was under entosis, but panfam had the ability to drop supers at will all over vale) we held onto quite a lot of our members.  We had confidence that we could fight.  We also had quite a lot of experience.  that then showed in the invasion of the south and the huge discrepancy between the competency of Stainwagon and Test/CO2 fleets.
---
Those two back to back campaigns left Test with confidence that we can at least fight, not always win - but fight.  We all know fleet participation makes and breaks wars and test never lost that.  Would we have had that same confidence if we had been a Panfam pet in the north while they evicted someone else?  
---
On a related note of confidence:  one of the three biggest diplomatic wins For Test in the past few years was allowing Brave to crash on our couch after they got evicted from querious.  The feisty brave spirit served as the perfect meat shield, while test was able to (barely) beat back panfam attempts to invade Catch at that time.  This allowed Brave to grow without caps being dropped on them willy nilly while providing a great amount of small gang subcap pvp.
---
So I think its quite possible if NCPL had just left Test as a blue pet, neither Brave or test would be nearly as strong as they are today.
---
Thank you bro. That’s indeed the rest of the image.
---
If it's any consolation, the guy (Lowtax) has nothing to do with Eve at all and thinks we're all retarded.

---
It's a weird feeling when your own screenshot gets linked back to you. 
---
Yeah
---
Ok thanks but I actually meant something like "fighting in our home hole" not "defense" necessarily.   
---
What I wanted to know is how people handle moving kitey fleets through gates. I mean gates you can always crash back if you think you can't handle it I guess, but with wormholes you'll eventually get polarized. 
---
In short, my question : "How do you reliably jump a kitey fleet through a camped chokepoint like a wh or a gate"
---
What happened?
---
Lol. You’re famous 😂
---
This is bullshit, talk abut not giving a single fuck about people's plans (both the ones making this happen and all the participants).
---
Just when you think that CCP can't care less about EVE tournaments the assholes somehow manage to prove you wrong.
---
This is such an utter and horrible disappointment. It really sucks for all us teams that put in a ton of effort and hours, it sucks even more for Jin and the organizers. He poured his soul in it and they just don't seem to even care at all - there was even a twitter post from CCP up praising the schedule today - while it was already clear that it won't work out lmao. 
---
  It's not like we told them that having a week or so access to TD beforehand is not only for us to practice, but also for them to see that it works. I'm honestly really fucking mad and fed up with their shit - I had hopes for this after the AT cancelation, but CCP has absolutely no shame to just tell us 2 days before the first match that things won't work out. 
---
People took days of work on my team, I didn't drive home to see family for Easter, and I'm sure many more just got screwed over hardcore. 
---
  Fuck you CCP
---
Did they also wreck all the ATs before thunderdome became a thing?
---
Not when you use the ship for its intended purpose.
---
T3 cruisers being the exception since you dont need all of it.
---
You don't even need anither warm body, just right click on yourself in local and create fleet.
---
ok im sorry to say this but number 4 makes it seem as though this is a salt post.  
---
Ganking can be extremely profitable and these people often don't explicitly hunt down new players. This means that you were most likely just collateral damage in their game session.
---
Tbh test only jumped A-D on supers/titans (and people who ignored that call)/
---
shut up retard
---
[Wait, what?](https://i.imgur.com/eqKt8W2.png)
---
I mean I wont argue with you but most ships dont need past mastery 3-4 unless they've gone through and redid them.
---
Is there a way in EVEMon or another app like EVEMon to set it up for a corporation instead of a character? I want to see things like Corporation sell/buy orders, corporation contracts, corporation industry/science/reaction jobs.  Rather than having to flick through 10 different character tabs in EVEMon for individual information, I want a like a 'Corp' Tab that I can use to see the aggregate of what each character is doing with the corporation assets/jobs/contracts/etc.
---
No those were mainly wrecked by people cheating in them
---
There are no wormhole specific skills other than perhaps Astrometric skills  for scanning things like wormholes...You will probably want to switch to Omega for this...Join a group right away, then tailor your skill queue to the doctrines they fly...Don't be afraid to ask for help, groups are there to support members. In the meantime, I would focus on skilling up ALL beginner Navigation skills ie: Navigation , High Speed Maneuvering, Evasive Maneuvering etc  ALSO, Spaceship command V , Cloaking IV and the Engineering Skills like Powergrid  and Capacitor skills..You will also want to begin armor and shield skills...Once you have specific ships to aim for, it becomes easier to plan out a proper skill queue, specific weapons systems and racial ship training...Again, ask your corpies for help, and enjoy the game ;)

Half our team modified their plans with their families for this Easter just to be able to play at least one of the matches, you guys are clearly not alone in that regard.

I used to think CCPs actions could be explained by plain stupidity, but this starting to look a lot more like straight up malice.

Going outside is nice but recreating Notre Dame burning the spire with Welp squad is pretty fun atm too

I’m sorry it worked out like this everyone - I really hope we have something to bring you next weekend, I obviously cannot promise it at this point, but I will try my best to make whatever compromises we can with CCP in order to keep tournament play alive.
---
Code are just ganker with a ridiculous RP to make people react. Dont pay them mining permit and tank your ship (if you mine use a procurer with tank), dont react too, they like tears. Welcome to Eve :)

No evidently  PL is the elite fighting force of eve.  Not NC.

The 2000 online users are including many bystanders. Some of them even not PIBC-ers. The meeting is public and veryone can join that channel.

Heard you made ncdot restage 😂😂
---
I would say in general, fitting yourself into a niche role (and mastering it) as a newbro is easier than generalizing your skill set and trying to learn it all. So I would recommended going full mastery on roles you want to specialize in before moving on. Spending 15 days on a level 5 skill you use often is much better time spent than learning 50 skills you won't use for another year.

We can now only speculate what faction PIBC will fight in the future. The only thing we know is they will start in lowsec near Jita first.

lol what.

are we just pretending like random alliances are panfam now?   
---
Then i'm putting these guys [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/npc/The\_Scope](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/npc/The_Scope) on the imperium side, suddenly you have 321480 more members!!! wow!! I like this new logic very much
---
They actually told me that I could not get thunderdome access for tournaments and was not allowed to run tournaments on singularity because its for dev testing. The fact Jin'taan convinced them to support this as much as they have is nothing short of a miracle.
---
O C D M U C H ?
---
I've flown with multiple goons the last week, goons and nc. on the same side now?
---
Disclaimer: Wallymarts does not speak for the alliance and 85% of this post can be dismissed as the reddit equivlent of a drunk text
---
Nobody really expected this tournament to happen from the start, but CCP promised, and actually seemed to deliver. We had TD access, everything was looking good. Then suddenly it turns out the tool wasn't working at all. 
---
I know it isn't surprising from CCP, but still a huge disappointment.
---
then why am i a director, lmao.
---
All these people have horrible environmental awareness...Jesus.
---
(until the fucking 0.0 bears take them all...)
---
It still costs 3 filaments to open, and you get 3 times the reward.
---
3 times T1 reward is not phenomenal though. If you can run T4-5 in a cruiser, do that instead. One advantage of the T1 is that a socket closed is MUCH less expensive.
---
like who are you and why should i care.
---
in short no not really. this kind of depends on what you wan to get out of eve but all in all its advised to get out of hi sec as soon as you can.
---
" prohibited" isnt the right word. i would call it not recommended. reason being is that are are groups that live in hs that wardec large null corporations and wait around on trade undocks and gates near trade hubs for easy kills on people who arent paying attention or are in something fat and slow. and in a large null corp most of what you need will be in your staging system out in null. it comes to a point where you wont have to go yourself to hs to get things very often. and if you do you can just use an out of corp alt to get things out of the hubs.
---
my recommendation. go for it. if you dont like it leave and find a new corp. gl o7
---
I may be retarded no doubt but why is legacy not counted as Imperium forces if you include all those alliances as panfam forces?
---
Sparkatiz, your comment ID had a Happy Number in it!

 The Happy Number was 32, and your comment ID was el7c321.
---
and this person is ?
---
legacy is counted. The guy above me counted them in his estimates
---
I cant imagine how devastating this is to you my guy. The community stands with you and the tournaments scene even if CCP won't.
---
nice flair bait.
---
Totally agree with that.
---
 \^\^\^ This but in chinese.
---
What's funny is that the damnation, while having one of the strongest sub cap tanks in eve, still has a respectable amount of damage for its ship class. The nighthawk is just in a terrible position.

The worst part is that this was supposed to be a careful comeback for CCP and the tournament scene after hacking at it with a giant axe in the anouncement and cancellation a while back
---
This was their chance to show that they actually want to support alternatives  
---
A lot of people running teams now trusted CCP on it and signed up for this, cancelling plans, taking days off and putting a shit ton of hours into it just to be hit by this.. again...

random alliances? hmm you cant be this dumb. I shouldnt have to explain in this much detail how these groups work when your obviously apart of them.

It's a really shitty thing. If you can provide logs where your internet suddenly died them you should at least get something.
---
The only reasoning I can see why they wouldn't is if someone ended up in a hard room, couldn't beat it so they cut the internet off to abuse the system.

I've also lost ships in normal npc missions by losing internet connection while scrambled. Petitioned and gotten the tough shit response.

Reddit Wants to know my thoughts.

A very simple. I am sorry CCP. Here in this tourney you see the big names and backbone of the highest level of theory and time investing into your game. They showed up even after you bent them over with a Adrestra to the ass with the AT joke. They are here SELF RUN and with no real prizes to speak of, and you do this, in your attempt to make peace for how fucked up you treated the whole tourney community for the last few years. Guess it is us who are the idiots to keep trying. Something something definition of insanity.
---
you've got that backwards; reddit had the chomos, we called anderson cooper
---
Well, did not know about the promise, sad to hear!
---
In general to be useful any WH character needs to have all skills called "Astrometrics" at level IV, fly a Covert Operations Frigate (Helios for example, or an Astero) and fly it cloaked!

Thats pretty much it.

&gt; one of the three biggest diplomatic wins For Test in the past few years was allowing Brave to crash on our couch after they got evicted from querious

brave literally had a full year of living in fade in between querious and catch, and they were arguably in better shape in Fade when they weren't a fat krab ridden pseudo renter alliance

It's always interesting to me looking at languages. 
---
One thing I notice about Russian in particular. Is they tend to use words and concepts that point directly to common often rural objects.
---
Horse and plow, farm type words. To portray am idea or concept.
---
Where as English will invent an entirely new word. Or steal a word from another language or smash 2 words together to form an idea or concept.
---
Interesting considering English only has a alphabet of 26 letters where as Russian has 33.
---
Probably why people find English so difficult to learn.

I know. I mean, it's not like CCP themselves promoted this thing with a news item last week. Oh, wait...
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/ppsx0s/streamfleet-showdown-invitational
---
name all your ships "Tiananmen Square 1989" or get a 100 + man fleet to do the same or get mittens to rename the 1dq1 keepstar Tiananmen Square 1989
---
I assume it is because you cant enter a 3/10 with a Battlecruiser as the max ship size is cruisers
---
Wait, you can activate a non-covops cloak in warp? Was this a change, or has it always been like this and I'm dumb?
---
lol it's not a travesty to miss Easter with my family, I just postponed the visit for 2 weeks. Now I don't have anything to do really, so it would have been nice to go. 
---
  And those eve tournaments are a hobby, and more than just a game. I'm enjoying them enough to actually plan RL around it, and care enough to make this cancelation hurt. If you don't have a passionate hobby yourself, maybe go find one.

Set it to dark mode and its effectively vanilla reddit with nothing else.
---
I've tried every combination of settings. It appears to be memory related, when I have the in game memory usage window open I can see that each grid load adds to the total memory, and memory never seems to clear. The memory usage increases faster when using higher resolution textures, and can be prevented for up to about 30 system jumps by having the graphics set to potato mode. I've gone back and forth with technical support a few times, and now I just leave all of the wine settings on default. Once the 64 bit Window client is out, I will roll my own 64 bit wine client just to see what happens. But as of now, I just try to find a station to dock up in and restart my client every hour or 20 system jumps, whichever is first. That has greatly reduced the number of crashes that occur, and doesn't greatly affect my playstyle.
---
Oh wow.. Thats sad
---
You are sweet summer child. People who wanted pay to win did so before. By buying chars and pushing good chunks of cash into the game.
---
Na, t1/navy BCs are good. 
---
Command ships in general could use a going over though.
---
They havent been looked at in years, with no iteration on them even when t1/navy BCs got range role bonuses. Which is why the Ferox does 80% of what a vulture does.
---
yes, we even have logins, accounts, chars and corps hand made for us on TD. It seemed like they cared, just not enough :|

What? Why would they be against PvP? Korea is literally where eSports were born.
---

---
Oh god new reddit that explains it, if they ever enforce that it will be time to kick this 8 year old habit
---
Right. INGGUO BU ZHONGUO is my plea in my really bad pinyin.
---
/u/ccp_falcon Very sad to see that CCP aren't supporting the people that are trying to make this community a better place.
---
I don't think anyone is blaming you Jin, you did your best to keep people that likes this niche gameplay interested in the game... CCP just failed to do the bare minimum to allow you to do it.
---
I'm seriously thinking that next time we should just find a random system in Sisi and do it there; or some t1-only tourney on TQ or something that won't attract that much attention... idk, something with the least ammount of chances for CCP to fuck up.
---
I had fun
---
Idk man maybe this will finally convince CCP to hire him some help/let me sign on as a volunteer assistant. The security team gives every appearance of being criminally overworked most of the time as-is, this is just pushing them a seventh foot under.
---
You got it correct. Also guys responding to WWW are called Chip'n'Dales
---
Id love to know what Lord Mald does for his real life job.
---
I'm guessing lawyer. The voice says it.
---
So Panfam forces : 50k+ and Imperium forces 90k+ roughly?  Its not even close.  Even ignoring that Gotg is currently fighting with Imperium + Legacy in the North.
---
This is great. Russians are usually telling me to go fuck my mom or something but this is good too.
---
&gt; Myrmidon - mimra - an extremely boring woman
---
Accurate
---
What if they do not want a vaccination because it causes autism?
---
90k lol you havin a giggle
---
Gnosis is heavily limited in what sites it can run in highsec. Among combat signatures you're limiting yourself to 4/10 and the occasional 5/10 DED sites and about 1/3rd of the unrated sites.
---
Where are you getting 6k from?
---
When he started he was in a buzzard. "Now I fly an.."
---
There were some people in CCP who tried their best to get this to work, even Fozzie pitched in last minute on Wednesday in his own time, which was greatly appreciated. Unfortunately the tool needs significantly more work to be operational.
---
drone tracking  
---
+50 mbit bandwidth  
---
less prone to get sites stolen  
---
faster to warp around
---
you can just set to aggressive and deal 100% damage afk basically  
---
battlecruiser pve is 4 tryhards
---
Do it on live, like real Eve players...
---
Harassment is a no-no but extortion is fine.
---
So you cancel the AT and say you will support players in keeping some aspect of community tournament alive, then “forget” to give them the tournament tools. 
---
A real classic
---
Thank you Jay, very cool!
---
Is this bait?  Looks like bait...
---
Ok what's the number for Imperium + Legacy?
---
[that checks out](http://lh5.ggpht.com/jesskah/Rrat8_Xv7uI/AAAAAAAAApM/VFwviTauuF4/s400/IMG_4581.jpg)
---
agree - we had some good support - but one aspect needs a lot more work than anticipated.
---
In my experience clearing sites takes longer than actually finding them so I didn't care about sites I can't enter that much.
---
In before nc loses a super fleet because they don't know how to subcap
---
we were aware that many people had made plans around this - which is why as soon as we realized this may be an issue we made a quick judgement call. I hope that you and your team can make use of the time this weekend.
---
eeerm

Req and evictus
---
Yes, why would a microtransaction loving company that puts profit above game quality want to draw focus away from PVP and towards a simple PVE game? Kindly rent out some brain cells before your next comment.
---
based
---
Has to do with the profit/time factor. The cruiser sites are quicker and pay better on average. Additionally once you learn the tricks you can clear something like a Serpentis Narcotics Warehouse (3/10 DED) in about 15 minutes which can drop over 150m in BPC and Coreli A-type modules alone.
---
Never said anything about specialization. Just saying that most of the time mastery 3 is more than enough to be a damn good pilot in most cases. If I recall correctly some ships have skills in the mastery that are 100% not used. Admittedly I cant think of any off the top of my head I feel like jamming skills is a right idea. Once I get to my PC ill look and see because once apon a time the certificate system was a fucking mess they prertty much just renamed it to mastery.
---
Tengu for instance has gun skills in mastery does it not? But who really flys a blaster or rail tengu.. Like really.. Yes they exist but its like using a drone prophecy they exsist.. But are niche. 
---
 So if anything your telling him to max out his niche before he find anything else to do which will bore him to biomass.
---
The other day while roaming a russian told me he will make me prolapse.
---
Because the other game they produce has PvP in it? Because when you look at many of the most lucrative games in existence they are *exclusively* PvP? Because PvP is an incredibly strong driver of microtransactions in the hundreds of shitty korean MMOs?
---
Language mashups are strange and sometimes hilarious. Native English speaker here. I lived in Hong Kong for a few years. Native Cantonese speakers will try to approximate English pronunciation with Chinese words. Examples: 
---
"my favorite" becomes *Mai fei fat*. Literally this translates as "Selling flying Buddha".
---
English"fluke" meaning an unlikely happening becomes *Fu Luk*. Literally "not busy".
---
Context is everything.
---
rorqual multiboxing and being an F1 monkey is the true end game I guess
---
So what do you think about heavy drones, I mean are they marginally better or situational?
---
One last question, is there a good fitting would you suggest?
---
You mean more bots
---
eeeey
---
Fuck off Jay
---
Accessing Thunderdome is now CCP's version of the "Guess the POS password" game.
---
For once i agree with russian logic nice!
---
No i'm just a terrible casual eve player with poor social skills.
---
I wonder if he honestly believes what he's saying when he claims they'll be anti-botting/rmt or if it's preemptive damage control so they can later say "but look, we were against botting from the start !" when someone posts a screenshot of 30 PIBC miners dumping ore into space.
---
Heavy Drones are best at clearing large objects like structures and things like Battlecruisers and Battleships. I mainly use Hobgoblin IIs and switch to Federation Navy Ogres when I need them. There's several different fits people use. I prefer active armor but that's less popular.
---
Pick zero.
---
Is there a way for you to link them or export them somehow?
---
Says Big Eye cancer, i'm onto you.
---
I'm gonna send you a message with my in game name, message me there and I'll reply with the fit for both Vexor and VNI when I'm on next.
---
I think it might lay on the logic of a chinese man goin from communist china to capitalist USA to make a movie career ? The logic might fit dont know just guessin here

Half of the groups you mentioned harass nc. renters daily. 
---
the other half won't be on the same grid as horde.
---
damn dude didn't realize there was a line for being a "real" eve player
---
They'll be able to market their bullshit a lot more to the PVE focused bullshit they're trying to bring in by not having tournaments. This is why they pull unfounded bullshit out of their orifices and ignore promises to avoid having tournaments happen. You can bury your head in the sand, but Pearl Abyss is not a good thing for EVE.
---
Doing that now, thanks.
---
I think you are the one who needs some brain cells
---
You're joking, right? Legacy leadership would absolutely fucking LOVE a USTZ prime super brawl in range of all of their supers, and a mid away for Frt. The idea that you were scared of a counterdrop means either Legacy is a paper tiger or you're an idiot.
---
Please take your belittling somewhere else. 
---
Of course this was possible before, but it was a much more involved process than most players cared to undertake. Let's not pretend the issue of pay2win is the same as it was before skill injectors and alpha accounts. 
---
A newbie joining five years ago wasn't immediately told to fork over $20 and buy an account capable of flying a BS. Today, that's exactly what happens. Pay money and inject skills or wait months to join your friends. There is considerable pressure today to skill inject

[The Google Translate Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&amp;hl=en) is a godsend for stuff like this. DL the language packs you need and use the Camera function to translate anything you see IRL.

Also, before you travel, DL the language you need beforehand and you have no trouble with roaming charges or making sense which is shampoo and which conditioner.

You gotta draw a distinction between "pay2win" and "pay2skipthegrind". I agree it's probably a bad decision to allow one day old credit card super pilots, but if you think new players are just injecting themselves into supers are dominating the game, you would be wrong. 99% of "winning" EVE comes from knowledge, experience, and interpersonal relationships in my opinion. Sure, isk can get you into bigger and shinier ships, but you'll still die to just about anyone until you know exactly what you're doing.

Forget about your egos in serenity.

Anti-box and anti-RMT

Early members will mainly stay around Jita, will settle somewhere in low-sec to be begin with, won't reveal detail plan before director meetings.

Won't have SRP for a while.

You guys are masochist enjoying Darksouls and Sekiro, that's good, prepare same level of torture on TQ.

Haven't decided to stand one which side yet.
---
Migrate to TQ is only for volunteers, will put main focus on TQ but business on Serenity will go as normal.
---
TQ alliance name: The Army of Mango Alliance (AOM)
---
Exec corp name: The Army of Mango
---
Why not PIBC? Some asshole registered it already.
---
Didn't want the PIBC name anyways, our "business" is mainly robbery anways.
---
About PIBC in Serenity: we need more enemies, stop recruiting every newbs, let our enemies grow a bit, also we are going to shrink our territory a bit.

Now I'm no genius, but it seems important that, while WYF8 is in range of all of Legacy war staging, including 08-N, that Komodo died outside of 08-N super coverage. In fact, not only was it out of super coverage, it could only be reached direct from Detorid and Insmother. More to the point, 0500 gmt is 1pm Beijing time. 
---
So because a komodo died in the early afternoon CNTZ in late USTZ completely outside of Legacy cap coverage, TEST was afraid of dropping firmly in their prime TZ in their space?

PlBC is the Justice League, everything is open and transparent, the most fearless is the vest, and will continue to use YY as a communication tool in the future. The top priority is to gain a firm foothold. 
---
Correct your mind, do your own thing, come up with your own qualities, do the right things, and improve the influence of Chinese. Put down your grievances and go to Europe to be brothers. Against BOT and RMT. Do something about bureaucracy. The person first moves around the guitar, and the start will be selected near the guitar - block low security as the first step. 
---
In the early stage, you may make up for the damage yourself. You all like to abuse yourself now, playing only the wolf to play the black soul, this is a good thing, we can go to the European service and be abused in the early stage. It is a good husband and wife to have a common problem. 
---
The future choice of what forces as an ally also needs to be considered. There are two ways of language barrier: learning (xiao) foreign language, Chinese patch. Language is not an obstacle. Whether to ask the legion to force stationed: We are the cooking alliance, not forced to enter, but in the future, the focus is on the European service, will not throw the national service brothers (sincere face), the national service will do the territory compression, Netease will open a new recruit after the service To help cultivate new anti-crime forces. Sv chicken will always come to Europe to lead the team.

Does that classic view still have infinite scrolling and do that thing where rather than opening a page it just opens a frame on top so that you go back to your blank chrome page because you hit the back button?
---
Nestors, Eos, Leshaks, dreads
---
I understand your point. And at the same time after 15+ years of existing eve became extremely uneven landscape where someone had long over 100m sp and new players couldn’t join fleets because doctrine wouldn’t allow it. So they would jump around high sec, get pewned in lowsec or exits to 0.0 and then just drop cuz noone inside the game needs them. 
---
I understand your disappointment with ccps solution(quite selfish and profitable one) but eve demographics needs new blood before our kids are old enough to fly a scout from our second accounts;)
---
No, just get another rattlesnake
---
Every group of humans working in the same context will eventually develop their own jargon.
---
EVE terminology is its own jargon. The thing civilians will go: O_o, he said what now, about. And within that language a sub set will be developed by a specific demographic, turning the jargon into meta language of that jargon. Now even the cognoscenti won’t know what is meant within that context [as OP indicates].

A lot of people smirk at the idea because it’s ‘just a game’. I’m telling you: #EVEisreal.

Region locking isn't closing the gates.

Good to know, I just wanted info and it just happened that they were the ones that destroyed me.
---
Been like this since I started playing in 2017, no idea if this was a change or how they've always been. Covops cloaks are still better in every way since you move at full speed when using them, don't have to decloak to warp, and don't get a 40% debuff to scan resolution. However, regular cloaks do have the bonus that you can fit them to capital ships. If you warp in from outside Dscan range they won't see you until you  land, and there's nothing scarier than watching a carrier decloak.
---
neither is CCP lol

Carl would have boundary violated anyway, still sucks :(

HiSec is the most dangerous part of New Eden because most carebears don’t understand it belongs to James 315 and that they need to follow the Code. I do my best to teach newbies, returning newbie veterans, null ears and everyone else how to be better. We are here to help you.  
---
Buying a mining permit will not give you permission to break the Code, you still need to be Code compliant. Always follow the Code. Don’t be bad, try to be the best you can and send me 10m for a permit.  
---
I can honestly say that I have never ganked anyone that follows the Code, but I have seen many miners with void permits. That is always so sad to see. Proof:

Yea I am missing Easter and switched my weekend for on call at work for this. To finally fly live in a tournament after riding then pine 2 summers in a row for AT, and AG3 being cancelled when my team that I assembled was a top tier team, this was the small sliver of hope I was clinging to. Now I don't even know. 
---
Also, last year when they cancelled AG3 I had already packed up my rig bc it was the same weekend for deer opener, and lefse making at the family farm. I've been 💯 positive about ccp and the whole tournament thing. Defending CCP to a lot of people. This deja vu is quite concerning. 
---
Tbh I'm shocked I didn't even swear in all of that. I'm not mad... I'm legit sad.  Mostly for our community, and for Jintaan. Like a paying subscriber made more content in your game, and kept a spark alive for AT 2020 when everyone else is chanting "AT is DEAD"
---
 Yet CCP decides to just extinguished that small light of hope we all had. Thanks.
---
Please make meat my words CCP... tia.
---
Imagine not checking to see if they really are a genuine retard or just trolling. Sorry if I hurt a MAGAcel though.

OP should explain that word "toad" can be applied describe a very scrooge/grinch person, so the meaning behind it is more like "cyno-scrooge"

Every ship has a cuck stage. Nut up or stfu.

&gt;Where as English will invent an entirely new word. Or steal a word from another language or smash 2 words together to form an idea or concept.

That is very common in Russian too. Many simple nouns can be joined by a single open vowel to form composite words

It's not a well-known trick, I don't think there's been a single veteran I've told who hasn't gone "wait what?" after I brought it up. Once got into an argument over it with my FC during a fleet because he didn't believe I could warp in cloaked on top of the enemy fleet using a battleship to get us into optimal range.

Where did you get your crystal orb?

Your clear times are very slow.
---
During my proof of concept test I ran a few of the different types of sites, and then 15 hours worth of exclusively of t1 exotics because they tended to be the most efficient for the worm. Frigate sites pay out triple loot, it's about 10-15mil per run in raw junk. The worm can do 7-8 sites in an hour pretty comfortably, running 8 ish minutes depending on the spawns, with full site bs rooms sometimes taking as long as 14 and full site frig rooms sometimes being done within 4 or 5. Once you get a feel for the sites it gets much easier, there are not very many different spawns in t1s. BPCs, books, and other stuff bump up the isk/hr slightly, but getting a destroyer skillbook is the real dream.
---
It is very chance based. I had one instance where I ran 2 hours and barely hit 60mil average/hr, then got 2 destroyer books in a row for a quick 250mil. But despite that it's still quite good isk overall and for low cost/sp requirement. I will say that can be somewhat mentally taxing because you can't just afk it like you could running a vni, after a few hours you might find the averages dropping just due to fatigue. I tended to run them in 2 or 3 hours bursts per day.

No

"Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers" on russian TV was translated like "Chip and Dale rush to the rescue"

Right.... so when Yulai lost it's gate connections, Jita became the successor in the north due to its connection advantage. You're saying the same thing, I'm just omitting history from more than a decade ago because it's a new guy asking about *now*
---
R E S C U E R A N G E R S
---
This is also a very good observation!
---
We are the Borg. Resistance is futile 😎
---
the downside is, for RMTers to remain competitive they must compromise more accounts and/or expand their bot farms.
---
notice how plex keeps going up, and the complaints about the scale of botting seems to be going up at the same rate?
---
i don't think this is a coincidence.
---
I'm surprised at how many of these are... Not quite cognates but just whatever Russian word's pronunciation is a close approximation to the English name (Industrial/indus, Probe/probka, Tengu/tenga, etc.)
---
&gt; Jita became the successor in the north due to its connection advantage
---
No.  There are far better-connected systems.
---
It’s the slots and agents in the space of the most popular race that made it the hub.
---
It's like 3-4 per bil lmbo still cheaper

Goons agents are already infiltrated and ready I guess

Ummm ... we’ve already got goons (grrr) so, what’s a few thousand more?

To invest money in this will be a grave mistake \^\^

Gnosis is better after all the nerfing they’ve done to the vni, it’s even more useful in small gang PvP now too :) stick with the under rated fun ship dude

No.

so the other day im on my way to a bowl , a perfect way to test out my new cooking pot. The bowl in question was going to be a tad difficult so i decided to use some jars before leaving. I jump through a nut and quickly checked my pod scan. Corks are everywhere, probably from an ostrich or rug somewhere in the system. I better be careful. One thing that catches my attention is a shovel and it turns out its just beyond the slingshot im heading to. so i go through to say hi eve style. 
---
but of course, i should have known it was bait.
---
a fucking light bulb has me before i know whats going on. My balcony and bricks do me no good because i cant get past his turnips. In seconds i was an egg.
---
and to add insult to injury, I realized I had left a newly bought spruce in the lard.
---
but hey, thats eve for you,
---
Ah yeah for some reason I thought only evictus formed?
---
Perfect, thanks.
---
&gt; Didn’t want the PIBC name anyways
---
Oh god this is the best version of “didn’t want that anyway” ever
---
citadels was the beginning of the end
---
I hear you, but it's not just the nighthawk. None of the command ships have had any changes for 8 years. They are typically only used by groups that can't/won't use t3cs for links. Even the sleipnir has been benched now that the drekavac exists.
---
The nighthawk used to be borderline overpowered. But it had every strength it posessed ripped away and not replaced by anything. imo it's currently fighting the caracal navy issue and the widow for the "worst ship in the game" award.
---
I don't think Pearl Abyss is good news for the either, I just think that it's a weird take on a game whose sole method of marketing seems to be getting BBC articles written about the size of their PvP battles. Axing the tournaments still fits into that paradigm, they're small scale and the only people who remotely give a shit about them are already paying customers.
---
&gt; 5% bonus to Heavy Missile and Heavy Assault Missile explosion radius
---
Isn't this type of bonus supposed to buff hitting smaller/faster targets?
---
If that's the case, why not throw in a bonus to rapid lights, swap out the Command Ship ROF bonus to reload duration, buff the Racial BC damage bonus to 10% per level, and swap a low for a mid?
---
That makes it more suited for a shorter range tackle intercept whereas the Vulture would be longer range damage dealer (with its double hybrid optimal bonus).
---
Suck a blyat ?

The smacktalk is strong with this one.

Cost is a really bad balancing mechanism. You don't stop undesireable gameplay you just make it so that rich people can do it and everyone else gets frustrated with it.
---
I noticed that too. They adopt the first consonate. Did Eve not have russian localization at some point?
---
Wow thanks for this, my gf now knows what the hell I'm babbling on about.
---
The point is that FRT can form a non-trivial number of super caps in that TZ.
---
I mean, y'all had 200+ in fleet.  We couldn't form that on a rage ping.
---
Idk about afraid, but we certainly weren't just going to YOLO that shit.  Especially not to save a dumbass who couldn't be bothered to read Intel.
---
Would it be possible for someone to join a big null-sec bloc and still mainly play the markets?
---
Buy low, sell high. Ez
---
Tengu isn't an English name :P
---
"The Guitar" you mention is "Jita". It's hard to translate english words into chinese sometimes so we just go along with the sound. Just like chocolate in chinese is 巧克力. Sort of like loan words I suppose. Personally I still don't understand what the Chinese are saying when they're talking about certain ships sometimes because I've only ever played on Tranquility, but I'm learning
---
It sounds as if Russians were playing before Russian localization was complete so they picked the closest sounding word phonetically in Russian.
---
One exception is
---
&gt;Damage Control Unit - chemodan - a suitcase
---
Everyone used to call this the suitcase mod since before the redesign it was a suitcase with a red cross on it.  Oh and maybe
---
&gt;Barghest - skovoroda - frying pan
---
since everyone calls it a pancake anyway.
---
And so the end... begins...

Well make sure to check with you in the future regarding how we use our super fleet.
---
Seriously, all I'm getting from this entire thread is that you're crying because we didn't give you a fight.  We don't owe you a fight, and I don't give a fuck if you kill some dumbass rorqs or not.
---
We had 200 in fleet including PH, PL, and frat. You're completely misunderstanding the dynamics here. Vily could have saved most or all of those rorqs.  He chose not to.

No line, just log onto TRANQUILITY whenever you feel like.

I've got them training now that's for sure :P 
---
After some looking online, my DPS was \~120 which I think it's crazy low for those instances. Maybe I'll go back to running missions and wait for my skills to get better :)
---
The damaviks rep each other. Focus them down. The more die, the weaker their reps. You probably just need to train a bit which from your skills should only take a few hours for calm abyssals. Make sure you're fit with a web for doing darks, it makes it easier as the mobs velocity is just as boosted as yours in those zones.

---
This deserves more attention.
---
Yes, and that's exactly the reason.
---
Typical TEST point of view. You don't give a shit about your allies. You don't care that they just lost significant assets. You don't care that their line members feel like not only did Vily hang them out to dry, that he publicly shamed them first, waited until most of them were dead, then came in at the last second. You don't seem to give a shit that these people are doing all of the work of actually maintaining the empire TEST has been trying to build - to you, they're just useful idiots. 
---
You also completely misunderstand the logic behind dropping supers in this context. That bullshit about the komodo is the perfect example - this is that _exact_ parallel but if Frt had dropped in WYF8 they would have fed just like TEST did in 77s. TEST desperately wants frt to do something that stupid, and your assertion that Vily chose not to drop supers because of the risk is pants-on-head stupid. And to your allies, it appears (and it _is_ the case) that Vily chose not to save them when he could have.
---
But yeah, if all you take away from this is that I'm mad that we didn't fight your 40 titans with our 200 man fleet then thanks for more evidence that you're a garden-variety moron.
---
c5-c6 ratting in a dread
---
You killed some rorqs. You win. Why all the salt?
---
The biggest issue is unless you are playing that block's markets you will be very far away from any trade hub. Now, a market alt is easy enough to create, and I would be astounded if any group was against you having a market alt. If you want to do it on your main then corp participation may be a problem, but that depends on how much time you spend updating buy orders each day. Overall, it should pose no problem, but each group may have other things you are expected to do as well.
---
Fuck yeah. This is what I am expecting.
---
Just type in “buy isk” in google im sure plenty of sites show up
---
Im sure most of them are ran by CCP lmao
---
Lol, did I strike a nerve?
---
Thanks man, I'm sure we'll all find something else to do.
---
This is True!
---
We’ve already got goons (grrr), what’s a few more bots? 😂
---
&gt;So there is a bright side to 2b/500plex kill the bots
---
Not going to happen dude. 
---
All those botters have to do, Is transition to using Alpha accounts in VNI's that are using VM's and VPN's to mask themselves from the Single alpha login restrictions, Then run the bots for free every month...

You're a hero. Thank you!!!

What amazes me the most is the fact that russions have a word for “an extremely boring woman”

---
Maybe you missed the screenshot of 1900+ players on YY chat?
---
This isn't salt, I'm gloating you moron. 
---
That's why TEST is different. You don't care about the people in your alliance, much less your coalition. Must make them feel great to know if they fuck up that their alliance will publicly hang them out to dry. That's a way to instill loyalty in your pets.
---
So excited for this, them coming will shake things up and give us more to shoot at....
---
Sure, let me just snap a screenshot of my wallet for you.
---
No i was just making a joke about japanese
---
You have 3 options. First, form a fleet to challenge them enough that you aren't worth wardecking. you don't need a particularly scary comp, as they will often run fearing a trap even if there isn't one. You do need to put up a fight at a minimum at least. Second, you can move all your corps structures to a holding corp, so they can be wardecked but you can't. Finally, you can try harassing them enough on your own that you are to annoying to wardeck. This mostly involves sniping any soft targets they undock, such as frigates, then leaving before they can catch you. If you don't now what you are doing though this can just result in you feeding them, which will only encourage them further.
---
Very disappointing - when players are willing to do 99% of the work and all CCP have to do is give them access and make sure some tools work as they have for years before, and they fail to do even that.
---
This is really outdated. 2016 or so?

---
Both sides need to calm down, clear their heads and think. Then learn to share and cooperate. Im sure both alliances have something that they can offer each other and benefit from.
---
Because bcs are fat and slow and alot easier to catch. The vni is the undisputed king of low level pve.
---
They actually have the same drone dmg stats if your gal skill is at 5. It should at very least be at 4. And there's a drone tracking bonus on the vni that more than makes up for just having gal 4. On top of that the gnosis cannot throw a full flight of heavys(vni can) Which is huge drop in dps. And the vni has a way bigger drone bay.
---
You shouldn't be using turrets on a vni. It's a drone boat fit it appropriately.
---
Hp in hs especially is irrelevant. Very few things are going to break your tank as long as your fit is good.
---
Scanning. Also irrelevant. Your in hs most of them are super easy.
---
General rule of thumb in Eve is just because it's bigger doesn't mean it's better.

One of the most important lessons in this game is: "If you are undocked, you consent to PvP". So in a significant way, you are learning the game right now.

Welp... The Perimeter conflict is about to get real interesting.

It's like they are playing an entirely different Monopoly game to me.

my recommendation is to learn what to look for. there are a lot of early warning signs (mostly probes on d when your in a site) that can help you determine when to hack and when to gtfo. if you know what your doing you will never loose a ship in site.

Post your killmail so we could help out on what you are missing and probably then laugh at it

My understanding of "krab" was that it is a reference to something that Putin once said. The line was something along the lines of "i worked like a slave", but since the word for slave (рабыня or раб, "rab") is close to the word for crab (краб, "krab"), it became [a meme that he says he worked like a crab.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5K0sDW1RCc) Also, something along the lines of purely PVE players being so unskilled at the game that they must have claws for hands.

Oh, I never get killed. A few times it happens because of the perfect storm: some bomber after sitting there for two hours manages to decloak within 1,500m and there's just nothing I can do.

This is disingenuous, of course.  Rising PLEX has more to do with CCP reducing sales.  I'm just saying I doubt that a Chinese influx is an unmitigated good.
---
l just hope they am ready for the Tiananmen Square spam
---
No battlecruiser is damage bonused for RLML. BCs are focused at countering cruisers, they have no place countering frigates. Application bonus is great for countering cruisers with HAM/HML.
---
If you want to kill frigates, use the plethora of RLML ships already available. Or use destroyers/other frigs.
---
Having a ship bonused to kill another ship 3 classes lower than creates broken mechanics. See carrier's before nerf.

I hear that putting a potato on the spot where the vaccine goes in, it will suck out all of the bad things and leave the good.

Russian localization was done is 2007-2008 ish. It also was so unfitting to the already widely used jargon, as well as the English version, that it was recommended for a long time that new players switch their clients to English.
---
This looks promising.
---
who left out the candy, the kids are fighting again...
---
Pretty sure PIBC has had totalitarian control over the server for quite a long time now, and is the reason people started leaving Serenity.
---
Vaccines are the reason Wally is like this!
---
To be fair, some people like hunting bots
---
but I think they will give us some HOT! NEW! skins for a discount instead.
---
software is hard, and so is live video.
---
This is unfolding rather fast, honestly.
---
Is Serenity Getting left for dead? Is PIBC Leaving it due to lack of attention from CCP on updates, lack of content and ISK Inflation?

Seems a very solid and promising agenda

But I foresee many shitposts on this subreddit regarding this in the future

I've heard carriers referred to as "suitcases" as well, is that related or just because / when they were used to transport stuff?

I have 40$ in Google play credit. Is there a way to use it on Plex somehow through Steam or CCP?
---
i agree, we should outlaw pvp in general
---
Well, market pvp will be frowned upon,, but at least in Pandemic Horde you can make a decent profit just using the courier service to ship in modules and then resell them at a profit, or get an instawarp Sunesis and move them yourself.
---
With stolen credit cards
---
I own a lot of command ships.  Never actually been able to use one in combat though.  They are not worth the pricetag, and other than bursts that can go on the same cheaper T1 and faction hulls (that are considerably cheaper), they don't to anything special.
---
For the price, these ships should be beasts, it at least have a defined role to make them useful in niche situations.

Yes, from my limited knowledge the carriers are suitcases because that is how you move your stuff efficiently.

The classic would wanted a Low Sec nut into Stain.

Serenity isn't runned by CCP. It's not up to them to update or not. 
---
They are leaving because there is nothing left to do. Server is dead. PIBC is around 90% of the active players. The company than ran Serenity allowed botting so isk is basically worthless.
---
Looking forward to having more players on Tranquility!  This game is better with more people.
---
&gt; Will not become pet of any faction.

Actually getting a little excited if this becomes a reality. If thye bring in the numbers it would be exciting to see another big entity in null eventually.

Hahahaha this is fucking gold i feel of my chair....
---
this is a good post, thanks for translating and formatting it all nicely
---
Well 'coincidentally' there is a lot more botting and PLEX prices have gone up faster than ever before since that started happening.
---
Yes!  Serenity is dead, Mango is losing people everyday, so to survive, they have to immigrate.
---
What if serenity makes a comeback in the wake of the botting rmt devastation?
---
&gt;Firstly settle down in low sec close to Jita.
---
\o/ AU/RUTZ is about to be a lot more fun. Possible Lonetrek/Saranen area?
---
I believe there's a great sense of national pride among the chinese and that it's natural that they would cooperate on the global server
---
Hmmmm, I just posted today's kill link then you appeared!
---
well, how much does a single alpha VNI? 10million a tick?
---
Also, which sites do they do? a lot of sites were nerfed in respawn rate...
---
With lowering respawn rates and nerfing vni drones, it directly hit this income stream. I don't know how many accounts the setup of an RMTer can hold up, but I expect it to be limited. With the actions ccp undertakes atm, they impede exactly these income streams that are easily botable. And at some point, it will be so much effort, that there will be fewer RMT botters
---
That is really bad pinyin
---
i thought you were deployed to reddit
---
so TAMA?
---
You mom told you it's OK to lose and/or come in last place didn't she?  Tell her that history is written by 5he winners not the ones that tried the most.
---
I have to acknowledge that their experience on using super fleet is much more than us TQ players.
---
"Last time" it was PIBC *refugees*.
---
They dont really care. Everything is automated or close to it. They just add more accounts. Bots are CCP's fault.

---
Hmm, I wonder what system near Jita they will pick.
---
OH SHIT I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE
---
Thousands of chinese botters etc. Coming in and farming = increase plex price = it becomes cheaper to buy plex directly from ccp instead of rmt = more money for ccp = pearl abyss is happy with goodboi ccp
---
Sure, They have nerfed it and all, Its about 14 mil ticks, So 42 Mil per hour, And none of that has to go to sub costs either. 
---
Assume they are running 10 accounts, And then they are pulling in 378 mil an hour, Or 9.07 Bil every 24 hours.
---
Now, Yes respawn rates have been nerfed, However it can still stably provide for 3 VNI's per system. 
---
So, You go and rent 3 systems somewhere, And you are looking between 3 and 9 bil per month dependent on the sytems. (You are covering rental costs within 24h of ratting, Then any extra is pure profits
---
Just today in my farmhole, spawned the drifter, only warped myself. Rip rattle.

---
I mean yeah, it makes me slightly salty that you'll set here and tell me that we're supposed to try and save every stupid Rorq in Legacy when I know for a fact FRT had let rorqs who aren't reading pings die.
---
I'm not too cool to admit that.
---
Nika fc’s now?
---
Not onces chinabois come over and push plex price higher. Which ofc means buying from ccp will be cheaper than rmt and means rmt market is suddenly obsolete
---
Whew lad. 
---
Let me help you out here buddy. Racism presumes your race is superior to another race. Once you've made that presumption any discrimination, prejudice, or antagonism is considered racist.
---
Now, unfortunately, the vast majority of players from China run bots. And in order to play on TQ they will possibly need to use a VPN. This will further the bot problem and hurt the game. 
---
It wouldn't be fair to ban VPN users...but it would help the game not take on a large number of rule breaking botters. And it wouldn't be racist because ccp wouldn't be banning them because they feel their race is superior. They would be banning them because botters break the rules and a large swath of botters will be using vpn's.
---
I don't really care to share my opinion on the actual topic...you just needed to know that your use of the term racist is contextually and definitively wrong. 
---
One last example. 
---
If I correctly use a word and you incorrectly use a word...my antagonizing you for the misuse of that word, along with my feeling superiority to you is in fact not racist!
---
Hope this helped friend!

How is that at all relevant to this thread?

you gonna ally them then betray them so they fold into you?

sounds like a fresh strat
---
If it's not your space then the fact it doesn't immediately respawn in the constellation has a minimal effect, probably less than the time gained by cherry picking. If you're in a wormhole chain where you're not polluting your corpies' exploration, it has no negative effect on you at all.
---
It has no long term effect as the site will despawn after an hour or so anyway.

Rocket nemesis with navy and enduring scrams, enduring sebo (ECCM) and mwd, then hull bigger rigs and BCS/DCU in lows is my current fit. Obviously you can’t kill combat/explo asteros, but those are surprisingly rare.

That last method is what I’ve always done. Wait until they mwd towards a can, warp in at 10km, and decloak once within 9km of the explorer. Hasn’t failed me yet

it's cool though peeps Look at the other hand! drama with Brisc intensifying... no need to pay attention to the massive disappointment that the game is becoming.  
---
China market is after all the way of the future at CCP games.
---
He was talking about the wormhole generator upgrade.
---
Thats because of "podwarp-scan". Podwarp - close range area - from 150 km to 0.1 au. Usual command in the fleets - "sdelay buku na podwarpe" - make bookmark near object, in 0.1 au or close
---
&gt;If it's 3b for your ship+pod how much do you make an hour? I know investment for t4 and t5 is quite high buy profits must be high too right?I'm assuming t3 and below are very low profit wise
---
thing that pisses me off is that I was plenty comfortable. but not until a disconnect happened lol
---
That thought crossed my mind, too. TQ is only just now getting to the point where large titan battles are becoming more common, but Serenity seems to have been there for years.
---
you do you. but i personally cant see ''fun'' in shooting stationary targets that dont get defended or jumping in a bazillion supers in perfect safety and frag some subcaps...   actual fights are way more interesting...
---
It's not a zero sum game, the site respawns faster if you clear it.
---
The opposite effect will occur on liquid isk as the stranglehold is tightened on the economy. Faucets are being cut, Inflation being cut, drastically. The game doesn't do extraordinarily well regarding CPU usage and isn't written in favor of those who would use hundreds of clients. Furthermore the cheap subs were cut with increasing the sub prices in the countries where it was less expensive to sub.
---
There are so damned many deathblows to RMT in such short succession it is beyond reason. CCP is putting the ISK selling business back in their own hands. 
---
Supply cut, sub cost increased and you want someone to sub more accounts paying 3 times the overhead to farm the same isk and want prices to go down? At some point you're a lot better off farming bitcoins post bubble. It' hasn't been a good game to RMT with advents such as 50% off galaxy packs making the price per month basically the same as ISK black market $ per billion. That's where the game was with its 'huge' botting problem.
---
The botting issue will primarily revolve around players botting for themselves, not real money trades or sale in the short term. When these players quit, they may cash out at whatever rate they can acquire. Players cashing out is the only thing that will fight against the price increase of black market ISK. This one concept is the only factor that can make these prices drift into unprofitably low or negative margins as ISK can be sold, resold, resold ad nauseum if not completely consumed as players . 
---
Botting is not profitable. You need to steal accounts to sell isk at a profit.

Unfortunately this sub is full of insecure edge lords just like him. It's actually just kind of sad how pathetic a person would have to be to hate something so much with no real reason.
---
justice for pooh the bear!
---
Yes, due to jump range and the ship hanger they were great at moving all your shit about.
---
Fun fact about the damage control: It was once the singular most useless module in EvE as it added HP to modules. This was before heat and was meant for a feature that never came where you could target specific modules on a ship and damage/disable them. It was probably the most significant turn around for module usefulness in the game ever.
---
College was a long time ago
---
have you read their literature? :P
---
They're are a lot of factors that influence the PLEX spike. 
---
For starters, CCP went on a blitz of sales to pad their numbers before the Pearl Abyss deal, and the people who stocked up then are now running low or are totally out (I'm one of them). Also, there's a power struggle to control Perimeter that has jostled the markets in both directions at various times.
---
EVE is an empire building, resource gathering RTS now.
---
Perfect example of clickbait though, since there's not enough of that out there already.

All I need to know is what BPCs I need to be stocking up on to feed their massive botting, capitalism yo.

I would concur and also add that the kin bonus needs to be changed to flat damage
---
I want to see their lance squads in action. Could be great
---
Out of curiosity, what are you trying to say?
---
Vast majority runs bots. See? There is your racism. You make an accusation based upon their race. Just because some do it, does not mean all.
---
I understand that you are utterly clueless on what racism is or is not.  I will continue to call out your stupidity.
---
You are literally attempting to limit access to something based upon your presumed assumptions of their race. You would punish folk who have done nothing wrong based solely upon the fact that they are Chinese.
---
K. Then go buy some and fly them in provi and show me killmails.

Also fuck you.😁

lol you sound super disappointed the game isn't what you want it to be anymore.

That was mostly FRAT

I love the new triglavian ships but yeah, some balance needs to happen in addition to sexy new hulls being added

Who runs Serenity then? I thought CCP did and all update and stuff had to be approved through the government?

Used to be tiancity, think it has something to do with chinese laws. Easier for them to let a chinese compamy run it than do it themself
---
I just manually set a price for titans to 45b. Same with supers. They don't have market data, so you have to set those manually. Other than that, most stuff is picked up. At least everything of significance.

jeveassets is incredible useful for me, particularly for production stuff. You should give it another try.

what esport was there before the korean broodwar starleagues, osls, msls?
---
Considering the evidence of the server that is used by those who don't have access to TQ without proxy, we can come to the conclusion that rampant botting is going on by the MAJORITY of users. Also I don't have the link but if you have access to Google you can find the post by a Chinese gamer on the social standards of gaming. Looking at and accepting facts is not racist friend. 
---
I'm sorry if you don't like my definition of racism. It's only the actual literal definition of racism. Again with a quick Google search you can Google the actual definition. Do that first...then after you realize that it's not racist...and no one has mentioned racism....and ccp isn't racist if they were to do this because of the lack of feeling racially superior...then and only then will you be able to make an educated argument....but that argument won't have racism attached to it...because you will have learned what racism actual is...and you won't put it in your post because you will realize that you were wrong and didn't understand the meaning of racism. 
---
Sometimes definitions are hard...it's even harder if you don't look em up
---
&gt;They just add more accounts.
---
Why don’t they do that already? Is there an upper limit to what the average bitter can handle?
---
Yeh you probably want caldari cruiser 4 and Light missiles(rapid lights) or Heavy assault 4 as a minimum..
---
As a general rule you shouldnt be using anything in eve if you dont have the skill to 4.
---
So was it canceled or postpone? Because the link provided and the information the title and flair portray give two different statements.

---
Yep. Alot of us are.
---
Ok guy
---
i hope they will increase Plex prices otherwise they're useless
---
Can I use that copypasta for naming citadels to prevent PIBC/Other China from attacking it?
---
I suppose it depends on how you want to define "esports". The first known video gaming tournement was in 1972 at Stanford, about three years before the first Pong machines arrived in South Korea. If you only want to count direct PvP competition then Street Fighter takes the title for first.
---
True. Good should be removed from that statement. 
---
Either way, something is going to happen. Gonna go grab as much plex as I can afford before price skyrockets.
---
CPL? ESL? WGC? Any others I cannot remember. Some of these date back to 2005 and earlier.
---
Seems to be all good stuff, a major independent player certainly looks to be very interesting, and them looking to settle in lowsec near Jita in the near future means horde space should get even more interesting soonish. Looking forward for their arrival!

Ill be interested in seeing their Lancer Doomsday Squad in action.
---
I said and earlier. PGL and CPL both started in 1997.
---
Solution is to make titans easier to kill
---
The term lance squads is familiar in relation to serenity groups, are there any videos of them in action?
---
Nice feed
---
Fucking lost it at balkony.
---
I don't understand how you could think people are going to just believe Brisc just because he is the only one saying anything. The standard policy for CCP has been to release no information, that's why they ban people who release conversations with GMs.
---
The problem I'm talking about IS the explanation they gave, because it was basically nothing, and left room for all of those conspiracies to grow. And yes I am absolutely saying banning a high profile player that way would be immensely better, as is evidenced by all of the others they did exactly that with.
---
I’ve been studying Russian for a few years now and have been a little interested in joining a Russian-speaking corp just for practice.

i dont know how to use excel, but \[blacksmoke16\]([https://github.com/Blacksmoke16](https://github.com/Blacksmoke16)) writes a script to pull character and corporation data in \*google sheets\*, also provides a history endpoint which is a pita to work with without some programming knowledge (just a thing about how the esi works in general)
---
steve ronuken also has a \[script\]([https://github.com/fuzzysteve](https://github.com/fuzzysteve)) for pulling market data, really facilitates the whole process imo. it's compatible with evemarketer and i don't think it leaves any niche to be filled by other sites.

both have instructions to how to set them up afaik

You should join goons. They are masters of market manipulation and it isn't frown down upon as long as its not a scam or you are goonfucking your own mates.

---
ok, were they professionals with salaries, were the games televized? if ur referring to any random small lan as esports i don't think we're talking about the same thing
---
Random question -  Does playing on TQ from China require a VPN? Are these VPN's continually being shutdown by the government, like a game of wack-a-mole?  Is there ever fear that you'll lose half a fleet of dudes because a popular VPN service will stop working?
---
please stop making fun of me on my thread. It isnt nice
---
Wait they were talking about EVE and not just playing Mah jongg?
---
🧐
---
Do you have any retri fits that can solo t2 or t3?
---
CPL nor PGL were some random small LAN. PGL was created by TEN (remember them?) and headlined by AMD. Teams and players absolutely won money and prizes. Televised no, gaming wasnt accepted the way it is now, but these were serious events.
---
It costs like 3-4$ per bil there is no way its cheaper than RMT
---
but it's "Logic"hno !!!11
---
We are capsuleers. We are immortal! We can never die.

But how ever we can lose a ship and a pod🙄

That's a nice, big market PvPP you got there.

---
read this in my best russian accent. gold deserved sir. thank you.
---
Don't worry everyone and CCP is ok with it
---
idk, it was accepted in korea. bw matches were televized on actual tv long before streaming was a thing. that's what i'm saying, yea, u might find decent sized lans before that but these events went from lan parties/tournaments to "esports" precisely because of that kind of exposure and financial commitment which began with broodwar in korea.
---
Does this sound like a small time LAN to you?
---
"The AMD Professional Gamers League (PGL), founded around 1997, was one of the first professional computer gaming eSports leagues. The PGL was run by Total Entertainment Network and was sponsored by AMD[1] The first professional tournament they held was for StarCraft in September 1997.[2] The league was official unveiled at a press conference at Candlestick Park in San Francisco on November 3, 1997.[3] It was sponsored by Microsoft,[4] Nvidia,[5] and Levi Strauss &amp; Co..[6] The organization raised over $1.2mil USD in sponsorship money.[7]"
---
Mangos are fruits, and therefore lack knees.
---

---
I though the main problem they have is the suscription. You cannot  pay the suscription with Chineese currency so if you dont have access to euros/dolars your only option is PLEX
---
Correction: the leader's name should be more accurately translated into "Military White Bum" or "Military Poundcake"
---
I'd imagine that CCP Will insert word filters into the game which would mean that certain words will not be either seen or sent over to a chinese client.
---
That or CCP will probably develop something like that if they haven't, imagine being forcibly DC'd in a super fight after somene says that in local.

Would kill for a Chinese version of this list. Im so tired of being called a brush and fish while trying to steal RR and Frat supers. -.-

Why? CCP are not meant to allow them onto TQ in the 1st place as it breaks Chinese law.
---
I have your body from last night :P
---
I do find you have a weird preference of using many punctuations
---
Ya, ive done a ton of them (can post times per ship type per filament type), but some of the ships i use arent as efficient as a worm (i particularly enjoy Darks in a Garmur amd Exotics in a Jag). I do run Retri amd Worm as well though. 
---
Are you getting every chest (i gorget what they are called) or only thr main one. Ive noted the secondary are typically worth 1-200k and as such arent worth the slowdown... but i still get every chest typically for fun. 
---
Ill try blitzing some only getting main chest and see how it impacts time and isk.
---
It may have been accepted in Korea, I dont doubt that. but the point I was making is that esports didn't just start in Korea. Here in the US the wheels were turning even in the late 90s. It took events like CPL and PGL to get the ball rolling. Someone first needs to invent the wheel before you can build a car, thats all I mean.

Now Chinese EVE server licensed to Wang Yi Ltd.  This company also running World of Warcraft.

I think it's also the case because of anomaly names. It was hard to cooperate when some part of the fleet couldn't properly respond and comply on "Warp to the *anomaly name*".

Correct, you know many high school students and college students don't have Credit Card, and not all Chinese Debt Card are recognized by CCP. So how are you going to convince your parents you just want to use their Credit Card to subscribe 'a sci-fi TV show'?

All the trash talk from peeps is funny; the fight was had, all parties i'm sure had a blast, whether they lost a shiny ship or not.  Fun-fetti all around.  space ships are serious business yada yada.
---
I'm hardly defending CCP here, but the announcement says that it's *postponed* until they can get the tourney tool working - if not they'll run it anyway without it. So my understanding is that it'll still happen, just on the 27th...
---
Damn, you are bullying a poor panda who just began to learn English.
---
So... I have probably misunderstood then; what is the risk imposed on wardeccing/mercenary groups that is unfair? Because I was pretty damn sure that you were complaining about mercs/wardeccers having to anchor a structure in highsec to declare war.
---
Only piece of information that matters and the guy didn't share it. SMH.
---
This ^^ 
---
The players that have migrated from Serenity prior to this are already botting like crazy. I call bullshit.
---
Even if their intent is true, there's no way they can stop the several thousands of playera that are already used to botting as a way of life from doing it here.
---
you can solo it but as with WH alts am always good this is the best English guide l know to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2ZyIMnKUQg&amp;list=PLJhOyk0yh5YuWFZlzuh-0C8U5J6YT_pid
---
Technicly its not a CCP problem, its a problem for the chinese authorities to handle. Its not viable to block every VPN just to guarantee they cant access TQ for CCP
---
Nice that they're saying "no botting or RMT" I just wonder how hard they'll enforce it...
---
&gt; what is the risk imposed on wardeccing/mercenary groups that is unfair? 
---
currently nothing
---
&gt;Because I was pretty damn sure that you were complaining about mercs/wardeccers having to anchor a structure in highsec to declare war.
---
a pointless change that will change nothing, they'd gladly and easily anchor a 600m structure a week and let it die to continue the status quo

So what you're saying is, plex is going up.

With a site named 'lulz.com' I'm sure they're a professional independent news site that doesn't hype up stories with click bait articles and posts sources.
---
yeah, i told him. why'd they wipe it, it was pretty cool that we had access to it forever :(

shhhh dont tell ccp it would be to funny seeing the spam or having 100 man cane fleet all with names that DC them

that's the point nothing epic will ever happen again once 2000+ people who think botting is ok join the server.
---
Ouch
---
I'm not smart and it might not be workable, but maybe you could ask a large 0.0 group to throw up an astrahaus in a dead end system they own and bubble the gate to hell for the duration of the tourney. IDK; I just want to see the organizers succeed.
---
Lol how does this get downvoted?
---
where do you know where my desktop is?
---
How will they migrate here? How it will be resolved on technical level? Will they simply make new accounts on TQ? Or will they bring everything they own with them? Toons, items, ships ISK? Can some enlighten me on this matter?
---
I'm assuming earth
---
Fruity!
---
LOVE IT, welcome to all the players from Serenity, Most of us are happy to get more Eve players in the game so great news!

inflation is inevitable but at least it was under control before ccp let their irl economist go
