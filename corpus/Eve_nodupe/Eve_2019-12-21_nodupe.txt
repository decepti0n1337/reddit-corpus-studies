J-space moons are high sec moons, so r4s.

THIS. All of my this.

You think that steam offer is the better deal though? You get 750k less skill points but you get 7 days of omega + Skill and Damage Booster (Cerebral Accelerator)

This a good first step, I agree.

---
Maybe have belts spawn x per constellation, and a Moon's yield is heavily dependent on region.
---
God damn best callout I've seen in a while
---
I have like 15b on assets I don't want anymore... Maybe I should put up some sales in Catch
---
The removal of veldspar from asteroid belts will have some impact on the mineral balance, so prices of minerals should shift slightly to reflect relative rarity. nobody mines nullsec asteroid belts so removing spod there is irrelevant.
---
The anomaly size nerf hurts the isk-making potential of rorquals, which unlike mining barges need to reposition after every rock they mine. So smaller rocks = more moving = less time spent mining.
---
The only group with a high enough density of rorquals to have some stress on their organization of miners is probably goons, who have a shitton of rorqual miners in a relatively small space, system count wise, in delve. You may see more rorquals mining outside of the supercap umbrella, if not necessarily the capital umbrella. It might become easier to catch rorquals away from places they can safely PANIC as well, as they move systems more often.
---
Does matter a little since now you have to mine more chuff and wait around like a dunce.
---
And the other

Can we just like. Leave Provi alone for a year or two? I feel like CVA is suffering from over fishing.
---
Lasers are the best platform, because their engagement profile complements gang work, while still operating within the envelope of other engagement mechanics.  That's generally not true of rails or artillery until you scale up the number of participants.
---
Every now and then other weapon systems stumble into this capacity, like autocannons or blasters with null, but every laserboat does it natively.
---
yea pretty common in some sov space
---
as one of the only belt ratters that actually loot in eve, I consider this a buff :) no more getting stuck on veldspar....
---
Fuck yeah the great shake up of 2020 begins
---
with that kind of humor you'l fit right in.  Eve's player base is overwhelmingly male over the age of 30 (37 i think was the last average I saw?).  Lots of sophomoric humor.
---
A couple of us from Horde, including myself, did some testing.
---
Your isk/hr bottom isk/hr (over sieging, killing lots of rats, taking too long to position yourself on a rock, etc.) will be 70m/hr which is still what it was pre-anom changes. You're average isk per hour will be like 80m/hr, and if you're mining with a group of dudes and are consistently getting good ore, you top out at 90-100m/hr.
---
You will see increased APM after killing the spod, but it's nothing too bad. People are still doing 5-10 rorquals comfortably.
---
The thing with that is that all capitals and supercapitals are technically T1, which is why capital parts only require minerals. If they were going to include more parts, that would mean those ships get "upgraded" to T2 so that they require T2 parts made from moon goo. That stuff gets mined from asteroids like minerals do, but it then needs to be reacted a few times, and then blueprints would also need to undergo invention. Overall, the process would become more expensive, but it wouldn't actually time much more time than it does now.
---
Clone hunting is trawling low-sec belts, looking for "clone soldiers". Theyre relatively strong, and the ones in 0.1-0.2 sec drop tags worth 20-25mil each (check market).
---
Im not sure how much you'd make an hour, depends on luck, but theyre reasonably common.

Have a read

Veteran here, what's the outlook on returning? I'm the t3 cloaky solo kind of pilot and my corp folded so I've got options.

Yes.

Same old thing. Just bots killing bots.

That's interesting. CCP has been talking a lot about the choice they made to name the skills "Precursor xyz"

I once knew a guy who didn't undock because he flew a retriever and didn't want to risk his billion-isk implants to a highsec gank because it didn't have enough tank. and he told me he wouldn't use a procurer because the retriever mined better.

Yea as many said here before, much peeps to hangout with. Hit me up if your up for a mission run or roam

You should only appear in local after the session change timer or breaking gate cloak.

Classy as always.

sorry page 16 article 6 part C of TEST Ratting Accords, authored by dran himself (hallowed be thy name), say that TEST bots require a signed confession before they can be commissared

so please check yourself before you claim test doesn’t keep the game active and alive

Cool and awesome. Highfives and chestbumps all around. Elite PVPing a bunch of farmers.

I belive the military still uses dragon for naming companies, but im not sure.
---
I'm happy you didn't delete this because it's actually quite insightful.
---
&gt; if you don't consider it a nerf, you are holding an opinion that roughly 0% of the eve population agrees with.
---
Prove it.
---
Cheer up fella.
---
It is, and there shouldn't be similar ISK printers in HS either.
---
But conduits don't print a lot of ISK, they mostly drop Triglavian materials, right? So their market value is set by supply and demand.
---
If you dock up at a station, and on the bar on the left (called the neocom), you'll find a button that looks like a graph. 
---
Click on that and it will open a page with drop down menus on the side with everything you can buy (if the station has it available).
---
For your electron blaster you will probably want to buy some "Antimatter S". You can put that in the search bar to immediately see if there's some available at that station.
---
If you have to buy it, trade hubs are where it's at. Jita is the biggest. Amarr is 2nd biggest. Then there's a few smaller ones around. Your market view is limited to the current region you're in.
---
Try joining **Rookie** channel and **Help** channel in game for these sorts of questions. Quicker than waiting for a Reddit response.
---
Why bother planning incremental changes when everyone is going to post as if each change is the only one being made? 
---
CCP should just remove all the ore at once, and incrementally add it back. At least that might get people's attention long enough to realize there are more changes coming.
---
Sooooo it will be more efficient to mine high-end ores in nullsec as the quantity of cheap stuff is reduced?
---
They have some moon goo, but only low grade stuff.
---
&gt; ^ This. You make as much isk as Null sec subcap ratting in safe high sec.
---
High sec is safe now? Since when? 
---
High sec is full of neutrals that you have no idea whether they are hunting you or not. Null sec is far safer.
---
Think they looked arguably better than before. Would like before and after pictures to really compare tho

There have been thousands of these questions asked on this sub, you can search it easily on reddit and googling.

How?!

Hey you got unbanned!

Good luck I know several people that control the ice market by mining 24/7... They'll just crash it once everybody jumps into it.

Two questions:

Has anyone noticed AFK characters being auto disconnected after a time?
---
Are there methods to hunt a cloaky camper?
---
When that chinese multiboxer logs in Stain population increases by 50%, wohoo!

I kinda like the region being desolate, when in mood for pew can always use a jump clone or wormholes. But I'm 80% carebear. For someone focused mostly on pvp Stain is bad.

Love how you selectively decide not to include the admittedly light but still present shittalk and arrogant stance he had in the post. Or maybe you just didn't read it? Propbably not hm? ;)

\^ Seriously this.

Korean traditional suicide roaming lol
---
Yeah, they tried to make EVE a phone game and failed so far.
---
Did it last week, so yes, the cans are only locked if there are Battleship sleepers on grid, so most of the easier ones in C1-C3 are still hackable. And obviously if there are sentry towers, bail, you can't kite those away.
---
Posting is on par with FCing.
---
There is spod.
---
You love that eh? I don't think that was honest.
---
Don’t worry, I talk to my alts in local for company too
---
You can, it is a very silly thing to do though. 
---
PANIC module needs a rock to be locked to be activated. If you are blue scouted, it will be a pretty easy kill.
---
Wait for the rock to deplete, covert cyno 30 lokis. Instead of 7 minutes leeway to get saved, you will have one or two minutes leway to get saved.

Good ole Jack Carrigan 👍🏻

It is "Yin-Tan" technically, although everyone just calls him jhin and it's way too common for him to correct it.

Planning some boogeyman style raids on small (similar sized) wormhole groups. Finding targets and leaving scan alts.

It sounded like everyone was red except in the FCs minds. "Don't shoot Homer! DON'T SHOOT HOMER SIMPSON!!!"

Some Asians and Russians are bad for eve. I assume some of them are good people.
---
It is worth it to get into, provided you do the following:
---
1) Do your research. Read up on the Uni Wiki for mechanics and learning what ships do, download Pyfa (a third-party tool) so you can theorycraft fits for ships. The more you read, the easier it is to get into. Corps love newbies who've done their reading.
---
2) Ignore r/eve. I browse it for game-related news and for dank memes, but there's an incredible amount of salt here as well, and it *will* demotivate you if you pay too much attention to it.
---
3) Always have a goal. This game is purely about intrinsic motivation, not extrinsic. Completing the tutorial agents are a good start.
---
4) Join a corp. Despite all the public imagery of backstabbing, cutthroat sociopathy, this is still a social game built on cooperation. Some of the nicest and most interesting people I know are those I've met through EVE. Everything is better with friends.
---
After everything Panfam has done to Brave. I still can’t believe legacy is willing to fly along side with them 🤮

We left because we where eating shit lol

I do that too, they ignore me though

Lol, that was the nicest insult I've ever gotten thanks.

You run emerging conduits. They have been added recently-ish. You can solo them or do them with friends or a secomd char. Just join the "Emerging Lurkers" channel und chose a fit that you like. Some of the fits went a bit in price over time though. If you need help to make your budget work, just pm me
---
[Doubt]

I was hoping you'd correct me if I was wrong since math interests me. Are you saying that you can derive an expression for 3D objects using only double integrals?

FRT dropping on easy targets, color me shocked

Where did he throw stones?
---
Nope
---
We’ve seen it with BLOPs BS jumping as well. Which sucks for burning to your bridge when it comes in to reset at a mid.
---
Actually hisec conduits is better than alot of hisec subcaps ratting in isk/hr.

Lady and gentleman's its done. Now we can see how to born "blue donut's" and how work "gay diplomacy".

Applause  and congratulations to the all who work day and night for made this day is real. APPLAUSE !!!🍾

We've been noticing the range but figured ccp put in the cyno change they were talking about (more things jumping = further from cyno) and didn't patch note it. Didn't notice that you also come in cloaked.
---
never underestimate the crying and whinging ability of an EVE player.
---
I do a little bit of everything. My main toon has 100,000,000 SP so there isn’t much he can’t do. I love doing PI and have perfect PI skills on all my toons. I also run a lot of missions when I want something shiny from the LP store.  Then there is the Various industry shizz I do like mining and manufacturing pvp ships for my alliance.
---
I thought you were gonna get me lmao
---
It's my first alliance so at first I thought... yeah I guess null alliances need a lot of participation. I then slowly realized how toxic the whole thing was. And now you guys just confirmed it for me. 
---
I never spent a penny on skill injectors. I just quit the game when it became too much. I don't want to log in. 
---
It's because I don't know where to go. Before, when I played solo, I used to like day tripping in wormholes, you know, scanning, doing a bunch of different stuff. The sites look more engaging than those in null. Could you guys suggest fun group(s) I could apply to? I expect to have to pull my weight, of course.
---
I was pissed that second time when the canes and harpy bridged in. Thought we had it.
---
These are amazing!!!! I think a fun and challenging group of ships for him to try could be the Sisters of Eve ships. The Nestor, Stratios, and Aestor.
---
This isn't even a shitpost. It's just a shit post.
---
Yeah I appreciate you were responding to an incendiary comment but your reply sounded like you were complaining about being blobbed.
---
I appreciate sometimes being blobbed is a legitimate defence but it doesn’t really work if you’re the attacking party since you always have the option to disengage.
---
We know it's a troll. It's just a really, really bad one.
