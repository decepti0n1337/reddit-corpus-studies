Why would anyone use marauder for heavy tackle if Rorqual insures better, has better range, fatigue reduction and can perform same role with heavy scrams while also providing heavy neut pressure and links?
---
Cry? No. Kill yourself? Yes, that is preferable.

Yeah, that is my point.

It is has been years since Rens was a legit market hub.

Yes! Also: it would be good if profiles were optionally dependent on the group launched. Eg if you want group 1 to be a full screen 4k client and a second account on another fullscreen and group 2 to be the same 2 accounts + some others, all windowed on one screen.

Reminds me of the copy of Blue Meridian I bought a while back that showed up with (Ironically) water damage. Was also listed in 'good' condition.

This game is damn gorgeous but is so demanding knowledge-wise... what activities would you all suggest are great (besides mining) that don’t require significant time/energy investments for a guy with a newborn? 
---
Proteus is great of you know you can isolate your target and kill it within blaster range. It has face melting damage. 
---
It will do worse if 1 more ship comes on the scene if you cant kill the target and escape in a 30 seconds (which it can do).
---
Did anyone actually ask for asset safety? I feel this was brought into the game but no one asked for this.
---
You could (and should) use a market utility like evemarketer or evepraisal because exploration loot has a high variability in value. 
---
Datacores tend to be low value, relic site salvage tends to be a fair more, and rarer sites like Ghost Sites will drop implant blueprints that may be worth billions. 
---
Tell your friends.
---
I understand. A marauder with a cyno inhib doesn't fix the issue with capitals. It does provide more tools, which i'm fine with. But at this point, we need to stop dancing around the subject with "tools" and just fix the inherent issues with capitals. Or at least start, even if its baby steps.
---
I'm tired of waiting for a Dev Blog or release of the next balance passes for any ship. CCP is moving a glacial pace and the eveonline updates website shows nothing of interest for the next year. Just a very vague "we're going to be rebalancing things in winter". No date, no details on what is being rebalanced, its just discouraging to be dealing with the same meta for 3 years and no word or anything interesting from CCP when its starting to reach critical mass.
---
 The carebears won.
---
Joe Flanigan brought such an understated and sardonic command style. Not an anti-hero like Firefly's Mal,  but battle tested nonetheless. SG1's Richard Dean Anderson was sarcastic, but not dark. 
---
I also liked what they did with the ally and enemy relationships. They got into origin stories and scienced them rather than adding more mysteries like more aliens. Overall SGA just seemed to have fresher writing.
---
&gt; I would like to add something. To me it seems that there are not enough ways in the game to actively "inturrapt" a cyno. That is a large chunk of what is missing in the current cyno mechanics.
---
One of key aspects (and drawbacks) of a cyno is that the second it goes up, it stays up until it cycles down after set time or when the ship dies while keeping said ship immobilized. Having a way to reliably interrupt cyno could allow anyone randomly doing stuff in caps/cruisers to - when threatened - light cyno, bring whatever you need to immediately save said ship (like ECM, booshers etc.), force decycle cyno on your ship and warp/jump off. It adds even more safety to caps/supers in one of few remaining situations they're still at actual danger. And what if someone uses that "force decycle" on a dictor/ceptor that was about to bring in dreads to kill a super? If I was Rorqual mining, I'd keep a ship with "cyno decycle" ready to go nearby just in case someone tries to drop me.
---
On the other hand, adding some limitations and restrictions to when you light a cyno that allow messing things up and getting killed without any hope for help would be fun. Like, I'd love to see NSA disabling - while active - lighting a cyno, so if carrier/super tries to clear tackle they have to either suffer huge lock times or take a risk of not getting help; same goes for full doomsday timer (for those boson ratting titans). Basically - any situation you wouldn't be able to tether outside having active weapons timer, you can't light a cyno. As for PANIC - it would be nice if PANIC got into same active module restriction as cyno and covert cyno - meaning that if one is active, other can't be activated. That way it's choice between bringing help or getting yourself safe, and - depending on choice - can be properly abused while still allowing for some ways around that.
---
Only &lt;2009ers understand o7

Delete abyss altogether, stop the instanced menace, go back to sandbox, fix this problem first, then fix lowsex, and then maybe the cap “problems“
---
I think it is just a balance issue. 
---
Following.
---
Smartbombs can kill missiles mid flight. Its clunky, but do-able.
---
Its mainly a balance thing i'd say. You can still missile disrupt ships, which can really cripple missile ships. It gives the missile ship some counterplay (webs, crash booster, missile comps/enhancers etc). If you just have something that shoots missiles down easily, there isn't really anything a missile ship can do to counter that. Plus would get abused hard in fleets.
---
still gets delivered to perunga
---
Make Capital sized cynos, and every cyno lit in a certain area around capitals jump in reinforcements scattered in a large area around the grid. 
---
Who?
---
Maybe you could honorably agree which one takes the hit and die so you don't both lose your ship. 
---
That was a great shot!
---
Gf!
---
In before the space lawyers 
---
&gt;he changes proposed are almost always terrible, self-serving, and myopic to a fault.
---
Fucking preach brother!!!

&gt;Also, fuck you. Wanting to krab is a valid gameplay choice
---
I am so tired of these Nano Jockeys continually refusing to play the game in its entirety. Berating those aspects they don't want to access and then complaining and PlsCCPing thier asses off about Rorqual nerfs,  "its too hard to kill shit", local and other bullshit.
---
These are the same mongs that want the game to be nothing more than a killboard generator. Come on guys just accept that everyone can play their own game even you.
---
The player base is always revolving.  ;)
---
She keeps the body in the closet and only brings it our on holidays.
---
They still do? Have heard of that, but never actually seen it happen. But talking lore, it just seems odd for the different factions to not do it. We technically already have it on citadels (isn't one of their systems called point defense or something?), and it would be interesting to see it used in that manner, eventhough that would be hard to balance.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/al2urs/repost_using_correct_rules_official_statement/?st=JRO6032Q&amp;sh=100b61ce
---
smartbombs can kill missiles, they used to get used a lot back then, probably cause of the drake fleet. I believe they were called "firewall"
---
also the old version of defender missiles were anti missiles, they would shoot missiles down. But at a ratio of 1:1 which made them pretty useless so no one used them. Then CCP changed defenders into anti bomb missiles.
---
I liked it but it was slow to load to switch ships and you could only sit there and stare at the screen, at least if you could have gone to a shared space that would have been something. That stupid door just stayed locked...
---
I didn't say anything about no local why are you bringing it up as if it was my point? I said give rats tackle.
---
Yep, smartbombs still kill missiles. Missiles have HP values, so as long as they're in the range of the AoE of the smarbomb, it'll damage/kill it.
---
Point defense seems to specifically target drones/small ships, not missiles (correct me someone if i'm wrong, i think i've only used it once and it was just 1 ship on grid).
---
I'd say there are enough counters to missiles currently, and further counters aren't really needed. Hell, just being fast is enough of a counter to every missile except light missiles.
---
&gt; them how to do their job, as they are the professionals, and we, well, are not. 
---
What kind of retarded statement is that? We aren’t asking them how to fucking code their there implementation, we are telling them their implementation doesn’t work for the reasons xy and z.
---
Middle ships are already under used because of the lack of alpha, seems like they are only good for structure bashing with cruise missiles. So I think adding another way to nerf missile boats would be the end of players using them . I love missile ships and have good skills with them but they are so limited in their use it’s not worth it 
---
Well said, it's "know" - I'm betting outside very few active pilots with experience with, against and around capitals have little to no idea how certain parts of the game work, and they see only what they can from their own perspective. In general, there's a lot of "fix caps to better fit my preferred playstyle and strengths" flying around, with arguments and actual "problems" being tailored to one specific playstyle. I mean, I'm not without fault with that one, regardless how much time I spent using or dealing with caps I still have my point of view and look at whatever ideas are flying around from my perspective.
---
Yet, those ideas and suggestions aren't completely useless - the more viewpoints you get, the more data there is for CCP to use to see how people feel about capitals role in the game and can be used as starting point for considering changes (if any) they'll make.
---
Very true
---
Tbh they will be vulnerable to bombs so I think it would be manageable anyways 
---
lol, so salty over the killboard. 
---
I don't call for such a system to be added just for the sake realism, as I can see it's obvious balancing implications. It just struck me as odd that a role so important in real life wasn't really as important in game. The question is really more lore-oriented.
---
And never you forget that!
---
How do you tell an active miner from a afk miner? The answer is you don't. That's why your comparison falls apart.
---
Yes, it apparently is not only possible to die to a Griffin Navy, it happens with some regularity: [https://zkillboard.com/ship/37455/solo/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/37455/solo/)
---
A job.
---
Yeah, I agree. It does seem odd tho that the Amarr didn't use this very simple tool to stick it to the Minmatar and Caldari. My question is really more "why isn't this in the lore" than "why isn't this in the game".
---
Industry
---
tbf, I'd pay for a triglavian suit...
---
Some time ago we had defender missiles placeable on any ship, that could shoot incoming missiles (now reworked for their anti-bomb role and restricted to destroyers). It was garbage mechanic with zero practical use, now reworked into something that has clear role and sees some usage.
---
No, Aegis sov is what happened when the devs took a single good suggestion, wrapped it up in some classic CCP bullshit mechanics and told everyone it was what we asked for.
---
Vily's in there too lol
---
&gt; While I applaud the attempt to make the marauders relevant
---
I think you misread the post. I offer the cyno cancelling module for BLOPS battleships.
---
We are trying to solve a problem where PvE capitals are protected by their respective umbrellas in an extremely lazy way. You can't hang around in these protected regions in a heavy interdictor. No matter what their intended roles might have been, in emergent gameplay they are not used to hunt supers and Rorquals in heavy umbrella regions. Much like how recon ships are designed as cyno hunters but ended up being EWAR support. 
---
Covert fleets are much suitable to operate behind enemy lines. A covert cyno ship a blops is much more suitable for cyno inhibition and is accessible to most kind of fleets. A non-covert fleet can still bring a covert cyno and a blops along.
---
No it is still afive
---
I miss it as well, but I would have liked it far more if I had the ability to maybe meet my corpmates or even alliance members... or whoever had docking access in anything... not just the npc stations. Player made citadels too. Anyway. I would have liked it far more if I could have met up with them in a "bar" inside of a station and had the option to dance drunk on a table with a lampshade on my head...
---
... or at least pretend to.
---
Ahh your right. I am asking for a quick and easy frag. After rolling the WH for an extensive period of time, flying a coherent fleet of 1+bil leshaks, and catching the rorqual, shooting it for around 20-30 minutes, then waiting out the 7.5 minute invulnerability timer, to have a stiletto warp in at 200 and light a cyno. Do I think an 3bil industrial ship should last for 30 minutes against 20 other players? NO. If you mean "better organized" you mean guys who yolo around their supers under a capital umbrella then sure better organized. You either need 90 dreads to kill it, but be careful if 10 fax's jump in it is over. 
---
 "And they're absolutely fleet warping the fuck out of there if anything that can even apply damage to them shows up on grid." - if you mean they warp off after a well-executed cyno drop brings in 25-30 supercarriers then yeah they leave. 
---
I've been using female
---
Good post, I agree with most of what you’ve outlined. However I think that a better ship to use than a blops would probably be a recon like an Arazu/Pilgrim/etc or even a new ship, as you outlined with the marauder a blops is pretty immobile, meaning you’re required to have a cyno basically and costs quite a lot (too much) when compared to most insured capitals.
---
If I was to make the change I also wouldn’t have it scram the ship, rather point it like a citadel does cus if they do manage to gate supers over (which I’ve seen a certain group do successfully to save a rorq) they should need some form of hard tackle to keep you there.
---
But really this is what I’ve been saying all along regarding cyno inhibs, my proposal would be to make them instantly activate but I agree that might be overpowered, so this is a nice solution. CCP has shown that they can add modules like this to the game with their HIC mass changes so hopefully someone will see this and do something!
---
This is not a good idea. Say I tackled 10 Rorquals. Umbrella capitals get in and scatter around. They can merely warp (since they are scattered, it is harder to 'pin them down' with bubbles now) in or doomsday if they are in range. Nothing is solved.

It's not that they can't play, it's they don't want to. And seeing how they get to know just how badly it'll get fucked next, I can't really blame them.
---
The point of this post isn’t to buff marauders, that is an entirely different conversation 
---
Yeah, something like this except disallows mwd/mjd as well. Just enough for a blops to get under the titan guns and use afterburners.
---
Issue with how PGL started that is focusing the discussion on what is to be changed, while skipping why do we want a change and what is actual goal to achieve? I can see some value in discussing how certain mechanics should be changed, but without proper context of how we want the meta to be shaped, what role should capitals serve and what other options for that role and for niches capitals would leave we can see it's just throwing away random isolated ideas with no common theme or any kind of coherence. With that approach, best we can count for is finding consensus on some random changes that'll either not change anything meaningful or will just unnecessarily nerf capitals into uselessness and drive anyone who likes capital-focused gameplay away. I'll always support discussion, but we're now starting it from the middle.
---
But you can jam fighters with the widow... oh wait
---
&gt; What about requiring the blops to target the cyno ship?
---
Thats exactly the idea. A targeted active module.
---
&gt; You think the problem is only cap vs cap?
---
I don't know what makes you think I think this. Did you read my post?
---
&gt; The AFK VNI fits very nicely in the "manage risk/reward" Eve environment.
---
What? What exactly is the risk? A VNI costs ~1 hr of afk ratting. That is not a proper risk/reward ratio.
---
you can deliver shit to people in stations. citadels in WH's drop stuff in hangars. killing unmanned ships that belong to someone shows as a loss on their KB.

Large area. As in "fuckhuge and most decidedly not in range". You now have a lot of scattered around caps on grid. Who are isolated. They have to regroup first before they can do anything coherent. Also *R E M O V E P A N I C*
---
I don´t see a problem here. You guys adapted to the "meta" and are miles ahead of pretty much the rest of EvE. So if you´re prepared at home you´re good. But why should this prevent something like "remove asset safety"? 
---
Isn't point defense just an AoE?
---
Thanks!
---
I think if you are going after people's 10-20 billion ships, it's OK if the game asks you to risk a 2 billion ship yourself. It creates content for the defenders as well. And it creates a good compromise so we can get more null mega empire members onboard with the idea.
---
Also, recons melt under supercap fighters. But you can keep a brick tanked blops alive with logi/ewar.
---
I wonder if someone still has the old "you don't talk back to AAA" recording?
---
What makes them unable to warp to the target? You can't bubble them because they aren't scattered. You can defensively bubble the target but you can't do that for a 500km3 sphere so they'll land in gun/fighter/doomsday range. The entire point is giving attackers options to prevent capitals from landing on the grid of the target.
---
I think when you imagine "capitals being scattered" you imagine a large null pvp fleet scenario, where you have a 500 man fleet and now you have lots of scattered capitals to kill. But my post is more about a 100man covert fleet tryign to kill a super, preventing a 200 man supercap umbrella from directly jumping on them.
---
I was excited at the subject of him waging war on CCP over balance issues. I was sorely disappointed to see that he though GTFO, boson, and HAW titans were what was in most dire need of attention :-\\
---
Welp... I am both a Timmy irl and online.  I got a Johnny both irl and online too.  
---
wow EPIC picture of hacking a node !! very cool never before seen post gold 4 u
---
And here I was at chuckie cheese.. good job fellas
---
Ye true, pretty retarded that a t2 cruiser melts under a super but that’s CCP.
---
I guess for super hunting it makes sense but not for rorq or carrier hunting, rorqs are still very safe that the chances of your blops dying would be high enough to skew the risk/reward imo. And for normal carriers it’s not even close to being worth it.
---
I feel like having the option would be good tho, maybe on any ship that can fit a covert ops cloak + blops (but make the fitting requirement high enough so that a fleet of bombers can’t all fit one) and short enough range so that if you do choose a bomber or something it’d be very easy to frag. 
---
Idk doesn’t really matter either way I’d love it if CCP would just do *something*
---
go watch 'this is real eve'
---
Oh I read what you posted just fine. In true EVE fashion, I countered. I disagree with further making BLPOs the du'jour playstyle. If you want true interdiction, then you need a specialized ship. That ship exists, and you can bypass many gate camps by doing what Goons do all the time, use wormholes to get behind enemy lines.  It's not a secret, EVERYBODY in EVE does it. 
---
The sad thing is, given how unhappy the players are to the current state of things, imagine it CQ was still ingame.
---
Every saved hour adds up in the end after all.
---
Yeah. I would probably be OK with all ships having the module. Yet it'd be harder to get people onboard with the idea.
---
I've all but stopped playing now, proliferation of caps means that it becomes pointless. Even lowsec battles are now fought between major factions with capitals small guys get dropped and called pussies cos they won't stick around to get killed. 
---
I've been playing nearly 10 years now and have put countless hours an money into this game. But now that every character and there mother could be a cap pilot its made scouting impossible, and lowsec not viable as a place for content outside of if you want to live under the "protection" of a super group. 
---
Roqual's have made it so its more expensive to buy a T2 Battleship hull then it is to capital that is completely backward? But I don't think there is an answer. Only maybe getting rid of supers out of low sec and forcing capitals to take gates unless in null sec, these are some ideas but I come up empty I'm burnt out on the frustration of the whole thing, and saddened by the fact that nothing is going to change. 
---
&gt; Having a way to reliably interrupt cyno could allow anyone randomly doing stuff in caps/supers to - when threatened - light cyno, bring whatever you need to immediately save said ship (like ECM, booshers etc.), force decycle cyno on your ship and warp/jump off.
---
It would work if the anti-cyno mechanic didn't stop it cycling normally, it just stopped anyone jumping to it.
---
After you've taken the initial gate she appears and disappears the instant you engage in the first &amp; second pocket. The final pocket you can kill her but she'll warp off for good if you don't 
---
You've been able to kill her in one of the pockets she's supposed to disappear in? And she spawned again in the next pocket?
---
This is actually brilliant.
---
Kind of. It was incoherent. Didn't see you address the major issues.
---
Falcon ragequitting?
---
do people even go to dodixie any more? seems kind of dead, even amarr is teetering. Kind of sad since it makes basically all space that isn't ~~superior~~ Caldari space pretty dead
---
you mean, defender missiles?
---
are they still in the game?
---
What prevents a response fleet cynoing in 500 of target from just warping in? How is a 15 second window fair for the super? EVE is a game of risk and reward. How is the risk of loosing your multi-billion ISK ship and capsule in (effectively) 15 seconds even remotely proportionate to even the income of super ratting? The risk is too high with the reward too low = people are not gonna do it anymore.
---
While i agree that stalemates are frustrating, i think no "get out of free" options should be implemented. At least one ship should definitely die in there. Starting with resist penalties ending with the last 5 minutes being arena perimeter closing in on the gate and growing damaging cloud(?) effects (think sleeper cache archive room).
---
 
---
That said, if you thought you could just go into the pvp room and never lose your ship, i am glad you got this lesson.
---
EZ way to get that zkill achievement for killing a ccp ship.
---
Yes, but they are anti-bomb now.
---
PVE in general needs an overhaul. Why not combine the two?
---
Make high-end anomalies their own space, a sort of modified, more accessible and forgiving abyssal space. Nobody might interrupt you while you are carrier ratting, but once you start a site you have to complete it or wait for the timer to run out. Once either of those things happen who knows who will wait for you outside with a cyno-inhib already anchored?
---
Probably a stupid idea but I think it does offer a few possibilities that simply tweaking a few numbers doesn't. Obviously it's a bit more effort, but at least this way all the work that went into abyssal space gets reused.
---
Loot drop.
---
Just do them all. If you’re exploring in one area you’ll benefit quite a bit from putting the sites on respawn sooner
---
Missiles can alpha stuff off the field, just not instantly because of flight time.  I’ve been on many, many fleets where we lob one volley per target because we know they will aloha in 8 seconds or however long flight time is.

Seriously I didn't know this made a ding sound for the popup. 
---
Anti-missile drones would be interesting. Like AMS and LAMS on mechs ;p
---
Incursions are pretty boring according to everyone I’ve heard talk about them but you. 
---
Fobs are only worth doing if you warp in a battleship and shoot the structure for a bit from what I saw when one popped up near our space, and that doesn’t sound interesting. 
---
Event sites are also boring, it’s extremely repetitive against extremely weak enemies. 
---
I honestly don’t know anything about burners, so maybe, but again, I’ve never heard anyone else call them fun. 
---
Which leaves only abyssals, and those aren’t really fun, it’s just that you are required to always pay attention because of the very high risk involved. 
---
Ive been playing GW2 recently, and doing alot of market flipping. Ive played a lot of eve, but never got into that in this game. In GW2 there is a 3rd party site that will track your profits, and even show you trending items with decent ROI's. Are there any tools like that for eve, rather than just flipping through each item looking for a good margin?
---
Oooh, nice thought! Maybe even give different drones different damage against different missiles?

Amarr is allied to Caldari.

It doesn't; it's a response to a bad feint by the person I replied to, claiming that we weren't somehow already doing the thing.
---
Asset safety should stay so players don't have to spend a bunch of time shuffling assets between NPC stations and player-owned structures. I don't know about you or anyone else, but hauling is the least fun part of this game.
---
You are so precious 
---
There should be a word between “grade” and “omega” that tells you what implant it is. You can sell that blueprint as a contract, or build it and sell it on the market. Use tools like Evemarketer and Fuzzwork’s Blueprint tool to price it.
---
Why they want capital changes: because the Imperium has the most of them, and use them to defend and exploit the resources of Delve.
---
Your suggestions are viable, but you dismiss alternate proposals without thinking them through sufficiently (or at least presenting that process). I think while BLOPS need love, this isn't how they should get it, and making the anti cyno module under this scheme a HIC or recon-based one is more sensible.
---
Bad idea #1 is more solid than you give it credit for: If you scale delay with ship class, and start it off at more like 25-30s for carriers (for example) as it gives time to respond to a cyno on grid, and the option of killing it if it's not lit on a well tanked hull, denying the instant capital drop at range, allowing time for bubble screening to be setup. It makes a cyno more of a contestable objective rather than guaranteed I-win button. Further, if cynos were a 200k PG module (drifting into bad idea #3) that was role bonused on force recons, it would be a meaningful trade-off to fit one on caps in impacting their tank.
---
Bad idea #2 is a nice way of implementing a choice in cyno activation in combination with #1: either light it for a jumpbridged subcap fleet or a single carrier/dread/fax within 5s, then burning it out, or accept the delayed landing of everything you've got. Cyno chaining under these circumstances would be cancerous to implement, and would heavily limit ease of bringing super/titan assets to grid, because you'd still need to light a normal cyno to do so.
---
I somehow can never bother to read EveOnion but this was actually pretty hilarious.

You can skillshot it anywhere within 300km where it'll affect everything in a 10km radius.

Most of the big players know the a strength and weakness of them and play to that.   PGL is salty that he cant come commit nothing come into a block coalitions backyard yard and own someone supers fleet.  Same thing would happen if the north came into tests backyards or test went into goons backyard.

Nullsec exploration! Hop into your astero, fly to wherever the fuck, if at any time you need to leave quickly just safelog in space. 
---
not really my point... but yeah.

I'd rather see big overhauls in PvE as well. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/) is my milder suggestion (without requiring a huge remake). But I see that issue and this as independent.
---
What's the fastest way to repair my standing towards Caldari? I'm at -10 due to FW shenanigans.

Yeah, it would be cool if there was an Empire war lowsec faction war space split the empires. That would restore the value of each Empire's market.

I think I'm going to die tbh

Look up on YouTube a guide on how to use supercarrier burst projectors. It works in the same way
---
&gt; What prevents a response fleet cynoing in 500 of target from just warping in? 
---
Defenders can cyno in capitals. Attackers can warp in the cyno and bubble their path. Defenders can clear bubbles. There can be all sorts of interaction. This proposal is not designed to give 0 options to the defenders. If it was, you would probably be upset about that.
---
&gt;  How is a 15 second window fair for the super? 
---
What number is fair? Fairness is relative. Game balance is not. Game is currently at a state where farming is ultra safe in a few regions. That needs to change. I won't argue here why because it is its own independent issue. But [I did it here,](ow is the risk of loosing your multi-billion ISK ship and capsule in \(effectively\) 15 seconds even remotely proportionate to even the income of super ratting? The risk is too high with the reward too low = people are not gonna do it anymore.) section 1 and 2.
---

---
Again this is about that broader issue. But let me say this. The game is such that in ultra safe regions, only 4% of all farming convert to content. My broader aim is getting that number to about 15% for most organized regions, and 25% at least organized regions. Think of it as "content tax". If my proposal takes it above that ratio (which it won't, it won't even make it 8%), then we can talk about changing it again. Meanwhile, as farming in nullsec is still profitable despite eventual ship losses, risk/reward will be at a good place. If anything, null ratting is too riskless now.
---
that would remove half the point of d scan

cause now you know what class ship is flying around by how fast they show up in local.

so no

This was a joke post. Relax bro.

Point defense on structures are essentially just big smartbombs. They’ll damages anything that can be affected by AOE damage.

Uuuuuuuggggghhhhh fuck PI forever :(

Have you ever seen anything "industrial" that couldn't take a beating? Should it have a paper tank? Basically you want to be able to kill a Rorqual before a staging supercap fleet can arrive via cyno. You're just pissed it's not a willing victim like everything else a miner has ever flown.

It is a bit eye-cancer, but it simplifies the task of picking which planets to switch production on and when. all i have to do now is enter the average extraction amount, any stored resources i care about, and then adjust the timespan i'm looking at to see what the resource values will be at by then.

Except you wouldn’t know when someone jumped into  the system until AFTER they showup on local. Dscan would still be useful. Think about it.

As someone else said, if you're not a poor Russian gopnik living in a krokodil infested Soviet apartment block then working IRL is the best way to make ISK.

Good lord that was awful.

Anti-cyno capability should be proportionally versatile to the size of the ship fitted with it.  A frigate should be able to apply a cyno-jam instantly, but weakly (at a baseline count of 1 maybe).  Opposed to that, a battleship should also be able to jam most cynos at the cost of needing to spool up a few seconds before applying (which definitely will make it hard to counter cyno-frigates, but hear me out on this one).  What if we separate cynosaural fields into small, medium, and large modules?  Then invert the spool-up time while giving a baseline spool-up period for all cynos so that a frig can't instantly call a capital fleet onto field (or right after jumping into system) but deftly dodge around a fleet so it can cyno up, while a tanky battleship could use a few seconds of its reps to pop open the cyno (but get countered by a fleet of anti-cyno frigs).  I'm still trying to think about the ways this could play out, I'm just putting this out into the thread for theorycrafting.
---
They cant faking implement a seperate chat client correctly and you ask for this sci fi bullshit. 
---
More salt to mine!!!
---
i mean for people entering system
---
you enter system, you have no idea if someone is ratting in a carrier there or in a frig
---
but then you watch local and notice that 4 cap speed locals loaded. so you know 4 caps are undocked.

in large systems especially this breaks d scan

*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** Jagger_19! ^(hug)
---
I see your point. However, in reality most ratters would be in local cos their “timer” would have expired. 
---
Maybe the answer isn’t based on sig radius and perhaps ship roles. 
---
Perhaps something like a ceptor might get 30 secs “invisibility”. It’s fast enough to catch something, squishy enough to kill before secondary points land.

This does help with the dock when neut enters local issues.

I understand completely how it could require a major overhaul and the setup/routing/code/deployment etc (hell multi-threaded coding for things like EVE would be really really hard when it comes to event timings between cores and on top of that you use Python which makes it a near impossible task) and how multiple systems integrate and communicate together makes it difficult to change anything, without potentially breaking shit badly.
---
Virtualization has come a long way now though in terms of support, stability and performance than it was some years back (SR-IOV, PCI Passthrough, virtio, NUMA etc). Hopefully it'd be worth looking into over time if it's more viable than it was before. You have my faith!
---
Maybe some of the server-&gt; all client on-grid events could be offloaded and handled by external applications with channels structured ala this: [https://github.com/vgno/ssehub](https://github.com/vgno/ssehub) (scales stupid well). I don't know how big of a factor that is, or if it's mainly client-&gt;server events that is hard to process at a fast enough pace. While we all click those modules a million times or spam fighters even though we know we're digging the hole deeper and deeper. :D
---
Like stated in the former post, I have little to no insight in how you run the operation at all. Just find it really fascinating how EVE pushes the boundary for how large fights we can have (although we the community give you a lot of unwarranted shit for clunky performance at times). Given the code base being so old it is a really epic achievement.
---
Thanks a lot for taking the time \*during weekend!\* to reply. It really is awesome how you guys interact with us and actually give a shit about our opinions and ideas. And sorry if my "rant" comes through as I'm talking out of my ass. It's all meant in good faith!

If you're asking these questions, you haven't been paying attention to the debate.
---
since turrets apply instantly  you can volley her the first time you see her, and then she will respawn in the next room where if you kill her before she warps out you can get a +3 cha implant.  She has 4500 raw HP,  so I think you need something like a 9-10k volley, the mach can do even more volley damage and is fast so it gets it done easy. 
---
Personally I'd love to see the roles of cyno inhibs and cyno's themselves actually switched. 
---
Make cyno's into a structure that you need to anchor in 60 seconds, can be shot and destroyed by the enemy, and people have a chance to knock it out before it's activated. 
---
Make inhibs into a highslot module which can be activated, anchoring the ship in place and only available to particular classes (i.e. BLOPs or something blingy) that can prevent cyno's in a particular range (i.e. 400km). More importantly, make it so it can also prevent existing cyno's from recycling. 
---
- You want to move something? Cool drop a cyno like normal.
---
- You want to light an offensive cyno? Cool control the grid where you want it and then jump in. If you can't control the grid anchor it off grid and warp your caps in. 
---
- You want a defensive cyno? Take control of the grid with subcaps before bringing in capital reinforcements. Alternatively use jump beacons already in place, or anchor off grid. 
---
- You want to inhibit cynos? Cool, you need to commit something blingy to the grid for at least 5 minutes.
---
&gt; it gives time for both parties to respond to respectively hostile cynos on grid, and the option of killing it if it's not lit on a well tanked hull, or setting up screening bubbles if it's unreachable in good time. Adding the delay makes a lit cyno on-grid more of a contestable objective rather than guaranteed I-win button. 
---
How do you contest? As you said. You either gtfo. Or you kill the cyno ship. But remember, the main problem we are trying to solve is regions heavily guarded with supercap umbrellas and particularly there being virtually no way to touch PvE capitals in these regions. In that context, you'll never kill a Rorqual or a super in the spool times you have in mind. If the target is anything smaller, you can already kill those with big fleets despite the supercap umbrellas (like by blapping them with 100 bombers). So the only thing it gives to the attacker is the ability to gtfo. Ergo, the change yields less overall killmaills. I think most balance patches should ultimately aim for more overall killmaills.
---
&gt; Further, if cynos were a 200k PG module (drifting into bad idea #3) that was role bonused on force recons, it would be a meaningful trade-off to fit one on caps in impacting their tank.
---
That would merely make more people move in Delve/Esoteria. Such regions would have an abundance of designated cyno alts in each system. And in less organized regions people would be individiually forced to have them. More benefit gap for heavy umbrella regions. Also, that would be an incredibly invasive change forcing people with JF cyno networks etc to train into countless recon alts.
---
&gt; Bad idea #2 is a nice way of implementing a choice in cyno activation in combination with #1: either light it for a jumpbridged subcap fleet or a single carrier/dread/fax within 5s
---
Firstly, this too is incredibly invasive to non-whaling situations, such as sov warfare or keepstar fights. Secondly, if there is a "bring everything in 30 secs" option, this proposal defeats itself. Its most viable form is mass limiting it to 5 supers or 10 carriers etc. But then they'll chain, and it's not hard to coordinate if the limit is 5-10 ships. Whoever was able to take the previous cyno lights another one. The fleet is already stuck 10 minutes, to everybody lighting a cyno is not a problem.
---
&gt; As an afterthought comment I would say that while your suggestions address on-grid outcome, they don't touch more global power-projection disparity issues between caps/subcaps at all.
---
My suggestion is about balancing capital jump capability. Capitals vs subcaps is a broader issue, and my suggestion is merely a single aspect of it. 
---
I can't raise elaborate arguments on all issues at once.

THE HORROR
---
The new arrival in system doesn't show in the Local list until observed by another player or NPC in system.  The player remains in local until observed by a player or NPC in a different system or if they go unobserved after some period of time.. 
---
However there are probably 100s of things wrong with this idea, so I'd vote we just get the system we have now to work reliably..
---
Marauders can fit through wormholes ;)
---
As someone who works on and operates a real life CIWS system, my guess is that in the future they realized the reality is that CIWS systems are very maintenance based and therefore prone to unreliability. 
---
hey atleast this one has a catchy title and punchline.
---
mwd cloak is your friend, wont save you every time but it will reduce losses significantly
---
People will always downvote, I'm not here to be a karma whore anyway.
---
You are entirely right though. I have no insight in how it's run, how many applications are running or what they are doing. In my mind, each system is a single process using a single core. Some parts are probably "outsourced" to other workers (like client-&gt;client interactions) to work around single threads bottlenecks.
---
My thought is that if a system fills up with more than x amounts of people and y interactions happen within a certain timeframe and TIDI starts, the VM(s) containing these would be paused and migrated to a reinforced node on-the-fly. I would guess that is pretty much what they are doing manually when a fight is ticketed to CCP and they migrate it during downtime. But yeah as habakuk stated in the response, doing it when players are online is a hard task and that's totally understandable.
---
It'd be pretty dank if it would be doable sometime in the future though without manual interaction from CCP!

You can't remove asset safety. Structures are not meant to just replace POSes. They are meant to replace stations as well.

Stations do not drop loot. If you're going to replace stations with structures, then structures cannot drop loot either. That's that simple.
---

What is wrong with capitals ? Same things that have been wrong for a very long time now, except now they're getting to the point where its getting rediculous and people have been quitting the game over it. Either over single aspect of their issues or a combination of any of the aspects. Same shit everyone always knew was wrong but nothing was done about it so now shits getting out of hand. In no particular order:
---
Caps are too cheap - effect of mining, insurance and botting / multiboxing
---
There are too many caps - effect of mining, insurance, botting / multiboxing and skill injectors
---
Balance Gap between sub caps and caps - effect of development stagnation, poorly thought out or not thought out at all game systems and game mechanics
---
Cap vs Cap - at least larger battles take way too long, often (though not always) with too little caps destroyed, often so boring that players in them would rather go back to ratting in their caps or do something else in the game then stay in the fleets - effect of caps having too much EHP, faxes, too many caps, injectors, bots / multiboxers, sub cap vs cap balance cliff, etc. etc. all the shit put together.
---
What do we want : For the shit to get fixed, ***except*** for those that are involved (not all of them, there is a number that don't) in the above mentioned mining, multiboxing, botting, etc. cuz it gives them e-peen
---
For the rest of us, those that do not bot, multibox, or even those that do but feel it is problematic... How do we want it fixed : We can't agree
---
twas the goons during the first hulkageddon i experienced!
---
The problem is that it's so much safer and easier with a jump freighter that it doesn't make any sense. Horde has a JF service between Gem and Jita 4-4 that's *super* cheap. I don't know how you would compete. Also, I would guess you would die so often that it wouldn't be worth it.
---
If you **had** to do it. I would go with /u/PM_ME_YOUR_AWOX and do it with wormholes. However, think of what this means. You will probably need to spend about 1-2 hours, depending on luck, probing down a wormhole chain. That's assuming you're at least half competent with scanning and using tripwire; which experience says is only the case for ~10% or so of people.
---
Then you go back and make that same journey in your industrial. Also, if you're using your Horde toon, you then want to hand it over to an out-of-corp alt so they can truck it the rest of the way to Jita... assuming you aren't killed by CODE and friends along the way.
---
Advice for HS: have a high buffer tank. Invest in a solid fit. It may save you or at least make tankers decide you're not worth it after ship scanning you.
---
But, what do I know. Don't listen to me and follow your space dreams.
---
You really want to wake said sleeping dragon ?
---
You’re in Geminate? Does that mean you’re part of Horde?
---
Nice strawman you fucking moron
---
&gt; Lower the insurance pay out. Caps should not be less expensive to loose than many battleships.
---
Agreed. There's a reason for the division between subcapitals and capitals. It's time to adjust the drawbacks so that they match the benefits those ships provide. Capitals should dent your wallet more than even faction Battleships, to be honest.
---
That is just one change though, and it definitely needs to go along with changes to the way income is made. You can't balance by cost when cost is meaningless.
---
It isn't complete bullshit at all. It's a near requirement for the smaller corporations that are anchoring a single structure to call home out in null somewhere.
---
If you get rid of asset safety, you're not hurting the large corporations, you're only hurting the smaller ones. Goons could lose every structure they own overnight and still manage to come out fine, so it's clearly not something that would accomplish balance where it's actually needed.
---
It would only result in pushing smaller groups out of null, and allowing the larger groups to lay claim to even more space. Sorry, but I don't want the entirety of null to be owned by just 2-3 groups while everyone else just dicks around in low-sec and high-sec.
---
Cosplay tailors are where you go for that.   
---
CCP hasnt yet learned from George Lucas what to do with SciFi Intellectual property quite yet

---
What is the best way to do PI? I setup a 2--&gt;4 setup with 4 planets, (3x 2-&gt;3 and 1x 3-&gt;4) but getting P2 stuff was too difficult. I found it far too much effort for not enough reward and far too much risk gating epithals full of 100s of millions of ISK of investment.
---
Also, so much clicking! If you want a setup that's flexible about where you put and collect stuff, if you're not developing RSI you're doing it wrong.
---
Also, can a 3-toon account easily make &gt;= 1.85 billion ISK/month? Otherwise I don't really see the point, especially in having account farms. I can understand if people then use them as mining alts, but IMO that's just too much effort.
---
Because it's needed for smaller corporations to actually make the transition to structures and leave stations behind.
---
Losing structures doesn't hurt the large groups, like Goons. You could remove asset safety and Goons would be fine, even if they lost half their structures overnight.
---
But the smaller corporations, that ones that actually provide some variety in null, would be forced out because they can't compete with the larger groups. They couldn't compete before either, but there was at least something that prevented the larger groups from just erasing their existence from the game.
---
Get rid of asset safety, and a large portion of smaller corporations will just make the move to low-sec and high-sec, while null becomes nothing more than a playground for the same 2-3 groups (as if it wasn't already). I don't think that's good for the future of EVE, do you?
---
Short answer - no.  People will want collateral on the contracts - which will always be way more than your ship.  First loss, and you're broke.  This is why JF are supreme in null - much bigger loads and relative safety to move them.  If you want to try it, then I'd suggest you'd want a T2 hauler at least, the speed of a BR of the carrying capacity (and tank) of a DST.

This seems like a really stupid thing to publicly post.
---
Begun it has, the Trade War
---
1) I dont particularly know. I like having 5 extraction planets and a factory planet. I refine everything to a P1, export, then further refine it on my factory world. It really didnt cost much to setup, and i'm operating fully in hisec but still pulling in a good amount per day. When i have my setup running full-steam i can pull in around 30mil per day. 
---
2) Almost all the clicking in this is involved with the extraction planets. some planets have 9 processors, and if i switch production on those i have to setup all of them. Really it's not too bad. 
---
3) 3 of my setups would pull in around 1.5 bil per month, possibly even more if you sorted out the logistics and traded resources to further improve efficiency. I dont have farming accounts, and it's something i do to provide resources i need for T2 drone production.

---
I know some use widows with cruise missiles to rat. Or you can use RR sins with drones to do escalations. 
---
There should be, yes. I agree with you there, however..
---
Lots of things are ruining EVE right now, but in the end, you can append "... by large groups" to pretty much all of those things in the context of how most of the damage is being done.
---
Rorquals are being abused.. by large groups. Structures are being spammed.. by large groups. FAXes are being abused.. by large groups. Capitals are being spammed.. by large groups.
---
Small groups aren't spamming Citadels, filling systems with Rorquals, or rocking fleets of FAXes and Supers. Those things are unique to the larger groups.
---
It's always large groups that cause the *real* issues, because they hold much more control over the game than anyone else. So if/when changes are made, I would rather see those changes specifically tailored to neutering those large groups than anything else.
---
Removing asset safety would be a blanket change that affects everyone, but it would also more negatively affect smaller groups than larger ones because the larger groups are equipped to deal with it while the smaller groups are not. That's why I'm against it. It won't make EVE better, it will just make EVE worse.

Running Jita would be fairly tricky due to WarDecs. 
---
Running a t1 around Gem and surrounding areas might be doable. Spend a few days asking in Horde getting a few different opinions on it.
---
One way of maybe doing it is getting a second player to scout ahead to make sure places aren’t gate camps / no neuts or war targets in desto and on route. 
---
Respectfully disagree. A big theme of making shit easier to kill actually impacts bigger entities much more than smaller ones. 
---
At some point if you’re dropping on Test / NC / Goons / any other entity with a supercap force you’re going to be outmatched. That’s fine; it’s their home turf, they should be able to defend. But with the current mechanics it’s not possible to do a hit and run because it gives time for them to always form and respond. 
---
Hit and run tactics aren’t viable because you can’t get in, spank a single rorq, and get out, because it’s actually get in, no matter how much damage you do give them seven minutes to form, and subsequently have to break fax reps and / or contest against supers / titans. 
---
Hence, the little guy can’t damage the big guy. In contrast, the big guy can always kill the little guy, because if your caught you’re going to die no matter what.
---
Making shit easier to kill means as a smaller entity hit and run is a lot more viable. Yes you’ll get escalated on but hopefully you can actually do something before that happens. 
---
With regards to asset safety again it requires people to think outside of the box a little. Okay cool citadels are going to replace stations, make it so you can stage out of those citadels and they can’t be destroyed. Boom little guy has a place to live and be perfectly safe. I don’t really accept your premise that the little guy is less equipped to deal with it than big entities. Why do you think that’s true?

Because a group like Goons losing a Keepstar is less interruptive to their gameplay than a small 10-man group losing their only Astrahus. The former is just going to absord the loss without flinching while the latter is forced to make drastic changes in order to keep playing the game.

Even with asset safety, that small group losing their only structure would have a far greater impact than Goons losing a Keepstar, so it isn't as though you can't put pressure on "groups" because of asset safety -- it's more that you can put any meaningful pressure on *large groups* because of asset safety.
---
In my mind, enabling asset safety for the first 5 structures in a corporation/alliance, but disabling it for all after that would do more to help the game than straight up removing asset safety. I would want a targeted change like that, which neuters large groups while still allowing small groups to exist.

The caveat is no one can know who they are. The other stuff is a byproduct of that. Can't be on mic, because their voice will get recognized. 
---
A few of the devs expressed interest in joining alliances with supercap engagements in order to get first hand experience, but it's difficult. Especially because if their character gets burnt, they lose most that SP (due to injector diminishing returns) and the isk from buying the extractors.

I've seen many different people crticizing caps and their strength across Reddit - not only PGL&amp;TEST, but also small gangers, wormhole groups, hunters, solo pilots etc. As much as anyone could want to push all that on PGL alone, the topic is raised repeatedly, by multiple people, and I believe that they have very much different look at how caps work compared to null FCs.

---
You don't catch a Rorqual/Super with a Leshak. You catch it with sabres or ceptors. Then you burn your Leshaks from multiple systems away. Those Leshak fleets mostly use wh tunnels or wh ragerolling. But it's really rare they spawn at the exact system with the target. They are never the first ships to land on the target. The upside with the blops is that it is immediately jumpable to the target. Covert fleets, in general, are much more swift in that way.
---
The super can already cyno up until your marauders make their way to the target.
---
There were some of those questions answered in overall discussion, but so far I didn't see much of a talk about why and towards what (end goal, not means) caps should change. That's why I decided to put this post, to both understand what's actually going on with all the discussion, and to shift the talk at least a bit towards more endresult-oriented area.
---
Great, Let's make attempting to actually kill supers/ Titans even more punishing
---
WHY NOT TRY TOO LOOT?
---
This is not tongue in cheek OP. It’s the correct answer. Just buy isk.
---
The leshak/rohk/rattlesnakes are still beating response fleets... so it doesn't matter what the initial tackle is. 
---
It's having the instant cyno inhib that makes it an actual content point and not just an iwin button.
---
It's funny cuz it's TRUE 🤣
---
Yes. 
---
&gt; Oh I read what you posted just fine. In true EVE fashion, I countered. I disagree with further making BLPOs the du'jour playstyle. If you want true interdiction, then you need a specialized ship. That ship exists, and you can bypass many gate camps by doing what Goons do all the time, use wormholes to get behind enemy lines. It's not a secret, EVERYBODY in EVE does it.
---
Lol thanks for teaching me the secrets of wormholes. You probably only know me by my booshing. Before Goons were even aware of wormholes exist, I was bringing my fleets into Deklein (Goon Deklein) via wormholes. They weren't rolling all wormholes in their space just yet. I designed the fleet concept Bombers Bar calls "Armada", in which I and them killed hundreds of capitals via wormhole ragerolling. 
---
But hey. You are a Goon you know how Delve works. You know you roll all wormholes now. So the only way I get a hictor in a Goon target system is by ragerolling. And then you know you have multiple gatecamps and corporations responding to neutrals in each small pocket in Delve. So my hictor won't be able to do 4-5 jumps even if it is in Delve using a wormhole, right?
---
If you want to limit this new cyno inhibition capability to only 5 jump limit of a wormhole, only when someone ragerolls in your space, then you'd give it to a hictor. That'd be awfully convenient to a Goon, wouldn't it?
---
&gt; If you want true interdiction, then you need a specialized ship. 
---
1) Interdiction and cyno inhibition are entirely different things and roles.
---
2) Ships do not simply have "roles'. They have their CCP-intended roles (in which CCP wanted people to use them), and emergent roles (in which people actually use them). The emergent roles are still fine as long as they are balanced. Did you know titans/supers were never intented by CCP to have the role of ratting ships, gatecamping ships, or mainline fleet doctrines?
---
I read it again. The guy is retarded.
---
&gt;This will accomplish a few things. Firstly, if you anchor it next to the target, then it **disables the defenders from lighting a cyno from an alt 100km** off and directly doomsdaying the field. Now **they can only cyno in 400 off** or completely off-grid
---
Yeah, if the thing blocks 400km of cyno placement, that would seem to be the result.
---
&gt;The reason why the current model of inhibition doesn't work is that 99% of targets are awake enough to light their cynoes before an inhib anchors next to them. **Thus a stronger solution is needed.** But if the "cyno shutter" is AOE, it might be too OP. *So we need a different thing** than the mobile anchorable.
---
Yeah, you just said so. Stop rambling and get to the fucking point.
---
The entire proposal is incoherent, dumb, and doesnt address the issues. He has no clue about balance.
---
Awesome! That’s the ship that made me want to download the game, just gotta earn one
---
Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if CCP was given time to make walking in stations work without us freaking out. It might have turned out pretty sweet. 
---
I'll be honest, I was really bummed to find myself not in the deck. I know I'm pretty low key but I do put a lot of effort into third party websites and have done so for several years.
---
I totally would have bought the deck had I been in there, but I'm not so I didn't.
---
Try Factorio, it's like PI, but more fun.
---
&gt; The leshak/rohk/rattlesnakes are still beating response fleets... so it doesn't matter what the initial tackle is.
---
Yes. Becuase a capital in distress lights his cyno and yells on teamspeak at the initial moment of tackle. By the time those Leshaks arrive on target, the cyno will already be up and the supercap umbrella will already be on grid.
---
That's why you never see those Leshak fleets in umbrella regions like Delve or Esoteria. They are good if they get a few Rorquals with two supers protecting them, in a region like Cobalt Edge. But the very point of my proposal is umbrella regions.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system.

That's another reason why this was such a bad idea. People who support this community just as much -- or even more than others might not make the list. They should have just done gallente, minmatar, amarr, caldari for symbols, have gallente and minmatar be one color, amarr caldari be another, and have ships be the numbers. a King would be a titan, queen a super, jack a dread, etc etc. 
---
supers and titan already insure for shit, all this does is make people who might try to kill supers and titans less likely to use caps. That solves nothing.

there should be an anti covert cyno deployable

So what you're really saying is, that because you and your pals forced Goons out of Deklein, and into a region in space that is far more defensible, you are mad that Goons pulled a "gitgud" on you. You guys are responsible for making Goons what they are. You should pat yourselves on the back.

---
I guess they need an easy win against Winter after getting dicked on by alliances they said were dead?
---
I mean dont you remember eve when it was mostly subcaps? It was a lot of fun and had alot of stuff you can do to change up a fight. And when the big tois did come out it was an event in itself. It used to be amazing to see all the caps get dropped because you knew that this group was putting it all on the line. Now theres too much capitals, and you gotta train them to make your alliance competitive, and you gotta crank them out in huge amounts or get stomped out.
---
Capitals are so immense and basically cookie cutter, theres not to much to really do. I mean theres alot of tactics, but less so then subcaps. And besides that, new players want to jump into the fight and go at it and feel like they matter. They need access to more fights or even small gant stuff thats not going to be won by the crux of caps involved. 
---
Subcaps used to be almost always central to overall success of everything, not only because caps werent proliferated so much but also because they were so expensive and only filled really niche roles. Sure there were huge battles where the capital hammer needed to drop but most of the work was done in subcap fleets.
---
Besides that, cap dominance in the balance of eve pvp really fucked up the dynamic of player activity. Lines are drawn in the sand and players have almost exclusive safety in null because of caps. You cant just venture around and look for action - many groups will simply drop down carriers or titans on you and end any content. That in turn makes players not want to go out of their comfort zone unless they know that they wont be instantly welping all these subcaps. It really fucked up the livelyness of the gameworld.
---
&gt; Cyno counter play needs to be a thing. Give cynos a spool up timer where the ship is locked in place and the beacon lights but nothing can jump to it, giving whoever is being dropped on time to react and shoot it/run.
---
This provides even more safety if you bubblefuck system entrance, especially after T3C nerf. Even now it's hard to get a cyno offensively in place you need it to be (to drop on someone) unless you're running cynoceptor, that would increase defensive safety even more and push people to use more anchorable bubbles = even less risk.
---
&gt; Lower supercap EHP and all capital rep strength. Let em die faster.
---
Gank super has about 470k ehp volley damage, single doomsday is 1500k damage. Lowering supercap EHP even more (note supers EHP got heavy nerf with Citadel expansion) would benefit only super gankers and make big fights even more of onesided swing the moment you get slightly more titans on your side, enforcing N+1 gameplay even more. Nerfing capital reps could be interesting as a way to make it possible to force through FAX reps with insufficient FAX numbers.
---
&gt; Lower capital gun tracking. HAWs should be able to hit BSs and if your lucky BCs, and cap guns shouldn't be able to hit subcaps at all.
---
That would have to come with raw HAW dps buff, because even now HAW dread is comparable to two fleet rattlesnakes, and HAW titan is about 3.5 fleet rattlesnakes when it comes to damage output. HAWs are in fact pretty weak against any properly tanked subcap fits, and I'd be careful with changes here. Pushing HAWs more towards BS/BC cleanup if supported right (webs, paints) could be interesting.
---
&gt; Nerf the capital production bonuses on engineering complexes. Make caps take longer to build and be more expensive.
---
When ECs were introduced, research and build time on supercaps was increased adjusting best possible research/copy/build speed to what was achievable with POSes. I still don't understand why it wasn't done with caps and capital parts.
---
Dreads, and (to an extent) FAXes are often used as ammo and are expected to die when they drop; changing insurance for them would make people give up on using dreads (which are still the best non-supercap tool against supercaps/Rorquals) and just fit FAXes with more tank so less of them dies. Also, I doubt many people insure pve capitals. As a result, it increases the risk of caps under umbrella being even safer.
---
Don't get me wrong, those ideas are quite interesting, but there's so many ways it could misfire and make the situation even worse.
---
what am i looking at?
---
I wasn't beaten, and I didn't come back. You said yourself that you were using wormhole tactics against the Imperium when it was in Deklein, therefore you took part in the eviction to some degree. You sound like EVERYBODY that took part in that eviction, that is now just sickened that the Imperium took that square on the chin, and bounced back to become the galactic power that it is now. Sickened because none of you can replicate it, because of your own small thinking.
---
Again, I wasn't there. I don't have the same hard feelings towards some of the political entities out there that many in the Imperium have. What I do have, are set feeling on how people want to essentially "fix" what ain't broken, because they can't finger fuck their way around it.
---
Not sure if he muted me or not.... We have disagreed on a few things before...
---
#Gay4Jay
---
That would be huge buff to offensive capital use, allowing to set up dreadbombs without having to rely on NPC station jumpclones, not to mention getting covops cynos at 0 on whatever target you pick. Basically: making every single cap that's not under strong umbrella dead very quickly. That's only push people in range of super umbrellas long-term.

east tenerefis isn't covered under our NIP. that was XIX's choice as an entity. you can go read it on the reddit thread 4 months ago
---
I don't know if the nip is actually dead or if this is just hyping stuff up but realistically frt have been playing with the limits of that agreement. Between giving skillu a staging to attack legacy/xix and assisting skillu and scourge in attacking Tenerifis they have imo given legacy a reasonable excuse to void the deal. 
---
Again I haven't actually seen anything the explicitly says the deal is dead, in the actual nip it says 
---
"-This NIP does not extend to XiX, but any attacks upon XiX will be viewed as attacks on Legacy for the moment and will be responded to in kind up to and including cessation of this deal. This includes their allies as well."
---
So as far as I can tell legacy may just be forming big to tell frt to stay out of tenerifis or lose the deal, this doesnt nessaceraly mean the nip is dead since tenerifis is a wierd case and open to a little interpretation.
---
So is this invasion like a desperate plea of relevance or like what

Couldnt you just attach an ID to a fleet once it's formed and then attribute everything towards that ID. So if someone in this fleet shows up on a killmail it will also flag that killmail with the fleet ID, giving everybody in fleet ( in system?) credit. Fleet Chat rooms have to work by such an ID already right? It doesnt sound too complicated 
---
I agree, it doesn't sound too complicated, but someone will find a way to complain about something and want their "feature" fixed/implemented. Hence scope creep.

Some of you folks have been brainwashed with this "us and them" culture so much that everyone who disagrees with you is an enemy. Really said to see how dominant it is in Goons.

---
um, i mean i couldnt care less, but theres indeed more enemy caps than ours in total, im not entirely sure what you try to say when saying things like " SC Cap fleet was entirely outnumbering us "
---
The only reason dreads see as much use as they do is because they insure well. They kind of have to, considering that they're just great big suicide-machines on a lot of drops. Big groups could afford to SRP dreads anyway. All this would do is hurt the mid-to-small groups trying to bring dreads out to deal with enemy faxes and supers. 
---
HAW guns were a mistake though. Carriers are already anti-subcap specialists. Dreads don't need to do the same thing, but with less counterplay options, and titans being able to engage subcaps with anything less than a boson is ridiculous. Nerfing capital ships in ways that won't screw everyone over except the people dropping them hundreds at a time is going to be hard. Narrowing the intended roles of the various capital ships would be a nice place to start though. There's too much overlap right now. 
---
\- Carriers, I think, are actually mostly okay. They're anti-subcap specialists, with relatively modest tanks and dps for their cost. Space-superiority fighters also have a genuinely useful niche in bigger battles, where dreads, other carriers and supers are in play, and carrier dps doesn't actually matter. Carriers being able to be defanged is a good thing. They probably should a bit more though. It's kind of weird that a PVP carrier is generally cheaper than a PVP marauder would be.
---
\- Dreads need to lose the HAW guns though. There's no reason for a dreadnought to be able to effectively engage sub-capital ships. That's what carriers do. Redefine dreads to specifically be anti-cap specialists.
---
\- Faxes are their own issue, and I'm less familiar with them, so I'm not even going to try and suggest anything there.
---
\- Supercarriers probably need a bit of a utility nerf, since they're pretty much anti-everything. They hit capital ships like dreadnoughts, but from much longer ranges, and they hit sub-caps perfectly fine as well. Maybe remove their ability to use regular fighters at all, and rebalance the heavies to be less good at dealing with subcaps. Supercarriers are in a weird spot, and I'm not sure how best to deal with them without gimping them too hard, or having them overpower a carrier or dreadnought's intended role. Ideally this utility nerf would handicap their PVE abilities as well, since those are almost exclusively verses NPC sub-caps.
---
\- Titans should be the be-all-end-all of anti-capital warfare. Mega-dreads in battle, that are fleet-support ships outside of battle. Get rid of HAW guns, and don't let them engage sub-caps with anything less than their boson. This would also hurt their PVE abilities some too, since they wouldn't have the HAW guns to prime a haven for the single boson that clears out everything in one go. 
---
There's been a whole lot of role-creep with the introduction of HAW guns, and various buffs supercarriers have gotten over the years.
---
So we should avoid making good suggestions because the devs with fuck it up completely regardless of who's idea the changes are based on?
---
Again, respectfully disagree but we might need to leave it at that I suppose. Yes as a percentage of their wealth a keepstar would be less impactful to the goons then perhaps an astra would be to a tiny group of players. Saying that, the costs of ratariu's is ridiculously low. 
---
The keepstar dying would involve coordinating hundreds of players to evacuate their stuff, and would be significantly more difficult logistically speaking. You're a 10 man group? Sweet, that's only 10 people's stuff you need to move somewhere else, a couple of JF loads. 
---
But for example you say "latter is forced to make drastic changes to keep playing the game". Can you give an example? In my mind that "drastic change" means moving to a new astra 1 jump over, moving to a cheap Raitaru somewhere. Your 10 players can't afford a 500m structure? No problem, perhaps structure ownership is out of reach for you. 
---
Again a symptom of this "eve isn't dangerous" any more is that a certain expectation that every player / group should be able to achieve every thing no matter what. 
---
Sometimes in a dangerous game the fact may be that you can lose something. When did that stop being an acceptable answer?
---
That is because CCP didn't know how to build avatar based content (or an engine for it -which they decided to go for some strange reason). So it was clunky and had shit optimization.
---
Oh and there was also nothing to do other than sit, so you really can't blame people for not using it much.

Back to your fit, if you’re new you’ll want to use either a probe, magnate, imicus, or heron. Leave the high slots empty, except for a cloak (if you’re alpha, ignore the cloak, most times it’s not needed). For the lows, fit two warp core stabilizers, then intertial stabilizers in the rest, if there are more. In the mids, put a relic analyzer, mwd, and rangefinding arrays in the rest. Ignore data sites, they aren’t worth the time.

Now, once you’re in a wormhole, bookmark the entrance. The next first thing you need to do is make a safe spot to scan from, especially if you don’t have a cloak. Warp to a random planet/asteroid/anom, then another, and drop a bookmark halfway between them, and warp to the bookmark. Now just remember to check dscan every so often, and if you see combat probes on it, leave. No one puts combat probes on a peaceful ship, and any pvp ship will be able to kill you. Seeing just a ship should probably also cause you to leave. You are only safe as long as no one finds you. 
---
Now you can start scanning. If the in game tutorial didn’t explain this well, look something up on YouTube, you need to see it happening to understand it, I can’t explain it here. Important thing is that you only want relic sites that are named with a pirate faction in front of it. So, Sansha’s, Guristas, Serpentis, Angel, Blood Raiders, etc. Anything that says forgotten or unsecured in front is a combat site in disguise. 
---
Once you’re there, make sure to keep checking dscan. And don’t worry if you fail the hacks, the easy cans can have just as much loot as the hard ones. You won’t make as much isk until you get your archeology skill up, but it’s still pretty good money. 
---
And sometimes you will die. People camp sites in cloaked ships and will be able to kill you no matter what you do. It’s just a cost of exploring, so make sure to drop your loot off back in hisec every so often, and move it to Jita 4-4 to sell. That system is the biggest market hub in Eve, you’ll get the best prices there
---
Jay teams up with Snuff while his allies get destroyed.
---
When will he join Snuff? Cracks are forming.
---
they dont need it i guess
---
And feed they did. Zero losses for DHSJ
---
I dunno, I remember the nag used to only have 2 guns and had a hull damage bonus not based on skills
---
Arn't all people on twitch weird?
---
market.fuzzwork.co.uk
---
Bless your heart
---
You want to talk balance? Ok here goes.
---
Ban input broadcasting of all kinds, regardless the why.
---
Ban VPN (I thought use was already illegal?)
---
Require anti-cheat software to be installed, which would detect the presence of input broadcasting, botting, or VPN software. 
---
Limit the number of active accounts on a single PC. 
---
Yeah I know some people claim to not be able to pay without a VPN. Sorry, most of us can't play with cheaters. This would be a direct stab at the heart of cheaters, such as botters, and those that use input broadcasting to do stuff like, I don't know, booshing excavators. If people can't bot, that would have an impact on capital proliferation. Either they can no longer do it in their cap, or they can't send off their huge mining fleets with which to build the caps. Fewer caps, fewer rorquals. All the people complaining win.
---
Never enough freedom.
---
On the DHSJ side. We had to rep a cycle or two on our logi every now and then, otherwise our ships weren't being shot at...
---
No idea what was going on haha.
---
No sales recently, and the sale for getting omega with 450 plex made everyone burn their reserves 
---
Since you're not an Economics student of any year, I'll explain. CCP have created a lucrative market for noobs buying Plex. Botting makes ISK so cheap which is what noobs want. Come on, is it that hard to grasp?
---
theyre still in game, but theyre only anti-bomb now
---
Junior feeder
---
You need 800-1000 dps to kill them before the response fleet arrives. A Hecate is the best ship for hunting them in
---
Just bring a jamgu until they counter with a keres
---
Well, there's a first for everything. Have an upvote from me.
---
Play the game, don't AFK 😉
---
Yes.  And you can dock on there as well.
---
Run burners instead. You’ll need just as many accounts, and make so much more ISK. Cool, yeah I was pulling in 4.5bn a month or whatever with my PI toons, but it was an hour of work every 2 days bringing all the PI to all the planets.
---
Now I just run burners for 1bn an hr lol
---
Again, it would only make it so the wealthiest alliances would be to able to do this. It's not a good idea.
---
&gt;The only reason dreads see as much use as they do is because they insure well.
---
you are a idiot, like fo realz
---
&gt;HAW guns were a mistake though.
---
no
---
&gt;Dreads need to lose the HAW guns though. There's no reason for a dreadnought to be able to effectively engage sub-capital ships.
---
Every ship needs to be able to destroy w/e is attackin it. Want to remove haws? Make subcaps unable to attack dreads and tits or better yet, leave the haws as they are.
---
I liked it a lot. But it doesn't add to the existing game, if it had a reason then yeah I'd love it. Part of the reason why I'm taking a long break from eve currently. 
---
[Shadow Cartel POV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjRua8uMFPQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)   
---
there are bits missing cause you killed me in 3 subcaps and i had to reship and stuff ;)
---
GF snuff
---
I’ve lost 1 blingy gila, a 600 mil explo frigate (including loot), a few cheaper explo frigates, from helioses to Astero ms, a few 100 mil clones, more jaguars than I can count, and a few VNIs so far this year, along with a bunch of other stuff I don’t remember. 
---
Only the jaguars on that list were pvp stuff, everything else was meant to avoid other players at all costs. 
---
So, I don’t think you suck, you seem to be doing pretty good at not dying. Maybe you are just flying too expensive of ships, but the amount of deaths itself isn’t bad. 
---
Ships are ammo, remember that. If it pays for itself before it dies it’s still a good investment, don’t expect anything to live forever, even in hisec
---
gf snuff
---
Always a good time to fight snuff, 10/10 would feed to snuff again
---
I had a bug last year where she appeared 3 times for me and just stayed there letting me kill her. Lol it was a pretty nice bounty. But that only happened once out of the 7 years I've played. 
---
You Punny man Wolfs ;)
---
Another problem that exists is the inability of subcaps to outmaneuver caps objective wise. While the current fatigue allows for better movement towards an engagement and encourages engagements more (which is a good thing), it also prevents attackers from hitting another objective because the fatigue timer is too low. There needs to be a system in place where if you jump to defend an objective the jump timer needs to exceed the time it takes to reinforce or destroy another objective. This would allow attackers to use forks ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(chess) ) as a tactic.
---
yes, but you need the right service module for it. you would be better off using the structure that gets bonuses for industry
---
Prob seeking that first win of 2019 tbh
---
Which mechanics will PGL blame this time :hmmm:
---
&gt; input broadcasting to do stuff like, I don't know, booshing excavators. 
---
I literally twitch stream my booshing to shut up morons like you. Lots of videos available on youtube. If you watch you'll notice I don't even use Eve-o preview. Just resized clients. Booshing doesn't evne work with broadcasting. You need to boosh different server ticks to get a 600km chain boosh (else you will get 100km per tick).
---
The sheer ignorance in your post makes me cringe so hard dude. You don't even realize most things you want hurt Goons more than anybody else lol.
---
just go to null then.  nearly as safe as high, lots better rewards.
---
I've already won more fights than I lost in 2019.  And I have TEST's only losses.
---
Looking forward to the weak Legacy FAX numbers
---
They won't be alone and have already previously they fight hard even when outnumbered. They can punch above their numbers  
---
It's pretty strange that hoping for good fights must be a joke to you....... It says more about you than it does about Winterco or Legacy.
---
I remember the nag having 2 guns and 2 torpedo launchers 
---
GF Shadow. I took my corp on a lil roam through your space about 2 weeks ago with a 20 man sleip gang and you guys dropped 30 caps on us instead of coming with subs. Made me salty so I planned a lil bait for you guys :)
---
Asset safety shouldn't exist. 
---
Ftfy
---
Ask around if anyone wants to go with you on a two or three person roam in either assault frigs or faction frigs. 
---
Go somewhere, maybe Geminate if you have an experienced person with you, or maybe wicked creek if you are all fairly new. Use dotlan to find systems people rat in. Fly around, dscan them down, and kill them. If a response shows up that you can fight, shoot it too, but be careful not to get warp scrambled, you want to be able to escape if anything big arrives. 
---
For even smaller scale pvp, take a t1 frigate to faction warfare and look for duels with other t1 frigs. Sometimes you get blobbed, but most of the time you won’t, in my experience. Minmatar/Amarr war zone is probably the best one. Don’t pick a side, just be neutral and you have twice as many targets. 
---
you tackled a carrier, what do you expect  
---
and reagarding the so called bait, everybody saw it coming from miles away
---
While spiced with anger, he did. 
---
Achtually, Customers DO tell us how to do our jobs. Their expectations are what drive EVERY business. 
---
As a paying customer we know what we're looking for in the service we purchase, as we understand what we're using it for.
---
When it comes to food and lets say, cars. There's common ground. everyone knows food should taste and look good. With cars, everyone knows what people would want. When it comes to a game, and a niche game like Eve; less so. It's pretty clear that the people in-charge of development, don't play it. They don't know what issues we're seeing and have less "front line" experience with the imbalances. To say they're doing a bad job goes too far, but they are undoubtedly detached.
---
But I will concede that players are biased to the play style they prefer and their opinions should be considered as such. I personally don't enjoy flying caps and dislike how they're thrown on grid as an "I win" card, so I am biased too. From what I have seen, the issue with caps is their prevalence, and less their implementation. But again, I don't like caps! So my opinion cant be taken objectively.
---
These things don't hurt me, and they don't hurt legitimate players. They would only hurt cheaters and botters. As far as your booshing videos, I watched one you posted on here, really couldn't tell what you were doing, shady or legit.
---
What would be your suggestion?
---
Someone post the checklist 
---
Few comments:  cyno inhibs are right now pretty easy to kill for super carriers and titans.  maybe too easy, especially for a titan who can't get defanged.
---
current cyno inhibs have a 200km anchor radius from each other.  So if a 400km radius, then needs to be a 800km anchor range.
---
This was fantastic.
---
They would hurt your alliance. If you hate cheaters and botters that much, you should probably be upset there are so many of them in it.
---
The Capital Energy Activation "bonus" is really there just so it can use lasers.
---
Are you stupid or just plain retarded? Nobody thinks a small nano gang like that should kill a capital... the argument from the small gang side is (mostly) that a capital shouldn't apply perfectly to subcapitals, with no subcap support of its own.
---
The attempt at narrative is strong with you. 
---
?
---
Each leshak was 1.6-1.8bil*
---
   
---
I think he means in the second engagement you had more dreads, though we had more caps in total due to the carriers.
---
What about dictors, logi ships, hictors, monitors, ceptors? They can't reasonably engage anything attacking them.
---
You guys aren't dumb, you know it was just my lil wh corp and that we had no back up. You could have just brought 30 subs and gotten a fight.
---
If it is true that you saw it all coming then its strange that you would take a fight you knew you would lose 2x more than the other team. I think you didn't really know so much was ready and that you expected to do better. Either way, GF. My corpies got our SC kills so I'm happy with the fleet :)
---
Wow much appreciated! I’m definitely check out that ship and look up some vids to put your write up into context (:
---
It was called firewalling, it used to be a thing. 
---
It is known.
---
Shit useless feature they can show their dev hours worth for while not fixing the actual damn game.
---
Ez win for ccp
---
Implying CCP will change shit.
---
Hilmar probably is like, "Oh, they are in that phase again."
---
*Off to Bahamas for a month*
---
u/Vily_R you are incorrect.   
---
while you guys were too amateur to write a clear document, the below statement from the NIP says it doesn't but also does "extend".
---
\-This NIP does not extend to XiX, but **any attacks upon XiX will be viewed as attacks on Legacy for the moment and will be responded to in kind up to and including cessation of this deal**. This includes their allies as well.
---
Technically, you guys have both been violating the agreement the entire time. Legacy has never ceased camping Frat space while [https://zkillboard.com/br/106714/](https://zkillboard.com/br/106714/) was also a pretty egregious violation.
---
And this entire thread is why I play this game mostly alone. Virginal nerds with mummy issues are ridiculous.
---
it was literally discussed in the first engagement - we even downshipped to something the ravens would fight which was obvious not smart as well  
---
"yeah, that other fleets are def coming for us" hence the disengage and reship for something bigger   
---
wouldnt be the first time that we are not coming out on top of a fight isk wise and wont be the last time, ofc loosing sucks just like for everybody else  
---
yeah, sure mistakes where made, especially with our subcaps but for a straight 2:1 brawl it wasnt so bad at all  
---
fighting outgunned and outnumbered is what lowsec piracy is all about and i kinda miss it  
---
Not a strawman.
---
Spectre/DHSJ/TMOCC/WKEND vs SC *
---
Also battle reports:
---
First engagement: https://br.inyour.space/?s=2539&amp;b=8462640&amp;e=110&amp;t=uvvuuqaeaqaaaaaeaeaaaaer
---
Second engagement: https://br.inyour.space/?s=2537&amp;b=8462700&amp;e=90&amp;t=uvvaaeaaaaaaaaaaaaaqfae
---
Made last night so they might not be super accurate - Should paint the whole picture though.
---
isk is never a good balancing point because all it does it swing more advantage to the bigger groups.
---
Thanks for posting, your tears are delicious
---
It doesn't affect my alliance either. We don't have botters and cheaters in LAWN. And I like my corp, no reason to leave Delve. I don't like cheaters, and I don't like thieves. If you don't like being called a thief, stop stealing. 
---
The problem still boils down to, people not in the Imperium are all Grr Goons, and unhappy that we are doing just splendid down here in Delve. From an outsider's (at the time) point of view, evicting the Imperium from the north was the best thing that could have happened for them, and the worst thing that could happen for everybody else, because it pointed out the glaring flaws in how other big alliances and coalitions are run.
---
I suggest you go poke at the Chinese bear some. They are even more rabid than Goons at dropping caps and supertits on any interlopers. We did a roam up there a while back, in frigates and destroyers (I was in a command dessy) and we bounced around a system our FC got us blocked into lol. They tried to boson us at least three times, and we only lost on T1 frigate. But they dropped on us, and dropped on us again, and dropped on us a third time, before they were able to start whittling us down. We got some of their subcaps until they got us on the run. 
---
And then there was the time we were in a thorax fleet roam. We did really well, and then they had a scout with a cyno that caught up to us through a jump bridge in system, and dropped on us. We still had good fights up to that point. 
---
My suggestion, if you really want to avoid the umbrella, figure out where the umbrella can't go, and target krabbers there. Leave the game development to the devs.
---
&gt; It’s hard to understand what’s happening here
---
This is me reading any post or any video in this sub. Slowly, I am learning some things... although I'm still in the dark 99% of the time.
---
You can also jam them with a falcon or a tengu... oh wait
---
Grey Eagles was with Spectre? What is their relationship?
---
dont brick your char with a carrier then in a dread escalation?
---
OSRS is considerably easier to maintain than Eve just because its combat can be broken down to a literal single formula. Also, there were a ton of thing unbalanced in that game, non-combat wise.
---
OK now we need goons delivering ships to someone whose zKB stats they wanna rek and blowing em up. Go gons luv gons!
---
Needs more Asher
---
Well why are you helping them anyways , not like they are any use for u, and they use as batphone to bluebell u all the time
---
Help put them down I hope.
---
Wow mind blown atm
---
GF to everyone 
---
3:20 at video.. taught 30secs for me...
---
The problem with this is the fact that it hurts casual players the most. Some guy doesn't play for a while and realizes all of his shit is gone won't want to come back. I love the idea of how hardcore this is, but it just doesn't promote good long-term gameplay like people think. 
---
From this picture, we can only see that you currently have no offered mission; this can be because you didn't request a (new) mission yet. Better see what you get when you start a conversation with him. Also keep in mind that you won't get any new missions from a career agent if you decline one of his missions
---
Huh? Bro I was just saying what the other dude meant lol, chill.
---
Camping space refers to the mass cloaky camping campaigns going on by both sides before this nip was draw up, not random roamers. If there is someone doing some camping it's a lot easier to get in contact with diplos or whoever and sort it out then to throw the whole deal out the window. 
---
Also that passage you quoted basically leaves any response to an attack on xix up to legacy. If vily says it doesn't break the nip the the nip isn't broken, and that's ignoring the fact that vily said eastern tenerifis isn't even covered by that part of the deal.
---
Also I think the whole thing is a text agreement across two languages so some confusion is possible, but I think the engilsh version is the primary one.
---
gravitational transportation field oscillator in game, as the other poster said, it teleports supercaptials.
---
Still salty I missed it. 
---
I went to bed after the blueballs on the first astra. guess I missed a bit of drama.
---
Oh, one thing I forgot to mention. If a wormhole says it leads to dangerous or deadly unknown parts of space, it will not have any of the types of sites that you are looking for. You only want to enter wormholes that say they lead to unknown parts of space when you do the show info on them 
---
Lastly, check out the in game channel “Eve-Scout”. That’s Signal Cartel’s public channel, and they are all very nice and helpful. Plus, if you join them, quite a few people will have set you as blue or will SRP your loss if they kill you. You can’t rely on it, and most people will likely just kill you and move on, but it does happen sometimes. 
---
The best way to do pi is to set it up around how much  time you wanna spend. You wanna look at it a short time everyday or a while every few days? Direct to p3 planets is only worth while/feasable(?) in nullsec imho. But pays off better, as long as you can put the time into it everyday. 
---
What's a burner?
---
20-30 min? you guys must be flying T1 fit leshaks. you re really just asking for easy kills on a guy that is alrdy tackled for I don t know how long before even a neutral enters the System and his amazing heavy drones will be removed as soon as they leave the drone bay. A guy who s amazing 1000 dps drones will just easely be repped by 1 dude in a logi ship. So what would you consider an adequate tank time for a rorq against a 20man drekavak / Leshak fleet? I don t really see the appeal of sitting in a belt with an expensive capital waiting for the daily tourist gang to murder you, when yes you have no proper means to fight back. You re just after a riskfree expensive kill because it s called an industrial ship. why don t you grow a pair and go fight some people who can shoot back and tackle?
---
Yeah so you just must not fly caps or something. People drop caps all the time now on smaller gangs. It's very safe. The only reason many in the big groups don't is because it would actively discourage subcap fights, which no one really wants. That does not correlate to "caps cant drop on fleets anymore" at all. Every single time we jump ratters in goon land we get supers and titans. 
---
What stopped people from dropping caps pre-phoebe was the escalation impact. If you dropped a titan and 2 nyx's to save some retard in a rorq, you did knowing full well that BL or some edgelords would be there somewhat soon to counter drop and kill your shit. If those hands started to move (and likely you would be paying attention) your options were to up the scales and drop more or evac out. Now, you just drop shit and don't worry at all comparatively.  
---
Please stop pushing this false narrative if you weren't around for this shit. 
---
Please allow me to try and explain this to you.  
---
Do you enjoy PVP? Do you miss the days when Eve was dangerous?  
---
Then this game isn't for you anymore. CCP doesn't care about you, and probably doesn't especially want you around. They want a nice quiet PVE oriented game full of quiet, risk adverse carebears who are happy to shoot rocks and mine NPCs. The changes implemented over the last few years have almost all benefited that playstyle and I expect that future changes will continue along those lines.
---
2014
---
enjoyed the fight dudes! win or lose, looking forward to the next one! fly dangerously
---
Seems like it was a day for friendly violence.
---
hard to not be completly green when you show up with 3 dudes to a 230man fight v0v
---
Very constructive... 
---
I managed ot watch 1 minute of this video. I now have ebola.
---
&gt;unfortunately the dread can volley subcaps so fast off the field that you re basecly forced to jump in other capital ships to kill the dude
---
spoken like someone who has never actually flown a HAW dread. I'm yolo machine with my HAW rev. 
---
Here is an actual BR where I engaged 30 ferox before they jumped in 2 dreads to neut me. Notice my 3 dank frags. Until horde turned up it was my rev vs all of them.

ARE YOU POSTING THAT AUDIO WITHOUT MY WRITTEN CONSENT?  GET READY FOR THE TEXAS HAMMER!!!
---
when they introduced the door and announced plans to develop proper walking in stations experience, a lot of players reeeed and said they don't give a toss about walking in stations, they want new ships, balance etc instead. so ccp canned it, and eventually removed the door cause by itself it didn't make much sense.
---
and not many people used that environment cause it was hogging resources like crazy.
---
now i wish they would also remove the advertisement board in stations, it's fucking annoying
---
The Grey Eagles are the wormhole corp im the CEO of. We have guys who like to fly spec and I FC for spec too, thats why you see lots of grey eagles in my raven fleet :)
---
&gt;Why do we want capital changes? 
---
because we're bored of whining about bots, so capitals are the salt factory du jour.
---
"responsible" is wrong here. CCP is responsible for each account in  Eve, botter or not, so CCP is responsible for 100% of the botters. 
---
It's just a useless tautology that you can discard as easily as you write it.
---
That's a high IQ play right there.
---
u wat
---
This is the only reason I had capital missiles trained. All gone now thankfully!
---
They already have the fixed cost of servers.  Adding more is by definition cheaper than having dedicated hardware rented from someone else.
---
The big benefit to AWS is when you have high variance in the amount of resources you need.  That doesn't really apply here.
---
PI is underrated by most, its solid income and most of the effort goes into the setup after which its mostly passive.              
---
            
---
I used to run P2 planets and then a p2 to p4 factory, usually doing the logistics whilst on structure bashes.            
---
The more effort you put in the better your return but even a lazy p1 setup earns well enough to keep you from having to grind havens 
---
吃瓜看戏,你们继续.
---
for everything they develop like this there is a risk of breaking something.
---
also the same people doing this would instead work on something that is more relevant.
---
if something already works very good, even if you have to use out-of-game resources like zkillboard, it's just not worth to do it
---
Zkillboard has trophies or something, cant remember the name but basically kill lots of everything
---

I don’t have one because I’m not a dev lmao

EvE with WIS is ST: O

What can you realistically do with those? For reference, I normally fly a triple anvil rep jaguar to make sure I can tackle stuff and stay alive long enough for backup. With t1 I feel like I would not only feed, but feed without accomplishing anything. 
---
And?
---
Also biomassing isn't as impressive as you think it is, you can get them unbiomassed by ccp. If you really wanted to show you were not coming back you would sell all the characters and trash the isk.

---
Thanks for playing, always sad to see a player go but hey, you had fun I hope and left an impact in New Eden. 
---
I would advise you to ask CCP with a petition for your characters back though. Many former EVE players get an urge to play EVE again at somepoint, and it is a is a small blow to start from 0 again.
---
Eve is a sinking ship, get out while you can.
---
Needs more photoshop
---
Well the profit margin in highsec is bad anyways , and since prices of minerals were way lower back in the days and and people still mined in highsec .

---
You and the other people's attitude and aggressiveness causes what we call polarization, you are doing more bad than good for your cause like this sweetie. 
---
Now please keep your ideas for yourself and your pubescent friend group. 
---
&gt;Yeah so you just must not fly caps or something.
---
I own two carriers and a dread.
---
&gt;Please stop pushing this false narrative if you weren't around for this shit.
---
I've been playing since 2005.  I bought my first capital in 2010.  I was around for it.
---
&gt; People drop caps all the time now on smaller gangs. It's very safe. The only reason many in the big groups don't is because it would actively discourage subcap fights, which no one really wants.
---
People drop caps all the time now on smaller gangs like that *inside their own space*, usually within a single jump's range of capital staging.  
---
Because backup takes much longer to arrive if something goes wrong outside of that range, because of jump fatigue.
---
Let's say you've found a super/titan that's doing shit slightly outside of one jump range of his capital staging, and decide to dread bomb him with 10 dreads the next time he does it.  Jump fatigue means when it goes down you have around 3-5 minutes before any serious help can arrive after the rageping goes out, and mid cynos are ready.
---
Without jump fatigue, you have the time that FAX's/supers can undock, jump once, dock/undock for cap and jump again.  ***Approximately 30 seconds per jump.***  A Keepstar network would allow supers to move faster than they ever have in EVE's history.
---
Without jump fatigue, the capital umbrella range gets larger, and more powerful as it allows capitals from further away get to the fight much quicker.  And it makes super fleets that much more oppressive and required to have over subcapitals.
---
As far as I'm concerned, after Rorquals and super/titan docking was introduced, Jump fatigue is the only thing keeping super-cap proliferation from turning from a big problem into a straight up nightmare.
---
PI with weekly cycle and lots of storage, reset extractors once a week and empty the planets once a month.

Ship losses don't hurt if you make OK isk.

Sometimes it can be profitable to buy things in Jita, have them shipped via JF to Geminate and sell them at O-VW. As a completely brand new player it might be a little tricky, especially because you don't understand the market well, how it works, or why certain modules may go up/down. If you want the try space trucking you can always do it in HS.
---
I recommend doing it from an NPC corp, never take contracts with a collateral larger than 100million ISK, or of a volume larger than what you can hold in your ship. See also Markeedragon's guide to hauling. On YouTube. Can't find link.
---
happy chinese new year!
---
if you're never coming back, may as well RMT that shit in to the sunset. 
---
if you're never coming back, the repercussions are irrelevant.
---
Yep.
---
We just need more capital warfare, to keep up with mineral production 
---
Gee, look who never left hisec.
---
Yup i like it too, seeing how much isk i have ratted , then being depressed after looking at my actual wallet and wondering where it all went...
---
Have your main game on the big screen. And stretch to the smaller. Whatever is outside the screen is lost space anyway... Since you're using it for extra windows. 
---
Also, exploration is probably a much better way to make ISK. If you really want/need help, ask around in standing fleet (I'm assuming you're in Horde) for some help/handout ships.
---
Says a person who hides behind the anonymity of the internet. 
---
Dude! Get your butt to null. Go from there. Even with an alt if you have to. I recommend Horde (for obvious reasons).
---
Did you make a contract to yourself?
---
Had a Russian do the "get away twice" bit in an Astero because Heretics are still terrible dictors. Good laughs were had after I finally said fuck it when I realized he had an A-Type rep fit.
---
Fuck it. Do what we do with T3C lose some sp lol
---
Can you share this spreadsheet? I want to learn from it, it looks amazing
---
Well and blueballs are blueballs , I wouldn’t be happy joining a fleet all the time for nothing 
---
Sort of like you guys and NC.
---
I did enjoy watching them take their frustration out on ART0N earlier, tho, after you got them all excited about our capitals and then failed the tackle.
---
And it's still the best sov system to date. It's the capture mechanics surrounding it that are shit. Entosis should be removed. Just let it be the alliance with the most structures in system owns it or something organic like that. 
---
thank you very much  .   也祝你：合家欢乐，万事大吉。年年有今日，岁岁有今朝。

U dont. 1 hyena is enough. And 4 paints is luls to bring 
---
&gt;i think you are still retarded!!
---
 i think you are still retarded!! 
---
CCP using it to figure out how to monetize the game more. Suprised when they released how much they said they have never been able to track in game about what players were doing.
---
PM me your address dude
---
What turned me off SGU is the mandatory character drama every show is apparently supposed to have. I get that it's a shitty situation and people behave unexpectedly, but you could almost see the parts they cranked up the good ol' yelling for the sake of yelling. Same reason I can't watch The Expanse, despite adoring the books. It's an overdramatic parody of the characters.
---
thats literally the price now
---
Highsec mining already dead except for bots (thank god tbh it was terrible for content)
---
Never go full batuka
---
You are an idiot
---
Yep the best way to get a super/titan is a yearly subscription to Netflix.
---
“Init brought ruptures”
---
What a time to be alive. 
---
Accepted it on one of my chars ... relisted 1bil more. 
---
Sold in 20min. 
---
so i cant cloaky camp their bots yet =(
---
I wonder if they let goons know about strat pap coming...
---
lmao horde forms 100 BATTLESHIPS and then stands down in the face of our goon BATTLECRUISERS and DESTROYERS, can you imagine being that much of a pussy????? karmafleet is recruiting hordelings 
---
My guess is it was a very quick flash form and you were hurry so you didn't check fuel and fit, ect?
---
This was amazingly done
---
nah,its "economic" mode :P
---
teach me your ways senpai 
---
Iam truly satisfied 
---
They can be on mic, unless you're like guard and will have a voice that the players know
---
Flair doesn’t check out?
---
They kinda do since you can just open a ticket and CCP will give your wasted SP.
---
Just two coalitions having pvp fun, nothing wrong with that
---
No FRT involved in the bridge kill, though
---
Ace - Titan  
---
King - Super  
---
Queen - Carrier  
---
Jack - Dread  
---
After that, the numbered cards can go in reverse size order, so that each symbol on the card would be increasingly numerous and smaller as the card number increases. (Eg the 10 of Minmatar is a swarm of 10 Rifters, while the 2 of Minmatar is a pair of Vargurs)
---
10 - Rifter / Comet / Merlin / Slicer  
---
9 - Hound / Nemesis / Manticore / Purifier  
---
8 - Sabre / Eris / Flycatcher / Heretic  
---
7 - Vagabond / Ishtar / Eagle / Zealot  
---
6 - Rapier / Lachesis / Rook / Curse  
---
5 - Tornado / Talos / Naga / Oracle  
---
4 - Sleipnir / Eos / Vulture / Damnation  
---
3 - Panther / Sin / Widow / Redeemer  
---
2 - Vargur / Kronos / Golem / Paladin
---
Can you IMAGINE how much your LIFE depends on this game????
---
Maybe it was sarcasm in its purest form. 
---
Maybe you git flairbaited.
---
He is right tho, never heard of that either.
---
I didn't know that, so thanks for the info. However, I believe we can both agree automating it would simplify the process by a fair bit :)
---
My thoughts about PGLs (or insert name here) inability to stand up against umbrellas and bemoaning their entitlement to nerf it for their own sub cap orientated griefing benefits aside... My 2 cents on this latest push is simply this:
---
**Just delete cynos.** Give jump capable ships the ability to jump to any celestial object (system / star / planet / moon / belt / gate / NPC station / structure) within their respective jump ranges by themselves but force them to spawn anywhere within 150 km - 500 km of that object at random. A jump capable ship entering or exiting a system should (for the few seconds its in the process of jumping) create a warp-able anomaly directly on that ship that should pop up on your overview as per the preexisting jump mechanics, to allow everybody in the system to either give chase (unlikely you'll catch it if its on its way out) or to intercept (more likely since it'll have to align and warp somewhere after landing on grid (in much the same ways sub caps can jump through star gates and land tackle on something on the other side). I wouldn't be opposed to Aura announcing the detection of jumpdrive signatures for the few seconds those anomalies are visible either ;). This also serves to alert players in the system of incoming capital fleets should local and your cloaky eyes on gates not be a dead giveaway (the same way cyno beacons on the overview does presently) by giving them 1-5 minutes before anything larger actually hits the grid where the action is going off.
---
This forces supers / caps to warp to the grid / regroup at the target / a rendezvous point before they can become a blobby problem (with the exception of doomsdays if the Titan spawns close enough - but lets face it, if a lone Titan doomsdays all on its own, that should be your target to begin with anyway) and "project their presence unto lesser mortals", which is the whole premise of these suggested "fixes" to what most consider "a legit gameplay fml factor" anyway.
---
**This will in my yet untested / unchallenged opinion:**
---
1) Instantly nerf umbrella force projection on a dime while still allowing umbrellas to exist in some shape or form.
---
2) Renders the demand / "subjectively perceived need" for spool ups of jump drives null and void (because its a stupid concept anyway and deserves to die in a fire).
---
3) Create opportunities for meaningful sub cap interception of capital ships / supers entering / leaving a system without the fuss about travel safety for supers / caps using preexisting jump / structure tethering mechanics.
---
4) Lead to greater chances of killmails for coordinated groups / gangs / fleets because of 3).
---
5) Remove the instant savior effect of jumping FAXes onto tackled caps, while still allowing FAXes to get to the troubled soul (even if it is 1 at a time) at a more delayed rate - which leads to more exciting times game play wise.
---
6) Pretty much remove the insta-delete use of dreadbombs, while still allowing staggered dreadbombs at a delayed rate.
---
7) Carriers will be carriers.
---
8) Supercarriers will be supercarriers.
---
Let the salty responses of those who demand to be able to jump directly to fleet members forever more and refuse to consider this idea flow like lava from an angry volcano with IBS.
---
a .exe file isn't mechanics :thonk:
---
Well I mean provi is 2nd place in batphoning even already outnumbering 2:1 , so why not.. only Test is worse vOv , I mean I kinda curious how you still get snuff and siege green and test always form for u , even u blueball them all the time , so u pay them ? 
---
Would my Avatar wear pants side ways or long ways? 
---
Go to bed
---
is there a list of all the junk items somewhere?            
---
like the expired srp request and things like that
---
damn i thought the wyverns were gonna be the only supers at fuck all prices
---
Kind of hard to tackle them when you jump the whole fleet out the moment reds enter local. That archon was the slow buffalo.
---
Aye out numbers were complete shit tbh, still, was fun, only had a few hours notice to form rip. Weekends Op.
---
Or dreads should have a very specific role that they're good at, and require support to do that job. When they were first introduced, dreadnoughts were the siege engines of EVE. They were the trebuchets, the catapults, the artillery support. You used to them to tear down structures, and to kill other capital ships. If infantry runs up to your siege artillery, there's not a thing it can do about it. Defending itself against infantry is not what it's designed to do, so you need to deploy infantry assets of your own to keep it safe.
---
Dreadnoughts being able to be refit to become super-battleships and stomp all over sub-caps is not a good thing. Dreadnoughts are significantly tankier than carriers, and there's very little counterplay to them besides having half a dozen bhaalgorns on hand, or getting the hell off grid. You can't jam them, you can't defang them, and half the dreads will still keep the guns firing even if you do neut them to nothing. If dreads want to engage sub-caps, at least force them to gimp their fit with extra tracking mods and bring a few vindicators, like the old days. Narrow, defined roles is a good thing. It forces people to use the right ship for the job, and lets more ships see play. 
---
Part of the reason capital ships are so oppressive nowadays is because they can basically do everything, with minor refitting, and have very little downside. Arguably the only downside is cost, and that's not even much of a factor in the age of afk VNI ratting, or carrier ratting, or super ratting, or rorqual mining. The playerbase is individually more wealthy than it's ever been (which is good! More income means more people putting ships into space), but between capital ships being so multi-purpose, and injectors making it trivial to get into one nowadays, yeah, of course people are going to be spamming capitals and super-caps everywhere. 
---
in utter disbelief you clicked the next node to be sure? :)
---
800m/s @ 100km is very low angular velocity, right?
---
If I remember right there was a way to get any video you had the file for to play on the monitor
---
Because anyone would be likely to be scared of eve players in real life....? 
---
what a meme of a statement
---
cost is literally one of the most important balancing factors in the game
---
that being said, it shouldn't be the sole balance of the game, but goddamn you're delusional if you think COST isn't one of the main balance factors in this game
---
&gt; at 100km+
---
There's your problem. Increased range reduces makes you 800m/s near meaningless. You're sig would be the more important factor, and bombers (particularly your shield tanked ones) have the sig of destroyers.
---
So the fact that the Biggest ship in the game can perfectly track the smallest in the game looks ok to you? The problem in that sentence in the range?
---
Now that\`s quality play style! This is REAL EvE!
---
As I said, shield tanked bombers aren't anywhere close to the smallest ship in the game. A ships "size" is determined by it's sig radius as far as turrets are concerned.
---
you're hoping CCP to revamp the entire concept of PvE in the game? because all of it is un-engaging and un-interactive with different difficulty settings... all of it. might as well play a different game.
---
You're not understanding game mechanics. Tracking improves with distance. So you either need to stay outside max range (not practical if you want to do anything.) Or get close and do damage.
---
And let's address the issue of "Balance" here for a moment. Yes a Titan can take down several tiny ships coming in to get them. That's because it costs more than a swarm of the little bastards. It should be 20 or 30. They're tiny little suicide bombers flown by immortal pilots.
---
I undestand that. But skirmish links ease up on that efect. and while ab on gives you no extra sig radius but good speed. A bomber with AB on and Skirmish links should about 55-57 sig radius. Large guns and even some medium one have trouble to track that but HAW guns do.
---
I've never been more glad CCP doesn't listen to this sub's design suggestions. It's like you lot don't think for even a second before you post.
---
i don't think you understand how angular velocity works. 
---
nah, however they should stop giving people SP when its their fault that they didn't get it. 
---
You shouldn't get a reward for not logging in.
---
Navy ships do make sense on paper however Titan "lore wise" or whatever bullshit IS an actual military flagship or whatever, it already is a "navy" ship.
---
&gt;imo
---
tell that to the sales department...
---
I know tracking and range work together. My point was that long range ammo has tracking penalty. Long range ammo should track worse then short range. An Avatar with Sansha Radio XL or Scorch XL, in my opinion, should not track an AB frigate no matter the range.
---
&gt;What I have done, is comparable to, say, militarizing North Korea
---
Perhaps more like militarizing China?
---
there's been suspicion that occasionally ccp sells seized plex, or buys it with seized rmt isk, to influence the market
---
the only thing they've confirmed is that they do hang on to that stuff
---
I don't think maintenance is really an issue in EVE. 
---
I do understand how angular velocity and transversal velocity work. But i still don't think HAW titans with long range ammo should track that. Also if you are at range you will die if you go close you will get webbed and die or Bosoned. And this is why everytime we go in several regions is titan drop after titan drop on frigates and destroyers
---
The factory must grow
---
What? Did you even read my comment before you  posted? 
---
&gt; not knowing what alliance your random reddit account belongs to
---
He should talk to Brisc Rubal about that
---
Overview-&gt;Settings-&gt;Columns-&gt;Tabs-&gt;Angular Velocity/Transversal
---
what is this the 3rd launcher of the last 4 years
---
seriously
---
It has nothing to do with "not logging in". I am logging in regularly, I just plan my skill plans in advance for 6 months or so with proper remapping, and if I am not there when that queue is over for whatever reason then I lose skill points cause there is no skill in queue.
---
Ya, that's what happens when you kill their bots. :)
---
It has everything to do with logging in.
---
Should you get xp in an mmo just because you had planned to be grinding that day but couldn't log in for some reason? 
---
If you have no way to log in during those six months and add another month or so inn your skillq, then you don't really deserve the sp.
---
Let me answer that question with another question.
---
How hairy is your neck? 
---
Frigates are made to die my friend. That's what they do. They die in vast numbers so that expensive toys can't escape.
---
How long did it take until realized? :)
---
[See for yourself](https://i.imgur.com/6QtHxru.png). Pulse HAWs have roughly half the tracking of Large Pulse Lasers. They do, however, have significantly higher base range and damage. This means they can have ranges of 100km+ and even grazing shots do significant damage relative to the tank of a bomber.
---
Tracking isn't the issue, it's the range you were engaged at. Nerfing the tracking won't help.
---
Its amazing.  
---
Its horrible.
---
Its funny.
---
Its sad.
---
Its hard to grasp why.  
---
Its easy to understand why.  
---
All of that at the same moment ...
---
idk did you try google
---
800 m/s at 100 = 400 m/s at 50 = 200 m/s at 25
---
Can you even read what I said? I just explained that I log in regularly, and plan for the long term, meaning I don't check daily how my skills are doing. So even if I know roughly when I'll have to add some more for another 6 months, I can end up missing a week due to external factors. And Eve is different than many MMO as the skill points continue to accrue even without being online, which is why they reimburse when players are missing some. So better implement the system directly instead of having to reimbure SPs to dozens of players every day.
---
in the jump tunnel he knew he fucked up
---
XP in other mmo's isn't real-time based.
---
&gt;&gt; east tenerefis isn't covered under our NIP
---
&gt;"east tenerifis" doesn't exist in the "document".
---
Yeah because it's not covered...
---
it literally says when you log in how many days are left of training.
---
&gt;I can end up missing a week due to external factors (cause you know, life)
---
Yes. This is how life works, sometimes it comes before gaming. You shouldn't get an award for it. 
---
Can I have your stuff??
---
not the point. 
---
A gf without Snuff in sight? Who'd thunk it (obvious sarcasm is obvious)
---
And yet CCP reimburse them, according to SwordlessBunny. Meaning they themselves believe we should get skill points for the time we are subscribed/paying for the game, not based on whether or not we are available to add more to the skill queue or if we are actively playing.
---
Please be a bit more open. Not everyone has availabilities like you, but that shouldn't put them at a disadvantage just for that reason. I used to work in remote locations for months in end, and even if people were unhappy when they extended the duration of skill queue years ago, that allowed me to keep playing without being behind in SPs compared to my friends.
---
CCP don't touch abyssal PvP. I like dragging people down with me.
---
Oh yes, soo your alliance can finally use those trillions in minerals for something right?
---
&gt;My youtube channel will now show Star Citizen videos 
---
lol
---
You forgot the "500" in front of Bttlecruisers...
---
supers are like 8b mineral cost, titans are about 38b. its really fuckin dumb
---
I do very much agree with you that null ratting, right now, is too safe. Especially for capitals. But the solution is not a you-loose-button on a comparatively short timer. Of course, the timespan is arguable, but it would be very hard to get it to a point where the defender has a real fighting chance, and the attackers have a good chance of securing the kill.
---
Also, Goons. When you give attackers a tool to disrupt farming in a region consistently, even securing them a good number of kills, that can get very oppressive. Especially in big blob vs small blob scenarios. 
---
It is also very hard to justify why the substantial amount of resources invested for a capital umbrella should not provide a high degree of safety.
---
I think the biggest problem is FAX. It's very hard to counteract even 2-3 FAX on field in subcaps. So maybe cap umbrellas should not be limited in the amount of *combat*ships they can bring in, but rather in the amount of *support*ships. Commiting a whaling fleet and having caught a capital should gurantee the kill of at least the initial target. On top of that, maybe remove T3 death penalties. 
---
Care to explain how this is a bad idea instead of knee jerking at my allegiance? Structures are the backbone of sov infrastructure now. It makes sense that whoever owns the majority of the structures in a system is by definition the occupier of the system.
---
When a system is attacked the structures are a natural point of contention and will either be transferred to the victor during peace negotiations or be destroyed. Either way the attacker will have then own the majority of structures in the system and thus claims the system. It's a very natural capture mechanic.
---
It obviously needs balance mechanics of some description to counter structure spamming as a viable defense, but the core idea is solid and works in tandem with occupancy based sov.
---
I did that once, I still came back...
---
ScamCitizen. Good choice. Look forward to you returning so that Scooter can make some ISK off you, as you playing that proves you are an easy mark.
---
How do you propose to account for the fact that training speed and therefore SP accrual is based on char attributes and the skills being trained?
---
Spoiler: You can't
---
Considering the omega skill queue is unlimited, there's not really any excuse for not having enough in your queue to make sure you're training something.
---
If you plan a 6 month queue then don't let it run down to 0 before queueing the next block!
---
ahh the old run to reddit approach to diplomacy.
---
I suppose if you lost anything and just asked it would be sorted. thou doesn't help that you are sometimes friend and sometimes foe.
---
at current you are listed as hostile to provi and pershaps someone not in fleet saw a large red force on the "jumpgate".
---
but then hey, i suppose internet points matter more than anything else these days so here is an upvote for u
---
Considering the past two years of posting, claiming hypocrisy may not be wise.
---
It's not really there for veteran players. It's easy enough to turn it off, particularly on alts.
---
It's a way of getting newbies into trying stuff out, and to keep hold of the 'achievement unlocked!' type player for long enough to hook them. I think it's quite well designed for that.
---
Wow this is a really good idea actually
---
At any given time the game knows those information. They are displayed in the skill tab, along with your clone state and your attributes. That's how the game outputs your SP/hr and gives you an ETA on your current skills.
---
When it comes to attributes, they only make a difference when learning a skill with that attribute. They don't affect the SP/hour accrued, and there fore the total score can be used instead of the individual attributes score. Right now mine is 115 and that is what CCP is using when I applied the 50,000 SPs they granted us during Christmas.
---
You normally start a hack by clicking a path and you're not expecting to hit that on the first node!
---
I never pilot a capital.
---
But what role does dreads fill that a carrier doesnt?
---
How much there?
---
moonlight
---
Critical ihub defense uhmm, does anyone with half a brain really believes it ? What batphones you dunces? This timer was only real in your minds.
---
Guess after being dunked all of January legacy needs a win and since  they don't have the balls to go after bluetrals that ganked them like init or snuff they have to content for the next best thing.
---
I suspect the "for the moment" part in your bolded excerpt was intended to mean that XIX was only covered during the initial withdrawal. After that they get to be their own strong coalition that don't need no Legacy. 
---
I’m taking bets as to whether or not CCP_Falcon will post in this thread.
---
You must he traumatised or something. Feeding and you still find a way to reeeeeee snuff.
---
😬
---
Fun story, I was kind of trolling local in kbp the other day with aedun and asked him if he enjoyed korean barbecue (which is delicious and a gift to the world). I guess he took it seriously.
---
How profitable can that be per month per character in null? 
---
The problem is how much do should you get? There is no fixed sp rate.
---
Obviously misunderstood the word sarcasm.
---
Honestly don't mind feeding if a good fight took place.
---
Which is nowadays just an isk sink with injectors... 
---
If there will be less build of them then minerals will me much cheaper. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/bOiOc2z.png
---
Htp sux :P
---
Well the sp/h is calculated per skill you train tho, changing attributes is not changing a flat sp/h rate. But yea your idea is so niche barely anyone would be affected so I don’t care. If it’s easy to do and it helps a few ppl sure go for it I guess. But yea don’t give it max sp/h rate or it’s easily a usable.
---
Your overview settings are weird. I can't even see what system you are in, nice screenshot though.
---
The players asked for occupancy-based sov. Is anyone complaining about high ADMs?
---
What people hated were specific capture mechanics that were entirely CCP's idea. Some of the issues with that were eventually fixed or improved, some are still completely out of whack (anom spawns...), but the one thing you never hear people complain about is the core concept of being rewarded for using your space. 
---
have you seen the chat servers 
---
I agree and think the conclusions you draw are reasonably logical. I personally come to a different conclusion and think that EVE has always traditionally been the more hardcore MMO, so if you're going to appeal to a niche then do it right and your loyal fanbase will continue to play and bring in new blood. 
---
If you try and go too far into the middle of the road you become mediocre at everything and it doesn't appeal strongly to any particular demographic. 
---
I think it's reasonable to say a lot of veterans are getting fed up with the direction it's going. But I also think it's logical to say that a lot of them drive much of the content newer players enjoy. Will there still be that large casual market playing when there is no events / politics / wars / pvp / sov changes going on? 
---
I just can't see the casual players sticking around too long if the core engine of the "sandbox" isn't being driven by the more hardcore players. 
---
sounds like the person who fired it already reached out to Siege Green and is trying to make amends/pay for the losses. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** Your-Neighbor! ^(hug)
---
What I meant is that points can be assigned to different categories, but the total number remains the same for a given set of implants. Therefore the SP/hr for that total number is the same no matter what, and that's what you should get out. And if that is too hard to implement, as i said, just give XP based on the time the player was not training using a 0 implants base character.
---
anti-cap dps
---
hiding shitposting behind sarcasm doesn't make you smart, it just means you're too scared to say what you really want to say.
---
reee snuff tho
---
Not allowing mjd/mwd for 2-5 minutes is a bit much for a 80k ehp battleship. If you have to get reasonably close the Titan would just boson you with zero counterplay on your end.
---
See, Gitzo! That feature even depresses you! Stay away from it! ;)
---
You mean forcing the fighters to shoot the squishiest ship in the gang isn't useful?
---
Literally the only reason people use anything other than carriers, rorqs and dreads.
---
Titans and supers should not be allowed to dock. People dont realize that this is the most massive shit that ever happened toeve and caused the absolute out of control super/titans spam.
---
We need harder mechanisms to avoid massive of supers/titans spam construction. Some kind of extra multiplier for those hulls, to increasce their costs. A very few systems can be used to build hundreds of them every month. These little shits are fuckin the whole game so badly.
---
well my guess is, it worked to good. the new one will have more legacy code.
---
nuhuh
---
Why do you do that to yourself?
---
:(
---
Is that the chinese equivalent of

If this was their intent we would get skill points even if we didn't have anything inn queue.
---
Its a shit idea, you see that by response, and it won't happen
---
I'm US military. If I am going on deployment I would definitely take some time to courier all my shit out of null before I disappeared for a year. If you afk for a year and come back and whine that your shit is gone, you're the only reason that that's happened.
---
Make Null Sec interesting again, remove asset safety.
---
Not to mention the fact that you literally don't even need to jump an umbrella response to kill a marauder.... Just a single cap gun dread to 1 shot it, and even if your dread dies loot will srp it.
---
Right but how do you cater for single account players at the launcher level exactly?
---
I’m not sure what your gripe is, but dev time spent on the launcher does not equate to dev time spent elsewhere; the team will have focused on the primary QoL improvements they could make on their project level, and will have done that. vOv
---
If you linked a direct image, then people on mobile could even decipher the text...

Pretty accurate tbh

but then he would need to do something more than 2 times a year, can't ask that from someone wanting to play a game

This goes for every launcher ever.

I know why you wish you could go back. In your memories, you have a friend in PIBC leadership, right? Hold on a sec, he has been kicked out of leadership permanently. LMAO XDXDXD
---
At the risk of being trolled....a fortnight is a period of time in this post...not that stupid child’s game that’s all the rage with preteens.
---
Lost 3 hrs today cause a alt finally finished his plan and the main needed to start again. I would find this useful. It is extremely niche market/problem. I don't think they ever will. Mine was due to getting stuck at work rather then forgetting (boss wanted me on OT). I wouldn't mine a 50k so limit accrued to "free so". Just to give you a day or two of needing to log in and sort it.
---
So that the driving force behind super fleets is even moreso who can field the most rorqs under an already-present super umbrella? Lol. Awful idea.
---
ok
---
before you start use the glamorex boosters one of each to significantly cut your effort then tags and cosmos missions will be your friends, do the amar ones as well
---
The truly disingenuous part of the whole discussion is the underlying attitude of "everyone should have to work very, very hard and grind for everything - except for me and my killmails"
---
Life is a game
---
1. Skill Rorqual
---
2. Join Goonswarm
---
3. Mining 23/7
---
Eh. To be honest most of the time allowing supers and titans to dock won't make a difference. It's common to have a dedicate character for those ships which can simply log off in deadspace when you don't want them. 
---
Dude, I'm not gonna argue any longer with you. I stated how I play (regularly) and why this would be good to both bridge a gap and avoid filling tickets to CCP.
---
Now if you want to stay stuck in your "gnnnn skilling afk gnnnnn play 2 times a year" then that's your problem. That's completely off topic and has nothing to do here, since that's not what's happening.
---
I really like the BLOPs being able to shut down cynos. Could also be a niche for T3Cs, or a variant of it (weaker version?)
---
Yeah I don't really see why depots get a ref timer when MTUs don't.
---
Don't forget the cruelties conducted by CCP against Uigur people.
---
Exactly! You are a regular player but once in a while this shit happens. Wouldn't hurt to have it implemented by default, that's all I'm saying, even if it is used once or twice by each player only. A quality of life improvement of some sort :)
---
&gt; Kill someone without using your hands (this one’s called “the judge” 
---
I did this in null, with an unarmed explo frig. A friendly warped in the ghost site just as I was leaving it. Still got the killmail.
---
I see your point and normally I’d agree, but EvE isn’t like other mmos. Skill points (exp) are gained by time. It is not from killing enemies or grinding levels. I’m not sure how you don’t see its relation to the topic. 
---
Why not just put more skills in queue?
---
Last message to you here, cause you seem to be stuck in your own world.
---
CCP does reimburse the SP when you missed some, therefore it is their intent. Just that currently it is dependent on the player doing a ticket, and by implementing it it would make it simpler for everybody.
---
Also learn to argument. Saying someone's idea is shit is your right, but never leads anywhere. You can not agree with me, but that doesn't mean you should shit on the rest of the world. Cause from now on you'll take on your own.
---
Read main post please before asking something that was mentioned there.
---
Or when interceptors could fit entosis links for like 2 years
---
even though the test run on Sisi showed CCP that this was a bad idea
---
and everyone said - before fozziesov was introduced on TQ - that trollceptors would be mega aids
---
and CCP still took fucking forever to nerf it
---
There's a ton of changes that any reasonable game company would roll out in about 48h that take CCP 12-24 months to wrap their heads around. 
---
If you run full p2 planets with maxxed skills, roughly 100-150mil per toon per week. Depends on product, courrier fees, etc
---
Sadly, it is mostly true.
---
It took multiple sprints for them to keep up, even if there was no change to it. I think it was more due to resources. Also they use a metric of the default view and it was really low, so they thought it was not being used at all.
---
Very true. There's also the fact that all the tedium that is proposed is a thing that the proposer in question will never himself have to experience. Combine this with the expectation of infinite organizational capacity and competence and we have a recipe for seriously awful opinions.
---
No, it would make a massive difference.
---
Its annoying as fuck to have a spare alt for any super/titan that you own.
---
Not everybody have alts/many alts 
---
because its a bad thing if he has to do it more than twice a year
---
&gt;Also, fuck you. Wanting to krab is a valid gameplay choice. I get that you're socialized to view it as a morally corrupt pursuit, but that isn't actually the way it is.
---
Why dont we all just krab and stop pvping then, that would be awesome!!!!
---
sounds like a plan
---
its laughable easy to just drop astras everywhere 
---
No one should touch cyno mechanics 
---
If cyno prevent you from getting safe pvp - it's your fucking sexual problem))
---
Why's everything gotta be in extremes like that? The two can coexist.
---
Just read the op. It’s either an EXTINCTION LEVEL EVENT or it isn’t. 
---
i started reading the burning life and i read to page 171 of 331 a couple years ago. All i can remeber of the plot is a mission agent that decides to run away and take spa day and a random blood raider(?) civilian that wants to take revenge on a capsuler who blow up his space colony but until page 171 he is still trying to find out his name. 
---
I recommend leaving it untoched
---
No one is forcing you. 
---
If you log in regularly but never check your skill queue in six months then its on you
---
You forgot the almighty Flagship JF :)

Doesnt seem like they want to, you are reading the same thread as me right?

I always try 'admin // admin' first.
---
&gt; Do I have to relog all my accounts?
---
&gt; No!
---
&gt; When we update the Release branch of the launcher with the new code, we will migrate all accounts you have pinned over to the new launcher.
---
*suuuuuurrrrrreeeeee*
---
Their game balance is a war crime tbh
---
WRONG. SP is no longer gained from time. You can inject your way to as much SP as you want.
---
There's no reason it couldn't just accrue at the minimum rate for omega (ie. as if you trained a skill with no boosters, remapped away from the skill you're training and no implants). Trade off for not actually babysitting your queue.
---
It was one of a handful of books I stopped reading about 2/3rd of the way through. I normally perceivere and drive through books unless they are terrible. I came back about 4 years later and finished it, regretted every page. The other two books, especially the first one are very enjoyable.
---
The graphic depictions of dust bunny combat were great. Dust clones are terrifying monsters. 
---
Going alpha also resets your queue, so if you plex, you need to remember to hit go on all your queues when sub expires if you aren't doing it in advance.
---
tell me where you are ratting with it and i come and help you how to avoid sites
---
Problem with it as man6bhas pointed out was the lack of content behind being able to watch a ship from the balcony. 
---
Had there been casinos in station, exotic dancers in station, bars in station, or even a meeting room in station it might have gotten some more use. 
---
It was a feature they could have implemented way better than what they did. 
---
Also, the current upwell  stations could do with some more diverse interior.
---
Cute. Bringing your friends too, I suppose?

So, bring back POS sov.

Very sad, very true.
---
/r/ExcelPorn Oh yeaaaahhh... ;)
---
I've been getting reports of this happening more and more often, I wonder if something is broke.
---
And you'll find that these alliances rarely have members using rorquals.
---
Uh, sure they can. If you want to shoot mans, go shoot mans. If you want to suck crok, suck crok. Picking out a contrived, narrowly-defined example and calling it representative of all PVP is some disingenuous bullshit.
---
Yes you are right
---
The 7-minute invulnerability timer is one of the reasons I've quit playing. It's a waste of time trying to attack a rorqual unless you have a capital/supercapital force on standby which can fight the defenders' supercap fleet.
---
tfw you batphone and they don't give a fuck.
---
I can remember more instances when CCP tried to fix things and fucked it up than when players were responsible for getting changes put in that turned out to be bad. Nice try, but I'ma keep bitching about rorqs, caps, anoms, botting, citadels, and whatever the hell else I feel like until I'm not paying CCP to play the game anymore.
---
Go shoot invincible rorqual mans
---
fun
---
I know. But in that era you didn't have to be physically present in the systems you held. The majority was owned for the sake of moon mining.
---
So what if you mixed that in with the occupancy element? Structures determine if an alliance is eligible for a claim, but occupancy levels of whatever kind actually make the claim and determine how strong that claim is.
---
The result is that there is no official action required to claim a system. No more TCU shenanigans, no more hacking, no more infrastructure hubs (in their current form). All you have to do is drive out the old inhabitants and start living there yourself, and the system will automatically belong to you and grow in benefits if you fortify it well enough.
---
See, bitching is fine.. it gets the conversation started.
---
I have a problem when self-serving posts are made about how changes should be made to better suit their own agenda
---
I know it's difficult, but please try to fill in the gaps of an idea yourself instead of taking it as literal as you possibly can. Obviously there would be more to it than structure spamming.
---
What did I just say about a narrowly-defined example? Fucking idiot.
---
Don’t fly it until you can afford to lose it 
---
They just want to attack WC when the Chinese New Year is coming and everyone in WinterCo go back home and spend time with their family. 
---
\&gt;   it actually bugged me quite a lot 
---
Really? Missile disruption, ECM, smartbombs (and to a lesser extent, bombs, booshes, point defense systems, speed tanking, etc) aren't enough anti-missile mechanics to keep you from losing sleep at night? Defender launchers used to shoot down missiles, but it was a pretty crappy mechanic that got very little use.
---
Cost is only effective if things are dying often though. Things not dying often enough is one of the main problems right now.

there are lots of good videos on youtube

why is there a nomad in the nomad wtf

I live in Null with my planets all making protein (1 extractor with 8 heads, suppling 6 factories) and I make 6 bill a month with 5 characters and 6 planets each...  
---
That’s only 30 clicks a day!
---
Happy cake day !
---
Alright. I guess it seems hard to tell, to me, when someone is just venting or trying to get a constructive discussion going or pushing for changes for purely selfish reasons. Like... I want to see nerfs to supers and caps and nullsec krabbing and citadels even though I'm in a big nullsec bloc and I multibox krab to keep a bunch of capital and super alts subbed. Heh.
---
Planetary interaction
---
Absolutely. You can't get the advantage from your implants but at least you can the minimum rate. 
---
There was a glorious 2-week period between when jump-fatigue was first introduced and aegis sov was implemented. In those 2 weeks, many smaller entities were able to use caps to fight over territory without being constantly third-partied. I think that if we rolled back aegis sov but kept fatigue, it would be much better than what we have today.
---
Alternatively give us a hybrid of what we have today and either dominion or pos sov. Whoever owns the majority of moon structures owns the system (since we have to kill the fuckers anyways if we want to use the system) and provide the usage-based increase of anom spawn rates that we get with the current ADM system
---
Remove asset safety and make unfueled citadels killable in one siege to both encourage defenders to fight and reduce citadel spam.
---
Whatever else is done, remove the panic module from rorquals so they become killable again.
---
advice,  go on SISI.  learn to control fighters efficiently. before u go on live.
---
and never be closer than 100km from an enemy.   always be prealigned.  and if neut or ally comes into your site. warp.  awoxers are real
---
People always mock you for your hypochondria. are u mental sick？

Just ignore redalert, he has been copy pasting that message all over this thread without even reading what was being said. And yes, going alpha resets your queue and screws it up if you are not there that day to start them again.

bulgogi is shit compared to ssamkyupsal. give it a try!
---
It bugged me because it should be something that exists in-universe. Or atleast has to have been tried in universe. I'm not advocating for adding it to the gameplay.
---
Sounds about right, because people from space and 15000 years into the future are not plebs like us who discriminate on the basis of looks and color...
---
said no Amarrian ever.
---
You aren’t earning it though. You’re buying it for either ISK or real money. You *earn* SP through time, as indicated in the list of skills that has a timer on it.
---
It’s not the same as slaying monsters and earning xp per kill.
---
Warp to 100, land and activate your sensors.
---
Align to safe, always.
---
This order prevents you aligning but command not registering.
---
When neuts enter local, warp to safe (with tether) and then recall fighters. Dont wait for your fighters to return.
---
You will not tether until your fighters dock up, but you can dock if neuts comes on grid.
---
Good points mentioned. Regarding the abuse, I mentioned the limit in how many SPs can be accrued (for example 1M) so that could be a solution. Half rate or even base rate (aka without implants) could also be a good solution.
---
Yes, as I said it is something that doesn't happen every other week, but it's a quality of life change that would benefit most (we all got this happen to us, just like not updating our clone back in the days). And it's not like a new mechanic, as CCP already has the interface, the button and the code implemented.
---
When should we have jumped out? *After* the \~100 Ishtars landed on us at 0? Of course we jumped out when that showed up on dscan. Would have been downright idiotic not to.
---
It was your failing to not tackle something before your batphone showed up. You had plenty of people in system before they arrived.
---
Wat
---
was fun!
---
When cargo expanders on a dread aren't enough to fit your honour tank.
---
So tell me, what do you believe should be the minimum fleet composition and maximum time it should take to kill a Capital Industrial Mining Barge? Should a capital fleet NOT have time to arrive to save it? Should you be able to take one out with4-5 T3Cs? Five HACs? 
---
It's not like Rorquals don't die every single day. It's not like it is a big secrets how hard they are to kill. If you are trying to kill a Rorqual without a cap fleet ready, YOU are just doing it wrong. If it was easy, everyone would do it.
---
thats not an unfair criticism, i would say the expanse started a bit overly dramatic, but really settled into its element, you can also see this with S1 game of thrones, the acting started imo a little wobbly, but then they really settled into stride. i think s2 of SGU is better than S1 in terms of the over dramatics, and that if they had the 3rd season+ they would have had that chance too. 
---
Yeah there was a misplay on tackle. It happens. I kind of like thinking of CVA &amp; co cowering their keepstar watching our fleet blowing shit up though.
---
&gt; I'm not advocating for adding it to the gameplay.
---
&gt; It bugged me because it should be something that exists in-universe.
---
u wot
---
Because you mine more the the rest of the game combined and has the industry to go with it, instead of fighting for territory, you could just spam the fuck out of structures to capture sov, that would be my main concern. 
---
Remember when CCP *did* listen to its player to "fix" a waning ship class and game mechanics? I do:

Granted its during an era when CCP actually had a balance team. You provide a good enough proposal with information/details and an idea, and they'll run with it. Things that happened because of my/player ideas:  
---
* All battlecruisers got a range buff as a role bonus (25/25 split, instead of a 50% bonus to 1 range)
---
* Fleet hurricane got a tracking and damage bonus, making it a whole new ship instead of "just the old hurricane"
---
* Drone BC's got drone speed bonuses
---
* The DNI (eventually, after a 2nd iteration) can use a link now
---
People who use the ships or fight against them everyday have a good understanding of their mechanics and can still see what needs tweaking. 
---
Also, reddit is being used as a Forum, a forum used to discuss things game related. If you don't like it, then don't view forums or posts that touch on balancing. Its good to have discussion in the community (even if sometimes you get a ton of copy cat threads shortly after a highly upvoted "insert balance/bot/capitals/rorqual" post). CCP does listen and i know they're watching these threads on here and the forums, probably going through a lot of terrible ideas and some decent ideas to try to find a good middle ground.
---
Just because something exists in universe doesn't mean capsuleers get access to it. Or how many people are flying around in these fuckhuge empire super titan things? Or shooting with whatever CONCORD uses?

get a keybind that allows you to select next target, use "W" allot and set the defult orbit of the fighters to 7km, NEVER EVER EVER let your fighters stand still

Does "Makalu Cries" count, even if it is a response to salty ranting?
---
A rorqual right now has a massive amount of tank available to it - that places a minimum requirement of killing it. Too small a fleet of subcaps and the defenders will get there in time. 
---
If the attacker have a large force of subcaps then the defender will either know they are coming or at least be able to guarantee a fight.
---
If you drop a dreadbomb then by definition they are stuck for 5 minutes before they can extract.

Make damage caps log-scale to make it worth dropping multiple caps on a target. 
---
Whiner.
---
If you can do so, skip T1 indies as they're not worth the risk of hauling worthwhile contracts with their low tank. If you plan on doing lot's of freighter runs through the usual choke points then insure it to minimise the sting from an almost inevitable ganks. Don't afford to fly with collateral that you can't afford to lose! If you have the capital then you can make a lot of isk just doing high collat BPO runs in an interceptor.

This is awesome!

It’s not about being Abel to everything everywhere, it’s about being ABEL to kill anything at all under umbrellas.

yeah you love not actually playing the game, but watching netflix. fuck off. you're ruining mining for the rest of us.
---
Of course, I actually hesitated alot when putting numbers on it. 10 peeps in a perfected hunter group is not comparable with 10 peeps with thrashers...
---
And of course the caps themself are also another factor. I think a full efficiency trimmed ratting carrier should even die to a 5 man gang if they are optimised for cap hunting. 
---
I actually think, that might already work, if you got 2/3 leshaks and the carrier is not really on edge.
---
I think it counts
---
Which is why I suggested hull specific for this in the other reply 
---
eh, just saying its quite profitable in null or wh space to do PI.  you have 2 accounts doing PI with 6 chars total?  that earns what, 1b a month in highsec?  Just saying PI scaling in null along with SP extraction can easily fund omega for all accounts.
---
I cant tell you Anure's state of mind, but this definitely wasn't a flash form for them. It was their structure that was anchoring.

Never heard of it

I have one account with one character doing PI on six planets.

does he multibox like 4 accounts in these fights?

i think everyone did, snuff included.

Not like evictus will defend anyone 😂
---
Also if you’re warping to sites, align to them first, and scan them to see if other members in your corp are there already. You never want to step on someone’s toes who’s already doing a site and you steal some of their ticks because it takes forever to turn and go to a new site. 
---
Dirty spai! :)
---
To be fair tho, it was more accurate when I said it. For the most part it seems NC. were the ones blowing your shit up.
---
The amount of money CCP has neglected to make from EVE merchandise across the years should easily match what it sold itself for.
---
Marauders are in a good place for what they are - dedicated PVE machines. Good pilots can convert that into a PVP ability but that is not what the hull is for. Though i will say tge golem is stronger than the others. A small drone or slot buff could help the other 3 perform better as npc killers

Except in Genesis. We don't shoot freighters there. I promise.

Titans were never meant to be mass produced.

Ccps intentions doesn't always have a say in the matter

It's a weird feeling when I get back into a wormhole chain from high sec I finally feel safe.

Yeah they landed and some of the ships question were nuetral so murdered them before realizing they were friendly.

Thank you for actually giving a constructed opinion

1 set of paints isn’t enough. Try it and you’ll see. Regardless if you’re dumb enough to rely 100% of your titan fleet applying on 1 hyena then idk what to tell you lol. 
---
The best ship for gauling is a pod or a shuttle.
---
Hear me out. Look for frigs or dessies on the market. Find ones for sale cheap way out in the backwaters of highsec (cheaper than trade hub prices).
---
Fly there in a pod. Buy the ship and fly it to a hub to sell.
---
Ship builders build frigs by the 100s so sometimes they cant be bothered to haul them to market, instead selling them at a knock down price.
---
Another good but niche ship for hauling is the venture, its ore hold holds compressed ore too. Buy that cheap way out in the backwaters, stuff it in a venture and fly to a hub
---
'Granted its during an era when CCP actually had a balance team.'

Tbh, if this isn't the crux of the situation, I'm not sure what is. The major costs in any project is maintenence, chasing the shiny new thing is good and well but you have to keep the old girl running.

Ah.  I see where you said that now.

better of using an alt in a pod so it will also pre-spawn the haven. 
---
Tbh I'd be OK with all logi being removed.
---
What if I asset safety something from a non destroyed citadel?
---
Congrats?
---
well, nobody said that you should be able to alpha through caps with a cheap battlecruiser fleet.
---
Currently, a dead carrier (standard cap with insurance) only costs about the same as a standard T1 battleship (again with insurance), but the combat value/application than 5 T1 battleships. And T1 battleships always need much, much more expensive support ships, while caps are good as standalone ships.
---
Any game that has no balance issues, builds on the fact of diminishing returns, a battleship costs more than the double of a battlecruiser, while not having the double of BCs power. The same can be said about everything in the subcap range, as well as in the capital range.
---
However, if you go from a Battleship, the price is about 2-5 times (depending on the calculation and BS) of that of a battleship, while the dps is at least 3x (used antimatter rails) and the tanks is 15!!!! times higher. Of course, you can say the mobility of a carrier is less, but since most fights happen on one grid, that fact is disproven alot, as fighers are ALOT faster than T1 BS.
---
BTW, the whole discussion is not about PGLs dreadbomb. That one had mistakes, you guys were prepared with a very good super fleet etc. It's about Capitals VS SUBcapitals, capitals themself are more or less balanced. In caps you got the normal caps which are too cheap after insurance and the supers which are too tanky, but since both is "unbalanced" it's quite okey again.
---
Why do you think that only with fatigue and capital superiority we can allow smaller/subcap fleets to achieve wins against capital fleets?
---
Making overall dmg application on subcaps lower, wouldn't hurt the capital meta that hard, thanks to the signature radius and the speed tank that can be utilized. But currently, all caps can basically track any subcaps, which simply makes no sense.
---
"Marshal" jackets or the "Outlaw"?? 😮
---
A cyno is a Cynosural Field Generator I module. Click it while carrying 500 units of Liquid Ozone, and a system-wide warpable beacon appears by your ship and you are immobilized for 10 minutes. Jump-capable ships in other systems who are in fleet with you are able to see your beacon in their jump navigation menu. If they choose to jump to your cyno they will teleport to within 5km of your cyno's location.
---
By backwater what do you mean? I'm still relatively new to the game. And I haven't ventured much into lowsec yet
---
I would have one add on. The blops cyno disrupter shouldn't turn off the cyno. Only stop ships from being able to jump to it while active.
---
Witch means if it goes active but the Target can some how kill the blops his cyno goes active again (for the rest off it cycle) meaning you can't drop an inhibitor then cycle the blops cyno disrupter while it's anchoring, to fully and prevent reactivation off the cyno.
---
It forces the blops to stay on grid / you to bring more then one to cycle through, and gives the trader a chance to save him self.
---
Don't worry, it's every single alliance leadership trying to protect themselves since most of it is true about them allowing botters and helping them for income. 
---
A little bit of a follow up on one of the bots that left Sky's rmt botting farm from slyce renters. [He Ku](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74152679/), one of the hel bots who got dunked by BL and left slyce renters moved to Fraternity renters and died a couple more times. He was even awoxed by Fraternity but it seems he's still a part of their renters and now he's dying in tengus in lowsec. This is ironical since most of fraternity was funded via bots since 2016 when most of the little space they had back then in wicked creek area was pretty much bot haven. At the time I wasn't much active pvp wise since I was starting out my free to play journey and was more focused on making enough money to pay for my monthly sub. As for the few times I was around on comms at the time most people from the corp I was in were telling me to not go to their space, aggressively. 
---
Fucking poverty JF fit, too. :cripes:
---
No PJDE, no ORE expanders, no Shadow Serp istabs. This is an affront to every proper JF pilot in EVE. 
---
I guess all explorers run  same systems, so basically these people screw themselves up 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7mYoO2tUbE&amp;t
---
I made a video for that
---
So,to shoot caps use dreads, to shoot anything that isn't a cap use a carrier.
---
How about structures?
---
iT iS fUn BeCauS3 cCp iS cAl1Ed CcP lol xD 
---
Wont i just lose the fighters then if i warp without them?
---
That can is left there for gathering salt.
---
I have tried to join the test server but it never let me join. Also i was told that it doesnt update your info often, is tbat not true? 
---
Thanks for the video!
---
Seems like reddit has run out of stuff to reee about.
---
Ecm burst is best whore weapon!
---
Expensive capital ship? Dude it costs 1.8 - 3 bil for a fully fit rorqual. The leshaks we fly are about as expensive. 20-30minutes of bashing a rorqual - you clearly have never bashed a properly fit rorqual with 300 cap charges. Your ignorance on how difficult it actually is to kill a rorqual is shining at the moment. 
---
The industrial capital should not have a proper means to fight back and should not have a proper means to tank as long as it does. The other side should have to quickly respond. They should not be able to cyno in 1/2 fax and 1/2 supers and be safe. Or if they do - they should have to do more than simply warping a ceptor 200 above the rorqual to save it. 
---
Finally, judging from your reddit history and killboard you should actually go and do some pvp that requires more than listening to an FC and pressing F1. The way you have posted and the mindset you have about this game shows that you don't really understand a single mechanic you are talking about. You are simply parroting the discussions of a lot more knowledgable players. Go keep listening to the meta show. As an example, you joke about using T1 fit leshaks, whether using T1 Fit leshaks or T2 Fit leshaks - if you have 20 of them a triple cap booster injected rorqual can still tank you in perpetuity. You need 10+ leshaks, 2-3 bhaalgorns, and several logi to have a hope and a prayer of killing the rorqual. It will still take a LONG time due to the triple cap injection. Literally 20+ minutes to frag him even if we are using heat to push him through armor. When we finally do, he gets to panic and we start over again. 
---
Always travel by gate . Never use cynos .
---
Carriers are specialized in long-range attacks against subcapital ships. They use Fighters (an advanced sort of drone) that can travel thousands of km and deal up to ~2,000 DPS sustained.  
---
Dreads are specialized in short-range (~50km) attacks against capital ships. They use capital sized turrets that don't apply well to subcaps and do up to ~30,000 DPS sustained. A group of dreadnoughts (a "dreadbomb") can quickly kill even the tankiest supercapital ship.
---
This greatly upsets the server.
---
An XL refinery was never mentioned. Where are you hearing this from?
---
Eve has trade hubs, areas that are well connected where people have decided to sell stuff. Backwaters in this context are areas of highsec that are far from these hubs.
---
Many miners prefer that sort of space because there are fewer pirates and less compertition. 
---
The downside is hauling their goods to market is hard. Instead they sell thier goods at a lower price than normal hub rates. Meaning that people dedicated to hauling can buy thier goods at the lower price and haul them to a a hub where the price is higher
---
Ok so couple of things. Let’s break it down really quick:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/66241631/
---
This is the fit from the video. These are boosting battleships, no prop, very low moving transversal.  And also almost no tank. If you catch them right after a boosh, they’re dead. 
---
If you’re in this very niche case then sure you’ll apply fine. But even so, look at the KM, the citadel too was painting. I honestly don’t know the effectiveness of a painting citadel, but it’s probably not insignificant. Any normal battleship with a prop mod would have tanked your dreads through logi and sit tank. One hyena isn’t fine in any other case.
---
It's real simple these days, select sisi in the top left corner of the launcher.
---
As soon as you are logged in join the "Singularity" chat channel, it has all the rules and infos that you'll need.
---
I do appreciate the video though, was a fun watch regardless.
---
Thank God, somebody has to because I absolutely refuse but my corp is building a keepstar and we need the PI market to crash. Hurry OP you're our only hope /s
---
If you're getting handshake errors, the server is probably not down - keep trying for a couple minutes and it'll probably let you in
---
 Tenerefis  is mentioned 5 times in the agreement, 2 of them is saying Frat will self-destruct or transfer all structure in Tenerefis. 3 of them is stating no Frat member are allowed to fuck with the transition during the transition period.
---
Tenerefis sov are indeed NOT covered by the NIP, 
---
but the tenerefis sov are taken over by XIX
---
&gt; \-This NIP does not extend to XiX, but any attacks upon XiX will be viewed as attacks on Legacy for the moment and will be responded to in kind up to and including cessation of this deal. 
---
\^ and following by this, which is pretty much says XIX are not bounded by the NIP (as XIX alone still allowed to hit frat sov for example) but any aggression on XIX sov structure will be retaliate by Legacy .  
---
tldr.  
---
Tenerefis sov not protected by the NIP but by being  XIX sov which is protected under the NIP
---
Its a module "Cynosural field generator", when you hit it, your ship is unable to move for 10 minutes and any capital ship in your fleet can use their jump drive to teleport to your ship.
---
No, fighters are "smart", they'll warp to you. In a pinch you can also abandon your fighters to get the tether.
---
The citadel was painting for the second part cos they got pinned down by nulified t3s in range of  it. Citadel tp range is 170 and it didnt boost their sig much @ that range. We had 1 hyena for each grp of dreads and we didnt wait for them to jump cos they were jumping constanly cos uf. Its booshing doctrine they dont have a prop mod they are aligned all the time boosh or no boosh.  If they are in range they are fucked. Ofc u dont bring only 1 hyena but Al im saying its not science fiction to get enough tps on them. 
---
Also Q moving fighters.
---
If you want money for shooting structures, go shoot engineering complexes. It didn't drop, but a ragnarok was among the loot possible for [this loss, for example.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74634525/) This is on TQ today and works in k-space. Works on reactor-fit refineries too.
---
I've been thinking about getting it, but idk it just doesn't quite look like it'd be as fun as Eve's PI system. There's some weird charm about it in EvE, maybe more because I'm producing the robotics and guidance systems so I can turn them into T2 drones 
---
Ok thanks i was worried i would just lose them like normal drones 
---
No, they will warp to you after you land.  Make sure you wait until you come out of warp completely.  Once you land hit recall and they will come to you. 
---
Do this between sites as well to get better ticks.  Warp to the next site, once you land hit recall fighters.  This is the best way to get the dank ticks you're looking for. 
---
&gt;- When the siege module is on, give the ship its own cynosural inhibitor with a 200k range, same as the Mobile Cynosural Inhibitor you can deploy. (fuck you capital droppers) (shouldn't cancel covops cynos though)
---
Ok, what stops them from just cynoing in anywhere else in system, then warping to you?
---
Go on sisi first.
---
do things, practice cynos.

You haven't contradicted what I've said. Are you dense? u/philly552 said "east tenerifis" nowhere in that pathetic excuse for an agreement does that term exist.
---
Killing structures is quiet profitable , especially rigged athanors and raits, when fitted the drop 200m+ salvage of 100-200m
---
u/basilvilpine I only bolded the part relevant to the discussion. the "for the moment" bullshit was something, presumably, thinning allowed in there which in effect has made this a totally one sided agreement
---
aka outplayed.
---
NeRf cApiTaLs, capital umbrella, I cannot kill rorquals with my wh 5 man gang blah blah blah
---
I think we are having two different arguments. What I’m saying is any battleship with a prop mod and legitimate tank will tank these kind of dreads. 
---
With a prop mod: they sig tank you
---
With a legitimate tank: reps land before you blap
---
Yes, you are right though that. With no tank and no prop then I’m sure 1 or no paint is fine to hit them/ kill them.
---
I think it was mentioned in the refinery introduction videos. I remember CCP speaking about a XL refinery which will bring us even close to the 100% refine yeld. I even remember ed the name Kivestin. But my memories about it are pretty vague and searching for info about it i find nothing. So i asked for help here.
---
I agree, this is a significant kill mail. But could you imagine if 20% of the Ragnarok's value also got split between the pilots. In a 100 bill isk kill mail - the pilots got 2 bill of the value dropped (its all dependent on the loot fairy). Where the asset safety interaction above is more consistently paid out. 
---
The kill mail is significant, but I'd rather have ISK in my pocket (personally). 
---
K space is more risk, more reward. 
---
And this is a counter to hull specific. A gate flash, followed by immediately showing, would tip off to what just came in, even before they decloak.
---
May want to buy a dictionary.
---
Hi mr top pee (hidden) ya dont have an r/ before your name here. Are ya kinda admin?
---
Good since my retarded sperm made you.
---
:D
---
So the further away from say jita you are the lower the price per say?
---
The salt from people making posts like this is worth it, tbh.
---
Wasn't progod on the CSM for that, too?
---
Thanks I'll check it out
---
Fight me in the wildy irlonline
---
It depends tbh. In friendly space i'll always clear out sites or simply not open them up if i don't like the loot in the cans. 
---
But in hostile space you can screw right off i'm not risking my skin to clean up a site.
---
&gt;Well, Winter Co just made a critical mistake, so we're going to go turn that mistake into an extinction-level event.
---
you didn't get much out of primary school either, apparently
---
lol, that's why we take no risks when it comes to incursion rats, here's the fleet for the final site in that 3h 45M incursion we had a while back: [https://i.imgur.com/4SuTLQ1.png](https://i.imgur.com/4SuTLQ1.png) 
---
It won't work if your character was created since the last mirror. Are you an injected wallet warrior?
---
so following that logic - if more are being built then they will be more expensive. yet, look at your screenshot.
---
They might phase out citadels and aegis sov at some point, the same as they did with POS, Outposts and dominion. 
---
*If* EvE survives this long, of course.
---
I'll have what he's having 
---
You should pvp. This game is a pvp game.
---
^ THIS.  Highly recommend you do not fly any cap on Tranq first.  Always test things out on the test server first.  Controlling fighters isn't hard, but is more nuanced than you might think.  And mistakes can add up to a lot of ISK quickly.
---
Why exactly those need shitheads? Grath doesn't even play anymore, tikktokk is not able to do anything without having at least 5 people helping him
---
There one thing I thinks missing from ms amons is a capital escalation. Something that can threaten the carriers and supers running them. 
---
Capital ship spawns are a threat to only sub caps (or carrier's if it's a titan spawn) 
---
There really should be a response to a cap / super cap attacking an anom
---
Also prevents exploits to quickly shut down your own cyno with an alt. Giving that blops a scram time of 10min hurts the attackers more than defenders/exploiters. 
---
Then its paid the same way it is now. 
---
I always liked going on a fresh site to get time to set up and make sure everything is good to go before ships start spawning. I know people min/max for ticks, but that’s just me. 
---
Paid the same way it is now 
---
I'd recommend this also.  Do not recommend aligning your carrier to the next site until the final wave.  Always stay aligned to a safe or a corp/alliance station otherwise. 
---
Grath plays every day, so does Tikk. They also consistently fly marauders for PvP on the regular and are probably more qualified to talk about balance issues than the armchair "what-if" guys.
---
Self destruct. Extract carrier skills. Go to low sec. Be a man 
---
Since we are back that far to the same line of discussion, let me throw the old "planet occupancy" instead of moons back in.
---
Who holds the majority of planets owns the system. Have something like the mechanic that limits refineries to one active miner per moon to claim the planet position with your Astra/Fort/Keep.
---
Yeah the distrupter scram / cycle time should be some what short
---
No wormhole group worth a shit does that . 
---
10-20s imo. Make it long enough Intel can save your blops, but short enough you cant just watch local for a spike. To be fair the fleet will star burst and the blops will jump out so them getting off grid is "super easy" so there should be some risk built into the module. Imo
---
Or maybe we're still meeting about the Meteor War?
---
In any event. You're trying way too hard.
---
You don't have to align first to scan a site though...
---
Low sec FW player here, i lose like 3-5 ships a day and i like to fly pirate faction frigs and stuff. I had to laugh at 5 ships a year. Id be fucking ecstatic to lose 5 ships a year. Hell if i can undock the same ship more than 5 times, I'm thrilled
---
Well, the behavior of the typical highsec miner. He mines in what he hopes to be absolute safety. He very slowly gains ISK. He saves up the ISK and, at some point, buys a larger mining ship and some mining upgrades. He then continues to pile up ISK very slowly. He does nothing else. The ISK is never used for anything. Essentially, the highsec miner is a willing slave to his own monotonous impulses. Unless the ore becomes completely worthless he will never stop.
---
Mods are retarded title aint shit its accurate
---
Align, set range on your Dscan, and narrow your window to about 30 degrees to see if a friendly or can/MTU is there shows you if someone is already doing the site. You want to align so if it’s free you can just warp instead of wasting time. 
---
Once again, I would buy these in a heartbeat. 
---
I create 24 wetware per day from raw gathered resources. I can duplicate that easily on every two characters. It is 6 planet to planet transfers and one pick up a day. Hard to maintain day in and day out across 9 of my characters.  But two characters can make close to 1,85 bil before fuel costs so with that extra character you should have no issue. 
---
P.s. I would love to pay for planet to planet services. 
---
T3C might be a happy medium here, as (including SP loss) it's a pretty heavy lossmail but it's still fast-warping and can take a covert cyno. Maybe make it require the support subsystem or something which makes it not useful for mainline DPS.
---
Yeah and then its all messy and I spend the next few hours making it more efficient and smaller. 
---
IMAGINE BEING ACCEPTED BY A NULLSEC CORP AND THEN BEING SUCH A COMPLETE PIECE OF SHIT THAT YOU PUBLISH WAR INTEL ON REDDIT JUST FOR FREE INTERNET POINTS
---
Good idea, though I do hate the idea of damage caps. There should be an advantage to having more than less.
---
Call down dude. It’s a game. 
---
Joecuster for CSM
---
rude
---
On occasion, I find wormholes that just haven't been visited in a few days and there are 14+ hackable sites waiting. By the time I get done clearing the board of all of them, two or three more will spawn in the same system which gives just that many more chances at finding the cans with top tier loot. My biggest honey hole had me dragging 600M out of a single system.
---
Salt ain't worth that much on the market.
---
no mad pls
---
Back in 2010 or 2011, the Initiative actually got pretty famous for using smart bomb battleship comps (called Firewalls) to great effect against Stainwagon, who used to spam Drake blobs at people.
---
How can we be sure that carriers one shotting everything is an issue though, you don't have a degree in carriernomics, now to back to dodging ecm ceptors in your entosis ships.
---
In larger fights the game sometimes shits the bed trying to render. For larger fights if you want to minimize crashing do the following:
---
- close local chat
---
- remove brackets (ask someone in your alliance how)
---
- set graphics settings to optimize on performance (I’ve found leaving effects on is fine, but it might not be for everyone)
---
- turn off sound 
---
This should allow you to ‘enjoy’ large scale fights from a gameplay standpoint. 
---
If you have a monster of a computer and want to take beautiful screenshots, turn off the entire overview and zoom in on ships exploding/ shooting. Leave graphics to high and survive the pola rvortex from your now heated house. think it’s like ctrl+f11 or something like that. 
---
You got to fly smart. Engage what you think you can take. When deployed near horde I had an ancil rep Tristan. And would undock and warp in an alt in a cheap throw away navitas as remote rep. I usually went after pirate frigates. People are confident taking on a t1 frigate and usually don't try to kite very hard and make mistakes where I catch them. 
---
 Sounds good

Also means them Loki covert Ops battle fleets have a big tanky blops flagship to pin there prey down while the work. / Keep it alive

---
Imagine rage typing on a reddit thread. Lol.
---
well its a little more complicated than that there's a few reason you may choose to shoot subs with dreads. Dreads have a special kind of gun that is good VS subs. Unlike carriers, dreads cant get remote repaired, but they have powerful local repairs. And you can't defang a dread (but you can outrange it.) So in smaller numbers they can be better but not always
---
dreads are great on POSes, they aren't super good vs citadels because of dmg caps. 
---
Medium and large structures are killed by fleets of subcaps. Keepstars are killed by fleets of Titans at range. This is because of damage caps, and because structure anti-cap weapons are devastatingly effective.
---
Also, have a look at encounter surveillance systems, these are bought from npcs in their respective empires. Taking the minmatar ones and selling at jita you could perhaps double your isk!
---

Not only that, disrupting reds getting money and resources.

Balancing by isk is pointless in this day and age when everyone's multiboxing multiple rorqs or dreads in C5/6 space for income. You earn much more than you lose.

Bad bot.

&gt; From approximately 05:00 UTC this morning, the Activity Tracker suffered connectivity issues that prevented data from the achievements of pilots from being uploaded and displayed.
---
&gt; This connectivity trouble lasted for approximately 12 hours, during which activity by pilots across the cluster was recorded, but not displayed as part of their achievement metrics in the Activity Tracker.
---
&gt; We would like to reassure all pilots that this data was recorded correctly and all actions are present and accounted for.
---
&gt; The development team are currently looking to replay this 12 hours of data, which will add the missing metrics to the activity trackers of all pilots once this process has been completed.

[here is a google drive link to download it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kFUPHi5i66J2yUZAdsGrtjOvctdfayVc/view?usp=sharing) It is an excel file with scroll buttons and what-not. Calculation cells have orange text, cells you input values into are filled in orange. This sheet is full of bugs too, if anything ends up calculating a negative value, the whole supply-chain related to that will throw out incorrect values. The values for a planet's production are taken as a 24-hour average cycle output, and they're input just above the line coming out of the resource, you'll have to check the box for which resource the planet is producing. The "Auxiliary" factories (ones outside the dotted black box) have check boxes to turn them on and off in the simulation. The "Ignore incoming resources" tic makes it so the sheet only bases it's predictions based on the stored resources.

If you end up trying to use this for producing anything differently, you'll have to dig through most of the equations to correct issues

That meme is so old i doubt the person you directed it at even remembers where its from. And if there were no dps cap on structures and the RF timers were only 1-2days and TZ tanking them wasn't an option then maybe having 5000 structures spammed in every system wouldn't be so bad..... nah it still sounds like a fucking terrible idea. lets not do that.
---
thanks CCP for fixing the important stuff
---
Stop your fucking autistic reeeing 
---
Capsulers likes to be jerks, they ruin your game twice, first for letting scan you down an empty site, two because a clean site will spawn a new site elsewhere
---
Why not instead of making a brand new module (which will never happen cuz "CCP" &amp; "Effort"), make the onlining of cyno inhibitor 2 staged, 
---
1st stage (anchoring) or w/e, functions as normal cynoinhib, after this 1 min no more cynos can go up within x range.
---
2nd stage (onlining) 1 minute (so 2 minutes total) cuts all cynos active within x range.
---
Boom problem solved, except I also agree it needs more tank :)
---
It wasn't our structure but yea it wasn't a flash form 
---
like 8 but yea
---
Yeah, that makes it look more like Fozzie sov and jump fatigue. Then the moon changes. Only then does the Rorq train to Titansville come into play. 
---
You're fucking stupid.  I don't even need to prove how stupid you are because your posting puts a big neon sign over your retard shaped head that says "hey look ma I'm a god damned idiot".
---
Surely you have director level spies in every alliance 😀 
---
Damn. F.
---
Why would they intervene? The amount of people buying plex hasn’t gone down with isk. Nor will it go down with people buying plex for irl money. It’s a win win for them. Besides making enough money for plex isn’t that hard with pve if you go into null sec
---
&gt; Marauders are in a good place for what they are - dedicated PVE machines.
---
Lol, more dumb posts.
---
Nope, why?          
---
Just throw in 2-3 rorqual alts and pay 3 bil for a "plex". 
---
I'm hoping for a MCT sale soon, because SP farms are becoming ISK negative (on their own, you can still profit by using the chars for industry and the like)
---
&gt; Marauders were never meant to be pvp ships
---
Their first iteration no, then they changed the way they worked (when they added bastion) making your post god damn retarded. 
---
Its like if you people dont use and fly the ship and haven't tracked the changes or developer statements about the ship over the years why do you even post shit like this thats so easily proven to be entirely fabricated in your own head.
---
I guess.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=3685&amp;b=8462580&amp;e=90&amp;t=ee

Paxom you're literally the turbo aids rotting providence from the inside out. I always see you in local chat but never in space u fuckin pansy 
---
Are test server characters still copies of your live characters or can you test out different character setups?  For example I can't fly caps on Tranq, but would love to try on Sisi just for fun.
---
The cyno jammer thing is never going to  happen and it wont matter anyway.  Either me or a corp member usually carries an inhib around, I promise you that people are smart enough to work around you being in the field of one.
---
Slot layouts could use some love but honestly, they work fine as is (other than the zero application having turd of a Paladin).  People need to just stop expecting to be able to sit stock still and brawl, you're one of the most mobile ships at the game, able to jump 100km every 54 seconds (bastion is only 60 seconds) and you should be using that to avoid getting bogged down.
---
Screaming fuck the world and riding bastion green like a viking literally isn't going to work, because capitals can just warp around like everything else, so unless the jammer was system wide (lol) its not going to make fuck all difference
---
The EVE: Source book has a comprehensive chapter on them - if you're into EVE enough to like its lore, Source is a really essential and super worthwhile book to pick up.
---
How will it become less useful? It is always worth 30 game days. No matter the price. If the supply exceeds the demand the price will go down. 
---
I was in one before and it really removed a lot of my ability to do what i wanted in EvE. sure i was able to mine all the rare ore to my heart's content, but it also meant that i had to always be watching local, when something came up I *had* to do what they wanted, etc... 
---
Mostly it's that moving into null seems like too much of a hassle. I'd love to do it on like a trial-basis, and i have a lot of different skill sets trained to a decent level (Shield repair, EWAR jamming, can fly stealth bombers, etc...)
---
I don't think you understand how this works. People buy plex with ISK when the price is low. And they buy plex with cash when the price is high. In neither situation does CCP lose because no matter what every time you use plex to sub your account they get an extra $5US over a normal sub.
---
There it is!
---
Dread  (if thats what it is) kinda reminded me of [this](https://www.halopedia.org/Mantle%27s_Approach)
---
I certainly remember people asking / pleading with CCP to revisit it and fix simple things.
---
I then distinctly remember CCP not revisiting it for what 1-2 years.
---
IMO i think a lot of people use to farm the game to get the 1 plex/500nuplex so they dont need to use IRL to play the game. 
---
I see.  
---
How's the new old chat server update going?
---
That’s cool for them. But you can’t cater to them. If the only way you can play the game is to use in game money and can no longer do that it seems like a personal problem. 
---
every 500 plex they farm to buy has to be bought with irl by someone
---
I'm going to die in 6 months from the blood aids your cancerous post has given to my retinas 
---
There are corps (especially in nullsec) that will provide you with a safe environment in which to learn about the various mechanics and lifestyles with their help, regardless of your experience or skill level. 
---
Join a community, and start playing to see if you like it. If you start alone, you will get bored and quit. 
---
I use to be able to have more account subbed becuase of this. Just by PvE now i cant. I know its seems like a problem for somepeople, but less acounts subbed it not bad for CCP?
---
What's your isk/h like // ships used // setup ? Genuinely curious if high sec moon mining is worth it
---
Like I said before dude. If less people buy plex at the high price they will go down again and people will begin to buy them again more. It’s his demand and supply works. 
---
SO in a way the current price means people stop buy plex becuase they are less common?
---
Go to any chat and type in '/copyskills'. This will update your character to a very recent version of their TQ doppleganger. As for items, there are tons of stations on SiSi where any item, including ships, can be purchased from NPCs for 100 ISK. This includes PLEX, but excludes injectors, supers and AT ships. My advice is to type in '/moveme' into a chat box, then select "FD-MLJ" or another nullsec system - most should have a seeded market. You will get teleported to the system immediately and for no cost. 
---
CCP releasing a patch a month, let alone a balance patch, is so improbable its impossible
---
Dont need to get mad, am just traying to understand. 
---
https://evemarket.brianum.de/ is nice and simple. 
---
If plex prices go up people are more likely to buy plex from CCP because they can get more ISK for it.  Every plex was paid for with real money.  CCP doesnt care what happens from there.  The high plex prices likely means less has been bought (with real money) recently makung a supply shortage.  When the supply goes down CCP wants the price to jump in order to incentivize buying more plex from CCP.
---
I doubt anyone is going to disagree that we need more balance passes more often
---
(or even just a finish to a balance pass - I'm looking at you tiericide)
---
it used to be people would buy more irl money plex since they can sell them for more and curb plex inflation 
---
They aren't playing for free.  Every plex was bought with real money by someone.  The only difference between paying a sub fee and using plex is who paid for it.  Also plex costs more than a regular sub fee so CCP prefers plex sales.
---
Would you stop crying already?
---
I’m far from mad bud. I’m just failing to understand your point of view. Look at it from ccps view. If plex prices go up there’s more incentive for players to buy it and sell. If there are less people buying plex for subs they will either quit, wait for plex to go down, or they will pay irl money to sub. 
---
Ok thanks for you explanation, 
---
Good Fight Snuff.
---
I saw snuff for a reason.
---
&gt; They accounted for over 50% of the attacking force. Snuff + Sanctuary of Shadows (SOS) was 57 of the 102 attacking forces
---
&gt; 24 of the 44 Dreads were Snuff/SOS
---
Now, we should have won this. We had Outnumbered the attacking force. We had 50% more people in the fight then they did.
---
How did we lose?
---
1. Snuff found a pattern. They saw that our Drops are mostly Rev's, they adapted and fit their lows properly. So the already super tanky Revs they had, had extraordinarily high resists to EM/THERM.
---
2. Init made poor choices. They brought Ruptures to a fight we knew would have a lot of carriers. They also Primaried FAX while 40+ Dreads were still on field. It was a semi close Dread Brawl, 44 to 36. The gap is obviously much large when 10 of your dreads are shooting FAX instead of enemy Dreads. Lesson Learned?
---
3. The idea of Nightmares was hamstrung by the amount of carriers on field. 47 Carriers made short work of Nightmares. Another lesson hopefully learned.
---
All in all, great fight Snuff, NSH and Friends learned a lot from this fight, and we too, shall adapt. Looking forward to some more fun fights in the future
---
He means that with no damage he gets no compensation.  The proposed system is based solely on damage output in order to get in on the loot.
---
&gt;It is reaching the point where is not worth it to invest time on PVE for to pay for game time.
---
people have been saying this since plex was introduced. nobody cares if you're crap at making isk, or too poor irl to pay cash for your sub.
---
plex is still cheap dude - one account can easily produce enough income completely passively to plex an account each month.
---
it's less than 17 plex per day. even at 4m per plex, that's less than 70m isk. that's a trivially small amount of isk.
---
&gt;Is that healty for the game?
---
yes, higher plex prices make it harder for RMTers to make irl money - which will drive them to other games to exploit.
---
&gt;Will ccp intervine before it reach 2b?
---
no, ccp don't give a fuck about the price of plex. the only thing they care about is the rate of change in plex prices - and the rate of change isn't even remotely fast, the rate of price change is pretty glacial.
---
&gt;If it do reach 2b its this good for CCP?
---
absolutely, see above about RMTers
---
Any estimate on how many players realized it was broken?
---
It doesn't exist on Google.  If You search kivestan eve online and require kivestan you get 0 results.
---
Nah, just remove asset safety from null sec, bullshit concept
---
Does Anure still belong to Punkos?
---
gf wally
---
your posting has finally killed me 
---
Oh heavens no! Not the activity tracker!?
---
Who cares? It's called escalation.
---
There's no such thing as a "Good fight".
---
Imagine in WW2 if Bismarck was like "Oh you're ruining a good fight go away" when Rodney, KGV and cruisers was in pursuit followed by Ark Royal.
---
If you get dropped and die it's your own problem.
---
Yes, its a flaw - could be worked around if the corp 'asset safety tax' was properly managed by directors. In general - the groups I've flown in - logi was almost always SRP'd or handed out. SO that some incentive to fly logi. 
---
I can't find a way around the logi not showing up on the killmail though and as a result not getting paid out - can you??
---
Never felt more useless as a logi, just endless shit being volleyed off the grid, people actually getting hyped when something lived. Will be back next week :)
---
Blame ccp why not just distribute the loot evenly into all cans rather than having 1-2 empty or with junk. 
---
I’ll take “I have no clue how basic economics works for $200 Alex”
---
Sad you cant forward your shitty temper towards not being a piece of shit
---
I think a better idea is to inject starship citizen with more cash... 2050 it will be ready.
---
the price is rising because it is getting easier to make isk 
---
Right. Lol
---
I'd be okay with this idea too. Would have the same result. More incentive to kill the citadels 
---
I just joined again. Found my old Corp HiFi was dead. Most everyone I know was in a starter Corp. It was really sad to see. ++ I was in a noob ship because I started as an alpha . Not sure what happened to my pilgrim ( cyno alt) . 
---
Nice focus
---
Still spaceships. Still blow up dudes and build stuff to blow up other dudes. Read over the patch notes and come play!
---
How so?
---
It shrinks to provide room to grow.
---
ratting is op, carriers are getting cheaper each day, people can inject carrier alts
---
Eve became a mining online simulator to the point CCP started to put this in the commercials around internet 
---
Thanks a lot man
---
Most of the negative reviews are for people who were never cut out for the game. EVE isn’t a feel-good MMO that so many people crave. As far as if it’s worth jumping back in? Play as an alpha for free and decide yourself.
---
Indeed, GFs to SNUFF, TNT, and INIT.
---
well CCP added some new pixels, changed a few other pixels and going to be removing some pixels.
---
im sure someone here will give you all the details you are looking for, but my advice is just play the game. play as an alpha, its free. you can see for yourself what is new, and decide for yourself what YOU think is good and bad
---
lol I used to run pve in a golem and would smartbomb my own torps, you have to time the cycles. 
---
No, that’s Rahne. 
---
Neither of you are in my mute list. I only mute insults and ad hominem.
---
This is the better version of that dread
---
https://i.imgur.com/nUQ3H9c.jpg
---
Yeah, I know it's ancient history at this point. I don't think we can do away with damage caps because then we'd have people running around and killing them without time for the defenders to form a fleet. I think we can remove damage caps from unpowered structures though. 
---
does it get a bonus to armor hardeners? 
---
Hence log scaling rather than flat caps. 
---
Nobody has ever used capitals before!
---
do u kiss ur sister with that mouth
---
No only yours.
---
i bet
---
Did you like playing FarmVille on Facebook.. if so Eve online is the game for you.
---
I had no idea it was broken and then all of a sudden I got like 20 achievement popups all at once. Reminded my to turn those notifications off.
---
CCP releases a statement about the activity tracker breaking for 12 hours, took them weeks to release a statement on warps not showing lmao 
---
i wonder if anyone in your former corp is thinking "well, maybe we shouldn't have kicked this guy for putting e-war on a selfdestructing rorqual who's getting shot by 100 bombers". 
---
Holy shit I had no idea 100 people could blob ratting and mining ships that are alone to the tune of isk damage ! Very epic thank you epic gamer lords ! 😎
---
Too bad Zarvox is a small baller now lmaO!! Epic blobs bOYES
---
Not necessarily true. Think economics. If the DEMAND is lower than in Jita, then the price will be lower. For moving ore profitably you have to find a place where ore is made by the bucketload and people are not using it for industry. 
---
My suggestion for making big money hauling is joining a nullsec Corp and importing stuff from highsec into their stations. It’s an important job, and sometimes you even get to set the prices when selling in their systems, because you’ll have a hold on the market. This is also more technical and will expose you to more mechanics of the game besides just gating through high sec. 
---
ty i will get it 
---
Didnt know they had a f2p version now. Guess ill have to download it now 
---
No. The game has lost its way. What made eve great no longer exists.
---
Sometimes. If someone has mining/production set up farther away, they can make a profit buy selling it for cheaper than it is in the trade hubs.  They just don't want to be bothered to haul it, so they sell it for cheap
---
Uninstall, you do not belong here
---
LOL sorry that was me who called your Loki primary after the Domain fleet started pulling off. I think my comment was "this fucking Goon shield fleet is still here, let's shoot something nice... Loki is primary."
---
I've been saying spool up since the fatigue changes long ago, it's the simplest and most eloquent fix to many of the problems attached to what is basically risk free teleportation. Front loading the time  by even just a bit would solve so much. Thank you for including this in your post.
---
Really? Most negative reviews I see are from eve veterans. I guess you're right. Eve isn't the Sam mmo it orginally was.  It's soft and easy now. No risk. 
---
On point with scouting and tackling, thanks for the nice catches! :D
---
I laughed too hard at this lol
---
3/10 bait
---
I bet they literally don’t give a shit rofl
---
You’ll see no complaints about this from me. I wholeheartedly agree. 
---
wait, people actually use it?
---
you're a fucking loser, lmao
---
lmao code
---
oh, another "code. is bad" post?
---
I’m not understanding, I think what you’re saying is there should be mining citadels you can warp around system that have 3 Rf timers and 3 dds, but also 30 min invulnerability that triples their dps? Also can mine a whole moon in 5 mins
---
poggers!
---
It's CODE. Nobody likes them because they aren't even honest about  their fucking code. Even if you bought a mining permit from them they would still gank you.
---
nice you can hear me dying while I was logged off at the beginning 
---
at least CCP gave me back my ship :D 
---
I mean code has been around for ages but this is why I live null no rules only people in local are friendlies or potential hostiles no in between really. tho get yourself down to null and join a Corp not all force PvP but no matter where you are PvP wil be there code is evidence of that.
---
There a Corp in GW called The dolphins great guys only care about indie and don't do much pvp take a look into them.
---
Commits suicide. /ingame
---
This is the stupidest thing CCP could have done with their resources.
---
I had fun watching that. I will definitely be joining next Saturday's fleet please keep doing these!
---
Yes, CODE. are spineless tools but they are a carebear part of the EVE experience.  Same as PIRAT.  Neither leaves highsec.  Frustrating when they get you.  Hope you added them as a bad/terrible contact.
---
&gt;go back home and spend time with their family.
---
Eve players? 
---
That looks awesome. Wish they redesigned the machariel a bit, it looks like a giant sex toy.
---
M8 they are trolls. Ignore them. Learn to use dscan to avoid getting ganked. 
---
Agreed.  Much quicker to work for an hour and convert that into ISK.  Fly around, blow stuff up.  Get blown up.  If there is only an hour or two here or there, don't waste it trying to make ISK that you don't have time to use...
---
Hello Kitty Online is thataway -&gt;
---
Then the only ship you should use to haul through low/null should be a Sunesis. You can fit it to align in under two seconds while still having nearly 1500m3 (with only t1 rigs), so as long as you bounce off celestials to dodge smart bombs. Just ask someone in your alliance if the other side of a gate is clear before jumping so you don’t land in a bubble 
---
&gt;Same as PIRAT.
---
To be fair PIRAT is just the "Elite PvP" wing of the bot alliance KWG. 
---
Yeah but they damaged some property and hurt one bystander one time so we should just let a literal nazi movement grow and take power under our noses.
---
b-but the bike locks!!
---
Don't you think that ship immobilized for 5min and without panic would be too easy to kill?
---
I'd guess isk per hour is about 50-60 million an hour. Use Orca pilot with Mining Foreman link 2 + 3 toons in procurers (to avoid ganks) with mining crystals and each have 5% mining yield implants. Fairly passive income I only really need to click on stuff every 8 minutes or so. Watch TV or do some stuff around the apartment. 
---
Oh. So *two-thirds* of /r/eve.
---
tl;dr
---
some dude got suicide ganked, his tears are delicious.
---
Caught a [Fraternity Nyx](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74961003/) in a bubble 30m later as well.  
---
Best advice I can give you is:
---
Find a active corp that can help you.
---
Move to a different home system where they are not.
---
D-Scan like a mofo.
---
Try a different aspect of the game that they avoid.
---
I feel your pain bro, I have been there as well. If you are willing to branch out, try and find a group that have a hiddenish Indy operation with a doorway. Good luck to you! :)
---
It's just a function of more people trying to buy their sub with in game currency than people buying PLEX with IRL money. In the end, it's pointless to rat for your monthly sub unless you have a job that pays under $10 an hour. In that case a little over an hour of work equals a month worth of game time. Also there is zero risk involved in that case. In game, however, you could lose your rorqual mining drones, your carrier, or the other ships you are using to make ISK. Granted, if you are in a certain corp that titan drops small roaming gangs it is far less likely, but it still happens. 
---
I would argue that this makes the game a lot less fun (I know very few people who actually enjoy farming on this game.) Granted when I was in residency and drowning in debt from medical school I fell into the trap of trying to play for free. I found myself spending almost all of my time on the game was spent farming to try and PLEX for the month. Just budget like $40-$50 a month towards the game (buy PLEX in bulk during sales) and go out one time less per month. The money you would've spent equals out and you'll find yourself having a lot more fun on the game.
---
You have to be really bad to get bombed in Muninns.
---
&gt; Since everyone is posting ideas
---
Cool guys don't post idea threads.
---
'member when Nyxes were 35b on their own? Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
Up vote for grimlock reference
---
I agree. You have almost a week before the structure timer to get your shit out. If you have logged in during the time between the armor ref and the structure timer, you should have the luxury of asset safety. If you have been afk however, asset safety is there for player retention, not reward for being lazy. 
---
There is no risk vs reward anymore. The game is farming online. I'd recommend a pass
---
&gt; first paragraph
---
oh this gonna be good
---
&gt; Let me give you a little backstory. I have more than my share of health issues
---
okay this is bait
---
One of two things: its either still in the station you left it in if that still exists or it has been moved to asset saftey. If you log in while in space flying an Omega ship but your account is alpha you can still fly it until you dock.
---
One of my absolute favorites

I don't want to hear it from a group of people who regularly ostracize a huge portion of the player base (read: PVE players) because they don't proffer their entire fealty to the altar of molasses submarine jousting. What I give out, even at full volume, is a fraction of what nearly all of you blast out on a daily basis.
---
Even has the thing going on atm where there are tons people with 20 titan accounts and enough wealth to plex these accounts for a lifetime and then other plebs going ccplz nerf all this and prevent more people from getting 20 titan accounts. I often wonder whats going to happen when "mid game players" and new players no longer have the means to ever catch up to these players when all the isk faucets are plugged up. I bet people sitting on their stacks of cash are all rooting for all this to happen as well to cement their status. Damned if you do damned if you don't in eve bro. 
---
oh yeah that totally makes more sense in this context, my bad i retarded on that.
---
Just in case you would ever reconsider i would recommend looking into brave. We got space in 2 regions most of the pvp action happens in one and the other is very safe and quiet for doing things like pi so constantly watching local isnt a huge issue. 
---
Reduce Indy core time or just accept that they are big isk makers but are vulnerable
---
haha yeah
---
Hm... still depending on products etc... 15-25% more. But you probably have to put in double or more hours. P2 can be run with once-a-week maintenance of a couple of hours. Maxed P4 requires an hour daily per 3 toons, plus an increased risk as you must import/localbuy the P2 mats to run it. As everything else in EVE, the more you invest (money and/or time), the more you stand to gain and/or lose. Cause at the end of the day, you still have to ferry that P4 from the planets to your exporting base, risking getting shot down.
---
How self congratulating 
---
.. and never died?
---
Over/Under is set at 10.
---
There are no other games
---
It’s not betting if there’s only one outcome 
---
Why do people talk as if there's some kind of balance that CCP is looking for when it comes to Plex? 
---
&gt;CCP won't let Plex get above 1B isk,  they'll have a sale to regulate it
---
&gt;CCP won't let Plex get above 1.5B isk, they'll have a sale to regulate it
---
&gt;CCP won't let Plex get above 2B isk, they'll have a sale to regulate it
---
None of these have been true. There may have been sales that coincidentally line up, but CCP has never made a statement, nor have they consistently acted in a manner that shows they want to regulate it at particular values. 
---
 Bugs blobs bugs skins
---
It’s ok HiFi was dumb as shit anyway 
---
Goons dropping 30 fortizars In a system.....?
---
If it was moon based with an actual specific structure that during low power shut down adm's or increased gate rats to I insta locking frigs to pop travel ceptors and pods, not strong enough to take down a cruiser but certainly a major annoyance. That could be cool and would force people to be active in all their systems, even for low adm's to keep player "law" in their systems.
---
Took them months to release a statement on chat. 
---
The activity tracker goes down, maybe three people notice, and a news item on this was issued right away? Bizzare, honestly.
---
Most Titans and supers aren't built with highsec minerals... All those Rorquals aren't mining to build rifters and catalysts.
---
So, highsec mining will just carry on like usual. 
---
Well that's sad to hear. Gone are the days of being used as the bait for my pirate corp (if they still exist) =\
---
Thanks man. Nicer answer and. Really understand you point. Gracias.
---
Well more of minerals will be moved to higsec. 
---
Whose idea of a balanced game?
---
But from P0 to P4? 
---
Noone should be proud of catching a rorqual and super amirite
---
I'm so sorry this made your day 😂
---
Sooner or latter they have to create ISK sink, every game developer encounter this problem. 
---
And you think this is good game play?  I think its better to let the better one survive... 
---
If CCP nerf capitals to the extent nobody is rorqual mining to build them, then I assume people will stop rorqual mining and we'll go back 7 years when battleship fleets was a thing. 
---
On comms: "Shoot the jump freightor!"
---
"No STFU Shoot the Dreads switch targ- oh its dead"
---
Rorqs literally tackle themselves for 5 minutes at a time so yeah fuck people amirite xd
---
Would be nice if Zarvox calmed his temper and didn't swear every third word when it heats up.
---
I'll Double your isk
---
Remember when I brought the first marauder ever to the AT and we got fucking DUNKED? I cant stand any talk of marauders to this day.

[AAR](https://br.inyour.space/?s=2921&amp;b=8463180&amp;e=90&amp;t=feqbq) : TLDR, cyno into 3 rorqs w/ friendlies - rorqs die, Slyce/Darkness form and counter drop.

I like PI myself, but unfortunately every time I try to open it it crashes my computer :(

If someone gets mad enough at these cans, they might quit exploring and then there's less competition for the rest of us
---
What the fuck is going on here?
---
Sisi copies from tranq. If you can't fly titans on tranq, you would need to train skills for titans on sisi. Skill injectors are not seeded
---
We should be able to have mirrors to counter lasers. And tennis rackets to counter projectiles. Fuck it lets make it so we all show up to a fight, and its just a giant game of multiplayer pong in space.
---
Good post.  Though I would argue for getting sniper battle ships a 300km+ engagement range, over cynoes shut down.  Also an an alternative to 'jumping caps'.  One of the big problems the defender has, with out a titan bridger, its hard not to use caps for defense. 
---
Why not 420?
---
if you deliver shit to someone in a structure that dies they get a lossmail
---
even whrs have NS rorq alts now
---
caps are cheaper than some blingy battleships to go welp, so thats fun or annoying depending on what you want
---
small gang stuff is kinda tough with how many people seemt o just want to use capitals, but they tend to suck and the new triglavian ships are good cap killers, so thats pretty fun and ez way to meme on bad krabs.
---
t2 production needs moons, and dank moons make absurd amounts of money. 
---
the abyss expansion made it easy to be a solo person and make dank isk. its pretty hard and fun as well; as fun as PvE can be at least. theres a lot of variety in spawn types and so yeah the gila is still good at everything, you need to know how to use it right to really succeed. 
---
lots of nullsec-esque groups in wormholes now.
---
1) Because I'm not interested in getting ambushed by the Stratios you're camping that can with.
---
2) Because it would slow down my exploration.
---
3) Because it slows down my competition by leaving cans to check.
---
4) Because the site despawns an hour after the hack anyway.
---
screen cap the words "east tenerifis" from that document, son.
---
Sentence enhancers.
---
I'm not sure what the question is, but you don't actually need to know anything to try living in null / low / wormhole space. Knowing stuff will help you succeed, but depending on your goals what you need to know could be radically different.

I'd be willing to bet this machine is adjacent to a penny crusher.

Definitely consult your corp for help, EVE is all about utilizing your connections.  Fuck this sub.
---
This would be a great idea, I like the idea of giving BLOPs more roles than just being a toy.
---
You make me fucking horny.
---
the real question
---
They make the same isk as carrier and are worth supercarrier hull. Not everyone has 10+ rorqs and not every region is Delve. If you nerf rorqs too much people will just move to supercarriers/titans or mining on tens of barges.
---
you're a goddamn poet
---
Planetary Interaction 
---
Basically just grammar. 
---
Lots of rmters use alpha clones for highsec bot mining with t1 battleships, vni and gila ratting in nullsec, exploration bots in t1 explorer frigates, faction warfare botting in t1 frigates, and botting hauling missions with t1 haulers. So plex will only affect capital bot ratters which is still a good thing to kill off.
---
The only other thing i can see ccp doing to really hurt bots is rolling back the alpha clone limits so they cant use battleships or heavy drones. That still allows for t1 frigate/hauler bots as well as gilas but gilas are more expensive than vnis and could potentially be too costly for botters to make a profit.
---
I cant the steam because “doode”
---
It's unclear whether or not I'm allowed to shoot. 
---
Negative reviews come from veterans players who have forgotten that it's just a fucking game, maybe the best mmo to date, but they are so salted by their inability to actually win the game that they lash on ccp to #fixtheirshit but still continue to pay their account... And honestly when I see ppl saying "it was better before" I just want to slap them till they bleed out. 
---
Just for you to remember :
---
NO TUTORIALS, Upgrading clones, scanning and  bookmarking gates, large POS with bazillion of Hp. The fucking battleship miners... Was it really that good lads?
---
 I, for my part find eve way more accessible, but not easier, nor simpler. And it's the best mmo out here, period. Those same guys who spit at ccp face are still playing the game, Btw.
---
I pledge not to buy the cards until you are on one of them
---
I mean Init has killed rorqs without caps. And BL has killed dozens of excavators in a single day.  
---
There are issues with rorqs, but the current situation isn't unworkable. I don't think you should need to have a booshing 200 man bomber fleet to kill 1 capital ship, but it's a complicated problem to solve because of these super umbrellas. And the longer it remains unresolved, the bigger the super umbrellas get. The issue with rorqs isn't how strong they are, how much isk they make, and how much they combine to super proliferation. Any one of these problems can be fixed. But all three of these problems, perpetuating each other in this cycle? It requires a unique approach to balancing these things and I don't think CCP is capable of pulling it off without screwing it up.  
---
I think the way you balance Rorqs is by balancing the rorq hunting meta, not balancing rorqs.
---
We will rebuild!!
---
sorry m8 you made a dumb dumb.
---
if you train off remap, your skills train slower.
---
TBH I don’t see a huge point to getting upset about balance issues in this game. If one ship is more OP, then buy it.
---
This is much more a problem in a game where you are locked into your class and switching to whatever is OP would take 100 hours of effort to level up. But in this case, just buy the damn ship.
---
The bot shit was shit but the swallow with supercap balance got me.
---
That absolute genius still around somewhere?
---
You know clearing one site causes another to spawn, right? 
---
Booshing doctrines seem to work fine, supers can be easily defanged. 
---
Make sub cabs be able to simply ignore caps o. The field and this will play into what pgl and co want, able to load up the grid with subcaps and simply just ignore opposition capital fleet altogether.  If they find a way to counter numbers or have another force escalation method that is restricted in movement to offer some advantages to the defenders because you have a 50k+ taperium coalition that would jump at the chance to be able to simply block out the sun with subcaps and ignore the damage from capitals
---
My comment about the cost difference was aimed at dreadbombs. The cost of a dread after insurance is often cheaper than a faction bs and doesn't need support, nerfing fax to make dread bombs unstoppable regardless of mistakes made. A lot of people are blaming the fax for PGL dreadbomb not working. 
---

They are copies, but you can still try out new things if you have extra skill points on your main or alts. Plex is seeded on the market for dirt cheap, so buy plex from the market, then buy extractors from the store. Extract skills you don't need on SISI and inject the ones you want to try out.
---
I remember a while ago, maybe a few years now, when he tried to bring a battle Proc fleet through Delve(?) on his stream and was jumped immediately by a bunch of Hurricanes and a Tempest of all things and freaked the fuck out. Screaming and cursing on his stream for almost a half an hour on and off. 
---
It was arguably some of the cringiest shit I've ever seen from him and at one point he even referenced how killing his roams negatively impacts the popularity of the game.

Bruh, mission straight up says “Mission will not complete until your ship is destroyed.”  Agent also gives you a frigate to blow up.

HiFi or whatever left of it we merged into Militaris Industries, Zeta thinks he won EvE and left the game (again). So check NC if you find someone you will remember.
---
New stuff may be exciting, because you still have to learn how it works. Once you found out, everything is a stupid repetition of the learned techniques. Maybe you like the optimization of details to increase ISK/hour by the last few percent possible - then your fun lasts a little bit longer. But this gets completed, too.
---
That's not Eve specific, that's in each game and it's the reason, why PvE centred franchises have to release major expansions regularily. PvE without novelty is not engaging. Providing novelty constantly ties up a lot of development ressources, not for advancement, but just to prevent decline.

This is why i asked the question.

I miss the Naglfar having two turrets...
---
He was active with whatever northern shitters, I thought.. huh. Rip.
---
So would a 2 minute (for example; anywhere from 1-5 min has been suggested) spool up for cynos on a rorq.  Say all cynos have a 1 minute spool and capitals have a 5x modifier on that--now rorqs need a subcap cyno on grid, which in that 1 minute window can also be killed by subcap control.  If not, and the rorq lights the cyno, then the opposing fleet has 4 minutes to kill it with caps, assuming you fix panic.
---
It doesn't make it impossible to defend a rorq--it just rewards team cooperation on both sides.  
---
Seems like a bad idea as it would post my character's name, and system. It would simply put a larger target on my back.
---
like i said, you're a pathetic unfunny memer and I can't wait until this subreddit recognizes it and ostracizes you
---
These are highsec "Role-playing" griefers.
---
Overall I think they are good - simply as they add a tad of danger to highsec.
---
No mention in his work about cyno spool ups or spreading out anomalies either.  Imo you fix so much if you just give subs a 1 minute cyno spool up, 5min for caps, remove capital insurance, and take away siren mwd.  Reducing anomaly spawn rates would just be icing on the cake.
---
I'm producing the same. I plan on selling them one day but for the moment it replaces the ones I always forget when I leave a site.

oh ok cool thanks for the update on whose it was. 
---
Tenerifis isn't covered either.. As you said, the deal just says FRT has to get out of Tenerifis, but says nothing about attacks on Tenerifis. What it *does* say is no attacks on Legacy. Look at [Tenerifis sov](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Tenerifis#sov), Legacy owns the west, XIX the east. 
---
The NIP covers Legacy space/sov/structures, east Tenerifis isn't Legacy space and so isn't covered. Yeah it says no attacks on XIX 'for the moment' but as you said, it's up to Test's discretion and I guess it's passed.

Sir, this is r/eve. Posts are reserved for bitching and shitposting.
---
Alright so I fitted the carrier on the test server and Im practicing. So far, I am getting better at managing the fighters but its still a bit overwhelming. Also, I found it difficult to find anomalies, maybe Im just in a bad location or they dont spawn as frequently in the test server? I also find that my target locking is pretty weak, maybe its just my skills
---
You seem like a salty little man. 69 urself xD
---
I play eve.           
---
Like 420 is a 'thing' people use in this game for years.            
---
Fuck even some idiot sprayed this on a wall in my neighbourhood.        
---
Don't want to disappoint you but i don't care about 420 memes simply if someone killed 240 ships he should do 255 or 420 just for sole reason of making this more funny.          
---
If you don't know why 255 - it is quite simple, as it is FF 
---
I care
---
In terms of scalability the VNI loses to mining, especially the Rorqual. You can see the inbalance in the market trends - mineral prices trending down for a long time already. Minerals production grows faster than the production of ISK.
---
You compare the VNI to super ratting. The thing is: Both methods are actually done by intelligent people who know the game. This means they are both viable, they are balanced.
---
Actually we have a balance problem in PVE, and this is amongst subcaps. There are only very few types viable for PvE: VNI, if VNI tank is not enough, then Gila or Ishtar, for the hardest sites T3Cs or Rattlesnake. That's it, almost all of them droneboats. They are both the most convinient and the most effective. A few people use missile ships like the Drake (Navy Issue), but even these are not really competitive. Other ships are only used by newbies, who don't know better...
---
Maybe the weapons should get a bounty modifier as additional attribute, e.g. +10% if a rat is killed by missiles, +50% for artillery, ... This would reward an "active" playstyle more.
---
don't cut yourself on that edge there pal

In a stunning show of fighting spirit and dedication, Skillu has demonstrated its true might. Never again will we make the mistake of underestimating our foe. At 18:00 we formed a CTA fleet with all of legacy to support defensive and offensive operations against Skillu.  In response, Skillu mobilized it's great armada, and logged out their capitals. Unforming their fleet, they likely gave legacy a fierce roasting on their comms. Truly, Legacy has never faced such thorough verbal abuse from a dedicated opponent. We may have won the timer, and then some, but the war of words is far from over.
---
lmao made u form 2000 dudes to fight 50 dudes

Couple years ago, I would have agreed with you. But after living in null and (trying to ) run a corp, I've learned to appreciate them as, in a sick weird way, they help with the balance.
---
You now know they exist. Set them to red, and watch local. They enter system, dock up or cloak up. Simple. That said, there are systems they don't go to. My mining alt can afk mine in an orca almost all day without issues.
---
~~I approve this message.~~ Scratch that. Everyone approves this message.
---
As mentioned in the main post, getting base omega skill points is fine by me, it doesn't even have to account for attributes and implants. And if they want they can account for the current character stats, although I don't see it as necessary.
---
Finally, "it is never going to happen" is the kind of argument that doesn't bring any value. Based on that they would have never remove WCS from FW plexes, or loss of SP from being podded, or....

The cognitive dissonance that's required for this astounds me. Stay the fuck in school kids.

---
More importantly skill urself is not just a name. It is OUR way of playing Eve. We are a bunch of mean and vial shitlords, we scheme and plot, we have lots of patience to wait for the decisive moment and we do not hit people for fun. We always go for the jugular. Our hits are meant to kill swiftly and decisively. You have experienced it first hand. It is a lesson you will not forget anytime soon.
---
My advice (for the simple fact that you fought well and I do respect that) find a way, and I'd suggest diplomacy, to shake off the big target that you have on your back now (the beef is not only with skill urself). Continue with shitty remarks and stupid things in game or even look at skill urself and allies in a funny way and you are in for round two. We are more than willing to wait months or even more until you rebuild and we will hit you again, harder this time. Do you want that to happen again?
---
Good Bot &lt;3

I like the concept of ADMs, but I think they should be iterated on.  The bonuses from ADM should be halfed (60 minutes to 30 minutes, x6 on command nodes to x3).  Either that or it should be a little harder to hold high ADMs.  I like the concept though.
---
I can buy that. Proof that it's not the Rorqual itself is the fact that no one would dare use one in a low sec ice belt. Rorquals are only overpowered when they are under an umbrella, but then everything is overpowered under a freindly umbrella.
---
Baby steps
---
Jesus I thought the op was cringe, this shit is on another level.
---
In nullsec definitely, I've seen the 'same' site spawn again in the same system, and more than once.
---
It doesn't seem to work quite the same in J space, but I would be surprised if it didn't cause the site to respawn somewhere (in the same class maybe? idk).
---
I am usually in a Gila or Rattlesnake doing missions or crap. Not mining. And ya no one cares but there are plenty of assholes that will target me anyhow.
---
There was a brief moment after Phoebe/jump changes but before rorqs where there was a lack of (wide) umbrellas and things still cost money. It was mostly catching idiots trying to move, but still.

---
The game is healthy if a lot of shit dies. Cheap ships means players will throw them away more. 
---
Primarily access to much more memory for a single process which I believe can help in large fleet fights. Also means updating or removing a bunch of dependencies that are so legacy that they don't support 64bit.
---
Move ram available per client. 
---
No I get the feeling and it's completely legitimate. What I'm trying to say is: the relevant people already know everything they need to know
---
More RAM can be used so there should be less client crashes during big battles. 
---
I think the point about RMTers is that, with higher plex prices, the difference you could get for your money from rmter and legit way goes down, so less people will be inclined to risk the illegal way.
---
My Corp has recently moved out to Null, and since moving I’ve tried getting into VNI ratting. I can run up to hubs without too much trouble, but I am still new to null and keep getting hunted and killed by other players. I also just unlocked level 3 SOE missions and am working towards 4. Would it be more worth it to keep trying with null ratting or running lvl 3-4 missions for cash?
---
Nothing important really. Just your own client will be able to handle much larger battles without freezing or crashing. Yay for nullbears I guess. If only CCP actually spend their time on more useful things maybe we wouldn't have 15k real persons online compared to 50k years ago.
---
Good job I don't give a fuck about killboard stats, isn't it? haha
---
Idk it seems to have disappeared. I do have a lot of Plex.
---
The client can address more RAM, faster and can do floating point math faster and with more precision on 64 bit vs 32 bit.
---
This means the client can cache more shit, can pull it from  memory faster and maths are done snappier as well, this all combined will make for a smoother running and more stable client once it's fleshed out.
---
Clients won't be nearly as liable to freeze and/or crash in large fleet fights where there's N+1 things happening, for instance.

---
Maybe in the USA, here in Europe we have perhaps more antifa and they are prone to breaking things and surpressing free speach while such gangs are really not serving any purpose here except for feeling cool
---
Yeah, coordinating hundreds of players in a group with thousands.
---
My point is that Goons aren't *living* in that Keepstar. They're just using it. If they lose it, oh well. They have plenty more.
---
But a 10-man group living in an Astrahus? Most of their assets there, their wealth, etc.. If that's all lost, what then? Drastic changes to the way they play the game. Forget being able to mount a counterattack, or even immediately anchor another structure to start over -- they're starting from scratch back in high-sec because they lost their one and only home.
---
And that's the point of structures. Again, they're meant to replace stations.
---
Losing something is fine, but *we want people to keep playing*. If we make structures too risky for the majority of the smaller groups to own, then they aren't going to use them and they aren't going to keep playing for long.
---
It means that I can leave my effects on in DD slugfests.
---
Shhhh theyll figure out that we are actually input broadcasting our Titans and faxes
---
Yay no more crashing in this blobs.
---
Yeah this is exactly what code wants.  But to their point you are a valid target at all times in this game even in highsec.
---
&gt;but when you have a blue print for a Gila, or Worm from an escalation site, you are generally willing to do a little mining to curb the cost of materials a bit.
---
This is actually least efficient way to acquire a ship in eve, it requires you to train both mining and combat, not to mention refining skills if you want to actually save any isk.  Everything in eve is a commodity its generally better just to do whatever your character does best and then use the isk earned from that to just buy the ship you want.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Because structures aren't supposed to just be the new POSes. They're meant to replace POSes and stations.
---
CCP wants players to use structures. If they make structures too risky for the majority of smaller groups to use, then EVE is going to lose players.
---
I'd rather have a less dangerous EVE than an empty EVE.
---
Again, the issue with asset safety revolves around larger groups. If you go after a 10-man group that lives in an Astrahus, asset safety means fuck all -- if you put pressure on them, it will hurt. A lot.
---
But you can't do the same to a 1,000-man group. That's why asset safety needs to stay for the smaller groups -- it isn't an issue when it comes to them. If you want it gone, remove it for the larger groups instead. Anchor more than *x* structures, lose asset safety. No more spamming structures, no more easy staging, and it impacts the larger groups that were near untouchable before.
---
If I could take down an undefended, unfueled raitaru with my dread and a couple friends in less than an hour I'd be okay with that. That is a lot of ifs compacted into one though.

I really dont see what the big deal would be if the devs were like "hmmm xxx t1 cruiser is clearly op when compared to other t1 cruisers, so next month lets change its racial cruiser bonus to +4% from %5".  I really don't understand why changes like that seem to only happen with a major update small balance updates should be easy to make.
---
Of course its a bit delusional when its changes meant to drastically alter the role of a ship, but minor tweaks should be easy.
---
&gt; 420 just for sole reason of making this more funny.
---
i think this is his point, that you're a dumbass for posting a 420 joke
---
Yummy tendies. Guaranteed risk-free.
---
Ahh, the call of my people! I must go now. 
---
POS were superior to citadels. Limited availability because of moon anchoring restrictions, no real TZ tanking (mechanics made it guesswork), corp roles allowed hangars shared between alts so no pesky trading and shit was required to put an alt in a ship ASAP, if you left it unfueled it was fucked.
---
Fuck citadels. 
---
o lawdy
---
no brave was in their shitty position because of there own bad decision making. 
---
let's be real brave already moved the meta to recruit everyone with the pulse.
---
Let look at the groups: 
---
Karma there literally backed by the largest super fleet in the game, are you joking ? 
---
Right now the problem is the only way the play nullsec is to literally recruit everyone with a pulse and put them in rorqs, like a small group of high sp players lack any options or tools to engage a larger group of newbro's, because what are you gonna do they have more supers.
---
Stoned and late to the party.
---
https://youtu.be/kcL22cudKFI
---
&gt; Cynoes should reduce the stats of the equipping ship.
---
&gt;If the gimp is significant enough (to mess with survivability or dank ratting ticks) then people will have dedicated cyno alts per system. Not much will change.
---
I agree for the most part but the effect is that more subbed accounts will need to exist, and the effectiveness of the umbrella will be affected by availability of the dude who owns the alt. 
---
*My high...
---
Doubt it mate
---
But will I still be able to run 20 clients concurrent 
---
But only if you liked its service!
---
Umbrella regions will have an abundance of assigned cyno alts in systems. Many farmers will be on teamspeak and will be able to freeload. Farmers in less crowded regions will be forced to individually get cyno alts. That's not an extremely important deal for people with billions, but if you are a Thanatos ratter with a single account you'd rather be in a system where the protection is already offered, rather than a system where you have to multibox and pay monthly for an alt.
---
Nice Video!

Was a good fight - thanks for bringing it. If I had known flying Kiwi was recording I would have called him primary last :p
---
What kind of tank does it take to rat in nullsec? I’m running a fully shield tanked vexor with around 11,000 EHP (I’m on mobile so no exact stats) and 50% resists in the relevant areas, and I still get ripped to shreds as soon as I get within 30 km on a hidden den.

Weird... /r/eve always loses its mind whenever anything breaks. I'm having trouble finding any posts on this though. It's almost as if it isn't all that important and maybe CCP should instead focus on other elements of the game.
---
:thinking:
---
Just an opinion, my dude.  
---
Probably not...
---
It was a fun fight! Dead even on the isk!  Lost an apostle and a Rev but had a blast! 
---
You need to speed tank, not ehp tank. Drop all tank, 4 drone damage mods in lows, 2 tracking mods, 100mn afterburber in mids, make it cap stable, orbit at 45 (but 30 would prob work). And get a VNI with heavies.
---
Wormholes are going to be an awful lot more jumps away from k-space now :)
---
(2^63 rather than 2^31)
---
IM NOT YOUR DUDE, SISTER
---
I mean, does removing skill injectors now really solve anything? Seems like the problem has already been caused, there's no going back, it's not like CCP would ever rip a bunch of skill points out of character heads. Rorquals and mineral proliferation is a different conversation though.
---
Did CCP actually remove the tutorial mission chain for new players? The one with the drifter hive? A friend of mine just started and after two days he doesnt know how to even buy stuff, I told him, but I remembered the tutorials were pretty clear on this? Is my friend retarded or is CCP?
---
Wrong you but okay 
---
Even with them off it was a crapshoot, for some reason some clients tried to load more of the field. 
---
Ahem... Limited availability... In a single constellation you can have as much as a thousand moons, if not more. Even perimeter don't have a thousand citadels... 
---
 Citadels can be anchored in grid range of a stargate, which is an awesome strategic position pos can only dream about. Without mentioning the awfull uncommented pos code intricated with alliance code, causing the delay of bug fix or quality of life improvements for over 10 years (alliance bookmarks ? Alliance hangars? "public hangars"? )
---
Or, just, I don't know, creating a real backend for corporations, alliance and coallitions for roles and permissions... 
---
Acl are a pain in the ass I agree, but not as much as setting up your own corporation, having permissions that can override roles, etc... 
---
But yeah sure, fuck citadels, pos are better and absolutely not the cancer that impaired eve dev since their introduction...
---
What caldari ship is ever usually seen with blasters? All I ever see is rails.
---
Your not going to find a station you can dock at in Null sec (unless its provi) 
---
Just join a null sec corp
---
More love for Angels, ccplz!
---
Angel caps have been concepted, but for some unknown reason they were not introduced yet. Maybe because it's difficult to find the right balance for them without breaking the "theme" of the Angels' ship set.
---
so much text for so little an issue.
---
Those are likely limitations on the server-side database, not the client.
---
Even a 32 bit app can exceed 32 bit values - as they can store and process those as strings of bits - so that wouldn't really make sense as the limiting factor in this scenario. 
---
Not an attempt to ruin a killboard, but rahter an attempt to bring up a relevant issue &amp; make people heard. Why you gotta be mad?
---
Get 64GB RAM. That's upwards of 3GB per client. Should do fine. 
---
Harder to make irl money - ratting - slight decrease, still renters make money, mining - if ore rises as much % as plex does no real change
---
Lol
---
And usually you’ll find more profit in getting small items out to your null buddies fast, things like implants, t3c subsystems, faction or deadspace mods, and triglavian stuff that won’t be available in nullsec easily. I have made lots of money by getting an instawarp atron on an out of Corp alt to the wh hisec side, then I dock in an NPC station and contract it to my main who then only needs to be in 1 hisec system for maybe 5 minutes. This avoids war deccers, can be done on alpha accounts, and can make quite a bit of money.
---
&gt;**TLDR**: GREATLY increase FW reward from doing plexes,
---
yeah, let's buff botters and LP farmers just because you want to catch a couple more Atrons
---
I know a lot of people who enjoy farming in this game. Including me, but I'm weird.
---
looks like you lose
---
"OH MITTENS!!!"
---
Nice work. I just wonder why you dropped everything right at the beginning on 3 rorqs...
---
So the level 3’s I’ve been doing are still in highsec(.5, but still). I haven’t been actually AFKing, I started warping out when I saw someone come into the system I was ratting in, and they followed me back home in interceptors. Maybe the key is finding less busy systems, but I haven’t found many yet.
---
That sir, would increase amount of isk in game, by killing certain structures - a lot. I don't think EVE needs removal of isk sink.
---
yeah in your little strawman example as everyone like you always puts it, only the home team is going to use the ability to reinforce capitals. you always fail to see that enemies can do the same and choose to meet you on grid or not. that is better than what we have now. if i drop shit in my hometown JUST LIKE YOU SAID i am infinitely safe. meaning if sub caps come through my neighborhood i am infinitely safe to counter them with capitals, which is more anti-sub cap than the opposite. you are literally agreeing with me. thank you.
---
They brought in about 8 more dreads or so right after we jumped our subs in. 
---
We also thought you guys might have been sniffing around somewhere - this https://zkillboard.com/related/30002935/201902030700/ happened right after our cap fight
---
500? Are you just shitposting, cause it doesn't appear you have any idea what you're talking about.
---
Or lets do nothing and leave botters with a fucking accel gate and dscan. I never mentioned a specific value increase, hell it doesn't even have to be an increase my point was to make it more attractive to hunt in low sec by removing the gates from FW plexes and still limiting ship size. 
---
I see. FWIW I agree with your suggestions, I also think limiting cynos to the same hulls as covert cynos helps fix the problem
---
Better get used to it lol
---
CCP trailers are so damn cool. I'm just sad playing the actual game is nothing like shown on the trailers.
---
The atmosphere in these trailers are spot on.
---
Would be fucking cool to fly Astero inside a massive derelict ship like that.
---
-&gt; Actual game, 30m speed stuck inside some 8 polygon cube "fuck fuck fuck, move it"
---
Also can you put some god damn loot inside the Sleeper Data and Relic sites.
---
WHOA
---
How so? I never picked a side, I simply said whether or not he posts. :shrug:
---
I agree in wide parts.
---
Just adding if you havent heard: Capital ASBs are limited to one per ship by now.
---
Random, looks like a solo guy
---
Removing gates is removing one of the fee places you can take brawling frigs without getting kited to death
---
I don’t know what all these people are crying about.. They kind of remind me of how my grandparents reacted to technology and new stuff back in the day. People don’t like change. For my, after 2-3 failed attempts to get into eve, with no good mmos out to play, I finally got myself to tried my best to get into it, and you know what? I’m having a blast, even thought idk what I’m doing half of the time. I think people are just playing it wrong and not enjoying it the way they’re supposed to.
---
The area affected is so tiny that they are not worth using.   
---
There is 2,796,662,119,636,745,520,217 km3 space within range of that weapon on a fortizar. it covers 10km3  
---
it also takes 20 seconds before it hits the target you fired at, odds are they are no where near it anymore.   
---
If it was 100km, it might be useful, but i doubt it. 
---
Still has its fun and magic moments, so - just do it and go play without all the negativity stopping you.
---
Yeah i'm inclined to believe you, there are certainly 'younger' content creators out there but given how much time has to be invested to learn the main mechanics and nuances, its certainly true the majority of content creators and drivers are older players.
---
I don't know what the best answer is, I support the hardcore stance but the eve universe needs more players and after 15+ years I think its fair to say that if that original niche was big enough and provided enough revenue then CCP wouldn't have looked elsewhere. The whole trend of alpha accounts, injectors etc etc is that its making the game more casual. It might not be what we all really want but if CCP deems that's the market share they would like to accommodate for all i'm saying is, we might not get all that much of a a choice. We certainly don't seem to have so far.
---
death to the cherry pickers!
---
Did you not read the post? It would be the same exact mechanic you would land on the beacon at 0. The same way it is now... but without the added time of landing and taking the gate, the only people that would afffect are people that run from fw right now, especially botters. 
---
Agreed. Hypes you up for absolutely nothing in the actual game you start playing.
---
Wonder if the player retention questionnaires cover that exact question or not...
---
&gt; If we make structures too risky for the majority of the smaller groups to own
---
I have to admit, I don’t really think this applies to players. Most wormholes are inhabited by small groups of players working independently or semi-independently, and the bare minimum of entry into this ecosystem is a single citadel. Living in LS or NPC null gives you the fallback of using NPC stations to evacuate material and state out of. Even the price of a citadel is extremely small these days. If you’re farming to plex your account, you have to farm 1.7b, which is double the price of a raitaru and fit. If you’re subscribing, you could pay an extra 5-10 USD of your expendable income to buy a citadel. 
---
Perhaps this is a difference in our understanding of risk in this game. I think everything can be temporary, and replaceable.
---
Yeah, that was a good change. But you can still get nearly as ridiculous with normal shield booster plus cap booster - the cap booster isn't going to run out of cap charges either.
---
Totally agree, I'm an aussie player and my alliance majority is also i fc semi regularly and i dont carry on like that.
---
Also one big problem with these trailers is this. 
---
CCP show people who have never played EVE some damn cool stuff. They log into the game, do the tutorial and then go mine veldspar or level 1 security missions till they quit the game.
---
You are not doing very good job showing new players the exciting features EVE has, that would keep them playing.
---
Yeah, it works the same as a smart bomb but looks 1000x cooler. I wish smart bombs had those effects too.
---
Who hurt you, young bean?
---
I'm not your sister, buddy.  
---
&gt;CCP trailers are so damn cool. I'm just sad playing the actual game is nothing like shown on the trailers.
---
tbf this is how all game trailers are, actuall gameplay footage is rare. 
---
&gt; Citadels can be anchored in grid range of a stargate, which is an awesome strategic position 
---
you say that like its a good thing.
---
You lose control of where the capitals land on grid. A switched-on sabre pilot could align to the cyno when it lights, burn overheated, count to 20 and start bubblefucking - incoming FAXs land in the bubbles 70km+ out of repper range, ggwp, rorqs die before the response FC finds his big-boy balls and engages.  
---
Anything that delays response will cause more deaths, and more deaths is the point, isn't it?
---
Yes but the kite frigates land on your brawl a lot faster, did you read his post? Stop being passive aggressive when you have a terrible idea and people notice it’s bad 
---
More like "new, harder to fix crashing in the blobs"
---
You can, but will it feel the same? I never feel ready for big fights if I'm not in potato mode.
