There are all kinds of groups at any Eve event and you can literally walk up and meet anyone and have at least a 30 minute conversation and become best friends! My personal favorite was when I (a Gallente militia pilot at the time) stood outside of one of the round tables chatting with a Cal Mil dude for about an hour. We shot at each other quite a bit but damn we had fun reminiscing and hanging out!
---
*Side note - it’s fucking insane how many WH people come out at these events!
---
Only problem is it hasn't been maintained in AGES

Go there. Keep dying there until you figure it out. Make sure that you have

Find a good corp with a good community for introducing new players to LS and some resources to support you losing ships. E-Uni ("LSC is recruiting!") and RvB are ones which immediately come to mind.
---
Make sure that you have an income stream to support you losing whichever ships. This is a major factor in why people generally recommend that when you're starting out, you fly cheap frigates, then move to navy frigates when you can afford to do so.
---
People can and have and can and will.
---
Skins, rare faction ammo, expired drugs, event cosmetics, all are prime vehicles for this.

When we submit a ticket are you able to see the amount of isk we have? Do you ever laugh at people because they are poor?
---
I take your point. Thank you for highlighting this issue. As a non-industrialist, I can’t faithfully comment, but it sounds like player owned structures have a far more competitive rate than NPC stations. Do you think the issue is more with player owned structures (I should’ve clarified), or the tax rate in NPC stations for industry? Maybe CCP could make rates comparable but maintain limited slots on those NPC stations? I’d like to see meaningful changes to citadels that are equitable for everyone.
---
Probably a bit late. But im wondering what will replace small starbase installations. Like, i was experimenting and i can set up a starbase in an hour for less than 300m, but a station is extremely expensive and takes a day to put up. I was wondering if there was any thought for a small outpost sort of thing.

I see what you did there.

Our corp that has been killing them is #1 in Cache since we've moved in. Like you said, there a a bunch of ways to do it.

However, when they're using Myrms and Praxis, and are using Alpha clone bots that cost nothing to to make when they get banned, we're not making a dent.
---
1060 6g with proberly a new cpu 6600 or 6700 eve can be quite cpu intensive 
---
I for instance run 10 clients paired with 8700 and 1070 and it pushes both the cpu and gpu to max
---
rumor has it if you whine enough they'll get rid of time zones so you too can have meaningless items
---
That's a great idea. We could even call it a "Cynosural Beacon".
---
You can fight blobs if you take advantage of their desperation for kills. They won't just see you and leave if they fail initial tackle. Use this time to dock and refit to counter their comp, if it's a bunch of Ashimmu you wont need tank you need triple mag stabs and neutrons for example to melt them asap. Every one you kill is worth more than your insured bs, if you know you're dying blow up the wrecks like a madlad.
---
Also keep in mind while a cap booster 3200 gives more cap per second, 800s can be spammed more frequently and give just enough cap to turn on two armor reps. If you're getting neuted to zero after every inject the 800s are superior for this reason.
---
If you're fighting people who are going to bring battleships fit triple rep dual cap booster and just whittle them down with the aid of gate guns, as people with large ships will have no fear of engaging you on gate. This can be a grave mistake for them.
---
Solo bs pvp is all about tricking your opponents. They know what your ship can do when they plan to engage and it's up to you to prove them wrong and confuse them.
---
It also seems to make it harder to report bots, which is unfortunate.
---
I mean you dont need level 5 cruiser for the enforcer, you just need the recon skills which is pretty easy, hulls aren't TOO terrible either....still sucks that its so expensive
---
I'll go back to my tinker rattles. I mean before these changes there was no risk in super or titan rating if you was in a good alliance
---
No asset safety seems to work.fine in WHs and they all seem to love it. Dont even have to fully get rid of it. Make it like 30% on larger structures and then not at all on ratarus and astras. Or even just no asset safety or 50% chance drop 50% asset safety on low powered. Something to make it more rewarding/costly for structure spam and not fueling
---
Join Horde. There are shit tons of people to fly with. They have small gang interest groups. Hell, you can even ping to form one and take it out hunting.

---
they shit on enough titans to hold their own.
---
I actually agree on all points. Well said. The notion of buffing citadels offensive capabilities was mostly an afterthought and not well though thought out on my part.
---
I will say, I do genuinely think that removing asset safety will provide for the occasional worthwhile drop, especially when combined with a two timer system on small structures. I used to love seeing things like a fitted super drop from a POS module. While I know that this is rare, it’s not even possible with current citadel mechanics.
---
are you sure mission rumning doesnt generate isk?
---
So if you are more into roaming and such possibly look into WH corps. Either c2 with null static or i think C4 may be the ones that do mid size like 10-20 brawls usually. Could be wrong on size for the second part

You lost that one in Amamake.

If you want to solo, roam. As in actually roam and avoid these obvious clown systems. Just set some destination into a semi-random system deeeep in null. And just see how far you make it.

Oh yeah definitely, they did really well, didn't mean to imply otherwise if it came across that way.

Hauling and trade... not so well for isk. Try doing PI. Get 5 planets and make robotics. 4 pull the raw and react the basic. Use the 5th to build the refined and specialized. Easily make more in a week than hauling.
---
I love your attitude!  Keep it up and you will be great. 
---
One thing you can do to accelerate that learning curve is look at some zkill losses (hopefully from reputable corps/players) of the ships you're interested in, and copy those to pyfa.  There you can start to get a deeper familiarity with what different fits do and what you can expect.  Sometimes if you look at an enemy ship and observe a certain weapon system (e.g. 720mm arties on a cynabal) you can know exactly what they're going to do based on the basics of that type of fit.
---
No way it was that high, two weeks would be almost 700k SP, that would be an average of 25k SP/day over 28 days. The average seems to have been much lower, most people got a ton of 10k days and very few 25/50s.
---
The 400k OP got is about 8 days of training, I only missed two days of the event and got less than 300k but I think I was pretty unlucky.

I honestly wish there was a bot hunting group that didn't have Bias.........  
---
and to not cop out to using bots as a reason for recruitment during a war  
---
Eg; Tapi won't go after their army of mangos who we have seen do the exact same thing..  
---
Goons actively let their period basis boters bot in peace who do the exact same thing..  
---
Darkness boots alliances from their coalition because they call out botters  who do the exact same thing..  
---
We activly kill anyone thats a bot in Brothers of Tangrea, but the truth is I'm sure some of us have rose tinted glasses  
---
You know what really needs to happen?   
---
a Discord thats for all sides to actively hunt botters, or at the very least one where people can poke leaders of alliances about suspicion of boters   
---
Lets stop using bot hunting as a war recruitment tool, and use it to actually hunt bots! :)
---
&gt;While you may think that the two cases are identical, they were most likely not the same. 
---
I mean the case highlighted service as a nice contrast example, how identical they really are isn't all that relevant for illustration your employer has publically endorsed a player a couple of months after calling in another player a faggot in public, like do you not see how this might seem a bit unwelcome. ( being allowed to sit on the CSM is an endorsement by CCP ).
---
&gt; As per usual, we cannot go into too much detail, unless it's specifically your account we're talking about.
---
There comes the excuse train again, you're to this very day presenting this player as an outstanding member of the community to the point that he considers representative of the eve community and the person CCP will talk to for advice on interaction with the community AKA a member of the CSM.
---
Yeah, you might have told him privately hey stop calling people faggots it gives are PR team nightmares but really all the punishment I can see said player had for this is a free trip to Iceland. 
---
Now the other player's punishment is important because of the context it gives, namely that you will disqualify from the CSM for behavior so it means you have not deemed behavior of CSM members representative of CCP, if you had not done this a simple hey CSM members are responsible for there own behavior might have been valid but that ship sailed. 
---
Therefor from the outside looking in, I can really only draw the conclusion that CCP is if not outright encouraging this behavior at the very least accepting enough that such behavior is not disqualifying for public CCP endorsement.

Every Wormhole has a finite lifespan, usually either 16 hours or 24 hours. If you Show Info on a Wormhole, it will show a message about how much life it has left, either "Has not begun its cycle of decay" (&gt;=24 hours), "Won't last another day" (&gt;4 hours), or "End of natural lifetime" (&lt;4 hours; "EOL" as we call it). Additionally, if the wormhole is EOL, the wormhole itself will be very visibly wobbling, as if it wants to collapse but is pulling itself back. Be very careful when jumping into an EOL hole, because if you find a hole and it's EOL you have no safe idea how much time you have before it dies. It could have 3 hours, it could have 3 minutes.
---
The second alternative is that if you checked D-Scan and saw a group of battleships (Megathrons and Praxis are popular for this), it's possible that the local residents of the wormhole 'rolled' the hole (forcibly collapsed it by throwing too much mass through it.)
---
It is the manufacturing bonuses and somewhat the taxes, though less so the taxes. The rigs make it significantly cheaper, material wise, to use structures over stations.
---
If the structure is vulnerable to attack then the bonuses better be good or else no one would use them over stations in HS and LS. The problem is not that they out compete stations, they should. The problem is if you make them too vulnerable the cost benefit of having them changes. They are kind of an all or nothing thing: either they will be better than stations and everyone will use them, or the risks will be to high and no one uses them. 
---
IMHO they should have more timers, but no asset safety. Industrialist are the type of players to hire people to defend their structures. That takes time. They are the type of players with the most to lose in terms of asset destruction. Everyone else is used to just buying from the market after a loss, it is their norm, it is a bit different for industrialist. Make them question whether they should evac their stuff or not. Give them time to wrestle with this over several timers while they haggle and bargain for help. Plus this will mean supply lines could be effected in null. Maybe...
---
Poses had shields which were superior to tether, no reason for it to lose that.
---
My primary income is shooting PI industrials. Beats doing PI myself.
---
More skill points than isk?
---
Unless the moon has a bugzapper POS on it, which gets you instapopped. Actually is safer to warp to celestials at that point, until you've confirmed there are no POS towers on the moons.
---
When ccp said minor conduits are for 1-3 players, they lied. I questioned a gm about this and they just said working as intended.
---
The easy solution to this is to just pay the bounty out when a player actually retrieves their items. Yeah it sucks not getting the payout right away, but it can't be exploited because it's purely isk in = isk out.
---
Keeping the ability to teleport assets to the nearest lowsec system fixes this. Making it so that a player has to actively request the teleport, and putting a two week timer on it where the assets are still in the citadel vulnerable to drop gives the best of both worlds. Making it automatic was the dumbest thing ever. It just reinforced risk averse behavior. 
---
Taking five mins before an extended leave to save all your stuff at the expense of an isk loss seems fair to me. It would also cut down on some of the spam since people will actually lose their stuff if they just leave their junk lying around.
---
Something very similar to this was done back when LP payouts for kills in FW were based on the value of the ship killed. People found unused items, mostly cosmetics, and bought them all up, before selling them to themselves for billions. 
---
Once the in game estimate adjusted to this new value, they loaded up their alts with the items and killed them, making hundreds of billions. 
---
So, given that this has literally happened before, yes, I think it would happen again
---
Dude put on a long point and keep it preheated, dont MWD until the bomb goes off and if the guy makes any kind of mistake with his alignment you'll probably get him. You can weather the bomb no problem as long as your MWD is off so just take the hit and try to grab him as he makes his run. Once you get him pointed you win so that's the game.
---
I see... So that means that we will have a weekend skill special next, right? O.o
---
I generally agree with this.
---
“before these changes there was no risk in super or titan rating if you was in a good alliance”
---
I was referring to this tired old line. Shit died in Delve every fucking day, Olmeca created an industry, a pile of isk and a CSM campaign out of stealing Excavators, but the rest of sit around and whine about safety and no risk, all the while NOT adapting to the changing metas of the game.

The previous relationship was mainly due to cheap wholesale titans, which they've now used to reach critical mass. As well as a certain amount of backup if serious assets were ever threatened as back then Panfam we're next door and poking/proxying so it made sense. Panfam aren't really what they used to be now and with other powers rising and falling I wouldn't over analyse that past with Imperium, it was/is a marriage of convenience. Right now they seem to still get good fights closer to home so that's the main thing that motivates things.

It's not though. Most anti-cheat software runs in the background and will detect other programs that are being run. It could detect software that is being used to bot and keep the game from launching. They could also check for keystrokes or mouse clicks that happen at certain intervals that no person would be able to duplicate, for instance, a keystroke exactly every 5 seconds.

-didn't load null  
---
-all drones in bay  
---
-probably didn't heat his own ab  
---
-killboard indicates poor execution in general
---
ok i might be a little mad (and maybe a tad bit sad) that no one fed navy comets (pun not intendedn't) like that to me in my fw excursions  
---
but i just can't see how a comet gets scramkited by one of the slowest t1 frigs, the math just doesn't check out without piloting or fitting errors.
---
what's for certain however, is that it does happen. so keep on taking chances, just know that if the comet does 70% of its job right, you'll have to go back home in a pod- a dual web tormentor will have a good chance of disengaging ofc.
---
I mean I have alts, screens, chat records, etc... lol

Best GM reply :D

"This was a mistake on CCP's behalf, and I sincerely apologize for that.  I am crediting each account you had banned with 60 days of Omega game time"
---
Storytime: Was banned last year with that mass chineese boter clearing. Turns out that i was ratting so hard (more then 7h a day) that they thought i was bot and got banned for it :D 
---
It was not an easy task to convince GM team , but eventually my case was reviewed, i was false positive, and i thought decisions are final, but thanks to GM team who actually really looked into the case i was proven innocent. I just wanted to clear my name, got that , and a little bonus.
---
Thanks   **CCP Game Masters**
---
Keep up the good work :)
---
Have you ever thought about contacting people that play for FUN(or), rather than sort and mittani, Gobbins and so many vomit VETS. Just ask the person with no link to any,, IF they are having fun.
---
How did they look after the fight?
---
Yeah it's Tar. Tge Triglavians have hacked the Traffic Control system. That's why the system info is all scambled in alien letters.
---
Chinese alliance on DeadCo
---
lmao imagine being this salty. 
---
If it's the only conceivable way to make isk, why don't you roll some alts and go take a farm hole? Or, if you can't commit toons to that, get a system with WH generator upgrade and start daytripping with your friends for ISK. It's that simple.
---
That's hawt.

I've been to Vegas twice and Fanfest once.
---
My first time at Vegas I went with a friend (former corpmate and now Goon... the Goon part was a little awkward but I got to meet Major Sniper, which was a plus) and it was pretty good.
---
At Fanfest we had a group Discord for the coalition, and that was super fun. Except the coalition and the alliance disbanded halfway through the event. That wasn't as fun.
---
My second time at Vegas we did the Discord trick, some of us were in an AirBnB, and we had a Google Doc coordinating things to do so we could plan out options months beforehand. Much better.
---
Vegas can be fun, but make sure you go with friends. Just like internet spaceships, it's more fun to derp around with your mates than it is to sit alone in an overpriced hotel room.
---
Ignoring the fact that that middle ages parallel isn't valid to space ships, this is actually how it did work. Armies would create siege camps, and if they lasted long enough, they would be well fortified. It's also always a terrible idea to leave the safety of your castle, so you wouldn't really ever attack it. If you did, the element of surprise at night time would be the best option.
---
The players intention was to get the exploit patched. Instead of removing the exploit you stopped the player from providing a "service" by blaming system load on the kill mails. Root cause still exists and everyone involved lost.
---
I'm not sure though
---
*Grabs data feed from hundreds of target painters*
---
Oh, it is an avatar. Alright then.
---
First, we're talking about slightly different things.  I'm just saying how it is, not how it *should* be.  I'm addressing how wrong the original comic is.
---
One of the most core mechanics of this game is a cat and mouse type thing.  One player is set up a bait for an extended period of time and offered as a plaything that the cat can catch.  Nobody likes being the plaything, but they do it for isk.
---
One of the most interesting comments someone mentioned was that there was a time when there was enough roamers that they'd run into each other.  I think with blackout and other changes, we might be heading back to that time.  Especially if CCP ups pirate bounty payouts, which it seems like they might do after a couple more MERs.
---
&gt;that can punch through the remote reps on a 60 man sleip fleet 
---
I've never seen a 60 man slep fleet from anyone in J space. But regardless it's easy. 
---
Just keep a boosher on the hole while you're rocking nano. Boosh off some ships, boat up there, damp their logi and kill the booshed ships. 
---
It ain't rocket science.
---
The target painter is not a sensor.
---
I guess one better way to resolve botting is to make it less repetitive, more difficult and more fun. While EVE is PVP based, the PVE is the foundation of any PVP that can be done, and its current state is pathetic.
---
There's a reason why I never heard of Incursion bots or Abyssal bots. Yet.
---
Her we can see how the game calculates where your shots land.
---
Yep
---
A painter would never be a censor.
---
It also opens you up to liabilities for laundering money.

Pew pew
---
How many questions did you plant? 7x accounts

Unfueled citadels shouldn’t have any timers.

And remove asset recovery from nullsec
---
 Panem et circenses
---
I hope they do. I'm all in favor of ratting feeling rewarding. Now that there's actually some risk associated with ratting, can actually tweak the numbers without it being ridiculous. Formerly it was just a pure faucet with no real associated sinks.
---
...this was about an Astero...a frigate...
---
Or... &gt;jump into wormhole &gt;quick 360 scan &gt;probe down sites &gt;do the sites &gt;warp off if you see anything on dscan/grid.
---
Yes, MOAR! xD
---
"allow me to ruin my clients"
---
You already are...  /s
---
If you want to multi-box, you need to spring for a beefier CPU and GPU (IF multiple are viewed at the same time across several monitors). I'd invest in a single UW screen for when you want to focus two clients at once, and maybe a couple 27" monitors above the UW to manage browsing or going up to 4x clients at once if you need to.
---
I used to run 3x screens and 4x accounts. The only way this was viable, was with an actual gaming rig. I built a PC for it as my hand-me-down Frankenstein PC that ran one client fine... did not do so for 4x clients. CPU will be the major bottle-neck and if you are going to upgrade CPU, that usually means MOBO, possibly RAM... so you may as well go all-in at that point.
---
As someone that budget-gamed for decades, I can say that I wish I had built systems for the task sooner and enjoyed my time more instead of "making do." If this is your actual hobby, then put the time/effort/money into it. If you can't afford to... well, there is always a way if you really want to do something.
---
I went from hand-me-down PCs and a budget-built machine I put together... to having one of those overblown RGB-lit monstrosities and a 49" UW monitor.
---
Wish you luck, as a former 4-boxer who now runs a single account for the time being.
---
Quit being a cunt, jesus.
---
It all depends. In this game you will lose most of the fights you take if you don't have a plan on how to win before the fight starts.
---
Make sure you have good skills for a BS. Make sure you are fit so that you can apply to smaller targets. 
---
Pay attention to local and d-scan. If you can know that more ships (like a blob of ashimus) are going to land many seconds before they are active on grid, you can be warping off before they can do anything to you.
---
Target selection is key. Don't worry about tackle right away, if you're there to fight kill their logi and hope they don't have damps. Once the logi are down then prioritize according to what is most dangerous to you and also, and very important in a BS fight, what DPS can you get off the field quickly. 
---
For solo BS's having a Neut to turn off a scram, MJD, and a safe to warp to has gotten me out of many a fight.
---
Your rifter SAAR rep number was off because you weren't set to omni damage profile.
---
"...You smell that rabbit?"
---
Booshing off tether is dumb. Its like whats the point of tether if every gang will just boosh you. It makes sense why you cant.
---
My brain says it stands for Sin Meyers Civilization V, but perhaps I'm not sufficiently indoctrinated into EVE yet :P
---
lol that guy is right. it already happened when ccp tried it for faction warfare.
---
Question: When multiboxing and the lag starts what is the CPU and GPU load in percentage?
---
ÈWhile structure bashing is a part of life in EVE, it shouldn’t be like pulling teethÈ

dude ever since they introduced POS its been like this...
---
He ded.
---
Not really a painter, I'm not seeing the ship change colour.
---
did the orca live?
---
I went last year with a few corp mates and had a blast. Try to find some people you know that are going from your group if possible. There was an Eve Vegas Discord last year, I imagine there is one this year too.
---
It only pays isk to the alliance when the player actually pays the isk to get the item out of safety.... your non-problem is solved.
---
How about we design drones to kill drones ?
---
GOTTEM
---
Awsome Video bro. Waiting on the Titans:)
---
Not a GM, but sleeper tend to have a higher number of ships that point compared to missions, so your ship was likely pointed.
---
lul
---
"Painter" refers to how the laser "paints" the target, creating a light bloom that can be easily seen and locked on to by ship sensors. It's decently common military terminology, see also "painting" or "lasing" a target to lock weapons onto it.
---
Tbh get link/mjfg command dessie alt is way to go.
---
You need at least tackle inty alt to ‘force’ the fight in your favor.
---
but command dessie alt is the best cuz you gets extra option and links for better tank/skirmish,
---
something like booshing enemy’s logis or bhaal against fleet which you can’t deal against in solo.
---
Target priority is always different
---
For example I’d not primary deimos if I’m in maelstrom but I’ll like to primary deimos if I’m in a tempest.
---
Every bs and every fit has different dps and tank, also utility so you must consider how much you tank, dps you have, escape option when things go wrong. Sometimes you must kill T1 frig first when it removes your escape option.
---
Checking about blob is matter of research about local, same group tends to do same thing. If you don’t have time to do it just follow lussy lou’s footage and go where he went with his solo bs. (he is famous and very good about it)
---
Also if you really want to go true solo without alt and local research, fly kite bs like kitey tempest or at least something like full neut domi so you’ll not get blobbed that easy.
---
Wait I love this hyperbole post, but I don't understand why it reminded you of that .. Oh because there's three keys to push haha. I was rereading my post to find a grammar error hahaha.
---
Whoosh
---
Goddamed lowseccers with there locals grrr.....
---
had snuff actually brought their FAX in on the right cyno its highly possible they only lose like 1 titan overall and kill 5 or 6.
---
GOTG had nowhere near fax for the fleet they had. If they bring a proper group of FAX then its highly possible they killed 5 or 6 and only lose 1 titan overall
---
Many things could have happened, but what did happen is in the record books.
---
It's hard to say overall which would have been the better call for range because your dread reserve, fax reserve, etc all determine if that is or isn't the right call and we cant see any of that data
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78511499/
---
why is that bad?
---
Someone tell me how to get in on this kind of action please! I started playing EVE because of all the crazy battles I heard about, but never actually been in one.
---
I wouldn't do the drifter with any subcap except maybe leshaks, or too many subcaps.
---
Yes at first you only do garrisons and as you get more sp you can do strongholds, and as you get more you do the sites faster and require less blingy rattles
---
What's the track?
---
&gt;Asset safety is important for people that have extended illnesses, job loss, travel, and other life events. Eve should be difficult, not cruel.
---
Send an email to every single hard account in the game, give them 30 days to remove their assets using asset safety before you pull it.
---
Then they don't have a leg to stand on.  Store a reasonable amount of goods in a station, keep most of your value in your wallet, and if you lose too much thats on you.
---
Anyone who steps away for 3mo+ doesn't deserve to expect to come back to assets in a citadel IMHO.
---
Did you push ur specs up the bridge of your nose before writing this post
---
CCP standings that can be repaired by doing missions for CCP, and by turning in pirate tags (ahem botters). Yay!
---
Init was bombing off bubbles from the Snuff titans so I guess a few got killed from that also.
---
In a.C5 with very large to hi sec four times in past few weeks, normal or spooooooooky?     You be the judge.
---
This specific Avatar was killed as part of a anti-botting thing CCP runs occasionally. When they ban accounts for RMT they sometimes teleport the capitals into high sec for a public execution. Kinda like Runescapes Botany Bay.
---
To take part in big capital fights though, your best (simplist) bet is joining one of the larger null groups. 
---
Off the top of my head, the most relevant groups have newbro corps:
---
Brand Newbros (Test Alliance Please Ignore)
---
Karmafleet (Goonswarm Federation)
---
Pandemic Horde (Leader of the Panfam Coalition ^^^^^fightme )
---
Brave Newbies (Brave Collective)
---
So we can further structure spam systems without structures?
---
I cancelled multiple subscriptions and (very easily, with screenshots of my GM interactions) convinced quite a few friends to do the same thing. Do you plan on getting some GMs that actually play the game who aren't so obviously ignorant of how the mechanics around some of your many gamebreaking bugs work?
---
Easy kill. I’d suggest people bring fast ships as they spawn a few hundred km apart.
---
Not absolute but all the "pvpers" claimed it was a solution after alot of people told them will not work, and only will hurt the player base...
---
So now the botters are still here and the players are leaving the game...
---
That's pretty hilarious and awesome on CCP's part. Thanks for the info! I'll try to get involved with one of those. Most of my time in null involved shooting rocks, time to switch this boat to missile mode.
---
Reminds me of Starfleet trying to blow up the Borg cube in Star Trek: First Contact
---
What is pipe bombing and how does it work?
---
Do solo PvP in FW with T1 frigates. For only 5-12m a ship including fit, you can go fuck up repeatedly and learn from it very cheaply. You'll also meet people that more often than not will be happy to give advice and more. Google "Novice Frigate Yearbook 2019" for fits and basic concepts.
---
Are there any additive bonuses, or are all bonuses multiplicative? 
---
For example, if I am flying the Gila (500% medium drone damage) and have medium drone 1, is that 5.00*1.05 or 525% medium drone damage, while if I have medium drone 5, it would be 5.00*1.25 or 625% medium drone damage?
---
I just make T2 with PI since I have IV all (or 3 for advanced planetology). Are you in WH/Null?
---
Well I can safely assure you that I don't need anyone to tell me to downvote your crap.
---
If he's inexperienced a Dessie will be a better choice, gives him time to work out where he makes any mistakes.
---
Don't give them ideas :(
---
You'll need two characters to do it efficiently. I was making integrity response drones with 10 planets and did fairly well in high sec. But, I later realized I could make decent P3 with 5 planets, and double that with 10 on two characters... plus it's less confusing. Either way two characters is pretty good for P4. Look at is as a supplemental income, I wouldn't put all my eggs in the PI basket. So, the less work the better. I had mine on daily extractions at one point, then pushed it to every 3 days.
---
superior in what way? Tether actually reps your ship and modules, POS shields never did that.
---
&gt;Making it so that a player has to actively request the teleport, and putting a two week timer on it where the assets are still in the citadel vulnerable to drop gives the best of both worlds. 
---
Not to someone who walks away from the game for a few months or years and comes back to find everything they ever owned was deleted because a station died.
---
Its like no one realizes that the second that change went through people would just start storing anything of insane worth in an NPC station.
---
if you can't tell the difference between losing every asset you have in game because you had to walk away from the game for a few weeks because you/family member/friend came down with a serious illness or was significantly harmed, and dying in your VNI because you had to answer the door while ratting you are a lost cause.
---
The issue is not getting the right fight. For getting a good fight in brawl battleships I recommend:
---
The Blueball Method
---
How it works is you keep showing yourself to the blobby locals but keep tantalisingly out of reach. For example in lowsec, you might start at a station, warp to a cluster when scouted, then warp to a large plex at range, align off to a station, then wait till they bring their blob in and you warp back to station. Do things similar to this over and over until their balls are blue and swollen. This will usually end in them doing something dumb like bringing some kind of cruiser or tackle to get you first, at this point you strike, you kill the bait/tackle real quick and warp off before the backup arrives.
---
I'm just coming back to the game, the killmail for this says it was lost in 1.0 space, is this right? I thought you couldn't have capitals in highsec?
---
Here is the link I pulled from this thread https://zkillboard.com/kill/78519672/
---
I was speaking about bot proliferation, but you're not wrong.
---
Well, 2 rattles running the drifter is extremely difficult, pretty much not doable. With 2 nestors and domi it's super easy. Takes awhile to kill (about 30 minutes) but either way. Again. You have to really bling out the rattle where as nestors can be fit with t2 and work just fine. I get you like the rattles, but there are better ships. And the nestor is one of them.
---
caldari missile boat is my fave :)
---
&gt; Not absolute but all the "pvpers" claimed it was a solution
---
It is an incremental solution. Makes bot lives harder.
---
&gt; people told them will not work
---
A simple look at Dotlan shows that it worked.
---
&gt; So now the botters are still here 
---
Not some of them. And others have harder lives.
---
&gt; players are leaving the game
---
A couple of your friends leaving doesn't mean a net loss for the game.
---
&gt; funny how you still try to defend the fail of the blackout lool
---
I just obliterated every single point you made.
---
Thank you for reminding me about gate crashing!!! I did it! Not a battleship but I flew a Hurricane to do something cheaper and I snagged this guy while his fleet was stuck on the other side of the gate:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78546002/
---
Died shortly afterwards but his ship was 3x the cost of mine!
---
So are bombers
---
bombers are frigates
---
30mil fully fit “frigates”
---
Why not use the billboards as an ISK  sink? You could charge advertising fees for Corps to recruit. Or let anyone make an AD for whatever purpose.
---
Yeah but then he'll face nerds in blinged assfrigs with 1B+ pods inside small plexes, and getting caught on gates and other instances of accidental PvP is more likely. Not to mention that a T1 destroyer with T2 modules is 2-3x more expensive than a frigate, and in fact not too far away from a fitted T1 cruiser. Frig vs frig isn't THAT fast unless you're flying a kiting ship and warp to 0 on a brawler. I get your point because frig vs frig is largely already decided in the first few seconds of the engagement (especially in the case of brawl fit vs scram kiting or kiting), but there's still plenty of time to make observations and even log data you can analyze afterwards.
---
In wormholes instead of asset safety everything gets spit out into space.  So you deliver a bunch of ships to a person, blow up the citadel, and now the target has a bunch of ships they own in space..  When you kill those ships it "ruins" their killboard.
---
I mean, I don't disagree. With SP, they're a better choice. But SP = isk haha.
---
I'm more interested in nestor vs leshaks then. One potential downsides of leshaks is they may cost more, and harder to scale (with 4 leshaks you have to switch reps around and constantly focus a new rat to kill, but at the same time each leshak should aim a different rat because of spool up so I'm not sure)
---
As someone that does a bit of building, at the moment we can just dump freighterloads of stuff into a Raitaru confident that there's no incentive to attack it. My production hub has perhaps 50b of materials and 200b of blueprints in it.
---
Were the place attacked, I'd lose the Raitaru and any build jobs in progress (usually none, and almost definitely nothing once a wardec goes live), and the attacker would get half of the jobs in progress (ie nothing).
---
Attackers know this so they don't bother attacking, even if they had good intel on my Raitaru and knew it had a quarter trillion in assets in it.
---
This shouldn't be how it works.
---
We did that once and then WH players complained for months about it.
---
&gt;let's not kid ourselves, if CCP actually cared about botting the main would be banned as well because they would have done the same research you did to identify all other related accounts.
---
ftfy
---
Currently faerlina, but we are going to re evaluate friday and see if we swap. currently have 5 guilds and groups committed to all staying on same sever, both factions
---
Never seen this concept, seems cool.
---
B-r link?
---
Long story short, putting up a drag bubble right before a fleet warps (cant be caught if the bubble goes up after you start warping, and if the scout sees the bubbles they wont warp, so timing is important) and have like, 40 or 50 smartbomb equipped Rokh's or equivilant. The entire enemy fleet dies before they exit warp. Its glorious.
---
A normal corp with SRP and shit will not last long if the FC decide to welp the whole fleet each time..
---
You might be more interested in micro gangs groups that will undock what's needed to kill something instead of a having a fix comp
---
Do they ever advertise when they are doing one of these in advance?
---
don't forget bubbles!
---
Put a bubble on a star or something, get a safe above it. So that when you warp to it you're not on the bubble but at optimal range of those who land in the bubble. If you have a saber friend you can put the bubble up 10s or so after you warp off, their tackle will land on the first bubble and the rest of the fleet on the other (if you time it right)
---
I would recommend a nano rhml phoon, works very well for that style of gameplay
---
-- It is an incremental solution. Makes bot lives harder.
---
I dunno why you belive it makes theyr harder, they only need more alfa accounts and now they lose less..
---
-- A simple look at Dotlan shows that it worked.
---
And how do you know exactly that what you see in the map are botters and no real players?
---
--  Not some of them. And others have harder lives.
---
Again  how dou you know?
---
-- Some null farmers leaving over a change doesn't necessarily mean a net loss was caused by the change.
---
lol i dont think even you belive that..
---
-- I just obliterated every single point you made.
---
Yes  only in you imagination...
---
You still trying to defend the fail of those stupid changes that everyone knows will result with the same bots and less players and is showing the result alot earlyer than i imagine.
---
Randomly roaming can be very sad (especially in a slow bs). Sometimes you do end up in middle of nowhere in null, and it's been an hour of warping and you're tired. Also you could end up against a null fleet of 70people that will instablap you, because you don't have a scout yourself
---
L5s are not an alternative to ratting. If even a fraction of nullbears moved to lowsec, the LP market would crash overnight. Wormholes have a similar issue with sustainability.
---
There is a lot of nostalgia tinted views on it for sure, but in classic WoW the leveling process and many other things actually required you to go out in the world and visit most of the different zones unless you wanted to straight up grind. That means random encounters and events (PvP especially), which makes the world feel that much more alive. In all the recent expansions, you would hit top level having done only half of the content, and since many activities are instances through a queue you can join with a button, there was little incentive for most people to go out in the world.

I WISH THERE WAS A EVE WIDE DISCORD SERVER TO FIND BOTS AND KILL THEM (INC THOSE BLUE)
---
Well, you can sometimes combine a bunch of contracts at the same time or fill your extra space with one. It’s not ideal, but it’s also not THAT dangerous if the cargo is small.
---
Good fuck citadels.

"JOKES ON THEM GUYS, I WAS ONLY PRETENDING TO BE RETARDED"

Since when do locators give you their online status?

You better bring a bigger fleet than me :)
---
&gt; and develop an in house anticheat or adapt an off the shelf anti cheat, 
---
Botting is harder to fight against than cheating unfortunately. Most bots don't really cheat, that's the problem. Most don't interfere with the program. You can't cheat in eve really. You can't get more information with cheats than what the client show you, you can't aim better because you don't have to aim (if you code a bot to aim for the perfect bomb, well.. congrats lol, but that's it). You can however bot because the game is quite a grind sometimes.
---
+1 for x13 and dhsj being degenerates
---
Bumping people off a pos was an exploit that would get you banned. Bumping someone off tether is not. 
---
The whole citadels repairing ships for free might be worth looking at, maybe tie to a service module, but then you’d have to add an extra module slot to everything to prevent even more structure spam.
---

I meant what i said
---
you could already scale up mindless isk generation before injectors. If you were smart, you'd have many accounts skilling up at the same time. And if you are, you're still doing that because injectors cost more than just waiting
---
Yep, farm holes are easily countered and destroyed, killing billions of investment.
---
Who made the "don't do both" rule? Ship designers for the last 15+ years.
---
Each form of tank mean making sacrifices.
---
* Armor Tank consumes a lot of Powergrid, and slows your ship down. Armor Repairers use a lot of Capacitor to run. Additionally, using Low slots for armor means you can't use those slots for Damage increasing modules.
---
* Shield Tank consumes more CPU, and makes your ship a larger target (sig radius). Additionally, using Mid slots to Shield tank means you can't use those slots for modules that disable opponents, improve your capacitor and regen, or improve your weapons' range and accuracy.
---
* While you can make a passive regen Shield tank, doing so also requires the use of Low slots, which means you can't also have armor modules in those slots. Likewise, Armor Repairers using a lot of Capacitor means you need to spend Mid slots on either Batteries or Boosters, meaning you can't also have Shield modules in those slots.
---
* Slots are finite, so you must choose carefully what to spend them on
---
* Ships themselves have base HP values for Shields and Armor, and one is usually much higher than the other. It's often best to use that as an indicator of how you "should" tank them. Furthermore, ships have innate bonuses to certain attributes or modules, and it's almost always best to use modules that can exploit one or all of those bonuses.
---
* Specialization is everything. It's very easy to try to make a ship that can try to do multiple things but then fails at doing anything well (except die). It's somewhat more difficult to make a ship that does exactly one thing, but does that one thing very well. However that second design philosophy is much more important.

The ONLY exceptions to the rule of "one tank and one tank only" are 1, certain extremely rare cases of fights involving multiple (i.e. *hundreds* of) **Titans**, because in those Titan fights, raw hitpoints become important; and 2, certain extremely rare cases of ships built purely as bait (once again for the raw hitpoints). Unless you are in one of those two cases, and you have explicitly planned it out with your fleet, **never** double tank. It gives you a ship which, while it might have a lot of HP on paper, is extremely ineffective at doing anything else and is liable to be quickly destroyed with no value gained by the extra HP.
---
I honestly wanted to do it, but some stuff need to be lived at least once to truly understand.
---
Not so long ago I forgot to bm in a shattered, there were 57 signatures. Corpmates where too busy laughing tu come and give me the exit. Now I triple check.

&gt;Before you reeee, hear me out on this...
---
no
---
**REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE**
---
Maybe that's the reason for others, too. Eve's player base is ageing after all.
---
...and it could have potentially fought back depending on how the bomber was fit.
---
But idk why you jumped to "a frigate will probably die" to "welp, everything except capitals!"
---
like....what?
---
As long as there is a  text based UI that gives Intel then bots will find a way..
---
Why we dont have like a nice graphical HUD radar STILL is mind boggling. I'm not talking about the tactical map.  Even though this could probably be expanded and the dscan and overview text based stuff could be removed altogether.
---
You have to consider that while salvaging you won't be running your MWD your cargo scanner or either of your data/relic analyzers at the same time.
---
?? We don’t own supers. Only rifters and cormorants
---
I've had a great time recently running around solo looking for fights in low sec with a few other players. We sit in a fleet usually flying around a constellation or area. If we find something to solo then we will solo it. But often times I've run into pilots running around in duo/trios so I just bring it up in the fleet chat and someone nearby comes over to my system so we can go 2v2 etc.
---
We'd know if there was a wormholer in antartica. wormholer btw
---
ur not my mom
---
What made me do this is a little experience a week ago, in data site with a high sec connection that was out of d-scan range.
---
While hacking I saw t1 probes getting closer. I just put my combat character in an inty at 0 of the landing point and 1 minutes latter I got the low effort kill. Didn’t bothered to do a cloaky trap or anything. This death could have been avoided.
---
Another like that is the three newbies that came in our home system with ventures while we were 9 docked in station. May Bob have mercy.
---
This flowchart is here to help the one that do effort searching information to understand where there are. They still need lot more knowledges, like to recognize the different ships, a prospect in space does not show the same kind of threat as a flycatcher... But they have a first method they can work on now :)
---
Smells like SLTK :P
---
&gt; Yours fucking stupid 
---
amazing
---
MS is legend
---
How exactly? You request the tele before you leave. Give list of assets so a player can itemize what they want to tele if they want. Also give them the ability to check one box to say "transport all my assets in this structure via asset safety." Click confirm. Show how much isk it will cost. Click confirm again. Log out. 30 seconds max.
---
This will cover the overwhelming majority of cases. In those edge cases not covered contacting a GM would be better in the first place, let alone the fact that this is stifling the game.
---
Thank you

classic eve player
---
Oh look, a random gif that op can find a semi eve rated title for in an attempt to gain those sweet, sweet internet points. How original.
---
&gt; how long should the maximum production time?
---
This depends on what you're making and the market conditions.
---
&gt; how to react to sudden market changes like guys which drop the price by 20% without reason?
---
If the person has low volume, I don't follow it unless the whole market follows. Just let the person make less money.
---
&gt; where should I buy the resources?
---
The nearest place that has them cheap enough. Maybe make a deal with local slave unions (mining corps) to save them transportation costs and buy local.
---
&gt; tools, sheets, etc?
---
Isk per hour is okay.
---
Most of the time custom stuff will be better.
---
&gt; what additional tips do you have?
---
If you can't make money selling at jita prices, you're often better off just importing from jita to your local hub and not manufacturing near your local selling point.
---
Slasher with neutra and SAAR ? you'll dry your cap. better going on shield for the neut version.
---
Autos 200mm shines with alpha rigs not rate of fire rigs.
---
It only depletes while using it.
---
And everything else all at once.
---
And it will likely still last longer than the salvage takes.
---
Don't worry about getting a new computer that can do all 7.
---
Just leave the miners on your current box and then get a computer good enough to handle your main activities.
---
Maybe also get a Logitech mouse keyboard that can Bluetooth to multiple computers at once, so your multiple computers behave like extended displays.
---
&gt; they only need more alfa accounts
---
Many of the bots have moved to FW or hisec. Looks like more alfa accounts weren't enough for them.
---
&gt; now they lose less
---
Citation needed. It takes way less effort to catch a bot now.
---
&gt; Again how do you know?
---
Look at dotlan.
---
&gt; lol i dont think even you belive that..
---
I believe that you have no reliable data to confirm your thesis of net loss. I don't have the data either. Thus I choose to trust to CCP that they like money and players instead of statistics you pull out of your a**.
---
Except no picard hacks this time
---
Is CCP looking for developpers of any sort?
---
yes.

---
what you think about all the people who cry about a lost ship in the tickets ?
---
This was announced in the https://www.eveonline.com/article/pwhd4w/gm-week-kicks-off-today news post, posted on the day itself
---
Yes. An unfueled citadel should be a citadel with no reinforcement timers.
---
Few years ago cloaked ship could decloak  between themselves. Orbiting a hole @100 km and decloaking another cov ops was always an awkward moment.
---
[I was too!](https://i.imgur.com/ezEHxIy.png)

Didn't think to do it on my other characters until the second day. My lowest skilled character was also the one with the least points.

Oh? Well those must be *my* supers then. Glad you found them, please contract them back :)

Soon. Very Soon. Feel free to subscribe in case it doesn't make it to good old Reddit. (Though it probably will.)
---
"Perpetually spin at CRAZY SPEED" had potential to be a lot more EVE related, I agree.
---
I read podding newbro tips haha
---
Skill special? Similar to the free 1 mill sp?
---
never treat materials you source yourself as free. So many industrial players manufacture things at a loss because they treat the minerals they mine themselves as free, when they could have sold the ores or minerals for more than the finished product.
---
Be aware of the actually fairly low ISK/hour of industry, caused by the aforementioned freetimers.

---
This seems to be a good one from what I can tell.
---
I wouldn't stress too much when it comes to burdening people with basic questions. Eve is confusing in the beginning and I think most players understand that and will happily take the time to help you. Just be friendly and make sure the corp you eventually join speaks the same language as you
---
This community does not deserve you. Thanks for the effort, reporting those cunts!
---
From my perspective it's not for no reason. I will angrily drop the profit margin right out of the market because i'm tired of being 0.01 isked.
---
I'm fine with the solution to this being deleting citadels.
---
Indeed. They did good all-round changes, but now it is time to go for the most problematic one - sov, infinite resources in each region and shitadels that killed nullsec warfares.
---
Cheapest option would be a used
---
Fx6300
---
rx570
---
8 or 16 gigs of ram
---
Source: Back when input broadcasting was allowed i could mine with 10 accs on 8 gigs of ram and 14-16 on 16 gigs. 
---
Just get eve o preview and all graphic settings on low. 
---
I had eye candy graphics only on the booster to enjoy those beautiful lasershows.
---
Repossessed
---
Because the advice was to run since its out of scram range
---
And my god it doesnt take a military scientist, genius, and philosopher locked in a room to open zkill and see how bombers beat fucking everything but capitals when hunting.
---
Let's remove citadels from nullsec then. That would be so chaos lel
---
Maintain eye contact
---
I too want to see more PvP (gang and big sleet battleships), but the meta these days made them a PvE ship with some niche uses. There is a ton of shipclasses that are simply superior compared to battleships. :(
---
Based on the flair, I think u/kristallnachte is probably knowledgeable on that in addition to providing useful tips here.
---

---
WOW! What an amazing screenshot!!!!! Possibly one of the coolest I've ever seen. Props!
---
LMFAO
---
I mean, if it's a Loki, just warp off. If you're in a frigate, your align time will likely be fast enough to bail if you warp immediately.
---
I5 + rx580 ^(my old card died and had to buy new one) + 24GB ram + SSD here.          
---
PC have like 4-5years and i have no reason to get something better as i run 5-6 accounts on this easily.
---
Remove asset safety is very bad idea as it will push people into big blocks even more and make those blocks burn space of all small groups to get the loot.              
---
Currently all industrial and reaction structures **get all stuff in production into loot tables** when they die.               
---
You got dying raitarus dropping like 100bil + in stuff.              
---
Yet you don't see people constantly running an killing those structures.                   
---
If this is not happening now the only change will be bigger player having new incentive to kill smaller groups.
---
I hope no.          
---
Those NPC were amazing on removing the higsec botters.
---
Except they don't.
---
Unless those they are hunting are totally incompetent.
---
A lot of bomber kills are based on being selective with targets.
---
So you just lose yourself money just be .01isked at the lower price too?
---
your making me all damp man now buy my kereses!!!!!!
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/1813040573/
---
Maybe
---
I was (am?) in a similar situation. My character was born in '05, but I've logged more hours this month than the previous 15 years; I never played seriously before now.
---
I started out relearning the ropes in high sec doing exploration, which was brand new to me since I'd last tried Eve.
---
From there I dabbled a bit, mostly in HS/LS and a few WH day trips. 
---
That was fun and all  but would not have kept me entertained long term. So, I joined a small wormhole corp and have learned a ton and am enjoying myself immensely. Great group of people. I'd find yourself a small group, ones friendly to newbros, and continue learning the game, joining them on outings.
---
But the autz lads have access to the dark art if tz tanking
---
In your fitting window. Upper right. Click simulate fitting. There are two modes, active modules and skills (upper left of ship window). Under active modules mode you can click the modules to simulate them on, off, overheated, etc. You can then accurately determine how long you can run **just** your salvager for. By default the fitting window has all active modules turned on.
---
as long as i'm selling for a price above the buy price + the tax i paid to post it i could not give a single shit. And if you still 0.01 isk me i'll drop it to that point too i'm mad and petty.
---
Yeah but how he gonna rep the cva gang
---
Then why are you even trading if the act of trading makes you so angry?
---
pyfa shows the Pith X-Type X-Large Shield Booster  at 132m isk, but it's actually sold for 422m minimum. Zkillboard is also wrong and value it at 300m. Is there any fix?
---
&gt;then got blown up by MCAV,
---
o7
---
Not really. Some of the stuff hasn't been updated. However, we're trying to keep it up-to-date.
---
Generally, the least up-to-date stuff is administrative stuff regarding the E-Uni corp. After that, it's fittings. Some of these are better than others. I'd trust the incursion fits over the PVP fits because I know that one of the wiki curators is an officer for the corp's incursion community, for example.
---
The other stuff isn't perfect, but it tends to be at least fairly decent.
---
Killing a refinery citadel is still far more onerous than a POS and the defender TZ mechanic makes it far less risky. Coupled with the active mining and they're just not fought over as much as they used to be.
---
You'd be surprised how little you need to pay for public courier contracts if it going between hubs. Avoid large volume items and insure adequately.
---
No. You sell shitfit shield keres and I fly the superior armor version
---
I started writing a guide about podding newbros, but then I read the title again.
---
Great to see a few groups out there having a real hum dinger fight. Shame a few other groups in eve are not interested in the same thing. Great fight guys.
---
Huh?
---
Yesterday I tried to dabble in wormhole exploration (relics/data) for the first time. Spent 5 hours scanning for C1-C3 wormholes but every site I found had sleepers in them. Eventually stumbled on a High-sec system which had 5 relic sites in them and went home with 4mil in loot. I hope I have more luck today.
---
&gt;  alt
---
Did every one, every day on 18 chars - don't ask, and no not a farmer lol.
---
Spread of awarded sp was 310k - 410k.
---
Ah shit I didn't read all of this. Sad.
---
The difference between high power and low power must become bigger:
---
High Power:
---
asset safety beside wh.
---
timer
---
shield/armor/hull resistances
---
tethering
---
low power
---
asset safety only in high sec 
---
no timer
---
no resis
---
no tethering
---
the damage cap should generally be removed. for this you should be able to repair the structures, and have to, like a POS tower.
---
winner is the carp king！
---
But the active player count is going up guys!!!
---
I love the guy with the Impel 😆
---
going to steal this but will replace "Potential thread here" with "Potential kill here" and "May Bob have mercy" with "RAGEPING!!!1!!11einseinself"
---
wormholer btw.
---
because the buy value on magpie mtus was so terrible. i'm not letting it go for less than half of its sell price.
---
People are saving them for cyno changes
---
Shocking.
---
Or probe your location at 0.5 to scan your anomaly wormhole 100%
---
You appear to have misread the question.
---
I tired smartbomb ratting, and smartied my brand new battleship of grid because I suck at it.

Funny is that he will be remembered in eve history only this way ....

He need to ~~live~~ hide with stuff that he have.
---
I got on yesterday and noticed during my 2 hours of eve time I did not see them.
---
Last week They popped my epithal while i was afk for a minute lol. My fault though lol.
---
And since then I have adapted and always fly with a combat toon instead of all mining ships.
---
But not seen them since and wanted them to stay as the orca bots hate them lmao...CCP if you see this pls turn then back on.
---
banned for 2 weeks, funniest time in eve

That would be boss.

How come the fight ended? Downyime?

Drone lands 23/7

multiboxing eve is hard on your cpu and memory, not so much on your gpu. the i3 in your hp box is not up to the task. imo a ryzen 3600(x) + 16gb of memory should be enough for multiboxing 7 clients comfortably.
---
Add a captcha to every anom?
---
A small number of ex-NOHO, ex-HEATD, .AFK guys are getting together for levelling and pre-raid gearing. We're mostly EU based but a couple of our NA players are tagging along on the euro servers just to stick together. 
---
We have no hard and fast plans for raiding yet - none of us are in a rush to run a Classic raid guild. 
---
We were headed for Shazzrah but it looks as though we will be rolling on Firemaw instead. If any old friends want to tag along, send me a PM. Regardless if anyone wants to hang out, we'll happily make room for chill, sociable people.
---
&gt;64 or 128MB RAM
---
think you dropped a G
---
and 64gb or 128gb is way overkill, even if you are running 20+ clients.
---
it is much more reasonable to go for one of the new ryzen cpus, like a 3600 or 3600x. you can run those fine on a B450 mobo, so its not that expensive setup
---
and that's why his internet points blow your tiny ass karma completely off the water LMAO
---
while you are bitching about his shitposts he's pulling enough upvotes to buy ur mum
---
All sites with names starting by "Forgotten" or "Unsecured" have sleepers in them, you will need a combat ship before hacking.
---
Spending 5 hours in wormholes and finding nothing is quite sad :(
---
Are you probing everything to 100%? Maybe you can go faster by just checking the signatures types and probe down to 100% only the one that interest you.
---
Also, start your probing far away from trades hubs and check how lively is the wormhole, people tend to clean this kind of sites more often than any other.
---
Blue on one screen edge, orange on the other, very 2019, gg.
---
If they know there are bots, why wouldn't they just ban them?
---
Can you please publicly confirm that Choridon is not using a loot script.
---
this does not counter why i said about sig btw
---
How is that banworthy?
---
Feel free to offer a flowchart from a wormholer POV!
---
I should suggest to add "low power citadelle?" in it too, check Exotic Dancers in cargobay and combat probing to loot lost drones.
---
i shall provide as soon as i get home i'll expand it :) still have like 7 hours to work though :/
---
This :D
---
Shouldn't this technically be "AUA"?
---
Most. People and allances have years worth of isk and assets we won't see any effect unless 50 b-r happen
---
&gt; tough times
---
you mean a not completely fucked economy like we have now?
---
SOE T3C please... I'll be nice to you CCP...
---
try systems around  amamake without actually going into amamake  
---
usually there you can find people but the chance to get fragged by the amamake locals is much smaller

If you want accurate representation use evepraisal, eve-market etc.

The Dev of zkill allready stated he is kinda working on a pricing update but its a hobby of his to introduce new features to his killboard and its not like he is getting paid so he does what he wants in the time he is willing to invest.

I run multiple accounts on an 8350 but have not pushed it 7 accounts at once. Never an issue. Left over computer from work a few years ago I appropriated to Eve.

“i chose the right target because i’m so smart that’s why i’m good”
---
Same can be said about capitals.  They pick the easy small targets to doomsday, so they’re smart.
---
Good. Adapt or die.
---
upvoted because when i figures this out i was mad and want others to know how to fix it
---
There will be certainly a huge decrease in activity.
---
All due to botting of course! https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/csyatr/dear_ccp_the_bots_are_adapting_to_blackout *cough*
---
How do you select new players to contact and give beginner advice too, and generally check up on?  
---
How much 'advice' do you give to new players before you consider it 'to much'? do you maintain the tough eve curve, or are you all lovely people!
---
so a perma unlimited mass hole into delve/FRT space?
---
Yeah but that's kinda slow, I want to optimize fits and the compare thing was really good to choose the right meta modules. But with prices 300m off that's not gonna work.
---
yes, but its not a fort that is comparable. a medium or Large POS is more towards the cost of a astra than a fort,
---
from experiance a small group placing a fort wil get targetted, forts are like a big nono for instance close to snuff staging. and im sure elsewhere roamed by big groups.
---
and if your a small group you may not automaticly have another safe structure to cyno onto in times of being bumped and you will not cyno out before they get you. a POS removes all of these issues. a group i know bumped a bridge titan off an actual fort not just an astra in bump stabbers.... it for sure did not take long.
---
Hecate, hull-structure tank, double web and full damage!
---
You chew through cruisers.
---
Even if you dislike CVA, you have to admit that they have a cool logo.
---
I've considered them as a potential group to join based on the logo alone. It's probably not worthwhile as the primary thing, but...
---
I agree, if my dog was as ugly as /u/ccp_falcon, id shave it's ass and teach it to walk backwards!
---
There were even more before I cropped it!
---
Not anymore after cyno change )))
---
I wouldn't mind, but its never going to happen so :shrug:
---
...what?
---
Strawman less, please.
---
its not OVER 9000
---
&gt; removing asset safety will provide for the occasional worthwhile drop
---
that already happens, just look at the most recent losses for [refineries](https://zkillboard.com/group/1406/losses/) and [eng complexes](https://zkillboard.com/group/1404/losses/)
---
what will happen when you remove asset safety is for the first months, the bigger fishes in their respective ponds will go bashing everything in range hoping to collect the most drops before people evac, and then the amount of people using structures will decrease a lot, since anyone in their right frame of mind will just use an npc station for storing assets. you'll probably still see cloning astras/raitarus around but your suggestion is basically "join the nearest big bloc or get fucked"
---
'orca bots' wtf? Why would anyone use illegal bot software for running orcas, when you can perfectly fine (and legal) use them (semi) afk?
---
SOE FAX with 1/2 of the amount of rep/local rep of actual faxes, but can go trough Large Wormhole but still put 1b mass in the hole
---
I think goons also wouldn't mind for this to happen.       
---
Probably dedicated 2 systems to have this perma Tera hole.
---
Nou
---
Devhax, even better. XD
---
Cause 24/7. Running fleets of them. Never having to reassign your drones manually. Very low chance of being ganked. More Isk/hour than a venture. 
---
They have fairly high start up costs, but people still do it. I pointed this out to someone else who said people "don't bot orcas" when if you Google "orca mining bot" there's a forum with people discussing it on the first page.
---
I didnt think horde were leaders of panfam?
---
&gt;P.S. If you ever find a frostian around or are flying around Ouelletta ask any of the guys for a 1v1, we respect those (it's one of our only two rules).

Some of my first lossmails after joining the uni were to you guys. Thanks for helping me out with having too many Tristans and stuff.
---
oh man u cracked a giant conspiracy!
---
qq
---
Bombers don't perform well be ause of their direct combat abilities.
---
They perform well because of their ability to engage on their own terms.
---
Cloaking, instant lock, etc give them a lot of power to select targets unprepared to deal with them, and prevent them from being caught by others.
---
Controlling the terms of the fight is very powerful. It's 90% of winning in EVE.
---
Plenty of ships can easily deal with bombers, from frigates to battleships, but the bomber has a stronger ability to control the terms of a fight.
---
Also, ideally your guns should burn out the moment your ship explodes :)))   
---
The true minmatar spirit (but useful on any other factions' ships really)
---
*thinking frt can still rat*
---
They are now called "Raznaborg Damavik". However, people have reported them no longer respawning at one point during the day, and additional possibly new behavior.
---
Always a pleasure o7
---
Ehh.. Yeah, I run orcas and know other people who do - but rest assured, they are NOT *bots*, it's just normal EVE client running. If somebody wants to risk his omega account(s) along with his pvp toons as well by running a bot software for orcas (I still fail to see any real benefits for that), he's beyond the help.
---
Definitely are, considering how much PL/NC rely on them for support.
---
&gt;Ehh.. Yeah, I run orcas and know other people who do - but rest assured, they are NOT bots, it's just normal EVE client running
---
My point isn't that every orca is a bot. I own one, I sure af don't bot when I leave it mining as I finish assignments etc.
---
It's that some people still do bot them.
---
&gt;If somebody wants to risk his omega account(s) along with his pvp toons as well by running a bot software for orcas (I still fail to see any real benefits for that), he's beyond the help.
---
Yeah, logic doesn't always go hand in hand with many forms of cheating.
---
I've 5 accounts (3 of which are omega) with 11 toons (main pvp, cap alt,  jita alt, industry, mining, trading, scanning, cyno alts etc) and I've never used a skill injector or extractor on any of those characters, ever. 
---
It's a matter of principle really, skill trading in the worst thing that ever happened to eve and I refrain from using them.
---
upvoted XD
---
Fuck you i sell shitfit armor keres
---
unlikely considering the top character in tmocc rn is an alt 
---
imagine being so dead =(
---
Polly want a cracker?
---
Then we are on the same page; if you throw the logic away and accept that any playing style can be actually done by bots, then I think a much bigger problem than 'orca bots' are roaming blobby bot gangs killing, looting and salvaging unsuspecting human players in lowsec.
---
Goons would exploit the hell out of this. Unlimited mass into and out of Thera would be a godsend for their blops sigs.

I think it is more about getting back on the alliances that allowed those bots to run.

Please explain how you think you can have an ‘economic depression’ in a video game. In a RL economic slump people lose their jobs and struggle to survive. In Eve you are immortal and will never ‘lose your job’.

ahh thanks, that makes sense

I have now checked both cases, and my initial assessment was almost correct. The deciding factor for these two seemingly similar cases being handled differently was not a history of other violations, but simply that the first player you're referring to did/said much, and I mean **much** more/worse than what you seem to be aware of. The second case appears to have been a single use of a homophobic/derogatory term, which we handled as appropriate according to our EULA and ToS. Please also note that even if we did disqualify a CSM member for violating our rules, they are still responsible for their own actions...we do reserve the right to enforce our rules, I think this should be fairly obvious.
---
All that being said, I can see that you clearly have your own narrative, and there's probably nothing I can say or do here to convince you that there wasn't some great conspiracy, hatred of a group of people or preferential treatment going on here. I understand that you have a preconceived conclusion to this matter that supports your existing emotional state and opinion about this, and you're willing to ignore all other possibilities to arrive at this conclusion.The best thing to do here may be to agree to disagree I guess...?
---
Thank you for the question, and I hope that even after this conversation you can still enjoy the game. Fly safe!
---
If they stand still all turrets hit you 100% of the time
---
thanks, makes sense now - the invasion and market manipulation too, wormholes I think they dropped in importance with the advent of triglav ships, as far as I can see
---
Are the invasions even worth running? Every time I've seen an invasion system it's got more ninja salvagers (with 1 gun fitted to whore on the last rat in a site) than actual players
---
if you ever lit a cyno, the ship doesnt just BAM stop. it slowly grinds to a hault. and during this time sig tanking can occur.
---
The OP said about a monitor being cyno capable. the only issue with this would be its ability to sig tank. which is why i said what i said  '' what if lighting a cyno increases sig radius? ''
---
&gt;ps. If you wonder how i will be remembered look at my Tag.

JOKES ON THEM I'M ONLY PRETENDING TO BE RETARDED
---
While Nestors *can* be farmed in highsec by grinding SoE missions and cashing out LP, they offer a very poor cashout value (they're worth around 500 isk/lp at current buy order prices, whereas virtue implants, stratios BPCs, and sisters probes/probe launchers all offer around 1000 isk/lp). Therefore, they mainly come from people farming sites in the drone regions. Blackout's greatly reduced the rate at which people are farming those sites without reducing demand for the hulls, so the price is rising. They'll become attractive cashout options for highsec mission farmers when the buy order price reaches 1b or so.
---
Nestors also come from Lowsec DED sites.
---
You're not very bright are you?
---
TIL , thanks dude
---
I love how this game still throws new info at me after all these years :)   
---
Ty
---
You didn't get it ?          
---
Ill take the bait ... let me explain you.          
---
Eve is a game, pixel space ships, nothing serious.      
---
I don't **try hard** to be good at a game ^(like why i would) , so i don't care about how people see "StainGuy" or will/will not remember it.                  
---
Way this account is tagged on r/eve simply shows what i said above.
---
I think what he means is net money generated will be less, thereby relatively increasing the price of most things.
---
Yeah let's all be outraged that we got one dude botting with myrms and scouting with pods instead of botting supers and hundreds of VNIs/ishtars everywhere.
---
Why not simply bring 2 bombers and kill the bots if it bothers you so much?
---
Please don't stop! Keep these coming. Is there a corp or something that I could donate isk to?
---
No, they come from drone unrated complexes with sentient battleship.
---
But when they never stop and you can do it with a bunch of them...then even shitty isk is okay.
---
Look at highsec mining bots.
---
Highsec mining pays pennies, but when you never have to stop....
---
Wormholes can be size limited.
---
Nobody said they wouldn't.
---
The view was that they were still at greater risk than before.
---
which they are.
---
Real players aren't that affected.
---
The real player innefficiency was already letting people get caught and die.
---
So this still affects bots far far more.
---
ntm, black out benefits players, because it's more fun!
---
So you're a coward who just talks shit on reddit but won't back it up.  Understood.  Let me know if you lose your F1 button.
---
Sorry... What does FAX stand for?
---
You can get them by running unrated drone combat sites (signatures you have to scan).
---
In general drone combat sites have a very high rate of spawning a commander spawn (Sentient Drone Spawn). The rate is about 98%. So it's rare there is none. 
---
Each sentient spawn, no matter where (highsec, lowsec or nullsec), has a chance to drop a Nexus Chip. There are three different variations, Rogue Drone 42-X Nexus Chip, Rogue Drone 43-X Nexus Chip and Rogue Drone 46-X Nexus Chip.
---
The 42 is for astero, 43 for stratios, 46 for nestor.
---
A sentient spawn can drop a comparable nexus ship of it's own class or below. So if your sentient spawn is a frigate, it can max drop an astero chip. If you fight a cruiser sentient spawn, it can drop a stratios or below (astero). And battleship class can drop all three.
---
Those chips can be brought to an SoE Station where you can exchange it without any extra costs for a Astero, Stratios or Nestor Blueprint Copy with one run. Then you can build it. :)
---
For getting the astero, all drone sites in highsec can basically drop them (even the anomalies, in case you're lucky and get a sentient spawn there and are even more lucky and it drops one). For Stratios there is only one unrated complex where you can potentially get it in highsec, else in lowsec ofc. And Nestors are basically a nullsec drop, since sentient battleships are almost excusively appearing in nullsec combat sites.
---
EVE UI Mastery ■□□□□
---
Aren't drone unrated complexes DEDs?
---
I forget how those things work.
---
I know the Drone sites can drop the chips you take to SOE.
---
But pretty sure unrated complexes are still ded sites. Unrated deds.
---
To this day it's still not stable. 
---
Using Amazon services to host it and a protocol that's proven reliable.
---
What a weird reason to quit.
---
You were on the right idea of warping to a belt then the gate. But mostly warp to a place you can scan the gate before warping to it to avoid a warp disruption "bubble" as they are called.
---
Shoulld have saved the bounty or given it to someone else. They have zero meaning/use in game other than to annoy new players by placing one on them.
---
&gt; I used the remaining ISK I had (150M) to place a bounty on the pirate that killed me and quit.
---
You will regret that when the itch comes to return.
---
They were at 1b a couple of years ago. Prices fluctuate widely depending on what the current meta is and the supply/demand
---
Lot's of good reasons mentioned here, I would like to add another: They make a good addition to Leshak doctrines, which seem to be popular these days.
---
Even better: Macross.
---
Robotech in the US is actually 3 different unrelated anime in Japan. To make this work the story is also a bit different.
---
But the "robotech" people tend to talk about is actually Macross
---
Now that's edgy
---
You got it backwards the 42 is the nestor and the 46 is the astero.
---
What the hell !!
---
Don’t quit. Not with that approach. Come back. I’ll spot you the 150mill !!
---
that erebus that warps off at 13:05 though. niiiice
---
hat erebus that warps off at 13:05 xD niiiiice
---
Duo Nebulas also do dual damage types. 1000 EM and 1000 Thermal making passive shield tanking them in a venture a pita.
---
So if I happen to kill some ship full of plex as a third party, would CCP think I am doing the RMT ?
---
Make Bots negatively affect the players and friends around them? HELL YAH! great idea, fingers crossed
---
&gt; how long should the maximum production time? 
---
Longer cycles mean less micromanagement, but are quite inflexible. I think they are worth it when it comes to relatively stable markets.
---
Shorter cycles require more attention, but allow you to react to market movements easier. Better for volatile markets, such as reactions, I find.
---
Stuff sometimes spikes quite a lot, and it is way better to run, say, 100 one-day cycles, haul to market and capitalize on the higher goods value rather than run 7 or 30 day cycles and miss out on the opportunity, because by the time your goods are produced the price will have already settled back.
---
Also, [https://eve-industry.org/calc/](https://eve-industry.org/calc/) is your friend
---
Of course.  All of the bots belong to CCP.  This has to be the most retarded conspiracy theory ever.  Pod yourself in game.
---
That was a the anniversary bgift, but it will work the same! You log in for 3 days and get SP for it I think the total was 250k
---
So, CCP.
---
Pretty quickly!
---
Hi CJ4343. Sorry about the late reply. I see your ticket and it is active. It´s been processed and moved into the appropriate queue. Unfortunately due to the nature of the case, it is a slow moving queue and it´s hard to say when we´ll have it resolved and are able to give you a reply. I did bump a couple of people about it and that may expedite processing a bit.
---
sock shoe sock shoe or sock sock shoe shoe
---
I was skipping gas sites, but scanning everything else. Tried a couple different wormhole chains from 3 different null-sec regions. I guess it was just very bad luck, so am curious to see how it will go today. Thanks for the tip about Forgotten &amp; Unsecured btw!
---
We have criteria that we use to pick users most likely to need help. We try to filter out alt accounts for example. We generally try to answer any and all questions a new player may have. We love that EVE is deep and challenging but we'd prefer if as many people as possible got over the steep learning curve so we don't intentionally keep EVE inaccessible to new people. We are absolutely lovely! :)
---
It was mostly people afking, not bots, which would warp out even after mining 2hours
---
We're a unified hivemind. "AMA" is appropriate :)
---
A ship loss in EVE is, in my opinion, one of the most emotional experiences you can have in gaming. I love that our EVE inspires such emotion.
---
I remembered a few more funny/bizarre ones:
---
1. There was a reimbursement ticket written entirely as a poem. As you may expect, support tickets generally don't make for very stimulating reading, so this was a nice breath of fresh air!
---
Tickets like this can really make our day and the GM handling the case ended up having some fun with the ticket and replying with his own poems.
---
I found the ticket in our system &amp; worked some mspaint magic to share it here: 
---
[https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/aws/community/GM\_ticket\_poem.png](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/aws/community/GM_ticket_poem.png)
---
2. When the ghost training exploit happened, we got a few ticket reports from people informing us their corpmates had been bragging about abusing it. They weren't just simple low-effort "yeah I did that" brags, but in-depth brags along the lines of "I used X accounts, got Y SP, made Z ISK, this is how I spent the ISK, etc..."
---
Once we investigated, it turned out that almost every one of these claims was a load of bull. I thought it was bizarre that people would go to such lengths to convince people they'd cheated when they had in fact not. There was also at least one guy here on reddit making similar claims that turned out to be completely unfounded.
---
3. Not a ticket but an evemail I got on my GM character from a player. He attempted to bribe me with in-game ISK to overturn a warning I'd sent for some offense that I can't remember. Thought this was really bizarre on every level.
---
All available jobs are listed here  [https://www.ccpgames.com/careers/portal](https://www.ccpgames.com/careers/portal)
---
This is so cool. Good micro gang.
---
so its totally ok for you gm´s to  write a ticket about ?
---
i never did it even when i think it was a bug or something else because i think you guys have much more important stuff to do 
---
thanks for your effort and time =)
---
u can rat regular npc in anomalys lol, same thing
---
Seen some interesting scorpion fits for solo pvp.
---
Just a few bits that might help:
---
Heavy Neuts! Just one of these can help you get away from tackle.
---
Targeting for me is roughly along the lines of:
---
T1 Destroyer &gt; Tier 3 Battlecruiser (Talos...) &gt; High DPS Crusiers (Thorax/vexor etc).
---
Where can I nab myself a Crate Of Exclusive Simo Reshar Fitness Holoreels?
---
Infestation sprout, asteroid infestation and outgrowth hive are DED, others are not (Yards, ruins, radiance etc.)  
---
But DED drone plexes don't have a sentient spawn, and I never got anything out of them, so I don't even try.
---
ty - very comprehensive - i'm going drone hunting :)
---
WAFFLES. can back up this botting claim and the subsequent behavior. I've personally killed a couple of their pods, but we also caught a couple of their VNI bots and killed a few fighters from supers we harassed. So far the best way around it is kill the pods as much as possible then try and find the ratters in the system. Either way though, it is silly.  Iron Crown is certainly the worst offender, but don't forget about Ranger Regiment! Their Dominix botter is ridiculous. They do have a lot of real players too, but they are the second-worst offender.
---
I captured it on video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B1OLyldGgs
---
I see a ‘zorya leshak’ is that an officer spawn??? Or does it always spawn but rarely drop the mod
---
I´m sorry to hear that you had a negative experience with our support :(
---
I assure you that our GMs are very knowledgeable about our product and most of us actively play daily. I don´t know of many support organizations that have a higher average tenure than we do. If you have a ticket ID then I´d be happy to take a look at your tickets and see if there are any issues I can resolve or if mistakes were made that I can prevent from happening again.
---
That is definitely a lot of carebears fighting for a juicy kill mail.
---
We all been thru it. Losing is part of the game, and is what makes it exciting. If you return one day, have a look at /r/evejobs. Find a Corp that does what you like to do, like exploring. You will learn a lot faster if you don't have to make all mistakes by yourself.
---
The last 10 years has been the narrow care bear capital perspective. Now its our turn boiii
---
None. We´re not PR savvy like that.
---
Its kinda funny you clearly can only see how this change helps the specific play style you enjoy but cant see how it will affect the rest of the game.
---
Thx fixed it :)
---
Support hasn't run any such surveys that I remember but other departments within CCP do run satisfaction surveys and the results are important to us and considered one of our KPIs.
---
...............................  fire.
---
My question for the week.
---
How do margin traders make any money passively?! I have looked into playing with the markets but it is a 5 minute 0.1 isk price change war zone!  Its more intense than checking dscan constantly!
---
Sorry that you were mistakenly banned but I'm happy that we managed to get it resolved!
---
Bots are weird.
---
But real players can be weird too.
---
One time, during a huntin Providence, a procurer warped the belt my Widow was cloaked in.
---
And another time less than 10 minutes after a drop, with my fleet in system, an orca warped to a belt.
---
So we got to do blops drops without actually lighting cynos.
---
I know change is hard. It can always be changed back. Its probably 1 line of code. 
---
Stop being such a pussy. Lets see how it pans out.
---
Speed has no effect on bomb damage, they only take sig into account due to them having no explosion velocity
---
I only saw Nyxes, Hels, and Avatars down in southern Insmother along with Rorqs. They be ratting and mining alright.
---
I have to say i liked that post. It brought me back to time when i started playing. Then at the end i was a bit disappointed. But i have to say that after all i respect that you resigned and still ware able to rate that game well... When are you coming back?
---
A lot of bots are just doing missions in high sec now. Bots don't quit the game.
---
Thats working as intended.
---
Boo.... 
---
Title should have been "I got to ride in Mittens car"
---
Are you planning a rebellion?
---
Split your cycles even on your huffers and consider remote rep builds if you run more than one.
---
Well, I hop games a lot. Play something a few days or even a month and then quit it for half a year.
---
I personally think all the WH PvP corps should come together to combat the bottery! :)
---
Oh you can scan gates? 
---
Why are bounties useless?
---

What do you mean?
---

---
Thanks, but it will probably take a while before I come back. I'm gonna watch Eve content and see if I can rekindle my motivation though.
---
Alright, I'll keep it in mind. I'll stay on this subreddit and maybe I'll spot something that makes me come back and then I'll do what you said. Thanks!
---
literally a single t2 hardener would've been enough, him ejecting killed him
---
Can you tell him that I don't like him? 
---
Thanks :p
---
Glad you did! I'll probably come back when I see something about Eve that just makes me want to play it again.
---
The more basic ones are generally handed out for free. Take a trip over to Chinese Google if you don't believe me. It's been the same in every game I've quit because of Chinese hackers.
---
Job losses are a by product of a recession not the cause or contributing factor.....
---
It's just a damned shame a Pile of Logs isn't a pile of logs... who the hell reads logs anyway? But I could sure use some logs in my spaceship for my space fireplace
---
You really are an arse hole aren't you.
---
Also, delete High Sec, over view, and space ships while you are at it.
---
Heyyyy man. I tackled you in your hurricane this morning :) i was the breacher pilot ! I like your style and offer you a spot in our corpo too if your interested. We do mostly small gang stuff, usually between 3-7 dudes. We're in the same spot atm so at least join our roam tonight ! You could have an idea of whats the culture like and might even learn 1-2 things. I can also hands you ships when its a fleet roam. Hit me up in private if your interested and keep up the good work. Also you can join "Mackies pub" to be able to join us for some action. You can also ask for fair fight there and ppl gonna respect it :) Good luck and have fun my bruh o7
---
Dock in Jita and simulate ingame, its accurate there.
---
You jump Titans in on a DT shotgun not dreads XD Dreads are for after DT.
---
This, so much this.
---
Yes because Feythabolis and Omist are totally bot free. And don't get me started on the goon land. Or GotG space...
---
have you considered titans might not be in range?
---
Bounties only pay out a small percentage of the ship value to whoever kills them. Not the total amount at once. Nobody kills anyone in game for the bounty value, ever. It's useless.
---
That's my Hyper over there. Yay!
---
Oh okay. Well, that sucks.
---
It doesn't concern you at all that CCP has looked into the prospect of of temporary single use cosmetics? Not even a little? Because most paying customers with half a brain would be concerned with that potential for monetisation.
---
Yea i was wondering when they release it
---
I really don't understand why some people so vehemently defend the exploration into the monetary potential of single use cosmetics. It baffles me that consumers make excuses for anti consumerism. Uncle Ruckus in the flesh.
---
They never will. People are under the assumption that anything can be done against bots. I dont think any game has ever managed to completely wipe them out. As long as there is real world money value, there will be bots.
---
What kind of supercap hunters are you!
---
look... CCP again fucking off Nullsec/WH Player that are not able to see CCP in local... Bad Move.
---
Props to the orca
---
Yeaah. The possibility of being killed and lose everything u had with u is the most exciting part of a game. It's depends on how vigilant and experience you are.  Anyway it's awesome that u could had a lot of fun and rate this game so high. I hope u'll return and  would be able to participate in the tons of more exciting events that happens everyday in Eve
---
And the price fixing of alcohol is objectively defendable because I don't drink alcohol. Oh wait... it's still illegal. Your lack of financial contribution does not at all influence the circumstances. It is still a shit thing to do.
---
Thanks for sharing the video. Been awhile since I played EVE I miss it a so damn much but I just don't have that kind of time anymore
---
Found exactly same behaviour in Ranger-Regiment-Space as well as in FRT space. Pod or Noobship on 10k perch over ingate to ratting system or even worse, they just place perch citadels and the pod scout bot is tethered. I probed and killed some of them which seems to lead to them respawning on a clone bay raitaru/astra in system, boarding corvette and going to same spot.
---
They did take off shortly after I reconnected, though not sure if they were watching overview or Reddit
---
Would make your hole dangerous as fuck though
---
deflation doesn't mean recession

How else would I annoy the most annoying players in the game? The fact that you dragged this on makes me laugh. My killboard is spread over 4 accounts and if you took two minutes you could put 2 and 2 together you'd figure it out. But I know even if you did, you'd find the one kill to spin and use it to talk trash. 
---
So yes, I'm waiting to see how smart you are. I'm definitely not a coward. At least my corp doesn't have the reputation of noob baiting and suicide ganking with a dozen alts.

PM me when you get a set of balls.

PM me when you think you figured out who I am.

Otherwise stop festering over how I was right and you were wrong. Get over it. Salty much cry baby? 👶

Recession is a period of economic contraction, where the economy shrinks rather than growing.
---
Ikr? You always have back up titans and tackle rorqs in every low sec region r2g. Maybe Ranger Regiment got them spooked alittle :p
---
lol
---
It's absolutely no different than windows, click and play
---
an isk faucet turning into an isk deficit just means shrinking of the monetary base, that may or may not lead to recession
---
Im already wearing my tinfoil hat   it does not suprise me if they for some magical reason lost the data or something
---
&gt; You know what's really annoying?
---
giving clickbait post titles
---
Inquiring minds want to know:   is the blackout saving EVE?
---
Dunno. Most of them to my knowledge were in China, the government even used them as prison labour programs in the 2000s. Not sure they still do that since it's so much less profitable today.
---
This is good advice.  In my experience large plexes are a really good way to set up fights and split groups on grid since they can't warp to one another within the plex.  This works with battlecruisers also as long as you fit an MJD.  What I would do is warp to the plex at 100 and align out, you want to pull a little range so they can't warp tackle to you but not so much that they don't see you as engageable.  Ideally you will want to try to kill the tackle first, once all of the fast shit is gone you will have an easier time controlling the grid and moving around an of course moonwalking out with MJD once there is too much DPS on top of you.  
---
What makes a "good" solo BS is high slot utility and mid slots for dual prop.  This means that ships like the Maelstrom are pretty trash for solo.  I would even argue that Hyperion isn't the best choice either.  1 utility neut is ok, two is better.  Hyperion is also known as the "tanky one," so expect people to approach you a little differently.  
---
Tempest is maybe the best, two heavy neuts means blingy active tanked cruisers melt, selectable damage type, good slot layout.  
---
Domi is also great for all of the same reasons and versatility.  You can hull tank, armor tank, neuts in the highs or a mixture of neuts and medium guns for tracking frigs.  
---
Geddon is also good, less flexibility with the mid slots but two neuts and rapid heavies gives you versatile damage, utility, and fairly solid application.
---
Target priority for me tends to be a bit like this.
---
Split tackle from the main group and kill this first.
---
Once tackle is gone start working on lightly tanked DPS.  Go for traditionally active tanked ships that tend to be blingy.  A few that come to mind are vagas, deimos, etc.  
---
Always carry drop, and if you are armor rep fit exile.
---
If you are scrammed and the blob is closing in look for the squishiest blingiest ship and try to kill it.  Is a garmur ramming you?  Good, switch to tracking ammo, take drop, apply neuts grapple and drones and try to blap it before you die.  
---
As the person above mentioned you need to avoid neuts as much as possible.  I would also avoid, if possible, fighting a gang that has a battleship or two of it's own if you are not able to put a great distance between you and them.  If you are solo another BS will have little to no trouble tanking you long enough for his gang to DPS through your tank, and if they have a scram you will have a lot of trouble breaking that unless the pilot is garbage.  
---
Don't fight a gang with logi.  If a gang brings logi to fight a solo pilot they are trash cowards and dont deserve your content.  END OF.  You can apply neut pressure to one logi and shoot another and probably even break through the reps and frag one or two logi crusiers.  If the pilots are paying attention and pull range you are fucked, and even if they don't you are probably fucked anyway because in the time that it takes to clear the logi you will probably lose your BS.
---
Sure, except you can't take caps to Thera
---
okay, bye
---
This isn't the Wall Street Journal... it would just mean a lot of people stopped doing a lot of activity... which in a online video game is probably not a good thing...

Um don't  need the Mer for that question. The answer is clearly, No.
---
bye :(
---
Not only is local blacked out, so is the economy.
---
approved
---
Not a single 50k on 9 characters :(
---
Too logical
---
Probably because they don't want to fuel the whole "eve is dying because of blackout" trend that goes about. The dudes said as much as they're after the long term benefit so releasing a negative looking MER will just rile up the plebs.   
---
IF they would release it, it's probably delayed because whatever metrics it shows will have to be interpreted and explained as well. (for the same reasons)   
---
If i were ccp though, I would not release it this month and will most likely keep at least 2 months more to show how it stabilizes. Releasing a "crisis era" MER will mean absolutely nothing on its own.
---
Not really... negating the lock time would be the benefit. Negating the fact they'd have to be on you, would be another benefit. Also, you know you can switch from regular missiles to FoF, right? Thus, my idea would be far more beneficial. 
---
So, bro.
---
I mean.. are you really that attached to the overview how it is?
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

We know it's going to be bad. Not releasing it fuels speculation that it's even worse than expected, even with the free SP event getting people to log in.

Ouch

thank you reddit lord

Yeet. was it one of those asset safetied ones that got dropped in a random station?

I am wondering if this is not about :                   
---
&gt;while overall mining and ratting went down, delve is up by 30% when compared to others.
---
Join up with Bombers Bar.
---
As others have highlighted, the reason for structures over station is down to the material bonuses of structures. As is, industry in structures is already risky; everything (in terms of materials) that's in a production line when the structure pops gets dropped. If the armour timer goes, you can't cancel jobs anymore. Even if you cancel a job, all the materials that have gone in just disappear.
---
As is, there's about two days an active player using a raitaru has to see wardec and finish ongoing jobs. If you happen to not be around to deliver jobs, or jobs were set up taking longer than that, if the structure is attacked you are guaranteed to lose those billions of input materials no matter what.
---
For meaningful changes for a problem in null, IMO it hinges on just decoupling the structure mechanics as an "all space" thing and making them be relative to the space they're in. Wormholes already do this; there's no reason IMO structures should behave exactly the same across high, low and null. Especially since there's a problem in null (structure spam) that is by its very intended design in highsec where it isn't really a problem to anyone.
---
Welcome to eve. I hope that you have fun in high-sec.
---
CCP making the "seasonal adjustments" that any decent economic report should have.
---
Cartel said not to release it.  
---
  
---
Afterall, wouldn't want all those exports to highsec to prove they're all shitstick liars out to line their pockets (more).
---
Never did a T5 Abyssal... 4 Bil Gila is a scary thought by itself...
---
I get the idea. But I dont think inflation in Eve is caused by more isk. Its easy to think in that way but prices in Eve are dictated mainly by supply and demand. Unless the demand is spiking (tons more players) the prices will be fairly stabile, i.e., no inflation. 
---
There will perhaps be some effects (long term) but I doubt that they will be anywhere near big enough to actually plan for. 
---
But I would agree that to be on the safe side ratting bots should go first. However Im dont see the faucet issue in the same way that others might do. Its based on irl economic theory but its disregarding that irl there is a financial sector that is crucial to the way inflation works and also the fact that irl economic theory is faltering atm.
---
Modulation Error Ratio?
---
I think asset safety could be embedded with the current insurance mechanic. If your ships are insured when the station dies, you get them safetied up at an NPC station and the insurance is voided. If they're not insured, they drop.  
---
Ofc you can't save the items but that's on you to resolve (by either leaving them inside the ships or contracting them for hauling).   
---
So if something happens in RL, you just need to come in every 3 months to renew insurance and you're golden.
---
You quitted for one of the most common things to happen in this game no matter what you do: your ship exploding. And you did so after barely scratching the surfact of what the game has to offer.
---
Next time if you decide to give it another go, consider your ships as dead as soon as you hit "undock" and never fly what you can't afford to replace.
---
And by the way, bounties mean nothing, at most you made that guy laugh a little while wasting isk you could have used to reship.
---
Maybe aryth got a hold on the mer data.
---
The Rorqual gold rush is all but over... do you want to buy mine?

I guess speculation is still better than certitude, in this case.

oof, senior, senior, senior... Is there any newbro friendly corp out there? I don't have enough isk for injectors.

I've never successfully pulled anyone over in my Police Comet... though it was not from a lack of trying...

What exactly does a bad mer look like

Have you seen the levels of tears being utilized by people wanting their 99.99% safety in null sec back?

Not giving those people anything to squeak about is wise.

Damn. Was hoping for a JF filled with PLEX or something, but nope, looks like a regular bunch of garbage, maybe to stock a null market.

Whatever the case, I'm sure RMT is involved somehow

Installers tend to run with administrator privileges always, even if the game/client itself uses only user rights.

Big isk drop i think

Mining and ratting clif

Fuck off, just cause you can’t have one doesn’t mean you should take away mine
---
No free intel.

At least nothing of value was lost when wreck got removed on downtime.
---
Again, if you believe wormholes are the only legitimate way to 'earn isk,' what is the point of sov space at all; or are you just being like your typical r/eve poster and simply suggesting your playstyle is the best, and only legitimate one? 
---
But to seriously answer your question, I have zero desire to ever use a wormhole for anything other than traveling. If I wanted to live in a wormhole I would have done so at any time over the last 6 years or so years... I didn't want to then, and I do not want to now. 
---
You enjoy wormholes? Good for you! That's why they exist; however, null sec exists for a reason too, and that reason isn't "to have space where you can day trip into wormholes for isk" from.
---
&gt;would get half of the jobs in progress (ie nothing)
---
That is true in your case, but at the same time that relies on having at most 48 hour builds and logging in at least every day to complete jobs (or like in your case, not using the structure most of the time). Cancelling jobs deletes all materials, and once the armour timer goes it's impossible to deliver completed things (they get undone) or cancel jobs... So anyone not logging in in the 48 hour window is going to be SOL and is guaranteed to lose all materials, it's not like there's no risk involved there. 
---
The bigger issue is that there *are* many structures like yours that are mostly not used, rather than active, because if all the existing raitaru's were active it would be very worth playing the lottery and bashing them until you get a few that had long jobs or players unable to deliver everything.
---
As for the quarter trillion assets; that's always safe (in highsec) if you are active. You can always dock and move things out if they're not tied up in active industry and thanks to courier contracts you don't even need to do that yourself. Asset safety, at least in highsec, isn't really involved in the risk/reward equation for active players since an active player should have pretty much nothing end up in asset safety, it's just a slower and more expensive option of having things moved.
---
snuff has tackle/battle rorqs within jumprange of every lowsec system. Every single one.
---
"what can go wrong?"
---
it's what I'm actually doing, but the "compare" thing in pyfa save invaluable time when the market prices are right
---
I don't believe locators say anything about being online or not, just what ship in what system IIRC. There's no way to tell if a player is active or not short of laying your eyes on them directly (in space, in chat, etc) or having mutual contacts with the buddy option.
---
If everyone is doing half the  mining or ratting and one entity is doing 30 % more than the rest, that entity is still only doing 65 % of the mining and ratting it was before.
---
Because then you don't have 150mil to use to fund whatever activities you might be interested in.
---
You mean, they won't release it until they figure out how to spin it.
---
Under 1500 karma? Ha, you're barely worth typing this reply, plebian
---
It used to be like that in the past. Nowadays you can install pretty much everything without ever being prompted to elevate.
---
Supers will jump, and just speaking for those of us who live in Delve, in the very unlikely event that an overwhelming number don't jump the moment the words 'cyno up' come over comms, we still won't be that worried. 
---
It's Delve. There will be time enough to get a new cyno up. So as much as I hate to spoil people's dreams of not getting escalated by overwhelming force, including supers and titans, in Delve... let me be the bearer of bad news... it is still going to happen. Routinely.
---
The word is that the cyno died so faxes were jumping to a second cyno that was still lit.
---
Builds longer than 48h are a little risky yeah. But the risk is truly tiny.
---
Even if things wind up in safety it's just a nuisance assuming you are in a station system.
---
Basically, you are saying that null sec sov space should be worthless, except for super production. That's pretty stupid. 
---
And not just because sov null sec always has, and should continue to be, more profitable than high sec, low-sec, and non sov null, but if null sec sov was 'only good for super production' alliance emergent content would go away, as there would literally be almost no point in doing the work to take and hold space in null sec.
---
Probably because Delve Esoteria and where ever panfam are piling in are out krabbing the rest of null even harder than they were before like everyone said would happen.
---
I wish I could have been there for this but I have a 8-4 job and live in the US. So for me it happens at like noon-1PM, so I can not take part. I whish they would do the events a few times throughout the day so that other regions can take part in it not just EU.  In the 9 years I have been playing EVE I have taken part of 1 live event and that involved me call in to work sick.
---
In theory sure. But this is based on them being at peak already and them sitting in NS in large numbers. And also that botters only bot 1 game at a time.
---
In reality I doubt they are at peak because bots get found out and deleted by CCP all the time (with the isk) which means that more isk than you can sell isnt really needed. I.e., you dont optimize for most isk but rather for what you need based on your business with the ability to grow some if you need it (there is always room to change without it actually hurting their income).
---
They dont need to sit in NS, lots of bots have been in HS for a long time and Im fairly certain we have more there now than ever before.
---
A botter probably bots several games at once. Otherwise they are very reliant on just one game and thats really not how a business (succesful atleast) works.
---
All in all, to some extent sure botters will get affected. But I doubt it will have a profound effect on their business. Im fairly certain they have ultrahigh margins and that the price differs alot from the PLEX price which means that it wont really hurt as much. 
---
Besides, since PLEX is falling that actually means they will probably make even more money than before (more costumers and higher margins). Their margins just got bumped by a lot since they are now competing with 20 USD for 1,5b isk in comparison to pre-blackout when it was 20 USD for 2b isk. They can easily raise their price now which will offset any potential downside for them, all in all making more money than before.
---
The blackout gave botters more strength, not less.
---
For me the worst part are the timers. 
---
If it is in space you should be able to shoot it BASTA!!!
---
Or does my VNI get a reinforcement timer when the hunters pwe pwe me. No i just lost the ship
---
YEs part of this game is playing with others, and the numbers matter.
---
And if you play solo you have to go Guerrilla style, or Rebels vs empire. Strike and run.
---
So when you anchor it in space you know the deal.
---
Yes  ... and ?          
---
Like it is always about how much is this compared to others.
---
yea, in a way.   
---
but i mean less like "this is bad, but here's why it's good" and more like "we know this looks bad right now, but here is how it will improve and these are the KPI to follow".   
---
Wishful thinking, I know.
---
I first started to look for faction forts.
---
Falcon is a no nonsense tell it like it is guy right?  I'm sure he'll answer the call....

Bots are an excellent scapegoat for any and all changes to eve

So Benji made me log in for the first time in months... He left me in the middle of an APEX Legends game I was streaming shouting something about a 90bil freighter.

Managed to scramble to update EVE and get screen capture running as game capture didn't want to work, but still managed to get 75% of it on stream.
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/mrtontovr/clip/WonderfulPiercingMallardDendiFace](https://www.twitch.tv/mrtontovr/clip/WonderfulPiercingMallardDendiFace)
---
Then back to Apex we went! 
---
I guess its time to wait another few months before logging in.
---
I keep hearing this but why exactly was it fucked? I mean in reality, how did it affect people?
---
I mean.. if the overall isk and ore generated is down 50 %, that is an absolute corollary to that much less activity by those doing pve activity that could he caught/killed. It's cut and dry. It's not just about the generation of those resources.
---
It isn't salt, its legit what the 'hunters' sound like. Seriously, think about it for 5 seconds. 
---
1. Blackout happened, hunters still complain;
---
2. Cyno nerf incoming, hunters still complain; 
---
Like legit, except for literally removing people's ability to see gate activations and docking/flying to POSes, how exactly is CCP suppose to 'fix' bots/people adapting to putting alts on gates? 
---
I think its pretty obvious to most rational people that both the salt, and the demand that CCP make their playstyle easier, safer, and more profitable, isn't coming from the people in sov holding alliances.
---
Looks good I'll have to try it!
---
like i said though, in HS safety isn't really any concern.
---
It's going to be hard to increase risk for industry without just screwing over the industry side and making everyone go back to stations. Eg removing a timer as suggested by OP, it'd leave only a 24 hour window for delivering anything ongoing. Anything not delivered in that single day (at most, accounting for IRL your warning may be as small as a few hours or you log in after the fact and have no warning)) is a guaranteed loss. That's not a fair situation to the industrial side, especially given that there's zero risk for big entities throwing down peanuts for a wardec and then bashing the structure with just 3-4 alts.
---
Actually fixing the overall risk/reward/reason to bash structures in HS would probably require the reworking of a lot of systems, really. The main complaints right now come from structures in null though, and that's what this reddit post seems to be aimed at as well.
---
Was just a statement. Not leading anywhere with it. Saying one guy has two meals while others have one a day when everyone was used to 3 meals before still means there is a big reduction.
---
19 compact damage controls, 78m. Damn.
---
Yep.
---
Given how long of a jump range they have, that's not really surprising tbh.
---
Not really. You're talking about Jackdaws which already have a great lock time. In solo pvp, an increase of a couple of seconds matters but in fleet play, it's nothing. You wouldn't be individually locking drones after every kill, you'd probably lock 7-8 drones at once and lock more as they're dieing, which means you're only really losing a couple of seconds at the start of the fight. You'd lock them as they're traveling to your fleet anyways, so you might not even lose time locking them before they get into your range.
---
You'd also probably still kill the drones faster even including lock time because of the dps increase and because FOF does not focus fire, which means FOF damage is spread across all drones (since they move so quickly and often, their range changes very often too). It gives ample time for your enemy to react and recall their drone, get them repaired or move them out of range of your missiles. If you're focus firing, they won't have the time and you can blow it up much quicker.
---
For most fleet fights, smartbombs are more than enough and if you ever need a dedicated wing to kill drones, you'd use regular missiles and never FOF. Your FOF missiles would simply have no impact on the fight because drones move so quickly, so damage is spread across all drones instead of being focused fired. By killing drones, your goal is to remove DPS off the field so you want to focus each drone down as fast as possible.
---
Their only use is for AFK PvE, where your enemies don't move much so the range doesn't change often and when they don't have logi on field so the damage you do when the FOF change targets is not repaired. You can use them in other areas, but it's always going to be a poor choice compared to regular missiles. FOF missiles have been in Eve Online for years, if there was a place in the PvP meta, it would have been found already. People tried to use them and failed.
---
I installed this but couldnt figure out how to run it. No instructions come with it.
---
Yea, I think it will show a sharp decline in extraction, industry and ratting, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, if their aim is to tone down on those things and make the isk meaningful again.   
---
A good MER would see activity being meaningful again in more types of spaces (with not so much imbalance in null), less pve activity (results), etc. Coupled with other data - ships lost etc, it might paint a pictures of some indicators people could follow.   
---
right now it will probably show a stagnation as the average null salaryman has toned down ratting and is holding his breath waiting for blackout/invasion to pass - but in a few months' time activity would probably resume, just in a different way. I guess we'll live and see.
---
2 x mining drone I that's really sad 🥺

Askt should be tbh

It's really not that uncommon for people to make recipes that originated from games/movies. So why not make a event out of it? I have seen a decent amount come from GW2.

If you lose a ship in a situation that you feel was not normal gameplay, then by all means file a ticket and we´ll look into your issue and if we manage to verify that the loss was abnormal, we replace your ship.

It is a nice vid.
---
Ever thought of mobile internet?
---
The stark problem is how many null salarymen as you put it, are migrating to running abyssals and incursions in high sec where they are no longer providing content for hunters? (Aside from the obvious category of players just not doing either right now)
---
Is there an anti-botting discord so hunters can coordinate and join each other in different regions?

Why tf did he eject?

Man, going nomad is fun. If ya have an alt in an orca or a porp it's even better. Tougher to take fights due to reshiping/logistics, but it is wicked fun

How you seen the level of tears of the people who *really* want 'hunting' in null sec to be 99.999% safe? From the looks of this post, I think you might be one of them.

Congrats on getting one whenever that was.

just farm winter co. and you should be busy for a while
---
I run dual Orcas but i don't afk them. I only on occasion need to reassign a drone and i can do other shit on my main account on my other monitor.
---
The Triglavian recons have resulted in the need to be fast on the response if they show up though.
---
One thing I would recommend is changing your fittings a bit.  I see you've flown canes and BS before.  For BCs I would highly advise that you DPS tank.  Dual rep BC isn't terrible but there are two massive disadvantages.  Cap booster means no MJD.  MJD means you miss out on one of the strongest modules in the game.  I can't stress how important MJD is for solo.  I would literally put an MJD on every ship if I could.  Secondly, you really want to DPS tank.  I mean you REALLY WANT TO DPS TANK.  BCs are cheap.  Expect them to almost always die.  With three damage mods you have enough dps to crack most active cruiser tanks.  You will of course also kill fast tackle MUCH FASTER, this coupled with the MJD means you can quickly kill a few ships, reposition and repeat.  Also getting pointed by a ceptor or garmur and literally not being able to do anything fucking sucks.  Also I've seen that you've used the Maelstrom a bit, if you haven't noticed by now, its fucking garbage for solo.  No utility neut is pure shit.  Because you can't shut off frig props you need at a minimum a web and grapple which means either having just an MJD or just a MWD, both options are shit.  If you are in a gang and you have other dudes to do a lot of the tackle work it's not a bad option at all.
---
You don't get it. Eve eve needs industry guys. Without pve, you can not have pvp.
---
Just like these minerals I mined here are free.

but two pods simultaniously warping back to the belt would be a bit much for players... not saying impossible, just unlikely.

Well yes and no :D

---
While your first priority should be to learn your roaming area by checking it out in smaller ships so that you can get a feel for which systems are hotspots, which groups operate in the area, and what ships/numbers you might be facing in various places or from various groups (I only know Cal/Gal: depending on the time of day, Vlillirier or Nennamaila might be hotter, Kinakka is occupied by a corp of the same name and I'd rather fight them than Villore Accords, for example), you should also know how to conduct your ship in the fight. It's a good idea to understand what targets you need to neut. They're not always the ones shooting at you. The biggest threats are the people who keep you from leaving so that their friends can

Check out this video (Russian with English subtitles, if you understand Russian, also his streams). Dude knows his stuff. He lost the fight eventually, but held out for a while.

Summary of the video: Shows up at E-Uni Wormhole Campus's home system in a Tempest. Bunch of people undocked in afterburner frigates. Took out the first fast tackle Firetail to arrive (flew straight in, rather than spiralling, which would have pretty much guaranteed survival) but when the Enyos and Retributions arrived, he couldn't get away. Even after he lost the supply truck Gnosis carrying cap booster charges, he still kept his repairs going well enough that the QRF couldn't break his tank until some people broke off and up-shipped into stuff with bigger guns (with a few staying around to keep him there).
---
Lessons to be learned:
---
1. Afterburner frigates are a hard counter to this sort of thing. MWD's are useful, but between the high angular velocity and small signature radius, a battleship isn't likely to hit an AB frigate.
---
2.
---
Well tbh that's not bad - at least you don't see them around hiding under rocks. It's not like you could catch them anyways, unless blue intel or smth.   
---
I think this will go a long way into showing some obvious, large, underlying design issues that the game currently has, which have been semi-successfully obfuscated by the possibility to safely live in null. In a way I'm thankful to large blocs for working inadvertently towards uncovering these issues.   
---
I think that there's ways to steer eve towards being a better game at the moment, even if that means shedding some players (while gaining others). I see a lot of eager new beans inquiring around and they don't seem to be driven by the whole "i rat to plex" and "titans are endgame" things that plague the current semi-new playerbase. I still have hope.
---
Except claws when we needed them in catch :(
---
Meh, just change all the 0's to 1's.  What could possibly go wrong?
---
When I started in Null it was standard to maintain a high sec Alt for ISK generation as Null was so poor at supporting you. Following improvements to Null PVE it became natural for those alts to migrate there. If those "salarymen" decide that Null is not worth the risk and with changes to local/Cyno's either introduced or on way they might decide to stay running incursions/abyssals and only be in null for fleets thus reducing the number of targets for hunters even more.
---
They do ban bots but only after months of "investigation"

Took 4 months to get 50 bot asteros banned. And daily spamming/abusing the report bot button.

Not a week later 50 brand new bot asteros were sighted.

It's a battle players cannot win. Bring back rats in relic/data sites!

Let’s make our own MER. Everyone link your mining ledger

Thats probably the most fun ive had to date
---
how much is that in todays market ? 2-3 plex ?
---
Why would it necessarily mean prices increase? If there is less money then in theory prices go down not up due to there not being as much money in circulation. However there is so much isk already hoarded in game that any reduction in new isk entering Eve will have no discernible impact on prices IMO.
---
Will the change made to reduce rampant inflation in fact reduce rampant inflation, and will people then complain that it shows how the change is a failure and the sky is falling? (Yes and yes.)

1. Remove asset safety, watch your subscription numbers fall, and permanently discourage both the use of citadels in space and the return of any player taking a long term break when they discover everything they own has been lost because a citadel was destroyed/moved.

That's all I see.

So.... Has anyone given thought to creating a 'Bot Hunting' Null-Sec corp? Approach the major alliances, ask for permissions to pass through their territory to get to the bot systems... There'd probably have to be some rules.... No ratting in the alliance systems without prior permission, no passing intel to other alliances.  Open up a "Null-Bot Info" channel for alliances to drop bot info into. Then go hunting bots....

they prosecute like 3 from 2500 active bots, purely for showcasing that  they fight bots.

Many, many people who end up living in null sec bring *all* of their assets to null sec. My characters alone have over a trillion isk in assets in null sec structures. 
---
About a year ago I came back from a multiple year break--and here is your problem--I never would have resubed any of my accounts if it turned out that, in the time I was gone, asset safety was removed and, because the citadel(s) all of the stuff I have collected in eve since 2006 was gone forever. 
---
At the end of the day, the population of null sec + the amount of assets in null sec structures, means that any removal of asset safety *will absolutely harm* CCPs ability to get vets returning to eve to start playing the game again, and will *negatively impact* total subscription numbers generally. 
---
From a real world economic perspective, the asset safety ship sailed long ago when asset safety was instituted. It was only ever viable to 'remove it' by never instituting it at all.

Unrated sites have % chance to have commander ship. This ship drops the usual shiny faction drops (faction modules, implants, etc.). Unrated sites can also escalate.
---
This looks like a lifetime of accumulated assets give or take some random off stacks of items that could have been for large sales.
---
Nope, been having good times with corp mates before and after.
---
As for ‘99.99% safe hunting’, if you think the only way to defend your pve ships is a super umbrella as it currently works .... you have been drinking Mittens cool aid way to long.
---
Some of the best fights are subcap brawls where a hunting fleet tackles a target and a subcap response fleet responds.
---
Damn, i missed it again. Like every year ...
---
&gt;m, but replace the damage cap with something that scales logarithmically (diminishing returns, but no cap) and remove one of the timers
---
Not if CCP wants to continue functioning as a game, and I assume he has people whispering this in his ear... 
---
aka "if we remove asset safety we will be reducing the amount of people who come back to this game after taking a break by 50%, and thus reducing the money we would have generated from those players forever."
---
Not gonna lie, I do enjoy how this is used as an argument against anything that can be perceived as a pve nerf as much as I enjoy a root canal.
---
Let the revolution continue!
---
&gt;eone who walks away from the game for a few months or years and comes back to find everything they ever owned was d
---
Its like you do not understand how MMOs actually work in real life. Any long term player invested in an MMO takes breaks. This is just how the industry works. 
---
So your 5% is actually more like 60% of the long term player base.
---
well, FRT were actually the PvP-Wormhole-etc guys on Serenity, sure noraus is known to be exposed for botting and RMT, but the large scale RMT that destroyed Serenity Eco was coming from Serinity "Imperium" so to say, PIBC. And these players are NOT in FRT but in PLA (Goons) or Mango (Legacy). Fact.
---
totally agree that new players are the lifeblood of the game so its a pity that CCP has failed to do any work on the new player journey its still a "have a ship fuck you" introduction that results in so many new players leaving.  I believe 89% of newly created characters do not make it past day 14 (presentation from CCP EvE North 2019). Perhaps CCP would have been better served retaining some of these new players before clearing out some of the older ones.
---
&lt;3          
---
Can confirm one of the best hunter discords.
---
Surely if you want to kill the bots simply log off your cov ops cloaked pvp ship one day in the system and then next day log in, cloak and go kill their botting pve ships. If they're watching gates but you're already in system you should be able to get one or two of them at a time, no?
---
Hahah, as if CCP has any idea how interpret or explain metrics.
---
Multiply that by 10 and you will have the answer
---
Bombers beat everything when in large numbers or dropped on unsuspecting ratters. A frigate should be able to kill a solo bomber, they usually can’t tank much.
---
Not valid
---
I have 4 accounts, created in 2013/2014, and never got one single greeting from a GM, even though I was hoping to.  
---
How do ya'll find new players to greet?  Do you just find them in local somewhere, or?
---
If you took more time to read it, you would see that i'm not in total agreement of the proposal CCP provided and instead listed this as an alternative. It offers better counters and counter-play and doesn't effect fleet or logistics.
---
Stuff mixed when they moved to TQ.           
---
Unless you want to say that so many people ^(size of FRT) on Serenity lived in the WH space.                     
---
Btw.      
---
Did you know that 'old guard' of FRT ^(before FRT was formed) lived in Stain in the 42-UOW system.
---
&gt;asset safety seems to work.
---
The difference being, ofc, that asset safety never worked in w-space and people were told that upfront. Ergo, nobody ever moved everything they owned into w-space upwell structures. 
---
Any change to asset safety now completely fucks people who started a break before asset safety is removed; AND means that, in any case, there will be an exodus of stuff out of null stations, so they won't magically turn into the loot pinadas you think they will--except for stuff left by people who had no idea asset safety is removed. 
---
And finally, this is completely leaving aside that in known space, you've concocted yet another change designed to make null sec 'less safe,' which really only seriously impacts:
---
1. Maybe players who are currently winning eve for awhile; AND 
---
2. Smaller groups with upwell structures who are going to get face stomped by the big guys for their loot.
---
And if you're using a cargo scanner, then you're doing it wrong.
---
This is just data, they could just explain that this is the trend  they expected and make some projections on the long term evolution based on their plan and the impact they have foreseen on the game. 
---
But that would be if they knew what they were doing and that the data in the MER was not contradicting all their hopes and they were not in PANIC mode trying to hide the evidences as much as possible to save their ass for a bit longer.
---
&gt; No asset safety seems to work.fine in WHs and they all seem to love it.  
---
Asset safety doesnt work at all in wormholes so thats not true.  They all love it because they specifically chose to move there so that's just confirmation bias.  If everyone was FORCED to live there there'd be alot more people that'd hate it.  
---
&gt; Dont even have to fully get rid of it. Make it like 30% on larger structures and then not at all on ratarus and astras. Or even just no asset safety or 50% chance drop 50% asset safety on low powered.  
---
As keeps getting pointed out, any amount percentage of drop at all will just force people to store things in NPC structures instead and negate the point entirely.  
---
&gt; Something to make it more rewarding/costly for structure spam and not fueling 
---
I agree but the answer is not asset safety changes, the answer is making citadels easier to kill and to drop more wreck loot that is not tied to individual player stored items in the citadel.
---
Probably me since those Triglavian recons blasted you almost instantly.
---
We are a whiny, needy bunch of players.  How the hell do they put up with us heh.
---
&gt;he answer is that it's not just a dead brick in space and has power for base functionality regardless. Tethering and docking is base functionality, in this case. Wanting that changed is your opinion but trying to blame it on "it shouldn't have power" is a bit silly.
---
You lost me by mentioning Mar5meca, input broadcaster extraordinaire.
---
Congratulations. Now you know how the rest of the world feels 90% of the time.

---
This was NC guy not goon
---
thank you  for your Service =)
---
If the issue at hand is not being able to tank the incoming damage in a Venture, then maybe you need a beefier ship.
---
Proposal: *Gnosis*. It's still fairly cheap, it has a huge cargo bay (full cargo extender lows and rigs it can easily pass 5000, making it bigger than a Venture), 5 Turret slots for gas harvesters, and a full rack of mid slots for a shield tank. And for memes, it can run a Mining Foreman Command Burst to make its harvesters cycle faster.
---
Well, i mean they said that they would be including botting/RMT in new MERs so thats going to be interesting to say the least.
---
Let the artists involved in this know that the color green is a thing that exists. They forgot when they first designed the corp logo system.
---
Unpopular opinion:  I remember looking at the MER from 6 months ago and seeing the rampant isk faucets, the mass botting income from Rats, Super prices tanking, Plex prices through the roof.
---
With newbros training immediately for caps. Supers being dropped on every small gang. To seeing null blocs completely abondoning their home regions against an overwhelming blob.
---
I thought to myself; there is no way this is sustainable.
---
&gt;ONTOP OF THIS, I can just blow up my own citadel, and teleport anything to lowsec for 400m.
---
If you have any experience trading--I do, it's how I make my isk--you would know how incredibly easy it is to manipulate prices. 
---
For example, you set up a sell order selling 1k damage control 1s for 5 million a piece, then buy it from yourself. Ta-da, you have just magically increased the average cost of the item.
---
I.S.K frt botting alt alliance lmao
---
Very much. They just subtracted without taking the time to actually adjust other things first to act as a safety net.
---
I'm definitely in goons, at least I keep being told by others that i must be a spy for them

---
I turned off every account except my trader. My goal with her is to unload my inventory over the next three months, convert my liquid assets to plex, and disappear for another few years in the hopes that:
---
1. There is a game to come back to (seems doubtful at this point); and
---
2. Hilmar losses his job, CCP magically hires real developers with their own ideas, not the ideas borrowed from the worst parts of r/eve
---
erm...im so new to this game that i practically squeak. whats going on here?
---
We have the snuff hypergod module which allows all our supercaps to have infinite jump range... l2p noob
---
I would say that there is no such thing as "dislike" in this. I mean... some expensive items are refunded with cautious, but regardless of our personal stance on it, we still use policies and internal guidelines  to help with the certain decision. 
---
In restoration processes definitely most of the stuff is up to reimbursement, it's just the combination of certain factors that can either affect granting this request or denying. Now that I think about it, BPOs would be challenging to return simply because of the certain... functions and specifics of our system.
---
It is bad. Less players doesnt mean a healthier game. Less players in NS for whatever reason means less content which will mean less hunters. Eve is a very interlinked game.
---
Those issues had already been brought up by NS people for a long time and viable solutions presented. And still, this is much larger than just adding risk. People dont work that way, things need to be rational. If something becomes irrational which the blackout is people will stop doing it. The cyno change which is rational (but stupid) will have a minor effect whilst the blackout will have a larger one simply because nothing else got changed. Everything was balanced towards local and just removing that wont work. Like ever.
---
The assumption is that you will actually gain others. How are these going to be retained for one? NS kept those numbers up, now the very same entities that kept new blood in the game have lost their ability to do so. Whos gonna pick up the slack?
---
Smoke and mirrors.
---
The bots continue to water down the economy. That's why.
---
This was a standard problem in Eve for years and years. If this is in fact a problem, then the solution to this problem, as Rise indicated, is to increase the rewards for null sec, not lower the risk.
---
Never go full retard, and you did anyway.
---
Ive had plenty, and I still think they are bad for the game in its current form 😉
---
https://github.com/Bertral/EANM/blob/master/README.md
---
no, no, its definitely a conspiracy to skew data.
---
Very important : if you don't need to look at every screen at once, minimizing them will improve your performance. Use some multibox manager, I don't remember the name.
---
Yeah, but that 15% isk sink is a big deal for sinking isk *out* of the economy.
---
you'll come back. we all do
---
Every day at 6am EST the server restarts. OP killed one of the largest, most expensive ships in the game literally right as the cluster (server) was going down.
---
These kind of deaths always stink of RMT to me. 
---
Like somebody's account got hacked, all their shit put into a freighter, and then driven right into a gank to *legitimately* transfer half the value in a way that will be hard to proof is actually RMT.
---
CODE. Got the loot. It will probably go to the Minerbumping SRP fund.
---
Yeah, our in-game identities are not secret within the department. Many GMs play EVE together on player characters all the time actually.
---
It has happened that GMs were on opposite sides of big wars on their player characters. That kind of rivalry stays entirely in-game though :)
---
What inflation dude? Prices were fairly stable and even going down, not up.
---
If the players, who had to be retarded to die at all, are running to highsec because they are too risk averse to bother being in null, then what's the loss? It means that the people who are there are more willing to accept risk and are probably more likely to actually put up a fight, and the run-away inflation of bounty prizes and supercap factory output might finally come to a halt.
---
I have no opinion on them as individuals in the game. I simply noted credit for the idea for fairness I guess.
---
I have heard a lot of comments about AS from CCP, and a number of figures in the community. What I've written here is sort of an aggregate of a number of opinions on the subject.
---
Maybe we should ban you along with him for condoning cheating? Ever think about that one?
---
&gt;But the dream that somehow we're going to have a functional game if keepstars are dropping titans is laughable and gets an automatic downvote from me every time.
---
This strikes me as less of a, bots are bad post, and more of a... "but people can still get intel so catching people is still not easy and is still too risky for me" post.
---
Agreed. Less players in NS means less content for me which means I don't bother logging in or resubbing toons. It's all a trickle down effect. The PVE'ers try to wait out the storm as do some of the hunters.
---
I would if I could afford a battleship. Tell me how it goes though
---
64gb to 128gb RAM is typical of that age of server, but yes the whole thing is overkill.
---
This isn't hard lol put your thinking cap on.
---
Small % chance for every item to drop. If Item doesn't drop == 30% tax on value goes to killer of structure, item is sent home via current AS mechanic. Ez pz
---
But what will those poor explorers in Signal Cartel do for ISK? Bob knows they're not allowed to fit a single offensive module.
---
What were your findings?
---
I also did that but not FW, more dirt cheap venture fits to kill random stuff in nullsec
---
More likely the fact that about three quarters of the dorm population is streaming porn at any given moment.
---
Like, here's an idea. It doesn't get the full 5k cargohold (4611; needs the CPU for the shields), and while it's not passive tanked it gets better HP recovery than a passive tanked one would, and it is cap stable with the booster (but not the micro) on. 5k shield HP, 15kEHP vs EM/Thermal, 20+106 EHP/s shield regen+boost. Should be able to eat up anything those gas clouds can throw at you... I hope...

the ishtars dropped, damn son
---
I've reimbursed a supercarrier. I think it was a Hel but I can't remember for sure.
---
I've also taken away a supercarrier that was reimbursed by mistake! That was not a fun thing to do. I guess that evens it out?

It's kind of hilarious for the pirate tbh. You probably made that guy's day :)

There is also a program called Lost UI which let you copy settings etc. More info can be found from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b4l9ak/lost_ui/
---
There were a good few complaints about this exact thing when the agency window first popped up. It was just designed to be an annoyance, intentionally or not.
---
It doesn't even drop any loot, there's really no reason other than annoying someone else
---
Cool vid.. and spie?? 😁😁
---
To my knowledge, this is pretty rare. Compared to now, tickets about this were a little more common back when Starbases were an integral part of claiming Sovereignty, but even then we're talking about maybe 2-3 tickets a month? Just a guess, but I think that's in the right ballpark.
---
But yeah, it does happen. Starbases are pretty rough from a GM perspective. A GM once wrote an internal guide on Starbases &amp; Starbase issues that was more than 150 pages long. There were a bunch of pictures, but it was still a massive document!
---
Its only a big deal if big structures die. Staging citadels, small Corp or alliance citadels are next to worthless for that.
---
Get rid of dotlan or delay the data a few hours server side with the cache being 3 hours instead of 1 hour. Problem solved. Delay killmails by 3 hours server side from the api. Problem solved.
---
no reps ....
---
Lol. Good luck with your belief.
---
There's a dude with 5 million subscribers whose YouTube channel does exactly that.
---
It's Niarja too... That is so dumb. Well known Code stomping ground
---
Not releasing the MER has a worde affect than releasing a negative one. Might as well get it over with. Doesnt take a genius to figure out people are not playing as much.
---
PVP money making is nice but it involve way too often to shoot stuff that doesn't shoot back. And putting more isk on the field than the other. It's hard to get a profit and semi-fair fights with 50% drop rate
---
That already happens with a lot of trade items though. Some people prefer the safety of selling in Jita 4-4, while others are willing to incur a bit of risk and sell at lower prices out of citadels in Perimeter. If you want to store expensive goods in NPC stations in high sec, more power to you, but be prepared to pay higher taxes when doing business with those assets. If you want open slots and better rates, you’re gonna have to move stuff around. 
---
NPC stations are limited in nullsec and basically non-existent in wormhole space (Thera being the obvious exception). NPC nullsec also tends to be more dangerous (it’s the only unsafe place in Delve, for example) and it’s possible to station camp, making interacting with your assets potentially more difficult if you try to stockpile them there. If you want nullsec to be truly risky again, I think making citadels easier and more rewarding to destroy would be a huge positive for the game. The grind and “already replaced” nature of citadels isn’t fun at all. 
---
Someone mentioned keeping asset safety, but transferring the funds to the attacker. If CCP could pull it off, that seems like a really cool idea. I’d be motivated to whack on someone’s structure for the chance at 15% of your stuff.
---
The trap had been set and the bait planted.  He wasn't happy about being the bait nor the resources going into it but such was the way the game was played.    
---
His unfitted Nyx class supercarrier had been hastily put together, only enough time to rig it for some extra armor protection and stuff its hangar full of things that might go boom.    The Admiralty praised him for his role and promised when he got back to the rendezvous point that a fresh ship and a choice assignment would be waiting for him.  But he had to be clever, cunning and quick if the plan was to succeed, for he had an ulterior motive that even the Admiralty was unaware of, for implanted within his head were prototype Triglavian implants which allowed him to share his telemetry and sensor data real time with his masters in the spacial pockets they called home.    
---
The Nyx undocked at the same time an agent within the ranks of the enemy forces alerted them to a "chance encounter" with a supercarrier without a proper escort.   They scrambled their quick reaction force to take it down and within minutes the Nyx he had been piloting was surrounded by dozens of ships all aggressively working to turn the mighty ship into a loosely assorted arrangement of alloys and scrap.    
---
"Eject too soon and they will see your capsule.  Eject too late and you might be caught in the explosion.. this must be perfect"   A voice inside his head whispered to him.  He hated that voice.  He cursed its power over him and secretly a portion of his mind wished for these enemies to catch his capsule and send him to a new, untainted clone, where he might finally be free to reveal how he was captured and compromised by the Triglavians and forced to commit horrendous acts of covert sabotage and espionage against his own people.  But this day would not see him get his wish and the powers that acted to subvert his conscious will were strange and powerful.
---
The armor indicator read nearly zero and the structure was beginning to show signs of battle damage.  Moments ago he had received word that the ploy had worked and while the enemy was attacking his Nyx the main force had entered the enemy's space and was successful in destroying a Titan manufacturing facility. A valuable prize that was foolishly left poorly defended when they rushed to attack the Nyx that had been setup as bait. 
---
After a brief moment of struggle, where he tried to delay the ejection of his capsule to the point when it would be too late to escape, the power that the strange implant had over his actions asserted its control fully and the capsule ejected and quickly warped away from the battlefield.     As the capsule entered warp its sensors could see the powerful explosion caused by the destruction of his ship.    His commanders would hail it as a resounding victory despite the hefty cost of such a magnificent vessel as the Nyx. But he knew that while this might be a short term victory, the Triglavian threat was far more real than his leadership realized and he knew that he would continue to send the Triglavians intel and conduct acts of sabotage until he was eventually discovered, branded a traitor, and had his position within the alliance forcefully revoked and by then even if they were to kill him and send him to a fresh clone, they would only see his story as a poor attempt to justify treason and dismiss it.    And he feared that day more than all others...

We have a cantina team that cooks lunch for us every day, so very few people bring their own lunch! My favorite lunch from the kitchen staff is their lasagne &amp; DIY burritos.
---
Running High Sec Incursions can net you 200mil ISK per hour depending on level/fleet comp etc also add in selling the Concord LP; another 200mill per hour in the realtive security of High Sec. I know there are variables spawn rates travel time buy in for the ship and fit etc but they will have to really buff Null PVE to make it more attractive than that keeping in mind no local and no Cyno for the most part. I look forward to CCP Rise reworking null PVE to temp the majority of its residents back.
---
It's quite simple tbh, we just pay them to do it.
---
Indeed one of my faves.
---
By the way kudos for putting your cock on the block!
---
Not releasing it would only be clear evidence of CCPs willingness to distort data (or atleast the access to it) which is exactly what people have been saying will happen and has happened with the login events.
---
And I mean, if the data shows that eve is dying faster than pre-blackout then thats what the data is showing. You dont just hide the truth because it doesnt suit you. In regards to the long term benefits, well its a major assumption that it will have any positive effects whatsoever.
---
Any idea how far the npc leshaks shoot up to?
---
CCP still hasn't decided to just get rid of it yet. CCP talks a big game about bots yet is unwilling to make the tough decisions like disbanding an entire alliance for botting.
---
But it means the gap just got wider and is counterproductive with their goal to screw over the big guy to help the smaller guy.
---
We have access to the wallet balance but it's not visible on the same page where we read to and respond to your ticket. It's basically information we'd have to go out of our way to look at.
---
It's really not something we think about much while working so nah. If anything it's been the other way around - I've noticed some super rich people a few times.
---
Is it binging with babish? Because if it is I am one of them haha.
---
Afraid I can't answer the station question, that's something you'll need a developer to answer :)
---
My favorite color is blue and I like electronic &amp; orchestral music.
---
At my peak I had five accounts!
---
There’s definitely a bug - I tried buying some regular low tier skills for an alt the other day and I couldn’t remotely buy any skills at all.
---
Might be that the presence of these older ones is preventing the new ones from coming in, too.   
---
Just take a look at the amount of posts about "new player getting into industry", "new player trying mining", "trying hauling", "trying trade" etc.   
---
the most prevalent answers are "you can't" - maybe if the space cleared up a bit and those behemoths can't adapt to changes and finally unsubscribe, there's gonna be more places to flourish as a new bean. Already I've seen new budding corps in more remote regions of hisec, some in low, etc. so things are moving, more or less.   
---
maybe even if these older dudes and their space are no longer the focus, those resources can be spent on fixing up other things, like the NPE, lowsec, hisec living, the pve there idk. I guess we'll have to see - tbh it was dying/stagnating as it was so whatever shakes it up is good - at least we don't have to wait for the agony :)
---
Advertising you used to have a perfect falcon pilot......... 
---
Have you no shame?
---
will /u/ccp_falcon be the hero we need?
---
Why would someone expect their Corp to pay for a ship they chose to fly? Seems crazy to me.
---
What option do you speak of?!
---
it's definitely a better grounded assumption (given that they own more data than players) than some speculation from the line members of a particular cohort in-game.
---
PvP iS WhAt EvE Is alL aBouT! 
---
Why are we losing population????
---
Tbh, haven't seen a Jamgu since ECM changes anymore. 
---
But I think they can still be a pita for Logistic-Squads or jam away tackle from precious stuff. The jammed target now still can lock, but only the ship that jams it. Thats pretty useless on Logistics or the HIC that wants to tackle your Titan. For smallscale or even 1-v-1 (like with LASB-RLML-Rook) it is pretty useless now ..

So if they don't release it today (which they wont), it will be the most delayed report ever.
---
Just train Gallente Crusier to 5 and damps, the Arazu is gonna be really popular in a month or so.
---
Exactly. If one component breaks so does the other and a balance is needed to ensure that some stuff gets killed to create incentive for hunters but not too much stuff otherwise incentive gets lost for PvEers. And the PvEers need hunters as well, I mean if ships dont die their efforts are worth less. 
---
Did we need to balance the risk? Perhaps, but this isnt balance, this is breaking the wheel.
---
They had more base EHP back then, but the trade-off was that capital modules, they can have more EHP now than before.
---
Can confirm, put an alt into horde because Grrr Panfam, ended up loving it with a boomstick jaguar (back when jaguars had boomsticks ;(  )
---
Monthly economy report
---
Ratting in a super isn't end-game content and if that's your goal in the game, I believe you can think bigger.
---
Probably cause it's August and the guys responsible are on vacation, but that's wild speculation
---
No, I get it. Large player organizations being able to utilize player institutions and coordination to build the ships and infrastructure to project power--within their own space--so that you cannot, without any risk to yourself, gank things in your wandering nano/bomber gangs must really suck. 
---
I would be attempted to tell you to adapt, or get gud, or explain to you that this is how it supposed to work, and that it supposed to be hard; however, I realize this narrative belongs to you and your ilk. 
---
You want to sit in the mud, and complain "local sucks, people know I am coming," followed by, "oh, we still don't get kills, its really basic human interaction made possible by highly organized emergent player organizations," makes it too 'hard' to get tons of free kills in sov space, but its really *the other guys* who want easier and less risky game play, not me." 
---
I will let you keep that. Just recognize that you might be fooling some people, but all your complaints really amount to: highly organized player groups, with more people than us, who work together very well and set up doctrines to defend the space this game allows them to claim, mean killing people Delve is too difficult--never mind that there are actually groups of 'hunters' who are very good at doing just this with current game mechanics.
---
Their use in wormholes was more often for Static farming PVE than PvP. There's still some comps that use them for sure, but I think running C5s with a low mass has been their "primary" use
---
I gotta say, this is a really good point. I didn’t even think about the potential for abusing the mechanic. What’s to stop two coordinating groups from bashing structures back and forth to generate ISK out of thin air? 
---
For the system to work, the reward would have to be a percentage of the physical assets contained in the citadel, not ISK .
---
According to dotlan, delve went from being 7% total ratting in Eve to 25% during the first month
---
Someone is salty over hypothetical changes. LOL...
---
Go figure, how does this happen? Doesn't make sense that making people think twice about risking their valuable assets to provide the materials required to produce everything in game would cause inflation.  
---
Who knew?
---
Jamming still has its uses in fleet pvp. You just can't depend on it as a blanket protection from everyone and everything. Until CCP gives Caldari EWAR ships another balance pass they're not great, but they can be workable. For example; jamming logistics is almost unchanged in effectiveness. It really depends on how well you feel you can use it with the additional danger involved.
---
In case you weren't aware, cynosoural fields will soon be restricted to only recons and BLOPs. If you need cynos for anything, then a recon pilot is your easiest option. 
---
Worst case, grab a griffin/kitsune or blackbird and welp a few in fleets to see how well it handles. You'll probably die a lot since its definitely no recon, but you'll get n idea of how ECM actually impacts combat, without losing a bunch of T2 cruisers.
---
I have a new PSU. I forgot to mention that I upgraded it with my GPU.
---
I'm not sure that the goal is to screw over the big guy and help the little guy. The goal could just be to reduce influx overall.
---
And incursions armor fleets.
---
Probably all armor fleets are using nestors as raw logistics.
---
True the big guys have a big head start on a lot of the game and in many cases have a choke hold on production, mining etc . I do hope the new guys keep going and stick at it and its good to see new corps starting up in all areas of space. For what its worth I for one dont subscribe to the idea Eve is dying and a shake up from time to time is good but CCP need a viable plan/roadmap to take it from here. I am concerned we have a throw it at the wall and see what sticks roadmap at the moment and it may all fall apart round them.
---
Is he wrong tho
---
Oh well
---
My hole is already a dangerous area with damaging toxic clouds. Cant really make it worse.
---
How in New Eden did you manage to lock up and kill not 1 but 2 frigates in a bs? The locking time alone would mean they fuck off well before you can lock and scram unless they are fast tackle.
---
More data doesnt mean better assumptions. More knowledge (better understanding) does. And data isnt knowledge in that sense, you can always have more information but if you cant use it right then it wont matter. And CCP has less knowledge than this particular cohort so I honestly trust our assumptions far more than trusting the assumptions of the very same people that put us in this place to begin with. Even though we told them it would happen but got neglected.
---
For real? Fuck that, I've never joined a big block for this exact reason.
---
&gt; If Item doesn't drop == 30% tax on value goes to killer of structure
---
I smell a highly-abuseable ISK faucet, if the payout is bigger than the asset-safety retrieval cost.
---
Load citadel with a trillion ISK worth of assets, destroy citadel, receive 300b payout, recover assets with 150b, and loot the "small %" of items that dropped. 
---
There are people who could do this. Just buy all of the really pricey high-grade faction Omega implants from all the sell orders at Jita, wait for the price to spike, and put all the implants in a hangar in the structure. In stacks of 1 item natch, the item count would be small enough to do that in a bearable amount of time. Bash structure, receive payout, recover items, rinse, repeat.
---
As a bonus, don't wait for the spike in implant costs to go down by itself, put those back on the market while it hasn't recovered yet and sell some of them back for 2b apiece instead of 1.
---
Keep in 
---
In mind that even if you micro jump with your ships they are likely to remain pointed as the drifters infinite “scram” goes up to 100+K whilst it moves at 
---
13k/s itself.
---
Citadel drifter farming is also far less efficient than dreadnought farming. You can make a nice buck with it but it doesn’t come close to how much dreads earn compared to subcaps.
---
The ISK comes from another players wallet, not out of thin air like with rat bounties. Giving the 15% value to the attacker isn’t an ISK faucet, it’s just a transfer.
---
You can have it the day after Hilmar gets his bonus.
---
That guy has had a pretty rough 24 hours. Lost a 8b epithal in Jita the day before. Guessing he's a noob who plexed his way into a super.
---
As someone whose thing was ECM to near exclusion of all else, I can understand the desire to SP harvest but that said, I've still undocked ECM a few times and saved other ships caught in a bind. Besides Recon is pretty useful if you plan on branching into other races
---
(ECM in a wormhole that reduces targeting range makes it really great in a fleet fight if your opponents hadn't planned on fighting there)
---
Sure, button to insta kill targeted player owned ship pls.
---
Ikr! Im still shocked that basic economics is a thing. And that people are still talking about inflation/deflation without actually knowing what it means.
---
Not at all, you just keep mentioning the same dumb idea that wouldn't work over and over again.
---
Even better! If the killed player complains, its not a bot, just rollback the kill.
---
Like I said in the last thread -- don't expect the July MER (if it ever appears) to be completely representative of the blackout's effects on the economy. The blackout went into effect July 12th, and you can be sure that folks spent the week-ish before redoubling their krab efforts in preparation for the winter of no local.
---
Why don’t they just make botting against the EULA?
---
Have you ever read a EULA?
---
That's absolutely insane. As many one-off mechanics as they had tied to them, i can believe it though! Thanks for the answer :)
---
CCP will spend 80% of DEV time to get new player experience and skip programmable fix to boting... F word to CCP for current approach to player base.
---
This game produces genuinely stunning art
---
reduce industry/farm/mining, yes maybe  
---
saving eve, no
---
we dont neeed number to understrand they go straight into the wall
---
Their specific goal for age of chaos is this. Hilmar said it plainly and openly. Nerfing NS in favor of hunters is this, hurting the umbrella is this and I promise you the next one will be aswell.
---
The issue with that is that Rise said that the removal of the blackout isnt based on influx since that could be handled in other ways but rather how much people actually like it. I.e., there were always other options if the goal was just to reduce income.
---
I already have another Recon V with Amarr/Gal Cruiser V.  I could never brag about a killmail if it had my Falcon alt on it haha.
---
I'd just be using a t3 cruiser or two. But that's not exactly cheap either.
---
Or you know just report the player... they get tracked then
---
For me that's a good mer
---
Sounds like an injector problem
---
Not really necessary, but for electrical if you wanted to beef up your em resist you can take out one of the cap batteries and put an em ward. The cap bonus in electrical will off set the loss of one of the batteries.
---
Well between now and November the only statistic they seem to care about is Daily Average Users so Hilmar can get that fat bonus check...
---
Bad idea, you still need to bookmark the hole and no the signature, else you land 10km away.
---
But you can still do it to have one less signature to probe.
---
The goal was to prevent the big guys from being "safe". Turns out, surprise, that their changes affect everyone but affect the biggest guys the least because they can more easily adapt.
---
That's why knee-jerk reactions and short-sighted changes are a terrible idea. It's going to make it much harder for people that \*aren't\* in big alliances, which means people will either move more toward the alliances or quit.
---
that’s what it looks like lmao
---
Its nullsec everyone should be as unsafe as possible
---
Not being very dumb, and if so facing consequences, is what EVE is about.
---
Oh newbros, you're so cute.
---
Not to say I agree with OP, hes a moron
---
Buy a load of frigates, head to a nullsec pipe system (right next to Orvolle is PF and it's a good place to start) and go get some losses. Talk to the people that kill you and you'll start to learn. It's how I transitioned and PF is my second home, after my corps home system. 
---
Eve Uni is a great resource to learn about anything Eve.
---
taxes literally exist
---
I think there's always going to be a chance an organization will develop some sort of "us vs them" culture with distance - even if it was just someone working remotely from the other side of the street. 
---
A lot of effort has gone into minimizing this though and I don't think we have a divide between teams today. For example we do regular interpersonal exchanges where GMs will travel to Iceland to meet the team we have in the CCP office, and the other way around as well. One Iceland-based GM for example just got back from spending a few weeks in Argentina, where a bunch of our work from home GMs are based.
---
It also certainly complicates some things, such as communication. There's a whole lot of extra considerations when you need to communicate something consistently across multiple locations and timezones that you don't need to worry about when everyone is on location. This is something we've had to learn to deal with and that was a challenge at first but we're in a pretty good spot now!
---
CCP is moving?
---
And? Your corp should be using that to fuel structure and maintain infrastructure. I don't see why they should fund expensive loss mails. Once in awhile maybe, but regularly? Fuck no.
---
BUT MUH KILLBOARD
---
Fair enough, but now you have a new cyno alt then.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Whining like a bitch constantly: there's always a bee in the flair.
---
Fun-fact - a few GMs used to regularly play Friday-lunchtime football with the current president :)
---
I guess that's one way to Quit the game...
---
yup, and we were messing with them in WC before we move to cache
---
From the GM AMA
---
This is not my area of expertise, botting is mostly handled by our friends at Team Security. 
---
From what I gather, it is in most cases enough to just get the character names. If all you really have is character names, it is best to use the in-game reporting tool to get the information to us, rather than a support ticket. Instructions on doing that can be found here:
---
[https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000249125-Reporting-suspected-bot-users](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000249125-Reporting-suspected-bot-users) 
---
That being said, we have gotten detailed reports that have been really valuable to the team. It's hard to define useful information, but it will generally be something fairly juicy - something beyond "I see these guys in System X all the time". I'm thinking something more along the lines of "It's well known that corp A is a botting corp and they have approached my alliance often about renting space" etc.
---
If you have that kind of information, we encourage you to send us a ticket. The ticket will be forwarded by a GM to Team Security for handling.
---
Alternatively (and even better than a support ticket to be honest), you can send detailed reports of that kind to [security@ccpgames.com](mailto:security@ccpgames.com) \- the security team will even sometimes give PLEX rewards for particularly valuable reports!
---
That’s a lot of tears friend.
---
You had it your way for the last three years and we dealt with it.
---
Now times are changing, time for you to deal with it.
---
I agree the rate that theyre going hopefully they change it soon. It would be nice to have more dreads in space or more fleets out trying to kill drifters instead of invulnerable structures that give risk averse/high reward gameplay even though is supposedly takes less time to kill them than dreads. 0 to 2-4bill in kills is very significant and can promote log off traps as well.
---
Right now it's 6am EDT.  In a few weeks, it will be 7am EST.  Utilizing a region specific time zone is a horrible way to describe EVE Online downtime mechanics, especially one that is victim to the antiquated usage of "daylight savings". 
---
The EVE servers operate on UTC, and the servers reboot every day at 11:00 UTC, 365 days a year.
---
UTC has been in operation for almost 60 years and the vast majority of the planet is familiar with it.  You can learn more about [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time)
---
Well said. Have an upvote.
---
Aw look, he even quoted a GM to prove the really do take it seriously!!!
---
Reread link, got me too.  I just clicked and discovered the lulz when I went to manually type in code.
---
Good guess, but nope! It was Portuguese. Japanese was one of the smaller languages but not even close to that small.
---
"What can go Charon?"
---
^i'll ^see ^myself ^out
---
Pandemic Horde is recruiting.
---
Funny-looking-text captchas have all been broken.
---
Captcha services exist on the internet that will solve them for you using very cheap Chinese and Indian labor.  Something like 100 solved for $1.
---
Yeap.
---
So, code is... Buying isk all the time they gank a dodo in niarja?
---
Then your fine, Pilgrim and Arazu will be the prime choice after the patch. Pilgrim if you need an armor "brick" (lol compared to old "hard" cynos), Arazu if you want to utilize the tackle boni or alternatively create a shield fleet cyno because of many medslots.
---
If only there was some sort of object in the game you could anchor before your logged off that would prevent warping....
---
The shields weren't up when the fuel ran out. Even an unfueled citadel provides tether which makes no sense from a gameplay or an RP point of view.
---
fleet warp tho
---
I never see solo or duo subcaps running them though, you simply align and trigger it unless your running a subcap fleet. Some people even run the sites with subcaps and finish it off with a dread. Even though it's less efficient than dreads it still beats almost all isk making activities per hour with no risk. Atleast removing this mechanic will force these people who 'own' holes to do em in dreads thus generating more content in wspace.
---
&gt;There's a reason why I never heard of Incursion bots or Abyssal bots. Yet.
---
They're only a google search away.
---
You can say *fuck* on reddit.
---
&lt;insert falcon quote about jamming first and killing last&gt; 
---
Nothing wrong with using the tools you’re given man...
---
Are you operating under the belief that these pods are cloaked?
---
Probably because beyond upsetting a whole bunch of non botting players and players with alts, it won't do a thing more than creating a precedent for ccp to randomly start disbanding alliances, that will reform anyway
---
yea thats the chief complaint, before they added the drifter you *had* to have caps on field to get the maximum isk out of the sites, now you can just run the site in mjd rattlesnakes (which are impossible to catch if they are paying attention), spawn the drifter and then kill it with your astrahus that is cheaper than a dread and obviously a lot more difficult to kill.
---
I’d keep it. Using it in a small gang would be a nice surprise and could seriously screw with logi or other support if they aren’t expecting it. Just because the one ship can shoot back doesn’t ruin ECM for taking out support.
---
thats a lot of words only to discount simple common sense that if organizations are allowed yo grow to points where they are immune to other people s efforts, then the sandbox is pretty shitty and the rules must be altered. 
---
this is part of said alteration
---
&gt; And for memes, it can run a Mining Foreman Command Burst to make its harvesters cycle faster.
---
I thought mining boosts don't affect gas harvesters?
---
&gt; &lt;insert falcon quote about jamming first and killing last&gt; 
---
[Falcon?](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Chameleon)
---
I just want to know what the medium remote hull reppers were for.
---
Maybe a combat astero could do it since covert. But I'm also thinking of ships with torpedoes so you can put the large, slow, targets out of their misery in a single salvo
---
No clue. Don't know what code gets up to. All I'm saying is that these kinds of killmails always look very suspicious to me.
---
&gt;\*Remove asset safety to incentivize destruction
---
All of the input material for all jobs running in the citadel drops.  So you, *right now*, can make a large amount of money blowing up random Raitarus in highsec.
---
Random Raitarus in highsec are not being blown up.
---
So no, you guys don't need monetary incentives, 'cause you aren't using the ones you already have.  Outposts and conquerable stations also dropped absolutely nothing, and people still shot at those.
---
That's... nice. Arguing over timezones is sort of pedantic since I'm just explaining the concept to a complete newbie, but thanks for the lecture.
---
he said it then it became lore
---
I'm glad you guys have policies in place for dealing with this stuff. I know a lot of the people I meet suffer serious damage to their gameplay, and I'm super paranoid about my own accounts since I keep seeing other people lose theirs :(
---
I hope you guys always feel free to reach out to players, especially the pro-trader variety, to help deal with hack cases. There's a decent chance 25-50% of hack sales go to a relatively small group of people, and most of us would be happy to work directly with GMs to return assets on a regular basis.
---
I don't think you can eject when targeted.
---
dude had a Dark Blood Thermal Plating in his cargo hold.  Would not even have to invest 1m ISK into an ENAM, just equip what he is already carrying.  Wow, that has to hurt.
---
+1 video editing BTW
---
&gt;From a real world economic perspective, the asset safety ship sailed long ago when asset safety was instituted
---
"Asset safety" was instituted when conquerable stations were introduced, long, long ago.
---
Despite r/Eve's belief that assets in a station you lost were locked away forever, you could always get them out with a courier contract after about a week or so.  The new owners are going to be importing a lot from Jita, and would like something in their hold when they go back to Jita.
---
All the current asset safety system added was a fixed price for hauling.
---
Red Giants can help give you that little bit of extra damage to take out a light/no tank ship. My guess is since OP was in a wormhole that was the case. Even just a C2 gives +44% damage.
---
&gt;...raitaru's are the de facto industry facility now...
---
I'm gonna add on to this point because I think its really important. This applies to larger engineering complexes and refineries just as much. Two points need to be considered:
---
\- *Structures conducting industry drop loot in the from the jobs they have not completed.*
---
*- Even as early as 2016/2017, roughly 80-90% of all industry jobs are done in structures (don't quote exactly I can't access the CCP chart from this computer).*
---
There is already trillions of isk hanging out in structures that can be looted after destruction (dont forget reactions eiher). This loot also drops from the relatively weaker and easier to kill structures of the bunch. Yet this fact does not seem to be a major incentive for the majority of people. 
---
In addition, the majority of player assets would be centralized into a small minority of structures where groups live and operate out of. This means that most 'spam' structures would have no additional incentive to die than they do currently, even less if you consider that more effort would be aimed at home structures. 
---
While removing asset safety might sound great to a few and pretty cool to many more, the impact of a change like this would disproportionately affect people not part of major blocs. Higher likelihood of structure death, less access to logistics for evacs, and less ability to replace losses individually or as a group.
---
On a somewhat different train of thought, I honestly think that asset safety is one of the mechanics that very much justifies making structures easier to kill.
---
I see. Was he being a dick or something about it? I know the guy loses a ship, but is there any significance to losing at ship at that time other than the “YEAH, GOTCHA BIACH!” moment?
---
Wtf. Evean a damage control II would have saved him
---
My justification is 'why not?' I've been a 'pirate' in null for years and like shooting anyone and everyone. I'm in it for any pew, not just honourable fair fight pew. It's a shit show out there and I want to participate in making it as messy as possible. 
---
I'll usually reimburse new folk though. I'm not a heartless pirate.
---
Your statement, however, was factually inaccurate, since you said that downtime happens "every day at 6am EST."   Giving a complete newbie incorrect information is not a great idea, either.
---
 --- It is public knowledge that many of the bots have moved to FW or hisec since blackout. Looks like more alfa accounts weren't enough for them.
---
And yet the change on  the blackout that you claim will fix bot its not doing it as you say here and as people say in this post they are now  in FW, hs and they still in null...
---
--- Citation needed. It takes way less effort to catch a bot now. More of them will die.
---
Less effort  for kill the capsules in gates that they dont cost anything... so its an endless loop.
---
--- Look at dotlan. You probably wouldn't, as you are just here to whine about changes you don't like, and not a rational conversation about whether the change was actually good for the game.
---
You claimed that the bots are loweing by saying i should look at dotlan so please tell me where in dotlan i can see the bots...?  
---
And the one whining here its you trying to defend what all people knew, that this isnt working , its only geting away real players, not bots. How can anyone claim that losing players is good for the game? relly..  so again  this  change isnt good at all... but just becuse this boost your game playstile (aka i want to kill caps with my alts an no effort)..
---
I believe that you have no reliable data to confirm your thesis of a net loss. I don't have the data either. Thus I choose to trust to CCP that they like money and players instead of claims you pull out of your a**.
---
So.. you dont have any data so then your claim is the correct one? lool.. who is the one pulling claims out of theyr a**  here --__--?
---
People do it all the time.  I guess it's a relic from when you didnt get the lossmail of you ejected.
---
Are you sure you were in C1, C2 or C3? We can find quite often higher classe holes in null sec.
---
Else it just mean Bob doesn't like you, sorry :'(
---
Try to offer some KM in wormhole to ease is anger, you will find more sites after that.
---
You mean with a dictor right?
---
MER is part of the blackout lol
---
You cannot board a ship that is targeted and does not "belong" to you. Pretty sure you can eject at any time, unless CCP changed that. It wouldn't make sense, but that hasn't stopped them before.     
---
    
---
Years ago, people would eject to prevent showing up on the killmail, but CCP have fixed that by showing the last pilot of the ship on the mail.
---
For me it was a flat line of 10k every. single. day. Not a single 25k or 50k.
---
I care more about Eve getting and keeping new players than the relatively minor annoyance of botting. Botting is in every game.
---
&gt;How exactly? You request the tele before you leave. 
---
RL has a tendency to not provide a schedule in advance.
---
It's mostly the fact that he got it just in time. If he didn't get the kill before downtime, there's no guarantee the ship would be there when he logged back in (if the player flying the Nyx didn't log in, the ship wouldn't reappear).
---
Depending on who you ask, the act of blowing up someone's ship is "being a dick," so that is up to you. But I don't see any rude chat in the video, so I'm sure he's fine.
---
Lower faucets are good for Eve, not bad.
---
Sorry, can't sell my corpses :)
---
But come blow me up in the GM roam today and you might get one!
---
You ought to stick around, if you had such a good time. I tend to hop games a fair bit too but EVE is the one constant in that shifting sea of games
---
Turn off resource cache, and hit the optimize bitton below and select memory.
---
Eve's PVE activities haven't changed since...well, forever. Really makes you think. Do you enjoy sitting shooting red crosses for hours?
---
There's taking any (reasonable) fights and spending all day camping ratters/miners in oversized ships, or bullying small time pvp players under a cap umbrella..
---
It's hard to describe, but tryharding when you already have the upper hand just doesn't look good, in my opinion.
---
you cannot eject it you have weapons timer
---
You know that when you use "tough shit" as an argument, the other person can just go ahead and say "tough shit" right back at your opinion, right?
---
Like this: "supers can dock, tough shit"
---
YOU WATCH YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!
---
Every minor spawns one Zorya's Leshak but the best stuff only drops from the special Zorya in World Arks. These normal ones drop mutaplamids, trig research books, and Red loot.
---
&gt;If Citadel is like the POS, limited on how many can be placed in a given system, I might be little more lenient toward safety.
---
The vast majority of systems in EVE have dozens to hundreds of moons.
---
POSes were more spammy than Citadels.  They just didn't show up on overview until you were at the moon so you didn't know.
---
Full list of limited/storyline items on the ship:
---
* Agency 'Overclocker' SB3 Dose I (20): Survived
---
* Overmind 'Goliath' Drone Tuner T25-10S (3): Destroyed
---
* Impetus Potency-50 Glamourex Booster (1): Destroyed

* Inquest 'Eros' Stasis Webifier MR-805 (1): Survived
---
* 'Citadella' 100mm Steel Plates (2): Destroyed
---
* Overmind 'Hawkmoth' Drone Tuner S10-25T (2): Destroyed
---
* Gecko (14): Survived
---
We make somewhere between 50-100 mill an hour each. Ninja salvagers aren't much of a problem if you have a dedicated salvager yourself. Ninja thieves on the other hand...
---
Yeah I'm not part of a donut. No cap umbrella for me. Ventures for the most part are pointless as I'm usually solo so not going to have much luck tackling them on my own. But I honestly see no problem in shooting miners or indy folk. Nor ransoming them then shooting them anyway. 
---
Like I said, I'll be helpful to new folk. Anyone who's been around longer knows how these things play out. Some harm but no foul imo. I've had the same happen to me from people who eventually recruited me... So yeah... Pirates don't give a toss about optics.
---
Hey Stainguy, get botting, bro!
---
You should really Google the word "pedantic." And maybe consider that your comments really aren't helping anyone. The difference between EST/EDT is not worth the massive fuss you're having over it. People just say "Eastern Time" and everyone knows what you're referring to.
---
If you have to shove your way in to demand that I correctly specify whether I mean Standard or Daylight time, then you're being a dick.
---

Just send the isk as normal. The more you try to hide it, the more obvious it is... Trust me when I say this ;)

Indeed this is not the first time within 24 hours he used that same fitting strategy - producing the same results

All I could think is how good a infiltration op this could be... Time of need and all that, a fake white knight could really screw these guys over.
---
Why *are* major choke points like that on the lower end of hisec? You'd think the empires would want major trade arteries to be protected...
---
You must tip the biggest fedoras.
---
The proportion of people using (and losing) their supers has never been higher, precisely because of how accessible they were.
---
Most people saying that it's stupid supers can dock are showing their eve-age.  The biggest barrier to entry for a super had nothing to do with needing a sitter or whatever.  The issue most people had was that the big groups, through their dominance, controlled who had a super and because they were useless on their own or you had more than the other guy, you could never use it even if you had one.  If PL or whoever knew you had an SCSAA in build, they'd come shit in your face.
---
I know a bot that has been running T3 abyssal sites undetected in relative safety in HS.. no need to really worry about anything ad it is far better than bot ratting anoms.
---
As bunny said below (and I have mentioned elsewhere), the incentive of loot drops already exists in large quantity. Asset safety removal might see a decent increase in incentive, but I'm willing to bet its going to come at a great cost in terms of how they are used and who wants to live in them. 
---
&gt;I used to love seeing things like a fitted super drop from a POS module...it’s not even possible with current citadel mechanics
---
It is possible and has even happened before. In fact, CCP had to make a mechanical change to how supers drop from structures because people couldn't collect them. They were in cans and you since cant board a ship from a can, your only option was to scoop to cargo, which is impossible for obvious reasons. 
---
Don't quote me on this, but iirc CCP also made it impossible to cancel jobs locked in a structre after its second RF to prevent loot denial. I've killed a couple structures myself where we had to bring in a freighter to scoop a couple billion in loot from jobs. 
---
The only thing that could save an active job in a structure is if it can be completed before the second RF (roughly 24-48hrs i think?). There is definitely some argument for even making that a bit more restrictive, but thats for a later discussion.
---
The bigger reasons you may not see that nearly as often, are likely due to the other machanics involved like RF cycles, structure weapons, and some of the other things you mentioned. 
---
In all honesty, if structures were more "easy come, easy go" in terms of life cycle, they would probaby die quite a bit more, likely more than if they gave more isk reward for killing.
---
I would say this is true to an extent, but upping to 32mb of decent ram isn't terribly cost prohibitive, and allows you far more flexibility to multitask. With 5 clients and a browser with 2 or three tabs open, I usually sit around the 20-24gb used in memory, with the rest available if I need it.  Additionally, while one client doesn't peg current gen gpus, it doesn't really behoove you to cheap out either.  You will never need 4 Titans or whatever team red is clubbing nvidia over the head with these days, but cheaping out on video cards can lead to other issues faster than other components.  Not the least of which is when you increase the workload on these machines, you also increase their heat profile by a lot.  Thermal throttling will make even the best rig chug.

\-1 alliance market

The price was already starting to creep up before, but high-value module salvage is jumping pretty hard in value now with the reduction in anomaly running in NS.
---
Can I have your stuff? If you know anyone quitting, feel free to tell them to give me their stuff.
---
Yeah well... Ganking mechanics have traditionally made this hard to enforce. I'm surprised there hasn't been changes to make criminal corps not able to anchor stations in highsec though. But I suppose an alt could just anchor then provide docking rights, so it'd be pointless. 
---
At the end of the day, you can't stop committed gankers and honestly I don't think you should be able to. If a massive group of suicide gankers are willing to go there, bring protection and tank well or die.
---
Nestors are extremely important for providing heavy armor logistics to trig ships
---
Moved on, hence you wrote that wall of text...
---
I hadn't manufactured anything. That is the most accepted BR there is. Besides, I used your BR for what I wrote. 
---
Objectives never were important to us. Or, rather, we attacked aiming to draw out fights. We got fights = objective achieved. We killed more than we lost and extracted without suffering too much ISK-losses - perfect setup.
---
Dunno why you came here, but your endless salt gave everyone lots of laughs. Thanks. Spin away =]
---
You need to make good use of the blessed ecm drones to clear tackle and go for their dastardly logi. Alas this is indeed less effective with the ecm drone jam duration nerf but could still make the difference between a gudfite and shitty blob death
---
Funny that it takes a lowsec alliance to break out a super fight in null....
---
Their goal is to make X RL currency per hour in profit.  If that took 10 bots before, they'd set up 10.
---
If that now takes 40, they're going to go through the extra time and effort to set up/run 40.  Just like your boss dumping additional work on you is (most likely) going to cause you to do more work for the same pay.
---
They aren't trying to only maximize their income.  First, that gets them caught because of the massive scale, and second that's way more effort than an income that is "enough".
---
Also note: They were only going after lone / smaller ships in belts, You were perfectly safe if you put more than one orca in the belt, As their Action tree decided you were too dangerous
---
The upvote, take it.
---
Maybe make it so that providing docking rights gets the alt corp flagged as an accomplice and loses their anchoring permissions?
---
I had a similar idea for preventing blanket wardecs, where being the one to declare war automatically prevents you from docking at neutral stations, including the ones owned by NPCs.
---
Nope, you are confusing change in prices with change in economic activity.  Correlated, yes by all means, but not the same thing.  As this is not r/econ101, will leave it there.
---
Careful.
---
How dare you use facts and figures !
---
Oh no, there's going to be risk! Better quit the game!
---
What, is your type of stupid especially contagious?

---
Probably they wanted their supers in as fast as possible so the snuff supers don't habe time to clear a shitton of dreads so the safest option was to drop them near their fleet until wasting time getting a cyno in position.

---
&gt;A pinged ship is then tracked for some time and if there is a repeating pattern in what they do, they're most likely bots.
---
The game already collects those action logs. You can 'ping' a player already by reporting them as a bot.

If you've ever played wow, it's like wow but without everything that makes it fun

Feels like it's missing something: https://i.imgur.com/bQDcuqt.jpg

You could also firesale 10-15% off of market value, virtually paying the same fee as for asset safety. Only that asset safety fee is an ISK sink, while fire-saling and courier contracting was not.
---
It is shit, people will probably play it for a few weeks and then realize they are playing a game that is extremely outdated.
---
hehe this reminded me of apophis.gif
---
My experience is that one someone has to resort to insults and name calling, they've already lost the argument and are simply unwilling or unable to admit it.  
---
Thanks for playing, though.
---
They saw it earlier but they didn´t care since people used Supers to bot, which generated income for them, now botters switched to alpha clones, which means no income.
---
Is that in minor conduits? I tried them but people kept tagging the last rat and getting a share of the bounty, lowering my share
---
I don't know, maybe you're right. I'd rather try to believe in the best side of people though.
---
I don't really think most EVE players live up to the stereotype - I think the average EVE player is, if anything, less toxic than most online games. But I'm certainly a little biased in this regard!
---
Agreed with that analysis. Back then I played Lineage 2 until my eyes almost fell out, and even if they released a classic version of it I wouldn't play it again. Fuck all that grinding.
---
Good to see CODE is still doing God’s work
---
There... is no argument here... you just showed up, waved your dick around, and declared yourself the winner. Nobody is playing anything but you, apparently.
---
Seriously, get a hobby.
---
I don't understand how people can say asset safety is a good thing when not having asset safety in wormhole space has incentivized a loooot more citadels dying due to them being loot pinatas
---
I honestly never got beyond playing a few minutes at a friend's house... the graphics were just a big "NO".
---
Not that I think ops idea is sound or anything, but don't you think you're contradicting yourself? Either it's a minor problem or a such a huge problem that it's prevalent... Like an epidemic.
---
Wait, did those guys just gated titans?
---
Then why not just say that/announce that it'll be delayed?
---
Oh I agree the average eve player is surprisingly decent, but the 1% outliers...
---
I hope more changes like this are in the works, risk averse carebears dwindle in numbers, and EVE attracts more players with a spine who like a challenge instead of spoon-feeding.
---
well they do, but do you have any idea how long 2 people need to monitor all these reportsed players? :P
---
Eve is gone R.I.P.
---
Years, considering the ones I reported before I quit are still going.
---
That wall of text says otherwise. Get over it. It's an idea. Propose something instead of being a dick. I can find fault in anything, especially you. Wow you're desperate.
---
its the wow but without all the QoL stuff have been added over the years, the can relase old wow, but spirit wont be back
---
the only good thing about old wow was how special it was to meet people wandering the areas and how special the raids were, now everyone looks at map flying on their mount seeing nothing from point a to b and world overall is more like giant lobby between raids, people wont find that stuff fun again and after few weeks they will go back

Tie local to gate cloak, adjust the auto drone aggro, adjust cyno mechanics (limiting to two ships seems a bit much IMO - but good conversation starter), adjust citadel mechanics, control citadel spam and provide more incentive for fights (think of POS moons).

I'm no Eve-Pro or expert but I do know Eve has changed and the content that I used to like playing is not like it was.

Didn't really miss much. I hadn't read the news item properly so I thought it was gonna be some GM-led combat event and not just a turkey shoot of "defenseless" ships. I like following my killboard stats and all but these kills just pointlessly pad the isk values now. Meh.

I haven't played in a while, how did they change ECM?
---
True but still POSes are hard capped on its location and number by given system’s moon.  You can be countered by other people setting up POSes and you might end up requiring POS bashing in order to set up your own POS. 
---
And unattended POS serves no purpose at all. Citadel still has its core functions intact even after fuel runs out.  You can still dock, tethered, store your stuff inside and best part asset safety. 
---
I am writing this because I once belonged to a group operates in hostile NULL sec area doing PVE. Our tactic was citadel spamming.  You bash one, we anchor another one or two. If you let your guard down and send a lone capital or two to bash we flash form to blob you or call 3rd party entity for sweet KMs.  Anyway that is outside the discussion but you know what I mean. 
---
I am afraid soon or later there will be more citadels than POSes ever were if not already.
---
do you have a second computer by chance? i run 3 clients across 2 computers to keep the lag low since im also on a budget. having a 3 and 3 setup would cut down lag quite a lot.
---
&gt; It is possible and has even happened before. In fact, CCP had to make a mechanical change to how supers drop from structures because people couldn't collect them. They were in cans and you since cant board a ship from a can, your only option was to scoop to cargo, which is impossible for obvious reasons.
---
uhhhh. no.
---
finished ships will only ever drop in wormhole space. things only drop from structures if they're currently in-progress industry jobs, in which case they drop as the materials, not the end results. you can't get a super or titan into wormhole space.
---
even then, if a ship drops into a can, you can eject it from the can and board it/shoot it from there.
---
Have a fit?  I've also wanted to give this a try
---
This might be fun for a bit and certainly gives a lol but if you look at https://br.inyour.space/?s=636,636,636,636&amp;b=8748960,8749140,8749200,8749260&amp;e=90,90,30,90&amp;t=b you only killed a bit under 300m isk. I mean if you'd won the fight against your tengu bro you would have killed more. at the same time those bots sadly make the losses back just too quickly. Especially with barges. The only solution is a better anti bot program by CCP.
---
Ive noticed that too. I triple-boxed on an i7 8gb ram PC recently with graphics turned all the way down and the damn thing had an anyeurism.
---
I never played it but giving it a shot, however I am not quitting eve over it, WoW lacks ships! I honestly want to see what all the hype is about. Also knowing how long it will take me to level I might quit before I even get to 60.
---
Except that looks nothing like "all the shit" of a player. Rather like a market restock.
---
:claps with a teary eye: Beautiful

&gt;"tough shit" as an argument,
---
It wasnt an argument
---
Keep telling yourself your own statement. CODE. Would have ganked regardless then been like oops.
---
&gt;True but still POSes are hard capped on its location and number by given system’s moon
---
It's not much of a cap when there are 100 moons.
---
&gt;You can be countered by other people setting up POSes and you might end up requiring POS bashing in order to set up your own POS
---
Are you trying to argue setting up 100 POSes was not "spammy"?
---
&gt;You bash one, we anchor another one or two.
---
Guess what people used to do with POSes?
---
&gt;I am afraid soon or later there will be more citadels than POSes ever were if not already.
---
Again, the vast majority of systems in Eve have dozens to hundreds of moons.  And an enormous number of those had at least a POS stick.  Finding an empty moon to anchor your own POS was quite the challenge.
---
It will send a stark message though.

These are all excellent ideas and I think most who understand why things are stagnant would argue in the same exact manner. We needed tweaks, not the sledgehammer approach. The only thing I cant quite figure out is the incentive for fights aspect, dunno what would actually work and in that sense I wouldnt mind an experiment phase to try out different ideas and see what sticks.

At least two titans were saved by subcaps clearing off tackle and extracted in low armor. Probably the only reason BR is almost a draw and not a one-sided mess.

No, not really, a video game like eve shouldn’t cater to those types of challenges. Eve was far more fun prior to asset safety’s implementation because invasions actually had meaning to everyone involved rather than the current system which only really affects the minority that handle logistics for their alliances, it’s too easy to just teleport your shit somewhere else. Now we get stuck with stale narratives and things like anime vs. not anime wars because no one really cares about the consequences of getting their shit kicked over since they can pay some iskies to get all their stuff sent somewhere else.  
---

---
Bring back the pain of real loss to the game please
---
I guess you are right. It is spammy with POSes as well.  It is just in my mind that having no hard cap makes citadel way more toxic.  Especially with asset safety and stupidly grindy structure bashing it requires to remove one compared to POSes. 
---
I recently read an article. https://imperium.news/jintalks-whats-wrong-with-citadels/
---
So I may  be bit biased.  I still think citadels are way worse than POSes.
---
From a purely mathematical perspective yes. Throw in the activity the Explorer is trying to do (either trying to burn to the hole or realizing their error and rebookmarking), and the inexperience/panic factor, and the Explorer is probably going to get caught.

I like to do exploration, and having hunters around could be actually fun. At least in wormholes. In nullsec people were just pain in the ass. Bombers blowing you up as you warp on a gate, astero locking you up then a saber and a frigate warp on grid to fuck you up.. ugh. Baiting a pve ship into a fight then ending it in 20s? Meh.

Are the Kostenadza implants for speeding up the ramp up speed/damage on Trig weapons? It shows as a " **damageMultiplierBonusPerCycleModifier"**

Furthermore technically he could just get his friend or alt to shoot him and get the ISK for himself that way. Which indeed makes the bounty system kinda pointless!

Ah

It looks like you get a higher maximum damage multiplier (about 60%, it's pretty significant) in exchange for a reduction in ramp up speed, but there's no description on them yet so it's possible that's not the correct interpretation of what the stats mean

It's actually impressive to load 97 billion in a freighter with no single stack exceeding 10b and only 3 that exceed 2b, 2 of them barely.  What a tremendous assortment of stuff to pile into your freighter.

Luckily with the new copy formatting change, notes can be copied and sent in a mail with links and all. Not exactly the same but it works.
---
I'd be lying if I said I didn't use it to jam people up who were expecting solo PVP.  I'm sorry and hope I can be forgiven.
---
&gt;This shouldn't be how it works.
---
This is how it has mostly worked for a long time. When CCP released the stats on engineering complex useage about 6-12 months afterword, you get an idea of how industry flowed most of the time. The vast majority of it was done in NPC Stations or outposts. The small portion that was done in POSes came with the limitations of storage volume, and before that (iirc) job slots also set a soft limiter on how much could be stuffed into a POS.
---
Now the vast majority of industry is done in ECs. In fact, more is done in ECs now than was done in stations/outposts before. Its not a stretch to assume that the amount of materials that are vulnerable to destruction at any given time is magnitudes higher than it has ever been. 
---
One more key factor to consider; for at least the few years before structures came in, it was fairly easy to simply store the bulk of your materials in a station until they could be used in a build from a POS in the same system. The change in risk to inactive assets has only really gone from being locked out of an outpost temporarily (still able to sell items, possibly able to regain access) vs having up to a 20-day lockout with your stuff going to one of a few predictable points in lowsec. 
---
That also assumed most manufacturing was done in low or null, and before the indy changes in crius, I don't think it was. 
---
More importantly, the attackers never got that stuff unless you intentionally put it in the POS. When attacking an outpost, all you ever got was the outpost. 
---
My main point is that keeping the bulk of inactive materials safe was fairly trivial before. One thing that has gone up is how much of the active materials are at risk at any given time. Restricting that initial window for job completion is definitely something to look at as it is probably the easiest risk factor to manage.
---
I get why people think they want it, I too wish I were 14 again and could stay up all night raiding with my guild mates. But I’m not, and rereleasing ancient content won’t change that.

Yeah.  No way am I flying it without logi.  My corps small gang fleets never have logi.
---
that needs to work for chat channels as well I think. but yeah its not the same.
---
I guess cyno v would be useful.  I'm currently in a C2 wh so not particularly useful right now though.
---
You're right.  I'll hang on to it and refocus training toward damps.
---
I wouldn't say they've improved it since then, but I still think the Classic WoW hype is highly over stated. It wasn't as great as everybody is going on about. Lots of little annoyances that got buffed away over the years.
---
One of the things I remember hating most of all things in all MMO's I've played is having to literally run to a dungeon entrance in the wild in vanilla WoW. As much as the group-finder feature has made WoW dungeons insufferable to actually play, the teleportation to dungeon part of it was a massive improvement.
---
In a surprise to nobody, there's no conspiracy here. Just vacation season.
---
I would love to use it in fleets, but most of my corps small gang pvp doesn't include logi.  Thing is definitely getting primaried if I take it out.
---
We need more of this (both supers dying and people singing while killing them)
---
SO MUCH THIS
---
Ships jammed can still attack the ship jamming them.
---
I've found ECM in wormholes to still be very effective just because most fights are (and expect to be) pretty close-range. People generally aren't prepared for the 100k+ optimal jamming Blackbird showing up and shutting down their logi/DPS.
---
Some of that inflation surely has to do with the speculation surrounding the recon market affecting the full supply chain for T2 production.
---

&gt; How do margin traders make any money passively?!
---
Generally they don't? As you've discovered, it's an active pursuit.
---
It helps to choose your items carefully. If there are 2x as many active buy orders as there are items traded in a day, for example, you'll have a hard time getting any items with a buy order. Or if the historical price average is almost identical to the sell order price, again it's something that doesn't usually sell to buy orders.
---
That's what I just thought Serinus (Opppssss, too late!) dammit :-D

your not sending the note tho your sending a link which behind the scenes tells the server, hay this guy wants a copy of the that guys note.

For chat channels Id love to be able to copy paste in those in game links, like being able to copy some text along with a system link or a link to corp info and just being able to copy paste that into a chat channel would be a help.

If I had to guess, it's probably client side only with a randomization factor.  IE the server tells you x is shooting y, and then the client's graphics engine picks one of the random target points to draw the beam/missile/shell hitting.  Otherwise that's a lot of useless server load/data to transmit.  So everyone's screenshots would look different (unless it's deterministic rather than random).
---
So I tried this suggestion in Low Sec, being able to swap a covert / probes fit with a combat PVE fit is definitely cool.... However the Sentry drones just don't work for me, targeting limitations and drone control limitations basically mean my sentries (that can shoot out to like 120km), aren't really able to be told to do anything until the enemy is about 65km in my case, even with some extra modules to help with control range and targeting range.. 
---
So I think I'll have to use this with medium / heavy drones, and just make sure I align out and be ready to run. as my non-gank strategy. Once my drones engage I can always get some distance (even beyond targeting range) while my drones finish off an enemy.
---
Sadly I AFK'd at a warpable anom while in chat with someone and didn't notice a force recon ship appear directly in front of me... I wasn't aligned and they snagged me and slowly neuted and killed me
---
Yeah. We've even had instances where certain degenerates did nothing \*except\* suicide gank newbies who had literally just started playing minutes prior.
---
Odds are it's just more of Alex's propaganda. Remember the ALOD (Awful Loss Of the Day) from mittens.com?? almost all of those were created by Goons to generate publicity... just like this. They just use a member's alt, fill it with random bling and pop it. Notice CODE. (Alex, Mittens, James315.. all the same person).
---
When you have trillions of ill-gotten ISK sitting around, this is what you do. Generate SHOCKING propaganda. Just like his hero, Goebbels and the rest of the 3rd Reich.

 Greetings Tenacious Testers!
---
The EVE Dev team have been working on a package of tweaks, fixes and improvements for the September release, which have reached the our public [test server Singularity](https://community.eveonline.com/support/test-servers/singularity/) in today’s update.
---
These changes (with a couple of exceptions) are primarily focused on improving the experience for pilots in their first few hours and days in New Eden, but of course many of these will be generally useful for pilots of all ages and experience levels.
---
If nothing significant turns up during the testing period these changes will be released in the September patch. As always, if you wish to help, head on over to Singularity and get involved!
---
**Changes**
---
General:
---
* Ships will now automatically enter warp after three minutes of attempting to align and reach the required speed.
---
   * This will now put a maximum cap on how long a ship can be bumped or stuck on geometry.
---
   * We’ve discussed this change in the past but its implementation hit some technical roadblocks which have now been resolved.
---
Fitting:
---
* We’ve added a series of warnings to the fitting window, to help new and old players improve their fitting skills and avoid some more common pitfalls. More info and feedback in the [Fitting Warnings thread](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/fitting-warnings/184537).
---
* The larger simulation button has been restored to the fitting window.
---
Ships and Modules:
---
* Data and Relic analyzers being made non-repeatable (As only a single cycle is ever required at a time)
---
* A new “Shield &amp; Armor” characteristic has been added to various ships that can be optimally fitted with either a shield or armor tank.
---
* All FoF missiles now have a Maximum FoF targeting range which they will correctly enforce when choosing a target.
---
User Interface:
---
* The settled system tab for NPC corporations has been improved to more clearly show their nearest station.
---
* Attempting to repackage a container now gives a special warning message.
---
* Added a Buy all option in the Kill report window.
---

---
Tutorial:
---
* The Tutorial page in the agency has been completely updated.
---
   * It now has a clearer design to help users track their status
---
   * The Replay button for active or completed tutorial steps has been removed
---
   * The rewards players are receiving from the tutorial should now be better displayed
---
* Removed duplicate operation entries in the notification settings
---
* Updated the Info Panel for the Tutorial and Missions to make the buttons clearer
---
**Known Issues:**
---
* The info panel contains unecessary empty space
---
* Button design in the info panel may be subject to change
---
Thanks and happy testing!

BRILLIANT.

RIP fof farming. You wont be missed.
---
3min and it warps? WTF
---
I'm pretty sure this is going to happen I keep comparing it to oldschool runescape it almost died because they didn't release content so unless they release content and maybe old expansions or new content in the same style  of WoW classic like OSRS has done its going to die
---
And the nostalgia for anyone who hasn't played a private server will be *really good*, but that doesn't keep you playing a game. 
---
Every year or so I get that itch for some WoW nostalgia so I'll hop on a private server and level through the old Night Elf starting areas, and it really takes me back to being a middle school/high school shut-in (FeelsGoodMan), but that's about it. I never stick around to actually put substantial effort in.
---
Dear god, someone please explain the concept of modules to this guy.

So, are sombreros really just huge brimmed fedoras or what?  What's your stance on cereal with ice cream, it's like milk.

Well, you could go poke a POS to generate a timer and with luck, the RF would be in your TZ. Where as now, you can shoot a citadel but if theyre opposite TZ of you, then theres no point.

---
Yeah, totally. Pods are so useful for doing things.
---
Disbanding? Try banning.
---
Thank you so much for giving some insight into this! It's wonderful to hear that such a diverse team gets along so well :3
---
Keep in mind, it does break their lock on any targeted ships when your ECM lands, just like before. and the enemy pilot will have to Re-Lock the jamming ship/drones after. Yes it is a significant change to ECM mechanics, but if you're in your Falcon/jamgu 100km away from the battle and jamming enemy logi out, you'll still be an effective force multiplier. Another Jam-gu role that has been used recently is to stop entosis ships by breaking their lock on the I-hub/command nodes- very effective if you fly it right. Like most others have commented, now is prolly the best time to have a recon cruiser alt.
---
I ve heard speculations about next song we might do. Stay tuned

Someone is worried about his bots.

Seems to just be continuing a trend of later and later releases lately. Looking back they appear to have come out:
---
June MER on July 18th
---
May MER on June 18th
---
April MER on May 13th
---
March MER on April 11th
---
February MER on March 11th
---
Hopefully they don't take as long as September last year, it was released with October on November 15th!

Making P4 from raw dirt is a multi-account undertaking, generally. You might be able to do it with 1 account making Sterile Conduits, Organic Mortar Applicators, or Nano Factories. You will probably need at least one character with CCU V and one with IPC V.
---
A vintage description of making P4 from dirt can be found in [Berial's PI Bible](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7OHJUxM09OsUkYzWmdKNll2WW8/view) which uses 2 accounts and still advises "know your limits."
---
I'm glad someone else out there understands that they've broken the game enough that it isn't somewhere I WANT to escape to anymore. I also have 300 some steam games, and game consoles. They've made my real life and all those other gaming options more appealing.

Thank God. And the devs. Ever hoarded your loot in a station container and unfortunately hit 'repackage all'?

Yeah that bot hunting group is called F-ing CCP.. /u/CCP_falcon

They have ALL of the resources to squash this mess once and for all.

This is no longer a Player (and never was) responsibilty.  Its the Corporation, CCP and their Parent Companies responsibility.

This is ridiculous that its being discussed by the players at all and just testimony to CCP mismanagement and incompetence!

that would be brilliant actually, I do this with bookmarks, I make a bookmark and name it a short descriptive name for whats in the hanger, then you can just open the hanger and mouse over it to see what the BM says. having an actual feature for this would be good
---
&gt;Modules not providing bonus (for example if you have a Magnetic Field Stabilizer fit but all your guns are projectiles the Magstab will be flagged as not providing its bonus)
---
this will help new players greatly... but I'll miss the good laughs such killmails gave me.
---
No, what I meant is that ship hulls are seeded with a bunch of stratified data points, that your PC then randomly selects and points your guns to. This is similar to how Spider-Man 2 (the game) did it.
---
P.S. The calculations for the game can be done both ways, on your computer and on the server. If done on the computer, the game would prove heavy at some point, such as that the processor would not be able to sustain as many data streams. If done on the server, however, it would put a heavier load onto the network, as the servers would need to take time to calculate and send large data files back and forth. This would also prove potent against some hackers. And, knowing EvE servers, we can assume it probably done on the servers.

That's a post...
---
I'm kind of impressed by how many things went right for that bomber. Environmental damage bonus, picking the right range to hit a moving target, and the target activating MWD and moving into perfect position rather than warping off. 
---
I bet the dude was ecstatic when he got the killmail. That or bored out of his mind from doing it so many times before -- it was either very lucky or very good.
---
Another great change then
---
The other one was good advice for a newbie preparing to day-trip for PVE. This one is a moderately accurate description of a PVP pattern.
---
this!
---
Or a spy, or courier contracts. Either way none of these options are a 100% loss compared to the removal of citadel asset safety would cause. Even fire sale still allowed you to recover some isk.
---
I was thinking about getting a new CPU (and some RAM to go with it) but I'm worried about it fitting into the motherboard.
---
Well there is nothing wrong with the actual gank. No reason not to film it. - IF (and that's a key word here) there was any RMT, it wouldn't have been visible there. It's something that happens outside normal gameplay, obviously.
---
&gt; General:
---
Ships will now automatically enter warp after three minutes of attempting to align and reach the required speed.
---
This will now put a maximum cap on how long a ship can be bumped or stuck on geometry.

We’ve discussed this change in the past but its implementation hit some technical roadblocks which have now been resolved.
---
Bye bumping, you wont be missed

It is epic.

Well eventually you're paying someone to play the game for you. Just have to continue putting dents in the way of botters so the problem stays small.

Its because of CODE. that they are lower end.

---
You wont see it, in truth. It's obvious it will show the reality of the effects of Blackout. Massive drop in industry and PVE activity. 
---
You will never see it without some major changes by CCP to somehow hide the reality. Probably use some alternate metrics that will be touted as 'new' and 'more informational'.
---
They fucked up and they know it. This is evidence.
---
Yes
---
That's true, but I don't want a fair fight, I want kills and schemes that generate income so i don't have to be a little slave in some belt or mission site. 
---
While the fights are one sided, I'd make the analogy that when a person is fishing or hunting for his dinner he doesn't gain enjoyment out of it because it was a close call where the fish nearly killed him. He gets enjoyment from the art of capturing, tricking, tracking, and knowing where to find them.
---
Yes but they're expensive to make so not many on markets.
---
Fair point on Eve's codebase and decisions being....questionable, but the fact that you can turn them down/off via graphic settings is the likely answer to your concern about client weight.  Add to that the way Eve sounds are handled (locally calculated directional and Doppler renderings) being a major PC load concern in large fights, and I'd expect the weapon animations are locally executed as well.
---
Sleepers will nuke your drones less if you fit EWAR on your ship (a paint or a web to make the frigates easier to hit is good). A RLML Caracal should do fine for most of the low tier gas sites. Just buffer fit it and dps race. If you get low, warp out and warp back.
---
The socket is probably different if you have an intel CPU, so the mobo wont work. An AM3+ socket mobo from Asus or Gigabyte should be quite affordable, and an easy swap if youre already using DDR3 ram.
---
Upgrading to a Ryzen requires an AM4 socket, which means buying DDR4 ram as well (AFAIK) so Im staying with my 8350 for the time being. Black Friday is just around the corner!
---
/u/GM_Lelouch I Quit playing after the first week once I became aware of the years of botting that has taken place within Eve Online.
---
I REFUSE to play a game where my efforts and time and money are made worthless by botting, bottom-line!
---
Thera should just have a wh to half of null each day. Rotate every day to the other half. Super highway inc.
---
Not enough times to learn from my mistakes apparently. Now I can finally go back to worrying about losing ships when staying up late, instead of having to re-organize my hangar in the morning.
---
Sure. But that doesnt explain DED loot or t1 products does it? And Im fairly certain t2 prods (and mats) were already up before the cyno announcement. Its fairly simple, if demand stays the same but supply drops the prices will go up.
---
But the point behind my point is that I see alot of people using PLEX price as a sole product for when talking about inflation/deflation. Thats an extremely bad approach and is why you irl use baskets to measure inflation/deflation. So saying we had rampant inflation when in fact we had a mild deflation only tells me that they dont understand economics. 
---
I have seen many other misconceptions about the economic factors during this month as well and even from CCP. Things that people who have any economic knowledge beyond reading the paper would tell you.

I think it took me 4 months playing a fair amount to get to 60 my first time in the original.  Grinding for a mount was just as annoying.
---
I think it has to do with resources just like the moons were. I dont know how tho. I dont even know if there is a good answer. I mean in the end we need more people in the game to create conflict.

So this is a genuine question but do you never play any other old games? Its not like Classic is the first time people are going back to play an old game and it's not like people shit on people that say they went back and played KOTOR, or Majora's Mask, or literally any Mario game.
---
So does this mean the blink and vanish bugs will be resurrected?

This. People crying about risk averse when their playstyle is literally the most risk averse in the game.

Cebraio is correct, what you encountered was most likely a bug.

I mean meeting stones existed in Vanilla, someone had to run but it didn't have to be everyone in the group. Also that seems like a very odd stance from someone that plays eve lol
---
Looks like they missed the Marshall.
---
bumping will still exist, just that some t1-point-equipped corvette/frigate will spawn just under every 3 minutes to keep tackle
---
It is booming, but it didn't until they started developing it further
---
This is awesome. Nice work!
---
Less industry directly results in EVERYTHING in-game costing much, much more. And without bounties going up based in the 'player-driven' economy, less items are available. You have to do more work to get less product. This directly results in less players in-game... which compounds the beginning of the problem. 
---
If this was all about limiting super-ratting then give supers a beacon that can be seen by all players on the map... and get rid of Blackout.
---
You pvp dicks got what you wanted. How do you pay for your shit? Don't be that hypocrite and say you mine it. Are you just Credit Card douchebags? Well buy up all the PLEX you want with your RL $. Just means even fewer players in-game. PLEXing an account is already essentially a full-time job. Do you play the game to PLEX your account, or do you PLAY the game?
---
  Fewer players = less content, even for you dickless 'elite pvp' gankers. You never had the balls to go after ships with teeth (unless you pre-arranged it with your dickbag counterpart in the other corp/alliance). 
---
How does it not click in your brain? More industry = less cost of EVERYTHING in-game = more content available to more players = more players pvping and even more players pveing as targets to gank.
---
10 years in this game and still, it's like this fundamental logic is lost on everyone involved.
---
Im assuming any warp distruption applied to the target cancels/resets this counter of course

Could you please make the starting overview not trash? You don't have to use z-s or saraschawa but at least make it not the current default.

Yep, you can get all of that from a private server. Including that feeling you get when you picked night elf and remember you have to run to stormwind.

Yeah dude they are super easy to blitz too. Hierarchy, Independence, and Radiance each take maybe 10m per to do and you get some dank sentient loot &amp; possibly chips.
---
Depends. Are you too braindead to try anything other than brawling a blob alone and dying in a fair complaining about unfair fights? Then ecm might as well not exist for you. If you fly with friends and understand there's more to combat than overcompensating with dank paper DPS then yeah, ecm can help your group score some dank kills. Just pretend the widow doesn't exist, and fit for kiting.

&gt;Ships will now automatically enter warp after three minutes of attempting to align and reach the required speed.
---
&gt;This will now put a maximum cap on how long a ship can be bumped or stuck on geometry.
---
Chaos btw lmao literally making it safer for carebears across the game. Another dumpster tier idea from none other than CCP.
---
&gt;Less industry directly results in EVERYTHING in-game costing much, much more. And without bounties going up based in the 'player-driven' economy, less items are available. You have to do more work to get less product. This directly results in less players in-game... which compounds the beginning of the problem.
---
Logically then, CCP should make it infinitely cheap to produce everything, as that would result in the higest possible activity.
---
Seriously though, the last few years have been an experiment in the very hyperabundance you advocate. The productivity of producers is hugely higher than it was a few years ago.
---
Where then was the soaring activity your hypothesis predicted?
---
here i am not sure if I was in r/wowclassic or r/eve
---
Those really sound like a great set of changes! The bumping one I'm not sure should qualify merely as a QoL one, but it was about time they fixed that "stuck in eternal bump" bullshit mechanic.
---
It's summer and no-one is in the office. Non critical tasks like this will get deferred
---
Saw my first titan last night, hot dropped a bunch of Loki's on guys who had no shot, seems like elite pvp to me
---
Some say theres a guy that solo bots incursions and Ive also heard of abyssal bots.
---
Also every now and then someone breaks away from their fleet to try engage your ECM and it's a nice chance to catch their tackle on their lonesome if you have the people to spare
---
ecm is dead. used to be it would jam your target
---
but now...it jams anything but for you.  if you jam the enemy, they can shoot you.
---
so its basically "hey who wants to be volunteer for focus fire"

---
Do you just constantly refresh that site or something?
---

---
Thought it was just me. Whew.
---
Why would this be a bad thing? That only means people are actually living in NS.
---
ECM in its current iteration is fucking garbage. When it affects something other than your opponent(s) ability to lock you it will be good. 
---
My idea is for it to offline 1 random module per cycle.
---
was talking to the guy from the previous post and he inspired me to make one from a wormholers perspective

Pretty much this, even if the nerf complely fucked certain ships (like the Griffin Navy) it still is a very nasty form of ewar if used properly.
---
"Jams but doesn't actually Jam."
---
I have a feeling that ability to deliver assets in Upwell stations to Dust vets was patched before anyone thought to try it. Probably would have done something really funky if a ship was delivered to dust merc and the player station was destroyed or unanchored to generate a killmail.
---
In incoming nerf hammer on fof ratting in high class wormholes will be pushing more people to the Nestor, I would expect the leshak to experience a similar jump in price.

Yes adding features shouldn't break current features.

Been forever since I used a carrier, has the NSA always prevented warp while active? The description was updated to mention warp drives.

Look at the new test server patch notes. FOF ratting is getting the nerf hammer

I don't know about that, look at old school runescape. It's been going for years now and surpassed the actual up to date game

They can, of course, do this, and yes in  Minors this is an increased problem. Majors and World Arks, the stakes are higher, but it also lends itself to challenges for the ninja (and worth having some gankers on standby to swat the pest).
---
Either way, we have had no trouble raking in the ISK, and we do it on stream, which _has_ to increase the amount of harassment we get.
---
Ok I’ll concede to your point, however, you’re using the term asset safety to describe the concept as a whole where I am using it to describe the current mechanic that’s in place. I am still 100% against the current system and want it to revert to how it was before where it encouraged player driven workarounds like the ones we have both described. simply clicking a button when you reinstall the game and have all your shit show up in random lowsec stations is trash
---
I double checked the dates for 2018 and 2019, they are correct. (The only thing incorrect is the february 2018 report being actually the last one by Quant.)

Well stuff like this wont happen after the september updat,thanks ccp.

Nostalgia is a thing but it wears off very rapidly is what I mean. I have tons of games that were the shit and I enjoyed every single second playing them, but when I tried them again I realized they can´t compete at all with more recent games. People get older and they aren´t as easily satisfied now.
---
I played Battlefield 1942 and did work on mods for it, it was a blast!!! But playing the game now would be horrible. Often games are great in relation to what is on the market at the time it comes out, but when a few years have passed and more advanced games have been played it is only a very good memory. 
---
It comes down to the saying: "Everything was better in the past" when in fact it is not.
---
Some hardcore fans will obviously stick to classic for a long time, but I doubt the majority of players will. It wasn´t only the state of the game that gave people great memories, it was the friends they made and the fact that it was all new for them.
---
Just my opinion (based on my own experience). ;)

This pretty much rules out being in a nullsec entity. Nseccers require scout/titan/fax/~~cyno~~ recon alts for you to even be considered a functional member of space society.

The bomb runs are literally identical lol... And anti fighter, focus voids, all the same... Anchor FC, either bomb on anchor if called as such, or align to Target and bomb when called.  Again not saying this wasn't awesome or that it takes zero skill, it does... But your acting like what we just witnessed was a pioneering moment by Seddow doing something that no one else does ... Except it's done in this exact way dozens of times a week.

enjoy classic and it's breakthrough gameplay of mashing 123 and maybe 4
---
If you can't get your gank fleet together by the time you've been bumping the dude for 3 minutes maybe you need to stop being bad.
---
&gt;And the PvEers need hunters as well, I mean if ships dont die their efforts are worth less.
---
No, PVErs need PVPers, not those kids who style themselves "Hunters". It's highly probable that far more ships are destroyed in actual fights than by idiots zipping through or cloaky camping in nullsec, avoiding actual fights, and hoping to luck their way into a free ratter/miner kill.
---
ACTUAL PVPers (those who actually look for, facilitate, and take FIGHTS) are the lifeblood of EVE. They're the actual people who make up the community of EVE, create its content, and make it successful. THESE should be the foremost players in CCP's mind when making design decisions, instead of catering to the parasites who call themselves "hunters" and leaving their most important customers to hope that their playstyle gets a bit of windfall from it.
---
Dedicated Krabs aren't nearly as important as the aforementioned group of PVPers, but they still pay their subs and they don't directly harm anyone else's enjoyment of the game,though they DO have the potential to cause economic damage if left unchecked, as they have been doing lately (note that "checking" something's behavior doesn't necessarily mean killing it). They're kind of like pets - they're not as important as actual people, but as long as you keep them on a leash and don't let them shit everywhere, they're mostly harmless and can be a source of entertainment and enjoyment for people.
---
The parasites that call themselves "hunters" generally contribute nothing to the game and exist only to make it less fun for others. They're like the fleas on your pets - they make the pets miserable and can be a lesser nuisance to people as well, and everyone is better off without them. Unfortunately, certain individuals at CCP seem to consider the fleas their pets, with the people and animals they bite being nothing more than expendable and easily replaceable flea food. 
---
Did you ever wonder if people in general might be less risk averse and more likely to look for/take fights if there weren't so many self-styled "hunters" and hotdroppers out there who never\* contribute content and exist only to consume it?
---
\* at least while engaging in the aforementioned activities, which is the point here

lol chaos mean no pvp in highsec now.
---
Checks out, dead as fuck
---
I dont see why not
---
It's a grossly outdated game that genuinely runs on rose-tinted glasses and kids who now play wow that want to "experience" what it was to playback then.
---
Old school Runescape was going to meet this fate too but survived by updating it, which a resounding amount of wow fanbois don't want.
---
Ya that's fair but you can't just remove asset safety or revert back because that's not how citadels work. Sure they could be a different system, but any system that leads to destruction of player asset is not something that seems reasonable.
---
Elite Dangerous is very shallow, I really like the flight mechanic and the modular fitting of ships. But everything you do in this game has no real effect on the "environment". It felt like a really bad grind after a short amount of time playing it. 
---
And playing with friends is just a hassle, you need to keep close to each others location (solar system) or you will spend some time to catch up to your friends, when you come online and they went off to farm some materials, visited some ruins to unlock blueprints or visited an engineer that is 100s of lightyears from your location.
---
You can´t directly trade anything with another player (you could drop stuff in space and let them pick it up, no materials or credits though) you can´t store any trade goods at any station, except for modules. You can´t build any kind of structures that would make you feel that this is your home. Even though all players share the same server, there is still instances, even in open play. You could avoid any hostiles by simply logging out and switching to solo or private then fly from a to b, and relog to open play when you are done.
---
It could be a really great game, but sadly Frontier Developments doesn´t get there shit together.
---
My personal opinion, others might differ!
---
I mean I play in AUTZ so ya i would lol, it was 90% sarcasm tho, just poking at the general consensus at least the friends/enemies I interact with, that AUTZ is dead... AUTZ in general is slower but the fights I seem to take part in are just as exciting if not more...
---
Control + c, open notepad, Control + v ..... copy and paste into notepad in widows removes all formatting.   Copy from notepad and paste wherever and you shouldn’t have an issue.  It’s an extra step but resolves the issues.
---
Hence the reason why payouts are only a percentage of the amount of the loss.
---
That's fair, definitely a big part of it for me is that like 20 people that have diverged to various games since BC/Wrath era WoW all came back for this and are all playing together again, so that obviously biases my enjoyment before the game has even come out. But I think people underestimate how many people really like the cycle of Classic. I will say it confuses me a touch more on this subreddit than others since I know for a fact that some of the people saying how grindy classic was will eagerly hold hole control for 12 hours doing literally nothing, or fly through 45 systems just to get a fight.
---
I guess my flip-side to the "'Everything was better in the past' when in fact it is not." is that in some cases iteration has hurt games and they really were better in the past. And that some old games do definitely live up to their reputation and age very well, obviously not true in all cases but it's subjective.
---
last year the july report was out on august 8, the august was out on sept 10th...

That was added earlier this year.

Some things are better, lots of things are worse.

It was possible back then to actually be good at the game.  Then Blizzard dumbed it down to the point a mildly retarded amoeba would be as good as anyone else.

FoF ratting?

This doesn’t do what you think it does. ctrl + c from the notepad copies formatting as well now.
---
It was the first solution I tried.
---
Just adapt or die friendo
---
Wait, what are people using FOF missiles for?
---
I've had a blast with one character in a NS Corp. Sure you can't solo all the things, but you make friends and do it with them. You don't HAVE to have any alts. You will still be able to go in fleets, roams/pvp , krab to your heart's content. And then ask a few other players to do something together. Doesn't have to be a one man band.
---
**Ships will now *automatically* enter warp after three minutes of attempting to align and reach the required speed**
---
It's a ratting method used in wormholes that abuses missiles and the rat's maximum engagement range to freely krab without risk
---
Weird.

Most blopsers actually want fights. But if you're gonna drop a bunch of supers and fax you're not gonna get one.

When a player quits EVE and goes to WoW, the average IQ in both games increases.

\*orbits you at 100km\*
---
pssh nothing personnel kid
---
&gt; bad for no more bumping people so they cant warp
---
Bumping itself isn't removed, it can still be used... though it does mean you can't just have a target bumped indefinitely for ransom (you're just wasting their time and pose no threat). Gankers will just have to pick targets carefully and be ready to get in soon after the target is bumped rather than "sometime in the next hour or so".
---
Yeah but only after it basically died a couple months in and then Jagex took over and started updating it with new content. It’s not even close to the same game it started as now. Before that happened, it was very much a couple weeks of nostalgia then quit scenario.
---
Rig a kitsune so it can jam from over 100km, stay back from your gang a bit, and you can totally dominate.
---
You should see how a group flys and attacks so much more confidently after they hear you say "Jammed!!"
---
Because they could have an absurdly long range and didn't need to target, people would sit at Sleeper sites in Wormholes at 400k+ and fire FOF missiles to farm in complete safety. (from the rats, at least)
---
It is now, wasn’t before they started adding new content.
---
*laughs in 2 years of playing on nostalrius
---
I really like ED, but the"impact on the game world" is... not a huge selling point.  You could get your own player faction and spread that, and you can participate in power play for that, but it's relatively limited.  Personally, I found more satisfaction in personal goals (thargoid killing, mostly), but some of the factional stuff had been fun.
---
That said: the game goes on sale a lot and it's worth a shot at the ~$7.50 entry fee.
---
Haha! Now I want to try this!
---
Heh i asked in my corp and nobody said they had it ... so i thought there was a setting that i may have clicked. Nice to know others have it suddenly as well ... so we all clicked that hidden setting then i guess :D
---
It's just wormholes ruining stuff again. It's not FOF that are the issue here, just how they are used in WHs
---
Not more people. More reasons FOR conflict.
---
I played on private servers years ago.  The biggest had a consistent population over over 10000 players.  I don't think it's gonna have a problem.
---
There's a reason that your corp is considered trash tier by the rest of Null. You depend on a broken mechanic and then cry when it gets fixed. If you still cannot kill a freighter in 3 minutes, uninstall Eve

Ah cool cool, I'm personally a metal guy, but i can see why you enjoy orchestra and electronic

I think I made it about 3 levels into Keen IV before I was like "fuck this shitty game".

I never considered flying the Jamgu far away.  All my fits are brick tanks right in the thick of things.  What's the max range a Jamgu can get?

Spelling is also serious business.

They are using it as an excuse to ban supers/titans from Lowsec.
---
So basically devalued Nestors is was just another side effect of botting ?
---
And what makes you sure in such assumptions?
---
point them, if concord kills you have enough people to keep them pointed, if you cant get a fleet the target in less than 3 minutes you are doing something wrong
---
Anchoring is pretty good for mobile warp disruptor and cyno inhib, which  will be more powerful with the cyno changes.
---
&gt; played KOTOR, or Majora's Mask, or literally any Mario game.
---
None of these involve multiple mind numbing rep grinds that each take dozens of hours.
---
I believe they were also used by lvl4 mission runners in highsec.
---
It seems so.
---
&gt; Im assuming
---
you know there is or was more people playing vanilla wow private servers than people playing eve right?
---
Protip (at least for now); contract your containers to an alt and then deliver them back to the toon they're supposed to be on. The deliveries hangar is seperate from your main hangar making repackage all mistakes impossible. You can't move stuff in/out of the delivery hangar by default but stuff inside a container in the delivery hangar is no problem.
---
Downside is that you cannot remotely touch these containers, IE you cannot contract them to an alt from 10j away.
---
Look a bit more down. It's there. 😊
---
Hopelessly naive.
---
No im with you. But I mean that more people tend to generate more conflict. If all of NS was packed with people there would probably be more conflict in general.
---
My current workaround is: Ctrl + x, Ctrl + v in chat window, Ctrl + a, Ctrl + x.
---
Sad that we need a workaround.
---
&gt; now everyone looks at map flying on their mount seeing nothing from point a to point b and world overall is more like giant lobby between raids.
---
Replace "point" with "system" and "raids" with "ships to blow up" and you have eve.
---
That said, wow classic is actually *better* than modern wow if you want more of an mmo experience akin to what eve offers in terms of player interaction and skill.
---
In classic, you had to communicate with other players more and you had trips to dungeons that meant you were actually exploring the world rather than passing it by.  Classic was more about managing skill than items, since spell power increases were so rare, you had to focus on managing mana and aggro to control fights.  
---
You had to commit to your talents, because respecting got expensive.  You had to understand the market to make gold for that lvl 40 mount and work with others to set up building items that required other professions you lacked.  Things like fire resist for molten core came from enchanters, giving you more interaction with people.  Summoning (Cynoing) with Warlocks required you to reach out to others and ask for help.
---
The community was better in classic.  Skill mattered more.  The universe had to be explored.
---
Eve players should feel more comfortable there than the "modern" abomination, and it's not due to nostalgia alone.
---
I can definitely see what you're saying, but I don't think classic is gonna be this amazing event of the decade everyone else seems to. I just don't understand the hype, and I played from vanilla right through to BfA, with many many many breaks over those years of course. So many of my non-MMO playing friends are super hyped for what is essentially a rerelease of a 15 year old game because they seem to believe that it is gonna be the biggest thing in gaming, despite never having played warcraft titles AT ALL, and it just kinda makes me despair a little.
---
As for myself, I just refuse to give Blizzard a single penny ever again in my life. I've been having far more fun and finding hidden gems everywhere as a result.
---
Play from falcon to get supers and titans banned in lowsec by making us look bad ok
---
yeah lol if they wanted to "help" they'd use something as public as a titan km
---
granted I don't agree with GM's/devs giving free frags to people, but the notion that they're there to help x group is false
---
I'll be honest, when i read the thread title I thought it was a stainguy post
---
Infinite bumping was a stupid mechanic. You'll have to form quickly for those freighter kills now.
---
I cant believe they went and did the same thing to Panfam to help with the Tribute war..

---
The wildly successful private classic servers that were up and running for years that had to be issued cease and desist letters kinda proves otherwise.
---
Contrary to popular belief, graphics do not make a game otherwise Runescape would be dead.
---
Probably worth mentioning that if you pair a mwd with the cloak, you can activate both at the same time, then deactivate the cloak when the mwd cycle ends and be at the correct speed to immediately warp 
---
This works for all ships, with the exception of some capitals, and ships with sufficiently crappy grid that they can't fit the right size mwd for their mass like the bigger industrials

In the unlikely event that he should be ganked while obeying the Code, he could get reimbursed by James 315.

Well, if it was realistic there would be police waiting outside the cloning center for everyone who walked out with -5 or lower sec status.  Or they'd just destroy the clones in highsec of everyone with that status.
---
And the police would be *a lot* faster responding to "criminals" entering highsec.
---
And concord wouldn't stop at destroying your ship.
---
And a whole lot of other things to keep ganks from happening.  But then folks like CODE couldn't pretend they were elite.
---
Easy way to deal with this currently: set a password on the container. It wont let you repackage a passworded container.

Maybe future will say but I have to admit it can be and it's still a shame if it's this purpose

---
Always petition losses bois
---
I do agree but not all hunters are the same. No doubt the big fights create more actual destruction and thereby more need for PvE. At the same time the destruction in homeregions also serve that purpose and you have hunters that actually create damage on a large scale to serve that purpose as well.
---
I dont disagree with the general sentiment but I dont care about who destroys what in this particular instance. Im looking at destruction as a means of creating an economic balance. 
---
The blackout in my opinion has broken said balance causing the entire game to shit itself. And this has been done to appease a small portion of people who mainly focus on instant gratification at the expense of people who prefer long term aspects.
---
Charons are not jump freighters.
---
I never realized eve was actually full of casuals till this thread.
---
Vanilla WoW is fantastic if you nolife it to 60 in 10 days and start running dungeons with the decent players that have done the same. Done it on most private servers in the last few years and those weeks are seriously some of the most memorable moments I've had playing MMO's.
---
It will. They will have to reinitiate the warp which would count as a new warp resulting in the reset of the 3 minute timer.
---
Check out Empyrion Galactic survival on steam. A couple hundred active players between two main servers. The solar systems are cut in half, one for pvp the other pve. It feels a lot like rust, meets space engineers, meets eve. A lot of salt to harvest when people mine the materials for their ships and bases. An excellent time sink of a game. Something for everyone, Care Bears to the bloodthirsty.
---
From my experience I would say there just isn’t a game out there that actually meets your requirements. I have never played ED but from the gameplay I’ve seen it looks like an incomplete product.(same with other EVE-wannabes) 
---
I’ve played eve on and off for about 4-5 years. The problem is the time commitment to reward ratio. It’s truly a game that takes 10 hours of preparations for 30 mins of reaping that reward(if not less, situationally)
---
There is no protection for small players or groups, bottom line. There will always be mechanics that favor n+1. That being said, the game doesn’t bar you from doing anything the big groups can, but the second a larger entity comes by and wants to knock over your sand castle there’s really nothing you can do to stop it(other than “batphone” people which is n+1 reiterated)
---
I’ve always been a small scale player, never tried joining a large bloc so I can’t speak to that but it sounds like that’s what you’re trying to avoid so here’s my experience:
---
Most eve groups want some sort of scheduled play time out of you and some sort of commitment. Being that I played sporadically and traveled for work sporadically I decided to make 6 characters and live out of wormholes by myself because there’s a LITTLE protection from n+1 but it’s really just a false sense of security(see Rage eviction, 1 year of seeding btw). So the problem with even living out of a lower class WH by yourself(or 3 of you) is that you spend your time grinding out sweet WH isk which is pretty good money. Then you buy yourself a sweet POS or Astra to operate out of so it feels a little homey and you can store more than just a cargo hold worth of stuff. Cool! Now you guys have an operating base. Well let’s say life gets busy and you guys can’t make time to log in for a week. Wormholes while being safer from massive entities(not really) don’t have asset safety. So you’re either carting all your shit out of your hole regularly or you risk someone sneaking in and smashing your shit while you were busy with real life. If the timing is bad or you can’t get back to the game in time, your shit is surely gone! But let’s say the 3 of you notice it and can make the timers to defend your stuff, cool! Until you realize it’s a group of 15-20 dudes. Unless you all have 3-5 alts and great piloting skill or maybe some caps(big red target for bigger groups) good luck defending everything you put effort into farming and setting up. 
---
It got to the point where even making sweet C5 isk and living out of an Orca so no one could blow my shit up while I was away just wasn’t worth it. You have to invest major time or money up front to buy yourself some really nice ships and a really nice citadel for just one unlucky encounter with a bigger more persistent entity to lose it all.
---
Cue all the “ThaTS jUsT EvE” comments. It absolutely is and that’s why it’s not for me. If you like large coordinated groups and playing with other people every day that’s cool but some of us are anti social and don’t want to depend on others for success or develop internet trust issues.
---
That’s just my experience in EvE. I tried a few different play styles but it always came down to if another larger entity wants to ruin the way you play there’s literally nothing you can do, UNLESS you just abstain from certain parts of the game but then what’s the point.
---
E.G. I tried living out of high sec running missions when I was a new player. Sure you can store all your shit in a safe place where it can never be touched and you can for the most part avoid non-consensual PvP if you want to but really what’s the point. You don’t get to experience more than half the game that way and the isk you make is abysmal compared to being a part of a large null bloc. 
---
So IMHO the bottom line is if you’re trying to carve a path with just a couple friends it’s going to be A LOT of hard work and time investment with no GUARANTEED success. 
---
Just my $0.02
---
Hey guys he did the meme
---
Hey!
---
I did **all three** of the memes!
---
You bring the perhaps worst fighting ships in the game for a fight? Ships that pretty much only rely on stealth to hit and run things and will die if someone sneezes at them?
---
Na man.
---
If you have the chance to do Eve get togethers like that, just do it.  
---
Like going to any party that you don’t know anyone at, it’s a little off putting at first (for some people at least).  The nice thing about Eve get togethers are that you know everyone like Eve (probably).  Easy to chit chat with people.  Very low barrier to socialize.   
---
The best part is that you are in Vegas...if you can’t have a good time there you are doing it wrong.

First, it's been a LONG time since you had to be retarded to die in this game. As more and more of the...easily killed people have gotten fed up and quit, CCP has been making it progressively easier to kill people and lowering the bar as to what constitutes a fatal mistake. With no local and "no" cynos, it's getting to the point where it doesn't matter how smart you are, you're still going to die whenever some random chuckleheads decide they want a &lt;insert your shiptype here&gt; killmail. Pretty much everyone avoids risks that they have no other control over; taking your life into your own hands is one thing, playing Russian Roulette is another. Fighting for your country is an example of bravery, while deliberately charging into a minefield is an example of stupidity.
---
Second, if they were just moving to hisec, there wouldn't be much of a loss. The thing is, though, when you basically tell your customers "f\*ck you, we don't want your business anymore", they tend not to remain customers for long.
---
You guys don't need anyone to make you "look bad", you earned that by pulse and got that great reputation all on your own (seriously saying it as a compliment).
---
But man I hope you are right about CCP banning Supers from Lowsec, it would make things way more fun in my opinion.
---
&gt; Goons... are probably the most organized entity in the game.
---
I think this is basically *why* they get so much shit.
---
TFW when you see a post that is so fucking retarded that you just know it was made by a GOTG member before even checking the flair...
---
[deleted]
---
Are you for real? 
---
&gt; And don't say anyone had can come, someone who play eve online know that region is snuff backyard, help an eve online alliance undercover from  an event unbelievable... 
---
And the last public content fleets went directly into horde staging like the Nyx? welp fleet and nobody cared. And then one goes lowsec where everyone could have come and don't need to watch out for drag bubbles and shit and you are directly offended? lol
---
meh after 1-3 months of everyone grinding thier characters up to 60 peeps will get bored again and return home to eve... does not matter how many times you leave eve you always comeback.
---
This is literally what Christmas looks like.  Damn.
---
-&gt; ECM drones will fix that
---
Found Gevlon's reddit account.
---
2006 called, it wants its Goon talk points back.
---
"This will now put a maximum cap on how long a ship can be bumped or stuck on geometry."
---
boo. i guess freighter bowling will end now :(
---
If all you wanted to do was cloak off moons/icebelts/orebelts/anoms and hope content arrives that doesn't have a super cap umbrella... then maybe?
---
ah... so the locking down will reset the clock as they loose the warp... brilliant... ty kind goon sir.
---
nah because the issue isnt supers and titans its the fact that they made them massively cheap via stupid balances and then made them overpowered as fuck against subcaps along with capitals meaning sub fights got completely o7ed outta the game. CCP just keeps adding gimmicks instead of actually rebalancing stuff to encourage sub fights so we will forever be stuck in ferox eagle munnin online it seems.
---
Id honestly be completely fine if titans were nerfed massively against subs because i miss subs too and prefer if our retards actually died doing dumb stuff so they learn.
---
Maybe in 3 years but in the past 2 years nullsec has had nothing but nerfs.
---
They fired the guy that was doing it so there is that.
---
I prefer Madden 98 PlayStation sprites to any current gen Madden.
---
Fly a nano kitsune that does 5k cold and jams out to 150k.
---
It’s awesome for small gang
---
every 10 minutes?
---
At least your bitch ass can TRY to fight back, and the ECM pilots bitch ass can actually utilize his fucking bonii.
---
oh thats funny... of all the people to put on the wrong damage mods... olo
---
Next level BM - bot in your enemies region to get a free WH opened
---
i prefer an ewar that doesnt have a 30% chance to delete your ship
---
It's alot better than when it was 100%, newbro, and a hell of a lot better than the 0% were currently experiencing. Stay tuned.
---
I play eve because it's unique in its mechanics, not because it's an MMO
---
Wow.  That's disgusting.
---

Rorquals have no turret hardpoints therefore cannot fit any gas harvesters.
---
Well, he *was* paying attention to the launcher. It couldn't have been *too* absorbing.
---
So you protect bots. Okay.
---
Haha was meant to be sarcastic, obviously I could fly dreads or supers before titans
---
Thanks!
---
Good fight earlier!  I had just killed a super expensive Dramiel on the gate and didn't realize that the gates would keep shooting me until the Criminal timer ran out lmao.  Scrub mistake.  Thought if I warped off and back on it'd be fine.  I'll give you a better fight next time!
---
&gt; You'd think the empires would want major trade arteries to be protected...
---
the empires are at war, friend, they have been since the dominion expansion in 2009
---
We're switching this around so that without formatting will be the default. Thanks to everyone who's provided feedback on this!
---
Will CCP update this feature so that NCdot will be able to use it, too?
---
Just tried this out with a Hull tanked Hurricane spitting 752 DPS heated.  This is quite nice, thank you for the suggestion I'm practically melting everything lol
---
Oh and I used the MJD for the first time.  You weren't kidding, I think it's my new favorite module now too.  Gonna train that to V immediately
---
EvE is just masochism with extra steps, don't expect any QoL changes, you will just get a new agency window where you can't uncheck "show on login" and that would be it...
---
THE BOYSSSSS
---
Signaled this issues on eve forums, noone bat an eye. It's incredibly frustrating when u are constantly working with evepraisal and no option to turn it off.
---
Welcome to r/eve.
---
First of all, i cannot really talk for ED, since i never played it myself, therefor i try to give you an objective view about EVE trying to answering your questions with it.
---
1.) The game is obvious in space. No doubt about that, so you can't do anything wrong. EVE works on one server cluster, means almost everyone is playing on Tranquility, so you have impact on others, and others will eventually have impact on you in whatever way that might be. So playing EVE is not senseless, even though it can feel like it sometimes.
---
Before going into EVE itself for your other questions, what makes EVE very special is the community around it. Lets put it this way ... the moment you start playing EVE, you can see yourself as part of an extreme big family, as no matter how bad relations in game might be, we have alot of events all over the year, up to official DEV-supported meetups, that will have hundreds of players coming from all over the world to have fun together. Those events are a couple days pure fun, you learn alot about eve, about the players and you might not have that anywhere else. So at some point, besides the game itself, this might become something interesting for you. If you take part in one of those events, it will no matter what happened before, never let you leave this community again. So be careful if you choose the red or blue pill ;)
---
Allright now some basic answers about the game:
---
2.) The game is quality and has issues at the same time. The sheer complexity makes it almost impossible to adjust it for everyone, everywhere and for every possible thing that exists or can be done in this game. So the status quo is basically continues adjustment. Dependent on you, you will either have fun and accept changes here and there, even if they might have a drastic impact in your eve-based game play, or you might complain very often and still accept it silently. 
---
Every task, every item, everything basically has a meaning in eve and usually a purpose (at least for 95% of all the things, maybe even more). So whatever you learn, there are almost no moments where you see it as disappointing to put time or effort in, even if your game style might change over the time, but it makes you understand the game even better.
---
There are general basic things like "Exploration, Mining, PvE, PvP, Industrialism" to name like the biggest things. There are many more things, but even those big words, can be splitted into many smaller topics that describe more detailed what you might do in EVE. You might end up in specializing yourself in something, or you might cover a bigger variety of things, but everything you might do, results out of experience and learning, what is possible in the game.
---
3.) It is OK if you are offline for some hours, days, weeks, months, or years. I mean nobody knows what CCP has planned and might happen in 3 years, but so far we have alot of people that take breaks from some days, up to several years and come back to find their majority of things where they left them. It helps here already to have some basic knowledge about where you can drop things, where it is safe, but to answer your question a bit simpler, right now most people didn't have a disadvantage in not beeing online for smaller or longer periods of time. When taking a break for months or years, you only might lack in knowledge about what is new and maybe some experience that you forgot how things work.
---
The thing about responsiblity or work. All that is up to you, you can be the laziest guy swimming with others, up to the most busy guy leading hundreds of people in corps, alliances or even coalitions. There is nothing impossible in EVE, you can do whatever you want, there are almost no rules. So work is more a definition you have to do yourself.
---
4.) You can do alot of meaningful things. The most meaningful will eventually be making contacts in EVE. From there whatever you do might have impact on your contacts, their m8s and corps/alliances and so on. You might become eve famous by doing something outstanding. There are no limits but yourself. People that have played for many years might have an advantage in terms of having the opportunity to archive some things, you might not be the first anymore, but there are probably millions of things, that are possible and interesting enough to make an impact to alot of people that we haven't thought of yet. 
---
You can do many things solo, you can do many things with 2-3 and you can do many things with hundrets of people. It would go too deep to describe examples, but as a light example, PvP can be fun in small gangs, with your group of three, people could fill specific roles and ships to make it a good comp. All that is possible with 2-3 people the same as with 50 people. Just on a smaller scale. The move from small to big can be really fast and can feel like you must be involved in bigger alliances somehow. I can't deny, there are some things, that will certainly be easier by beeing part of a 500 man alliances, rather trying it with 3 people, but there are so many things you can do, else, it would be sad if everything in this game could be done with 3 people. :)
---
5.) Industry and Exploration as same as market-tasks can be for example solo, but collectively connected things. One explores materials, one does do the invention and building, one is doing the selling and buying of missing things. That was really just a quick example to show a logic connection. But in general tons of things, can be done alone, but indirectly be part of much greater complex things. The biggest things, usually involves the doings of independent people, that do tasks, that without it would not work. And that goes again for everything in EVE.
---
6.) You can learn something new everyday. If you feel you wanna do something else, you won't get punished. Your skills won't be lost, your experience might be helpful in your new tasks. See it comparable with your real life. Whatever you do, usually gives you something in experience, that adds to the new things you are doing. Same in EVE.
---
7.) Well here comes the fee thing. Well yes EVE is based on a monthly fee, if you wanna experience the full EVE package. There are so-called alpha toons, that let you do a lot of things, just not everything in perfection. That monthly fee can be paid out of ingame activities by making ISK and buying PLEX (ingame item where 500 = 30 day game time). And lets put it this way ... you wanna play free with full experience, find something ingame that is fun for you and might give you money as tell to do so. But your goal shouldn't be that. I suck to really give you a good picture here ... because i can understand all the sites, as they are usually reasonable. So alot of people pay, because they can, some don't and stay alpha and some grind and can afford to play for free ... and grinding is something to be used with care ... what looks like grind for one, might be super fun activity for someone else.
---
EVE is ... well a game and kinda a life decision :D One time dragged in, you will never leave again, because no matter how long your break in the future might be, nobody leaves forever. 
---
Hope it helped at least a bit. :)
---
I love vanilla wow but the magic is gone, and I don't have hours to grind to 60. Also I hate blizzard and their ban hammer happy mods.
---
Plus they're late. Nostalrius already happened and everyone who wanted to play vanilla did so there.
---
Also, sharding? Layering?
---
ONE SERVER ONE ROAD
---
CHINAH NUMBA WAHN
---
If playing WoW Classic lets me be 21 again and raid 18 hours a week Ill see you there. Those raid GY run backs are brutal though.
---
Too real
---
When you still claim relevance in 2019 LULW
---
It does wear off for sure. I never really enjoyed WoW back in its old days becuase I was playing a mmorpg with a much better pvp experience, Dark Age of Camelot....Man I loved that game, it kept me from really getting into WoW due to my personal experiences being far superior. WoW is kind of like the Fortnite of our generation, lots of people experienced their first mmo/gaming experience there. For me it was DAoC. And every few years a DAoC freeshard with a classic ruleset will launch, and when they do, the population on the server is higher for the first couple months then it ever was on live....but then 6+ months down the road it dwindles. It will happen with WoW, you'll see 10000 player queues for a bit but after a few months you'll have to merge servers together, you can tell that blizzard is pretty hesitant in adding new servers, they know this is true.
---
Im throwing a roam around lowsec every damn days, join us so you can have some small gang fleet actions ! Dont worry about ships, we got you covered ! &lt;3 ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
---
Warp disruption cancels your warp.  That's not an assumption.
---
The timer is based on your warp.  When you have to hit warp again, because your prior warp got canceled, a timer will be upset.
---
It's not rocket surgery, friend, it's just application of two separate game mechanics to the logical outcome.
---
Something tells me TiDi will not affect that 3 minute timer, so you will be essentially immune to points in huge engagements where u are not in a bubble...
---
Yeah exactly get rekt fucktards, easy reimbursement
---
&gt; The blackout in my opinion has broken said balance causing the entire  game to shit itself. And this has been done to appease a small portion  of people who mainly focus on instant gratification at the expense of  people who prefer long term aspects. 
---
I kind of got the impression that this "age of chaos" mess was designed to generate a short-term increase in player count and activity, long term consequences be damned. 
---
Give that vocal minority what it's been demanding for so long, and you're virtually guaranteed to make them happy for at least a short time. You might piss off more people than you make happy, but people will most likely try to adapt or wait it out rather immediately quitting (remember how quick they were to clarify that the blackout wasn't necessarily going to be PERMANENT, after one of their "in-character" news articles implied it would?). Then there's the fact that new subs are instant income while people quitting don't get their subscription fees or plex back (and they just did an incentive to sub for three months at a time), so the blackout stunt is virtually guaranteed to make CCP and Hilmar look good in the short term.
---
Is Hilmar planning to retire soon, or is CCP being sold again? That would explain why they seem to be going all-in on short term performance with no apparent cares for the future of the game.
---
Also: 
---
It's not just when you're being bumped.
---
It's also when you're hung up on geometry. Like an acceleration gate, or asteroid, or whatever.
---
^^
---
Game working as intended, how horrible.
---
If only we could subsist off the r64 moons in hisec and faction sites so the dirty nullsec evils couldnt profit by bringing them to hisec.
---
And blue loot is fine.
---
Huh, so that's what eve non-potato mode looks like.
---
Everyone talking about time commitment and schedules is part of a massive alliance where they are just LineMember#52517... there is MUCH more to EVE than that.
---
Others have talked about the cons of ED, so let me tell you the pros of EVE from my point of view: the game is a really complex and everchanging sandbox, which can be really brutal but that makes you accomplishments much more meaningful. You can choose to be whatever you want to be in space, from a trader to a space emperor and everything in between, with little to no restrictions other than the interaction with other players.
---
You train skills over time, so being away from the game won't hamper anyone's progression in that sense. The grind is to obtain money or resources, so it is directly tied to what, how and where you want to do whatever it is you want to do... and those objectives won't even be definitive, they will change over time and be modified by circunstances way beyond what you can forsee.
---
The monthly subscription is what I would recommend if you guys decide to commit, but considering the "free version" is generally viewed as a really extended trial you won't lose anything by trying.
---
I'd recommen reading this (I'll edit with a link) to get a better picture of what this game is.
---
Yes. They said in the naming post yesterday that they were moving HQ. Hence the contest to name conference rooms.
---
Empires don't like massing military near their borders because it might piss off the adjacent empire who may think it's preparation for invasion.
---
Yeah, this is being mis-interpreted by many to be a nerf to high-sec freighter ganking.  It's only a nerf to solo ransom bumpers, and maybe a mild annoyance to ganking.
---
It's actually a big fix to any class of ship which gets stuck on a structure, and in particular, capitals.
---
I am sure the security team would love the deluge of useless data this would provide as a self-appointed bot posse ran around pinging every ratter, miner, and mission runner logged in over and over again every single day.
---
As for botting being obvious, have you ever mined or ratted?  The reason those tasks get botted is that they are nothing but repeated patterns of activity.  I am sure anybody coding a bot would put in small behavior variations and delays just to keep the timing from being too precise.
---
What isk/hour are you seeing?
---
No longer assuming :) correct.
---
Better than a Low Grade Newman
---
I have mined 7years non stop between blah and blah, doesn’t mean I’m a bot. I don’t even accept convos if it’s not on my main character, so can’t even say I’m a bot because I don’t respond. If ccp looked into it they would see I’m chatting with others. Just because someone is doing the same thing/same time doesn’t mean they are botting.
---
World of Tanks did a server rollback to 0.7.0 for April fool's, and it had 100kish players dunking each regional server.  The graphics were shit, the physics didn't exist, and the game was unbalanced, but it had the old gameplay that got us hooked.  I played it and loved it, then went back to current WoT and realized how much they had fucked up.  It's not the QoL changes we hate, it's not the graphics upgrades, it's the power creep and casualization that drove a lot of us from WoW.  I came to EvE because us griefers and fun lovers couldn't play in WoW like we used to.  In EvE I can, and was rewarded for doing so.
---
What changes are they making to JF’s? (I quit years ago)
---
ED is as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle.
---
JFs can jump to covert cynos.  So people hunting JFs won't have a warpable cyno to find them.
---
hehe gz
---
I don't recommend mining or trading.  Check out exploration and PVP.  If you absolutely have your heart set on mining just don't think that's all the game has for you when you start to burn out.
---
Man that shit would’ve helped when I was running from system to system doing reaction chains!
---
Paid by Steve
---
What's the point of those bonuses then? The only 2 ship types that can use a normal cyno have a 50% duration reduction bonus... such changes, much sense, wow!
---
What's the point of those cyno duration bonuses then? The only 2 ship types that can fit a normal cyno have a 50% duration reduction bonus... such changes, much sense, wow! Is changing the module itself too hard or something? Or is this some big brain move by CCP to make it look like they are doing shit?
---
This dummy argued on mumble that he didn’t do anything wrong for like 15minutes after he died. Holy shit.
---
It almost died before they started putting out new or rereleased content 
---
(https://m.imgur.com/parrLyh this is a good visual graph with the player count and big updates)
---
*cough* Homeworld *cough*
---
good luck with that.
---
Snuff is the new PL?
---
Ok thanks
---
&lt;3 you’re the best, thank you!
---
"well that's not supposed to happen!"
---
&gt; It's only a nerf to solo ransom bumpers, and maybe a mild annoyance to ganking.
---
Well one exception is during a major gank event like Burn Jita, you might have several hunters in Machs keeping freighters from aligning for way longer than 3 minutes.
---
Just don't think of 60 as the goal, the game starts at level 1. It's like saying all of Eve sucks because it takes months to get into a titan. The titan is no more the start of the game than level 60 is.
---
Yes, what I mean is that processing of data is executed by the server. You can't transfer graphics over the Internet.
---
Or just play both, don't be a casual.
---
Compact Damage Controls have always been high because they have lighter fitting than any other DC. They've never been a good choice for a cheap frigate fit.
---
&gt; Some wormholes have sound disabled
---
CHAOS!
---
I mean that's how often it cycles
---
So how does one person gank with that many Talos? If you're not input broadcasting how can you click fast enough to actually pop something? That KM looks like at least 8 of them are one person.
---
Actually wondering, I've never ganked stuff.
---
unless it's 10%tidi like in every other mayor titan fight
---
Huh, looks like you haven't played since 2016 (at least). Titans are now great for fighting everything that's not an ab frigate and DDs got cut in half. They are still expensive but even the price has been nearly cut in half.
---
It's just a bita fun :D
---
I remember when ECM was still relevant and usefull , and using them on my Widow in my blops gang , it was really dank 
---
Can save your ass and your friendship , aswell messing around with anything that was daring to lock anyone 
---
But now ... with the revamp ... there is NO WAY i could use my Widow as I was before , completely useless 
---
Maybe , maybe , maybe ! Something with ECM Burst could works with it (if I read correctly the bonuses) but I don’t know ...
---
Lol no
---
Eve is definitely much more of a 'project game' thant ED. ED is very shallow, EVE you can set yourselves goals that might take months, or years to accomplish.  
---
3 friends could try and take over a small pocket of lowsec, or live in a lowclass wormhole and learn the game in the deep end, or join a small sov alliance and learn ropes of nullsec, or join the blob together and fight in large fleet battles.
---
then there will be nothing stopping snuff from just swinging its dread dick around
---
I do not think this is legit.  My RTX 2080 Super card and my Titan XP card show no difference in the game when both set to max graphics.  I do not think RTX is supported by EVE.
---
Il take the original tecmo bowl over any madden game
---
Burn Jita features, typically at least, Goons encouraging any and all players to join in, up to and including making new specific alpha alts for the job.
---
During lower player count number time zones, they may not have enough players to do it, but during your normal player hours, they'll just have squads of suicide tacklers to tackle a bumped freighter every few minutes and reset the clock.
---
That's more of a decrease in everyone else's resting and not do much an increase for Goons. I'm betting it's less for everyone over all but impacts you all the least
---
The whole council on vacation huh? Nothing to see here.
---
Because **CHAOS!**
---
MinMaxing the average IQ of both games i see! lol
---
Just have a NS static to the most NPC kills/hr
---
congratulation, now keep the bees away ;)
---
The only thing on grid with a shorter life expectancy than a Falcon is a Sabre, because of how damaging a Falcon can be to an enemy gang. Land a jam on the logi, their people start dying; land a jam on a Triglavian or a Neutralizer ship, and suddenly your people start living; land a jam on some tackle ships and suddenly your buddy who got scrammed warps out at 20% Structure \[Souce: Was the buddy at 20% Structure once\].
---
The Kitsune and Falcon (and Rook) are rare ships to see, partly because of their short life expectancy, partly because so few people want to fly them. But they're very efficient ships in that one pilot with solid ECM skills can disrupt or outright disable 2-5 enemy ships *alone*. You won't be getting dAnk FrAgS yourself, but oh man the enemy will hate having you around. You will however need to learn to dodge. A lot.
---
Scorpions and Jamgus are seen a little bit; however Scorpions are often seen as too big of an investment for not enough payoff (big slow ship, big target, but not very durable), and Jamgus are only really used in high-class Wormhole armor brawls. (They can at least have *some* armor on them, but they still feel awkward.)
---
calculation on where on the model the animation hit is an insanely lighter local load when compared to the graphics (which are also local). There is no comparison when looking at whether this is local vs server side. server side resources would be a complete waste on such a calculation and the user would have to wait for a response to know where to show the graphic, which in turn would have to be called ahead of time in order to match graphic with actual damage applied. as a result id bet my right pinky the weapons spread is a local calc.
---
&gt; The Replay button for active or completed tutorial steps has been removed.
---
I guess CCP caught on to what I was doing for all my alpha alts during the skilling spree event
---
12 bil cerbs with random overpriced commodity items.
---
It's not tho
---
Yet still plays EVE, completely zoomed out, staring at nothing but a grid, two brackets, and a list of text so you can ~~read~~  see what's on grid.
---
Does no one see the irony in this. We're all still playing EVE.
---
For who ?
---
CONCORD isn't what I'd call an empire military, and IIRC a system's security rating is based on CONCORD presence. Villore is the capital of the Gallente Federation and it only has a 0.5 security rating.
---
Protection use to be neut logi. They would rep the freight that was getting ganks. Goons CSM members meta that shit out tho. GG counter ganking GG.
---
I dont agree with the bumping change
---
Us, poking the biggest group ingame and creating dank \[terrible\] propanda gifs is funny
---
I do not remember having read anything about ray tracing in patch notes...
---
neither does RTX provide any content nor does it improve your frame rate. It looks astonishing when implemented, however it takes a lot of time to code it in and the graphic cards barely keep up atm.
---
Instead I'm looking forward for game content. Besides never change a running system, especially if not broken.
---
Assuming your numbers are correct (it’s been years since I ran Incursions in high sec) and you are assuming only one alt is running incursions at a time, I don’t think it will be too hard to make null sec more attractive than that.
---
What I cannot do in USTZ under the Blackout is triple box Rorquals for hours on end while I roam on an alt, run Black Ops, or gate camp on another account. Hell, in Querious, it was so safe that I was Boson ratting on one account while running three Rorquals and a Hulk (Mercoxit) on the other four. While it was very intensive, I was easily clearing 900m-1b per hour. I didn’t do that very often because there is more to Eve than PVE. But that was right around an average of 200m/hour per account. I’m glad it’s no longer safe enough to do that. I’d love to see a null sec where income didn’t scale very well with more alts, but it was possible to get more ISK/hour than high or low sec.
---
As a result of the Wetu nerf, Rorqual nerfs, and Blackout, I’ve had to stop doing some of the most lucrative null sec content during USTZ, but as an experienced player willing to take some risks, I’m still making good ISK whenever I want to PVE. And the hunting style of PvP I love has been so much better.
---
Ah yes, the Blue loot problem. giving guaranteed ISK for killing rats in no-local space is wrong. Shit, isn’t that what they’re doing in null?
---
Except our ships can be killed in 3 seconds, we can be attacked at any time from anyone from anywhere, and we have no supercapital fleet to back us up (not that it would be able to in time). Did I mention that our ships cost much more than carriers? And we do actually have to haul our loot to high arc, instead of conveniently receiving Isk every 20 minutes.
---
Really? I thought that was the name for what corps/alliances like P I R A T do; declare war on everyone in the cluster so they can shoot people without getting CONCORDOKKEN'd?
---
No, that's just potato mode vs actual quality graphics.
---
The new bounce mechanic also helps with capital move-ops when your Titan keeps bouncing off stupid faxes that don’t align
---
&gt; so its even worse then, just one group will have access to it at all times if it comes to it. 
---
One group a *a time -* and really, it's probably never going to be built, so the main concern with it is giving people incentive to build it. Allowing it to keep a functionality it already had seems a reasonable way to do that. Plus, even if one WAS built and somehow survived long enough to go online and store supers, it would die as soon as timers allowed, severely limiting the usefulness of storing ships in it.
---
It doesn't really matter though; like you said it's a meme structure and will never be built unless CCP decides that EVE desperately needs some quick publicity.
---
&gt; the end results are literally the same, people actually risking their  shit will get punished with an arbitrary cooldown and those that aren't  get no drawbacks 
---
No, they are not the same.
---
You paid an opportunity cost for the SP you lost when dying in a T3C. A person who flies and loses a T3C is subsequently at a disadvantage compared to someone who didn't risk and lose a T3C.
---
A person who risks and loses a super, with that change I proposed, would not be at a meaningful disadvantage compared to someone who did not risk or lose a super (I mean, aside from the massive amount of ISK lost and red killboard numbers). 
---
You wouldn't be able to fly another super for a certain period of time, but people who aren't willing to risk a super "can't" do that anyways - would you say that a character who does industry is at a disadvantage compared to one who doesn't, due to the fact that the industrialist's manufacturing slots are used up while the non-industrialist's aren't?
---
At very low SP values, you could argue that having a large portion of a character's SP tied up in a ship that he's temporarily unable to fly is a disadvantage...but we're talking about supercapitals here.
---
Finally..."arbitrary" cooldown? Really? Have you not logged onto EVE or looked at this subreddit in the past few years?
---
This would definitely make rolling for content a bit less tedious.
---
its weird aint it.......
---
If you can't get a scram on him in three minutes, or your Catalysts in place, maybe you don't deserve to kill it.

Lol you joke but CCP is not the only company that has entire departments take leave around the same time of year. It’s called “holiday season” for a reason.
---
I don’t get it ;(

---
That's not even ray-tracing. That's just standard PBR. Implementing ray-tracing into EVE would likely require rewriting the graphics engine from the ground up.
---
You just took a screenshot with all settings turned down and then another at max settings.
---
&gt; And the police would be a lot faster responding to "criminals" entering highsec.
---
Criminals probably wouldn't be able to enter hisec *period*, nor would people branded enemies of an empire be able to enter that empire's space. Remember that it's possible to lock someone out of jumping through a stargate, [like what the Intaki did back in 2010](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/federal-navy-turned-back-at-intaki-stargate/).
---
&gt; And a whole lot of other things to keep ganks from happening. But then folks like CODE couldn't pretend they were elite.
---
Since CODE's founder explicitly mentions bots and AFK players as the reason he founded it in the first place, they probably wouldn't *exist* in the first place.
---
Are you autistic? its clearly a meme
---
Would've been nice trying to loot that back when freighters weren't able to loot things in space. Although of course I don't know what they ended up looting that thing with.
---
I haven’t been in BJ since idk like 2015 or 2016, but back then we’d have one or two main fleets and several groups of bumpers, and they for sure held targets down for extended period of times, while the main fleets cycled kills and timers.
---
it's not like snuff can't handle those losses... and they also do what they want no need to help like they are kids ands they didn't know what they were doing ....;
---
I don't remember CONCORD declaring for any empire, and IIRC a system's security rating is based on CONCORD presence. Villore is the capital of the Gallente Federation and it only has a 0.5 security rating, so it's clearly not a matter of Empire military presence that determines it.
---
I am a little sad i cant play w cross realm buddies but i understand it, hope yall have fun!
---
Yeah, but it looked like a storyline module when I glanced at the kill. My mistake.

So mach bombing with a team of 5 corvettes to just point the freighter every 3 minutes until gank fleet shows up. That's kinda dumb but okay
---
I mean you sound austistic... Its obviously potato mode
---
did the people get thei ships reimburse back then ? If yes it's the same problem
---
This guy hasn't fought blokis before I see :)
---
Honestly? no. It's cosmetic. I literally couldn't give a shit about a cosmetic. Also, it was added years ago and they clearly haven't acted on monetizing limited skins. Even if they had, I just wouldn't buy them. If some dipshit wants to spend money on a skin that's not even permanent then that's their issue.
---
They're also less powerful than a relic or data analyzer module would be in the same role. It's generally a better idea to use a Heron or Astero and not bother with the integrated analyzers since you have plenty of mid slots.
---
Do Low-grade kramers do more dps vs. dark coloured ships :thinking:
---
If they tried thinking a little outside of the box a little instead of smacking everything with a hammer. Change the whole PvE system. They want nullbears to have to work together to make money but all the PvE content is solo content. Turn null into Jspace without the benefits of Jspace. You want a very basic idea? Bring the value of anoms way down. Enough so that solo pilots can still farm them for escalations and run those for decent profit. Introduce a structure or something that in cycles just like moon mining it seeks out pirate outposts or so. Really good ISK, low comparative time investment, and can be made to be gang level content. Kind of like moon mining. Somewhat like running Sleeper sites. You could probably still run a bot through these but they aren't infinitely farmable and gives nullbears some actually engaging content that's suitable for Blackout. There's probably a hundred other things they could do I'd never think of but it just seems like they either aren't trying or they aren't being honest about their intentions.
---
I’m actually now leaning towards exploring/scavenging 
---
I don’t want to pvp until I learn some basics or like am some what competent in what I’m doing? Granted I’m pretty sure I can’t avoid dying.
---
So i've just come back after 2 years, gave my main away who was SP stripped so all I have is my 20m SP alt who has mainly dread skills so im working slowly on extracting them and putting them towards ships and guns skills as I get money
---
I want to join a WH corp but I can't really join any as, I can't even fly a t2 fit frig atm. Other than null where is the best place for pvp content as I get my skills up? The thought of going to null makes me sick and FW seems dead
---
Is piracy the only option?
---
60 mil on conract my man...got at least 15 more for you to buy and welp
---
This seems to be going way over your head. If their intent becomes to strong arm you into giving up more money and it doesn't work. Then they will try again and find something that will. Or at least something that you do care about. Like day one super capital injection. How'd that work out huh.
---
Yep. Playing since 04. Unless it happens on a weekend, if you live in the USA you are fucked out of pretty much any event by default. 
---
If you're going to have a public spectacle execution, the least you could do is have it on a Saturday or Sunday.
---
I would recommend waiting for the game “Starbase” it has pretty much everything you want except point 2). It is still in development and has not been released yet. 
---
Would not recommend EVE as there is not much you can get done with new accounts and 4 people without spending months grinding skill points or spending money to buy them. Ether way, you are spending money. 
---
ED is fun in a small group but as everyone else has said, there is not much to work towards. There is little persistence in the world and progress is driven by personal goals. This might change in the future as they add more player run mechanics but that is the future.
---
I would still recommend waiting for Starbase.
---
Even though this is a joke I would be interested in seeing how EvE would look like if it actually had Raytracing.
---
Are you dense?

Wait, there is something like that now?

Not in the game engine, but it's an applicable term for corps/alliances like CODE whose whole schtick is committing criminal acts in high-security space.

How will large nullblocs people just store things in npc structures instead? That would cause logistical nightmares for them. Also if youre storing a bunch of shit in a citadel and cant be arrssed to fuel it..thats your problem and fault then if it blows up and you lose it
---
Get rid of for T3C SP loss and you would be correct.
---
Someone posted a video of it higher up in the thread, they scooped it with a Fenrir
---
First if all, I don't play like that most of the time, almost never in fact; and besides that I dislike "childish" graphics on games, I prefer more realistic designs.
---
Since when could players affect a system's security ratings like that? I don't think that's possible, do you have a source?
---
Yeah.  The change is more geared towards ships (and in particular capitals) which can get stuck permanently on structures, like asteroids, warp acceleration gates, etc.  For those instances, it's a great change.
---
It puts a damper on solo ransom bumping, and it adds changes to how suicide ganking will happen, with some additional complications.  However, for people like J Kusion, who frequently do not utilize bumping at all in order to accomplish a steady stream of ganks, then I think it won't change very much.
---
I'll take your word for it.
---
That would make them too op, you would need to make them a lot more expensive
---
And it only took about 12 people in CBC's
---
To add on what /u/Valiran9 said, CONCORD is effectively both a massive police force designed to keep non-empire eggers in check, and the equivalent of a UN peacekeeping force for the empires. And much like the real life UN, CONCORD doesn't have nearly enough power to keep the empires in check: Case in point, during the lead up to Empyrean Age, a joint rogue Elder-Thukker Tribe fleet managed to beat CONCORD so badly that they effectively lost both a fleet and a station. This is why one of the CONCORD stations in Yulai is broken.
---
Can you tell if people are docked at a citadel in a wormhole? How...
---
I wasn't joking...
---
oh god ew this is the first time opening a amp reddit link
---
so....CCP is giving people free reinbursed titan hulls for losses?
---
doesn't that kinda fly in the face of their own statement they want to lower the proliferation of supers?
---
or am i missing something
---
I have not tested it myself yet, but I took a quick look at the change and as far as I can see it should correctly use time dilation.
---
holy fuck the camera shake...
---
Ah yeah, looks like shit. I’ve kissed it and made it better
---
I mean we have fuck all gun crime compared to the US. Significantly fewer murders in general. 
---
Remind me of our last mass shooting. And compare that to yours.
---
Eve is a very clientside heavy game. the server just relays actions and applies initial states as error checking. This is very evident with the double-click in space to re-align and everything being menus. Also, very evident as I know my carrier is about to warp when it's suddenly aligned to my target. If eve isn't designed like this, it's just being plain inefficient. CCplz
---
The SP mechanic just seems inexplicable and does not stop anyone that I know from flying them.  It just makes some people more risk intolerant.  A well fit T3C is plenty expensive as it stands now.  Either way, adding the same SP loss to a skill that takes months to train would be pretty punitive in my view.
---
&gt;How will large nullblocs people just store things in npc structures instead? That would cause logistical nightmares for them. 
---
lol, no it wont and hasnt in the past.  
---
&gt; Also if youre storing a bunch of shit in a citadel and cant be arrssed to fuel it..thats your problem and fault then if it blows up and you lose it 
---
No it isnt if RL comes calling.  RL takes precedence always.
---
While I wish it were possible to affect system security rating I was more talking as an in-lore thing, because there is more destruction it only makes sense that it has a lower rating. And also to troll CODE. haters.
---
ECM pilot here. ECM is still golden. Some ships like Widow etc have small range bonuses. But otherwise, I still see it as effective. Even in the ECM Tengu.

TLDR BB wants more content.
---
Burners and carrier l5 missions will make a lot more per hour than your rorq with limited time. C5 dual rattle farming is also profitable if you can get set up in a hole and know what you're doing.
---
Yeah..so basically they are using pods to check dscan / grid ...if something on grid / discan bot resets and dock up. 
---
In Cache there are some systems in south cache where they are keeping pods oribiting the gates just to check gate activity.

Also true. I know that we didnt distrupt their economy and those miners are already replaced but it was fun and relaxing. We manage to get a rook and we almost had an occator. Next time :)))
---
Correlation =/= causation. The UK is more ethnically and culturally homogeneous than the US, has fewer drug users, and lacks a lot of the social frictions that cause violent crime in the US (the *vast* majority of which is gang-related, ie. criminals shooting criminals). If guns were the problem then why has US violent crime consistently decreased every single year for almost the last two decades while our rate of gun ownership has steadily increased over the same period?         
---
And taking away guns isn't going to solve anything. All of the draconian gun measures in Australia (or hell, our 10 most violent cities, which make up 80% of our violent crimes, underlying that this isn't a general issue and is entirely an issue isolated almost entirely in a handful of areas) did nothing to reduce the number of violent crimes committed by any significant amount.          
---
I'm glad your country seems to be doing fine, but the solutions that work in your country won't work in mine, and vice versa. I wouldn't impose my solutions on you, and I expect you to refrain from doing so for me.
---
And also in solidarity with our fellow pilots who tried buying it up in abundance on the way down. May their wallets go easy into the eternal night.
---
Speaking for Eve only:
---
Try it as an Alpha (the free-to-play level) account.  There's enough complexity to keep you busy for a long enough time to make a good judgement on whether or not you'd like to either a) spend the necessary grind time to use in-game currency to upgrade to Omega, b) spend RealLife coin for Omega, or c) not bother at all and just play as Alpha.  And there's always option d) ya totally hate it, uninstall, thus "winning" at Eve, and losing not a damn thing.
---
I'm not renewing my subs as they expire.  It is REALLY bad out where I am....  like 90% reduction in activity overall.  Personally I only get on to PvP on the accounts that are still active.  No money making whatesoever - not even motivated to re-start my PI.
---
Bright side is that I am saving money too.
---
Looks like all relic/data analyzers can't auto repeat now?
---
I personally... dude ... really have shitposting standards fallen this low? where da fuck is stainguy?
---
Yeah, no.
---
Gun laws have a direct correlation to gun crime, and being naïve won't change that.
---
when you are on grid with the citadel and select it there is a number in those \[ \] brackets after the name of the citadel. The number in there represents the docked people
---
Accidentally the economy
---
ED is a good game but not for what you're looking for. Eve is also a good game but not quite what you're looking for. Where ED is very chill it's not very team friendly. You fly together (sort of) but that's about it. ED shines as a solo space flying sim. Eve on the other hand is completely social and can feel like a job some times. I liken Eve to more of a top-down RPG set in space then a space sim. Both are fun but completely different and not very comparable. 
---
Source: I own both and play both.
---
Make new module or ship made out of PURE ISOGEN
---
No, fuck that. They should get negative resists against drifters even.
---
He respawns in his keepstar with his insurance, and has 1 trit 8m his avatar hold
---
Just to clarify, the ship that died is a 'super-carrier', the second-largest (and most expensive) ship class in the game. 
---
They are very dangerous to move around on their own, so people sometimes do it just as down-time is about to hit. That way, even if they get attacked, they might hold out for a few seconds until the server shuts down. Unfortunately, this guy got hit with a competend group of hunters, and had no tank modules equipped either, so even that didn't save him. A Nyx is worth 15b ISK according to z-kill: https://zkillboard.com/kill/78548869/
---
How do they work? Just fire? No target lock? 
---
Is anything not in fleet a foe?
---
No he's correct, you're being unnecessarily pedantic.
---
so you want CCP to punish people proactively for playing within the games rules? i hope you realize how stupid that sounds
---
When I click the nergal links in the doc, I get a blank screen?

Parts of this are hilariously wrong. Vanilla BARELY rated the term mechanics in its raids. Skill hardly mattered you just drowned the bosses in bodies and they would eventually die. Modern raids make vanilla raids look like hello kitty play land. 
---
The community did have to socialize more and things you did as an individual would build reputation for yourself which is cool. But vanilla was not in any way shape or form better than retail. 
---
If you take out lfr amd lfg in retail and cross realm raiding. Boom you have everything everyone misses about classic.
---
Ooooohhhhhh

---
The MER is intel, to think any different is dumb.
---
My understanding is that there's not a lot of stuff that uses it in bulk, but tons of it comes from hardcore spodbraining
---
Nah that was what we used to call wardeccing everyone in sight in highsec, and *some* people thought it was problematic and needed to be "fixed".
---
Nowadays you can only wardec corps that own structures. I suppose you could call wardeccing all the structure owners in a locality "blanket decs", but literally nobody thinks that this sort of thing is a problem.

Thanks for the advice. I don't know why I hadn't thought of it but yeah I should find people to work with. Where I live most people like pwning asteroids, I guess that's why I wasn't thinking of forming a team. 
---
You really piqued my interest, I want to start setting strategies, traps, whatever. I was getting close to giving up.
---
The idea behind all of this (Blackout and cyno changes) is clearly to end super-ratting and the mining counterpart to that, rorq mining.
---
Instead of just swinging the idiot-club and making all of those ships next to useless in a pve role, make them more accessible to all players. cut down the resource and time requirements to have them built by 50-75%. Don't kill off the end-game content, make it more attainable and more available. 
---
Give all supers a beacon that can be seen by all players on the map when they are in space, piloted or not... just like you can look for DED stations, etc.
---
Now, bring highsec into AT LEAST the carrier and dread realm. It's long overdue.
---
Where the fuck did you people get this idea that their goal was to screw over the big guy? 
---
They've said that their goal is to make the ENDGAME harder, regardless of organizational size.
---
Ah, i cant speak for insmother but they cant really do much in deteroid, their home
---
&gt;Yes it is. If guy who wants to shoot another guy can't get a gun, he has to rethink his plan.
---
Yeah, he just gets a knife and does it. London has proved that sufficiently as of late, it has a higher violent crime rate than NYC.
---
Or just a depot and refit pretty quick.
---
If there is a surplus, the issue isn’t the source 
---
It’s the sink
---
So, for an offline lurker since several years ago, what’s the change?
---
another problem is the structures in 0.5 system with ls/ns minerals
---
Right, I missed the part where he said fitted.
---
&gt;things only drop from structures if they're currently in-progress industry jobs, in which case they drop as the materials, not the end results.
---
I believe this took into account builds that were complete but not yet delivered. In that case an unassembled ship would drop. Previously there was no way to collect capitals and supers. About a year ago they changed that in a patch.
---
Unfortunately I can't get to zkill on this machine to find the example.
---
none of the loot should drop, like, who cares if people pad their killboards on ccp ships, but the loot/fittings shouldnt drop
---
It is. but based off the 'adjusted cost' or the ME 0 materials. 
---
Which can be quite different.
---
&gt;Yeah, he just gets a knife and does it. London has proved that sufficiently as of late, it has a higher violent crime rate than NYC.
---
This ws literally for a single month cause you all were snowed in lmao.
---
Check your facts mate.
---
So I found a WH, checked the class and it was 5. scanned down 2x relic III. both had sleepers, pulled the sleepers out of the site. hacked both. both sites gave me about 8 mil of super heavy shit. is that normal? I mean in the not so big amount of isk and the weight. I was kind of expecting to do those two sites and be set for life.. are wormhole relic sites really not so lucrative as people claim they are?
---
don't you know that the only pvp in highsec is bumping freighters for 30 minutes?
---
shut the fuck up
---
Don't leave me hanging.... What happened!?
---
&gt; Ever hoarded your loot in a station container and unfortunately hit 'repackage all'?
---
Did that 2 weeks ago. My god, the grief.
---
&gt;Check your facts mate.
---
It's pretty clear here that no amount of evidence I bring to the table is going to convince you of basic fundamental reality, so have a nice day.
---
An Eve player complaining about grinding?
---
CCP is in Iceland, not the US. People do get civilized vaction times in the developed world.
---
Honestly free-to-play EVE can match a lot of what you're looking for on pretty much all points. As far as splitting up so you're all specialized in something: it's doable, but picking things that are really far apart like industry, combat and exploration will make it difficult to find content all 3 of you can excel in. All 3 of you with a similar combat style and then splitting mining, hauling and industry will allow you to experience more of the game.
---
I'm always looking for people to introduce to Eve, if you're looking for someone to mentor you for a while I'd be glad to share a bit of what I know so you can get to the fun stuff faster. Just send me a PM and I'll get you sorted.

Looking forward to seeing you in space.

Only reason I found this mail is because I logged in to the character that sent it and had an unread mail from the guy we sent this to. 
---
Basically at the time our corp was maybe 5 guys strong and we were trying to intimidate the corp living there, scaring them out of trying to engage us and to move out peacefully. We had literally zero means of actually evicting them.
---
They didn't reply for quite some time so we kinda just said oh well and moved on. The mail I just saw today from them basically said "we're down to move or fight, fighting is fun but we're willing to negotiate", shame we didn't get the answer in time.
---
I totally get that. But calling it a "council" make it sound like a whole department just peaced out and there's nobody there covering the phones. I get that it's chaos era and all but that explanation sounds silly.
---
Hi K.D.
---
  I had the pleasure of being your delivery agent on this day. You got a lot of really great advice from your question! I hope that we meet again under ideal conditions.
---
  I'm a little sad that I'm seeing this on reddit after being called into the boss's office over your official complaint. You noted that you were expecting torpedoes and received instead a bomb. Little known fact... just like how 9v batteries have 6 smaller batteries inside... Bombs have 5 torpedoes inside. All you have to do is peel off the containment shield and your torpedoes are inside. Hope this helps!

---
They're downvoting you, but if you look at the comments here, it's all "I need my super to have a goal to skill up to", "my ship is expensive, I should be able to blap anyone and anything that gets in my way with no support", "don't nerf my carrier otherwise I'd need a fleet of plebs in subcaps to support me", all coming from people who started playing after injerctors were added, and who think EVE is just another lineal themepark.
---
Hope you all enjoy :)
---
Great, all the players expecting EVE to be a linear themepark MMO can get fucked back to that shitty, repackaged, outdated hell.
---
Thing with blitzing burners is that you arent getting raw isk into wallet (well not fully). The value comes from the LP so for example running empire burners will net you around 550 ISK per 1 LP, whereas running pirate LP can net you as much as 1,200 ISK per LP.
---
Then you have to transform that LP to faction items that you further have to sell off (Or find a frequent buyer). 
---
It's not a fair comparison to green anom ratting and "ISK/Hr"
---
No one quits Eve. They take a break.

Does this apply to combat probes too? I've just skilled into and have started flying a svipul and spent hours in low sec, camped at safes, scanning down systems. I'll get a ship, start scanning and it'll disappear. I know this would be a common thing for aware players to do (leave when they realise they're getting scanned down), but do bots react the same way?

You can't win the game. The game wins you. As long as you did not biomass your character (ie delete), you'll come back. The day you quit "for real" is when the servers shut down forever.

This has been happening for over a year now, where were you?
---
Essentially the moon mining changes killed Isogen and changed the dynamics of the minerals in relation to one another and the security statuses they were previously found at.  It's a reason I advocate for putting the ores back to their respective previous places.  (Though ccp I think has said that they are just flat out not going to do that.)
---
Theres an implant that makes it better than t2. Forget it's name
---
I live in wormholes so I really don't care about day one cap injection. My content changed but it's still there. Until CCP directly says. "you need to pay to win" then I'm fine with whatever. If they do something fucking stupid that actually kills the game then I'll move on to another game like any other reasonable person will. I'm not going to sit here and cry about bullshit I'm busy playing.
---
not as much as the diamonds you will be crying when titans start warping out left and right in huge TiDi fights because they are on a "real time" 3 min times, just like citadels...
---
Its 4x the game play of Eve's F1.
---
It's not an outcome that is part of the game. It's not intended to happen. You expect CCP to actively intervene in the sandbox because you don't like what someone is doing.
---
How much LP per hour?
---
Thank you very much, you and all the others who answered (replying here because this one is just an incredible blast of information). This vs. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ctkn91/3\_friends\_eve\_or\_elitedangerous\_or\_something\_else/exlkk4h?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ctkn91/3_friends_eve_or_elitedangerous_or_something_else/exlkk4h?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) really gets me thinking, but it is way more informed thinking than before. 
---
" what makes EVE very special is the community around it" -&gt; I can see that.
---
&gt; This has been happening for over a year now, where were you?
---
Well, not playing the game, but I was mostly referring to its entire fall from grace, not the recent drop from 50 to 15.
---
sure BFA is so fun, thats why its got a quarter of the subs that classic had...
---
whats that
---
A fun read if you do it in a Dan Cummin's voice
---
Grinding is the primary way to make money on Eve, yes.
---
Drifter holes having their sounds being removed. 
---
I’m not 100% sure if it’s just ambient noises or the jump activation.  I’m hoping jump activation. And also hoping this spreads across wormholes. I think with null sec finally catching up to the “chaos” of wormholes, that we wormholers could use some new shit to keep us on our toes.
---
Thank you! I would love to do a lot more of these videos. If anyone knows more about large fights that might happen feel free to send fat man132 jordan an eve mail about them and ill come video them. Working on Recruitment videos and what not is something I really want to do.
---
Haha, gf! I assume you wouldn't have stuck around if you hadn't gotten me with the bombs you had? You had one more left, right?
---
&gt;Little known fact... just like how 9v batteries have 6 smaller batteries inside... Bombs have 5 torpedoes inside. All you have to do is peel off the containment shield and your torpedoes are inside. Hope this helps! 
---
I still maintain that this should count as false advertisement. If you need 6 1.5V AA batteries, a 9V battery is of little use!
---
I am always on my toes in whs anyway...
---
what are you trying to say
---
All that time wasted having fun when I could have been grinding isk instead, smh.
---
People will usually eject if they have good implants in and are afraid of someone bringing a bubbler out to ensure a pod kill. The way they see it, the ship is dead anyways if no helps coming and you might as well save that billion isk pod.
---
i thought this was the age of chaos?!
---
let them eat ~~cake~~ formatting
---
Only a krab would say that.
---
Incorrect. You can eject at any time.
---
Ah I gotcha, but I was also referring to the larger drop.
---
EVE players have never had fun at any point in their lives, so they don't know what they are missing anyway.
---
Wormholes need something new for spicy play. I’m sad I missed the roaming drifter fleets in high class holes.
---
For exploration, you want to run relic sites in C1, C2 or C3 wormholes. These wormholes have pirate faction relic sites, where sleepers don't spawn. In C4+ wormholes, relic sites are better for ratters looking for sleeper loot.
---
If you jump through a gate and invasion rats are there I’d hold cloak for as long as possible and hope somebody else jumps through and Declan’s first so they get the NPC aggro. Perhaps you could fit low slots with warp core stabilisers so they can’t hold tackle and you can escape? Anyway good luck on your adventure!
---
CCP bad, WoW Classic good
---
I prefer trading outside of jita, or higher margin, slower moving items. These require fewer updates and is more passive.
---
I really don't think they thought through their changes at all. Also, if anyone cares to look, check out https://www.eve-offline.net and look at average users for last 36 hrs, 7 days, month, 2 months, and 6 months. This hasn't brought anyone back. Botters are still going strong. Those are active people not playing anymore.
---
The first time we met I had a little bit of other business to take care of so I didn't attempt a delivery. I just painted your ship a little so I could find you again.
---
The second time... Knowing you had an important delivery scheduled, I kinda knew that you would come running into my arms so I let the package fly a little early and turned in the other direction. It hit you face first. Oops! I'm still pretty new at this.
---
I think that this is a great opportunity to spread the word over the economy of bomb wrapped torpedoes. Tell your friends. It's safer than vaping!
---
So you have a main bumping it so it can’t run away. 
---
Then on alts you lock it up on all of them, but don’t shoot it yet. 
---
Once they’re all locked, just alt tab and F1. Using eve-o or some other multi box program it’s pretty easy to get then all to start in the same tick. It’s not that hard, just kinda hectic.
---
CCP is gonna do whatever but why would activation sounds be removed? There is still sounds and graphics for gatefires in Kspace. We gonna remove that too?
---
Interesting. I think it still looks great. But maybe that’s because of my nostalgia.
---
You say outdated. I say timeless.

At least try for something within the realm of possibility

Fingers crossed for random, unknown masses for all WHs....chaos baby. :-)
---
concord basically owns and controls the software we use as capsuleers.
---
Sorry but I don’t think you can say it’s objectively better. It’s a completely different game. 
---
Personally I don’t like it, but there are millions who do and fair enough if that’s what they enjoy. On the other hand there are millions of people who prefer vanilla. 
---
In my opinion, saying one is “better” than the other is just silly.
---
They can literally drop wormholes IN anomalies for all i care if they take away the ultimate safety of cloaking/kitey bullshit
---
Cheers! A shitfit armor keres just sounded like an offer too good to pass up lmao I'll pick it up when I'm home &lt;3
---
pretty accurate...
---
Yeah whole businesses close in parts of Europe for a week or two during the summer.
---
ya who the hell really knows. This feels lack lustre but at least it’s SOMETHING lol. Wormholes need some more of the “unknown”
---
Kinda an odd change, not really sure what purpose it serves
---
&gt;Only in a select few cities. 
---
Thing is, most countries don't have multiple cities that are high enough on homicide rates to get a high world ranking. The Americas tops your link. Africa is below. Then the world average. Then Europe. Forget cities for a moment cause you lost that argument. Or even countries cause you're leading in murders Vs ours. Your whole damn continent has exponentially more murders than the whole of mine, or the planet's average.
---
&gt;But this is r/eve so I'm not gonna get into a retarded political discussion with a dumb euro.
---
There's a reason the world laughs at the American education system. (people like you)
---
Of course the "I'll just quit" argument is accepted when it's your playstyle it hits, but it's "HAHA JUST ADAPT BADS" when it's someone else's problem.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Thanks champ!
---
But the Narrative!
---
FW is far from dead. You might get less action than before, but it’s still a nice place to get engagements, and you can even control a bit what those engagements will be (like getting a destroyer in a small plex, so you don’t get hammered by RLML cruisers).
---
Hate to break it to you but people can enjoy two different types of games at once.
---
yall did a number on bhaalgorns back in the day too, you should stop that
---
Agreed. If they’re gonna do something strange like this, why not all wormholes? I admit I don’t have much experience going in and out of them save for when they first appeared on sisi. But I imagine all the wormhole sounds (except violent it seems) would be the same sound file.
---
You're the kind of guy that piles into a group discussion because you heard something slightly wrong, got triggered, and started a long winded argument - completely detailing the original topic. I give you one point for effort posting.

WoW was my first MMO. The first time I got to explore a huge interactive world filled with new friends and enemies. I spent months sub 60 getting lost and having friends come save me when I got in over my head. The original game had a lot to offer. Years later I felt the same sense of exploration and awe at Eve's universe. Both games have a lot to offer from day one onward.
---
You rang?
---
What class?
---
Bumping someone without actually engaging them is griefing and effectively dodging the security mechanics. I'm glad to see this change, as making intentional bumping the hostile act it really is would be very difficult to do properly.
---
Grinding is the primary way to make isk*

This looks really good.  Next burner mission I get I'll be referring to this on the live shows.  :)
---
#NYEHHH... ShIt ChAnGeS CEE CEE PEEEEE
---
Are you?
---
Allright, then. Let's keep EVE one type, and linear shitty themeparks another type. 
---
If all of you brine fountains want to have "max level" "unbeatable" "no support needed" characters, WoW is the place for you, where you can kill newbies at starting areas with no opposition but easily killable NPCs. EVE was always the game where a single, well placed subcap would fuck up your super expensive titan, and CCP is trying to go back to that.
---
My current fit Falcon gets just over 100km optimal but that's a mix of jam strength and mobility. Just straight up range on say a blackbird and your optimal is 149km and the falloff 228km with a racial Jam strength of 11.1 which is decent enough. Your targeting range here is only 106km though so sebo it
---
The first person who said that was a genius. You however are not
---
Only in your dreams.
---
Snuff are all PL alts anyway.
---
Idk I've been in and out of wormholes for a while and outside of camping I'm not really sure who this even affects. I guess maybe it hurts people that put cloaked characters on holes with the sound turned up? Hmm
---
So that whole time period where fights were centered around POS and there were loot pinatas after major bloc battles didn't exist? Boy my memory must be terrible then because I remember it fondly.
---
Also your whole argument is based around "We didn't know this could happen so it shouldn't be done. People are going to quit the game because of it." This has been the reaction of so many people to every change that has ever happened if they would be effected by the change.  
---
Eve has meaning and substance because there is actual loss. CCP needs to get back to its roots and have loss actually effect players. There was a video where CCP Rise talked about trying to play as a alpha clone where he literally said that he had not had to worry about losing a ship in a while, and it really changed the experience for him to have to make every ship count. If this chaos era is meant to shake things up, to make the game feel alive again, then giving that feeling of loss to every player should be a goal that we applaud. Not something we stand in the way of out of fear. 
---
It was once a part of the NPE for a new player to lose their ship and get poded to continue the tutorial. The achievement was called the cycled continues. You must have missed the point of that lesson.
---
Are you able to read? Only a euro could stroke their ego about their inability to understand statistical data partitioning, there's more to the "Americas" homicide rate than just the US. When *Greenland* has a higher rate than the US you know statistics aren't the entire story.
---
Here are the numbers so you know what I'm talking about.
---
https://i.vgy.me/27BNVw.png 
---
&gt;There's a reason the world laughs at the American education system. 
---
Because they need to distract themselves from their terrible education at home? The US is the source of the most Nobel Prize winners, the most medical and scientific discoveries and advances, the most technological leaps. 
---
We have the best universities. http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html
---
We publish the most academic work. 
---
https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?order=h&amp;ord=desc&amp;year=2018
---
That’s historically how everyone in wormhole space farms their static if they don’t roll incomings. Bubble and a cloaked scout. You’re gonna see a lot more of these farming corps using programs like “PingMe” to keep safe.
---
Hasn't worked yet. Maybe if they were banned, disbanded, and 10x the ISK confiscated as negative debt maybe it will deter them.
---
I don't think the Supreme Protector would lie about something like that.
---
throw away your computer and stop gaming then because you will have more bots than Eve in pretty much every game
---
We should have them monthly. It keeps ~~the peasantry in line~~ morale high.
---
I'm sort of disappointed.
---
Was expecting some meme post with a pic of a child asking a parent the question.
---
You should see the tengus I donated for the Thera scanners. In a defensive fight the attackers are in for a nasty surprise.
---
I take it this is for high sec?
---
What are cynos?
---
Most bonuses are multiplicative, but there are some additive bonuses. Off the top of my head, Warp Core Stabilizers give +1 warp core strength, and T3C Subsystems give +400GJ capacitor and things like that.
---
Play is already spicy. It's like a pawn shop, you never know what you're gonna get.
---
You lot get all the timers! What else do you lot want!
---
Isogen:  the mistake CCP keep making when they mean to buff Mexallon.
---
They gave it the bonus, just didn't update the description text for the hull.
---
Why you'd use a Marshal to light a cyno is another matter...
---
The Charon was destroyed for demanding to see their manager.
---
LOOT PINATA!!!
---
\*starts space fiesta music\*
---
Makes sense. Base gains like LSEs/Armor Plates are just the base, but all other bonuses are multiplicative. 
---
So ships like the Gila/Rattlesnake really benefit from anything that upgrades drones.
---
New reaction:  convert Isogen into Mexallon.
---
I mean I've been in multiple cross over-guilds at this point and most eve players are fucking awful at WoW. F1 pushing doesn't make you good at other MMO's.
---
didnt corps used to have reputations to factions based on a average of its members?
---
God dammit why didn't I think of that.
---
Don't think that's a good idea if they're taking the sound away. You still get gate fire sounds in K space, don't you?
---
Perhaps using a travel fit with nanofiber internal structures and putting low friction nozzle join rigs on in the rig slots can give you enough align speed to get off before being targeted. Then when you get where you want to be just swap out the nanofiber with whatever it is you're usually using, though the rigs would be a pain if you're already relying on others
---
Any chance you have those comms saved?
---
&gt; You lot get all the timers! What else 
---
You must be joking right?
---
I've bounced off Eve several times myself.  Recently put it back on the PC, logged in and realized I don't even have the willpower to figure this all out again.  The UI is overwhelming again.
---
This game just takes more time and commitment than I have for it but the concept of it sounds so cool. My most successful run was creating a trade Corp with a bunch of alts.  That ended up being just chasing an ever higher number with no other goal and got old. I don't have the time or commitment to join PvP fleets though I tried a few times to join various corps.  Too much logistics for the action for my taste.
---
Still something about Eve has me thinking of re-subbing even though I know I can't play.  I logged in without Omega and can't fly the ship I was in.  Weird.  The client still sits there.  Maybe I'll buy some Plex and try again...
---
This is literally complaining about nothing. If they roll back some of the cyno changes or modify it later it's easier for them to keep the original balance around the 10 minute mark.
---
Either way, you're being a salty douche over nothing.
---
Citadels in their current form are a cancer on this game
---
You already are.
---
This is really dumb if so, triglavian weapons do way too much damage already.
---
While I upvoted, I wonder if that is still true since Injectors, Rorqs, citadells, the umbrella, etc.
---
The DotLan stargate jumps is enough for me
---
I second this. Go for mining once you have friends to do it with. Mining is sadly not interactive like it is in say Elite Dangerous. You lock a rock, fire the lasers, scan them once in a while to see how much ore is left. Doing that alone isn't exactly thrilling. Once you have people to do it with you have people to socialize with and it's a fun social chat room sort of deal.
---
Not opposed to the change, though I'd prefer it stayed for just a few whs as then it makes it a danger to the uninformed and adds further diversity to whs. (My speakers don't work so for me I don't really suffer if it changes)
---
Ah, so it is nowadays. I'm still way behind the times on some things.
---
&gt;Are you able to read? Only a euro could stroke their ego about their inability to understand statistical data partitioning, there's more to the "Americas" homicide rate than just the US. When Greenland has a higher rate than the US you know statistics aren't the entire story.
---
Now break it down into gun violence. What story do they tell?
---
&gt;Because they need to distract themselves from their terrible education at home? The US is the source of the most Nobel Prize winners, the most medical and scientific discoveries and advances, the most technological leaps.
---
Lmao.
---
No. The US has exponentially more money than most other countries. This is the reason for most of your advancement. Of course there are intelligent individuals, there are too many people there to not have a few, but your own president doesn't believe in climate change despite a 98% consensus among the leading minds in the field. One step forward two steps back eh? 
---
Also you have 3257 universities in the US. 58 are top 100. That's 1.78%
---
The UK has 280. 7 are top 100. That's 2.5%
---
So you fall short when we look at things proportionately. You have vastly more universities than everywhere else, but that's a pretty low percentage making top 100.
---
And of course you publish the most work. As stated above you have more institutions. Publishing work doesn't mean it's up to a high standard.
---
Again I would be shocked if the overwhelming majority of cases where players take sudden extended leaves could not be solved by 30 seconds of logging in at some point during the leave. Are there going to be edge cases, you bet. 
---
This being said there are workarounds that actually would be beneficial in other areas as well. If a kill mail was generated where lost items were attributed to the character who owned the items, instead of the owner of the citadel, then a GM could quite easily check last log in date and see the extended leave of absence from the game. If a player files a ticket that explains the situation and links the killmail, The GMs now also have a list of all your stuff and can pop it back into existence in the closest low sec system. Again this is a tool for edge cases. Paying the isk to move your stuff on your own should be the norm, not the exception.
---
Let's not say things are impossible because they might possibly negatively effect us in the future.
---
What’s eve f1
---
What’s the 27th month again?
---
Not in Stain anymore, that's for sure.
---
The trig invasions are random events that will last a handful of days before dissipating, allowing you passage through the system like normal.  They aren't intended as a skill/fit check to progress the SoE arc (if that's what you were wondering.)
---
My suggestion would be to wait it out, or ask in local for an escort.  Good luck!
---
empire lp can get into the 2000-3000 isk/lp range at 12,000 (0.6)-14,000(0.5) lp per mission and lowsec payouts are going to be even bigger.  the science/industry corps have nice 5 run bpcs for sale in their LP stores,  think faction webs, damage mods, and whatnot. 
---
null LP payouts are big but it's pretty variable blood LP isn't all that great as plenty of ship bpcs drop from rats and talismans aren't in big demand,  where serpentis LP sells pretty good with askleps and snakes plus can move ship bpcs.
---
I prefer linking WHs to suspected bot systems. Never a bad time to fight the good fight against bots, also I'd say it's one of the few ideas that the blackout naysayers who mine things and the pvp obsessed WH urchins can all enjoy
---
Apparently it's the best F1
---
Yeah, those Ventures, Barges and afk Orcas really cut into the profit of the massive Rorqual fleets...
---
Bring back alchemy just for normal minerals now instead of moon goo of old.
---
200-300 mil/hr in highsec should be pretty reproducible. I was maxing out a bit over 300 but that was a while back
---
??? Less than 200 guilds ever even cleared all vanilla raids. Out of millions of people.
---
Currently, have duel in your cargo hold, activate cyno module, and capitals in fleet can then land right on you from any system that is within range of it, and titans can activate a bridge to send subcap fleets to your cyno instead.
---

This use won't change. Lv4s do not require 400km sniping.

FYI, you only ever have to do one level 1 mission ... if you train Connections 3.
---
Then you can do level 2 missions, most of which can be done in a destroyer.  [Beware of '[Mission of Mercy](https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=MissionOfMercy2)', which has a lot of cruisers, and is easiest done in a cruiser.]
---
You seem to have really bat Triglavian luck ... or I have really good luck.  I've seen them once:  about 5 frigs warped to a nearby planet(?) while I was repairing hull on a freeport several hundred km away.
---
You could use a 'travel-fit' with a [cloak and MWD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uBcK_c8Gy4), and re-fit before doing the mission (note:  if no refit facilities in the system, you can carry a 'mobile depot' and anchor it ... if you have cargohold space).

While I miss the old ECM as I flew it everywhere it was useful and everywhere else too, the current ECM is still very useful if you have range and some good tacs. Just don't get caught because you can no longer jam to save yourself
---
We had a cool talk on comms the other night about incoming sigs needing to be within dscan range to appear on the probe window or having a 3 minute delay on the sig popping up in the probe scanner is like some cool delay mechanics to make it a bit more dangerous
---
And PL are PH meatshield

Right - but those just apply to modules, not bonuses like ship bonuses and skills, right?

So if I lag behind fleet and warp at 70-100 then smash the orbit button and let loose the jelly (jams) I'm good?

---
gosh who would play a 15 year old game in 2019 what idiots.
---
I know a few people that used to be involved in attacking POSes. On several occasions they got tens of billions in loot from their targets. Blueprints were a large part.
---
On another occasion I became aware of a T2 BPO being copied at a particular POS and discussed with mercs the possibility of hitting it (it wasn't quite worth their fee). But again this was a conflict driver.
---
I mean, I never played Vanilla until I started up on a private server a few years ago (though I did play retail starting with The Burning Crusade) and I prefer Classic to the modern incarnation. I won't write a wall of text, but at least personally I find it to be a genuinely better game.
---
I'm going to repeat this- *Greenland has a higher intentional homicide rate than the US*, because you don't seem to get it.

Crime has been going down, homicide has been going down, and the US will continue to outperform "the rest of the developed world".

[FBI Murder Statistics 2016](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-12) for actual gun *murders*(because including 2/3rds of *deaths* being suicide is bullshit)

^(Florida didn't have murder data available from FBI, so it's not included)

 If you do the Brady Campaign's [Criminals' Choice/Least Crim Friendly List](https://www.bradycampaign.org/press-room/new-travel-site-for-criminals-spotlights-friendliest-states-to-buy-carry-or-traffic-guns) versus firearm murder rate^(still FBI), [it's all over the fucking place](https://imgur.com/a/3snRE) ^(Green="Least Friendly", Red = "Criminal's Choice") because gun-grabbers are idiots.

&gt;Also many lols at a country of 325 million having 58 of the top 100 universities in the world.
---
UK has 66 million and a higher percentage in the top 100 than you. 
---
&gt;I'm going to repeat this- Greenland has a higher intentional homicide rate than the US, because you don't seem to get it.
---
Not heard of any mass shootings in Greenland tbqh.
---
&gt;Crime has been going down, homicide has been going down, and the US will continue to outperform "the rest of the developed world".
---
Except you're still significantly above us in terms of crime and homicide. The US isn't outperforming anyone.
---
Because thats what they said? Nerfing super umbrellas isnt for the solo guy either now it it? Fking nerfing NS is all about nerfing the big guy. I mean what?
---
Timers are for AUTZ, jeez man get with the times.
---
The fof changes are nice. They were mostly used for wormhole botting with pancakes anyway.
---
Its okay. My mind is blown too.
---
&gt; The direction they took with wow aside, it's an objectively better game than classic.
---
Never played vanilla until I started on a private server, genuinely prefer the classic version. Most of my friends feel the same way, and we spent the last few years playing on various private servers while our retail subscriptions lapsed. 
---
They're totally different games offering totally different experiences. I just, frankly, don't give a shit about most of the stuff that modern WoW revolves around.
---
Do stukas even have cloaks? Then its not fking blops is it?
---
Watch the Clarion Call Videos and Clear Skies...
---
You can get supers to warp at 5+ AU fairly easy. Hacs warp significantly slower, and it’s a fleet so you’ll align everyone, wait a bit, then warp, etc
---
At this point I wouldn’t unless you *really* want to mine, or you want to use it for tackling supers or combat fitting it.
---
&gt; UK has 66 million and a higher percentage in the top 100 than you.
---
So?
---
&gt;Not heard of any mass shootings in Greenland tbqh.
---
Non sequitur. Intentional homicide is intentional homicide, whether it's one person or five, or 50.
---
&gt;Except you're still significantly above us in terms of crime and homicide. The US isn't outperforming anyone.
---
I posted the link to the rates, there's nothing significant about the US versus the UK.
---
When I'm in a hurry, I'lll still sometimes mix up magstabs and gyrostabilizers.
---
To be fair, if you were an NEET, it'd be USTZ 23/7
---
If that hole doesn't bounce around it's gonna be hellcamped by titans.
---
I bet I know [what the pilot looks like](https://yourfriendshouse.com/opinion/the-can-i-speak-to-the-manager-haircut-is-a-very-real-phenomenon/)
---
That's correct
---
&gt; If you take out lfr amd lfg in retail and cross realm raiding. Boom you have everything everyone misses about classic.
---
You'd also need to massively increased the difficulty of every mob in the open world, remove 95% of the epics and replace them with blues, remove most sources of gear, remove flying, rework the story to not revolve around the player being the second coming of christ, etc...
---
New capital cyno module that is made from millions of units of Isogen?
---
I play US TZ as I'm in the US TZ. Some people get up early and play at work.
---
that was the best/worst thing ive watched/heard all day :)
---
I left SC a while ago so I don't know what their defense policy is. I wonder if they would actually form up to defend their citadel or just shoot fireworks at them.
---
I think it's technically illegal at the federal level but states tailor the rules at their level, so the statement's not entirely bullshit
---
There is a distinct difference in a play style evolving over the years because of play population, experience, game changes and player density than say... purpose made ccp aimed mechanics changes designed specifically to drastically impact a specific set of play styles done with a different approach of no collaboration or need for feedback. I get you have an opinion and feel strongly. That's fine. Your opinion won't make the many, many people impacted by this decide "ya, I know this isn't fun- but those guys in reddit are right. I should accept it and do it anyway. Even if I'd rather just not play the game anymore."
---
&gt; more realistic designs.
---
You're playing a game about submarines cosplaying as spaceships. EVE is every bit as unrealistic as World of Warcraft, to be blunt.
---
That sad, I'm being pedantic, and I imagine you're probably referring to the art style.
---
usually they have cloaks equiped but they're offline. They can still take a blops bridge, so you tell me.
---
500 dps is a pretty full gank DD,  it's not going to live long enough to win the dps race unless you have an ewar alt, or are doing the angel burner. 
---
looking at the completion times in the doc it looks like it can kill the AF faster than the garmur can kill a logi and the AF.  I haven't tested the new fits at all but I'll take jori's word.
---
Thing is, come october the next part of their deal with PA concludes and that is (if I remember it correctly) a 200m payout based on certain metrics. No idea what said metrics are and ye it could very well be something like that. A short term rush and come october things might just chill out. 
---
Because I mean some of these things dont really make sense.
---
I mean it sounds like a rage quit. You put a bounty on someone (lol he probably laughed) with the rest of your money and emo quit. Sounds like a weird turn of events as you seemed to enjoy everything else.
---
The OP is a big idiot complaining that CCPs lowsec roam/whelp with 12b cerbs and a titan basically allowed us to gg them and loot the field thereby providing “srp” for a couple titans we lost the other day fighting GOTG.
---
The only correct response to your mail would have been "fuck off retard" shoulda evicted them really
---
&gt; Why are major choke points like that on the lower end of hisec?
---
The answer is of course 42.
---
"LeKjart said during his presentation at the first Fanfest that 42 was the number used to seed Tranquility.  Eight hours later, Tranquility was created, populated with objects and NPCs, then went live to the public shortly thereafter." -- CCP Kieron

Remove hole tanking, :| allows pussies of wh space to be even more pussy
---
That's why you don't buy it, you just harvest it. This way it's free.
---
Sure thats a ship that can fight. But how many even use them in that capacity for it to be worth mentioning? Its by no means the majority setup. Especially in blackout. Ive pretty much only seen people use bombers or the blops itself. If they come in from a WH then sure, seen plenty of lokis but they are not blops fitted.
---
its much easier than that 
---
its just retards doing retarded things while being retarded
---
They're not a problem at all. Look at [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/zYkTZpr.png). HiSec mining is literally a drop in the bucket compared to just *one* region in NullSec.
---
Also, Isogen was already available in HiSec.
---
If the chart was for Zydrine or Megacyte then you *may* have had a very thin point.
---
Yeah but sometimes it's 12..3 and not just 123.
---
How does Difficulty Access modifier factor in? is it easy to tell if it is being included?
---
Those are just 'fishermen' that happen to use guns.
---
Eve 'fishermen' prefer to use explosives.
---
Don't forget the Death Coil after the diminishing returns on fear, then a engi grenade for good measure.
---
If they want a fight why are they using a module and ship with the sole purpose of not even being seen?
---
3 areas is *technically* only a few.
---
Lol baited
---
It's where Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen get into interceptors and race around a system.
---
I'm not a wormholer so I don't know the full details or ramifications of the change, but in short they're making it so only force recons and black ops can light cynos
---
Actually blind anyone looking into your LAZORS.
---
?effawgginS
---
Care to point out to where exactly they said it? I've seen them say they want to make supers more difficut to use, but as an endgame ship, not against the umbrellas. 
---
Seriously, sources. If you want mine, just listen to hillmar's last interview in TIS.
---
ohhhh
---
....he does realize most of those 12b value...came from server hampsters that are utterly worthless and unsellable?  5-6b each...cant do anything with
---
as a person that made a faction warfare alt to take advantage of all the free skill points i was shocked at the lack of isd in noob help and how much wrong info was being passed out i hope this is something gets looked into and to be honest i felt like some of the people were activly trying to scare new players off by putting huge bounties on them and letting them think it was bad i been in eve sence 2012 and i dont rember but my noob alt collected some where like  a bill in bounties in a very short time i hope this is just because it was during a vacation time or something is not how it has been the last 8 years
---
&gt; Ships will now automatically enter warp after three minutes of attempting to align and reach the required speed. 
---
Wow.  Just.  Wow.
---
Didn't need to read past that.  You could have put "taxes increased by 50%", and gotten away with it.
---
Great changes!
---

Push for Eve, compromise by saying y'all can switch to Star citizen if it ever comes out. Initially join a corp with other players that have a microphone. Try to find one that does a non trivial amount of pvp as well as the pve. Train into doing frigate abyssals, they can be done solo but the harder ones can only be done with three ships.
---
The reason I stress that you join a corporation with other players that use microphones is so they can give you advise, assistance, and not have the common situation of the blind leading the blind. Preferably not a care bear corporation. Though Signal Cartel is the exception to that rule, they play eve differently and can be a good taste of the game.

The GOAT

It's rough, for sure, but not terrible. I would find a questing buddy to make it less boring and faster questing/leveling.. Hell if you roll a tank or healer, you're almost guaranteed to get into any dungeon and that definitely makes a big difference.. People forget the struggles on vanilla having to find a healer and tank for their dungeon group before the LFG Tool existed and would spam LFG chat for up to an hour looking.
---
The world pvp is incredibly fun though.. You'll find out in Stranglethorn Vale. 🙂
---
&gt;So?
---
So you have nothing to brag about. You're comparatively underperforming. 
---
&gt;Non sequitur. Intentional homicide is intentional homicide, whether it's one person or five, or 50.
---
Greenland had 3 murders the year your chart was comparing. The US had 17k. A tiny country with a high murder rate for one single year is a funny example to pick. A single murder makes a massive difference in their case. It doesn't to the US.
---
Why not compare the US rate of **5.3** to the UK rate of **1.2**?
---
&gt;I posted the link to the rates, there's nothing significant about the US versus the UK.
---
Except there literally is. You can't read because your own table showed a significant difference. As I stated above.
---
Scotland: 1.2 England: 1.2 Ireland: 0.9 Wales:1.2 
---
USA: 
---
#5.3
---
You're either a troll, or your stupidity should be packaged and weaponised. Your own link showed a significant difference.
---
am i the only one who thinks that most people seem to take the MER way too seriosuly ? 
---
this is a game let the poor devs have their holidays
---
^
---
Man, I need to start hanging out on the gate with something to scoop the loot.
---
How does it take a lot of time to code in? It’s ray tracing for a reason.
---
2-3k isk/lp items arent liquid. You cant put any reasonable amount of LP through them
---
That's a jumpgate, not a cyno.
---
wormholer btw
---
Now compare a country that hands guns out like sweets to one that has gun control.
---
USA Vs UK is a nice example. 
---
You're linking stats saying gun control doesn't work, but your definition of gun control is different to the rest of the world. Stopping someone from owning a bump stock/limiting magazine size doesn't qualify as gun control. Stopping someone from owning/having access to firearms does.

Post a recording please.

Curious on your take of Borderlands then.
---
I've said it before...but...nice try CCP, nice try
---
The triglavian ships around the gates shouldn't be able to one shot you if you just throw in some buffer (shield extenders or armor plates) and a damage control unit while travelling.
---
Lol
---
Dammit, take your upvote.
