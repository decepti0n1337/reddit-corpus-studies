hows that relevant to the topic of local in nullsec
---
---
---
We just need a mass culling or just a thanos snap where one day half of all null sec structures are just gone
---
/u/Michael_Wilmore did you post this on Eve forums? Deserves a formal follow up straight to CCP
---
running the script now, will add once it finishes its run. takes a fare amount of time
---
With timers goons show up with 1000+ Titans. Did we even defend SH-1?
---
Roflmao for sure. Something something drifters dds insta kill structures and contents lol
---
Well thanks now that's a solution that doesn't break any rules and is possibly more efficient
---
Who actually stores porn on their computer in TYOOL 2019? (Even 2017 when it was likely from)
---
You claimed that without local no-one can make isk. That is demonstrably untrue because people do in wormholes.
---
wut.  you guys had a defense fleet flying around saranen like 24/7, i fucked with it using coward corms many many times.  grr goons and all that but half the people whining were probably docked themselves at that time and have zero clue
---
All my accounts just got deleted from the launcher. Did I do something to cause this?
---
You want to protect carebears.  Because you are one.  And risk scares you.  God forbid you lose a ship in a PvP game.  But again, keep throwing the insults.  It's clear that you're a soft carebear who wants perfect safety.  We all get it.  Enjoy your mining in hisec.
---
wilmore u sexy fuck
---

---
you made me read about eve online
---
That's just an isk fee - make it a chance to lose the assets.  People will fight over the chance to drop a supercap.
---
This feature is already in the game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's called `wormhole space`.
---
What other video game gets as many dissertations written about it?
---
The issue isn't really about safety or non-safety that comes with the drifters. The issue is more that there is nothing you can do against them to react. If another player entity harasses you, you can go and kick their shit in, you can infiltrate them and destroy them from the inside, you can negotiate, you can camp a freaking gate/wormhole to stop them coming in, or you start using guerilla tactics and many more. But no matter what, there is options.
---
You mean you drop 50+ supers on them and continue on with your day.
---
Yeah just dont use a typhoon trying to headshot their FC
---
༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ DRIFTERS ~~TAKE MY ENERGY~~ FARM MY ANOMALIES ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
---
Very nice analysis
---
&gt;who the fuck do you think will live **in null** anymore without local, it's the only reason anyone's able to make isk **there**. please stop being an idiot
---
I enjoyed this movie film. Looks like an evening well spent! Wormholes are still so much fun.
---
Imagine making a video about blobbing subs with supers, adding garbage text about how tough it was and getting surprised at downvotes. Stop being an idiot please
---
Yet
---
Like concord, trivalgrians and drifters get into a massive 3 way conflict where it's in phases and the last phase is them all using their super weapon which causes mad and wipes half of null, a third of ls and a quarter of hs. Should also fuck with the wormholes a bit.
---
Spot on with everything. Looking forward to Part 2.
---
CCP take a serious read of this post because it's changes like these that have the potential to bring people back to the game.
---
Imagine making a garbage vid about blobbing subs with supers, adding commentary on how tough it was and getting surprised at people downvoting... Don't be a retard pls
---
Tell me more about how you and your 30,000 closest friends and your cap umbrella are struggling right now.  Tell me how hard it is to play Eve without perfect safety and an instant "I win" cyno button if something unexpected happens.  Let's hear it.  Don't hold back!
---
What if bs could use networked sensor array?
---
Init's meme fleet boosh Ravens would like to talk to you.
---
It was good up until the supers and Titans cynoed in
---
&gt;What fleet comp were you running?
---
in this instance, it was a kitchen sink fleet - it was in staging so people were just shooting at the drifters with no coordination. it wasn't even really a fleet, much less one with a composition.
---
&gt;What other ships were on grid?
---
from memory, a dread and a pair of carriers and i couldn't tell you what else - i don't have blues on my overview nor was i paying a huge amount of attention beyond those 3 ships.
---
&gt;What was your sig compared others? Some shield modules and rigs increase your sig.
---
it was 333m.
---
&gt;First off, there is no pod kill related to that Sabre kill. There is however one related to another death you had in a Corm today. We won't worry about pesky details though, will we?
---
my API isn't on zkill, and i use a blank clone when i go roaming. it was just a training pod anyway, nothing that would influence combat.
---
Clearly it was a well executed plan
---
So bottom line if there's a chance you might lose your ship, the average null alliance would rather bitch to CCP/attack highsec than risk that loss?
---
Hey I found your lost chromosomes, where'd you want them?
---
Yeah I imagine those harpies had so much fun forming for 20 minutes for a whole 3 minutes of spreading scrams and those lokis surely had a blast with the great subcap pvp they had. Were you one of the super pilots by chance or are you just this stupid?
---
Imagine actually pinging your alliance to review bomb Eve :-D
---
tell me more about how tips on killing completely different rats in completely different areas of the game is remotely relevant to the situation at hand.
---
i'll be waiting.
---
We've had more than one report of people dying before they saw them land.  If you see them fully land you're already dead, you have to rat aligned and warp off the tick you see the models warp in
---
Use you map and look at active players.
---
I didn't offer you any advice.  I'm not here for that.  I'm here to listen to you and your friends cry like little bitches because your world isn't perfectly safe.  That cyno win button ain't working now.
---
like, why would you even bother trying to get on top of them in a fleet comp that hits out to like 250km to begin with?
---
common sense would like a word with you.
---
You're the one running to highsec because your home isn't safe anymore.  You're the one crying that CCP is ruining the game. Common sense left your ass months ago.
---
&gt; I didn't offer you any advice.
---
i didn't say you did - but this is what we're discussing. 
---
&gt;I'm here to listen to you and your friends cry like little bitches because your world isn't perfectly safe.
---
i haven't mentioned safety once.
---
&gt;That cyno win button ain't working now.
---
cynos work perfectly fine, there's no jammer mechanic associated with any of the drifter stuff.
---
Drifters sometimes leave after you kill them. Sometimes they respawn. It also seems to change every other day. 
---
So, you’re probably safe to fly around, since the odds of you taking a gate that they’re camping are pretty low, but there is always the possibility of either new drifter mechanics or of you jumping a gate right as drifters land on it
---
So what's the problem? Drop that cap umbrella and clear these rats out.  Stop crying on reddit about how hard it is and just get it done.
---
We all do, friend. We all do.
---
that's funny, i'm very much not in high sec since there's nothing unsafe about my home, but thanks for playing.
---
Well then why is the Mittani and every other nullbloc leader crying so much right now?  If it's not unsafe, why are you all complaining on reddit so much? If everything's fine, what's up with all the posts?
---
You dont have to stay in Karmafleet if you resub. If you think the game is interesting, dont let Mittens being a dumbass deter you from having fun
---
&gt; So what's the problem?
---
if you'd learn to read basic english, you'd know.
---
&gt;Stop crying on reddit about how hard it is and just get it done.
---
we've got it done, it has been a solved problem since last thursday.
---
Why is that every single thread I see you in you're shilling some dumb propaganda line like some smooth-brain superhero? Have you ever had a thought that didn't originate with what other people told you?
---
&gt; Well then why is the Mittani and every other nullbloc leader crying so much right now?
---
again, basic english - go and read.
---
Doesn’t matter how well a bubble is camped, you should never lose an Astero to a gatecamp unless they set up a rapecage of cans to prevent decloaking. 
---
In wormholes you can be instant killed by a tackle bomber and his Loki friend, and there is literally nothing you can do about it because no local
---
&gt; those lokis surely had a blast with the great subcap pvp they had  
---

Sounds like another isogen 5 explosion lol. Whs are fine tho... its really ns and hs.
---
Reas my earlier comment ;)
---
As a wh boi I gotta say you nullbears have been missing out
---
I'm also thinking that CCP wants to change the state of their game through lore events which lead to the implementation of new gameplay mechanics. As a recent concord report stated, the fluid routers are struggling under the drifters attack in null sec which could mean that a partial shutdown of the local chat and maybe even gates is imminent, which would allow for a lot more content ect. Also I dare to believe that the drifters are intended to be some form of a new softcap as to how many structures you can anchor in a system before they show up and disrupt your gameplay
---
This is incredible
---
I appreciate your insistence on "basic english."  I can read, and I can read the constant bitching on reddit by you and your boys.  Either it's solved and you're all crying over nothing, or it's not solved, and you're all little bitches because someone's come along to ruin your game.  Either way, you're a little bitch.  Funny how that works.  It's just basic english, you see.
---
What's an isogem 5 explosion. Also ls and wh shouldn't get off Scott free all of eve should be culled appropriately and non descriminately.
---
You play a spaceship videogame you idiot this analogy is so retarded. Someone non blue flies subs in your space better make sure they never get that idea again otherwise people might get content and we don't want no fun around our game.
---
&gt; I can read
---
your replies dictate that you haven't put those skills to any use, then.
---
&gt; Someone non blue flies subs in your space better make sure they never get that idea again  
---
Exactly.
---
&gt;Also I dare to believe that the drifters are intended to be some form of a new softcap as to how many structures you can anchor in a system before they show up and disrupt your gameplay
---
Wonder how that could be used to shit on someone by throwing roachmotels everywhere?
---
Such hostility
---
Its a lore thing cosmic entangled explosion across a huge number of systems. Theres a chronicle about it.
---
That being said, I only say that cuz those area have the most structures and stuff like titans. 
---
I would probably quit if I lost my wh station without any warning. Something like 15-20b easy. I know small compared to ns but its at least half my networth lol.
---
I like that you're not even trying to deny that you don't want anything that involves any risk whatsoever...
---
&gt;	What is labour time in EVE online worth?
---
At the beginning, your labor is worth almost nothing at all. When you’ve got no skill points and no isk sunk into money-making ships, about the best you can do is mining in a barge or ratting in a cruiser. 
---
In the late game, when you’ve got access to manufacturing structures, refineries, industrial capital ships, freighters, ratting carriers, etc., your labor is worth a lot. Peoppe who’ve been playing the game for a long time find it easy to plex (buy a game-time extension with just in-game money).
---
I get the impression that this is all just brain fart by the CPP marketing group to use as a backstory for a marketing campaign.
---
Well, it was probably browser history and that’s been an unsolvable enigma for most people since the invention of the internet.
---
irl happens.
---
some times you have to just log off in the arse end of nowhere and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
citadels have timers - you have time to move your shit if you don't want to lose it. if you're unable to play the game because you're on holiday or something when a citadel is destroyed that's kinda on you because you knew that event was coming up and should've planned accordingly.
---
Your parents named you frosty turtle?
---
Wouldn't feel right. I like being a Goon. It's just frustrating to see something that could be fun turned into Very Serious Business.
---
Get more friends, noob
---
Dropping warp-in bookmarks on difficult combat sites.
---
This is why today videogames review are shit and non reliable of the quality of the game, imagine they go do that on steam Eve's page... Pathetic.
---
Done and added
---
Yep.  Don't shit in my home.
---
Don’t tell them, I love reading all the to the RRREEEE posts on here
---
Goon CSM motto at least, yes.
---
Seeing this makes me think. I wonder if there are some ninja wh blockade runners making a killing off these wrecks.
---
Btw, I am a ten year vet of EvE. Love the game, but also love fitness. Want to see if I can meet other fitness focused eve players.
---
lmao, jesus that spike looks even crazier
---
thanks for doing that, btw
---
So...  It \*IS\* good for the game.
---
They take about half a second to land and lock you.  So, being aligned isn't a miracle cure.
---
I blame it on my high sodium diet of tears and salt i get on r/eve everyday
---
Not that many wormholes or blops.
---
Fantastically meta. 
---
I love it.
---
&gt;If you do play EvE do you engage in fitness alongside obsessing over internet spaceships?
---
Yes.
---
I lift before work, and I grapple most days after work and both days on the weekend.
---
The last eve meetup I went to, in london, everyone seemed to be pretty fit and healthy - the group photo even made it on to reddit.
---
enjoy the coding challenges lol
---
yes.
---
[thinking emoji]
---
Can you imagine how many people would cease or lessen roaming if you removed being able to logoff in space? These people already fly the fastest ships that stay aligned out and bolt at the first sign of a fight they may not win, taking away their trick to escape a fight, warp around and eventually log off in fear of generating a loss mail on their killboard. 
---
**We need more fights, more reasons to fight and less ways to escape a fight.** 
---
The vast majority of people who want assets to drop, either in full or at random from citadels upon destruction are the people who hunt citadels that people abandon. 
---
The others are ones who either operate out of NPC space or highsec, or rarely they just want free stuff because their fun overrides anyone else's. 
---
It's pretty pathetic to see pvpers begging for even more stuff.
---
Yeah it was super fun but there's even a reply to this comment disavowing us undocking, so it's obviously a narrative being pushed.
---
I'll wait until more responses accumulate.  Better safe than sorry and banned.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/EVE%20Online
---
People on reddit like to complain about how ccp is at fault for the current state of the game but people acting like you doesn't help either
---
Nice! I lift 4 times a week, cardio 2 times. Wish I could do more combatives. Nothing like training to get the body moving and exhausted. 
---
Not surprised about London.
---
Windows, Nvidia, and Steam all have overlays that can record gameplay and no one gets banned for those. Rockstar is just dicks about stuff sometimes.
---
They want to multibox seats on the airplane.
---
For sure. The grappling is pretty much my main hobby. I haven't done anything that's so physically and mentally demanding in my life before I started doing that. It' just makes so many other aspects of your life better - confidence and problem solving being the two big ones imo.
---
There is a major difference, you can't align in a vni or Ishtar usually, and subcaps move so fast that if they were to align, they would burn too far away from the site to lock targets. A carrier is going to want to pull fighters before they warp to avoid losing them, and with nsa cycle time, there's a decent chance they get locked in place. Furthermore, if the carrier does Earp off without their fighters, a decent hunter can tackle them on the structure they warp to(unless they abandon their fighters, which most carrier pilots are loath to do.
---
TLDR: removing local would hurt both, but the subcaps far more because they die too quickly to get help.
---
Wormhole logistics are *done* by people, but the challenge isn't created by players, instead arising from wormhole and citadel mechanics.
---
The drifters invaded in 2019, not 2016
---
piss off your entire playerbase for a week of one alliance mass-dropping structures while everyone else ignores it, great plan
---
let's not pretend all-out brawls will happen over vacated space, we literally *just* saw this happen with skillu
---
"please come and repeatedly kill me" ~ nobody, ever.
---
So instead of titans and supers, it will be titans and t3c?
---
One of the best groups around.
---
That's... okay, point noted.
---
&gt;"the inner hell lokis are tough"
---
fucking lmao, actually making me feel sorry for inner hell over here.
---
you're giving ccp alot of credit here. 
---
plus drifters as a hardcap would be stupid. what's needed is to make structures easier to kill. look at the recent mechanics post on this sub. i would fucking love for that to actually happen
---
&gt;I mean there are basic citadel maintenance tasks such as refueling that aren't rewarding, engaging, fun, but still necessary and good for the health of the game.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;But I get what you mean. For example, CCP could have spent 1/4 of the effort spent to drifters to a mobile deployable that replaces siphon units (in a better, stronger way that favors the thief). So now citadel owners must be wary against fuel thieves, and chasing them off is a new kind of manhour tax. There you go, something that discourages citadel spam by introducing a manhour tax, yet also encourages meaningful PvP activity.
---
Problem is the siphons never got used, even when they were cheap and stole a lot.
---
Evidently they need a bigger carrot. At that point, what can you do to them? Stealing isk from the corp/alliance wallet (lol)? 100% theft? FREE siphons? 
---
Even if you get over that hurdle you've likely created something which is so hideously imbalanced in favor of the "attacker" that it becomes difficult to justify its existence.
---
It happens to me occasionally. No idea what causes it
---
Are you mad, bro? I haven't told you how to play and made perfectly acceptable reasons as to why changes are needed. You've only been a sappy troll without any logic trying to save the one thing you enjoy in the game from having any risk involved. If you think anyone doing anything afk during Eve should have an effect on an entire system then you're just selfish and wrong. Period. To assume I'm a carebear shows exactly how insecure you are with yourself. You comment how I call you names, yet you do the same. I can add hypocrite now to the long list of terms you clearly are. Anything else? You've been burned more than I can count. You should walk away. Preferably a long walk off a short pier. But... since I now said that your ego won't let it go. Let's see how long it takes for your next attempt to try and justify your dignity so you can sleep in your parents basement at night.
---
They invaded in 2015
---
uh, spaces are important. we don't hold "excess" space. not since the casino war.
---
You can create a fitness corporation and do reps between depleted asteroids.
---
I use OBS to record my screen as well as streaming on twitch. Works perfect
---
tbh, we'd expect any other blocs, if there were any, to do the same thing were ccp to take such a massive dump on them like this
---
I mean, ive used this argument before, ill use it again; what if my town floods (this has happened at least once a year for the past few years causing significant damage each time) or what if my state is on fire ( California)?
---
Ah that explains it
---
I don't want to lose a ship because I drew wife aggro and had to look off.
---
You see, sometimes you find that perfect content that enlightens your soul but you don't have the sauce. Since you don't have the sauce, you are obligated to store in your PC to further analysis.
---
I mean, dudes in null need to earn ISK somehow, and not everyone can afford a rorq. VNI ratting, while boring as fuck, is the best way for newer players in null to get enough income to buy pvp ships and get blown up. Removing local will make the bots scripters have to jump through another hoop or two, but severely harm the ability of newer players in null to afford to play the game. 
---
Now, if local were to be removed in null, ratting sites should also be made efficiently doable in pvp fit ships. That way the ratter might have an option to defend themself other than just warping out. Currently, that's doable, but you usually sacrifice too much income to make it worthwhile. If CCP were to rework null ratting using the new AI with an eye toward incentivizing pvp fits in ratting, then I'd have no problem with killing local.
---
yeah, would be nice to see some officer fit marauders running l4's dying
---
Which regions are you expecting this to happen to? All the 'home' regions and most of the border regions of the null blocs are getting pretty much locked down currently due to them having numbers and a rotating roster to avoid burn out and infrastructure to enable rapid transit from hit system to hit system.
---
The only regions that would be 'freed up' are the ones no-one really wants anyways and due to this mechanic of drifters, singly TZ alliances simply cannot defend their shit due to it getting hit at 2am, then 3am then 4am then 5am etc. People can't stay up that late just to defend. Sure their timers are timed for their prime time, but the burn out and demorilization of the members at seeing all their shit reinforced, moon mining fracks canceled, building paused etc. It's going to result in them simply joining a mega bloc that has their shit on lock down already
---
I think this could probably work as a module that you can fit to HIC. Maybe uses heavy water, or liquid ozone to stay active.
---
Id switch tempest with phoon.  My loki can still tank under 2 heavy neuts because that ship is broken. Erm honestly cruisers bling and implants dude. Then links on an alt = yikers
---
Dude, use bridges! Get Test logi guys to get your network optimized. That's making it easier for us, being able to go everywhere with zero fatigue. I was doing anti-drifter shit for 12+ hours yesterday and didn't get any fatigue and was bouncing between three or four regions (honestly I lost count). Getting that backbone optimised makes this shit so much easier and removes jumping, fuel, fatigue and other stresses from an already fucked situation.
---
Which sort of gets to the idea of why play eve if it isn't fun?  The fighting isn't fun if the only reason people would fight is because they gain something from it.
---
&gt; if the only reason Drifters in null dont drop loot is that CCP didn't want to adversely affect WH economy perhaps Null Drifters should drop something different to their normal loot table 
---
wh drifters derive value primarily from blue loot, items that are sold to npc buy orders in k-space. While they can drop (a substantial amount) of wh salvage, the ratio is something like 300m in blue loot to \~30m salvage on a really good drop, with the ratio being closer to 300/5-10m for most drifters. 
---
The only effect it would have on the wh economy is from general isk inflation, so if they put them at about the same isk/ehp as like a haven or something i doubt you'd see anyone complain
---
Not red - don't shoot :/
---
Yeah - the main difference is that Irish don't know you can eat fish when the taters run out.
---
yes
---
Sorry, I didn't see that one. The parent comment was collapsed from being downvoted and I didn't bother to read it.
---
For other's reference:
---
&gt; Killmails with NPCs and Players both on it will ALWAYS show a player having the final blow, even if it was the NPC that killed him. An example of this was a time in Lowsec where I was tackled on a gate in a PVE ship by an Interceptor, he lost point on me and while in warp I got his killmail and it said I had the final blow, even though the gate guns did the killing.
---
I prefer polarized nightmare atm. I personally despise the raven and the mega but geddon &amp; phoon are great. Tempest is in need of some love i just see it as a piece of paper woth machine guns strapped to it.
---
Dominix is scary.
---
I fit my rokh with acs and rapid heavies because autism.
---
Honestly bhaals are so cheap its not even funny you should try them if you decide to get laser specs.
---
It was previously just a blops hunter tengu back when they were okay now they are trash since the nerf my other alts that are actually  useful are scattered around regions hunting logged.
---
Can’t play good if my body and mind are lacking energy, I do chill stretchy yoga, and XC mountain biking a few times a week, am literally a dad and am rocking the dad bod.
---
But my other half is almost done recovering from a set of corrective  operations that had them off the saddle, and now we getting back at it together.
---
It's cool carebear.  Go sit on a gate camp you risk averse coward.

Who watches shows about Eve?  
---
Come at me: https://zkillboard.com/character/2114457607/
---
Delve is a bit more condensed than eso/ps/feyth.  If you look on a map PS and Feyth are basically tubes, so there isn't really an efficient way to bridge them besides hub and spoke.  Bridges will get you most of the way there but at some point you usually have to make a jump.  Once we figured out rorquals it got a lot better, but there was a point where we were jumping around mostly in carriers and even one jump stacks up fast
---
Joining karmafleet starts the process of turning into a 4chan style neckbeard.
---
Check this guy's  ZKB. There are enough crazy solo kills that something like that is probably in there. So I think you can probably find something crazy like that. Looks like in the past day, he's lost two battleships today to the Snuffed Out battle Rorqual fleet that's been roaming the area (E-Uni had some particularly amusing conversations when one of our fleets encountered it).
---
[https://zkillboard.com/character/768915824/](https://zkillboard.com/character/768915824/)
---
Honestly, I'm pretty OK with Rorqual mining being really lucrative. The fundamental concept of having a capital-class mining ship in the field is really good.
---
The problem I have with it is that as usual, CCP went full feature-creep. Instead of changing the Rorqual from a boosting hull that didn't need to be in the field, to a boosting hull that did need to be in the field, they changed it to The Best Mining Ship In The Game.
---
I think a lot of stuff that's currently bad about the Rorqual would be fine, if it had been changed into a ship with INSANE boosts compared to what you could otherwise get. Because that way, exhumers would still be field leaders in yield. 1-3 rorqs in the field would be great, more would be a waste of characters.
---
If I could make an addendum to this post, it's that excavator drones should be deleted. Now that is where most people would leave it, but as I say, rorqs being strong is a really good thing. I think excavators should be converted into faction command bursts with insane yield bonuses. The problem with rorqs isn't that they're good, it's the fact that they eclipse, rather than augment, exhumers.

Hypothetically, what should happen if I can flip one TCU in a constellation? What happens to upgrades in the rest of the constellation?
---
Not casting judgement yet, genuinely curious.
---
What ships were you flying at the time?
---
i didn't because i honestly believe the best way to promote these changes is through the CSM, which is why I have sent the linked document to /u/Gobbins-/, /u/Olmeca_Gold/, and /u/Vily_R.
---
Realistically it would be dumb and naive to think I have all the answers. I actually think this year's CSM is incredibly well-equipped to approach CCP with knowledge and insight, perhaps more than any that has gone before. If there is value in what I have posted, I trust those guys to bring that to CCP and argue for it, or for something like it, or whatever.
---
Socratic wisdom is the ability to recognise what you don't know, or at least where your limitations might lie. Those guys have all played the game longer and harder than me; I'm just good at word vomit.
---
The Hunters become the Hunted.
---
I'm in Darkness. We don't use our supers.
---
Good question. Perhaps you make it harder for attackers if the defender has full upgrades. You have to flip all of them to neutral first before any can be flipped to another sov. 
---
If you're attacking an incomplete constellation it just flips to your sov.
---
This feels like a desperate attempt at the fitness equivalent of r/iamverysmart. r/iamveryfit, maybe?
---
ok, what makes it so that people can krab without local in wormholes, but not in null? Hole control is strong but you can secure gates also

Depends on the situation I guess. If you have 2m^3/s/m water moving through a dam, it's not accurate to say 2m^2/s
---
NICE
---
They are a different ID than the WH ones...
---
This is assuming that the Drifters are targetting those smaller alliances with equal threat as Goons or TEST.
---
Just needs a bit of a tweak to focus more Drifters onto larger alliances based on whatever arbitrary metric CCP deems useful. :shrug:
---
Actually sounds interesting....
---
Make roaming great again.
---
You'll see lots of corps taking holes with null statics.
---
That's excellent. I exercise with my significant others as well. Helps with motivation when you get called a lazy fatass or vice versa. Haha
---
Didn't answer my question, but you did make an interesting proposal (though not one I agree with).
---
If you own systems A, B, C, etc in a constellation. You have ratting and mining upgrades (for example) in system C. I flip system B. Do the upgrades in C still work, or are you just prevented from adding more upgrades?
---
Ninja Uitoh here, nice to know I'm remembered from back then :P
---
Gonna need a lot more connections between Constellations before this approach will work since there are many constellations that are just effectively entire pockets in and of themselves.
---
And let's be complete. If the situation were reversed, I wouldn't be complaining on Reddit.
---
Wasn't that what happened the last time Drifters had an incursion?
---
Hans, get the proteus
---
More like Goons from the past, back when they really were the 'fuck everyone else' kind.
---
They don't? Well that's a shame.
---
Can we have literally any context?
---
&gt;brave camped us for a week or two but no structures attacked
---
what a time to be alive
---
Finally, years of training in wormholes pays off
---
On one hand, the requirements are stupidly easy. On other, fuck this type of shit.
---
Anything that would clean up the litter of stations. Ccp has said it themselves they want highsec to feel like visiting the city and null should be an adventure into the desolate.
---
War is over. Test and frat are now blue
---

---
Seems like a good way for newbros to get some extra SP. 
---
Wait, I mean WTF CCP THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU DO THIS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
They can scram you the second they leave warp so you don't have the time it takes you to die, you have the time it takes them to decelerate from warp. The more you talk about this the more it sounds like you have not encountered them or fought them at all...
---
That does it. I'm never going to Delve. 
---
The music there sucks.
---
Funny, considering he openly admitted back then to never actually playing the game at all anymore. Why should he care?
---
Wait for it?
---
No workouts, but I kayak, windsurf, and still have my metabolism from when I was in university, soo... 🤷‍♂️
---
A group of players, USTZ Frat peers?, made a coordination channel. While inviting people they added MathewMN, who happens to be an XO of the corp Star Frontiers in Test alliance. Matt invited the SF CEO and other XO for the memes, and burning the nice intel instantly.
---
Yeah I'm into fitness, fitness whole pizza in my mouth.
---
lul tactical overlay isn't going to be a huge help when they land anywhere from 100-200 KM away from you and can point you from there, if don't have your screen turned at just the right angle to see them leaving warp you're screwed.
---
Perhaps upgrades happen on two levels. You can only upgrade systems to level 3 if you don't hold the constellation. Once you acquire the constellation and upgrade them all to level 3, then the constellation as a whole upgrades to 4 then 5 then 6.  
---
If Joe Pirate takes one of your systems all upgrades fall to level 3. I'm coming up with this as I go. You can help to. Hehe.
---
8 people for a system is pretty damn few.
---
But also, you don't need to keep that much of a schedule. Only the final timer really matters. Jus tlet them be reinforced outside your prime time. Then have your timers during your prime time.
---
There, we already optimized it to probably need only 2 people to cover a few systems.
---
And they don't even need to be in those systems or even online in eve. Just be ready to go.
---
Sure.
---
And we can argue whether they should have that many if they can't meaningfully defend them against such weak attacks.
---
let me ask you a question: whose more likely to burn out, the mega coalition in one region, or the same number of people spread out in the north over 6?
---
The core of your argument is valid, but your supporting evidence and anecdotes are shit.
---
JFs and freighters don't need buffs, just like Orcas never needed 1 million ehp afk mining fits.
---
Logistical overhead.
---
Most of the struggle comes from the real world management, travel time, coordination.
---
With smaller space, these issues are much much smaller.
---
Very easy for 1 person to Babysit a pocket of systems. Hard for a handful of people to babysit a region.
---
Especially in regards to handling timers. It becomes overwhelming and hard to manage if you have 200 timers coming out, even if you have 200 people ready. But a single person can handle 5 timers.
---
Look up cognitive overload.
---
It's the same with real world companies. Management becomes expone totally more difficult as the number of employees increases.
---
Fleet was sitting on a gate recently and being scanned by the Lancers.  One guy had a corpse in his ship and ejected it.  It was tractored into a Lancer
---
Oh, so you're one of those people that wants to make eve more casual?
---
Maybe if your alliance has all that space for making money they could pay the people for defending. 
---
And schedule those timers for prime time.
---
This isn't that hard.
---
Think outside the box a little.
---
Adapt or die.
---
You could just leave null
---
 The smarter people will make it.lovable for you.
---
Or get rid of asset safety
---
Hmm yes, how goes the farming of class size locked, with poorly implmented bands resulting in Worms online, with a dash of garmurs and navy comets, or the next step up where CDs eat everyone alive, and I assume kikis now too?
---
Maybe I should camp a super on the gate at 3000 km?
---
Sounds elite to me.
---
So....what's the point there?
---
There would be plenty of space.
---
And yes, clearly they just changed an underlying mechanic. Otherwise there wouldn't be so much salt.
---
I'm really glad I started recording, I just witnessed the most beautiful display of teamwork and fireworks.
---
A few users were using flying patterns, target painters, webifiers, and fireworks to create something beautiful.  I'll be uploading this for sure, I'll post it here when it's done.
---
Faction navies handle that.
---
My point is, if your argument is "nullsec should be as safe as highsec" I don't think you'll find too many agreeing with you.
---
yeah, that tends to happen when you send stupid forced pve after people
---
Waited like a good 10 minutes. If it didnt launch by then, its not launching.
---
Throw laptop/desktop?
---
This is a Serenity Closed Beta log in bonus event.  Put your Reeee away.

---
my vote goes for tristan
---
That's where the strategic fighting for space comes into play.
---
&gt;It's pretty pathetic to see pvpers begging for even more stuff.
---
Lol wat?
---
Listen I'm with you on the logging out in space. It's not a good idea to have the ship stay in space, but asset safety is just plain dumb. 
---
It has nothing to do with NPC space or highsec and everything to do with being just plain lazy. There are tons of ways you can protect your assets without stuffing them into a citadel. 
---
Wormholers do it. Why can't you? You have many many more tools available to you then wormholers have. What make you so special?
---
If you can't afford to lose it, don't have it or keep it somewhere safe. The end.
---
REEEEEEE  
---
 I cant

I've had that issue before as well. Closing and reopening Steam seems to work, though you might need to do it several times.
---
tbf i did the same to matt too and i was in his corp.
---
Interesting.     
---
Now tell me who's those smaller alliances that grabs the territory left by the larger ones.     
---
People spawning from nowhere?    
---
If goons has to cut the territory area size by two with the same population, is there a 2nd goons that can take the other half of the territory with same population? Will they be able to defend it?
---
Gooble gobble gooble gobble!
---
Matt fucked up
---
This feature already exists. Asset safety is partial in k-space, on TQ, right now. Go shoot engineering complexes and reactor-fit refineries. Get loot. You can do it today. Well, after nine days.
---
Real mens structure tank?
---
Get it?
---
You are not owed a PVP fight just for showing up.
---
It's not easy to kill drifters.
---
If these "quests" do not repeat once the character hits 5M SP I'd be fine with it.
---
Come join the Centi cult
---
Well that would make sense cause the original video for their release showed them sucking up the bodies
---
This seems like a really good way to boost new player retention.
---
The more new players eve gets the more angry bitter vets opinions get drowned out, seems like a win/win to me.
---
Nice
---
Real life talks about Eve is Canon in the Eveverse. Announcing enemy battle plans here in the out-of-universe would make it a canon event that players can plan for. If out-'verse is canon to in-'verse then any connections between the two are also canonically connected. So CCP as a canon connection then represents the whole of the Eve universe's collective knowledge on future events (short of player knowledge). They are basically commercials and the news.   
---
Therefore:
---
 If the in-'verse Eve has not discovered the battle plan of the Drifters, then out-'verse Eve cannot discuss it.
---
So as a small alliance:
---
1. Set timer base on prime tz, no tz tanking allowed.
---
2.Clean up drifter during prime tz, ignore other tz and structure shield.
---
3. Clean them by structure gunners in armor timer.
---
4. Problems solved, I guess?
---
EWWWW That looks...bad...like reallllllyyy bad.
---
Null sec players have asset safety.  Why can’t you wormholers play like we do??  We were here first you all play Eve wrong.
---
Natural progression
---
Wormholers are playing Eve wrong, that is their own fault.  Don’t try to drag everyone else into their misery.  Null sec was here first.
---
Just a bunch of NPCs doing what players could not
---
Yes to more loot, no to any asset Safety changes unless its just upping the cost to getting shit out of asset safety.
---
Sam  thought they could all be friends but this is eve, there are no friends.
---
From the magic bag of isk?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZONKoKIQ9RY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZONKoKIQ9RY) 
---
muh feels
---
From the trillions they make from ratters and mining taxes lol
---
Not sure if I should hope they do or not.
---
Make them drop an array of low-high implants of all different kinds. You know, from the corpses they use for their body's. That way there is useful loot they drop. Just a thought
---
Yeah, I agree. I think the novelty will wear off very quick.
---
As you can see from my stolen ping above, I fucked up and owned up to it. we all make mistakes nerds. Get back to your drifters and shit posting now &lt;3
---
eat my cock
---
*cackles maniacally*
---
You have come through my systems many times, but I am always paying attention so I get safe before you catch me. Although you did almost bump a VNI off tether one time.
---
&gt;The ESS is a good mechanic and promotes small gang.
---
The ESS mechanic promotes putting the ESS in an anomaly with max rats spawned so if anything short of a cap warps in it gets alpha'd before reaching the ESS to grab the isk.
---
They made citadels for the little guy, but since its all bigbois, their balance on the smaller side means after a while the bigger bois exploit it. If they want to tweak either end of the spectrum, it probably will go down the shitter somewhere. 
---
So for now, it seems they are going to instead prune the growth of the game. They cant reset it, all the nullbears will leave. They cant leave it to the players, because we will have serenity in less than a year. They just need to burn enough to let the cycle continue.
---
If your town floods the last thing you need to worry about is a video game. Get your priorities straight.
---
gas up the tunnel snakes and get me some whisky
---
TEST went south from Vale in 2016 to fight, Panfam attacked our space for funsies. TEST went to war with frat last year, NCPL/tri/skillu and everyone except goons came down to attack TEST. I can't imagine why they have buffer regions.
---
Its a giant sandbox. Part of the fun of game like ARK or Rust is coming back to it a week later and finding the ruin of your base. Starting over from scratch is part of the fun
---
Adding Matthew from test was 100% the better option than Matthew O'Hearn from VINDI.   
---
Love ya el jefe. &lt;3
---
Why do you think test has been the most destructive alliance in the last two years?
---
E. all of the above
---
20 years of local and ppl still bitching.
---
Depending on how many of us were there, either an Orthrus, Oracle, Omen Navy, or Osprey Navy.
---
Find the evelauncher.exe file and make a direct shortcut to it. Use that to launch rather than steam for now
---
"  If my entire EVE gameplay option for the next 1 or 2 or 3 weeks is human waves of npcs? I'd honestly play another game.  "   I've logged in twice to shoot drifters since this shit storm started and I won't be undocking a damn thing besides anti drifter fleets until this moronic event is over. Thankfully Final Fantasy XIV just dropped their new expansion this pas week and I've been loving it so far.
---
Fuck you and your RLML Cerbs haha
---
We would happily defend our space against actual players.
---
But you seem happy to sit on a sideline and cheer on NPCs.
---
When I used an Orca in null just to boost my skiffs I always had an improved cloak. Didn't bother with the headache of safing etc just warped the skiffs and tapped orcas cloak. 
---
Bans or 'frowns upon' on orcas in certain blocs with the mantra "orcas don't belong in null" always irritated the shit outta me because they just don't belong in the hands of retards.
---
It doesn't say specifically drifters?
---
Move to low sec and become pirates.  Is that still a thing?
---
You don't mine in sub caps much, do you?
---
Eve leaves launcher processes open in the background since an update a few days ago, if you are using steam that means that you need to open task manager and manually close it each time or it will still say eve is open.
---
&gt;A size that likely isn't justifiable.
---
Wow, so read all that and still missed the entire point? The size of current big block alliances is not only justifiable, but if this event continues for anything more than a short period of time alliances the size of goons, frat and test will become REQUIRED in order to fight off the drifters non-stop, meaning more big alliances, less small alliances and more empty space no one wants or inhabits...
---
&gt;  70m
---
you might lose a ship or 3.  In my neck of null, I haven't even heard of a drifter.  But me and you are small an inconsequential casualties.  T His will hurt the people who have 70B+ a lot more.  
---
And tbh, the game needs an isk sink
---
you huffed a whole can of paint before posting in this thread didn't you?
---
Ahh... playing the long game
---
Only if you don't plan on leaving your space to fight people during your primetime
---
Mathematical Bias Please Ignore
---
That this sucks for everyone, but sucks more the smaller you are.
---
Oh yeah mb, I just subconsciously assumed it was drifters. Too much reddit for today.
---
I’d be happy if his boulder fell on this post
---
If I didn't show up in local or dscan, couldn't be probed, could instalock and instascram with 22 points of warp disruption before I even come out of warp from 150 km away, could warp to pings I don't even have bookmarked,  and did 5,000 Omni DPS with perfect tracking, well I'd probably take more fights.
---
lol
---
&gt; The size of current big block alliances is not only justifiable
---
Apparently, not anymore. Unless you can keep up the defense. Adapt or die.
---
&gt; alliances the size of goons, frat and test will become REQUIRED in order to fight off the drifters non-stop
---
I disagree. We still don't know the full extent of the drifters attacks at all, and clearly larger alliances are having MORE trouble with the drifters than smaller ones are.
---
Make statements that make sense and I won't have to huff paint to try to get into the writer's state of mind.
---
Apparently not.
---
Smaller organizations aren't the ones complaining.
---
Smaller organizations seem to be saying that it's not too difficult. Just gunners in the structures easily handling it.
---
Wow, what a fun and engaging gameplay, you really showed those guys! You must be a very talented and smart FC!
---
Nice comp.
---
since when do you get faction hits, when killing MTUs?
---
Now I can make alts on the same account and not have to get the multiple training thing.
---
I’m 100% against asset safety, but arguments like this are exactly why it was implemented. Ccp wanted it so that if you decided you didn’t want to worry/care about the game, you wouldn’t lose all your stuff.
---
It's tongue-in-cheek.
---
"  and clearly larger alliances are having MORE trouble with the drifters than smaller ones are. " Yeah that's why the only two citadels dead so far to drifters belong to nobody corps and not goons or test... that makes complete sense.
---
For the scale of alliances that I set as background, defending ratter + fighting/roaming may be a little bit hard, but defending armour timer (by structure gunners) + fighting/roaming might be practical? 
---
(Just to be salty) Small alliances can no longer fight people by themselves anyway under this meta so this factor can be ignored LUL.
---
I wish it was post-under-boulder.
---
I wish I had known who she was trying to invite, so I could have changed my name.

---
There ya go.
---
If nullsec becomes a wasteland scoured by africanized drifters, there's not going to be much interesting gameplay.
---
Do you think nullsec players are just going to give up and go to other parts of space, or just quit the game?
---
That's why you zoom out
---
As someone suggested, Open Broadcaster Software(OBS) is a free alternative and only takes a little time to set it up. You can record video without any watermarks or caveats unlike Bandicam, aswell as streaming directly to Youtube/Twitch and any other platform that provides a streaming key. I've never had any problems streaming or recording content for Eve with OBS, and if you have any trouble the guys at CCP are really helpful.
---
What smaller null entities? 
---
Even if they really existed (renters don't count), a 30-40 man corp could defend one or two systems with a small number
---
of structures against this sort of thing.
---
&gt; Why does every meeting of Eve players look like a parade of the physically unfit? 
---
Because nerds?

What exactly am I looking at?
---
Because smaller groups maybe make strategic decisions about what to defend, not to mention those were structures already not being defended before the drifters.
---
Really, do you even hear yourself?
---
There you go. Look on the bright side
---
War Thunder here.. but you know? I'd really fucking like to go out and shoot at real people in eve.
---
It will probably be a weekly task
---
85k sp a week is nothing to high sp players. It won't matter
---
Seek professional help.
---
Makes sense. I really think CCP is going all Noah's ark/Thanos/Reapers storyline on new eden. 
---
Wouldn't be surprised if the drifters escalated to destroying everything even the gates and local on top of other structures, making null sec (or even all of New eden) literally go dark. Every one gets either cut off or thrown back into empire space. Then when the smoke clears, nothing of the old null sec is left and a new type null sec emerges from total destruction.
---
Clean slate. New unknowns. New systems? New mechanics? It just MIGHT lead to some interesting developments or player metas in the game.
---
Hmm..  maybe the fate of the Chinese server was a wake up call for them.
---
Imperium used it as an excuse to leave their current war engagement, but to me, having an entity reinforce structures non-stop seems like a great assist in an attack.  My understanding is they don't come back for the later timers, so if you aren't under attack by an entity you can mostly ignore the drifters.    
---
To me it seems Imperium should have kept the assault going and utilized all the free reinforcing to glass the region even faster.  
---
Is there something I'm missing that makes me wrong, I'd honestly like to know.
---
Pull-up just to flex on these hoez.
---
The ship balance bits are honestly the least important bits in the game right now. Structures and to a lesser extent, sov, are what really need attention.
---
I've had the paid version of Bandicam for years.  Yeah, I know it's been memed, but the paid version is actually good, and it works for what I need it for.
---
While the free version does have a watermark, the paid version doesn't.  The watermark is what was memed.
---
Just...wow.
---
What was your PI setup?
---
Where do you roll at?
---
Or just dont have them drop anything because the last thing we need in this game is more farmable endless isk.
---

Nice, Sharpen Iron Academy in the States here.
---
&gt;  they wont get smaller
---
unless all the carebears cant mine and rat. if thats the case membership will move back to highsec.
---
Let's be honest. If CCP resets Nullsec at this stage most folks will just leave.
---
And it always falls short. Just like this post.
---
right now its not a huge incentive to remove existing structures but reading about it, it seems like it would be pretty hard to anchor any new structures if drifters can one shot them during anchoring.
---
if you live in an area so unstable that floods and fire will disable you for time scales of weeks, keep your assets in a station.
---
oh look, they are bringing back a feature they already pulled once because it was a failure.
---
remind me, what's the definition of insanity?
---
I disagree.  
---
Music is pretty dope.
---
Can you run the numbers on PVP encounters over the last 8 days vs the 8 days prior?  That's the number I think will be most telling about the event.
---
In their defense, they didn't know the extent to which the Drifter attacks would lead. At first it did feel like an all hands on deck, recall the war machine to defend the homeland kind of thing. Within a few days, we knew otherwise, but needing (using) supers to defend the attacks means that you need an umbrella to defend the supers. GSF would have had to use subcap fleets to defend their structures as they (probably) didn't have enough capitals at home to defend against dread bombs. A few supers can deal with any drifter attack, whereas a subcap fleet needs to be much larger and more organized, and also takes longer to get people into fleet and then off to desto. Using supers simply requires less (immediate) manpower.
---
and there was no asset safety in Null when WH's were introduced, whats your point.
---
no u
---
Looking through your comments I never saw you complain about the trig invasion adding a new source of isk to the game.. Seems hypocritical to me
---
Depends on whether or not CCP bends the knee to Goons with the highsec embargo
---
You’re right, the god emperor would never bend
---
Its just standard reddit rumors they are mixing wh drifters with K space drifters and hurr derr'ing it out as facts
---
No ones bitching about the trig invasion, and like 200 people live in high sec, maybe? Probobly less to be honest
---
Highsec is 75% of the games active player base
---
Really pushing for a good response
---
I think cloaking would just become the new meta if your ship stayed in space.
---
You've never been to high sec then lol. 90% of high sec is a barren wasteland with no one in it.
---
&gt; what's the definition of insanity?
---
Playing Eve.
---
So is nullsec.
---
Having "just constellations" is not plausible due to the way regions are designed. If you have "just constellations", your neighbors can hotdrop your ratters/miners with complete impunity, all it takes is a blops on the undock of a citadel or in a safe in their space.
---
Nobody lives where it's unprofitable to do so, being constantly dropped makes it unprofitable to live in null, so you find ways of making it profitable. So how do you resolve this threat? Well you could kill them and take their space, so now you have more than a constellation. You could NIP them and have a gentleman's agreement about not dropping each others ratters/miners and not cloaky camping because now both sides can mine/rat in peach. Now you've just blued another alliance.
---
Eventually, the equilibrium becomes holding the entire region, because if you don't, it makes utilizing that region much harder.
---
Nullsec is what, 10 times the size of high sec?
---
No its not, it looks larger but has significantly less systems
---
Do you want fries with that?
---
Either way the point is. 90% of people in jita and amarr are peoples alts. The only true high sec people  that only do high sec. They are a dwindling breed, there's very few left. Maybe 200 in total real breathing people.
---
Drifters are cool but I hope they add some other faction npcs with similar mechanics and let players help or attack them depending on their standings. Then we can also get these giant AI battles as well.
---
The patch that added HAW weapons and made capitals get crazy good was when this game went downhill. It has been worse ever since then. EVE was better back when subcaps and regular caps were more important then mass supercaps.
---
You will, however, lose target lock when the blue band shield is depleted, and when you  retarget them they will show full health without the blue band on the shield.  They also shield rep but not very fast.
---
I have the same problem, i just logout of my PC and log back in, pretty sure you could find a process in task manager to close it too if logging off is too inconvenient.
---
Im not a 100% against asset safety, im against automatic asset safety.
---
Asset safety needs to be manually triggered and cost around 25-50% of the items going into safety. Obviously there needs to be mechanics that prevent abuse by the players and their should be a way for Corp leads to place a players items in safety in case of emergency like natural disasters.

No, CCP is just a bunch of incompetent fuckwits, each locked in their own "department" responsible for something else, at best barely communicating with one another and at worst actively fighting one another for resources and privilege and money of Daddy Hillmar.

Ninja salvaging can be a wildly entertaining, rewarding and accessible venture for a new player. It's gotten so good lately not that bad a pursuit for a seasoned player.
---
That's a woman
---
You forgot the part where I said I'll send him the bot via eve mail...  
---
AHAHA
---
Your stuff can has?
---
mmmmmm makes you want to be the middle of a trig, drifter sandwich!!!
---
no content is better than crap content.
---
:D
---
Sounds familiar
---
Well unless you warp there in a pod, slowboat to ESS, wait out the timer and return with a ceptor to grab the can real quick.
---
Now everyone on reddit knows my secrets thanks guys
---
is the main system in null, or is this just one of those "this system is within 3 jumps of the high sec spawn so it's now got trigs in"?
---
cos a lot of low sec systems get trig invasions this way.
---
no, it's not that. it's pure stupidity. if anything, it's pushing eve TOWARDS serenity. we need player content drivers, not forced pve bullshit.
---
By that token,  you can log off in a system to hang tatters.  Problem solved.
---
Am i a highseccer when i'm not in my hole even when i left null to go to wh space? 🤔
---
&gt;I’m 100% against asset safety, but arguments like this are exactly why it was implemented. Ccp wanted it so that if you decided you didn’t want to worry/care about the game, you wouldn’t lose all your stuff.
---
Are you against ships being removed from space during logoff?
---
ramming a merlin with an arty wolf rofl
---
well you should have not done the abyssal stuff. I told you, don't need to be in every hole, don't need to poke the bear
---
nobody is "hoarding" space. it's a goddamn boogeyman made up by grr null hiseccers/WHers. trust me, space gets used. if you see space that's not begin ratted, etc, that doesn't mean it doesn't serve a strategic purpose, whether it be a buffer, etc.
---
&gt;It's not a good idea to have the ship stay in space, but asset safety is just plain dumb.
---
Could you shed some light on \*why\* it's not a good idea to leave ships in space?
---
Is it the value of the ship+mods? The killmarks it has? The fact that it has your pod in it? The (low) level of effort to kill+loot a ship compared to killing and looting a citadel?
---
Never forget:
---
https://twitter.com/HilmarVeigar/status/1144933511901696000?s=09
---
Why? The larger null blocs are the size they are because of certain elite PvP types penchant for farming the little guys until they implode.
---
One thing that CCP mentioned at Toronto was that it was really hard to create a cyno inhib effect around something that could move and have the server still handle it *but* a module like bastion stops movement anyway so that could be a possibility (or another module that creates an anchoring effect).
---
I lift, bro.
---
You can always try to bomb them on a hole, I think a Astero will shred you with it's drones before your torps apply. You could try with rockets.
---
Yes, we did.
---
Not so bright for CCP.
---
I mean I haven't flown a dual rep mega in a while but i recall you can tank about 1k dps with a t2 fit and some drugs.  Maybe you put idk faction reppers, will probably push to 1.1-1.2k   
---
Two buffer fit prots should put out about 1500-1600 cold which coupled with the mega's ehp of about 70k or so -  should see you down after the heat becomes unmanageable, which is about 1-2min + the time it takes to grind through your ehp, which is another 2-3 minutes. Boring, but not like "endless".   
---
However my estimations are based on my own experiences and also this rep fits are very susceptible to the other dudes having 1 extra dps which totally ruins your day.   
---
I'm not trying to rain on your fight here, I'm just a bit envious because most of the engagements i find are usually blinged fleets of 5-10 people and sometimes I see this clips of fightst like these it's frustrating :D
---
Very good points. I love the idea of no guns on citadels. Two main issues I have atm is low power citadels having teather and guns. If they lp, make em only good for docking and looking out the windows. Also, I think that citadels in null shouldn't have asset safety. Or well they should but it should be a rig you put on that allows it to jump the stuff to the nearest citadel. Alternatively you can make it so it jets all the cans and you can scram them before they warp off to safety. Kinda like the old hacking system.
---
Tl:dr ur gay pwned

Gotta be honest all this stuff sounds pretty par for the course for eve. Why should we care?

Nah, the foothold system is Orvolle, which is a 0.7 system,  it's neighboring system is PF- and FD-
---
What’s wrong with rating aligned?
---
I'm curious, what's the median number of structures per system in TAPI's regions?   Also, how long do drifters loiter at a benign celestial (asteroid belt / planet with nothing to shoot), before moving on?

---
Shoulder reconstruction sucks.
---
Yep, why do null sec entities need so much space anyway? Epeen? God forbid they shrink a little.
---
Only the mega carebears that literally only mine or anom rat. Or should I just say alts? Lol
---
Only the one that are "leaching" or barely doing any alliance stuff anyways. So yes some will give up cuz afk orca mining in hs is easier. But the bulk wont change.
---
Your renters would be upset
---
Is gay for jay
---
Unregistered Hypercam
---
I don't think CCP ever intended one alliance to hold an entire region, which is why we're going through this Drifter event. It's already peace and love in null. Most have to travel insanely far just to find a fight.
---
Plus systems could have cyno jammers, and if we're changing Eve we may as well change the effect of caps vs sub-caps.
---
I think the idea is to bring back small fleets and more action to the region.
---
God damn XD angry kiddo incoming

Good riddance you fuckwad

At least you know to avoid it. Rather than the alternative.

---
Gay for jay
---
training cov-ops is never a waste of skill points.
---
atm there are 395 alliances with more than 150 characters, out of which only 105 have sov, that leaves 290 alliances without sov and thats without any big group splintering. There are plenty alliances that want space. Goons dont need to splinter, they have cramped 40k people in a single region, by all means this shouldnt be feasible and they should expand. Also noone would give their good regions, GOTG wouldnt abandon deklein but pure blind, frt wouldn't abandon detorid but the rest of scalding and maybe portions of wicked and so on, so small groups could grab those systems and try to grow, that would be the case with healthy mechanics.  
---
Right now the only thing those small alliances do, is join a random superpower that they have some connections or are easy to apply to, and krab under supercap umbrellas and whatnot.
---
You mad, tho?
---
Would be a contract scammers paradise in null.
---
love those 2 magus clips at the start lmao
---
The tweet by ccp (which take as a grain of salt because it's ccp) is they are being pushed back to kspace
---
This is a great thing for new players. Good lord you should get a reward for doing to mindless things in eve past isk
---
I've never had to deal with Toni, and can't say that I've ever had an issue with amarria or samuel, and i run incursions a fair bit.
---
they've always both seemed ok to me.
---
&gt;The Imperium in general claims to be a place that doesn't care about killboards but you lose a lot of excavators and suddenly everyone is on you
---
consider the following: if you're losing a lot of excavators they might be on you because you're consistently and repeatedly fucking up and being shit while showing no signs of improvement? that has nothing to do with killboards.
---
Haters gonna hate! It was fun.. Droppin on nerds who were hunting for easy kills back in Delve. We are back bitches.
---
The point is, it’s hard enough to avoid instalocking arty Lokis cloaked 40km off a novice. 
---
The only current counter is to die to them and then set them red so you know to avoid them in the future. Without local that becomes impossible and FW becomes even more dead
---
But do they yeet?
---
nice variety of salts today, different flavors are always welcome
---
That was amazing! +3
---
Incase anyone forgot, people in high sec are getting killed by the drifters too
---
Very interesting perspective of seeing things. A good read.
---
Contract all ur stuff to elise densi ingame and i move it out safely i promise
---
Only if you could bomb some frigate or shitfit jackdaw
---
Otherwise just fly an astero, or don't be so cheap, get a loki
---
 ***I have already prepared my counter-proposal. It reads thusly: He may strategically place his wonderful lips upon my posterior and kiss it repeatedly!***

He means with him
---
See if i were a hiseccer i would know that.
---
Did he scam your asset after kicked you?
---
This is the salt I was looking forward to :)
---
I’m a null/lowsec guy all you have to do is look at zkill very simple
---
Yet here you are on reddit having a discussion about eve..
---
Finally, someone gets it.
---
Covert ops is really enjoyable in small groups, might have better luck killing targets with friends.
---
Maybe a pvp fit astero, or T3 destroyer is your trying to be solo and get small stuff.
---
I only go to zkill when i'm lookin for somthin specific sorry.
---
even if i believe u i already sold it sorry sweety
---
I did, it was lovely, went to the lake, had a swim read a book
---
Don’t be sorry, just track it. They’ll come for you too.
---
I care
---
Lame
---
OK Guys. Mostly im in a Astero. But If targets we're bigger i cant afford them. So i thought about sb. But i had also a look at t3 desty and cruisers. 
---
Thx guys
---
How many excavators did you lose?
---
Have you tried losing less?
---
Imagine never paying to your ingame menu where this option is and has nothing to do with steam?
---
Drifters already be here in wh.
---
and you don't think there would be a mass exodus of players if everything they own in null just disappeared?
---
This is fucking glorious. Much better than I hoped for. Thank you.
---
Fuck how did I miss this piece of gold hahaa
---
The number is in the 40s from what I could count on zkill.  That of course assumes he didn't lose any to Olmeca.
---
major audience shifted from casual( **Fitness** friendly) towards hardcore no-life nerds with addiction problem and lack of any kind of social activity.
---
Your POV is interesting.    
---
So the biggest alliance need more expansion, but at the same time they should be the one most affected by the new drifters. While other  smaller alliances need to shrink and give place to even smaller ones.    
---
While actually consider that the best way of fighting them is to have a more dense population, I do not feel that will happen.
---
"The Imperium in general claims to be a place that doesn't care about killboards but you lose a lot of excavators and suddenly everyone is on you"
---
We also claim to be a place where we'll mock one another mercilessly for damned near any significant fuckup. Ask Thomas 'Lear Death Experience' Lear.
---
Ain't about the killboard, dude, it's about the repeated fuckups.
---
Oh this is going to be good
---
&gt;but you lose a lot of excavators and suddenly everyone is on you

What are the ways to make 200mil/hour?
---
this does not even remotely surprise me based on past experience.
---
We lost count of the number of times you refused to listen or follow advice about how to improve your chances of survival. That speaks a lot to the character of a player and their ability to be a part of a greater whole. Best of luck in your future endeavors.
---
Miss y'all 😭😭😭
---
A full combat (armor rigs, no relic scanner) Astero is fun, Try a Strat next.
---
Two words invalidate all that : jump gates
---
Frigate abyssal runs can make 1 bil an hour.
---
My comment was a joke I'm already a solo pilot in FW area
---
&gt;...and add the use of chat scraping bots to the eula and ban them.
---
I can't tell if you mean bots watching the local memberlist, or if you're talking about programs that monitor your chat logs.
---
The former should already be covered, the latter would be moot on top of being impossible to enforce. In the latter case, it'd be far simpler to just remove the option of logging ingame chat. If there's a valid reason for having the logs available to players, CCP could create an endpoint to publish the chatlogs they undoubtedly keep.
---
No i did not say smaller alliances need to shrink, you assumed that and please can this bullshit of "small alliances cant defend their stuff" go away please, if you have 5 systems with 10-15 structures it is seriously easy to fend off drifters with nothing but bombs. The problem is on big alliances that have to do like 30-40 jumps to cross their space to defend an overextended structure. Also small alliances do not have structures bigger than astrahus unless they a) have a big batphone b) are dumb to drop a fortizar and lose it to nearby entities that want content. And in the end of the day what is an astrahus loss, if space is to be cleared out of useless low power structures. Also density should make things even worse imho, if you kill 40k rats per day or have 20 structures, those systems should be hit nonstop until they normalize. OFC all these arent going to happen and this is just a gimmick event that everyone reeee's his opinion.
---
I love Drifters , so does every player ever bullied by null sec gate camps and politics .
---
To be clear, are you saying that being the metaphorical bowling pin is bad?
---
Holy crap that gif is amazing.  Laughed for about ten minutes straight lol
---
okay then probably shouldn't discuss under the original post.    
---
The ideas are now very different :)
---
You're doing it wrong.
---
pretty good ideas - thumbs up!
---
and yes CCP give Blops a covert ops cloaking device!
---
I'm just imagining having to hire a bowler to clear a path to high traffic gates and stations.
---
Well, holding back the sperg is not exactly what I would call "appeal to highsec".
---
I still can't imagine a message to HSers about nullsec problems that doesn't make me laugh tbh.
---
Gross
---
All entirely moot because you'll then have a Citadel on every gate grid with an Alpha Clone bot sitting there tethered watching its Overview.
---
Chuck this thread into Reddit and the Goons come up like hungry fish.
---
Why would I be against it. Imo removing this feature would kill a bigger part of the game
---
r/eve cries way too hard and too many people trying to fish for upvotes. 
---
Poor ccp
---
Yeah, skill training provides no benefit to Internet spaceships and core gameplay. Same as walking in stations. If anything they merely hinder you - a lot!
---
I wouldn't mind a remap system instead where you have to consider trade-offs and strengths though. That would at least be vaguely interesting.

Curious as a maybe returning player (trying to motivate friends). Are they popping up everywhere ? Are they somehow predictive ? Can they be beaten with small group ? Thanks ;)
---
Usually it's because they're bigger retards than the ones they're trying to hunt. Which is impressive, given the sheer amount of idiots present in Delve.
---
Mmhh I am doing that at the moment and I'm doing 50 mil an hour in tier1. Will progressively move up in tiers.
---
What ship and filament do you recommend? I have skills for missiles, drones and shields.
---
You become a beard? Or you have one on you?
---
i didn't know a female otter was called a bitch thanks for that
---
Nice work!
---
1. This is the only valid point. Still mitigated by DScan.
---
2. Still has to enter the system at some point.
---
3. Any solution that counts on people not making more alts is laughably DOA.
---
The only way removing local would work is if you made Stargates spawn you in a random location in the target system instead of directly on the other side of the gate.
---
You're a bitter little man aren't you?
---
Hue
---
&gt; In essence, this is CCP's look at how the sandbox is metad by its inhabitans. The proving, has been going on since the game released. Fleet comps, alliances, empires, coalitions and so on. The natural progression of the sandbox lends to where serenity landed. The full life and death cycle. 
---
Some of it really has been bad game design and could have been avoided and/or addressed.
---
You want a problem or what, suchara
---
&gt; if by spammed you mean too full to be a useful intel tool perhaps that is the idea.
---
No chat log parser would care how busy the channel is. 
---
If it's too busy to be human-readable, then even more people would move to the tools that parse chat logs for intel.

Why didn't you just link the link..?

---
&gt; 1.i. The first timer would still be uneventful. But now its straight to final timer which would be a huge risk. Yes panfam did fight on x47 hull timer BUT they disengaged very early not only cause they were trading badly but also because they had to extract all those supertits in time.
---
If you can't defend a timer, why should you get to keep the outpost or even your ships? All this risk aversion bullshit needs to stop.
---
&gt; also, citadels were made to replace posses and outposts. has nothing to do with big or small
---
Yeah, but their stats were geared towards possibility of owning and maintaining them with a small group of folks that has limited TZ coverage and lacks standing fleet constantly ready to defend. As a result they have in-built defense measures which become stupid when the structure is used by relatively large entity that has all those nice things, as well as resources to build a few structures more just in case.
---
So yeah, I think it has something to do with big/small.
---
Read Reddit, listen to mittens.. XD
---
all sec should b no sec. all ship should b no bot. all structure should b player structure. all timer should b no timer
---
:]
---
I didn't have enough popcorn while reading the chats.
---
You're 100% right, we should do absolutely nothing as nothing will ever fix this right? The game is currently healthier now then it was back then therefore no change is necessary?
---
This sounds great. Reward players for actually playing the fucking game. Where's the problem?
---
Sat
---
That would still open up the opportunity to pull of logoff traps rather than have every character, bot or not, scurry to safety before you even load grid.
---
Why didn't you just say oh my fucking God did you really need to alert him to your failures twice
---
Nah, most hunters use NPC Kill Delta on dotlan to see where they want to go.
---
Free intel is cool for hunters though.
---
That much should be pretty obvious
---
Where in my OP do you see either the word "local" or "chat" appear?
---
YouTube media content creator here. You will not violate any laws of ccp but be aware to not give free Intel to people online.
---
If you record a video or you stream it pay attention to the information you give in the video. Local chat / system name / dscan / overview (the structure name contain the system name and the gate linked to the system are free Intel). 
---
Be aware that people could find Intel about a super that is ratting (or things like that) and that you could be the one to blame for the free Intel.
---
Asking people before recording then is always a good thing.
---
Yaaaaaaaaawn

What is eve doing to me? Doctor said i  had to cut down on the salt!!! But it just tastes so damn good

I'm genuinely mystified. Do you not agree that smallgang and solo PvP is almost nonexistent or extremely unviable with the current gameplay mechanics?
---
:popcorn:

Holy shit you’re one dumb mother fucker like always Smuff. The reason you’re not in is my guess is because you were being a toxic shit which is hard to do by karmafleet standards. Do us all a favor go get a real life get a job and education what ever the fuck it is you want to do and better yourself you doing this shit and trying to throw other people under the bus because you didn’t get your way makes you the vindictive bitch. Also I’m not the biggest fan of Sam or Amarriah but I can guarantee you they have done more for goons than you ever will because of your toxic personality so kindly go away and leave us with our internet space ships.

Needs more rogue drones

I hope drifters go all the way and destroy all null sec...gona grab some popcorn  and watch  all blobers tears...adapt or die.reporting from npc station.captain yamato hehehehehe

I'm not annoyed about drifters I'm annoyed that they are showing how much content is out there that it utterly unreachable to real people due to how the game currently works.

Let me guess the age of the one posting here: 13 years old max.!

last night in Semiki (0.6) Drifter battleships had a short fight with True Sansha Nightmare battleships, then Sansha BS warped out after killing one Drifter BS, few seconds later a fleet of Trig ships came , Vedmaks and Damaviks. It was awesome!
---
Wasn't slowcat doctrine getting more dominant at the time anyway?
---
Indeed I do. Is it justified? I really don't know. We will have to wait and see how their event turns out. If it's in fact a lore based change of mechanics of local, sov ect. then it would be really nice, but at the current time we cant really know if this is going to happen or not.

---
Sure, if you're encountering a lone bot. If you're in a system with more than 3 or 4, and assuming the player running said bots isn't a total idiot running them in a 100+ AU system, odds are pretty good that you'll be on *someone's* DScan the moment you log back in.
---
If it were me, I'd also drop a DDA for a Warp Core Stabilizer to counter cloaky tackle and Force Recons as slightly lower ticks is better than losing a ship and no ticks.
---
please stop posting this garbage

"(...) pushing eve TOWARDS serenity (...)", "(...)forced pve bullshit(...)" sounds remarkably close to what Imperium's idea of 0.0 warfare is actually...

This was the case LONG before drifters.
---
oh I agree completely, although T3Cs, particularly  the Legion can fit a pretty insane buffer tank. Wont help against a gang, but then a BS wont either so well.
---
it was nice knowing you.
---
It's funny because none of them are self aware to see that
---
I think I heard that before.
---
Nah. We'll just end up with the drifter and the triglavians in low sec fighting each other, a couple of systems will be the "frontline" these systems will be theme parks of gameplay, you pick a side and run a load of missions for mediocre rewards. It's just gonna be the same stuff as usual. More rubbish pve content stacked ontop of all the ancient broken content.
---
Looks like 48 on zkill lol
---
&gt; Don't be a blobcuck, leave Legacy.

Leave a group with enough manpower to reasonably distribute workload between its members and avoid burnout, join small corp that will have to sit 24/7 watching over their astra.
---
Sound plan you have there.
---
I'm a simple man; I see dune, I upvote
---
Instead of just handing out sp, they should be balancing the sp required for each ship... Just handing out sp isn't the answer to the new player problem. Perception not having to train for over a year to be competitive is one of the issues, that needs removing.
---
Honestly, if it's a new-player focused thing, I'm all for it.
---
Newbees are full of enthusiasm and want to explore what Eve has to offer, but they're extremely limited by the real-time skill training system.
---
Seems like this would be giving them milestone rewards for undocking and doing things out in space. All of these are good things for everyone.
---
Well yes, but they are human developers, and they face other humans out developing ways to game their system.
---
It is a sandbox game, and theres only so much you can do to make it exciting and playable when the dust has settled and everyone found the best way to go about things. 
---
Instead of constantly trying to tweak things here and there and hope theres a breath of life for a few months or so before its all gamed again, this way they can basically "clean the slate" without telling everyone hey we let you play for years of gametime and its going away, sending many subscribers from logging in
---
As I said, no confirmation. Wasn't reddit I heard from, but my source (not ccp) said it had changed.
---
Incursions, or the new invasions. T4 abyss can make over 100m/h
---
They’re crazy enough to have laid out this path years ago. Great read.
---
Omg are you telling me people will have to actually play and undock?
---
That sounds like something awful....
---
&gt; If ccp want stir up null, this in not good idea.
---
Where did CCP say these drifters were specifically to "stir up null"? Seems like they just want to punish people for spamming more structures than they have the mans to protect.
---
&gt; Smaller organizations aren't the ones complaining.
---
Because they have smaller representation, so you don't hear people.
---
Gunners can handle attacks on structures (unless some drifter decides to bug there), but that still requires you to have total TZ coverage even medium-sized groups may lack, and on top of that only very trusted people counts as "coverage" for this purpose because anyone who can be a gunner can also effectively dismantle your structures. Also, you have to fight drifters outside of structure range to keep your space useable. That all together becomes much more of a problem.
---
You're a retard. 
---
Like most inbred wormholer  trailer trash.
---
Imagine being an autistic screeching whiny bitch that's upset that people like using their titans and supers to defend their space. 
---
Bring titans and supers for your next roam into delve.
---
Is this channel still a thing? I am still not in it if so... but that's okay by me, one less channel on discord = 1 step closer to being free.
---
Bombers Bar
---
&gt;easy kills in delve
---
ok
---
Can confirm, all I'd do is meme and mute the channel anyways.
---
aaaaaawww  ...did your bots get burned?
---
pvpers that roam get 1 shot by drifters. no need to defend.
---
Or when Trigs threaten anything not specifically put in line for them.
---
Not a bad idea, bombers are used alot in many areas. If you do solo bomber hunting in wormholes, be very selective with your targets. Stick with mining/industrial ships, myrmidons and other ships with a high signature radius. You can watch WiNGSPAN videos on youtube to get an idea of tactics aswell..
---
Given the values and text, they match up with the first two tiers in the Activity Tracker:
---
Combat &gt; Non-Capsuleer &gt; Destruction
---
I think it's more likely that they're looking to give one-time milestone rewards to players for completing what are basically Achievements rather than bringing back the old "Eve Daily Quest" shenanigans.
---
That would be a pretty big boon for new players, who are full of enthusiasm but are very limited by the real-time skill training system. The SP amounts are a drop in the bucket for veteran players, though a free 1.3-to-2ish days of training (depending on mapping) isn't *nothing*.
---
If that's the case, bring it on imo
---
They are not, but then again asset safety does not exist in WH. If you lose your structure(s), you lose everything.
---
Completely agree but this is a quick fix that encourages people to undock and pew. The other would take quite a few man hours to implement.
---
We can go to them! We can make peace!
---
Doubtful. The only thing worth doing in high sec are level 4 missions, incursions and station trading. That's about it.
---
This makes sense, not some memes or CCP. If they planned it to go like this, it is elegant and interesting, but I doubt it. Take a lot of guts to destroy all of nullsec, pushing everyone in highsec, which will inevitable make 80% quit and/or be unsubbed while this lasts and is complete.  
---
If they go full throttle for this some alliance leaders will be butthurt to see their empires collapse and will not reform them from scratch again which is cool I guess.  
---
Problem is, how many will return to play the game after this 'purge' is over? And who will pay subs for the devs, while the game is being 'reset'?
---
Who would win? X Loki or X+1 titans
---
I also really dislike the idea of punishing players for having a life outside of the game.
---
Problem is, bots can be taught to react to specific things in their overview. In fact, that's how their basic operation is ensured, except they don't have code to flee from drifters yet.
---
And once the code is updated, bots will have much faster reaction, actually being able to warp off most of the time if they are aligned. Humans are actually at disadvantage here, just as they are when it comes to any task you can formalize to elementary logic.
---
Calisthenics :)
---
Hawks

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
And another cyno hunter is born
---
What if instead of the Matrix its the Happening and the AI attack you based on the size of your blue list...
---
Another great Hartley vid. always love seeing the Goon hammer drop. :p
---
It’s not terrible, my only real complaint is a lot of the high value stuff - you just can’t attack in meaningful ways because of torp application. It gets a little better with the calefaction rig, painter, and missile precision script. Still not great, however.
---
Nothing really, but the point is, you need to react and warp off immediately. Bots will be much better at this kind of thing once they are updated to recognize drifters.
---
There to make money, not spend it. Had no issues.
---
Does this imply that CCP are actually drifters?
---
Actually we formed in bridged in the killed loki fleet and docked all in 10 mins, but nice narrative.
---
Schadefreude is real
---
hawt
---
Tier 5 abyssal sites are actually a ton of fun and not too bad in hawks if one of you can play 2 accounts. The fit is cheap too, about 70M
---
Less materials mean prices go up in jita
---
You know with some proper target calling and FCing you could have probably killed a good chunk without dropping supers? Would've made this video a lot better. Instead its just another blobb
---
Drifters are definitely not only targeting systems with lots of structures, I have been defending citadels in systems with only a single structure in them
---
Got a fit?
---
Trading. Mining in rorq. Abyss. Super ratting
---
I still see fatigue as something relatively new. It's crazy how much time has passed since then.
---
I glad you missed how that was tounge n cheek but grr blobbers is cool to.
---
&gt; I never thought I'd miss station games.
---
I guess stations games are better than no games.
---
So drifters aren’t actually invading null, they are just running from the trigs? Maybe we will be able to Blue them after all, and work together to fight the trigs
---
When I hear "Centi", Sansha are still the first thing that comes to my mind, even when it comes to associations with a player alliance.
---
Excellent writeup and working.
---
I was with you right up to the second to last paragraph  ....which unfortunately seems to conclude the total opposite.
---
From everything you have said the existence tax (love this btw) will certainly push those man hours to concentrating on smaller space but EVERY alliance will do this which will give many small 'home' systems.
---
TBH if this is the case then this will be a great conflict driver and space which is worked for will feel truly owned and worth working for.
---
WP CCP.
---
Why bother ? We have plenty of supers to kill them delve isn't for your gud fites m8 7o.
---
It's super effective
---
was a fun evening - even if we lost hard xD
---
Year before you can effectively fly kestrel? Bro, you can get into hacs in prolly 3 months...
---
Your approach, taken extreme, would lead to titan online where every fight is between titans. Not the even mention THIS GAME IS MEANT TO BE HARD.
---
&gt; How’s low sec, empty?
---
not dead, but not fully alive either
---
&gt; What’s the small gang PvP world like?
---
kity stuff and the new triglavian ships. In Null it gets supers dropped on you.
---
&gt; Is FW relevant for good fights?
---
You'll get small fights better than in Null
---
&gt; Is Sov all that’s left?
---
well, yes. Many smaller corps have moved to wormholes and do their thing from there
---
I glad you comprehend how hard this was to pull off all, 2 brain cells I used in the planning of this was pretty peak meta.
---
wew
---
Provi is great for smallgang/solo stuff. 
---
Lots of stuff going on in black rise FW space, I can usually get a few fights there 
---
Haven’t actually spent much time outside of those places because why bother looking for new stuff when they are good enough, but I’ve talked to a lot of other people who like to roam in pure blind, so there must be something in that area. I also went to syndicate a couple times and there was a decent amount of action, but I only went like twice, so I can’t say anything for certain.
---
&gt;If nullsec becomes a wasteland scoured by africanized drifters, there's not going to be much interesting gameplay.
---
i beg to differ lmao
---
evict the ones that have rooted themselves way to deep into null and allow for a fresh start
---
Dead Loki fleet 30 bil, another wormholes tears... priceless.
---
Right?
---
i prefer to use my colonists and ~~organ vats~~ prisoners for that
---
If you think inner hell go for anything other than low hanging fruit you are a simpleton.
---
Probably incursions in highsec since you can’t fly caps
---
the more im around mittani and in goons the more i realize hes a well moron mostly.  
---
this drifter invasion i like  if not for how it has been implemented, i like the idea off it making every thing more dangerous  but  just they way is done, no warning off the fleets coming any thing smaller then a super being a death  to fight them in.  
---
just could off  been don so much better then it is.
---
sec status is increased in ticks, so you only get one increase in one system every 15 minutes. 
---
So to improve it efficiently you fly into a system kill one big battleship rat and go into the next system and repeat.
---
No i will not take this bait.
---
The one time you’d use a solo bomber is for hunting explorers in either covops frigates or 0 tank Asteros. Fit a nemesis with rockets and dual scram, some hull buffer rigs and a damage control/BZcU in the lows and you’ll be pretty much guaranteed to catch any explorer. An Astero has a fairly long lock delay so you won’t actually catch another Astero if the pilot is awake. With a bomber, especially if you fit a SEBO, there is literally no way for people to escape. 
---
But you have low dps and low tank, so you can’t use it against stuff that shoots back, only against explorers.
---
well here is your problem,  don't make then strong enough and they get farmed. make then over powered and no one whats to both with them and the content just gets mostly ignored.
---
What did i mis here ? :(
---
Your cinematic videos are always a joy to watch o7
---
&gt;using their titans and supers to defend their space.
---
if only they would go and defend their space against drifters instead of whining and moaning about it
---
That is insane
---
Wind
---
Yes, No, Maybe....
---
We live in interesting times.
---
yet you bitch about npcs....
---
Magic 14 to level 5 takes a year..
---
Rocket SBs were used as non-combat explorer (that is not Astero) hunting ship at some point, maybe still are. So, basically killing toothless stuff.
---
Goddamnit this isn't about drifters in null, this is about how drifters are showing how much content is being denied real pvpers due to game mechanics. All those kills being generated by jumped-up incursion rats should by rights be generated by real people if the game was in a healthy state.
---
Trash low effort video....... at least you kept the same annoying cringe level similar to all your other attention seeking videos
---
You're assuming a lot of ratters don't already have stabs fitted. My hunters are all point/scram fit for this reason.
---
Username checks out.
---
at least a few large injectors worth
---
Actually you are cancer. I've 
---
been saying you should get sp for actually doing shit in game for years.
---
Which is totally what you as a player should be concerned with. /s
---
Poor t1 exploration frigs, kinda near the bottom of the food chain.
---
you can shoot npc's too you know, only because you are not getting dank incursion ticks does not mean you dont have to do it
---
There are too many to list. Do you have any skill/sp/resources/other restrictions to narrow the field?
---
Yep! I've done both of these.
---
Why is the mach "thicc"
---
then don't have everything in null, easy as that
---
Not sure abour RSS. But, people setup discord bots to do what you ask in your second question. I never tried to setup such thing myself.
---
At last Nullsec actually becomes what it should have been all along DANGEROUS
---
It's also about time NPC Faction had a real impact on eve instead of just something that you shoot in anoms and belts.
---
I mean this will literally RIP the isk out of the game especially if they are attacking ratters  and miners.
---
We just need to ensure it doesnt have a negative effect where people wont rat or mine or eve  worse they are scared to even undock without being afraid of insta dying.
---
Not be seen in local yeah lmao.
---
Don’t give me hope
---
In a game that requires 30 years or whatever to get to "maximum xp" level these small amounts of sp are very awesome for all eve players. Right now the only other way of increasing at a instant rate is via $$$$ or insane isk costs. Bring it CCP
---
The reason is that there are already ships that fill that role, they are called capitals.
---
As for the reasons why blackops should not be able to fit covert ops cloaks, this has been discussed in multiple threads here and on the forums
---
Not to mention -- they wouldn't have done this quietly.
---
It'd be a big fucking deal. They'd advertise the _fuck_ out of it. Resetting your game is, even for Eve, a huge marketing opportunity.
---
No, morons, this is Hilmar deciding he's had a good idea and whipping the devs to get his way. In a few years we'll hear from an ex-dev that "yeah, we couldn't talk him down, it was golden monocles all over again".
---
Remember, they had to leave Tribute where they were doing the "PVP" to handle this PVE tyrant. Now they complain about PVP coming to them, and they just like to press the easy button. 10/10 logic
---
https://www.removeddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c9byw1/people_on_blast/
---
... who cares?
---
I don't really agree or disagree with your prediction of drifter/trig warzone in low, but I do 100% think that CCP is going for a more theme park style of game a opposed to EVE's current (or previous) style which was just a massive sandbox. For anyone who might get the reference, think or vanilla World of Warcraft as a world, and current WoW as a theme park with daily activities etc. I believe this is the way CCP are designing EVE
---
Doesn't CCP put out a plex sale pretty much every time there's an event? I think that might be a coincidence.
---
Lancers scoop corpses, drifters do not.
---
&gt;But you seem happy to sit on a sideline and cheer on NPCs.
---
They're doing God's work, never not cheer that on :)
---
Your fallacy is to assume that any small alliance you listed is not overstretched as you are. 13 systems for an alliance that has only 35 active pilots at any given time? They obviously own too much space.
---
You only wail about this, because CCP finally found a mechanic you neither can talk nor optimize away.
---
Hell yeah they should. I made about 500m bashing a fort one weekend and we got some good fights for the timers and hole control. Was fun as hell and I got paid. No downside
---
hunting clone soldiers is also an option... each rat killed gives a significant bonus to sec status
---
The super majority of those structures are fueled your dimwit. Most of them are athanors for moon mining.
---
&gt; to tweak either end of the spectrum, it probably will go down the shitter somewhere. Theyve tried for years to tweak their game but also keep players in the game, to change it but not drastically fuck up their only dog in the race.  
---
&gt;So for now, it seems they are going to instead prune the growth of the game. They cant reset it, all the nullbears will leave. They cant leave it to the players, because we will have serenity in less than a year. They just need to burn enough to let the cycle continue.  
---
&gt;Then they can tweak here and there to make sure their sandbox is active and exciting. For now, to ensure the game keeps going, they have to do this.
---
sometimes they make the armor timer, sometimes they make the armor + structure timer, it s random. so you need to defend your structure if you dont want to loose it.
---
I have hope for next week and the week after that.
---
And then the value of what you mine in hisec goes up until it becomes valuable enough to mine in hisec again.
---
Playlist maybe?
---
psssh, you have no idea how much some of these reitarus can drop
---
this sounds consistent to what i've heard.
---
however i thought it just went with the biggest rat not the first. my security status log is full of consistent +0.14% increases, from anomaly ratting. i honestly don't believe the RNG god loves me enough to make sure the first rat of each tick was a battleship rat.
---
Sp loss for all t2, faction and capital losses.
---
Username checks out
---
If only ccp would operate on this level. Amazing post 10/10
---
\&gt; FTFY  
---
posting anything on r/eve
---
So far :O
---
100M/h is realy low for WH, even low class
---
Nah we were quite resilient, stopped in PO4 multiple times between 2009 and 2013, Names like BlueAdept or yours have stayed in mind
---
Would you link that 70M fit pls.  
---
Also whats the average payout nowadays that the trig invasions are on?
---
Shit they don't like the pve we are forcing them to do! Quick! Throw in some sp! That'll shut them up.
---
Yes and no high sec relies on null exports
---
Fair point tbh it's should just affect the big alliances
---
lol, I miss fuckups like this from when TEST was more poopy
---
Enjoy it while it lasts, FRT. This game is making us all grow up too fast.
---
😢
---
Not everything they own would disappear only like half of the things the big alliances own would which I think would make it easier for newbies to get into the game as there would be more opportunity as there would be more of null that is there for the taking
---
So what your saying is.....no local would be good?
---
&gt;rollback game mechanics to 2014 while keeping jump fatigue  
---
Fatigue is one of the worst ideas CCP has ever come up with, and combined with citadels, skill injectors, and rorquals has been a major factor in creating the boring carebear infested dumpster fire that is Eve today.
---
i liked it john
---
Haven't you heard?  Unless you belong to a large blue blob, you are irrelevant, hisec care bear and mittens is going to show you the error of your ways, by destroying all your industry structures, without which you can't possibly function. 
---
(I will miss space detroit, if it goes down though.)
---
well actually the main issue with wormhole logisitcs is humans, scanning your chain and taking gates / holes isn't exactly taxing ... its doing to safely so you don't get popped by humans that makes it difficult and time consuming
---
Tackle is doing something wrong if pve-ship can neut and mjd out of them.
---
Have ever heard about Bjorn, dude?
---
FRAT. has had a big falling out with some of their neighbours / renters, partly due to the TEST corps deploying against each but also some other hilarious drama. FRAT and TEST could match goons in titans/supers?
---
Not to mention csm
---
There’s a whole universe of other play styles out there. You should get out an experience them with different groups. 
---
Don’t stay locked into one group for eternity.
---
What, so when it receives a copyright notice you only find out when you were wanting that specific one?
---
“A mathematical analysis”
---
Literally 0 math.
---
Wat.
---
Would a bomber with torps be acceptable for this? Warp in, kill the BS and warp to next system?
---
The ticks is definitely good to know else I'd have wasted my time in one system killing multiple BS's.
---
As u/Dave-Stark mentions, is it the biggest rat in the system or the first?
---
I store mine in a NAS like a modern civilized connoisseur.
---
Ccp needs to add a point defense type fireworks launch out.
---
Where's the best place to find clone soldiers and type of ship I'd need to fly to kill them?
---
Great video, hopefully next could a guide on how to do level 1 missions in a faction bs?
---
I've had much success with nemesis in fw lowsec. Pre-scan the relic sites with other ship or same bomber and then refit to have cloak, 2 neutron blasters and 2 rocket launchers. I used nemesis for this as it can fit 2 scrams, web and ab. Dc and saar in the lows, scanres rig and you're good to go. Why dc and saar you might ask - because this poor excuse of a tank lets you take on the rare combat heron and fw mission bombers that shoot back with torps. If you encounter a magnate with 4 stabs, your only option is to have 1 faction scram (+3) but they go down pretty fast. Asteros are a gamble. If you see on zkb that they don't have tank and tackle, go for it. Bombers are chep. Have fun flying it!
---
This is the first time I'm actually seeing the "reposted so often that it's full of jpg artifacts" effect for myself.
---
Not complaining or anything, but I'm pretty sure I've seen that screenshot in better quality on an Eve-related discord a couple of days ago.
---
What? You kill AFs in t1 frigs often?
---
Not all tackle is done with t3cs, captors and dictors are both common and have no counter to a neuting battleship
---
Jea on discord from me
---
&gt; This has killed going literally anywhere in a battlecruiser or battleship without a scout.
---
Implying you could do that before drifters in hostile space...
---
Right, because no high sp player will use that. 
---
even if its 50k SP extra per day  thats 1500k SP per month, or almost double. (you get 1900k from +5 clone and optimal remap)
---
I would be ok, if this is for some time limited event, or even if its limited to first few months (would still help old players with new alts, but ...)
---
yeah imagine living in a paradise where you don't have to work for living and everyone is provided for so that you can shoot drifters all day
---
until that happens we're gonna whine about mechanics that ignore the fact we are humans
---
EVE succeeded because of the mechanics that force attackers to fight for what they want. You don't see games where someone can raid your base while you're sleeping achieving the same long-term success.
---
So what if your structures are put into armour timers?
---
Defend them for the armour timer. 
---
If you have too many structures for you to defend in armour timers, **then you have too many structures**
---
This post is absolute waffle.
---
Those games also have wipes every so often. It's a different style of game and what works for one doesn't for another.
---
You only need like 4-5 dudes to defend your entire alliances space against these 2 cruiser + 1 battleship spawns
---
great you have stuff to watch after AT was cancelled . enjoy your precious undock
---
I doubt you'd have the same attitude when it's because of a drifter attack
---
They should adapt
---
Some of you are ok.
---
Don't come to black rise tonight
---
You can still get t2 explo ships with a rocket SB. Or you can use it as pure tackle, and let your slow-locking ship do the killing.
---
No, it was jump fatigue combined with fozziesov and the cap changes which fucked us.
---
Those two weeks when we had jump fatigue and Dominion sov were absolutely amazing for smaller groups taking sov. They were having fights with cap support with no fear of a third party dropping supers to get content.
---
Funny, we did set them blue already on sisi, then someone came and said "hey lets set them -10 and see what happens" :D
---
man trying to get a group of bloodthirsty goons to do anything right is practically impossible. probably half the people responding to the ping thought it was a move op, a quarter jumped to the wrong cyno, a sliver joined in ratting hels trying to pap whore, and the remaining people who did make it on grid and are actually on comms were the FC and the PL spai in ascee.
---
it's a goddamn miracle we ever kill anything
---
No, I do not deny that. I just think that introducing an OP army of NPCs that you can do nothing against except shoosh them off again and again and again and again and again and again ad nauseam until you are burnt out is not good, either.
---
Good video! Let us see what the drifters have in store for null!
---
That's....that's not even a bad idea, you know?
---
it wasn't a faillure they removed it because bittervet don't want to undock and play the game to earn SP  
---
they don't care about newplayer / low SP players, they just want free SP for their 20+ alts
---
\&gt; You mean you drop 50+ supers on them and continue on with your day.
---
Yes, that is one option. That it is the only one you can think of says a lot more about you than anything else.
---
no, it was a failure because it didn't lead to any increase in activity.
---
rise literally stood on stage a few fanfests ago and explained all this. go and listen to his presentation instead of being a moron.
---
Pretty much this. CCP gave NPCs the tools to actually impact the game because they blame players for not using the shitty tools they currently have to prevent the stagnation of the game.
---
Large alliances have jump gates everywhere which means that you can be in any of your alliances systems within 7-8 minutes. Its NBD really
---
Oh really? What is a good example of an item other than Mercoxit that you just can't get in hisec?
---
I sure love being used as an unpaid beta tester for a multi-million dollar company.
---
If you cannot separate the perception from facts this might not be the best game for you. Also, you should not be able to unlock those new ships and weapon types within a year, eve is not that kind of game. All subcap weapons and ships can be unlocked well within a year.
---
Sure, you could reduce sp cost only for frigs and dessies and cruisers, but what next? BS too? Then carriers and supers? Because that's the road you are on.
---
Handing out sp forces you to play the game, at least if it's done like its implied in this post. Lowering sp costs doesn't.
---
imagine a paradise where you dont have to defend sov to keep it
---
If you can fit it to tank the other rats it should be fine. Cruiser up rats probably won't track you but destroyer down rats will be able to.
---
I have been doing this with just a couple of my friends. We had no problem covering our entire alliance's space of 159 systems (Pandemic Horde). This is a very easy job that requires very little. It just requires a handful of tryhards that likes to work towards the goals of the alliance. This 8 people per system claim is complete nonsense. These 1 battleship 2 cruiser spanws are really easy to clear
---
Nice meme ! nothing of importance was there anyway.  
---
I laughed more, when TEST FC PM'd me their new deployment, and then he realizes i'm in Winter Co xD
---
An interesting question is how many people per system you would need to defend yourself.
---
With a smaller domain, I'm not sure your maths are still good. You only need people to take shifts to defends to assets during the time they are vulnerable. And if I remember correctly, you choose this vulnerability window.
---
That means that you only needs to have one man per system during the vulnerability window. And it immediately becomes a lot easier to manage when you're not only 30 people to defend a 3 regions empire.
---
To sum up, your study is nice until you try to prove that the big boys will have an easier time dealing with it. You make your numbers lie before studying whether they still apply to your generalisation or not.
---
Dab
---
Probably safe to assume he lost as many to booshers. Some people just can't be helped, I guess
---
You are clueless...
---
Are you calling me a fat?
---
imagine existing outside the game
---
it seems scary but it's not that bad when you get used  to it
---
aww did our little feewings get hurt by CCP?
---
Which you only have to do because you want to own egregious amounts of citadels. Maybe don't have more citadels than you can comfortably, easily defend.
---
Brave tears best tears.  
---
"the size of Brave" What´s your point? You are number 5 in members of sov holding alliances.
---
wtb english stream or video )))
---
john hartley is a retard, news at 8
---
shit I'm still chewing on it
---
Does someone have reliable data on what sort of align time is required to escape drifters on a gate? I know sub 2s works but I'm not sure whether it is required.
---
SB solo is pretty fun but your volume of target is low, if the opponent can fire you, you are dead. 
---
Sometimes it s fun to kill some indus / miner. Against procurer, shoot drone first, for the other miner you will kill them before they will kill you.
---
By the end of this year, assuming I stay subbed, I'll have all subcap hull skills to V and all subcap weapons specs to V. I won't lift a finger for 10k sp. If I could sub at half price and not train omega skills at all I would.
---
Yes, you regularly have literally dozens of people attacking structures in WH.
---
I personally cannot defend a single Citadel 24/7 simply because I have a life. The problem is that Citadels are under attack 24/7 by a force that is not time-constrained in any way. But I guess you already understood that and simply chose to ignore it.
---
Lol have you not read mittens tweets?
---
I'm not sure that it will. The smaller you are the less system you have to keep track of and less traveltime to an "invaded" system meaning that a smaller entity can faster dispatch the threat and thus it'll take up less man hours.
---
Blaster+Rocket SBs can also catch exploceptors and non-combat fit Asteros.
---
I'm not sure whether to downvote this for it's stupidity or upvote for its entertainment value
---
Clone soldiers are found in all lowsec systems. Theyre ranked and higher ranks are found in lower sec like 0.1 
---
They drop between 1.5m and 20m tags iirc
---
Theyre decently strong. Lower levels can be beaten with a pvp fit algos or assault frig. Higher may require high skill and probably cruiser or some cancerous shit like the garmur idk only hunted them long ago
---
Small gangs will find the place deserted as all of the casuals no longer log afraid of the drifters and the non casuals won't have much left to defend (aka players and probably will be beyond sick of manning structures against waves of npcs) so they will probably play other games as well...
---
Losec belts
---
I'm sure you and your 1-man alliance are very hurt by it. But seeing alliances with 10k+ members whine that they can't defend their structures is great.
---
that was pretty spooky ngl
---
you say that but jumbridges are configured for moving to key positions, not to god forgotten places, for example a feyth citadel for test is minimum 15-20jumps from d-p with ceptor and jumpbridges.
---
&gt;If you cannot separate the perception from facts
---
&gt;Also, you should not be able to unlock those new ships and weapon types within a year, eve is not that kind of game. 
---
So your opinions are 'facts' but others opinions are 'perceptions'.
---
look at his flair lol
---
You mean the CFC?
---
new accounts that do not share (email, CC, 2fa key) with any other account that activates omega for first time?
---
Maybe he hasn't seen bjorn recently dude.
---
Better be just for a new player, god forbid it being a daily...
---
This sounds oddly familiar to what was said before training skils got removed. And yet the numbers kept dropping.
---
No, he was talking about the "perception" of "flying ship effectively", when, in fact, you can fly ship effectively without mastering every skill for it.
---
This says so much about the current state of EVE....
---
&gt;Yep, why do null sec entities need so much space anyway?
---
Renters! 
---
(ISK, soo much ISK)
---
And so much easy to gain space/sov.
---
Can we get some anti aliasing over here? In all seriousness though badass video, good job OP.
---
Remember that when you were the ones bitching about how ncpl ran and wouldn't fight you... The absolute hypocrisy is astounding
---
Why would i care about north? You are all the same boring null space.
---
It doesn't matter if you are experienced player or not, your approach would simply make the game more casual, and that is the exact opposite of what Eve started as, and what it should be. It is definitely not for everyone, but it is not meant to be. Why that point is so hard to understand?
---
Sure, business-wise eve should try to attract every single person it can, but what kind of game eve would be after that?
---
Also have you considered there MIGHT be something else than sp requirements for ships why new players won't stay or come to try even first place? Hell, you can get into pvp and fleet ops in day ONE.
---
You have alts, no? Put an alt in Feith, an alt in omist or wherever and an alt in eso. Ez game ez life
---
"he"? You're referencing yourself in the third person?
---
The other guy may have certain perceptions, but also have certain perceptions that you appear to classify as 'facts' or else your own argument invalidates your points. 
---
Anyway, the other guy's points were about the perceptions of new players and how working with them rather than against them would increase the player base and health of the game.
---
Then again T3 has smaller sig radius too.
---
Training skills where horrible. Good riddance.
---
I disagree with your point. It only takes a year to do those skills when you get to an advanced level, so you're no longer a 'noob' any more. You unlock new modules/ships every day when you first start out.
---
Your idea is shit because it failed the " doesn't affect smaller entities harder than bigger ones" test.
---
Adapt or die. Wormholers do fine without local, you will learn to live without it. Htfu
---
True, it's hard to make a case for them not being horrible.
---
&gt;implying the largest player alliance can't defend their things better than a small 50 dude corp with an asshouse.
---
k bro, whatever.
---
What is the obesity level of the population as a whole and is eve vastly different to that?
---
Ofc eve has lifting nerds martial arts nerds mudders nerds etc... It also has very skinny people and very overweight people
---
Agree. Unpowered gets only armor timer, 24 hours exactly from reinforcement, and no damage cap.
---
You want shield and choice over your window? fuel your shit
---
it doesn't work like that anymore. it was changed a few years back. For todays mechanics see https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Repairing_security_status
---
....might want to elaborate on that one.
---
They haven't posted a single thread.
---
Just big guys.
---
And this ebig guys threads have smaller people commenting that it was pretty easy.
---
Why would you need total tz coverage? You get to choose when your timer comes out.
---
FunFact, the inflation of account numbers is a symptome mostly seen on younger players, trying to catch up and overtake old players with 10+ Accounts PvE-and SP-Farms. In 2013 the avg. Accounts per player were 1.7, and I was 1337 in 2010 with 3 Accounts (still dont have more)
---
That was 15-25k(?)SP per day by killing 5 rat in a belt, of course it's useless make the reward better and the "quest" more difficult/interesting they seem to offer 50k SP for killing players, hope they do and make weekly quest with objective "killing 10players with a BC / BS or kill 10 players BC/BS" that way when you roam with a BS everyone want your ass and don't stay docked...  "do 5 abyssal L3" "kill some drifters..." just "active gameplay" 
---
something more interesting than killing 5 NPC when the main income source for everyone is ratting
---
God i can't believe I'm agreeing with a dirty northerner
---
Honk honk
---
it will probably be great for new accounts and old players coming back like me, seems the daily average players online is rising again, a bit of gaming press attention and its a way of revitalising the game.
---
I'd love to see this on Canada Day and Cinco De Mayo
---
How many titans do you think a loki can usually tank? I'd say not even one. But i am not experienced in dropping titans anyway, so what do i know, maybe a loki in a fleet can tank 10 supercarrier, 5 titans, and a 50 man subcap fleet so you needed those additional supers.
---
But i simply assume you actually wanted them to fight only subcap vs subcap, but needed to end this Inner Hell fleet so fast, so you could get back to defend your structures from the drifters.
---
Nah, in those games your base just naturally decays
---
at least ccp have the balls to shake things up, look at elite dangerous, their devs and CEO run away from controversy that in eve would be just a minor thing compared to some of the drama.  Good to see it
---
Nobody asked for free kills the fuck are you on about? Since when is a 50 man fleet in the heart of a coalition of 30k free? Idk if you've ever interacted with anyone outside of your massive blue donut but people do keep going out for fights in subs to kill and get killed. It must be shocking for you taking risks like losing a ship.
---
I'm finding it hard to understand why you don't want more new players to stay...
---
if you have multiple low skill alts, maybe gas &amp; reaction (+ T3 production but it require realy high skills)  
---
along with some PI and Pve/salvage (a pair of rattle or nestor)
---
If you want to discuss with numbers - I'd be glad to see this proteus fit)
---
I'd estimate that normal 400-600m Meg will tank 2x ~1b Proteus until it's out of batteries(and if there is some1 who deliver batteries - until DT). Of course I am talking about "average" fits, not some special "anti-meg-Proteus".
---
They did this before some years ago and it was nice then too, tbh. Not against SP that you actually have to work for and has limited gain in a given timeframe. The issue is more unlimited access for anyone with a large enough budget or irl wallet.
---
What if a citadel destroyed by Drifters doesn't trigger Asset Safety?
---
looks great but i wish someone made a translation for the subs
---
Wow 10 whole minutes of content? Like 3 minutes of pvp? Setting records in delve my man so proud of you... What's my narrative here o' wise redditor?
---
Yes, I should really pay heed to the famous mark Twain quote.
---
Could you backdoor botters with t1 filaments?
---
Resetting your game, _**ESPECIALLY**_ for EVE, would be an absolutely massive opportunity. EVE hits news headlines plenty as is, now imagine this game pulls something as ridiculous as pulling apart well over a decade of progression and giving the community a fresh slate to work with.
---
I'd love it if jump drives stopped working along with all the stargates and local in null. The only way in and out is through wormholes.
---
Then they make holes leading to NS more common/numerous. New mechanics allow Ansiblex limits to be increased allowing groups to make their own linked pockets resulting in maximum border gore.  
---
Null gameplay changes to wormhole gameplay but with gates and system upgrades. Maybe even selectable wormhole effects from system upgrades? Sounds fun.
---
You can safe log off with your carrier/super/titan and return back when kids finished playing with destruction
---
I laugh when people talk about removing local. What a stupid fucking idea. Yes, i want to be able to move an entire cloaky fleet through your space with blops with literally no noise, or literally my alliances entire super fleet with only a cyno beacon to announce my presence.
---
Not a single discussion in r/eve that I have seen has even remotely considered the possibility of using the local changes offensively. Every post is "hurr i can catch me a vee en eye", and the solution to that is either grow a pair and disallow alphas from running high-income shit (still bad but not pants-on-head retarded like no local) or have the site tackle you better (literally no downside)
---
Anyone can easily tell if their idea is shit because it will either pass or fail the "doesn't affect smaller groups more than larger ones" test.
---
Inb4 the EVE gate opens and something comes out to save all asses.
---
where did i get the spooky voice i am spooped
---
Training skills were removed in 2010.. between 2010 and 2014 eve's concurrent online users was at its peak, causality or correlation? I don't know.
---
Show us on the doll where they touched you.
---
Drifters in currrent state will not be permanent, thats 100% sure thing.
---
If i come in one solo ship, yes i try to avoid attacking caps, or supers, or even titans, but coming to delve is no use anyway. But they actually came in a formed fleet, so they wanted to not only drop onto something big, but expected to fight a response fleet ... but if dropping tons of supers and titans is basically your answer to everything, then on the long term, drifters will be the only thing that will be left in delve to fight, as nobody else will take the time and ISK to come there ... it's basically the same ... you going with 1000 titans somewhere asking for a fight, nobody will fucking do that. Your super fleet response in home is indirectly the same "hey please come and fight us in a subcap fleet, but be assured we will drop titans and supers on you, have fun". It's pretty if your country asks you to go to war and gives you a pistol and tells you "good luck against the tank over there".
---
So enjoy drifters, because thats basically all aggressive pvp you get. But you can drop your supers on them ...
---
Hmm. Fair point. I was under the impression they were removed later
---
I want to. But I also don't want Eve to lose what it is and turn other kind of game.
---
Never thought i'd hear that said unironically, what an absolute spod lmao
---
We are currently ~the little guy~ our alliance has not been touched by drifters yet. Granted we own one system with 6 structures in it. I'm not sold this will hurt us more then it's hurting you.
---
Where on earth are you even basing the hypothesis that Triglavians=Second Jove Empire remnants? Information from Triglavian data streams only indicate that they existed at the same time as the Second Jove Empire and considered them the "Ancient Enemy Azdaja". There's no further evidence to suggest that they themselves were actually an offshoot of the Second Empire.
---
In addition, the Talocan didn't "create" the galaxy. They created the Anoikis network, specifically the artificial wormhole connections between them supported by the Talocan static gates and the Talocan stellar engineering swarm at W477-P. A great display of absolute technological superiority over everyone else, yes, but it's not the same as "creating" a whole galaxy (as in creating actual stellar and planetary bodies). From ***Inheritance***:
---
&gt;*They built a stable network of wormhole connections among star systems that would not ordinarily or readily support such connections with each other. They altered the very fabric of space-time in the network’s systems. They altered resonance points and so arranged matters so as to be able to move between the systems of the Anoikis network with the ease that you and I might move between rooms in a house.*
---
you chose to live in nullsec
---
nullsec needs to be defended, thats the whole point of sov 
---
if npc's are challenging your sov, defend your sov
---
you would not go "reee ccp is stupid" when a player alliance would come to take your sov would you now?
---
Actually.  I've got a better solution. 
---
It's July and there's Steam Summer Sale running. Try other games and don't login.  Let CCP see how the active number drop after this patch.
---
Why do you need 5.0 sec status?
---
FW is dead, /r/eve told me so. This must be fake news.
---
Fatigue less gates saving you several jumps easily. You can travel several regions within minutes. Or across a single region too.
---
With enough time and investment (probably around 1-2 years of playing, with multiple accounts), you can attain roughly 1bil ISK/hr with the most reliable and consistent farming methods. That's 18.2$/hr according to your estimate, but I'm not sure where you got that estimate (I'd love to know how you got it). 
---
If we use PLEX to convert ISK to $ amounts, it's roughly 10$/hr (20$ for 500 PLEX, which is worth around 2bil isk). If you were to actually sell the ISK for $ (against the EULA, so you will get banned if caught), the rates for RMT are even lower, so in terms of actual convertibility, it's even lower. I'll let you find the going RMT rates on your own if you're interested. Just, again, it's against the EULA and you will get banned for selling ISK for $.
---
Nope, I want the full list. Asking for a friend.
---
Or ship losses
---
No if they move pirate NPC station out of the game, even the best/glorius Alliance in (da) game can do shit.
---
Don't lose time go back to check citadel the drifter are sneaky.
---
whatever..
---
Drifters are essentially roaming gangs that don't appear in local. Maybe CCP just wants to see how null reacts to this, making some announcement would defeat the purpose.
---
Even solo? How do you sell the stuff? The trips to Jita surely cut in your isk/hour
---
also i DEMAND that all my information character or otherwise stored on goon fleet Services be deleted and a neutral 3rd party act as my inspector to confirm its deletion
---
Take my upvote, praise to our drifter overlords
---
Marshall
---
Well that settles it. If Nullsec burns I'm rejoining :D
---
I don't care about asset safety at all, you can just move your shit out whenever its needed. It's a non-issue really. 
---
When it comes to safelogging in space then i would say yes, thats a great thing. I wish ccp removed keepstars so that supers and titans gets forced to safelog
---
*cough* world of Warcraft classic *cough*
---
I don't think that's a good method to make sure the accounts are alt accounts.
---
None of my 15 accounts share the same e-mail address, most of my accounts except two don't have payment informations associated with them because I use plex and I didn't even know you can use the same 2fa key for multiple accounts.

Who's to say this isn't just the beginning of the process, the building of anticipation, and that they will announce it at some pointpint?
---
What the point of introduce daily/weekly quest with a objective everyone do already (killing NPC) they just gonna get the reward by doing the exact same thing they do everyday  
---
make quest with a "active gameplay" not a passive one  
---
Kill X players with X ship size / Kill X players who fly X ship size  
---
Do X abyss / kill (invasion)drifters / incursion / triglavian invasion / sleeper site...  
---
they can even add more "event" if they want to experiment something, loved the idea of the frostline event last year = one anom per constellation = centralize the pvp, force the players to interact
---
I agree it is good to see so many bots burn.
---
Well fighting at the scale nullsec alliances can fight at is fun it's mostly not fun because of tidi and the fact all the nullsec turbokrabs/bloc alliances wield ships that are already slow to begin with, sprinkle asset safety on top of this and who in their right mind would bother!
---
CCP: Make a sandbox game where players can choose from a multitude of different activities and paths.  
---
Also CCP: Make a reward for just one specific activity that many players don't even want to do
---
one step closer to full game blutral
---
I'd be willing to bet that there are enough players that would forget to do so/be AFK from the game that their would be isk destroyed than the previous Goon invasion of Panfam territory.
---
I honestly don't have a problem with that.   There are ways to deal with it.
---
CCP asked 1000 quitting EVE players what was their most disappointing gaming experience and they all answered "It was losing all their POS's to an overwhelming server crashing force in the span of a day"  
---
CCP then went all hold my quafe mode and made drifter invasion a thing
---
ehh, wouldn't it be better to post that somewhere in the pubbieswarm forum?
---
will you be invoking texas law?
---
It kind of goes against the sandbox principle imo.
---
Some players don't like ratting and don't want to do it. The good thing about a sandbox game like Eve is that there's many other ways to play it, so you don't have to ever shoot NPCs if you don't want to.
---
If this reward goes live, *not* shooting NPCs would put you at a major disadvantage.
---
&gt;Yes, i want to be able to move an entire cloaky fleet through your space with blops with literally no noise
---
Sounds cool actually. That's kind of the point of cloaks and blops isn't it?
---
&gt;or literally my alliances entire super fleet with only a cyno beacon to announce my presence.
---
Also sounds cool, though spies would leak that hours before it happens. 
---
Just to be clear I'm not against changing local because I think the game would be a lot more interesting if it wasn't a perfect intel tool. I'm just 100% sure it's not going to solve the PVP problems on its own, because those problems mostly stem from capitals. After all, we had way better PVP in the past *with* local. What we didn't have is a limitless number of capital alts shitting on everything else.
---
yeah, private entities are not requred to adhere to the GDPR.

wormholes are only good for getting across the map quickly and turbo dread farming. it's not real space and it was never meant to be lived in. i understand that the few dozen wormholers who inhabit new eden are under the impression that they're somehow better than everyone else because they willingly handicap themselves and spend half their awake time scanning. here's some reality for you: your superiority complex is completely unjustified, you're just as bad as you were before moving into a wh. but now you have to scan for 10 minutes every time you want to leave system. congrats, ur real cool and hardcore lmfao

Posting this to Reddit shows what you know...
---
Ok
---
True BUT it's about perception, if someone comes from another game and has an emphasis on max/min they see that skill queue, say "hell no" and uninstall the game. Eve is a skill based game, the person in the seat, their knowledge is what counts, you either make the players see that, or you address the perceptions. The reality doesn't matter. It's like anything in life.
---
What's the slowcat doctrine?

Exactly! Come to jspace, we have lots of drifters and they don't doomsday.

The only reason you'll be missed or remembered is the hilarity of watching you lose excavators repeatedly.

my goodness today is a great day to harvest salt aside from spod ofc

This is why you're getting invaded by drifters.
---
And you wonder why we didn't let you back in you drama queen.
---
Bigboi's RR Domis or, more specifically, Carrier blob with sentries.
---
AM I BEING DETAINED
---
Correct, I want max Marshall active tank reps.
---
Even if he only "read a 10 line intro on GDPR" I'm pretty sure he can demand it. At least where I work if someone sends in something like this we need to remove any information that might seem like personal information.
---
w o o s h ~
---
If you cant defend the timer for the wrong reasons its even worse for the game. What we want is people go out and actually defend their stuff and not enable everyone to kill everyone stuff without anyone forming right?
---
Listen here, if I am an unlikable person I need at least one thing in my life to wish me a happy birthday
---
They are, if you are one with RR :D
---
&gt; A security status gain occurs for the HIGHEST value outlaw NPC you kill within a 5 minute time period.
---
You're correct, highest value outlaw every 5 minutes. Thank you!
---
They currently pwn in 0.0, randomly.   
---
So far they are unbeatable I think. Haven't seen a kill of one yet.    
---
I think they flew around in empire also, scanning things. Only returning fire.
---
Ok, thanks for the info.
---
I don't think anyone would hesitate to delete every post you've ever made.
---
What does this say in English
---
Literally who
---
&gt; They haven't posted a single thread.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Just big guys.
---
See above. Was replying exactly to that.
---
&gt; Why would you need total tz coverage? You get to choose when your timer comes out.
---
Because when you are small group with a few structures (you'll still need like half a dozen if you want decent functionality due to how rigs work), you probably can't afford them in reinforcement mode instead of being fully operation. So at some point you will have to prevent drifters or anyone else from succeeding on another timer.
---
They don't, but if you shoot a corpse in space, you will hear how it's screaming and dissapearing in the red light - that's essentially transition to drifters hell
---
just in case you are in any way serious, it isn't and we aren't :)
---
&gt;I don't think anyone would hesitate to delete every post you've ever made.
---
Neither does he.
---
You know the answer to defending structures this week is to drop xl because 3 drifters can't rf them right?
---
That's fine, he can still ask for it to be removed of course even if provided voluntarily. The realistic changes of him taking legal action are pretty much nill as it has to be done by a state regulator.
---
I think the one thing that really makes this for me is the bee guy next to Matt’s name with his arms thrown up in victory.
---
I mean I can see why he's so angry, after this amount of time and investing that much effort into industry and it being taken away from him, it's probably especially tough after having the Drifters happen for so long. Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.

Fit in description - videos shows overall tips &amp; tricks
---
Thats a great idea going to go give eve a negative review on steam thx for the idea
---
Can you elaborate further?
---
What does this have to do with this discussion?
---
Voice that can melt butter. Did you do the voice over?
---
You didn't really respond to it at all. You cited sampling bias, and I'm saying that doesn't apply because what small groups are saying is that it's easily manageable.
---
If you can't afford structures in reinforcement, then how do you manage not having 100% tz coverage against players?
---
You're trying to make a general concern of structures and applying it to the drifter threat, when it isn't at all unique to that.
---
He said it has changed. It used to be first, now it's biggest.
---
But his point is mainly, stop shooting anything except that 1 battleship, then go to next system. No reason to shoot anything else.
---
If only there was an "All" tab that lives to its name shows everything...oh wait, it suffers from the same problem.
---
You're right. I forgot that complaining is a reward to many in this game. I was more or less referring to their leadership stability, membership, and their coin purses, which are the 3 strongest pillars to cut down if you want to take down an alliance/coalition. Kicking goons (or any large stable group) out of their sov I don't think is going to affect their core leadership nor their wallets very much. They will just come in after drifters go away and reclaim everything and redeploy all the structures again, leaving us exactly in the current state we are in.
---
Drifters disagree
---
What for playing the game the way it has being designed for the last 3 years ? Ok all laffo.
---
Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half.
---
This is a great addition that promotes activities for new players. Op quit being a retard hoping to grab some free karma
---
The only thing to be wary of is they will point you.  The soldier tags they drop give sec boost.
---
Fucken lawl
---
You have no clue what you are talking about.
---
Yeah can I get a uhhhhhhhhh :b:oneless explanation
---
I rorq mine and used to vni rat in null, I sleeper rat and explore in wormholes, but sure I'm totally ignorant.
---

Lol is that what you got from that?  Damn.
---
By the power invested in me by our glorious leader, PBUH. I demand you remove all your posting from public areas. I have contracted no less than three different forms of cancer just from reading them, and my left eye will not stop bleeding like an ancient curse was placed upon it.

Also I have just hired two texas lawyers, so be afraid.

---
Happy late traitors day I guess
---
This is top quality, 10/10 editing and those few lines gave me the shivers.
---
Sure, I'm happy to give more insight to this concept. Essentially it boils down to the larger groups can rebuild faster than the smaller groups can and the smaller groups wallets will burn out much faster. Essentially if CCP regularly kicks players out of their sov and kills all their structures, the smaller groups will eventually not have the economic strength to keep rebuilding and will fizzle away. Meanwhile, the larger mega groups have the resources to keep rebuilding for much much longer. It will mean that null sec will only be owned by alliances that have the deep wallets to afford rebuilding or alliances that are willing to spend real life money to funnel isk to their wallets to keep alive. It all comes down to whether the drifters are a permanent addition to null sec life or if this event will end before they start hitting sov structures.
---
Thinking about what that might possibly entail.
---
Kinda makes the game an almost full time occupation eh?
---
You know when Eve was in Beta (6), using a module increase the skill for it.  Seemed quite logical at the time.  For example, my AB skill went from 1 to 3 just from burning around for a few weeks.
---
Thx but he also says you need 2 of these to do t4.
---
The loot revenue is also very outdated but it should still be nice.
---
Duuude happy to see you active
---
I'll shoot you a contract in EVE with that said doll
---
The consequence of this (which may or may not be acceptable) is either;
---
1. Your dropped loot gets replaced with a duplication, so now two copies of the loot exists in the game, or
---
2. Your dropped loot gets forcibly transferred back to you from the looter's holdings.
---
I can't think of any other options, but I'm open to any suggestions that isn't "CCP has a blanket rule of *lolnope!*"
---
Are you taking into account scan time in these numbers?
---
Well said. Players want a certain level of comfort versus challenge. Keeping that balance is what keeps a game relevant. Here's to another 16 years of Eve!
---
It's all in the Chronicles
---
A long time coming
---
btw table-top strategic games used a way to reset the games when a stalemate was reached.
---
But there **were** player owned stations :)
---
If traveling accross large region is easy it makes the logistics of defending a full region not exponentially harder than if you are a small alliance with proportionally as many directors living in a single constellation.
---
Ur mum fam
---
yep its a online game everything should be on a burner account hell even this reddit account is one lol
---
You mean YOU don't have 20 fits for the most powerful pvp ship in the game?
---
I wish you the best of luck filing a complaint with your local data protection authority and see how far down you are on the pile of shit they have to work with
---
Easy to solve.
---
Cataclismic events, changing hyperspace - as in a super wormhole (white hole) is forming
---
Maybe technologies no langer working, or only working sometimes, not to the full capacity anymore
---
Even with the manual targeting (not sure if that's been proven that CCP is manually selecting the systems/structures/etc.) smaller groups have been hit. Albeit the drifter wave was a smaller fleet compared to some of the fleets reported by the mega coalitions. But they have had to fight them off or risk their structures going reinforced while being under attack by nearby enemy players. I'm talking alliances that own 2-3 systems each and are part of a very small coalition of 4-5 alliances. I think all in all they own about a constellation and a half of sov and they had structures get reinforced by drifters.

---
Making it risky to hand out rights is part of the design.   Leaders in the really world are never in perfect control of their assets.   Their subordinates can always run off with them or turn them against the great leader.   We need more opportunities for coups.
---
No, wspace is just under BOBs protections, and Drifters are big believers of BOB, so they have no grude against other folks in there.
---
Still thinking CCP is competent after the books of evidence to prove otherwise.
---
Also, LOL at retards still thinking tossing around free SP helps new player retention.  Its as if it makes the 8502348423804 design decisions that make EVE a niche game are suddenly null because little Billy gets to waste SP on something he doesn't need in between drooling sessions.
---
Sounds like cloakie camping
---
I have no idea what that Screenshot is showing. From comments I guess doing some of these things listed there gives (more) Skillpoints now? Are we getting skillpoints for completing these achievements?
---
I always wondered what that character advancement sheet is for, it´s like an achievement tab but I´ve never seen that I get anything for getting the achievements. Do we get SP for these achievements?
---

Getting back into the game and starting out with Hisec DEDs before moving into Low and would love some ship/fitting tips. On a 5.5mil Gal drone character at the mo 
---
Cheers!
---
The Drifters are using the new AI programmed by CCP, so the result was inevitable... the invaders, just like their creators, have no idea that Lowsec, Wormholes and NPC Nullsec exist.
---
Nope. There have been drifters in highsec for a [long time](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1000274/highsec/), in systems with Jove Observatories and Drifter Wormholes.
---
The small groups have been hit though. I've personally seen their structures get reinforced. You likely don't see them complaining because there's fewer of them than there are of the larger groups. Plus oftentimes when the smaller groups go public in places like reddit they get shit on because their viewpoints might be different than the popular opinion or they get told to "get gud" or "hard the fuck up". They don't have the network to say internally "Hey guys, I made this post on reddit, go upvote it please" and then they get a crapton of public support from each other.
---
What?  That's over half an injector for anyone over 80m SP.
---
why are goons/test so mad about drifters?
---
This happens when retards shoot the seekers.
---
Y'all need to learn PvE mechanics.
---
Bjorn is awesome!
---
Speak for yourself. I’d probably still manage to screw it up even with Drifter advantages.
---
Armor timers for fueled structures come out in your timezone, there is no requirement to babysit structures at night.
---
&gt; Instead of constantly trying to tweak things here and there and hope theres a breath of life for a few months or so before its all gamed again, this way they can basically "clean the slate" without telling everyone hey we let you play for years of gametime and its going away, sending many subscribers from logging in
---
I agree rigorous changes are necessary but I am not sure this non-player based type intervention was the way to go. It doesnt address some very strong design and conceptual flaws in the game. In fqct in many was CCP has made problems worse. The list goes on and on wuen it comes to ideas that were 100 percent the opposite direction of what they should have been going for in the first place. CCP had a really, really bad travk revord here, not the because of some things they did in the past 2 years
---
Yes, cvp is there holding a gun to people's heads
---
Some of the agency events are good.  Don't knock 'em!
---
In a game that does not need max SP to have fun.
---
CCP should have communicated this more clearly over the years.
---
The race to max SP/Level is coming from players who have grown up in WoW or other shitty rules systems (d20, I'm looking at you).
---
Then stop looking in the mirror.
---
damn, still no double upvote here...
---
Because if forces you to be effective in a smaller ship. Like a frigate. Yes, frigates are extremely powerful ships in eve. Problem is 99.8% of Eve doesn’t know how to use them. Simply because they skipped pass it to get in a BC/BS or higher.
---
Better than the years you've spent sat in wormhole space wondering if HK is going to turn up and blow your shit up.
---
What's wrong with SP gained performing in game actions? 
---
It is how aby other mmo works!
---
The real problems are bots and marginally afk ratting/mining
---
It's not like the massive isk influx from null *because* it's been so safe isn't a problem or anything.
---
Scared you can't make 3bil/hr anymore with zero risk?
---
Sounds organized.
---
Well in WH-space, drifters are a crucial part of ratting... it's basically the best ship you can kill to get blue loot ... if you implement a DD weapon into it and make it unbeleavably strong or you let them spawn in groups and still cap the total amount of loot to 300M after finishing the site ... i am not sure if subcaps will be able to do them. No nestor/rattlesnake will survive the dd blast i think.
---
Why not just remove sov mechanics altogether and let players solve the problem themselves?
---
Jintaan pls.
---
Hey now, reality doesn’t get people worked up and hyperventilating.
---
Ignore my camera, it is for research  purposes.  \*breathes heavy\*
---
Before I heard Deimos I assumed it was a titan with a vendetta in its hold
---
I still.never understand why no one drops 10 supers on the dreads.   Anyone else,it would have happened.
---
Do.you set these up first or is there some mutual agreement
---
Wait, forgive a newbro here, so this means I get SP when I pew pew something? Does this include rats? Or drifters/triglavians anything to shorten my skill queue T_T
---
Community:  Some idiots are still actually trying to PVP in EVE!  What do?!
---
CCP:  Hold my beer...
---
Titans aren't just about skill points. Newbies getting them quickly is only possible with assloads of ISK, which still takes time to accumulate
---
"The NPCs strikes back"
---
Paid actors!
---
Perceptions are what keep people in the game.
---
Not everyone is as enlightened as ee are, and they have the money to keep the game going.
---
Or did I. As for not addressing what you said, of course I didn't. I love that you think I'm a dumbass. Awwww....so cute :)
---
Nice comeback, dude. It's almost like you have no talent...
---
Naah, I don't care enough to read that again. It was basically just napkin math anyway. The thing is, if you are so small you can't defend several systems, maybe you shouldn't occupy several systems.
---
If you don't have enough people to defend your space, make way for someone else to use that space. Hey, maybe even create an alliance with that new guy. Meet some more new friends and voila, you have a new nullsec group.
---
If your empire is too bloated to defend, maybe you shouldn't have been so greedy and gobbled up so much space.
---
Do I think this drifter attack has been handled well? No, it seems to impeed too much on PvP. But if it can help getting rid of the rental systems then I'm all for it. Make way for new nullsec groups so interesting things can start to happen.
---
not really, we can just re-drop or set clones, it's not that big a feat
---
Different rats have different boosts in security standing when killed. Faction spawns give you more than a nromal rat and so on. The way the standings are calculated you prefer to get one big standing boost instead of many small ( one 1% increease rat is better than 10 time a 0.1% increase.) I think it's not really common to min max security increase. Most people min max isk/h and take the standings as a nice bonus.
---
My observation is that DED sites give good security increase as you usually have at least one special rat there with a good increase. Missioning on the other hand doesn't seem to do much. (I don't do burner though. Check if burner rats give a good increase if so blitzing burners might be an option.)
---
Almost like CCP has the ability to make its' intentions / visions a reality.  
---
That's the biggest fiction in this whole article.
---
go and say those words to fozzie and watch him think your high
---
Even before that, Goons existed as a Troll organization that specifically aimed to knock over other people's sandcastles and disrupt the game as much as possible.
---
It's a perfect case of die a hero or live to become a villain... Goonswarm of 10 years ago would be disgusted by what they've become.
---
Yeh that is very true.
---
I think this is from the second Star Trek reboot film.
---
Maybe they could add it as a module for marauders? Have them be a more pvp ship. The only issue there is if you're ratting your have something that would make you safe from being dropped on. But maybe that would encourage more blops usage idk
---
Because Fozzie thinks he's God and anything he didn't have a hand in is wrong.
---
t1 explo frigs can fit more firepower than t2 tho.
---
It is really strange, I started playing again in May and I am six lvl5 away from full.
---
Yeah dude everytime CCP touches jspace they always mess something up. Fuck off, we good.
---
*BZZZZZZZT*  Wrong!
---
But thanks for playing!  Enjoy your take-home gift, this 14" dildo in the shape of a fist!
---
there isn't salt, there is player concern - mainly b/c the majority of nullsec have the capability to think a few days down the line and the extra brain cells to understand how this drifter event negatively impacts the game and you \~others\~ don't have any clue what you're talking about b/c you fail to understand anything beyond your own ship's bubble
---
Honestly fate spending 13 years having to actually train my skills, skill injectors was a joke this constant  free SP for nothing is pissing me off too.
---
I remember way back when I played a bit of WoW and yea I did cos I dont mind saying it was a cool game.  I upgraded to lvl 60 from level 30 and then didnt play much then  they did the upgrade to level 90
---
And I stopped playing completely . why because at level 90 i hadn't a clue what was going on, I felt I had missed the whole level 60 to 90 experience.  The different worlds they why i had leveled up, etc etc.. I just felt a but empty.
---
If you want to give people more changes when they are new fine change the whole skilling up to be as per usage based rather than purely time based.  That way people skill up the more they gain experience and actually use something.  Free SP pretty much gives you zero goals and zero ambition to actually play.
---
What if this event is CCP's version of final end game event ala Final Fantasy 14. We might even get a nifty  final CG video. CCP's videos have been top notch.
---
Drifters generated some of the finest salt ever:  
---
"We can't defend all 100500 of our structures!"  
---
"Nullsec is no longer safe!"  
---
"Our FCs are working overtime!"  
---
"We can't replace our Titans because our bot farms has been obliterated!"  
---
"Why did not CCP warned us and asked for our opinion?"  
---
but making love to a trap is not gay
---
Someone was WRONG on the INTERNET. This CANNOT STAND.
---
Every fricking T2 component.
---
this comment alone elaborates on how sadbrained people are who don't experience nullsec and keep to their highsec bubbles
---
real jump fatigue would be disastrous, it's why 25% of the player base quit back in the day
---
lol 2014 fatgue killed like 20% active players, CCP wouldn't survive another one of those implementations
---
Is from a Star Trek trailer IIRC
---
A Heron can be fit pretty nastily.
---
Hello! Glad to see you are getting some good responses. I was wondering if you could answer a question or two for me though. I have tried on and off over the years to get into eve but it never sticks
---
I know almost nothing about the PI stuff you mention and just looked up some info on how to set up a basic production.
---
How come you needed the alts? I get the basic idea of the production chain and clearly there is an advantage to the alts since you had them, could you tell me exactly what that advantage was?
---
The whole thing sounds interesting to me and sounds like at some point you enjoyed it as well and burned out and I'm always looking for a fun experience!
---
Pretty sure that's Benedict Cumberbatch from Star Trek: Into Darkness
---
Can confirm. I skipped over the punisher and went straight for the harbinger back in 2010
---
If you've actually attempted to defend this invasion it is not fun gameplay in any way shape or form.
---
Nullsec isn't the only thing in Eve. Low was pretty fucking vibrant when people could move around to find content, and members of smaller groups without the ability to provide large scale logistics could support themselves. Fattygay killed all of that, and drove everybody into null.
---
Are you crazy it's obviously the best thing CCP could have ever done, shitting on the last part of the sandbox that wasn't already either dead or on the verge of being so. Why can't you celebrate CCP retarded ideas just like everyone here ? You mood killer.
---
1. Cloaks and recons with dscan immunity exist. Also there is a delay in spamming dscan (few seconds), which would be enough to miss a fast warping inty.
---
With the 100mn VNI death and bots/alphas/farmers switching to domi's or myrms, ships will most likely be sitting on the beacon (face tanking), instead of being off 70km. Which makes a warp-in in that dscan delay do-able.
---
Also, how does a bot know if the stilleto on dscan is an enemy ceptor or a friendly travel ceptor?
---
2 &amp; 3. This is one hell of a strawman. The assumption you can place alts on every single gate in nullsec to monitor gatefires is rediculous. Even current Near2/Intel bots dont exist in every system (when they could for larger intel networks). I can see it for specific/busy ratting systems, but not for every single nullsec system.
---
&gt;If you can ~~dodge a wrench~~ defend against Drifters, ...
---
Looks like one-time each for achiving goals in the activity tracker...
---
Sharing a 2fa key is new.   Maybe a month or two ago.
---
No you
---
Nullsec was already dead. Spectre fleet need 2+ hours to die in nullsec. Nullsec means carebears.
---
Star Trek into Darkness. That's Khan speaking
---
Lots of places.... Templar One, the book, covers the sleeper rise and fall. You have other EvE novels, comic books, Frigates of EvE, Empires of EvE, EvE Source.... all kinds of stuff. CCP has let most of it fall into forgotten times.
---
nope, only krab time and warp. for exmple, after scanning the hole (and judge it's a safe place to krab), if I spend 1h in a C3 full of combat site with my rattle, I know that I will come back to home with 200-300M (300M is my personal best in C3 vanilla with a very good chain of anom)  
---
the scanning/roll time depend heavily of your scanning skills, the number of connexion in your hole, the number of rolling BS etc...  
---
It can be from 10min to 1h. Quite impossible to use it in a isk/h calculation.  
---
In WH, best thing to do is to set up nicely your farm, spend 1, 2 or 3h krabing (if you have enough combat site).
---
Please do... I need something to cry into at night...
---
Citadels are vulnerable 24/7 now for initial reinforcement.
---
The small guy is near broken in nullsec now. If not completely fucked. 
---
We warned this is happening.
---
Wrong, people there like to harass and disturb, ideally destroy empires. Just the thought of grinding ingame more than in your RL job makes these people avoid Sov-Nullsec as a home. Also if y&lt;ou actually have a brain Lowsec offers some nice income sources (except mining moons). How do sound 600 Mio ISK/hr to you with something at least a little bit variating and not just boring rinse-&amp;-repeat-grind that is Nullsec-PvE
---
I have no idea what that means, could you elaborate?
---
I'm just avoiding nullsec if I can while all this shit is going on. More wormhole diving.
---
If this continued it would solidify our hold on the south by virtue of preventing everyone remotely close to our size from leaving their own space to attack us.  That's a bad thing
---
Maybe it will be only for newbies for 1 month to get a faster start.
---
Dont be rude. (✿◠‿◠)
---
Everyone make mistakes, It's how we all learn in Eve, it's not retarded. (◕‿◕✿)

It does still work, not sure why you're missing profile folders though.

DAILY QUESTS !
---
"B-but this is not content, because it is tedious and not awarding"  
---
XDXD
---
With extractors and Plex you can basically do that.
---
Let them shoot your structures and spawn without sites being aggroed.
---
And let them shoot your structures 4x a day in all time zones.  And drop no loot.
---
You say you have drifters?  CCP should give you the same drifters
---
Humans are social animals and they like communities which brings safety. Doesn’t matter how you try to put obstacles in place, they will combine and create communities. That’s just how it works, no ifs or butt’s. X Y Z mechanic won’t change humans and diplomacy.
---
That's completely wrong because SP isn't something you hard earn in Eve at all. It's just a roadblock stopping you from getting into ships you probably are too inexperienced to fly properly.
---
We're not out here grinding for SP on a daily basis, giving 25k SP for one-time achievements for new players is not going to break the game, nor is 25k SP putting newbros into Dreads they can welp. It will, however, help that newbro shorten his queue in a vital skill or allow him to get some scanning/hacking skills while his Frigate skill is training to 5.
---
&gt; Essentially it boils down to the larger groups can rebuild faster than the smaller groups can and the smaller groups wallets will burn out much faster.
---
This assumes that the loses are compatible, which, no small group is going to deploy hundreds of structures that they will have a hard time defending, and ultimately - losing.
---
Your sentence assumes that small corps will be doing the same massive system-grab that the mega corps do, which isn't true at all because they don't have resources to that scale.  Corps that DO behave this way deserve to go under -- just like the big megas.
---
You put it in space?  Defend it or lose it.  That's EVE, baby.
---
As for the rest... you repeat the same intial sentence, and build off that one concept:  Big groups have the resources to rebuild and little ones don't.
---
The problem with that, is that you're ignoring the problem CCP appears to be attacking:  Large swathes of space with un-manned/un-defended structures claiming "ownership".
---
Big groups will need to rebuild, because they're losing shit because they either 1) Don't have enough trustworthy people to gun or 2)don't have enough people, period.
---
That's not a problem small groups have, because trying to own huge sections of space is not something little groups do.
---
So, no.  You didn't "give more insight" into this concept -- you explained it like someone who doesn't see the small players side sees this concept.
---
We take care of Low Power citadels ourselve. we don't need the help of Bob's sons

Why take back that pipe when no one wants to live there.  After volt bailed on it, it's been hot potato trying to get it to an alliance that'll hold it.  Now you guys took it, and to dislodge you would take a concerted campaign, with risk of escalation.  Piss on it, let you guys have it, means instant fight right off 9uy.
---
Also, none of that may hold true anymore, been out of provi a bit, politics might have changed.
---
/u/kristallnachte lmao
---
You're clearly new.  A lot of us vets had to spend literally years building up our SP.  We had to buy implants and even training learning skills.  That's it. We didnt have remaps, the learning skills have been removed and now you have injectors its hugely different.  Our years are hard earned years of gain that SP and years of subs.  So where the hell you get it's not hard earned is just ridiculous.
---
Also injectors you can train every skill needed in ONE DAY. It's been done and again it's totally stupid.  It should be at least limited to say 20mill SP is the amount you can inject to.
---
Ah but you see, since wh groups are all constrained to just one system, it would be easy for us to man a structure a few times a day, so we wouldn't be nearly as affected as the sprawling null empires with literally thousands of structures to defend.
---
It's almost as if this mechanic introduces some kind of soft cap on how much space you can realistically control with a group of fixed size, instead of letting relatively small entities own entire quadrants of the map, knowing citadel timer mechanics will keep them safe.
---
Finally, structure spam isn't a problem in j-space, or at least it isn't nearly as big a problem as it is in HS and NS.
---
Can't bot our rats but when the dev's finally do something about it ya'll come pointing fingers at the guys that haven't had any direct expansion in years🤣🤣.
---
Same here. If null burns to ashes I'll resub in a heartbeat.
---
If they do, they might as well bend over
---
You cannot compare your nullsec empire with wormhole space ... at the end ... if thats happeing that drifters would attack everything in wormhole space and would basically spawn without sites beeing aggroed, then it would be still easier to defend. Let bearholes aside, wormhole corps live in ONE sytem (most of the time). So that one system is pretty much filled with a couple people almost 24/7 ... so defense with a structure can happen almost all the time. We don't have to jump 15 jumps to an attack, we're basically already there when they come. But i was more talking about the drifter that spawns in C5/C6 sites ... sounded like you wanted to change them into non-loot ns drifters
---
Kind of understand what you mean now. I've been mostly flying battleships and a buddy called my to do a few of those abyssal deadspace thingies and it was kind of scary. As soon as I turned on my MWD in my frigate I felt entirely out of control.
---
&gt;dont get me wrong i hate the citadel spam but uh just dont let raitarus be &lt;1bn or something 
---
when you gotta drop 1 on each moon to extract value from it - that's gonna hurt the little guy way more than the big guy. the big guy can eat the initial cost and not wince, smaller groups my have trouble getting over that hurdle.
---
Sov is probably the biggest honor an alliance can have.  I just think it needs some linking system to prevent a lot of the problems now. You should have to develop your space before you can expand on.
---
Botters react to you being in system and come back to their sites after a while. Could you use a t1 in an unfinished site to disappear from local and reappear on top of them once done?
---
Possibly, but they could see the trace. Logging off achieves the same effect except it's impossible to tell where you went. Also, your ship fitting would be constrained by having to be able to actually complete the trace before coming back into system.
---
&gt; What is the risk moving Industrials? 
---
Getting ganked
---
It will consolidate you into a region that you can control, and leave other more active groups the ability to deploy closer to your ‘borders’ as you no longer have a dominating citadel spam preventing them from doing it.
---
Just keep moving and you'll be fine. if you loiter on a gate or a station they will eventually land on you and it's not pretty. But just gating around they aren't much a risk.
---
These smaller lowsec groups don’t have supers to freely yeet around like large null blocs do
---
hey guys. hope you are all having a good friday.
---
been at home all week and the doc said no gym for at least 2 weeks after my procedure on monday. so i've just been eating all the snacks and playing all the games. back to the grind at work on monday morning though. be nice to get back in to a normal routine.
---
You don't need magic 14 to 5
---
I think that the “problem” CCP is trying to “solve” is just a matter of having more stuff(preferably bigger stuff) blown up and a harder environment to rat or mine to plex a toon, leading to more sales of plex and subscriptions and more money to be extracted from the existing game.
---
From the perspective of a person who wants to make Eve as profitable as possible, a random shitstorm causing all kinds of stuff to be blown up is the best thing to happen.  The worst thing for him is a bunch of players who can easily plex their toons and enjoy the game while taking up the most desired possessions in Eve, and botters.  All the better if he can randomly blow up the stuff of those people who have the honey in Eve, under the guise of “giving players the justice that they want”.  He just happens to make more money by “listening to (certain pockets of) the players”.   In the best case scenario, this implementation of random shitstorm blowing up the stuff of the players who have the honey, will drive out the toon-plexers and botters from the game, make it much harder to have the honey in general, up the demand for plex and subscriptions, create “excitement”, and successfully posture as “CCP listening to its players”.  
---
Seems to me that CCP has been making small incremental changes in the same direction with the same goal for a while now.  Just that before, it wasn’t as blatant of a hail mary implementation as it is now and it used to be sprinkled in with a bunch of other balance changes and whatnot.
---
Of course, all this is just my guess and I don’t know the internal profitability and the change of profitability Eve has been going through over the years, so I can’t tell how much of it is a move to survive and be viable as a business or greed.
---
I believe future changes, big or small, will continue to cater to the pockets of player base that most consistently sub and pay for plex.
---
What do you do when the internet goes down?
---
i made this entire post for the sole reason to rile americans up
---
This right here sums it up.
---
I had the same issue but then none of the drifters followed up with the armor timers so nothing really happened. My suggestion would be to just let them bash it until it gets to final timer.
---
Thx!
---
If only there was some intriguing null gameplay for us actual players.
---
Fuck off, you don't give a shit.
---
Kind of sucks that the majority of sov holders aren't 1k member alliances anymore, and CCP made the functions of those outpost into several different structures.
---
Especially if there are skill point rewards for getting newbros their first pvp kills. Even if they just blap a plexing bot in an arty thrasher it's a start.
---
Actually not a bad theory
---
That would have been so dank. Then you could welp THEIR drakes!
---
Been playing since 2007, so yeah must be new.
---
You're just a bitter, gate-keeping vet who wants any newbros to suffer like you did back in the day. It's bad and hurts the game in 2019.

---
You deserve more drifters in your space
---
If i look from a developer pov the Invasion, trigs aswell as drifters, are one of the best attempts from ccp to add sort of PvE content to more areas in eve. Belt rating, missions, incursions and abysall deadspace are ok, but this game needs some serious pve content in addition to its pvp.
---
A game only based on pvp makes no money, cause a lot of players will stop playing at some point, with not enough positive achievments to keep their attention. Sure kill a player is fun, for some at least, but lose to another player always feels 10 times as bad, its human nature. I want the game to stick around very long, and expand, which requires money, which only comes from new players, and to achieve that, the game needs 2 adapt to the desires of the current market to get higher revenues, in which pvp just plays a minor role^^
---
this whole reply translates to “I was hurt in my pipi and hate this guy and his group, so i am now bitching at this guy because of my incompetence as an ~player with pipi intact~”
---
Apparently coming to a HS system near you ;D
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77627959/
---
The "solution" to this event is not smaller entities. The "solution" is more people bunkering down in less space. If this keeps up, or even gets worse in intensity, you will have like 4 or 5 habitable regions, with the rest just getting glassed by drifters on a regular basis.
---
&gt;you have too many structures
---
But only because this is the playstyle CCP encouraged. Why should an alliance willfully place less structures, if it gives them a significant disadvantage?
---
There are standard 'default' overviews issued by CCP.  These include General and Mining.  These generally have the new ships, like when the flag cruiser got added. 
---
These rats are missing from that overview.
---
Don't expect much sympathy. The folks who are most vocal in their support either have no intention of owning structures, or have been forced out of nullsec by one group or another, and as such would be unable to own structures or space of their own. They don't want balance; they just want those who have wronged them or whom they believe to be ruining the game to suffer, no matter the cost.
---
Like I care that much about reffed structures?
---
I'm more annoyed that it's just busy work, with no real meaning.
---
I'm a big fan of solo SB; always find myself jumping back into one. You can be pretty reckless in a 60m SB. 
---
As others have said your viable targets are slim pickings, a properly fit heron or magnus can kill a bomber. Luckily if I do find something with guns I can call in another agent with a more appropriate delivery vehicle.
---
These days I run a bomb launcher and 2 Torps. Start with a nemesis, ask they have the fastest lock time. Basically you just roam around blaping explorers (much more fun than hacking) and miners/huffers.
---
You need a 3 point scram, and at least 1 TP, ignore all survivability and just get damage, explosion radius, RoF. I'd recommend you start with 3 torp launchers
---
also would be silly to do so within range of dhsj
---
He put his shit on firesale and somebody snagged it up, I was too busy being confused at how angry he was.
---
This, I comforably hauled stuff around HS without much problem besides getting shot a little when warping off gates.
---
yeah, it probably means more to higher sp players than anyone else.
---
Go back to tumblr.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
we already have PVE content coming out of our ears - just look at the amount of rorquals mining and people ratting in anons. The problem is that PvP content is on its knees.
---
How many times were you able to see small groups take and hold sov before jump fatigue?
---
It would be a cool mechanic if this was rewarded. Like the larger the fleets players put together, the larger the incoming drifter fleet, and the better the loot.
---
You don't, BUT would a new player know that.. a new player who would be wanting to max/min...
---
Why nerf the mining amount?
---
&gt;Alton Haveri reports as the SSC announces that its Fluid Routers are being compromised and that Capsuleers should prepare for the inevitable communication blackout across Nullsec. The Drifters also seem to be gearing up for a fresh wave of attacks, targeting more than just structures, adding to growing concern among Nullsec power blocs.
---
this was great, proper vintage darkside
---
always enjoy seeing midscale fleets with really impressive dps for the numbers
---
I used to use an omen navy issue and hunt players at the same time. Tactical destroyers, especially dual rep hecates, work extremely well.
---
1.i. I am honestly OK with that huge risk. I think the problem is safety conferred by grind, and that the armor timer doesn't really add anything even in the hypothetical. But it does make every other citadel more of a chore.
---
1.iv. Almost nobody engages on shield timers anyway, but maybe if they removed the armor timer I could live with 20 minutes. But remember, the defender is going to get advance notice of the second timer, in a tz of their choosing. Not everything has to be about whether the defenders can form a perfect fleet. It's a surprise attack - it should be panic stations.
---
2.i. we frend nao
---
4.iv. I look around at all the incredibly stupid things people do for isk, and honestly, I'm not worried about people undocking. Krabs will always take risks for isks.
---
i love CCP if they crash local (◕‿◕✿)
---
Would be both hilarious and disappointing to see CCP suck mittani dick so hard if they did
---
Stuff on station grids got a lot more dangerous with the drifter update. I got instalocked and popped by faction police while still in undock invuln last night. That might have been a trip through the CCP Time Machine, or another "mechanics leak".
---
Is it... Is it real?
---
HELL YEAH !!

This is what trying to fit a square block into a circular hole must look like.  Never actually seen it before.  Lmao

Lol ITS HAPPENING !!!

because it's safe to beat shit out of small group that 100% won't drop anything . so hard to understand . damn EVE , such complex gameplay
---
PREPARE THE SALT CANNONS!
---
get your popcorn boys, this gonna be gud
---
i may have over do it but due to the drifter attack the network is under huge pressure and blackout will most likely happens and may last longer
---
Pretty sure they blued / paid off dhsj for this because it sure looks like they're in range of Kamela. :P
---
Instant boner!
---
Brace yourselves... Opinions incoming.

Everything is a square hole if you're strong enough
---
Sure, if managing such a defense was truly that simple.
---
In which case, this thread wouldn't exist.
---
Haha fuck on!!!
---
Considering the SP numbers are in the LOW thousands. I believe this plan is to help the 10% retention rate for new players.
---
Not sure why you hate this. Doesn't really affect older players at all
---
Then why are they complaining so much?
---
The mixed messages here are insane.
---
glad i purchased the witcher 3 with all the DLCs since it was discounted on steam.
---
Tfw local is gone, but no one is out doing stuff because of the Drifters
---
Null is suposed to be dangerous. And, if you can't aford to lose that ship. Fly something cheaper.
---
Or maybe we're actually looking further than 15 minutes into the future.
---
As we aren't assuming that drifters will be 100% present in nullsec forever all the time.
---
The csm was the long con, to have us believe we had an ear to the ground when in fact CCP were way up in the sky
---
Oh lord. Time to stock on PVE ships

Kill 1 battle ship rat each tick. I used a blaster catalyst with a med shield extender.

I unironically love this change, I just hope the slow down the drifter attacks enough to give us all a chance to hunt each other with delayed/disabled local
---
What is the point being made?
---
Can't complain about cloaky afk pilots if you don't know they exist.
---
&gt; have been forced out of nullsec by one group or another, and as such would be unable to own structures 
---
lol.  This is dumb.
---
You know you can anchor stuff in Low, High, and WH.... right?
---
This is the problem with you null-block idiots.  You think being in Null is the only way to play EVE.
---
It is, but the warzone isn't
---
I am so excited I don't know what to do with myself.
---
As in these are newly generated default overviews after the recent launcher patch?
---
Or simply the "default" in your already existing overview settings.
---
You mean Google maps online. GL
---
I think you misunderstood me.  Maybe I wasn’t clear enough on what I meant by “this”.  I thought it would be obvious.
---
I AM SO HYPED RIGHT NOW!!
---
This better not be an event only thing.
---
Because they do pull 'pulverized asteroids', i.e. ore, i.e. jet cans that miners dump.
---
A new player likely won't know about the magic 14 at all.
---
They will know the basic skills that directly enable the use of modules. They will know afterburner, spaceship command, armor/shield, small guns/missiles.
---
The magic 14 aren't something a new player will be concerned with.
---
This means they're deleting local BTW, for non lore nerds.
---
Trillions from ratting taxes?
---
If I for some reason made 1B. ratting in one day with 10% taxes that is 100 mill of that going to the alliance. That is nothing. And that requires me to actually earn that much in the first place.
---
How many people rat and pay taxes? How many systems does the alliance own and what’s the cost of those? What other general expenses are there?

Completely removing local isn´t the greatest solution imho, but it would certainly shake things up a little bit.

This is huge. Maybe it's just delayed, maybe it's not for very long, maybe it will only be a thing for a week or 2, but who the fuck cares?

ENFER OUAIS
---
bad idea
---
I, honestly, have no PVE interest in the Drifters. But I think forcing a standing fleet to undock and go ward-off the Drifters will mean casual roaming PVP fleets will have something to fight.
---
When you are in a station that has the ability to reprocess. Right click and hit compress.
---
You’re welcome :D
---
If this reward goes live, you would hit these milestones (shooting NPCs) just by doing the career agents.
---
Where's that harden the fuck up song from ccp at? This is perfect.
---
FUCK YEAH
---
Ok so it took me 2 days to read and comprehend everything. Also I am a GSF member so thats that. After reading everything and while I think some changes would suck pretty hard, I can pretty much agree on the things you are proposing. I mean when I want to make money I am not interested in pvp all of a sudden otherwise I would love to have a more plain field and also more engagement into the game again. Especially structure grinding got me to just take a 3 week brake before the war ended. Having more possibilities to fight over something would be extremely interesting. I mean I was already thinking about leaving delve for good. Also making t3c's except the loki stronger again would be very interesting together with BLOPS so you can actually use them for battle again. 
---
I think t3c's are a bit hard because I also heard often that they are too oppressive and while I think in a normal fleet Format the hac is better I would love to see a bigger variety of specialized t3c's. 
---
Thanks for that Post.
---
That *would* explain why most features we received were lazily implemented and never further iterated upon.

It’s sad to see (outside looking in) how blue Null is. My last years in eve were fighting CFC trying to keep the good fights alive. 
---
Did a short 3-4 months in FW before the push to sov but in the end the politics ended gang career after only a year. 
---
My last six months I went full pirate helping smaller groups fight in low sec &amp; solo pvping where I could. 
---
FW  might be where I need to hangout for a while until I get my space legs back. The only good thing about running a small alliance in sov is when it imploded I became filthy rich.
---
*shrug*
---
there's nothing to log in for. there's nothing going on. drifters 1 shot pve ships, and nobody's pvping because all the structures are getting hit.
---
i'll be back along with the content.
---
I personally don't like this change, its definitely going to make isk gathering activities wayyy harder in null but it looks like its coming down the pipe no matter what now.  More destruction probably, yay?

Yeah I'll give ya that but attacking high sec is also not the answer.

That you've crafted such an elaborate justification doesn't mean that others have, too.
---
t1 exploration frigs beat these 1v1. You can fit a RIDICULOUS tank to them, and while you don't have a damage bonus, you do have some dps. You will easily kill any covops or interceptor ganker. There is even a cap stable probe fit that can permatank an astero, which is funny af to watch the astero drop his depot and refit for stabs lol.
---

---
At least the inflation would stop and game's economy would start to heal a bit.
---
&gt;This shows CCP is willing to try things to see how it turns out.
---
Not really. This is coming after 16 years.
---
ITS FUCKING HAPPENING
---
I CAN ONLY GET SO ERECT
---
1.i. I am sure YOU are OK with it :D and i wouldnt care either since im active enough to deal with any of those situations. The armor timer is the timer that is most likely to see a defense (very obvious if you talk to wormholers which were left out of your proposal completly). I think 3 timers for an important structure are totally fine if the second timer is a stront timer.
---
1.iv. Nobody engages cause there is no reason for it and it is NOT easy to counter any fleet. If the armor timer was a stront timer and therefore threatens to end up out of the defenders tz there would be an incentive to react to the intial reff already and the chance for fights increases overall.
---
2.i. btw. same as the reff time for citadels you have to be careful that it doesnt just become a tool for harassment purposes only. Constant sov or citadel harassment wont do anything good for the game im sure. (with harassment i mean slippery stuff reffing your shit like entosis bifrosts and so on)
---
4.iv. Krabs will always take risks for isks if they have to. The problem is that they will probably turn to other low-risk isk generations like highsec incursions and such. If there were 5times more targets in space nobody would complain about the current hunting chances. The problem is simply that we are missing the players/targets right now.
---
So they are going to remove local before implementing the promised intel gathering revamp...
---
Happening status: Its
---
You can also torp the shit out of miners and stuff
---
&gt; The thing is, if you are so small you can't defend several systems, maybe you shouldn't occupy several systems.
---
Essentially, that maxim should stand for all of EVE:  If you can't defend the systems you have, maybe you shouldn't have all those systems.
---
OP is talking about man-hour cost of maintaining all those systems, and not having enough man-hours for the work as if THAT is the issue, and not the fact that they've got a massive infrastructure and not enough people to maintain it.
---
Have a great holiday! (◕‿◕✿)  you should try Dauntless, it's free to play monster hunter which is cross play between PC, Xbox and PS4, incredibly fun (◕‿◕✿)
---
correct, new cam is great but shit for cinematics :\ o7
---
YES. FINALLY.
---
Bit naive there, since it's not the cloaky that's the threat but rather the cyno. If you had to fight the cloaky only and not whatever comes out of a covops cyno, there would be much less complaining about it.
---
With anoms there's also no dscan warning compared to sites, a bomber/recon can warp cloaked without probe warning and instapoint/open cyno for a gank that can't be survived, unless you rat in a ship that can tank all the damage until your counter-gank force arrives (read, supers and titans).
---
Wait it's been 4 years since the drifters first appeared?
---
Inb4 the EVE gate opens and it's used as a cheap excuse to reset the game to an overhauled launch state with a strict 1 account per player policy
---
Just hit a 5x5 deadlift PR of 315 last week. Box and swim for cardio.
---
Didn't Mittani say that CSM's input were merely "suggestions" and that they had no real sway over CCP?

I mean, the whole Anomaly rebalance back in 2011 where they took out Sanctums from lower nullsec was done between CSM's, and done pretty much right under everybody's noses without any actual input.
---
**MY BIDU IS FUCKING READY **

YYEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS THATS THE GO SIGN! IM COMING BACK BOIIIS

Yeah and half of the playerbase would fuck off too, so great for the game.

Here comes the negative nancies

Yea. People like their short-term solutions... until the long-term impact is felt.

Lets see how much hunters enjoy the lack of local when literally everybody in null-sec ends up living under the two major supercap umbrellas.

ok bye

the remote structures (*which you are attempting to use as an argument point*) are not the issue and are typically dropped with the idea they could be easily blown up by hostiles so the risk is already calculated and the "*already replaced*" has already been considered.
---
Eve is beautiful
---
It's showing they're trying now
---
Too late? Maybe, but at least they're finally taking risks rather than trying to milk +1 rorqual account from goons for every lost customer.
---
today i enjoyed eve
---
&gt; We estimate that the 18,000 toons TEST has translates to about 4000 living and breathing humans active at least once any given month, with 2500-3000 active a few times given week, 500-1000 unique actives per day
---
STFU.
---
This is amazing! All they need to do now is rework this window: [https://i.imgur.com/Vs6gyuK.png](https://i.imgur.com/Vs6gyuK.png)  
---
As an imperfect intel tool - show gangs as signatures, small gangs can move unnoticed, big onces should be visible region wide, if big fleets spread out across 5 jumps they can move unnoticed but become more vulnerable.
---
i don't know what they've put in the water in reykjavik recently, but I am really liking this new ccp. please keep stirring things up and changing the game ccp, things are really starting to get exciting again.
---
That may be true, but if that 1 structure was all your 20-30 man group owned defense would be simple.
---
Sounds like Asset Recovery will be next
---
If all of the super risk averse turbo krabs and bots left who would give a fuck?  Null NEEDS to be shaken up because it's stale and dead and THAT my friend will kill the game just as sure as everyone rage quitting.
---
yay death death death death  (◕‿◕✿)
---
ou sh.. it hit the fan
---
But this is also where we are now
---
How so?

Way harder than literally risk free?  Cowboy the fuck up nullbear.

Who are they going to attack? Almost nobody live in WH space anymore

Inb4 it doesn't get awarded retroactively and people are gonna flip their shit

It might make some of them more profitable.

Less competition

Finally! The first step in the right direction! Make null dangerous again!

Lol of course it’s a goonie bitching about it. This is such a great change.
---
Then why the fuck is everyone crying about it?
---
Please please let this be the case.  Rebalanced the near2 equation.
---
Oh God. Please let this be true.
---
People lived in null before asset safety, when it was actually somewhat risky.
---
*laughs in my C1 wormhole*
---
Then why are people complaining so much about needing to babysit them?
---
They have covert-ops cloaks...
---
Plus from Jester’s AMA it really sounds like (at least 5 years ago) it was exceptionally difficult to get CCP to hear out a player’s idea.
---
Best gang xo best add a huggin or 2 and a Lachesis just to be safe 👍

But where am I going to scam people?

Get ready for people running D-scan scripts to spam it real time all day long.
---
Not well though.  Asset safety was one of the good changes.
---
:dagger:
---
They arent trying. This is nothing. Cynos are a bigger problem than local.
---
Salt post number 1.
---
Not a bad start.
---
OK NOW WHAT?
---
shout out to bombers bar for the fun fleets, always a pleasure to fly with you all~ ✿◕‿◕✿
---
80km neuts boiiii
---
I had to look back at my old rantings that I've put on the internet just to get a good time of when this was.  A shame the devblogs I referenced in that ramble are no longer available.
---
Salt post number 2 prepare for a long day guys.
---
Well, people are going to adapt and place eyes on every entrance to their ratting pocket. I also assume krabs are going to concentrate a lot more into singular systems and standing fleets, rather than be spread out thin.  
---
But rolling into a system via a WH is going to be legit scary one way or another.
---
Seems fairly obvious. Null-sec residents will stop mining/ratting in isolated areas and move under the nearest super umbrella, where pocket entrances will be scouted and response fleets on standby. After a brief crash-course on how to fit cynos onto your krabbing ships, they'll go back to krabbing as normally.
---
I predict that 3 months into a "no local" null-sec, we'll have two extremely active null regions in the game and the rest will be empty of everything except relic bots.
---
The end of botting is near. I smell the tears of the RMTers already
---
When you first try to enter a triglavians system, it will make you hit a dialog. Of you think you might autopilot, don't check "don't show me this again".
---
You'll want it to protect you.
---
But also, look at your routes for triangle systems.
---
I'm not a nullbear (currently) and no when I was out in null it definitely wasnt risk free.  I wonder if CCP is going to give Null sec a tool to find cloakies?
---
I think DHSJ either just didn't know about this timer or (more likely) it was too deep in EUTZ. Besides DHSJ is definitely not the 'big fish' in the area. That would be Korea Town (Siege Green) or more recently China Town (Infinity Avenger).
---
Now you know how it feels to be on the other side of all the bullshit the Goons have pulled over the years as a random player. :D
---
This schadenfreude is so, so good.
---
If you're in a capital under an umbrella then probably nothing will change. If you're not in a capital under an umbrella then you're playing EVE wrong in 2019.
---
get a lachesis :p
---
'Adapt or die'
---
Don't they also web?
---
So you can get your freighters into warp faster
---
Nice propaganda post
---
I guess since Goons/Test couldn't win people over with all the whining and "convincing" analytical posts they're going to start making Reddit accounts pretending to be the small guy that they keep saying this is going to hurt worse than them. 
---
How pathetic do you have to be to go to the lengths you guys go for some of this shit?
---
Bots still see you on dscan, but surely you can get easy tackle on them now with bombers and maybe a fit-for-the-job Lach.
---
And V keys everywhere screamed in terror.
---
What about gas mining? Worth?
---
Guess I'll just die?
---
A fun day if you are a Wormholer...

Because he can't bot now.  Thats why he doesn't like it.
---
This playerbase actively shuns anything that might make the game accessible to *literally any fresh players*.
---
I give EVE 3 good years plus 2 bad ones and then CCP moves on cuz the money won't work out anymore.
---
personaly i'm neutral on al this drifter stuff, i just don't want the game to have an even lower active player base.
---
I'm crying right now.
---
Tears of joy and I'm not exaggerating.
---
I love you CCP.
---
I've never seen such balls of steel. &lt;3
---
Please remember to donate your corpse to the drifter overlords
---
I’m not sure I get it. Why would this be a bad thing?
---
So fucking hard right now
---
i am. to whatever fictional world the witcher is set in.
---
Oh no you will have to actively defend your space, set up camps on bug pipes and engage in PvP ? The horror !
---
Thanks for the link
---
i remember.
---
the player count nosedived faster than a stalling plane.
---
Later in the video they state that it might be down for a week or so. Sounds like to me that this is a part of the event and not a permanent change(?)
---
get fucked lololol
---
No, Concord is throttling their quantum fluid thingamajiggy. Who is this CCP you people keep talking about. YOU'RE RUINING MY IMMERSION!

Woah. If this is real I may resub.
---
So pretty much no difference then
---
love it
---
I sure hope the citadels where my long-mothballed capital fleet is collecting dust have been destroyed by now
---
Wouldn't doubt it but it won't save them from Recons.
---
Losing 5000 players that don't play the game in the exact same manner you do doesn't change the fact that 5000 players just left.
---
Get a fking balls, fly solo .
---
Fucking fleet monkeys
---
Maybe it's the goal ?
---
I was using a DST, but yes the web was helpful... I kind of panicked when I saw all those ewar effects, but they don't point.
---
Plot twist. Null players too scared to undock threaten to Burn Jita until CCP 'open the door' so they have something to do with their isk... ;)
---
If you have over 100 mil SP and you're still fucking sperging out over such a small amount of SP, you need to put the game down and go outside. You obviously are wayyyyyy too invested in a game for it to be healthy
---
No point to make money in that case so number of active accounts will hit the floor. This will be fun to watch.
---
It wasn't, though. Outposts existed.
---
&gt;only bots and people who dock up as soon as something is in intel 5 jumps out, wont login anymore ... eve doesnt need either
---
Null has always had complete asset safety in the form of stations. Sure you might lose docking access but you can always get it back by parking an alt into whatever alliance owns it or by fireselling everything.
---
Good. Then we can have resource scarcity again.
---
Gankers have literally always targeted industrials.
---
Not undocking or keeping alts on gates.
---
Tons of open space? Somewhere a small entity might want to set up shop.
---
I hope this is just the lore part of some impactful changes. I used to be one of the no-local lovers but over time i changed my mind and settle in between with a slightly delayed local. So thats what im hoping for. Short term no local chaos and then long term a local with \~10-15sec delay. Worst case this is getting all rolled back and nothing changes at all :X
---
iOS is BSD and macOS service. It is unix-like but it is not unix based
---
Eve needs less players like you. Bye.
---
Upvoted for salt. I hope it's unironic.
---
I'm not sure why it matters what they are
---
I'm more concerned it would break the server. Also, Fozzie mentioned that same concern. Personally, I don't see fun in spamming a V key every 5 seconds all day long. It's why I didn't play a bard in EQ and why Wow got old 10 years ago with its frenetic turbo slam pace.
---
Fair, what are your thoughts on this Mauti?
---
Thanks for this.  I've been making this very point, to no avail, for ages.
---
&gt;I also assume krabs are going to concentrate a lot more into singular systems and standing fleets, rather than be spread out thin.
---
**Good**.  People living in null as a cohesive unit working together is a fucking glorious thing.  Sounds like we might get *actual fights* instead of ganking solo rafters once every 5 hours
---
Oh, boy. Just when I was considering going back to eve. There's no way I'm missing this one
---
Because! How can I dock my 6 rorqs, 18 VNIs and undock my 3 titans to get those jerks who want to kill me! I have to actually pay attention to D-Scan and intel is hard now! I can’t just AFK for 16 hours!
---
/s
---
Not yet. I'd advise against it. 
---
Most gas is worthless. The good stuff is hard to find, and dangerous to mine. Wait until you know the game better.
---
Well, Anyone hunting ratters/miners will go to places like Delve, Esoteria, Branch and Detorid for lots of targets. You might be safer taking your Ishtar or rorq to somewhere less populated.
---
And anyone who notices their presence will bring two or three dudes and entirely shut down their shit. ggwp.
---
If there's no local cloaky camping isn't a problem. So hopefully not
---
**Prepare for the great content drought of our time**

This is number 2 actually, someone beat him to the punch but then deleted their thread.
---
Here's to many more to follow.
---
\*Quickly checks the calendar to make sure it's not April 1st\*
---
Ironic seeing as stalling planes dont nosedive until the pilot decides to correct the stall
---
And your isk to me, shotgun
---
Can l get a refound for plexes I have and time already sibscribe?
---
Oh hell yeah!!! I didn't even think of that!
---
That's actually what killed the game for me! Getting into PVP involved wayyyy to much wait time. I'd usually end up playing another game at the same time on a different screen.
---
I'm guessing that's why multi-boxing is so common. Only just realized that now YEARS later.... Wow I feel stupid....
---
*pops every fucking kernel of corn on earth*
---
Intel channels still exist, players just won't be able to semi afk sites just waiting for that local list to flash before warping away. Sounds like you guys in null just need to be more vigilant.
---
Om nom relic bots, that'll be good for my isk/hr. If null gets that tightly packed I think a LOT of people will fuck off to other space.
---
Let me tell you that if they have to drop on every tackled domi in a world with no local, we're gonna have a good time raiding.
---
"Made ya drop" -&gt; in ...oh shit there's no local. I hope it works like wormholes so we can shit up local while instawarping t3ds woopwoopwoop out.
---
Its a Test how many ppl are not going to login to the game and a check if ccp can deal with it.
---
The 'less bandwidth' could mean a delayed local and the 'fuel' they mentioned could influence how much the delay is. Or it's just CCP using drifters as a scapegoat for their patchy chat system.
---
Nope.  To many assume their way of playing the game is the only way to play the game.
---
I assume something you do generates isk.  Or stuffs.  Some of those stuffs are transportable.  Move them to an NPC station or to Jita.  Or sell them at a discount and buy some stuffs in Jita (or PLEX).  
---
EvE's magic has always been the actual risks involved.  Otherwise it is just farmville in space.  You can plan around the risk.
---
I have never been in an alliance that would sacrifice its independence for sov.  So we always assumed we could lose a lot of our mass when we had to move.  This didn't keep us from doing PI, or ratting, mostly for ADMs, or even recruiting hisec newbies to mine in our couple of systems.  Some of them ended up joining and becoming bloodthirsty PvP'rs, because it they learned form bloodthirsty pvp'rs.
---
But we always knew we didn't have enough nerds to hold the space from a much larger entity that really wanted it.  I promise most of what you have in value will fit in an LST or your cap (or someone else's cap).  One halfway decent wormhole and it is all in a much safer place.
---
Declaration of war from goons on HS/LS/WH in 3......2......1.......
---
Can you imagine an unsafe NULLsec? The absolute horror, CCP should reconsider for the sake of nullbears everywhere!
---
It's poor word choice by CCP, but they mean the mined ore from your ship which you can jettison in a little container.
---
Love it 👍
---
Too bad I already spent it all on force recon cruisers
---
&gt;no local is the best thing ever, i'm going to go hunting all day
---
the same people
---
&gt;good i'm glad you're leaving, don't come back.
---
so, who are you going to hunt?
---
Dammit. I was slow on the upkeep!
---
I mean, if you want to grind a character up using just the bonus SP, more power to you. I'll talk to you in a few years when you can actually do something with it, if the game is still around
---
well TIL.
---
There is also the "Blackout' part
---
I don't think your ship stays cloaked if you logoff with the cloak on.
---
Yeah, I mean still it's confusing and I'm surprised people didn't say something when it came out, regardless of how long it's been around.
---
A glorious day.
---
Next step of boring PvE content: Escort missions for CONCORD resupply fleets!
---
On the other hand, how bad is losing local if the only thing you are doing is trying to fight something that you cannot D-Scan nor see in local anyway?
---
If you cant live without local just move to high sec  or low sec
---
I beleave that what you actually head was: "Compress the ore"

---
I'd be perfectly fine with them limiting it to an event in order to properly test it out, it's a reasonable approach. 
---
Then again, just breaking things and seeing what happens is also fine by me.
---
i'm not sperging about it.
---
i'm pointing out the value of free sp is greater for a high SP player.
---
for a new player to inject 500,000 SP costs 1bn isk.
---
what would it cost some one with 80m SP plus? it'd cost about 3.3bn. 
---
it's objectively worth more to a high sp player than a low sp player higher sp players have significantly more incentive to participate in this content than new  players.
---
Processing = getting minerals from ores. Minerals have much higher volume than compressed ores. Haul them in compressed state and refine near market or manufacturing plant. Mineral amount is depending on facility and skills and implants.
---
Reprocessing = modules, ships and stuff turned back into minerals. Only affected by your "Scrapmetal reprocessing" skill. Same yield anywhere afaik.
---
iirc these guys were on the losing side
---
Note the player numbers jumping back up last night already. It was a bluff, CCP called it.
---

That's very much untrue, mate. There are small alliances and other nomadic groups all over null-sec right now.
---
FUCK YES BABY !!! KEEP IT UP DRIFTERS !!!
---
No shit, but it clearly implies it does something completely different. Like how is explaining this that hard to people from Eve. 
---
The description is wrong and half of you idiots would rather keep a wrong description than one that properly says what it does. 
---
If a Missle Turret says it can use any missile and you find out you can't use the auto-track ones. Then wouldn't you be frustrated?
---
no, that not what they said. They said full services will not be supported for more than another week or so. there was no mention of a end time.
---
Oh noes 5000 less instawarping totally legit VNIs and super carriers just left the game.  Wutevar will we do?  Eve is now kill.
---
except you didn't also loose players, but won some of the old ones back.
---
I'm gonna come back for this so much.
---
!reminder 2 weeks how dumb does this guy's comment look now

You are a dumb ass. WH space has been raking in ISK for nearly a decade without local and I don't see posts every day crying about how hard it is to live there.

And after they will cry.

Blackout : At start people will continue to farm. .. And a lot will die.
---
2 month after: all place will be neatr empty unless on super umbrella... Content of the game in 0.0 will be divided by a lot. If CCP add no asset safety a lot of player will just never come back. 
---
So change it is an error actually. Unless you change some other part of gameplay.

Only 5 years or so too late...

I imagine being loose or tight won't have much to do with things.

None of us are flipping out. These drifters are of little threat to us. What we are, is just annoyed.
---
I'd hardly call that flippin out.
---
CCP already introduced a 3 second cool down for dscan, like 4 years ago and everyone adjusted. They can just up it to or use it as a metric to spot bot- sorry, legitimate players who are spamming dscan every second it's off cool down for hours at a time.

It's going to reduce isk faucets by greatly cutting down anom ratting. Good.

if you can't rat/mine then just undock and PVP and actually enjoy the game. what a utopian New-Eden it would be...
---
this is gonna be epic
---
holy fuck nvm im not taking a break from eve
---
I took that as them saying it might be a week before it goes down, not that it would be down for a week.
---
This isn't really feasible everywhere. Will people do it? Sure. But you can also get around it with log off traps, wormholes, bridges, tons of other shit.
---
Guess should've expected such a retarded answer. Sorry for not perfect in speaking / writing English. Not even my mother tongue.
---
I feel like this is the meme. People resub, event ends, local back, "lolthanksforthesubsidiots" -ccp
---
I am a high/low sec player with no structure and not much money. I am looking at what you call end game and it looks like shit.
---
If it's not permanent from now on, then there is no god
---
well idk if its really worth it to bring dreads/subcaps for 2-3 capitals on a hostile anticapital fort, when you have no stakes on either side. Now if supers were involved it would be a different thing.
---
This is reddit and a tongue in cheek answer is quite acceptable. I'm sorry you are a special snowflake and flipped your shit.
---
Did you seriously confuse him with Matterall? How do you even do that?
---
I actually can't wait, got to respect CCP for manning up and trying some new stuff. Looking forward to see how it all plays out.
---
Can't you just manually asset safety them even if you're not subbed? Since they're mothballed anyway.
---
I interpreted it as local in null would be reduced to delayed for a week or so, and then might have to be fully turned off if invasion escalates more.
---
I never said anything about flipping out? You’re the one who said that
---
When everyone in nullsec is flying a Curse.  Welcome to the Thunderdome.

I could see botters posting cloaky alts to inbound gates. When bot #1 sees someone jump in and show up on the overview, bots #2-20 dock up.

Fuck YES CCP!

Great post, I'm struggling to find anything I disagree with: I'm not sold on the passive moon mining thing, because you can definitely subcap mine those and I see no reason to put the whole thing back under alliance control instead of the single player, but I guess harvesting lower quality ores is reasonable. 
---
I still give your post a 10/10: I really think you nailed it as the key to a healthier game is not turning backwards but going forward, tweaking some questionable changes that have been made in the past to better serve the overall content and ultimately the fun you can get out of the game. Also, one more thing I liked is that you didn't go for the easy way of "screw rorquals and proliferation reeeeeeeeee" as 99% of this sub does, but provided well thought, easy solution to widely recognised problems, gj.
---
I'm looking forward to your post #2 and hope CCP listens to your advice.

I second chocolate. Of course who knows that the null embargo will do to prices. But typically if you find a WH to mine gas in you can be in it for about 15 min before sleepers show up. And they will insta pop you. Your best bet is to work towards a procurer with T2 strip miners/miner upgrades/ and drones.  It’s nice and AFK able.
---
When!? I must know when!? I want to binge play the game without local when my wife is out of town.
---
Yeah null is becoming a giant worm hole

VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

Fuck the players. Eve was great when it was just 5k-8k of us. Now, if removing the bots (or giving the real players a chance of catching them) generates some collateral damage from lost subscriptions, so be it.
---
I think EVE could really use a cataclysmic event that upsets the status quo every now and then, so this is good.
---
...as an event. 
---
Not sure if this is going to be great for player retention in the long run. The kind of player that would stick around would have to have a different mindset in order to "survive" this. That's probably good for the game, but terrible for sub counts.

everytime i heard that local wasn't working, and i was not logged in. I basically ran to my pc to get logged in. All these juicy bots to farm...
---
\*curse warps behind you\*
---
\*nothin personnel kid\*
---
I see, Things are really that bad there huh?
---
Probably but tbh I haven't been subbed since shortly after citadels came out and dont really know how asset safety works.  My gaming PC died unexpectedly and I kind of realized I was better off without Eve in my life so I never really got a chance to properly put my affairs in order.
---
no one is complaining about those if you actually read the shit you are responding to
---
&lt;3
---
THANK YOU CCP!!!!! Brings risk back to null! I havent been this excited for an in game change in years!
---
SQUEEEEEEEE

It's not un idea anymore, be ready

The 'Blackout' part could mean if you dont have enough 'fuel' you wont get any local.

so just like now? provi and geminate lmao

Why should living in null-security have a safety feature?

Change that pladin to a ship capable of running tier 4 abyss an you will have at least double the income of blitzed l4 high sec missions.

Ho boy o boy o boy ...

now I dont have a choice but to return to EVE...
---
eve's literally built on those 2 existing.
---
who the fuck are you going to shoot if they don't exist? it's not like you're looking for a fight if those are the people you're hunting - the only people affected by this change that's apparently the best thing ever.
---
Please never ever stop making videos like this.

Yeah, they're probably going to have to upgrade.
---
It is. EOT.
---
There were NPC stations...was that not safe for assets?
---
The Scope is the officials.
---
You can already spot players in space on the map, but it's delayed and opens up for some more sneaky manoeuvres... :)
---
Hmm. Probably not outside prime TZ. I mean if it was me I'd come up with something, because it's an opportunity to fuck with people and I always take those. Even if it's just bridging fofo ecm burst drakes into the middle of it for the memes.
---
Outposts could never hold titans/supers. Asset safety for those is dumb.
---
It's right, your interpretation is wrong
---
Recons 5 in queue
---
godbless ccp working during the summer
---
So eve has a semi-regulated market that you can easily bust into. The way most people start is by station trading. That is buy low, sell high. You make some good isk (in game currency) somewhat quickly by doing that. From there you can move into production. Production does take a while though, and, depending, is easier with multiple characters.
---
For actually killing alliances (eves name for cartels) its a little different. They have thousands of members so they can be hard to get. They also tend to have large supercap (big, powerful ships mean for fighting each other) fleets that they only use to harass subcaps (ships that the majority of players fly) that are annoying them. That said, where they live, Null Security Space, is currently on fire due to the based drifters. So things may go through a shake up soon
---
Its time to come back Friend. Also join Dreddit now.
---
If you mean corps/alliances: Join them, gain their trust, gain power, fuck them over from the inside.
---
YESSSS YESSSSSSS YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
---
This is gon be good!
---
Be ccp:
---
&gt;come out with a radical way to completely spice up null and create an event that allows an entire region to be rfed in a day, allowing smaller entities to swoop and and assist in wreaking havoc and drive player content
---
Be player base:
---
&gt;Only response is players being whiny bitches about it and reinforce their blue donut stance and instead declare war on CCP
---
This is a player problem, not an event problem.  Get out there and fuck with each other instead of overanalyzing the event and complain about having to undock.
---
I'm sorry dran but I expected better.
---
Get your filthy super drop away from me. I get enough of those in detorid.
---
I think if it more as a flat spin than falling. :-)
---
HOLY FUCKING YES EVE IS FINALLY DYING
---
Back to boring gate camps 23/7.  Fucking marvelous gameplay, thanks CCP.
---
I reactivated a hunter account or two
---
That is literally exactly what they said.
---
If this is true I'm very tempted to do so too
---
yeah but then we're really speaking of a wildly different tz
---
Well with money, you aren't at endgame anyway.
---
But even with no money you can go shoot people.
---
It's just the game. No end.
---
Hmm yhea.  im skilling mining IV and will try to buy a procurer
---
But how will I trigger people with my mere existence in a dead corp
---
Right, and if they have any balls they still will be.
---
"you can't blops in a wormhole"

you can't counter drop either.

Don't forget to get your Little Gold Plated Medal from your resident commissar for denouncing the new excitement on the way out Comrade.

And I hope you step in a puddle and your trousers get wet and it transfers to your socks !
---
To allow the ability to actually live in the space and be able to afk due to RL.  I will never accept an argument based on making it crippling if RL screws you over.  I do, however, support upping the cost of asset safety and adding more loot to the citadel wrecks.
---
Nullseccer btw
---
People moving to lowsec?
---
This is quite possibly the best change ever.
---
Exactly, people using teamwork will survive.
---
Solo ratters and bots will find it more difficult making easy isk in null-sec
---
It hasnt.
---
same thing as when the new chat system broke null.
---
people didn't bother logging in.
---
please shut up, trying to be edgy doesn't really work for you
---
&gt; dreaming of an empire
---
This is where you and I differ.... you'd prefer to be someone elses peon, whereas I am my own man.
---
hence butter
---
Hmm possibly, yes
---
Finally killing cloaky camping good job CCP
---
For the past years CCP didn't listen to wormholers. I think they have forgotten why. 
---
In other words: WTS Popcorn, 5m isk a bucket.
---
That's true,  but I'm excited to find out.  The game is already fucked, so we might as well go full on crazy
---
Nullsec is about to get rolled over, prepare your torpos boyos!
---
or they could, you know, fix insta gate sliding
---
luckily there are wormholes :-)
---
wonder who supplies the raw materials needed for recon ships, they will make a killin'
---
This will make anom ratting harder, yes. You can run npc null missions, combat sites, relic/data exploration, or prepare counterdrops. You can also rat away from the fucking warpin point, rat aligned to a safe (rattlesnake, dominix, carrier), etc.
---
Exaggerating quite a bit, but I’m sure some people have set ups along those lines
---
So then I payed for one month of Eve without  local and I got one month of Eve without local.
---
Tags only boost you up to 0 sec status so only good if your starting from negative sec.
---
Must be way too hard to fight a small gang off
---
I talk shit, but this is the most seriously I've been considering resubbing in a while.
---
I'mma be honest, I was so excited typing this I repeated myself and forgot a couple of words.
---
I don't think this plays out how you anticipate it will
---
Its a lore reason for them to test out the change live, then decide if its worth keeping
---
*Grammatically challenged player 3 has joined the game*
---
You can log back in as an Alpha. I do it from time to time to see what's happening.
---
times 20 in fleet ... enough i'd say :P
---
it makes sense that you post a stupid reply cause you're too stupid to understand context. the two kind of go hand in hand
---
&gt;Let's see how much hunters enjoy *conquering* all of null sec from "players" who don't want to undock.
---
I'm going to go with "a lot"?
---
1: warp to refuge
---
2: approach wave spawn point
---
3: ????
---
4: Disco
---
Wow, this is now starting to interest me, well done ccp for having the balls to do this. All null seccers complaining about this can go fuck themselves, blue donuts, rental empires, allowing bots, taking more space than you need, etc... you brought this on yourself
---
If you want a place with no local, move to wh space.
---
You should be fine in such a ship but I would advise to google a “T1 Procurer Fit” and at the very least be sure you can fly EVERYTHING on that fit before you get one.
---
I would hate to see you work so hard for a ship and lose it to suicide gankers before you get your monies worth out of it.
---
Can I bring my drake?
---
I fly solo a lot but tbf I have the most fun when flying with about 4 other guys all good friends, small/micro gang is life in eve. 
---
I just have more fun with friends so would most I wager it is an mmo after all
---
have a great vacation, you deserve it :)
---
Do they dock up forever? How long do I cloaky camp after that? :3
---
You can move to lowsec. We still have local.
---
You ever bot so hard that you killed local?
---
Yeah, I'm not sure how some of these retards thought they were going to strong-arm they're crack dealer
---
YES!!!!
---
i sure fucking hope so thx fam
---
If it wasn't clear... announces news *to Reddit* before the officials do.
---
I've only ever considered the csm as a feedback loop, a sounding board for whatever CCP deigns to share.
---
But WOONA is dead.... Dreddit is still alive!
---
About fucking time.
---
Exactly. Hunters always talk about looking for a fight but as soon as people fight back they fuck off.
---
Get rekt botter

---
CCP is to stupid for that.
---
They're plan il to offer a lot of easy kill to pvp player to make they continue to play resub and other thing. 
---
But they forget people could just stop the game and fuck the whole plan.
---
THEYRE TURNIN THE FRIGGIN FROGS GOONS
---
worried about your bot setup?
---
Can you explain the logic why that's the case?
---
If they delete local I will be so happy. It benefits the residents as much as it does the hunters. Remember half or more of nullsec is completely empty. But now you will never know that a system is empty unless you do the work to scan it and for organized groups like goons we will just develop out of game tools to do what we do in game now.
---
Isk gathering in null has historically been one of the easiest and safest isk-faucets to tap due to local and intel channels.
---
WTF?! I love CCP now! 
---
Next big step reduce anomaly spawn by 50% make players spread out more and I think Eve is saved!
---
Doesn't matter what you think CCP is already going ahead with it.
---
It makes fine sense. I don't have a dog in the fight and I can see the current state of null (it could be a temporary event) is not compelling.
---
Maybe you don't have a job. Maybe you have never been on call 24/7. But at least they were paying me to do work. If CCP is telling me as a new player, " Come do fake work, for a fake world, and pay us for the privilege ". The answer is no.
---
IMHO a game has to be fun or compelling. I can't help but agree that the current state of null is neither.
---
Funny thing, imo, the so called roamers will be the ones complaining in a few months ... when they will be pipebombed and bosoned on every gate.
---
With the amount of salt this change would create I can salt ALL THE POPCORN IN NEW EDEN
---
They have vastly different AI and behavior
---
so like a drifter, but with shit dps, and less friends.
---
Too bad the "elite pvp hunters" will just run away as soon as you try to fight back.
---
Are you implying there is content now?
---
Imagine assembling a titan out of a hangar container. How the hell does it fit in there?
---
Because whenever you blew up a POS, it immediately dropped all of the supercaps that were logged off inside it, yes?
---
Somewhere else as in not-nullsec? Gee, what an opportunity. I'm pretty intrigued by how null might end up looking like in a couple weeks, perhaps there will be a much bigger focus on fleet activities, with so much danger from players and npcs alike. But right now? Living in null sec is quite literally just chilling in the stations, because my alliance, for example, simply doesn't have the resources to deal with random out-of-nowhere npc attacks.
---
Tell me a story daddy. How does it turn out?
---
ReconGang ReconGang ReconGang ReconGang
---
How could 2-3 dudes shut down their shit just because they can't see who's in local?
---
It works both ways, the 2-3 dudes don't know how many are docked in station.
---
&gt; Because of how folks get notified of structures being hit works (as Dran discusses a bit) if no one with access to those roles was around to notify line members,
---
So... 
---
1) More infrastructure than people to defend/man them.
---
&gt; more active players essentially did as Dran described and got into caps/supers and dropped on what could be located.
---
2) Sufficient people to defend/man your infrastructure
---
&gt; When the timers rolled around for anchoring SF structures people had had enough of Eve for the day.  As a result we were unable to contest them, though a few noble souls tried their best.
---
3) More infrastructure than people to defend/man them.
---
&gt; one of the most prolific structure spamming entities in Eve. 
---
4) Seems like a problem your group has, as well, just based on what you've been saying here.
---
&gt; Brave flat out isn't large enough and its players not spread across enough time zones to both engage them and do null PvP.
---
5) More infrastructure than people to defend/man them.
---
The solution seems to be staring you right in the face:
---
Don't bite off more than you can chew.
---
Botters already have Intel figured out.
---
Thanks CCP for giving us cloaky camper at every relic site. If I wanted to burn my sanity because of paranoia, I would go to WH. If you pull of this shit, at least make cloak DScan-able, then it would be alright.
---
I hope not :/ that was a good change.
---
I think they're going to bring back local with a player made structure. They're way too specific about the fuel that runs the communications array. Let's hope it doesn't have multiple structure timer.
---
Find an empty wormhole
---
Setup a station and get it online
---
Plan your PI route with the planets you have (plenty of websites to help with this, make sure you take a good amount of time to PLAN it out before just going into it.)
---
Make all factory planets
---
Import the p1 you need from jita
---
Move them to p1&gt;p2 factory planets
---
Move the p2 to &gt;p3 factory planets

---

---
Sell.
---
More characters = more time = more money.
---
Personally at max efficiency I was making around 9b\~/w after paying for my stuff.
---
About 2h of work every 2 days after setup, just stockpile end product and start product so you can just pick a day to transport it once you get a good WH to jita, and restock.
---
Two hours may not seem like a lot for that amount of isk, but trust me, it's a LOOONG two hours.
---
Praise our drifter overlords, praise no more complaining about cloaky campers or Intel channels. (reees at sun).
---
Probably but remember folks, *they probably won't try to blackmail CCP about it.*
---
Or now, you can be anywhere!
---
Either get characters to camp the pipe to the Drifter-free portion of your ratting grounds, or take two more minutes to scan down some red sites that hunters won't be able to access without combat probes and Drifters won't be able to get to at all.   
---
Protective gate camps are great - the first hunter dies, then the combat scales up and generates solid mid-scale, "objectiveless" fights as people come to break up the camp. We had one of those in Deklein a couple of nights ago, and it was only because the VNIs finally had to move around to less-Driftered systems - and needed to be protected with a camp as they moved.
---
enlighten me
---
they're not deleting local you retard. they're messing with it temporarily
---
If it's dead it's because those who can pvp became krabs....
---
I am shit, I am resubbing. Join the shit train
---
So, players were not undocking due to the risk of getting instapopped by undetectable npcs and CCPs solution was to add the risk of getting normally popped by a player you could have, in all fairness, dscanned? Guess I'm not making any ISK outside of PI for some time. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm also against instant free intel. But where's the point in doing it *now*? Atleast we'll get a bot genocide lol
---
They're putting chemicals in the Quafe!!
---
I was on vacation and didn't yet spend much time ingame... Another week implies local was somewhat affected already?      
---
I didn't read anything about that, only drifters here, drifters there.
---
Are you drunk?
---
Why? Local combined with intel channels also suppressed content as it was incredibly easy to just dock-up and hide when "content" showed up.
---
If this is permanent I may well join you, and I legit had no intention of doing so. Recon nerds are about to get a pay rise, and spies have another avenue to throw spinners in the works.
---
Put a cloaky ship in their space, and just leave it there. All the bad players return to station and cry about being 'camped-in'. 
---
Do this on a large enough scale, over a long enough period, you can destroy large organisations.
---
Only three periods? Couldn't manage a fourth and a smh....... Smh low effort reply
---
both citadels and NPC stations (the only stations left) have indicators for how many are docked lmao
---
ALL HAIL CCP FOR DOING GODS WORK &lt;3
---
Yep. I reckon so.
---
An (Ishukone?) fleet also showed up in Semiki hisec last night during the shenanigans with the Sansha, Drifter, and Triglavian fleets having a bust-up in between bashing ARC structures into hull.
---
They tried attacking Concord too funnily enough, but it didn't provoke a response, and Concord just tanked like a boss ;)
---
I love it, eve is getting back to it's roots, where everything is dangerous and unpredictable, and it's being a sandbox game again, at least in NS, which is no places for newbies and pussies!
---
Oh well since YOU have been saying it.

DAFUQ is Tango-4 Helium Super-Fluid and whats this Fluid Router mumbo jumob with faster than light communication? where can I get this to upgrade my shitty home internet.
---
or, i can just dust off my alt that doesn't reside in null sec, and make more isk while suffering less loss.
---
or, i can just play another game entirely.
---
People will run out of space to mine fairly quickly.
---
Calling someone else a retard, for taking your flair at face value, and jumping on them for it.
---
Yeah...  Hello, Pot.
---
and then ccp reduces anomalies per system and they're fucked
---
If you want dangerous space move to null, ow wait..
---
You are well within your rights to do either.
---
What they need to add is to add a cyno inhibitor module. Maybe on a script on the Heavy Interdictor? Heck, it could be good on a new T2 "Super Heavy Interdictor" battleship, or on a new T2 Triglavian Heavy Interdictor.
---
*BUT THINK OF THE CHILDREN!*
---
How will it hurt the small guys? They have much less space to spread around normally.
---
Thank god that wow classic is released next month goodbye CCP
---
It's adapt or win eve.
---
In the end you become a peon aswell just you denie it whilst i embrace it and make the Best out of it
---
When you can't make PvE more engaging so the only qay you can punish botters is by turning null into wormhole space
---
You're not wrong. My point was/is the drifter assaults, if sustained, radically alter the "how much can I bite off?" pat of the equation.
---
Instagratifico
---
K Space drifters just got a shit FC
---
Hard to tell if this is part of the event, or just CCP predicting their shit comms are going to bork out.
---
To be sure more people stop the game? Great.
---
just adapt lol
---
Btw... wtf is the "Caille rogue drone cultural exchange society", and why aren't they firebombed every bloody night?
---
The amount of destruction will spike and then fall, along with the number of ships in space.
---
&gt; running away 10 systems from where you are.
---
Still gonna do this, removing local does not help against intel channels and scouted gates.
---
Or a local chat service module, I would wager.
---
♫ BRING ON THE POPCORN MACHINE! ♫
---
Saw the news, logged in from work, moved Recon Ships V to top of cue.
---
so basically CCP is saying its easier to make up lore reasons for the chat to break all the time than it is to fix it...
---
Your clearly dont have a clue what I think.  I am actually a huge advocate of helping and retaining newbros.  So dont make assumptions.
---
&gt; join small corp that will have to sit 24/7 watching over their astra.
---
This tells me you haven't had to deal with Drifters attacking your cit, at all, because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
---
One person can easily defend a half dozen properly fitted cits, solo.  It's been done, and posted about, plenty of times in the last few days.  STFU.
---
&gt;  it will hurt the little guy more than the aliances capable of having 50-100 ppl in a standing hunting fleet
---
The little guy doesn't own sov in null sec. 
---
At most, he does null roams and will benefit from no local.
---
Because krabs and the dudes who actually defend the space are the same people?
---
Not when cloaked they aren't.
---
What I was thinking... new gang concepts will pop up like nullified t3s and while they are still hitting grid on one cyno you're moving on, killing people while the save fleet has red timer...
---
They're spodbrain 0.0 folks that haven't ever had to deal with them before so they simply don't know.
---
I like this idea.  
---
    
---
Nulsecer... btw.
---
isnt local always broken anyway, nothing really new here...now i can fly oblivious to any threats, i am not even gonna do d scans as thats cheating.
---
There is a distinct difference between expecting local to work but it's broken in weird ways and local being changed deliberately.
---
What i wonder is weither it makes hunting more difficult without being able to identify potential targets in local.
---
Yeah, it should just be easy to make ridiculous amounts of ISK with very little risk. People are so fucking laid back they can't live without local. Do you know what dscan is? The bigger alliances have fucking problems that pull intel from channels and pings when enemies are X jumps out.. LAZY.
---
Does this mean the hand of bob is reaching out and grabbing null sec by the balls?

"Caille rogue drone cultural exchange society offices firebombed"  
---
:thinking:
---
death to supers
---
That would kind of ruin it for me, you'd need to do run the structure timers to disable local :/. Unless they also add a structure to inhibit local chat in system, which could be alright, but not as great as just shooting a "Communications Array" dead.
---
Testing the waters? Maybe purging those with the "Eve should b EZ" mentality? Getting Mil Dwellers eased into the idea of not having local to depend on? A little bit of all of the above? If this is CCPs plan, I hope they don't puss out at the end. The game needs to be shaken up.
---
Aspiring Null Ninjas rejoice.
---
Sounds like a good thing to me...
---
Do you know you can use DSCAN but a cloacky or imlmune dscan shiop could bring on you 255 of his friend on you ?
---
Humans are lazy. Humans are greedy. Do not underestimate peoples ability to still die with intel channels.
---
The only people happy for this are the ones who get benefits from it, not the ones who actually live in nullsec. It's great for the people who only do pvp, but terrible for the rest of the playerbase. That's terrible for the game.
---
Memes are automatically removed.  Please submit to /r/evememes instead.
---
no hunting is just a smidge harder , cause now you can just use the star map to find NPC kills, pilots in space . there is a delay but anyone krabbing is going to have to be there long enough for the delay to not matter.
---
There is a skill under Social that affect sec status gains, have it at least to IV.
---
Here is a transcript 
---
Generally on 10 minute timers, at least for our local ones.
---
No local, why even live in null then? Whs can get you 1b/h for the less risk :\
---
Super will not be the primary to fall. Death to all subcap. You force people to use more super. 
---
And if people can't use super and subcap , they will just make a breack or stop eve.  Congrats you win eve by lake of other player.
---
Can you fucking read?
---
I'd say english is not his mothertongue
---
The problem is what? People will actually have to watch gates and defend their space, crazy I know
---
And how many are already resubbing... because you can quit eve but you never quit r/eve
---
People will adapt. Sunk cost fallacy will make a lot of them stay too. What do you think people did before there was a super umbrella over nullsec?
---
I'm fine with that.
---
You already failed with that isk/hour Thing cause its uterly retarded
---
Isk/hour is what you use as goon or renter usually its about fun and that bit of grind in between to keep the bills paid
---
On the ls people those enlisting and activeley fighting in fw Do dream about about an empire they dont have rn otherwise they wouldnt fight over ls sov
---
Yes sir just tell me which system your in I’ll come by just to make sure no1 blobs you
---
How can you interpret, "pulverized ore" as "ore that's been mined and in caps people jettison". 
---
Do you have to "mine" and Jettison Ship Wrecks for the MTU to work? Nope. 
---
It's a shitty description, because it's wrong.
---
*chuckle* I'm in danger
---
Now you're being disingenuous - I've been part of a small group which was able to regularly use capitals in the post-jump fatigue world prior to the capital changes and citadels. That's the whole point of this topic.
---
So no change at all, thx for agreeing.
---
Grab popcorn ,add null sec bear tears...OMNOMNOMNOM

So log them off on the keep if you want them safe

---
That wasn't what he was referring to. He specifically stated resists, which are the same
---
my boner's got a boner.
---
Or people will stop the game. Like when the local was not working. 
---
Yes some will adapt a majority will leave. We have see this in all region with perma camper.
---
Only umbrella place will stay. You kill all little entity in eve.
---
Clearly, I cannot. I'm gonna leave the comment, to show my shame.
---
Will do that man but i feel that i need a month or 2 before doing that investiment. Ive just mined..still didnt do missions exploration etc...got lots to do
---
Exactly. Jump fatigue solved that problem right up until they made the cap changes which gave us rorquals with invul timers and tracking supers.
---
High sec is keeping local afaik you could move there
---
All the bitching in this Post is immeasurable and my day has been made better by atleast 1%. 
---
No, 50 harpies can't kill super-tanked blingy as a motherfucker Lokis while under reps, Bhaalgorns or Hics. I don't think if they pinged for bigger shit, they could get there in-time for anyone bitching that they should've brought different ships.
---
Also, it's delve lmao. Inner Hell is looking for easy Rorq or even Hyper spat super frags. Much like every other somewhat competent group that very often visits delve. Expect to get dropped by 90% of it's population in Titans &amp; Supers.
---
This post is far too logical for redditors to comprehend, but i'll leave it here anyway. B).
---
Goddamnit... made me edit.
---
sure - but that's not good for the game that there will be less people out and about doing stuff in null, or the game entirely.
---
Less scalable is the benefit, not the problem
---
It's ok we won't miss you.
---
I love the the fact ccp is trying things out.
---
I enjoy selling and producing stuff for you all.
---
Have a great and fun weekend everyone.
---
UNBAN ME LOCAL DELETED LET ME IN LET ME IN LET ME IN LET ME IN
---
all recons are going to be super strong tbh
---
1. All the ships you need for your \~elite pvp\~ goes up in price, affecting your bottom line.
---
2. People adjust their risk v. rewards and ship down to uninteresting targets, cheaper fits, affecting your revenue stream from killing duders.
---
3. Established super-cap umbrellas will become more powerful.
---
4. Established intel umbrellas will become more powerful than entities without.
---
5. People not associated with these organizations, and some that are, will see no reasoning behind have multiple accounts. The lack of re-occuring plex for said accounts will result in less targets.
---
6. Further inflation of required minerals / raw materials that further inflate prices. This begins a vicious circle.
---
7. The 5-7 major null blocks will most likely release 3rd party (or updated 3rd party) software that will render local useless thus giving them superior advantage over hostiles roaming in their space.
---
8. No local will result in massive focus on hell-camping key regional entrances and NPC stations to render hostile capital usage and cyno scouts nearly useless. Good luck with roaming gangs.
---
That's all I just came up with off the top of my head for right now.
---
Safe log off... reconect use cyno 255 people in local and immune to dscan. 
---
0.0 are not WH. You have Cyno. If you remove local and don't change cyno rule... You will just kill all little entity. And make a lot of player stop game.
---
You could said what you want, you could said dank kill mail, grrr goons, deatht ot super. At end of the day the result will be a net loss of content when player will leave.
---
stop whining, it is the best move ccp made in a decade
---
noone cares cuckmeister
---
I was playing when 10k players was a huge milestone. The perception I have is the number of players actually active in space has decreased since then. At least it felt like it was a lot easier to find a fun fight in 2007 then in 2019.
---
It's unbelievable that people actually believe removing local will make a difference. That local is *the* problem with the game today, and not the mountain of other issues.
---
Capital proliferation, citadel spamming, groups refusing to undock. Yeah, sure, local caused all those things. Removing it will fix everything, and stop botting once for all.
---
Idiots.
---
I can't wait to see how that will play out. Nullbears already bitch and whine about anoms as it is. I can't wait to see a bunch of them crammed in to a system fighting over who gets what anom
---
I even skilled capitalization.
---
Except it's bullshit.
---
Small entities are managing fine, too.  You're either not reading reddit comments, or just outright ignoring contrary evidence.
---
It's not a question of how BIG your entity is, it's how well you STAFF the structures your entity owns.  
---
The fact of the matter is that there are too many structures in space to be defended adequately against the drifters.  PERIOD.  The reason for this is that there aren't enough human bodies.  PERIOD.
---
Saying the mechanic is broken because you can't properly defend the huge, empty and unused sections of space you claim to "own" is ridiculous.  
---
Live within your means, like the smalls groups who CAN defend their shit from the Drifters are doing.
---
What is ISK Inflation?
---
Do tell? Im new
---
I mean, you are posting? Or was that a subtle inference you are indeed no one?
---
Wait, what happened to daily quests? That sounds like fun.
---
Can confirm after having intentionally stalled an aeroplabe many times, the nose lowers but it does not nose dive until you release the stick. The aircraft will just pancake towards the ground if you dont actively recover it
---
\*Reads\*
---
\*Reads again\*
---
Boy some people have no self awareness.
---
It shows the count on the outside of the Citadel. You know exactly how many are if you get on grid with it.
---
I thought they wanted to stop exporting
---
I hope it's not a long term situation.  
---
People might not consider the current situation in nullsec, people will just stop spreading, and be more people in peak systems, like DPNP or D1QP, within a few ranges, and most of null will be **EVEN MORE** empty.  
---
Hunters will be ready, but defense fleets will be there, fauxs, supers, on standby at all time. Prices will go up. Resource scarcity once again, ok, i'm fine with the idea.  
---
But the major problem: it will be **empty**
---
I missread your comment, I thought you said AFTER jump fatigue was introduced
---
Actually, deflation. If less isk enters the game drastically your isk will have more buying power over time.
---
wewlad so original pls more

---
Arazu still has a declaim timer you have 4 seconds or so to warp off better to a stealth bomber be insta tackle then get out of dodge once backup arrives
---
end products are cool, raw materials are not
---
What I read: will the blackout bring more chads? why yes ccp, how could you tell?
---
Good point.
---
"Hey Pearl Abyiss, remember when we had that chat snafu and user counts nosedived? We are going to do that again, indefinitely."
---
Seems like a good idea.
---
Pretty much. Either way, they don't drop for attackers to collect, which is what everyone wants.
---
Im against removing local for social reasons. The rule is in wh space you NEVER talk in local for intel and security reasons. Its a bad rule for bad people. I dont want to see this shit rule in k space.
---
Can confirm, when I was in a nullsec Corp I died many times despite warnings having been posted in Intel channels
---
Blarg, Lachesis.
---
i was a wormhole dwelling nullsec poacher and my main complaints about the game where hk, lzhk demanding a weekly sacrifice of t3s on their altar of non eviction and nullsec local. im pretty pumped
---
Wow haven't played since tidi was introduced might pick up the game again once this hits.
---
You mean tools like dotlan and even the in game map to show activity? Things hunters/gangs have been using already?
---
How will we ever adapt?..
---
If you're gonna use them at all, take it to 5!  It's like logis, you won't regret the extra performance and fitting space!
---
100% agree. This is why CCP shouldn't be taking game design notes from Reddit.
---
A "regional" local or a simple delay would have been way better for content. Give people the idea that they even have a chance of "outsmarting" the system. You can already see this with the Drifters. Everyone know the Drifters are stomping... and yet we still see people undocking smartbombing machs, lmao.
---
With a total blackout, people will simply disengage and cloister up. 80% of nullsec will look like Curse on a Tuesday US night... empty but for the odd dramiel or travelceptor.
---
The arazu still has a decloak timer better to have initial tackle from a stealth bomber then have it get out of dodge once backup arrives
---
Or if your blopsing decloak scram open cyno
---
If there's a cyno inhibitor module, the umbrella is completely defanged. What use is a 1000 supers when you get tackled if they can't cyno to you? They will only matter in nullsec wars, not protecting ratters, which is a good place if you ask me.
---
People in null had a ton of fun back when there wasn't a super umbrella. Arguably, it was the best time for all subcaps too. The super umbrella is not needed for nullsec to function.
---
High sec is that way: -----&gt; (o)
---
Well not quite, with keepstars and sotiyos it seems as though people have amassed a collection beyond what their coffin characters can handle so some might be left in the KS.
---
I have the heron fit but not the probe one. Link please?
---
Have not yet come up with a 20th way to fit the Maulus. I want to do a series on different Maulus fits, just need to get my self organized and do the work.
---
Nice, about time.
---
How is it the "benefit" when on the other hand Drifters are forcing more density at the exact same time? Any system that can only support 1-2 people at a time or even less that is not going to be able to defend against drifters.
---
I am very glad you found it helpful!
---
Do you want resource scarcity or player scarcity?  Choose one.
---
Wonder if this means Concord want reinforcements.
---
Ok, let's take a 500 chars alliance that just moved to null. Blue to all big guys around. Statistically, that\`s around 100 real ppl around all TZ ... so around 20 ppl online. They have/been given a constellation ... 10 systems.
---
Do you really think that those 20 ppl will sacrifice 1-2 omega accounts (simultaneously log in) that will watch the gates and scan for wormholes?
---
And if they do, will they dock at every enemy they see ... cuz danger of cyno and no umbrella?
---
They will have to literally join a big block. There will be no more little guys.
---
Don't worry... Only the players brave enough to undock need to press V. The others can huddle-up together in their safe space.
---
A strange game.   The only winning move is not to play.
---
This. If they cyno in for every fucking tackled krab, they will burn out in a week. We will be a SCOURGE.
---
If you do that people will just leave game.
---
Beacause people who attack will have golden ammo : Push 2 button: one stop defender reinforce, other bring you 255 freidn to hit someone alone.  You have no counter. RISK become over powered against reward for farmer they will stop.
---
And for pvp player ? No more risk for big reward.
---
So are you saying you don't think small groups were running around having small cap brawls? Because I sure was, as were many other groups.
---
Dude, me being in Horde doesn't mean that I don't leave Geminate. I do exploration constantly, and by 'exploraton' I mean 'hopping through WHs into Stain, grabbing everything and going back'. So, if you think I'm a risk-averse shitbag, then you're wrong.
---
So you need to be brave to want to hit V 1200 times an hour? I'm not sure that word brave means what you think it means.
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/559865971658194964/590891975285407744/unknown.png dunno, apparently people think only null has rorqual and t2 ops...
---
Don't have it on hand but it was an MSB with at least one recharger and resist rigs.
---
More whales for Pearl Abyss. Good plan.
---
As Goons showed, krabs are an important part of the alliance.
---
&gt; Because they have smaller representation, so you don't hear those people a lot.
---
But you can read their comments about successfully defending their structures from Drifters.... **provided your willing to look**.
---
Hmm, I better asset safety that Exookiz corpse I have stashed out in null sooner rather than later...
---
Neither it is good for the game when you do mindless bullshit that only leads to further economic troubles.
---
Everyone  resubbing now to hunt and all the ratters and miners just unsubbing.
---
Yup
---
It was a poor mechanic, and should never have been implemented... But was needed to force migration from POS's and outposts
---
I highly doubt that there will be many targets in space without local.
---
Yup will go from my 4 mining accounts to 1 subcap account that only logs in when a fleet is pinged.  Will simply not be worth my time
---
Local confirmed....
---
I fail to see how undetectable instablapping npcs randomly spawning 24/7 with no offensive counterplay is similar to a random player taking on a large well-organized group and failing to have any real effect.
---
Fortunately, skill injectors exist. Back in the day, folks used parking alts all the time to hold excess supers. How convenient that they're easier than ever to make!
---
Hugest, ginormous change CCP ever made! finally something useful and truly ground breaking! BB, bot wankers!  
---
can't wait!
---
Doesn't matter if you want to conquer them tho. Sure we slamdunked some rorqs, but we could never have captured Delve
---
&gt;  i hope you all have an amazing summer, and if you have any game recommendations on pc/ps4 then let me know. i need to kill some time!
---
the steam sale is on, right now. think it ends on the 9th.
---
i just picked up the witcher 3 with all the DLCs for £10. a lot of people really like that game.
---
I'm not saying there wont have to be changes to other elements but removing local is a good first step. Nullsec needs to be dangerous with good rewards. Right now it's the safest place in the game with the best of everything (few exceptions) If people want to krab and rat, go for it, I do it myself but that's just one half of the game, PVP is in a stale spot. Just have to wait and see what happens
---
Agreed. Tie it with gate cloak
---
And people doubted drifters would nerf botting. There you go, lads. Free reign on botting.
---
I would agree that this is highly likely
---
Did someone say wormholes?
---
The bit about "bandwidth" makes me think they might go for the delayed-local approach rather than a proper blackout.
---
Hopefully they try out both and stick with one!  Or maybe if it involves structures like people are speculating, the structure could give *delayed* local over the default of none.
---
delaying or removing local would be one work around to dealing with botting perhaps. If the bot is watching local channels for new neutral entities delaying that will break the function for it immediately safe up.
---
CCP YES OMFG YEEESSS
---
You go to the asset window and right click the citadel you have the assets in.
---
https://i.vgy.me/MfQYbb.png
---
Resubbing all accounts. 
---
Lets go hunting boys
---
It's clear that null is too rich, and too early able to support large groups. By lowering the scalability of money making, it will rein in null super-groups. More smaller groups leads to better conflict
---
This could be amazing for player retention... only the coalitions can decide.
---
If they berate their pilots for undocking without 'approved' FCs, or refuse to train, encourage, or support new ones, then yeah, it could be a disaster (for them).
---
i'm guessing the amount of returning player will still be dwarfed by the amount they are going to lose.
---
With the way ns is your gunna have to piss someone off to fix it.
---
Asset safety is dumb. Keepstars were mistake.. If I had a chance to save my shit from this random explosion it would be fine. I jist wouldnt accept an insta pop of my station without at least one timer.
---
The issue with ns is blocs just get bigger and stronger. There is no small gang anymore. Jist drop titans amd wait for it to die.
---
I could see a good portion of them being pissed they leave ns for sure. Unless they lost everything tho I doubt many would straight up leave entirely. I know I said I would but it would take a very spefic scenario to get me to.
---
If you're not sitting on the button he's going to land off you and you're fine.
---
If they don't support a pos gunner then I don't know what the fuck you pay your pos gunners but I want in
---
.botcheck
---
Thx grammer nazi.
---
 Well, they needed a reason to create such a tool didn't they?
---
Yeah do the missions in the meantime. They will give you skillbooks and ext that you can use/sell.
---
happening status: it's.
---
It was not a poor mechanic and should stay.
---
&gt; large groups will still have less structures per member because there's a minimum number of structures to cover your bases, something that is felt more when you operate lower numbers.
---
Again, as said elsewhere - it has FUCKALL to do with "Member count" vs "Structure count".
---
It's about "ACL'd &amp; SP'd members who can gun" vs "Structure count".
---
Having 20,000 members and 2,000 structures in space is great.... but how about when you only have 10% of your members ACL'd to gun?  I imagine it's far, far less that number of "trusted" gunners in the large alliances.
---
Which is the problem they have, and small corps do not.
---
Can you read? Even at the system level, 1-2 people/system density can not fight off drifters unless you park a super in system, which means that system can't have structures.
---
actually means scouts have to be paying attention to d-scan. Not just waiting for advanced notice by local.
---
Sure that works.
---
Removing local is not the solution.  And you want to know what ? Removing loval will be for very short time CCP prepare suprise announce of observatory who will cost fuel to player for local ... and they could remove cloack. 
---
No the true problem of this change is the time withtout local eve will be a dead game. Farmer will stop to play, you will have near 0 target.
---
Defender cyno is counter to attacker cyno. Remove cloacky cyno, remove local, remove cyno...It's call WH. Yes WH are actually safer than 0.0.
---
0.0 are not safe, they are "safe"" beacause of effort of player to defend each other.
---
I actually enjoy mining dude.  As do many others.  I also enjoy building shit that requires omega status to click the green button.  So I have 4 mining/Indy chars.  Hold fuck I must be deranged right?  Well when dreads cost 5b cause trit is 20isk I’m sure people will say, “ huh maybe we overcorrected there” 
---
My faith in ccp to get this right is really pretty much nonexistent and seeing how long it’s taken them to get chat fixed I’m not exactly confident in their problem solving process either.  The brisc shit shows how bad their communication from their community people are.  
---
My short eve career could be already nearing its end
---
that's the point i'm trying to make, less people is bad for the game
---
Botters u mean?nobody gonna miss em
---
WH mechanics maybe
---
Just ns and maybe low power stuff in hs./ls. But straight up exploding everyone shit is a sure fire way to infuriate the player base. I would like to see them defend there shit a lot like these drifter things but the ai isnt good enough to kill citidels without a ccp guy intervening.
---
They are actually doing it ? lol
---
Big if true.  
---
Will be pretty easy to use blue cynos for awoxing anything if it works as hoped/feared.
---
if i want to actually log in - i'll still be doing it, just not in null because as some one who doesn't own a supercap why would i?
---
*They* are capable of adapting to, don't forget that.
---
Instead of dropping the entire super blob on you, drop a few insta-lock tackle. If they catch any of you, drop carriers/supers to nuke you. If not, burn back to titan and wait until your next target.
---
jokes on them, nobody on here ever logs in
---
Yaaaaaýyyyyy
---
EVE has large swathes of NPC space that cannot be conquered by players, full of NPC stations where you can do all the crafting you need without player interference.
---
In a way, the NPC stations serve as a top tax limit; players cannot introduce crafting tax higher than the one in NPC stations, because if they do then everyone will simply move their crafting to NPC stations.
---
There are also few other things like System Index, which dynamically alters the tax based on the amount of crafting done in the system, which means you can craft in unpopular locations for lower prices.
---
you can try eve online and join amarr fw and pew at the minmatar ~~cowards~~ frens
---
Use OBS
---
I had to make sure it wasn't amakbomba first.
---
Well, we all know "space" is the superior key tbh
---
botters were the only ones who did log in...
---
players see local is broken and do the sensible thing and don't undock. bots don't know what a broken local is and are the only ones out in space.
---
Looks like I made the right decision in converting to sodium-cooled reactors 🤔
---
Or when they have no local to support their hunting and waste hours and hours d scanning empty systems.
---
If you think that's bad, in the lead up to WWB Lenny accidentally invited The Mittani to the coordination Skype channel.
---
It's a really great game you have made a solid choice.
---
Our frens in u'k and snw (◕‿◕✿) have been all of a sudden super generous in their content making and content sharing. thanks frens!
---
I hope you know force recons, bombers, and Cloaky T3's can warp cloaked and move cloaked.
---
That requires PLEX as fuel.
---
They mostly want people to not be able to logoff trap their bots anymore
---
anchoring in the other 3/4's of system types than Null is an "elaborate justification"?
---
I have a simple rule.... if you're going to reply to my comments while high or drunk, you have to get me drunk or high before I reply.
---
tl;dr - you're an idiot.
---
haha finally ccp will kill dirty snuff empire builders, say goodbye to your lowsec keepstar network, that just happens to have a perfect route to 1dq
---
Maybe that too. But the main reason for 10sec delay is to kill botters. Eve players would have the ability to police those botters on their own as 10sec is enough to log in a dictor and throw a bubble. Players wouldnt fall for this trick as easily/consistently.
---
This would just be a buff to bots since we can't logoff trap them.
---
Did Goons ping yet that they are moving to High Sec?
---
krabs mad
---
Bots, Rmt, super farmers ... will die !?!?
---
I generally agree with much of what you wrote including the idea to change the structure timer mechanic so defender chooses the time and attacker chooses the date.
---
However I also strongly disagree with your suggestion to make moon mining passive again. Other than PI CCP did well in removing passive forms of resource gathering. This is a game that should reward activity not passive rental empires. There is also lots of content generated over camping, harassing, or ninja mining the moons of landlords who aren't active enough to defend their high value moons and either need to defend the field with their miners or deny it to their enemy by letting it expire.
---
Its a great source of conflict and it really does allow smaller entities to harass larger ones. Obviously this is difficult if you are trying to do it under a hostile super umbrella but for those of us in lowsec and npc 0.0 its provides much more content than passive mining ever did.
---
More daddy, I'm almost there.
---
If they moved to null with the *main*(but not exclusive) goal of padding wallets by shooting little red crosses, then they will go join a big bloc. 
---
I suspect you're assuming everyone does that. There's nothing wrong with doing that (ratting, etc), but you might be projecting your own play-style onto other people.
---
ccp does nothing: you complain
---
ccp does something: you complain
---
Pvp players hunt rats because there's no other fleet in null, not because they enjoy it all that much. If nullsec formed regular small-medium fleets, it would be awesome for me. I don't really care to hunt ratters other than "they are there".
---
Nullsec will just form up more fleets to defend the ratters or even have interceptors quickly move in and create a cyno in the system, just not on grid. There are ways to circumvent it and if you think people will abandon the game just because they don't have an instant win button, I think we're not playing the same game.
---
Isn't there enough minerals stockpiled at Jita to last months?
---
Never said that. My argument is that forced pve is not fun.
---
This fight happened on a well fit anti-cap fortizar.
---
no those are Triglavians
---
nah fuck that make null scary again

---
EVE is dying because you fucking nerds never go outside. Now shower me with your salty downvotes (mind the eyes please).
---
Keep telling yourself that, my friend.
---
I've been mostly solo for the last 16 years of EVE, and have never been a Null Block member.  Nor do I ever want to be.
---
1. Good. This is the end goal of resource scarcity.
---
2. Partially true. People will still fly dumb shit regardless.
---
3. People will still rat with bling outside the umbrella. Re: Delve the previous 6 weeks
---
4. There are already highly established umbrellas that are unbeatable now. A shake up of the existing infrastructure is at least breathing room for hunters.
---
5. The people who ratted in complete safety with botting/intel software weren't targets in the first place.
---
6. Good.
---
7. We already have this. It'll take time to re-do software which is hunting/breathing room.
---
8. We've had this before in Eve. Moo anyone.
---
At least this move will shake things up.
---
Nice way to clean out those clutter Personal Asset windows.
---
Time to consolidate. :popcorn:
---
I see what you are saying, meaning if you relog a sabre in system it gives you time to land and bubble before showing up?
---
I really hope they dont remove it.  It is a super nice feature making living in null more practical.
---
nice goon alt mate.
---
Depends on the gas and the site. 
---
There are a lot of nuances there, but if you can find a couple of buds to clear up the site, or have a battlecruiser with a decent fit, totally. Venture with gas harvesters pays for itself in about 5 minutes.
---
Is this how CCP introduces the info network structures?
---
CCP checking if blackout is a good thing is a good thing.
---
Considering there is more miners/ratters than pvpers where are all the targets going to be when all the miners and ratters unsub they are not going to continue to play the game or they just wont undock then pvpers will be running around in empty space.
---
Olmeca have done nothing yet. you know that right ?

"Secretly login into a drifter account for two weeks of invasion."
---
Have a great holiday (◕‿◕✿)
---
i'll be honest, i'm struggling with it.
---
i don't have the patience for the combat system so i'm just spamming that fast attack and just getting constantly countered and mauled.
---
Sorry guys but what's your problem with intel channels?
---
It's player interaction, it's a community working together to better defend against threats.
---
It's something CCP should be pleased and should encourage.
---
Same regarding big nullblocks, safety in null came from users affort to coordinate themself and play together, and it's a HUGE effort compared to those who play alone or in small groups in hi-sec or low-sec.
---
Nothing came for free, nullblocks are a huge investment by a lot of people, communities working together, and that's what made Eve great and famous also between people who don't play any game.
---
Do you think that Eve is famous for hi-sec mission runners or fw guys?
---
Honestly, if this invasion pans out how many are hoping, I'm bringing like 7+ friends to Eve and resubbing several accounts. We have all been talking about it, just waiting on the results of the invasion.
---
This "event" will be over before IV finishes probably
---
It should go and the wealth should be redistributed to the people who bashed and/or kept in NPC stations
---
That's like a whole new meta level of lore. Hats off.
---
Factually inaccurate, but still a good shitpost.
---
Best change ever, possible re-sub on the way
---
so it is just a coincidence that within 2 weeks of a revolutionary csm being elected ccp has done all these huge changed?

OK MATE I BELIEVE YOU

I'll gladly trade a few semi-AFK Myrm and Domi kills for actual fights over gates for pipe control. (And non-AFK Myrms and Domis aren't nearly as squishy as PVE VNIs are.) It's not going to be impossible or even difficult to protect your space, it will just require a slightly different strategy and a slightly different expectation for "optimal" returns. I do not expect much of an impact, really.  
---
More realistically, there will probably be some bug that still makes people show up in logs and so intel bots will be just fine for nine months until it's fixed.
---
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
---
And you will just have to shut down the new cyno same way and trap more super. Smelt like a nice stupid improve.
---
YOu need golden ammo to win ? how bad are you .
---
or just lose their hunting ship to instalocking drifter fleets on gate

Context : TEST Goku fleet forms, after 20m of jumping through WH's we dunk a Hel followed by some 15 Rorq's jumping back and forth throughout them PANIC-ing
---
Flipped my shit? K.
---
Pathetic. Soon as a little risk is involved, you want to run for the hills. Go hide in highsec
---
Don't worry about this in EVE, Drifters will take down the cartels (read: nullsec blocs) for you instead.   
---
vOv
---
&gt; In less than 2 weeks, olmeca 'please dont worship me' gold has flipped eve on its head, rumors from iceland is that he has hilmar at gunpoint demanding changed while locking down the building with his 50 multiboxed toons.
---
you fucking spoon
---
you mean ccp or the players?
---
Yes it is. 
---
CCP make a smoke screen to hide the new SP policy. 
---
Ho and they will announce obsevatory soon.
---
this entire thread is the truth, i resent the accusation.
---
It is. After all, nullsec confers the greatest bonuses for structures -- the best materials reductions, the ability to build supercaps, and proximity to the best forms of PVE to feed said structures. You can indeed drop structures elsewhere, but one does so at a strict disadvantage to a sov haver.
---
Sounds better than "Carrier &amp; Rorqs Online"
---
It seems like a trial to me since it’s pitched along side a Drifter invasion. I’m already using V like a motherfucker. The camper in my system isn’t bugging me now tho lol
---
and i guarantee you they're mostly jumping with joy over it
---
And because of this, I hope there are sustained.  
---
2019:  MNGA!  Make Null Great Again!
---
lol, that's exactly wormhole gameplay, without the scanning part. Super exciting, drop some balls :)
---
Ahhhh the obvious minimal to no risk line mostly coming from those who never been there
---
Sure we did a lot to secure our Space but we are definetley Not safe there is still a lot that can Happen but youd only know if you ever tried it
---
i think that tinfoil hat might be cutting blood flow to your brain friendo, have any evidence?
---
Imagine leaving Jita 4-4 with your first Orca. You get locked down and exploded upon undock. You then get podded with the new implants you just bought too. 
---
It brings me joy that no Goons can see that their actions across the galaxy through the past decade have people *reveling* in the fact that you guys are crying about having to do things. THE HORROR! You actually have to deal with unfair odds that you've thrown at people for over a decade. 
---
Harden the fuck up.
---
cool. now we won't have any tool to save our owns. So we will just leave the game and let you pew pew in t1 frigates cuz you punks cant build shit.
---
You make it sound as if you can't chat with anyone. You can chat all you like, you just wont know who's watching
---
why would i put any more effort in to ratting for less than 20m/tick than deploying drones?
---
at that point, the amount of effort required makes literally every other activity a better isk:effort proposition.
---
Yes. The fact seaguls in past want to send it in same time as first drifter event , and was delay beacause they prefer to make other bulding first ?
---
Thanks Elise Randolph!
---

&gt;i resent the accusation

So it's not a good shitpost? I retract my statement. lol.
---
WTB cynojammers, all titan pilots, and a 100k computer capable of running 255 clients at once.
---
Bingo.
---
Bashing POS's gave you the contents if the owner was unprepared. Taking outposts could deny your opponents materiel and resources by locking it down.
---
Bash a citadel (which takes significantly more effort), and you get nothing, while your foe is mildly inconvenienced.
---
Nope, but we thank you for your support.
---
Have a nice day
---
It's just lore, but I didn't realize the Triglavians were raiding planets. Nifty.
---
I don't personally really care about local, I was just being fake salty. I live in Jita and haven't rat or mine in like 8 years. But I was in a small alliance and in a big one ... the life is simply easier in a big bloc. Slowly, ppl will just join a big block as small alliances will not be able to protect their members.
---
meh, it will only matter if they are willing to deal with the absolute shitstom that the nullsec blocks will put up. 
---
Also if they are willing to deal with the unsubbing that it will happen, either due to people protesting it or unsubbing because they don't want to play in a nullsec without local situation.
---
It looks like we (the players) bamboozle ourselves from the very beginning, making it seem like the drifter attacks were here to solve the problems that the players in some cases couldn't or wouldn't. But it seems pretty clear now that their real goal was to give ccp the excuse to test the waters with local, giving them the lore excuse to shut it off for a small period of time to see what it does to the game and to the players, which is cool, but i hope they were not oblivious to what the reaction from the nullsec blocks is going to be about this, it will be overwhelmingly negative for bigger and more organized groups, while the smaller ones will be fairly positive. If they expected that reaction and are prepared to deal with this, we may see this short event turn into the feature of nullsec with no local (or maybe some kind of delayed local like some people suggested or region wide local). However if they were not expecting and are not prepared to deal with it, it will only last a week at most, as mentioned in the video.
---
well you and your coalition can just go HS or LS where intel works...
---
God, that's so fucking annoying.
---
Even more annoying with my laughable K/D right now.  What the fuck are they running from?
---
oh no!
---
less minerals in the game!
---
caps are more expensive and less common!
---
oh the inhumanity!
---
Imagine dangerous space actually having some element of risk, crazy. You only want to play when you can have 10 intel channels open and see who's in system, when things are easy. You'll still be able to mine and build things, I plan to, just have to be more cautious and on the ball.
---
There's some weirdly intense eye contact going on here between goons and Horde.
---
&gt; prepare counterdrops this already happens but many ratting subcaps don't have the spare high or don't have the tank to survive until help arrives. Supers and Rorquals do however
---
if you are concerned with having a "spare high" or you take so long to get help thru the instant teleportation cyno you can't survive, you ain't preparring a counterdrop, you're just calling the standing fleet while ratting.
---
As someone who lives in null I'm very much ok with this. I love the events and things that shake the place up. So long as I can do something about it. I like fighting back. I like earning the right to access how awesome our space is. Just getting shit on all day with no way to retaliate ain't fun for no one.
---
Imagine nullsec being unsafe.
---
but nobody is gonna be hunting botters when they have drifter issues at home
---
EVE Online. Dying since 2003.

Little more accurate. DHSJ weren't in on the main fight at all. They ganked one of the smile 'n' wave abaddon after the main event.
---
Which wars?
---
Doesn't help against logging off in a safe and coming back later.
---
I knew this would be on reddit.   We fed you hard but were happy to get some content.  We found a goon gate camp that we took our pain out on soon after this.
---
If you read the other items on the bottom line of the Scope and other lore news, asset safety is getting some changes/nerfs after the null blackout.
---
No it shouldnt.
---
everyone's docked because drifters m8
---
Based on how the tracker works now I'd guess everyone gets them on their first "x" after they're added, just like we all got the "navigation 1" or whatever popup spam when the system was added even if we'd been playing for years.
---
&gt;Goons scared of NPC's in 2019
---
So you think it's reasonable to have 5+ people babysit you while you rat?
---
Note: if local goes down in null as is expected, this won't work.
---
\-checks didn't extract recon 5-
---
Move to highsec, krab.
---
You can say what you like, but I would like to see the source of the Drifter invasion and a way to fight it.
---
As nice as a clean slate sounds nice, an unstoppable and unending invasion is not fun to fight against. Neither it's fun to see your efforts --- call it sandcastles if you like --- that culminated from years of playing falls apart without you being able to do anything to stop it. It's one thing losing against the invasion. It's another thing if it is impossible to win against it to begin with.
---
One thing is certain however. Even if the devs do wipe the game clean, what some people hoped for --- the disintegration of large blocs --- is probably not going to happen. Panfam is Panfam because of the people. Same for Goons. The only difference is that we have to build everything from ground up again.
---
Painfully on point.
---
Look at the second word of your username
---
***YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS***
---
Inject this post into my veins
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again.  I'm from a group that heavily Blops drops, so this change would be a buff for my lifestyle.  But.....
---
Losing local just means everyone eventually loses.
---
With Cynos it'll make nullsec far more dangerous than W-Space, and the population of PVErs will drastically decrease when the risk vs reward is overly skewed towards risk.  Leading to less targets.
---
Why not just use Combat Recons? They are invisible to D-scan so you'll never even be visible to people who aren't actively watching you enter a system until you're on their grid.
---
i am trying my best to understand where you got that from my comment, but alas i'm failing pretty hard.
---
ps:that doesn't mean i do or do not think it is.
---
Perhaps this will shake up sov quite a bit. Not going to lie...lack of local scares me but this is prolly good for the game for small blocks to move in to null
---
 (✿◠‿◠) convenient timing on the vacation (✿◠‿◠)
---
Big difference was back then we didn't run and hide from everything. We would see stuff in Intel and go "ok bros let's go fight them" now it's "they only have a few cruisers and frigs. Bring ur titans. I'll race to see who can boson the most"
---
&gt; nobody with a braincell is going to undock with no local
---
  Tell that to the kids losing rorqs to drifters
---
Don't fight them?
---
In Eve large alliances and corps can control power, influence, territory, crafting, and  markets.
---
But there are vast areas of the game (regionally and mechanically) where these players have no control over the game.
---
That's where you play.
---
And if you want to interact with the players in power then you have to get very good at the game.
---
You might as well ask: "In Warcraft how can I beat the best players in PvP as a Level 1 player?"
---
And the answer is: You can't. You do something else in the game.
---
...what? Just...what? I have no idea where you're getting the idea only one player can occupy a system now
---
but if you dont like local, you could also move to wh-space???
---
People already pointed you towards compressing.
---
Regaeding the gas huffing, if you take the right gas it's ok for an activity which you can do semi afk (watching netflix on the site or something like that) and the low skill requirements. Check [https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/gas.php](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/gas.php) to find out which gas is currently the best. [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gas\_cloud\_harvesting](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gas_cloud_harvesting) tells you in which regions you'll find it.
---
Generally I would advise a new player more towards more activ things like exploration instead of semi afk stuff as huffing or mining.
---
so happy rebel galaxy outlaws will come out soon  (◕‿◕✿)
---
Appropriate name
---
A bitter-sweet situation, but yes indeed.
---
&gt; drifters 1 shot pve ships, and nobody's pvping because all the structures are getting hit
---
  Implying PvP is just shooting structures- Proves you're a dirty krab jerking it to your ISK wallet
---
I'm really excited about this.   Good on CCP for just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks.
---
wrong, there will still be local in low/high sec
---
1 player/system is around the density that you can support from just combat/explo sites.
---
Douche her
---
Why would they? Wormholes have never been a problem or focus.
---
[Yeah](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3ohzdSiIelW7I5Dl1m/giphy.gif)
---
Sure, I like to theorycraft :)   
---
first of all a 600m meg is blingy - that's very good for getting fights, but it's not a t2 fit meg (which runs to max 300, no implants just tank drugs)   
---
Secondly a decent buffer tanked, blaster prot with two mag field stabs will hit for about 750 with void, cold, which would bring two of them to \~1500 dps.   
---
something like   
---
`[Proteus, Proteus]`
---
`Damage Control II`
---
`Federation Navy Magnetic Field Stabilizer`
---
`Centii A-Type Adaptive Nano Plating`
---
`Federation Navy 1600mm Steel Plates`
---
`50MN Microwarpdrive II`
---
`Federation Navy Stasis Webifier`
---
`Warp Scrambler II`
---
`Covert Ops Cloaking Device II`
---
`Heavy Neutron Blaster II, Void M`
---
`Sisters Expanded Probe Launcher`
---
`Medium Trimark Armor Pump II`
---
`Medium Anti-Explosive Pump II`
---
`Proteus Core - Augmented Fusion Reactor`
---
`Proteus Defensive - Covert Reconfiguration`
---
`Proteus Offensive - Hybrid Encoding Platform`
---
`Proteus Propulsion - Hyperspatial Optimization`
---
`Warrior II x5`
---
I mean i know it's just numbers but also the tanking is not always "perfect" etc.   
---
I've run it a bit in pyfa and yes, I guess you are right - I haven't taken into account asklepians, but with them in, even a t2 fit 230m mega can tank 2x 750 dps.   
---
I stand schooled, thanks :)
---
Isn't carrier&amp;rorqs online a effect of cloak mechanics? Or is me being new mistaking which came first?
---
Heh, im not in null but have been previously.  But also just no, you go instead :) .
---
Because VNI alts and rorq fleets were a beacon of content
---
Why would this encourage small blocks to move to null?  It will be safer to be in a big bloc which has dozens or more recons out gathering intel than to be in a small bloc without such a possibility.
---
It isn't entirely unintentional that we have picked an impossible task. Never run out of something to do!
---
The new name is alrdy been made: Force recons Online.
---
No
---
You sport that 5cm bro!
---
It's been a long time since the Drifters woke up. They took the scenic route along the George RR Martin "They're coming and it's going to be huge, you won't believe it!" Freeway.
---
sorry i explained cartells in the op, i meant a different form of cartells :D
---
Sounds like a filter for the Drifter's real targets lol.
---
&gt; Even at the system level, 1-2 people/system density can not fight off drifters unless you park a super in system, which means that system can't have structures.
---
The multitude of comments I've read in threads (and my own 2 Null cits that I've defended) are telling me that you are completely full of shit and talking out of your ass.
---
A well fitted cit can take care of a Drifter fleet in a couple of minutes, now.
---
But keep those crocodile tears flowing, if it makes you feel better.  I'm thirsty.
---
Drivel
---
good luck with healing up!
---
No, it's an effect of being able to farm mining anomalies and combat sites 24/7 with almost zero risk. Rorqs are the worst offenders due to how little input they require and how easy they scale.
---
I haven't played EVE in a hot minute. Are they making all space wormhole space in terms of local?
---
My playstyle is ganking injector traders in Jita-Perimeter. I don't really care about local, as I log on mains only for fleets.
---
From your comment, I take that you are an established player, that can afford to lose 200mils/day without having to rat. But average Joe isn't capable of that ... he will have to mine/rat to sustain pvp. So, why will he join a small alliance that can not protect his PVE activities, he will go to the big boys.
---
So....that part of the game doesn't change?
---
So how does your counterdrop get to you quicker than a standing fleet? They sit on a titan just waiting.
---
More like one guy is setting up a market manip and posting on Reddit about it.
---
Prepare yourself.
---
by pvping i mean having actual meaningful wars.
---
ganking some irrelevant ratters isn't pvp. it's ganking irrelevant ratters.
---
Yea but it definitely should. This measure is long overdue - people have had enough time to move their shit around, now it's time to play for keeps.   
---
Thanks for all the future loot and/or enjoy lowsec if you think it's too big of an issue :)
---
i have no idea how they're managing that, in all honesty.
---
/u/xtra_squishy can you please provide a link to the dabbing drifter man, Thank you.
---
Cute. :3
---
Let the hoarding commence
---
Well I wanted to leave null, because crabbing is worthless with this ton of shitty gangers, now they will be invisible. Bye null.
---
Dino advertising.
---
Some people live without local for years... you better buy cov ops frigates to make your capital Alt a gate scoot
---
lol you picked a really bad time to try and manip t2 ships
---
You don't understand how long I farmed to buy that 500m raitaru to store 10b of loot in &gt;:(
---
Wow all sorts of weirdos have come out of the woodwork since the drifters.  You are worse than goons
---
No it definitely shouldn't just out of a wanting to live in nullsec perspective.
---
less targets but more catchable
---
Because guerrilla warfare may come back and you can out play your opponent? Independence maybe?
---
Holy shit someone called it yesterday. I can’t believe they’re *actually* doing to do the thing. 
---
Holy wow

i'm feeling pretty good to be honest. little bit sore around the puncture hole but other than that i'm all good unless i try and move around to quickly. just have to keep reminding myself even if i feel good then i need to not do something dumb to stop myself feeling good.

Time for botters to just put eyes on every gate to track neut movements *shrug*
---
&gt; they'll go back to krabbing as normally
---
  Unless they can respond fast enough before the target dies
---
That's a little bit like planting a lawn for the sole purpose of watching it grow. "It's something to do!" 
---
I am reasonably sure I'd lobotomize myself with a trowel in the first day.
---
muahahahaha plz link the killmail
---
I believe you are missing the point.  It's not you that people are against, it's your playstyle.  If your playstyle equivlance is nullsec anoms and highsec pve then that's a problem that will actually kill the game.
---
No... because you don't know what a good fight is.
---
Maybe
---
My caps have been 100% safe in keepstars for 2 years straight... How is that good for the game?
---
Can you leave reddit too? Dont let the door hit you on your way out btw.
---
Dont think you read what I said, I dont think the info for activity beyond general data should be available to anyone without putting in the work to find it. That means eliminating the endpoints that dotlan uses to get this data.
---
Those local bugs was the drifters all along. CCP are playing 32d chess giving out free sp to boost extractor sales from sp farms alexjones.png
---
Yes, and then they're so easily caught they decide it's not worth it and stop.  Leading to even less, but still easily catchable ratters.  And so on and so on.
---
ill resub when this is legit in game.
---
yeah but that would imply both players are fighting each other - they are not, lets be real. it's 1 guy shooting another that has literally 0 interest in that encounter.
---
"It is".  Because you say it is?  Lol.  fuckouttahere with that bullshit.
---
You aren't wrong.  Null has all the best shit, and structures in non-null are generally not as effective as Null.
---
Too bad that's not what you originally said, and I'm still waiting for you to tell me what was "eleborate" and what I was "justifying". 
---
Although... if you don't give a shit about supercaps, or PvE (fucking carebear), having a cit in Null isn't very useful for anything other than staging.  I know, I have 2 in Null for that purpose right now for my solo corp.
---
Your comment is still dumb, and getting dumber every time you reply.
---
It was all planned at the BBQ.
---
&gt; with the unsubbing that it will happen,
---
  Doesn't matter. Not only is eve free to play for subcaps anyway- CCP makes plenty on cosmetic skins and PLEX purchases.
---
Enjoy blopsing VNIs, I guess.
---
**I cannot wait to hear from the roaming fleets that they cannot find any content.** It will be glorious.
---
There already is close to no targets in space with the drifters so this will make null pretty much empty except for large fleets
---
"Mittani gets mad"
---
I go outside :(
---
if you want a place with local move to high sec
---
Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit.
---
Never thought I'd see the day.
---
playstyle?
---
ships ain't free, you have to buy them - which involves earning isk. grinding currency is just something you have to do, it's part of pretty much every game out there.
---
Bring it on mate
---
Hmm, if they announce that game is to be reset soon probably most of the empires in eve will whelp their super cap fleets. That would be a sight to watch and great marketing.
---
[https://tenor.com/Htwj.gif](https://tenor.com/Htwj.gif)
---
Maybe the limit stops local from working if there is more than a certain amount of people there? say, more than 30 in a system and it gets delayed, and the delay is larger depending on more people.
---
From what I've seen a lot of these new 500 man alliances only serve to farm anomalies in recently made vni alts and dock up at the first sight of a non-blue in local (not to mention many of these alts may or may not be bots). I will not be sad to see these types of alliances go.
---
The good stuff (Amber and Vermillion Cytocerosin) is very very good for a newbie. The bad stuff is like mining basic hs ore iirc
---
Not gonna lie, this week's meta show will be pretty spicey
---
no, because people like you keep me here. i love how much you hate my posting.
---
iNsAnE tRaDe SpIkE in Jita!!
---
With the citadel introduction they were also talking about "Observatory Structures".
---
I think there will be a new way of recieving intel.
---
I hope it will be imperfect and make small gangs more hidden while large fleets are easily detectable.
---
At least they'll fight through game mechanics, unlike Goons and Mittens who bitch on social media
---
Trust me dude. Alliances like frat, test, fraternity make trillions off their ratters miners and renters. Paying someone 30m isk per drifter fleet they kill is nothing
---
my theory about the local change is that ccp have absolutely fuck all new ideas and are recycling old ideas just to be seen to be doing something despite already knowing the outcome having done it before.
---
Deleting local might result in a lot of ships not being used anymore. Nobody wants their expensive ISK making tools popped. Let's take mining for example. Have you ever seen Hulks, Covetors, Mackinaws and Retrievers in belts, sometimes with a Porpoise or Orca nearby? Such small fleets, often consisting of alts, aren't an uncommon sight. I fear that this change might kill them. Should local be really deleted for good, the only viable nullsec mining ships will be the Procurer and Rorqual. Only they can survive for long enough for help to arrive. I predict that the rest will never be seen again. Skiff included, as it's simply too expensive.
---
I predict that people will only undock in ships which can take a beating. Caps and supercaps will rule the anonms and belts, while subcaps rot in stations, because nobody wants to die within seconds to some lone hunter guy.
---
Near2 needs to be made unusable or at least made against the eula
---
I usuallyndon't even pay attention to those texts but go straight to attributes. I think most other players do the same. It's more a lore related text. Besides that see what pickle already answered.
---
~Content~
---
That's more of a choice on you than on game mechanics.  And I having the ability to dock versus just having a coffin for a character is alot better IMO.  I think that making citadels easier to destroy is more the answer than removing asset safety (and making asset safety cost more, asset safetying a super is still expensive).
---
Looks like the big guys will have to deal with
---
 having smaller areas. Ratting and mining will be alot less lucrative as the anoms will be harder to come by for your average line-joe.
---
I hope the sum of the changes will mean that the massive megablocks lose their viability.
---

Fantastic to see the Darkside banner flying again. I hope you guys come visit, the fights we had with you in Curse were some of the best in my Eve career.
---
CCP: You consent to PvP the moment you undock. HTFU
---
CCP knows this data without the effort of scouting. Perhaps drifters attacking structures is a reaction to this cancerous proliferation?
---
OK.  Let's see how this plays out.  I can only speak for myself right now but I'm a very, very risk averse player.  At least when it comes to PvE.  I hate losing ships to "surprise" combat.  With no local I won't undock any.  It's that simple.  
---
From now on I'll have a single subcap/dread pilot subbed (I pay to Omega, I don't Plex).
---
This is awesome! this is gonna work both ways, its easier for miners to 'hide' if they have a moon outside of d-scan or anything and hunters will have a better chance. Can we all just RELAX for a sec and see how this will turnout?
---
I have always had a neutral stance on it, yes it makes it harder for null which we can all agree is a shit show at the moment, but it also makes wormholers less rewarding. Why live in a wh when you can live in null
---
They should discuss it with the community.
---
I doubt it's going to end.
---
They will say something like: "The fluid router network is damaged beyond repair, sorry about that, buy plex to replace your lost ships, losers, git gud!!"
---
This wasn't a timer, we had a timer to kill an anchoring SnW citadel in our staging, we formed heavily for that. Minmatars declined to contest. So we took the subcaps that were willing and just burned straight to Kamela to RF U'K's main staging fort and force a brawl.
---
It took something like 40 minutes of mostly uncontested shooting at the fort until U'K and SnW really formed to counter.
---
Its pretty retarded.
---
Also just logging out in space in a recon or cloaky ship.
---
Maybe local changes is the first step toward further structure changes?
---
no shit.
---
but if you think ganking some half afk ratters are the type of content that will sustain eve then i got a bridge to sell you.
---
Here's what I would do..
---
- High Sec operates the same as always. Names appear immediately and remain for as long as you're in system. Your identity is registered by the Gates when you enter and leave the system.
---
- Low Sec names will appear immediately if you entered through a Gate. If you Cyno into a system, you will not appear right away. You only appear if you speak, or (complex mechanic) if you're reported by NPC patrol craft. If you kill the patrols quickly, they can't report you. And regardless, your name disappears after 15 min of going unnoticed by patrols or Gates.
---
- Unclaimed Null names do not appear until you speak. And your name disappears after 15 min.
---
- Sov Null names can be re-enabled via Sov mechanics. By taking responsibility for the Gates, you can achieve the same behavior as Low Sec (mentioned above). Furthermore, Access Lists can allow you to hide names from appearing in Local, allowing residents to conceal reinforcements from invaders.
---
&gt;What will be given to balance the tables? 
---
Depends what your idea of balance is tbh.
---
No Cyno, no supers?
---
Rockets on Stealth Bombers work when hunting toothless exploration ships that aren't asteros. 
---
There's dozens of little T1 explorers out there with $50m of loot in the hold and a "please don't shoot me" tank that a rocket bomber could fuck up real good.
---
PC game recommendations. 
---
Shooters.
---
Squad, 
---
PC tactical shooter, with the best PVP hands down. If you guys are still looking for ideas for your shooter concept, this is where to look. This  game has real depth as a shooter, and great gamemodes that really focus the combat. and the "Kit" system works really well too.
---
Somewhat based of the Project reality mod, that has bee going 20 years ? now, I don't even remember.
---
Rainbow Six Siege
---
20$ for grind to play version, 10 minute matches, its good for messing around, be sure to block all comms though, unless you like jita local, now with voice.

---
I think wanting to live in nullsec needs a change of view right about now, which was long overdue.   
---
I think it should be more like living in wormholes, only with cynos and sov and permanent connections. Other than that this is the sense of danger that should be in there.   
---
Risk some things, have them bashed away, fight for your thing etc. As it was before with station it was also pretty shit as there was no way of denying what's stored in a station  - a person could hold to assets indefinitely.   
---
Now, with the citadels we get all the ownership and responsibility of living in a POS + quality of life + a replacement for stations. The asset safety was just crutches, it's time to shed them. The isk will flow.
---
I'm not sure your sense of humour's still working. Changes got you rattled?
---
i cant wait for local to die, its gonna be amazing. see you hunters out there in period basis when it dies! (✿◠‿◠)
---
Wow actually not shit
---
No sov, no ability to make supers
---
"We didn't delete local for null. We know you've been asking for this since Wspace showed game play was improved by removing it so we invented drifters to implement changes in hopes of making our aging game more playable" - CCP
---
What if they could add incursion mechanics with the drifters so it incentivices ppl to actively hunt them and the tragvlians as the reward would be very good from concord compared to normal ns incursions as drifters are very good
---
Yes please.
---
Fighting an at-keyboard TEST Domi is so much more fun than ganking an afk VNI, I cant wait to see how your actual non-coward members respond do this. IIRC your Domis already have a point, so with some neuts in the highs, it can be spooky to take on with a stratios or shiny Loki.
---
dscan isn't a lot of warning for a hyperspatial fit stiletto, I dunno if bots are always aligned to something though
---
The drifters have fixed cloaky camping, you're welcome.
---
I do hope so, I wasn't originally onboard with making citadels easier to kill but the timezone tanking is a tad strong.  It's just hard to balance timezone for players and timezone for attackers.  I was thinking maybe change it so that low powered structures could just have a 36 hour stront timer ( if they even put stront into it).  Then high powered structures would have the armor timer and then 36 hours up to a week oif a stront timer.  Either that or do some kind of RNG between a set defender timezone and a set attacker timezone whewre the game rolls a die and it determines either of the timezones or somewhere in between?  (then again at that point maybe they should just make it completely rng.
---
You are a goon...you are not the little guy. How does this screw you?
---
Observatory.
---
Annouce 4 years ago. But reported.
---
the community is generally excited about this change.
---
I didn't start playing EvE until I already had all of that.  So I planned accordingly.
---
It's simple. You justify your own inability to grasp greater power, and its attendant benefits.
---
Damn CCP.  This is big... those Intel channels are going to be pretty quiet..
---
Or is it...  the invasions have caused so much load on the server our shit chat system cant cope any more and we might as well shut it down but lets roll.it up.on a cool story so no one notices (cynical  view 😉) 
---
Have the drifters come back for timers yet?
---
CCP : Drifters
---
Nullsec bears: reee CCP grrr CCP, declare war on hisec
---
CCP : that's some pretty local chat you have over there, would be a shame if sth. would happen to it. Oops. Aaaaand it's gone.
---
As opposed to using your cloaked, nullified, and polarized ship to pick and choose what fights (ambushes) you will take with little to no risk of being caught. Thus allowing you to pick apart mining gangs of bardges, and ratting cruisers at your leisure. Ratting mining in capitals has become the counter to your gameplay and your mad. Fair enough. That counter produces a even larger money influx. That influx causes inflation. Fair as well.
---
Cloaks online came first.
---
&gt; people have had enough time to move their shit around
---
Literally no? It's been a week of insta-killing npcs roaming all of null, and absolutely no heads-up about this. Absolutely no time to move assets out of null sec.
---
How can you both say "Yeah null, adapt or die" AND "You've had time to leave, now you get punished for adapting"? You're trying to eat your cake and put your dick in it too.
---
A fat bot with 100 accounts is no big loss.
---
How do you support your pvp without making isk?
---
So, you are looking forward to hitting V 1200 times an hour then?
---
&gt; Anger flares among nullsec leaders after initial Drifter assaults
---
No I mean I understand what and how it works after the fact, I'm just saying if it only works a specific way than the description should be changed, because it implies it does something **it does not**.
---
It could be a set up for observatories
---
also they for sure know how long you played. and i guess every review with &lt;5 min game time is ignored anyways
---
Even if the did it as a trial for the event.   They could tie in delay later as "Replacement systems are not yet optimal" to test out delayed local and see what works
---
In before Steven Messner writes another bad PC Gamer article about how CCP is screwing up Eve by making the great nullsec empires less safe lol.
---
&gt;players just didn't log in
---
 *citation needed*
---
I feel you, but for small ship players like me, it's easier to replace our ships, and losing your 5 killmark ship is part of the life, given the possibility to get 5 times what your ship is worth we will most likely take it. Also, cruisers are really fun to roam.
---
Fucking love it!
---
I think CCP isn't that dumb. The drifters will get dialed back, but local will not come back.
---
[Hey, don't blame us.](https://ibb.co/XsYMY5m)
---
This is already being done with Intel bots afaik. :(
---
Worth giving this a try over the current shit
---
im training for dscanless recons, not the cloaky ones. only the cloaky ones get fitting bonuses to the cloak module.
---
No drift.. oh sry nvm.
---
My immediate thoughts on this are that it will reinforce the blue donuts of the mega-coalitions but is going to be much more of an issue for the smaller guys. Loss of local is not going to be that much of an issue for people like Goons with their umbrella of hundreds of super-caps, but much more problematic for smaller groups. Therefore, I fear that ultimately this will result in a loss of content and people leaving Eve. I can't help feeling that once again CCP are doing things to please the big alliances/coalitions and don't care about everybody else.
---
i sure hope not
---
I'll be ready with my Domi then ;)
---
Just not going to log in then
---
They keep leaving subtle hints at every report. Didn't the Trigs also refer to rogue drones as Deviant Automata?
---
Yeah but that's still an improvement.
---
weren't people asking for this back before WHs were added?
---
You have no clue who actually lives in null sec, do you? It's not just big blocs and roamers.
---
The point is that this event does nothing to break up large coalitions and is, in fact, more likely to break up independent alliances, leading to a bigger, bluer donut.
---
&gt;just breaking things and seeing what happens is also fine by me.
---
They've basically said they're willing to do just that at the last few Eve events.
---
It sustains the hunters that do it for fun.
---
  People mine rocks for fun in a video game. Think about that for a second- Not everyone plays a MMO sandbox game the same way as you.
---
Incursions are an extremely fast way to pump your sec status, I went from -2 to 5.0 in under a month and I don't play for 8 hrs at a time
---
Lamayo
---
Had time since the citidel expansion, drifter have nothing to do with asset safety given they don't follow up on their timers.
---
I hope you are right.
---
You don't plant a lawn to watch it grow, you plant a lawn because you want to have a lawn and not random weeds; sorry, I mean, biome appropriate native flora that always seem to have burrs. We don't destroy citadels because it's impossible, we destroy them because we don't like the proliferation and help to stop it. The task being impossible for us to complete makes it not so different from ratting or mining.
---
Remap it to space bar, you'll thank me later. 
---
Wormholer btw.
---
"We heard null sec leaders were mad about Drifters. Oops."
---
The wormholers never stopped worshipping and sacrificing so they're unaffected. May Bob have mercy on nullsec's soul.
---
And even less players to defend against drifters.
---
We could probably balance it so that it puts less of a strain on smaller entities. For example, maybe spawning in 1 system per constellation per week (or whatever). Small entities only have to deal with that once a week, while large ones holding entire regions have to put in a lot more work.
---
1 system per constellation per week probably isn't going to be the optimal system, but it could be a start
---
Putting the pressure on the large krabbing groups (yes yes i'm in TEST), and that's a good thing. Bring more risk into nullsec.
---
Remap D-scan to spacebar.   Much better
---
It's a great change
---
Eve is living!
---
Lowsec beyond SNUFF is a thing?
---
I do PI and a little trading.  When it comes to PvP we have SRP.
---
I just disagree, there should be some help to living out in Null at least a bit.  I dont think that just having a station drop everything you have earned is a good mechanic and will force people to just store things in NPC stations again.  It also makes living in the outer regions a Giant PITA.  It's just super frustrating even when you can defend.  I am all for making asset safety cost more and for citadels dropping more loot to make killing them more worth it but to make living in null frustrating to the point of not wanting to try to store things there is just not something that should be done (and as far as I know most wormhole folks dont keep super valueable things in the wormholes and they are often much closer to a high or low sec area to store things than much of Null.
---
Like so ?
---
I can tell you how this will turn out. People will play something else
---
There will always be motivation to undock and make isk
---
That feel when you stupidly went Amarr only
---
So you're playing Eve for perfectly safe boring PvE ?
---
WH mechanics will be fine- Talk all you like- now the hunters know you're there
---
RIP in pepperoni. Fat fingers claim another bil.
---
&gt; CCP is to stupid for that
---
hmmm
---
OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY WHERE IS MY UBOAT 
---
ALL HANDS ON DICK THIS IS NOT A DRILL
---
Rorqs and Caps being the only reliable way to PVE in null is making us shiver to the core
---
A mass buyout of Curses sounds oddly...prophetic.
---
"nanofags" boy am i glad your toxic edgelord group is being forced out of eve
---
Being in a fleet with your mates, active at your pc will allow you to survive- Instead of being yet another solo rorq watching rocks shrink...
---
Why would anyone move shit out of the citadels though? Again, there was absolutely no information on this being ever a possibility. Citadels automatically came with asset safety.
---
Im thinking theyre going to turn off or delay local for maybe a week or two and observe the effects. If the desired behavior is observed (which in my opinion is probably more roaming), then theyll go forward with observatory structures or some other plan. If it just makes people turtle up, theyll turn local back on
---
that's an interesting view on possible mechanics, however I think the sov null idea you have could be a bit OP.
---
r/whoosh
---
This will be fun )
---
I'm not sure if the real alliances will accept the thousands of low sp krabbers and be willing to protect them as well. Renting space to botter alliances is cool but inviting them into their own space to protect while they give nothing back?
---
I would argue that mass bubbles on a gate and a scout do much the same as rolling off wormholes to make a hole "safe" 
---
All this change will do is damage bots and afk players. if you are on the ball, you will either hear/see a gate flash on your scout or you will see the enemy on D-scan long before they land on top of you
---
A cyno ship may have a laughable K/D.
---
Flair Checks out
---
Because it always did and players built empires around it. Querns already explained what happens if this changes. The major power blocs stage out of npc null and nothing else changes.
---
That's true.
---
I don't know about other changes, but I think the removal of local will make massive megablocks the only viable option ... only they will have the manpower and internal organization to establish a 24/7 SiG of scouts.
---
I'm trying to explain to you those texts in general. They are mostly meant to make the world more alive and not as a precise descriptions of what the item does. The attribute tab is mostly for that.
---
They'll need 2 accounts per gate to do it properly (one on each side). Even then you can just log your own alt off in the system and either keep the bot hiding indefinitely or wait out whatever timer it has. 
---
Big change is you don't need to try to time the login to the bot actually warping back to the site, because you won't be visible to him anyway. Just keep your alt logged off 30 mins or whatever while you keep hunting, then log in and tackle the bot. Easy.
---
Point is it's not preventing botting, it's just becoming more and more a pain in the ass. At some point it's just not worth it anymore.
---
my long time proposal to fozzie and the various structure devs was that some % of the asset safety fee should go to the people who killed the structure
---
It won't.
---
thats what I believe aswell. Drifters in their current form are temporary, but initiate some changes in 0.0, one of them being local.
---
So you want the rewards but without the risk?
---
Smh
---
My gameplay? I'm a big ol'krab.. but I'm able to recognised how shit nullsec is.
---
This is just getting better and better. Good man CCP, good man.
---
nice one
---
What about stuff already in the asset safety process?
---
I have no problem with removing local if they also nerf cloaking to "hard to detect" rather than "undetectable and invisible".
---
Could remap it to my push to talk / war thunder machine gun key. Add beer. Hilarity ensues.
---
If they go with observatories (Personally i'd just combine it with TCUs as they are pointless other than a name right now) then it could be just like "turning it back on" but player controlled and fueled.
---
For big entity yes, for little entity they will not survive. It's all the point.
---
How is dscan cheating?
---
CCP have said it themselves in previous fanfests- post PLEX/skins they've had their most profitable years since- hence why they rolled out F2P
---
sure but if it sustains one small group at the expense of several smaller, or a single larger group of players that's not good for the overall health.
---
not everyone plays the same because you need ALL of those groups to make the ecosystem work.
---
That's alright, you can just open up the 10 intel channels and let the program ping so you know the bad guys are coming, much better. Dangerous space being dangerous, crazy stuff
---
CCP have my babies !
---
To be honest it’s explain the seeming lack of anything else major in the past while
---
I'm in TEST too, I'm all for this. I don't krab much and mostly run small gang pvp. It's good for my lifestyle and the market will adapt.
---
some people collect stamps, some collect porn...
---
[https://i.imgur.com/oobXjRT.png](https://i.imgur.com/oobXjRT.png)
---
Why live in null when you can live in a WH?
---
Tell that to groups like Simple Farmers
---
ohno
---
That's the spirit
---
Try 10, they knew this made the game better when wspace became preferable to bears in null
---
So local not working was never a bug after all.
---
My SWAG:
---
New tech from Drifter event leads to creation of a new Upwell structure that serves as a "fix" for local.  Not perfect, will have a delay, but without throwing fuel into one of these bad boys, you have no local.  Also, they will be super easy to reinforce, allowing one to RF it and just wait the eight and a half minutes for the bots to go back out.
---
Ships exploding means more ISK flow and more ships being built too
---
I've seen internal theorycrafting, everyone's holding their cards close to their chests, and some MAJOR market manips.
---
&gt; and let the program ping
---
  What program?
---
&gt;This ship modification is designed to increase a ship's armor thermal &gt;resistance at the expense of max velocity.
---
&gt;Penalty: Using more than one type of this module or similar modules &gt;that affect the same attribute on the ship will be penalized.
---
&gt;The drawbacks of fitting this rig may be reduced by training the Armor &gt;Rigging skill.
---
This is the description of something else completely. Yet it's spot on for what it does. 
---
Why are you defending CCP for writing shitty descriptions?
---
There are no limited crafting spaces is eve as there are in Albion. Literally anyone can make a manufacturing plant anywhere in space.
---
Remember when dreads costed the equivelent of 5b, accounting for inflation, and nobody complained?
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
for me it sounds like sarcasm and seems to be more connected to the rumors about bots in winterco and the fact that (i can confirm) you receive a lot of "go die rice farmer"-mails from hostiles as soon as you kill someone. together with random tiamat square posts.
---
but again, sarcasm is humor for people with a certain level of intelligence, so i am not mad that you. at least you are able to read, so it could be worse. well done *slow clap
---
I argued a few times that I was worried that CCP would drop the ball by surprising the players with the rare extremely stupid decision, via the same delivery method that brought is drifters. It can happen, and it was not an issue this time, but lack of feedback can present issues like this. However, the following logic applies to this instance:  
---
MY BODY IS FUCKING READY
---
People just build structures in space where they want. you can easily own your own station.
---
You can't disregard the rest of the changes,  the argument becomes pointless if you do.
---
There wont be any superblocks if the isk printing factories of today are shut down.
---
Probs just a test-run to see what would happen.
---
Flair bait I suppose. "Cloaked"
---
Vs supers being dropped on T1 cruisers?
---
Logistics, can't build supers, different mechanics for newer players. Harsher citadel mechanics.
---
 I actually did live in one for a while
---
Perfect safety isn't aligned with what eve is. As such I approve this message.
---
Someone lost a rorqual to npcs?
---
Yeah like the sudden buy out of all the recons haha.
---
as part of vindi high command, i cant argue against this :/
---
It just means invaders will start showing up if they come in through your Gates. If they Cyno in, they'll still be hidden.
---
And hiding your own forces means now they need to do some Intel gathering of their own rather than just popping in and counting names.
---
We’re gonna need a bigger tear jar
---
Backlash?  People are just going to downvotes and move on without reading a single word from your post.
---
Now you're just trying to be hurtful
---
Money?
---
it's the number on the end of the bracket
---
What small entity? That thought is AegisSov all over again. The current sov system was supposed to provide for that meta, because space without bonuses is trivially easy to take.
---
It's impractical for a small entity to set up because when given a chance to join an efficient block and have allies or instead have difficulty setting up and doing logistics and be at the whims of the bigger blocs, individuals will take the first choice almost every time. The only people that don't end up being those who don't work well with others and that means logistics gets nowhere.
---
So long as it's still trivial to ruin someone's day or camp them with the threat of blops, small blocs just won't set up by themselves. The benefits of going it alone aren't there.
---
It does mean more targets in less travel, so that's good I guess.
---
wat
---
its an ironic term they say as an insult to us truly elite dvd'rs. you just dont understand because you dont embrace the ways of the chessur.
---
cast aside your rorqual and let the way of the feathering into your heart, young one.
---
i care about you.
---
Maybe multiboxing bombers will be worthwhile :D
---
And remove the mwd cloak trick
---
Downvotes are actually to the right
---
What would happen if it showed you how many people were in system, but not their name or standings? That way, you know someone came in, but don't know if theyre friend or foe.
---
I dunno, just spitballing here
---
nice try ;)
---
On the one hand, the cloaky campers that spawn this ***terrible fucking idea*** will be less of a thing if there's no local. If it's gone for a week then there's no difference, but if it stays gone then one by one all the camping operations will realize that it's a lot easier and a lot less expensive to just run a couple of active hunting alts.
---
On the other hand, making cloaking "hard to detect" would have massive repercussions for several other kinds of gameplay. Stealth bombing, blops, cloaky gatecamps, etc. Several of these playstyles are already suffering from some nasty disadvantages (particularly blops). Leave 'em alone.
---
Bye krab, you wont be missed
---
Settin' your favored krab heaven on FIRE !
---
Problem is it might make some large groups turtle up for a couple weeks out of spite (you know who you are) while the rest of the game gets healthier. I hope they're ready for that.
---
RuneScape DXP weekend soon!
---
Definitely not what I said at all.
---
except you just read and posted a comment :bigthink:
---
No local isn't the defining thing about WHs.  It's a big plus, but nobody is living in WHs because they want null-sec but really really hate local.  WHers do the WH for the meta it crafts.
---
Moon goo money &gt; wh money
---
cool story bro, can I have your stuff?
---
It's almost like someone saw a youtube video and decided to manipulate jita
---
Well yeah i hope they would be making more money than before with all the skins and skill extractors.
---
But my concern was mostly about how much weight and influence groups like the imperium can throw at their members to get a significant number of them to log off/unsub as protest. 
---
It may not be a financial risk for ccp like Incarna was, but looking at the player numbers that the game has been dealing with for the past few years, if the imperium can get a significant number of their members to unsub/log off as protest, and maybe influence members of other groups to do the same, it could be enough to cause ccp to give up on this idea prematurely.
---
Time to dust off the solo curse and hunt those botters. 
---
I just wish there was a way to gain stsndings with the drifters to be able to work alongside them. If they attack anything and everything and you just so happen to run into a drifter while hunting, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Which is good
---
beat me too it ass lmao
---
Nope they will just quit *again*, and hurt CCP's bottom line right in the wallet and lower peak concurrent user numbers.
---
Ew who actually bothers dropping those
---
Hey wormholers so we have this thing that fists space nerds out of nowhere
---
I dont think it will empty what it does is allow.smaller groups to live in null and own a bit of space even just a couple of systems.
---
Got to say this whole thing was genius move from CCP they just need to keep it..not stop in 2 weeks and it all goes back to normal
---
No one should dog you for making a choice you feel is the right choice for you, personally with as much IRL shit going on for me I've significantly reduced the me amount of time and money I was sinking into this game. All in all congratulations on winning Eve online.
---
its ok dont worry... il start building them and listing them at a normal price
---
Easy content is setting ambushes for people hunting ratters. It would be like gate camping but with a higher chance of fighting.
---
Whats most remarkable is the fact that nobody seems pissy in an /r/Eve thread
---
It's not the defining thing but it is definitely a pretty big part of it
---
Good on you for getting your priorities straight. RL comes first
---
PUTAIN DE BORDEL DE MERDE OUAIS ! RESUB'.
---
&gt; With Cynos, it'll make nullsec far more dangerous than W-Space.
---
As someone who pretty much lives and breathes wormhole, I disagree.
---
I seem to have glazed over the second sentence on the sov null idea my bad. very interesting thoughts though!
---
Oh jeez.  The conspiratards are here.
---
I was just being fake salty, it won't screw me. My point is the megablock will be the only viable option left for null as they alone are able to protect the members ... the current small alliances will lose their line members as they will join the blocks.
---
FAIT PETER LA CB GROS
---
Except only idiots and bots are krabbing because the drifters...
---
We've got an older guy in our alliance who is very good at not mentioning the other 10 people at the gate camp.
---
Is this a vid about why certain things in eve utterly sucks for years?
---
There it is. Wormhole local coming to null.
---
As you wish, Hamster
---
The power of the cloaky camper wasn't the dropping, it was the fear of the dropping.
---
why not just make local optional. if you want to share dank memes you can?
---
I upvoted.
---
Facebook used to have this monicker " move fast and break things" Hilmar may have forgot the "move fast" part.
---
Either way, we all know how well liked Facebook is, and how many people pay them money.
---
He probably meant combat recons.. haha
---
WHAT A DAY ! WHAT A LOVELY DAY !
---
Why do you need a super in a wormhole?
---
There already is help to living in null. 100% accurate intel channel called local, 100% asset safety in your citadels. 
---
And what WH groups keep all their valuable stuff outside their WH? "Yeah, important moment happening, wait for a minute and let me rage roll for a hole to my asset safety station in lowsec."
---
Or just don't login until a fleet is pinged like most people will do lol
---
So you're saying Null is easier than WHs? That goes counter to the Null narrative
---
If it’s permanent I’ll resubmit and play again.
---
Shit's about to get real!
---
I'm waiting to see how long those mineral and ore stockpiles last. If drifters continue to hit anything and everything, including killing structures, people won't be able to steadily mine the minerlas needed to build those ships. And now that the null sec local blackout has bee anounced, hunting will be fun again. At least for a while.
---
It might make invading TEST space a bit more palatable.
---
I'm assuming someone noticed it in the scope playlist, before ccp published the article.
---
Not really in a wormhole but being in a wormhole I wish I had a super I could use in null, that requires you to have a proxy corp in null. Too much of a hassle in my opinion
---
I was mostly telling the OP to grab lube because with the numbers that were on the market, this manip is about to massively backfire lol.
---
Also sweet you're in moosearmy, put em up in 08 ploz
---
Totally understandable. 
---
Forced PVE is not the thing I am looking for. 
---
Will downgrade accounts to alpha and will wait for ending of douchebaggery incursion  
---
Also there is 3.6 patch in Star Citizen coming. Can't wait to land my Andromeda with new hover mode.
---
Okay, heres what I dont get. Nullsec was a lawless wasteland with fuckall out there, until the big alliances came in, and we tamed null. We kicked out the pirates and the scum, built our own infrastructure and gear, markets and jump bridges. Null was conquered and made safe by PLAYERS, unlike Faction Space where all the work was done by CCP. 
---
And now we're being punished for it, because we did a better job then the developers at making a comfortable place to live where if you get ganked its by your own stupidity? 
---
I say Make the whole damn game like og Null, be rid of CONCORD and the safe zones, and see what we had to go through to make our homes the way they are.
---
I don't think that will be the case. That means if you have Sov, you have local. I think it would be 2 different structures if they did it
---
Haha! that's well done!
---
This was important enough to post twice?
---
I did that once too... it was horrible.
---
Null is easier to the average player. How you going to get newer players into wormholes without the "no local" argument
---
So... Nullsec is going to be the new W-space but in K-Space?
---
Not exactly : here you can drop super titan and cy no :D
---
it was important enough to read twice but only once
---
This is something to resub for if they actually go through with it.
---
Nice so I move one alpha toon into a botter system, they will forever dock up as they never see me leave
---
yes that is how a conterdrop generally works
---
Y E S
---
As a member of a smaller group the largest concern I currently have is all the recon and blops coming causing an erection that damages my pants
---
And yet it was for me as every single attempt to reset or change anything just had google push back "well you need the 2FA code (that isn't working)" and no other option than that or a new account.
---
Sometime closing the launcher and re-launching it fixes this. Try that always before re-adding everything
---
I didnt start it tho, I only bought out the overpriced ones in Amarr that im either going to lose myself or sell at a loss rofl.
---
can pvp without the isk to do it . Unless you   can plex. He cant i cant . As for CCP new were removing locals. Fine  when    my year sub runs out in  7 months i am done if this is the direction there going
---
*laughs in wormhole space*
---
Look, poking fun at ns people aside :  
---
Wormhole people have done it like that for a long time - everyone stores what he can afford to lose in a wh citadel. Isk is meant to be spent, not hoarded forever - if your booty box becomes too large that it attracts interest you could get some people trying to have a crack at it (see the siege of rage)   
---
To just try to counter your points:  
---
&gt; will force people to just store things in NPC stations again  
---
Which is exactly what most smart wormholers also do - keep important stuff in npc stations and use the exposed citadel as some sort of staging point. This increases chances of getting caught transporting stuff etc. Which gets me to the next point.   
---
&gt;  It also makes living in the outer regions a Giant PITA. 
---
&gt; and as far as I know most wormhole folks dont keep super valueable  things in the wormholes and they are often much closer to a high or low  sec area to store things than much of Null. 
---
Null has the advantage of: Jump bridges, Jump ships, local production, local markets (who knows maybe the phobos freeport republic will finally come true and live a little), proximity to npc null, proximity to lowsec/hisec (for some of the systems). Plenty of ways to make it interesting.   
---
&gt;  It's just super frustrating even when you can defend.  I am all for  making asset safety cost more and for citadels dropping more loot to  make killing them more worth it but to make living in null frustrating  to the point of not wanting to try to store things there is just not  something that should be done 
---
This looks more like rant about a personal discomfort - but null is not supposed to be as risk free as it is right now. As it is, current coalitions/standings setup and organizations have made it safer than any other area in space. I think you can objectively see that this is not the way it's supposed to be happening and CCP is finally taking steps to correct their past mistakes and take stock of the fact that it's a game, not a world, and games have rules that the players must play by.   
---
As it was up until now CCP, the fking developer, has been semi-held-hostage by a bunch of people in null threatening to unsubscribe or whatever - I think with the opening doors to serenity, getting new blood in and the nostalgia of older, more risk-prone players they are feeling confident that they would weather this storm and the weak will be weeded out from null. The economy will stabilize, other, less dangerous areas of space will become lucrative again, all good.
---
CCP realized they cant fix local.  and so descided to make an in game lore excuse before it starts happening alot more often.
---
(na, just wanted the tin foil hat)
---
So all of nullsec still...
---
they need remove all custom chats (death to intels) not only local
---
Seems legit
---
For everyone screeching reeeee the sky is falling. It's only temporary so calm your tits everyone. You'll be able to carebear I'm a couple weeks just as before. Go outside until then and get some sun I'm sure you need it
---
Wow, I'm resubbing tonight.  I hope local stays gone forever.
---
I didn't realize it at first but there will be pretty much no way to identify spies via local because you can't compare who is/isn't in local or tell who is lighting cynos unless you use some sort of autistic mandatory alliance tracking tool or a wormhole mapper.
---
This isn't jita
---
&gt; I'm a very, very risk averse player
---
Why are you playing eve?
---
It's lazy, garbage game content to drive Plex sales. That's all.
---
Oh for fuck sake, grow a pair!
---
yea, both parties can , in whs only the defenders can drop them in numbers :)
---
Depends on how long they set the timer. I’ve seen anywhere from 2 minutes to 30.
---
Let the galaxy burn!
---
I mean you are right the game would end up dying.
---
Tbh i doubt it, as i hunt for bombers bar, and i decide on which systems i go to by activity/ people in space on the galaxy map and then combat scan each system. I dont really need local for hunting.
---
Sounds a bit like CCP got tired of EVE and want to go out in a big bang.
---
Plenty of other appeal in wormholes. The fact that it's not a static geography is a huge one.
---
I've been playing it since 2003.  So get lost kiddo.
---
Did I stutter?
---
Crapppy aos. Still waiting for Angron to come destroy the Emprah
---
if you haven't yet played them on PS4:
---
 - dark souls 3 (good combat/aesthetic)
---
 - the witcher 3 (good story/ roleplay)
---
 - ark survival evolved (survival with dinos)
---
 - red dead redemption 2 (be a cowboy outlaw)
---
 - helldivers (starship troopers, the book, the game)
---
 - overcooked (party game, make food)
---
Agreed
---
Brazzers.
---
Idk it was a big reason for me, I'm sure I'm not alone, I'm sure you aren't alone either, just depends on what people want
---
Are you starting any time soon? I'm still waiting for my t2 cheap ships in Jita. 
---
It's been like a week already, stop slacking.
---
Seriously pricing out a new PC right now after more than three years of winning EVE.
---
Quick, burn the evidence, he knows too much
---
Those never stopped.
---
if they make the "local sensor" a target for entosis it could be a great idea, a target for roamers and something to defend   
---
10 minute entos and the local down for 24H &lt;3
---
This is not how you do one of these.
---

---
Sounds awesome to me!!! Death to all VNI's lol
---
10/10 would bang again.
---
Drifters bashing is a retarded workaround and I don't see anything of significance lost yet. Just random ships here and there get instapopped without an option to fight back or escape
---
yes this is reddit
---
I know, but I didn't believe that for a second until until the drifters happened, and even then I wasn't convinced. Now I am.
---
I too enjoy making snap decisions with minimal information.
---
What is the current situation in eve? 
---
1. Delve 95-99% safety for rorquals and supers 
---
2. Essoteria 95-98% safety for rorquals and supers
---
3. Detorid/Frt 85-90% safety for rorquals and supers
---
4. Drone Regions ???? they are 90% bots so hard to gage 
---
5. Gotg 85-90% safety for rorquals and supers in AUTZ
---
6. Everywhere else... you fight or die. 
---
In many ways no local actually helps the more deserted regions and smaller entities as hunters are less likely to spend time and effort in regions deemed unpopulated when they don't even know if targets are in system w/o local.
---
Wheres the risk if your shit gets magically teleported to a lowsec space station if your own gets exploded?
---
Believe in a thing called love?
---
Gas harvesting is a mixed bag. I don't know what the rates look like for hisec and lowsec gas, but for J-Space (Fullerite) gas, that stuff often is more profitable than mining most of the simpler ores. Even the really cheap Fullerite still has a price to it; and if you get the really good gas (C320, found in 'Deadly Unknown Space' as the wormhole says,) that stuff's literally a million isk per minute harvesting. However, it's also a lot easier to get yourself killed on a J-Space gas site than it is out in hisec. Gotta learn a thing or two about wormholes. This said though, actual skilltraining-wise, gas harvesting is very easy to go in to. 2 levels of Gas Harvesting and then you strap 2 of 'em to a Venture and go. Maybe 3 million ISK? (little over 1mil for each Harvester, and then another few hundred k for engines. You want an MWD, fast Align Time, and a Core Probe Launcher.) Also never warp to an Ordinary Perimeter Reservoir. Your face will be punched.
---
While that's understandable, the only thing that the TCU does currently is put your name on it. It doesn't benefit you at all. They could however implement the IHUB mechanics with installing mods. And even better, instead of fueling it, it costs the controlling alliance more money per module installed creating an ISK sink.
---
Make your damn own FTL comm structure and pay stupidly high fuel bill to run them.
---
Lol, I'm a going. An active null would be great. But there's nothing to drive conflict
---
Lets take a moment, bend the knee and pray to Bob that this happens.
---
&gt; we destroy them because we don't like the proliferation and help to stop it.
---
That's adorable.
---
Well, you can now raid Null from wormholes and not appear in local. Wormholes will be huge for getting behind enemy lines since the Null blocs are talking about having gated areas to consolidate to and post scouts on the gates to perform intel gathering/scouting.
---
You are four years late with witcher.
---
Have you not heard? It was my understanding that everyone had heard!
---
What you put into space, the station itself, the cost of its "magic" teleportation.
---
yas
---
We have so much in common! Let's hang out and watch anime
---
Empires cut all ties to Nullsec, because "fuck 'em"; Upwell develops a new structure for capsuleers to use, and everyone starts anchoring those, trying to bring them down and all those nice things that generate fights.
---
Hopefully they need a shit ton of fuel.
---
Before that there will be a short "black" period with no local in NS. The tears will be awesome.
---
Local is going away and its not 100% safety as you get a cost to it now.
---
nice stuka fleet you got there!
---
Prob will but not to live, to burn
---
Yes?
---
That's fair
---
Not really. Goons will drop a supercapital fleet to save an Astrahus if needed. Buuut, looking at other places...
---
As a compromise to preserve the non-camping playstyles, CCP could set it so that adding a cyno of any kind to a cloaky ship changes its cloaking status from total invisibility to semi-invis or whatever.
---
Nice!
---
Tinfoil hat alert: what if ccp was sick of dealing with all of the local bugs so they just said screw it and removed local. Then threw some lore stuff to cover it. I’m all for it though. I look forward to this.
---
Worst part of getting a new job is now I have to gym, a few weeks ago I stopped my 10,000+ rep/week fitness plan. I'll admit my cardio game is sub-par though.
---
I don't watch cartoons
---
One of my corpies pointed out that its so that ccp can try out no local in nullsec, and if it really goes terribly they can just be like "oh the drifters are gone, local is back". They want to test the waters.
---
you have srp because people pve. it doesn't just appear in the alliance wallet.
---
"Shortages" I bet nullsec local is about to be controlled by player owned structures. Reinforce it to disable local for a short time, and would require a new type of fuel
---
I'd go the opposite: the invader never show in local if they refuse to communicate. We need more war not more camper.
---
don't think the no local was ever used in that context. 
---
People go into whs because its fairly profitable for an individual user, the constant changing of connections means you can get a wide variety of targets to play with every day, and if you get a connection that is not worth using it, you can just roll it, also some people do like the logistical challenge of living in whs.
---
Nullsec on the other hand is just too static, you will basically be dealing only with your neighbors, and that can be pretty boring after a while. Also when it comes to profit, Also i think its still more profitable for individual or smaller groups to live inside a wh than to live in nullsec, i could be wrong as i haven't played much in whs for a few years now, but i do remember whs offering players some of the more wealthiest rewards in the game compared to what nullsec had to offer, though maybe this changed now due to Rorquals, but at least this used to be a pretty big incentive for people to live in whs.
---
Why try and coerce people to do things that aren’t fun? It’s a game why not have ccp try and come up with something that is fun to do rather than force players to do uncontested structure bash 1 after another 
---
I’d rather just go out and roam than poke some poor sod who has no chance of winning the fight at said timer
---

You would need a way to easily disable it without having to grind the other Sov structures. Otherwise we're just back in the same boat. Null blocs would have local back up and just post cyno alts in every system and drop anyone that tries to disable them. ISK would hardly be a deterrent for the big blocs, which is what these changes seem to be trying to address.
---
It would be silly to assume there would be people.
---
Battleships are known for being big
---
I know at least 2 people who bought up 20 as soon as we saw the vid.
---
Yeah I thought about that after posting. Would be incredibly easy to log off trap or wormhole, probably not viable for the botter
---
"why haven't you manipulated an entire sector of the economy yet, it's been a week" he says
---
hot damn brisc, gotta say i didn't expect to see you on this particular wagon.
---
honestly not sure if it's a good change or not, but it's definitely a change.
---
No one is arguing it is in a healthy state.
---
i had to slow the video down to x.25 and still couldnt keep up with the speed lol... u broke the record for fastest eve video ever made...
---
FYI arazu even with T2 rigs still have 3.7s decloak delay 5s without
---
I'm gonna enjoy the salt so much. Not from caught ratters and miners, but from you lot when you realize: a) afore mentioned ratters and miners will take refuge in hisec and b) the Drifter invasion will be ramped up so much you'll be too busy defending structures to hunt anyway. :-P
---
Suicide ganking. Set up two accounts, one shooter, one scout. Blow up shiny autopiloters and pick up the loot. Use the money to set up more accounts. Eventually, you'll be able to gank freighters.
---
I don't know about Curses, but I am 100% confident that the price of all T2 Cloakers is about to spike.
---
Yeah sorry about that, I had to get the propaganda out fast
---
I meant like, online.
---
EVE seems to have a lot of crying.  I just downloaded the game and all I hear is crying.  Is it always like this?
---
Null would say goodbye too, but she really doesn't think you're worth it, not with all the other krabbers she's stringing along.
---
You stay long enough without a local people are going to forget you were there or eventually wonder if you logged off or moved on. And people aren't watching every gate all the time.
---
I would argue that Wormholes have alot closer connections to NPC stations than most of null.
---
&gt;Null has the advantage of: Jump bridges, Jump ships, local production, local markets (who knows maybe the phobos freeport republic will finally come true and live a little), proximity to npc null, proximity to lowsec/hisec (for some of the systems). Plenty of ways to make it interesting.
---
Each of the benefits you stated that relate to the citadel services or to the new flex structures all cost fuel already so it's paying for those benefits.  Having to always jump things back and forth from your storage to your staging is super duper tedious.  
---
Ofc its arant about personal discomfort as any "living anywhere" discussion will be as that what living is so you don't really have a point there.  Null does need more risk which is what this local going away is about, but that doesnt mean it should also lose asset safety.  This would be a move that would move it from balanced risk reward to just plain more risk than is worth the reward.  So it is not objective to see that "that's the way it's supposed to be happening" at all.  Having to purely store everything valueable in an NPC station is not good gameplay (I would argue the same for wormhole space but again they often have closer ties to an NPC station AND they have mechanics inherent in wormholes to keep people out or at least a lot of people to prevent station destruction (or delay it enough).  Not to mention back when I was a newer player ( and skill injectors weren't a thing) , trying to help my alliance in null sec without any real station docking and a jump capable ship of my own was damn near impossible (I was able to suicide alot of ishkurs into caps though...not that that did anything...).  You really didn't counter my points you just kinda pointed out the imbalance of the risk vs. reward this would cause.  I'm all for more risk but balancing the mechanics for the long run is important.
---
I am actually legitimately so impressed that they're willing to do that. It's an excellent step in the right direction and one I frankly did not believe they had the balls to do. Which is high praise from me considering I lost all faith in CCP about 3 years ago.
---
that's because i refused to pay full price for it.
---
Im pretty sure I PvP more than you.  I live in Provi defending my sandcastle is a daily chore.  This blows balance out of the water. I think you fail to understand how multifaceted of a game Eve Online is and why its been around so long.  Theres something for ppl who prefer strategy games where we build our civilization up in sov null. Then there are instant gratification types who prefer candy crush and call of duty style game play that do not build empires just undermine to various degrees.
---
You can't spot a joke even if someone throws it at your face, can you?
---
Correct.
---
Can't remember the name of it, sure goons will be able to tell you though
---
Time to dust mine off. Goodbye to the Lachesis master race.
---
You know you can buy supers, you don't need to personally built it.
---
How about leave covert cyno as is.   It would make blops viable again.
---
For the people who say botters will leave cloaked intel scouts on gates, you're missing some of the picture. The fact is once you've entered their system there is no way for them to know when you've left. You could be cloaked in system somewhere, could be in a recon, or you could be logged off for an hour and give them a surprise when you log back in because they won't see you use the gate.
---
Such a nice guy. :)
---
Could this possibly be flavouring downtime due to maintenance/patch of local chat system?
---
Can confirm, Siege Green will hotdrop 10 carriers for just a single assault frig, T2 destroyer and recon cruiser.
---
Maybe CCP should add an option to dscan where you can set it on auto dscan periodically (and have a dial to be able to set the time frame of how often you want the dscan to ping). Just like submarines, I don't think the cap'n has to spam a button every time he needs his sonar to ping
---
You can always move to hisec.
---
Youre probably one of those assholes that just bottoms feed on Provi
---
Bandwidth concerns sounded to me like "we've gotta shut down local in null so that we jave thw resources left to keep it running in lowsec and highsec."
---
Hey look, a way for ccp to introducue obsirvatories. As upwell makes a new communication structure for null sec ppl
---
I thought I knew what a stuka fleet was but now I know I don't, sooo whats that?
---
Inshallah brother
---
*memes*
---
Nope just not going to log in
---
They wouldn't show up if they Cyno'd in and avoided detection. They would only show up if they came through a Gate that was reporting back to the Sov holders. And even then, they'll disappear after 15 min of avoiding detection again.
---
Concentration’s actually counterproductive. After a point, and not a high one at that, the dscan clutter in a well-occupied system is impossible to figure out. On the other hand if if know there are at most a couple of dozens friendlies and that they fly X, Y and Z, you’ll be able to quickly identify an attacker. It’ll reward alliances/corps that spread out, standardize ships and get good on comms.
---
Gangs will have to form to deal with the player incursions!
---
This is Awesome!
---
Oh i'm sorry i did't know that hisec and lowsec didn't have moons.
---
We are we exited? Kinda out of the loop (noob-player)
---
Not really. The idea of cloaky campers is that you know they’re there and could uncloak and light a cyno at any moment so most people would just stop ratting or mining in the system. You could effectively shut down industry within that system while being completely afk. Now, stuff will likely die more often, but also, people will still be willing to undock and make money in the mean time because they have no idea they’re being camped.
---
Stuka fleet is basically the same as a Goku fleet
---
As someone who's lived in both Wormholes and Nullsec as both ratter and hunter, I disagree with your disagreement.
---
You cannot get a ship into a wormhole unless it travels through a wormhole into system.  There is no other way, and a fact of life without cynos.  What comes through a WH is what's in system.  If you have scouts on wormholes into your system, you will have forwarning of any fleets coming.  If they've logged a fleet off in system already, then they've exerted a bunch of time and effort to camp a **single** system.
---
In Nullsec, even with 24/7 scouts on the gate, without local you will never be able to know who is inside that system.  It's impossible.  I can take one covert cyno character through a gate into your home, BLOPs bridge in another hunter, and then leave with the original character.  The only thing that watching gates would tell anyone is that one character came in, and then one character left.  
---
I can do this with an entire constellation.
---
I can then, at my leisure, call my guys to swap into a T3C cruisers/logi and warp to a Blops Bridge, and teleport them ontop of whatever completely unawares target I desire in a dozen different systems, from a dozen jumps away.  It takes like 2 minutes to get ready.
---
There's no forwarning and no sane way of defending against this.
---
Good for new players
---
Not having to grind all day to make _any_ amount of ISK whatsoever?
---
Idk what that is either I guess
---
You're right. This game is literally unplayable.
---
you mean like every wormholer in existence? Already a portion of the playerbase that's used to this mate, it'll be awesome. With right ships/fit you can dscan an entire large system in less than a minute.
---
Yes really because now the ratter is trading just docking up for losing stuff, thus making the cloaker more powerful.
---
Doubt it.  They are candy crush players who cant think hard or long enough to build something in nullsec.  Why you think it took TEST a decade to become something half decent.
---
More like CCP not listening to a damn thing CSM says half the time is what has us here in the first place.
---
ISK being a deturrent isn't the point, it's creating an isk sink that spans across all of nullsec which helps the game's inflation balance out. 
---
in reality yes there would be a response every time someone tries to disable the TCU or whatever structure controls local, but I doubt there would be a cyno alt in every system, esspecially if you own a large amount of space. But this response would likely be the same as those reinforcing ihubs, probably even less as local isn't as important IHUB control but would be worth more than current TCUs now which no one really cares about.
---
Basically AB fit bombers + support such as kikis or harpies and some logi
---
Any other suggestions?
---
Stuka fleet is shield goku with added mjd dessies (and sometimes cynabals becuase Pandos still got lp built up from curse). Classic Goku was pre mjd dessie so if someone wants to go full well actually test is running a stuuka fleet there.
---
https://i.imgur.com/5EUaFNn.png lol
---
Yeah and that encourages gate camp or at least spam gate bubble. No thanks.
---
Bye
---
Shutting down an entire corp’s industry for days is way more financially destructive than one dude losing a Thanatos.
---
While that could be true, I think it's to introduce new mechanics.
---
If they see people resub they'll consider making it a permanent feature. Remember companies at the end of the day want more money
---
It only took them 10+ years but sure.
---
Die, check intel whilst shouting could have warned me!!!!            
---
             
---
See gang reported half an hour earlier.           
---
            
---
Rinse repeat
---
But it does both now?
---
So you: 
---
* Reply to a comment and pretty much say, "What the guy above me said". 
---
* Then you say, "The descriptions are Flavor Text". 
---
* I show you they're not flavor text, that they normally mean and say with whatever the object does. And I could show that same fact over and over again with practically any other In Game Item. 
---
* You have nothing left to say, because you're wrong, "So the game is literally unplayable". 
---
Sorry you don't care past making your own point.
---
b-b-b-bird bird bird, birds the word!
---
cool thanks
---
As a grown adult without the nerd level activity time available to me (a la wife, kids, work, bills. Blah blah). I just wont have the time to adjust. Not saying this is a bad thing or bad for the game. But for me, if local is gone, hampered or delayed. I just wont have the time or will to adjust. 
---
I wish Eve well and all. v0v, guess its just time me.
---
&gt; buy plex
---
Some people will do that, for sure. But they use their (irl) wallets to solve their problems already. I think most people will just have their alliances tell them how to krab more safely in the new meta. There will be lots of weeping and gnashing of teeth, but krabs will find a way.
---
This is all if it's permanent though. I will be _very_ surprised if there is not some exception. Even if it keeps happening it won't be 24/7/365 all over NS. There will be ways to mitigate or wait it out or move somewhere else.
---
Imo nullsec local chat should be a sov upgrade, with the default being delayed.
---
Have CCP officially announced local will be deactivated, or is it based just on the Scope video?
---
I dont think the drifters are ment to be permanent I think the hs ones are. Something about the ui not being there screams its temporary. 
---
I hope they add trig invasions to ns with structure bash mechanics. The issue with the drifters is they dont drop trash. They should drop t3 salvage stuff. Its wierd and I hope ccp has a plan lol.
---
Bro we already do this in w space.
---
can't pve and bash structures at the same time
---
It really does. Half of intel channels are reporting stuff they've seen on Local.
---
Delayed local is ok with warp speed rigged hurricanes
---
THEY'RE PUTTING CHEMICALS IN SPACE TURNING THE FREAKIN CAPSULEERS STRAIGHT
---
Local is perfect intel. It makes it so when you go pvp hunting through nullsec anyone there will know the moment you enter system and they can go to safety till your gone.
---
It basically makes 0.0 safe to PVE in and allows bots to bot freely.
---
Without local bots wont know you are there so they are doomed. Without local regular carebears wont see you coming unless they are vigiliant with dscan.
---
[It's happening](https://images.app.goo.gl/JCZjyb14RBgXpQHv9)
---
And thank fuck for that.
---
This was more along the lines of what I was thinking. Though I hope they don't go the "fuel" route and more the ISK cost route like IHUBs and TCUs do currently that way we can have more ISK sink in EVE.
---
Unironically, it sounded yesterday like our cap pilots were having the time of their lives in the morning and afternoon (USTZ-relative) hunting drifters and then in the evening waterboarding Goon assfrigs.
---
Already did, joined a j space corp and was getting ready to buy stuff to hurf around null sec in.
---
Lmao yikes
---
what the fuck is that wolf fleet
---
this is incorrect. You still need docking for super/titans, and you still need the industry bonuses from sotiyos/industry citadels that will then need to be defended. And if you actually think that goons, for example, are going to move their 10,000 citadels out of delve just so they can park their already unreasonably large titan/super fleet in npc stations "just in case" they get evicted, well... I've got a lowsec gate to stain i want to sell you.
---
Also, Querns is a certifiable moron, probably shouldn't listen to someone who mines all day and has no actual tactical or strategic insights to offer.
---
until its alts on all gates into krab space 
---
Until then its a good change
---
remove cynos
---
WTF why is CCP nerfing my playstyle
---
well can i have your things when it never stops?
---
The beginning of the game is considerably harder when you're weak and all the monsters are strong. Once you get started and have proper equipment/skills, it gets easier (◕‿◕✿).
---
10$ per month for local chat. gg ez
---
Resubbing
---
Did they do this?
---
Hey dasro, I own a super for use in null AND live in wormhole! You can do it too!
---
Delete your account please.
---
GOKU fleet best fleet!
---
As long as this observatory structure doesn't have 3 timers I am totaly ok with it.
---
Goku bombers don't have the "Jericho Trumpet" modules fitted.
---
First time I’ve considered it in two years, might be fun
---
Market runs empty. Pvpers forced to learn industry.
---
Whoaaa. The implications of item 7 could be HUGE. 
---
Possible null asset safety changes?
---
Go to jail
---
Only if the new fuel uses ozone
---
Reduced bandwidth to me just sounds like it'll only show local of people that are using the network. Like in wormholes.
---
This would actually be a positive change. Please explain why you believe it's cancer?
---
&gt; As reported in The Scope earlier today, over the coming days we’ll be changing the way local chat works.
---
&gt; This change will affect the whole of nullsec space.
---
&gt; **Local chat in all nullsec space will be switched over to delayed mode. This means that it will behave as local chat in wormhole space, with pilots only appearing in the local population listing should they choose to post messages.**
---
&gt; Obviously, this will cause a substantial change to the dynamics of nullsec, so we want to inform the community before we begin.
---
&gt; The duration of this blackout is undetermined, and we’ll be monitoring what effect this has on the cluster.
---
&gt; We will give at least 48 hours of notice before initiating the blackout so pilots can make the necessary preparations.
---
&gt; [If you’d like to discuss this announcement, feel free to do so in the comments thread here.](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/local-comms-blackout-discussion-thread/171935)

Gimme the dates so I know when to do something else besides roaming, since I know I won't find anything.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pu69gy/nullsec-local-blackout-incoming-during-july
---
For someone just coming back, who never really got into the game in the first place. Could you explain why force recon ships?
---
Maybe bluing half of blue and having nip's and nap's with the rest is the opposite way of driving conflict?
---
Oh my
---
Null is already empty. There are regions where you can go 10,15,20 jumps at a time and not see a single person out in space. This is literally already the game right now.
---
Cry moar
---
Was talking with some friend about this over the holiday and many of them said the same.
---
Local or not all your activity will still be broadcasted for anyone interested by ingame map statistics. Hunters will always know that there is someone blind.
---
Ratters will basically adapt. Over time, fewer players will be in space.
---
What is interesting is that the free intel zkb provides is untouched. Cant even have kills on delay.
---
Guess CCP doesn't want me in this game anymore.
---
First they drive me out of hisec, now they drive me out of nullsec, wormholes and lowsec suck anyway, where to?
---
Unsubbing, I guess.
---
LMFAO
---
i hope you enjoy your well earned break  (✿◕‿◕✿)
---
OH MY GOD YES.
---
Krabs have 48 hours to stock up on lube
---
I guess local is going to be gone soon, so it doesnt matter. Now you have to spend even more time roaming.
---
This. It should be an arms race where detecting "barely" wins out with max skills and lots of practice. Maybe make cloak modifiers skill based as well, lowering to a %7 chance of being detected or something. Perfect cloak has always kinda bothered me.
---
Welcome to J-Space!
---
Nullbear hunting season for wormhollers cometh
---
The way the csm is set up it’s bound to fail too much back scratching and vote selling going on to have anything other than the benefit of the players running the top alliances/coalitions having more power which isn’t what’s best for the majority
---
Oh so you're a bitter vet? Lol
---
lol now that it's announced to be delayed mode only
---
If this is known to be temporary it's quite possible it will make all the krabs unsub for a while and fuck the game.
---
resubbed. Is dreddit still recruiting?
---
"This is why CCP shouldn't be taking game design notes from Reddit"  its like checkers players trying to write the rules on chess.
---
Ah, this will be interesting. Is the blackout only for null?
---

Look how they try to save the game and destroy the game rigjt a way with a big smile...
---
Yes, it's bullshit but what other choice do we have?
---
here’s a picture of nothing!
---
#Gottem
---
Drifters = shit
---
No local = fucking sweet
---
You could always move into a wh if you're risk averse...
---
I'm not bitter.  Just vaguely irritated.
---
V key every where violently over throw all capsuleers everywhere.
---
Nobody buys my stuff yet. I call shenanigans on OP.
---
Can you name some of these small nullsec alliances that are acting independently of the big coalitions and also holding their own space?
---
I'd love to hear from " the underdog "
---
"Pvpers" dont want fights, they want ganks. If they wanted fights they wouldnt want thier presence unknown
---
All these people resubbing because Null no longer has local are going to be disappointed when 50 man Azura fleets aren't enough to threaten null super fleets
---
structures yes, stations no. you have to dock in station to see.
---
Jesus titty fooking christ.. how awesome is this, I know where I will be heading 😎
---
I for one look forward to these changes and think it will be a healthy change for the game.
---
Well the hunters will have to spend time flying around a system now trying to see if anyone is even undocked or online in system
---
Good thing I don't live in wormholes, oh wait ccp is changing nullsec into wspace. Why do they think nullsec people need this. If people wanted to interact with this they would live in wormhole space.
---
Well there is a fair chance that they would do so permanently which is why they want to try it out. They are trying to shake things up and see how it goes without completely breaking the game (again). Unfortunately I don't think it will go well, some ideas are alright even though IMO the are being implemented terribly. But trying to do some sort of weird semi-reset at this point imo is just stupid and/or desperate. Too much damage already done :|
---
It looks like it's the whole of July... well, at least the rest of July.
---
I can live with a 30s delay  or so in local. But straight  up removal hell no. That delay would also give captor scouts time to cross systems  undetected
---
Master Chief collection is coming to PC along with destiny 2 which your character will be able to be played with across multiple platforms starting in october I think.
---
heretic
---
Luckily for bots they have perfect reaction to new signatures. Oh well, if you had any brain, you'd not be CODE...
---
I think this would work better as a true delayed local, not pure WH space local.
---
youre not missing anything. Mittens is just spinning as usual to hide his incompetence.
---
Dominion sov, "Surely this will break up the blobs."  Jump Fatigue, "Surely this will break up the large alliances."  Fozzy sov, " Surely this will break up the coalitions."  And now here we are, "Surely this time CCP, will break up the megablocks."  Every time CCP has implemented a game mechanic shakeup, the armchair, game mechanic analysts, proclaim that this will surely break up the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  It however, has ultimately resulted in a concentration of null entities into larger and larger entities into smaller and smaller footprints.  I'm afraid this is just going to result in more of the same, until CCP realize that their shitty ideas for game mechanics are what is causing it.
---
what gameplay?
---
CCP now adds local to WH.
---
My favorite so far has been a delay, so long as you are holding cloak.  This would allow hunters to get DScans done, decide which anoms to shotgun, etc while still allowing current intel channels.  I could live with that.  But 10, 30, 60, whatever, most will adapt, many will die, those who quit: give me your stuff.
---
QQ
---
Can I have your assets?
---
No prob the day they kill local is the day I resub 3 accounts.
---
What a time to be alive
---
Well this should be fun...
---
They still get a nice buff tho
---
Totally valid point, turning such a vital part of the defensive infrastructure into an isk sink would be great.
---
Pls tell me this is real.
---
Could you translate what is happening to an eve noob(ish) that hasn't played in awhile? I just started t2/3 research when I quit, no idea what is happening
---
could hint suspended asset safety in null in general, as long as the drifters are here
---
cry more
---
The only ships worth undocking will be big and tanky. Supers, rorqs. Ones that can survive long enough for fleet to drop and save it. This will not affect rich players, only average ones. Imagine how fun is to rat now in vni or some other semi afk ship. Now you will have to dscan all the time, have multiple clients with eyes on gates (similiar way to wh), and for what? 60 mil an hour? Currently it is a chore while watching Netflix, new way will simply be pointless. So people with multiple accounts will stop subbing them as there wont be any point in doing that. You think null is dead and empty now? Wait few months and compare stats.
---
About fucking time
---
Good hunting boys
---
Sure.... aslong as observatories cant detect blops and a group of blops can easily disable it
---
I wouldn’t bet on anything with a higher align time. I’ve heard they insta-scram.
---
A FLEX structure that brings back local in a limited fashion, for just 50 F-PLEX a month (that cost 10 plex each)
---
I suggest finding your balls lol
---
I am curious if sporadic blackouts or constant blackouts would create more content? When the blackout is turned off, it should be shorter than the period that it is on.
---
Wow nice!
---
Yup I could see this but I hope they add some sort of use for them outside of nullsec; the first thing i thought of when they talked about this WAAAY back when was being able to use them to scan down special sites or something kinda like the sleeper caches
---
currently, yes. and with a warning, and with an end date/time. 
---
the fucking tears are hilarious
---
This will be fantastic. Now that pve is turned off we can all focus on PvPing each other. 
---
Finally. This was badly needed for so long!!!!!!
---
Oh and bot this bot that.
---
In the news ticker it said, interbus is struggling with the asset safety but won't name any details about it... so seems likely that thats next on ccps list
---
the nulltard salt is the best thing that could ever come from this beautiful game 
---
thank you ccp
---
Id personally prefer a more mild nerf, like dropping the equivalent in loot to the asset safety fee, rather than nuking AS entirely.
---
I am saying they will change where they are staged from as to prevent massive asset loss for their members. Also this doesn't even account for players who leave eve. Do I now have to move my assets out of null before I take a break? This would lead to people who take a break and come back to find they have nothing to just quit again.
---
Wah wah wah
---
Killboards Will go red. The age of Bob is here, as has been foretold. The drifters are nothing more than the instrument of his holy Will. 
---
And yeah... Botters gonna be mad.
---
Local chat currently instantly shows up people who enters in it;
---
Now it wil entered in delayed mode; so people will only shows up in local when they will speak to the Chan (as it is in WH)
---
Indeed, which is why the existence of *Asset Safety* makes absolutely no sense
---
Also a lot of people will come back to eve since they can now maybe hunt again as they did 3-4 years ago
---
So you think insta killing drifters are a good thing? Would you support these being added to all sections of space?
---
Cry, a lot.
---
FUCK YEAH ! Pulsar my favorite
---
So fucking glad I resubbed
---
Did they ever stopped recruiting ?
---
Good for him!
---
Yes they are. 
---
Listening and no longer giving Goons everything they want. 
---
Fuck nullblocs.
---
People play this game?
---
Imagine being so retarded that you unironically use holding sov as a yardstick
---
Man those goalposts move fast from "The drifters are countering citadel spam"
---
Good!
---
High-sec pubbies can't answer that question, no.
---
Bollocks
---
Maybe Nullsec is too safe and it shouldn't be.
---
I have feeling that Hilmar an finance team did not get information about this change
---
abso fucking lutely
---
drifter and trig wars in hisec with public fleets to third party would be the best player retention driver of all time
---
Ooh nice. Wait I couldn’t find a end date? I should get more into it
---
Starcraft 2 is pretty fun to play for an hour if u like a quick game session like I do
---
this
---
cloaky camping needs to not be required to do anything in null
---
I mean they are implying they are communication and seeing how the community reacts. It's pretty clear they didn't communicate and I doubt they are actually paying attention to the people they are affecting.
---
Your inadequacy is laughable.
---
I expect some pretty large perma gatecamps. At least at the start.
---
Dude, I swear i'm not stalking but you bring up the most tedious of points. Just don't own that fucking much at a time in a single citadel :)   
---
If you need to take a rl break for more than a week, if you think your alliance is in danger of losing the station you docked it just ... move the things away.  Put your subcaps in your titan, log it off at a safe. Have only ships you use currently and/or some doctrine stuff, etc.   
---
I don't think individual players are the ones to cry about this - maybe traders and builders would have more reason to squeal but for the regular joe is more of an issue of self-discipline.
---
Don’t forget to mention all the salt in local and chat about submitting tickets to complain lol
---
AI vs AI hypeee
---
Why would dying randomly to NPCs drive player retention?
---
Or at least delay it.
---
All hail our Drifter overlords
---
Or a cyno alt from an army of 200 free skillfarms, that's been logged in cloaked since downtime, lights a cyno (not possible in wormholes btw) and drops a load of bombers on you.
---
So hunters can come in and warp straight to sites they know targets will be at with no warning, especially for hot drops.
---
This won’t mix well with cynos, and if it’s temporary i’ll just unsub everything but my pvp alts and join the easymode kills against the brave idiots who still will play.
---
It’s already too easy to catch big shit with hot drops, this will make it a new tier of aids
---
.  It’s hard to catch small shit, so this will help with that i guess. 
---
It’ll only be fun for the only group this will benefit: the hunters.
---
The hunters will still see the max upgraded ore systems (unlike whs)
---
The hunters will still see the npc killed per 24 hours(unlike whs)
---
The hunters will still be able to enter system and go straight to their target’s hunting grounds (similar to whs) and hot drop 500 friends in with no fast tackle risk required (COMPLETELY unlike whs)
---
So.  No.  Unless they change things tremendously this will only hurt people who don’t bot since these changes to make it easier and easier for the hunter to win will not go well.
---
Yes yes i’m a dirty krab don’t undock etc.  I’ll enjoy abusing these mechanics myself, but they’re fucking toxic and stupid
---
They already are, they are REALLY screaming at Reddit.
---
I guarantee if the rest of space was getting hit the way null is, they would be as frustrated as we are.
---
OUT-FUCKING-STANDING
---
Sounds like you've got some time on your hands, just search Jita and Orca. It's one of those. You'll find it. I believe in you. It's not like bees undock anyway.
---
I see you are afraid to loose your no effort, free intell.
---
Local, and the intel networks people use to be safe in nullsec were here 3~4 years ago.
---
I'm somewhat skeptical about this idea that the effective removal of local chats from nullsec will bring back the bitter vets that quit for a variety of reasons over the past few years, but we'll see i guess. 
---
At the very least this will cause fucking chaos which is something i definitely appreciate for sure.
---
Yup. This seems to make sense to me.
---
This change doesn't negatively affect me, I don't rat, or mine, for isk. I just think this is going to cause a lot of people to either not undock while this is being tested, or only undock when they're 95% certain they can be saved if they're tackled.
---
So we’re ruining the game for hi sec miners by not undocking? I’m confused
---
I'm hoping this all leads to the launch of intel structures that require constant fueling (no more than 1 week in the bay) with a fuel generated through PI+Mining.  Logistical pain in the ass to manage hundreds of systems?  Yes please.  Break down into "local governments" handling your own area of the alliance.
---
It would be icing on the cake if they only gave anonymous hits until someone speaks.  Ie. you know there are 8 people in Local.  You are one.  Three of them are allies, which is revealed to you.  You have no idea of the alignment or names of the other four unless they speak.
---
aww you have to use dscan instead of pushing 5 buttons and going afk, poor you.
---
That’s his point, and imho that’s a positive thing.
---
Thx CCP for Eve. It was a great game to play for those 11 years. If this change will last longer than summer ends I am out for good. At least WoW Classic is comming so I will have more time to play it...
---
Goon tears, best tears
---
I intensely dislike the whole skill injector mechanic, and I refuse to engage with it. When I leave EVE, my skillpoints are going with me.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
I think if they have any interaction with blops at all it should be limited to "beep" - COVERT CYNO DETECTED.  
---
They probably already know that since there's some guy on comms screaming he's tackled by blops. :P
---
So same as today?
---
Shh, don't talk to him. You'll break his narrative
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh filthy krabwhore.
---
It's ok to cry, you don't need to hide your salty tears behind that hollow, dead-eyed laughter.
---
Null sec is a fat bloated sack of useless shit that turned a once great game into Farmville 2.0
---
It's time for a change. Deal with it or cry. your choice.
---
Biomass your characters after you send me your stuff.
---
First off, fuck the csm and just about every useless figurehead that's ever been on it.
---
These recent changes are shaking up the game and that is what is needed.
---
HURRR LOOK AT GOONIE TEARS god shut the fuck up you're an idiot to not realize how this will take a shit on active player base
---
Warframe is not bad actually. Plenty of farming and only consensual PVP.
---
Are the people who are salty over local the ones who are turbo crabbing or just afk/bottling for isk?   This local thing seems to me will only change the game for then since competent players know how to stay safe.
---
The olde ad hominem defense. Solid
---
They can plan to implement it, but it would surely kill their sub. 
---
Like someone said below, it will mean you will only see people for Umbrella alliance in space.
---
brb, pinging GSM to bring this long neglected feature to W-space. It's a crying shame and a disgrace that CCP have just utterly slacked off on bringing  you guys the benefits of unfettered power projection, and this second-class treatment of you ends now.
---
b/c highsec isn't.... ? lmao gtfo dude
---
Just have to dust off ye olde t2 bpo’s
---
You're wasting your time. They just aren't *smart*.
---
You mean like most of the regional intel channel bots?
---
But it does not work so well against wormholes or covert cynos in system
---
This is gonna suck a bit and I'll probably die a lot...but I'm strangely excited.
---
This is Patrick
---
&gt; the megablock will be the only viable option left for null
---
And how exactly did you arrive at this conclusion? Small groups in wormholes protect themselves all the time without local - it is called having situational awareness.
---
High sec isn't as safe as null now a days. Prove me wrong.
---
Could you please donate your stuff to MechaJeb Kerman's Thrasher fund on your way out?
---
I've been nicking wrecks here and there with my astero
---
Are you actually that retarded?
---
Hahaha CCP is probably migrating the chat servers around and don't want to bother with apologizing for countless outages, so decided to make a feature out of it xD
---
Yeah, as long as more people don't rage quit. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.
---
Because then people in stream chat start counter dropping
---
1) 500m Meg is "blinged a lot"? We have a VERY different definitions of blinged. I'd say 200-300 - normal, 400-600 - good, 800-1.2b - blinged, 2b+ - blinged a lot.
---
2) You suggesting 2x1b Proteuses on other side, but want Meg to be t2 for 230m? Kinda unfair.
---
Anyway, glad that we get each others points. o7
---
\&gt; "Drifters, if given the opportunity, will always mercilessly pod capsuleers."  
---
Mwhahahahahaha.
---
People will just dock and play something else. Way to go reducing content.
---
I get it man. I've played in all areas of space but this has been a long time coming. Shakeups are needed! And honestly null is a bit too comfy with asset safety and local. It's supposed to be wild space you have to fight to keep and the local change is a step in that direction.
---
Technically, there are only caps in WHs, no supers or titans.
---
Right now the achievements are meaningless.  Looks like they may be moving toward an SP reward for them though.
---
Space, the final frontier.  Welcome to chaos, love it!  Let's hope there are plenty of NS toons that don't pay attention to intel channels.  Cant wait to roam out of WH space to NS with local working "sporadically"...
---
I suppose that means apps like vintel will still work and BOT scrips won't react to neut in local (or at least the bot won't warp on upon new neut in local)
---
Hey everyone.
---
I'm really happy that I run a decent sized wormhole corp based in thera, with a full logistical supply stocked into the main station.
---
Join 'Sons of bob' if you're a returning player, a newbro wanting to slaughter, or really wanna poke around with this local of local.
---
Time to burn nullsec boys!
---
wormholers?
---
More citadels is not the answer to safe EvE.
---
Anyone that has half a braincell will just wait cloaked next to the target until it warps to the next anom to tackle it so it can't instawarp.
---
I can't believe you wasted the time to create a machine to post this :-D
---
not the n+1 gameplay for sure:)
---
Scaling back PvE also scales back SRP, which scales back PvP.  I mean there may be consequences that are unintended here.
---
im not the one re-posting the same meme over and over like an un-original window licker
---
I can not be held responsible for your life choices.
---
Growing a pair?
---
Dumbass.
---
The number of people against the change and for the change are pretty even.  So, yeah.
---
Anyone notice that around the 1:00 mark, maybe just before....
---
She REALLY enunciates "salt" in "assault"
---
Goddamn I love CCP for this
---
I mean, better late than never is solid advice for all kinds of things:
---
Sex for one, but you're probably not very familiar with it.
---
As well as unbridled arrogance, although we can come talk to Imperium members on Reddit for that.
---
I will be resubbing because of this.
---
&gt; window licker
---
that's a meme, not original
---
[Yep.  There's fun to be had.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c9hof9/the_power_of_goku/)
---
Not an option sorry, Wts a few dozen keepstars please contact Smuff Gallente in game tia
---
This is about drifters in null. 
---
Do you know how’s many times i tackled someone in delve only to have my corpies bail cause its delve and they don’t wanna fight titans everytime.
---
Like fuck man. Ya’ll make small gang ware-fare impossible and you’re shitting on our only way of leveling the playing field.
---
:/ Now I can't spam without giving away Intel. Ree
---
That's not happening here either. Just nullsec structures and power blocs. They're wiping a section of the game clean so it can FINALLY BE FIXED! :D :D
---
If goons have their way eve is dead within 2 years as no one would have stuck around to bother fighting them with shitty ass super/titan mechanics and proliferation. 
---
While I think actually balancing the game as it relates to supers/titans/citadel spam/ and fatigue less jbs is preferable to eliminating local. This is good enough to keep me around to see how it shakes out. 
---
Me and most of the small gang hunter class players that I know have either been leaving or on the verge of leaving the past year (AT Loss/ inability to roam hostile space w/o running into titans every other gate/ instant fleet response with fatigue less jbs). Don't think this change will necessarily make roaming viable again due to boson gate camping but who knows. 
---
Maybe the krabs will all quit, maybe they will all move to hi-sec or maybe they will adapt either way its a change to the completely static boring state of the current meta.
---
The minute I stop pointing out that a person is being a dumbass is the minute they can bury my cold, desiccated corpse.
---
I forget those places exists sometimes.
---
TL;DR
---
 &gt;only consensual PVP.  
---
How else do you achieve an erection then?
---
Your shift lock is on.
---
people like us in goons, Test, FRAT, maybe Horde and DeadCo will deal with it just fine - we have the numbers and alts to monitor gates and just 3rd party software all the hostile information
---
What this really does is nukes all the other groups in the game attempting to establish themselves in 0.0, additionally the 'defender' (with said 3rd party software) will have an extraordinarily large advantage over the \~elite pvp\~ duder who has no knowledge of what or who is in system
---
Imagine having to gate around in Delve, where before you could see some well known names like "MrFriskar TheSisterFister" and be like "*oh I bet he's set up to boson somewhere*" - now there is just going to be no warning, and there will most likely be a titan on every gate without the fear of exposing themselve via local name. Good job, everyone nerfed themselves.
---
Fair enough.
---
Botters are unaffected.
---
It's people who do not have 100% attention gate scout alts and perfect reaction to new signatures who are screwed.
---
Upwell introduces a structure that replaces the Concord router, and only works for members of the access list, but displays all ships in system.
---
Umadbro
---
Then it's the perfect time to reduce anom spawns and force them to spread out
---
And that's somehow worse than what they're doing now, which is incentivizing empire building at a null-wide scale? You know what that's gotten them? 4% player retention. I think it's time to try something else.
---
you should try monster hunter, it's a better dauntless.
---
I have no idea what a Super or a Rat is, nothing more than a fireworks show was happening nearby.  If there was an invisible fleet firing invisible, silent projectiles at another invisbile fleet, that would be the only way something was going on.  But then again the ships would've appeared on the HUD somewhere.
---
I play solo, I don't know 99.99999% of what EVE has to offer.  90% of the video is me mining Veldspar, it was a joke video.
---
Why do jump freighter pilots hate the Nomad? Why is it frowned upon to use it?

Hear Hear. i am tiping my hat to you good man.
---
I love you all. I'll come give you a hug with my pilgrim :D
---
TEST pilot, by the way.
---
Invention from T1 copies is faster
---
Agreed. Looking at my veteran characters, that's over 500m SP across all of them. It's like Bill Gates stopping to pick up a dollar on the street. Complete waste of time.
---
Asi se dice tio!
---
,
---
Yeah, you should see what I told the cute single mom that bailed on me last night
---
More caps in that post than in a goon staging citadel.
---
I know Reddit says nobody likes citadel spam, but they really meant NOBODY eh
---
Sounds like there is still time for retards like you to stfu.
---
That would mean having to interact with you "laying knowledge on people".
---
Similar to tipping?
---
And die to drones
---
Nullsec is about to loose local. Come hunt with us :D
---
Null is in kspace &gt;_&gt;
---
I mean. they want people to interact period, Having this forces that to be the case.
---
Did you know there's a tool called Dscan?  
---
god forbid you don't get to AFK rat.
---
No, I mean just go there to fight Provi, as well as the invaders. Don’t want to Blue anyone and lose half your targets
---
Everyone in nullsec already doesn't undock. Soooo you're saying it will cause more of the same?
---
Adapt.
---
YOUR MY FUCKING IDOL MAN I LOVE YOU AND I VOTED FOR YOU FOR CSM YOUR FUCKEN RIGHT FUCK FRAT
---
No, I was disagreeing with you. The power came from the fear of the act, so this will make them far less powerful.
---
So you bounce a safe to next anom
---
Nope
---
Even as a sub I can't imagine getting off on consensual PvP, like, sometimes you just need a good assblasting to remind you of your place, ya know?
---
Link me on zkill where high sec loses more than null sec on the daily. I'll wait.
---
Laughs in wormholer.
---
"too easy"?????
---
what universe do you even live in lol.  Blopsing is pretty much dead dude. Super hunting is down, carrier ganking in most regions is nowhere where it used to be and even killing VNI's is a pain in the ass.  
---
learn to dscan
---
When was the last time you tried a new alt from the beginning? I've done the whole start over thing multiple times over the years and treating the new alt as my main and effectively pretending all my other accounts didn't exist. I just don't see the justification in needing years of training to be able to fly all the doctrines out there when I've seen retarded monkeys fly supers that couldn't find the F1 key.
---
yah yeah should be  tipping  i will edit it
---
No. We just win Eve. CCP loses.
---
if not,now maybe they will:)
---
Yeah the cyno is hard to beat.
---
LOOKS LIKE MEAT IS BACK ON THE MENU, BOYS!
---
thank you to the pilots who fall asleep inside their hydrostatic capsules making it easier for my brothers and sisters to violence your boats during this seven day time cycle
---
this change will only make things more boring, there are two outcomes of this:
---
1. more gate boson titans b/c lol you can't tell the same bfg titan who bosoned 4 other fleets earlier that day is in local with you
---
2. your targets are going to greatly dissipate
---
That's it. Less targets, more titan bosons. Great changes all around!
---
If learning from one of the most experienced FCs in wormhole space, and a decade of fighting tooth in nail is a bad thing, then you wouldn't fit in anyways.
---
Just make cloak consume capacitor reaaallly slowly and have a minimum 5-10% capacitor requirement. You can still stay hidden forever if you are at the keys, and you can still catch guise who are afk cloaky given enough time and luck
---
Eve needs more people like you
---
I mean if people want to have wspace local why don't they go to wspace, why force this onto nullsec?
---
Also bots will just use alphas on the gate to watch for it. This affects real players more than bots.
---
This comment has aged excellently.
---
Btw*
---
No it won't, it will give them the additional power, once someone gets blown up that system is likely to be shut down for the rest of the day in terms of ratting or what not.
---
I mean what you described is pretty much what happened to Hard Knocks just without the cyno. The cyno just made it easy deploy. With drifters roaming about, I'd say it's still equal to WH space. But who's talking about PVE? PVP is still the same.
---
Sure 
---
https://youtu.be/3KquFZYi6L0
---
They could leave cloaking as-is as long as they balance it by making it so you can't actually do anything useful while cloaked... Maybe they could make an exception for a few specialized ships and let them warp or something...
---
I have noticed a lot of problems with Pyfa crashing in the more recent updates. Part of it I suppose is that I have over 3000 fits, if I type "Car" it has to parse out Caracal from other stuff and makes it choke some times. Usually I can't leave it open too long otherwise it crashes. 
---
(Windows 7 x64)
---
Now just need another way to farm in null-sec like drifter/triglav invasion/incursion/FOB and we're good   
---
afk-farm in anom was boring anyway
---
WTF just happened.
---
So, require people to say hello when they hit local and the first person that doesn't isn't allied? I mean, that's the turbo work around. As far as one week of fuel, that's pretty heinous. The game is a game meant to be fun, artificially putting in things that make a game like work doesn't make people want to play it more.
---
It's interesting. Systems based on improving the skills you use mostly went out of style after 2000. Elder Scrolls and Gothic are the only games that pop into mind after that.
---
They will. Indexes can be seen on the map so they KNOW someone is there.
---
Also NPC kills in 24 can indicate which TZ the inhabitants are playing
---
Why would they do that? They cant fight anything because of cyno.
---
You say tedious I say valid.
---
RL breaks can be more than week honestly, especially for me, just howl ife goes sometimes.  Saying not to own that much in a citadel is not really feasible for Nullsec, or enjoyable for that matter.  Logistics is already a big part of this game, not having asset safety just makes it frankly awful.
---
When I lived in a big block, that happened maybe a few times a week. You can always counter drop.
---
But I really want you to
---
How do you outplay a ton of carriers with a cruiser?
---
Right, got it. You can't back up your bullshit statement. Thanks for the admission.
---
Nullsechnaya Shloupen and Darwinism.
---
No, because there is counterplay to that, aggression timers, etc. You can keep a pilot in space by continually re-agressing it (people do this for example with Corvettes in highsec ganks), you can camp their logoff spot, etc. 
---
Asset safety there's no counterplay. You kill their stuff, they get it back.
---
For now.
---
Fuck it I'm resubbing.
---
You really cant always counter drop, and im not sure what your actual drop point is aiming at as that seems to really prove my point more?
---
Ive been considering resubbing but this sounds like something that's gonna make people less interested in null sec and making PvP (ganking) opportunities much less... I'll wait it out a bit I think
---
ITT: Welcome force recon overlords.
---
Why force recon and not combat recon?
---
your\*
---
Ok bye
---
If not being able to have supers is the draw of wormholes how is not being able to make them a deal breaker? lmoa
---
The salt on the official forums is amazing. I just hope ccp doesn't change their minds due to blow back from null bears.
---
Well I logged in, paid off my pirate sec, and now i gotta find some training wheels. Bc I’m a tad lost on where everything else and such haha
---
Map stats are delayed.
---
Happy cake day

---
You mean we can finally go back to a time where losses are meaningful and upshipping to make heavily outnumbered scenarios workable may return? A world where literally everyone cannot afford a faction battleship doctrine?
---
Jita....
---
Also look at ant mer report... Tge forge is top region for destroyed
---
Somehow I think we’ll all figure it out. Maybe some more ratters die, sounds like fun to me.
---
And you think that the second situation will somehow magically stop happening?
---
just use fleets of recons lol. dont appear until you are on grid
---
It hurts people way more than botters, so the value of ISK accumulated by botters will rise, and they are basically buffed.
---
Honestly, is CODE so stupid?
---
The kind of arrogance that would let me dismiss people as "spodbrain" when they make a point I don't have a good answer to?
---
Do tell me more.
---
Lol 
---
Is this going how you planned?
---
So one system is dangerous vs. null. Got it. That's your argument. Woo boy the rest of High sec is so scary! Brave people living there.
---
nobody undocked to take advantage of it because everyone that could was busy trying not to let their region get reinforced.
---
Krabs will run a cloaky scout on a gate and/or Krab on anoms &gt; 15km from the local gates under the assumption that roaming solo hunters can't be assed to check all of them and that big packs will be called out in Intel channels.
---
There will be a brief Krab hunt Bonanza followed by people wondering how up to date the dotlan pve numbers are.
---
T2 salvage prices may suffer if too many Krabs change income streams.  
---
Hauling PI around a (Goon/Horde/Test) constellation will be panic inducing.
---
I. Can't. Wait.
---
Part and parcel of being a low-barrier-to-entry newbie alliance.  Eve's retention rate means groups like Brave, Horde, and KF will always be carrying a ton of players that tried Eve and left but haven't been purged yet.
---
would they? npc stations can't be shot and don't generate any timer you need to turn up for.
---
Nulification is pretty handy though, i imagine well see lots more bubbles and possibly more gate camps in the future :p
---
It's "tooth and nail", friend.
---
Bloc Nullseccer here - I'm fucking hyped, and the salt is fantastic.
---
Make Null Great Again™
---
it's not that good.
---
it's not a bad game, but it's nothing special. definitely not good enough to justify all the cock sucking it gets on the internet.
---
the only people being caught in even ratting caps are actual retards or bots. literally you have entire intel networks that give you minutes to press the warp button without risking death now.
---
I would say almost none of the systems we've jumped in have Alpha's sitting on gates, that would not be isk efficient.  
---
Local is a broken mechanic to begin with and this is a decent way to test the impacts on EVE, players, activity, economy...ec
---
Which? I'm waiting for a day on zkill when all of High sec loses more than all of null. The general statement that high sec is dangerous is silly. The whole game is dangerous if you play like a potato. It's also ALL safe if you aren't an idiot.
---
ron was having the time of his life because he's a masochist.  the rest of the channel was being heroes whackamoling shit they didn't want to be dealing with.
---
No one complained because they had passive moongoo funding it all.
---
Nowadays, welllll...
---
Interestingly, while the odds of catching an active ratter/miner has just gone up significantly, the amount of potential targets that will now be unsubbed may well decrease significantly as a response.   
---
As someone who spends about 20% of play time doing PVE just to fund PVP (mostly large fleet) activity, there is no remaining aspect of the game that is enjoyable enough to me, that can maintain the cost of PVP. Naturally, I may not be able to maintain interest in playing *at all,* now that the play style I've crafted for myself will likely become financially unsustainable.  
---
Maybe there'll be a huge flood of returning players to fill the void. I just have my doubts.
---
&gt;And yeah... Botters gonna be mad.
---
So in true immoral fashion, CCP allegedly outsourced bot purging to players!
---
So... these new alliances are failing the turing test?
---
Bye bye Eve. Fundamental disagreement on this.
---
And no, you can't have my stuff. It can help clog up the servers until they shut.
---
Without some sort of srs nerf to cloak/cyno/jump mechanics no one will undock loot piñatas when a fleet of bombers worth half as much can jump around and project its massive deeps without any warning.
---
Next week. Apparently all the curses are being bought out in jita
---
You as a new player aren't being told any of that.
---
Nullsec isn't a new player area.
---
Can i still have your stuff ?
---
if there is anything left for you to hunt.
---
Krab whining lmao
---
How did you ever survive random out of nowhere player attacks?
---
Because I ducked up :p
---
I know , it is just such a pain to get all those decryptors
---
THE ABSOLUTE MADMEN
---
Big groups will manage thanks to numbers. Smaller people will die out
---
well this is one way to kill your game.
---
Make EVE great again
---
No, it isn't. Find an item on your overview of type "pulverized asteroid" and tell me it doesn't tractor it up.
---
HOLY SHIT. CCP really is going all in
---
I was against this at first but if they are actually fleshing this out rather than just having some ships shooting shield timers, than bring on the blackout. This is going to be fun
---
Learn to Dscan. I've run nullsec missions in highly populated areas and never lost a ship. Not a single blue in sight.
---
I haven't played in a few years, but that was always the risk. 
---
An indy moving through low sec is a low risk high reward kill. Grab someone (hopefully) moving a lot of expensive items that wont shoot back? Easy money. Maybe your next few ships for pvp are financed. Maybe it is empty but it's not like it was going to shoot back. You could run into some people looking to gank some indys or a fleet setting a trap for another fleet and just end up being a target of opportunity.
---
one more reason not to log in.
---
Do it yourself. This isn't null sec. I don't have to do a fucking thing for a salty little bitch boi.
---
Nope, not at all.
---
From Mittens with salt?
---
that just makes this so much more delicious
---
Then why are you complaining so loudly?
---
It's a shake up. See where it goes. I highly doubt this will make Null Sec safer.
---
Yeah sounds pretty exciting. First truly interesting change in 3 years. 
---
Next stop, supercap rebalance.
---
People will learn the hard way
---
My 'theory' is the chat servers get migrated from the data center in Bombay to the cheaper one in Kalkuta and this no local thingy is a nifty way to not have to perma apologize for possible outages. ;)
---
I know honey, I know.
---
You sound pretty salty amigo...
---
1/10 lol didn't read reaction
---
thanks slowpoke
---
unironically star citizen 🤣
---
Good thing drifters shoots bubbles eh?
---
So much nope.
---
Yeah like imagine if the drifters dropped blueprints for the op tech that they're mechanics have
---
All the krabs unsubbing for the month would be healthy for the economy. There is currently a massive material surplus and isk has been progressively more inflated.
---
I think people are mostly just babies.
---
Don't like nullsec being dangerous.
---
By all the complaining, this will not result in a bigger blue donut. The large coalitions are virtually all acting as if they can't possibly continue to hold their current space, much less more.
---
When the other party can bring maybe 1-2 other caps they could be the equivalent of supers - well without the doomsday ofc.   
---
But as I said - NS is an equal opportunity area - both the defenders and the attacker can escalate as much as they can take. There's no mass limits, you respawn at your citadel when podded and can get back in the fight etc.
---
Honestly dude I run with a .5 corp that mines in a system with an ice belt and tons of moons. The only ships we use are orcas and procs and skiffs. Using the non tanky ships is just asking for people to come fuck your day up. We actively encourage people who do not have a lot of disposable isk to not use rets and covs and their t2 variants because theyre not easily replaced until youve hit a certain amount of reliable income. And even in null when I lived in Provi if you were in a squishy mining ship you were on your own.
---
Nice deflect, good try though. I'm happy as hell to see all the nully tears !
---
That's fair. If that's what happens I just deploy to faction warfare.
---
ah typo, thank you for pointing it out.
---
Thanks for understanding sweetie
---
Yea great way to break the game more sub cap doomsdays!
---
Nice deflect, good try though. I'm happy as hell to see all the carebear tears.
---
Despite what you might think, this is actually good for the game.
---
Looks like you had fun. Come back soon.
---
Unsubbed already. Lol. Saves me a around a grand a year. Holiday! 🥰🥰 Thanks CCP
---
BLOP-drop? BLOP-drop! BLOP-drop!!!
---
There will be. You guys will log off for a little while to try to play it out and hope it will work and make CCP backpedal. After a while though, you'll log back in.
---
Procs/Skiffs are dangerous, other miners are not. Check out Wingspan's torpedo delivery guide, I've committed about every crime described in there at least once to confirm "yes, if he says it's engageable it probably is".
---
(✿◕‿◕✿) I really like that you're continuing the logical progression of invasion's story even with community backlash. People complain about NPCs doing stuff to their same castles, but then a game without "any" NPCs like fo76 was a failure.
---
Injectors.
---
Wouldn't this make it significantly harder to detect bots?
---
They'll give us start date 48h in advance, and end date is still unknown as well.
---
That's my worry. It's just another change which is preferentially worse for small organisations and not so bad for the big alliances.
---
...PI will be interesting for a while yes. Might as well dangerzone it.
---
&gt;carebear
---
I think you may be using that term incorrectly. 😂
---
Hail Mary for a dying game.
---
&gt; CCP does 1 thing
---
THANKS MANZ YOU JUST FIXED THE GAME
---
let's wait for them to y'know, actually iterate and work on stuff over time
---
This is the worst thing that CCP has ever done.   Goons and other large entities will set up watches at all gates and automate the Intel process. Smaller entities will not have the ability.LOCAL was a balancing force.
---
Sorry😂
---
just bring back local as region chat
---
It's your alliance Intel channel, unfueled Astra on every gate that you can have an alt watch. You have everything you need already.
---
And yet you have proven that thinking isn't exactly your thing...
---
What are you even saying? There's no "Ore Type" that's Pulverized Ore. And even looking at the description of some of the Ores I have in my inventory there isn't even "Pulverized Ore" in it. 
---
So I'm just wondering now if you're trolling.
---
ITT: People who never read summit minutes
---
Nah like the warping and travel tech not the offensive capabilities
---
You do know that hunters like to hunt other hunters too, right? 
---
And nullsec is already empty as fuck. This could at least force the big blocks to concentrate in smaller areas, where they can both defend more easily, and be hunted more easily.
---
Look, when I'm about to take a longer break in wh, I just take as many ships in a cap as I can, ship stuff out that I don't think I'll use etc. Some of my mates repackage stuff and log off in a freighter etc. To each his own.   
---
I say if you want that kind of security, there's plenty of other space to use - from hs to npc null - player owned nullsec is for people that log in (on average) more than once a week, imo, not some place to log off safely in your citadel. The removal of stations was a step in this direction, removing asset safety is just the other shoe dropping.
---
Oh shit, you just got slammed by a guy that actually put in some effort to make you look like a fool. 
---
So you had a bad day plays softly in the background.
---
Only for smaller ships tho cause an insta warping bs would be op
---
this is fucking awesome!

* Interbus Announces Review of Border Transport Services as Invasions Increase Risks\`

---
Except there will be no players in those anoms to spread out, because we're all unsubbed. Except bots, but they'll have 100% attention gate scouts and perfect reaction to new sigs... oh wait, it's the kremlin's paid troll again, explaining to him is pointless as he's completely retarded. I'll save that explaining effort for someone who has more IQ than room space.
---
?? Cheers pal
---
Just like init was brave and took on the biggest wormhole eviction of all time by themselves and totally not with goons. Real dangerous venture, right?
---
I'm sorry, did I miss where you backed up your mouth and linked a day high sec lost more than null sec?
---
I didn't know bumblebees could vomit human diarrhea
---
i will keep playing but form what ive been seeing people before this was announced  where already leaving  so your probably gonna lose a lot off the easy targets, the weak ratters and miners  that don't want to deal with this stuff
---
Will you donate your stuff to me please?
---
I wouldn't mind if they added a structure to turn local chat on similar to current flex gates/cynos/inhibs. Keep making changes that hurt bunching up (Like the anom respawn changes) to prevent everyone from moving to the groups with a blanket of local structures. Either the krabs lose money and stay safe or spread out and give up some safety.
---
I guess they'll continue not undocking until they lose their space, then?
---
I'm saying that's how they will solve, alphas in pods.
---
Also this is an awful way to test it, groups will adapt over time and hunters will lose effectiveness. This means during this test you lose players who don't like this change but gain hunters, and then in 6 months when targets dry up you lose hunters. We already know how this works anyways because wspace has this and people barely use wspace.
---
I'm having fun dragging you spodbrain ass all over Reddit. This is big laughs for me.
---
Randomly reminding someone in INIT that you are salty about Rage is like a surprise gift. Thanks!
---
"I'm not crying my group is big and strong we can handle it"
---
every time, never fails.  fuck I love you nullbears
---
Adapt or die. I guess in this case give up.
---
Woohoo... I have missed that sense of danger for soooooo long. Omg i can't wait to go roaming again. I say that as a super ratter and rorq multi boxxer... This is fucking awesome!!
---
About what???
---
No, just survive. Duh. lol.andsave money
---
Highsec citadels could be hit and drifters could warp into missions like they do anoms now. Means no highsec missions or mining.
---
Ooh nice, wait what do curses do?
---
Ah ok.
---
...and it would make your life as a hunter easier for a few hours (at most) until groups found and set up alternatives that weren't hosted by CCP.
---
Ever heard of covert ops cloak, a force recon, or a covert cyno? Because without local, any ratting ship below a battleship will just die to the roaming covert/nulli Lokis that like running around null. Battleships will get hotdropped with absolutely no way to counter because one second there is nothing and the next there is a bunch of bombers. Miners will die to both of these. 
---
All pve will be pushed into carriers that have an umbrella on standby and rorquals. New players who can’t do either of those will have to just do exploration for isk, and if every subcap pilot starts doing exploration the profits on it will plummet. 
---
There’s just no staying safe from cynos and cloakies.
---
Who knows but it was in some of the Korean salt in local
---
I will concede that you in fact have taken too much of my time while not backing up a single thing you said. I will therefore agree to accept that you are full of shit. Good day High Seccer.
---
Honestly with no local, they could leave the big 3 anoms alone and just get rid of all the others so there's less to scan through.  Make like 10 slots that are high mid or low tier anoms depending on the upgrade level
---
&gt;null-sec, we'll have two extremely active null regions
---
Yup, because the scramble for Africa V2 wont happen. Nobody would see all that free space and try to colonize it. Nope. Nobody
---
i agree that ppl are mostly just babies but im tryna actually do pvp stuff not deal with the random yet persistent drifter bashing.
---
mechanics that inhib small gang pvp are retarded and thats what this is doing. why support that, just because it makes other people mad?
---
if your having fun just because someone else isnt, your brain is wrong.
---
I disagree that null sec should be only for those who log in more than once a week as RL takes precedent in all cases.  I just disagree with that premise at it's core.  And I dont think though that it should be completely safe which is why I advocate for a higher cost of the asset safety transfer ( like 10% more).  That would also introduce more of a direct ISK sink in the game.
---
Happily accepting donations of isk and ships!
---
We wont miss ya
---
So looks like you found your answer.
---
You have not found anything in space that is "pulverized asteroid" have you?
---
If it's a structure we'll just get back to this Empire snoozefest we're in right now. Nullbears already have ample tools at their disposal.
---
Imagine wasting a few hours every day chasing down npcs and blapping them with citadel guns or a corm fleet when you had planned on doing a pvp fleet. 
---
That is why
---
So the people I work with to secure our space doesn't count as interacting? You didn't answer why make nullsec into something that already exists?
---
Drifters fragging bots and krabs, local being hindered in null, and darkside returning....is EVE finally getting better again!?
---
&gt;High Seccer
---
Ohhh shit 
---
Swing and a BIG miss. 😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣
---
I don't see any problems here.
---
AZY !!! JE FAIS CHAUFFER LES BLACK OPS ET LES BOMBERS !!! RANAFOUT’ !!!!
---
Are you a fucking idiot? 
---
How do you mine ore? Do you pet it softly asking for it to come out of the rock?
---
Why do you think Asteroids explode? 
---
Is there "Pulverized" anywhere in Eve in regards to Ore? Not that I've seen yet. 
---
I'm just curious why you're riding CCP's dick so hard.
---
You're not even trying. Lol
---
same fam
---
Exactly. That would already take out 90% of botters.
---
But whatever this discussion is right now... i suggest we just high 5 each other and wait and see what exactly ccp is planning. Any change to local is a good change so lets just hope this turns out as good as possible for everyone.
---
Hardly. Nullsec will adapt.
---
There will still be plenty of pvp to be had.
---
Yeah already happens in Cobalt Edge. Look for x Upton in every system in a pod using automated reporting. At least this will stop the 4X botting Rattlers in every system.
---
.. but that's it. The only potential upside to removing local is maybe, possibly making it more difficult to bot.
---
And that's okay with you? The removal of an existing mechanic for no actual benefit to players outside of the slight chance of seeing less bots?
---
This has a negative impact on more players than it has a positive impact on, and it's something CCP latched onto because a very tiny, but vocal minority kept spouting off nonsense about how this one thing would fix all our issues.
---
So what happens when it doesn't? It gives CCP just another reason to completely ignore players, because our "most requested change" didn't actually make the game better.
---
Poi
---
Like literally the exact opposite of this
---
remove ships
---
Playing the long game for the win
---
Dude.
---
You said "it doesn't tractor pulverized asteroids" and now have told me "there are no pulverized asteroids."
---
Get your story straight.
---
Either it doesn't pull them, or they don't exist. It can't be both.
---
By what, 15 or 30 minutes?
---
and even like that you post a reply so who is the faggot ?¿???¿?
---
They're recons (t2 cruisers) that cannot be D-Scanned. 
---
They're also vicious with neuts and an all around badass blingy ship.
---
All my blings are stashed in hi sec cause you never know when it could all get sucked into the void. I have cheapo T1s in null.  Helps not owning any caps too.
---
All right, but I am talking about your typical alliance space, where blues don't shoot you and if a non-blue shows up you dock your ISK making ships. Highsec and Providence with its NRDS are a different thing entirely.
---
None of these changes will make a difference until CCP finally addresses the largest uncontrolled ISK faucet that is PROJECT DISCOVERY.
---
&gt;(✿◕‿◕✿)
---
You have great timing and i hope you have a lovely time this summer, you should check out the steam summer sale for little indie games this year, perfect time killers
---
That line of logic only works under the premise of implying that CCP could 'fix' anything by implementing cynos into WHs. There is no good answer to someone claiming the earth is flat - they need only be dismissed.
---
Are they suffering a lot from drifter attacks? Honestly curious if these small groups are feeling the burn out.
---
Ooh nice
---
Good, let's make it really dangerous and unpredictable CCP.
---
Let's make drifters do the same on hi-sec and low-sec, maybe let them destroy stations and out people assets in danger. 
---
Is it enough?
---
Not having local doesnt mean your space isnt secured, it just means you need to tab out of netflix, turn off near2, and pay attention to the video game you are playing.
---
Want to grind anoms on the cheap? Use a dual rep, reactive, cap stable dominix. Get yourself a point and a heavy neut, so if you get tackled hey look you can kill/neut the tackle and fuck off, or if you arent a coward then stay on grid and fight, while alerting your friends there are roamer kills to be had.
---
No. Lol
---
wasnt sure if troll or stupid but then i saw your name. damn alt right nazis are taking over this game. i saw this guy, emperor god trump in amarr fw, fuck that guy. 
---
and fuck you too. i bet your him too
---
How many citadels have they actually killed?
---
No cyno, mass limits, varying connections, system effects... there's still a bunch of differences between null and wspace.
---
Are you as fat as your capital letters if you play so much?
---
10/10, laughed way more than I should have.
---
Minitru coming through with a good soundtrack for the invasion
---
it doesn't exist, there are no gates in wormholes.  there are no system effects in nullsec, even with no local the two environments are vastly different
---
you're equating a single similarity as making them the same thing, and it makes you look dumb
---
So try pressing cancel as it says right there?
---
Let's be honest. 
---
That's like 25% of ratters. 
---
The rest don't give a shit or are retarded. They do nothing but rat and mine. They haven't logged into mumble in months if not years. They deserve to die in a fire. Let NC bar and PamFam pummel the retards. It's all they're capable of doing anyways.
---
No one knows you're there....
---
So how things could change...
---
1) Very large systems (size wise) will start getting used more. Why? - someone jumps/login in (WH, gate, 'cloaky' login). They dscan. Nothing. They warp to 'far part of space' DScan.. nothing. Rinse until bored or perhaps they find someone. 
---
2) Gate huggers. A pilot hangs around the gate and waits for gate fire. That would be fun..... Paint dry... Taxes... Grass grow.. (anons already pop to give you an idea if a WH could have popped, so that hasn't changed.
---
3) Small miners 'relatively' safe. There's a lot of open space out there. If you're out of dscan range of gate(s), see #1. Would a small POS help here (in NPC space)?
---
i would let the drifters kill all the structures and just place new ones when the "event/Invasion" is over.
---
Says the guy with Near2 installed.
---
eww I cant high five a gewn pet!
---
JKJK
---
Lets see how this all plays out space fren
---
I mean. I live in wormholes so local is a moot point most of the time for me. CCP does changes that greatly impact one group versus another.
---
Disgusting ships really
---
i support this. Let us all have our subs end and win eve.
---
You mean goons 95% of the time with a local. So nothing changes, copy.
---
You're not even wrong.
---
As compared to all the structures that GSOL have to fuel, transport, etc which are of course fun?
---
The real question is, sell my plex or buy more?
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
Wait. If your suitonia.. then whos...?
---
God I wish they could blackout your posting
---
yOu TaLkEd AbOuT sOmEtHiNg, ThAt MeAnS yOu ArE sAlTy
---
Guess that explains this thread then.
---
Oh that makes perfect sense. Though that does mean the game is more dangerous for super casuals like me. It definitely adds a new dynamic!
---
I stopped playing Eve a few years ago, if this change sticks I'll sign up again. 
---
I enjoyed wormhole space for that sense of blindness and null for the drama of the wars - both in and out of game.
---
The thought of null having some of the edge of wormhole space, for me at least, is rather attractive.
---
Cue nullblock leaders demanding their players do not log in during July to make player count drop, in the hope they can force CCP to change their mind.
---
I too, am extraordinarily humble.
---
yes! bring back blops gameplay!
---
You just skill injected yourself into a Kleenex box
---
I'll believe it when the drifters actually fight the triglavs in high sec. Or, at least, starting burning down the structures in high sec.
---
Drifter esi disruption. Lmao...kidding
---
Great post, we seriously need to get back to the "oh fuck I'm undocked, shit's gonna happen!" that made EVE the great game it is/was.
---
It's almost as if there is more to do in eve-online that orbit a haven while watching Netflix and docking up when Near2 goes off.
---
This  [u/Bamisaur](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bamisaur/) guy is looking for an argument. Regardless, the action the sentence in question is "takes the work out of looting", emphasis "looting". It loots. You can't loot an asteroid
---
More fights? How you figure?
---
This is why you're either really young, or a complete fucking idiot. 
---
&gt;pulverize verb  
---
&gt;pul·​ver·​ize | \\ ˈpəl-və-ˌrīz  \\  
---
&gt;pulverized; pulverizing  
---
&gt;Definition of pulverize  
---
&gt;transitive verb  
---
&gt;1 : to reduce (as by crushing, beating, or grinding) to very small particles : ATOMIZE  
---
&gt;pulverize rock  
---
&gt;2 : ANNIHILATE, DEMOLISH  
---
&gt;intransitive verb  
---
&gt;: to become pulverized
---
If you had to be an adult for a second and think about what they might mean by, "Pulverized" Ore- What would you guess? 
---
&gt;The mobile tractoring unit takes some of the work out of looting the scorched ruins left by capsuleers, be it pulverized asteroids, wrecked ships, or obliterated inhabitation modules of various kinds. Once it has been deployed and completed its automatic activation process, it will lock on to any containers or wrecks within range, reel them in one by one, and empty their contents into its own cargo bay. All the capsuleer needs to do is keep up the pace of destruction.
---
* Every "wrecked ship" isn't just labeled as a "wrecked ship", they're a "Caldari Frigate Wreck". Meaning that you saying, "Pulverized Ore" isn't anything. Well hey dumb shit, "Wrecked Ships" aren't anything either. And you arguing what you are implies that if MTU's didn't suck up ships like they were supposed to, that it makes sense since it doesn't list the "type of ship" it just lists "wrecked ship". 
---
* It will lock onto containers, which is besides the point. It specifically says Pulverized Asteroid and it doesn't take a fucking scientist to figure out that Pulverized anything are small bits of *whatever* left. If you "Pulverized" a block of cheese, you fucked that block of cheese up. 
---
Additional Note: Fuck you, I don't have to calm down when you don't have basic human intelligence.
---
You mean my stuff is at risk in null sec? But CCP I was promised safety with goons! Boohoo. Learn to dscan,
---
&gt;Time to burn nullsec boys!
---
LET NULLSEC BURN! DEATH TO THE FALSE MITTANI! BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!
---
There's a lot of random responses here about surviving the attack that happens, but the best survival tactic is always prevention. Scout networks will become much more valuable. That's what we used to do in WHs. Keep eyes on your in Gates and you'll be mostly fine. The occasional cloaky camper who logins will exist, but that's part of the game.
---
That's kind of the point though, right? The idea behind wormholes is that they're different.
---
Local has been in the game for a long, long time. It can't be the cause of the most recent issues with the game, or even the cause of older issues because it's been around a lot longer than they have. Getting rid of it just increases the barrier to entry for null -- keeping more players out or pushing more players into the larger alliances that really don't need to get bigger than they already are.
---
To be fair there are large portions of highsec, nullsec, lowsec and wspace that are very quiet and incredibly safe.    
---
[Destruction value by region - May 2019 MER](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/694Tk2cOswDRFkDuO7BIKf/dff612c7adcf710ba1dc2df5c6d3ca1c/2_destruction.value.by.region_bar.png) Of the top 10 most dangerous regions, only 4 of them are nullsec (also roughly 39.5% weighted for isk).    
---
Say you argue that ISK values are an unfair metric. Let's look at # of kills as a metric for those same 10 regions. Empire: [24,047](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000002/stats/)+[19,182](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000033/stats/)+[9,498](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000043/stats/)+[9,239](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000016/stats/)+[17,343](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000069/stats/)+[12,901](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000042/stats/) vs Nullsec: [17,125](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000060/stats/)+[26,159](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000005/stats/)+[13,352](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000061/stats/)+[6,476](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000055/stats/) = 68163 vs 63112    
---
You are free to compare all of highsec vs all of nullsec with your own data but zkill doesn't have a filter for that afaik.
---
Highsec should not be completely safe (this is EVE after all) but there's something wrong when you're getting comparable levels of 'danger' between the 'casual' and 'hardmode' parts of the game.
---
With all the tears coming up, I can expect a large increase in the number of oceanic planets.
---
umm CURRRRATOR IS PRIMARY ?
---
No, but I can hope as people might not be as jumpy since they can see who is in local. Might make it alittle more fun.
---
Is that a CSM answer or a random player answer?
---
No one ever really "quits" EVE. It's an indefinite hiatus.
---
I kinda like “driffers”
---
if you put 500 plex in your cargohold your ship is invincible and you mine the double amount.
---
Yep and also the local chat was used an intel Chan to report « non blue player » in the area :)
---
Wouldn't be very covert. In fact that would be a Nerf to covert cynos if they were detected off grid.
---
The problem is CCP is trying multiple new things at once.  Which makes it extremely difficult to figure out which change or combination of changes actually caused the observed effects.
---
"We took out local and spawned tons of drifters.  Lots of bots died, and bounty payouts went down by 10%".
---
Now, which change was actually responsible for those?  Can't tell.
---
And which aspect of which change? - the folks who didn't rat because they were gunning citadels during their ratting time, or didn't rat because they died/were too scared?
---
There's a reason in a properly-designed experiment you limit the differences between your control and your test(s).
---
Or rat in a super carrier which all the hunters will also cry about. Everything this event has done has just encouraged people to rat in caps or supers.
---
Just plant reject null alliances and force them to mine moons to stay ez isk
---
Doubt it... maybe in null... Local is essential for most players...
---
Your job is to heal right now.  If you heal well, life is good. If you rush  things and heal poorly, it stretches everything out much longer.
---
You're salty because you can't understand the discussion?
---
Limit one per system, zero timer bash.
---
Y not use just space for Dscan?
---
By all means, rat in capitals.
---
may MER had this to say, top 10 pvp regions, only 4 null
---
Good response. My overall point is and was to call bullshit on the thought process that null sec is safe. Stuff dies everywhere every day. Any change made to game mechanics doesn't change human nature to learn, evolve and grow with changes. One of those traits is tribalism. Game mechanics won't change that.
---
Holy shit it's real.
---
I have never considered losing eve more than I am right now
---
I find it really funny that here people are like "hell yeah ccp" and on the Eve forums people are like "yup i'm winning eve and biomassing" lmao
---
Ok so why do we need the no local? Or if in lore why can't the people who own the systems control it. There is no justified out of game reason for this. CCP already knows how nullsec responds when local broke and that was by not playing.
---
Yeah, border defense sounds reasonable.
---
Local instantly advertising when your borders are breached, is not reasonable.
---
Yeah umm you really don't need to worry about that, when you're in local with a guy named @nalL0v3r69 nothing else stands out.
---
Content pings wont be 10 jumps out by choice they will be more emergency than anything else. Whlers know the panic you feel when you hear 
---
DREAD TACKLED 5A (static wh)
---
Also since you dont know how many there are you will get more escalations
---
i'm just so happy, more happy about any game ever i think, with all the drama i was scared for the future of eve since i've been back, this shows ccp can adapt, this is great, local has been deleted, it happened
---
make a 10-12 character string of random English syllables
---
so not ssdddsssffgh or xzcsfdsscd or something, use vowels every third letter or so
---
like it or not, ganks create smallgang fights
---
So why do we need no local? Haven't we already seen how nullsec will respond? They won't play and hunters won't find the easy kills they dream of. Bonus the safest way to rat is supers under an umbrella so I guess test and goons are fine.
---
Hmmm maybe. Man Up? We live in WH for ages. Make the silence your Ally, not your enemy.
---
On silence you Will ear. You realice that you are not alone. Bob's love is with us all. His anger is only to carebears. They will no more, as they die under his holy knights, what you K-Space bears know as "drifters"
---
Good enough for you.
---
Make sure the name begins with an "A" for a good time.
---
Look at this man vocalizing complaints about reeing
---
REEEEEEEE
---
Holy shit, this is gonna be amazing!
---
Well done CCP, that's some badass attitude I wasn't actually expecting at this point. WELL. FUCKING. DONE.
---
o7
---
Nah, they'll just move to lowsec or highsec if they have a lower appetite for risk.
---
Not sure. Stopped using it a long time ago because basically useless.
---
Literally does not matter. Although lists are often sorted alphabetically, so if your name starts with an A you might get called a primary target in fleet fights.
---
Really? I might do that. I bought some 10k plex. Gonna try that today.
---
...
---
the point is talking in local is discouraged in wh space, obviously there are other chat channels but none of them are as dynamic as local. Eve is about people, its like an IRC with a weird spaceship game in the background.
---
Obviously as one of goons prominent krabs your opinion is largely tainted.
---
And as I stated earlier I don't think it will make roaming viable due to the boson gate titans which I think should be done away with as it primarily eliminates content. 
---
There will certainly be less crabs in null sec after this change. Maybe they quit? I hope they just go to hi-sec. The point is this will add an element of danger to null-sec that has been missing for 3-4 years. 
---
The current state of the game has completely driven away most daily content creators (the ones that make eve enjoyable daily and not just for 1 month out of 2 years) and the meta game content wars goons stockpiled 2 years of titans and supers for turned out to be garbage that nobody except the most indocrinated spodbrained goon enjoyed.
---
Afk ratting Superbloc members: " But you don't understand this is bad for SMALL GROUPS!!!11!!11!!! DON'T LEY CCP DO THIS!!"
---
Thanks! Having a hard time with the two name thing because I’ve been so used to one name characters in other games.
---
Do you think those will be free kills to your roaming wolfpax? Or will you just get dropped by supers and haw dreads from null bloc umbrellas?
---
People with a lower appetite for risk will be able to move to lowsec or highsec. Part of the biggest problem with nullsec right now is that there are 40k+ toons living in a single region. I'm all for reducing that.
---
How can you never forget something already forgotten?
---
upvoting b333n flair.... it's a special occasion
---
sounds fantastic.
---
we want our presence unknown because the prey runs away
---
r/eveporn/
---
That will be amazing!! So now you have to be dscannig and war probbing not to get ganked!! But I doubt it... EVE is getting more and more interesting now!!
---
This is a shit post, right? "Hey, we're CCP, and while we're hard at work and you're out enjoying summer, we would just like to cause some extra annoyance with your few people still playing!"
---
sounds awesome
---
If he doesn’t play your way he’s doing it wrong huh
---
Me neither. I mean you can pretty much facetank and kill them with one rorq.
---
I went to have a looksee. That's useful information. I'd be interested to see what the breakdown is on a day to day of H/L/N.
---
Yeah Brave is totally useless. Drifters are exposing your inability to survive.
---
I cant expect much to have changed since I was there, Im sure your PvP numbers are still miserable, Im sure you still struggle to remember your own timers, Im sure you struggle to get people into expensive ships and have people invest sp and isk into fleets, im sure theres still more people in impass than in your pvp fleets. 
---
The fact that GE- currently has half a dozen SF structures, a miniature alliance that you've been unable to dislocate from your own fucking staging for months? years? is a testament to your inability to cope with anything. 
---
It has nothing to do with drifters, and everything with your alliance being garbage.
---
Almost like they're going to need dedicated scanners
---
Agreed, this is amazing. And all the salt is even better.
---
P.S. I'm gonna be undocking my NS ratting alt for this, bring it bitches, let's make things blow up!
---
"surely this will destroy Eve online.... surely"
---
I love it, CCP spends years shitting on every other play style and people sat silently by, now they're fucking with the Anom runners and its JUST TOO MUCH CCP YOU'RE KILLING THE GAME.
---
Nobody cares, but maybe this life lesson will stick with you, when you see people in power taking things from the people around you, step up and support the victims, because in time, they'll always turn their attention to you and what you have next.
---
First they came for.....and now theres no one left to speak for you.
---
Very cool!
---
sheesh, Wh'er BTW.  "barely" use Wspace is a slight understatement.  Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong.  Only time will tell but it might give CCP a more accurate picture of actual players and activity levels.
---
&gt;Why would this encourage small blocks to move to null
---
How would you know how many dudes to bring to bash a structure? How many are you comfortable bringing with driggers out and about. How do you know how many dudes are in someone's region without local? What if they're staging in another system and they out form you? 
---
Seems decently safe to me
---
Or 48 hours to dock up and go outside or do something else for bit. At least the smart ones.
---
Because roams can't fight other roams.  I bet you enjoy quail hunting.
---
That's the EVE spirit! 
---
HTFU!
---
Agreed, this sounds like the "natural" development of all this weird amazing shit going on.
---
I so want to try out a facemelt DPS cloaky proteus now
---
LOL that will be hilarious!! And fun to watch what will change in the player strategy... to avoid being ganked...
---
Just an alert message from the structure, not a warpable, and as I said "at most". I don't even like that, personally, but a "hey your buddy's getting hosed" might lead to stupid warpins and more feed.
---
Praise our Lord and Savior Seddow for those dank frags ^(that i missed because i was sleeping) .
---
She actually didn't even see him because local has been shutdown.
---
&gt; iterate
---
https://evewho.com/pilot/Iteration+Is+Key
---
I've played both, they're both unique in their own way
---
They have very specifically stated that Null is too safe and secure, and that they intend to remedy that directly because they'd rather do too much than watch it stagnate more. 
---
Like he was directly asked about it at EVE DOWN UNDER and gave that specific response, its kinda funny to see all of you now like 'WOAH THERE BUD, FEELING UNSAFE OVER HERE'.  
---
They know, thats the whole point.
---
Eve: A/B Test is my favorite eve expansion so far
---
You must not have roamed around Tenal and the northern areas where all of the NC. and the like rat, pretty sure the "25%" figure would be VERY generous for that area.
---
Man, you are so fucking retarded that it's almost painfull.
---
Have you ever considered going back to SA forums and never posting here again?
---
Moot point... only an idiot would cloak afk without local.
---
Sorry Brother i can't see the local so i miss your reply.
---
Sure you will have some indication that activity is going on based on index but its a ton of effort to go to a low populated area. You are not going to see the same kind of cloaky campers or pre-staged caps devoting themselves to these areas. You might see a lot more pico gang and solo pvpers.
---
Can I haz your stuff ?
---
Oh I don't mind that. I get some ratter kills and maybe we'll see a rise in small gang shenanigans depending how it works. I suspect it will mostly be gank warfare, sadly, with reliable connections meaning the same over-scaled response fleets will come out to counter any roaming small gangs. It will become easier for fast warping stuff or cloaky stuff to lose pursuit. These are all good things.
---
It will take a change in the people, a change in courage, to get gudfites, sadly.
---
I was recently in Tribute. 
---
But makes sense.
---
A little bit of column A, a littlr bit of column B, just as it should be.
---
You hit one, your friend Jim in Scary WH People hits another on the other aide of delve, Todd from [lowsec pirate group] hits a third... Eventually they'll accumulate too much fatigue, and wont be able to respond to every timer.
---
Wormholers in particular should be wetting themselves in glee right now
---
I'm not looking for an argument, was just hoping half the Eve population weren't fucking idiots. 
---
You're picking and choosing which parts of the description you use. I'm using all of it. You're using part of it. 
---
You can't loot an asteroid, but you can sure as fuck mine it. 
---
You can't loot the pieces outside of the Cargo Hold of a ship, but you can sure af use the MTU on it and it'll salvage it for you. 
---
I mean why is it hard to grasp that the description is poorly written and should be changed to match what it actually does. 
---
It literally does nothing with Ore unless you jettison it out of your ship. And then it's not fucking with Ore, it's fucking with containers. 
---
The descriptions aren't flavor text. I mean Jesus dude, I've only played the game for less than 2 weeks and I can already tell that.
---
Agreed. A lot of people will simply take a break though, or quit all together.
---
delete this
---
True.
---
I really love CCP right now
---
I think you're mistaking game and subs.
---
Will the game die because of it ? How the fuck should I know.
---
Will they lose subs because of it ? For sure.
---
People say that about literally every change they don't like.
---
Reddit: There's bots fuckin everywhere
---
CCP: I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move
---
Reddit has never been a place they announce things to. The Scope publishes to YouTube, then gets added to Eve website (must go in that order or else no one can watch the linked video).
---
Lol, that's literally the forums right now. So accurate
---
Litterally went from telling everyone that I'm going to take an break to subbing an additional account and telling all my friends that have quit to come back.
---
What the fuck happened to you? Since when did you become a worst poster than the brute moron that is OP?
---
Pretty sure doing these grind NPC missions for faction that are not fun or compelling qualifies.
---
Even worse! I created a bot to create a machine to create this post. :(
---
have u ever considered there might be a reason nobody lives in wormholes
---
Well asset safety and local are going offline getting a potentially temporary rollback so I think a gigantic burn/loot nullsec roam is in order.
---
Defending stations is going to be a hell of a lot harder now that you've got to move and safeguard your stash of shit... wooohoooo!
---
Nullsec is about to get a hell of a lot more fun! Prepare your buttholes shit's gonna get freaky!
---
I highly recommend flying a ninja looter through nullsec in the coming days there's gonna be shitloads of isk to be made!
---
Even under umbrellas rorqs will be vulnerable, and supers are aids af to rat in unless you bot.
---
I really dont care i take the challanges as they come but i do like what is being done so far :)
---
Demanding. As if people would actually do that if they don't want to. The numbers will drop dramatically though, correct.
---
WORMHOLERS. BTW.
---
You sir are one of the good ones. A true EvE online mentality.
---
Please spread you message amongst your null friends. It's not about win/lose 
---
It's about the joy of the fight.
---
Tip of the cap to you good sir.
---
Noone gives a fuck about your nationality.
---
And I'm enjoying all the tears we see on reddit, but this post is far more lame than that.
---
You realise that most null players had alts in high sec in the past, to run level 4 missions.  This was before the current anom system, when belt ratting and belt mining were the only PvE.
---
I've started just roaming because all the fleet pvp is dead right now and haven't been using local on purpose. I like this in a way, I hope it makes people more paranoid. Eve needs more paranoia. I worry though about the disproportionate effect on smaller groups though. Maybe they'll be ok, maybe they'll go to lowsec, maybe they'll fold into larger groups. We shall see. Net positive though, I think.
---
More of this attitude please:)
---
This is part of a hysteria campaign from CCP... ruffling the feathers in Null, scaring some in High, Sancha invasions... The threats from the empire alliances to burn hisec...  but in reality, few times has EVE been more exciting... and I guess Local will stay... Maybe there will be some Disrupted Status for Local under some circumstances... but if Local goes, a new strategy to keep safe will emerge and there will be YouTube videos, chats and more fun!!
---
I've in almost all the big nullblocs, from my experience it was very rare for anyone to speak in local unless it was a warning of incoming enemies, gf, shit talking as they pass through system or someone quickly saying hi. Majority of the chat is done on coms and corp/alliance chats. I think you're really overstating how many people actually talk in local in null.
---
Yup, I mean we've seen some changes that hit us hard and forced CCP to course correct immediately. The lurch hic change for example was the first one. 
---
Basically the response was "Sorry, wormholers are collateral damage" due to the removal of the mass reduction with HIC bubbles. Thankfully they made a quick alteration. 
---
Part of me thinks would be a way to introduce the intel structures into Null sov that were discussed nearly 3 to 4 years ago. 
---
Not saying the outrage at the change isn't warranted, I get it.
---
While people are distracted by the Triglavians and the Drifters it's a power grab chance for smaller threats. 
---
New Eden is a powder keg about to explode.
---
After the first five kegs were consumed.
---
All the big blocks will squish into their own tighter super cap umbrella ball. The rest of null will be like lowsec.
---
I've just understood your comment. Apparently it's my reddit accounts birthday
---
Well, if they need local there's always low-sec
---
😂,
---
Upvote from me for the sensible chuckle.
---
Kendoll!
---
Goodbye, you won't be missed
---
With intel. Intel we could actually gather, and respond to. I've yet to see players materialize in system with no prior warning, and then arrive on grid without ever appearing in local, on dscan, or in the probe window. Any further questions?
---
Hey hey
---
Inb4 bots running low level combat sites in combat recons.
---
The Homer Simpson way. I hate bots, but this I aprove.
---
&gt;he does null roams and will benefit from no local.
---
yea its gonna be super fucking great moving through the 30 systems that 0 other people are in every roam that you have to thoroughly dscan now
---
nah these people are lazy and want the best anom's  and ore.  they would just stop play probly,
---
lost of whiners here.
---
Mmmm driffers make me horny
---
Confirmed this is undetectable by CCP's \~elite\~ anti-bot detection. 
---
100% safe to use. 
---
Sorry that the cat is out of the bag.
---
Do you have any idea how many times I've tackled people in delve and had fleet of titans dropped on my forehead? I absolutely do want null to be dangerous. I want the ability for smallgangs to make a difference and be able to kill shit again. The fact is that Drifters are the only things that are now able to do this, and it's pathetic.
---
Hopefully the newly announced changes will help us a lot.
---
I'm so excited.
---
Come to Lowsec, noone here, completely dead, nothing wrong can happen to you.
---
This gun be good!
---
I am preparing for weeks full of bot hunting fleets. 😎
---
except every time local died is was an orgy of kills in nullsec so no you're wrong
---
o god o frick someone warn CCP
---
Come on dude no one is doing that when you can web the anchor and blap toot
---
Yup. I'm all good with that.
---
It's gonna have to be something other than a Curse  😂

---
Time to gatecamp the ways in and out of delve again
---
It's not quite reasonable to draw a direct comparison to WH since holes have the safety of combat probes showing up on short Dscan, which gives warning on the order of tens of seconds rather then the 4-5 seconds of an Arazu point of 2 seconds of a bomber point. Also no cynos so ganks by covops cloak ships aren't nearly as scary, as covops ships are quite killable in a 1v1. Then there's the matter of isk/hour difference between ratting and sleeper sites.
---
I'm not saying no local Null can't work, or that I'm not in favor of no local null, but rather the experience will be quite shit and isk/hour garbage if no local goes live with no other changes and you aren't ratting in a super.
---
I don't really want cynos in w-space you goof; allowing power projection would wreck everything that makes it worthwhile.  What I'm satirising is the low-effort, low-value poo-flinging from Wormholers who think that chanting "we have no local it's fine you spodbrains" is making some kind of useful point, while ignoring the huge gaping differences between w-space and sov 0.0
---
i think only ccp has such info also out of the 4, 2 of them are active warzones detorid and tenerifis. Active warzones have inflated numbers due to conflict whereas in delve/geminate its regular pvp
---
You can also blue scout 
---
It’s a sad state lol
---
I don't like role-playing in eve though
---
So no safety against players and no safety against insta kill NPCs, what should a player use nullsec for now?
---
When null-sec pve ers stop logging on who will these "pvpers" that ccp is catering to fight? the other pvpers they try so hard to avoid?
---
Let them return to ratting. I'm sure Bombers Bar and all those NPSI fleets will have some fun!!!
---
oh boy keep pouring that salt... i just wanted to say... why remove local ?? LMAO !!
---
Spoken like someone who has never wielded that sort of power, or understands the burden and responsibility that comes with it.
---
Sorry, dude.  I'm just here for fun, not responsibility.
---
Except time will give ccp an incomplete picture. If this is only done for a couple weeks you gain hunters but lose ratters. But if this goes long enough and enough ratters either disappear or create a new way of being safe you then lose your hunters, and it's unlikely for previous ratters to come back because ccp showed how they feel about them.
---
LOWLANDS, LOWLANDS AWAAAAAY
---
Hunter will dscan for wrecks.
---
Eve players are talented in so many ways.
---
Zkill says they got a fully fit Astra and an athanor in the last 7 days. Also got a few captials as well. Fuck caps and their risk adverse umbrellas. There's way too many of them
---
Thank you :) that's the fucking point
---
I'm legit going to start playing again. I love some of these aggressive proposed changes
---
thanks for continuing this thread even though i stopped playing years ago friend (◕‿◕✿)
---
friendship will always be the best ship (✿◠‿◠)
---
Maybe mods can remove the double post please. Phone app decided to make it look as though it was not submitting so I spammed that "Post" button...
---
Mmmmmmm bitch more I love the salty flavor I can't get enough of it
---
Just for shits and giggles, it'd be hilarious if the Triglavians (who everyone seems to have forgotten about recently), start popping up in J-space and make the local there reappear.  
---
(If they've got the power to make your ship translate the system name into triangle-ese, who knows?)
---
Hence the call from small gang FC's far and wide, "Kill the fucking Curse!"
---
Leave cynos alone, buff inhibitors and give that effect as a script for HICs.
---
Local cloak, best cloak
---
I think it'd be great of we got rid of the standalone sov mechanics and instead bundled them with structures.
---
Establish all sov and sov benefits through "flagship" citadels, allow system upgrades/utilities through citadel modules (like active local pinging), and add a cap that either directly or indirectly stops structure spamming.
---
The benefits structures provide would give players a reason to shoot them, even with asset safety in place.
---
14 years playing this game I never look up people in local, i never even pay attention to the channel and haven't for a while.
---
Theres a frat rag that DD's a lot on gates, no clue what his name is and no real desire to look him up, I'll deal with him when I find him.
---
You may also find that just a different kind of people decide to play eve.
---
Big Bill tears are really the best tears.
---
Exactly. No safety against players. That's the point. If you want to live in null sec you should be capable of responding to threats. Right now NSers don't interact with roaming groups - they just warp off, or log off. 
---
This is a great change for the health of the game.
---
You'll get a Venture that Honorreable Tard Party deserves.
---
&gt;  Or will you just get dropped by supers and haw dreads from null bloc umbrellas?
---
How is this different from right now
---
Yeah... until they look at my killboard, and see an embarassing 460m Vaga loss to an equally embarrassing NPC.
---
But, good point, otherwise.
---
I have one of those multi-button mice and moved the d-scan hotkey to my thumb.
---
I'm willing to take the risk and try this out. They can always add local back if this doesn't work.
---
The same thing as they used it for before, its just dangerous now.  If danger isn't your thing theres a whole section of the game to cater specifically to those who hate danger, its called High Security Space.
---
If you don't mind danger, and the increased rewards that come from living in it, then 0.0 is the place for you.
---
So, nullsec is no longer worth the risk.
---
Fucking hell, upvoting Grath. What has the world come to.
---
Can't speak for Darwinism but we own very few structures as goons form 4x our numbers to kill them so we're having a great time
---
He probably lost his stuff when the drifters found him.
---
Ah, so you have heard of me.
---
&gt;with a strict 1 account per player policy
---
I will find a way for me and my 200 alts ;)
---
Nah
---
You're good with everybody having a level 4 mission alt in high sec rather than actually living in null?  Are you a high sec pubbie or something?  You don't have a clue do you.
---
1. Got all the ships I need for probably the next 10 years already. And guess what, we can make our own in the wormhole if needed.
---
2. I dont care if I fly and kill cheap ships or not. I simply enjoy pvp and it doesnt matter what ships I fly as long as I get to pvp.
---
3. not humanly possible. 
---
4. Well, thats kinda how things are already.
---
5. Bots are hard to kill anyways, so not much will change.
---
6. great, bring it on.
---
7. Hopefully CCP will act even harder then.
---
8. Ever heard of Wormholes ;)
---
Triple post :/ rip dude.
---
YES BEST UPDATE EVER REMOVE LOCAL EVERYWHERE
---
Stainguy has always been a closet nullbear knob gobbler. He also loves trying to project every perceived nullsec nerf onto lowsec or wormholes by making terrible posts.
---
"Small guys will die, big guys survive" is just typical nullbear purse clutching propaganda when a nerf to their nearly riskfree playstyle pops up.
---
Holy shit. CCP devs have found their balls. They are massive. Made of steel.
---
Imagine being so salty that you create a song begging for ccp to nerf drifters. Besides the no loot thing, drifters have done in one week what would have taken a decade for players to do. 
---
Get stronger drifters.
---
this day, my 4 year old asked "how similar is a person to that star ship dad?" he was pointing to the Rorq while watching this video during snack time.
---
# "Eve Online • Shipsizevideo" by "Eve Outtakes"
---
No way did i do triple... Fuck... Im getting vanned aint i?
---
Found it, Near2. So you join a few intel channels, can then set how many jumps out you want to be notified.
---
Oh, but I have. It's fun. Who do you think decided that we were moving to Delve in the first place?
---
But there is no God.
---
Local will be back, but you have to pay monthly for it
---
You need to really ask yourself in that regard, why you are in nullsec.
---
If you are only interested in completing pve activities whilst completely safe from risk, you are probably in the wrong space, or, in the wrong game.
---
The fact that we don't have standings with the Triglavians (good or bad), but we've had plenty of opportunities to rack up negative standings with the Drifters, makes me think that we're more likely to blue the Trigs.  The whole *prove the direction of our flow* thing from the Trig video makes me think that's what this is all ultimately leading up to.
---
Oh no risk, I can't play with risk :(
---
RIP sleeper social club :(
---
No they're not. The local changes aren't in yet, plenty of time to stop the Drifter event before they are.
---
And hope the curse doesn't have snakes, Quafe and the other speed drug  (overclocker?) because oh boy do they go fast
---
Local chat was a fundamental issue with eve online that fucked up the risk/reward system in all of eve, now that it's gone/will be gone/will hopefully be gone
---
we can finally balance the game properlyq
---

Anamake is probably the best place for someone who wants to be left alone to go.
---
You’re retarded. There won’t be more fights, just more dunks and more empty space. High sec will be the only thing with action soon
---
Ugh.... buying another month to give it a shot again. I WANT to love eve so much but I can never get into it lol
---
There are some new Sansha SKINs that are visible, but don't appear to have dropped yet.  Wondering if their involvement in whatever is going on is going to be tied to that.
---
 HAHAHA, nice!
---
Bombers are too powerful. There's no reason a 60 Mill isk ship should be able to kill a 6bill isk ship that also has an invuln button and can be remote repped by triage.
---
Make people keep stuff online, if the structure was low-power at first reinforcement, no asset safety.
---
Good guesses, it's actually a "trash answer".
---
Nope. Not alt right or a Nazi. Nice logical fallacy though.
---
Were 256 in fleet

---
My EVE life in a nutshell
---
Heavy assault Rook
---
If you take drifter behaviour out of the context of the 4 years since they've been introduced then yea, that seems like a good conclusion.
---
But if you account for drifter behaviour over time, high class wormhole drifter behaviour and ccps hands off approach in terms of shaping meta-gameplay in eve over the last decade, i don't think it is a fair assumption.  
---
I think further proof for that is the scope video they released, drifters simply are the lore explanation for the blackout event.
---
The point I'm trying to make: even the people from gate should NOT show on local unless it got target locked (a type of noticing it's identity, also a way to get away with cloaked afk/bot observer since they don't know who came through thus cannot report). Otherwise people can just spam 40km bubbles and warp to it to observe their prey when they see someone entered local. The defense should be totally proactive.
---
You assume there will be anything to hunt.   Krabs are risk adverse, and likely won't undock anything bigger Than a stabbed vni in response to this.
---
He's not in the CSM anymore. Thank fuck.
---
Your reading comprehension is bad. You keep saying pulverized ore when the description says pulverized asteroids.
---
Find some pulverized asteroids in space and tell me the mtu doesn't pull them.
---
Like I said, your interpretation is wrong.
---
It doesn't take a youngin or a complete idiot to recognize that.
---
Assuming anyone remembers what it is.
---
People can say a ton about me, a lot of it negative, and a lot of it true.
---
I chose my words very carefully, even my greatest enemies say i'm a good experienced FC.  I've been FCing for almost a decade in both FW and high class wormhole space.
---
I'm pretty trash, but i'm experienced at being trash :D
---
It's a suspected fact. Not a complaint.
---
What?
---
Thats me, I bought them all and the talisman sets to go along with them...
---
Well they will now.
---
So wish granted.
---
Remov tether, allow entosising services, game is fixed
---
Good. Players like you add nothing. Take on risk or fuck right off
---
Blood for the bob god soldier.
---
Join us and see them burn.
---
well whs are hard, I get that - ns would be like lightweight-whs in terms of time commitment.
---
"The duration of this blackout is undetermined, and we’ll be monitoring what effect this has on the cluster. "
---
We won't know end date before it starts it seems
---
Cyno up, jump to Tackled McHelRatter with 50 boson titans.
---
Adapt or Die mofos. Your words.
---
Chester, having to learn a decade of incorrect and bad knowledge from you would be nothing but a punishment for anyone involved.
---
You don't want any risk while out in space and cloaked? Pussy.
---
Yes i did watch the video and read the announcement, it is pretty obvious now that their goal was to create the lore excuse to perform a test to see what happens to null with no local, my assumptions were based on the information i had available to me, and have changed when new information presented itself.
---
And what I'm saying, is that you're a fucking idiot if you don't see how "Pulverized Asteroid" isn't anything in Eve- Yet you only have small fragments of asteroids... If you... What is that thing people do for money around Asteroid Belts? That's right. Mine. 
---
Yet again, you're just proving- Like all the others have, that you're a complete fucking moron.
---
I dont mind local being removed, but I am not too fond of the d-scan mechanic and wish they introduce something of an alternative that doesnt provide as much heads up intel as local does but neither requires you to spam a radar button repeatedly. I am sure there is a sensible middleground here.
---
unsubbing
---
I heard that the developers are going to delete local chat channel?  Did I misread the comments?  How will I help the new players in Cistuvaert and Clellinon without local chat then?  :(
---
Why don't you just delete them yourself?
---
You mean Tritanium?
---
Curse is force recon though right?
---
Not combat recon.
---
This still could delay them.
---
They might see wrecks from old sites that may somewhat line up with active sites.
---
To all of the small gang and pvp hunters cheering this move:  
---
What do you think the natural consequences of this will be?  
---
There's been much complaining about consolidation and capital umbrellas.  Do you think a lack of local, or maybe some infrastructure that brings it back with a cost, will cause more or less consolidation?  
---
Players will continue to move towards larger groups for protection, and the capital umbrellas will grow larger and more pervasive.  You won't be able to tackle anything larger than a T1 cruiser without a cyno being lit.  
---
Smaller alliances that don't have a substantial capital umbrella will disappear, subsumed by the larger organizations that can offer instant hotdrop safety.  
---
A substantial portion of the industrialists that CCP worked so hard to kick out of empire and into null will simply stop logging in.  They may return if/when new structures with new mechanics are introduced, or they may not.  
---
I don't see great improvement here.  I see a company flailing about with desperation changes.  Combine that with CCP's historical tendency to ignore potential unintended consequences, even when they are pointed out beforehand, and I smell disaster.
---
The standard "structure under attack" notification. Nothing else.
---
Doesn't really matter. All fallouts go by first 3 anyway.
---
Have you considered not having 3000 fits?
---
Cacique is the hero we all need
---
I haven't done an anomaly since 2012. The point is we worked as a team to make this area safe and help our alliance mates. That's what we are playing this game for, the ability to build an empire and CCP has decided to dismantle these empires.
---
Yeah that. "Hey somebody lit somewhere"
---
"YEAH I KNOW I'M FUCKING DEAD"
---
What risk?
---
I actually pay a dollar an hour to play when I'm playing seriously.
---
My computer can sort of run eve for basic shit, but if I want to triple box, I go to a pcbang and play for 1,250원 an hour
---
Local for omegas, or 100 plex for 30 days.
---
So you're against the change?
---
Well the fuel is actually part of the lore. Page 60 of the book of eve 
---
"The Azbel- Wuthrich experiment used a very similar setup as the ancient Aspect experiment, and it was a historical moment when the first Smiley :-) was sent over this channel. Following that, a great gold-rush started on who would be the first to industrialize this.
---
The result of that rush is the familiar Fluid router, which forms the building block of universal communication as we know it today."
---
There's a whole 5 page story about ftl communications, in the lore liquid helium was used.
---
I think they are removing local because they broke something and that God awful ancient coding has part of local tied up in what they need to fix.  So rather than admit they fucked something up they are rolling it out as  a feature.
---
You seem to missed the drifters since you stopped playing this game. There is no safety against those besides getting larger ships. We worked as a team to make this space safer and ccp has decided we are to good at working as a team, what about when we come up with a way of protecting ourselves again and ccp decides to nerf that again. Why should players try to build anything when ccp will continue to reduce that.
---
please send me your stuff
---
Then why are you complaining? Sounds like everything will be fine.
---
That is the point, I don't understand why hunters think there will be a new a target rich environment.
---
In Jita
---
Lol you can do that now but it doesnt happen. How does removing local make that more of a chance?
---
I gave up on roaming nullsec because I either got bobbed or blueballed
---
Who cares if bears in null stop playing? Trim the fat. Do we think CCP will actually shut off the server if player counts drop to a certain point? Why do we care about player scarcity? No local in null...bears leave the game. Null sec alliances will find a new equilibrium in terms of number of alliances and number of people in those alliances. They actually meaningfully interact with each other instead of the current situation of bears who hate pvp and hunters who get frustrated at instant intel.
---
&gt;people like us in goons, Test, FRAT, maybe Horde and DeadCo will deal with it just fine 
---
&gt;What this really does is nukes all the other groups in the game attempting to establish themselves in 0.0
---
Phe at least all those little guys have goons, test frat and horde to selfishly look out for their best interest
---
Happens to wormholers all the time. if you sign on to play eve, you sign on to losing everything you own. You consent to pvp when you undock. People come back to the game after having lost all their shit all the time, and still keep playing. If you're not gonna play eve cause you lost some spaceships, you shouldn't be here in the first place.
---
And staging won't change, really at all. Again, those citadels in delve aren't going anywhere. You'll still need forward staging citadels, except with no asset safety, your offensive capital fleet is actually at risk when it's docked in the citadel. Although, you seem to be totally ignoring the timer situation. Even if your staging citadel gets reffed, you still have until the final timer to evac all your shit. All those caps have jump drives, they're comically easy to get out of the citadel unless you're 100% bubblecamped the entire time. And if the 1DQ keepstar is 100% hostile bubbled 24 hours a day, y'all are done anyways, so kiss those caps goodbye.
---
There will eventually be balance. You'll lose aot of ratters and miners in null. Then the gankers will get mad they have to find fights and not just ratting ships
---
Kicked out the pirates? Advocating for the reduction of pirate anoms based on activity?
---
Then for you and your group nothing changes.
---
Yes why remove local? You haven't given a reason it should be removed, alliances have worked to make their space safe and that makes other players made who havent put in the same effort.
---
&gt;and don't undock
---
Then they lose structures to drifters?
---
My favorite thing about CODE is their ability to generate carebear salt without even mentioning mining permits.
---
You missed the other half of that post.
---
What I see no local causing is not seeing when locla dreadbomb logs in.
---
Yup, it's a whole lot better than everyone having half a dozen rorqual alts with 2 supers and a fax ready to jump in to save themselves.
---
remove armor timer from non keepstars
---
add stront bay to citadels
---
Man... how rude to say that when I can still hear an echo of something you used to tell everyone else... there it is again, faint: "adapt".
---
But don't you worry mate, some good dudes will be coming back over this to make up for the loss.
---
Yes also that.
---
Get rid of this . Only lazy pussies want no local and automatic dscan
---
I can't wait for drifter attacks in Jita.
---
Lol people having been reeeeeeing for local to be removed for years. The grass isnt always greener on the other side. I personally am dreading scanning every system to find out if anyone is even online yet alone undocked....
---
It isnt so much about being lazy. It's about some braindead shit. You dont have to spam a button to refresh overview either now do you?
---
I personally haven't done an anomaly but other people have, and we work as a team to secure our space. CCP seems to have decided we are to good at this and want to reduce that, so what happens when we solve this change? Are they going to keep changing things? If that's the case why bother trying to work as a team when ccp clearly doesn't want that.
---
I don't know, nor fucking care, who you are or about you moving your glass dildo collection to Delve.  So I hope that was a rhetorical question.
---
The only reason I'm still talking to you, is I am waiting for you to explain what I was attempting to "justify", and why it was "elaborate".
---
&gt; Krabs will run a cloaky scout on a gate and/or Krab on anoms &gt; 15km from the local gates under the assumption that roaming solo hunters can't be assed to check all of them and that big packs will be called out in Intel channels.
---
Most krabs will be too lazy to do that. A lot will get caught and die.
---
big alliances will just change and have cloaked alts on every gate
---
Funny thing about dreadbombs -- the dreads have to be stored somewhere, and that list of somewheres is a pretty short list, given the relatively short jump ranges involved. Also, funnily enough, stations have a list of characters that are docked therein, even with no local.
---
Yeah, bro, that's a lot of effort. Easier to just stop playing altogether.
---
Umm, no...
---
Do you even Eve?
---
Just like normal then.
---
&gt;he's not on csm
---
&gt;still salty about Him being on csm
---
You clearly don't understand people come back to the game, especially people from before any potential change. If a player leaves eve and comes back to all their assets gone they won't continue to play and that's a lost subscription. And I never said those citadels would move, I said primary assets and markets will move to an NPC station. And yes forward citadels will be vulnerable but those don't have an abundance of assets and are populated by active players.

Wow, personal attacks is the best you can come up with.
---
I'm sorry that my clear explanation of your logical inadequacy hurt you so much, but it'll be okay.

It says pulverized asteroids, and you wrongly assumed that things not at all pulverized asteroids would be tractored up. It's okay to be wrong sometimes. Just look to the future where you can now run free with your new knowledge.

Those CCP updates just keep on giving
---
Name checks out.
---
People condensed because of groups making the game unplayable for those people. They didnt condense because of anom spawns. They arent all of a sudden going to spread out. This has been proved by rorqual mining spawns. Ore spawns are over 4 hours now. It did nothing to spread the miners out. They just waited it out.
---
Yeah, instead of someone watching local you got someone watching station guests
---
maybe stop sucking CCPs dick?
---
inb4 the event lasts for like a week or 2max and then everything goes back to normal after some scripted fight between Drifters and Triglavians...
---
In the meantime everyone jumps on CCPs dick less than 12 hours after nullsec local "disruptions" announced...
---
&gt;Id personally prefer
---
Most of the game wants fights and reasons to log in and fight. Want more fights? Get rid of asset safety.
---
Subbed you know, back in the game!
---
What an interesting concept, seems like I've heard this on r/eve before. Maybe I should add a new suggestion to the pot, lets significantly slow Concord response times in High Sec as well. And remove local from Low security too.
---
Completely. I’ll stick to exploration for now, but between this and the drifters they’re killing off all other subcap isk making. Meanwhile rorquals and supers in large alliances will be pretty safe, even if not quite as safe as they were before.
---
okay
---
So what does this mean?
---
Yes, they could totally stop the reason for the local changes before the local changes.  :eyeroll:
---
i love you bro and i know what you go tru something like that , for us  not so far ago  we have the internet  in cuba was ilegal not until a year ago  , were wifi parks before  and  you can see the people  setting on the streets  late times of night   , on the sidewalk oopening facebook, was hugue for us  back then  back then the hour was 4.50 dollar the hour  then etecsa  put it down  to 1.50  per hour and currently is 1 dollar per hour  so you put it into your etecsa nauta accoutn and then is when you have the internet  and that it is been my play style since i  meet eve  , i really spend a week dowloaiding  piece  by piece the game  took long but i really love eve and more the people that is why i enjoy it  is a pain in the ass  to just connect  but it is fun talk  with so many different people  
---
and is sad  just cause is been harder  the eve playstyle  people are saying  gonna leave it sad just because  some npc event lol  reason why i wrote the post 
---
but hey this is eve let go tru this and  kill eachother after this  cause we are eve players
---
Ive seen the drifters, and had to deal with them while hunting.
---
Also welcome to what the more cutting edge groups have had to deal with over the years.  We would master a strategy and its technique and use it to dominate a portion of the game, then CCP would come in and nerf that and we'd have to expand and rebuild using something new.  Over and over.
---
Welcome to the club, the rest of us have been dealing with it since the earliest days of the game.
---
No I did not.
---
Please, for the love of god CCP, **do not walk this back**. I don't care how much the GSM bitches at you, **stay the course**. This is **absolutely** a good thing for this game.

Tou dint PvP do you

Got older i guess

It's going to affect smaller groups a hell of a lot more than larger groups, so I don't know what the point of this ironic shitpost was.

Or you know CCP is working to prevent the servers from a slow death of stagnation.

A lot will just stop krabbing. Especially since this is temporary, it’s better to just wait it out rather than risk anything big.
---
People die now and there is litteraly no reason to unless ur unlucky as fuck (and I mean really unlucky).,Don't pay attention at all or awoxers.  I'm glad to see local die in a fire
---
You've been missing some prime drama.
---
Delve intel's gonna be relatively unaffected given how many people are watching gates though.
---
I like all of these results.
---
The mild AS allows for incentive to fight, as structures still drop loot, but not as drastic as w space, so there is still a bit of balance for both attackers and defenders. 
---
Also, allow dreads to bypass damage caps.
---
my V key is used to the amount of abuse i inflict upon it.

The ingame  map doesnt give out free intel on wormholes

They're calling it delayed but it is essentially opt-in.  You won't appear in local until you send a message in it.

"Cringe", says the one with a harry potter-themed tag next to their name.
---
They definitely don't have the balls to do that. Carebears lose their minds over a 500k isk ganked venture. Can you imagine the shitstorm if they put drifters in highsec?
---
So we should ignore the unstoppable unavoidable NPCs? And why should a team of a thousand people not be able to protect themselves from a group of 10?
---
Drifters appear to be pulling back but oh no they've done irreparable damage to the nullsec liquid fumigon array. Authorities fear the intel network may collapse at any moment.
---
I'm available to write more lore at competitive market rates.
---
I like small fights much better than large fleet engagements. They are less laggy and more heart pumping, but to say a fleet ganking a miner or vni creates small gang fights is disingenuous

Wormholes.
---
So you dont want fights you want to gank.
---
Just in case you are not being sassy... He is dicking with you fella! lol

All in all, welcome to EVE o7

Clearly the end of null as we know it.

Sounds pretty neat, just need to figure out where liquid ozone will go.

Nullsec carebears will have to learn how to use D-Scan.
---
Hope thats true!
---
Lmao yeah this is bait. Learn English if you want to haze nerds on the internet, otherwise your arguments are just bad memes
---
I help run a wh alliance. I've seen and helped, personally, dozens of people come back to the game after they lost literally all their assets in wh space. Your opinion is factually wrong. I can get you in touch with some of those folks if you really want. They love eve. Assets are just mechaincs they use to play the game.
---
And if you think that 1DQ market is gonna move to an npc station where you have to pay npc tax on all those transactions.... lmao. GL with that.
---
It says the blackout is during July. The implication is that it will be back in August
---
Well, there'll certainly be plenty of uncontested space for people to move into, making null more dynamic and less donut-y.
---
So now all it takes to end them is just a sneaky little girl with a fancy dagger.

You, sir, are asking the right questions. Updooted

Just make it so you can’t fit a cloak and cyno simultaneously. Or add a large spool up to cynos on cloaky ships.
---
you've been hiding in a wormhole for the last 2-3 years while boson bois been going rampant

you think we've never gotten fights over rorqs that are tackled and are gonna die w/o intervention?

Honestly hopefully yes they do keep changing things. Space right now is far too stagnant, safe predictable and boring.

If the status quo continues the game dies off as people grow bored and leave.

bro they try, they try so hard when we pop out (and ive been in here for 9 months). Plus i had to deal with DBRB and his fucking Levi before bosons were a thing, no sympathy for anybody else's plight.
---
This fucking frat rag is a worker, he's constantly out looking for somebody to ass fuck.

Lost what, the reading competition?

Undocking pve ship that is not a super under a cap umbrella was a risk.
---
But this is just literally becoming content, and I'm not paying for that. 
---
So I'll just let you idiots become each other's content and look at your tears later, while I play some real pvp game.
---
lmao that timing. smart man.
---
Fun drinking game: take a shot every time "Cyno should get a  spool-up time" is suggested
---
TIL that if you're born with a birth defect like congenital heart disease  you can't die from it, thanks for that
---
ding ding we got another one
---
&gt;Yes why remove local?
---
Because of bitches like you!
---
I mean you can rat in a curse okay I guess and it ruins tackle pretty hard with a rack o nootz.
---
Personally I'm going with "in soviet eso, ratter tackle you" if I ever bother to rat up my sec standings.
---
Well many people want to be able to roam in small ships and jump ratters or miners but felt like they couldn't effectively with local tour name shows up the same of someone wanted to mine that ore in null without people knowing he's there it allows more people to do stuff kill ships make money and have fun
---
CCP took a wrong turn adding skill injectors that can be used beyond 5-10m sp or just adding them in general.
---
yeah lets move that line further
---
Grrrifters
---
I mean I didn't see nullsec groups not doing anything, so not sure why that needed to change? Goons just finished a war and test was actively in a war until this started.
---
Haven't seen any tears yet. Most people seem excited. What is the deal with this desperate narrative lmao
---
so when are we able to cyno into wormholes?
---
Now we just have to get humanz to play eve again now that it's fixed.
---
Here's the thing. Nullsec gankers won't have adapted to this very well EITHER. I know the tricks of jspace but not all of them will. I don't have time to teach a whole alliance. I will be too busy feasting on tasty recons thinking they know what they're doing.
---
contact your doctor if you have an erection that lasts longer than four hours Eve's side effects are many and varied.  Blood pressure, dank soul, and elevated sodium chloride levels to name a few.
---
Just wait like a week until CCP pulls the plug on local then start hunting the idiots who don't know about the change. :D
---
Curses! I'm late to the party
---
So basically local will work like it was when it broke.  So now all those who wanted skillpoints for local broke no broke is new normal.  Oh and all you hunters out there.... People need to log in first.
---
contract your stuff to Risc Brubal please!
---
It's not going to help the Krabs too much being in a umbrellas without local. You can easily kill sub caps ratting and get out if you catch them by surprise even if they are active. I seen way too many people just don't go on coms, or do it too late, forget to be in fleet, have the response get there too late, or didn't fit cyno/not enough ozone. Intel won't help much cause they can't tell if you logged out, sneaked out, or are hunting without local. And botter are completely fucked.
---
The people bitching are the people that now have to put work into the game in order to do what they want.
---
Those are people who left eve knowing what happens to their assets, this would be people who left eve with the knowledge all their stuff would be where they either left it or asset saftied to lowsec. Changing that on those players easily will cause people to stay gone, CCP themselves said this.
---
Once Goons kicks you out for defying the Mittani's line, we're recruiting.
---
Damnit ccp I have schoolwork to do this weekend. But instead I’m gonna buy a vni or other krab ship, name it krabbosaurus Rex or use a native alliance members name and pounce on unsuspecting ratters and miners.
---
Are you talking about the alliance who chose to put 40 faction fortizars in a system already overly saturated with citadels in a region with over 50 keepstars? You're right, seems unfair.
---
Nope, because Pyfa straight-up does not work on Linux.
---
This is cool but overall seems like a low effort/desperate attempt to breathe some life into the game.
---
Too late, dick stuck in toaster from excitement. The good news is with my new colostomy bag I can sit in front of the computer and hunt people with no local for longer now :D
---
Can’t efficiently use 30 cloaky camping accounts without local flashing. Think those are the people most folks have a problem with anyways. Killing local takes away just as much free intel from them.
---
Personally love the change.
---
you act like every ship in null can cloak.
---
you counted the times someone mentioned "remove local" ??
---
If local get changed, cynos should also get changed.
---
I wouldnt classify rorquals as a gank. They have a invincible shield that allows time for a response. Mining ships, and ratters that dont stand a chance to fight back is a gank
---
A free kill is someone who doesn't shoot back. I'm not asking anyone to feed i'm asking them to fight, any subcap fleet could've won considering your numbers advantage. This was a cancerous gank at best and everything that's wrong with eve roaming pvp summed up into a nice 3 minutes.
---
Need cloaky though. Drifters will fuck you if you dont.
---
You can always login as alpha and contract your stuff to charity.
---
well get his name grath jeez I got some dreads nearby
---
All the ones that need to can. T3Cs and recons are going to be extremely common now, but at least recons aren’t nullified.
---
&gt;and likely won't undock anything bigger
---
So like every other day then eh?
---
Yeah i'm just hoping ccp escalates this even further.
---
Your argument was destroyed with logic, facts, reasoning, and ben shapiro, get rekt kiddo!
---
I hope Drifters come to WH space, personally. Unlike nullsexers, we enjoy a good challenge.
---
Ok.
---
Bro if you want to unsub then unsub. Noone gives a shit about your life story with Eve

Could be something not related to EvE. I blue screened yesterday while playing EvE. Logged back an to only have all my windows reset, not my overview settings, but just where the windows were.

Told my Corp in TS this morning that this is the nasty grape flavored medicine. Just take it and get over the taste.
---
u mad bro?
---
Welcome back.
---
This may happen at the start but players will learn and react to this. Not to mention not everything should be soloable. There is a big risk going into null and running into cloakers is a big one.
---
Your shit posting skills are epic and accurate. I wish eve online let us play audio to other players.
---
Without being sarcastic, why?
---
Dang I’m loving this 😍😍😍😍 😍 bots can’t read local now too. Now PVP is ACTUALLY gonna happen when u roam and such 💦💦💦
---
As a smalltime miner, no way Im undocking an exhumer or orca while local is down. I dont make enough to replace the losses.
---
The only people who will be able to undock are the ones that can tank for long enough until the save fleet arrives.
---
Aye that it is
---
Drifter pressure prioritizing and scaling to opposing alliance size should help.
---
All the pvpers don’t login anyway now
---
Watch it not work properly, and ends up fixing local.
---
Lol.
---
Nullsec becomes the true wild west. Recon ships become as valuable as titans
---
The drop in incoming materials will cause a spike in buying it so maybe
---
&gt;the relationship became somewhat toxic and pointless
---
About six months ago I wrote a many paragraphs long comment responding to a "what do veterans think about the current game" kind of post, explaining why I unsubbed nine accounts and quit. 
---
In seven words, you summarized it half a year later.
---
man you're a fucking dipshit if you don't think the removal of local is good for the game in general
---
there is no point in being the best in eve if everyone who opposed you quit
---
ding ding.... someone got arguments ? looks like that´s not the case...
---
This is Sparta?
---
Yup. Now just as dangerous as J space, but with about 1/4 the isk per hour. 
---
"Get fucked"
---
Stop, I can only get so erect.
---
Yep.  
---
More reason to rat with supers as well in a smaller geographical area (Under super umbrella)
---
Rat...light cyno when dreadbomb/very large fleet...destroy pissy little fleets.
---
Bandwidth limits sound like local delay
---
Great news. It’ll kick some people in the slats.
---
REEEEEE
---
CCP is too incompetent to fix local, so remove it as a "feature" this along with the amazingly lame invasion content one would think they are trying to bomb the game as quick as they can.
---
Krabs unsub, nuked taxes and rental fees from krabs, null gets fuckes out of their embargo on hi sec. Lmao
---
This may be good enough to make me return to the game.
---
&gt; then why did you assume who I was or wasn't in the first place?
---
Holy fuck, you are obtuse.
---
hahahaha... I think you need to re-read your OWN posts until you understand.
---
Local is safe mode. It means we will have to actually start using scouts and recon as its meant to be used.
---
This is reddit bud not cnbc
---
I don't understand, what shitstorm? Krabbers complaining on the forums is a shitstorm?
---
Great thing about this change is it would shit on hunters while keeping rorqs and ratting capitals completely safe. They can both easily tank the spool up time. Thumbs up from me, we need more people in capitals.
---
My official opinion on local: 
---
An isolated blanket nerf to local chat will make people dock, is bad. The design goal should be returning nullsec back to high risk/high reward environment it was once intended to be. RN null reward might just not be enough to justify risks, unless in an umbrella region, which means an even greater push toward umbrella regions.
---
A wider"null risk/reward balance pass" with nerfs to total available farm per region, buffs to isk/hr, counters to cynoes/umbrellas, and modifications to local chat can be good.
---

I'm the worst financial position of my life (divorces suck) but I'm willing to eat a bit less and resub an account if CCP means serious business and follows through. No kidding..
---
I like all of those options. 
---
Gives me more to do in each system instead of "2 in local, nothing on dscan, warping out gate"
---
Bro, did you ever play eve? I mean really play it? It doesn't sound like it. 
---
You are saying in this post that things are too hard for you now? Eve is supposed to be about adversity, struggle, strife paranoia, and conversely massive joy from overcoming these things.
---
So some rats pushed you out of null? Did the last few years make you fat and lazy? Or are you upset that you declared victory and now you're realizing it's not true.
---
Give your nuts a tug bud. 
---
Sell all your shit. 
---
Buy fighting shit and get your ass out there and get scrapping capsuleer!

I read it at first and was like noooo, that's a lie. They wouldn't do that. They don't have the balls. Had to read it like 3 times and check it wasn't a spoof site.
---
I think its going to have bigger repercussions than that
---
depends what you're flying
---
The idea to make chat regional was better
---
Lmao good luck
---
Like I said on the official forum. I'm happy to see this, if for no other reason than it means all these "delete local" theory crafters are going to see 1st hand why their idea doesn't work the way they think it will.
---
The adaptations people will make after a week or 2 of bad losses will make Null worse not better. It will be a repeat of the anon needs of 2011/12 that resulted not in more wars but in longer high incursion wait lists and lower  empire l.p. store value...
---
 And ccp will soon learn (again) that screwing around with the engine that drives eve online (null players are the most engaged players the game has) is a terribly bad idea. 
---
"Delete local" is a haters idea the same way "disable concord in high sec is". You can't crush a corner stone and then act surprised when the wall crumbles....
---
im new player, I have a question, most players in null pay their acconts with real money or produce enough isk to buy the necessary plex?
---
\&gt; Death toll from Drifter attacks in nullsec estimated to reach into eleven digit numbers   
---
seems a bit unrealistic imo, should have kept it to reasonable numbers like millions
---
my thoughts are im subbed till January. After that if this is the intended state that null should be wormholes on steroids with cap  hot drops in the mix. Kiss my subs good bye. Before you ask  last thing i will do is gate some blingy supers somewhere to be lost in fire  and mothball the rest so you cant have my stuff
---
This was on an anti-cap fit Fortizar.
---
I mean, that is one sentiment to have, my bet is if 5 or 6 thousand accounts get unsubbed that CCP will probably change their mind on this dumb shit.
---
Two weeks ago: I quit TAPI and head back to hi sec to win EVE because null life is biring

Hold on, what you just said is citadels were supposed to be like fozzie sov, and somehow that would make this better? Fozzie sov is cancer, and that is what I've been saying this whole time. I don't need you to explain to me what they were trying to accomplish with it, I know that already, what I've been saying is they did a shit job with it. Regardless of whether citadels are now more important, fozzie sov is bad and should be iterates on or, as you said, redesigned from the ground up. Having a good system in place is the first step to making sov as important as citadels.
---
♥ CCP
---
&gt; You've been missing some prime drama.
---
By not being in a goon pet alliance?
---
So one watcher or near2 bot can see even more?
---
I started around the same time as you (I was 19 though)... and I agree.  It was other players who made me learn the game, not bullshit tutorials or PVE content.  
---
The game really is like a toxic relationship... holy shit.
---
No not really i've been fingering my asshole rather then playing eve.
---
Yeah, everything is geared towards the promotion of more stuff blown up, more big stuff blown up and creating a harder environment to plex an account through play.   They want more subscription and cash plex purchases and will implement anything in any way to increase it, of course under the noble cause of “balance” and “addressing the concerns of the playerbase” or random unannounced “PVE”.  All of which is fine,  but undoes a lot of the unique aspects of Eve which resembled the real world in that your investment of time and capital and cooperation past a certain threshold yielded lasting benefits.  It almost feels like a slow, Eve-edition of “the best stuff you worked for(nullsec, caps, etc) will become shit in the new expansion”, except it’s just less meaningful instead of shit, and there isn’t any better shit to get.
---
You had me in the first half not gonna lie
---
That’s the way the ‘pros’ do it now.  Or they pick on 2-4 little guys, get a few drops, and then land on the ‘big fish’.  Smart theta FC (oxymoron?) have learned this trick a long time ago though.
---
Hahaha.
---
Ok. For real then.
---
Don't be afraid of changes. The day the game stop moving foward it Will die. People who adapt to this new season could make big Money, and small groups can make ninja villages deep on Null.
---
I mean I've been there since the LV campaign and its still pretty much the same, except we stamped out racism
---
It would require the hunters to risk something. Shiny t3c have no probleme to tank the spoolup. But a 40m bomber probably won't do the job. But maybe you can bring another hunter via covert cyno in and one of your hunters survive.. there would be a lot more involved in hunting then now
---
Bots that dock up whenever non-blue enters the region? Yes please

Well tbf a raped ass and a cake is better than just a raped ass.

mmmm cake
---
What remotely makes you think I don't know what pulverized means as an adjective?
---
My point is that pulverized is not being used as a general description of an asteroid as an object. Instead "pulverized asteroid" is the object the mtu pulls.
---
As of yet, you have not found a pulverized asteroid that it doesn't tractor in.
---
So yes, I responded correctly. It's right, but your interpretation is wrong.
---
Goon *sig,* tyvm
---
I love that I'm being downvoted by fucking retards.
---
The last time that null had no local, eves average playercount dropped like a fucking lead balloon and it wasn't the bots being logged off! since I hunted the shit out of them during that period.
---
yo I keep hearing about these tears but I'm not seeing there were are they
---
&gt;goons are such a economic powerhouse. All of the game will tremble at our might. 
---
&gt;doesnt cause any significant economic changes 
---
Oof
---
I hope this means more gate camps. As per that recent post from u/suitonia \- more gate camps hopefully leads to more fights/content.
---
Let the carebears cry and not login because their beloved local is missing.
---
It just means the people who willing to fight in these dangerous conditions can take it from them.
---
This shakeup to the whole meta has been needed for a long time.
---
It's a good thing we have a citadel on every gate. If you have to manually track roamers, might as well do it tethered.
---
Little guy in null here; really not a problem for us in the slightest. But good concern trolling!
---
You know WH people do pretty well without local and still make billions of ISK and have coped quite well with drifters....for like years now..
---
They will what? Appear out of nowhere? Tell me, how exactly do you enter a system without using a wormhole, a gate or a cyno? Do you have some knowledge I don't?
---
There are still a lot of good 3 letter names available, for future proofing have the first letter in the middle of the alphabet. You’ll live longer in fleet fights.
---
There's plenty of room to criticize mittens and his drifter salt without strawmanning him. The issue is not having to defend space, it's being forced to do tedious whack-a-mole pve for zero reward against an enemy that can literally cheat and doesn't follow any of the same rules by which players are restricted. Personally I think the drifter thing is really cool because I love when CCP expands on the lore, but I do see where he's coming from, and you aren't accurately representing his argument. Not that I expected anyone to, of course.
---
Nope. Try again. Ideally, after you've learned how to read.
---
Invest in a proc or skiff then, adapt or die as the followers of BOB say.
---
Nice!  Can we also try Concord blackout?
---
Imagine being so bad at this game that it takes cheating AI to do what you never could. Big oof.
---
Don't delete that post. Get pissed off about it FFS. Go dream up some new meta and take you anger out in game.
---
BLOW SOME SHIT UP !!!!
---
Be the tip of the fucking null spear. Get mad!!!! Fight god damn it. Don't you dare roll over and die you son of a bitch!
---
One JF of fuel, as is standard for all GSOL fuel jobs, fuels the average structure for two years. It's work, but not much.
---
Maybe you should have learned more about the game before jumping into an Orca. Maybe you should have learned how to warp off in a pod before buying expensive implants. These are not goons' problems, they are yours. The irony of you saying "harden the fuck up" is amazing. Also, post that orca lossmail lmao
---
I can think of a few groups that either have never considered putting a cloaked set of eyes on the gates , dont have the accounts to do it, or are just too damn lazy.
---
This is going to be so much fun, assuming they even undock.
---
You said players don't appear without showing on dscan, probe scan, or local.
---
But local is going away, not all ships, especially cloaked ships, are dscannable, and cloaked ships aren't probe scannable.
---
Can work if you are in your 0.0 power block with standing fleet and capability of destroying most other fleets ( anyone a 150 people bb fleet ). Won't work if you are in a smaller alliance everybody wants with 20 people online, whitch maybe do their own things and can't jump instantly to you.
---
WTB backbone
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Getting us primed for the ‘intel structures’(or what ever they are called)  that will bring back local...if you are a big enough group to install them over your area.
---
That could be pretty neat tbh.
---
If that's what happens and things just get whiny and boring ima deploy to fac war until people htfu.
---
Much easier to navigate nullsec than wspace though, and there’s still asset safety.
---
another one
---
keep em coming boys
---
This actually made front page holy shit
---
It does though. How many people are actually gonna keep a gate under watch close enough? A cloaky ship is only visible for one tick. Even worse if it cov cynos in buddies past your watch and they suprise you. No way are multiple gates going to be watched closely, its just not workable.
---
*Laughs in nullified T3*

globby you have been 100% retarded since I first read your posts, and have only continued to be more and more retarded as time continues, your posts matter nothing to me
---
&gt; Goon sig, tyvm
---
What a cute pet name they gave you.
---
See you gotta get interesting with fits, like a 20km rocket kestrel or Casper's autism arty slasher, and you can frag the bog standard blingy pirate frigs too, because most of those pilots have no idea what to do if something goes unexpectedly.
---
So after losing their structures in the North Co2 slept on Hordes couch for a bit..Moral crumbled and players starting leaving as we (Goons) cloaky camped them .They eventually called it quits and created a corp within horde for the refugees .GigX has been rumored to have uninstalled Eve and is eagerly awaiting the launch of Classic Wow where he intends on living his old Glory days again..Time will tell I guess.
---
I’m desperately hoping Black Ops come back with this, maybe a BLOPS BS overhaul if CCP is serious about shaking up the game.  I’d resub to do some black ops battleship pvp.
---
I like how the majority of the subreddit is for this change, yet the official forum thread is rife with people moaning and claiming that they are unsubbing.
---
You have it, an old one that's been around forever, it's knarled twisted and fucking mean. Be that guy in your group that says.
---
No fuck this. I'm going to go out there with some guys and we are going to put a savage beating on these dudes.
---
Be that guy in your group that says. You know what. Fuck all this unhappy talk in hear. Get your shit together boys. We are going to war for real this time.
---
This isn't going to be endless boring citadel bashing. We are going to catch and brutally punish anyone that fucks with us!
---
Be that guy!!! You can do it!
---
You are a capsuleer !
---
so basically nothing that wasn't possible or annoying before?
---
what is it with people with the KF flair posting like absolute fuckwits at all times
---
He's init, he knows all about risk aversion
---
All your rorqual's belong to us!
---
but this is difficult for intel bots! oh no
---
Let me repeat that since I see you struggling.
---
ENTER. THE. SYSTEM. We can put scouts and bubbles up on every gate and wh coming into our area, and we have info on players coming into our system, in real time. We can NOT put scouts in literally every single place in the entire system as a warning against drifters. That's the difference. How do you think people in wormholes defend against gankers? The difference there is, they don't have literal god coming in to kill them.
---
Slow down with the big words, you're talking to a hordeling.
---
Does that mean someone bought the ridiculously overpriced one I listed like 2 months ago?
---
Well now you can just logout and no one will know if you are there
---
&gt;but neither requires you to spam a radar button repeatedly
---
Dscan is good and doesnt provide perfect Intel anyway. 
---
It also has a high skill ceiling when trying to catch people and dscan their position. I've been able to dscan someone's safe down to .1 au in the cloak timer and then drop combats right on them.
---
or you could afk and people will KNOW that you are there
---
its a lure, just like in real life some fish have lights infront of their mouths so they can get easy prey.
---
CCP: Let's go ahead and roll the next few updates out without bouncing the changes off the CSM.  
---
CSM: Looks like nothings happening.  
---
EVE: rolls around in it's own shit  
---
r/Eve: Why didn't the CSM do something?
---
Right, and meanwhile, another couple thousand people resub. Oh no, whatever will we do??
---
Your pos tower idea is kind of torpedoed when you realize it will says "Sisters Combat Scanner Probe | Small Hybrid Turret Battery"
---
&gt;might make some large groups turtle up for a couple weeks out of spite
---
Because a corp can tell thousands of people to not play the game and they'll listen
---
If CCREEEE doesn't fix cynos, all this means is PVE players will quit.  CCP subs dump AND nothing to hunt, much excite.
---
&gt;You need to check this on SISI yourself but there is huge chance that T3 cruiser with signature reducing subsystems that you will leave on a safespot ( aka eject from it) will be unprobable in best bonused ship, at max skills and best implants.
---
There are no true unprobably ships anymore.
---
Only in nullsec, not low or high
---
The salt today is amazing, please keep it coming!
---
Let the salt flow
---
Lol, everyone hates the 30boxing rorqual pilot until CCP shuts down the game because 100 of those guys stopped subbing accounts.
---
I am not saying this is a terrible idea, just as always, CCP's implementation is stupid and feels rushed.  This will be another, in a long line of failed experiments.  They will end it, then act like that was the plan all along, and tell us there will be a new structure coming right around the corner.  Then, 12 months later (because they never intended to release a structure), we will get it, and it will barely function, or have serious unintended consequences.
---
Circle of EVE.
---
This could be true because ratting ships also won't show on local. Now when gankers enter a system they see nothing on local as well. Now it takes more effort to find out if there might be ratters in the system. So they might just choose to go to more populated systems.
---
There is no pilot in this ship... This changes a lot
---
The only thing I dont like.os for solo players now requiring to pay for 2 subs just to be able to scan down the systems for hostile.. 
---
Not sure being forced to pay for 2 accounts just to scout is right.. CCP should then implement a mobile unit that scans entire system
---
This could easily be balanced by certain ships being able to light instantly while most require a spool up....
---
Imo any small group not garbage will survive finally larger groups will always survive decently because of them having more members/resources
---
Id like to know as well, it does sound fun!  Surprised no salty vet has commented yet about how it killed Eve and it was a terrible way to run a game -_-
---
He's on a lot in USTZ too

&gt; im training for dscanless recons, not the cloaky ones. only the cloaky ones get fitting bonuses to the cloak module.
---
Recon Ships bonuses (per skill level):
---
20% bonus to Warp Scrambler and Warp Disruptor optimal range
---
10% bonus to Medium Hybrid Turret optimal range
---
40% bonus to Energy Nosferatu and Energy Neutralizer optimal range
---
20% bonus to Energy Nosferatu and Energy Neutralizer falloff range
---
20% bonus to Energy Nosferatu and Energy Neutralizer drain amount
---
60% bonus to Stasis Webifier optimal range
---
5% bonus to Medium Projectile Turret damage
---
30% bonus to ECM Target Jammer strength
---
10% bonus to Heavy Missile and Heavy Assault Missile max velocity
---
If you don't think these bonuses are massive, yikes.
---
Thanks for the pep talk: I'll file it under "shit I already know".
---
I didn't say it was my Orca.
---
That has always been the final conclusion
---
It's like they don't understand people are tired of super caps online.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
If me and my GF found a wormhole into invaded high-sec space, is that a thing anyone would care about? I want to take the fight to some invaders, but I am never sure how to go about doing so. She is mostly an astronomer/frigateer, while I have a slightly older account I have returned to with a PVE-prophecy fit. This post goes in many directions...
---
There were 0 orders showing in Jita/Amarr at one point so they  were bought out, unless it timed out - yes?
---
When is the next AT for you to Commentate on ? :V
---
It is time my friend.
---
There will be blood
---
It sounds like this will be most of July, and then they'll probably decide what to do based on the player response. I doubt this will last due to the krabs reeing but I will enjoy every second it lasts
---
**FUCK**
---
YES!
---
it wasn't already?!  Pleb!
---
Cheating AI? How does it cheat and what does it cheat at?
---
Your milquetoast comment says nothing in a whole lotta words.
---
&gt; Lai Dai protection service forces landing on Intaki V as mercenary conflict **developers**
---
If this was how it appeared in the video, LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE.
---
So if your not goons or test your fucked ?
---
You can just roam to an area, log off, and come back in 3 hours
---
I would also like some of your stuff
---
So do something about it, like forming fleets.
---
I love you @CCP_Falcon !!!
---
CCP's next bright idea is to add local to wormholes.
---
Yay a Syndicate story. Warms my little Rote heart.
---
it attracts plex ventures
---
Pretty much sums up the game.
---
Don't call ya self "sabre" or similar you will always be primary.
---
Maybe it's time to retire.
---
So because the experience sucked for you , you want it to suck for everyone else too?
---
D-scan could just have an automatic mode. Like, a 360 ping every 2 seconds. Literally what you already get by mashing V, but without mashing V.
---
How about... an alliance gets &lt;x&gt; observatories and it's tied to IHUB or TCU.
---
You can get 10 systems with access to near perfect intel, but if you've got 200 systems, better be prepared to split up your alliance (hence losing entosis defence ability) or go without local.
---
Getting more retarded by the minute...
---
You can build in npc stations, or you can drop your own station.
---
This is the descriptions's ship, I believe that "**police patrol vessel**" is the reason
---
 "The Comet's design comes from one Arnerore Rylerave, an engineer and researcher of the Roden Shipyards corporation. Originally created as a standard-issue **police patrol vessel**, its tremendous maneuverability and great offensive capabilities catapulted it into the Navy's ranks, where it is now a widely-used skirmish vessel. "
---
I don't know is that is common on other countries, but in my country, the police usually have a big light in the car.
---
so you are saying large empires will consolidate and leave open are for smaller corps to take sov and not get turbo blobbed by a top10 alliance deploying to get more renter space?
---
Small corps dont have the massive botting problem that infests all the high pop ones.
---
People in large alliances will continue to be careless and it gives many more opportunities for a roaming gang to split the responding fleet and get some not complete shit fights
---
If indy people stop logging in, thats completely fine lmao. Everything already is super cheap, so having a price increase to losses mean something is good. Plex is the only pricey item on the market, and having less people buy plex for their 20 indy toons will drop the price of it.
---
can you rat in a Curse?
---
Find me more players who want to live in null without a super cap umbrella to protect them?
---
There will always be greedy crabs who just cant stop :)
---
In for salt-flavoured stuff
---
Pvp fit rattlesnake
---
And yet, people krab in wormholes just fine. Seems more like an issue for the people who don't have any spare braincells.
---
&gt; why should a team of a thousand people not be able to protect themselves
---
Having a team of a thousand people is the problem CCP is trying to address.
---
"Autism arty slasher" - the dual TD point kiting one? Javelin rocket MWD kestrel? Interesting concepts. Turning random shit people slide into for brawls into point kiters AB fits can't catch is a classic tho.
---
Here we go!
---
Bots will adapt.
---
Right, it's obviously a light, but it's also the size of a bus, and it looks like light is only emitting from the very top even though the whole thing is glowing. It' looks really weird to me.
---
**LAUGHS IN VASTLY SUPERIOR LACHESIS**
---
6.7% higher dps output 
---
50% longer turret range
---
50% higher turret tracking
---
+1 midslot
---
+13 m/s base speed
---
higher hp in all parameters
---
25% longer targeting range
---
15% higher anti-jam strength
---
+10Mbit drone bandwidth (50, arazu only gets  40)
---
17% higher base scan res
---
Smaller sig radius
---
+2 locked targets
---
And finally, doesn't show up on Dscan while you're killing some player who's too stupid to report that he's even being attacked, something that years of living in null has taught me is exceedingly common.
---
the forum complaints i'm sure were pretty expected by ccp, the only question is if the threats of unsubbing will materialize in enough numbers to push ccp towards the panic button. I think the major blocks will have a lot o influence on that outcome, as they could take the position that they will oppose this change in every way possible, or they can embrace it for "the good of the game" narrative. 
---
However given past coments made by themittani and his cohorts on the metashow, i find the second of those options to be very unlikely.
---
The scary part is how many retards think this is actually going to fix the game.  I can't wait to watch it burn.  EVE needs serious changes, but this one is in the wrong direction, as people will soon find out.
---
Yikes.
---
I expect they will and that everyone celebrating in here will as well once they realise that people are just going to unsub and undock even less than they do now. Hard to hunt those that just refuse to play entirely
---
Yet again, another moron omits the fact that there aren't cynos in WH space.  History is a flat circle.
---
Nah a dual nano mwd point arty slasher. Look at casper's killboard, hes lost so many of them but killed so much, too.
---
Mwd kestrel with navy or rage rockets but fit with an mwd, point, and missile comps - think like an L4 blitzing polarized garmur, but cheaper. People never expect it and you get some shiny loot.
---
lol, I knew eve took place under water, this confirms it
---
That thing https://imgur.com/gallery/o47HQeC
---
True, but writing a bot to read local is far easier and more concrete than d scanning bots
---
&gt; Unless they also add a structure to inhibit local chat in system, which could be alright
---
This would not be alright at all, what the fuck are you smoking?
---
Anchoring a module to disable local is completely antithetical to sneaking in with a small fast gang, and hitting targets before they even know anyone is around, or moving a cyno through to titanbridge undetected, or blops.
---
Looking only for stuff in 0.0 bases I can't access to put with my other stuff.
---
Can I get that?
---
&gt; Join the shit train
---
So who's ass do I have to stitch my mouth to, and can I get a girl on my ass?
---
Yet again you're a fucking moron for not considering what "Pulverized Asteroids" could or would mean. 
---
And if you're arguing that that part of the sentence means nothing, because there is no such thing as "Pulverized Asteroids" in game. Then with the rest of the description being right-on in terms of what it does. Wouldn't the most logical course of action be to change it so it's "right-on" in terms of *everything*?
---
Pretty much this.  
---
People complain about large alliances and the blue donuts, but what in these changes are going to fix that.  Everything reinforces coming together in larger and larger groups, in smaller areas,  to protect your space with bigger and bigger ships.  
---
It will decrease the number of nice unsupported subcap ratting ships, even more than they already have been.  People will ship up to super/Titans, rat and light a cyno when the large fleets and dreds come.  Or they will ship down to cheap and expectable ships and price it into the cost of rating.  
---
I expect though that fewer and fewer people will, and hate on me all you want, bother to undock.  Super cap ratting is already pretty darn un fun for all but the most autistic....even if that is the only way to make real ISK anymore. 
---
The disruption of local will be a win for Rorqual drone hunters, as long as people still put out excavators.  The greedy/stupid will still feed, but If I were to wager, I would expect people to shift to T2 drones at ever higher numbers and just again light a cyno when the hull is really threatened.   Less money...but also less screwing around.  I am sure people will feed like crazy till they figure this out.  
---
Rorquals will probably still be the ‘go to’ mining ship though, even if they only took in a little bit more than a barge, secondary to the difficulty to kill under...you got it...the capital umbrella.  
---
Oh well...just my two cents.  Time will tell if CCP has thought about things enough and balanced the number of players that they are going to lose with those that they will gain.
---
The Wormtide rises.
---
&gt; Dscan is good and doesnt provide perfect Intel anyway. 
---
You are misreading. I have an issue with the overly manual aspect of d-scan. There is nothing skilled about pressing a button every second or so. It's just tedious.
---
More Salt! For The Salt Throne!
---
I retired like 3 years ago. Last time i ratted around this time. Just burning isk now. At this rate i will be broke in like 7 years. Unless one of my speculation cans skyrocket again. Then longer.
---
Or actually make any actual changes lol.
---
lol lowjack
---
From what I've heard and read of CSM minutes seems like they spend a lot of time just trying to steer the ship away from the icebergs CCP throws at them. 
---
Having more than one CSM from a single coalition is definitely not helping though. I'm not sure why goons were allowed to have nearly half the CSM while all of w-space is represented by a single guy from TDSIN.
---
I went about 30 jumps through frat space trying to find a fight while posting the Chinese chat nuke copypasta in every system
---
is this going to be our version of brazil is numero uno huehuehuehuehue
---
Do what wormholers do.... don't be shit.
---
Oooonomnomnom !!!
---
Time to resub my hunters and blops and enjoy the party :D
---
Plenty of ideas now that I want to try to catch those poor carebears :D
---
Thx CCP !!! Make eve great again ! (Especially 0.0)
---
Oh.... i see...
---
about the size, if you is looking for frigate in an asteroid field, you will need all the light that you can have.
---
and the  lighting is really weird... some broken LED's  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Can confirm I am both and idiot and still will play. In fact I will play more than I ever have. The salt mines shall be plentiful this summer.
---
Cloaks need to use fuel
---
In 2 month they will cry for lake of content and target.
---
&gt; Yes please.  Break down into "local governments" handling your own area of the alliance.
---
Laffo. Good joke.
---
Six years later, it's almost worth resubbing if they actually go there...
---
https://interstellarprivateer.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/unbreaking-local/
---
I have a feeling that the lost subs from this aren't going to offset the gained subs, the result will be less total targets after a couple days and we'll be right back to square one because fewer people will be around.
---
I think it means if WINGSPAN rolls through a wormhole into a system the entire population doesn't instantly dock.
---
Tldr: fun is back
---
cringe
---
I have never played Albion - but in EVE it's pretty easy tbh. Join the group you hate, befriend them, then slowly ruin the corp/alliance either by stealing their shit, leaking intel, or stoking tensions with rival groups. Eventually they'll cave in (or you'll make off with tens of billions in assets if you opt to steal).
---
Sounds pretty much the same to me.
---
People may get in before the scouts are in place, or past the scouts, or through a new wormhole.
---
Not really any different.
---
As a small gang dude, I have lit 0 cynos, and have had dozens lit on me in the month I've come back. You're a moron. Nullbears are still safe, stop QQing.
---
The problem is i think is the truth about local nerfing... CCP can't solve the bug
---
You say that right up until all the t2 ships are gone or prices are through the roof and there is litterally no one to kill for a dozen jumps or more. You think space is empty now, wait until the miners and ratters just unsub and leave.
---
It's not wrong though.
---
So, anyway, if you really want to get some hemmorhoids you should check the descriptions for the ESS
---
They had to do something to mess with local to make observatories worth anything. It's to be expected they follow soon.
---
Ratting in supers and regular caps will be fine under an umbrella, so people that already have them will be fine. New people wanting capitals will have a harder time grinding up to caps. So we'll still have supercapitals online, just not for new people.
---
FUCK YEAH!
---
This doesn't affect the umbrella, rorquals, faxes or supers in any way whatsoever.  This tells me you don't live in null and have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Only if local goes back to normal. Quit trying to have it both ways to just advantage yourself.
---
wtf I can't stop masturbating, please help
---
^^^I ^^^need ^^^another ^^^set ^^^of ^^^hands ^^^mine ^^^are ^^^so ^^^tired
---
Yeah I can see that kestrel being really annoying, and yeah I can't see very many people expecting that. Could be a decent generalist fit tbh.
---
Ah, that casper. I mostly just see him afk baiting with cloakies these days.
---
&gt;whom they believe to be ruining the game to suffer, no matter the cost.
---
I mean everyone else suffers except nullsec. Null finally starts having to play the game like everyone else and they hate it. 
---
You'll feel more accomplished in your play time if what you're doing is more difficult. You'll be ok.
---
Me, for one. Caps should be for declared wars. Cap vs cap fleets. Make it meaningful.
---
LETS TURN UP THE HEAT!!!
---
THAT'S A LOT OF W'S MATE
---
Amen.
---
Wormholer btw
---
It is delayed which is the same as how wormholes work now. Even if these things that are happening are temperary, the threat is clear: these things can happen and they need to be adjusted to.
---
They'll just go back to high sec.  After a while it'll be LP per isk instead of isk per LP.
---
I deserve your stuff, cause I have been crying about a blue TEST, ever since we left the north.
---
&gt;The point is that this event does nothing to break up large coalitions
---
You're making a massive assumption that OP 
---
Is being genuine and you aren't being baited.
---
Time to build some intel bots that cloak near gates, and automatically show info on any ship that appears after jumping through, and report the pilot in intel channels! 
---
(I'm kidding, I have zero interest, but this is doable)
---
I so much agree.  
---
When CCP changed the playstyle I liked. I spoke up, but in vein, and was told to adoupt. I did and enjoy the playstyle I'm now doing.  
---
On a side note I wonder how much ppl spend on PvP now they can't afford it anymore
---
&gt; Licks lips looks at everybody... you thinking what I'm thinking ???
---
You're damn right I know what you're thinking. *unzips pants and gets ready for a blowjob*
---
So something like a radar system that submarines use then...
---
Im also looking forward to cynos all over wormholespace :D
---
Yeah he used to do things but nearly winning the AT twice does things to a man...
---
It worked fine in rage
---
Its almost as if tardholes don't have to worry about cynos.  Lets compare apples to grapes some more!
---
Can you run a Gila in lvl 1 abysal or does the gate restrict it to frigate only
---
I like it. Better than drifters
---
I'm all for changes, even changes like this, but the execution was just poorly done IMO. We'll see how it goes!
---
Thanks for your insight, captain crystal ball

i haven't really pve'd in years, ive been coasting since like, 2014.  Not exploding helps.
---
Um.  No.  My statement has nothing to do with the post.  The question was about what point was being made when the previous comment claimed that there was more evidence for Dran's posts.
---
i think mr. drifter can convince CCP
---
Both the Rook and the Curse can pass as PvE boats.
---
The Rook is Kinetic locked but has plenty of mids for tank and can do well outside of Blood Raider/Sansha space. 
---
The Curse can use RLMLs and drones, but drones will show up on D for an alert hunter. I've used my Curse in an escalation in Reblier, was kind of spooky. 
---
**Recons have very thin buffer.** You can be cooked very easily if you're clumsy or not fitted correctly. I wouldn't run more than a 6/10 with a Combat Recon. Make sure your tank numbers match your conventional ship you use in Pyfa.
---
Sure, fly an empty freighter worth 1 b to the center of Goons null space.  Let us know if you make it.  That is all the proof needed.
---
That was part of OPs statement
---
Game just keeps dying
---
Only undock in something you can afford to lose, when that is a carrier then you're good, until then use something else.
---
Get a bunch of mates together and all undock together in a ratting fleet - spread across the Constellation and warn each other when there's bad guys..NPC or PVP.
---
Stay alert and aligned - warp out when you see bad guys (you'll need a faster warping ship) and let your drones die.
---
Yes you'll earn less ISK crabbing than before when it was easy (you wont be able to watch netflix and play) and safe but your experience is going to be more challenging and you are really going to earn the next ship upgrade - 
---
Supplement your crabbing with market trading and maybe a little industry. Re-calibrate your ISK expectations and your risk v reward expectations.
---
Encourage your group to pay others who enjoy killing Drifters. Think rental empire model. Encourage your Alliance leaders to rethink how they organize the Alliance' activities.
---
One last Big Thing .... prior to these changes we couldn't retain new players in the game. Despite the perfect world that is being shaken up we couldn't retain new players. Isn't it worth changing things up to see if a different style of game can retain players better?
---
If I could have 6000 I would.
---
rorquals will be the only things safe with no local, they can panic and get saved, same applis for supers, they can tank gangs.
---
only ratting battleships and smaller would suffer
---
RIP Botters
---
So they are just adding lore to the game so they don't need to fix local?
---
The hope of this is why these changes have me so excited.
---
Show me some data for that and then I'll start believing
---
I don't think they're killing the game, they're just killing *my* game.  
---
From what I could tell from playing for the past few years - most PVE activities were consistent, and somewhat stagnant, except for the rotating high sec / low sec events which seemed to provide fresh content.   
---
Unfortunately I'm not sure what aspects of the game you're referring to have been ruined.
---
That's why you hold him for a minute and wait for dumbos to warp in to try and save him.  Catching ratters definitely creates smallgang fights.
---
That's sonar, you landlubber
---
Well I don't know if eve has girls, but I can find a nullbear who's tongue won't stop waffling after that announcement , cool?
---
Ah, okay. Didn't know you were on the spectrum. Have a nice day then.
---
When you see people gating out or roll the hole. Otherwise bots just jump out to clear system. Remember they have instant perfect reaction, you get on one grid, they all gone, and you are marked, the system is vacated until you leave.
---
It lowers it's sensor strength and removes strat cruiser levels: IE ie becomes easier to probe. Also, the whole no such thing as unprobable is a hard cap not a mechanics change.
---
And how many are going to stay when they realize there's nothing left to hunt except supers under an umbrella?
---
What are you going to hunt?
---
&gt;He's ~~init~~ in null, he knows all about risk aversion
---
Now they should delete gates and random spawn in systems. 
---
/Probably unpopular opinion
---
When you just don’t feel you have enough structures to fuel up here are more!
---
So you're telling me there *are* Pulverized Asteroids... In Eve that the MTU works on.
---
Too comfy - said nobody in FCON
---
So which is it? Everyone doing level 4 mission running or everyone living under umbrellas with rorqual alts, faxes and supers? Because we already have the latter and it's pretty fucking awful.
---
You can take any t1 or t2 ship into any level abyssal sites for tier 1s a caracal is plenty good enough with standard t1 modules and medium skills
---
Listen, I chose my words carefully.
---
Experience is combat time, and i've been fcing fleets daily for almost a decade.
---
I never said good, best. I picked my word appropriately.
---
Experienced is valid.
---
*gasp*
---
&gt;I have an issue with the overly manual aspect of d-scan.
---
Just dscan? You dont have an issue with the manual aspect of piloting your ship?
---
You trying to turn Eve into a game of werewolf?
---
This is Eve, everyone here is on the spectrum.
---
Your thinking is just so small so you can focus energy towards doomsaying.
---
Even if they don't unsub, you won't get risk averse people to undock by increasing the risk level.
---
working on it
---
I'm saying the MTU works on every pulverized asteroid in Eve.
---
Not part of the CSM though. Likely will come up with a good idea and be thrown out of the window as usual.
---
HAM rook with minor bling will get around 500 dps and respectable EHP/s tank but you want to stay away from EM heavy rat or neut heavy rats.
---
Active or passive is possible but active is best ehp/s. Won't be able to fit cloak or mwd so bring spare and a mobile depot to travel fit. Also worth bringing an oh shit blue pill as there's very little buffer on an active fit. Some rats/sites might have NPC wrecking shots that will go through most of it. Passive can get BS sized buffer against kin/therm rats and not far against explosive heavy rats.
---
You'll go through HAM pretty darn quick and you're effectively kin-locked. Bring some javelin and some faction (I like to have a bit of all 4s CN types, about 500 each) but rat with rage.
---
I'll believe you think removing local is good for the game when you beg to have local removed from HS and LS.
---
Holy fucking shit. YES.
---
Welcome.to democracy in a space game.
---
This is probably the only good thing to come out of this whole drifter bullshit thing, now people don't have to bother doing logoff traps anymore
---
Says the high sec incursion bear.
---
Viva chile mierda
---
It's salt for when you can't find content, so you can season your tears.
---
I personally am hunting deklein, vale, geminate, venal.
---
You really want this game to become like Albion Online with scheduled fights?
---
Hey, he was in my alliance too!
---
Sure the rorqual might be safe but not its excavators which become far more vulnerable after the local changes.
---
And they say EVE is full of sociopaths....
---
As a new player what is being referred to by local?
---
I'm jealous, that almost never happens when I do it. Unless it's a larger entity like winter co. If it's a smaller group they dont really respond, as if every test memeber roaming is a cyno for an entire fleet
---
Lol, wow I am not awake. Fixed.
---
i'm not against it's removal in ls/hs
---
Exactly. Plenty of people are complaining, talking about unsubbing, and saying if they wanted no local they'd be in wormholes.
---
CCP will reverse this if it leads to a drop in players, their aim is to make money, not lose it. 
---
&gt;Hard to hunt those that just refuse to play entirely
---
I feel like the drifters will be hunting everyone who thinks they're hunting ratters too, which should be interesting.
---
Fuq me, spat beer all over my keyboard.
---
&gt;Should have made the change permanent. Don't give them hope that they can change it or they will try anything.
---
What of the people who will genuinely stop playing though? Plenty of these on the official forums. Is CCP happy to kiss those subscriptions goodbye?
---
would be cool if people still played this game...
---
So as I thought, there are none, and you're defending CCP's shit writing. 
---
Like I know it's a small detail, but other MMO communities would actually complain about shit like this and get a change made so it makes sense. 
---
I mean if you have a weapon in WoW (just as an example) that says it summons 100 Snarfils to attack your target. Snarfils isn't real and it's nothing in WoW to my knowledge. Anyway, you use the effect and nothing happens. Wouldn't you want it changed? 
---
I had a member in the Corp I'm in tell me that with some things it seemed as if CCP was going to be doing more with mining. Ans that makes sense.
---
Thats one thing they could change a bit, make it at least semi passive, each 20-30 seconds, its a stupid game mechanic to have to smash the same key every 3 seconds only to see the map, sure there are many games you use/hold alot of keys, but vvvvvvvvvvvvv its damm stupid considering how little APM an eve player have apart from small pvp and carrier ratting.
---
At this point I need a bot that just comments `adapt or die` on any post with a goon flair, should be accurate pretty much 100% of the time.
---
Yes ratting and mining will stop completely.  Also good luck killing 30 mil EHP super under cap umbrella with or without local.
---
It'll still have drifters, so he'll have some company.
---
&gt;  better be prepared to split up your alliance (hence losing entosis defence ability)
---
So... you've never seen 200 Goons supporting 5 toasters from Bastion, or some such arrangement?
---
The changes are not helping the server population....
---
100mn Lach?
---
If the nullbears leave, who will you hunt?
---
How everyone else plays the game? You mean "logged out in an NPC station?"
---
The number of titan pilots have exceeded the limit for your dream to happen. Eve has evolved.
---
Plenty of games have stuff like that.
---
Destiny has a box of raisens. Destiny 2 has a coupon for Ramen.
---
EVE has dozens and dozens of items that are lore only.
---
The game literally has exotic dancers. They don't do anything. They still have descriptions.
---
There are no pulverized asteroids for you to believe this would work on. Your interpretation was wrong.
---
Also, literally doesn't matter.
---
I wonder if you would literally punch your monitor if they deleted dotlan and other pve metrics you use to hunt.
---
Would it hurt you poor thing? 🥺
---
*Slow clap*
---
This gaming community is in a realm of its onw.
---
&gt; Break down into "local governments" handling your own area of the alliance.
---
I like this idea. Force large coalitions to federalise at the corporate level.
---
Each system has a chat where you can see everyone logged in in the system.
---
The difference is there are no cynos in wormholes. You can’t just get dropped by a black ops cyno and have 50 dreads show up to murder you. You can close yourself off and size limits on holes. This just promotes us to not play
---
I've never hunted and wouldn't even know where to start, so I doubt it
---
What is near2? Seen a couple of comments about it now
---
Sooooo Jintaan, what you reckon? :)
---
You can just search your asset list for that capital and manually move it to asset safety now
---
sup
---
The null sec salt mines are fully open now.. * laughs in wormholer*
---
:)
---
How does this stop rental empires?
---
Instead you takle something and have no warning of a response fleet till its on grid
---
Yes, he was angry because I read other books.
---
You really have no fucking idea how to play this game, do you?
---
Holy shit
---
Fairly convinced that is half the point of this experiment.
---
Push people back into low sec, breathe life into that region, where if nothing else you know who's in system with you.
---
Force null sec to be what it should be. A fucking wilderness except in all but a few well defended strongholds.
---
what is v for 100 alex
---
Wat?
---
Imagine writing all this without knowing how they're even implementing the change. Never change.
---
Ah ok that’s why I was thinking. So is it broken because people don’t like to be able to see everyone that’s in the sector? I kinda felt like it took half the fun outa the d-scan. Once I got the hang of it and picked up a few tricks I love it but being able to see how many players and whom seemed kinda funny.
---
May the Mods have mercy upon you.
---
Uncontested structure bashes would be fun if you got tons of loot
---
hope all is well friendo ⊂(・﹏・⊂) you're the og of friendship friday ༼ つ ◕‿◕ ༽つ
---
Mobile depots ruin that.
---
Your bad idea needs to use fuel.
---
Our bosons are waiting come on over. ..
---
You may now get excited!
---
Rorquals, prepare thy asses for a delivery.
---
Its also salt when you find content and drop HAW dreads on it.
---
Remember when CCP discovered that's a bug?
---
Have alcohol poisoning now.
---
You think a spoolup for defensive cynos is going to result in any ratting subcaps being saved?
---
Ahh...
---
you need more then this to make blops good again, sb's are just strait out better and cheaper.
---
v hard to do, since most high adm systems are littered with wrecks
---
Just a heads up, you’re getting trolled. The frigs were there to hold down the supers until the supers dropped.
---
not having maxed skills make a tremendous difference, what are you smoking?
---
Yes it does.
---
You can jump through a wormhole inside the intel gate. You can jump the gate, scare the intel guy, log off in system and come back online later, and be in system without jumping the gate. You can cyno in and not jump the gate.
---
It is far better.
---
Well if you know how to use D Scan and combat probe, you'll have plenty of warning.  But the average nullbear doesn't even know where those buttons live, so advantage wormholers.
---
I've got no problem with intel channels, though out of game alert tools like Near get close to a line.
---
We will just dock up and go play another game
---
Oh yes
---
why else do you think they have eve down under, its a clear refrence to the sea
---
It is a Gallente ship.
---
Any questions about the design can be explained by *fashion*
---
All I can derive from the comments is that krabs think they should be able to print money without any risk.
---
renaming a ship and expecting anyone to fool for that is fucking dumb.
---
yeah, because someone doing ratting with a combat recon will totally not spam dscan
---
why would anyone be hoping for NPC vs NPC shit? just want to have random shit happening on the server shitting up the server? is this the effect twitch has had on the new bread of gamer? just want to watch? wtf
---
Those are bots dear
---
Lowsec does have some high quality moons, but gl mining those.
---
Abyss scares me because one internet flicker and you've lost ~4bil worth of ship and pod :(
---
I have a Gila that can run 4's pretty easy but just such high risk
---
Johnny Pew had a video about running lowsec PVE in a Rook.
---
Something needs to be done about cynos too. However, cynos massively advantage the local umbrella owners, so it's a bit rich complaining about them with regard to a hunter.
---
Highsec has a different much more incursion type event for Invasion.
---
This teaches us that High Sec Carebears feed Null Botters but they don't give them any clothes. Therefore, Null Botters fly around in just capsules.
---
Ccpls I want to be able to join the drifters to help kill local
---
They really can't find just 350 members to down vote a thread?
---
The drifters are not literally the sleepers they are allied with them. The drifters are most likely in fact the other oh, the rogue AI intelligence that also infected the empress.
---
The extreme shorthand of it is agent Smith never had mio and so now runs the matrix and has broken free buy puppeting dead bodies with implants.
---
Enjoy.

Somethig like this should work obviously better to tune resists to your local rats tanks 270ish omni dps base more once the reactive warms up, cap lasts 14 mins everything on.
---
Once your comfortable with running the sites drop the damage control for a dda upgrade the turrets to t2 when possible
---
I'm so very disappointed in CCP, making me actually agree with olmeca. they should feel ashamed
---
&gt; Beacause people who attack will have golden ammo
---
wtf are you on about
---
Check out "Emergent Threats" trailer, the Inheritance chronic, the book Templar One, and/or my Twitch streams 😁
---
Isk for local seems like it just undoes any purpose the blackout does. Unless it's expensive per system; large alliances shit diamonds so it's not going to make a difference for them.
---

---
Sorry for no link, on mobile
---
mittins:im pissed off we will burn high for this ccp 
---
ccp: oh you will ok we will turn of local so your ratters need protection
---
this is getting good pass the popcorn
---
Your suggestion would make hunting easier then without this change.
---
I just tried to watch that show but had to turn it off, that mittani guy is such an insufferable faggot jesus christ.
---
sir we're getting shot at!
---
ok.
---
Obviously you don't know how PI works in WH space... you just undock and stop the Epithal, access your planets, move your PI to the Customs hangars and just warp from one POCO to another looting your PI or moving to the factory planets. no more that 5 sec. in each stop, back to the citadel and while you have a tethering protection, you can move from hangars to the factories in each planet remotely.
---
Nullbears needs to use their brain...
---
Sansha is the correct answer.
---
So you don't have a good reason?
---
&gt; Hunters will be ready, but defense fleets will be there, fauxs, supers, on standby at all time
---
Sounds like content.
---
Most of null is empty already, and even where it's not, it functionally is because everything docks up as soon as you hit system. Having some known systems where you can get a fight would actually be better than that, even if you think everyone will shack up together and fight over the anoms there.
---
There are a lot of points to this experiment.
---
So we shouldn't be working as a team is your problem? Someone in this thread said that people should interact with each other.
---
No dont dude holy shit eating is more important than shooting at fat carebears in null. Please take care of yourself my dude and get to a place where having fun online doesnt collide with eating.
---
Don't bother,
---
Querns is literally the saddest shittiest most mittens jizz soaked moron to ever post on reddit.
---
Just block him and move on. he has nothing important to say.
---
There was no incentive to before. If they rework asset safety and all (or even some) contents drop groups will definitely start burning structures.
---
It would bring about a lot of salt from fuckboys with personal krab-holes though.
---
1st rat kill a day was 10k sp. It was a short range test, had some mixed results, and was rejected by the vocal portion of the player base.
---
Make cloak have a cooldown like the ADC, so you can't unfit it immediately after using it. You'd at least have to hang around in space, vulnurable, for 5 or so minutes before you could use the cyno properly
---
Ugh if that happens..
---
&gt;Wormhole corp
---
&gt;Live in Thera
---
Or use some kind of fuel.  LO would make sense.
---
inb4 everyone just docks up.
---
Well doing nothing sure as shit isn't going to fix the problem.
---
Even easier, have everyone in alliance login to an external program that takes your wait data to follow what systems you're all in and compares it with local number to give you a nice graphical display of systems with possible neutrals.
---
HUGINNS AND CURSES FOR DAYS!!!
---
You don’t actually know how to probe ships, do you?
---
The fight we saw yesterday seemed like a full on Drifter Trig Sansha conflict. Unknown how today's timer has gone...
---
Wormholes have hole control, and dont have gates or cynos. What was your point?
---
I mean, if we want to give some WH stuff to NS it is only fair that WH get some NS stuff too, say, external cynos into the wh?
---
this is the only safe way to do it, anything else is spod brain
---
Or drones
---
Erection inception.
---
It's only "experience" if you learn from it, but yet here we are 2019 and same old chester
---
Cyno becon and cyno fields = if pilot is on coms and and fleet they can get saved advantage largest null blocks
---
I totally agree
---
I feel bad for GSOL if they need to be a fueled structure...but I feel worse for everyone else.
---
I would like to know why you think so.
---
Indeed.
---
Is it just me or does the reasons for the blackout in the video sound like the the silliest mumbo jumbo made up reasons to be heard in a long time?
---
Thank you. Noticed RIPD on zkill related being way too late to be in on this, hence removed them, but missed DHSJ's timing.
---
You honestly think that inserting a concord like npc then randomly spawns and instantly kills players is a good thing for the game?
---
So uh, what's going on here? Just passing on by from r/all
---
well i have a suspicion that Goon steller managment will do as much as they can to lower the impact of whats to come in delve    
---
why dont we have a "only 1 per alliance" rule yet?
---
&gt;Never change.
---
That seems to be this dude's motto.
---
you know that ship, that pretends it can jam things.
---
Avoid an A name...
---
Pallas can run C5 sites. But you might die
---
It only 'doesn't' matter because you deem it so.
---
Say you shut down your wormhole for farming.
---
I can't bring people in it to kill you on demand. There are no cynoes. You'll see me on can taking the static out, bringing people in. Not much I can do if you critted it too.
---
You will see if someone rolls into your wormhole. New signature.
---
I can't find your wormhole without allocating a scanner alt, like I can go to a null region whenever I want and hunt.
---
I can't check the "wormhole map" and see how many people are in your wormhole in space at the moment, or how many NPCs have been killed last hour, or how much mining was done last day.
---
In many ways, no local in null is different than wormholes.
---
Woah man you might be pregnant... skilled quite a few periods there
---
Didn't he delete all his vids when he quit eve
---
theres a hundred different ways to make isk in EVE. Every single one of them involves risk of losing a ship at some point in the process. Your point is moot.
---
Why would bots be unable to d-scan?
---
Those will die too. Adapting means moving to high sec or blobbing up more and hoping for the best.
---
so, like half of the ratters
---
No he's saying small groups won't take that space because it's safer to join test instead of being food for hungry hunters.
---
Yes, so we'll unsub.
---
^What this guy said
---
Big enough blops group can just leave a cyno alt in every system.
---
Finally, now all you nullsec/lowsec guys can learn to be twitchy d-scan spammers like us wormholers
---
nullbears: Reeeeeeeee
---
J-space crew: fuck yeah
---
&gt;Sev3rance
---
Individuals that dont blue up and take the harder path are not there because they dont work well with others, they are there because playing the game on option 1 is easy and mindless. What if they don't want to blue everyone because they want targets to fight? The entire conceited opinions of nullbears is what brought this on. Pilots in smaller groups are generally better pilots than the average Null Empire Pilot pound for pound hands down. And logistics is easy. When you dont have to supply the horde you can fit everything you need in a few JFs. TLDR, some people actually like to be challenged.
---
If they are actual Goons, then they adapted to this change several years ago when they set up the supercap umbrella to protect their ratters and miners.
---
Shut up peasant lol
---
oh so you still want to be spoonfed information by esi endpoints.  So you are in favor or intel for yourself but not for the guys you are hunting, glad you cleared that up.
---
i've only just started, it would be nice if there was an indicator of how strong a.i ships were before engagement. I resent having to spend most of my noob funds on replacing my commaragh after I attacked a ship I though was weaker than me. or maybe I'm just that shit
---
This is the best thing I've heard about Eve since ... well, since forever, really.
---
Null *should* be risky and have a frontier feel. And it will reward team play and organisation, which is good; penalise AFKing and near-AFKing, which is good; require bot authors to do a rewrite, which is good.
---
We still need to see something done about cynos, because the ability to instantly drop capitals on your head is another issue with roaming. But this is one of the two big ones.
---
hard to detect could mean time, it takes along time o detect if they are there and if so where, making it only applicable to campers while most other stuff would move often enough it wouldn't matter.
---
It would be an amazing thing to have, unfortunately I don't think it's possible due to how much it would load the servers.
---
Yay. But kinna shame. Had some fun just warping to a random system and having a local chat.
---
I guess they will **adapt** to using tankier ships, having logi for re-shipping, tackle to kill catch the blops **or** they will **die**.
---
It would actually be an interesting change to phase out high/low incursions and push them out to null only.
---
Yeah, I too buy overpriced ships that haven't had their buff even implemented yet.
---
Very thoughtful of you. Please take the time to read the post instead of making snide remarks. Good day.
---
Why would removing local have any impact on the supercap proliferation?
---
lol if u srsly believe this lmao
---
they adapted by using local overlays while netflixing and recalling drones *and* having 696969 nyx ready to jump, now you can just yeet their drones straight into the dumpster if you roll into delve

---
Oh no, we lost another not user!  Emergency.
---
Just give me something that spools up for 15-30 minutes and then EMP pulses all the cloaked ships in a system.
---
That way any cloaked capitals have ample time to jump out of system, anyone who is actually at their computer can easily respond, and afk cloak campers can get smackeroonied
---
absolutely love overcooked, play it with my partner all the time and we end up screaming at eachother :D

.... "And all of null shall be as the Newbean unto his first day in Geminate, terrified of the void and hunted by player and rat alike. For the Hel will die to the rat as the Algos. The bot Nyx will be sundered as the AFK VNI. The bittervet will weep tears of joy for the bounty and remorse for the egality. And thus the time of the Drifters shall come to pass. "
---
very sad nullbear yes
---
so do you opt for adapt, or opt for die
---
Tbf the last paragraph makes it look like a memepost
---
Ok you do that but first make 3 more accounts to bring it up to an even 50
---
people gonna whale the crap out of you, and dont tell me every ratting super is a brick. With the change to NSAs too, theyre quite vulnerable out there on their own.
---
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
---
Yeah tbh I would like an automated mode for dscan where it does a 14,3AU scan every 15 seconds or something without having to mash V. Even if it is a reflex at this point as a J-spacer.
---
Good riddance
---
Salt Detection Meter:  █████████▒  99%
---
Your base is under attack. Your base is under attack. Nuclear launch detected.
---
Go for it. Have fun.
---
All this change is going to do is to push industrialists deeper into a tighter supercap umbrella with more scouts on gates and new wormholes rolled - you're going to see renting space hit by this much harder than Delve, Eso and so on.
---
If you have a populated system, that is organised in a standing fleet, it can catch and kill a blops gang.
---
i summon blue eyes white draugur yeet ur drones dead 😂 😂 😂 😂
---
I choose to believe that StainGuy is actually the EVE-equivalent of a time-traveler from the 1800s going "OH MY GOD PLANES"
---
Well you weren't playing the real game anyways
---
Dscan gets fired off when you enter a system or undock
---
Eve has always been a game where you have to put the work on.  
---
What's the difference between local and your idea of automatically telling you who's in the system without having to out any work in?
---
A C1 is nothing to be proud of.
---
No, we just lost a goon!
---
Jeez. what a loss,  think of Mittens and how sad he will be when you are not contributing to the MER anymore :((
---
Hate that I have manually use my modules.  CCPls make it so it auto fires when in range.
---
I'm going to love moving shit unnoticed tbh
---
 **CONGRATULATIONS** you played yourself
---
YOU EVER SHITPOST SO HARD YOU KILLED AN IMPERIUM?!!
---
People who play differently = trolls. Bye
---
Goodboi
---
It will become not worth to even use excavs
---
Most miners with a single brain cell will use T2 drones, because they dont mine enough for the rate of death they'll have with the change
---
Hey it's ok pal. Just go open 47 Farmville accounts. That should get you through these hard times.
---
god damn this sub is desperate
---
Yeah. Everything  vurmhole now.
---
Yeah, it's about being lazy.  You have to just about everything yourself in eve.  Go play a blizzard game if you want simple mechanics.
---
Sortdragon in panic.
---
why is it safer in test? you can still rat aligned and dscanning. Its a nerf to people who bot or afk with near2. if you are at your keyboard you still cant get tackled unless its an instalock bomber. If a smaller group wants to own sov and use the space they still can
---
excuse me sir but you’ve said enough.
---
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA
---
Oh shit it's happening. CCP you absolute mad lads.
---
#About time.
---
What happened to the goon mentality of adapt or die?
---
Most experienced at getting dumpstered maybe
---
The only thing that will change is you can't use near 2 to be a fat lazy asshole anymore. 
---
So if you're not a fat lazy Netflix watching asshole. you won't have an issue.
---
I can think of a couple, some of which only require good organization and a single account per person. It could also be done in something smaller. I'm not sure if they will work, but hey, this is a sandbox, so go ahead and try stuff.
---
CCP is good at bringing people together.
---
Explain or shut up.
---
Such a fucken good change
---
Black ops corps finally being relevant? It's a great time to be alive.
---
Give it 3 timers, sure. But allow it to be disabled by hacking with no notifications sent out.
---
Obvious bait or troll.
---
Can I have a rorq. I'd love to finally use my skills
---
Enjoy telling people this till mittens fills you up with the "CCP man bad, local change bad" koolaid
---
isn't it ?
---
Well wait for the obvious cyno spoolup time.
---
&gt;while the rest of the game gets healthier
---
Lmao refusal to resub en-masse isn't CCP's idea of healthy
---
So risk averse people quit and non risk averse people have more fun. Risk averse/renter type players dock up for anything and everything anyway.
---
They will not sit idly by as their precious ticks go ungathered...but they may switch to something more reasonable than a hel to rat.
---
OMG, the saltmeter is OVERLOADING!!! xD
---
It's a pretty substantial change to an in game mechanic, people who live in the effected space are crying and threatening to quit, people who don't but will be able to play somewhat more freely again are happy and resubscribing.
---
It's another part of an apparently secret plan to tip the most stagnant, bot and RMT abused section of the game world up.
---
HTFU, bye! 👋
---
There's a few pictures online of good ship cutaways showing various systems and part of the comet( [Here](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m7_H76Mi08w/VgNF9_fL50I/AAAAAAAAIek/7X0aBKeGIgQ/s1600/CometCutAway.jpg) ) says it's a sensor suite.
---
yeah, fuck ccp for trying to change their stagnant game... better keep the game as it is and let it become even more boring.
---
fml spod isnt good for you
---
Take it one day at a time....think " oh local is not working today.." just like in past :p
---
I actually agree with this.
---
If you are so thick you cant see the difference let’s stop talking.
---
/r/eve
---
&gt;everyone is too condensed.. we should noy have 1 mega alliance all in 1 region
---
Also /r/eve
---
&gt;plz introduce more mechanics to encourage huddling under an oppressive cap umbrella.
---
Holy shit I thought this was a good joke until I discovered the salt mines of Moria behind your link.
---
Good. Hope its permanent
---
You don't have to Dscan on warp-in. Rat kill stats are visible on Dotlan, just go to high rat-kill systems, enter, and shotgun profitable anoms.
---
I think you will be surprised how much more fun New Eden becomes when roaming gangs are a thing again. Give it a try, it will involve some changes sure ... but the bonuses are going to far out weight the negatives in my view.
---
Another one for the collection.
---
Cool. You added nothing to the game anyway.
---
You have the largest supercap umbrella protecting you, fuck off.
---
who are willing to fight in these dangerous conditions? that doesnt eve apply to the supposed hunters
---
If this becomes permanent I might just resub! I lived in nullsec a while back and found it soulcrushingly boring and I was too poor to move to WH space. 
---
Hopefully this pulls the game back into the right direction.
---
He's a goon, he can't explain.
---
Adapt
---
I also always use absolutely the same flair on my reddit account as my in-game alliance.
---
Surely it’s at 100%
---
The main chat channel for an area is delayed, meaning you can't see who is in the area unless they talk.
---
Does this mean that taking what you need from a different entity would become viable? Like... declaring war on your neighbors, because they have that what you want.
---
I'm thinking like changing from passive mode to attack mode
---
This is a good thing
---
You see, Thats not what im saying. You have a large player base that likes the way it is.  Now go back into your wormhole if you're not gonna be helpful.
---
ah but 90% of 0.0 Alliances are. Thats why we do what we do. now get back into your hole that gets 1 dude a month in it and rat in your haw dread.
---
he didn't though. his ping was rather measured. "Ice in our veins".
---
What’s the point of the pray unsub?
---
or just dont have structures and have the space used by WH corps
---
This tbh
---
If you're a goon, you don't actually give a shit about smaller entities. Fuck off with your false concern.
---
i just started fcing a couple of months ago, its still nerve wrecking and intense, have gotten my ass handed to me a couple of times, and handed out some ass as well. i love it, its one of the best feelings ever being in a good fight. 
---
i really want to thank Tide Mende and AncientLexy who’s been super helpful teaching me the ropes and making sure i got everything i need. you guys are awesome. and thanks to all the scouts and people helping out during fleets, we fcs couldn’t do it without you
---
The wormhole itself - probably not. People are generally fine traversing highsec by gates, and while wormhole shortcuts are plentiful, they only last a day at most, so if anyone wanted to use or sell them on a regular basis, they'd have to do it over and over again every day. So most just don't bother with finding shortcuts through j-space. 
---
As for the invasion, you can give it a shot, however it may be risky.  The Triglavians hit some systems harder than others - I would advise finding one of the perimeter systems (usually at the border of the affected area) and fighting some of the rats there. The safest option is to find some that are on a gate, and fighting them while keeping close to the gate. That way, if you find they're too tough, you can just jump back to safety. I don't think a frigate can take them on very well, and a prophecy might struggle unless it's a good fit. But if you insure your ships ahead of time, mistakes will cost little and earn you valuable knowledge.
---
I mean it kinda is and it kinda isn't i try to always take the good with the bad
---
Big facts its not like local works half the time anyway lol
---
Hunter comes tackles you opens cyno, his cyno cycle is reduced as he tackles you and is probably a cov ops and so even shorter then your normal cyno.
---
Been out of the game for around 3 years now. With all the nullsec shenanigans going on I am looking into starting casually again.
---
I have some money lying around and a few chars so think I can be self sustained for a while. I am mainly interested in small gang pvp and black ops stuff, what corps are around now that does these things? Also is looking for a Corp situated in Thera the right idea?
---
Don't let the door hit you in the arse.
---
Plenty of small groups would try to settle null if they thought they could without 300 ship fleets showing up to evict them for not paying 'protection' money.
---
As long as observatories don't just end up turning local back on again in any meaningful system, that would be good.
---
they only have enough QE He3 for another week of full service is what i took it as, and then they have to scale things back. lore wise anyways
---
Bots can dscan, but recons and cloakies can catch them, and depending on how much they hit the scan button there could be an interval where they're too slow.
---
It's safer in Test because they have a super umbrella, and if you don't, you make yourself a juicy target for all the hungry hunters who would rather deal with easy prey than have HAW dreads dropped on everything.
---
Anoms offer very little protection to people inside. Instapoint bomber into covops cyno into dead with no time to react is very much possible.
---
TL,DR:   
---
CCP: If we wanted a second Serenity, we wouldn't make a change in Tranquality.   
---
Nulltards are the reason game is dying and CCP is desperately trying to save it.
---
I pay for all my shit killing people who rat. I haven't done any Farmville in years.
---
They can do what they like. And the repercussions are theres to hold. Like i said in the post, A large player base is gonna be mad and probably stop playing. Overall not healthy for the game dont you think?
---
i meant meaningfull, active played pve content, which in best case is challengeing, solo and in fleet 😅 The pvp aspect of the game could use work too, for sure, but idk if there will be any change from the amount of players who participate. I like good pvp, which involves movement, timing and skill, a active played game style, which eve doesnt support in its current and past dev cycle. CCP did a great job with eve valkyrie, if they could implement the dogfight/free roam aspect from it in eve, pvp activity would explode, would atract even players like me who currently dont enjoy eve pvp right now. Maybe with the new cloudtech which they start testing and an engine/mechanic overhaul things will change, more or less eve 2.0 🤣
---

---
You don't need probes to see anoms and you can hunt in a covops ship, which makes Dscan useless. Covops ships aren't a massive threat in holes because they have inferior combat power, in Null they light a cyno and you die.
---
Delayed mode isn't what makes wormholes dangerous, logistics is.
---
Finally CCP put a knife into the most boring rp good bye nrds
---
Are you retarded? Like... you have to be completely fucking blind if you cannot see in what a shit and stagnant state this game is atm. If anything, this change will bring more content to your doorstep since roaming gangs might be a thing again. And if you still dont like it, go to ls where local still exists.. ccp unironically buffing ls...
---
Made me re-sub after 6 years. Now to find some carebear action to train myself, train in fleets, and learn the game again so I can get into
---
PvP again.
---
&gt;and there’s still asset safety
---
 yea about that, they were foreshadowing inRP that interbus might have problems so asset safety might not be a thing for long
---
Can I have your stuff please?
---
Thank you.
---
Implying Stainguy plays the game, or that BBTB does anything but cry on Reddit.
---
I can't imagine trying to find anything with wrecks on d-scan... a single VNI can complete what, like 5-10 sites an hour? Every single one leaves behind wrecks, it would be total chaos.
---
agreed. I am a pleb. I only had it at IV
---
It won't stick.  It'll have an immediate, negative impact on active logins, and CCP will forget about it after the test period is over.
---
Thats the same riskaverse playerbase that wouldnt undock to fight anyways except in big massive blobs... not a big loss if you ask me. Literally HTFU and stop whining
---
Players: "CCPlease remove local in null to stop bots and improve the game"
---
CCP: "Hey we think we know a way to remove local and we will let you know 48 hours ahead of time."
---
Players: "CCP you just ruined the game, how could you?!"
---
If I had my way, the reward from null would justify the risks. You want high end income with risk? Go to null. You don't want risk? Goto areas with lower reward. A meaningful choice.
---
&gt;No he's saying small groups won't take that space because it's safer to join test instead of being food for hungry hunters.
---
Or content for the neighboring big groups. Small alliances will bleed much more than now.
---
&gt;amamake you'll be left alone
---
&gt;I'll be there if u wanna be not left alone
---
This is why I left horde
---
It is entirely possible that a large chunck of that graph is bots.
---
Sounds like exciting content
---
Are people always logical?
---
Very true. I only wanted to point out the wrecks on dscan to the OP as he thought he might not be found with a combat recon.
---
I also don't expect that wreck dscan will replace normal dscan but good hunters use settings which switch between wrecks and drones and so on already.
---
it monitors intel channels and maps out hostiles moving around your systems long before you know they're there with auditory tones to alert you as they get closer
---
I too enjoy the fashionable statement that you make piloting a space potato
---
Let the salt hurling begin! As someone who enjoys roaming around in wormholes this is of little consequence to me. It just means the bigger nullsec corps will actually have to work together and communicate more effectively in order to overcome these obstacles, boo hoo. It's probably only temporary so I honestly don't see what all the crying is about, people have been screaming for different content for years and now it's here people still bitch. Only in Eve online!  
---
Kudos to CCP for having the balls to try something new and shake shit up.
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH CCP?
---
Meh.   Too little to late CCP.
---
The players whining and "unsubbing" are the ones that wouldnt undock anyways... not a big loss if you ask me
---
It's almost as if afk miner pubbies have been vehemently against this change since it was first suggested.
---
If it makes you feel any better dscan is practically useless. Tacklers will be flying cloaked or in combat recons, and even if they aren't you can't know if they're friendly or hostile just from a dscan.
---
So relax and get your alliance to focus on active defense instead.
---
This all hurts some and no big deal to others
---
Ah, thought stuff like that wasn't allowed?
---
Oh shit, I guess this is about the no local stuff then right? Never mind then, that's actually pretty cool. I was just having a fit over the kinda dumb NPC's attacking like 40 structures a day stuff. Whoops.
---
*wormholers screeching from the skybox*
---
UGH! MY 47 BOT ACCOUNTS WONT BE AS PROFITABLE NOW. WAHHH
---
&gt; Unfortunately I'm not sure what aspects of the game you're referring to have been ruined.
---
I can't tell if you're serious, so for a list I'd like to direct you to any other playstyles other than "rat and stack warm bodies".....
---
he's retarded enough to be telling the truth honestly
---
but i'd rather he rmt and play the game and feed retard fits and stream than be banned
---
Who? Not memeing
---
K..... bye
---
This guy has never definitely never manually piloted.
---
Would be even better if the best it got was a delay before appearing, like while under gate cloak.
---
How many manufacturing slots does a  "Standup Manufacturing Plant" provide? I am trying to figure how how many items I could produce in an upwell structure at once but cant find any info of the number of slots provided.
---
Who wanna buy a galactic space communication antenna? Incoming starts of august! Provided by our great CONCORD lp!
---
The natural consequences will be that for a few days, braindead slobs will whine like babies when their free intel is taken away and their internet spaceship explodes. Then people will start to learn how to actually play Eve, rather than Netflix, because you still need to make ISK to PLEX your accounts and fund SRP.
---
You'll end up with a much more active player base, not bots and AFKers. You'll have a standing fleet that might actually get content, people collaborating for intel and response fleets.
---
This won't affect how OP a capital umbrella is, and hopefully that's next on the balancing block. It might reduce the amount of renting somewhat, as you'd actually have to put in some effort to protect your renters. That's fine too because it opens space up for smaller groups, who can manage the intel for 3-4 systems just fine, to live there.
---
Right now, it's still viable for new players to make isk in (easy to get into) subcaps. This shit is locking people in highsec, where most of the grand pvp EVE is known for, is absent.
---
evan mclean..... probably the best worst capital pilot in the game
---
Scope ticker: market price of salt plummets as plentiful new supply discovered amongst nullsec capsuleers.
---
The thing is, now xloaky pilot doesn't know if someone is in system, or he's alone. So it goes both ways.
---
Sure he can scan, but it takes extra effort and he can't be certain someone is around.
---
Yes, the changes seem great... there will be a time of grief... then a time of discovery, then a time to exploit and get rewards...   this changes level the field...
---
And without any ways to control connections.
---
*Laughs in wormholer*
---
this is reddit, its always serious. r/eve always right, right? :)
---
This literally gives me a reason to resub
---
that would be cutting of your noise to spite your face 
---
with no local you will want to have cloaked ships on your rateing system to see the recons comeing in to murder your blinged out ratting caps 
---
your going to have to change your play style to adapt or you will die
---
Bye turbo krab
---
Isn’t there a cooldown of a second or three seconds? Or has that gone away?
---
Next step resource depletion.
---
I like all these "you'll get more roaming gang" posts. I'm pretty sure Provi is not lacking on roaming gangs.  
---
It's going to be a shit show.
---
ccp built the game the way it is despite being told on multiple ocasions people will dig in ans turtle up and they let it happen. 
---
now they have no solution to the hot mess theyve caused other than throw npcs at it
---
can i have your stuff? now that the end is coming ?
---
Did you forget about the map? There are things in map like a metric for "average pilots in space for the last 30 minutes". Also Dotlan is a thing.
---
Money is a strong motivator to keep things easy unfortunately.
---
hi, I actually made a guide that kinda does this :) message me if you are interested
---
So what do you do then? Sit in your wormhole that gets 1 visitor a month? or do you sit in a low sec plex spamming dscan and running at the smell of something you dont like? Thousands of players in 0.0. Think about  that. Go look at some data, and tell me that 75% of the player base does not live in highsec carebear land. Then when youre talking about a 10% player base margin thats producing 50% of the economic imports to the trade hub where you buy your firetails. that 50% is a conservative estimate based on last months economic reports.
---
But who will fight them if no one knows they are there? Sounds like some top tier cowardice to me.
---
&gt;Near2
---
[http://www.evedustry.com/near/](http://www.evedustry.com/near/)
---
Yes, let's run off a massive portion of the playerbase! That'll save EVE!
---
 probably the best worst ~~capital~~ pilot in the game   
---
FTFY
---
Any RMTer needs to be purged, I don't care who it is.
---
I mean idk what youre mining empire is gonna do but we have fun and so do you, so why hate?
---
What exactly would someone have that would warrant declaring war on them to take? That died with passive moon mining
---
Why does my FPS go down to 20-30 and than become unstable when I'm on a gate? Everywhere else is capped 60 and my GPU is not even breaking a sweat.
---
So when you go down to 0.0 to farm VNI's that arent even logged in anymore what do?
---
47 bot account plexing, please do means nice cheap plex for the people who do play this game.
---
i wish someone would have tild me this all those years ago ...... sigh
---
Miners and ratters and PI gatherers will dock up for two days and only the PVP'ers who fight actual pvp ships will have anything left to do.
---
Have Dscan update automatically every 5-10 seconds, but allow players to manually update it more frequently.  Easy carpal-tunnel-free solution
---
 I am also very pleased with the new change. After all, now my bots will not be visible in the local chat. Now you can not send a complaint to the bot, because you do not see my bots. HOORAY!!!
---
He likes to welp caps for lols and views
---
RMTing isn't as bad as you think it is, the reason it's 'worse' now is because the game allows nigh 100% safe isk making in nullsec via local
---
as soon as local is fixed, people botting just add to the content of the game.
---
Let's see I cyno in my covert fleet off dscan. Get in position with fleet. Attack Target, Target now has 30 more second before his cyno is lit sounds good to me.
---
who are you
---
I'd be careful with that, CCP could send drifters.
---
Some of them are slowly going back up since he came back....
---
Making Local an unknown in NULL is great... the anxiety, the fear, the excitement and the rewards will be more powerful without local... you will have to monitor dscan, combat probe...  and ninja explore, mine, rat...  Funtastic!
---
&gt;Hello CCP.
---
&gt;Really nice you guys actually bother to say a word. I’ll make it quick.
---
&gt;You guys force gameplay upon us, nullsec, without even asking the CSM or any represents first.
---
&gt;It is true, the CSM is uneffective. But not because of the way the CSM work, but rather because of the devs at CCP.
---
&gt;The entire last week was a complete clusterfuck and the biggest clusterfuck since the boot-ini mistake.
---
&gt;I am really disappointed by the way I am being treated as a customer and thus have canceled all of my subcriptions. I have no high hopes of me resubbing then in the near future, as the last few days made me highly pessimistic about CCPs will (not ability) to take player representation serious.
---
This is your brain on official spodbrain forum posting
---
Did he? I thought that was just the life station guy
---
Where does he brag about RMT?
---
:sun: :clap:
---
This
---
Make it a deployable structure to gain back local, but also make it so a small group can reinforce it (ie. disable local) within 5 minutes.
---
If you make it a single bash with a limit of one per system it will be pretty easy to knock them out.
---
generally speaking the fights we did have in tribute/vale were good gf's panfam
---
just go right to wormholes
---
it's still better
---
No, it's perfectly fine. HTFU.
---
hes BACK ? lol and he bio massed his main lol
---
Speak for yourself chief. I get all kinds of killmails i usually got a fleet up for 4 hours a night and were always busy killing or dying so it's not my fault you dont get content.
---
Pls no spoiler alerts of meta show.
---
isk is to easy it needs to be fuel to make it where its not worth haveing ever system in a 100 jumps just because your big enouff to take it
---
It could be. The bots rely heavily on the local spam check. Perhaps they will have a dscan one now. Then recons are gonna be king.
---
technically because it only scrapes chat logs out of game it's ok
---
tbh this can still get you banned under eula
---
couldnt make the clip long enough, just go into his stream and ask him and he will tell you
---
This may happen tomorrow. I very dry k right now, and will proberly check my drunk reedits tomorrow.
---
Is the Mittanni the salty Balrog in this analogy?
---
For long time it's non-issue for me (with having A-name on main), since broadcasts are reliable shooting A-Z is more of exception than a rule in big fights.
---
Yep. I won Eve for about 9 months. When I came back I was looking for his videos because I setup my UI like his. There were about 4 videos up.
---
Use your eyes and read.
---
*I'm unsubbing* = *stop buying plex on jita*
---
I don't know why we should care what they think.
---
wtb MEGA hat
---
That is exactly what will enable roaming gangs, the fact that no one knows they are there. Fleets bumping into each other etc.
---
You open your eyes and press dscan every now and then... its not hard, even a spodbrain like you should be able to do it
---
But... but... Your stuff?
---
Reeeeeeeeeee
---
as long as they dont do away with dscan i would be ok with something in the middle
---
Perfectly fine. Just keep breathing in that paper bag.
---
Surely gonna help the content creation! ROFL.. just dockup and logoff. It's fine, we are used to that
---
I'm just here for the popcorn. Time to build some more Recons.
---
(◕‿◕✿) i cant wait to win eve.
---
If it is gonna be an automatic system, it needs to be worse than the active system, I would like to see the auto cycle time at like 10 seconds
---
buy all of them you want you still wont get it into a wh
---
If you are trying to tell me something your words would have to make sense in some way.. but they dont... so try again
---
Ah, I see. I figured he was just being his usual dumb self and confusing RMT with just buying plex off CCP's website.
---
@
---
Illegal character.
---
(✿◕‿◕✿) on pc you should try eve online, i heard there are interesting developments happening in the outer regions of the known space spicing things up (✿◕‿◕✿)
---
(✿◕‿◕✿) thank you for your hard work and enjoy the holiday ❤ (✿◕‿◕✿)
---
Maybe the best thing to do is run a mining op with a protection fleet. Safety in numbers and all
---
I do it all the time. Ive been living in 0.0 for 5 years and not once have i ever been killed while mining, ratting, or hauling. Now. My concern is the player base losing interest in it. Im sorry that you get dunked everytime you come to provi and you are a statistical number in the daily content for us. Make some friends bring a fleet and have some fun!
---
Tell that to him, he was hanging out in my home system a few weeks ago.
---
Evelite has character highscores lookup so that's a thing of the past. Now you can just right click on the person, look up, and it'll show you their killboards, stats, how many clue scrolls they have completed, etc
---
I've actually run some 10/10s with rooks just maybe not the blood raider ones for ... Reasons.
---
R/hi_im_nuts can confirm
---
I'd love to see CCP's stats on how many of those players actually unsub. 
---
The local changes have already brought back people to my Corp and corpmate's friends. More people on playing means more stuff dying, means isk is worth more, which means more people krabing, which means more content, which means more playing. 
---
Also shitters quitting while being replaced by gamers
---
This is great because 1.) Now you actually need to put forth some effort with gathering intel and maintaining security in your null systems, and 2.) It relieves the gaping hole in the story. If there is delayed local in j-space because there is no form of empire law enforcement present to keep a head count in the system, why would there NOT be delayed local in nullsec?
---
hmm I have some fitting room on that fit as well as capacitor at 58%... could I swap  Power Diagnostic System II  for damage control or a third  Ballistic Control System II  or maybe a Missile Guidance Enhancer II ?
---
Move to hs then if the game is to hard for you..
---
I can respect that.
---
The only place we could all agree to remove local... Jita
---
I wonder how long it will take before they make "local" an launchable/archorable module in space.
---
&gt; There is no pilot in this ship... This changes a lot
---
Classic stainguy, doesn't realize that the ship gets no player skill or subsystem bonuses when you aren't in the ship. Goes from difficult to scan, to easy to scan.
---
hey retard, first off the last time ccp made getting skills easier (removing training skills) the game had one of the largest population spikes in history. in addition, the magic 14, which everyone recommends immediately when new players ask what to train, takes over a year as an alpha; this is not even including other support skills, ship skills, weapon skills or the fact that fucking NOBODY joins the game dreaming of flying a kestrel
---
do you NEED those all to v? no, but to the new player the PERCEPTION is that you do to be COMPETITIVE, which ends up being extremely discouraging. ccp said at some recent event that most new players just immediately quit, i forget the exact % but its way way over half of players
---
now that you have a tiny bit of knowledge in your smoothbrain, i hope you go through the comment chain again and are able to understand what people are discussing this time
---
Your spies are really shit, can't even read the most recent ping from Mittens.
---
&gt; 50 harpies can't kill super-tanked blingy as a motherfucker Lokis while under reps, Bhaalgorns or Hics
---
its a ~800m loki lmao, also if only there was this module that teleports any subcap ship to a destination within range
---
Alright ill dub it waaay down for you.  
---
Playerbase Statistics from CCP:
---
Highsec 75% Nullsec 15% Lowsec 8% Wormholes 2%  
---
Over half of the material in the game is made in 0.0 and imported into highsec (Jita)
---
TBF it's stainguy. It doesn't shock me that he doesn't know that a renamed pos module still says the pos module in dscan, or that ships can't be immune to probing, or that when you eject, any ship is easy to probe.
---
Honestly this nothing but a small step in the right direction there needs to be more decent changes
---
I thank them for the local deletion and hate them about the dumb drufterneas. I am confused now, but will keep my subs for now.
---
He doesn't want to say HTP since i'm his enemy, but HTP.
---
r/lookatthebrightside
---
Since wormholers arent whiney little bitches like you, they can and will fight each others just like they do on a daily basis
---
wasnt allways local gone in null?
---
edit: oh wait, it was wormhole
---
Its still delayed. Just another "I play Eve on Reddit" guy.
---
Noone gives a fuck.
---
And?
---
Yah, the freakout over drifters has me wanting to resub.
---
Goddamn, this is fucking hilarious. Even more so is the fact that you're completely serious.
---
bait/10
---
No, it's all about only having a fraction of your total alliance able to sov wand .
---
amen to that m8:)
---
Cool. Can I have your stuff?
---
I guess you know that with time all ratters/miners will eventually unsub , and we will have 2k of "hunters" searching 2k of systems for someone to kill without normal market to find and reship....with that amount of online future is bright...
---
Without Jita local, how am I supposed to double my ISK?
---
There is an AUR repo for it if you are running Manjaro or arch
---
i would hate to guess at how many would quit but your not wrong on the whole i would guess more would come to eve you would be surprised (or maby not)how may people say to me they would try eve if they wasent so far behind ever one else
---
I don't think anything'd change for him TBH.
---
The difference is I'm spam clicking like a moba. Only have to press dscan once every tick
---
Calm down kiddo. Adapt or die! Actually.. just die, you would do us a favour
---
Its not like you get killed every-time you decide to rat or mine. Yes you will die now and then but you will also have time to make isk to keep your wallet growing.
---
So its not as bad as you might think.
---
not like normal you absolute weedbrain, the normal is seeing theres nobody there and moving on
---
No local is absolutely what makes it dangerous.
---
They never had it in the first place. It was just a shitty excuse they spammed whenever someone talked about how cancerous no-skill-requirement null blobs are.
---
So whats the problem then?
---
They don't show up on dscan. You have to be on grid with them to know they are in system if you don't have local chat. They can't cloak, but they have bigger combat buffs.
---
Bye krab, we will miss you lots.  Can I haz ur stuffs?
---
Some of you whiny little girls will be the first to weirdflex to your buddies about how brutal this game can be yet breakdown when the game actually becomes a little scary.
---
i hear you m8, feel the same way:)
---
Adapt also means go play TFT or something else and wait. 8)
---
Is this for real?  WH-style local in null?
---
I may have to resub my account(s) if so.
---
There goes 1/3 of Tri's active membership.
---
So using your imagination, if you have one, how do you think 30k Goon characters roaming around null with no local is going to play out for the game?
---
Content? Just a guess
---
You only get to post that you are unsubbing once.
---
This can actually make me stop winning Eve. I smell blood in vacuum.
---
CCP didnt mind you pls
---
I dont live in a wormhole though :( They are scary
---
Need remov ( 24H NPC killl information ) on Map
---
gf
---
Do you honestly believe people only play a game when another person tells them to? People will get bored and say fuck this and go play eve in another corp.
---
Very dangerous ccp. To have no local may cause mass exodus from game. Have it delayed yes but no local is not good and will hurt your subscriber base. 
---
Be very careful listening to a few vocal trolls rather than the majority. People have already been massing within large entities for safety, all you do is make this more necessary.
---
And that never happens. Only when you're trapping a group
---
How can a bot determine who is a friendly or not on d-scan? Do they just dock up EVERY single time they see ANY ship? Thats not efficient.
---
I would also argue that dscan doesnt show if you are friendly or hostile.  This would be impossible to do in a region like Delve that has insane friendly traffic.
---
There are essentially no restrictions on setting up industrial citadels, so it's not possible to monopolise facilities. It's theoretically possible to monopolise some materiels, but in practice very difficult to achieve.
---
On the other hand it *is* possible to attack and destroy citadels belonging to other players even "in town" (hisec). However you can still use indestructible NPC facilities, at significant efficiency cost.
---
Next to fix:
---
-Sov
---
-Citadel cancer
---
-Nullsec 'wars' (no such thing exists anymore
---
Autocannon, medium shield extender thrashers are fun for solo. People usually underestimate their insane dps. After learning the basics with those you can upgrade to a Hecate.
---
I don’t play eve, what does this mean?
---
I could have phrased that better. Including the not even 24h old video in the argument that way makes it sound like a big fat "i told you so", that wasn't my intention, sorry!
---
tbh I wouldn't even be surprised if he flat out said he RMTs and then shows himself buying plex off an official CCP channel
---
Thankfully K162 is still delayed.
---
Spodbrain.
---
Just went to ge-8 and the only thing that wanted to fight me was a loki and other cruisers. I was in a Hecate. Talk about being "brave". Still killed the loki so I'm not saying it wasn't fun.
---
I can't unsee a car jumping onto a windshield in that screenshot.
---
and covered in salt from all the crying nullbears
---
The new changes will for sure be a good thing if you are fan of Bombers bar :)
---
Just imagine Bombers bar now in local cloaked building up numbers to then just decloak and fuck up supers before they get the wonderful cap umbrella:)
---
If they want to mine in safety they can bear in HS, or accept that null should be a risk. This is good news for the economy and good news for eve.
---
Why not use a T3 and bring a mobile depot for refitting?
---
If there’s no local there’s no need for cloaky campers to desensitize the locals to their presence, all of cloaky camping goes out the window.  Regular cynos I still think might need some tweaking
---
My lachesis says hello
---
We should really pre-empt the bots this will inevitably spawn. One cloaked bot on each gate, automatically posting all inbound neuts to a 3rd party system. This could be used to alert player and bot alike to neuts and work near enough the same as local (although WH entries will be still unoticed until K162 appears).
---
I'm excited by this change but I'm sure drone lands and general botter space is gonna trundle on as usual. Allowing recons to cloak w/gate cloak and not create a gate fire animation could help.
---
Completely untrue.  The alliance may not, but I personally do.  I like the up-and-coming small groups doing their own business while trying to make it great.  It's not the life for me, I've done it for years and years, but my alliance affiliation does not hinder me from advocating for the small-guy.
---
Its a feedbackloop alright, from ccp to csm leaked to 0.0 block back again to ccp
---
Done people like it and some don’t. Main complaint is the pve players can’t see when hostile jumps in which makes them not want to risk expensive things
---
Let's not forget Smaug the sortDragon.
---
*bot base. Safety is not guaranteed in HS, why would null be safer if no one is prepared to defend their territory?
---
Electron are fastest tracking Neutron are most damage and Ion is the in between
---
This is exactly why I'm not resubbing yet. If they keep making game design decisions in this direction, I come back. But if this is just a temporary cash-grab attempt at all their long-lost customers, my characters will stay asleep.
---
it didn't used to be.  The very first iteration of it was something called BACON way back in like 2010ish, and CCP came down hard on that guy and said "No".  Now theres multiple versions of it and they dont seem to care.
---
Not the only streamer who had a history of bragging of RMT. Biff Parker got temp banned live on air for it.
---
What makes me laugh is everyone is screaming "goon salt" for now, until the drifters move into low and high sec space and then they will be salty. So I'm just waiting for them to move inwards and see all the people laughing start crying because they're getting hit.
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
How different is it now with vulnerability timers and entosis? I'm just saying if you hate someone dec a war and have capital fights.
---
Hope you have such a wonderful vacation from that you decide to make it permanent.
---
So..if the demand decreases, will the price of the plex decreases too? Sounds like a win win situation
---
well I suppose now we can sneak fleets into enemy space without the need for blackops and covert cynos
---
Well, I think it depends a lot on the circumstances and where you go, and of course it doesn't work every time.  Renter systems that have smallish to medium size non-botting corps who all live in the same system are a decent bet.  There's an decent chance that they'll all be on comms together and dudes will try to save the guy if you give them long enough to respond.  Horde space is OK for this too, but you'll probably be camped into their ratting pocket if you stay for too long.
---
Your comp matters too; if you fly ships in a 4-5 man gang that looks more engageable they're more likely to think they can push you off or kill you.  Bringing one juicy expensive ship may make them more keen to fight as well.
---
And yeah, your ticker matters too.  Just the price you pay for being part of the blob I suppose.
---
I dunno, this has just been my experience, YMMV of course, but when you go roaming maybe try holding that VNI or procurer for a bit and see what happens vOv
---
The performance doing that is...inconsistent, at the best of times.
---
The general break up of guns is split between Blaster (which are very short range but deal high DPS) and Railguns (which deal respectable DPS with a much longer range but weaker tracking). 
---
The meta variations aren't really THAT important and the difference for a player in your position wouldn't really be that noticeable. Just grab the same guns and load them all into your turret slots and try 'em both out.
---
i assume they will remove local then iterate out some kind of other intelligence gathering tool that isnt as straightforward
---
i always envisioned some kind of constellation chat that is based on some kind of intel structure
---
stfu idiot
---
Just remember who brought you the content ;P
---
i concur
---
You really are retarded.
---
&gt;without 300 ship fleets showing up to evict them
---
And why should big null Blocks stop blobbing small groups ?

Goon salt best salt
---
STupid pig i'm unsubbing
---
Should have been this way since day one.  Want to succeed in null, then you need to work with others. 
---
Solo krabbing should never have become ‘the norm’, that’s not what EvE was ever about.
---
Living in sov null should take work and dedication, it should be hard to justify the significant rewards there.
---
Props to CCP for (at least) trying to bring some danger and risk back to the game before we follow Serenity down the toilet.
---
The fuck you just say?
---
Cynos are the new “remove local”, here we go.
---
Goes great on the popcorn I'm eating!
---
*laughs in GSOL*
---
But why base out of conquerable null?
---
What you said is correct, but the next sentence isn't "they should take over a section of null," because there's just no benefit to having a "home" if you're not looking to get camped and dropped over and over.
---
Small groups that want space and will utilize that space aren't the group's you're talking about.
---
Black Ops need help, leave covert cynos alone.  Do what you will with regular cynos.
---
So people won’t play a spaceship game if they are under any risk of losing spaceships? 
---
Cry me a river.

---
In Albion crafting is nearly exclusive to the city hubs that have a hard limit of player owned stations. This hard limit makes it easy for a very small portion of players to control a very pivotal part of the game.
---
 In eve crafting is not limited to the trade hubs, and places to craft and refine are fairly numerous.  Travel is also more time consuming in eve, which would make controlling all crafting stations require a game breaking amount of dedication and resources.
---
To fight what you envision a cartel would mostly be intercepting supply lines between their home zones and the major trade hubs. Or causing chaos by attacking their means to obtain resources. But eve is vastly larger than Albion. There are plenty of spots in the game you can carve out as your home that will have little or no reason to do anything on anybody's terms but your own.
---
Who owns structures?
---
only shitposters will be left in local. What a timeline.

Wow great post thanks
---
Wait do people not prep their mats before warping to POCOs in null? There's literally no reason to do it out of tether.
---
That relies on other players, who I'm turn rely on local
---
I have an opinion
---
Please mark this as controversial
---
Having more???
---
Mercoxite. Be careful if digging them.
---
It's overkill, but it'll do the job and I'll take that. Props to CCP for having the balls to shake things up as promised.
---
my cloaky proteus says why hello!
---
so you're saying that nothing will change at worst?
---
Are you implying that anyone who fights and provides content for Provi is an asshole?
---
... Why though? The problem is, if you make it any worse than spamming the key, everyone will simply run an autoclicker instead of the in-game automatic mode. This isn't asking for an easier d-scan, this is asking for QoL so that my keyboard doesn't go up in flames after a month of living in new null.
---
the crying is crazy
---
the idea of needing your corpmates to scout out systems and watch gates while you pve seems exactly the kind of game eve should be
---
instead of oh someone popped up in local in my backwoods nullsytem, better dock up
---
Seems accurate :)

Something something cloaked hic
---
I'm calling that 2 years later everyone is gonna bitch and moan about this.

Such is the way of r/Eve
---
TBF no alliance in provi-bloc including Volt wanted to hold that pocket (mostly just Y-MP) mainly because HTP was constantly assaulting it.
---
If we did the same thing to KBP7 it would have gone the same way, there is nothing really special about that pocket.
---
More of what?
---
You like empty space?
---

This may be the thing that gets me to resub.

The fact it even exists is bullshit. Just another way for people to AFK even more.

     *There's plenty of room to criticize mittens and his drifter salt without strawmanning him. The issue is not having to defend space, it's being forced to do tedious whack-a-mole pve for zero reward against an enemy that can literally cheat and doesn't follow any of the same rules by which players are restricted.*
---
                   1) To be fair, the meme in question was voiced by Darius Johnson, not Mittens. 
---
                   2) High seccers don’t have to defend space either, and yet are forced to do “tedious whack-a-mole PvP against against an enemy that can literally cheat and doesn’t follow any of the rules by which players are restricted.”  I.E., The Goon’s shadowy (or not) backing of CODE, the frequent Burn Jita campaigns, or better yet, his current threat to destroy High Sec structures and mercilessly gank players (talk about unconcensual PvP!!) to “teach CCP a lesson”. And let us not forget the Great Casino War. That one went against Mittens, of course. But when he figured out what could beat him, he whined to his buds at CCP and they immediately banned all third party ISK gambling services. 
---
                    Mittens is alternately hailed as hero and villain alike, as often by friends as enemies. But his main effort is to force CCP to tailor EVE to the liking of himself (though he rarely actually plays online) and his friends. Therefore, I’d agree with your view in the Drifters..... I believe it’s CCP’s rather Nordic way of telling these whining Null superpowers to “harden the fuck up” and “get gud”.  Also, I personally, and many thousands like me , are just sick of his face popping up everywhere and just wish he would go away.
---
&gt;With the 100mn VNI death and bots/alphas/farmers switching to domi's or myrms, ships will most likely be sitting on the beacon (face tanking), instead of being off 70km. Which makes a warp-in in that dscan delay do-able.
---
That is also really just relying on the person writing the bot not changing their warp-in. If I were writing it, I'd have them warp to one of a few deadspace bookmarks when they first start before warping to an anom at range for an unpredictable location on the anom grid. If a hostile/neut ship shows up on grid, Domi/Myrm can immediately align, MJD, and warp unless the ganker gets really lucky.
---
&gt;Also, how does a bot know if the stilleto on dscan is an enemy ceptor or a friendly travel ceptor?
---
Wormholers tend to place identifiers in their ship names, but that wouldn't really work in null. I think the solution above would be enough to mitigate the risk.
---
&gt;2 &amp; 3. This is one hell of a strawman. The assumption you can place alts on every single gate in nullsec to monitor gatefires is rediculous. Even current Near2/Intel bots dont exist in every system (when they could for larger intel networks). I can see it for specific/busy ratting systems, but not for every single nullsec system.
---
They don't need to be on every nullsec gate, just the gates I'm worried about.
---
Bruh id rather try to kill a hell tanked carrier than vni botters anyday. Bring it
---
bruh 😜😜😜😜💯
---
I hate to ever be pro highsex, but it is damn easy to find an empty pocket of 0.6 and 0.5’s and pull faction drops one after another on a random teusday evening.  Weekends it’s impossible, but I had my cousin doing 6-700 mil in a 2-3 hours in an osprey Navi safe as fuck.

Good bot.

1. In nullsec, NPCs farm *you*
---
2. Local deleted

3. Half of Goons rage quit

This might be the single most successful game event in 16 years.

Taking a few weeks break isn't a problem, no different then wardecs, cloaky campers, ect. 
---
But whatever excuse you guys need to come up with is fine, you won't find content with this update.
---
No, that’s totally what’s going on, spooky.

i think the real reason carebears are upset is because it actually indicates they may have to work together with their corpmates even more to keep from dying

---
I fail to see the problem here? If he's an ass on and on, then does something good, should you not thank him and praise  the change?
---
&gt; might not be as jumpy since they can see who is in local
---
Why would they care tho ? You dont need local to drop supers...
---
GF, I’ve caught a few in my own Astero and one didn’t even fight back, and the other was fit in the worst way (expanded launcher, all low slots and rigs for cpu), and only thew 3 mixed T1 drones at me.
---
I too enjoy only looking at pictures of ships
---
Looks like bot supers are back on the menu, boys!
---
You have to give it a little time. Eve has spent years burning out and bleeding off the portion of the population who enjoys pvp, what the game is left with right now is almost exclusively risk-averse carebears who would rather join an alliance that's part of a huge coalition, as opposed to facing any sort of stimulating or rewarding gameplay. Sure, Eve will bleed some of the useless people currently ruining the game, but pvpers should start coming back too, with local going.
---
CCP can't figure out how to do XMPP properly. So instead of fixing it they're doing this.
---
I mean, most afk-ratting ships are going to run more DDAs than most hunters are willing/able to fit points. 
---
Add in the fact that the VNI is going away, smart botters will be switching to Myrm/Domis. It'd be simple enough to trigger an MJD as soon as the hunter shows on grid.
---
The only way I can think of to basically guarantee success is a camp or logoff trap with a covert-capable vessel that can immediately lock after getting into scram range prior to dropping cloak.
---
At which point, you're testing your patience versus whatever "all clear" time length the bots have programmed. Suitable enough for a campaign, but they'd be safe enough from random roams since most people roaming aren't wanting to stick around for 30 minutes to catch a single Myrm or whatever.

---
Ah cheers, I’ll have to double check if alphas can use T2 Rigs. Are they 100% needed or are the T2s just a nice bonus?
---
So you're saying mining and producing T2 ships will become insanely profitable for those willing to take risks? Sounds like working as intended to me.

i don't play eve and i probably never will. it seems way too complex for me and i get overwhelmed pretty easily if there's a lot of new information/systems/whatever being thrown at me. but i'm so glad that you guys and so many others enjoy the game so much because i always love reading stories about the stuff that happens in eve.
---
when stories about the drifter invasion popped up on my feed last week right as it was starting to happen, i started getting hungry for more and started reading more about the game world and actively following this subreddit and seeing it all unfold live is so cool.

i hope y'all have lovely weekends and don't stop doing your thing, because this is by far one of the coolest moments in gaming i've had the pleasure of experiencing (✿◠‿◠)

This is already a thing, prime the module
---
Nope. The elephant in the room is the moderation of the game, CCP has hired a GM team that has neutered its player base and they CANT return. No gamer would join a MMO knowing they can lose everything at the whims of a SJW GM team.
---
No, press V or die!

It's a scam

Well they gonna salt harder now that local will be gone.

So then this will hurt the little guy even more pushing them into large groups. Goons, test, and ph can easily manage multiple timers and have proved it multiple times. While I'm not against removing local I dont believe its going to do all the things people are hoping for
---
5 minute delay would be cool as a permanent feature.
---
I mean I can do that too - in the form of disabling the subscription information
---
Aren’t you guys going to be busy burning high sec anyway?
---
I found this post both insightful and enlightening.
---
Yeah, South Africa is not dangerous as long as you walk with 10 bodyguards and full armor.
---
tbf anyone who calls Star Citizen a legit game triggers a lot of (admittedly justified) salt too
---
&gt;And why would big null Blocks stop blobbing small groups ?
---
burnout, probably. If they condensed their space a lot, that's a lot more area for other groups to interfere with and push into more easily, meaning a lot more space for big null blocks to have to constantly clean out, if they're not occupying the space themselves with structures and sov holding.
---
If 30k goons actually went roaming it would be amazing.

someone called this  happening earlier this week, good shit
---
Hey guess what?
---
The game is better off without you.
---
Probably your most intelligible post so far tbfh
---
I miss you bb
---
Get a another rev pls
---
the new nullsec residents who fight back and create risky interesting content.
---
They say laughter makes you live longer.
---
If that's the case this post just made me fuckin' immortal.
---
So true i just hope all gets wiped and see a whole new chapter new alliances taking over stuff small wars etc not the 1916 in space sim
---
And how will the protection fleet pilots be paid for their time?  50% corp and mining tax?  You can make more isk in empire than that.  There's an upper limit to the number of people that can be supported on the back of Eve's farmers.
---
This will consolidate all of the people that want to mine and rat the way they are used to under the largest blocs with the biggest cap umbrellas.  The rest will unsub.  The wolves who are slavering  in anticipation will find nothing but empty space and cynos.
---
well, there is plenty of lore backup for this. Ask your friends.  Also, if you were around a few years back, CCP showed their roadmap of structures to come. One is a communications tower for null sov that enables local .... perhaps you should just unsub until that is released?
---
Yeah no thanks :)

Given 80% of eve players play solo...
---
Have you voted in a CSM election?
---
WTF are you on about? Seriously dude. He's quoting the OP in the main text post, which specifically says, and I quote again for your sake
---
&gt;Anyways, thats how I look at it. Meanwhile the null empires are flipping out, and considering this way to look at the game, is exactly what ccp intended
---
Noone said YOU said they're flipping out.
---
k thanks, I like it
---
The only people who are upset about the local change are the folks that believe that they should be immune to PVP while in Nullsec.
---
Excuse me, but you are going against the alliance issued narrative of “REEEEEEE CCP”. 
---
Please report to the reconditioning centre in 1DQ.
---
Hey! Donate!! To us poor noobies, who cannot get to null without being blasted over and over as content... quit in style! Donate to the poor noobies who are also paying customers!
---
Wrecks can pop up on d scan so
---
Hmm I still got my good old Rook from 2013. I guess it's time to give the old girl a good cleaning and an updated fit.
---
True  cant wait  i hope drifters will bring some sov changes to null and end the bot era with hopefully the rental shit    so small alliances can hold sov again without being attacked by huge fleets if they take over 2 of 3 systems
---
See this is exactly the rub.
---
People are talking like this will just make null like wormhole space.  Not even close.
---
In wormholes you can control your entrances but critting all holes and rolling ones to potential hostiles.  You also don't have to worry about cynos.  You also don't have perfect intel - the statistics available on the in game map tell you exactly where people are and what they are doing, all of those statistics have been turned off for wormholes afaik.  So with this change, null will have all of the disadvantages of living in a wormhole, and none of the advantages.
---
You need a dog and a bigger gun  but let it begin
---
So new players should spam dscan, which only gives a few seconds to react considering warp speeds, and if they mess up in the slightest, say warp to the wrong structure instead of the one they aligned to. Or perhaps they only scan every 10 seconds or so, but happen to scan on the 9th after hostile ender system, and the hostile is suddenly already on grid.
---
A scout you say. So the new player should feel forced to either literally spam v, or spend more money on a completely separate account just to survive?
---
It is too much to ask, period. People should absolutely not be forced to spend a lot of time, energy, or money just to get by in the early stages. These people did not sign up for the time consuming WH-like mechanics. They came for the legendary nullsec wars. Don't delete local, fix the sov mechanics. Make the game exciting by enabling wars. That's how this game will be saved.
---
This guy thinks irl threats and harassment are okay. lmao
---
Said it once, will say it again. The EVE Community is an Intergalactic Treasure.    
---
Solid ayy lamo
---
How much money did you donate? Funding peoples coke habits is not a good use of money.
---
Undock and keep calm, get blasted, repeat...
---
So much like, unlock in null, mine AFK to your hearts desire, repeat...
---
People *do* live in wormholes.
---
Seems Init turned up to kinda spoil it being Feroxes vs Trig
---
Was it gotg that brought the amazing content
---
That's the best reason .
---
Would be -4 routinely undocked ships dude.  Better think before you wish people quit the game as a solution
---
Thought it was a roam until dead thing? We need more killmails please.
---
As someone who just booted their account up again for the first time in 2 years can I get ELI5?  why is this good or bad?
---
its too easier to be annoying in eve.
---
there was a fight over the highsec market in eve and neither side really won and now we all work together, and still a few rnadom small people popup but most ppl stick to the keepstar because theyve had to set their fee pretty lie.
---
tl;dr eve generally has
---
Myself and I'm sure many others will resub for this. Maybe it'll be enough to counter the unsubs
---
Fuckin hyped AF
---
I decided to try it out a month and a half ago. I still don’t have a ship! They said it’s some bug like everything and they will reset my account soonTM to fix it. I think it looks cool and it’s a good idea, but no clue if it’ll ever be a good game.
