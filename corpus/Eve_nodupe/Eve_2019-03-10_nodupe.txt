Thanks so much everyone!!! I'm still in shock, overwhelmed, and amazed we managed to pull this off, and I do mean we. Without my fellow Signal Cartel corpmates, it would not have been possible. (and they didn't realize they were helping, but that's another story. ;) )

I usually wind up playing solo, but some of my fondest memories from the years I've spent playing have been while playing with others. Just because you work alone doesn't mean you can't socialise. 
---
FWIW my brother plays solo doing industry and market PVP. He’s tried actual PVP and doesn’t much care for it, but loves making his billions and billions of isk manufacturing stuff, hauling stuff all over New Eden, buying and selling, and cornering the market on specific items in certain regions. This game is what you make of it.

Nice - I didn't even notice.

---
Honestly sounds like this is not a game for you.
---
I mean, pve content in Eve is pretty bad, except for abyssals, and those are more geared towards higher level ships. T2 or faction cruisers, with at least some bling, not something a new player would fly. 
---
The tutorial I’d also pretty basic, it teaches you some, but nowhere close to everything you need to know. Trying to learn from YouTube or something would be ok, but ultimately if you aren’t asking questions, preferably on comms (explaining something by talking is 100x easier than doing it by typing), you’ll either take a lot longer to learn stuff or just not learn it at all. 
---
And in pvp, flying solo is generally only doable if you are very good and very rich, or don’t mind not venturing outside of FW space, which gets dull after a while. (Rail Comet OP). Usually as a new player you’ll be in a tackle or ewar ship, supporting your allies who are in more expensive stuff. Or you’ll be in a cheap dps ship, in a fleet of a few dozen similar ships, all designed to  win fights by force of numbers. 
---
It’s kind of the opposite of other MMOs where you start out playing solo and have to group up for end game content. In Eve, to start you’re useless by yourself, but with a group you can be effective and pick up on the mechanics, and in a few months you’ll get to the point where you know enough and can fly good enough ships (t3d or assault frig to start with) that you can go out solo and score a few kills before dying. Although, your first trip will probably end poorly, since if you’ve never gone solo roaming before you’re bound to make a dumb mistake.

Probably? It's entirely possible that caps would be a lot more balanced if only 10% of players could use them, like back in 2010 when they were newer and rarer. 
---
But it's a pointless question to ask, because we were always gonna hit the endgame of the (super)capital meta anyway (100% adoption + mass supercap alts) and it turns out to suck. This is a problem with the supercap meta and (super)caps generally, and the only solution is nerfs to them; there's no way to un-cross the rubicon and remove 95% of the capitals from the game. 
---
That said, faction BS really are a lot more balanced than supers/titans. (So are dreads/carriers tbh, the biggest problem in the meta is the invincible supercap+fax cancer dominating every aspect of gameplay.) 
---
Did you ever come close to losing a ship?

&gt; In terms of proliferation the damage is done
---
it's also worth noting that the damage would probably happen anyway. There's no real way to prevent people from training and using the best equipment in the game, when it's so obviously superior. 
---
Injectors accelerated the rate at which people could get cap alts, and rorq alts to build caps, but they didn't change the underlying balance issues (which have been in place since, like, 2010); it just took us straight to the endgame of the meta. 
---
This is my modified fit... worked pretty well so far.  I'll upgrade more faction mods slowly.

Yes, i agree. Also possibly roles for managing certain folders, such as salvage bookmarks vs gate pings or insta docks/undocks.

Either you are open to change the way you play and not play solo or try something else. EVE is not a good game if all you want to do is pve solo from day 1.
---
Just use them when you're experienced enough to know WHEN to use them. I am comfortable flying expensive ships because I'm confident in my own flying ability. Plus, bigger is not better in EVE. A frigate has as much place or more in most fleets than a battleship, for instance. I have a guy in my corp who is the best scout I've ever seen, and you rarely see him in anything above an interceptor or interdictor, which are frigate and destroyer class respectively. But as you said, EVE is what you make of it.

Imagine aligning yourselves to an alliance full of botting scum.
---
The ability to specify a specific hull + non-abyssal modules (similar to requesting items in a contract). Could tie this to the ship scanning module to allow abyssal modules to be included in the bounty contract. 
---
Would go something along the lines of; Successfully scan Whiptail. Create bounty relative to the portion of Whiptail's fit that was revealed by the ship scanner + hull. When Whiptail dies, value of bounty relative to hull and destroyed (not dropped) modules is payed out and remaining ISK is refunded to whoever issued the bounty.
---
This would allow for the hunt and prevent exploiting the bounty reward by suiciding an Ibis for the full reward.  As far as I can tell.
---
Any solution is going to be comparatively complex and, in it's first iterations, convoluted. Though, perhaps that will result in a solid niche gameplay.

Probably because you removed them. A better example may be adverts you get on your lock screen or things like Windows Defender reporting an issue with your system because you don't use OneDrive. You can Google for more examples it's not like it's an issue only two people are talking about
---
I would recommend opening your launcher settings and selecting the "Download the full EVE client" option and reopening the launcher.
---
Full client is about roughly 12GB and 78,000 files.
---
There were two versions of each ship: the regular version and the Navy version. All 8 ships came with their respective paint jobs from the game.
---
And nice picture!
---
I like the Raven as a model. However the gray paint job on it just did not do it any favors. 
---
You worried?

That's... true I guess? What's your point?

MTU drop loot when they die. And worse, they show up as a KM for the loss too. Meaning your friend's KB is going to show a ship and an MTU within minutes of each other.
---
If anything, I suspect they were hoping that any loot which survived the ship loss, also has to survive the MTU loss, before the other guy gets to keep it. So there's 2 rolls to see if the loot fairy nabs the goods away from the victor.
---

Heavy fighters suck at applying to sub caps eh? So every ratting super using 3 heavies and 2 lights is wrong?

Supers have 3 fighter types, light fighter, heavy fighter and fighter bomber. If you don’t know this, what credibility does the rest of your post have?
---
And you have the temerity to attempt to shit on someone else for putting their ideas out there... ?!?
---
Now get all the wormholes 
---
Jester's recollection is spot-on. People here don't know/forget just how poorly the ship models sold.
---
Admittedly part of that was CCP's own doing - for example, the Navy BSes were originally only available in a 4-pack that was something like $450. But even after CCP fixed their mistakes, they still weren't selling, even at FanFest.
---
Plus they're big, heavy, and expensive to ship (especially if you want them packed well). Suffice it to say, CCP doesn't have the volume to get great shipping deals.
---
There are probably a couple hundred people at best who would actually put down the cash for new ships like these right now. They're a pretty as a princess, but the demand isn't there to make it work.
---
maybe elo will destroy the botting menace from inside?

I never said that you shouldn't use Windows, I said that you shouldn't dismiss anybody who tries to get things to run on Ubuntu. Ubuntu is pretty good for things that most people do on computers but until quite recently it's been pretty much impossible to play most games. Someone interested in open-source operating systems would take the time to find a way to get things built for Windows working in Linux. It's a hobby, just like you're hobby is playing Internet spaceships and writing bad Reddit comments.

The process that OP is talking about includes installing Steam, checking a box in the settings, and typing one command in the terminal. It hardly requires a PhD in Computer Science. There are plenty of tutorials about if you're interested.

---
The only issue with this is that large bounty hunting corporations would likely form, since the only reliable way for a Corp to catch somebody in a universe with thousands of systems is to simply have optimal coverage via a shitton of members. 
---
Then, pirates could just leave an alt in each major group, giving them decent chance of being notified of the bounty on themselves, in which case they could collect the bounty via their alts. 
---
Off of the top of my head, you might get around this by requiring bounty hunter corporations to be a distinct type of group with much tighter regulations on things like member counts. Giving bounty hunters access to information on their target’s location (i.e. system location with a 30 minute delay) making the task of hunting down a player more reliant on the skill of a pilot, rather than how close they happened to be at the moment of a bounty’s issuing. Thus, you’d make bounty hunting a job for small, specialized groups, rather than massive groups.

Hell of an achievement honestly
---
You can't do C5s with passive ships, or it would be mega-expensive blingy rattle. RRep ships are much more cheaper and effective. And you need only 3 to do C4 sites, which will give you 90mil per site and you can easily do 3 sites per hour, better skills better yield. I have not tried doing C5s, but I guess it is also doable, at least with 4 accs.

Your whole idea of "freeloaders" to give them the feeling of being punished for it is exactly why you don't understand game design and marketing.  
---
I have put forth several valid arguments, including naming some of the most popular F2P ges that put things behind a paywall. You have yet to name a successful game that is actually completely free.
---
It's my understanding that they haven't actually issued any refunds in over a year. 
---
Why would we be worried? Last time we had a party on our eastern border, things went pretty great. 
---
Incredible achievement, and well done 
---
Well done. Incredible dedication.
---
&gt; SC in it's current Alpha form actually has more content than most fully released games.
---
Come on. 
---
Fabulous job, Katia! Well done!
---
Its in the agency, im sure
---
VNI ratting is easily 50m/hour unless you are shit.  
---
Incursions are at least 120m/h unless you are shit, pre LP.  (There is little risk in incursion running, less than old school belt ratting)  
---
Carrier ratting is around 120-150m/h with high skills (SP and player skill).  
---
They aren't being punished. That is what you are failing to understand. It is entirely possible to go Omega without L4s and 5s. 
---
This game literally funds itself primarily from subscriptions and PLEX sales, something that Alpha players are not doing, with rare exceptions.
---
I think the [5] verse Xetic is about the funniest video I've seen in Eve.

you can lose the match with your team mates dead but yourself still alive.

idk, in lore perspective Anoikis might be god-knows-how-much lightyears away from New Eden. The Ansiblex range might not be enough.

So then your complaint becomes your ship cannot solo kill another ship?

If you go on thingiverse, type Eve Online in the search bar to find the models. I’m currently making a keepstar for a friend. It’ll be 3ft tall. I’m having to print it in sections.

agency counters where set zero when it started so 2/3'ds wouldn't be counted

People use the note feature in game? I just use a spreadsheet to keep track of that info

Well since no one at ccp has backbone to own up to it ill blame them all.

this is all a ruse to get ALL the chinamen to vote ELO and BIGCHOLS for csm

The Enough Feroxes Postulate:   
---
For any given fleet-comp, there exists a number **N** of Feroxes that will dunk upon it. 
---
Can confirm, first I used to be a lonely and miserable individual. After joining Sansha's I'm a "not so lonely anymore" and miserable drone out of billions.
---
While this game isn't on rails -- like at all. You could easily hook up with a group of people and follow the pack around. Dedicate some time to the game and follow fleets around and just hang out. Chat on comms. Blow up and blow other people up. Eve could be single player, and you could be successful at that, but step outside of your comfort zone even just a little bit and I think you'll have some fun and make some friends on the way.
---
Honestly considering how easy it is to get around the limit and how many corps take advantage of that I can't even fathom why the limit's still in place.
---
Wasn't really thinking of the notice period to be honest as never been a problem from my perspective. You give what is appropriate for the role you do. For long term 2 months feels about right when leaving. The places I  have been its legally been at least a month either way. 
---
Not sure what it is in Iceland but when someone like CCP Guard moves on its probably going to be sad whatever notice you get.
---
I doubt it will be included this run. In fact I don't think there will be any communication. I could see it as 10k people being in system. Being able to warp. Being able to target and shoot guns. But not much else. They want to stress test the system and see what happens. See if it's feasible. And explore what the next steps are if it's successful.
---
Did anything happen to Elo or something, isn't Origin. his corp after all or am I missing something here? I thought he unblued PH / PanFam after working with them for a while because BL doesn't want to sit around with allies and all that all over the place. To me it sounds kinda wierd if they join another alliance which still is the 4th biggest.
---
Also I wonder why leave the BL alliance behind if that's also Elo's work, why not bring that with them and form a 'coalition.' If there's corps in there that doesn't want that they can leave instead of only Origin. leaving the alliance.
---
Clickbait title, thought this was going to be Penthouse Letters quality stuff.

Think the only issue I had with it was that I couldn't copy paste into or out of the game using Steam. Currently my go to is to install it with Lutris, also works like a charm.

I will attempt to remember to put it in the tub but I am doubtful, sucker is kinda heavy.

Official discontinued model sold around 2008
---
Know someone that had one, knew I liked eve and they sold it to me
---
I do the same. Atron or slasher baiting the retributions and slicers.... Act like I'm running and flip a B and tackle.  My slasher took out a 200mil+ blingy retribution heh. So satisfying.
---
If I had a Caldari model to show yes it would.
---
Me too....oh wait 😆
---
set it to whatever payout % you want
---
If you're actually undocking from Jita on a character that's being wardecced, then you ought to have a better game plan than a 500km insta. Try 10k km next time. 
---
Also nobody cares about whether T2 ships are insured. The payout is low enough to be irrelevant. 
---
Alright im gonna give it you straight. Do not play eve. This game isnt for you. You get nervous around people? Dont go to jita. everyone will there is people. Some are scammers trying to pry every last isk (thats EVEs version of money)  from your hands. Some are waiting for you to undock to just pop your ship then and there. But most want to be left alone so they can shop. This game all all about the web you weave over the time you play this game.
---
Can you play solo? Hell yes. Solo was a big part of my career. I loved it. One vs everyone. Just me my ship and will to explore. Then I got ganked. It hurt alot. I was flying something I couldn't afford to replace. I had saved so for it just to be gone so quickly. But I got back up on the horse and grinded again. I ran missions, and mined a bit as I waited for skills to train (that actually takes time unless you inject your way). I was solo for easily a year or two. It was tough as during pvp it seemed like they always had a friend so up, or the few times they didn't i knew i had they someone coming to help them because I was used to it happening so much.
---
Then i met someone, who was a local in the places i hung out who actually saved me during a fight. They third partied and i ended up alive and that sparked a "hi" in local everyonce in awhile. That turned into a "hey bad guys are coming." when they had intel i didnt. Fast forward a year and im in their corp and were moving to wormholes! After a few years and a few evictions I had many friends, shit that corp is family. We've been though the shit together.   
---
This game is harsh, this game is unforgiving. But the amazing experience you get solo, is nothing compared to with a group, be it a bunch of newbros like you in highsec, or people who took you ganked you over and over before taking you under their wing in low, or being one of many in a nullsec group. What can take you forever to learn solo is just one question away in corp, or alliance chat. 
---
Take a risk, take a chance. Dip that toe into New Eden. Maybe its for you. Maybe its not. But its free and joining a corp never hurt anyone. Null has many great places for newbros. Horde, Brave, Karmafleet to name a few. All of them are fill with people who are more than willing to help. The only stupid question is the one unasked. As for being worried about doing something wrong or saying the wrong thing dont worry about it. Most people are super easy on newbros as we were all there one time. As for gettting dragged into stuff you dont want to. Groups need people back home during wars too. Gotta keep up the ADMs and  defend your home space while the warriors are away. There is a place for everyone. You just gotta find it. 
---
TL:DR 
---
eve isnt a solo game, while it can be played solo this game is a game where the story is written by the actions of the players and the interactions between said players and the flags they choose to wave. You want to build stuff do it, You want to mine stuff do it. You want to pew pew pew pew then do it. But there aint no harm in trying....unless your in highsec...popo dont like naughty things in highsec

I’m sorry, we’re too busy insurance frauding ravens to NC. Supers to worry about Syndicate atm.  Rest assured that we’ll sort that out when we get around to it. Many ravens yet to fraud. Sorry for the inconvenience. 
---
Ah, theKiller8. His first two and last vids were so good. 
---
Bahh don’t listen to the guy that says eve is not a solo game. You literally never have to interact with anyone if you choose. If you love a deep rpg that does not hold your hand and forces you to research the web for ways to navigate its complexities you will love eve. Here is what I would do if I were you. Start eve with your own story in mind. Your fist goal could be to figure out how to have 3.0 rating with your starting faction. At that point you will have a ok idea about what part of the game fits you best. Then set a new goal for example you could say I want to be a miner and industrialist to make my own X (insert ship). Eve is about creating content that is right for you. And there is no rpg on the market that can give you more pleasure if you enjoy unlocking a games Complexities.  
---
ah well as far as not being good enough - very very few people are actually good at eve, this game is tough to learn and impossible to master.
---
I got my first serious, even-footing solo kill probably 8 months into the game (though I wasn't really solo hunting for much of that time). The first one is the hardest - I'm at a few hundred now
---
All that being said, if you're doing PVP, EVE is still typically a comparatively high-stress, and quite high-adrenaline game under the right conditions

Ohh no I have never been killed by you. Heard some guy talking about this on a pod cast and I do think it’s a cool part of eve but wow is it a scummy thing to do lol like in game scummy.... I don’t think your scum

Honestly ur just an unimaginative closed minded prick.  I would go as far as to say u might be a Trump supporter (ok ok that's too far). 
---
The idea is not that there is a direct correlation from one to the other.  I am using many hypothetical situations (seeing as neither of those two sailed at the same time in the same place) and talking about how large ships don't shoot at small ships with guns larger than the ship they are targeting.
---
Would you at least agree with that statement?
---
Would an old battleship ever shoot a 850 kg projectile at a 800 kg skiff moving at around 25 knots approximately 30 km out?
---
If not, then my analogy holds true.  If they would I would like first hand account from you mister or misses history savant.
---
Hello friend,

Impatient lol, it was a game expected for 2014 and were into 2019 with no sign of a release date. This glorified tech demo looks nice but i'm looking for a game to play, if i'm not dead by the time they figure out what they're making and come out with a release date then great, i'll look into it.
---
Ive heard stealth bombers can be used in lvl 4 fw missions, what i ask is if its possible to do the mission for Amarr with the Purifer and if so what the fit for it?
---
The wing and tunnel bits look easy to break
---
You resort to insults because your analogy is poor and you want any further legitimate discussion? Lol ok. To answer you, at 30km? No. But that range wpuld be beyond most largr guns accurately as well. It would be outside a comparible in EVE effective range. You are asking if an EVE battleship would engage a destroyer at 300km and inversely if that destroyer woukd be a threat at 300km AND stayed at 300km. No, in EVE the destroyer has to close to do damage or tackle. So, at any range that any type of modern or pre modern weapon capable of being placed on a skiff could be used? No- they would use a 40mm or 50mm light mount and the skiff would be dead. It doesn't matter the weapon type. That small ship would be dead. Analogy bad. Care to go 4 and 0? You can add in more insults, maybe call me a racist? I mean, you are going down the check list of throwing out insults and -ists. At no time in the history of ever has a small craft purposely attempted to assault an underway battleship. So if that's what you are wanting an admission of, I guess you are intimating at no time ever should a frigate ever attack a battleship or dreadnought? You've gone from a narrative to full out anger and insults and crazy circular logic to support yourself and because facts were presented you went to "lol u know history wut an idyut". 
---
I mean define risk.. Nullsec in a good alliance controlled space is way safer than highsec in most instances. Exception being newbros should understand at least how to fly theyre ship, dock, local, you know the basics.. Before theyre forced into nullsec. Players honestly follow the isk and the friends risk isnt a factor unless you play solo at least in regards to where does one live. Idk maybe thats just me.
---
I'm just kidding. Careful with that Apocalypse. It usually melts everything around it. Everything its light touches. 
---
Gank catalyst squad that takes warp ins via combat scanner probes. Same with logi, bifrost should land on logi and mjd them 100 off
---
Great guide, the only thing I'd add is the bit right at the end, you don't need to use camera snapping, holding the dscan keybind down, and clicking on a celestial/anom etc will then dscan in that direction without giving your camera drones robo-whiplash. 
---
Man that was a while ago. There was no sovereignty either, or capital ships, or player stations. Each region had 3 stations and to take them you had to shoot them with BS's until the shields were down and it was yours. 
---
Which was a boring as you think, and since this was in the gank-a-*whatever* days most people had nothing but damage mods so a lot of pvp fits weren't even cap stable running guns. So you either did it with specific fit Apoc's or pvp ships and baby sat it for an hour. 
---
Officer of his corp here, he was a newbro that quit the game about 2 years back and recently came to. We had a good chuckle regarding his loss. GF NC.!

Cap dreads - hitting sub caps is preety damn fun ( and hard ), especially when enemy fleet consists od 200k ehp damnations. Cap dreads are a big thing in whs, in k space its much less used in that way. Ratting included.
---
Next one Titan vs only supers - your doomsday cant one shot anything because of super ehp. Doomsday should be a one shot huge alpha dmg and its fun to use it like a gangster to one shot dread/fax/carrier/jf and casualy moonwalk out, a lot of risk involved hence the fun element. To you it may not seem like a big deal but trust me anyone that owns a titan being a gangster is half the reason they own a titan in the first place.
---
Fax only rep subs - Carriers are doomed. No bonus for local rep in this meta combined with their ehp and you cant properly tank anything without remote reps, dread exiting siege and trying to warp - not enough ehp to warp. Titans? Supers? no rep for them? That would be interesting gameplay - no sarcasm, would fix super ratting as noone would rat with a super anymore and a lot less solo nyx drops
---
Each of these topics requires its own post. Its not as easy as it seems. 
---
How many feroxes would you need to volley a Titan?
---
so this is what you deem reddit worthy?  if this were a fleet of 100 that got dunked by a solo bomber i could find the shit fit funny, or if he had a full cap bpo set in the cargo or had a pod mail attached with a full slave set...but this is just.....just.....completely unimportant and not worth wasting our time over.  you could have gotten a much better response by simply posting this to nc. discord or link it in local for lols.  train your reddit posting skill to at least lvl 1 before making another attempt please.  sorry, not trying to be an ass but damn bro....maybe you will understand when you sober up in the morning.  /me shrugs...
---
Ahh yes, it was so 'unworthy' that you decided to write me a novel about it. If you don't like it, don't read it. 
---
GF! Was a fun little brawl. I love newbros, what's really impressive is how the fit makes ABSOLUTELY no sense. Did he just throw on random modules and go? Is there a story here?
---
How can an alpha based in low security space fund a PVP habit? (Besides the abyss—my internet connection is a little too fickle for that)
---
It is as you said, he threw things together to try and help out and he happened to be drinking whiskey at the time. We now call it the whiskey fit

Oh lmao I’m dumb. Thought you were serious 😂

I defended an NC. player awhile back for not having rigs fit and here goes NC. shaming a player. Justice isnt served here! Lmao.

And add in the token "We support all forms of gameplay in eve and aren't trying to drive players into larger groups."
---
I was thinking the same thing, it seems weird to me.
---
Lots and lots of condors 
---
LOL, not shaming him. It's just one of those things you look at and go, 'the fuck?'. There was a post a while back here where an NC guy had Gyro's fit on his Rev, we all got a good laugh out of that one.
---
Begun, the botting wars have
---
You have 3 choices with a yolo dread. 
---
If you can't kill it and have no friends, you simply get out of its short range and it's powerless to do anything.
---
If you can't kill it and have friends, he's stuck for 5 minutes at a time in siege. When he unsieges, keep him tackled till he sieges again. Get your friends to either bring a sabre or heavy tackle and caps or ships that can shoot it out of its range or with logi that his dps can't break.
---
If you can kill it, kill it. Yolo dreads are more of a meme than anything.
---
I know, I was just joking on my comment. It's all a good ribbing by both sides imo. I honestly didn't think you were being mean posting this lol.
---
that's not little

Ayyyee, good show. :)

You misspelt sexy.

It's actually a new piece of technology in the Launcher, it reads your porn search history and falcons face retroactively changes based on what you've been looking at.

Sounds like you're describing a completely different game than EVE, because let's get real. They just changed everything with citadels and entosis and all that and it's the complete opposite direction you're describing.

Assume 2500 a volley against 45m EHP, lazy not doing resists so just using ehp. 18000 feroxes.

To be fair almost every (serious) response is to just drop caps on the Machariels.

Just in case it went whoosh, it's a reference to the Floating Nyx.

If they are an arty mach fleet, brawl AF or Talos fleet. If they are an AC mach fleet, kitey oracle/naga fleet? Trying for a serious answer.

Weird flex but k.

Just give me this as a skin for a ship and I will swipe so many damn credit cards.

Oh hey, that's nice

Umm.....why travel fit? Either roll as a super fleet or use down time. Always fit for pvp. 
---
New guy here. Why did it take so long? Is Eve just that massive?
---
Look up faction warfare. Does both pvp and isk making at the same time.
---
Arty scorpions.
---
Just so you know there is no ship that can defang 10 rattlesnakes except those rattlesnakes. Because the Rattlesnake can fit missile launchers so its not completely defanged until it runs out of missiles.

Ahahah, i remember these.

Vni is like 60m/hr, and carrier is about 100m/hr +-20m, missions w/ good lp  are about 80m/hr incursions are like 160m/hr but a l I pain in thevery ass tbh
---
Props on your candor. Think of EVE as a method of overcoming your debilitating social handicap; a place where you can experiment and the worst that can happen is lost virtual pixels or a stranger yelling at you. It worked for me.
---
Yes. And a specific skilltree to accomplish that. Plus development of skins should be planetary bound.

I'm super new to the game. How do I go about finding the higher value ores to mine? I'm getting close to being able to fly a fitted Procurer. Right now I'm just mining kernite in high sec. I wouldn't mind venturing into .4 or so. I have enough isk to replace the Procurer if I lose it.

---
Agents for bounty hunters. The only way to get a bounty is to speak to a bounty agent, receive a target character as a mission and kill him for a bounty. Higher level agents give targets with higher bounties.
---
To get a target the hunter would need to choose a time, for example 1800 to 2100, a three hour time window or something like that. He will receive a target with a minimum "activity" of for example 7 hours in the last 7 days during the time window. Activity has to be in k-space in space (not docked up, tethered or in a POS). Wormholes do not count as activity because finding people in wormholes is too hard.
---
To find a target, the hunter can view the location (solar system) and ship of the target. The target will not get a notification until the hunter enters the system. The target will get a 30 second timer similar to agression. He will be unable to dock, tether, cloak or enter a pos. To survive the target has to escape to a different system and dock up after 30 seconds, enter a wormhole or get help to kill the hunter. 
---
The hunter will also be allowed to kill the target in hisec, he will just get suspect status so the target can get help.
---
The mission will expire after one week, if the target had enough activity during the time windows the hunter will loose standings to the npc corporation (maybe concord or a new "bounty office" corporation). If the hunter is on a killmail of the target (not final blow to make group hunting possible) the mission completes, hunter gets a standing increase and the full bounty pays out.
---
TL;DR
---
Bounty hunters get a random target and information about their ship type and location. The hunter has a week to kill it. This is a very complex system but it will create awesome content and won't be easily exploitable because targets are random. 
---
Ahahahahah

Yeah I tried to get into it, had a go for about a month and just couldn’t, quit for 8 years lol and now I’m finally liking it

If you put yourself out there enough you'll succeed much more than disaster strikes. Before long you'll  make tons of money and dying in huge battles with your comrades... it's just something that's fun to do with your isk.

Ratting is one easiest way for newish players to make isk. Mining isn't really worth your time until you get to Rorqs, industry/trade etc usually requires ISK to invest and also doesn't really let you "play" the game. 
---
Not saying it couldn't be enhanced. But ratting does serve a purpose for a lot of players. 
---
Click bait you say!
---
No i seriously need pointers
---
There are 5201 system in "normal" (K-space) space, connected by a network of fixed stargates. Those are all mapped, all the time, and it's all about going through all of them (without dying, of course).
---
But there are also 2604 wormhole systems (J-space), and the connections to those are randomly appearing and collapsing all around from/to K-space and from/to J-space. Exploring all of those requires a lot more efforts as there isn't a fixed map or path one can plan and follow, and the map is dynamic and created "as you go", changing all the time.
---
So yeah: New Eden is massive indeed ;)   
---
[Katia's blog](http://blog.saganexplorations.net/) is really a great read indeed, and will explain better some of the challenges.
---
Great Job! 
---
Now repeat with Elite:Dangerous.
---
Declares anti-botting campaign. Joins the botters.
---
Classic Elo.
---
Ok you really are new,
---
Please run the start up tutorial. Some parts might not be what you are looking for in eve but it will make you aware of the user interface.
---
YouTube and google will be your friend for a long time, I suggest if something pops into your head try there first. This will not substitute for actual in game experience but it will give you some good pointers to get the ball rolling.
---
Eve is what you make of it, but remember it’s a game at the end of the day! Enjoy your stay in the mad house which is EvE.
---
Bosons or game balance.
---
Ok, bosons are easier.
---
Thanks for trying out EVE, you surely left your mark in it as well.
---
May I suggest though. Don't biomass or give your things away, its nice to have all of it still there for when CCP releases some new content if you want to go try it out, who knows, might even stream it. :D
---
That's a new way of winning Eve. Well done!
---
That would have no added value though.
---
What do you mean 'skill-point' farm?
---
Holy crap, congratulations Katia!
---
I find it amusing everyone openly talks about Frat being bottlers like it's the worst kept secret, while CCP appear to endorse it through inaction. Surely it can't be that hard to spot when you know where to look? 
---
Low sec.
---
Scary? Scary doesn’t begin to describe the [horror](https://imgur.com/LSqxPlg0 of the things he’s seen!
---
Typically, the lower you go the better the ore. People will definitely try and blow you up, however!   
---
Try and find a system that is low player population, low security rating, and ideally a belt that is outside of the 14AU scanrange of the stargates so you aren't an easy thing to find if someone is just passing through.
---
Learn to use the directional scanner, too. :)
---
But bots don't have a face?
---
because sometimes super fleets have to gate and gating at 1.25au/s is terrible
---
frat gets content on the regular and they have a robust srp wallet, if I were in charge of a solid pvp corp and didn't want to run my own alliance anymore frat is definitely a place I'd look for a home 
---
at least if I couldn't or didn't want to join nc or pl, which I'm assuming the latter is true for elo
---
I was starting to think I was the only eve player in Chicago! 
---
Amazing achievement Katia Sae! Here are some [pictures from the fleet and celebrations](https://www.flickr.com/photos/razorieneve/albums/72157690281915463). o7
---
People like to shit on frat as the low hanging fruit who aren't on here to defend themselves. While putting their fingers in their ears when their own blocs are accused of the exact same thing.
---
CCPlz ban those bots. New Eden is dying.
---
I will raise you one Picard!
---
Yeah it makes roaming a little more fun sometimes to take out something you're willing to take more risks in, plus people rarely expect you to attack
---
Man,  never got to see these earlier and man, im so happy you shared these. The big blue was the best part and had me laughing for a good 5 min
---
gate from keba to decon
---
awesome work man,this was  proffesional and  you are true explorer
---
Ha, didn't notice, same system as that video too, I wonder if their CEO sees me on intel and sends out new bros in long range fit T3s as a "teachable moment " :D
---
I don't know how to go about finding lower systems. 
---
While it is possible to use the Ingame map for finding these systems, maby this tool is easier to understand: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map
---
87.237.34.200 this should be it. Though I don't recall the URL of my head 
---
To be fair All should be perma banned. This is not a rara Alliance thing. But if certain groups are spoken about more than others. Then CCP should shine a spot light on those people/areas and remove them, it surely can't be that hard to spot in the back end of the programing. 
---
It's beautiful.
---
The problem is that CCP has not realy learned from past times too much.
---
One reason surely is that most of the guys being part of CCP are no longer around, which means that this learing process starts all over again regulary as old folks leave/get laid off.
---
But there is also a syndrome with Devs thinking that stuff that they personaly like is automatically better, even if everyone else tells them it sucks.
---
CCP has done good things, like the improvements to outfitting and addition of ghost fitting, etc. but they also *fixed* stuff that did not need fixing and thus broke it, as well as adding *features* that never got past the first itteration and thus have been in a unfinished state for years.
---
Not to mention that their balancing approaches and meddeling with the economy of Eve have broken it almost every time they attempted it.
---
From the old R64 moons problems to the Technetium Cartel of later itterations, the removal of ice belt mining and the latest changes to mining in general, i have a feeling that it rarely ever achieved what it was supposed to achieve.
---
Also their constant meddeling with ship classes that either makes them extremly Op or Up all the time instead of small, careful changes and adjustments.
---
That if spying complaints don't apply to Ubuntu they don't apply to Win10 as a whole either. 
---
What are you talking about? Fighters are op as fuck in dealing with subs.
---
They can combat refit to Arty...
---
One two falcon punch :)
---
Must be broken. Mine looks nothing like a farm animal.
---
because having only one fc is bad? 
---
ahh yeaha the insurce thing.... yeaha... killing two ships vs killing a whole fleet. but its okay, you won.
---
ok dude even tho i literally am part of neither group LUL
---
Nice one guys
---
You miss-understood what I said. So I'll reword. 
---
If I have your friend tackled and I am shooting him, when he drops an MTU I will take all the damage off your friend, whilst keeping him pointed. I will then kill the MTU and once it's dead, kill him.
---
Kill the MTU before you finish off the person you're killing. 
---
I dont know why I'm getting downvoted tbh. It shows that I was joking in my OP but this is reddit so who knows lol.
---
Which would make it a pretty decent defensive tactic, buying yourself a bit more time while the attackers take out the MTU.
---
Well, you can go beyond that, but you need to edit every single BM you want to move from personal to corp. 
---
You can't move them as a bulk. Maybe that can be changed by CCP.
---
Not really, MTUs die pretty quickly, I've never lost a target because I killed the MTU before polishing them off. 
---
Death itself, he could tell me when my time was and we can do all the crazy shit before.
---
Bosons.
---
You Dock at your local Dog the Bounty Hunter Office, you talk to an agent and she tells you there are 5 billion bounties available of differing values, you select your current region, she says there are 500 Bounties within your current region, would you like one ?
---
Bounty NPC Offers the player 3 options, 
---
1 a 6 hour Bounty Timer = 100% of the bounty - tax  
---
2 a 12 hour timer = 70% - tax
---
3 a 24 hour timer = 50% Bounty - tax
---
Player Clicks Accept on the option 1, and pays a failure deposit, and is assigned a random Bounty out of the 500 players with bounties that are within his current region, Player is given the pilots name and last known location(5 min delay ?) once accepted the Bounty Hunter gets a new status, "Bounty Hunter" which gives him a limited battle timer with his Target, from his targets perspective the Bounty Hunter shows as such with his own new flashy icon in local, and the Bounty Hunter gets the same so he can spot his mark, this limited timer allows both parties to openly attack each other in HighSec for the Duration of the Bounty Period.
---
If the Bounty Hunter Wins and gets the kill he gets his % of the bounty based on the option he picked.
---
If the Vic wins the Vic gets the Fail deposite the Bounty hunter placed to accept the bounty.
---
Use all the shit you pick up from wrecks and put them on your ships. 
---
Oh, look, a newbro. Let's laugh at him.
---
I also know where to look; every single rental alliance are riddled with them, all the big sov bloc alliances from Branch cockwise round the map to delve. 
---
From what I’ve seen FRT are no worse than any of the others and are without doubt not as bad as the rental regions everywhere.
---
I've had some different experiences. Can think of several occasions where even a few seconds would have made a huge difference.
---
I have posted your idea on the official "small things" thread. Credit given: https://forums.eveonline.com/t/little-things-small-qol-suggestions/3545/1363?u=windsigh
---
All that would do would require people to have one alt in a ship of a type that can load a cyno. And in fact, apart from rorqs, it's generally cynos being lit by subcaps that are the problem.
---
I suppose if it's PvP vs PvP that could be a different story, but usually in them situations I don't care much for loot. When I go after site runners in wormholes it's usually due to wanting their shiny modules and loot, so the MTU drop wouldn't help them and it's ganking a site runner 😊
---
Nothing happened to Elo, he is peachy. Nothing happened to Origin. or BL either.
---
Yeah, this limit is there for technical reasons that applied in 2003 (presumably to do with bandwidth issues sending them, since you can have thousands of personal BMs just fine), but I just don't believe it's necessary in 2019.
---

I used evetrader to! It was great. The best thing to replace it is a combination of jeveassets and mogul. Use a 50m subscription for mogul, it’s worth it.
---
Pure evil. I love this.
---
Fitting t2 modules on your ship is very important. You need every advantage you can get. If you sacrifice something to save a little bit of isk, it could lead to losing a fight you would've won. 
---
I think the atron is probably the best for the price.
---
The Tristan is a good new player pvp ship, but because of the drones, it ends up being more expensive than all the other t1 frigates.
---
I also think it would be a great addition to the game.
---
Oh yes, here's how it could look. https://i.imgur.com/4GKUc7b.gif
---
Peanut butter.  Everyone knows machs love peanut butter and will spend several minutes licking it off the roofs of their mouths. This should allow you plenty of time to either escape it get leashes on them. 😉
---
Faction warfare. You get into faction complexes, stay inside until the timer is captured and then it makes you earn a decent amount of LP. You can dscan the gate to know if someone is coming to bail out if you're just here for the isk, or also use the opportunity to get some PvP.
---
Suggest this in the little things on forums, maybe they'll notice

Always find it weird why people always have to quit something to focus on something else. When other things get more busy why not just step it down a notch. Give that other thing some more time and then when that's sorted just get back to it. 
---
In the past 14 years playing this game I had my little breaks. Or going from playing every day to just a few hours a week. I don't see myself saying goodbye to it because something at work came up. 
---
bad bot
---
Ratting provides plenty of meta, and crap, modules though. Super easy with an MTU.
---
I remember when this video was new. I feel old. 
---
Careful, seems like everyone who puts an idea forward here gets downvoted to hell.
---
Red One, the AI that pilots the UECNS Nemesis from "The Last Angel" webseries.
---
Any construct, living or artificial, that can wage a horribly outmatched solo war against a massive star-empire for 2000 years and wins 99% of its engagements (1% draw) is a damn good captain.
---
How would they have a bounty if they did nothing wrong?
---
Remember when people ratting in carriers were called stupid cos why the hell are you risking your carrier in a belt? Now they're called stupid because why aren't you using a super instead?
---
I laugh now, but when I first got into a thorax, I double tanked so that I could repair armor if my shield tank failed. 
---
This one time I did a roleplay attempt where I started with a rookie ship where I fit only modules that rats dropped and built the next hull tier from reprocessing other modules. I think I made it to a cruiser before I got bored senseless.
---
Can you blame him, he's stuck in there perpetually trapped staring at an eve nerd all day, the things he's seen

HTFU! 
---
Cheers, I know :)
---
Are you serious? No. CCP should investigate and ban independent of player finger pointing.
---
Yes they should you are quite right.  
---
I imagine you believe that if you steal a trophy, simple having it means you earned it right? 
---
If not, then I can't imagine how you believe there's no way for hk being evicted to mean something, but not also understand the method to achieve it can undermine the achievement. 
---
I've gotten the vibe you're a stupid smart person, but based on the degrading level of consistency of your logic I'm not sure anymore. Feel free to prove otherwise.

Asking that very question in the right/wrong channel is more than enough to get a bounty.

Tengu was my ship of choice flying through Null and it saved my bacon more times than I can count. Sadly, with the balance changes, the fit is no longer valid, but I had already completed known space by then. Loved that ship, Tengu best goo. And no plans to visit Abyssal Deadspace since they are combat in nature and PVE/PVP I have no interest in. My shakes come from exploring undetected, not being found out.
---
I told your friend. :)

Thanks! We (Signal Cartel) like to say fly clever. ;)

I'd argue a awful lot happened to BL and Origin...
---
"Oh were part of a Chinese ratting alliance now" isn't really a small pill.
---
There were 2 years in there I made no progress due to RL things going on during that time. So, actually dedicated time to the effort was more like 7 years.

LOL, now that would be funny.

Ahhhhhhhh… no. LOL. But I did take a picture of every planet in known space during that part of the journey.

Correct me if I'm wrong but Windows 10 Home and Pro both have the same hidden ads and advertising ID stuff that people complain about. Ubuntu is just one distro of Linux and there are plenty of variants of Ubuntu that just use the basic foundations of Ubuntu and build up from that, like Linux Mint and elementaryOS, if you don't like Canonical

WAFFLES had a public roam yesterday with Vexors and support. After fighting an Eagle/Basi fleet, we reshipped and headed towards Brave where they gave us a good 30+ minute brawl in mostly T1 cruisers. At one point I was repping their FC just to keep the good times going. It's amazing to me how much fun you can have in T1 cruisers, but that has always been the WAFFLES way. GF Brave and thanks to WAFFLES for putting on a great fleet. &lt;3

Thank you!

Nice tool, Although I don't really like the concept of tools that make stuff like trading etc so much easier.

I think in the context of eve, and with the coming of skill injectors, the bounty system is retarded and should be removed or, at least, replaced with something super simple, more like a statement than a full blown reward system. The way it is right now, kind of fulfills that purpose. The next iteration would be to probably just renounce it.   
---
This is my face whenever I have to look at this subreddit.

That's a very large Icon. And why not have an out of game notepad document that you can just ctrl+f. If we do get that it'll likely be accessible on your esi thing which could easily make it redundant for blue eyes, etc.

I haven't played in about a year. Have they made it easier to find relatively fair 1v1 frigate fights? I was in RvB at the time but too many people were flying very expensive clones in T1 frigs, which I thought defeated the purpose. 
---
https://youtu.be/OYOzUHnPJvU?t=14
---
Yet again you are blowing things out of proportion.
---
See the interesting thing is you never answer any questions straight up.  You always add a slight twist to make it seem like I am trying to be illogical here.
---
We we're never talking about a frigate harassing a battleship in EvE at 300 km.  I asked for your answer at 30 km.  At this range an EvE frigate can hold point on that battleship and therefore harass it.  This frigate can also shoot weapons at the battleship but to no avail unless there are 40 of them.
---
In real life, this would be like a PT boat keeping eyes on an enemy fleet and relaying their position back to the main fleet.  This happened all the time and the PT boats we're never scuttled by a 800kg round through the hull.
---
Also, Iowa class battleships are easily able to accurately fire a projectile over 30 km.  But as to my point, they are not able to accurately fire a large caliber guns at a skiff at 30km because that is just absurd.  If we are talking about a target that is another battleship or an aircraft carrier then yes the battleships of yesteryear can easily hit out that far.
---
The other interesting thing about all your claims is that you have no proof to back it up.  Blank statements mean nothing without some sort of reliable resource to back them up.  Turns out you do not count as a reliable resource because, unless you are a PhD student of WW1 and WW2 Asianic / Pacific theatre, you are no more qualified than myself.
---
Btw here's a source for my gun range claims: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armament_of_the_Iowa-class_battleship
---
And before you say that's not credible, wikipedia is accepted by many major colleges.  This follows a reliability study in the early 21st century.
---
But again I ask you, what battleship in EvE, properly fit, would even notice one frigate around it?
---
Elo has always had a fetish for having eastern allies
---
Drop your marshal and find out.
---
Since I recently did this experiment and was amazed by the results I can suggest this.
---
Easy Alpha Isk:
---
-You can run c1-c3 sites, C3 sites can be run in a VNI with the proper fit, or most battlecruisers/battleships
---
-L3 missions in a Vigilant. Rails + Webs + Hyperspatials. Easily over 100mil per hour with the right LP
---
-You can fit a fairly decent Incursion ship, whether groups will take scuffed fits/skills is up to them
---
-Null Anoms. Standardish VNI fits are fully accessible to Alphas
---
It is terribly easy to make enough to plex as an Alpha, or do enough to scratch the Eve Itch without investing anything back into the game.
---
Hopefully nothing, considering the specific concept you linked.
---
you call them belated attempts but heres the true story. NC had nothing to do with trying to defend that POS, DRONVI agreed we would try to defend it and try get a good fight if goons brought back the bombers they used to RF it the first time. when they brought Feroxes to kill it we didn't bother jump cloning.
---
Then once killed, goons started shooting the NC astra. Killah Bee warped to the citadel in an ceptor and stayed on tether then goons insta left the system. 
---
Didn't know a single ceptor was so threatening to a ferox fleet lul

If a PT boat was in range to harass (launch torpedoes) then yes, the battleship would fire everything it had at it to ward it off or sink it. It would not idly by watch it. Odds are, it would not be using the 16 inch main guns, the torpedo boat would need to close within 8km for a very light chance of a strike and within 2-4km for a better chance. If the battleship was underway and at high sea and not in a channel, within 1-2km and then it's still very unlikely for a miss. At these ranges, the 5 inch gun would be used. They were lethal to 13km with armor piercing rounds and 16km with larger bursting rounds. So to correlate to EVE terms, yes. If the frigate within 30km in EVE (to use a long point) was your torpedo boat (it would be within 8km to use torpedoes), yes it could easily be destroyed by the battleship if it decided to enter the combat envelope. Check out my namesake (with the C). The destroyers Acasta and Ardent were engaged by a battlecruiser (nomenclature at the time for a ship similar to a battleship in armament but lighter in armor in lieu of speed). They were destroyed along with a carrier.  
---
You don't have to think I am a reliable source, that's on you. But in the WW2 and post WW2 arena I have around 200 books in my house and have digested 5-6 times that number on the topic. It would mean that I have some small working understanding of the themes and topic.  
---
#So, to directly answer your question: If a skiff/torpedo boat is within range of a battleship to harass it or offensively impact it (4-8km), the same thing as if a destroyer is in range in EVE to point a battleship (14-30km) - then yes, the battleship could and would destroy it.  
---
So, what did Feps Endeshie do to you?
---
I wonder how many automated programs are already doing this. I mean, it's got to be easier to create and maintain than bots that actually have to move around in space and target asteroids/NPCs, right?
---
They could, but those are typically a bit more involved changeovers and once they refit to arty.. you go to brawl mode.
---
probably going to be slower
---
You might have heard or noticed that inflation is kind of a problem in eve... now ask yourself again...
---
They can combat refit to autocannons...

Who put the deer in headlights on the launcher?
---
Tri failing, this is a shocking development!
---
Things I'm really proud CCP did:
---
1) Created a single shard universe.
---
2) Made assets really hard to move around, creating hauling as an actual profession.
---
3) FW gated plexes. Each Plex has its own mini-meta associated with it.
---
4) Balance iterations that put all subcaps in a really good place. Specifically, balance passes on T1 ships in the cruiser frigate classes.
---
5) Wickedly huge fights are possible without things crashing.
---
6) Pretty much everything is manufactured by a player.
---
7) The UI is highly customizable and has a dedicated team that frequently addresses even minor details.
---
8) Players can easily organize themselves into tiered groups (fleet, Corp, Alliance, blue standings).  Players can easily identify if another player is a friend or foe.
---
9) The graphics are amazing.
---
10) Ship skins are really cool and are a great way for a company to make extra money without totally ruining the game.
---
11) The developers actually listen to their player base, headed by the CSM, to give FREE expansions.
---
12) CCP is doing A LOT to get rid of bots.  Just read the dev blogs.  They just can't explain the details because that would let the botters find a work-around faster.
---

I'm probably forgetting a lot but overall, good job CCP.

And yet, the botters aren't bothered

The problem is to see real results in this game you have to dedicate a decent amount of time. I mainly do/did solo roaming kiting content that I would stream. It sometimes can take hours to find anything worth fighting if you even get any content. This isn’t a login and get instant content kind of game unless you’re pveing, which isn’t my kind of game. 
---
A game shouldn’t feel like “effort” and I feel focusing that time into my real life is better time spent. 
---
&lt;3
---
Thanks. I’m sure I’ll be back sometime. No one really quits this game. 
---
A little thing called turnover. You always expect to lose your longest players over time, and they need to be replaced.
---
Of course, for EVE that's a bit more of a fundamental problem when the overwhelming majority of your meaningful content is user-created by a relatively small number of individuals, mainly alliance leaders, and their logistics FC teams... those are the kind of people a reasonable company would throw everything they have behind to try and keep. 
---
As for new players, I believe CCP is taking NPE seriously when they fix the default overview. 
---
Microtransactions and skill injectors are all about the bottom line, and not player enjoyment.
---
I'm still hella new, just got a carrier

Combat anom respawns have increased from 10 minutes to around 15-16 minutes on sisi.

I always thought the ability to hire the NPCs of a region to help you out in battle would be a pretty interesting idea. Tris ability to hire these bots shows that I was incorrect.

Hello, there are no agents for you to hand in tags to for the Angel Cartel. The easiest and fastest way is to run the Angel Sound epic arc for them while you have standings V and a Potency-75 booster in your head. This will grant you a +60% standing boost, which means it will take you from -10 to +2 instantly, and repair your standings. The only other way to raise standings to the Angel Cartel would be to run missions for them until you get storyline missions, Angels have agents in Curse and Fountain. Alternatively, you could run missions for a friendly faction to the Angels (Serpentis or The Syndicate) and gain standings to them through their allies. 
---
Mac? Or PC only?
---
They (ELO) probably got a shitload of ISK to join Frat. and make their KB look good ;)
---
They may not have won the battle but they are winning the war
---
Presumably it will decrease them.
---
Now if only it decreased them in direct proportion to how many NPCs had been killed in the last 24 hours. 
---
The previous update nerfed the respawn times of certain combat anomalies. 
---
* Haven from 5 minute respawn to 10
---
* Forsaken Hub from 5 minute respawn to 6
---
* Sanctum from 5 minute respawn to 6
---
I don't have the details on this change, but given the state of MER and the bounty income situation, and CCP's statement that they are investigating and will act to protect the ingame economy. You can hedge your bets on a similar set of respawn increases being made to popular combat anomalys again. 
---
Thanks. Ideally I want to run 3 accounts at once but if it comes to it I can run 2 on the desktop and one on my laptop. 
---
I've been playing a little bit on my laptop the last few days and it seems to be fine for one account on potato mode.
---
People leave for many reasons. Not looking to get new players means your game dies slowly.

Ok. They are invincible?

Was fun feeding to your slicer occasionally and watching your stream, always nice to watch talented solo pilots. Hope RL gives you more time in the future.

Just an update. I loaded everything of value into a prowler on one account and got it moved. I firesaled everything else including the rorq so now I'm just messing around while I wait for my corp application to be accepted or denied.

Don't suppose you know if there is a way of calculating the best remap? Evemon doesn't seem to do it anymore.

---
Abyssal sites have more wild outcomes, and are more stable in the sense that you can run them from highsec in the same system, you can get valuable skillbooks from T1s which will instantly give you a ISK boost. 
---
Wormholes are probably better consistent income if you can constantly find them, but there is higher risk in WH space than the Abyss (assuming you have the PVE part down) and you'll need to travel around the universe to find them. 
---
It’s too bad we will never see a eve II this could be something that is addressed. There should have been skill point limits so at least you knew the guys in caps did not also have the ability to fly everything else in the game

Guess you missed the 30+ titans that missed for us, Killah hoping we'd warp right into an obvious boson, and the two hour dictor gate camp that followed after we safed up.

Andy was the only person that had contact with NC. what they didn't know was I had sabres cloaked around that POS hoping for the bombers. the feroxes came 5000m from one of them which made we sweat a little, I guess if NC. knew that it could of gone differently.
---
Based on Sisi, seems like they increased each respawn time value by about 30%... i.e. a totally useless change, since it's still way too easy to get more anoms than you would ever need in a ratting system.
---
Thank you. Been so long I can't remember how to do things.

Put down the joint, unsub from r/redpill, and read the account EULA.
---
If you're not doing anything with CCP's intellectual properties, poor in-game behaviour, etc, you're fine - CCP's not making you sign a contract to buy a condo. You're agreeing that any use of their software and IP, and interactions with other clients are within the boundaries they consider "acceptable".
---
Which doesn't really affect you if you're agreeing just to delete the acct right away.
---
You should probably just suck it up and contact an attorney who specializes in corporate and contract law, and have that person help you with your dilemma!  Maybe you can get the EULA redlined to your liking before canceling your account.
---
Of course, CCP will also need to protect its interests, so expect a few rounds of back-and-forth.  Billable hours shouldn't exceed mid-5 figures.

&gt; Tech Demo
---
&gt;A technology demonstration or demonstrator model, informally known as a tech demo, is a prototype, rough example or an otherwise incomplete version of a conceivable product or future system, put together as proof of concept with the primary purpose of showcasing the possible applications, feasibility, performance and method of an idea for a new technology. They can be used as demonstrations to the investors, partners, journalists or even to potential customers in order to convince them of the viability of the chosen approach, or to test them on ordinary users.
---
Yep, it's a tech demo
---
How do you deal with the fact that angel rats constantly mulch drones?
---
The nestors are by far the tankiest ship in the fleet. They are far from invincible but you can't just counter them with some outrange gimick or by getting under their guns.
---
If you can reach the numbers required Muninns work, you can also field battleships against them or the good old counter to everything, just drop supercaps.
---
Auto Targeting System draws agro. I've yet to lose a drone or even have one take agro.
---
All of these comments telling you nothing about abyssal sites...
---
To answer your actual question, no, Abyssals aren’t completely gated behind Omega. You can run T1s (and sometimes T2 sites) with a Caracal. Drones will get eaten up, which is why I recommend a missile ship like that.
---
The type you run is also important. I didn’t have any issue with Darks in a Caracal, and the speed boost to get to cans was worth it. If you insist on running drones, don’t run Dark sites. I speak from personal experience on that.
---
That said, here’s a link to some a starting fitting, and others: https://imperium.news/abyssal-ship-fittings/
---
And if you have other questions, feel free to message me ingame @Martin Lockheart.
---
Banning them and decreasing EVE's PCU? Why would they do that?
---
If you manage your drones, you will be able to avoid losing them in a Calm. Repairs are free with citadels, and since space is littered with them, it shouldn't cost you a thing. While the payout of Calm sites is low (as expected from the easiest form of anything), there is still a chance got very high value stuff to drop. The main benefit of Abyssal sites is that you can run then wherever and whenever you want, and don't have interference from other players while inside. Always available, and supply is (almost) endless
---
That's true for most normal players. Probably going to have an impact in high density areas like Delve and for people who smartbomb havens all day.

Thanks m8. I remember being very nervous as I was a new  streamer back then, let alone having to bring my A game for those fights. Definitely a highlight and I do hope to have more of those one day. Until then, I’m sure I’ll be lurking around your channel from time to time.

Holy shit. Dumbest shit I’ve read this year so far.

I love yioul skin for the astero. How did you get it?
---
We probably would have kept reshipping and kept fighting but our FC disconnected, was unfortunate for a fight like this to end like that.

So they are more RNG based as far as loot is concerned?
---
Well I might try another couple then and see if I get any better luck.

If not I guess I'm back to the C1 and deadspace.

better to fight and fail than to stay docked up and play reddit online though.

Well I mean I can't prove it, only tell you that in my experience it has worked. obviously I am using heavies not sentries so maybe that plays into it. I do know that any other character coming on grid and splitting agro will then cause drone agro. But as I say the targeting system works for me.
---
Thanks.
---
I meant more that any decent payout be gated behind Omega.
---
I think think I will drop the drones as tbh I've never even seen sleepers chew them up that much lol.
---
Thanks for the fitting link.
---
I can see now that the payout is not great if it can be down to 6 mil/ hour so I guess this is more of a grinding mission type.
---
&gt;little risk since you’re in high-sec. 
---
Do the payouts change depending on if you open the gate in LS/HS or Wormhole?
---
Thanks, looks like drones are out then :)
---
Awesome, well done.
---
If you're hoping for a change that, essentially, removes anomalies, you're probably not going to get it. CCP clearly wants people to do the anomalies, for whatever reason. I could only speculate what that reason is, and it's fairly irrelevant to this discussion, so I won't bother. 
---
Assuming CCP wants the anomalies to remain a thing and for people to want to run them, you're going to see small changes like this, rather than sweeping changes that eliminate them. 
---
&gt;Yes you could use an alt to bring your probes but why would that be an requirement for cheaper ships when the more expensive cruiser and above fleets get it for free?
---
Now that i read it again, it makes perfect sense to have more tools in more expensive ships. I'll leave it in there so it can still be discussed.

---
Skill-point farming is where you train-skills on an Omega character, then extract those SP via skill-extractors, and sell the injectors.    
---
If you're smart about it, you can essentially have it pay for the account, plus it's passive income.  That said, market factors often make it unprofitable, and that account won't make any progress skill-wise since you're extracting everything. 
---
[https://evemarketer.com/types/49961/](https://evemarketer.com/types/49961/)
---
Yes
---
I see OP doesn't understand inflation.
---
At least they are creating content you know...
---
To add to this you can use both standings boosters at the same time for faster standing gain
---
They win some, they lose some. Such is EVE. 
---
A fully passive shield VNI can run all the anoms in a C3. It tanks about 700+dps and puts out 400
---
Battlecruisers are even easier, Drakes are so easy to use in a C3 as well.
---
Wormholer BTW
---
I think CCP have been holding back a lot when it comes to microtransactions, compared to what a lot of other games are doing. They fact we don't see more of this shows how much they care about their current player base.
---
Love how that’s his end meta for the orca. The one before that surely died because he was missing two cloaks lol. His gas huffing tfi is pretty outstanding too

---
They've pretty much taken all Pure Blind moon goo so they can afford to lose more titans if it comes to that. So I fail to see how they are smashing their face into a wall, its a pretty flimsy wall, made of wood perhaps, wind probably passes through it making a eerie noise, big o'l hole in the middle of it too.
---
Fix the GUI for alpha's and make ventures harder to kill.
---
Abysmal loot is garbage. It’s been nerfed to hell. The experience is kind of neat but the isk/hour is pretty dismal 
---
Thanks to skill injectors it is working out great
---
You don't happen to know a Texas lawyer that can advise you here, Per chance? 
---
Unless you some crazy amount of skills where you don’t care about training in anything, seems like a decent way to make somewhat passive income. 
---
This would be abused so goddamned hard.
---
Any holes a goal!
---
And yet the most egregious micro-transaction, skill injectors, probably set them on a course from which there is no recovery. 
---
It can be a decent way to have an extra omega account without needing to pay extra for it.   
---
Get a couple cloaky-cepter-cyno-saber-alts in various places, PI alts, etc. etc.   
---
It's still really market-dependent. If the ISK price for Plex is high compared to the price of Skill Injectors, you're going to have problems.   
---
And if you could kill a titan every single gun-cycle, you're going to be rather ISK-positive. 
---
AAR?

Because some certain southern alliances like to project.

How can you make a venture harder to kill?

And what is to stop TRI from doing just that? Looking at the map, apart from Snuffed out/TEST involvement during the movement op, its been pretty much smooth sailing for them in this war. They have a constellation with sov, a fortizar up, non-aggression pacts with NC, Siberian Squad, GoTG, they've coordonated with Ranger Regiment/Weekend Warriors/Conifers/G0N3 F1SS10N quite successfully and have replaced all lost titans already.
---
Much of SC operates under a single tripwire screen, and coupled with a tool called ALISON it’s essentially possible for OP to be notified when a particular system (for example one that they haven’t visited) has been located, and the all OP needs to do is follow the generated path to said wormhole and they can tick it off.
---
So essentially by just exploring and diving into wormhole chains, members of Signal were able to assist in the discovery of previously unexplored wormholes.
---
That and the fact Signal Cartel runs fleets Which although not offering PvP content, do offer a decent umbrella of concealment by which to travel under.

That's pretty good

Best isk you can probably do as an alpha would be salvaging in sov after some super. But that's pretty boring. The low SP good income things that I like involve scanning and alpha scanning skills aren't thaat great. I would still advise you to give exploration a go. Either in the pure form where you hunt relic sites or slap a probe launcher on an gila and do DED sites. (gila is probably a bit expensive at your current point though.)
---
About the income from the abyss. If something gives high income people will run it more. In the case of the abyss it means that the drops from the abyss would go down in value then. This means that in the end most high end income is similar and differences are mostly investment and taste.
---
If the low tier abyss sites are worthwhile depends on how CCP balanced the drop rates. But if the low tier drop rates would be good high SP players would run those low tier but just much faster than you as a new player. Some activities as exploration aren't that attractive to high SP players though. This is the reason why they are still good income for new players.

Basically the same sentiment as most any post on /r/Eve amirite

Dealing with the Eve community has taken its toll.

Full disclosure: I am relatively new.  One of the challenges about coming into the game as a new player is that you enter a fast running team where everyone around you has significant legacy in the game, could be over a decade, or approaching it.  This is a problem faced by any MMO that's been around for a while.  It's daunting, frustrating and no doubt responsible for a good chunk of new player attrition. 
---
 It really sucks if you join up with a socially great group of people, but they can go off roaming and you...stuck back in a Venture shooting at a rock.  Not only is the skill curve huge, surmounting the new player-legacy player social curve is as well.  Skill Injectors are a solve to bridge just that gap  and just a little bit. They are naturally restrictive in that when someone caps 5M SP, there are diminishing returns for them.  
---
Longevity is still rewarded - the members of my Alliance that are 75-130M+ Skill Points are still able to do much more, and lead much more and fly really cool capitals that I won't be in for a long time.
---
Me, I am in a sweet spot right now, able to contribute some at 3.3M SP, having used a couple of smalls.  I'll stop there for injector use.
---
All hail Bob; you do believe in Bob.... don't you?

Um, I'm not sure if this is a joke I don't get but there is gravity in space. That's what keeps the planets in orbit around the sun. Or our moon around the Earth
---
Frat does a little bit of everything. I was skeptical at first when our corp joined but in general the Chinese go all in for pvp and also have a massive mining fleet. It has been a really nice experience, more responsive than anything I experienced anywhere else. My only complaint is their USTZ is still growing so most of the action happens before I even get on.

Wait overview tabs now can have individual column settings? 
---
Give it a while - When you see how you can rake in hundreds of millions in a few hours, you'll see the diminishing returns doesn't really factor into it, players can become so wealthy (and more importantly, make  such a large RoI on their skill injectors) that the diminishing returns are something of a non factor.
---
Don't stay stuck in a venture though! Refuse to be left behind, it only takes a few million SP to be able to fly an interceptor or stealth bomber and you'll still be able to have plenty of fun. 
---
Things like capitals and blingy T2 battleships are cool things to look forward to, but they're not the be-all and end-all, honestly you'll have far more fun in the stuff which comes before them, because you'll get to use far more often and you can be much less risk-averse in them.

God, not again lol
---
ur the best
---
Rate your pain from 1 to 10, please.
---
This was part of the last two events.  "Kill a player while flying a Serpentis ship" was one I specifically remember.
---
"Don't stay stuck in a venture though! Refuse to be left behind, it only takes a few million SP to be able to fly an interceptor or stealth bomber and you'll still be able to have plenty of fun (edit: and still make a solid contribution)."
---
And that's exactly what I did :)  Pumped to the few mill and off we go (and I am having a blast!)
---
Fair enough. I feel like all in all, Tri has had a pretty good run though. Even if it's not the most consistent, it's always interesting when they're around.
---
Sorry, since the first 5 events were pve only content i started to ignore them.
---
Fly X and Kill X is only an expample of a quest, I think far more variations are possible.
---
U/paddyvaldyr, my practice specializes in Texas Law, how can we help you.
---
Idk, Z-S is quite visually fussy and potentially about as confusing to new players as the existing default. It's great for experienced players but I'm not sure newbies would like it.
---
There's not much wrong with the existing one tbh. It's just the few things that are wrong are so wrong they make it unusable. If they just sort out the colour priority it would be a fair starting point.
---
You should probably pause your reddit pvping and update to more recent events, TRI is inhabiting your region now
---
It was great fun. Thx WAFFELS for the fleet.
---
No?!
---
Ya man, how you doing? Im the alliance CEO actually\* lol   
---
"If they're telling you not to come in a T1 combat ship, just leave. They're not that socially great when you're being excluded from corp activities."  
---
I am in a good place now - and with the help of a couple of injectors (S) there's nothing I've been excluded from doing.  The SI were provided by the folks as were my new ships.  Without that wee bit of a pump - I'd be sad. 
---
I see what you mean about a means to quick balance correction.
---
He knows if you've been bad or good
---
So don't bot for goodness sakes...
---
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Super late to this thread, but
---
I played actively maybe 2 years ago, very sporadically since then. One of the locations I put a corp office in was Nein. Now, I remember this system having a single stargate - one way in, one way out. Today, I'm seeing that it has 3 stargates. 
---
Did CCP add more? Or is my memory that bad? 
---
You want to make your Venture harder to kill? Give it a fitting that it at least looks like you put some thought into it, and click the orbit the asteroids.
---
Unless they’re in intergalactic space
---
I mean there is a resemblance
---
ROFL
---
small tip on the side; don't pay for repairs yourself. Usually every Upwell you can tether to automatically repairs your ship, modules and drones for free. Just stay tethered.
---
Youyve made a statement about never loosing a war. Do you suffer from short term memory loss?
---
What exactly do you disagree with in the EULA?
---
Make it like decorations and allow us to opt in. Information control can be important in Eve and I'm not a fan of anything that adds free intel. 
---
Chosen's efforts at demystifying capitals for newbros are always amazing.
---
Это было забавно.
---
- Miniature version of Rorq invuln module
---
- Fitting bonuses to ECM burst
---
- Immunity to scrams/points; need hictor tackle
---
- "Ore safety feature" where all the pre it's carrying gets teleported to station if it dies
---
Maybe, just maybe, if they implement all this, Eve won't die.
---
First of all, wonderboy, dope name by the way, a simple check could be implemented to exclude people above a certain accuracy from this.
---
Second, if people actually managed to automate this AND get an accuracy score of 99%, that would be fucking amazing for the scientist involved in this.
---
We did not fight... we let them our former Allianze  Budies 😀.... we didnt find good enemys... we splitt and made our own...
---
set it to 100% :P because otherwise you have the system we have now, which is a waste of time
---
The fact that this is how new players view their roll in the game is so sad. 
---
Pretty good. Did a stint as a director, got busted down cause I couldn't keep up. Still tempted to kick the Canadian's ass 90% of the time. You still hang with him at all?
---
Bye
---
He is posted to the other side of the country. Talk to him occasionally tho. 
---
It's because of the small ancillary armor repairer (saar), if the mod is not on it's cap stable. You get 8 charges and it wont last more than 1m30 to consume em all if you cycle. Consider the ship cap stable. 
---
Under neut it can come problematic yet. One counter of this fit can be the td/neut slasher.
---
[FeelsOkayMan](https://imgur.com/5dFMYs1)
---
Heh.  
---
  
---
The biggest issue with EVE imo is that at least in theory it's a giant free for all.  
---
If you can't cope with sometimes being killed just because some guy with a bigger, better fitted ship floated by then it almost isn't worth playing.
---
Is nice for exploring. Right now I just add campers as -10 standing contacts and hope they don’t wind up blue to me somehow.
---
It was a difficult fap, but not impossible.
---
Alienating your existing player base while failing to attract a new one means your game dies quickly. 
---
Porkins, he burned to bright for this world
---
Eve is hinged upon the venture. We knew this day will come. 
---
If moving 500 bookmarks is a server issue that 10,000 player battle should be scrapped no =P
---
you should be able to customize it as much as you want, ie
---
250% of the in game destructive value
---
or 
---
100m per excavator killed in delve
---
I'm a returning noob. 
---
Today I escaped a gatecamp by crashing gate. 
---
Today I got into a scrap and a cyno went up and a Sin arrived. 
---
Both times I think my facial features were configured to be what I now call "Falcon Face".
---
;)
---
Maybe?
---
I do NOT free base skill injectors.
---
Still gravity there, that's what keeps everything going.
---
This is terrible advice. 
---
1. not everyone has a large fleet to move with. And even when they do they can still be caught and killed. See test move op last month where they lost a super and titan to Snuff.
---
2. Moving only at downtime isnt always possible for people, or even a guarantee of safety. Many of Ivana's super kills were supers they caught just before downtime, and killed before server shut down. They best way to survive while moving is to not get caught while moving. Hence fitting for warp speed and agility. 
---
Insults are so easy and rewarding right? Good job!
---
#2BILL PLEX
---
Have you ever smatrbombed with 4 machs?
---
What a great idea. I like the "Join other players" thing. Some kind of "Looking For Group" functionality. Sign ups. Help bring together small groups of PVP minded pilots. You could be a one stop shop for every idling, bored EVE player.
---
Who?
---
Nah, it'll be CCP math so it probably reduces it to 1 bookmark, and will destroy local while its at it and rorqs get a mining boost...
---
And the correct response is to point out flaws and suggest alternatives, rather than people throwing downvotes around, which are supposed to be reserved for offtopic or comments that don't help the discussion.
---
Brahahahahaha, yeah no. Travel fit is terrible advice. If you dont have a “huge fleet” Move during downtime. If you die then you’re bad. Your advice is as legitimate as the isk doublers in jita.
---
This game is daunting, I mean how long has it been around?  It's not really easy to just merge in.  I was fortunate, found a good, patient group - but even now, some things like skill planning, can be overwhelming insofar as I want to do all the things :)
---
The issue is that the best counter to a BS fleet is a titan fleet. 
---
The best counter to a carrier fleet is a titan fleet. 
---
The best counter to a titan fleet is a bigger titan fleet. 
---
Excellent meta for sure.
---
Ah ok, yeah that's fair - I mean, as long as it's not lower than 100%. I thought you meant like the current system where you can end up with a 20mil payout for killing a nestor or some shit. 
---
I'd be fine with exceeding 100% up to 250% or more as a payout for in-game destructive values. 
---
Wasn't there that $2000 Nyx that fell through?
---
This is good idea +1
---
initially, they did.  heck initially i did.
---
but then you see the same suggestions with the same flaws that are copy pasted day after day.  people get tired of posting long explanations
---
&gt;Ah ok, yeah that's fair - I mean, as long as it's not lower than 100%. I thought you meant like the current system where you can end up with a 20mil payout for killing a nestor or some shit.
---
why not allow it?
---
why restrict players unnecessary, if it's a shit bounty people just wont do it
---
No sorry, I should say I just slide nonpertinent information away, because you can organize them. My bad.
---
&gt; Carriers are doomed. No bonus for local rep in this meta combined with their ehp and you cant properly tank anything without remote reps, dread exiting siege and trying to warp - not enough ehp to warp. 
---
I'd say that carriers have a good niche currently in lowsec as lower-risk than dreads to drop as it is easier to sit 200k off aligned, and warp if something comes near. Doesn't rely on Fax reps either.
---
Can I have your stuff
---
INN could take a few hints from there we site .... CZ site has a lot better theme then INN 
---
&gt; As for new players, I'll believe CCP is taking NPE seriously when they fix the default overview.
---
When was the last time you looked?
---
Tried a few 1's and 3's this weekend and was super disappointed. Tons of risk and no reward. 
---
with the current state of kspace I assume literally everything will drop a cyno which is fairly accurate in my roaming experience.
---
pretty sure inn lost 90% of their viewership with the layout change
---
What's the trick to using a drake?
---
Because it disincentivizes the use of bounty hunting as a *career*, something worth seeking out when you've been assigned a contract - and instead incentivizes it as a minor reward system where it's like "oh cool, killed the thing I got 20mil." That's super lame, it's basically as bad as what we have now. What's fun about what your proposing? 
---
The free market is for economics, not fun games that are meant to have enjoyable mechanics 
---
A game without new players is a dying game. This is actually the best way to spot many of the dead mmos that just happen to still have enough player base to exist.
---
When you log in, you see no new players. You see the ever dwindling existing player base of people who have been playing basically forever. What's worse is in these games you usually see open hostility to anyone new, reinforcing the slow death spiral.
---
You're welcome! 
---
how does trade contribute to the economy? it's just reselling stuff that's already been producted, as a standalone thing it doesen't contribute in any way, paired with production it's just a way of supplying produced goods but on its own it's just a way of getting cash out of thin air...
---
The design goal is symmetrical ship models. It lets CCP mirror the texture, effectively doubling the texture resolution without actually increasing it. 
---
uhg man you're dense
---
i think people should be able to customize anything they want, and it's silly to think more customization is going to make the system worse.
---
Gravity in intergalactic space is very close to zero, and would most likely not move even an electron
---
Hey, gun boat diplomacy is a thing lol
---
By pets you mean valued allies. 
---
Can I have your shit?
---
Cool
---
I vote for an in game monument for him. Something to immortalize his status. He may be the most goofy on the team but hes the most dedicated to the community. And eve wouldn't be what it is without its community.
---
well the sov is contested since there is a war mining in rorqs while there are large bomber groups just waiting to drop on that in the area is pretty dumb and they might have a non invasion pact but not a non aggression pact since they all fought each other just a few days ago. But we will see we have only been here a week and can barley get a fight from weekend warriors TRI seem to do all the heavy lifting conifers well we have not seen them about and have no idea who Gone fission are.
---
But really doesent give a shit about you botting unless there's a huge ass backlash on reddit about it...
---
So bot ahead and don't get caught by reddit warrior and you're OK...
---
FTFY
---
This sounds just like the kind of arguments people who call themselves sovereign citizens make.
---
The daunting part is good, it adds to the intrigue of the game. People not showing new players how they can be usefully to a small roaming gang or fleet is so bad. To make it worse these same people guide new players to skill injectors. You don't need injectors to be of value to a group. 
---
Something I have told many new players in my corp is, "the most valuable thing in Eve is player knowledge, second is accurate Intel and lastly skill points. 
---
I think he needs an expert in bird law.
---
you laugh but that guy can cloak so hard not even CCP can find him.
---
Thanks for explaining 👍
---
privet drugi! My pain is at an all time high. I've got a bad back and my ankle is slowly killing me. You got any of them vicodins?
---
If he's in a player corporation, ask his space guildmates, they can see when he was last online in Corporation -&gt; Members tab.
---
What did you do to make that isk, do tell?
---
Clip is max allowable length
---
I have zero idea, but I do know that endlessly respawning anomalies could potentially foster a mega-coalition within one region. It's only a matter of time
---
All the anomalies have a 3 hour respawn time now.
---
Did some research. The respawn times on anoms has been increased. 
---
ALL of them. Must end isk faucets.
---
Wait... actually?
---
Yes and they promised to add 10 minutes for every reddit thread bitching about it.
---
I'm dense because I disagree? You always know you've won an argument when the other side starts name-calling. Take care o7
---
Pavel, does your hatred for you Russian brother goes this far?
---
The problem is doing t1-2's They are designed to get you familiar with flying in abyss space.
---
The money is in 4-5 3s are ok. So yes the good payout is kind of gated. C2 sites are more reliable 
---
We will be blue in due time. Don't worry Frul gate is green.
---
yikes dude
---
Oh yeah, only the current rich should be allowed to fly ships.
---
So... he's right
---
Lol "cry victim" ok bud
---
This subreddit is so toxic
---
Scandalous! 
---
wow this great well done friend o7
---
yikes
---
He probably meant that the disgust/fear on his face changes according to the content you viewed
---
all of them.  old respawn 10 min.  new respawn 15 min.  At least that is what i've been told.  
---
finally I will stop accidentally open that unreadable design site
---
that's...pretty sad. As a relatively new player your older pieces were a goldmine, especially since you actually gave a damn about things that aren't sov null unlike most others. At least we have NER now to fill the void of better quality game reports.
---
Only one man who would dare give me the raspberry, or may pilot my ship, Lone Starr.
---
Lol maybe they should have nerfed rorqs again then instead &gt;_&gt;
---
Mining Nerf's, actual conflict of drivers, viability of smaller groups etc
---
I would have run for CSM by now but they don't really do anything and it's a b******* political popularity contest instead of voting in people with actual good ideas
---
What do you mean by 14au scanrange?
---
The problem is that new players think the first part of the game is farming for skill injectors so they can actually do PVP. When injectors were not in the game i remember myself doing pvp in t1 stuff without the need of anything else..
---
Not really. Gravity doesn’t get anything going since in intergalactic space it almost doesn’t exist, because galaxies weigh a lot but in comparison to the distance between them its nothing.
---
The only way it could work from my understanding is if your in an escalation NOT a signature, and have the scan inhib on your grid keeping it with you in each room. But im 90% sure the assailant could just scan down the inhib and find you.
---
Honestly its a great idea but the scan inhib is soo poorly executed theres really no use for it.
---
Soo, they like nerfed the anom respawns so people would move to rorqual mining? Not trying to be smart here, but aint that whats some people will consider now? 
---
Jesus wont save you were you boi
---
As far as I'm aware we won't be shutting things down. I'll fight for a backup before that ever happens anyway. Technically it's still Jeg/Xander who are in control, but I haven't them or many other people around there in months.
---
CCP negwalleted Frat, that's not exactly inaction.
---
Holy shit this is really incredible
---
If you have intel on bots in Test, hit me up and they'll be dealt with.
---
He never joined another corp after he left his old one 2 years ago.
---
欢迎再次光临
---
Might spread Delve ratters out a little, but by lucky coincidence they just added Period Basis to their sov so I reckon they'll still have anoms to spare.
---
Test will too, given by coincidence they just added Feythabolis. 
---
Impact will be higher in places like GOTG space, parts of the east, and some neutral states where there's lots of pilots and no obvious place to spread out. 
---
weird flex but ok
---
this feature feels very logical and simple enough... for CCP to ignore it...
---
It's all about perception, not how risky it turns out to be. Players typically progress from solo PVE to coop to PVP. Which why it is stupid to force them into PVP areas.
---
Anywhere have any membership on sale? About to lapse but don't want to renew for full price if I don't have to!
---
Bro.. Eve is a pvp area.. Dont kid yourself.
---
SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE ALPHA FUCKEN MALE..
---
CAN I GET A FUCKEN CHEEEERZAH FOR JOE FUCKEN BANE?!
---
Why do you think alpha accounts were created in the first place? To function merely as trial accounts? Only short-sighted people like you with no clue how the game business works would think that. 
---
Donald Trump because, well... Make EVE Great Again!!
---
CCP did not add more.
---
&gt; Player numbers mean nothing.
---
Yes, you are indeed completely clueless
---
To many rocks out there for this to have any serious impact on anything beyond moons and mercocit.. Fuck spelling lol
---
You know what I mean
---
My thanks to Joe! As a new player I watched him and a couple other streamers while I played to try and learn a little bit about player versus player and I think he had a hand in raising me right. &lt;3
---
You think the threat of a large bomber group will deter them from mining? It's not effective harassment, they can mine the rest of the athanors while the bombers are forming up and will end playing with one bait rorqual under supercapital umbrella and entertain their non-mining members at the same time
---
while a little more skill-intensive, you can train into a gila with t2 drones and t2 rapid light launchers. this thing can easily run every combat site in the 'safety' of high sec. especially DEDs and their escalations are interesting as they rng-based drop deadspace modules which can be very valuable as in 100mil+. of course you can also be unlucky and just get faction ammo. 
---
Calls it Anoikis. Doesn't include Abysall or Jove. 
---
Easy downvote.
---
Yep. Bad news for groups like GOTG - lots of ratters, no way to add more systems. 
---
By lucky coincidence Goons and Test added entire new regions to their sov a couple of weeks back, so less effect down there.
---
Nevermind that the region we added is rental space and explicitly forbidden for Imperium krabs.
---
fight was over a fortizar from pb locals around downtime. basically we came, we saw, we got our asses handed.  
---
this has got to be bait
---
I played beta, so I'm entitled to win.
---
/s
---
Don't fly what you can't afford, doesn't mean there should be an open faucet to afford everything without any real risk or time investment. This new generation isn't used to actually putting in the time. Need that instant gratification 24/7.
---
I lost 400 more mil than I gained. And it wasn't a flex, it was to say sometimes your the fish and other times your shark. More of a circle of life kind of thing but I suppose people perceive it differently than I intended.
---
Nerf Rorquals? How about get rid of them. Nothing wrong with using Exhumers and Barges.
---
shit happens, good on ya for trying :)
---
Shhhh with your facts you'll ruin the narrative 
---
Caps are fun to fly and fun to catch and kill. We need more caps. Change my mind.
---
Looks pretty legible to me. I guess you might be confused because "INN" isn't at the top.
---
&gt; Don't fly what you can't afford,
---
This is what i mean. Only the rich will be able to afford ships if you cut off all the isk generation. 
---
TRI has lost *plenty* of wars.
---
I'm really tired of constant nerfing - it's very discouraging. It's a one way ticket to monetization of EVE. Instead of introducing new anomalies or end fucking afk VNI ratting they'll make life harder. Already it's very tight in system with juust couple plls rating now it will be a fucking nightmare. 
---
now THIS is a classic 
---
Thanks for this.  Great work
---
How about turn back injected sp to injectors and limit injectors to 5M sp toons?
---
Less rorquals, remove excessive capital proliferation, more injectors for noobs.
---
Rorquals are an excellent way to open industrial and mining careers to players without tons of accounts.
---
With two account and multi character training  you can manage to train two pro miners, one pro industrialist, pro haulers and two good pvp toons
---
Captain Marvel cuz she has a nice rack, gotta have a nice rack to fly my ship.
---
WE DIDNT LISTEN 
---
You can dock up and repair inside an Upwell structure for free too.
---
EVE should have universal basic income, ADC on all ships built in, and ship asset safety.
---
Eventually missions, but a little bit of a lot of things at first.
---
He's talking about [d-scan](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Directional_scanning), the system used to observe the space around you within 14.3au. Hunters depend on it and if you plan on lowsec mining, so should you.
---
Why don't we try to keep and appreciate the veterans that stuck with us since 2003......CCP hates veteran players 2019
---
And the ability to hover over the note icon and get a quick tooltip popup that reads it out for easier checking on things.

    e±ïµ0KìWrls(
---
?
---
Please this. As a corp that maps wormhole chains, we talk about this every day.  We abuse our comms officers with how often we ask them to clear BMs.
---
Pretty sure that's just a gimmick. If it works, your entire strategy would revolve around staying far out of range of the rats and sniping javelin at them while maintaining transversal. So great missile skills, T2 launchers, low sig armor tank, afterburner, shooting from 100km.
---
That 30K figure is concurent logged in players though.
---
If you active rat - you do it on one account (clicking scales badly).                  
---
If you ~~active~~ rorqual mine - you soon scale up to 5+ accounts.              
---
While i know that CCP wants to reduce isk inflow - but with totally ignoring rorqual issues .... for me  stuff in 2nd line is CCP main motivation here.
---
Run locator agents from time to time to see if he moves systems
---
So good  
---
So awsome  
---
Still acurate :)
---
Russell Crowe? 
---
A game should not cost so much to be fun. 
---
Slower ratting anomaly spawn rate + more resources = cheaper stuff? Or increase of isk buying power? Better for new players to gain a foothold in the economy? 
---
IDK, something, something, capital online anyways? I can see possible intentions but will it change anything overall? Probably not.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Must end *low effort* isk (and mineral) fountains.
---
Again? They did that a couple of patches ago to Havens and Sanctums.
---
We’ve maintained the same sov, Feyth remains a renter region.
---
The first time I saw this I just woke up, was in my boxers and drinking a beer. You basically judged me without even knowing. Your suffering when coming here makes us even.
---
Joe takes all the fights. Nice clip man 
---
I agree on lowsec example, they are perfect for that. However its only in that instance that it doesnt rely on support. You have to take all scenarios into account when changing stuff like that. In whs and as well in null carriers heavily rely on fax support because their reps aint stronk enough. I dont remember last time i saw active tanked carrier fight us :| To sum up, would nerf round 25% carrier application on cruiser and lower, they can still target anyone and can clear tackle on their own given reasonable time, you have jaguar which is af specially designed to hard tackle a carrier down. You dont think 1 frig can hold carrier down for like 2-3 min in current meta? Meet Jaguar. (neuts included)
---
We didn’t add anything, Feyth is and has been a renter region.

Isn't this what they've been doing for the last decade though? Eve's success as an MMO has largely been establishing its niche and reinforcing the fuck out of it. Their average player age is older than other games because they've been playing it for longer and have a somewhat slower player loss rate which has lead to their new player experience being such an afterthought until the last couple of years.
---
Fucking genius
---
He looks like he's staring into my soul with his third eye.
---
pearls before swine, m8
---
this game is great ) 
---
Hopefully only those anoms again. Super ratting profileration may be a problem, and you should have to spread those around. No reason to hurt the little guy in a VNI doing forsaken hubs for 15-20m ticks.
---
I really like the idea but as usual, the devil is in the detail (this can be gamed with alts every which way to hell and back).  I always wondered why PvP isn't part of the mission system, a limited engagement timer (similar to the duel mechanic)   
---
between 2 pilots that have matching missions (one Amarr, one Gallente.  And Gallente always wins against the slave holder scum... ).  
---
Anyway, I think its a great idea.  
---
They threw him with some spin and initial speed of positive value. 
---
I think this is a sort of valuable part of the game, too. I remember fondly cutting my teeth on t1 ships and how wild it felt when I finally got in those t2 variants. 
---
It was frustrating waiting sometimes, but it taught you to work with what you have
---
"look at all this shiny shit i'm going to let rot because i'm personally offended."
---
Well that just seems like a waste. I would love one of those AT ships, and it seems better to give them away to at least people you know instead of permanently getting rid of them if that's what you're doing!
---
But by doing this you deprive them of their value ammo shipments, I thin signal-cartel deserves a delivery agent who values and respects them
---
Is that an Mlp zebra? Lol
---
&gt; Easy fix for afk playstyle... make the rats aggro to highest threat and target the drones.
---
They already do.
---
Good bye DHB I didn't know you for long but enjoyed flying with you last year. Good luck with your RL, take care of the kid! :) Shame about your collection, but I guess it'll make the collectors rejoice at least.

Why not just give them away to random people instead of letting them go to waste?

will be removed from active game stats.

Nah nah. Exaggerations. Come back. 
---
Lmao "exaggeration"
---
I use a modified version of the Eve Uni overview.

BS.
---
I think that same intrigue in exploration is why I am staying in - I see a wide wealth of potential experiences to be had.   Today, I'm learning tackle for home defense -I can see why there are decade+players here.
---
lmao nice humble brag on ur AT ships.
---
My first group drop went swell
---
Hunter tengu gets tackled by another tengu on a gate so we drop on it, while a nyx lands on grid.  Our three blops warp out and we end up fleet warping to a "safe". We start to get fairly close to the gate we just warped from. "Are you sure we are warping to a safe?" We land 70k of the gate that now has 2 cepters burning to tackle us we throw up our evac cyno while not at jump cap overloaded our cap boosters and I jumped out 1k from being tackled assuming Overloaded point on the cepter.
---
Hey send a fellow LE guy with free time one of those AT ships, can’t say I’ve ever owned one, or give them to past friends, fly safe tho regardless, Get home to fam safe o7

Here's the same article but in a format that won't give you cancer. 
---
&gt; open hostility to anything new
---
*looks around r/eve*
---
Not if I do it first
---
I was able to run three accounts, 1 at 3440x1440 and two at 1720x1440 (snapped to either side of my monitor) on a 670 4gb and a stock clocked 3570k with 8 gigs of ram. I ran one account (the full screen one) on high (no AA) with all effects enabled, and the other two on high except I had Asteroid Environments disabled since I'd get a bit of slowdown while mining sometimes with it enabled on all three. The 1050ti and 670 are pretty comparable (1050ti is a hair faster in most things) so that should handle two at good settings and framerates no problem, and a modern i3 or even Pentium should be all you need CPU wise. Not sure what the AMD equivalent of the 1050ti is but price-wise you could get a 570 I think, which would be faster if I had to guess. You didn't specify a resolution for your monitors but anything below 1440p should be fine, and if you want higher resolution-wise you can always turn down settings if you have to
---
If you want to run 3 accounts I'd definitely go with an i3 (8th or 9th gen for 4 cores). 8 gigs of ram is doable but if you like to have a lot of browser tabs open like I do I'd shoot for 16
---
At least in my opinion anoms are getting targeted first since it's a lot easier to see their effect as an isk faucet through CCP's data metrics. Rorqs and injectors have had a greater effect on the game as a whole but their impacts are less tangible through the hard data alone. 
---
I would use this. I don't think the rewards need to be anything huge since its just for fun, some kind of token or badge to show off to others, basically achievement kind of thing. Just bragging rights should be enough imo. This isn't for making ISK, this is for setting up goals. 
---
There should be many different kind of quests, from simple stuff to more complicated stuff. Like kill x with ship y, to win 1v3 situation etc. But some of the quests should be something unexpected, maybe like use some specific stupid fit to kill something. There could be quests that reward for losing fights just to get people to fly something, like "lose 1bil ship" or "lose AT ship" 
---
Rating system could be up and downvotes, and to get your reward you have to link killmail(s). 
---
Anyway it sounds really fun and could add a lot to the gameplay. 
---
Since when was a pasty, overweight nerd deemed scary?
---
Can you link that fit?
---
You can get a pretty chunky passive shield tank for cheap. It’s a bit slow, but you don’t need that much DPS to clear C3s
---
Do you even logibro, bro? (in low sec)
---
why you come across so fucking bitter?
---
and gift those fucking ships you tool.
---
Saw V3 was up. Nice! My shitty eyes are saying TYVM!
---
vOv. bye then
---
If you feel like you're being crowded out of ratting, maybe you should take that as a sign that your space is just too populated. Pressure your leaders to expand your territory. Don't just cry about CCP, the majority of nullsec is completely empty nowadays and there's a lot of territory ripe for conquest. 
---
People got good and made new fits. The alpha reworks spurred a bit of an innovative period when it came to pushing the bounds of alpha usable ships in WH space. 
---
If isk is not an issue barghests do. but you wont get as much as you need
---
Though I like the idea, I’m not sure you know what “official” means...
---
that would be cool , but they need some crazy fuel requirement to keep going otherwise they would be OP as shit 
---
&gt;  before the retcon
---
what did they do? 
---
No one cares. Gtfo
---
can I get just a few more dots with that?
---
Pretty much the same story here. Is it just me or do you find it difficult to understand what is posted on this sub? Like everything is an acronym, meme, or meta-meta-ness.
---
You're elite honey
---
Remember that all that passive shield stuff blooms your sig and makes you easier to hit.
---
dhb i just talked to you like 21 weekas ago. hmu on discord  maan.
---
One measures a game fully availabl for play, the other measures... Well, not a game yet and quite possible a scam.
---
Defo apples to oranges.
---
Good, fuck off. Useless whiney cunt.
---
This was a fun battle! 
---
If you never undocked the ships anyways, do we even care?
---
3, ~550m nestors can do strongholds and the drifter.
---
Yes, in a massive and totally random coincidence Imperium and Test added entire regions to their sov space, a couple of weeks before a change which benefits alliances with lots of sov space.
---
Nothing to see here!
---
Contract it all to me and I will post a screenshot as proof, silencing all the haters. 
---
I post for my amusement, not theirs.
---
I had all my shit in some station that ended up belonging to Russians, ended up closing after that. I had some sweet Rapier too. 
---
You have a face? Please blink. 
---
even quitting the game doesn't change the man 
---
One of the best sources of EVE articles and news gone :(
---
Neither cz or inn are well designed. Guess UI crowd hates their job too much to work on fansites after work. 
---
Good points well made. I almost feel like lowsec needs separate rules on nullsec for capitals as it's such a different pvp ecosystem. 
---
Yeah I think all carriers need is as application or fighter max speed nerf and they'd be in an okay place; it's mostly supers and titans that are really causing issues imho.
---
The site started heading downhill when Zecora was removed as the logo/mascot.
---
I'm SC and my first PvP death was from Wingspan, and although I don't mind being shot at (it's part of the game) I never received a receipt.
---
I've been here since 2003. I still don't know everything about this game... maybe it's just because I'm a filthy casual, but hey, after 16 years I still have something to look forward to!  
---
And I can have some of your stuff?
---
A tad too rich for my taste, maybe someday though.
---
If you're trading in any capacity more extensive than selling off your loot to buy orders chances are you're using a tool to manage orders and alts in various hubs
---
Weird flex but ok. [x2]
---
wrong. AT ship value is not counted in the MER.
---
still less AT ships than bluemelon, sad!
---
&gt;Not looking to get new players means your game dies slowly.
---
no one says 'don't look for new players' dingus
---
WE DID. 
---
shut up retard
---
sure you can, how do you think things meteors work????
---
BRB starting a few more threads 
---
Fortunately the game itself and most of the rest of the player base isn't the same way, but yea we make it look pretty dismal here.
---
there's good ways to say goodbye, there's bad ways and then there is this trainwreck of a post, I'd recommend you try to get your head out of your ass
---
Even if the new regions were added for krabbing, which for Imperium at least they weren't, they nerfed anoms a couple months back and it wouldn't have exactly been a wild leap to predict they would be nerfed further.
---
Besides GOTG has almost 30,000 less members (in terms of characters not unique players) than Legacy and Imperium so surely it is only natural that they would have more space
---
These nerfs are stupid. They need to just gate the fucking things, and be done with it 
---
I'll be explaining that in an upcoming behind the scenes blog post, stay tuned!
---
First, the current isk in the game is sky rocketing. and it's not an over statement, you can look at the MER, it's a real issue in the game right now. Mining more just mean the ore has less value.
---
Then, there is a huge issue right now regarding NS systems. The largest alliance in the game can live with 30k members off a single region. It's a big issue that favorise defensive and reduce harassement, roam, and generally speaking the value of owning space. There is no point to invade space right now, because there is no point in taking it.
---
For some reason Malwarebytes is blocking CZ citing phishing concerns. Not sure what this means really or if it's a false positive.
---
For the Karbydis Tyrannos, you have to corkscrew in to him. Make sure you kill the webbing drifters first and stay out of any blue auras as they increase your signature. I always pop an Overclocker with this guy and stay outside of 50km while killing off webbers.
---
Same for the Bethnic Abyssal Overmind.
---
&gt;  This translates to massive playable area's for a game. Bigger than any game has seen before. And it's all with no loading screens.
---
No, it doesn't. Elite: Dangerous has quadrillions upon quadrillions of playable square kilometers. Same for No Man's Sky. Plenty of games are larger than Star Citizen in terms of sheer playable area. 
---
I mean seriously
---
You do not need a red safety to logi in lowsec. 
---
can i buy a cambion before you go?
---
also how do you feel about being the dude who caused Kadesh to become a meme?
---
If CCP focused on 'keeping the current player base', they'd always lose out- because everything they touch someone out there will complain about it.
---
  Jump fatigue 100%? - Cap/Super pilots in large alliances complained
---
  They nerfed fatigue to max 5 hours? - Smaller groups complained
---
  Damned if they do, damned if they don't. 
---
  People are even petty enough to blackmail CCP with their subscription (which doesn't matter anymore because alpha) unless they boost the ONE thing they do in this game. Last I checked- Eve was about adapting to change, and hardening the fuck up. 
---
Yeah that's just a piss poor svipul pilot, or this was staged lmao. The svipul is sitting at 0 speed, he locks the atron and fires one volley, then no more misses/shots by the svipul and the targeting box goes yellow (meaning no gun/module activation on the target). 
---
A svipul in offensive mode with faction ammo can hit that atron, maybe not well, but it'll hit. I mean it's possible the pilot was just a REALLY bad pilot, but most NC. dudes are well over half competent at piloting their ships. Nice kill, but getting under small arty guns? Not likely and obviously the dude either DC'ed or something else went wrong.
---
Either way nice kill.
---
fountain isn't low effort, though.
---
I would know :D
---
the only things realy needed are balance changes of all sorts. doubt the guy who has to do a little coding on that wouldn't even have a say in figuring out how to stop the things wrong in eve atm. They will in the future at some point have downtime on the coding front. So it's not like implementing this system would hurt the important stuff, nor should it. 
---
I'm all for priorizing balance etc 
---
and i did say they'd need to use different mile stones. so instead of 1:10:100:1000 use something like 10000:100k:1m:10m
---
I don't need the system, just wanted to give some insight on how it could be done, so stop acting as if i wanted them to stop doing important stuff just to add a gimmick.
---
Which they're doing? Shit takes time mate. Oh wait inb4 everyone cries about lack of new shit to attract new people, wasting dev time on 'bug fixes'.
---
wow what a shame
---
Kill the web, orbit close
---
Not quite what you are asking but your post gave me another similar idea. Having quests just so you can have some input in what to do is great but what about an app just to find other ppl to roam with? If you don't have likeminded folk in your corp/alliance or you are off TZ at that moment it can sometimes be hard to find ppl to roam with and honestly I have no Idea where I'd find some without changing corp/alliance. 
---
Maybe have an option to filter for standings so you dont get a TEST guy GOON and NC in the same group and you suddenly cant shoot anything anymore and an option for when/where to start roaming from. Bring smallgang back to EVE.
---
you usually see open hostility to anyone new
---
  &gt; /r/eve threads are full of 'this game is shit' "FUCK CCP" 'game is totally dead!'
---
  &gt; New player - "uuh... can i still try the game?"
---
  &gt;/r/eve does a full 180 spin to say TOTALLY THIS GAME IS GREAT PLEASE JOIN US HORDE IS RECRUITING LMAO
---
I hate how it's basically mandatory to run a coward cruiser, even when I don't want to.
---
This collective of shitposters and epic memers represents a small fraction of the playerbase- Give the game a shot and see how you feel. Ignore the bitter vets.
---
I'm going to be that guy that says the screenshots look better than any of the edits.
---
&gt; is very close to zero
---
titans suck now that **everyone** has one    
---

Damn, so many stupid comments on a single thread, impresive even for r/eve.

P.S. that's not botting or input broadcasting.

They're already immune to one point/scram to dodge solo pvp'ers.

If everyone was scared about being memed on reddit for every ship loss, no one would fight, and eve will truly become Serenity IRL.

Well he can't sell his IQ as it seems you crashed the market.
---
spai
---
Excuse me? It's a subscription based game. Adding micro-transactions as they currently exist in the form of PLEX etc is already incredibly greedy.
---
And what forms of PvE is that?
---
And jokes you, I don't watch netflix, I watch torrented .mp4 files.
---
I love fighting frat, they're so keen to drop the hammer and brawl- keep it up lads!
---
I hope you felt dirty while I was looking at you in your shorts :D
---
10b isk a month for every one 
---
Yeah, I got nothing lol
---
Eve is the only game I've played that I know devs by name- and met many IRL. No other game company reaches out like CCP. The most other MMO's do is the odd guest for a Twitch stream.
---
goodbye for now

Set it as your screensaver please
---
Way back when, you could actually see the distance between pos sticks, and so people could relatively tell that the anoikis cluster was 11k away. That broke the lore, so that function got removed and the actual explanation behind wormholes became.... different.
---
Oh. Im fitting this shit right now. Do you leave the "adaptive invulnerability field" on all the time?
---
Down with all the bots
---
Tackle frigs are awful for new players.  They're difficult to be effective on and they're usually the first to die.  Ironically the easiest role, mainline dps, is the most difficult to shill into by far. 
---
Interceptors and t1 tackle should be sold to new players as the eyes and legs of the fleet, the roles they're used for where they live longer than ten seconds.
---
Ewar frigates with very long range and good transversal are also better for new players than tackle.
---
so 27 cambions have been on banned accounts? I'd say you'd be missed but people stopped giving a shit about you years ago and this post seems like you know it and want attention.
---

---
RvB will take any donations and happily welp said ships! 
---
Enjoy your new job sunshine. o7
---
Just inject a rorqual, it's only a matter of time until isk/hr on anomaly will be less than isk/hr mining ochre, building t1 battleships and blowing them up for insurance ;)
---
&gt;A little thing called turnover. 
---
Sure, but everyone should recognize that EVE is a game where player retention is more important than new players.  Both are important, of course, but we're not Pokemon go over here.
---
Wait does this mean we'll see less shitty INN articles calling for other entities to abandon renter programs?
---
Crossing Zebras is awesome. From the well made posts by the editors &amp; writers to the Zecora logo, that last bit was always my favorite.
---
I hope the site stays up and more stuff gets written there :)
---
Well, if it works the way we hope it does, yeah. The whole idea is to undercut all the other renter empires and steal all their customers. We sure as hell don't NEED the income, after all. We can afford to cut things down to bare metal.
---
https://streamable.com/uknyd Best memory I have
---
We both know that probably will not happen. The prevailing thought among the bot crowd is to spread their shit among a few different groups so as to be very have their operations completely nuked. 
---
For actual humans, price isn't necessarily the major factor since anyone with a brain would be sensible enough to join horde/karma/brave, etc.
---
&gt; I prided myself on being one of the best Battleship pilots in the game even if I was trash at virtually everything else lol.
---
Do you have any gameplay footage to backup this boast.  All I remember is a raven video you did.. which lets just say does not really meet the requirements.
---
The other day when I saw that I thought, "I don't think that's great marketing." Now I read this subreddit and think ... maybe they were on to something.
---
Like, in terms of complete and utter theft of all renters from hostile orgs? Sure. Nothing works that completely. Still, if we can take a chunk out of them and fill otherwise empty, unneeded space to keep the ADMs up, why not?
---
I swear you just love arguing with yourself.
---
Eh true, and despite saying you guys don't need it, an additional income source isn't going to kill you.
---
If one of your dps people starts podding enemies, they go criminal, and you need to go criminal to rep them, iirc
---
"Someone might steal my car, better have it crushed" - OP, probably

Your account is easily protected if you 2FA both your account and the e-mail associated with your account

---
Or just drop caps its low sec
---
Is soloing on a capital even possible in a subcap? Unless the cap pilot is afk, of course
---
More new players means cheaper PLEX. 
---
Yeah, I won't deny that. More money is more better.
---
You can tell the OP is a bitter vet. 
---
There are no bad guys or good guys.
---
Reducing the number of anomalies in sovereign nullsec benefits an alliance?
---
There are a few solo cap kills floating around
---
Provided a carrier doesn't have backup a marauder can do the trick, and I know of some other fits and tricks that can make it possible
