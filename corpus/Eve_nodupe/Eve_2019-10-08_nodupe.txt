Because they have the reveal of the next expansion for that.

Easier said than done. A passive shield myrm can tank 900dps if built right. You’d have to alpha something like that to truly get rid of it, and that’s not something Trigs are equipped for.
---
I find them fun believe it or not.
---
So a dictor for bubbling and a dictor for anti-cloaking?
---

---
It would make blockade running impossible.
---
This honeatly. Even the new invasion content is decent.
---
My place is a total mess! I've unboxed my new monitor 2 days ago and everything is still layering on the ground everywhere behind me lol.
---
Not to mention cans, batteries, tissues (don't), hard disks, cables and all kind of shit.
---
What you really want is a way to totally lock down your ratting pocket.
---
That's gonna be a no.
---
Delve already gets a shitton of wormholes because everyone rolls for it.
---
Uh.. what?
---
Is that a Trig dread, or trig Titan? Geeze.
---
...and make sure to adjust your sodium intake outside of EVE to compensate for all the salt.

More like a Forward Base

Assuming basic logi support for the Jackdaws, torps don't apply for shit even with painters in defensive mode. Sure they'll die, but they are not getting volleyed, either. Meanwhile Jackdaws can simply freefire. Unless we're talking a 20+ logi wing, you will be trading 10 bombers for every Jackdaw you kill, and that's a generous estimate. 
---
With equal numbers you just fit a sebo with and missile comp with range script on every Jackdaw, drop info links, and pound the bombers anywhere on grid, MJDing as necessary. It's literally a complete counter.

&gt;Working with what I have in terms of footage and the quality needs to be compressed as to not take up 400MB on data-limited connections.

Downloadable offline version?   
---
A music player should not require internet connection anyways.
---
It's been suggested, as far as why CCP wouldn't want to develop code and do some work to program this inside the game, and create a balanced feature, who knows.

Ah, from the Invasion “mothership” sites?

Lol no mate, Null is a paddock for sheep and farmers , with the occasional wolf getting lucky. Really though, there is no threat to the heard overall,  that's the issue eve faces today, but the sheep won't ever let it be fixed again.

I meant one reward per day, not just a continuous reward. Just imagine the smart bombs in jita...

I mean that's why I said the bit about ccp it's basically the same thing
---
&gt; His point is that there is no counter.
---
lol
---
yup there is definitely NO counter to a fleet of frigates
---
Those are independent nations, which just proves my point?
---
I think you're misinterpreting the point of what I'd originally said, or aren't too familiar with the history of international geopolitics or the history of nationalism and feudalism. So I'll drop a real wall of text.
---
A state, in a modern country, usually corresponds to the historical territories of a formerly independent and autonomous nation. Generally, these nations were Kingdoms or independent Duchies/Grand Duchies, although feudalism is weird so sometimes they were also Principalities or Counties that did not have a Duke or a King directly above them. Each of these had their own rulers, armies, foreign policy, laws, culture, and language differences. As time went on however, a lot of these independent states decided to make alliances with, or outright conquer, their neighbors, especially in the 1800s, as the concept of uniting a region and uniting an entire group of people with similar language and culture became very popular. AKA Nationalism. 
---
So looking at Germany, which is a relatively country... The states in Germany correspond to the various independent powers that it's made up from. The Margraviate of Brandenburg (Which became the Kingdom of Prussia), the Free City of Hamburg, the Kingdom of Bavaria, the Kingdom of Saxony, so on. By extent of the same logic, if we're calling Germany a regional Nation-State, you could argue Austria is an 'independent German state'. Their territory corresponds to the historical Duchy of Austria. It's not a union of multiple, formerly independent nations that each have their own strong identity. It's a (relatively) homogeneous state, in the German region, that decided to be it's own separate thing as opposed to uniting with the other German states under Prussia to make 'Germany'. 
---
Thus a 'state' can still be a 'country'. In fact, countries are by definition, states. Hence why people say things like "The European States" or "The Middle Eastern States" when referring to the *countries* in that region. All a 'state' means is an organized political community. The modern concept of 'states' as a subdivision of a country is, well... A modern thing.
---
But if you want to get really pedantic, then I'll say an alliance corresponds to a country which is a Nation-State or a Region-State. A grouping of formerly independent political entities with varying levels of autonomy, each usually having their own personal leaders, laws, and rules, but sharing a common head of state, military force, and foreign policy.
---
Whereas a corporation corresponds to a state, a political entity as formed from the historical boundaries of a feudal state such as a County or Duchy. Which generally has its own leader, laws, and unique culture, that is relatively homogeneous throughout the rest of the state, with most of the people in that state seeing themselves as 'the same people', or at least much more similar than their counterparts in neighboring states. Some of these entities are independent, like Austria or Hong Kong, and some are a part of a larger country.
---
They need to go because the threaten capital ratting while not being able to be killed by capitals ratting, we can't have that.

Kinda looks like first order dread

If i can't counter it with supers, it really has no place in the game.

\&gt;rage comics in 2019
---
Not a bad idea.
---
I'm actually focusing on recruiting Alphas and turning them into Omegas. So, I've found that they are much more up for, "Yeah! Let's go get killed a few times!" Which is really nice, tbh. I can keep them in basic ships with little effort, so I thought it was a good hook to get them addicted to Eve. Get them mining with us to make some ISK fast with little skill, and do some small gang PvP in Low, Null, J-Space. 
---
I know not all of them are going to like it, but I want to be able to offer them all aspects of Eve because I'm not gonna train a bunch of whiny fucking miners. They'll either grow teeth or they'll move.
---
If we built a Palatine, we'd put a cloud of regular ass Keepstars around it to keep enemy structures 8,000km away at all times.
---
After all, you can build something like 300 regular keepstars for 1 Palatine.
---
But I like the idea of the Palatine being a AT prize
---
I have analyzed your logic, and have found it to be lacking. 
---
Please return to your basement and never express your ideas again.

It's posts like this one that make happy that OP is not in charge of game design...

People would still game it no matter what restrictions were applied. But at some point it might just seem easier to just go out and shoot at people.

Don't worry, it would get cancelled long before then

Don't worry it would get cancelled long before that

Bob forbid PvE Capitals should take a hit, or have results of changes mean players are incentivized to not use them.
---
AFAIK, there's still footage of the in gamw event floating around on YT that should show some scale.
---
Yep. I'm not afraid of CODE. anymore - but when I was new? Especially after I got ganked, I was absolutely sure I was one wrong move from getting blapped again. This made me cautious to the extreme - I wound up training heavily into tanking skills, went omega to get cloaking, etc.
---
Wrt newbros quitting - I don't think CCP's study claiming that newbros that get ganked keep playing is correct - or at least, it's *misleading.*
---
It's very likely newbros that get *support from friends or a corp* that get ganked keep playing. Having someone there to give you a good overview, explain basic game mechanics - and most importantly *why you died* - will cause them to be very interested in the game and keep playing.
---
Lack of that means you have *no idea* what you did wrong.
---
Yes exactly!!!!! So much to explore and just so much fun trying everything out!!
---
Especialy in the conduits, when you think you found the solution and are "done" with it some new idea pops out and you are like

"Waaaaait....look at the bonuses the Astarte gets...wouldnt that just smash the conduits?"

Thank you. Seem to doing the thing I wanted. Interface takes abit to get used to it, but I see data I want.
---
Not sure how reliable it is, will check it in a week or two when I'll be hauling drop to sell.
---
Unhealthy as far as game mechanics go, but expecting a player to actually be fully attentive to every aspect of current day PvE is even worse.
---
I'm quite content ratting on a second monitor while I watch TV and make less ISK doing so than the abyssal runner. That seems fair to me. Hopefully the mythical overhaul arrives, but until that day, it's really not reasonable to ask otherwise.
---
For what you need range script if light fighters is close combat fighters? Range script good for SC fighter-bombers in pvp like shoot to sub caps at 60-70km and keep your fighters at close to you orbit and dock it/launch  when they take dmg. Or also same tactic but blastet cyno inhib at 60-70km an no lost any fighter bomber. So range scripts only when you need use FB on supers like really long range sentry fighters but no need for light fighters
---
Word. Thanks for the tips!
---
You won't get cost effective because of the super/rorq you are supposed to save is going to die because you cannot force Goku fleet of grid. And to do that you need to kill booshers, and they often have enough logi that have them prelocked. Unless you are able to provide enough DPS to kill Stork in one tick, it's not going to work. And you won't be able to get enough people to form in subcaps in less than 5 minutes.
---
Or the destroyed ship having a warp disruptor or scrambler fitted. You are looking for PVP ships after all.
---
&gt;does not actually exist
---
To be fair, none of these ships exist.

---
Agreed 100% - but I think more than anything, if I'd started as a newbro after the wardec changes, I wouldn't have had *nearly* as difficult a time. I spent most of two years playing this game without a corp because I wanted to avoid wardecs.
---
Although I had a pretty good grasp of the mechanics I was dealing with by that point and also had a good idea of how to fit my ship, I was incredibly naive in other ways. Getting into a corp *rapidly* improved my understanding of many game mechanics and got me comfortable with trying things I never would have bothered with otherwise.
---
Arguably I might have wound up with a bad corp to start out with - but even then, I'd argue a *bad* corp is better than none.
---
Use of  a T2 entosis module on a super or titan ejects the pilot in his pod on success with a 30 second delay to boarding any ships, not just the one they pop out of
---
All mining drones including excavs jet can yield instead of deliver it back to the ship that fielded them
---
All items purchased from markets in all systems have a 50% chance to be delivered via jet can 30k from the structure they were bought from.
---
Local Chat replaced by Global Chat allowing all players to talk to everyone else in one convenient place. Attempts to close this channel make it pop under the UI similar to the ship tree.
---
Anything controlled with an ACL autowhitelists anyone with -10 standing
---
All wormholes last 7 days, do not decay, allow supers to pass through them.
---
Structures entering low power eject all items contained within.
---
At least if someone undocks to shoot their alt every day they'll be innsoace with a weapons timer. Still better then shooting an NPC.
---
I'm glad this was the only thing needing balanced this patch! I might not have actually undocked this month if they didn't fix this!
---
I know, that its hard to form that fast, but by that logic the only solution would be to kill the stuka/goku doctrines all together and let everyone crab in peace.
---
Roll your holes...
---
"but i dont WANNA fly subcaps to counter subcaps its so BORING"  
---
FTFY
---
I need this to be in the game.
---
Lots of carriers and webbing/pointing/light figters do the trick and doomsday. But it aint easy. Jackdaws are eeewh.  Possible but not easy due damage applications and range. You need alot of logi in the jackdaws due the incoming dps.
---
https://github.com/MalmarPadecain/EVE_Jukebox/ Here's the Github page (It's in the About panel, too)
---
I can't really justify packaging CCP's music and the videos up, though.
---
Tell me about it :)))). My shield went bananas for few seconds :))))
---
If you ask me mixed it. Boosher+logi and scram jackdaws.
---
Mega Navy. Go to the options panel and you can switch to a video of the same thing, or a Machariel in a Minmatar station. More soon, maybe...
---
This is remarkable.  Thank You!  :)
---
Regular carriers don't have EHP to withstand full fleet. Besides you need rather blingy MR fax to support them, and one often costs as much as whole stuka fleet.
---
That was a Gila's Drones. I was solo roaming near Deklein and I found this guy ratting. I engaged it, he fought back, I had to warp off (bring him in like 1/3 of his shield tank) just to make his drones chill the fuck out :)))).
---
I think he was pretty confident cuz he remained there while I was repairing on the sun. I warped back to him and finish the job.
---
Tanky AF Gila.

---
Finally... I am back home.
---
I'm going to give the opposite advice and throw out a shoutout to nano-kiting. It's a much more active playstyle, because your #1 objective is just to stay alive in a ship that is outgunned, out-tanked, and at times even outnumbered. My last two corps in particular have had a long-standing love for no-anchor nano cruiser packs, where every pilot is in charge of keeping themself alive and chipping the enemies to dead. It's high-speed, high-energy, and really forces you to figure out exactly what you can get away with in a ship.
---
There is a counter. But you haven't found a good one yet.
---
I love evil.
---
Remove cap regen as a ship trait. Remove cap boosters of all sizes. Capacitors now run on plex which must be loaded from the ships hold, and may not be placed there unless docked.
---
Double the strength of all neut and nos modules.
---
I understand what you're saying. The drive to sell injectors might be affecting ship balance. I can definitely see that being possible or perhaps already happening. 
---
Hasn't the case of bigger ship (aka more potential dps) beating the smaller ship always been true to one degree or another? There are niche ships like bombers and some faction ships that take on bigger ships or have a more powerful feature than similar ships. They wouldn't fit that formula as you already stated. However, those would also push injector sales since EVE is all about power creep. Otherwise it just comes down to bringing enough numbers to make up the difference (ie a swarm of frigates killing a battleship). I think that has always been true, but I could be wrong.
---
Goku/stuka fleets aren't exactly new, and yet anything there's no counter doctrine to them. I don't think it's safe to assume it's due to lack of good theorycrafters.
---
It's to make people play the game. Then ccp can prance about how they have big numbers logging in everyday.
---
Implying he bought it for Reddit, not cause he wanted one. 
---
You're an idiot.
---
Do you really think this?
---
Yes it's the one that comes to the ending site
---
The primary incentive not to use them is the horrible fighter interface.  If you think this is some compelling gameplay design on CCP's part, think again.
---
No.  You've lost about 100m in pride.
---
In null it's all "tick" based.  That is to say, with a super for example I'm making 60m-90m per hour, assuming I'm not fit like a retard and/or botting.  For a carrier it's less, against assuming non-retard fit, though that is now not a thing - full-retard is OK for carriers as they're disposable.
---
Anyway it's all about speed, not the site's value, hence a lot of people rat with hyperspatial rigs.
---
We nerfed a 100-ppl-stukafleet yesterday. Turns out that some Subcaps with competent pilots do the job quite well 
---
https://i.imgur.com/zU42FG5.png
---
Well, that's just saying a BS is the wrong tool for that job tbh.
---
Yet here you are, continuing to not make the "point" more clear.
---
Trolling, copy pasta or just plain old unoriginal thought?
---
the real question is though, how exactly does it compare to texas
---
Sir you have worked too hard on this, GIVE THIS GUY A MEDAL!
---
hops not responding has no connection to packet loss or otherwise. One does not induce the other. There might be just a filter that blocks ICMP requests (If trace uses ICMP) and simply does not respond as this looks like extra hops are not masked by VPLS/MPLS.  
---
Also, from my experience the dreaded "Connection to server lost" message can appear anytime. Playing game on the same PC one client went and de-synced became sluggish and disconnected. While other kept the connection and did not show any problems.
---
I heard that the earth is flat too.
---
Yet here you are blaming the fact you can't read on me.
---
Then you got trolled
---
You must have some sort of severe learning disability or something. I'm so sorry.
---
That, or you are actually fucking retarded.
---
Fair, sorry for assuming you didn't
---
Yes, here you are, still unable to clarify your point.
---
The problems with stuka and goku fleets isn't the cloak or covert cyno.
---
atrons. blasters. black rise. fun.
---
If you can't read my post, and the post I replied to, you're just fucking stupid.
---
We already have roaming anti BOT filters in nullsec.  They're called Incursions.
---
And you just showed the elitest attitude that runs off new players.
---
Probably because he got evicted :)
---
Unchained Alliance is the right answer to this thread. We are absolutely pvp focused but we still have fun and try to learn from our mistakes.
---
It's all good. Never stop spreading knowledge :)
---
&gt; that don't create any content
---
No, I don't want to increase your enjoyment of the game by feeding my ships to you.  I don't care what the rewards are in terms of ISK.  There's no reward in terms of self-respect.
---
Same ship, same occupation (PvE) thus compareable. Abstracting is a base of all scientific models.
---
So when a ship is more at risk in an area with lower rewards than the same ship doing the same stuff in areas with higher rewards, something in the (explicitly advertised) risk vs. reward meta is broken. Thats all I said. I gave no statement on what ship is best for the job.
---
just like your leaders?
---
Would take you approximately 71 years of non-stop warp at 10au/s to reach this spot
---
that is  
---
**69253311.254598** ly  LY
---
You mean bash the spammed stations with triglavian dreads..
---
Wait what the fuck am I saying...
---
There were parts in lore stories where they described that Iapetans actually influence planets like moons, causing high tides and stuff.
---
Did you try to warp to it? And if yes, what happened?
---
Dat deep safe mmmm...
---
The idea was good, the implementation was CCP.
---
A Pacifier can get to over 19au/s
---
Damn ........
---
Tbh i would go and hunt those in nullsec for a single reason.       
---
Warp few hours in interceptor to one, just to make a spot.                
---
Then try to go there in a hyper rigged indy just to drop a structure there - and then laugh hard when someone decide to kill one just to notice that he need to spend few days to warp to it :D
---
Pacifier can get to 19au with hyperspatial rigs and lows.
---
probably would be better to do it in a pacifier. less than 5% drop in warp speed, but can fit a much larger capacitor.
---
Nicely done.  Great attitude as well.  In before all the random "you should have..." "Why didn't you..."  "If you weren't trash tier, you would have..." comments.
---
You maked a Falcon in your example! 
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Systems all exist as separate instances. You can't actually move between systems without gates/wormholes/cynos/whatever.
---
Nice safespot!
---
But what about max range and cap recharge?       
---
The whole point of using a frigate with oversized cap battery is to let it do very long warps.
---
An awesome fight, and the biggest one I've been in.

Huh so that's why pyfa prices are fucky wucky

No it isn't, it removes negative energy from the room it's in.

Are fw missions broken? Yeah, that was news a few years ago. Do you need to stop using "factual" and "IMHO" in the same sentence, especially right next to each other? YES! Should we forget the chaos era ever existed? Yes, the game almost died ffs, it's just a meme like Dust 514 and CCP's other projects at this point.

That cut is so deep James Cameron is looking to dive it. Bravo

Reasonable explanation why Stukas are a little op atm. It never were the Bombers. 
---
It is the same point that makes the boosh Ravens a broken concept. The infinite chainability of booshes, up to the point where you have enough Command-Dessis in fleet to perma-boosh.
---
It would be quite easy to fix, by adding the MJD-Cooldown of the CMD that just booshed to all others that received that boosh.
---
Working as intended

Who would have thought

The *abyssal* space is this close yet this far away from us all along?

You sure as hell won't get anywhere with 20 free firing jackdaws... Not if it's a propper stuka comp anyway.
---
It is perfectly possible to permaboosh, if your fleet is big enough. 6-7 Booshers are enough for that
---
I think it has more to do with the state of the economy, you used to be able to T2 fit a bs for 80-160m, and go get a fight. Do a couple weeks of pve have a few bil and not worry about it.

Nowadays things are so expensive it seems like it's half a bil for a T2 cruiser. Ridiculous

I do. I definitely feel like this playstyle isn't doing very well in the "farms and fields" meta, but for what it's worth my friends and I are privateers. We're don't roleplay it out with a bunch of ridiculous "AAARR" and shit but we live the life. 
---
I've always found it really interesting how closely our organization (unintentionally) parallels the way historic privateers/corsairs operated and organized. Guess the model is well suited for the role.
---
I will be. ;)
---
The people who play the game*
---
This is what risk-averse carebears do when given any power.
---
"But sir, I read that EVE is a PvP game! Why don't we fight?"
---
"Who told you that? PvP is an optional playstyle that we abstain from due to our irreproachable morality. Don't question our way of life."
---
One of the prize winners is an eve player.

There was a Nobel a year or so ago that went to someone for work that was done a decade previously. That was seen as being almost unseemly quick. More typical is the case of the guys who got the chemistry prize in 2015 or 2016 for work identifying the mechanisms of DNA repair. They’d started that when they were still PhD candidates and did the key work when they were junior faculty in the late 1970s.
---
I'm often in 0.0
---
Have you tried looking at gpu temps? Ex: windows - your gpu idling at 30-35C, eve on max settings at 50-55C. Linux - 50-55C idle, 65-70C eve on max settings. Haven't tried proton specifically myself but I guess I'm just not comfortable cruising so hot all the time when I absolutely do not have to.
---
Reps are not gonna hold on a freighter. Much better off getting a webbing alt with really long webs like in a hyperspatial rigged hyena or rapier and webbing your freighter into warp.
---
Thats... that wasn’t my point at all.
---
I will have to clear it through him first.
---
Negative Nancy.
---
About?
---
So then Abyssal runners can do that, and unless you can zoom out your solar system map large enough you'd never know the trace was there and there is no way to combat scan them. Seems like an exploit CCP would banhammer for anyway.
---
I got away because caps depleted notification..
---
Yep.  Came here to say this.  I almost quit Eve because of they made the game so boring.  Then I started going on Gareth Correllian fleets and that became my only hook.  Love PvP.
---
&gt; Can someone explain what a theoretical discovery is?
---
Imagining a way to improve the New Player Experience and then not implementing it.
---
I don't know, for Linux I have iGPU which runs EVE quite fine, and for max performance I use GPU Passthrough.
---
New meta:
---
Warp to anomaly with a warp space rigged recon
---
Light cyno
---
Jump in
---
Sick tick
---
Holy shit? We're a business? And we're advertising?
---
You don't say!
---
I wouldn't mind about the whole crying thing if they made at least the same effort to make things better.
---
I don't consider brave, horde, or kar a fleet new player organisation \*anymore\*. They have outgrown that. Imho the biggest problem for new player retention are true new player organisation like brave and horde seem to have been it shortly after they were founded (I wasnt around back than tbh)
---
They seem logical to me. I was explaining why they are.
---
That'll provide all the distance you'd want for a deep safe an hour away from any body.
---
For the record, the ban was specifically related to the random SF Provi 'war' that died moments after it was declared on Reddit.  No issue with normal SF runs.
---
Yup
---
oh no a bunch of f1 monkeys quit
---
Are you sure about this? Because I just tested this out myself and it worked okay? JF/indy cyno btw
---
Wait! There is a purple skin for minmatar ships? Nice!
---
I've always found the pallet for the minmatar only skins to be either too dark or too yellow. 
---
Nice good job art team!
---
This one sided story is very one sided.
---
A quick 5 minute analysis of the one situation you seem to be complaining would make you realize why this isn't done.
---
Generalizations and antisocial evidence are poor for making a point.
---
If you chose to join another large learning corp you'll learn they work just about the same, just the color of space changes. (This isn't meant as a knock on Karmafleet, Brave, or those lovely Beans doing Gobs work)
---
Disagree. I think it's great for people five to six months in but not for complete newbros.  Most if not all of their fleets (even their newbro fleets)behave as if you've already learned the game. 
---
On the other hand, agree with the fact that if you are super self motivated, you'll be able to find people to help you out. But it's just clear it's not geared towards newbros.
---
Is this a stainguy alt account?
---
In some ways aren't we all just a stainguy alt account?
---
There once was a guy that tried to reach love space via an old method with probes. Long story short you will 'appear' on the map in the right location but in game you will still be in the original system
---
Well, you're not wrong
---
Maybe because I live in JSpace and the only EUNI group I ever see is the wormhole campus, I got the impression that they were much more alive and well than they were (because, as was mentioned, those guys actually fly around in ships and try to start things).
---
... As far as the wiki goes... I mean yeah it's definitely dated by now but the wiki is still one of the best things that exists in all of EVE. Even after I started with the game years ago, stopped, and then didn't officially join full-time until a year ago, the things I read on the wiki in 2012 and 2014 (in particular, all of the weapon and missile damage mechanics) never really got out of my mind.
---
Is that how it works? If you log out and log in it picks back up from however much time has passed? I was under the impression that as soon as it logged you out that's the spot it figured you should be (or whenever it pings, at least).
---
That is 11 billion, 714 million my friend.
---
yes but thats 38421 days..real life time days
---
but still how many victims place citadels in these deep safes
---
[You have to do it manually](https://i.imgur.com/Wro9KMQ.mp4)
---
The Uni is geared to offer something to as many playstyles  as possible. Unfortunately it cannot be tailored to suit the needs of one person. When you get to the point of frustration op has then you've got all you can from the Uni and it's time to move on. The Uni  has been home to a big chunk of the playerbase at some point in their eve career, so drastically changing it for one person's ideas doesn't seem sensible, more listen to all management/membership and work to keep the corp relevant , which it still is despite the handful of complaints in this thread.
---
He is offering an invaluable service to the eve community with mostly his own money (I think) as most people have adblock. Actually paying him a (for me) low amount of isk is something that I don't feel bad about.
---
Upvote for using parsec instead of lightyear.
---
I assume you'd need to have it open for as long as you want to warp through DT, then DT will kick you out of warp and into the safety warp so that you can land right where DT stopped you once you log back in.
---
They're the new ones. Snowline Bladeracer.
---
Looks like they're available for pretty much every Minmatar ship.
---
55 each for Frig to BC, 110 for BS, 250 for Capitals.
---
So not great, but not terrible.
---
yeah,only thing i can think of is the extra scan res on the claw insted of the stiletto, so gatecampers maybe
---
Snowline Bladeracer skin :)
---
Don't you also need to bring a lot of bombers to threaten supers?
---
If they are smart, they won't kick you out so long as you bring some fights.
---
I had to start somewhere, and I'm not a crazy fitting expert so I start with something I know well. This fit is probably pretty common in nullsec for the exact reasons we use it. I just can't speak to that directly because, as I noted, we have no idea how people in different parts of space play the game. I've also seen a lot of nullsec Sabres with a single shield extender and a web, something that I see very rarely in w-space.
---
This is the first Stainguy post I haven’t downvoted in about 6 months.
---
Ya know, I could give you a bunch of suggestions and I'm sure people are about to, but seriously some of the best times that can be had in the game are when you and the people you're with are in way over your heads just trying to figure it out. The kitchen sink nonsense fleets used to be more common than they are now, and they arent good or effective but they are fun.
---
Docking up for war targets hasn't been a rule for at least 7 years. 
---
That, combined with a criticism about not attacking war hqs makes me think you are poorly informed and highly opinionated. That's a great combo for Reddit, but perhaps not great for trying to function in groups.
---
FYI: there is absolutely no point attacking the war hq of any opponent with rudimentary Google skills on how to run a war.
---
Civilian mining lasers maybe... they just removed them from new corvettes.
---
i dont have ads anywhere and ive never ever blocked them manually...
---
maybe check your adblock if everything is up to date?
---
That amount of ISK is low for anyone who has been playing for more than a month or two, tbh. Squizz is good people, I totally support paying for removing ads.
---
I would imagine EUni is like most groups and always has a shortage of people willing to do the selfless work to help others.  Also like other groups, they probably have a surplus of people willing to point out everything wrong and talk about how someone else should fix it.
---
In practicality, yes, you're right. Stukas is just a hell of a comp. Countering it requires superior numbers or a balance pass by CCP. 
---
I would like to see some variety in comps, but again, a balance pass is needed
---
Reminds me of the Hell Kitty Apocalypse.
---
You realize that director and CEO are hardcoded roles in the actual game, right? They come with specific in-game powers.
---
I'm not sure why you're getting downloaded for asking a question, but Jub Jub provided the correct explanation below.
---
Still an okay deepsafe.
---
Yep. It'll take years to get there but you can.
---
Just pay + adblock
---
Definitely one for the resume.
---
I'm at work so I hope this is not a picture of your balls
---
oh another pax sex video. feed more hurricanes in delve pls.
---
Eve is a great game, it's very complicated so dont get overwhelmed if you dont understand something the first or fifth time you try it. Glad you asked because the skill points are very helpful to getting started, just dont used them until you know what ish you want to do in the game.
---
holy fuck, no one cares
---
I believe this is the Star Citizen HUD when you're piloting a ship

Glitter*
---
At this point, that was a completely different game, with a completely different playerbase. 
---
And for the record it was still a pain in the ass, there just wasn't any other option
---
Yup, or just Zero Punctuation on Youtube. (I might have to spend way too much time to catch up now, but I regret nothing)
---
Maybe it’s all part of the plan. Realizing leadership is toxic and you need to move on is the last lesson they wanted to teach you. You are ready to move on.
---
Newbro here - why would you need a safe when running abyssals in highsec? Avoid getting suicide ganked?
---
You see the emerging conduit that was 23years+ of warping from system?
---
yeah but why? why is a goru shuttle 2mil? who buys this shit? why buy this shit?
---
... yeeees and ?
---
It is if you use firefox mobile. I switched from chrome just so I could have extensions on mobile, 100% worth it.
---
Yay more annoying nano cancer that you can't insta Gib in your battleship after waiting 20 seconds to lock and investing 10x the amount cause reasons
---
or rather hello actual use for spread formation.
---
im sad that i dont have minmatar ships and missilies/rockets for fw
---
Nice good call on the idea
---
Worm, Gila and Rattlesnake drones are the worst culprits of random wrecking shots. It’s basically tied to how wrecking shots work and it makes them even more retardedly powerful than they already are.
---
That's par for the course for xzest voyage. They front decent numbers (in their timezone) but generally aren't great pilots so they upship as much as they can. If you have the logistics and pilots to counter that it can make for a fantastic time though. They also haven't seemed to be big shit-talkers but maybe that's just the language barrier. Dropping caps if you don't have a \*reason\* to drop caps is typically a no-no in wormhole bushido, which can sometimes be a circle jerk but I personally like the sentiment.
---
Wait, people still play this game?
---
Shocker.
---
I am stress testing a ship atm increasing my site tiers, and I found a trig frig book in a t1 or t2 site.
---
I used to get so many solo pvp fights in a crusader it was awesome, then they killed it :(
---
iirc, I'm fairly sure there is a limit to how deep a safe can be.  Anything further just gets moved in to that point.  
---
People use to use to kill their in cyno's mid jump.  This would dump you really far out sometimes and people had ultra deep safes with supers hidden in them.  It was considered an exploit and ccp killed it by creating a maximum bookmark range.
