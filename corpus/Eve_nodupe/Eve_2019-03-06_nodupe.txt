&gt; Carriers/Supers are easily countered with ECM drones
---

---
lol?
---
&gt; I think the real issue is 'small gang' PVPers not realizing that Null Sec isn't their personal playground
---
It shouldn't be a personal playground but it shouldn't be a complete no go zone either.
---
---
---
&gt;Olmeca joins mar5hy in the ban wagon for continued vote brigading / mod harassment expect more to come. 
---
Didn't that already happen and he got told to stop shitting up the mod mail inbox as a result?
---
I think the CSM has some redeeming qualities, and that not everyone who is sent to it tries to destroy the game to favor their pet faction. It has it's problems but I think it's better than what CCP will likely do instead.
---
I still remember very clearly the CCP that gave us monaclegate, and the t2 bpo scandal, and that decided the players didn't want a polished game.  That CCP desperately needs contact with its players, and I don't trust them to replace the CSM with...anything at all. 
---
I think if you abolish the CSM the company will do what it has done before...make up shit in a vacuum.
---
Bottom line, I think what we disagree on is this: I think the CSM is better than nothing, and from the sound of it you don't think so.
---
"They"?
---
Whip them harder.
---
lol no its not, what the hell is ur definition of winning?????
---
He lost it, twice even and killed little to nothing. Its like buying the fastest car, joining a race and driving into a wall. He payed and lost
---
&gt; If you can't find a solution, go somewhere else?
---
Like another game I guess. If Eve becomes risk free farmville for nullsec line members, it loses a lot of what makes it unique and attractive.
---
ITT: Goons claim a couple of bombers in different systems dying in separate systems is because Mar5shy didn’t input broadcast them all to cloak and therefore must be input broadcasting.
---
They were rebalanced.
---
Doesn't mean they're balanced. They need another rebalance, because gee nothing changed. 
---
The pre-Injector meta never categorically prevented people from doing things. The barrier for entry (measured in terms of patience and dedication required) made the majority of people say *'Fuck it. Not worth the effort.'*
---
The players excluded themselves. The cost-benefit analysis wasn't favourable for most individuals, so they didn't partake in it. A few individuals \_did\_ accept that effort, and those individuals benefited from it. 
---
Now the barrier is so low that lots of people do it. Now enough people have a competitive advantage over others to force the remainder to partake \_just to remain relevant\_.
---
It's a Lewis Carroll scenario: 
---
&gt;*"My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that."*
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; Basically, I want to see a return to small fleet roams,
---
It's because CCP listen retard people like you we have today structure damage cap, fozziesov and all that kind of bullshit everyone hate, just shut the fuck up please
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75006536/
---
LoL. Yeah. You will only get your 20 man Talwar fleet bosoned. LoL. 
---
TBH though. That was hilarious. 
---
yeH, I;m sure you're definition of a 'fleet' is 20 and small gang 3. Get fucked. 
---
Not for goons.
---
Tu peux regarder sur le chan z-s overview
---
learn a real language. i suggest English for starters.
---
&gt;Increase the hull cost and nuke capital insurance.
---
The former didnt work for Titans, so that wont be enough.

If your enjoyment of the game is that narrowly defined, your imagination and grit are insufficient, and you're kind of a pansy, then sure, don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya.

"  just because we happen to kill stuff in Delve "

And no its because you're shitlers  
---
Could someone ELI5 the situation between LSH and NSH?
---
Not good enough. The problem is known and needs to be fixed.
---
lmfao jesus christ you're really reaching
---
you sure got me querns
---
the real issue here is that I thought "querns is so fucking dumb he will need me to explicitly spell out what I mean because he's incapable of making even the most basic inference"
---
not that you thought a cloaky camper known for dropping cloaky ships might use a bomber for, I dunno, the covert cyno
---
you cracked the case sherlock. turns out you're not retarded, you're just a very convincing actor
---
You'd think no one would care, but they do.
---
TBH I'm not entirely sure what you mean.
---
In the current system if you extract SP while at Industry lvl-5 (or enough SP to put you below lvl-5), you are then lvl-4, and those SP can be used in any skill you want.
---
Personally I would prefer a system where SP was sold that could only be applied to specific skills/category of skills. e.g. Extract SP from the Amarr Frigates skill and sell SP that can only be used in that skill or skill category (spaceship command).
---
It was long enough between that we killed 2-3 dreads and I think a fax, which, in a fight that size, makes the difference between being nearly even and getting stomped. Regardless, you're right - it wasn't like 5 minutes between drops.
---
Lol. So triggered.
---
someone else was reporting 9 gigs during the test so given CCP's FANTASTIC reputation for high quality coding, the good bet is on a memory leak being the reason its using that much RAM and one can only hope they will unfuck that before pushing it to tranquility.
---
&gt; fail. Pan Family have more supers and titan against INITIATIVE
---
like honestly if this is true it's pretty fucking sad
---
"don't even bother trying to create content unless you're willing to deploy max titans"
---
Titans Online, reproc everything else you own?
---
This is your brain on goonswarm, kids. 
---
Everyone really knew goons had the stronger super fleet for years.
---
The shuffle of corps within panfam was mostly groups moving to over panfam alliances, and the few that left for snuff/BL moved not because of the war, but because of how inactive PL had become.
---
Bait people onto a raitaru. Get in a ship and engage people, warp/mjd away when they get close. A lot of times people will follow you thinking that you're an easy kill. Give em a nasty surprise
---
" and all those other bot infested regions " So like everywhere then.
---
&gt; When travelling en-masse, fortizars are often used as mid-points when keepstars are not available. 
---
When travelling en-masse, they're also a bit harder to drop on.  Since they're en-masse.
---
Dropping on a massed titan/super/fax fleet at 0 on a (presumably anti-cap-fit) citadel is not going to go all that well.  Unless your definition of "masse" is rather unusual.
---
I don’t care what the response is. Drop 1000 soups and titans on my 5 man gang for all I care. But they shouldn’t be able to apply to subcaps without subcap support. 
---
Yeah, you were in muninns and scimis. The direct counter to caps as they are now. Caps shouldn’t shape subcap metas. 
---
That’s why I left the game. You know, what this entire thread is about? 
---
all them salty downvotes
---
Yup it was potentially a catastrophic delay. But it worked out in the end.
---
shooting as many MTU's as I can find.
---
I wouldn't.
---
Lol, 64-bit eve isn’t gonna magically take up more ram on everyday use. That’s not how it works. Regardless, you can cap usage per client.
---
How about those times he pulled off multi-man bombing runs with characters all named Don on mining barges?  Funny how that hasn't happened again since the local incident...
---
So, you think that the only thing preventing lots of short-range dreadbombs on titan/super move fleets would be cyno inhibs on the citadel?
---
Well then, let's see the huge number of killmails from wiping out all those fleets since inhibs can't currently do that.
---
I eagerly await your links of small numbers of unsupported supers &amp; titans.
---
Rollback a lot of the changes made after 2012. So many things were changed that didn't need to be changed. Bring back the old UI, the square targeting window (they fucked up Chribba's tattoo!), no drop down menus, can flipping, rework the bounty system and wardens, buff the ships that needed it instead of needing a lot more ships to bring them in line with underpowered ships.
---
You can go, people solo roam all the time.  Go in cloaky/nullified T3s, and play smart. Then you're free to play VNI hunters online.
---
waht ever i want. that includes : mining/tradeing/combat/exploreing. never do just one thing you will burn out fast.
---
After World War Bee it was much more up for debate if Goons could realistically field the stronger fleet, especially against GOTG/Panfam combined.
---
Ok, maybe not exactly Time != Money, but once you trained a skill, you trained it. You couldn't do shit like extract a skill, and then train something else on demand. 
---
Also, you had to find characters that suited your need. 
---
A character that met your needs might have had a ton of other things you weren't interested but was valuable, making it much more expensive/out of budget. You couldn't shape it the way you wanted to. 
---
If you settled for a character that didn't have everything that you wanted, you'd have to spend days, weeks or even months to get what you wanted, and that would have been the best thing that was available.
---
Now? Meh, just buy skill injectors.
---
Tried mining, didn't like it? Want to go into something else? Wow! Instead of training the new thing for months, AND retaining these skills I never will ever use again, I can just get rid of the useless skills and instantly train into the new things.
---
Additionally, the character bazaar required PLEX to transfer characters (and still does). History would still remain, too. That 100% prevented shit like a mass creation of VNI ratters, mining alts (to some extent), etc.
---
Now? Why buy a character that will cost at minimum 1000 PLEX worth (I think?) of isk for the transfer fees + duration of sub cost and extra for a VNI account? I can just buy one or two skill injectors on a fresh account with no history whatever.
---
**Time was not money in the sense that it is now.**
---
Looks like you hate answers. 
---
OP is clearly an idiot. 
---
I am a shit poster. Shit posting is what I do. When I see something that deserves a shit post then I build my momentum and release the aligned energies of my shitposting chi upon the. Being bad at pvp is what you do. I don’t ask you to stop being bad at pvp do I?
---
Questions are fine. Dumb questions/statements will receive a little hate.
---
Why the fuck are you moving out loot more than once a week?
---
Wasn't that a mass test with a shitload of things on grid?
---
Pstt. No one cares.
---
See - re wording this in a much less-aggressive way makes much more sense
---
&gt; Before injectors if I wanted a Rorq alt I bought it on the Character Bazaar
---
But there were only so many rorq characters available. If people wanted 40 multiboxing alts, they wouldn't be able to get that from the bazaar. With injectors, people can create new ones and so balance problems proliferate much faster.
---
U R SO TRIGGURED L M A O
---
Shit, if I had known that abject learned helplessness made you smarter, I would have begun victimizing myself ages ago!
---
This reminds me of the fan fiction of Elise, mittani, and someone else getting their gay on from back in like 2013. Good memories.
---
Mad triggered
---
Make sure shit runs out if it is overfarmed. Then people will quit or fight.
---
Well, my RL job allows me to spend pretty much whatever amount of money I want on plex for ISK. This is obviously a shitty answer to ur question, so before I did that.
---
I had 3 accounts in naglfars and loved a nomadic life in C5/C6 space. You can easily make up to 2-3B an hour doing so. Ofcourse you’ll have to find a good hold. Scan it down and roll the other wormholes.. 
---
Who has time for roams anymore?  Maybe 10 years ago when I was in college lol.  Now it’s drop or die baby!
---
Create content unlike these other lazy fucks.
---
In all seriousness OP’s ideas are trash.
---
You mean, like replying to a post to be counted as one of those people not caring?
---
Loving living in whs, doing blops
---
He gave you a sound a well justified answer.. 
---
Ping-warrioring.
---
That may be true, but living in high class holes makes you a target, and being a small group in a high class hole is either impossible or incredibly difficult, especially for people looking to get a start in J space. It's just not realistic.
---
I doubt we'll be using wormholes for anything other than chaining easier access to low/hisec or for random excursions to other null regions.
---
Yeah, a marauder is probably the closest to filling that gap, but then you get the *other* issues that class has (like, oh, the whole 'more expensive than the dread' thing \&gt;.\&gt;).
---
Just come live in whs like Kings
---
They need to fix the balance of what to bring as a defensive fleet, and being able to print isk while aligned out in perfect safety, so you can get fun content hunting and countering hunters. At the moment a roam will see a few ships on dscan, already warping out to their pos, and then end with a cyno drop that you can't counter. Neither of those things is fun.
---
And fix FW. Don't let people anchor structures in FW space, remove the farmable missions, and remove the tier effect on LP to stop people playing the farming pendulum.
---
Word!
---
Drop one timer.
---
Start small. Frigate/Dessie gangs. 
---
I wait for pings and then press F1 until stuff explodes. Also occasionally solo pvp but I feel like it's getting harder to solo every day.
---
This is quite the look you're trying out. I'm impressed at your own capacity for self-loathing.
---
Wormholes and now blops is pretty fun
---
Logging in and hoping I'd finally die so I can quit
---
Why do people keep repeating this bullshit? CCP can make caps pretty much useless yesterday if they wanted. The game is shit because CCP likes it that way.
---
it's pretty easy to multibox bombers, since you always fleet warp them. you only ever need to press literally a single button. It seems more than a little disingenuous that goons are out here arguing that multiboxing a half dozen bombers is impossible without input broadcasting, but every goon rorq pilot pulling excavs on the same server tic is just a high ADM pro.
---
Are you ok? I think you might be losing it querns. You're making less sense than usual.
---
&gt;you have to be willing to step out from under the established power blocs and their private agendas and make YOUR OWN terms
---
&gt;It ISN'T Eve that is dying, it's the imagination of the leaders who have consolidated power to the point that it's a 6 month or year-long GRIND to win.
---
I agree with your sentiment here, but you need not look further than the [straw men](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/axoff4/change_your_gameplaychange_eve_onlinemega_make/ehuytqo/) being set up in the responses of this post to understand why this plea will fall on deaf ears.  There are few that want to relinquish the effortless dunks and casual gameplay that comes with membership in the huge null blocs.  Even if you manage to get a small portion of the community to _actually understand_ that this endless [consolidation of blobs into superpowers cannot sustain pvp content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa31nDBsUJI), no one wants to be the first to leap out of their powerbloc due to the aversion to be the first to take the risk. Everyone just points to the shit-show that is the chinese server's stagnation and laughs, even as tranquility lumbers inexorably towards the same fate. 
---
The biggest problem with Eve online isn't the developer, it's the community.  CCP gave the community unprecedented freedom to build what it wanted - and the community took all these intricate systems and cool mechanics and built the most boring landscape imaginable - huge tidi inducing blue donuts as far as the eye can see. But hey, who are you to tell them how to play their game?
---
Many of the smaller groups have been hoping for the last few years that it would change, but I more or less threw in the towel a few weeks ago. From what I've heard from players in some of the smaller independent groups, I'm not the only one. 
---
&gt;but every goon rorq pilot pulling excavs on the same server tic is just a high ADM pro.
---
I find it funny people keep saying that when the videos they post don't show that. I also find it funny you mention how easy one button in to press when its bombers and everyone seems to forget that's exactly what rorq pilots are doing as well...
---
/Thread
---
A lot of the same stuff here at least :)
---
Yep 
---
No, by all means, continue.
---
Nah, miss me with that shit. I brought a 6 man gang to ge-, you guys docked up, @channeled and formed like 40 dudes.
---
Yeah cool, gonna just nano 5x our numbers.. oh you brought talwars, lemme just shoot outside my lock range of my nano cruiser, epic, thanks for the pvp gonna just leave and frag retard tackle. 
---
As this happened in 2017, what changes from CCP would have affected the possible outcomes here? 
---
Winning. And by that, I don't mean "quit."
---
a total overhaul of mining ships and mining in general.
---
You’re the worst thing ever 
---
Time, money, and someone to play with
---
Flying with the bois and killing shit without max dude ctas und stratops. 
---
1000 active members and you see 15-20 on strat ops? Lol for real??
---
Don’t do it. 
---
Adapt to these ~~nuts~~ torps 
---
Ya ofcourse they're afk. why else would they be called afk? geesh. are you not smart or something?
---
&gt; Prior to skill injectors if I wanted a Rorq alt (or any other kind of character), even if I was a one day old account, I could easily go to the character bazaar, swipe mommy's credit card and obtain said alt.
---
Maybe for one character. Not for 40.
---
He didn't say most value, just largest.... cap booster 3200s for everyone!
---
EVE 2019.
---
And CCP actually made this a reality.
---
Next time feel free to leave your question up as others may find it useful.
---
I'm very much enjoying living in NPC Geminate as a goon. Plenty of things to do to my space-enemies.
---
I enjoy Eve by not playing it anymore and just reading about all the player's crying over whatever issue they think is important.
---
I fail to see how linking a kb with recent and regular activity on it has anything to do with wormholes being crap?
---
I am not going to outright say no because frankly there are really smart people out there and I am consistently amazed by what they come up with.
---
That said, the problem really comes down to dependent processing streams.
---
The reason parallel P2P processing works for crytpo is because majority of the transactions are independent. What I mean by that is, when they occurred relative to each other is not important.
---
Task 1: Person A buys a thing from person B.
---
Task 2: Person C sells a thing to Person D.
---
Those two tasks can be processed in parallel because neither task requires the outcome of the other for itself.
---
Now if person C tries to sell something to Person A, he has to wait for Task 1 to complete otherwise person A might not even have any money. This is a race condition or deadlock. Task 3 is effectively hung until Task 1 completes.
---
Because of that waiting period, extra logic to decide who came first and handle it, etc. It's arguable whether executing those tasks in parallel was faster or not. In the few cases I've looked at in real life, parallel processing actually can slow things down due to this extra overhead.
---
In game servers almost every task is dependent on a previous task.
---
Person A shoots Person B
---
Person C shoots Person B
---
Which one happened first is critical. In order for task 2 to accurately calculate damage on Person B, it needs to wait for Task 1 to complete. Now imagine you have hundreds of people all shooting Person B. Hundreds of parallel threads that are spawned and interdependent. In this case probably nbd, it's only one dude. But with thousands of people all doing different and random things it becomes a very difficult problem very quickly.
---
The complexity becomes almost unmanageable, and the possibility for unexplainable bugs/desync to occur becomes high. You think eve is buggy now? Just wait...
---
Yeah, I could have been more clear, sorry. I meant you actually extract just "Industry V", meaning, it can only be applied for that specific skill, and only that. Basically, the same as skill books, but it completes the research (you still have to buy the skill book).
---
Basically, my idea was for a few reasons.
---
1. It would mean that you'd actually have to sell actual skills, so you couldn't just create 20x alts, train them for 4 months, and sell the skill points en-mass whenever you needed money. I'm not sure how exactly the current system works, but provided money is not an issue, technically you could almost grind 2x,3x,4x depending on how many alts you have. Just create 2x alts, and provided you have the money, you're effectively 
---
2. You would have to analyze the market, and plan out what you want to sell. Obviously, lower level skills would be at a smaller demand. If no one is investing time learning scanning, then you wouldn't be able to move product. This would make the entire Injection system a lot more.. skill oriented? You would have to know the market, would be able to take advantage of possible changes in patches/updates, etc, just like skill books.
---
3. Would make it slightly more difficult for people to abuse it, as it definitely makes a greater divide between true-new players and returning/invited players in a clan, or already have an alt with shekels.
---
I could be wrong on some of this stuff (how it would play out), but basically what i meant is what you prefer.
---
Disagree, fairly standard shitpost quality.
---
Out of curiosity, what drew you to a violent PvP game if you're into pacifist stuff?
---
Absolute legend
---
You're giving CCP way too much credit. And us not enough -- we've wanted this for more than a decade.
---
[removed]
---
Why do you hate structure damage caps?
---
We don't hate him, we just enjoy his salt best. 
---
Maybe not, I just know the problem is not as simple as a lot of people seem to assume. 
---
EVE 2019 so boring a 40k coalition is dedicating their lives to "irrelevant" pvpers
---
Purpose is the number 1 thing when it comes to keeping a corp going. Set goals, develop a culture around those goals and beliefs, and execute. But purpose is key. Never be satisfied. 
---
But the bombs aren't all coming out at the same time, which I think you're overlooking. I've been on grid with rorqs when they pull. All the excavs start heading back towards their rorq on the same tick. You can't explain 40 excavs turning around and beelining home on the same tick by anything but input broadcasting.
---
The auto missiles were originally intended as a counter to EWAR, specifically ECM / Damps, which on rare occasions I still use as such, less so in light of recent ECM changes but still against damps.
---
Though of course there is potential for abuse here. The auto missiles right now are not being abused due to a few things. Low DPS, need really high skills to be effective (full missile support skills etc.).
---
Ultimately it will take a combination of all things, just seems to me that removing agro from drones is a very logical and low effort step. A single change with relatively deep impact. And very low requirements to make it happen. Simply disable the graphical UI elements for it as well as any line command (if there are any), all client side, don't need to touch server, and that will be that. Once the UI for it is disabled CCP can later deal with any leftover code underneath and server side of things at their leisure.
---
Gottem
---
actually it literally works that way.
---
Literally the people.
---
Nothing else.
---
OK but CCP determines the ship and economic meta. Fundamentally, we are operating under a set of conditions, stats, and mechanics provided by CCP and we will find the meta based on the limitations and options set by CCP.
---
Remember the day we killed things and didn't have to post on reddit to feel important?

It is, but this little chat here explains so much about why olmeca is so completely and totally obsessed with sticking it to the goons anyway he can. He can't stick it to "the man" in real life so he's imitating as best he can in Eve with the target he views as "the man" holding everyone down. Talk about taking a game to far.
---
&gt;that the game is too casualized and short term monetized for its own good,
---
Get used to that, CCP is following the general direction of the gaming industry because that style of play has much higher revenue and profit possibilities, a view also held by their new owners.
---
Can I have ur stuff?
---
How much do the bpc's go for? I was under the impression that most of the build cost was in the mineral cost not the bpc
---
mar5hy is actually an Android app
---
People generally consider their own situation/position before they mock. Yes you can do it irrespective of that, it only makes you seem moronic though.
---
Goons style of play is great for goons but not for the longevity of Eve if it wants to continue another 2+ years.
---
Yes the Uni is alive and well, the Solitude Campus is pretty active.

I’m  a member of the Worm Hole Campus and love it.

Any higher rank goons here ? Who makes more obedient pets ? Init or TAPI ?
---
JUST'ed
---
lol they already ignore the larger playerbase, they do however, occasionally seem to pay attention to what the CSM has to say, why get rid of something that has at least some effect in exchange for something we no has zero effect?
---
You think very highly of yourself on this irrelevant spaceship video game message board.
---
NO U
---
Best job i ever had ))
---
So....let's say you get your way, sub application goes to shit. So now caps can't hurt subs, and they can't hurt structures due to damage cap. So...what would they be good for at that point?
---
Yip I understand that. It’s just the method didn’t mention that scenario so it seemed like extra effort for no reason. 
---
&gt;No Alliance moved to Fountain and lived

^ those are gonna be at least 20b jfs every time 
---
I mean you're the one who implicitly brought up the eviction my dude.
---
Considering there is no win objective in eve is is perspective. If this person's only goal... they effectively win. Its death is a whole other part that's unrelated. That is related to the lack of piloting skill or learned knowledge etc. Also anyone can get ganked but his killboard is just horrid. 
---
Ultimatley you can p2w. You pay rl you get ingame perks of isk. And you can now spend that isk on anything but most particularly skill injectors to max a toons sp or greatly raise is. Ones goal might be max sp... this bam. P2w. 
---
At which point you should drop a couple HICs to truly hard tackle it and get as many people to whore on the kill as possible. Dropping carriers is literally the same story for nearly every expensive loss these days.
---
It's boring.
---
Yeah they really need to buff the c1-3 to be able to support a 10-20 man Corp pve wise. 
---
Shit, I didn't know that shooting krabs in Delve was the entire game. How embarrassing for us to have so severely mishandled the game!
---
Guess again.
---
https://imgur.com/upFoeOf
---
Blops/covops. God I love assassinating krabs, it's so much fun being the bad guy.
---
I was also training for AT and skilling up but, sadly, no more :-(
---
Yeah lower sec is better, more belts is preferable so you don't have to wait for the respawns, officers only spawn in certain "Home" regions iirc.
---
and they could even spawn in a nextdoor system while your ratting so always do a sweep of neighboring systems before and after you rat.
---
Well, time was money even back then, the big difference is that you had to commit for a lot longer until you get your profit. If you wanted to sell a rorqual alt you had to invest the time to skill up the character 
---
The big difference is that today you can make profits way faster with skillfarms as you can extract sp once you hit 5.5mil and also you can "pull out" or pause the skillfarm at any time without loosing much where you would habe lost a lot of time before if you stopped skilling the rorquam halfway.
---
Nope ready my next post. Winning in eve is typically objectively based from an individual perspective.  Thus winning can be an array of things. Such as owning a carrier. Or shit even losing a carrier on a great battle... or on his case not so great.
---
Except it doesn't apply, because we have tens of trillions of ISK in infrastructure and ships out, waiting to be shot at any moment. That we're able to effectively defend it against risk-averse pansies has no bearing on my ability to mock said pansies.
---
Also, I guess I have to apologize -- when I made that post, I wasn't aware that the entirety of Eve Online: Noted Space-themed Spreadsheet involved shooting krabs in Delve. 
---
You do realize that rocks don't hang around forever, right?  Literally I move my Rorq after every siege cycle.  While not super intensive, it is most definitely not something that you would AFK.  Especially when managing fleets of Rorquals that some do.  To suggest that this is all being done AFK is hilarious.
---
I mean if that's REALLY what people want (it's not) they could do instanced 10v10 abyssal rooms with a big loot pile for the winning team. That sounds fun as hell.
---
It's days and threads like this that make me happy CCP ignores 99% of what is posted here.
---
They tried that, its how we got here and they wound up without a rep from their part of the game.
---
A suggestion from me on how to solve this all around? Get rid of bullshit damage caps but allow players to rep structures.  
---
But in my ideal world? Caps wouldn't even exist. We'd have large balance updates every 6 months to upset the meta, minor tweaks every 3 months to iron changes out. 
---
Solo/Small gang
---
Thex changed HICs a while ago so the hic point does not affect you mass anymore. There is now a special rig that does that job
---
Plugging the fit into Pyfa gets it to [370 DPS](https://i.imgur.com/avkXFd4.png) before heat / implants / boosts / drugs. It's basically a pirate cruiser in a frigate's body.
---
It's a high slot module
---
The damage is done. Injectors have no correctors.
---
The best way to experience Eve is through an uninstall.
---
What are the base requirements for those corps?
---
Wormhole has always been good for small gang pvp. Anything in K space just escalates to how many friends you can bring. 
---
THIS IS THE PROBLEM, THIS APPROACH DOESN'T WORK
---
at the end of the day if you try to be the change you want to see in the game, you end up getting dicked by the other guys executing the 'optimal' way to play, and then you get burnt out.
---
it's up to the game designers to change the fundamental systems, trying to encourage players to form 'pacts' of sorts to try and improve the health of the game will NEVER work when anyone who doesn't conform benefits, ESPECIALLY for a game like eve.
---
I'm assuming that OP has some experience in the matter
---
They are definitely bots. They are farming cosmos missions. Never leave the system (it's a hisec pocket)
---
One issue is how many people a small amount of space can support.
---
If anom spawn rates were nerfed, for instance, then there would be tension in/between corps for the best ones.
---
the proof is in the post so far the only videos posted show none of what has been claimed. In fact every video posted so far as "proof" of botting rorqs has in fact shown normal actions for rorq pilots using hotkeys and fleet warp mechanics.
---
AT reinstated and development focused on making proper tournament tools/support for tournament organisers.
---
Re-introduction of scarcity and danger in the game. Fuck off PANIC module, fuck off citadels in every system, fuck off ratting indexes increasing by having 200 people in the same single system to watch each other. 
---
Ahhhhh yes, the guy that also manages to log dozens of alts all on the same server tick.  Odd when he was in other parts of the galaxy goons defended him.
---
Thats the issue.
---
Nerf resource gain and there will tension again.
---
That too, I guess I didn't add that in also. 
---
I think he was talking about how time was money in that regard, the fact that you could still profit through skill training.
---
I probably should've added the time before returns in my argument, too.
---
&gt; There's so much ore out there now that it could take years to bring the mineral values back to pre-rorq days
---
Source?
---
Get out. You let goons harass the guy.
---
1. They dont like loosing shit. 
---
2. They dont like being camped
---
3. They cannot do anything to stop him unless it involves a capital drop
---
So what do they do. Harass and bully the guy out of the game. Pathetic. Weak. Spineless people. 
---
Its disgusting that this Reddit community allows a group to harass a single person. Calling him a cheater when there is no proof / no justification. 
---
Its absolutely appalling and you are a terrible mod for supporting this hate / harassment. 
---
that would be very interesting rng features for sure!
---
56 kills last 7 days...... so much content
---
What should CCP do?
---
I love hearing stories of old EVE when there wasn't shit loads of Titans getting dropped on every single fight in Null.
---
The idea that a month from now a corp that has been preparing for war could show up and totally dominate a region.. that's really cool.
---
It seems like at this point there is a few giants, and they just do stuff for content, rather than for necessity.  IE, they start wars to have fun, rather than to take space, because they know they can't.
---
It will never happen, and could never happen, but this is the sort of 'freeze' that wipes fix.  Again, a wipe CANNOT happen in EVE, due to the nature of how EVE is.  But if there was a 'big event' that caused a massive shake up, that would be really cool.
---
I guess new space being possible to go to would act like this in a way, but the big corps would probably just roll over into that new space and the entire thing goes back to square 1.
---
&gt;had to commit for a lot longer  
---
Yes, thus delaying the downfall of the game, all other factors being equal (which they aren't).
---
He's head poster in charge. Who the fuck are you?
---
LP from plex is abysmal if you're having to do any PvP because of stopping the timers etc and having to choose your engagements.   Plexing uncontested is boring AF. 
---
Not sure what the solution is but nerfing the payout isn't a great solution.   Blitzing FW missions can make great isk but can also be annoying to fly around pulling missions then flying the larger number of jumps to the mission target systems.   This can be optimized with developing your own "system" to make it quicker but still isn't great.  
---
Lmao 
---
no...
---
I keep it all in the hopes that the game goes back to a golden age... someday
---
I mean would you prefer 100 jackdaws? When you are going to ppaces that people have to use multiple standing fleets cause not everyone can fit in one what do you expect
---
i was expecting a montage of hy wanto singing linkin park. i'm very dissapointed
---
holy cringe batman
---
High Sec Incursions.
---
Nullsec fleets
---
trying new ships
---
WHY ARE YOU NOT DIEING TO MY OVERPOWERED KITING COMP&lt; SCRUBS FEEEEEEEEEDDDD MEEEEEE
---
I'm imagining Goons doing what BoB failed to do: Going around the clock on the map and burning everything down (or just mining everything), it'd be more interesting than large alliances sitting in their regions mining though.
---
&gt;Tiny left 
---
He's been back for months tho 
---
Thanks for the answer.  
---
A lot of new players express an interest in hauling but the market for profitable hauling is dominated by Omegas with T2 industrial ships and freighters. None of the ships you can fly will hold a candle to them and you'll be left with the most meager of contracts. It's kind of like how thousands of young, impressionable women flock to Hollywood to become models and actresses but most end up being exploited because there aren't enough jobs to go around. Most of the positions are already filled by established professionals.  
---
[More here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/at2x7d/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_february/ehde2df/)
---
Mining is a mind-numbing pastime. There are a few who claim to enjoy it but most miners hate it so much that they take every opportunity to go AFK out of boredom. It's also a no-talent profession with zero barrier to entry and therefore not valued on corp application, except by corps which would exploit you.
---
Now, in case you're feeling discouraged, see my answer to: [What goals should I set as a new player?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/at2x7d/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_february/ehaojo7/?context=1)
---
&gt; Also, limit the citadels per constellation please.
---
In before defenders filling their space with citadels so no attackers can anchor a staging citadel. A good way of doing it would be a soft cap above which more fuel would be consumed or something like that I think.
---
Calling an in game character a cheater - true or not - is not harassment. You are painfully transparent with what you are trying to do. This isn't my, or the mod teams, first rodeo. We don't "let goons harass the guy" - we let game propaganda happen as it is literally a part of the game. Don't like it, don't play. Or sign out of reddit.
---
&gt; Calling him a cheater when there is no proof / no justification.
---
Except that time he input broadcasted on a ton of characters in multiple chats / systems at once :P
---
CCP would have to be retarded to restart eve right now. they still have good amount of players, restarting is something you might see at 10k or 5k or even lower average daily users. 
---
They aren't gonna risk their 1 successful game on a maybe it will work restart, even adding another server would turn off a lot of current eve players and maybe or maybe not get some new players(that stay past 3months)
---
If it's sexy'beast then yea he moved to NOVAC psure 
---
small/medium gang roams and fights. as a smaller group, everyone matters. having fun on comms really helps the interest stay.
---
Make eve a dangerous exploration % fighting game again.    
---
That means, less capital umbrellas, less invulnerable home regions. Less intel.      
---
- Remove local    
---
- Nerf caps &amp; especially fax    
---
- Nerf supercaps vs caps    
---
- Make ressources scarce and worthwhile to fight for    
---
- Add that Stain lowsec gate
---
Can you guarantee a steady diet of mobile tractor units and low power astrahus bashes?
---
I've played a wee bit but space MMO's don't really hit the spot for me. I want Eve, but with swords, magic &amp; monsters! 
---
It is a risk, but eve is stagnant as fuck atm, and the economy and balance just seems to be getting worse, not better.
---
Adding another server would be a really dumb idea as it would split the playerbase.
---
Thanks for the new pasta, you insufferable moron 👍
---
sorta like 64-bit ints are larger to store then 32-bit ints there about double the size. 
---
so using slightly more memory isn't unexpected. 
---
&gt; "Plop one in jspace or hisec and it will NEVER pop.."
---
Hardknocks said the same I think.... Remind me how that worked out?
---
56 kills while seemingly being active 8+ hours a day, damn I'm jealous
---
&gt; Those who have had their shit stolen, and those who are about to have their shit stolen. 
---
Isn't the best way of reducing the risk by not giving access to hangars to people who haven't put in time for the corp? Just keep the profits under 100m/hr of doing things for the corp and you can just laugh at people who steal from your corp because they would've been better off running incursions/carrier ratting/rorqual mining/running (abyssal) deadspace sites or doing pretty much anything else.

---
Get a nullsec pvp corp and get gunnin.
---
Dude we have so many enyos in the fridge 
---
yes eve is stagnant, but it's a stagnant moneymaker for ccp 
---
restarting eve right now would result in exactly the same thing as adding another server would, old players would dislike it and be likely to quit over it and new players would be excited that they can finally get their "fair start" or whatever. problem is the new players have already quit once or more and the old players have shown a willingness to pay for the pleasure of eating the staleness that is eve. 
---
This is risky as hell, you trading good subscribers for maybe subscribers
---
Fair enough.
---
ily
---
I was planning to resub for the AT, but well...
---
That's too much code work, the game would get stale. I say treat it like the real world, and have "inventions" come out in game to counter things. Like a new script for HICs that stop a cyno. Some new cruiser module that fucks over caps somehow, etc etc.
---
*your game. 
---
Feeding my skill injector addiction.
---
It's a killboard showing very few actual fights and the occasional gank every few hours, with activity spread across almost 10 hours every day.
---
That's unreasonable time commitment to get a single sensible fight a week.
---
I miss you Mavwik.
---
I think 15-20b. It's still mostly mineral driven but it is quite a bit of LP. 
---
You sir are a bad person, and I will think very nasty thoughts about you for several minutes while reading r/eve and avoiding doing my job at work.  
---
VERY nasty thoughts.
---
It’s too much “code work” to change numerical values? 
---
No, it’s not. 
---
delete adcu from assault frigs. spodbrains shouldn't be able to ram from 50km away with no consequence and force off a faction cruiser by pressing approach. it completely killed ships like the slicer, confessor and nomen for solo, you just get shit on by an approaching frigate.
---
Seeing someone soloing in an AT ship get dropped on by carriers makes me sad.
---
Ways to have fun by dedicating ~2 hours a night.  Not waiting around at stations and rendezvous for 45 minutes before we get started, etc.

Get space rich, lose my blingy fits since I'm bad, repeat

Wow how sad :&lt;

---
Yea? 
---
Original owners? There was only one original owner and he lost it, everyone else is just some reprint version that CCP handed out :|
---
And by other ships will be provided we mean tackle like ceptors and the like. A nyx public roam, while probably hilarious, would also be hilariously tragic.
---
rent free
---
Zero-Point Mass Entangler
---
&gt; Add that Stain lowsec gate
---
This guy gets it.
---
Tragic? Is that how you spell "fucking awesome"?
---
Imagine bashing a keepstar with 2000 people on grid and no one defend it, what's the point of just making those 2000 people waiting so long to get that killmail they all want ? And I'm not talking about tidi. removing structure damage cap would help preventing the structure spam we can see around New Eden 
---
Fuck you all
---
We shoulda deleted reddit 
---
I may or may not be mistaken, but there is CSM that people vote for, they all have pretty much a lot of knowledge of the game and are, I think, pretty open to talk about community idea and only cherry pick the best one to bring it to CCP, CCP should listen CSM and the community, specially people who have no idea what they are talking about should just stay quiet and free reddit from terrible shitpost 
---
It would take spare time for me. Between work, school, and 4 kids I just don't have the time anymore. Eve is a part-time to full-time job. I miss my friends and had a lot of fun, and would love to come back. My last kill was fun https://zkillboard.com/kill/70482691/
---
Unfortunately we had to *nyx* that idea in the bud. Thoughts and Prayers.
---
i eagerly await your next dumbass idea.  
---
Oh wow. Yea, I guess I didn't notice you don't have any kind of point.
---
And your attitude is why Eve sucks right now. 
---
but Test's active krabing titan don't counts 
---
Not the answer. 
---
Used to have a titan only channel that was called biggest. Half the pilots in it didnt even own titans.
---
nice try tau
---
No issues with that here.
---
I'd bug report it.
---
It's called giving them a role. Caps fight caps. This gives smaller ships more impact. 
---
:swoon:
---
lmao
---
Caps are what people hate. A return to small fleets is what people love. Don't know what game you're playing, but you're not the majority. 
---
As the other guys said, the effort for payout is garbo. They could be trawling lowsec or null for the same amount of time and get vastly more engagements while still keeping the wormhole for crab ops.
---
But 9 times out of 10 you get blobbed on in low or null. Where is the fun in that?
---
So detailed and specific objectives to increase small fleet roams and bring back sub-cap ship fun is a shitpost? You're the one who lost it mate. People want clear objectives. Thus the new war mechanics. Deal with it. 
---
This is hilarious, considering they're only 25mil each 
---
Okay fair point , but BRAVE has been through a lot. To think they are gonna just not gonna blob small gangs is a pipe dream. 
---
He isn't wrong though.   
---
Who cares. They are memeing lowsec guys under snuff’s super umbrella, enough content for them.
---
ezpz
---
Plus you blow up all those structures and don't really get anything for it. People would be willing to grind structures down ad infinitum if it was profitable. 
---
At least their taking the initiative.
---
Sure, but POSes didn't have asset safety. 
---
Templis Guy has got it. 10/10
---
Asset safety and compensating for timezones are two completely different things.
---
He was... was in Bastion... lol
---
&gt; For fucks sake, someone said something mean to Of sound mind and they’re throwing a hissyfit and refusing to fight. Just. 🤦🏻‍♂️ fam.
---
when?
---
Try 6 minutes
---
please,,,, not again 
---
just let me play holdfast 
---
&gt;People either dock up and hide until you leave or drop caps on you. There is very rarely anything between that.'
---
Just wondering: Do you want smallgang pvp or do you want smallgang ganking of people that can't fight back?
---
Because it sounds like you just want to gank.
---
If you are even remotely afk in a rorqual, your drones will be gone in no time.
---
Started at Apocrypha, think I quit sub somewhere between Retribution and Rubicon.  I have tried in the past to return with  trials and such.  Lots of answers here that distinctly express my feelings from the time, plus the impressions composed from the experiences of others.  Mainly that lowsec became a huge time sink with very little fun.  More than anything I missed Uncertainty.  Having a hangar full of test fits, joke fits, sub-optimal and pseudo-viable fits (using them in [in circumstances like these](http://www.evealtruist.com/2012/10/the-tuskers-present-frigate-ffa.html) was a blast, as were kitchen sick [debaucheries](http://mangala.rvbganked.co.uk/all-back-of-the-short-bus/) like this), then undocking and seeing the same hulls and the same tactics for hours, jump after jump.  People were not only risk averse, they were averse to outcomes that weren't certain.  Since then I surmise that this contributes to the malaise of n+1 and capital powercreep that pervades the places where I see players talk shop.
---
Ultimately, mine is not a problem CCP could fix.  That is a mismatch in playstyles borne from human psychology.  I simply don't enjoy what almost all other players enjoy so in terms of Eve, I am the problem.  With me out, no more problem.
---
For those that stayed, I hope lowsec returns to a state that you can enjoy.  It was always CCPs middle child, but for a while, we made it work.  G'luck to ya.
---
He has admitted before that he cloaks roughly 20 at a time. So he forgot to cloak 1 set of his today and thus poof.
---
so capital ships bore me, so instead of sabing for those, i put my isk into abyssal stuff to fit up really buff versions of sub caps. 
---
my dramiel is my baby. its been lovingly called a "poor mans AT frigate" by my friends.
---
Also ran into issues (and I wasn't alone) where the client was only using 30% CPU, a few gigs of memory, and under 20% GPU, yet slogging at sub-10 FPS.  This FPS doesn't recover no matter what unless you restart client, and then quickly starts to degrade again.
---
At least have the decency to rephrase it rather than passing the thought on as your own.
---
&gt;  Carriers/Supers are easily countered with ECM drones
---
classic WHer complaining about how they are treated lmao
---
Goons just want to hang out and be friends.
---
I played about 5 years ago and stopped. recently I caught the Alpha news and thought about starting over but after playing for about a week, I realised that the community is quite different. Less newbie friendly, colder attitudes abound. Plus alpha is dumb as hell. I personally think they should just let you play 1 month full trial then let people decide whether they want to pay or not. Playing an alpha account is like foreplay without sex. Pointless and disappointing.
---
are you back in eve yet
---
CCPA at its finest.  Looks like a reskinned BDO launcher.
---
Revert the server back to the Crucible expansion.  
---
Or bring back skynet. 
---
[I mean, it's possible](https://evemu.fandom.com/wiki/Crucible_Project_Status), but it will help if you know how to code.
---
Your mistake is thinking Eve will be around in 5 years
---
Really depends on what you are doing, and what you want to accomplish. Are we talking hisec, low, null, wh space? One comment said be hyper and active I agree with that, create that within players. Unfortunately I dont feel that small corps working autonomously are viable in the game at this time. Not that you can't make it work, but its insanly difficult. If you really want to enjoy content you need to be part of a bigger entity.  
---
Abyssal sites, although recently finished my goal of T5 clear in frigates and in cruiser.
---
I like the Abyssal PVP even though it is flawed, and want to do an exploration roadtrip into nullsec with a blingy Tengu.
---
Not sure what I'll do after that but I'm enjoying blingy carebearing for now. :)
---
Good ideas here, but shoot how much effort is involved when folks like you have corps that have all this setup already?
---
Mate, get that knot out of your vagina, you're not talking sense.
---
People dont complain of about defending, people complain that end game pvp content is considered the norm for defence. Super Caps and Titans weren't meant for dropping on a small gang having a roam and your literally whinging because of one method to get around the supercap umbrealla obviously annoys the shit out of you otherwise you'd effectively combat it, which you haven't.
---
Those pansies you mention are literally no threat to infrastructure, just day to day activities.
---
I really, really, really like spaceships.
---
The reason I don't play EVE anymore is because all of the game systems are rich-get-richer and I'm not one of the rich people. Everytime people will say things like "it's really easy to make isk, you just take your 2 spare dread pilots into a C5" as if the 10 billion isk that represents is nothing to them.
---
*For fucks sake, someone said something mean to Of sound mind and they’re throwing a hissyfit and refusing to fight. Just. 🤦🏻‍♂️ fam.*
---
I wonder if they're refusing to fight or they just can't get a fight with a corp that won't fight anything that threatens their nano-only doctrine. 🤔
---
Lol @ all these suggestions, if they did any of them then hi sec mining would be more profitable and less risky. 
---
This is a bad take, please don't post anything like it again. 
---
New player here. Why is this Subreddit and the Eve community in general so doom and gloom right now? Is Eve actually dead?
---
Get good and you can fight them just fine. It's not particularly difficult.
---
&gt;I'm going to low/nul
---
Why not J space? 
---
Just don't engage this retard, it's not worth your sanity.
---
no
---
To accomplish that at this point would require an entire reboot of Eve I think. 
---
[Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/axp3gy/why_do_many_of_you_guys_hate_skill_injectors_so/ehvlciz/)
---
Also, the question has been asked so many times... there's a limit to rephrasing a basic answer.
---
Because it's not really to much effort (especially if this is something he does already) and it's very rewarding of that's what he's interested in.
---
To be able to sell whatever I have I’m my cargo
---
Would subcaps be able to effect caps in any way?  This includes Hic bubbles.
---
Can you swing by Geminate some time please?
---
For those in high positions to either step back or step up and provide content for eve. It has gradually gotten worse over the years, backroom deals, diplomacy, bluing everyone and refusing to take risks in fighting big offensive wars. 
---
You are backward.  There is a reason that everyone is getting bigger toys.  It is because it is the natural progression of the game.
---
[Who da fook is dat guy?](https://i.imgur.com/KhqBYZY.jpg)
---
That argument shows up anytime anyone mentions being unhappy with smallgang pvp. "you just want easy kills".
---
Ganks are typically a route to force pvp. However, what you tend to find is that either the gank targets dock up (thereby eliminating the chance of a small escalation), or light a cyno and drop a few dozen caps on you (thereby killing any chance of fighting the escalation).
---
I'm not looking for easy kills just because I can't fight caps plus fax support with 10 jackdaws or whatever.
---
??
---
Logging in to mine is boring but is the best way to progress and there is only so many ships you can lose in PvP before it starts to get a bit stale.
---
Some kind of massive change might help or I'll just have to wait until I might get the itch again.
---
We made you all change passwords at least twice. Mission accomplished for my part. :p
---
~~checkmate~~
---
No EVE isn't dead. It certainly isn't in its hey day anymore though. There are definitely some issues that are only going to continue with time though.
---
This font should be illegal.
---
I said go to like 20ish minutes into the video
---
64bit programs objectively use more ram, and in classic CCP style im betting its going to be a lot more.
---
&gt;Super Caps and Titans weren't meant for dropping on a small gang
---
Supercaps and titans aren't "meant" for anything. They're just tools, to be used at the owner's whim. You're projecting what you feel should be the ideal onto a completely unrelated reality.
---
Also, they are a threat to infrastructure, because they are there. Any hostile in our space is a threat to everything we own, which is why they are to be removed with disproportionate force, to the best of our ability. This is true regardless of their stated or actual intent. 
---

The beatings will continue until moral improves.
---
clearly crying about it is working much better
---
Yeah, the apostle was primary then three brawl dreads died quickly before your third Nag died
---
I noticed that too and had a good chuckle.   "Content".   
---
An example would be the TRI move op a few months ago. 
---
Most victorious armies keep the banners of fallen enemies as trophies... sometimes the banner is really small and the enemy not really noteworthy, but we keep the banners.
---
Largest single loot drop in game. Not a whole lot. Pick one.
---
Isn't that how games work? You're not supposed to lose. You're supposed to win. I try my best to not lose in every game I play, even when I'm not risking anything. It costs me nothing to die in a shooter. I just don't want to die because I want to beat my opponents and if I die that means I lost.
---
Damn them, making literally THOISANDS of ISK
---
Your detail and specific objectives are shit though and NOT what everyone wants. So fuck right off.
---
Of course. Nothing will change with sub-caps. the change is to caps to make them more of their own specific role. I mean no one complains that a logi ship can't run lvl 4 missions. Caps should not be the end all to sub-caps fleets. 
---
Man you are triggggeeerrrreeedd
---
I never claimed to be a good poster tbh
---
dont make me cry.....
---
I mean you are basically asking ccp to change the game because nobody wants to play with you.
---
Maybe the problem isn't the game, but you?
---
That's fine and dandy but they need more specific roles. Caps should not be the end all to sub-caps fleets. No one complains that a logi has a specific role. Caps need to be counters to other caps... not the end game for all.
---
I dont consider myself space rich tbh, i rarely have more than a couple of bill liquid, its All about have solid income methods. Like i used to do solo Gila and later rattle in c3 for isk, its still not bad at all, rattle is 150-200 mill/hour depending on bling/skill
---
tri knows whats up :D
---
WHICHHUNT
---
I find it odd that you don't have a wormhole corp tag 🤔
---
Considering how you no longer have any actual leadership because you guys were abandoned yet again, trying to float on the fumes of your last few content creators is just sad.
---
Seeing you guys flaunt how much "fun" you have, and how that equates to welping and doing dumb shit with hardly half a clue, hiding behind a wobbly "it's just a game, we enioy playing like this!" when all you're trying to do is coast off the image tiny made for you..
---
RIP mcav tbh.

That has to be the dumbest idea I have ever heard.  Why would anyone use Capitals then if the easy counter is to just throw subcaps at it.  This proves that you are utterly clueless and should stop posting.
---
You are a fucking moron and this is my last reply to your idiocracy. You literally ignore what's written.
---
Supers and Titans weren't implemented with the idea of building fleets of them. Of course they're tools your moron, but a titan and super were meant to be 300T excavators that you dont see very often instead of hammer which ever tradesman would have on hand, that was the idea behind there implementation, hence the original name of 'Motherships'.
---
It's not what I 'feel' is ideal for the game. It's been proven to be ideal, the game can't handle everyone being in a capital ship that's been shown by mass TiDi fights and numerous posts about balance within eve.
---
If they were able threaten to infrastructure, then they would be, simple as that, but they are not because they can't.
---
In Dex we trust.
---
Probably the n3 renter wallet theft
---
Judgement Day or some of the huge t2 bpo heists. But I was meaning loot drops from fights. It was a good loot drop. Should be more. Everywhere. More losses too, less safety.
---
I think possibly ... But ...
---
CCP is constantly working on UI stuff. They know its crap. To my understanding there are 2 main things holding up the large scaling side of things. 1st is the low end scaling, they would have to disable some more low end scaling to enable higher, 2nd is the 64 bit client, that will give them more memory to play with the UI as well as the rest of the game.
---
64 bit client is in the works and coming, but I don't think they will be willing to disable the decrepit crap too low display support.
---
Unfortunate, as Eve Online is the only game I have for which I had to scale my monitors down from 4k to 2k because of the shitty UI scaling, lack of scalable fonts etc.
---
At least u got the Karl Marx part right
---
I don't see why this is a problem, CCP should just make all sites spawn rats infinitely 
---
1. Always be drunk or half drunk
---
2. Dont be afraid to commissar members. Morale must be maintained at all times.
---
3. Blast the Soviet national anthem on comms once daily to remind your corp members that they are working to build something greater then them
---
4. Maintain constant wars and hate grudges for the constant development of content and content related activities
---
This is pathetic compared to a delve second
---
You're too dumb to realize no one ever had the retarded idea that anything was unassailable if you put it into the context of nullsec alliances. Especially goons.. When you put over 2k characters in a wormhole, which is absolutely an unlikely thing from all standpoints in all eras of this game, no shit context changes. 
---
It was unassailable within the context of the space it was in. Obviously literally fucking anything is not when you use 2000 vs what maybe 200? Lmao.
---
It's honestly sad how even people who clearly have the capacity to function at a higher level than a sperg f1 monkey choose to keep that mentality to be more approachable by their denizens. I guess you do what you gotta do bud.
---
But no one outside of your autistic echo chamber falls for it. So keep on responding to people you know you're not fooling in the off chance one of your minions comes across it so they'll keep on pressing f1 :) 
---
&gt;Isn't the best way of reducing the risk by not giving access to hangars to people who haven't put in time for the corp?
---
Like a year?  There are plenty of stories of people stealing after working in a corp longer than that.
---
..........just....wow
---
i'm confused, is this something new for anomolies?  or is it a security mission?
---
i thought they all had a limited spawn.  well...outside of the labyrinth thing.
---
is this a new site, change, or some site i've never seen o.0  
---
seems like something CCP would avoid considering they say they want to stop afkers, and this seems built for afk....
---
That container is opened to the right of his other inventory. Most people do this for cap boosters OR ancil boosters, because you can hold extra cap boosters. Completely irrelevant to which one it could be. 
---
Testy. I'm pretty sure my ideas are better than yours... Oh wait... You offered nothing! Just a troll poster. Nice. 
---
Didn't. Doesn't change much. Imagine your immediate responses to 1000 issues about which you didn't interact or agree with us.
---
Im in no way affiliated with Waffles.
---
I've been on several of their public fleets and always had a good time.
---
Caps are for caps protecting sov and taking sov. For structures. Etc. It's called making a balance change. So tell me then why you don't see 100% logi fleets if they can just rep everyone. 
---
It's ok. We don't even fly triages
---
no sovwanding  to capture sov  
---
CCPls give us the last BS hull
---
Same man
---
Not everyone is out to create an empire.  I prefer smaller fleets,  but actually getting a good challenging fit that is winnable is so much harder these days. 
---
You're right, I looked again and didn't notice the medium container in his hold.
---
Bots can target and use drones. Its more effort but doable. That change only hurts players.
---
All the carrier and super bots already target, so.. 
---
That's not for my expressional freedom though. You made it clear on your jabber that you don't care about that. You probably didn't want to give me further ammo.
---
Immunity is not more impact, its complete and utter domination with nothing the ship in question can do. It's like pre nerf ecm ( like 2007 pre nerf ecm ) but worse
---
&gt;trying to float on the fumes of your last few content creators is just sad.
---
Assuming we only have a few content creators like other corps and we're entirely full of F1 monkeys who sit docked up outside of FCs calling for stuff. 
---
&gt;flaunt how much "fun" you have..."it's just a game, we enioy playing like this!"
---
You've obviously never experienced the awesome chaos that is ramming enyos and deacons at carriers or blobs and coming out with shiny kills for almost no investment. Also "Your idea of fun isn't my idea of fun so you're obviously lying" is very sociopathic my dude 
---
&lt;3
---
I like it tho :(
---
Different Corp to Corp. I think our ad says 20mill+SP preferred. But I joined with 5mill. For us as long as your main goal in the game is PVP and you want to live in wormholes your usually accepted. I’ve also started to dual box my main and an alpha alt with under 4mill SP and even alone and not in a good group I pull in about 180mill in blue loot per hour. Not as good as running with a group, but easy to jump on and run a site or two everyday between errands.
---
big oof 
---
A Grath post I can get behind
---
If I didnt have other stuff planned this weekend, it would be the first time in months I actually logged in to go.
---
Hey, if you go to Jita local I always see people selling geckos at 10m, maybe you can buy some of those 
---
That's a very convenient argument. Making "winning" such a vague thing that it can mean basically anything, and claiming *that* makes the game pay-2-win because PLEX can be used for a variety of things.
---
No. I'm sorry, but that in no way holds water. The concept of "pay-2-win" as a negative aspect of today's gaming scene is based on it giving one player an unfair advantage over another play in whatever player-vs-player competitive game-play it offers. If all it does is give player A the ability to achieve some personal goal that doesn't affect how a PVP fight would turn out, it doesn't count. 
---
Quite the contrary, in EVE at least, if PLEX causes people to field more valuable/interesting things more often and more easily, I'd argue that is a good thing. I mean, who doesn't love having a faction super screwing around, giving you an opportunity to drop it?
---
Usually I just kinda laugh at how inexorably dumb he is, but this has been an insight into how truly dumb people can be. Convinced he has logic on his side, he becomes the most illogical person I've ever seen. On top of that, I'll get lumped in as a Goon apologist/shill despite not having had a relationship with GSF since pre-Fountain war.
---
&gt; Seeing you guys flaunt how much "fun" you have
---
Imagine being so out of touch that when someone else says they don't enjoy tonguing eachothers assholes about KB stats you instantly think "lies" 
---
My flair won't work for some reason. It's supposed to be Wormholer but it just won't show up.
---
WH small gang and small fleet PVP. Also the people, and having goals.
---
I’m excited to try this!  See y’all there!
---
Not immunity. It's called forming a proper fleet to support them. It's called playing Eve. Caps shouldn't be the end all to sub-cap fleets. They fill a role and just like any fleet you need a variety of ships to support every role. Do you even play, bro?
---
Considering I have way more inside information than you seem to think is possible, as if your Corp is some sort of impenetrable fortress that can't have leaks lmao. You wanna talk about sociopathic, trying to publicly dissuade an image because someone said something that strikes close to home and has come from mouths that feed you is closer to that. Just let it go, no one is fooled about mcav being a shell.
---
Im pretty sure they've used dreads before
---
If it’s boring, don’t do it.
---
Some people love mining, some people love running missions or ratting, some people love hauling, or industry, or PvP, or FCing. Find what you love and do that. Leave the stuff you hate to the people that love it.
---
That's okay, there'll always be more ^^
---
&gt;idiocracy
---
This isn't a word, moron, it's the name of a movie. Plus, we have the third-grader-tier struggle with homophones. "Your." "There." Are you sure you want to be claiming idiocy when you can't even write correctly?
---
Also, gosh, I wasn't aware that we were dropping our entire titan fleet on every Atron that waddles into Delve. That must get expensive!
---
Wait, I've pieced it together. When we drop hundreds of titans on an Atron, that Atron has won the ISK war from the fuel use! Holy fuck! You'll bankrupt us! SHIIIIIIokay but seriously you're retarded. When an Atron gets dropped on, it's a couple of bored dudes taking a break from crushing into a powder and pounding a rail of Spodumain. If you and yours can't be arsed to provide the threat to that guy, that's on you.
---
The server can't handle everyone in subcaps, either. Piling lots of dudes into a system makes it run like shit. Truly, I'm breaking new ground here. Ironically, titans are probably better for performance than a lot of ships in Eve because of their slow-firing doomsdays. 
---
Players inherently seek the easiest way to "win", regardless if that undermines how fun the game is and especially if it effects the fun of others. Unless you can get every single person in eve to agree with you then the changes need to be made by Ccp because once one douche bag decides to get advantages in the game in some way others also will.
---
Topic got old tbh
---
PvE missions that aren’t me vs 100 dumb ai ships.
---
Every single battle should be you vs a single ship, or maybe up to 5 ships of a class based on the mission’s difficulty. I want said ships to be intelligent. Obviously they can’t be as good as top tier PvPers but they can be far better than they are.
---
Also, more relevant world PvE outside of missions. I’d like to FEEL like a pirate without having to do PvP.
---
Well you have fun playing your version of eve my dude 
---
https://i.imgur.com/oWpGCDd.png

Ship spinning.. some days I feel like going anti clockwise but then my Corp mates remind me only perverts do that .. so I don’t... ok fine.. I may have done it twice in college .. whatevs
---
Fighting is my serious answer .. bomber fleets but fighting ..
---
When ca. We see the first release of this content.. asking for a friend 😘
---
&gt; out of game infrastructure they need to be competitive without shelling out hundreds of real life dollary doos to support their in game needs
---
What the hell does this mean? I have allianceauth, SeAT, Pathfinder, and Teamspeak 3 running on a vps that costs $15 a month. There are a lot of problems for small alliances right now, namely, you can't actually partake in sov null unless you bend a knee to someone, and even then you'll likely get farmed into oblivion, but tech infrastructure should not be an issue if you have someone that knows a little bit of Ubuntu (and I mean a little) and can read documentation.  
---
As I said, ditch the corrupt player voting system and have players apply for a postition on that years' focus group. CCP should take player background and profile into account for the selection, securing a more varied CSM that better represents the player base: Nullsec, highsec, wormhole, alpha players, etc.
---
CCP schill.
---
it was honestly enjoyable reading you shit on this kid querns 
---
If Judy deletes this then he's straight 
---
I've not deleted any of these
---
cuz im the crazy neighbour who doesnt like paying more for the same stuff
---
There go all the dreads I sold BL :(
---
All of Eve space is infested with bots, sadly.
---
The entire Imperium input broadcasts. Every day I undock my 56 Rorquals and use the power of input broadcasting to wipe belts in 5 minutes.
---
So I haven't left, but I've been sort of on a "should I play eve this week or not?" sort of situation for awhile now.
---
Honestly right now the game play for me is log in, check if the system is camped, maybe rat for a bit for some cash, then really sort of nothing.
---
I love the pvp in eve, and I know it's out there somewhere, but I rarely have 2-3 hours to roam, so I usually just hang out for a bit, maybe an hour, for someone to stroll through the area I live and maybe fight them.
---
At this point I've been "playing" eve for 13 years, I have all the subcap skills trained and caps bore the shit out of me, so I rarely take out anything big for pvp on my cap alt, and just let him collect dust mostly.
---
Really what I'd love to do the most is take out a smallish group, maybe 10 guys, in non-kiting ships, and get a good slugfest going with someone.  That's the dream, but it's happened so rarely for me in the last several years that I've given up on that pretty much.
---
But ultimately, there is just no consequence anymore. I'm far, far from the richest guy around, probably quite poor compared to most who have been playing for this long, and it's even easy for me to replace ships, even relatively expensive ones.  Losing a BS or a pirate cruiser or hac just has no impact at all, which is sad, because that's what drew me to this game in the first place.  The fact that when you lose your ship its gone, and even back then you could lose skill points from not updating your clone.
---
So what would it take for me to play again regularly?  Make it so I care about anything, anything at all.  Isk is worth less than the pixels they're displayed with these days. 
---
So if we follow your logic caps are to be used to defend sov. They’re not going to be able to lock subs, or at the very least be shit against them for whatever reason.
---
Then you use caps against those caps, but if they’re basically useless vs subs, why field caps at all?
---
Can't think of a thing that would bring me back.  Eve was part of my life for 15 years, and I have a lot of great memories of it, but nothing lasts forever.  I hung it up when CCP sold out.  I've been through the final slide of games to the bitter end before.  No interest in participating in EvE's.  It was great for a very long time, and I'm grateful, truly, to have been a part of it.  Thank you.
---
Saying there are too many Titans is like saying there are too many frigates, they are a ship in the game and the players are the ones who are building them. If we say remove Titans or decrease the amount of them in the game which players have to lose the chance of flying one? Who gets to choose? And would we stop there, if the amount of Titans allowed in game was nerfed or decreased in some way which would be the next ship to have that happen to, Supers, caps in general, HACs, Command Destroyers or any FOTM that players don't like. 
---
Spoken like a true goon.
---
&gt; It obviously has a demoralizing effect. 
---
Reading must have a demoralizing effect on you because you’re fucking reading averse.
---
It’s fascinating how on message you are though. Like a little toy I can pull the string on and have it say objectively ignorant things at will.
---
u wanna know the best part?
---
Use cheap t1 ships. 10 moas is 5k dps for the cost of 1/3rd of a loki.
---
Dont PvP for the first month at least, you'll have less than half the hp and damage output of anyone you face even if you get a lucky 1v1. Find if you enjoy ewar in fleets otherwise.
---
Only counting what's on zKill. 
---
I twice put nails through my foot... once I slipped off a hiking trail in flip-flops and stepped into a knee-high slough and stepped on a board with a nail in it.  
---
The second time was running barefoot down a boardwalk and managed to find a stray nail that had worked it's way out of a board.  
---
Welp. 
---
Sauce?
---
Caps kill structures and are needed for final stages to gain sov and take sov. I can use your argument with any role specific ship in Eve. You are illogical. 
---
don't be a ceo unless it's easy

just join another group with your friends if it's a hassle or pass on the torch

There has never been a big problem with the amount of sub caps, nor carriers/dreads. Supercarriers were nerfed (from motherships), and I’m not sure how many feel about them now, but they weren’t a big issue after said need (previously they were ratting ships on steroids rarely used for PVP).
---
Titans have always been a bit weird. It is why they have been changed so much.
---
The trouble is that CCP made it so that anyone can buy the BPO, and they are unlimited in runs. They can be copied infinitely as well. They also made them way too valuable. They literally were meant to be a rare E-Peen ship that created conflict. They were just that for a long time. 
---
Now, they are necessary in all conflicts for 0.0. This excludes new alliances from forming easily and taking over a spot of 0.0. As TEST did many years ago and even for them they had a hard time doing so without the supers that older alliances had.
---
This is a hind sight 20:20 comment, but they could have limited the BPCs and never released BPOs in order to keep the populations low.
---
Could I ask, how long have you played eve for?
---
Lol irl poors
---
The problem is thinking you need to kill the rorquals which half of the time are worthless by themselves when your real target should be the drones. 
---
story?
---
Thank you. The passion is there I just havent excecuted it well.
---
Well put. Thank you
---
I want to be able to build my own little self sufficient homeland and be either capable of holding it against giant power blocs or change space so that it's prohibitively far for giant alliances to project across the universe.
---
One step at a time. Pick one thing that you can, or would like to change, and try to do that (the smaller the better).
---
Momentum is a powerful thing for internal and sea change 😀
---
True, but it took some time and almost quitting before I realized that, others may have had better experiences. Take it with a grain of salt 
---
yes
---
Its a site that spawns in Deltole, for years people have been afk farming it all day every day. 
---
It’s been a thing that has always been there. I’m still passionate about creating an awesome gaming environment. 
---
Thank you, that's exhaustively
---
Its rewarding till someone makes it not rewarding lol
---
Chillin with my long time buddies in wormhole space. Sometimes its quiet and we make money and shoot the shit, sometimes everything is on fire and complete chaos. Just gotta find the right group, and never burn yourself out. tldr wormhole space and good space friends is my personal fav
---
So I logged into my accounts, how long ago did CCP decide to pause everyone's skill queue again?
---
Remove injectors, add monthly or at least quarterly balance patches. The whole reason for switching away from the half-yearly expansion cycle was to have more fluid balance passes and feature releases, but that turned out to be a complete lie.
---
I’m passionate about creating a group of good duders, finding them and keeping them is the hard part for me.
---
Dude chill or just k ow ur a faggot
---
trying to create something is artificial and doesn't work
---
just be you and if you find a group of people just join them and lead them if they want you to
---
shut the fuck up
---
Nobody gives a fuck
---
If everyobody does it nobody will have fun playing this game. There will be rorquals and capital alts everywhere.
---
Would have delayed the current state of the game by a year maybe 2 and that's it, nothing would actually change 
---
same with the specific skill sp extracting, you would have the same situation just slightly later 
---
Doing stuff solo is extremely hard in Eve. Should first learn the basics in a group that can teach you the ropes.
---
How would one go about disrupting this?
---
faction forts have been going down and down
---
You're a US army sherman crew member?
---
Sorry, we should set you up a "safe space" for you and other triggered ablooblooblooers.  
---
Is this a competition??
---
I've been playing eve since 2010.
---
I could understand changing the roles/needs of Titans up and I do agree that they are too necessary for any type of conflict. I just feel like they are a ship that is available to any player (rare E-Peen or not) and shouldn't be removed or limited in who or how many can be used. 
---
I would say something like make them more expensive or cost more minerals but all that would mean is in 5 years we'd be cranking them out of the oven like crazy since isk/minerals continue to flow as easily as it does now.
---
They use to be rare and much more of an E-Peen thing to own and one of the problems causing their proliferation is that isk and minerals became much, much, much easier to get but actually building and acquiring them did not become any harder. 
---
This is the issue. We've reached a point where optimal play is unsustainable. You either play well by blobbing, or you eventually get ground into dust by the blob. The way current mechanics work, there's not a whole lot we'd be able to do to avoid this.
---
Personally, I think that the entire capital warfare system needs to be rethought, and titans need to be something with heavily diminishing returns, where 500 mediocre titans actually runs the risk of being less impactful than 5 well-flown ones.
---
Only if you believe in the Greater Fool model of investing.  
---
And if you do, and you're wrong, congratulations! You're the fool!
---
i understand what this refers to and am in no way out of the loop
---
Yeah that's what carriers need, to contribute more to server load rather than less.
---
Being able to be competitive in small gang without needing to drop billions on ships and implants due to capitals.  
---
I'll be back in like 3 months boss :/
---
This is so sad, Alexa play Ignition by R. Kelly
---
**1st** Isn't really an issue. Eve is actually one of the only mmo where new player can beat even the oldest veteran.
---
**2nd** Isn't issue either. It's really easy to make isk now than when I started the game 10 years ago. Problem was almost worse back then than now.
---
**3rd** Cynos used to be even bigger problem before. You have to play smart to avoid them. Capitals being too strong against subcapitals is bigger problem.

stop blaming injectors for unbalanced rorqs 
---
You are complicit in these crimes judith....
---
It's ok, we all have our flaws.
---
You realize this is literally just a text post of some random guy saying something. There is 0 evidence here and I've heard nothing about this as an Init member.  
---
I think you're getting ruse cruised.
---
I'm an Init guy. You're tarded. We JCed to J5A for like 1 or 2 defensive fleets, we never changed deathclone or scheduled a move op or anything like that. It was literally just us responding to PL reffing some stuff.  
---
Get some solid evidence next time instead of playing telephone with the entirety of eve.
---
Honestly, some of the best times I've had in this game.   
---
Mad respect to our targets for the content.   
---
It was, honestly, the most enjoyable T1 comp I've been a part of in this game
---
They were originally designed to be supportive ships for industrial fleets,not the entire body of the fleet. Just take away their mining capabilities, period.
---
Then Hulks (the flimsy miners that they are) can receive some buffs to make them worthwhile once again.
---
Good to see a post about someone actually enjoying the game.
---
Well done on your kill ;)
---
You're wrong. We went home - via jumpclone. For a few defensive fleets. We never changed deathclone.  
---
Next time you want to do a D A N K leakpost, make sure you know a bit about the alliance you're posting about. Init tends to have several stagings that they keep active for a while. Hak is now one of them.
---
Get an XO. a one you can trust. delegate the behind the scenes work using him/her eg. logistics, diplomacy, baby sitting. and make him/her aware this is his job. and you can focus on activity. give him/her a Vito to stop you from doing dumb shit. and honor the Vito. 
---
now. stop listening to that one guy who always comes up with an "better" alternative. and maintain transparency on what the corp is going through. financially or morally. 
---
recruiters. treat them with gold if you have to. evey new person they bring in is a potential for the corp to grow in many many ways. 
---
the corp im in currently was on a low point, down to 3 alive actual people this time last year. today we can filed a 30 man fleet on our prime time. and have friends who will come and help any given day. and people who rely on our back up. well our kill board looks like a roasted bread. but that's the one thing our corp does not care about. RL first, we crab together, feed together.
---
plus. find that one ting your group want to do. ours was getting the hell out of null sec and go back home to WHs.

---
AAR: We had a timer in low sec to go to but was given the wrong timer sadly :( So we went on a fun roam. Roamed around ER and Insmother with nothing really happening. Missed a few ratting supers sadly. But then got to lower Insmother and found 16 rorquals. Spent about an hr warping around and messing with HAW titans. Teaching dictors how to make bubbles in line with enemy structures, ranges of enemy ships. Was a ton of fun, thanks FRT. at the end we just didnt want to burn home so we just warped to a thanny at 0, tried to burn him down before all the titans could burn us down.   
---
10/10 would do it again
---
harman, every time a major group goes on a large deployment, there is literally always people smelling blood in the water back home and it ends with ganks of retarded krabbers and sometimes reffed structures. Literally always happens. I remember PL smugging about killing morons in rorqs during the whole 9-4 thing last year.  
---
It's what happens when you move your caps out of range. Common fucking sense.
---
Exploration is activity that doesn't benefit as much from co-operation than other activities. It is most efficient to do solo. For example mining in nullsec will benefit Alot more from corporation. Or PVP. 
---
Also you can't really do exploration in fleets so your corp members will miss a lot of cool content that other groups could provide. Example of stuff they could be experiencing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdfFnTt2UT0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdfFnTt2UT0)

You're right, dropping supers on anything that moves is undeniably the meta.

Will you shut the fuck up? You're turning the init flair into a yellow star of David.
---
Yes, I'm laughing at your impotent wormholer rage. Rent free.  
---
I was a wormholer for almost two years, my corp that I put at least a hundred hours into grunt work as a director into building up into about a 100 man group in a C5 got evicted by Horde who brought in hundreds of C5 WR-bonused confessors for the final fight and reshipped no matter how many we killed, and I didn't fucking bitch about it because it was a good fight. And we were a bunch of spergy noobs compared to HK. It's really funny to see the entirety of wormhole space completely lose their composure about this for months on end. It'll never not be funny. If you think that's 'living rent free' then yes, I guess you are now the resident court jester in my head. Congratulations.  
---
Wormholer btw.

No. Please no. You're killing me. No. Stop posting. I beg of you.

I only have a nestor. It was someone else much richer than me who was bringing the rattlesnake that i was keeping alive.
---
But, like some of the examples above, you can still all group up and chat/share these things.
---
Your don't need to fleet up to validate the need for a corporation.
---
If you don't have experience on pvp I recommend you start small. 250dps thrasher with t1 modules is 2mil isk. If you have 10 of those you already have 2500dps and the whole fleet only costs 20mil.
---
-Remove astrahus/forts/keepstar, no one wants to play station games there
---
-fix isk prices, litterally have to play for 5-10hours max farm mode to buy a t1 bc
---
-remove rapid light
---
-remove all the new wird ships
---
-revert back to old wardec rules
---
-remove hisec safemode
---
-Get old hisec aggression back rather than the suspect thingy
---
Basically bring 2012 back because all the things i loved about the game was changed or removed
---
Its because there is no subcap counter to them. Battleships should be the supercap killers if anything.
---
Right, that's the thing, is the game is constantly asking for money in all areas of the game... Necessary infrastructure $15 a month, JF/cloaky hauler alt... 10 months of subscription time to train into? Cost to maintain, 15/month, cyno/scout alt 15/month. That's already $60/month for main toon, safe logistics, and out of game tools that are absolutely vital to not be considered a shit tier alliance.
---
Then your corp members will miss a huge part of the Eve experience. Especially if they are newer players who have never experienced it. 
---
Lowsec. I'm in one of the mid sized blocs. There's several about our size so there's even fights which swing both ways. All the while dodging and weaving around snuff. The nature of isk making in lowsec keeps groups smaller as you can't be totally brain dead and just mine spod or orbit the anom all day. 
---
Woooooop
---
Was there a BR for the last one? 
---
Curious if I should bring my six vexor alts to participate
---
I think this post sucks. 
---
sunk cost fallacy, that's what's keeping me here.
---
And can i have your stuff
---
And that would stop it? No. It would perhaps get you some jollies for a few seconds. I think the worst part of all this is the fact that you care how others play their game they pay for. 
---
The way to "farm" officers/faction rats is to find either some space with low truesec (-0.8 to -1.0) and a lot of belts, or literally any NPC nullsec, which is treated as -1.0 for the purpose of rat spawns, also with a lot of belts. Use an interceptor with a cyno to check belts as fast as you can. If you see an officer, you light your cyno and drop in your carrier. check these sets of belts a few times a day, giving a few hours for rats to despawn/respawn. Finally, find a goat to sacrifice cause its all RNG anyways.
---
Certainly possible. In fairness at least you actually deployed, points for that.
---
Wondering what to spend my 1 trillion on. 
---
Dude, no, not 'in fairness you deployed'. We are still deployed. There is no ping anywhere of leadership telling us to pack up. The OP just heard we went back to J5A for a fleet and assumed that meant we're packing up and moving back to J5A. Notice how he has no evidence, just his say so? There is no evidence. He heard through the grapevine that we went back for 'something', and in his mind that turns into "we are leaving Hakonen"  
---
Imma look real dumb if like 3 days from now we get another alliance update, but at the moment? There's nothing about us leaving and it seems like OP just took some liberty with us jumpcloning back to Fountain for some structure defense.
---
He said disrupt not stop.
---
&gt;Game's old, glory days are likely gone
---
This one very sentence is probably the best explanation for the current state of EvE and it wont get any better no matter what we do. The so called "vets" helped with building this game up, that is the reason for the rage. Let CCP do what they do best, fuck things up - willingly commiting seppuku.
---
Don't people have to engage in entosis for there to be entosis tactics?  
---
:thinking:
---
Context: Screenshots recently surfaced of Pohds allegedly claiming to have received nudes from two underaged teens, as well as saying some other disgusting stuff about them.
---
Pretty gross stuff.
---
I completely disagree with everything you posted about that. The bigger organizations pay FAR more than I do for the same QoL things for their members tech infrastructure. It's not like you even HAVE to have that kind of stuff, but it's the QoL Eve players have grown accustomed to nowadays. There is no way you can make something less work/maintenance for a small guy and not have it translate into helping the big guys far more than it helps the little ones, which means we'll have another bitchfest about that instead. This mentality of "I should be able to keep up with the big guys with much less stopping power and effort/investment involved" is how Citadel mechanics got to where they were before they were changed and frankly has no place in any sandbox video game. More people, more investment, equals more power. The box is already open on QoL, there isn't a way to put that one back in, nor would I expect CCP to try and fix something that has nothing to do with their infrastructure, but instead the infrastructure we players have built over time.
---
[I FIXED IT FOR YOU.](https://i.imgur.com/JJ5azRF.png)
---
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?
---
That was incredible.
---
Delve is pathetic.
---
Fuck it... I’m bored...
---
* Citadel mechanics suck balls. Asset safety can go fuck Hilmar in the ass with a cactus
---
* Fucking bots everywhere(and them really not giving a single fuck about it) especially since they sold out
---
* Whatching the developer dump time and resources into stupid fucking gimmicky money grabs instead of fixing what’s broken. The game needs a new transmission not a can of spray paint you glue huffing dumbasses.
---
* Roll back the speed creep. 6km cepters with bonused point range that not even the fastest drones in the game can catch is fucking stupid.
---
* Roll back the power creep, T1 frigates and up are straight up too strong. 
---
* Roll back the warp speed changes. I want to do something with a battleship that isn’t warp from A to B with the hour I have to play a day.
---
* Kill the panic module and reduce excavator yield to be roughly in line with a normal mining ship. Or make them use a siege version of a mining laser.
---
* Put dread guns back like they were. This HAW crap is stupid. 
---
* Supers and carriers can’t target subs. But they will gigawreck each other and dreads. (I don’t know how, figure it the fuck out, it’s what we pay you for). Fax reps work only 1/4 current levels on capitals and only on capitals. Remove capital cap boosters so neut pressure actually matters I guess.
---
* Make resources actually deplete and increase the time and randomness between spawns.
---
* Quadruple the amount of npc null space. Let it extend deep into null with stations to give small and large groups alike places from which to fuck with each other. 
---
* If you declare a war, you can’t rock in a station you don’t own or have really high standings with. Lock Jita and Amarr to prevent waring groups from being able to dock there. (Silly-ish, but if you wana swing your space dick in highsec it should stay out or get smashed. The concording of neutral logi took 10 years too long to come around) 
---
There's a nuance here you're not really showing though, the assault frigate has an ability to take alpha strikes and live that the T3D can't really match if you use the ADC properly. Assault frigate is more tanky, T3D is more everything else.
---
play with internet friends.
---
EVE has just changed. It used to be a dark place where morality was a hindrance—now it's teen rated. Space used to be dangerous—now there are safety features everywhere. It used to be hard—now it's been nerfed to make it more appealing to casuals. It used to be exclusive—now it's free-to-play. Skill training used to be unavoidable—now you can buy and inject skills whenever you want. We used to have a community team and special events—now those things are slashed to cut costs. We were told all these sacrifices were necessary, even a good thing—but we wonder whether they threw out the baby with the bath water.
---
Well, not if you're fighting a lone frigate, but against other stuff, yeah, proper management of mods results in a significant disparity between high and low skill. It's an additional layer of management.
---
drop a command centre on a planet, about 350, and just pick one - it doesn't massively matter.
---
I've never seen a Hecate fleet.
---
You don't have to be stupid rich, by rorqual mining as soon as you get your first rorq the standard is to put every shekel you krab into injectors for your second rorq, and then once you have that repeat until you have your desired amount of rorqs. 
---
You can very realistically get your second rorq in &lt;1 month, 3rd in 2 weeks, and so on. It's very common practice, and once you have your desired amount of rorqs you go on to inject super/Titan alts because you need those for PVP in the current game.
---
I just did this. You can buy plex on the market for next to no isk and plex it on the test server no problem, doesn't matter how long they've been inactive.
---
Hey mate, just wanted you to know this is a fucking retarded idea and you should feel really bad for having it.
---
Cheers!
---
But why not use a risk free Astra or raitaru? 
---
what a travesty
---
OK Google, contact the FBI.
---
Dropping supers  &gt;:D
---
You chuckled, don't lie..
---
Most retarded post of the year 2019 already, gz!!
---
If caps were not able to lock subcaps no one would use caps, period.
---
Also objectives is retarded, we want pvp, not another thing to sit on for 30 mins while the enemy is docked because you outformed them.
---
Ideas like this brought us fozziesov and you should feel bad for being a part of the problem
---
then they'll just write a script that keeps them in warp between random points to avoid getting caught. Sorry, I mean they'll stay at their keyboards warping many accounts to avoid getting caught.
---
That wouldnt totally break rock havens with sb bs fleet. Lol
---
Inb4 a super fleet drops in and ruins it for everyone
---
Neuts, do you even use them? You are not going to kill a tanked super if you dont have neuting... hey, even a brick tanked archon/chimera might be veeery hard. Same for active fit dreads, masterrace fax....
---
Get more skillz. Buy more injectors. Problem solved!
---
Yeah, you're right, the bigger organisations do pay far more and it absolutely is the quality of life Eve players expect that should be EXTENDED TO EVERY OTHER ENTITY IN THE GAME WITHOUT REAL LIFE WEALTH BEING A FACTOR TO IN GAME ENTITIES. We're paying our subscriber fees, PLEX is still on the market in abundance, skins are being sold constantly, where is the return? Players are creating and hosting the services that should be standard at this point and you are just letting CCP off the hook, because it seems that this isn't a problem for you, that's fine, but it is a problem for others. I shouldn't have to host a virtual server, learn Ubuntu, to compete in a game I'm already paying for monthly for 5 years including alt accounts and plex purchases. I think you fail to see that $15 a month, on top of $15 a month, and another $15 a month just simply isn't feasible for many players, has created such a high barrier of entry that the major entities of the game haven't changed, in what, 6-7 years?  How would making the tools players are paying out of pocket for out of game make those same players stronger if they were implemented in game, and free to use? 
---
&gt;This mentality of "I should be able to keep up with the big guys with much less stopping power and effort/investment involved" is how Citadel mechanics got to where they were before they were changed and frankly has no place in any sandbox video game.

Tooltip delay? 
---
There has been an option to increase tooltip delay for many years now.
---
&gt;1. Nerf caps - their use needs to be focused on sov, structures, and fighting other caps. They shouldn't even be able to lock anything else.
---
probably the dumbest shit ive read on r/eve so far
---
&gt;2. Create clear objectives - every null system should have leveled..... **we need objectives small roaming fleets can achieve in enemy space.**
---
its called enthosis
---
&gt;3. Sovereignty - Sov should have to be met and taken away in stages. The first stages should have to involve objectives with sub-caps, while the last stages would need caps
---
it was here before, its called Dominion SOV, prior to attack BC's Dreads, Tits and Carroers were shooting iHubs since it was fuckin pain in the ass. One day faggotry in CCP reached peak level and Fozzie SOV replaced Dominion SOV
---
Make it 2006 again.
---
Shut the fuck up...I hate Fortnite! 
---
Yeah guys, stop using the ships that were designed to the specific tasks you are using them for! For now on, no more bombing rorqual drones, you all have to jump titans in and boson them!
---
the updates will continue until morale improves
---
Generally speaking, with the 50% MWD sig penalty reduction, and the effect of a speed tank on mitigating damage with that smaller sig bloom, whilst still retaining the agility of an MWD, an oversized AB is not a good choice for an assault frigate. You're losing more agility than you are shedding sig radius for the HACs.
---
It cost few millions to start. You must learn Planetary skills.

I got the feeling FRAT is the only entity left nowadays that delivers good pew-pews and GFs regularly and on all scales for both its members and adversaries. EVE is dying.

So you can suicide gank a fortizar with Catalists with no way to defend it?
---
instead of making CCP make your job easier  
---
get better
---
*implying you can make profit of catalysts*
---
People who play the game and continue to play the game do so for the community they've become a part of. What people who've left want is of little consequence as they're not the sustainable long-term player eve needs anyhow. Players who'd come or go on a whim for balance or gameplay in a fifteen year old game will just as easily leave again once bored.
---
What is more interesting is what people stay for. 
---
2 box's of tips. First on CEO, second on FCing. (copy pasted from previous answers i've given on similar threads)  
---
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~
---
 So you wanna run a corp... I have some questions that I suggest you have answers for:
---
* Why should JoeBlow join you over XYZ other corp with similar recruitment pitch? What makes your corp special?
---
* Do you really have the time to dedicate to starting a corp? if you personally don't, do you have a core group to help you?
---
* Have you any people management experience? Not to get too corporate on you, but are you able to get to the core of why someone is upset, rather than focus on the apparent symptom, and solve that problem? People will have issues with how you do things, it's impossible to please everyone - especially in a video game where they pay money to be a part of your group.
---
* Do you have a financial foundation for yourself, so you can dedicate your "ratting time" to corporate needs?
---
* Do you have a financial nest egg for corporate costs? Just like in the real world, expect the corp to make zero isk for 6 months, assuming you spend any sort of corporate income 'correctly'
---
* If you wish to have an organization that is doing something where someone may wish to plant a mole, do you have a strategy to either mitigate their effect or screen recruits?
---
* Do you have the game experience to recognize when it's actually laughable to even think someone would spy against you, and have the perspective to realize when you're being too paranoid?
---
* Do you understand corporate, access list, structure, and space security game mechanics?
---
* Do you have enough disposable income IRL to be able to front services for your group, or will you begin with some free alternatives, such as Discord
---
A lot of people will tell you that you need a plan. You actually don't, not when you're starting out. What you do need is intent and a reasonable goal(s).
---
If you say you're a pvp corp and have no way to generate that pvp and no strategy to afford that pvp for your members, you will fail. Likewise if you wish to have an industrial corp, but do not have the facility or local to be able to support the industrial engine.
---
My point is not to discourage you, my point is to try and get you to understand that settings goals is a must, driving and executing on those goals is also a must. If your pilots don't have fun in your corp, and there is no sense of growth or accomplishment, people will leave for greener pastures. Depending on how you set up your corporate model, people play never become invested in your group, which leaves you holding the lions share of responsibility and burden, while they become fairweather friends.
---
Running a successful corp is a truly time consuming task. If you're up for it, fuckin do it tho dude. There are plenty of examples of small corps that hold space, all it takes is the drive and will to make it a reality.
---
Good luck

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

to learn to fc you need to accomplish 3 basic areas to research first as your **prepwork**
---
1. Know ship bonus's and their likely role. eg, huginn will likely be a long range web. sometimes a web and a painter. this is a support vessel, not a dps role. Know this across the board so you're familiar enough to know when you see X ship hull, its likely doing XYZ.  
---
While on the surface this can seem like a large task, its not. Break it done by hull class and by faction type. EG: Amarr have 4 flavours on their ships. Laser DPS, Missile DPS, Energy warfare, Support (Tank or ewar). So knowing this, you can look and quickly slot ships into a mental bucket.  
---
\-- It's an amarr cruiser! (4 possible buckets)  
---
\-- oh its t2, so its either a recon(support), hac(dps), or a logistics(healing/support)  
---
figuring out the racial flavours makes bucketing ships quickly easy, and that can help you determine how effective an enemy fleet is and whether you can take a fight or not. (or what to be careful of once you do)
---
2. Game mechanics. How do bubbles in nullsec work? How does aggression mechanics affect what my fleet members can do? What threat is an ECM ship to my logistics group when hes 20km away vs 150 km away? Grid mechanics, cyno mechanics, sov mechanics... etc. Again it seems daunting with the sheer size of things 'to learn about' but really once you dive into them you can see things that make sense to forget or remember as they apply to you. knowing this will allow you to avoid the super lowbar blunders that ruin a roam fast. like warping a fleet of t1 frigs and t1 destroyers into a smartbombing battleship whos bubble camping a gate.
---
3. How to do fast research on 3 things:  
---
\- who are you fighting &gt; what do they normally fly?  
---
\- Location location location  
---
\- whos friends with who
---
* how to find out what a group typically flies? go to zkill, search that alliance, and look for a fight that has both kills and losses. should take you less than 5 minutes to figure out a groups main doctrins
---
* location, identify bottle necks or choke points that you may accidentally trap yourself in. know escape paths, or ways you can sneak around a gatecamp to get at the juicekrabs behind, etc. Use dotlan for this, easy the best tool.
---
* google searches + zkill to figure out alliance/corp affiliations when you start out. once you do it frequently enough you just remember whos friends with who
---
As for **the actual FCing**, i'll really say 3 things to keep it simple.
---
* have an objective and tailor your plan to that. objective = get a fight and learn? cool. the plan is how you do that: fight on a gate, in a plex, catch a ratter, etc. plans are fluid. plans must change, because no plan survives contact with the enemy. the objective is important, figuring out how to do it with a rough idea is totally okay.
---
* keep talking, clearly and repeat orders. the worst ting is having an fc not speaking at bad times, freezing, etc. Make a decision, make the call. A bad call is better than no call.
---
* do your loops: Hows local? is it spiking? Hows our range? do i need to move the fleet closer/further? are we breaking the target? yes? keep shooting what your shooting. no? swap targets etc. are we holding? no? are we dying faster than they are or are we trading ahead and will stabilize? hows local? is it spiking? hows our range..... etc etc repeat.
---
The things are pretty broken, they are in range of citadels... no jump fatigue.. so why should I get good when the things are hella broken anyways? Just make tackled ships not be able to jump is all I say.

i understand timers are needed for entry level sov owning communities. but perhaps there might be another level, which some groups are already capable of.
---
perhaps some structures (not sure what) should only be defendable by multi timezone mega-corps / mega-alliance / coalitions. this top tier perhaps should not have the current reinforcement mechanics.

Wow. Correcting my grammar. That doesn't look petty at all. Triggered much? 
---
ESS were abused in part by being anchored in hellspawned anoms with a ton of rats. If there was a way to get around that it'd be a big step for making something like what you suggested possible.
---
However, until such a time, any structure like that will just be placed somewhere it can be abused.
---
It would be nice if you could siphon *something* from structures (or Rorquals) to make them skirmish without requiring a full reinforce. Idk how you'd accomplish something like that but I like the idea.
---

Well can u take a gate while being tackled ? New jump bridges aren’t anything else then playerbased gates .. so no

Mhh, where does he live? "Almost legal" could be 17, could be 11 depending on the local law.

if you are going to live in the space those structures would be cleared out eventually. if you aren't going to live there then you only need to clear all the structures to salt the earth to hurt the defender.

In the alleged chat logs he was bragging about it. One of the quotes went along the lines of
---
&gt;I've never seen a more beautiful picture of someone's nether regions before
---
How often does this happen?
---
I hate this situation as much as anyone but this mentality isn't to blame for it. If you're not defending your space with whatever means necessary then you don't deserve to have it. I'd drop caps on roamers too if I was just worried about my members being able to mine in peace in *our own space*. And I'd shit talk them in local at the same time.
---
It's CCP's job to set rules that encourage better PVP. People wouldn't drop caps on everything if it wasn't universally the best solution like it is now.
---
The only balance idea I've read that's actually good is for CCP to hire a dedicated balance team again.
---
These animals don't think what they're doing is wrong, they think it's all good fun and normal. Look at interviews with Jimmy Saville - he makes jokes on TV about what he was doing to kids.

Have you seen the MER for Delve? There's tens of trillions of ore mined every single month and it's been that way for years now. Here's an example below.

Monthly Economic Report - November 2018 | EVE Online
---
Imagine goons jumping around a 100 man titan wrecking ball DDing fortizars just because they can, and killing structures in 5mins just for the hell of it?
---
What would a small corp do about that?
---
[http://lmgtfy.com/?q=eve+online+planetary+interaction](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=eve+online+planetary+interaction)
---
Oh get the stick out of your ass about the event.
---
The event dropped an item with an rng loot table, literally no different to you getting an rng drop from the last npc, like every fucking event or pve activity in every mmo since the dawn of fucking time.
---
"I must strive to make this about goons somehow"
---
It's clearly not bullshit, but thanks for your input. If they make caps useless, they lose subs. Plain and simple. Don't be a dumbo. What CCP have the power to do, and what CCP have the scope to do without damaging the game further are completely different things. They could delete Jita if they wanted. Imagine how well that would go down. Don't use stupid arguments 
---
Am I the only person that reads this as they will have their own indy server like Serenity?
---
hence why everyone thinks this is good news is beyond me... another bot proving ground.
---
Honestly I'd be ok with Rorqs tanking nano gang without issue. The issue is that 10k dps is a full medium sized fleet worth of dps and it can tank that until downtime through neuts if a cap truck is available. Even without a cap truck fully loaded you can tank a medium fleet for an hour comfortably. 
---
Just drag the delay max to right
---
Wormholer btw
---
While it is a mostly solo activity - the niche would be a corporation that eases the logistics of operating out of NPC null in one or more regions.  That will also attract solo pvpers who like a little logistical help when roaming out of npc to sov null.
---
The idea of the corporation probably wouldn't be cooperative active play so much as a logistical backbone.  Also such a corporation - I wouldn't put trust very far - many of your most active members are going to be alts of guys roaming into an enemies null-sov.
---
Yes, let's keep Eve as risk-free and easy as possible. 
---
compare it to any other event, like blood raiders or guristas  
---
sites where shit, loot was shit, goals where shit, spawn rate was shit 
---
Iirc you could prevent someone from using a jump bridge before if you had them pointed. And seeing as you can’t tether or dock on any of the new structures while disrupted it is not entirely unprecedented.
---
So just another event, identical to the others, that nobody forces you to participate in.
---
nah man, make rock havens spawn capitals (alot of npc dreads) if they get cleared too quickly, but on a delay so a boson wont kill the dreads either
---
the issue is is that as long as your mouse is in the inventory window it doesn't reset that time so after 3 seconds you have the same issue
---
just have tooltips be optional, it'd be rather easy to code
---
He's 24
---
im a dude who likes running events okay? its the one thing that brings me back from my eve hiatus, playing for a week, grinding events and getting some dumb skins out of it is what i like, this event i tried to grind but was unable to as the site spawn rate was abysmal and i could not get any points in 
---
Yes. 
---
Every time Cloud Temple gets mentioned, it's because of some retarded drama. I wouldn't send people that way if I wanted them to stay in the game.
---
"Found my first corpse! It's still warm, might use it."
---
OH no
---
yup. 720p 32" TV. game looks pretty but not enough real estate.
---
Do try to keep up old man.
---
oh no 15 warriors will break the server, quick replace em by 27 einheris 
---
Varying degrees of freedom.
---
On one hand we have Goons.  In the middle we have Bastion and TNT.  Slightly more freedom you see INIT.  Never make it to the middle though before you run out of Imperium corps.
---
Gotta admit, I'm the same. Every time an event pops up I look at what I'll get for grinding the 1,000 points.
---
The gala event was a lot better than the frostline event.
---
In just get sick and tied of people bitching about loot boxes when it wasn't even close to being an issue since everything wrong with loot boxes was completely absent.
---
No witch hunting but I hope the people in that recording reported it
---
thank you op for sacrificing yourself to make it clear to anyone that searches the term "lootbox" in r/eve will see that #NOBODY WANTS EM 
---
So far we've been making efforts to do it once a month since January. Hopefully we can keep it up!
---
whenever i get bored w/ eve, id gladly cyno my haw phoenix/rev up to provi to do this, to learn from lasker himself how to HAW a dread, as i never tried it 
---
Can't help but feel bad for these dudes
---
hmm, what caused Test to work with goons?  lets see - could it have been the entire southeast, east, northeast and panfam (only PL sent supers) invading Immensea?
---
Great!  Love to join sometime.

Frigates bring down the death star just like elephants are afraid of mice. Complete the circle, dont create complex loops.

---
 고맙습니다
---
Well u can always commit bigger assets to kill them
---
Faster , so they can’t jump
---
Back in time 
---
Has nothing to do with risk free , commit heavier assets and u can kill them
---
In time 
---
I would say nice job and grats on the kill, and encourage you to go out and roam more in smaller groups and find excellent content like this, BUT
---
The carrier is already replaced because carriers are cheaper to lose than some t2 subcaps. Your kill has no meaning, and no value to it. Fuck you.
---
yes frostline was garbage, pure garbage, but the rewards also where pretty shite, on this event the skins atleast looked like something i wanted but could not get bc of it   
---
also saying that these lootboxes are bad only encurages CCPearl_Abyss to go further w/ the system and introduces "plex boxes" or something stupid for the next event where you can skip the grind for plex and get rewards instantly 
---
Hey globby just be happy that there's a lot of people who don't know what you do. That just means a lot of new players in the game and in this sub. 😎
---
Koreans will play on TQ like the rest of us.

or, use the attribute system to split skills into attribute flavored SP, Minmataar titan is Perception and willpower , so if you extract it you get 60% (primary attribute) sp and 40% (secondary attribute) sp  from it (sp amount based on the total SP in that skill), then you can inject generic sp(legacy injectors or reward sp/daily injectors), wich only yields 50% per attribute, or attribute specific SP wich yields you 100% of the sp for said attribute (or 25% for a mismatch)

Its all getting more difficult in the limited time I have and yeah for my fair share of pvp I already use SIGs and only get to delve if I need more money to fund pvp and maybe additional characters.

look at the rest of the game industry where they did the exact same shit, letting it happen in eve is not something the players want, and arguing it w/ "but they arent that bad yet" aint helping it either

Haha. Yeah, I can totally see the point when you explain it like that.
---
Know what's helping less? Shitting on good ideas because of some slippery slope bullshit. 
---
This comment thread won’t end well 
---
You expect CCP to create free infrastructure for players for third-party services that includes voice, services mimicking SeAT for corporation/alliance/individual character management and background checks, mapping utilities for wormhole chains, scanning, and other utilities, as well as authentication and management platforms for individual player corps and alliances? I mean, I like to base my arguments in reality, but if you honestly believe this, there isn't much here to discuss because you have no idea what you're talking about. I think you seriously underestimate the disposable income that A LOT of Eve players have evidenced by a ton of different things from the insane amount of accounts people have, to the real-life events, to the fact that these tools are so wildly popular and hosted BY PLAYERS in the first place. I've ran a corporation for well over 10 years, and multiple alliances over that time as well, all of them small, and I've never had a financial issue with people willing to pitch in to get things set up and going. Never even heard a grumble. I don't understand this argument at all. There is no other game company on Earth that does what you're suggesting.
---
&gt; More investment to whom? "The box is already open on QoL"? What are you actually talking about?
---
I thought this was obvious, but I guess not. The bigger groups typically have more people willing to invest more time and resources to the game and their specific entity. It absolutely makes sense that they would have a step up over groups who are not willing to do so. There is no such thing as a level playing field in a sandbox, if you want that, there's hundreds of theme park MMO's that might interest you.   
---
&gt; EXTENDED TO EVERY OTHER ENTITY IN THE GAME WITHOUT REAL LIFE WEALTH BEING A FACTOR TO IN GAME ENTITIES  
---
Sorry, that train left the station when PLEX was introduced. 
---
&gt;has created such a high barrier of entry that the major entities of the game haven't changed, in what, 6-7 years?  
---
Your assertion that the technology that GSF, or TEST, or whomever has in place is what kept them ahead is fucking dumb. These entities are ahead because they have the management and leadership to always be working towards something and have created cultures that appeal to specific people. Their out of game infrastructure has little - if anything - to do with their longevity and success. This entire game comes down to management on an alliance level. 
---
Problem is that this umbrella mainly works during US timezones which gets other timezones in a bit of trouble. Also as a member of Bastion I dont trust Bastion to be able to form something significant. Next thing I am in SV myself and currently I do fear a bit I have to leave the SIG in order to get anything done in Fountain :-/
---
The current meta favorise heavy defensive set up to farm safely over bold aggression, which is kind of an issue when you're not big on farming. It's an hard to balance subject hence why CCP hasn't taken a very big approach on the subject since a few years. Reddit warriors want things to change and have 100 different ideas, 99 of which are basically hatchet balance changes CCP would never implement.
---
The game isn't dead, it's just harder to have fun if you play a certain way.
---
how about: have tackle on the other side aswell and dont loose the gate jump game, the whole "deagress and jump" thing is as old as eve itself, or rather as old as the agression timer system 
---
China has no more influence on South Korea than it has influence over anywhere else that isn't a communist state. People like you who create narrative from nowhere are deluded simpletons. You accuse others of kidding themselves while doing the exact same thing yourself. But it's ok buddy. You're among friends who'll pat you on the head and tell you it's ok like the scared witless individual you are. There there, it'll all be ok.
---
you are saying these RNG boxes that gave you literal garbage for ~20m isk is a good reward system for eve events? 
---
CCP spending money on EVE instead of a doomed game? That's crazy talk.
---
They also gave faction loot.
---
Just because people didn't get faction mods every time doesn't make them bad. It makes people whine they didn't get showered with free isk. That's an issue with greedy players not game mechanics.
---
Exploration is not the way to go for Corp focus. All Corps should focus pvp and indy.
---
Active members and FCs are best for pvp
---
Members who can't log on as much can contribute with manufacturing/research/other admin stuff.
---
Fun equals long term team players, so basically winning at pvp and stuff. Losing and solo activities like exploration, might as well be the n similar chat channel since it does not really require a corp. 
---
You might be right. I just read some stuff on wikipedia and the wording is not the most readable for me. Not my area of expertise.
---
He probably also does not live in Germany ;-)
---
oh cool i managed to get 10000 units of this shite ore to get 5 units of shitanium and one of these passes , now i clear the site and approach the fort/astra, throw in 20m (avg) isk and get a damaged box, cool let me spin that wheel..... for (1)garbage... or a faction mod worth about... 700k isk?   
---
the guristas and blood raider events had a chance of dropping faction loot and skins in the boss battleships (wich spawned once per site), giving you a chance of getting stuff every site  
---
 now you need to finish about SEVEN sites to get a lootbox that has a pretty awful drop table   
---
DO YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE? 
---
You have to match angle and height too
---
This is great news for EVE. Hopefully with some 'local' advertising could see a good boost in numbers, especially for peeps around autz. 
---
We have a contender for the worse r/Eve post of 2019.
---
Yeah, you're bitching that you weren't showered with isk like previous events.
---
To be fair, it's pretty stupid that you can use jump bridges even if hic pointed. I would be happy if they changed at least that.
---
Have you been part of German society?
---
But are there actually any Korean players/corps?
---

---
Remind me why I should split my fleet across multiple constellations to catch a single ship
---
Worm holer btw?
---
Yes, ofc but what's the reason to start undercutting the market when is dried up on a specific item. It's just you and the new guy, that starts undercutting. I get it that you do so when you see 100 sell orders but when you see only 1 or 2?
---
This is why I like to sell storyline type of modules, not everyone has the skills to manufacture them and the market is cornered by a few who respect each other and dont undercut. There is no need cause there are 4-5 guys selling them(on a specific item).
---
Respectable literature.
---
im sorry, but compared to a bloddy [rat faction] rally point these fucking event sites gave you fuck all isk, bc 90% of the rats dont have a bounty of em, and due to the amount of modules/skins dropped, they are avalible in good quantity and thus are not worth alot   
---
a forsaken hub makes you 40m isk, takes about 40 minutes to run, takes a 80m vni to run 23/7   
---
a event site gives you... 2m isk if the bs has a bounty (not even the carriers had one in this event) and a CHANCE of getting something worth maybe 20m isk, run time? bout 20~40 minutes depending on the site, needs a carrier or a faction BS (or gila) to be run reliably w/o too much risk   
---
   
---
if "getting showered in isk" is the issue here, you shud yell at combat anoms, not event sites 
---
Join a merc corp, a pirate Corp, and a null corp before starting your own. It will give you insight, build relationships, and help you get favors from friends all over new eden. 
---
ur mom holer btw ayyyyyy
---
More bots, yey!
---
USTZ plz
---
So I’m not the only one that read Korea and instantly thought “more bots” ? Lol 
---
Damn didn't realize they did other stuff. 
---
Also those Drek losses tho.
---
Yes, Test has the awesome Cloud Temple! 
---
So you guys are going to deploy EVE in South Korea, the worldwide reference in e-sports, and your answer for that is to cancel Alliance Tournament?
---
Leaves me with one (sad) question: Why are you still in Bastion then?
---
Maybe this move is possible to show you what your alliance is possible of and brings in some long needed movement.
---
Good luck with that - see you in SV :)
---
Yes. I already said so myself in another reply further down. 
---
We're on the same page.
---
Why in  the world would we make a server for Korea?
---
A strip miner that shoots out a bunch of rocks at tbe end of each cycle you need to click to scoop, like old relic/data sites..
---
Should edit it to cover the post title
---
*got em*
---
Still talking about the alliance tournament in 2019.
---
Overall of the whole tower / station, Abyssal space, new ships (pirates capitals + trig), new PvE sites that were badly needed, several balance pass on subcaps that were most welcomed. That's what, last 3 years ? How big were changes before that ?
---
Koreans are serious gamers and they have a strong anti-bot mentality. Their professional gaming league players get treated better than most athletes.
---
i sure dont care, however i pay to play so i can blow people to pieces.
---
Dont come to deltole tomorrow
---
I played SC2 for a lot of years, I’m more then aware how serious their gaming community is.. and how terrifyingly good they can be... almost bot like :p
---
So if you think doing combat sites, and buying the drops you want from the market is a better use of your time... Do that instead 
---
Oh sorry. My wording was poor. I was talking about the "almost legal" part, not about sharing nude pictures of teenagers.
---
&gt; lmao i looked it up, 
---
I would advice against looking up CP, mate.
---
scanning, shoot some sleepers
---
scanning again, kill some guys
---
scanning more, huff some gas
---
Get killed, ask to a friend to scan and find you an HS
---
but if everyone does it that way, the drops will go up in value, showering those few people grinding the event in massive amounts of isk 
---
good to know that some common sense still prevails :)
---
&gt;ㅇ ㅅ ㅇ
---
OwO
---
Only 531 Catalysts
---
Yeah lemme just split my fleet across 5-10 systems, what could go wrong
---
every thread accusing people of botting is a witch hunt thread
---
if there was actual proof they would be banned, not yelled at on reddit
---
Supply and demand working as expected. That isn't an issue, at all.
---
Even if you actually could split a fleet from which both sides could afford staying on a fort grid you would still miss tackle most of the time on the other side because the gate model is so big ships spawn more than 100km apart lmao
---
i was talking about normal gate jumps, not jump bridges   
---
afaik old JB's allowed you to jump when tackled, any nobody complained 
---
They are going to be aligned to goons or panfam, bothing new
---
is it common in germany to sext with and receive nudes from barely teenage girls that are 10 years younger than you?
---
~~This~~ That and so much more! C1 and C3 statics will give an optimal amount of explorers to catch and High secs to camp for maximum fun/hr
---
My corp pretty much. Thats the reason why since I dont want to leave them but I think in the meantime we could make a deal that satisfies 
---
Why are you talking about normal gates in a thread about jump bridges??
---
Old jump bridges weren't on enemy citadels, also note that they REMOVED old jump bridges for being too strong...
---
you really dont see what i was getting at dont you? if the drops are frequent, supply is there, and demand is near null, meaning that you DONT get showered in isk on event sites if every site guarantees you a drop as the stuff looses value   
---
if instead we have these rare drops that take alot to get, they will be worth alot and BOOM, billion isk faction mod for the one dude in the gila bc noone else is running the sites 
---
What is wrong with you?
---
Been there, done that.
---
I don't regret leaving them behind to find an easier life that.
---
But to be fair, my old corp are the exec corp of FCON now and not part of an at least functioning alliance :D
---
That's a good thread, surprising coming from you!
---
I disagree, I love my tethering, asset-safetying, PANIC rorqual, no-fatigue jump bridge, babymode eve-online. 
---
Will there really be an increase in players juat because of language support? 
---
Ma all the gods bless you.
---
Now if only they added a way to split my inventory to make it at least a bit manageable....
---
use station containers, and start building yourself filters bottom left
---
That's a very reductionist view of the thing, "just go back to the past, most problem solve".
---
If it was that simple even CCP would have it figured out, things change and thus the solutions too.
---
&gt; ethical and normal conduct for a well adjusted, functioning member of society? absolutely fucking not
---
Ethics and norms also vary depending on culture, they are hardly absolutes. I wouldn't state things on what functions in a society though, considering I have no idea what works in, say, aforementioned Germany.
---
Are these the good Koreans or the bad Koreans?
---
Honestly though resets are a very common theme in the lineage of persistent multiplayer "space trader" games I would say Eve belongs to
---
I haven't really thought about it like that in a while but Galactic Empire, Trade Wars 2002, and even the various MUDs in the genre that were arguably Eve's direct predecessors all tended to require regular resets due to economic unsustainability
---
Eve doesn't really recreate the conditions fully, in so far as the specific issue in most of those games was that when the economy reached a certain state, shortly afterwards there was a decisive winner, and it became generally impractical for opposition to exist at all
---
In e.g. Trade Wars the victors would typically spend the remainder of a "season" instantly teleporting warp disrupting death laser planet bases to anyone that moved anywhere in the game, which they would be notified about immediately due to filling all of space with detached fighter squads
---
Eve isn't quite that far gone in its "late-stage capitalism" phase :P
---
i already addressed this, the timer for this does NOT reset if you keep your mouse in the inventory window, and it also fucks other things too, like hovering over your wallet.
---
not a viable fix
---
All you're doing is whining the loot is worthless because everyone is farming it 
---
That's not an issue.
---
because someone else brought it up above   
---
also old JB's could be on grid w/ a bubble and pos guns, id argue that they where stronger as only bc a JB is on a fort grid, does not mean there are people in or on the fort, and there are also plenty of "stargates" wich are on some astra or raitaru, in systems w/ low activity 
---
No

[War in High-Sec, Of HQs and Diplomacy](http://thedantelionplan.blogspot.com/2018/08/the-dantelion-plan-war-in-high-sec-of.html)
---
This is the kind of conflict drivers I think could be used to give a reason to fight over. This one mostly takes High-Sec in mind though.
---
&gt; just have tooltips be optional, it'd be rather easy to code
---
It would, but how will CCP shove injectors down your throat?
---
Jk, they will definitely find other ways. Probably without removing this one.
---
If CCP wants me to participate in their game they can always try making events that don't suck complete ass. 
---
More people in space doing things is better. Stop being a lil bitch
---
Ugh, what year is this? 1980?
---
Yeah, would be cool - the Korean community is fairly active too. https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006941/ is a good example.
---
That requires a UI/UX team that's not complete garbage. Better luck next time I guess. 
---
hope ccp changes it, till then play or don't, your choice
---
Sure.
---
If your only interest is being showered in isk and that's your only metric for how good an activity is, then there's already plenty for you to do.
---
Yeah, this is kind of what I'm saying. Small group PvP should be possible in low end ships. Instead we have the elitists flying fits designed to dominate even numbers fights and flee any time they're seriously outnumbered. Same elitists proceed to complain about lack of content and how they're too good to join groups capable of holding a field (the dreaded F1 pushers), and apparently too lazy to organise sufficiently to spin up such a group themselves. Occasionally we get a smug video about how this one time they fought outnumbered in ships worth more than the entire opposing fleet. Then we're told it's Rorquals that ruined Eve. OK pal.
---
what?   
---
lemme refresh your memory   
---
&gt;its the one thing that brings me back from my eve hiatus, playing for a week, grinding events and getting some dumb skins out of it is what i like   
---
not ONCE have i stated that i dont like the new sites bc i dont get isk from em, its something i dont really care about in the event, i want skins and cerebrals, bc while i could have slaved away in havens and made billions of isk, i got some facepaint and hot ping nidhoggur that makes me feel accomplished instead  
---
i want trinkets for my dumb labour  
---
i dont like the new event sites bc its incredibly hard to get these trinkets bc it wants me to kill players in a mining barge or a angel faction ship, A: i dont have a Machariel and wont buy one bc of the event   B: i dont do very much PVP and would not wanna risk a 700m ship (poorfit mach) for 5 points 
---
just learn the damn skills
---
*loud sobbing*
---
People are playing the game how they want to, not how i want to, this is outrageous, it's unfair!

Don't forget the info panel popping up in your face when you jump to a signature.
---
yeah i get its an exploit but if its been there for 8 years and they havent changed it, its entirely CCPs fault.

Hey I am getting into solo pvp with Breacher, and I made a fit roughly using the [frigate pvp report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SV_sWWIinoheBaGZgL2nUVJGYwnsNJqJ/view) that I found on this sub.
---
My capacitor gets emptied REALLY fast. Like I get out of capacitor in every fight I did, in a few seconds, except of course when I get one shot.
---
I wonder if it is because my energy skills are not all level V, or because I activate too much modules at the same time...
---
I usually fire everything but the AB, except if I need it to get in range or out of range. And I only use the armor repair if needed.

You get that regardless, that stuff is given to you from the points you acquire, which bypass all the rng loot nonsense anyway.
---
you'll soon have no one to fight
---
If people want to mine then mine. However I do think excavator drones were a mistake.
---
The issue with them is if they (or panic mods) are taken out of game or hugely nerfed now, the people who are ahead will stay far ahead. This could just be accepted as collateral damage (instead of wormholers for once) as a trade off against the extra content that would be generated as mining fleets become more vulnerable but I can't see that happening for a variety of reasons. 
---
The issue as I see it isn't the mining itself, but how untouchable the mining fleets are because of panic, and how profitable they are because of excavators
---
oh dont cry little one, you will be fine
---
Were you a minor at the time?
---
Getting a head start on elite and star citizen
---
fuck off, bitch
---
now we are talking
---
What a good joke.
---
because goons, nc, pl, gotg, tri, frt, test, skill u bashing a small corp assets for whatever reason with 100 titan (because it happen on a daily basis, we all know small corp own space or do offensive structure deployment) should have damage cap so the big alliance do not one shot it and have to stay 30+ min on grid, bashing it and no one will ever contest it ? Dude, even if the damage cap was 1000 and it would take 10+ hour to kill it, the small corp will never form up a fleet big enough to contest it, are you retarded ? Btw, if you think damage cap are here to give defender the opportunity to defend their assets and have time to form up, ever heard of armor/hull timer ? one is 24 hour after the shield get bash and second is 1 fucking week.
---
On a side note, yes Ttitan DD on structure is bullshit, I don't remember during which battle it happen, all I remember is it was The Imperium vs The North, fight was on a keepstar and The Imperium had a hard time to keep the keepstar timer on, but what helped us was The North titan lance damage kept the timer on, it was friendly fire but helped us a lot, DD should not have any effect on keepstar I think to avoid this, and the bullshit your brain came up with 
---
But Querns, you should be a content farm for every 10 man frigate gang in EVE and like it.
---
How people don't understand that deliberately driving fleets out of space is the MO of every Alliance that looks after the farms and fields is beyond me.
---
For sure, this morning we saw NC and ph kill their own citadel, fucking hilarious.
---
Which one?
---
Then you can congratulate them on making less than 100m ISK/hr, they'd have been better off tripleboxing AFK VNI's for that time.
---
Dude's a pedo.
---
"Play on our terms or don't play at all."
---
"Wahhhhhhhh"
---
What kinds of ships does it usually take to perform in a wormhole?
---
your idea and your specific objective are just shit, you are retarded, you looks like one of those people who play 1 hour per week and can only afford a frigate and come to reddit to complain "muh CCP people are playing way more than I it's unfair, I want the game to be build around me",  like I said, there is someting call "fozzie sov" and "damage cap" who clearly show why we should not listen people like you, you almost doesn't play this game and come up with idea that kill this game good job.
---
&gt; People want clear objectives. Thus the new war mechanics. Deal with it.
---
Fix your own objective, what do you want to change ? Small fleet roam and blob warfare ?
---
Final point, you seem dumb, so I just want to live that here : 
---
[A small fleet](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75542077/), [when play properly](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75520639/), [can do a lot of damage already](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75542077/) so step us and stop crying to make the game build around you or for you, Darwinism say adapt or die 
---
I fail to see how that's necessarily too little. You can have much more than that, farmed in 1-2 encounters with large fleets, or you can get 1-2 encounters per evening with smaller groups.
---
IIRC CCP didn't have the resources to maintain those localisations.
---
Like we used to have with siphon units and when ppl used  to  shoot pocos for a fight 
---
caps are what shitposters and pubbie on reddit hate, if subcap, small fleet etc was something people want, you would not see them going into major coalition.
---
They say they don't care. But they do.
---
keep showing us you know nothing about warfare, it's funny 
---
I'm German so I hope I got it right :D
---
Capitals are [fine](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74468272/)
---
They are 3 entities. one per squad.
---
Now there'll be Korean localization, making it easier for Korean gamers to get into EVE.
---
Most Australian answer ever 
---
:cripes: i looked up the LAW your age was right for this exact circumstance as disgusting as it is.
---
More people 99% safe in space is not better for the health of the game.
---
muh nano gang cant kill soupars
---
I'd be fine if rorquales mined less than exhumers and provided boosts for barges on grid. 
---
Better yet, ask if your corp / alliance if you have a WH acess, might be better to stack a few alts there. :)
---
You don't want capsuleers to come back because you're afraid they'd kill your ships.
---
It's an ambivalent argument. Goons didn't first have capital umbrella because they were afraid to field trillions of isk, then they got it because they're afraid to loose trillions of fielded isk, now they're damage controlling their umbrella on reddit because they're afraid to lose in an argument. They have their propaganda machine at full throttle because they're afraid that their empire might fall apart without it, and they're fighting wars because they're afraid to look like passive crabs.
---
Therefore, everything goons do is because of fear. 
---
I highli doubt that it's true, so I conclude we have a contradiction here, so the fear arguemnt itself is an attempt to manipulation. You can always reduce anything to a fear, so it's not a valid option in our warm friendly discussion.
---
And even if a rorq is dying, you can just stash the excavators in a depot.
---
but MONOCHROME UI
---
Nah bro, we are winning every day by having fun doing what we do. :D
---
Sad thing, i know, that not everyone shares your playstyle. 
---
Yeah, tell me about it. I am manufacturing T2 ammo and I can't fucking move it to my cargohold without this huge popup offering me to train Large Blaster Specialization. Annoying as fuck. Have my upvote.
---
I got downvoted to hell for saying that, like, people were like "u say that because you are racist and shit", I played Black Desert Online and TERA, Koreans are heavy bot users too.
---
Ccp said sick it up and deal with it, it happens when you're incompetant and chasing the injector cash. 
---
Remember the time a 40 year old from the [Conservative Christian Party was in a love relationship with a 16 year old](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/schleswig-holstein-cdu-chef-tritt-nach-affaere-mit-minderjaehriger-zurueck-a-780193.html) and only stopped it because it's a tiny bit weird, not because it's against the law? :D Ach\_deutschland.jpeg
---
dumb
---
COSMOS site, they use droneboat and set aggresive drone for "legal" botting
---
"not run the Alliance Tournament in 2019 to focus on stuff but it will be back" is i believe what they said? Same with Fanfest at Harpa. 
---
If only all you smart  longposters would do shit ingame instead of repeating the same shit for 100th time on reddit
---
And you believe them. Cute.
---
just adapt lol
---
win means quit my bro. And its strange, because they did 10 years ago. Funniest part is that if the original goons could see how you guys play now they wouldn't have taken two steps further up that beach to VFK.
---
Software geeks.
---
Full Windows license for 30 quid
---
Apart from the simple fact that not all players can use playerbased gates.
---
Normal gates you can jump while tackled, yes. But then so could the fleet trying to kill you if they held back 1 ship from agroing. You know, like tactics.
---
We need something new and expendable around which to fight over.
---
We also need mechanics that give some room to new forces to get in the scene, in https://imperium.news/the-abyss-a-place-to-lose-yourself/ I proposed a space where the biggest players could go to to win some kind of new materials, ships, or whatever for a period. And in, https://forums.eveonline.com/t/design-workshop-diplomatic-resorts/86985/7 I proposed buffs that would give rewards but also sometimes nerf your group (you annoyed a The Scope representative and now you are being slandered for violent behavior, giving you a penalty to firing rate).
---
Those windows would give avenues for new groups to try their luck in and make a place for themselves.
---
So yeah, at the top you would have new toys that can upset the balance, can be aspired to, **but are expandable and expireable unlike caps**, and at the bottom you would have ways to give new forces the window of opportunity to get in and start something.
---
Just delete enormous and colossal anoms and make the rorqs have to spread out in system and reposition more often in each anom.
---
Cva has a Korean Corp as well 
---

---
Anyways if it's more players I'm all for it
---
The Gallente COSMOS missions &amp; sites were added in the Red Moon Rising expansion in December 2005 (which also added some other minor features like jump clones and capital ships).
---
Too big for wormholes, too small for null feels bad man
---
Damage caps stop someone like goons from just rolling around 5 titans and killing every structure within jump range in a week. They don't do it because it's a pain in the arse, which is good. 
---
Structures SHOULD be a pain to kill; structures should only be killed if they need to be, or are worth the grind.
---
Like before null got asset safety and infinite anomalies?
---
But I'm broke :/ 
---

You do not like it, i get it, but that does not mean its bad for everyone.

---
This could be done with the Abyss.
---
No need for another server.
---
I mean, wasn't EVE going through exactly that for years, at around the beginning of the decade?
---
To my knowledge, it's been reported by several people
---
You're asking why CCP are incompetent at something, you know why.
---
&gt;the ~~updates~~ ship SKINs will continue until morale improves
---
there are a few remaining corps or alliances that depending on who you are (as long as your not a sworn enemy) they dont hotdrop, and still continue to provide some sub cap pvp.
---
Ah fair enough i know that feel.
---
but i just checked and full windows 10 pro for £19.99
---
Exactly. Too safe, far too safe. If they made less isk the safety aspect wouldn't be as bad, but they are basically printing machines
---
why does defnding need to be easy, we are eve, we are playing the most ruthless game i know of in terms of player loss. why does it need to be fair to hold space, or cheap? or easy to defend. make defending REALLY hard, but possable for all to at least attend (timer wise)
---
What a wild fucking ride this place is sometimes. Other game subs I can’t even point out someone is an in game scammer, because even though it’s against the ToS, so is “naming users” :bigthink:
---
But this... truly a community like no other.
---
&gt; I play on a TV at 4K resolution
---
How do people do this. Even the absolute best TV's have obscenely worse picture quality than an average monitor these days. A good 24" monitor is the same price as a 50" TV for a reason.
---
Late to the game here but for me its the lack of content.  Getting 2 sides to agree to a fight is extremely rare these days.  Each FC knows what the other has and if someone thinks they might lose they decide to blueball instead.
---
In an era where everyone is richer than they have ever been we see far less fights.  
---
But are they really?
---
I got gate-camped coming back from nullsec. I successfully avoided the camp on the way out by bouncing, but then I landed on a bubble in the destination gate. I survived this by burning back towards the gate (a trick that has saved me twice now).
---
So I parked my Imicus in a safe spot (previously bookmarked) and cloaked. Sat there for a bit and watched the system fill up with even more pirates at all gates, so I decided to logoff. Hours later when I reconnected, I found that I had been killed and podded.
---
What did I do wrong? I don't remember any aggression timer, so I thought this was safe. I thought you were effectively "removed from the field" when logged off if there is no timer.
---

why post leaks for free on reddit when someone will happily pay for them? pm sent
---
Ummmm, NO.
---
Good troll. 
---
&gt;afaik old JB's allowed you to jump when tackled, any nobody complained
---
Being pointed, or even being within a bubble, would prevent you from using an old JB. 
---
If you weren't capable of warping, you weren't capable of jumping either.
---
I like your response... I think you are correct for the most part.
---
Creating content that is meaningful, fun and has depth in an MMO is beyond my mental capacity in terms of difficulty to create. There is no disputing this.
---
However, the content that eve does have is beyond stagnant... I think this is something most people would agree with. Since PVE is ultimately something that *most* people will have to do for their income, it’s wise to have a system that is engaging. I’m not saying that is an easy task to accomplish and I’m not saying I have the answers on what needs to be done, but, the system as it is right now is boring and encourages botting because of that fact.
---
If there was some renovation, an attempt at refreshing the system that has largely remained the same since the beginning of the universe, it would indicate an acceptance that CCP know that it needs some work rather than just shrugging and not investing in it.
---
Other MMOs largely manage to recycle it and keep it working with storylines and lore. There is no feeling of any attachment to the eve universe right now.
---
Short of a running a screen recorder, is there any way to record or capture a short period of game play for later post-mortem analysis? Often when I get killed it's a bright flash of light and sirens, and then instant death. It's hard to get better when you can't really understand what killed you.
---
I'm aware of the kill report, but it doesn't offer replay as far as I can tell. OK don't get mad for mentioning a console game, but something like the Halo feature where you can record an entire game would be really handy. It records the individual motions and actions as data, which you can then replay. You can move the camera anywhere in the game during the replay which is really nice.
---
Increase costs? yeh so now the ONLY way to play is to have a rorqual, i think i know how ccp will rebalance, 100% they will increase production costs, making none rorqual miners skint, and making rorqual miners MORE isk as mineral value goes up. remove excavators completely. adjust ratting in nullsec to better fight against botting, injectors? theyre not an issue any more, everyone can fly caps of all sizes now, and with excavators removed. they dont matter anymore.
---
Live in my little wormhole with my friends. Build stuff in said wormhole. Sometime we go poke the baddies in nullsec, or take down a citadel in wormhole space because MUH ASSET SAFETY
---
If you're gonna be a shit-for-brains while emitting a pathetic ejaculation of a post, I'm gonna slam you for also having the conversational skills of roadkill. You invite it by having no substance.
---
Siege Green is a largely Korean lowsec alliance.
---
it would take 12 minutes to make that one go away btw. :P
---
You used to be able to add clones to the capital module of a clone vat bay of a titan or rorqual and then if that pilot was online and the module was active normally in a pos in those days you can install the clone and then jump to it, so one titan could go to a target system and have like 10 clones installed and then people could be lazy and not fly there the titan would have prestaged a pos and can jump to it with some ships in its maitenance array and people could pod to it (not on death) and grab a ship out the array
---
For someone who claims to want a "rational, intelligent discussion," you sure can't get through a post without complaining for at least half of it. You are aware that the quoted phrase doesn't mean "agrees completely with me and maintains the fragile echo chamber," right?
---
Did you safe log or just logged off ?
---
Lowlife rorqual miner xddd
---
You couch the whole "capital umbrella" thing like it's something we're reluctant to do; that it's a desperation tactic used only because it's necessary. Have you ever operated a capital umbrella? It's fucking *fun* to radically overwhelm every idiot that waddles into our space. Pretty much everyone who says otherwise is likely harboring brackish, guarded feelings about not having the opportunity to do so.
---
To understand how fun it is, you may need to metaphysically pry your mind off of the meme where everything in Eve is about gudfites. It seems to be a legitimate psychological blind spot; some posters have been so powerless for so long that they've rationalized their powerlessness and enshrined it. For those of us who have actually succeeded, though, it's quite different.
---
We'll try!
---
It'll be great I'm sure
---
they should just add a key to toggle it on , like hold shift mouse over get the pop up, no shift, no pop up
---
I can understand Marshy caring. But I don't why anyone else would. 
---
o7 RIP he was realy a good dude, will miss him :(
---
My condolences to everyone that knew Ben better than I. In my time spent playing this game nothing ever really prepares you for something like this. 
---
I hope his friends and family can find comfort over what's going to be a very difficult few days.
---
I'm so very sorry for your loss.
---
o7
---
surely. english isnt a mandatory subject in korea
---
:( &lt;3 o7
---
you'd probably have to make one for best korea if ccp got brain damage and decided to market to them
---
The strategy is used to push "frail" players out of a particular market... Happens often with medium volume items
---
Oh TIL
---
Rest In Peace. I didn't know him very well but from what I know he was a good guy. He will be missed o7
---
i'd like to see a limit of 1 structure currently \*anchoring\* in a system, so you'd have to contest that when you want to deploy something in hostile space - like, you need to prepare several ships with anchorable structures beforehand, have a fleet ready, and possibly click faster than the other guy when there's a window to start anchoring (and if you were too slow, that's where your fleet comes into play
---
&gt; The game really needs a way for corps and alliances to grow and fight entities of their own size along the way.
---
I second that.
---
 Rest in Peace Ben o7
---
&gt; Other than frostline, you have been able to easily get to 1000 points in every event by doing nothing but shooting npcs.
---
Nope, this event also wanted you to mine and do pvp, also it wanted you to buy those boxes, so no, you could not complete it w/ pure pve (I tried) 
---
w-when we said it in 2011 it was okay
---
"Affecting only mining ships arount it" 
---
No the mining ship can just warpout when they see a neutral in local, or be remoted by the rorqual. Rorq only should be affected. Don't make belt more safe pls
---
Never crossed paths with the dude, but may he fly safe, wherever his course has taken him. o7
---
Olmeca is 'gay' for Mar5hy?          
---
Et pense à payer te licence Windows, espèce de petit canaillou !! 
---
That's one of the things CCP should worry about the most.
---
Oh so there is in fact a win screen om eve than. Well shucks why didnt anyone say so?!
---
You see if there was. Than this would still be p2w. Higher skills purchased for cash. To promote a faster more accessible LATE TO END GAME for new players. In turn for cash ofc. So uhhh... p2w. What you do after doesnt quite matter. That's like bringing multiple equations into 2+2 to figure out what 1+1 means...
---
Eve is dynamic. There are no win screens. Winning eve is subjective. A running joke is that winning eve is no longer playing so uhhh yeah.
---
Guys, I'm really upset about people mining.
---
It's not going to work.
---
07 Ben. 
---
I am absolutely devastated and heartbroken... I spoke to him not too long ago and never in a million years would I have thought it would be the last conversation we would have. Ben will be sorely missed... o7
---
O7
---
Okay, I'm all for naming and shaming when it comes to botting, broadcast inputting, RMT and all that juicy shit but this is way above and beyond that. This kind of stuff is where the mere accusation can and will cause massive real life damage to people's lives and people will start doxxing and doing all kinds of shit. 
---
Worse, it might actually hold water and then it *definitely* should be out of the hands of turbonerds on reddit or in-game. 
---
Got any information on this, contact actual authorities and let them handle it. If not, let's try and stay clear because there is absolutely nothing anyone that is *not* legal authorities can do that won't be anything but disturbing, damaging or just generally wasting time for the victim whether it's children or a smear on this guy. 
---
I'm basically asking the mods to purge these kinds of posts, "brother bring the flamer. The HEAVY flamer" style, but at the same time perhaps facilitate the collection of useful and actionable information *privately* which can be given to actual authorities. 
---
Someone I know recently combined Maple  Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel  popcorn. It didn’t and they don’t recommend anyone else do it either. 
---
o7 
---
So sorry. Wish I had known you more. I definitely knew you were a solid player, we’re down a good boy. Thank you for spending your time with us.
---
Frat used to get alot of stick on the forums/reddit.
---
As a neighbour (legacy) i've always found them to be fun. They often roam into our space to pick fights, they always form fleets to keep us out of their capital systems too.
---
&gt; But why can't we have a little piece of the galaxy carved out for actual fights? Why can't we have FW focused on fair duels with no chance of getting ganked 30vs1? Where fights are fought as advertised without the inevitable 30 men gang waiting around the corner.
---
I'm advocating for exactly that:
---
http://thedantelionplan.blogspot.com/2018/09/the-dantelion-plan-incentivizing.html
---
The Ship Amount Control part should interest you.
---
start pilot. inject one toon into rorqual 15bill? (not alot of plex for that when rorquals started off never mind today)
---
use rorqual to make so much isk, you can inject 2nd toon, and plex accounts.
---
2 rorquals now making 3rd account in half the time. still plexing account with rorqual money.
---
4 rorquals,
---
5
---
6
---
oh, now i can inject into titan, and have the minerals to build 2 already.
---
not subbing anymore, also. all my rorq alts are max trained. now extracting excess skill points to sell for EVEN MORE ISK.
---
20 accounts, 20 rorquals. all paid for with ingame plex, all paying for it with skill extraction from toons i only want to mine with, and making capitals like theyre frigates.
---
hmmm, this is alot of work, i think i should bot. i know, ill join some mega alliance and bot.
---
game economy is broken, plex prices are so high you must be in a rorqual to make enough.
---
capitals so cheap pvp got boring. cos everyone use capitals. because damn theyre so cheap! basicly free if rorqual mining as moon goo is all i care for now.
---
(i dont rorqual mine anymore, but this here, is what i think has happened. eve is dead? no eve isnt dead, the bots and rorqual dudes just havent noticed everyones left.
---

you CAN edit the tooltip delay in the settings  
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Just logoff. Maybe I have a misapprehension about what that does. Whenever I reconnect from logoff, my ship "warps in" to wherever I was previously. So I thought it was removing me from the field.
---
he has already been banned for input broadcasting. "it was a mistake" is not a feasible excuse, and the GMs evidently agreed.
---
As 1 of the 4 objectives. Do one of the other 3 
---
I did 1000 points on multiple chars by just killing rats. As I have done every event, except frostline 
---
Oppa cool
---
okay champ
---
which imo means that for fights, you need buffer areas where you don't have to escalate that hard - maybe something like npc null regions (or at least a few systems) between each sovnull region, which gets perhaps also some static "capitals get penalties" effects because the npc's teched the tech? or, i'd be fine with lowsec as well, if it weren't for the sec status loss. i don't want to be forced to rat/mission run to repair that, no matter how much/little effect it has on things. it feels like a punishment for content.
---
o7 Etienne, my condolences to his family IRL, and to his friends in Snuff and FETID. You will be missed.
---
It seems there have been sufficient evidence that this dude has engaged in pedophilia in one way or another. You only have to look at some of the other comments which have screenshots of him saying he is or the soundcloud capture of him saying he engaged with a minor about sexual stuff. Imo, this isnt more of a witch hunt but more of calling this dude out as what he is, a sexual predator. 
---
inject skill book, you noob
---
This. PST is the worst. By the time I'm off work and able to hop on, most EST players are logged off. :(
---
I've roamed hours looking for fights until saying fuck it and taking fights heavily not in my favor just to at least log knowing I fought something.
---
I remember him from dhsj, did talk much to him but he seemed a chill dude.

who is pohds?

it's just misleading title. Shitty ccp

also see my other argument that i brought up: SPAWN RATE, i live in angel space, and in 2 weeks i managed to run ~10 sites total, i checked every day, and my entire sov region for sites but they just DIDNT spawn

Which *still* very much needs to be taken to the actual authorities and not a pack of turbonerds on reddit. None of us can do *anything* useful in this situation and a lot of us can get in the way of things instead. 
---
Purge these threads with fire, have authorities do what they can. It's the only reasonable way forwards. 
---
Rest in peace 07

I'm pretty sure CCP is aware of how stale PvE content is. But hasn't their stance always been "EVE is a sandbox, thus you have to find your content yourself"? So from their perspective, while content is stale, maybe they don't see the need to change stuff because everyone is just talking about how PvE is for losers and elite players need more PvP content etc, plus "sandbox" so if it's boring it's on you.
---
I'd love to have better PvE because sometimes I just want to enjoy a game without having to deal with other players. Since EVE doesn't offer this, I tend to play other games instead, which overall is reducing my playtime in EVE, thus reducing other player's chances to encounter me ("content") - but people have been asking for better PvE and not much has been done.
---
CCP has all the feedback they need, they have a huge amount of other games providing really good/bad examples how (not) to do things, they have tons of data how the playerbase is interacting with the game etc.
---
If all they can do is a re-wrap (abyssal) they either don't care enough or fail to analyze all that data properly and make the right decisions.
---
Either way, I won't hold my breath since I don't believe CCP will make the right choices, especially now with Pearl Abyss on board. 
---
Here is the main problem imho: people how don't really play games and don't know what makes a good game are in charge and make big decisions because in the end, games is just another product and their marketing strategies are being applied to maximize profits.
---
And when it's all about the money, you won't find much dedication, neither for the game, nor for the community.
---
The solution is to use Syndicate as playground for all smaller entities that appreciate a good fight where skills actually matters. 
---
Syndicate is an npc region which means noone can claim it, and if the big boys comes around you can just dock up and reject them any fun until they understand is pointless to waste time getting their supers/titans within jump range.
---
In time it will attract more likeminded players and more fun for every involved.
---
a great friend and corp mate, you will be mist buddy.  o7
---
But what about stargates? The whole concept of the new jump bridges was really the old "player built stargates" thing.
---
Just curious, what’s wrong with them lol
---
God bless, good luck on your upgrade IRL, EVE should be a complement to your life, an enhancer, not something that takes it over.
---
As with the botting, grinding, and injectors, if they have any sense, CCP will find a way around them. The game will be in a better shape when you come back.
---
was thinking a bit about that myself recently, and figured you might need to force ppl to their happiness by limiting alliances to holding sov in a single region, and limit each region to be able to support only a limited amount of ppl/alts; for example, the enormous belt respawn mechanic could be replaced with a single belt containing all the ore minable for the 24h period, and you get to set the time when it spawns on your ihub; that'd allow ccp to define easily how much ore there's available in a region (and might make those anomalies occasionally popping up interesting again), thus forcing the huge alliances to spread out more, have more space to defend - which, if you have to spread out to 5 regions to support your numbers, and each alliance only be able to have a single region, means you need to split up the alliance; even with it initially being all under the same person, you start creating fracture lines, where ppl might rebel against always having to defend the space of ppl 3 regions over while they could just happily mine their way into oblivion where they are.
---

---
just nerf the WETU a little bit, make it JUST enough to hold 4 drones, that will have enough of an impact 
---
The pop-up tool tips in the skill browser are the worst.
---
Just a mention to a previous Olmeca comment where he said that if u want to nerf rorqs, u shouldn't start from their weakness. Now the excav is the only part that can be addressed by hunters under strong super cap umbrella
---
or, yes have your industrial base where you're nigh-unassailable; however, occasionally undock some fun solo thing that \*can't\* kite away from everything. maybe dust off your drake, roam out solo, looking for another t1 bc to fight (or maybe a few t1 cruisers). yeah, at least initially you'll find kiting stuff or titan blobs, but that's on them; you risk nothing of value, but your time, and seeing what you can get done with something not ideal for the job (and actually managing to get something done with it) can be fun. and who knows, maybe ppl will notice you coming in with fightable stuff, and actually come with something appropriate as well, or do the same and you meet somewhere and dunk it out. ~~that's when you'll light off the cyno and drop your titans on them!~~
---
I know for a lot of people doing this it's because they don't have a desk to sit at or anywhere to put a monitor / traditional PC setup so have to make do playing games like they own a console.

yay?

Increase the exacavator yield, but remove panic. 
---
Related, everytime you move your mouse over something selectable you hear that little "click", like, why?  Show me any other game that does something as annoying as this?  
---
Then the only way to disable it is to turn off an entire set of sounds bc no more advanced audio settings...  ugh.
---
Would be neat if poco taxes accumulated over the week before paying out, and you could siphon from them if you caught them before they did so.
---
Or something like that, anyway.
---
No where in my comment mentioned that this douchebag shouldn't get reported to authorities. In fact I saw one of the first posts about this douche and Jibrish told the OP of the post t ok report it to authorities or give him the info and he will give it to them.
---
I could sort of get behind this depending on the yield increase.
---
Tooltips: On [Off]
---
This would be ok but then problem is you ref the depot, fight the rorq, rorq panics, you get dropped by 3 titans and 3 supers plus subcaps. Panic is the biggest thing that should change imo. The most expensive part of a rorq fitting is the drones anyway, but being able to kill the ship would be a start
---
Underrated comment lol.
---
so eve ends its run as an asia grinder. pretty fitting regarding the state of the game. sad tbh.
---
Tbf, wasn't that first thread over a week ago, deleted inside an hour, and posted fairly deep in ustz? Or did i miss it being reposted?
---
its the mate isnt it
---
Maybe those are chinese bots. There are very rare korean bot actually. 
---
The reason is not like koreans have better mentality, there is other simple reason.
---
Koreans needs to use their social service number(SSN) for making game account, It’s 1 number per 1 person. You’ll be punished by law If you’re not using your own SSN.
---
So If you’re get banned by cheating, maybe you’ll never play that game again or you must use other guy’s SSN, which is risky.
---
For koreans, generally, It’s not worth to bot or cheat on game which requires SSN to make account and restricts botting and cheating.
---
Chinese bots/hackers in korean game are issue here cuz they get SSN to make account by hacking or use leaked numbers.
---
every time you press dscan you hear
---
BOOOOOOOOOOMMMSHHHHHHHHHH
---
well, EVE is owned by a Korean video game company now so its not exactly shocking
---
yes, and it doesn't reset until your mouse leaves the inventory window, which means after like 3 seconds you get the same issue and this also effects ALL tooltips in the game, like hovering over your wallet, fucking other things
---
True true but I think if the kill mechanics were changed it could make it more engaging to attempt to establish a beach head
---
But we did that already. 
---
no ;)q
---
Carriers were originally designed to use drones. Assault frigates did not have assault damage controls. The list of what once was and is now different is quite long. CCP redesigned and re-envisioned the rorqual. Of all the arguments someone might use for change... falling back on "well, in the beginning..." is the thinnest one.
---
agreed

It is a sign of bad times ahead of you when you start taking this sub seriously.

I don't think Titans should be able to hit anything with a Sid radius of less than 300 m Signature Radius period. It has AOE weapons for that. It should require a supporting fleet. 
---
Small gang, soloing and backpacking through whs in my t3 to find shit to get into. Occasionally just exploring the landscapes around me and the people that live there.

Once i skilled into a t3 eve changed for me. Youre open to way more stuff and the game becomes very much more accessable. 
---
Ive found wormholing fun if you catch it on a good day, otherwise youll be in an ocean looking for fish to feed on.
---
i mean you can clearly see the shift, the pcu is the lowest it's been and alts/bots are at the highest, and instead of people complaining about 'eve is dying' people are saying 'eve is dead'
---
also plex is skyrocketing because a huge chunk of people are in maintenance/afk mode
---
this sub is full of turboshitters like yourself (and me) so it's all trash posting.
---
EVE is dead is a meme.
---
The game is far from dead, but there are severe underlying issues the game does have.
---
The problem with player suggestions in a player driven content sandbox like EVE Online is that most of the views are coloured through a lens of opinion which dictates your specific agenda and what you want to see from your play style.
---
So, when players make suggestions on how to 'fix' the game, it's often a suggestion to simply make the game more compliant with their play style, rather than improving the health of the game as a whole.
---
The fact is most of the nuanced changes require access to significant metrics and data that the player base does not have access to. So most of the bleating and 'CCPuhleaseee" threads are mostly just venting, or on very rare occasion just cries to catch some devs attention to look at the problem in more detail.
---
The underlying problem in EVE is lack of clear communication between CCP and the playerbase at times, which can result in confusion where while something may be a strong agenda point for the player base, it may not be seen as an immediate concern by CCP. This is something they are actively working on from my impression of events.
---
Balancing EVE is very different to balancing a typical MMO game. Take WoW for example; balancing a class is mostly a case of ensuring it meets a damage baseline compliant with other classes, or where multiple specs are available to a class and they accel in one spec, then it is considered acceptable to let them lack in others, with low priority, periodic updates to try to bring them back into a median position. If players are unhappy or feel uncompetitive, most just roll a new alt, level it up largely painlessly, and then begin the competitive journey again.
---
In EVE, one of the biggest complained about issues is Rorqual mining, but there are significant underlying concerns to balancing a capital mining ship; not just the impact it will have on industry (New Eden has grown comfortable in a lower base production price for a lot of major ships due to the abundance of minerals being available, for example), and importantly from CCPs perspective, a drastic change significant enough may cause a dip in the number of players prepared to pay a subscription for a rorqual mining pilot; this would be incredibly dangerous in a period where their earnings are being monitored against likely revenue warranties assured as part of CCP's acquisition. So change needs to be carefully thought out, and iterative.

well when was doing ninja belt ratting in syndicate   i noticed that evry next npc rats spawn was one rank higher than previous,they had higher bounties and after killing the  highest rank  i had two hauler and faction spawn at once...if you pop hauler escorts first haulers go away. pop one hauler and faction spawn leave the other hauler. follow him if he switch belts/ore anoms you might land with aanother  npc miner.
---
so far observed. there cannot be two separate  npc hauler spawns in one system i tried  cleaning sys with  like 20 belts  popped rats  at first 10 friend did the rest,we did keep it up but we only got one spawn of 2 haulers and later same day 4 haulers for our disposal. in one case we had to bring orca to scoop his guts
---
It just helps if you pretend he's not with us 
---
what abut 15 geckos :D old carrier was able to launch 7 geckos and 5 hobgoblins or `15 mining drones II
---
lvl4  mission running rorquals  WHEN?
---
total 7 were handed out i tink
---
You need to add a mic drop to that. I completely agree with everything you said here. Which is a shame.
---
For me, it would be the reboot of the game and removal of skill injectors.   
---
I believe the game is beyond saving, due to massive overproliferation of assets. You will never be able to remove all the titans and supers and rorquals and generally wealth from the current game and catching up using RL money and skill injectors is just dumb. Losses dont have a meaning anymore and that is the MAJOR problem of the current game. Its not fun, if you just "meh" after losing a ship or killing a ship and you can not starve a corporation or alliance finantially. Also there is only very small chance for new competitive groups to form due to large blocks absorbing majority of people looking to join a corp and older people just cycling between couple of those prime power blocks.   
---
If CCP introduced some "end of the world" scenario, possibly with some in-game lore and events, like MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 ending in a doomsday and the game basically being restarted as 2.0 with some changes, that would lure me back.  Opening space up for new groups to form. Changing the materials to being more easily depleted so overproliferation is limited, removing skill injectors. Also, less focus on microtransactions, more focus on gameplay and subscription based revenue / PLEX.   
---
As stupid as it sounds, the new mobile version of EVE they announced, that would not share the world is something that should happen to the main game as well. A new beginning.
---
I tend to agree, but I’ve had it explained to me over and over again that it’s a bad idea to make it too punishing for folks, especially those who may have extended absences through no fault of their own. I would prefer to tell folks to suck it up - one of the reasons I want to limit/remove asset safety in null. but I think I may be in the minority there. 
---
lootboxes should be achievable throught   NES  store. or should drop from  faction/officer spawns.  lootbox from officer spawn sould give fuckloads of  purple mods and faction one facton mods.
---
i think price of lootbox  in nes store could be 1000 plex for faction lootbox  if u dont want grind rats and same as above for officer lootbox but price there 5000 plex. 
---
no deadspace lootbox
---
I don’t mind people mining. I have myself. I do object to the insane game breaking amount excavators harvest. 
---
Are you really such a blinding moron that you don't understand how the only ones who can do anything helpful at this point are the authorities, and that torchflinging turbonerds can do literally nothing but damage to *the case and the victims themselves*? 
---
Taken the ratio of your last drops you would need at least 70-80 Supers and some 10 Titans to drop on these 530 catalysts. I think CCP should listen to you ...
---
I like the damage capstuff, but you’re never goi g to get skill injectors limited, and no way do they bring back any kind of AOE stuff. 
---
destroy the game because someone might not be able to log in, eve just isnt what it used to be.
---
how about reward daily play? reward consistency? reward aggressive play? make owning the places all the problems like rorqs capitals, and botting actually a difficult job, requiring actual gameplay to hold it not isk alone
---
Simple, that requires devs (and someone to interact with the community), unfortunately ccp only hires/has kept art folks.
---
Could we interest you in some new skins?
---
Well, the reason why we don´t have a Fanfest this year is because the Harpa is getting renovated (you already could see the big construction site next to it. So it´s not available this year, so they decided to not hold anything in Iceland this year.
---
And regarding AT, I honestly don´t understand why they did cancel it. I´m sure EveNT would have loved to host the complete event. They were doing a good job last year, some may even say they did a better job than CCP themselves

It changes everything, since you’ve flat out accused me of being unwilling to rep ideas I don’t agree with. I have presented tons of stuff I didn’t agree with - so have the others. 
---
I know this is unlikely to ever happen, but the reality is that much of the stuff you just assume is happening isn’t. 
---
Before you start building planets, make a plan. Find out what you want to produce, what resources you need for that, what setup you can build with your available cpu/pg, and what hauling you need to do to keep it running. 
---
Well for example, a friend game me their spare TV when they got a new one. Doesn't mean I can still up and afford a new monitor right now. On top of that, I really don't have much space, as literally all my space is a small square coffee table, and a TV-dinner sized desk for my computer.

I mean, it's not like Eve is the pinnacle of graphical fidelity, so any average TV would be fine for playing Eve anyway.

So stop with the bullshit. Nobody had ever done it before, so while it was possible, it was highly improbable, and that’s why nobody prepared for it. Hell, the leaked comms made it clear these guys didn’t believe we were capable of staying all week 24/7 with sufficient numbers.

What’s sad is that months later, you guys are still hanging off my nuts, constantly name calling and pretending what happened wasn’t a big deal. 
---

You are preaching to the choir here. I’m simply telling you what I hear when I suggest similar things. 
---

To be fair, it's much harder to get a marauders in place and an inhib. You can see them coming from forever away and they are slow. Plus they are nuetable even if you drones are gone. Makes a possible way out. Unlike a hic, they can seldom rep well and doctors are disposable but hard to get more of 20 jumps from home of 5 jumps and 3 whs.
---
The space argument I understand, but EVE has a lot of quite small text and that's where a TV really falls down.

I can second this from inside frat.
---
My Corp has recently moved to fraternity. and we are always impressed with constant fleets to either roam or defend our home territory.  It makes the game fun for a PvPer.
---
Even better it's only 13 jumps to horde space for a little fun roam or 5 - 15 jumps to legacy botters space for camping and general fucking with bots.
---
I hate to go against a narrative... but have you checked zkill lately? More isk in excavators and rorquals dies daily than any other ship class in the game. The only time it's close is a super/titan fight with heavy losses. It's not even close.
---
Do you run all these screens on the same monitor, Or is the video a composite of differing monitors ?
---
Im glad you're fighting the dirty goons, I hate seeing those stupid bots ruining this game
---
Never even got to play with drone carriers but they sound so much better than what we have now. The main concern I have is the potential to multibox ratting Carriers which is definitely worse for the economy than multiboxing ratting VNIs.
---
OP is missing the standard 4000 word essay about organzied gooncult harassment on /r/eve, and he probably didn't even message any mods about this thread either!  
---
Other than that good job &amp; well done! You're doing your fair bit in raising delve ore prices, them shits are way too low.
---
It's not until all your log off timers are done (yellow is PvE, red is PvP). Using log off safely removes your ship for sure.
---
I tile up to four screens per monitor, rather than cascade and overlap them, so I can see what's going on for each one at all times.
---
Well, yes and no. You could multibox carriers and basically afk them like VNIs however it caused people to spread out more since there were more people in anoms ratting. You could only really have 6-7 carriers in a -1.0 system and 5 in a -0.5 system. The ticks are also insanely different (~180m/hr now compared to 90m/hr) Causing people to spread out more is a good thing for hunters but bad for people that live in shit hole regions with aids jump ranges.
---
Fighters are also fucking retarded, being able to MWD and missile swarm on command makes them 100x stronger than some sentry boyos with 160km range
---
i flew with etienne picard and his merry men from the DHSJ era up until they joined SNUFF
---
he was a top bloke, had a great sense of humor and it doesn't seem like 2 minutes ago everyone was ripping the shit out of each other on ts
---
fuck, it's so surreal casually scrolling reddit at work and seeing "rip etienne picard"
---
What do you mean by a narrative?
---
Yes I've seen zkill, but what is the percentage of rorqs/excavators being killed compared to how many exist? I don't know of a way to quantify that and I'm not saying rorqs or drones are always invulnerable, but for the amount of isk they make (and the indirect results of that much ore flooding the market) they are too safe. Wetus for drones, invulnerabilty for the rorq itself. Compare it to the income and initial investment of a super for example. Supers aren't easy to kill obviously, but at no point are they invulnerable, the fighters cost nothing in comparison to excavs and the ship and fitting costs much more than a rorq
---
He's flairbaiting
---
Nay. 
---
Good job dude. How annoying is it to see Mining Drone II instantly appear on dscan the moment you log in your scout? 
---
Goons need to elevate their play and start proactively reporting their guys botting rather than just passively/actively encouraging it.

Yeah cause the rewards are the only thing that's wrong with the events. /s

I mean, a big part of it is that now that everyone has capitals, damage caps actually work for big blobs not against them.  Initially it was meant so a 200 man subcap fleet can dps a structure as fast as a single dread, taking away their advantage.  What it now means is that little raitarus and athanors on the fringes of nullblob space take long enough to reinforce that the blob can ping jackdaws and go save it.  I like the ideas raised in OP but a big step would be allowing 5 dudes to ref a small structure in 1-2 siege cycles and get out.  They couldn't cripple an empire but they could force small response fleets and get content.  We used to do it with POSs all the time, and believe me dropping dreads underneath an umbrella to ninja rf a structure may be technically a bash but it gets the blood pumping!
---
BR's for excavators are so hot right never

Yeah, it woulda been really hard to find that out from the killboard.

Lol awesome.

RIP. Don't really remember speaking to him all that much but I'm pretty sure I commented on his forum app when he applied to Snuff lol.
---
Genuinely interested ... pm if it shouldn't be public knowledge
---
Well there are others on the kills he linked
---
Wewala for example also has a reddit account so i'm assuming he is a different person.
---
At least due to the video's i know that those i listed are handled by the same person

PEACE OUT MEXICOTATORS

Or you can get the hint that people are trying to drop by turbodunking you and fuck off and never come back.
---
They are already way more powerful than stargates.
---
\- Hunter can't follow you through
---
\- They are the size of regional gates making it harder to catch something that comes through
---
\- You can jump even if you are HIC pointed
---
\- You are in range of friendly citadel weapons
---
I think the monitor resolution matters, as it overlaps for me on 1080p, and barely fits with 1440p. I resize and position each window manually, without any additional software.
---
If you are trying to argue that small fleet dynamic PvP where every member's actions matter and the outcome is much more unknown (how many people will they bring as back up? In what ships? Will we be able to get out if we need to? Is our logi holding? Are we killing them?) is a gateway drug to anchoring on your FC and pressing F1 then you're either trolling or genuinely mentally handicapped, sorry dude.
---
How does that help you?
---
Harpa isn't being renovated - they're building a hotel and like 100 apartments beside it. The construction is nothing to do with Harpa itself.
---
The reasoning for us taking a year off doing Fanfest in 2019 is that we wanted to try something new and take EVE on the road. We want to see how many more people we can reach with more than just Fanfest and Vegas as official events. 
---
It doesn't hurt to try something new now and again :)
---
&gt;The underlying problem in EVE is lack of clear communication between CCP and the playerbase at times, which can result in confusion where while something may be a strong agenda point for the player base, it may not be seen as an immediate concern by CCP. 
---
Sounds like a Job for the Community Team... 
---
.
---
oh wait
---
This would also make eve's geography work for and against the pve'ers as well as the hunters.  Right now, with everyone krabbing in jump-capable ships with super umbrellas to save them and jump bridges galore, ratting in the end of a pipe only makes you safer.  Ideally, if you had to move around more, or at least compete some with other corps, it would become more of a calculation.
---
&gt;Well then it's up to the leadership of those little alliances to put aside their differences and deal with the intruders.
---
And thus a new coalition is born that will eventually and most likely through success form one of the big powerblocs they originally started against. This is less of "leaders taking the wrong paths" and more of what makes sense to succeed in the game. Banding together is the best way to become strong and so people (naturally) do it.  
---
I totally agree on the part, that people should start their own (smaller) groups if they find the big onces boring - but this is already happening. Look at Pure Blind for example. We do have a far more diverse nullsec then a couple of years ago...  
---
Also, big alliances don't only offer big TiDi fights. But most important they offer constant fighting, a variety of activities you can take part in and a well organised structure. So it's not as black and white as you paint it.  
---
Holy shit. RIP [Etienne](https://imgur.com/a/H5xej), you will be missed.
---
oh god i hate this bull shit. its just stupid little quality of life fuck ups that makes it that much easier for me to remain out of game. eve was way more fun back in 09-2011 era imo.
---
Again, incorrect. Bullshit statements like this with absolutely no evidence to back them up are completely toxic and add absolutely nothing to discussion of the future of the AT.
---
EVE_NT have been an incredible partner and to suggest we'd try to rip them off is pretty moronic and honestly somewhat offensive.
---
They're a fantastic group of guys and girls who command a shitload of respect at CCP for their community efforts.
---
I'm looking forward to hopefully working with them again on ATXVII.
---
Fly safe Etienne Picard. Fly safe.

The initial investment if you are boosting into a rorqual is 25-30b in injectors for good skills and 10b for the hull and drones and fit. They generate roughly 100m an hour currently unless moon mining. So, let's call it 100m for average sake. 350 hours to recoup that investment for a fresh rorqual character and rorqual. 100 hours for just a rorqual and drones. 25-30 hours for just a new hull and fit. I just did the numbers for March 1st to March 6th (right now). 44 dead rorquals at 191.98b. 6 Ice rones at 5.15b. 193 excavators at 164.23b. That is in 5 and half days. I am pointing out that the statement that they are invincible is untrue. They have a major weakness, the numbers show it. They lose drones left and right and despite the fact that people don't think they die.. 44 have died in 5.5 days. They are huge content drivers and the most vocal party are the 5-15 man nano gang groups that want to kill them but can't. As a reference point, the investment to get into a super is less in injectors and twice in hull and fit. Call it 30b to be fair. You can recoup that in about 133 hours of poor ratting at 70-75m a tick. (I average 120-180 with a hyper spatial and depending on dread spawn per tick which would make that 67 hours to recoup investment at 150m a tick average). You are right, a super isn't invulnerable. It is however... always aligned out and can warp or jump out at will and is not sieged for 5 minutes at a time unable to get off grid. Losing a fighter wing of t2 heavies is 500m. That's not nothing. If a super wants to cut and run and ditch fighters including t2 lights you are looking at 700m.
---
Not sure yet, but i like keeping lists so for me it's just a personal thing.
---
But i think there are more capable people who could use that info for other means if they intended to.
---
It's just that when i started in eve i was told not to trust others and never give info about the chars i own to random people and that is basically what he just did so it was for my own amusement as well to point that out.
---
This guide has gotten generally good reviews from people getting started in PI.

Only wormholers could get their shit royally kicked in and then act like they won for months afterwards.
---
While I do agree, there is a strong case that CCP has tried deliberately to foster a more conservative krabby mindset over the past years.  (For the record, I don't think this is an issue with CCP but with the gaming industry as a whole.)  In the end it comes down to mindset--we use capitals, local chat, cynos, scouts, bubbles, jump bridges, rorquals, and everything else to AVOID fights, when 10 years ago we used whatever we could to generate them. 
---
(Rose-tinted glasses aside... I can of course remember roaming for 5 hours back then and not finding anything too.) The weird thing is, it's a lot of the same people.
---
But you know what?  I'm in a corp of veteran players and if someone says "hey let's go roam" this little lightbulb goes off, like asking a group of 40 year olds if they want to go out for drinks.  Everybody's kind of like fuck, I remember that... and we go have a great time.  It's sort of sad that we have to fight uphill so hard just to play the game, but it's OPs like this that remind me--and I hope everyone else--that we still do have the tools.  We just gotta get up, rewire our mindsets, and fucking do it.
---
FCON still suffering in FW :D
---
Lol look at that, deleted.

The NC folks who bought this, you're retarded.

I imagine a factor in canceling Japanese localization is that it's simply not worth their time. People in Japan don't play PC games, for both cultural and market reasons, although that has been changing in the past couple of years. Even the Japanese League server has only 47K ranked players - compared to 1.6M Koreans and 574K in NA - and many of those are Chinese/Korean/etc. smurfs. You take a game as hard as EVE, try to create an NPE and marketing strategy that somehow is supposed to make a PC-averse gamer want to play EVE, and you end up with what, hundreds or thousands of man hours to get maybe 2,000 Japanese players? Korea is a much more logical decision given how integrated PC gaming is in their culture.
---
not adequate, as stated 3 times itt
---
it's actually retarded, who in the fuck thought a giant fucking gong sound you hear every single time you press a button you should be pressing over and over was a good idea
---
Hate to break this to you, but Frat is wwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay worse about botting.
---
The cyno is lit
---
Your country is too fat
---
Have you tried feeding it less burgers?
---
because they ruined the game probably? It was all fun and giggles at the beginning, but the long run view was horrible and we all knew that..
---
Astero and T2 Cov Ops frigate are the most used, some time statios (some fool use Nestor also)
---
T3c can be good with some refit
---
For the most camped places, a travel interceptor is surprisingly efficitient if you have very good skill in scanning and hacking.
---
Hopefully any new major Korean alliances don't align with anyone and instead change the meta and make the universe more threatening. That might be the only thing that'll save the game at this point.
---
Guristassites sounds painful, and contagious.
---
then stop collecting trash
---
Fair enough I agree with some of your points but I'd like to see some numbers (dunno if they're available though) of how many rorqs there are compared to ratting supers. I'd guess there are far more rorqs than ratting supers but if the numbers were the same then I'd agree more rorqs dying does prove something
---
Awesome reply! Thanks! I think i understand the basic of it no, and why it wouldnt work :)
---
They won't though, where would they live? South? Needs frat or legacy approval. North? Needs panfam approval. Drone lands? No, those are shit. 
---
Tbh the sov map isn't that bad today, not long ago nc/pl controlled 50% and cfc controlled 50% of the map, its the same today just with more pets
---
We also have frat that is growing fast
---
I really hope we see a mysterious Guard-man Friendship-dude appear in eve soon, leading fleets extolling the values and merits of the friendship as he roams. 
---
Jesus THIS ^.  If nothing else how about a delay?
---
Prob lowsec or maybe npc null
---
Maybe
---
Are mymidons viable for low level sleeper ratting? I’ve seen mentions of it, but they seldom show up on killboards... does that mean they have a ridiculously high success rate or that everybody else knows something that I don’t about why they shouldn’t be used? 
---
If they’re a bad idea, is there a battlecruiser that is viable?
---
You can even share filters now! 
---
Thanks to everyone who provided feedback on the tournament. 
---
Your concerns about the inability to adjust hotkeys and the default overview are valid and we can see how that can be detrimental to the tournament series. On one hand, we don’t want players to feel like they are unable to play at their full potential due to strict tournament rules. On the other hand, we do have time constraints that force us to sometimes make less than the ideal decision in order to ensure we can execute tournaments in the same style at all events.
---
When working on the rules we need to be extra careful and account for any delays or technical problems that can happen. If there is one thing I have learned from the live events is that even with a solid preparation that we have there will be things we could not have predicted. Having time to solve them without drastically impacting the overall flow of the event is critical and needs to be included in our planning.
---
After reviewing the tournament plans and time at our disposal, I believe we can mitigate the situation a little bit:
---
· First, we are going to add an additional 5 minutes at the beginning of each match/series for players to alter their hotkeys. Keep in mind that nobody will be allowed to plug in any device to the tournament equipment, so this must be done manually. 
---
· Second, we are going to preload all machines with one of the popular overviews that are used for PvP in EVE Online. We feel that this will be a good compromise to have that does not further increase the time allocation needed for each match.
---
Please keep the feedback coming and never hesitate to reach out to us with questions. EVEsterdam is only a few weeks away and I am looking forward to meeting everyone who swings by that weekend!  
---
In ur head rent free YAHOOOO
---
Maybe they will just throw out some other alliance! 
---
how much did he buy them from? maybe he bought them months ago when they were in mass and firesaleing, hence everyone stopped making them. now he returns with lots of rigs that no ones making yet, market empty, he wants fast sale.
---
with his price far below yours. people may see this who are unexperianced and think, oh i can buy those and re list for a small profit. they do this alot. and he sells fast, they relist, making your and his customer fight it out while he moves onto the next thing 
---
maybe stop posting :)
---
You’re arguing with the dumbest person in this game... look at his post history
---
I can't speak for every one in those groups, but having been a member and kept in touch with a fair amount of them I can contribute a bit here.
---
You're falling for the survivors bias. The reason you're not seeing them on reddit or speaking publicly against the direction is that they have already quit and are no longer customers for CCP.
---
As for the CSM, come on, let's be real. It's going away and should have years ago.
---
No major alliance will change their gameplay. It is literally one giant game of “no you first”
---
kinda hard not to in a sandbox with no sand that gets in your eyes and other toddlers to rub it in while you suck on momma mittens teet.   
---
enjoying the WH life with a good, active corp.  ISK by doing reactions, PI (to make fuel blocks for reactions), lots of pew pew, the odd C5 ratting, getting dunked and doing some dunking, learning new ways to enjoy this game.  Like fitting up artie, sebo'd thrashers to pop out of a Frig Hole into Delve to pop small shit from Goons, until a Rag shows up to DD...you know, stupid sh!t
---
Want to work in the worst industry ever? Work in translation, where prices are so cutthroat that companies are undercutting *their own offers* to get business, and I wish I was kidding.
---
Burned some triglavian books back when they first came out to this heretical design. Screw them!
---
Your guess is as good as mine.
---
I would be much more concerned if this sub, or even CCP themselves, start taking StainGuy seriously.
---
That's when we know the shit is hitting the fan at warp speed.
---
WTF are you talking about? My step son and his friends play PC games. There are huge PC stores (goodwill being one of them) where you can get the latest and greatest in PC parts. The Japanese community might not be attractive to eve nor games you like but they definitely are into gaming (Including PC games). From what I’ve seen they like handheld games and play the switch a lot. In arcades, mech style games along with music games seems to be the mainstream. As far as gaming in general goes in Japan.
---
Atari
---
Nintendo 
---
Sega

Playstation

Ill leave it at that.

Who

But it's my information and I want it now!
---
Wormholers have big gay lmao

They should look harder at delve in general. Especially those rorqual miners that all pull drones together.
---
How do i make the UI less see through on potato mode
---
I want to see this sheet in a years time :D
---
yeah i ate a titan skillbook on my market alt but CCP refunded it
---
but IT'S TOTALLY NOT AN ISSUE
---
Can I find ESS with in game statistics (like on the galactic map) or do I have to roam around ?
---
come back to our timezone. sajuuk. i miss your english accent.
---
&gt; also plex is skyrocketing because a huge chunk of people are in maintenance/afk mode
---
You're aware if more people are not playing PLEX price should lower since demand is lower ?
---
we live in pyongyang. so we are north! you too!
---
I think you have to roam around. Your best bet would be to seek places with a high number of NPC killed in the last hour.
---
&gt; Initially it was meant so a 200 man subcap fleet can dps a structure as fast as a single dread
---
lol wut? Let's say a dread does 10,000 DPS, and the average structure-bashing subcap does 500. That means only 20 subcaps would be needed to equal one dread, not 200.
---
I honestly don't know how to obtain a realistic number of total online rorquals. If I were to use anecdotal experience? Probably 2 rorquals in space for each super or titan ratting. Maybe 2.5? But that is guess work.
---
That's some next level displeasure over something.
---
Etienne was the first guy who joined me roaming on my first or second day in FETID.
---
He had a blast on that roam even tho we actually didn't kill anything and he got rekt by a well piloted muninn who baited us well in fighting him. 
---
Afterwards etienne said he didn't had that much fun in a long time and i'll never forget that. I was so thankful for him saying that because we got so outplayed, it made me feel welcome and i've had much respect ever since.
---
 i never thought i'll be waking up to a "RIP etienne" post on reddit and a bunch of pings and dms on Discord some day, but i am glad that his last message to me was a [[WW2 UK-German joke]]((https://imgur.com/a/babVMkJ)) which describes our relationship just perfectly.
---
Goodbye my friend, we miss you.
---
Passive shield regen drake, gnosis or Gila should probably work for C2. 
---
Pretty sure op was just shitposting. Like 96.32% of the comments on Reddit and had literally negative evidence for the statement. But it was an interesting perspective and if we don't have information during this dicey time in eve history we are going to make it up ourselves. If only there were some sort of .... interaction team , to you know keep the players informed... 
---
Cloud Ring
---
I was gonna suggest Fountain but went with Cloud Ring :)
---
It's the criminal history and prostitution.
---
When caps roles exclude 90% of other ships it's a problem. Caps need to have their roles narrowed down. They're used as a smashing tool against sub-caps thus making anything not a cap a complete worthless tool in warfare. 
---
People want small fleets. They want roams. They want clear objectives. What I'm proposing changes the existing system to give sub-caps half the duties of holding sov and disrupting enemy territory. But hey if your idea of enemy disruption is 10 cloaky snowflakes in enemy systems then you're why Eve sucks right now.
---
I'm tired of finally getting small fleets to roam into enemy space and everyone docks up waiting to form a bigger fleet to fight us. Give my fleet ways to hit their systems and the economy. Ways to cripple them and not just scare them for 10 minutes. 
---
Sure my ideas may have flaws, but they're all open for debate. Bottom line is this game needs clear objectives for sub-caps and caps to keep both useful and fun. 
---
Oh but hey... let's cloaky up more ships to hotdrop one VNI. You're idea of this game and how to place sucks it dry. Sorry mate. I may be getting hate, but the majority want small warfare back. That's a fact. 
---
- unfueled structures have neither tether or a timer as unfueled POS had no FF and no timer
---
- medium structures have only 48h max timer even if fueled, longer timers on the bigger structures 
---
- add an NPC constellation to the center of dronelands, and then remove Asset Safety (at max keep it on Keepstars), who wants his stuff "safe" put it on NPC stations as it was done for over a decade with the remark that this should be a "dark &amp; harsh place" 
---
Hello RenegadeVinny, if you need help, please write !help (Problem)
---
Woohooo thank you automoderator, time for me to get some EveKnowledge!!
---
☹️ MV guy 
---
Everybody in Delve know that already, we see Welwalla comming, we know the others are around. 
---
And you forgot Zelinda. Perhaps sdome other one too. :D
---
&gt;On a side note, yes Ttitan DD on structure is bullshit, I don't remember during which battle it happen, all I remember is it was The Imperium vs The North, fight was on a keepstar and The Imperium had a hard time to keep the keepstar timer on, but what helped us was The North titan lance damage kept the timer on, it was friendly fire but helped us a lot, DD should not have any effect on keepstar I think to avoid this, and the bullshit your brain came up with
---
This is why I added this, looks like you are pretty good to read someone's argument.
---
&gt; They don't do it because it's a pain in the arse, which is good.
---
Ask this to GOTG and Co2, during 6RCQ deployment we drop hundred of baltec, super, titan to bash entire constellation all damn sotiyo, azbel, fortizar was reinforce, could they do anything ? Does damage cap help them ? Yes ! It's such a wonderful thing instead of having their shit reinforce in 10 min it was in few hours niiiiiiiiice
---
&gt; Structures SHOULD be a pain to kill; structures should only be killed if they need to be, or are worth the grind.
---
That's where your knowledge about current warfare is close to 0, right now having sov doesn't matter, you can live in a asshouse, deploy ton of them and don't even care about Ihub, why an attacker would decide to invade someone if to control this space he will have to go trough structure damage cap and structure spam ? If we follow what you think this game should be, a war between 2 major coalition should be a war of motivation, the first one to burn out from structure droping/bashing lost while small entity (who btw, just saying, doesn't exist in sov nullsec, they have space dedicate to them, it's call WH), the game you want would make the current meta even worst and delve even safer, good job.
---
It depends.  You can do a lazy p0 to p2 on an single account with 3 characters and make 100-400 million a week with that 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5v6v8i/simple_p2_pi_setup_help/
---
the train up for that isn't really that long so your main would only lose out on like a month total of training.  Your total PI interaction per week can be as little as 5 minutes a week with this, but you'll make less an upwards of 30 minutes a week and you'll make more
---
You can go full sperg with 3 full accounts making your own p0-p4 chain and make like 10 billion a month.  But I don't have time for that
---
Brand new ship , the 6000 sux
---
Oh good. The old "rorquals can't be OP because they are dying" argument. If there are many rorquals around, more of them are going to die than if there were only a few.
---
And of course, idiot rorqual pilots are easier to kill than smart ones. Honestly, I don't see any reason why a smart rorqual pilot would die. They would be under a super umbrella, and they just pop a cyno at any sign of danger. If they are dumb enough to wait until there's a cyno jammer online, that's their fault.
---
I don't think anybody is saying that 5 dudes should be able to kill a rorqual, but how many is acceptable? 20? 50?
---
&gt; When was the last time you went roaming or deployed a fleet to go hunt a few exhumers?
---
Before the rorqual became so prolific. We hunted skiffs. Y'know, the exhumer with battleship-sized tank. We found procs more often, but that's because they're cheaper to replace, but still have a sizable tank.
---
And for those of you that are about to say "you just want easy kills". Maybe you just want to mine ore risk-free.
---
sounds like its the ones who dont speak america. so good ones?
---
&gt;You're aware [that] if more people are not [paying* for] PLEX price should [go] lower since demand is lower?
---
Your comment was nonsensical so I translated it as best as I could.
---
My assertion is that (based off of the sentiments I've read here, on the ingame forum, and from people I know that play) that PLEX demand is going up because:
---
1) Many people refuse to pay real money to play Eve in it's current state.
---
2) Many people are much more readily able to PLEX their accounts through massive alt farms.
---
The drop off of the population has an equal effect generally on the people who PLEX their accounts and who purchase PLEX to sell in game. If people who PLEX their accounts are dropping off more than people who purchase PLEX this is in general worse for the game, as the people who PLEX their accounts are much more solidified in the game and are the 'content generators' of the game.
---
We did keep people informed, that we're taking a hiatus.
---
Sadly, people on the internet behave like they have no brain or ability to absorb information.
---
Never heard of this guy, never crossed paths with him. Still, everytime I hear of pilots passing away, I feel like the game gets a little smaller. My condolences to his family and friends.
---
o7 fly safe, Etienne
---
Flair checks out.
---
&gt;If you alter the rorqual to the point that 5 or 10 small ships can kill it easily and quickly, you won't find them out there anymore.
---
Really, most nerfs to rorq survivability are gonna either buff their use under an umbrella at the expense of entities who don't have a reliable umbrella, or just make them useless, yes.
---
&gt;those alts will all shift to hulks + 1 rorqual that boosts and is not sieged. 
---
I mean, Dek was already shifting to something like this (mostly procs though) in prep for the Citadel cap changes that made afk carrier ratting possible.  Nuking rorqs to uselessness would just shift all of Delve to cheap turret mining.
---
Yea. Small fleets played properly? You mean picking off noobs at gates? Or station shooting? Yay! You got a few kills to pad your kb! But literally did nothing to your enemy. Zero impact. Objectives.. bro. You sure showed those 3 wanderers who never check local who's boss. 
---
Well that’s just the concept of inflation really.
---
I do understand what you means, but I still think that CCP did too little too late.
---
obsessed! very sad!
---
&gt; Hunter can't follow you through
---
perhaps they should act like gates in Age of Empires. enemies can jump through for a short time after someone else.
---
&gt;  Nuking rorqs to uselessness would just shift all of Delve to cheap turret mining.
---
Honestly, It think that would be preferable. There is a lot more danger in having a ton of hulks than a single rorqual.
---
Anecdotes are not evidence. But, I specifically said PC games. Arcade gaming and mobile gaming are huge in Japan. When EVE is available on the Switch or in Taito Station, then that info might be relevant. PC game is statistically not, regardless of what your stepson does.
---
I agree almost 100%.  
---
But they do take titan escalations too far. I.E. Dropping 5+ titans on our little Talwar Fleets.  
---
IOU is poor, don't break our bank by bosoning our talwars. :) 
---
This is a good and well-reasoned argument.
---
&gt; letting you casuals in was a mistake.
---
shit isn´t exclusive to gons. PH, Brave, etc all did their part. It´s almost like when you create themepark structures in a sandbox game and foster a generation of dependent numbnuts content generation and diversity go tits up over time. 
---
&gt;People want small fleets. They want roams. They want clear objectives
---
Is that why any "I want small gang back, here is my idea how to do it" get downvote to hell with everyone saying you are retarded and all you said is wrong ? You are just one of those vocal people who did not understand the game yet, comeback when you will.
---
Btw, I so much like people like you, it's been 2/3 week I enjoy dropping carriers on people looking for small gang fight, I really hope one day, you will take the bait on my proteus and I will light the cyno with all my carriers alt to rekt you, don't forget to send salt in mail
---
We do the same to FRT and their bots... They got a lot of em :D
---
Calling people casuals because they play differently doesn't bring back your era of not being at the bottom.
---
Except newbees aren't thinking about any of that when they're roaming with their three buddies. They're thinking, 'am I shooting spaceships?' and 'am I having fun?' From that starting point dragging people into block wars with thousands of other players with meaningful outcomes where they can also be shooting spaceships and having fun is absolutely the way to encourage player retention and long-term engagement. 
---
I see instead of proving my response wrong you took the troll poster route and showed me you're yet another Eve muppet. 
---
Yeah, it wouldn't be hulks.  Procurers.  
---
oh, someone here never killed something bigger than a cruiser, salty
---
how many times are people going to use the "HEY GUYS THIS RETARD DIED SO IT'S BALANCED" argument
---
No point in arguing with "numbers don't matter, only my opinion and playstyle". So you can argue with yourself man.
---
Whatever. Either way they're *far* easier to kill than rorqs. Even if there's 50 procs instead of 1 rorq, a roaming gang would be more likely to kill a few procs than the one rorq.
---
YES, YES, YES!! COME BACK TO EVE MY CHILD! COME TO SOV NULL!! WATCH IT ALL EXPLODE IN FIRE!!! YUSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
---
Would be too easy to take a spy and exploit this mechanic to move an entire fleet across enemy ansiblexes. 
---
Unbalanced rorqs are a serious problem but the massive increase in the rate of spod brain is also a serious problem especially considering how slow ccp are with changing things. 
---
We literally have the attention span of goldfish, keep up the good work. o7 
---
As long zkill provides statistical data that is a bit more reliable than emotional reaction.
---
Smart. If someone actually threatens your argument, just ignore them. That way you can still pretend that you're right and everyone agrees with you.
---
Cheaper Plex from CCP.  
---
I also like free titans and supers. Or just free skins. Meh, game is fine. Bitter vets just mad they can't get chicken dinners on PUBG.
---
this is not fornite kthxbye
---
lots of people die in jump freighters all the time, that doesn't mean they're balanced.
---
jump freighters can literally teleport from invulnerability to invulnerability, and the die by the dozens each month
---
that doesn't mean they're balanced.
---
Sounds like the reasonable response would be to require citadels in sov null to be placed by the alliance owning that sov, no?
---
Is amarr good for pvp or is it worth my time to just train into caldari/minmatar? Looking into solo/duo/trio pvp with my new corp.
---
Yes he should go back to the collossal then, as this is FarmVille now
---
Character attacks and insults. Obviously a good step up from emotional arguments when you don't want to address facts and stats. Keep on doing what you do.
---
Fortunately for you, Zkill doesn't provide data on how many rorqs survive a gank attempt.
---
See above
---
Maybe it does? It seems that your argument here is that because you can't kill as many of them as you want they aren't balanced.
---
I always thought of a bloc taking an entire region which is comprised of infighting alliances per constellation as a means of producing the best trained PvP pilots, but uniting against outsiders. However, this block would hardly be successful, since it would waste the majority of its resources on said infighting and hardly be capable of uniting against external threats, especially the more established powerblocks, Imperium, Legacy or GOTG/Panfam. After all you could be the best pilot in the game and it won't matter once you get titan-zerged.
---
If they can jump through although they aggressed you, that's broken. If you were the only aggressor then I don't see an issue. Not shooting to escape is a practical tactic. 
---
If you are trying to argue that encouraging new players to get into 3000 people TiDi fests where they have very little influence on the outcome of the fight is good for game health then you're either trolling or genuinely mentally handicapped, sorry dude.
---
&gt;meaningful outcomes
---
Do you even know what this means? Nothing in big bloc wars matters because a) every ship is already replaced by all the fucking Rorquals and b) nobody wants to seriously take the time to grind down all the sov and citadels. So how is any of this meaningful?
---
Getting new players into frigates and telling them 'don't worry if you die, just go find some people to shoot' is a far better introduction to EVE gameplay.
---
&gt; Why the game is dead
---
I read a really interesting review of *Breath of the Wild* this morning and it made me think why I miss that game more than Eve.
---
https://www.cnet.com/news/two-years-on-im-still-recovering-from-breath-of-the-wild/
---
One of the big rules in BotW is that winning a fight imposes meaningful upkeep costs, to the point that some of the resources the game gives you are actually too expensive to be worth using.  (Ancient arrows in particular.)
---
In Eve's mechanics it's far more expensive to lose than to win.  I think this has two negative effects on how the game is played.
---
 - Risk aversion.  There's so little incentive to take risks; the calculation people generally make is balancing expensive fun-per-hour vs the reliable isk-per-hour to support it.
---
 - Poor turnover.  There's nothing mechanical that discourages an empire from getting too big to lose.  There are certainly metagame factors (too big too boring, sabotage and betrayals) but if anybg *wants* to get big and static and turn Eve into Farmville in Space, they'll coalesce into a few or even just one boring blob. 
---
At first it wasn't fun to have all my nifty weapons keep breaking, but eventually I had the epiphany that I wasn't getting more powerful in the game by acquiring stuff or character points (though they did sometimes help, things like more hearts and stamina) but instead I was getting better *at* the game.  I had more knowledge of how to acquire anything I needed, so the stuff mattered less than the skill.
---
I really think everything above T1 battleships should have significant upkeep costs and also that rorqs are broken and their brokenness only synergizes with injectors.
---
Games that emphasize virtual goods over player resourcefulness are easier for their publisher to monetize in toxic and unfun ways.  I feel that Eve has always been a game about stuff - outrageous capitalism/feudalism/neoliberalism/tribalism *in space* - but outside of the flavor of the game it struck a clever balance between stuff and skill and  of course the duality between politics and warfare which is the game's strongest point.
---
It's getting more and more stuff-centric though, and that's why it doesn't inspire me anymore.  
---
&gt; This is a dialogue or review of the numbers based on zkill reporting.
---
It turned pretty quickly into a shit thread of you complaining at vaguely what reddit is saying pointing out the retards dying as valuable input for balance.
---
&gt; The numbers also seem to indicate that a massive number of drones are dying. If we scale that up to a month- 1200 per month? People are so busy complaining that rorquals have no weakness and a God level tank and yet the glaring weakness (70-80 % of the value of the hull + drones) is not able to survive attack.
---
If you make little mistake (aka if you're not completely afk), you can very easily safeguard those drones.
---
&gt; Putting a rorqual in a belt and making it a big stationary target is creating an immense amount of content daily.
---
No it's not, unless you're live in a region with little support and / or are bad. I've rarely had good fights around rorquals. It's either we get drop by carriers and supers, or the rorqual dies without much defense, often self destructing.
---
&gt; A lot of the anger is from the portion of the community that wants to roam around with four or five friends and be able to achieve as much as they did years ago. That isn't going to happen. The lethality of roaming ships has gone up with experience, modules and abyssal mutaplasmids making ships very very dangerous very quickly.
---
Yes and the types of targets is either a VNI or a carrier / rorqual / super that can easily defend itself. Not even talking about refineries who can fuck you up pretty badly on their own if you're not already in a proper fleet comp. They are no small targets for small group of roamers, but not every roam
---
&gt; The lethality of roaming ships has gone up with experience, modules and abyssal mutaplasmids making ships very very dangerous very quickly.
---
Lol the amount of bullshit you're spitting. How many roamers are you seeing with abyssal modules seriously ?
---
&gt; Here is an educated guess. If you alter the rorqual to the point that 5 or 10 small ships can kill it easily and quickly, 
---
Nobody is asking for this so stfu. The rorqual already lost their ridiculous fits, they are in a decent state, the only retarded thing about them is PANIC and maybe their stupid DPS with drones. Rorqual have a good enough tank right now, nobody is asking for it to be nerfed.
---
&gt; The argument would remain "Why cant I go kill that dude with a handful of my friends without people stopping me."
---
No it's not, that's your own self "educated guess" of what you think of shit reddit threads. It's far from the general non shit posting argument.
---
&gt;  When was the last time you went roaming or deployed a fleet to go hunt a few exhumers?
---
They are almost no exhumers to hunt.
---
&gt; All of these people have the rorqual alts now. If they instantly become stationary targets that die because no tank and no panic, those alts will all shift to hulks + 1 rorqual that boosts and is not sieged. The price of ore will shift downward. 
---
Yes because the ridiculous availability of ore isn't an issue in the game right now.
---
&gt; Those people will make the same relative level of income and now instead of belts of targets to attack, you will have belts of mobile small ships that all warp out the moment you hit system. That sounds pretty lame.
---
Yeah because that's not already the case with carriers and supers right ?
---
Your right. Perhaps we should see if they can include the data showing everyone 3 dudes attacked a rorqual and had to run away and post on reddit about how shit the game is. Would definitely add value to your statement.
---
for Horde yes. other alliances are harder to infiltrate. so would burning a spy be worth the benefit?
---
I'm just stooping to your level.
---
think about reaching out to 'Bastion' they are moving to fountain. if your stuff is there. they may be well interested in helping you back into the game, in exchange for your membership?
---
no, buying a medal doesnt mean you won a medal. reaching a goal and winning aren't the same. 
---
And new players who don't know globby yet means more people still willing to interact with him in a serious fashion.  I'm honestly torn on deciding if that is, on balance, a good thing or not.
---
So, emotional and any response but nothing to refute the numbers and other probably reasons for those results. Got it. Thanks for the emotional response.
---
Oh, you killed a Raven!!! Damn, you elite! Or was it a single cap sitting all by himself... damn your fleet is proper!
---
Play like me, kill half a dozen people in fights over nothing, or fuck off F1 monkey. Yup, it's definitely Rorquals that are the problem.
---
AU TZ :D
---
he has no life xd
---
Imperium would have to take KF off their ansiblex access list. Legacy would have to take Brave off. Panfam would take PH off. 
---
Every major power bloc, except maybe the Chinese and GotG, have a newbro friendly alliance that would get screwed by this
---
When the IRS sees primary source of income as RMT in a game where it is banned...
---
i don't kill any
---
my argument is that a ship shouldn't be able to put over half of it's value into an invulnerable crate right before it dies and come retrieve it later
---
7o
---
Actually those who want small pvp back are getting upvoted. One way to do this is give subcaps more OBJECTIVES when roaming. But hey, you'll catch up to me one day. I think you're a quick learner.
---
Well,,, I will continue to play and enjoy every moment until it does then... :)
---
damn ur a faggot
---
What the fuck are you even talking about?
---
I'm done talking with you, but know this: your opinions are horrible and you are part of the cancer that is killing this game. 
---
I can get on board with that.
---
... what?
---
As I said goals are perspective and placed individually in eve. If ones goal to lose a carrier than he very much so did just that. 
---
No buying a medal doesnt mean you won it but you still have a medal. There is no defining moment stating win. So you set your own goals or win moments. 
---
You seem to hate the idea of someone winning if it to you means they post. Yes that guy 100 percent lost a carrier and the isk it took that he likely purchased, to get it. And they probably even injected with the ap they bought to fly it at that. Paying. To gain access.. to late game content... is 100 percent p2w as opposed to playing the normal way. But eve is special in the p2w market as it still doesnt mean you win jack as your win may be nothing or pale in comparison to what others have done. Hence... it's all perspective. My god o wasted more time on this argument. We can continue but I'm just kinda done.
---
Nestor for making isk. T3c’s are popular for solo or small gang stuff. Something to scan in: I use an astero. Then we have many pvp doctrines, all just T2 stuff: Munnins, Sleipners, damnations, confessors, HFI, etc.
---
I only mention it because I can already imagine the whining about how attacking ships that insure and tank so well is OP and at least when we had rorqs you could kill excavators etc.
---
Oh god he did it, he finally went full retard
---
&gt;After a super-productive summit with the CSM, we’re also developing plans to address key community concerns including capital balance (and balance in general), wealth distribution, war declarations and the abundance of ISK faucets in New Eden. We will of course also be continuing the never-ending war on botting and RMT and are currently in the process of setting up a sizable internal taskforce to look at botting in more depth.
---
big if true, but probably just more words to douse the flames and falling player numbers
---
Can't take the gate if you have aggression timer, unlike ~~no risk escape gates~~ wormholes
---
Just switch timezones ez
---
Absolutely. Every race is relatively balanced. Amarr has a good lineup of ships. The one exception is if your Corp runs a shield doctrine, as Amarr ships tend to suck at shield tanking
---
What exactly do you think your numbers mean?
---
&gt;Later this month at GDC 2019 we will run a technical test to see if we can get 10,000 EVE internet spaceships fighting on Hadean’s Aether engine.

---
oh, we heard. we're just....skeptical.
---
ccp has a long habit of taking things away, and saying they'll be back.
---
they never come back.
---
plus you literally don't have the staffing to run the AT currently since the community team is just you now. 
---
Hmm. Okay
---
&gt; My assertion is that
---
You assertion was : 
---
&gt; plex is skyrocketing because a huge chunk of people are in maintenance/afk mode
---
Which you only now transform as "less people are selling PLEX" (which we have 0 numbers about) and "more people are plexing" which we know.
---
PLEX can just be explain without inventing things. Isk from ratting have gone up by a crazy amount (cf MER) in the past months and those people are willing to pay more isk to PLEX. Nothing to do with AFK people. And until you pull out the amount of PLEX on the market, you cannot extrapolate out of anywhere that people are less willing to sell PLEX. But I guess that's normal in america to pull things out of your ass.
---
GDC is 12 Days away. 
---
Holy Fucking Hype
---
Because they have such small penises. Balance baby.
---
tl;dr: we'll fix everything
---
Guess you have a hard time reading or comprehending. Goodwill and plenty of PC Japanese gamers. Majority of the Nihon PC gamers are not interested in eve. You simply just like to talk out your ass and have no clue on the subject at hand.
---
&gt;Which you only now transform as "less people are selling PLEX" (which we have 0 numbers about) and "more people are plexing" which we know.
---
never once stated, where are you getting this? hello?
---
&gt; but nothing to refute the numbers and other probably reasons for those results.
---
Yes their is one, it's right there :
---
&gt; pointing out the retards dying as valuable input for balance.
---
Right. We're currently living in C1 WH space so we don't see anything larger than a BC. I was doing some reading on the forums, but all the articles were from 2017, and stating that any amarr ship sucked for pvp besides the T2 frigates. 
---
Big egos... that's for sure... balances out the small penis. 
---
Imagine being a tapi pet
---
We lost Delve, back to Saranen
---
This is really interesting.  I remember hearing about Hadean before, quite likely from here.  If we can truly get the kind of massive fights that EVE is known for without soul-crushing, mod-bugging TiDi, this would be huge for the game.  It would also mean we could far more titans and supers in any given capital fight - an ISK sink that this game really needs.
---
That's fair. When T20 happened I understood where they were going with the idea but wasn't sold. There never was a "no to CSM" option on voting so many of us just voted abstain or ignored it completely. 
---
I think if the CSM weren't there at all, much of what happened still would have happened, bad and good. Monoclegate would have been just as bad, "little things" would have gotten done, one way or the other. The various things they did to make themselves sellable would have happened regardless of CSM. 
---
I think we can agree to disagree at this point. 
---
I mean, that's not a bad point. In my opinion, I think T1 insurance is stupidly good. Although I think being able to actually kill ships is more satisfying that killing drones (although the drones are worth far more).
---
you´re right. fachidiot would probably the better term. 
---
Yeah you're imagining things that you want to imagine but wouldn't happened.
---
They mean what they mean. Lots of them die. They are killable. The drones are a weakness. They are providing content. They are not invincible.
---
Thank you based reddit retard very cool.
---
Wormholer btw?
---
So like the other guy said, there are other options available, and many prefer them because you don’t need to baby drones as much (missle boats or Guristas ships with tougher drones). But a myrmidon can do up to c3 sites without too much trouble. I believe mine gets up to 700 dps tank which is either at or only slightly below the c3s damage. It’ll take awhile, and you will be constantly recalling and putting drones back out.
---

&gt; idiot rorqual pilots are easier to kill than smart ones
---
idiot rorqual pilots are easier to kill than non-afk ones
---
gigitty
---
I mean. If we want to call everyone that dies an idiot so that it makes the numbers not accurate, what's to stop someone else to just say the reason more aren't dying is because they are better players than the small gangs coming in? 
---
&gt;They are not invincible.
---
No one makes this point.
---
&gt;They are providing content.
---
No one has stated otherwise.
---
&gt;The drones are a weakness.
---
&gt;They are killable. 
---
&gt;Lots of them die. 
---
As opposed to what?
---
Your numbers basically tell us things that literally everyone already knows, and you're dismissing points that have nothing to do with what you've just said "Based off of the numbers"
---
Why is this subreddit full of fucking retards jfc.

Cheers from all the old DHSJ bro's. He will be missed greatly.

That's fair.

i dont think they have the numbers to actually threaten a keepstar especially with ravens

No u.

This post reads like:
---
First part: HOLY SHIT STFU you screeching autists we are working on things you keep posting about and will post more in the next few weeks 
---
second part: here is some marketing copy for this company I think is cool (and/or might have invested in, you decide) and I want to try and solve the c10k problem with some eve flavored branding, a problem that has been solved for almost as long as Eve has existed.
---
Except those 50 procs are actually capable of warping off you know. Or they can throw literally 10k dps at you with light drones.
---
&gt; 1) Many people refuse to pay real money to play Eve in it's current state.
---
&gt; The drop off of the population has an equal effect generally on the people who PLEX their accounts and who purchase PLEX to sell in game.
---
And most importantly your stupid graph when you literally makes the green line decrease ...
---
Having seen this in action (was part of the 1k player tech test a couple weeks back) I could see this actually working and working damn well.
---
But we gotta see how this actually translates to EVE outside of a dogfighting deathmatch.
---
Excellent post!  We're glad to have you Norman! Thank you for sharing your perspective! 
---
Everyone knows it, except for 4 different people stating otherwise in threads within 24 hours. As for your question without a question mark.. what drew you to this subreddit? That would answer your question.
---
One thing is for sure, he runs it on one keyboard.
---
thats like saying, take a paycut so the country can equalize its wealth, great idea, se how many followers it gets
---
&gt;Everyone knows it, except for 4 different people stating otherwise in threads within 24 hours.
---
Who has stated otherwise and what have they said?
---
Ben my friend this was a big shock I only talked to you a few weeks ago bout comming back to eve and how we would fly and blow up shit together like we have been doin for the past 9 or 10 years and now I'll never get to fly with you ever again cyno is green brother jump on home
---
"Are these bots or some thirteen year old 500 apm korean kid?"
---
Maybe.  But then, afk VNIs are pretty similar, and plenty of people complain about them.
---
We had fun, though?
---
Common sense ? Experience ? Video records ?
---
it decreases because the playerbase decreased, and I literally fucking explained in the text that apparently you didn't read that: 
---
&gt;The drop off of the population has an equal effect generally on the people who PLEX their accounts and who purchase PLEX to sell in game.
---
Which means it has no fucking net effect, as I literally just fucking said three times you absolute mongoloid.
---
As I don't feel inclined to copy and paste quoted from other threads, I will immediately agree that you are correct and everyone in all of eve knows and supports the statistics. GG /s
---
100% agree... subcaps need better defined roles and objectives. 
---
Youd get friction burns homey
---
thank you for admitting your idiocy 
---
Alright fair enough misunderstood that, your smug ass posting not really helping that.
---
haha idiot horse cannot hide from the IIA
---
Assumptions based on opinions?
---
I love how all the comments are basically "hurt durr that's just your opinion, rorqs really are op because I said so" but nobody is paying attention to the monstrously long time it takes to recoup your investment. 360 HOURS of MINING for the costs of injecting and fitting a non-poverty rorq, or 80 HOURS for just the fit. These things are a literal ball and chain for anyone who makes the mistake of training into them, but nah, let's keep needing them and making them even worse shall we.
---
small input, a proper fit Rorqual can still tank ~ 50k(for cheaper fits)  and over 100k COLD for bling fits. And this while completly cap dry, just off of its 2 Cap boosters. I think this is still way over the top. 100k DPS is 200 normal DPS ships. 2 fucking hundred, WHILE you neutpressure them.
---
&gt; If there are many rorquals around, more of them are going to die
---
If you make them easy to kill, there will be less of them around.  See how this works?  You failed to take into account anything that contradicts your argument.
---
Yes we do. =)
---
Interesting; looks like it'll lean more towards the Valkyrie crowd.
---
You are one of those pseudo intellectual types that needs to find and win internet fights to feel validation, eh? I had a friend like that once. Hope you turn out better.
---
&gt; The rorqual already lost their ridiculous fits, they are in a decent state, the only retarded thing about them is PANIC and maybe their stupid DPS with drones. Rorqual have a good enough tank right now, nobody is asking for it to be nerfed.
---
This is the one point in your argument that I would dispute. Even after the nerf to ancil boosters on rorqs, they still have the ability to fit an insane amount of active tank that can handle over 100 HACs worth of DPS. I think this is way too much.
---
&gt; But we gotta see how this actually translates to EVE outside of a dogfighting deathmatch.
---
Absolutely, and Hilmar says as much:
---
&gt; Be warned though, what you will be experiencing is not a game, it´s not even a prototype of a game. This is the raw Aether engine with EVE spaceship assets and some interaction dynamics, which are nothing like EVE Online or EVE: Valkyrie. CCP is providing our visual assets for use in the Aether Engine, enabling Hadean to focus on addressing the challenges we face with large-scale online multiplayer environments. This will almost certainly blow up if you guys show up in force, so please do because R&amp;D is about breaking things!
---
I'm fully expecting the 10k demo to crash and burn, but they want to get real data in the most organic simulation they can muster.  Throwing a bunch of 'thin clients' at it doesn't fully simulate actual, organic gameplay.  I'm really looking forward to this thing.
---
Stop arguing with these idiots.  They weren't around back when we were able to train intelligence to level V.
---
TL;DR: Some dudes need more dudes to mass test a new engine. Can you help them? Has nothing to do with eve in the foreseeable future.
---
Yes because numbers alone shows a cristal clear picture which you can extrapolate everything from ?
---
Just look at every answer you're getting and you will see how retarded what you are saying.
---
Heh. You got a laugh 
---
Definitely come chat with us in recruitment.  We have a great time!
---
Very interesting. Considering its free I'ma download it and try it out when the test begins in 11ish days
---
I'd like to see a pushed toward sub-caps having more objectives and clearer roles not involved in structures. Objectives to complete before caps come in. 
---
North or South?
---
Not if the people who are afk are the ones who buy the plex for $$$.
---
Same can be said about some goons 
---
Don't talk about yourself in the third person.  And in that vain, don't be so hard on yourself.
---
True, but I would rather battle for PANIC nerf / removal or WETU removal than tanking nerf. PANIC is the real PITA. Even with 1000 dude you're still going to waste a crazy amount of time just because magic safe button.
---
Data allows for a lot of deductions that are based in fact. They are a bit more sound than emotional response. And yes all of the responses are exactly what you said, they are angry emotional knee jerk responses that aren't based on fact but option and desire to have easier pvp.
---
Oh, no doubt.  I am not trying to generalize bastion, just saying that less drama is good.
---
The advantage of dealing with goons being stupid though, is that Innominate just shoots them.  With allies it takes a bit longer.
---
The balls it takes to do that... no wonder hes so short being dragged down by those massive balls all day
---
That's reasonable. I suppose those two are bigger problems than straight up tank.
---
Oof that was pretty forced lol
---
Your answers are the most emotional knee jerking here lol
---
dafuq are you implying? hes a handsome mofo
---
Give subcaps objectives to complete before structures can be attacked. Sort of like Han Solo taking down the shield generator before another fleet can attack. The objectives can be done per system in highly defended hubs
---
Proof or just talk?
---
*hordeling looks up*
---
whats a truce?

Is there anything more you'd like me to track? I'm trying to get ideas
---
Man you're so much describing yourself in every single one of your comments it's hilarious.
---
Also you have to undock the ravens for it to work
---
one day it will be true,
---
ive always laughed at the eve is dead meme, 
---
for me, and many of my friends. and truely from alot of redditors of eve too.
---
eve is dead meme is beccoming less and less a meme and more, were only even still playing due to time invested, and eventually. that will run out completly if not already for the many, many people who have left already.
---
eve is dead is a meme, the fact eve is dying and at a tipping point without any sight of improvements is factual. :(
---
I'm in that kind-of mood today.
---
I would just shoot Bastion too and I am in that "alliance" i mean i really dont like some Bastion corps either. Thats one reason i only supercrab to get some isk so i dont have to deal with mining bs
---
inb4 reported for input broadcasting
---
I really hope this thread gets as spicy as the last one tbh
---
Yeah I don't think it is possible tbf otherwise alliances would have a bit too much Intel. I'd personally say more likely 2.5 rorqs for each super is more realistic, or if anything slightly above that but thats obviously from limited experience I haven't been in every coalition obviously
---
Good job 
---
Nope.
---
Yeah, I really hate drama in general... which is a nice feature of being in goons.
---
The problem is that GSF does respect our allies in their ability to deal with their own issues.  I do wish the rule was though that if you are ratting in GSF space in Delve, Innominate dealt with any issues... that would simplify a lot.
---
Incorrect.
---
Oh that's right. Also, I've never heard of bubbles or warp disruptors or smartbombs.
---
I honestly dont know anymore.  I have so many goo dmemories of this game from the 2007-2010 era, but its just salt salt and more salt nowadays.  I honestly think sov and capitals ruined the eve that i loved.
---
I think the answer is separating objectives between subcaps and caps. Subcaps should have a list of tasks to complete per system, then caps would come in. The two ship types need to be two defined roles. I agree with all your reasons on why you left. However, the players here seem to think bigger is better. It may be a hard pull to bring back subcaps into the picture.  
---
Truce is what saved Horde from getting farmed by NC. supers
---
Jesus christ, this is the wall (of text) Trump wanted. Gimmie a TL;DR or at least format properly

Losing titans doesn't remove any ISK from the game, just minerals.

Dictionary result for winning: gaining, resulting in, or relating to victory in a contest or competition.
---
Dictionary result for goal: the object of a person's ambition or effort; an aim or desired result.
---
You don't get to change the definition on these, that's what they mean and now u need to accept that. 
---
Now stop bitching that wins are vague, they are not, goals can be vague.
---
Yes, I know. But there are other battle to fight that are more worth it than just tank ability.
---
RIP Bro, your corp roams ins are gonna feel alot emptier now  :(
---
Small gang pvp needs to come back. I think the answer is to somehow separate caps and subcaps giving each more defined roles and objectives. Both would be needed, but subcaps should need to achieve several system wide tasks before caps could be useful and needed. 
---
He also promises more announcements such as balance passes.
---
Just for completions sake. 
---
I'm going to take the amount of downvotes you're receiving as statistical data that prove this is correct.
---
I'll take all of the downvotes. Rorqual pilots &gt; small gang pilots to CCP. Prove me wrong.
---
Weird, its literally a wall with only periods and commas for formatting
---
On mobile btw
---
Actually they were working together way before that, pretty much right after Test kicked CO2 out of Legacy
---
Also, size of territory means nothing. Active pilots and resources are way more important.
---
+ anti cap fortis do shit to sub caps 
---
Ok I cant be the only one that despises these excavator posts, is there a way to filter them out because it's getting to the point where I'm starting to hate refreshing this sub if all the content is about excavator kills
---
Quick bois, start shitting out shield supers!
---
CCP is gonna get a good bed shitting session in. I bet any changes they make only make the problems worse. Just like citadel 2.0
---
im clearly a bit simple or dumb. is this going to maybe one day, become an eve 2. the next step. the next game that i can fly internet spaceships. the same way i do in eve, but not with the concentration on ship graphics and interiors like star citizen and more on gameplay and addictive pvp like eve online (1)
---
Well because legacy was so small befor that they needed goons right ? 
---
wow if only there was an option to make it take longer to show up, wow that would be so progressive and big brained of ccp, too bad they never added that to the game, gee whiz
---
https://puu.sh/CVYAK/eefbc45ecc.png
---
&gt;  Rorqual pilots &gt; small gang pilots to CCP. Prove me wrong.
---
Yes because small gang pilots aren't multi boxing their main subcap, tackle alt and cap alt at the same time right ? And they aren't getting any way to farm isk, not injecting anything ...
---
Oh wait they are.
---
Hard cringe.
---
You wouldn't dare say talk shit like this in AU tz!
---
Hello Kitty Avatar skin pls and thxs
---
Can i offer you some new skins?
---
And for anyone curious, here's what CCP sent out to the press this morning.

CCP Games Partners with Hadean For 10,000 Player Deathmatch in _EVE: Aether Wars_
---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
_GDC attendees can witness the tech demo in action, with a special talk from CCP Games CEO Hilmar V. Pétursson on March 20 (GDC Stand S366)_  
---
**6 March 2019 – London, United Kingdom -** CCP Games, the creators of the in-depth and uniquely player-driven spaceship MMO game _EVE Online_, has announced a partnership with deep tech start-up Hadean for _EVE: Aether Wars_, a groundbreaking tech demo that will explore opportunities for largescale multiplayer simulation in CCP’s current and future games.  
---
Hadean is the creator of Aether Engine, the world’s first distributed simulation engine that allows developers to create cloud-native games with unprecedented gameplay possibilities. As [announced](https://www.hadean.com/blog/unlocking-the-potential-of-the-intelligent-cloud-edge-with-microsoft-azure) last month, Aether Engine will be powered by Microsoft Azure to allow developers to seamlessly scale their applications at increased speed and ease across the cloud.  
---
Aether Engine will receive its first public showing at GDC 2019 through _EVE: Aether Wars_, a real-time 10,000 player space deathmatch. To participate, prospective players can sign up for free by visiting [www.aetherengine.io/pvp-10k](http://www.aetherengine.io/pvp-10k) to provide their details.  
---
The _EVE: Aether Wars_ tech demo will be followed by a lightning talk from CCP Games’ CEO Hilmar V. Pétursson and hosted by Hadean. _‘Emergent Game Design: What has CCP learnt over the years?’_ will take place at Stand S366 at 11:00 PST on Wednesday 20 March.  
---
CCP is providing _EVE Online_ and _EVE: Valkyrie_ assets for use in the Aether Engine, enabling Hadean to focus on addressing the challenges faced by developers within large-scale online multiplayer environments. The ongoing collaboration between the two companies will seek to explore the potential for substantial changes to the technical infrastructure of _EVE Online_.  
---
The _EVE Online_ community [currently holds](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/4/eve-online-gamers-set-new-record-for-taking-part-in-a-huge-video-game-battle-522213) the Guinness World Record for “most concurrent players simultaneously involved in a single multiplayer PvP videogame battle” with 6,142 players on 23rd  January 2018.  
---
“We are thrilled to have the support of CCP Games with _EVE: Aether Wars_,” said Craig Beddis, Hadean’s CEO. “This move allows us to focus on our strength – building technology that unlocks new creative possibilities for games developers. We have a world-class team of engineers at Hadean creating _EVE: Aether Wars_ and CCP’s expertise ensures that we have the perfect partner to match the pioneering ambition and robust quality of our technology.”  
---
“Hadean’s technology has the potential to unlock huge creative and design-orientated freedom within virtual worlds such as _EVE_,” said Hilmar V. Pétursson, CCP Games’ CEO. “We are very happy as always to join up with intrepid pioneers setting out to push the boundaries of what is possible. Continuing to do that I believe will bring about the conditions where _EVE_ will outlive us all. We therefore embrace the chance to inject New Eden into the Aether Engine and create the stunning sci-fi spectacle _EVE: Aether Wars_. I for one am excited to see our internet spaceships from _EVE Online_ and _EVE: Valkyrie_ playing together, enabled by this cutting-edge technology!”

Thanks for coming out with us!! I hope you have many many more of these moments.
---
*Blood for the Blood God*
---
Only 3 accounts? Rookie numbers.
---
Uhhhh no that’s not what saved them 
---
I'm reminded of The Expanse and how the Belters talk. 
---
I think Eve's wormhole community has there own language now. It was to repeatedly incoherent to be just a poor understanding of the human tongue. 
---
Good bait. But no.
---
Smartbombing procurers? Okay there bud.
---
This will age well Im sure. 
---
404... Link is dead. I suppose someone fucked up releasing the info? What did it say?
---
What the flying fuckety fuck is a "deep tech start-up"?  "deep tech"?  I smell bollocks already.
---
Yes I expect CCP to do their jobs and create free infrastructure that at the very basic level allows you to run a serious Corporation, i.e SEaT without relying on third party developers and hosting. And again, I'm thankful that players HAVE created these tools and are hosting them on their own dime, because Eve would surely be dead without these players willing to work and create basic tools for free in their spare time and share that work with others. 
---
My question is why: why are you dong CCP's job for them, and why are you advocating against yourself? 
---
And again, I'm very happy you're financially free enough to be able to pay for many alts and host all the services you needed outside of game,.
---
&gt;I thought this was obvious, but I guess not. The bigger groups...
---
Jesus Christ, God forbid I ask CCP to improve the game and use 1% of my sub money to host basic tools.
---
&gt;Your assertion that the technology that GSF, or TEST
---
When the fuck did I ever assert that? Now you're just putting words into my mouth. It's not what keeps them ahead, it's why no other entity even throws their hat into the ring and why all new players are directed to the same 3-4 null sec entities, because that's how important those "QoL" tools are. 
---
If you don't think CCP should host basic player tools on their own dime, then frankly, I just flat out disagree with you and there is no point in continuing this conversation as we are arguing opinions.
---
Holy shirt balls, this sounds amazing! A total rewrite of the core ship handling code, to support huge numbers of players?
---
LOL 2 years.  As if that is a significant amount of time in eve.   People were duping moon goo for far longer than that.  
---
o7. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Sadly, people on the internet behave like they have no brain or ability to absorb information.
---
Or they're just so used to being lied to that they assume it is so whenever the opportunity presents itself?
---
Kinda like eve will never be PTW, by the way, herte's some extractors...
---
&gt;We’re constantly fighting the unwinnable war against our community's ingenuity, tenacity and love for New Eden.
---
#THIS IS IT, BOYS! PROOF THAT CCP IS FIGHTING OUR LOVE FOR NEW EDEN!!
---
Now all those hateful changes to eve make sense! /S
---
thank you foodster, very cool!
---
They smell like just words to avoid drama around, but it's probably a good hint at what was talked about during the summit.
---
I'll be honest I didn't really read or take in much of the rest of the article, all I can say is I hope the part I quoted above is more than just words on a page.
---
You smartbomb the drones, genius.
---
How the fuck after 2 years you still have not injected that fuckin Gallente Destroyer skillbook?
---
The "x" is dying argument is bollocks for one simple reason: You can only guess at how many _didn't die_ and how many never got tackled in the first place because of how hard they are to kill. Maybe if you're the IT guy for a large coalition you could approximate for your own members, but outside of that everyone is guessing and only CCP knows.
---
That said, anyone who's spent basically any time in Delve, Esoteria, or the North before X47 knows its a huge number.
---
What I fear the most is that CCP might be looking at the numbers in a similiar way you do 
---
That shouldn’t be *too* horrible on cap. Usually, running armor and shield reps on one ship is not a good idea, so maybe replace that with a damage mod, cap mod, or damage control (though I’m not super experienced in solo frog pvp). Next make sure you have loaded the boosters into your MASB, because that causes it to use less cap. Also, you shouldn’t be running the armor rep until you are out of cap boosters. There is no point healing armor if you are at max. After that, you shouldn’t be running the MASB without cap charges. It’ll one shot your cap, shield boosters are hungry. Finally, skills. Engineering skills can have a huge impact on your cap, and the train is well worth it.
---
Thank you CCP Guard. Thanks for all the hard work, keeping patience and spreading fun. Wish you all the best in career and personal life. Lets drink one (or more) at EVEsterdam end of the month.
---
Company culture changes over the years. Sometimes, the company you're working at isn't the one you started at. It's good to change view, do different things, see how business can be done differently in different areas, topics. 
---
Again, thanks for all and see you end of March.
---
I think it's AI/Machine Learning terminology, which is part of Azure cloud based system I guess.
---
Dreads were in the game before carriers.
---
Reset server, delete caps, a fuckton of other things i dont care enough to think about. 
---
I hope it happens. But holy crap there’s a lot of buzzwords in this blog. 
---
I won't disagree with that. I also think that knowing how many survived would be an interesting fact to have and compare. It would be in a similar vein to how many supers or capitals or VNIs didn't die because they warped out before being tackled. But that is a lot of what if conjecture that could be convoluted.
---
Megas to roll holes and ravens for home defense ?
---
Do go on..?
---
market alt
---
&gt;wealth distribution
---
SEIZE THE MEANS OF PLANETARY PRODUCTION
---
ghost training lasted over a year...
---
Scanning, exploration, WH chain mapping, finding routes to HS for my corp-mates, contributing to intel channels, ninja huffing/salvaging/bounty claiming, scouting, spotting, belt ratting, hacking sites, ratting in general, salvaging what I kill...
---
Just to name a few activities...
---
“Cannot be deployed within X km of a collider”
---
 10 minute fix
---
Man, if only CCP did a thing that reduced the speed one could project capitals. 
---
But then they'd have to do something about certain ships/fits being pretty much un-killable without capitals or massive numbers. 
---
And then they'd have to provide other choices that were valid rather than just "Hey this ones OP, fly it". 
---
While they're at it they can make brawlers useful again. 
---
And over 50% of the other ships in eve. 
---
Then maybe tweak some numbers on everything.
---
A good  6 dread can recoup it's money in 2 hours for a 4b dit. It can make its investment 10x over in 20 hours. A rorqual would need thousands of hours. There comes a break point where it doesn't make sense to do something and with the volume of anger at carriers being aligned out, is that what everyone wants rorqual pilots to turn into? VNI, rattlesnakes, and whatever else all aligned out. That sucks.
---
wow if only retards would read the thread before posting shit 6 other people have posted and read my refutation
---
I'm sure you can fit a ton of smartbombing power into the destroyer-or-below hulls that people use to do things in space these days due to their crippling fear of loss.
---
&gt; click them
---
obviously the joke is that they are red chevrons now now red plusses jeez
---
More like the ability to have an engine able to handle thousands of players. I assume that in their partnership they get the engine for free for another MMO, as I doubt Eve would be able to handle a sweep in engine after 16 years.
---
So, change most of the game from how it is now based on your perspective? No sarcasm.
---
i lose patience, i have to deal with people on here who have no idea what the fuck is going on around them on a daily basis and i just don't give a fuck at a certain point
---
Of course, it does, losing more titans per fight would be a huge hit to alliance SRP funds. The alliance ISK cushions would be heavily reduced. Increased sale of ore would also push prices up.
---
Came here to say exaclty that lol
---
Zero for csm
---
Since we realized the game craps out for 5k people on the 32 bit client, we want to see it crap out for 10k people on a 64 bit one. Oh and we promise we will give you the updates you want, but for right now, dance for me. 
---
yes please, im also trying to find some old footage for a video.
---
Dammit, this isn't right!
---
Flew with the guy for almost 2 years.
---
I'm no fan of Amarr ships but I definitely know that they have good ships. The imperial navy slicer is a very good kiting ship and a good place to learn kiting in. Retribution is the same but with more tank and more DPS. The Omen navy issue is a very good cruiser. Fast, has good damage projection, good at kiting and in anti tackle role. The prophecy can be a brick tanked hull, great for baiting. The Armageddon is a good BS with great neut capabilities. Generally, Amarr ships are good at neuting the hell out of others
---
Perhaps a poor way of phrasing 'low level code' for not tech-savvy people?
---
I believe I was one or the people you are referring to. Though I didn't say they are impossible to be killed, I said they can be invulnerable. Literally, for 5 minutes with the panic mod, and a wetu to instantly save their drones
---
when you put your excavators into the mobile depot. the cheap mobile depot that fits them all. you can replace a fully fit rorqual in 2-3hours on the right moon. . . . 
---
How can we break it?
---
i sincerely dont understand what your response has to do with my statement above
---
I did reference part of what you said and it's not meant as a slight. There are a lot of perceptions and hot feelings about rorquals. Seeing raw numbers can help put things in perspective. I personally don't think it's such a horrible thing that something that takes hundreds of hours to break even on investment wise can take a beating.
---
Numbers.
---
THAT'S WHO IS ALWAY IN 39P!!!
---
Ironically yes but nothing in his behaviour stood out even though that was a weird circle of friends. 
---
Year later and we will be wondering what happened to this /s
---
Agreed. If you are a trader, or involved in any way in complex manufacturing, you know what a complete pain in the ass is this is. 
---
These guys are afk cloaky campers, they are online maybe 20 hours a day.
---
While it's true that mostly dumb and/or inattentive people get caught, the comparison is a bit unfair. The cloaker can sit there 23/7, deciding exactly when he will strike. The spod bod can't shut down his activities entirely just because of one neut in local. No one is going to mine with 100% attention 23/7.
---
I'm not even a miner, but my point is that when you sit there 23/7 cloaked, you are going to get kills just due to the sheer number of events occuring.
---
that is not what an ISK sink is.
---
ship destruction is a mineral sink.  
---
ship destruction is an ISK faucet. because of insurance.
---
Yeah, if they're able to follow through on this paragraph...perfect.
---
Very interesting, signed up for the mass test.
---
thats your issue. numbers are facts. however facts only make sense as arguments in a discussion if you interpret them somewhat correctly in the system you are trying to evaluate. you fail terrible at this.
---
"wealth distribution"? Smells like communism...
---
Wow... you killed... drones. Something I hate as a relatively newly returned player is how the killboard litmus has switched from "what is a corps win/loss percentage" to "how much isk have I destroyed."
---
I mean seriously, you killed drones. This is not an amazing or particularly difficult feat. Sorry. 
---
&gt; We caught rorqs fair and square
---
Is that where the bar for catching something is being moved now, "fair and square" is self-tackling for 5 minutes at a stretch
---
It's truly remarkable how the simple mind rationalizes what it's owed
---
Alphas can't do PI, I don't see a point why would you want to have Omega pilots to do PI only, it's not worth effort, nor it is fun thing to do.
---
Hopefully I am better at numbers than you are at punctuation, otherwise your highly educated appraisal of my ability might matter, eh?
---
Maybe try reducing the CPU needs from modules like the damage control (use compact one) and the ballistic control (again use the compact one) to be able to to fit the enduring afterburner, enduring web and scram in order to get more capacitor. I use almost the same fit and with everything on, the cap lasts for 1min23 seconds for me. That usually is enough to last until I kill someone or get killed myself.
---
Ok but how it could be implemented to eve? Or it's an early announcement of eve 2?
---
In before Eve 2
---
&gt;Sadly, people on the internet behave like they have no brain or ability to absorb information.
---
... although I'm sure the majority of people here would agree to that!
---

Is there a T1 you could recommend (not necessarily a fit)? I'd like to start with T1s as I'm not the richest pilot, and with very little pvp interaction I know for a fact I'll lose several ships before I see any sort of success.
---
They said the same for walking in stations
---
Remember structure void bombs? When they decided to "nerf" them, they ended up making them stronger.
---
Good times.
---
If you 0.1 isk me, I'll 0.1 isk you.
---
If you drop the price? I'll 0.1 isk you.
---
Am I still making a profit? I'll 0.1 isk you.
---
If you buy me out, I'm just gonna dump more stock on the market and 0.1isk you.
---
At the end of the day, there's gonna be different view points on this, I say leave the prices good and if you can't be bothered to compete then just fuck off.
---
Very sad. Remember max dudes on mining op today.
---
That is not The American Way!
---
Analysis of statistics seems to be though?
---
[Hey. Hey, you. Yeah. You sound like a smart guy. Wa-... Wanna buy some deep-tech?](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/scratchpad/images/5/51/LeftytheSalesman.jpg)
---
Yeah, but how on earth do you plan to take that much isk out of the economy without making it impossible for new players to get a foot into the door?
---
I smell a scam
---
no but i am not trying to make statistic based balance assumptions
---
My dream would be for CCP to make it such that I could extend UI elements as separate windows from the main client, such that every time I undocked half my screen was not dedicated to local, d-scan, and intel windows. 
---
I want those things separate on screen two or three so I can fly my ship properly. 
---
Don't know about that - if Korean FCs are anything like their admirals Panfam and The Imperium may be in a run for their money!   
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi\_Sun-sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Sun-sin)
---
Damn u r a retard
---
huh, so it seems. my bad!
---
No, you are making assumptions based on someone else's analysis on statistics.
---
NO COMRADE GRAB THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION AND RUN
---
The point it is it is horse shit when a Rorq can just activate invincibility mode against being tackled or attacked so the cap blob can roll in. It is just more anti-risk design that has insulated null blobs from feeling any pain 
---
No, what is remarkable is how fags like yourself justify this lameass risk adverse gameplay CCP has implemented.
---
&gt;RemindMe! one year
---
Ill join you, so you don't feel alone when you're reminded in 1 year.   
---
7.5 minutes at lvl 5. Just sayin'.
---
Quit eve a few years ago, was a corpmate of mine for a decent chunk of the time i played. sad to hear
---
Me love neut burst 
---
*material sink, not ISK sink.
---
But yeah, I agree 
---
Oh yeah I'm a pleb I can't count my bad
---
I recommend reading this article - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SV_sWWIinoheBaGZgL2nUVJGYwnsNJqJ/view 
---
It's a very good introduction into all the t1 frigates. So just read about the Executioner, Punisher and the Tormentor. It will give you all the info you need. 
---
He’s talking about groups they are still here and still playing, not those who have quit. I asked where these folks are complaining, and it’s crickets. Because they aren’t. And based on the numbers I’ve seen, they aren’t quitting either. Actual physical players numbers are stable, have been for a few years. 
---
CSM isn’t going anywhere until Hilmar decided he doesn’t want it anymore. He created it, still supports it and every time I’ve talked to him over the last year he’s said as much. 
---
Hippity Hoppity Abolish Goon Property
---
&gt;Ok I cant be the only one that despises these excavator posts
---
Yeah right...so much that you are compelled to not only look at the posts you so despise, you even post in them.  Just ignore them and move along, no one forces you to click on links my friend.
---
The ultimate plan is looking like a re-write of the engine code of eve that allows us to keep having larger fights and hopefully eliminate TiDi from some of the small to medium sized ones, And maybe even the high 1000 player fights.
---
Think you missed my point bebe. I also cloaky hunt in delve, and the amount of bots/broadcasters I catch in there is literally insane. I logged in last night and within 2 seconds I checked dscan to see that all 24 rorquals on grid had already pulled excavs and launched mining drone IIs.
---
The rorqual bot epidemic in delve is ludicrously bad. 
---
Not to mention three days to kill a Mobile depot. Fuck me.
---
Name one type of moon ore that can make you 1.5bil per hour. Or 750m per hour for a real poverty rorq at 2.5b without excavators. Oh that's right, you can't, because it doesn't exist. Unless you know some exploit, then plz pm me.
---
Nice to see young new alliances getting out there and trying pvp. GG
---
&gt;  If we can truly get the kind of massive fights that EVE is known for without soul-crushing, mod-bugging TiDi, this would be huge for the game.
---
I'm sure everyone would welcome sub-10% tidi becoming a thing of the past. However, I personally can't imagine a fight on that scale without a noticeable amount of tidi (ie 50-25%) given the amount of moving parts in the largest of battles. And I'm just an F1 pusher. The pressure on FCs and coord would be crazy. Furthermore I find the tidi also helps a lot when facing single digit framerates. A server that can handle 10k player battles is cool, but that means we'll need a client that can do the same to a reasonable degree. Making a client handle that kind of scale is probably significantly harder than making a server do it given the differences in hardware and workload (servers don't have to deal with things like draw calls or DX in general).
---
&gt; 360 HOURS of MINING for the costs of injecting
---
^^what i like the most bout your comment. like injecting something is the default state of things
---
&gt; You're aware if more people are not playing PLEX price should lower since demand is lower ?
---
The exact opposite happens. Rising account token costs are a direct indicator of a shortened supply aka less plex sales on the market. If you look at... nefarious... isk places you can see a visible downward trend in the black market price of isk while at the same time PLEX prices are increasing. That is a telltale sign of diminished PLEX sales as a whole given that the primary use of purchasing plex is to liquidate for Isk.
---
Demand drives price but there's no evidence that the demand for PLEX relative to its supply has gone down. Given that black market isk prices are still falling without any new external factors this suggests that there is simply less PLEX available, aka buy orders are filling slower.
---
&gt;If you make them easy to kill, there will be fewer of them around.
---
Good
---
No. You need to use a screen recorder. Set up a hotkey that you can trigger when something interesting happens.
---
You made me upvote globby for explaining economics.
---
I hope you realize what you've done to me.
---
2 dudes and 1 that says poi a lot
---
I didn't read this, I wanted to get my point across though without starting a new thread. If you want to fawn over drone killmails then do you. You're a big part of why content in this subreddit is slowly becoming stale.
---
Just because you have numbers doesn’t mean you’re doing statistics right. Without appropriate context and analysis (like the total number of rorquals that were in use during your given time frame) then numbers become meaningless noise. 
---

I mean that's what it MIGHT be in the future. Right now it's just taking EVE assets and basic functions to test another companies engine in the hopes that if everything goes well they can find a way to potentially integrate it into EVE. 
---
This isn't the first time CCP announced something tech wise that would be amazing, and if they abandon it then that also wont be the first time.
---
No, this is probably a Goonmodbias conspiracy and the whole world is out to get Olmeca 
---
That's just as much British as aussy tbd
---
Initiative breaks away from goons when?
---
And not be shit at it
---
Think about all the production fees /s
---
Wow excellent charts. Thank you a ton. 
---
Is this a question?
---
Great News....but...
---
* 75 Million Speak Native Korean....going to have a localization of EVE 
---
* 95 Million Speak Native German...has a localization of EVE
---
* 125 Million Speak Native Japanese....has a localization of EVE
---
* 166 Million Speak Native Russian....has a localization of EVE
---
* 360 Million Speak Native English....Main language of the game
---
* \+400 Million Speak Native Spanish....Still Waiting for the Localization
---
Spanish is the second most spoken language, why we still don't have a EVE ONLINE localization is beyond me.
---
We wouldn't mind if you took another break from eve and never came back.
---
P.s. those drones are a little over 1b each... so fuck rifter kills on the kb.
---
I think throw stuff at it until it stops working? 
---
As i use them for skill farming too, perhaps? :)
---
Your reply has no value to it. Fuck you.
---
The ship needs replacing and will take x number of hours, where you will not earn any ISK. People do not have more free time to play the game just becuase the are losing ships faster.
---
That’s what I’m wondering. I’m not a tech genius by any stretch but new engines for games usually mean well new games. Maybe it’s a new “game” but they just port everything over? 
---
Nah, it's in the right place (eve onion) and is a fitting tribute from them
---
Yea we know who globby is 
---
Didn’t Init already deploy and get there shit pushed in?
---
God dammit man
---
Why do you keep making me upvote you? This hurts my soul.
---
Lovely work!
---
o7 an old friend from preds squad 
---
Yeah I can see the source. My point is that it's so cringe that it's a bit sad.
---
Each drone is like 900mil. it’s not about killmails it’s about hitting them in the wallet. Winning the “isk war” has been a thing since I started playing 10 years ago.
---
This occurred to me too - it's the inverse of survivorship bias...
---
Thanks.
---
I would watch this
---
Sadly its never going to happen 
---
Thanks bb you are my friend
---
Flew with him for a bit in MV. 
---
May you rest among the stars.
---
Simple... caps became the end all. There's a simple fix to making this game fun again. Limit caps to specific roles. Bring sub-caps back into the picture with clear objectives for fleets to obtain. 
---
This sounds great, but it's biting off a lot of big challenges. It's nice to hear the direction they are looking but until we see real development we'll have to wait and see.
---
It definitely gives me have some hope, fingers crossed they can pull most of this off. 
---
You're going to smartbomb survivability bonuses drones with what exactly, a cruiser with a couple medium smb's that will melt 2 seconds into its first cycle? Also, neut enters local and procurers are in warp with 10s. A rorq is generally stuck for 30-300s before even beginning to align.
---
A sink makes ISK leave the game, not change hands.
---
An alliance buying their members new toys inky shifts the ISK into builders pockets.
---
In other news Scorpion Navy Issues are completely whack broken because only 2 have been killed in the same time frame. This obviously means that Scorpion Navy Issues are virtually unkillable, even when compared to Rorquals or even supers. 
---
&gt;https://youtu.be/Ue-MtvNsbRU?t=47
---
Its hot drop o clock!!
---
We never moved since we always lived here. Idiot.
---
if the farmers are just AFKing it with drone aggro mechanics: put a ship in there that pulls all the aggro so the NPCs don't target the farmer. the farmer's drones won't kill the rats if they never shoot the gila.
---
things that will attract aggro from rats: remote reps, ewar, warp disruptors, being in a battleship (for the BS rats)
---
if the farmer is actually watching or using a bot: lol you can't stop them.
---
The one true solution. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI4TiZD6GLw 
---
The guide I followed but it requires several characters to function efficiently. 
---
This kind of comment is so cancerous.
---
You claim they all pulled drones within 2 seconds of logging in, but your name appears in local way before your game loads and you’re able to d-scan.
---
I hate botting too dude, it’s the bane of my roaming existance but just calling everyone a bot is definately not a productive way to fight the botting menace.
---
This is CCP investigating whether a technology could be useful for Eve.
---
If you were in a safe spot when you closed the client window your ship would have decloaked and warped 1,000,000 km from where you logged off. It then would have sat there decloaked until your aggression timers were gone and then disappeared. The capsuleer aggression timer is 15 minutes and refreshes whenever you shoot or get shot at by a player. It seems very likely that you were not off timer yet which prevented your ship from despawning, so they probed you down and killed you.
---
The safe log feature is the one you want to use when you're logging off in hostile space.
---
Goonfleet already a perfect communist utopia, comrade.
---
Eve 2 with no rorqual and only wormholes &lt;3
---
The c10k problem is fixed.
---
But it's not the c10k problem which is Eve's problem. It's not about 10k connections. Eve can easily manage that. It's about 10k people interacting with each other at the same time. That's significantly more difficult, and hasn't been solved.
---
They could easily fix this by making the rats shoot the ESS.
---
&gt; the game needs a longish period of deflation.
---
looooooool
---
Losing titans is an isk faucet. Yay, insurance.
---
Don't worry about these guys. They haven't seen true overwhelming firepower pointed in their direction.  Once they go for a daytrip in Delve, they'll start changing their tune.
---
Or they will keep complaining that an Alliance centered around the idea of letting novice players NOT simply be prey for wandering monsters has succeeded in organizing new players and their responses to hostiles.  Not sure.
---
"You see, they work with a codeset so deep its hardcoded *inside the computer*! Truly revolutionary, the next step up from blockchain."
---
Yeah they wouldnt say this shit to him at fanfest, hes jacked.
---
What type of cargo ship do I need?
---
Assuming I’m not taking it all the way to jita.
---
Ahh I was wrong! But I do approve of this too :) Slightly easier for me to sneak up to London to see you :D &lt;3 
---
I read that as cracking down on easy ways to make isk to push people to spend more real monies
---
Smells like someone who's afraid of getting his PvE nerfed
---
Wouldn't a barbarian at the gates option work? Where every individual player could declare an individual war against the current largest alliance where the alliance can't help but eventually face the reality that it is facing the fall of empire? Dunno I'm just newbro anon ramblin. 
---
That must've been one hell of a sales pitch by those guys who *coincidentally* ran into that CEO of that large scale space MMO and who has chased after a few hypes in his time.
---
id like to see an increase in the belt spawn distance. most mining ops i see warp down to the refinery to a bookmark that is warpable but still in range of tether when i enter local. thats fine.
---
however when i warp to athanor where i expect the mining op to be after using dscan i often land within 150km and cant warp up to them.
---
if the mining ships are not safe by then they deserve to get tackled however i have to burn or off grid ping to warp to them while in the meantime they gun the athanor and prepare to alpha my cap.
---
its sad...
---
Doubtfully.
---
And then you'll whine about not being able to easily kill something else.
---
Godspeed Cpt. Picard.
---
&gt;  Just ignore them and move along, no one forces you to click on links my friend.
---
I play Eve because my progress doesn't get wiped. It gets only shot and destroyed, but everything has a history.
---
If you open a new server, make it permanent. I would gladly play it, but I hate paying stuff, that gets reset. I'm in for the long haul.
---
Still waiting for the deep learning blockchain.  It's only a matter of time.
---
Yeah, and the best way is to... Fund one more stillborn game.
---
Yeah the Isk war is really the driving force of content now I wonder what the game would look like if it didn't have Killboards or killmarks in it. How much fighting would still be happening if there was no record of anything.
---
I don't really understand what you mean by this
---
The ship costs minerals to create along with industry and market taxes, but once the ship is created the insurance payout is an isk faucet because it does not come from a player. The only ISK sinks in industry are the taxes in market and production, but I don't think they make that sizeable of an impact compared to the insurance payout
---
Also once the ship is being built it's being built passively so you can do whatever kind of activity you want to do, there's no "lost hours" of isk income.  Especially given people building titans for income are going to mostly be doing industry for income anyway, so destroyed titans just means more people they can sell to.
---
They said they’re going to balance capital ships and cut down on isk faucets. Isn’t this good news?
---
Activity - Be active and others will follow
---
Specialize - Pick one thing and do it well, focus on it and stick with it. Do not try and do everything 
---
Avoid "we offer PVE, PVP, industry, Incursions, High low and null sec operations" Unless you have a few thousands people this isn't a possibility pick one
---
Find good people and use them, don't do it all yourself. Delegate
---
I don't hate him.  I miss him when he's not there.  Delve wouldn't be Delve without a Marshy in local.
---

---
So quit complaining and come do something about it? :)
---
Hey Robbie_Gluon_Argh, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
Just filter out the name Excavator so you don't see them
---
This is a contender of worst post of 2019
---
No less than 4 comments in the thread accusing this guy of input broadcasting. Do people not understand what input broadcasting is? You clearly see him tab between the 4 windows and activate his modules. Haters gonna hate, I guess. 
---
As someone who also gets accused of it, people need to understand that folks who multibox have to get incredibly quick at tabbing between accounts and have most things hot keyed. 
---
Maybe these accusers are so dumb that they forget that fleet warp is a thing. I just don’t get it.
---
Dude, dope kills! Don’t let the haters tell you otherwise.
---
Can an alpha use a cloak?
---
Which was also part of the reason to acquire the shiny toys in the first place.  We have all seen our ships explode and thought to ourselves how nice it would be to respond with overwhelming firepower.
---
Some people simply went out and actually made it happen is all.
---
Killboards have been a thing for at least the last 12 years. Being isk positive has always been a thing. It’s not new. Perhaps you’re playing the wrong game. 
---
&gt; Let me open by stating this is not intended as a bait thread. It's not meant to narrative spin
---
...
---
&gt; That argument is literally "We are angry we can't kill you easily."
---
If there’s a delay the sb bs fleet will just warp out 
---
Inversely, just because I don't have all of the numbers doesn't mean that a meaningful evaluation can't be made.
---
That would require him to have friends.  Which would also allow him to join fleets with more than five pilots, which would also solve his problem.
---
But that doesn't tell me how much is stockpiled.
---
Quite a lot leaves the game from players quitting and some leaves from ship attrition.
---
Sure, you could draw that conclusion if you are trying to discredit all data because you don't like them.
---
Does it make it a bait statement if it's a fact?
---
yeah maybe I should just quit thanks
---
So what Relevance would Olmeca have in this game without bots? CCP is biased, toxic maculine and aiming for Olmeca :/
---
&gt;You're a big part of why content in this subreddit is slowly becoming stale
---
I glad I have such an impact. Remember, be the change you want to see.
---
What a fucking asshole.
---
This is one of the reasons Mass Tests are useful for CCP, and why they don't find everything before release.
---
It's *hard* to test at scale. Very very hard.
---
Great. Glad we agree that it could also be a factual statement with out being bait 
---
I heard this story many times but I guarantee it didnt happen on this case cause im watching it.
---
Ah, my TV is only 1080, and is 10 years old or so, so text size is actually too large most of the time. I also am not playing from across the room, which honestly, is the worst way to play games IMO. I prefer to be closer to the screen.
---
IIRC, TV's actually show text size larger from the same distance of a monitor, so assuming you're set up to play games, and not using a family TV or something, you're actually in a better place. 
---
My laptop screen actually has to turn the text size up, while as I said, TV I had to make it a lot smaller.
---
I’m not saying you should quit, just that your expectations don’t line up with the game you’re playing.
---
Yes but you can clearly tell that the amount entering the game increased by orders of magnitude. Assuming roughly normal levels of destruction across that period wouldn't have a big.impact on the overall figure.
---
Be realistic dude the data is clear
---
Hadean horror skins tinfoil hats anyone?
---
I can confirm it looks fine on my end. I'm not on mobile, however.
---
Since you’re trying to measure survivability, it absolutely does matter that you’re missing data. 
---
Survivability is a proportion, not a net value. 
---
According to the other bittervets Eve has been dead since 2003.
---
Hijacking top comment. Cyno vigil 23:00 Friday (03/08 Eve Time) Amamake Keepstar.
---
Even this bastard had his share of friends.
---
It's almost certainly not Delve farming.  I mean there are a shit ton of characters here - more than any other region (except Forge?  I'm not sure about high sec anymore!).  
---
I think plex demand influences flex price, and that is probably to a first approximation a function of how much rl money people are dumping into the game.  When that goes down, plex prices go up.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong - I haven't read an econ article about Eve for years.
---
So you couldn't infer by the sheer volume of losses that they are killable and have a weakness (drones)? You couldn't even posit that? Not remotely? Like absolutely impossible to make that educated guess?
---
Walking in stations and/or server wipe.
---
For instance.
---
It is the traditional solution in Eve. The entire game centers around the idea that, while individuals can accomplish many things, groups working together can accomplish even more.
---
The main thing is that TV's uses Chroma Subsampling at 4:2:2 which causes text and sharp edges to look kinda messed up. It's why recordings of screens never quite look right on youtube. You can read about it if you want but [literally the first 2 pictures on the wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling) get the point across pretty well.
---
Sad to hear. Godspeed. O7
---
&gt;22x 2.2ghz    
---
well the issue is not threads, its the single thread performance of those chips (also AMD Epyc's beat that 8894) 
---
It may not be, but there's an absurd amount of people crying over 1 day alts getting injected into rorqs/supers/titans/whatever as if it's a valid balance issue. And even if you assume you don't inject, is 80 hours reasonable to you to just break even with a 9b ship? A ship which takes almost twice the training of a carrier, produces the same or less isk per hour while costing 9b vs the 3b of a  blinged carrier? A blinged carrier which breaks even at just 20 hours. These days even supers break even at 50 hours of ratting or so if you don't take into account injectors. I agree with you that injecting is not and should not be the default, but both CCP and the community are pushing in that direction.
---
Nah, INIT have already stated krabbing in tribute and vale is shut down.
---
22 billion is a drop in the bucket to most of these multiboxxing equals and I see a post from insertrandomeveshitter69 everytime they get some kills. You people reeee all the time how you want more engaging content and yet fawn over excavator killmails. You cant have both so anyone that reads these type posts especially dev's can conclude that you enjoy the current state of the game.
---
this is an excellent post. gj.
---
But it could also be late stage capitalism by creating a stock market to go along the commodities market we have now, so that one could trade shares in sufficiently large corporations/alliances.
---
&gt;if we want to realize the dream of 10,000+ pilot fleet fights then we need to accept that the current hamsters simply won’t do.
---
This is good but it's also important to remember that **most of the good content comes from &lt;1000 pilot fights, and you need to change the mechanics to make those fights more common and meaningful.**
---
Specifically: right now, in a sovwar, the entire war is decided by 1 titan brawl. Often, one side realizes they'll lose the brawl and just up and leaves. Literally nothing else matters in the war. A better meta would be a long series of dread/carrier brawls, but we can't get there until titans are nerfed to where dreads/carriers are relevant against them. 
---
Until this changes, we're stuck in a meta of having 1 10,000-man fight every 1-2 years. That's really not enough content to keep the game going. 
---
Your numbers for excavators does not include those which were scooped up by booshers, which is  number. We will never know the number but, it is a significant amount with the number of groups doing it universe wide.
---
Epithal
---
At least it’s not blockchain
---
Awesome virginity shield.
---
On the surface it seems the same as the bazzar. And injectors are great for the newbies who joined late and are progressing at a somehow average rate, earning 20 to 200m an hour and injecting when they can afford one. 
---
But ccp underestimated the amount of autism multiboxers and botters can spew. Even for the small guy with 4 rorquals plexing a 5th then injecting it became a few days of mining cost. This created huge inflation of ressources.
---
Ccp should have made it so you cannot inject capital skills and jump drive and industry skills at all. Anything scaling so well basicaly with more accounts would be eventually abused and ruin the economy.
---
&gt; ou see, they work with a codeset so deep its hardcoded inside the computer! 
---
Funny enough, maybe making custom ICs or programming FPGAs is a viable way to go ;)
---
Honestly you sound like the salty one because I'm not licking ops boots for his amazing pvp skills..
---
good thing about this is that in korea you need a uniqu id to access online games so it can be traced back to you if you hack
---
Thanks
---
True. Also did not look at killed wetu units with drones inside.
---
wow if only retards didnt strive for attention because they are shit at the game and make shitty screen shots of an issue that isnt really and issue. Then they go on to provide zero context whatsoever because that would be too hard. Then they remember they are fucking losers but just wait, there is reddit, maybe people will agree with me there Lmao oh fuck maybe just maybe i will have an inkling of human companionship
---
Lmao get fucked globby you basement dwelling loser
---
Vale looked pretty busy last time I went through...
---
I could absolutely posit that they are killable, much like how I could say a brick tank Titan covered in 200 FAXes is killable if you have your own Titan blob 
---
What would be completely wrong to say would be to say this is balanced without the proper context or statistics to back it up. 
---
4$/bill used to be a steal, now it's hard to find anyone who wants to spend money on Eve since the future is so bleak. Rmt is bad, but it's a good indicator of game health. 
---
Oh no we can't. ))))))))))))))
---
Elaborated on the top level comment. Thanks for playing!
---
Interesting take. I need to get the last few Zelda games 
---
To reinforce the small gang thing maybe it could have a built in cyno jammer.
---
Because the high sec entrances are controlled by these pirate groups. Unless you're a big null bloc that will actually defend or scare off anyone from touching your logistics chain. 
---
i dont think you see the whole picture well enough. in the end of the day no one cares how much ISK a single Person invests or mines/makes. The biggest issue for many ppl here is the sheer amount of ore generated, combined with ever present urge to inject and multibox more ore mining capital ships. the whole economy is a mess. minerials, plex, injectors etc
---
implying the alliance tournament is relevant
---
Doesn’t impass do the same thing......
---
If you liked that one, check out the dumb shit in the rest of these responses.
---
It's simple, we kill the Batman
---
"a problem that has been solved for almost as long as Eve has existed."
---
Well shit my man why didn't say anything sooner? I'd let CCP know about this right away if I were you.
---
CCP feature parity is making the game safer for carebears. Old jb if you were tackled you couldn't take the beacon.
---
For those interested in more technical details, there's this pinned post from the Discord   
---
\-

HadeanOS is an internally developed OS. It’s binary compatible with Linux and supports all of POSIX and most of the Linux Syscalls API, however it is internally different from Linux in very fundamental ways. It’s been designed from first principles to be a lot more robust, reliable, and scalable and in addition to POSIX/Linux Syscalls offers Hadean specific syscalls to handle concurrency semantics and IPC (Inter-Process Communications) in a distribution-agnostic manner. As such, a simple 10 line programme can run on a single core on one server, or dynamically scale up to thousands of servers. You still run the exact same source and exact same ELF binary at both scales. The reliability and robustness properties of HadeanOS (going above and beyond Linux, Windows, various Unices etc) ensure that during this scaling to thousands of servers the chance of an edge-case single fault in any single server supporting your programme is minimal — in fact the Hadean guarantee is that such a fault is either a programme bug (which will be discovered early and should be fixed) or due to a hardware fault (which are actually very rare when you eliminate all OS/systems software and framework issues).  
---
As for the transport layer there are various. HadeanOS itself provides a Shared-Nothing concurrency process based concurrency API (via a Spawn(...) Syscall). Communications between Hadean Processes is provided via Channel-based semantics. Channels themselves are internally implemented in various ways. E.g. on a single core or CPU internally the OS may use memcpy while the API semantics look identical (i.e. send/receive via channels). On a multi-CPU system this channel access will happen via QPI communications. In a multi-server case these channel communications will be handled via network - we have two implementations of our own protocol HCP which is significantly more robust and high-performance than TCP particularly when used inside a single datacentre. HadeanOS also offers TCP-based channel implementations that are a level up and have the usual TCP drawbacks but also the TCP advantage of being pretty universal across the internet.
---
Yes, that "idea" is sold to newbies as a source of the passive income, which it is not after all. PI requires time, time to restart processes, time to adjust extractors, time to transfer resources, time to move them to trading hub, time to adjust orders. Multiply this by a number of alts.
---
What I am trying to say here is - Unless you do enjoy doing PI, there are far better ways to earn ISK with Omega alts, especially if you have an access to WH.
---
Remind me 12 days
---
Nice deflection there. Great to see a counter argument boil down to "I don't like the fact you are poking holes in my logic so I will insult your writing ability".
---
Why don't you superimpose the MER index, the Rorqual losses and the uptick in capital\super capital activity, alongside distribution of losses according to coalitions\regions. Also, not being a huge prick, though I think you'd fail the last one.
---
Don't even play anymore, still super sad to hear this every once and a while. My condolences to everyone who knew him!
---
&gt; Starts internet fight with stupid non-analysis

&gt; Tries to shit on dude on the internet claiming "internet fight"

Ladies, please
---
The issue is only how many respawns you get over some time period.  I can't remember but I think you can faction/hauler every 20 or so (something like that - maybe 50 I haven't done it for a while).  Officers... I've never had one. 
---
So using that the thing will be to just make more spawns happen.  That means cycling through belts as you can kill each spawn faster than it takes for a new spawn to show up (20 minutes or similar).
---
Remind me! 12 days
---
Fuck how was it?
---
Gotta fill the lack of eve merch
---
That’s the Indian Way and it’s absolutely terrible for our country....
---
You use sarcasm but that's actually the easiest solution. Over the years IPC (instructions per clock) have increased dramatically. Subsequently we've seen more and more players able to do things on a single reinforced node. CCP has made some software optimizations for sure, but a lot of that gain is just better hardware.
---
Clearly reinforced nodes should be cooled with LN2 and overclocked to the highest attainable clock speed while remaining stable.
---
Hey, I’m using the exact same methodology you are. Two SNIs, totalling 1.492 bil, were killed on March 3rd according to Zkill. 
---
You mean refining skills
---
Yup, sounds like the test went great to me.
---
Well, i certainly hope the will do everything they say. Knowing CCP though, after the changes somehow Rorquals will be even better and Supercap-ratting even more profitable ;)
---
Why isn’t this a thing everywhere???
---
Last time i checked these guys were using completly unfit gilas. I was surprised but it dissuaded me from ganking them.
---
Imagine being this mad about not being able to farm easy kills.
---
o7 Rest in Piece, Etienne. 
---
Going from goons protecting them to init protecting them. More groups should move out of delve, it’s not like there isn’t enough empty space for their 4K members lol
---
If this is just a drop in the bucket then it’s no wonder why people cheer on this sort of activity. Rorqual income is so difficult to challenge under an umbrela, so when someone manages to impact these muliboxers it’s certainly worth cheering, at least in my opinion.
---
Prolonged exposure to spod causes brain damage, we now see it manifesting in this poor chap.
---
Yea, I've been checking the thread periodically. It's amazing what happens when you poke even the tiniest of holes in his argument.
---
Do whatever you want, but don't come crying to me when you get slapped hard for harassing their backbone.
---
Active Armor tanked Myrm should be able to do C2 sites, but I'm not sure if it is worth wasting the time and risking the ship.
---
are they really "in space" when they are invulnerable though
---
Supply goes down; demand goes up; prices go up. I'm okay with that :)
---
astonishing script.
---
we saw how well cloud integration of a part of eve went last time, why not do the whole thing? 
---
Interesting. Imaging Goons shorting PL stock before invading...
---
This is the problem. Even when they (finally) communicate about something, all they do is pay lip service to the things we've already been raging about for months (or even fucking YEARS) with a little blurb like this and say "we'll continue to communicate more with you over the coming months" without ever DOING anything.
---
Twitter and facebook do physics, hit detection, complex damage calculations (that include potentially hundreds of interdependent variables), nearly instant (and basically flawless) session switching between servers?
---
You use a lot of fancy words, but I am not sure you know what you're talking about. You sound like the sales people I deal with who don't shut up about "big data lakes" but don't actually know their ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to software.
---
unrelated: mcav is still recruiting :)
---
This sounds amazing! Eve has come so far as a game. When I first started playing after release there were days that the server barely broke 1000 players. I recall being in Curse Alliance and a fight with Stain Alliance of 200 people in a system would crap the server. I know there is still frustration with TIDI and big fleet battles but this release makes me excited for the future of Eve and what is yet to come! 
---
If there weren't people slapping that backbone constantly even against uneven odds this game would have economically collapsed already through heavy inflation caused by all that people that do not even play the game actively (afk mining or ratting) but want all caterd to them while they do not even pay money to CCP (PLEX Sub depending on other people giving CCP money)
---
selling gom TV passes to all koreans
---
Killing off legacy code for good means they have way more options open to them for pretty much every issue they want to address, including smaller fleet fights. 
---
But, at the end of the day, the huge fights are what put CCP in the news, and what brings a lot of players in or even back to the game. So it's not surprising they are framing the development of this new tech around that, instead of anything else. 
---
This is r/eve.  We are all irrelevant.  If we were relevant, we would be organizing interesting things in New Eden, not just shooting the breeze here on reddit.
---
Jesus christ you are right, fuck supers and rorqs. SNIs are the true thing killing this game! 
---
They’ve “said” a lot of things which is the problem. It’s more words at this point. I don’t blame the guy for being hesitant 
---
Join an alliance. Rise in the ranks. Insult someone's mother, and refuse to apologize.
---
WAR.
---
Be the change you want to see in New Eden.
---
good point
---
I agree this post is low effort, where's u/olmeca_gold when you need him.
---
Pretty much, yeah. I don't encourage RMT or anything but it's a very useful thing to keep tabs on for some market activities. The market cap for Eve in particular has naturally dropped fairly consistently for a good 2 years but it plummeted in the last 3-4 months in particular even when keeping the Christmas / black Friday boom and bust in mind.
---
they say a lot to satisfy investors. always have. little ever came of it. 
---
Good. There is no reason nullsec should be less risky and more profitable for miners. Mining is the dumbest activity in the game it should never offer such rewards.
---
I use a TV because I don't have a desk, plus a desk would just clutter my space up. I can tell you my desktop is beautiful at 4k resolution, so I don't see how an average or cheap 24-27" would produce a better picture than my samsung uhd tv which was only 300 bucks on black friday where as a good monitor is gonna cost double that for half the size, so I guess thats why I opt for the 50 inch uhdtv.
---
The same way we always do, pile in more people.
---
Ahhh old content ring. May whoever gets it install renters and take baths in bhaalgorns
---
o7 Etienne, you will be missed.
---
CCP is a R&amp;D company who happens to also have made the game we all love to hate.
---
It would be interesting if Eve 2 kicked off with a wormhole to a new cluster, but only a single subcapital ship (and whatever is packed in it!) could pass through.  Once through, that character in Eve1 could never enter again, and the site would appear to be collapsed to that character.   The power blocks of New Eden would fight to the death to control who gets to carry their blueprint caches and vital components to gain that initial edge in the sequel, while drifter and Triglavian incursions slowly disintegrate Eve 1's stargate network.
---
Wake up, Spodhumans! 
---
You're going to be missed a lot buddy. I can't believe that you're gone. RIP brother.
---
Protip:  If you fit the epithal with 3 cargo expanders you can fit a command center in the hold to deploy.  Otherwise you need a different hauler that can fit at least 1000m3 (1 command center)
---
AND....Spanish is the 3rd largest World GDP by language.  
---
This is correct. The number of fighters alive in a squad is both a health bar and damage multiplier, but it is not related to the number of entities in space. One squad=one entity, the model of fighters flying around as a group is 100% cosmetic.
---
"Hi yes this is CCP, we need 10k people to test this out to see if it works..." *Waits for 10k people* "Umm... this is CCP we show 40k people online but only 5k showed up... do we really only have 5k left?" 
---
The answer at 9
---
EVE would never survive a reset. Too many people have worked too hard for too long on what they have and would just quit rather than start from scratch.
---
Hosted on Azure... Big fucking RIP.
---
Also do whatever you want but do not come crying when PLEX subbing your PvE-Multibox costs 5 bil ISK per account lol. Because CCP atm constantly showing the middle finger to the people that supplied all the PLEX ingame with their RL cash that al you PvE-Nullsec Pubbies sub your accounts with ... Intrigueing that the number of PLEX sell orders has decreased by nearly 50% since 2015 while PLEX-subbing multiboxes have skyrocketed since Skillfarms &amp; Rorquals ...
---
Goons’ salt, best salt.
---
The buffers are also important. it's got double the cache.
---
Guess their last op is the comp that killed their alliance?
---
Honestly not sure what CCP were thinking when they introduced excavators.  I can only assume they were OK with the balance - putting 4.5 bill out there to get bombed and booshed is quite a risk - and that they wanted cheaper minerals so we'd all plex up for ISK to buy Supers and Titans, which we pretty much have.
---
what's the music you used?
---
I mean I am sure we all think it and I 100% get where your anger is coming from. Good post. 
---
You obviously have no fucking clue. 
---
CCP is a R&amp;D company, who also happens to have struck gaming gold with EVE Online. These projects are what CCP is about and what continue to pay the bills. 
---
97
---
:-(
---
Well, you see, lasers and drones don't consume ammo like other weapons so CCP had to make sure they weren't viable for structure bashes with AOE neuts for lasers, bomb launchers for sentries, and a pds for everything else!    
---
The economy would totally collapse if every Ferox didn't have to keep 30,000 rounds of t1 ammo in its hold!   /sarcasm.
---
Obviously you didnt read the article if you think this is a game...
---
Rip Etienne.  You made Death by Design and DHSJ fun. 
---
&gt; People moan about the state of content in Eve - It's boring, it's dying etc.
---
&gt; However, perhaps consider it may not be the game design that is boring? But the way you are playing it?
---
Yeah yeah, I used to play the game the exact same way for 6 years and in 2016 it magically got boring out of nowhere. Absolutely my fault. Thank you for pointing that out, you can fuck off now.
---
Dissapointed the title wasnt "EVEn more fun with lasers"
---
&gt;I do believe though, that this type of activities will be huge steps in the process of making sure that EVE really is forever.  
---
HOW ABOUT ALLOWING PRIVATE SERVERS FOR OLD VERSIONS

---
TL;DR: man finds numbers on zkill and tries to make assumptions about what those numbers mean, but fails because he's missing data.
---
Asking why the game is dead and moaning about what's killing it are the same things no?
---
If you like stabbers fit one up for max speed. I have one I used to fly around to try and catch ceptors. It had an ancil Shield booster and whatever mods in the lows to help with speed. 
---
I get that, but big fights bring people in, but the small fights are what keep them
---
Vets/bittervets log in for X47 level fights, but then they log out the next day and the other 365 days of the year, the game is pretty vacant
---
Keep up the good work. My wallet continues to grow thanks to you. 
---
CCP is actively removing choice, not adding it. 
---
How does anyone navigate their daily life if they have these kinds of thought. 
---
Oh man 6 years and I just learn this. Thank you.
---
? Ghost training lasted for over a decade. 
---
You can't if you're stressed. But If you're sitting on the side they jump into, scramble them, they can burn back and jump. Just like normal stargates 
---
I hope that cap, rorq balance and all that along with botting and a serious toning down of multiboxing come to be, but like many people I'll believe it when I see it.
---
As far as upgrading the game engine and the tech demo goes, would it not be better to use one of the test servers instead of GDC 2019 ? CCP does have several, of them after all. I don't think you can get enough people trying it out at once just at GDC.
---
Except they let people travel a long distance, are in range of citadel armaments and you cant follow someone through.
---
oh fuck a whole 3 seconds lost
---
PANIC
---
One thing: find active officers and offer generously management roles. Else the corp is afk when youre away.
---
oh oh, don't summon him.

You are a known figure in New Eden. A sworn servant of the Mittani.  An eldritch horror that feeds on nonsense and spews propaganda.

Insult someones mother.  You can start the war you need.

This guy is a koolaid drinking, narrative spitting  Supercarrier-Ratter that drops 10 Corms with a few Supers and a Titan inside the umbrella where he knows he needs not to have any skill ...
---
Do not expect anything from him then very weak strawmen ...
---
I couldn't tell
---
RIP bud. It’s always saddening when a member passes no matter what Corp or alliance they fly with.
---
why did you chose that hill to die on? i mean not that you usually make much sense, but that *fear of loss* argument coming from someone with your background is something even a master debater would steer clear off tbh.    
---
It is. I think his point is that he is hoping that they go beyond saying they will do it, and actually do it.
---
I'm on mobile and it looks fine. Hell, each paragraph is like one to two sentences so it could actually be more wall-ish and be perfectly readable.

The might of the military industrial complex is pathetic.

It's not quite 100km apart, but yeah it's actually a bit worse than a regional gate
---
Elite pvp right there, congrats, you are one step removed from mtu hunters.
---
Did you seriously just tell someone to ‘fix it themselves’
---
Lmfao what on eaeth
---
You dont want them to be nerfed so you claim its not possible when it clearly is possible.
---
Caps, injectors, and cynos are stagnating the game.
---
&gt;Injectors and Rorquals have killed the game's future.
---
So let the game die, but:
---
&gt;If they make caps useless, they lose subs.
---
If the game dies, do they not lose subs?
---
You want to talk numbers, but then you decide the only numbers that actually matter (meaning EFT numbers). You're dumb dude.
---
Vote StainGuy for CSM and watch the world burn.
---
Yeah, but are you really hitting them in the wallet? I live in Delve and I can honestly say--no you aren't. 
---
Also, it's not just about this. You killed some drones and posted about it... "oh boy, I killed expensive drones" so I picked on you, but it is also about the guys who pull implants out the heads of their super cap pilots to lower the isk damage inflicted on them, or when I hear guys in my own alliance on coms talk about how much isk they killed on a fleet roam, rather than the actual fights themselves. 
---
So please do not take my statement as just picking on you. 
---
You're wrong. 
---
There's easily 4-5x as many rorquals mining in Delve or ESO as there are Supers ratting.
---
Hence, we should hope that the loss totals are roughly proportional, or potentially higher as we would like more expensive assets to be even more difficult to kill. 
---
&gt; Also do whatever you want but do not come crying when PLEX subbing your PvE-Multibox costs 5 bil ISK per account lol.
---
I do not plex or multibox.
---
Well, 64bit client and new chat. You are not asking for fixes that matter, are you?

Obvious bait post is still obvious

---
Your data analysis is so dishonest and borderline criminal.  
---
&gt;The numbers seem to indicate that rorquals currently are dying faster in numbers than all supers combined by volume. This would indicate a bit of content.
---
Why would you even say this with a straight face, you have nothing to back up any of what you said. 
---
The rest of your post is you put up strawman one after the other and expertly knocking them down with stats that are totally irrelevant.
---
&gt;A lot of the anger is from the portion of the community that wants to roam around with four or five friends and be able to achieve as much as they did years ago. That isn't going to happen. The lethality of roaming ships has gone up with experience, modules and abyssal mutaplasmids making ships very very dangerous very quickly.
---
How do you manage to contradict yourself in 2 sentences adjacent to one another is actually mind-blowing. 
---
&gt;If you remove all of these things, they would still drop 5 or 10 to one with the next best hammer. Whatever that is. The argument would go from cap blob to battleship blob.
---
The fact that you don't understand this distinction says volume about your total lack of experience in this domain, you are way out of depth. 
---
&gt;Here is an educated guess. If you alter the rorqual to the point that 5 or 10 small ships can kill it easily and quickly, you won't find them out there anymore. When was the last time you went roaming or deployed a fleet to go hunt a few exhumers? When was the last time you watched a really cool video of bombers bar or whoever drop 150 bombers on a Skiff or a pair of Hulks? Because that's all you would have left for content if you reduce the viability and survival on something with such a high individual recoup cost.
---
Muh narrative, mfw you started this post acting like you didnt have an agenda, fuck off. 
---
You misunderstand even the most basic of points, you're trying so hard to look smart its actually painful. 
---
You can prefer all you want, I don't care if they were trillion dollar drones. First of all, I just came back and half ass shit and have over 40 billion in my wallet. 1 bill isk drones are really nothing at all. Second, they aren't piloted. They are fucking drones. 
---
So good job peope! You killed a pilotless drone! I am going to start making posts every time I kill a flight of tech 2 fighters, because those are more expensive than a rifter too! 
---
Large parts of the alliances and blocks in Nullsec do, cmon everybody knows that Imperium and Legacy even have programs for newbros quickly injecting them into multiple Rorqus
---
You would be suprised. Apparently some of them get it together enough to go out and get a job or apply here. I run into them often enough in work. Sad.

I do not have data to show how many are in space. You may be right.

Please wait until I've got Doomsday V and Doomsday Rapid Firing V before you start another war.  Thanks.

it reminds me when i played with 2 friends star wars imperial march with  coercers took 5 hours to learn it
---
Your data ANALYSIS. I see comprehension is not one of your strong suits. 
---
Did you ever fly a rorq, or fight against one?
---
You are entitled to your opinion.
---
People would absolutely lose their shit if you tried it for the western market. Blizzard already gets crap for making you submit photo ID matching your credit card to resolve billing/2FA situations.
---
SNI BR/AAR when? It's more rare than Titan/Super deaths, surely it'll get lots of upvotes on reddit for being such a rare ship kill.
---
Yeah that sounds much better actually. 
---
I didn't see him poking hole in my logic? Also, I welcome you to present the data you are asking for. It might be useful. Lastly, I can't make promises about offending snowflakes that don't like numbers.
---
You could indeed.
---
&gt; So you couldn't infer by the sheer volume of losses that they are killable and have a weakness (drones)?
---
Nobody is saying that they are not killable and that they don't have a weakness. People are saying they are still too strong, even accounting for what you stated.
---
As far as I know they are totally unrelated to each other.
---
Olmecagold is an incel.

Wouldn't you just be able to make an account through the western portal and choose Korean from the dropdown menu in the launcher, like you can with all the other languages? There's already sizable korean (and chinese) groups playing without having their IDs in.

why does everything evolve around goons for so many players? guess what, there are other people playing this game.

injectors have to go or at least capped. how about removing damage caps and adding injector caps?
---
goons are at the same advantage as everyone else and i doubt they will get to the point there are at right now.
---
It was fun, and for years lead to new peak concurrent characters 
---
You missed the point, null is risky, but the risk needs to be worth the reward. Otherwise everyone would just mine hi sec. And orca/hulk mining a moon in sec is pretty profitable. And yes we should have this content because people enjoy it.

at times. pretty much did everything everywhere. kinda enables you to put things into perspective. you should try it.

---
Here are some rough numbers for you to get an idea of the success rate: 
---
- In the last 12 months, we've killed 24 Rorquals
---
- We run two fleets a week, until January 2019 both were whaling comps i.e. compositions of subcaps specifically chosen and fit for synergy in killing capital ships as quickly as possible, principally Bhaalgorn + Nestor before Triglavian ships were introduced, then Leshak + Nestor afterwards.
---
- I'm going to err on the low side, and say we catch 1 Rorqual per fleet, over 2-3Here are some rough numbers for you to get an idea of the success rate: 
---
- __In the last 12 months, we've killed 24 Rorquals__
---
- Erring on the low side, we catch 1 Rorqual per fleet, being 2-3 hours of rolling statics, scouting, then tackling something or re-rolling.
---
- We run two fleets a week. Until January 2019 both were whaling fleets composed of subcaps specifically setup for killing capital ships as quickly as possible.
---
- That means, conservatively, that __we have tried to kill 84 Rorquals over the same time.__
---
- Of these successfully killed Rorquals, only 5 have been killed under a big bloc super-umbrella, one TEST, one BRAVE, and three GSF (same owner, fit like this https://zkillboard.com/kill/70130125/)
---
- 15 were fit with PANIC, and 11 saved their excavator drones in a wetu.
---
So we've got a __successful kill rate of 29%__. Of which, about 1/2(46%) saved most of the value in their wetu, and over a 1/3 (38%) didn't have a PANIC.
---
To ward off earlier arguments of not making credible attempts 'Why can't I and my 4 buddies kill a capital' strawman:
---
- Our whaling fleets were principally Bhaalgorn + Nestor before Triglavian ships were introduced, then Leshak + Nestor afterwards. 
---
- For a fleet of 30 characters:
---
 - Bhaalgorn core: &gt;1250cap/s neuting power, &gt;15,000 dps.
---
 - Leshak core: &gt;500cap/s neuting power, &gt;25,000 dps.
---
 hours of rolling a new static, scouting, then tackling or re-rolling.
---
What's wrong with that system?  Why is osmon better?
---
All the numbers and rational arguments will never convince the alarmists because their motivation is jealousy. 
---
Why someone is getting gold that is obviously missing the topic because he just wanted to look smart on something he did not fully understand ?
---
Holy crap that was an awesome read!  Thanks for sharing!
---
If it's just TEST that's a rip. Based on the stories of people who left brave to join TEST and came back cus they hated it, it doesn't sound like it'd be worth it to spend the recoup time over there.
---
If you did include those numbers, you could be looking at possible 5-10x the loss in excavators due to booshes not showing. Another way to calculate it(although a little less unreliably) is to check market volumes getting bought/sold. 
---
TBH, stay in Brave if you do not take yourself too serious and just want to have fun ... 
---
&gt;Yeah, but how on earth do you plan to take that much isk out of the economy without making it impossible for new players to get a foot into the door?
---
That part is actually relatively simple. Concentrate on the high, instead of the low end ISK faucets, and concentrate on the high, instead of low end assets loss (assets meaning ships, citadels, etc.). The 1st things that would need to be addressed are cap insurance and asset safety, then bring down ISK faucets so that they are closer to each other and the gap between the low and high ones is not as extreme as now.
---
For minerals, either drastically increase cap/super mineral production costs, or nerf mining yields or both. If they go too low, they may need to be adjusted back up a bit, but obviously not to the current levels.
---
Top kek.
---
that's exactly the problem: you make a special case where you fit a t1 battleship SPECIFICALLY to counter frigates. i have no problem with that as that domi will eat shit to a t1 BS. fitting compromises is what i am getting at. you don't have to make any with carrier, it can hit that bs just as hard as a frigate without having to make a sacrifice fitting wise. 
---
you cannot get a domi to be as much of a frigate killer without also sacrificing engageability against other ships.
---
the ones that want "free kills" are the ones that drop carriers on solo frigs/cruisers and press 3 buttons.
---
Wardecs have recently been changed, and appear to be undergoing additional passes and tweaks.

Corps must now own a structure to be eligible for war declarations, both as aggressors and defenders.  Defenders can now force an end to a war, or even force a war to continue, should they have the pilots necessary.  Mutual wars can still be declared.  Wars without kills for a certain period of time expire.
---
My guess from their specs and pr copy is that the biggest gains from this are offloading work from a 1 server = 1 system perspective to a 1 server/cpu = 1 grid. They can’t solve needing to broadcast 2000 ships and their actions on a single grid with this, you can’t occlude data in that situation, but it might alleviate tidi by allowing them to at least beef up 1 grid rather than having 1 server do all the work for the entire “simulation”
---
congrats nice job
---
Unbelievable amount of goon salt itt
---
A delay, or wormhole rules, for local chat would be nice.  People can still talk to each other in local if they really want, so we can all still enjoy scammers begging for ISK in Jita, but we will not all have instant information, either hunting, or potentially being hunted.
---
I'd read this novel!
---
It's both, isn't it? The issue is that the ship is balanced for cap warfare, making it totally imbalanced for subcap warfare. I totally agree that nerfing local reps makes sense - you're never really repping in cap fights; you're relying on buffer + CEHE. Local reps are only used in WHs and vs. subcaps. 
---
Regrettably, a lot of the changes that might balance caps for subcap fights will break them for WHs and I don't have a good solution for that.

I've found that T1 comps are often more fun because the FCs aren't afraid to lose them. Not say I haven't seen great fights in hac comps and what not, but it seems like the funnier unpredictable things happen when we're flying garbage.
---
Like the carrier we killed with 30 T1 fit punishers.
---
&gt; Post nerf, no.
---
I've been doing my best. But being turbopoor sucks. 
---
The data in itself means nothing. The numbers in themselves mean nothing. But you use those number to fuel your argumentation.
---
Lest you include all the numbers to get a bigger picture such as the number of Rorquals dropped but not killed, or the number of hours Rorquals are mining, or the amount of ships killed by Rorquals mining, then you're only painting part of the picture.
---
The hypocrisy people are pointing at, and rightfully so, is that I could take those name numbers and make them tell a different story.
---
You just told yours.
---
This either works and large-scale battles are saved or it doesn't and EVE has no TiDi/DC solution for the foreseeable future.
---
Pretty badass, good job!
---
taking away something you have to work for is not a badge of honor - if it's intented that way, it's just horrible game design. especially if you can have the same game effect by pulling stupid stunts as well. but if you choose to view it like that, you do you :P
---
The follow up question is how many of each of those language demographics are open to a PC based MMO?
---
Korea is easy, Starcraft is huge and PC only, pivoting from that to Eve is technologically easy.
---
Japanese isn't. They're typically wary of outsiders and tend to be more console oriented for games (last I heard).
---
Spanish, I can't think of too many spanish speaking countries where it's economically viable for them to buy a computer and a monthly sub to a game. Even then how many of them speak a second language already?
---
I'm happy they are addressing all this.

---
Yeah, but there was little they could do from a business perspective once they first shat them out. No matter how broken and unbalanced supers and caps were or are, they naturally became CCPs top moneymaker and progression driver. 
---
Since their introduction there wasn´t a right way to deal with them. Either nerf them to bring them in line and risk cutting into your profits. Or keep them in an always meandering OP state while risking the overall balance of the game world. The concept was inherently flawed from the beginning. 
---
Yea i have been in several. It's a strange experience because on the one hand it is extremely frustrating and boring, but on the other it is a massive fight and kinda exciting.
---
Mainly the first one though lol

Imagine being so devoted to being wrong even Dave makes a good point and you still whiff on it

RemindMe! 12 Days "GDC"
---
I hope so too.
---
I do want them nerfed. I'm just realistic when I say the damage has already been done. Nerfing now doesn't fix it because it should never have been buffed.
---
It's like saying you can roll back Hiroshima with one stroke. It will take a _long_ time for the well overdue nerf to even start having an impact and even then the entrenched positions of Goons and Legacy are almost implacable once you take away the ability to quickly build stuff (not saying they aren't _NOW_ but if only they have throwaway supers as opposed to everyone having throwaway supers it just makes the issue worse).

they said they're going to remove named module tiers and make them variants instead 
---
they said they're going to expand fob and sotiyo mechanics for all pirates
---
they said they're going to constantly iterate on (pi, wormholes, pve, ship balance, contract system, insert literally everything else here) 
---
some of these things they said a long, long time ago 
---
Came here to post this, doing it anyways.

&gt;After a super-productive summit with the CSM, we’re also developing plans to address key community concerns including capital balance (and balance in general), wealth distribution, war declarations and the abundance of ISK faucets in New Eden. We will of course also be continuing the never-ending war on botting and RMT and are currently in the process of setting up a sizable internal taskforce to look at botting in more depth. 
---
See that is why I do not like the current Multibox-PvE Meta, as it makes good people feel left behind if they are new, and other people feel kicked in their balls for devalueing their 10 (12atm) years of loyalty shown with monthly cash subscriptions. 
---
I’ll go more in depth with why I said that, as to actually argue my point. 
---
There are 3, maybe 4 types of Eve players. The ones that have been playing for years, since the beginning of the game (2003-2006), people that have been playing for years, but aren’t quite part of that core group (2006-2012), those that started and ultimately phase in and out (2012-2015), and the slaves and canon fodder, and almost never stay with the game (2015-present). 
---
I love Eve, and the concept of it. The gameplay is unmatched by any other game. In fact when I quit Eve, I set out on a mission to find a game with similar mechanics, but was just starting up, understanding that in games like those, the earlier you start, the better you are. 
---
The vets do not understand how it is for a newish player just starting out in new eden these days, where the meta has its own meta. I’m not a wimp, as I stuck with the game for a few years, but I realized that I was never going to go anywhere within that world without having had years of building alts, establishing who was actually who, and being in that inner circle, which had been established since I was in high school (and I’m not young anymore). 
---
I am not downing what the game has become, because this game has done what others have tried and failed to do, establish an actual community of gamers, I am merely stating that it is unsustainable in its current form. 
---
Because of the establishment within new eden, the learning curve for a new player is daunting, and just when you think you’ve figured out the mechanics, then there’s the meta, which even after 4 years, I couldn’t even begin to grasp no matter how long I spent reading articles, studying Eve politics, and spending hours researching toons. 
---
I didn’t want to study that, I wanted to be a part of it. If there was a wipe (not a new server with a legacy server), it would allow for growth within the game for everyone. All alt toons gone, and a cap on alt toons (sorry to those vets that have 50+ toons). 
---
I get that the vets that have been building their empires for years would be salty about it, but how is it fun for you anymore? 
---
I will say what people have been saying for years, this game is dying, slowly, but the writing is on the walls. The only thing that would get me to come back, and I’d gander to say a lot of ex Eve players, is a reset. 
---
please do mate, that would be great
---
Hardcore English haha 
---
"I would say something positive, but instead i'll just be an insufferable negative prick"
---
security status is equivalent to those "your speed is: xxKPH" signs on the sides of roads. You're supposed to get the number displayed on the sign as high as possible.
---
Eh, i would say they're about the same honestly, lets stop pretending any of the established groups give a fuck that anybody in their alliance bots and that its not extremely rampant at the minute.
---
The [frigate yearbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12w6WhG1qaWJHwQoxJ5p812mtdctUJhrD/view) is an amazing resource. It give you info on every frigate, their most common fittings, most common tactics and how well they stack up against the other ships. 
---
I'd recommend taking look at that and find a ship that suits you and buying and fitting a dozen of them in a staging system. Then sit in novice plexes in enemy systems at your optimal from the warp-in beacon. Spam d-scan to see what's out there. Check the ship on short from the plex out in the yearbook and decide if it's a fight you want to take or not, and what you need to do if you decide to fight. Check out the players in system on zkill and try to figure out which ships they're in and how they might be fit. If you don't get a fight in the 10 minutes it takes to capture a novice plex at least you've earned enough to pay for your ship. 
---
At first you'll lose a *lot*. You'll likely lose fights you should have in theory won. But you'll learn with each loss, start making fewer mistakes, start understanding exactly what you need to do to win in different situations, when a seemingly "fair" 1v1 is really bait for a gang, who the different natives in the area are and how they play etc. Pretty soon you'll be winning more often than not. 
---
Beyond that you should probably join one of the larger alliances in your faction. None of the FW alliances are very big by nullsec standards. The corporation/alliance will provide you with support ranging from free ships, jump freighter services, LP buyback programs (converting your LP to ISK), guidance and advice from more experienced players and access to fleets. Most active alliances will have occasional public fleets you can join as a member of the faction's NPC corp so you may have the chance to get on comms and fly with them before joining to see if it's a good fit for you/them.
---
I did say something positive though. It was the first part :)
---
The point I was making is that this test does not seem to do any heavy simulation work so regardless if they claim 1k entities connected or 10k entities connected its not anything that eve is not already doing.
---
Saying we want to test the engine with 10000 players and that its important for eves future kinda requires you to substantiate what/why/how what you are doing is different. The videos on their site show a VERY limited simulation, hence why I compared it to a c10k problem.

Wow that is cheap! but that's not an upgrade, that's a downgrade for me because I don't have a desk, so i really wouldn't be able to see anything considering the distance I sit from my TV and the fact that that monitor is half the size of my tv. It's not 4k either =(
---
If at any point they aggressed you at the bubble, you would've had a PVP logoff timer, which would prevent the normal removal of your ship from space for fifteen minutes or so.  The best way to approach that in the future (i.e. logging off until hostiles dissipate) would be to safe up, cloak, and wait for any logoff timers to expire.  Once that's done, decloak and initiate a safe-logoff and continue to watch directional scan until that timer completes.
---
Pretty sure that they are there to break bots.
---
you guys preform?
---
I guess the master baiters pulled one off on me.
---
I like how you always get downvoted when you state simple economic facts ....

There is more coming. Guard leaving deserves more than one article from EVE Onion.

What, you don't like farms and fields? JUST ADAPT! Seed dreads, recruit more players, get more friends. God.

lmao the irony of snuff making this post
---
Odd question, but do you actually have cap boosters loaded into the MASB before you activate it?  If it's empty, each cycle will drain a huge amount of your cap per cycle (60%, I think).
---
tbh i didnt' even login for big fights after a certain point
---
way too tedious, 200v200 or similarly sized were way more fun
---
No problem, there's also a really good film about The [Battle of Myeongnyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Myeongnyang) called The Admiral (2014) which I highly reccomend - it does a much better job at portraying battles than Hollywood does and even though the actual battle lasts around half the film it keeps you really gripped throughout! 
---
There are niche areas where armor/shield reps work effectively.  The Breacher here, as well as the Caldari Navy Hookbill, are two ships that can work this way.
---
The only good thing to come out of SWTOR was the UI editor.  It's a magnificent and genius piece of work from a god of UI design.
---
CCP Devs need to go play SWTOR for a month and use the UI editor to set up things just how they want them, and then copy exactly that system or hire the guy who made it.
---
I've never had a UI so satisfying and customize-able to my likes and dislikes as the SWTOR one.
---
falcon. you don't want to have that kind of conversation with me. 
---
first: i'm more suited to team tech. 
---
second: i've told them i'll never pass a background check. i'll never work for ccp and that's _independent of my thoughts about ccp_. 
---
i love that your response is the ccp job portal. how many of the former community team did ccp straight up fire? 
---
that you have no colleagues in your section fucking sucks but ccp could resolve that if they wanted to. this is a business problem, one i cannot fix.
---
last year during the last (ever, lol) AT it was just you and guard. you guys made this decision to frag staffing in _20-fucking-17_, and now your bus factor is fucked because guard is pursuing other opportunities.
---
I don't think so, though. It's literally called an Industrial Command Ship. Why are they jack of all trades master of all?
---
Because they are by far the largest group in the game so would logically have the most members rejoin. 
---
No matter what your opinion of them is they have the best infrastructure out of game of any group in the game and it’s not even close. 
---
On an established server they are already out mining every other region at an enormous pace, have more income by a wide margin, more industry by a ton, have one of the largest trade hubs in the game and the largest one outside high sec.... 
---
The advantages they would have over every other group in the game would be insane. If you really can’t see how they would begin to take off before any other group could I really don’t know what to say. 
---
im here if you need to talk. 
---
Enjoyed fighting him and DHSJ with DT, very sad. o7
---
Just some basic tips'n'hints:
---
* Start with Frigates, cheap, yet effective and great way to learn the ropes
---
* Do Novice plexes, they are gated and only T1/Faction frigates are allowed to jump, so you will be facing more or less equal force. You will still most likely lose 95% of fights, but you would at least see your foes bleeding
---
* Try to stay close to home system, so that you don't wast much time jumping
---
* Set a d-scan to 0.1 AU. This way you would see if someone jumps to your plex. Once you see someone on a dscan, you would have plenty of time until they jump to you. Plenty of time = you can easily recall drones and align to safe, then as you see someone actually warping to you it's your choice whether you want to take a fight or bail out.
---
* Defensive plexes suck from all standpoints, so look for the systems held by enemy faction.
---

Total Destroyed:
---
70,525,544,284.14
---
Platinum insurance:	2,577,135,616.00
---
Even factoring in the insurance and picking all the loot up after, the death of this titan reduced the isk in the game by 68Bill.
---
If the Alliance handles this all in house, the net worth of the alliance is down 68bill.  If the alliance uses there own minerals, there mineral stock pile is down 68 bill.
---
losing a Titan is a isk sink. 68 bill is gone.
---
Mostly playing the game - I've found that taking off my 'END IS NIGH' sandwich board before sessions helps to maximise my enjoyment quotient.
---
You must have missed the part where they were bought out completely by PearlAbyss.   
---
There is only 1 investor now. 
---
This would be great if even half what you posted was about CCP was accurate.
---
All good though.
---
TL;DR: This won't need a client rebuild.
---
This is a server OS that CCP could run their application on with minimal re-writing to make work.
---
Glassdoor is about as accurate as a plumber's estimate when it comes to reviewing most companies.
---
&gt; You do realize that your customer service tactics leave much to be desired, right?
---
 Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
You know what makes me feel left behind? When a gang comes through and pops my procurer because they are mad they couldn't get the rorq. 
---
This is the reason why i do not sympathise with said gangs getting turbodunked by caps. Because when they come in they turbodunk me relatively while i'm just trying to scrape by.
---
For someone who can afford to fly rorqs and has been flying them for a while they are so rich that it doesn't matter much if its destroyed. But when they come dunk my VNI or my barge i can't just drop another one on field while still going out and fighting or doing other things that i enjoy doing. I have to go back to krabbing as a job to replace the VNI they dunked for their content. Then instead of being on field in a Hurricane fighting their gang i'm hiding in dock because i can't afford another loss.
---
And i don't even plex my account, i can't even imagine how awful this cycle must be for the people who also want to pay their sub with isk on top of all this.
---
but who's gonna rent me c6's then?
---
RMT prices also have a lot to do with CCP enforcement. If CCP concentrates on the buyer side -- issuing negwallets and temp bans to RMT buyers -- the "hazard discount" will rise and RMT isk will be very cheap. If they concentrate on banning bots and deleting RMTer accounts, the supply dries up and RMTers charge more for their limited stocks. There were a couple times after big banwaves that RMT isk was nearly as expensive as PLEX isk.
---
I think that CCP spent most of their effort the past few years on the buyer side. It is **way** better for their bottom line. Activity doesn't drop and the buyers get a big hint that they should give CCP money if they want to pay for that shiny titan. Downside, ignoring bots for this long produces player revolt.

RemindME! 12 Days “GDC Time”
---
Coming from my background, eh? It's not like what me and mine do or don't do has any bearing on those against us in this regard. We can both independently be afraid of loss without any traction lost here.
---
I think initially they really were super krabby - hiding any time someone was in their constellation etc. 
---
Seems like they left that behind a bit though.
---
you are really really dumb
---
okay.
---
blank slate. i hate no idea what i'm talking about. 
---
why is the ccp community team just you and guard, soon to be just you? why has it been this way for the better part of two years?
---
god i hope you guys are interviewing some candidates, if only for your personal sake.
---
After all the fights, an arguing, and discussions, it really comes down to this. We are all just people who have found somewhere we enjoy, with other people who do as well, and that's what makes this game amazing; all the cool people we befriend. Sorry for your loss bud.
---
Thats olmeca's job
---
I mean, I was one of the most prolific covops hunters of my day and quit that style a long time ago because it was just too easy after a point
---
After you work out the optimal strategy the bottleneck becomes a simple problem of fuel and cap booster logistics
---
After you work out the deep space logistics problems, the bottleneck becomes active targets
---
You kill everything in space a few times over a few weeks and pretty soon there isn't anything in space
---
Then and now the gankers enjoy pretty much all the advantages, there's no impetus to act, there's no commitment when opting to act, for the ganker alone it's consensual PVP with one-sided risk and it's just hilarious to see the bar keep getting lower and the bitch-made casual gankers adjust their expectations for how easy it should be to grief entire groups out of space every time and keep pouting harder that it's not being served to them on a silver platter
---
The real challenge for the longest time truly has been on the other side, solving problems like how to escalate a defense for the guy tackled, having a panic attack, mining 2 mids out who lit his cyno in the wrong fleet, is inhibbed, and got into that situation because that's how long it took to find a set of interpreters to translate from his native language to a common third language that a second interpreter can interpret the language of the defense fleet :P
---
As long as you're too casual to bother to win from a position that enjoys every advantage CCP is never going to be able to lower the bar enough for you
---
Imagine having stage 4 spodbrain
---
OP is so stupid even I felt forced to comment. smh.
---
Mix of both, we have set times for fleets, and ping for stuff inbetween. The scheduled fleets (even if no content found) work really well for our guys to plan around. It's much easier to set some time aside to play if you don't have much to spare, when there's an established time you know there'll be people to fly with.
---
Totally understand you, but if the Meta wasn't that fucked up these people normally would not mind killing a Proc when they can kill a Rorq. And if you try to go roaming (log in after work with your dudes, grab a Ship and just take a 60 jump route through nullsec), what was the main part of PvP once, in 9 of 10 cases you get Caps &amp; Supers dropped on some Cruisers or even Frigs and you wont find anything except panicked Rorquals with Cyno already up or people docked up or under POS FF, as either their Intel Bot (NEAR2) has alarmed them of neuts 3 jumps out while watching Netflix or the ratting bot itself warped safe.
---
I can tell you there were days once, when PVPers did not even notice people like you, as some ceptors hero tackled a Carrier in an Anom and you literally waited for a response fleet as you are not out for easy ganks, you wanted fights. Or bubbling a Station undock wit 20 rutures in a system with 50 people online ... all that is basically gone so people resort to the afk miner /ratter that has no bot running to save him, sad as it is ...
---
from aetherengine.io: "HadeanOS is only a few thousands of lines of code."
---
yeah right. April 1st came early this year? Also: their websites need bigger fonts
---
I was always fond of making asset safety require a rig or module on the citadel - one with some form of recurring cost or high upfront cost that also reduces the time between armor / hull vulnerability. If your assets are basically impervious then the citadel should die a lot easier and hurt more to lose.
---
Same tbh.
---
Because most Jumpgates are located on Fortizars and proliferated structures, engaging upon them is already taking a risk and benefits the defenders. They don't need the added safety.
---
I suppose you're right. We need a spodbrain vaccine.
---
You might be right, but I think part of the issue for me is that, while the grindy parts of eve are always going to be grindy, if I were grinding for isk to plex, the entire amount of time I spent making that isk *until* I hit the point I could afford to plex an account would *feel* like actual work. 
---
And Eve for me is my distraction from things like *actually working.* My labor is already alienated, I choose to not have my investment in leisure activities be alienated as well. 
---
Maybe if being an eve trillionare was super important to me, or if I just could not afford to pay my yearly subs, I would feel differently. 
---
Nicely done!
---
Yea that's the other angle
---
Unless you're personally a titan pilot you don't matter anyway
---
and tbh it's like 90% chance of a standdown op (because the titan fleets are too expensive to risk unless you're pretty sure of winning, and it's very rare that both sides think they have a good chance at the win)
---
so basically you burn a sick day to spend 9h hunched in front of a computer and get a back ache but no fight. 
---
Lots
---
What “truce” lmao 
---
Wow -- I flew with Etienne in SEPR in 2012-2014
---
o7 man
---
oh yeah totally. People join the game in the hopes of being part of the alliance tournament. People loved it so much, i saw it on so many ads
---
Again, fucking tired of this
---
TIL 2006 eve player can still learn new things
---
Meh most of the time people's alts are in alt corps, like if you multi box in a NSPI fleet people will known and most of the time it doesn't really matter because you have the alts for game mechanic reasons not for spying reasons. 
---
&gt; Honestly, I don't see any reason why a smart rorqual pilot would die.
---
I don't see why a smart rorqual *should* die.
---
The one where NC. blued Horde after dunking the shit out of them with supers for a while?
---
Yeah.
---
I’m not calling everyone a bot. I roam delve on a daily basis. I’ve had plenty of discussions in local where I call out names specifically and the blues just respond “yeah we know 😂”. 
---
the botting epidemic is a problem everywhere. Unfortunate Delve and FRT space contain a disproportionate number of them. 
---
If you remove/reduce damage caps the “big blobs” will just drop more dreads than you.
---
They have the advantage. They have more people, more ships that do more dps, established infrastructure.
---
But why are you entitled to a free pass against them?
---
even the wormholers are botting now, smh
---
Who wants to be in a fleet with 10k people cripes...
---
bad bot
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.74221% sure that koishe is not a bot.

It looks like that site's dev had this sort of feature/functionality on the backburner, but nothing's really changed in the past year.
---
I have a spreadsheet that does stuff like this for me (just used it for Naglfar production last night), and I've been considering making a tool for something like this as well, but building straight from reprocessed compressed ores always seemed like a niche thing (I don't know anyone else in my corp/alliance who does this other than myself).
---
At its heart, this is just a linear programming problem, where you're trying to minimize cost while still meeting minimum mineral needs.
---
That sounds good in theory, but what worries me is they seem to be stressing this is just a tech demo, has already been in dev for 1 year and isn't really planned to actually touch EVE at this point.  It potentially seems like a ton of money and time wasted into something that will not see the light of day for 5+ years, if ever.  With CCP's track record, its impossible to get excited for something potential that's that far off.
---
Coming from the person that say a country who has a history of creating gaming in itself. A country of electronics who doesn’t use personal computers to game with. A country with the highest gamers per population doesn’t game on PC. A person that says this has the audacity calls me dumb. Your statement has the same weight as your false claim of Japanese PC gamers. Who are you? Obviously you’re not Japanese nor do you have the slightest understanding of Japan. You’re not big on research and lack knowledge of what surrounds you. I would guess that you’re a professional excavator but that’s an insult to the actual profession in itself. So again, who are you? 
---
sure. as long as you don´t use the argument in a unilateral manner. which you clearly did earlier on.  
---
How many died is totally irrelevant value.
---
Question is how many are undocked and printing caps per second all day every day, building piles or replaceable ships that guarantee limitless supply of those hulls to pilots across the large blocks.
---
The community team isn't just me and Guard. It's me, Guard, Ruffige and Dopamine - your assumptions about our team structure are fundementally wrong.
---
It was two of us for around three months. Just because not everyone is super visible, it doesn't mean that we're not actively working.
---
As for candidates, it's a requirement for us to all be interviewing prospective candidates.
---
Not dead yet, but stats for average online players are indeed worrying for this time of the year.

Awesome art!

Oh, this is the part of history that panfam isn't allowed to talk anymore?

When Horde was rewarded for entosising the north, with a hostile super capital umbrella over their space.
---
*screams in Rorqual*
---
This was my first thought as well
---
I don't think they can, because it sounds like this tech demo isn't actually part of CCP or EVE in any way.  It's basically using CCP's art assets in another company's engine, so I'm not sure what they're actually going to accomplish for EVE itself.
---

I guess "smart" in this case is relative. It doesn't take a master pilot to press the cyno button when someone shows up on grid.
---
I guess the idea that an industrial ship is more survivable than even the strongest military ships is a little silly.
---
Nowadays, a lot of people are finding fun in special interest groups and deployments, at least in the large alliances.  
---
We're in a period of relative peace for a lot of EVE so a lot of combat is currently smaller in scale but still fun and tactical.   
---
This may change with the 64 bit client on the horizon as once they've worked through the main bugs, it should make large fleet fights more enjoyable so they may become more prevalent (it's generally not a good idea doing too many tidi fights as they have a high player burnout). 
---
Just like their engine for WoD that they were trying to parade as a tech demo, but failed hard because the performance was so bad it was worthless for any real applications.
---
From what I'm guessing, we help out with this test, and see if it'll do the job that CCP needs it to do. If it goes well, then CCP and Hadean enter into further talks about figuring out how to shuffle over EVE onto Hadean's new engine. (probably?)
---
That's gonna take a LONG time, which is a great thing because it means CCP is taking this seriously with a long term vision of EVE and committing to such a huge undertaking. 
---
Do you think he got storyteam to write this one for him too?

Before coming back I had heard about the "grr goons" movement, but it is really amazing to see... if goons say something like, "this is not really a big deal" it is salt, while when people say similar things about goons, they are right and the goons are still somehow just being salty. 
---
This is of course in conjunction with: 
---
1. Goons cheat;
---
2. Goons are ruining the game;
---
3. Goons are conspiring about "insert whatever here;"
---
4. Goons and CCP cheat together;
---
5. Goons and r/eve moderation cheat posters;
---
6. Goons are terrible; 
---
7. etc., etc., etc.,;

See that wasn't my experience. Back in 2013 when i joined and joined brave (i tried eve in 2008, didn't stick probably because i didn't join a corp) my experience was eternal wardecs and people hunting you 24/7. Just trying to learn how to play the game was hampered by one person coming into my hisec system and then suddenly 20 more come in to come kill my vexor.
---
I ended up quitting a year later because the eternal wardecs made it impossible to play period. It definitely didn't feel like i was a small fry being overlooked. I couldn't turn around without being hunted actively.
---
According to my sources Kenshin will be leaving DARKNESS after the NIP ends. This departure could spell the end for DARKNESS CO. with SIB SQUAD running away to the south (not really a suprise as SIB SQUAD are known for cowarding at the first known threat).

I'm hoping Imperator Rome will be a better running game. Also hope that EU5 is in the works, EU4 is... awesome but old.

okay, noted, but i'm reasonably active and didn't know about those last two.

&gt; It was two of us for around three months. Just because not everyone is super visible, it doesn't mean that we're not actively working.

except people were super stressed about the community team being down to just two and i just don't remember any introductions or anything saying that was no longer the case. perhaps i'm mistaken?
---
this is good, i thought it was just you with guard going :(

Gee... capital balance. Just the same thing I've been tossing forth ideas. Yet this community raped me on the entire thought. Oh wait... CCP makes an announcement, and you all wet your shorts.

Trucing is when you blue the arena - common terminology in arena based games where you'll have private and public teams. Public teams being identified as pubbies, in eve this constitutes corps without a bar of entry or extended to refer to outsiders or bads who aren't on the only relevant or reputable private teams). These terms come from the 90's
---
So star players will "truce" with other known players as they respect each others skill or ability and instead all focus on beating the less-thans. This means you don't have to share a team tag with the smellies (read other known players), but get the benefit of having a sweet ratio and goodtime. It's in a great players best interest to truce other good players to maximize the dumpstering of the unknown, unskilled pubbie scum.
---
Trucing in this regard is a mark of respect, the fact that if two reputable players fight it may be of little merit as neither have anything to prove. In the same time you can just clean up endless pubbies and achieve a higher overall score and better maintain your dominance and reputation. 
---
You truce to avoid being third partied while slaying countless pubbie scum whilst yelling "get known" and "stay small"

**Small update 1.0.9 Released**
---
* Added the estimated Jita price on every page where fittings are shown
---
* On the detail page you will also see all items in the fitting with the average estimated Jita prices
---
Currently we are working on the EVE SSO so you can login to our website and upload all your fittings from EVE Online even easier! This will also enable a few new features for you guys such as rating a fitting (Reddit style up/downvote) and leaving comments behind at a fitting.
---
Also I do hope you guys are willing to help us to get more fittings on our website to make it more actual for the community :)
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Kim Jong-un already plays EVE, sounds like his type of game.
---
Learning skills! No wait... those don't exist anymore. All of the links and answers given here are great; however, it is all dependent on what you want to do in the game. 
---
And if there is any piece of advise I can give to a new player it's this: keep your character as focused as possible. Get a feel for the game and pick a career path. If you want to do other things this is what alts and/or multi-pilot training certs are for. Trust me, if you are a person who sticks with the game, in a year or two you will really regret trying to 'jack of all trades' a single character. 
---
I hope you're trolling.  But you're the average EVE player, so probably not.
---
Honestly, one of the major problems with trying to find any kind of balance in a game like this is just how far players are willing to go to gain an advantage.   
---
Obviously EVE has a whole lotta room for improvement, but CCP's game-design is pretty good all things considered.  
---
The money is still in the game though
---
The modules are worth a lot of isk, but the money has gone to traders. Again, the only isk actually being LOST from the game is from market and industry taxes, because the money used purchasing the modules went to the people selling them, the only things that are lost from the game are the modules and the money from*taxes* 
---
The modules are gone from the game sure but that doesn't remove the money used to pay for it, which is still circulating in the market/playerbase
---
If you mean SRP costs to the player who lost the titan, still not an isk sink as it's just player to player
---
For isk sinks to be sinks they have to actively remove MONEY from the game, not assets, so taxes and NPC sell orders are two examples of isk sinks
---
&gt; Spanish is the second most spoken language, why we still don't have a EVE ONLINE localization is beyond me.
---
I'm sure if you guys had purchased EvE from CCP, you would be localized pronto. ;)
---
“...and how many never got tackled in the first place because the attackers brought the wrong fleet comp or because the Rorqual pilot avoided tackle altogether.”
---
The “x” is dying argument is valid for the reasons posted with data to back it up that content is generated around that death.  A “huge” number is relative but I suggest that the number of  Rorquals that don’t die is directly proportional to the number of smart/situationally aware players who own and fly them...duh.  I mean seriously what kind of ridiculous argument is it to say “your argument is invalid because you don’t have all the unobtainable data to support your ridiculous claim, based on a small but valid data sample, that some are dying and those numbers seem appropriate given their relation to other ships in a similar class”?  I know, I know “bollocks”, right?
---
If you want to kill one, bring the right fleet, hit the right target, at the right time, with enough time to achieve success.  It’s always been “catch me if you can”, how is this different when we know CCP will make changes?  They always have...remember the old cruise bomber?  Yep, skilled up for that just in time to see it get nerfed big time.  Everyone has a story like that and yet it seems with this Rorqual thing people are losing their minds because it seemingly can’t be killed.  I got an idea, kill whatever is created by the fruits of the Rorqual pilots mining endeavor.  Soon enough CCP will nerf the Rorqual and we can all go back to Rorquals sitting in a safe position and boosting exhumers.  FFS it used to sit in a POS and was basically never seen...now you at least have a chance to kill it and you’re fuckin’ bitching about that because it is apparently much too difficult to kill (much more so than previously, right?).  
---
PS I wonder about the zkill data and if we can determine region/alliance/corp Rorqual losses easily because, you know, it’s all about grrr goons something something.  Pathetic whiners who can’t get their way because it is unfair is what is horrible about EvE right now.  No out of balance ship attributes/abilities, not the timers, not the local chat, not the disconnects, no, it’s people bitching and whining about their inability to kill something and that this game is so unfair.  
---
It's not, but OK.

Wrong. I have to press F2 and F3 on my fighters too

If you want to camp a jump bridge you should have to commit heavy assets on both sides... The game shouldn't be made easier just because you're too lazy.
---
Sounds pretty fun!
---
Yeah, and I think you'll find a lot of people agree with you with the interests of game health in mind, but a lot of people will obviously disagree with a nerf to their style of playing the game. As someone who has personally been disillusioned with Eve for like 2 years (excepting the tournament scene) you'll probably find I fall into the former category.
---
&gt; From what I’ve seen they like handheld games and play the switch a lot

i.e. not PC games

Is there a better ship that an alpha can use? I assume the Gila performs decently, but I still have a month of training to go until on my missile skills before I'll be able to field a decent fit
---
+1
---
Yeah, this actually gives me great hope for CCP, because this tech sounds like it could be used in thousands of MMO's and other games.  
---
That means this OS could be licensed by someone for the next 1v1000 Battle Royale game, or Blizzard for a WoW 100v100 battle arena. 
---
Your the 2nd person to argue with me on this matter and I honestly don't know why. PC gaming is HUGE in Japan. They have stores called goodwill where you can get the latest PC components. Anyway, here is a source.
---
https://www.famitsu.com/news/201806/11158825.html
---
When rorquals where in POS, we had exhumers in belts. This was way better for smaller groups because you didn't need a minumum of 50+ people just to kill something and start the escalation chain. Rorqs that can survive under literally hundreds of dps ships, with a 7 minute invul is just a big fuck you to non-bloc groups, who cannot possibly beat the capital escalation of a large nullsec alliance and instead rely on hit and run tactics.
---
Upvoted (for the same reason)
---
Top Bloke! o7 Rest easy!
---
All they have to do is offer cat-ears, or 'Hello Avatar!' skins.
---
&gt; but not every roaming group can escalate to a proper comp.

You have credit cards don't you?

Just meet another reddit-er who talks out the ass just like you. Here are "source". Next time do your own research.

so your logic is that...Korean speakers own more PC's than Spanish speakers, and we have less money to pay for subs and plex? is that it?

you got a point there.

---
If it was just me, I'd have even less hair than I do now.
---
you don't fly, caps do you?
---
These are the same mouth breathers that think that changing numbers in a database will break the game as opposed to balancing it.
---
Give it a rest Capri, it ain't worth it anymore. :(
---
depends what you want to do
---
I'm interested in wormhole pvp, so I find myself flying amarr and triglavian ships frequently, for example 
---
I don’t care for goonbots any more than other bots but let’s not paint everything with the same brush, your argument in the post before that was ridiculous and not in line with actual game mechanics
---
Missles and drones.
---
I’m still a newbro, I don’t think I’ll be able to touch one for a long time haha
---
All of them.  
---
Because the meta changes. 
---
Minmatar supremacy. I can fly most ships because of firesales and offline POSes, yet basically all I ever fly is Thrashers.
---
... but it looked purdy!
---
I see, I’m mostly into pvp honestly but that’s one of the things people say from what I could find, depends on what you like doing..
---
So make alliances unable to disallow there own members, given the sov mechanics force you to not have a holding alliance moving the sov to a holding alliance wouldn't work and it gives a penalty for recruiting everyone with a pulse, something the game needs more off. 
---
The stupid dps? The same fit I used before the changes saw a drop of 50 some dps. The stupid dps CCP put on paper was with modules worth way more than a titan.
---
Why not? It is a highly specialized OS that is even written for very few types of hardware and does not need a GUI. MSDOS had like 15000.
---
At this point the different factions only serve to act as an SP (plex) sink. 
---
You train them all and use whichever is right for the job (or whichever the FC calls for).
---
Splitting Destroyer / Battlecruiser into 4 separate skills was a terrible decision from a user point of view. 
---
That moment when you don't need to do botting because you can just force your population to play the game for you...
---
obvioulsy. at its current state the game is heading straight for the fucking dumpster. CCP made a lot of changes to boost short term revenue so they sell their trainwreck of a company to anyone idiotic enough to buy it. if they  and their new shareholders want to keep eve around as a moneymaker they need to counteract that, and they need to do so fast. if they don´t that´s a valid way of maximizing profits with minimal investment until they can neck eve, use it´s tech and move on. which is a valid tactic as well. either way, they have to make up their minds. 
---
But isn’t it better to focus on a faction or two due to the amount of time it takes to train higher tier ships?
---
music?
---
I understand that. But they could make any actual licensing agreement contingent upon successful test completion. They don't have to licence it just to see if its a right product for them.
---
I saw somebody mention offline poses earlier, what’s that about?
---
Can confirm. I love flying with that magnificent beautiful bastard.
---
Promises don't mean anything at this point though.  The meat of the post really won't affect EVE in any meaningful way.  Hence, more PR speak to keep people interested, and it looks like people are biting the bait.
---
hey guy, i made an ingame channel called Blind Lead the Blind that has a bunch of helpful links for new players. its nothin crazy fancy, but i made it so that i could link basic info to newbies to help them have a better newplayer experience
---
I see that kind of makes sense, but do you think it would be a good idea to train them all to a point and then focus on one of the 4?
---
I suggest to focus on a hull, not a faction. Like, focus on frigates or cruisers.
---
Player owned starbases. Before citadels were added, that and stations was all we had to store our ships in and manufacture things. If a POS runs out of fuel, its force field goes down and everything in it can be blown up and looted. You can still find some, but it's super rare compared to before citadels. https://zkillboard.com/kill/75408038/

---
Maybe it was this ! thanks
---
I will ty. Upgrading my skills in parallel
---
Forsaken, stratagem, failed and the others are not in game anymore and I already mention why they along with hundreds of others wont say anything. Anyway I’m not here to bash on you. I saw the announcement and wealth distribution along with other changes like capital balances. If these changes are good then ill take back everything I said about the CSM (as long as the changes aren’t bias). Even if I do take them back. I still think you’re covering up how cancerous ganking is over wardec mechanics (keeping wardecs in the spot light and hiding ganking in the shadows because goon content). Personally, i can look the other way as long as content and isk fountains are opened up in other areas of the game. So, good job if thats the work of the CSM.
---
Cuz having options is hard and too much work, according to CCP.  Apparently every other gaming company in the damn world knows something they don't, but I digress.
---
You mean focus on them skill wise, like getting higher mastery and stuff?
---
The future of PLEX.
---
You win Reddit today. :) 
---
&gt; No matter how you look at it, stashing your drones in a safe invulnerable container is really fucking gay
---
True, but those drones shouldn't be worth several billion either. It's infinitely times gayer to pad an extra 5B on each killmail (and possible loot) so lets make sure to address that in any potential fix. 
---
Holy shit, how unfortunate that I missed out on those days hahaha, must of been loads of fun too.
---
can you describe what the 4, soon to be 3 of you, do? 
---
That’s a good idea. 
---
I mean train for example their t2 weapon systems, and check the t2/t3 hulls (like bombers and strategic cruisers).
---
thanks man :D
---
Where and how are you "lazily" making p0-p2 making 130m/char/week? I've got a decent, 3-day cycle setup and I'm maxing out around 50m.
---
It is. 
---
&gt;I doubt Eve would be able to handle a sweep in engine after 16 years.
---
Hadean is an OS that sits between the server hardware and the software (Eve), so while engine changes would probably be needed, it wouldn't be a rewrite for sure.
---
Oh ok, now I understand. That sounds like a good plan, I’ll look into it. Thanks a lot :)
---
No one will let you place astras in jf chokepoints unless you're friendly with locals or able to defend it
---
Those slug things know what is up
---
Ok bebe. 
---
too scared to fight us after we nuked the last titan
---
Gallente beasue drones and cool looks.
---
Level 4 is the baseline i would reccomend training all 4 and then train whichever one you find you use the most to 5 first. Except frigate, train lv5 frigate every race.
---
&gt;we'll fix everything
---
Plz come back.
---
ALIENS! :)
---
Problem with shooters is that you can't rely on 1 tick per second server communication to be enough. You'd need at least 30 times that an preferably 60. 
---
Do you not know how intellectual property works?
---
"What we have here is literally the top 1% of the top 1% screaming their lungs out ..."
---
I’ve tried to look at the drones too but they move too fast..
---
Oh yeah, it was nice. I never found anything super expensive, my best haul was ~3b of moon goo which I yolo'd through 14 nullsec jumps in a Mammoth to get to a hisec wormhole. http://i.imgur.com/4EE0ZnI.png Such a rush. 
---
I see it as a base.  Eve is setup for 1 tick per second, but I'll bet developers could do less calculations per tick and up the tickrate up.  
---
o7 mate, had a brilliant time flying with you in DHSJ and you will be dearly missed 
---
Thanks a lot for the idea, I think this will be my plan for now as up to lvl 4 it doesn’t seem to take that long anyway, appreciate your comment 7o
---
As /u/jackpkmn said, just train them all to 4 to start with.
---
Level V'ing the weapons systems is typically the more important thing as it opens up new modules you *will* want to have access to, but that takes less time than the ship skills.
---
Extra Credits also did a series on him. This guy was a legend.

the cool kid's all fly triglavian atm.
---
God damn that’s juicy and I can imagine the rush haha. Is it still a possible thing or the fun days are over?
---
I’m honestly sad that I didn’t get into eve sooner.. I remember trying it back in 2010 but I thought, this shit is too difficult cba.
---
It's also possible that whatever you've been fighting has been using energy neutralizers on you, but if it's been happening in EVERY fight, then it's more likely that you haven't been loading the capacitor booster with charges.
---
As a side note, the ancillary armor repairer needs to be loaded with nanite paste in the same way, and I'd also recommend setting the armor repairer to "Auto-reload off" so that it can keep cycling once it's out of paste.  There are different reasons you'd want this set up one way or another, but in a broad-strokes situation you'd likely want the armor repper to continue running once it's dry.
---
Ok so ore is not bringing ISK into the game, so losing more titans would make mining ect more profitable and more people would do that instead of ratting. 
---
More titans dieing means less ratting for pure ISK and would reduce the flow of ISK into the game, correct?
---
The actual numbers of rorqs, supers dying are completely irrelevant in light of damage they do to the game. Especially due to players / CCP customers leaving. Its not just the numbers, but the playstyle if you will. The whole thing of Rorqs, multiboxing, supers/cap-subcap imbalance, botting, input broadcasting, etc. etc. its all tied together. And together as a whole its making too many people leave the game. 
---
The rate of decline or real, actual players that play a single, or 2-3 accounts at most because of all this shit combines (Rorquals included) is pretty bad. So say whatever you want, but that is the bottom line of it. To some extent, in short term the multiboxers can and do offset that rate of decline by creating more and more accounts. But now comes in a whole new factor into the equation. The increased multiboxed accounts increase demand on plex, while at the same time the people that are leaving the game diminish the supply since often times these are the original extra plex suppliers. So this whole multiboxing thing is gonna fall off a cliff financially and the writings on the wall.
---
So say whatever about the numbers, but the whole point of making any Rorq changes etc. is to stop those small players from leaving. Without them, you and your Rorqs become pointless and you will leave too and it is your playstyle and the general damage to the game it causes that is making them leave. Sure, I guess you can stay afloat for quite a while, years even before the lights finally go out, just as Serenity did ....
---
Wtb more tankers killing excavators
---
Truces kill this game, everyone benefits from wars
---
It really is. A comp like that can stay on the field, harass and get kills for a long time for super cheap and even really new players can fly it and have fun. If we weren't so far from home last night and hadn't been out for 3.5 hours we would have docked back up with few losses, haw titans or no haw titans.
---
But is he?
---
I’ve been focusing on the weapons and the other important skills too lately so they’re looking decent for now. But at least I’ve got a plan for the ships too, thanks guys :)
---
at this point, i've been playing for so long there's pretty much no subcap i can't fly - and I probably have the ship skill to V.
---
don't worry if OP keeps it up the harassment will start too...
---
This is the only ships, for some reason I just wasn’t bothered to train hahaha
---
What source sounds like a load of shit.  Zero chance of this happening.  
---
I'd be crediting the professional designers and developers, rather than a random gamer, for the work they're doing 
---
Gnosis (BC), Praxis (BS) should be able to handle C2-C3 sites, IMHO. I can't check now what is available for alphas, but you would need to play with the fits anyways.
---
General idea is to use one of the following approaches:
---
* Passive Shield tanking - Adaptive Invul fields in mid slots, with some Shield Extenders and Purger rigs, with DCU+Omnidirectional Tracking Enhancers + DDAs + Shield Relays in lows, or
---
* Active Armor Tanking - DCU + Energized Adaptive Nano Membranes + Armor Rep + DDAs in lows, Cap Batteries + Drone Nav Comps + Omnidirectional Tracking Link + Painter in mids, Trimark rigs for more armor
---
* Highs according your skill profiles with 1 or 2 Drone Links
---
* Drones probably Federation Ogres all the time, but if low on drone skills use Hammerheads instead.
---
* Use Mobile Depot to switch between Def/Atk modules according the waves.
---
But it would be really hard to farm effectively with a single alpha pilot. If you can find someone else it would be sooo much better to run those duo.
---
Do you have a favorite faction tho? Or as usual, you fly whatever is required for the task?
---
Not today Satan!
---
that what goons get for being cunts and following an equivalent of a walking cunt...
---
honestly pure blind is fun as fuck right now.  
---
I’m not your bebe, buddy
---
Don't they mine like 100-150m an hour in the enormous belts not including settup time. For their cost that doesn't seem ridiculous when compared to other capitals PVE abilities. The ability to scale however might be an issue. The availability of ore, how many belts etc. might also be a related issue. 
---
Ratting systems can sustain a couple supers/carrier and a good many VNI with the recent anomaly nerfs; any more and you're waiting for anoms to spawn. I wonder if mining anoms will see the same fate and be further tweaked/balanced considering there are moons and whatnot people can mine in addition to those belts.
---
Or is it content as all those minerals turn into ships to blow up instead of isk injected into wallet and thus in the best interest of game activity that massive amounts of ore are mined? I guess it all depends on the conclusion the dev team came to and what they feel is best for eves continued success 
---
Yeah I realized that after
---
not particularly.
---
I just fly what the alliance will SRP for pvp - fuck wasting my own money on pvp.
---
For pve, i'll use what gets the job done fastest with the least input from me... so that's usually a Vexor Navy Issue, or a Gila.
---
Awesome dude
---
They are poor game developing company, that managed to stumble upon a goldmine, a mine that funded their follies and has been milked dry.
---
Where is the money that been spent in developing EVE? Finished tiercide? Balancing? Content drivers? We can see only the major facelift with new graphics &amp; ship assets.
---
Their track record is piss poor, so poor, that they even abandoned independent gamedev and sold their asses off. 
---
We'll see how far they are willing to go to keep lights on.
---
Atm we only see chopping of the CCP's staff, including key community personnel.
---
Wow you are a nice person.
---
It depends on who you're with. At first I just trained what I needed to for doctrine ships. I ended up training mostly minmatar and amarr, but have needed to train all races for subcaps to varying degrees. My capital alt cant fly shit for Caldari or Gallente to this day.
---
Imagine posting gigantic essays targeting a certain group, and then making the entire discussion about yourself, and then being surprised and angry when they laugh at you at every turn
---
Oh it's possible in a different way, if you are in a wormhole, and see a citadel that has ran out of fuel, ie 'Low power' it has reduced hitpoints, and only 2 timers. It will be very difficult to kill solo, but not impossible. And in wormholes, citadels will drop loot. See this crap: https://zkillboard.com/system/31002135/page/12/ those are just the ships they didn't bother taking.

when goons comprise a good 25-30+% of the population i'd say it's a good reason to point at them... as it's a lot easier to spot and a lot more condensed

Holy shit, 500bil worth of ships... Could you loot that too btw, if anything at all? 
---
That’s why they say the real money and the fun content is in the wormholes haha

So still more accurate than CCP's promises.

It's true. At the end of every fleet, every member is required to complete a Survey Monkey form where we outline what we could have done to make the experience more engaging for those users who tackled the rorqual. There are those whose focus is witty local banter (ie, Not too abrasive, not too flirty. Keep them wanting more, titillating with word-play). There are those who head up the choreography team so that anchored fleets reflect the spirit animal of the tackling alliance. All of us bring our best to make sure that everyone walks away from the experience with a tale to tell.
---
I am quite partial to missile ships and shield self-reps, so I find myself flying Caldari a lot.
---
I anticipate the devs in their further push for “bigger =better” fights will introduce “super duper mega ore anoms” perhaps having them only be mined if you fit “T3 mining upgrade mod” Available for purchase in the store, with a special skin bonus this week only!”
---
Goons are the biggest proof the Communism works.

Ya, all of them were unpiloted, so you could just hop in any of them and fly away, they just chose to blow them up.

An *ISK sink* is not merely a thing that costs a lot of ISK. It is an economic term that refers to ISK permanently removed from the game. A good example is NPC taxes. ISK paid to other players does not meet the definition.

*ISK sink* an economic term that you should just avoid using.

Specialty OSs for this kind of application have no need to be very large at all; If you know exactly what hardware you will have and exactly what kind of functions you will need to be able to perform you can easily make an OS in that size or even smaller depending on requirements.

But how would an OS swap help much besides freeing up a small amount of resources from the host machine, unless they also rewrite the game engine to actually take advantage of features the new OS provides?

Why? Apex Legends (and Titanfall before it) are hosted on Azure and are notable for having vastly smoother launches than a lot of other games. Hell, Apex Legends hit what, 2 million players in the first day or two (and recently passed 50 million) with overall pretty minor stability issues compared to the usual Error 37 nonsense you get with most "AAA" game launches these days.
---
Good feedback.
---
You forgot that the T3 mining upgrade module is only a 1.0374% chance legendary in the "Miner's Mayhem" lootbox and at 50 plex a go you'll likely mostly end up with lore items that don't do anything. Also there is the 10% chance the key breaks when opening the lockbox as is standard, which is acceptable since there is also a 5% chance the lockbox upgrades three tiers to offer dopamine bukkake extra happy number one special time. We all need that.

oh, of course that's possible. But that will certainly not support "all of POSIX and most of the Linux Syscalls API". Claiming to do that in just a few thousand lines of code on top of whatever else that OS is supposed to do is just absurd.

Speaking of citadels and unpiloted ships I remembered this amazing glitch from citadels were just added, if you left your ship in a citadel it could sometimes just sort of warp off by itself without you, to a random stargate, sometimes get stuck in the middle of the sun. It was hilarious.

I think their goal is to smash things together and see what happens. If it works well, they move to the next phase. If it's a total bust, time to essentially start over.

Its a good business move and aligns with current CCP interest, because Korea is famously known to be the most accepting community when it comes to getting milked for endless microtransactions.  For some reason it seems to be the preferred model over there.

It's very difficult to say, as they don't provide much technical background. The only thing to go off is the image which compares incremental-scaling to hyper-scaling and a few details on their main page at: [https://www.aetherengine.io/](https://www.aetherengine.io/)
---
Containers / Microservices / Middleware have been around for a while, but certainly have their issues. Latency, concurrency, and redundancy (in a persistent) world are all issues I'd expect need tackling.
---
I'd **guess** that their OS is bare-metal, with no Containers / Microservices / Middleware and a highly specialist network stack that allows communication with other HadeaonOS bare metal servers. If these servers can truly subdivide 3D space up across multiple CPU's and servers, it could give a big performance boost. Eve can't do that currently, AFAIK - hence the ever increasing heatbeats (ticks) when more people join a system.

---
*potentially*, but there is an opportunity cost in terms of training into mining. You can't just go straight from ratting to mining unless you have the skills for it, and mining at the moment is dominated by Rorquals which take a lot of time and money (and to be fair, taxes and NPC sell orders) but generally most titans aren't going to start mining just because their titan died.
---
They'll either already have a rorqual trained up and mining alongside their ratters or just not care because they've got enough money to get another titan and keep ratting
---
Either way I don't think it's a significant isk sink but I see your point, you'd just have to kill a *lot* of titans to make that really happen, and then you still have carrier/vni ratting
---
The best part is I know OP. 
---
Nice meme dude 😂. You’re in Dura Lexx now?
---
I totally agree. Never had more fun than in Faction Warfare small gang fights. But I like the idea that they are prepping for damn near anything in the future and pushing to accomplish a wildly difficult task. I hope this works, it will open up a world of opportunity in the future for large-scale battles while still maintaining stability in regions around the main cluster.
---
Which is good, but it'd be even better if normal rats cared about standings, cause then they'd just cover you as you loot the ESS

---
You can shoot jump bridge gates with a citadel on grid, can't do that with normal gates but apparently making them virtually im possible to be vulnerable is an okay thing for average players to deal with
---
Ok, rhere's a lot wrong here so I'l try to take it one by one.
---
A "free pass" is definitely not what I could call dropping 10b+ of vulnerable ships in hostile space, just to get content.  I shouldn't have to explain that.
---
The other big thing wrong is that kind of my whole point is that big blobs will always win.  If my way doesn't fix it, neither will yours!  So, the obvious choice left is to allow for engaging gameplay.  What I'm talking about is allowing small groups to win on organization, knocking down a structure before a response can be made, rather than with numbers.  You're assuming the blob is already on grid, which is exactly the opposite of what I'm proposing.  I agree completely that 100 people will beat 10... fucking duh... but what I am saying is that current mechanics favor the 100 because the 10 have no way of RFing a structure before a response can be formed.  Remove damage caps doesn't give them a free pass bc they still can't maintain their own structures in hostile space, win head-on, win without planning, win without risk, or really win at all if the blob is willinh to show up for the next timer.  It does allow them a prayer at forcing content, and makes blocs pay for getting too spread out.

Uh huh. A link to some random mining ship kill in 2016? You're wasting your time dude.

You didn't say, but I would hope your making sure you have trained the Core skills first.
---
Inclusive of Shield and Armour Rigging to 5. 
---
They will effect every ship you ever want to fly.
---
Since you can already fly up Battle Cruisers, I'd look at getting your gunnery/missile skills trained up so you can use T2 weapons.  
---
Once you get all racial frigates to 5 with fully trained T2 weapon skills as well, I'd then look at getting cruiser skills to 5 as well. Cruiser 5 unlocks additional ships..

&gt;I was browsing the "how would you save EVE" thread and something I saw repeated over and over again was that Skill Injectors basically ruined EVE. In fact, Skill Injectors had almost no change on EVE, they just made something that was formerly slightly inconvenient more convenient.  
---
&gt;Prior to skill injectors if I wanted a Rorq alt (or any other kind of character), even if I was a one day old account, I could easily go to the character bazaar, swipe mommy's credit card and obtain said alt. Today with skill injectors I do the same exact thing (the cost is fairly comparable as well), except I buy skill injectors instead of a character. The only difference between then and now is that now I get to pick my character's name.  
---
&gt;Why is this such a horrible thing that it destroyed EVE? As someone who used to make a fortune brokering characters in the bazaar it totally killed my business model, but overall I think Injectors are a pretty cool idea and a vast improvement on what existed before them.
---
I don't really give a shit about any of this. What I do give a shit about is that they completely failed at what they were originally supposed to do. They were supposed to be a catch up mechanism for newbs to help bypass or make quicker jumps over some of the training time wall. They were supposed to close the gap a bit between new and vet players.
---
Instead it worked out exactly opposite. Old rich vets now have more accounts which are fully skilled up, while the newbs are now hitting the $$$ wall instead of the time wall. And it goes deeper then that. Newbs to Eve are not necessarily newbs to gaming or MMOs in general, they have experience. So many of them realize that what is happening, see this whole skill injector and multi account meta gaming shit and leave the game because they are literally disgusted with it. Some stay for the sake of "the journey", but not enough.
---
So this is why I hate skill injectors. They are a big cog in the mechanism that makes too many players leave, and even old players log off and not log back on.
---
If you knew him you'd know the answer to that...
---
Whenever I read that one of my fellow EvE players passes away, it saddens me, even I haven't crossed paths with the guy. I've met and flown with Etienne in DHSJ. This community has lost a great member.
---
&gt; But for real, what happened to my hardcore sandbox where space was dangerous and the losses mattered?
---
The game never reset so you have a dozen plus years of resource collection and coffer building which alone aids in the destruction of this "limited resources" fantasy. Additionally, the game doubled-down on the acquisition of wealth/resources which enabled newer or less fortunate players to catch up to people who had played ten years prior.
---
So you have proliferation of resources, isk and SP (farms). This also means instead of whales dual-wielding credit cards controlling all the supers, they became plentiful enough that f2ps and people who were not rich in real life could skill and acquire them. This also ruined the game for many people who did buy their titan/super with a credit card (rip Black Legion) or otherwise maintained supremacy ( rip Pandemic Legion ) as they were no longer special.
---
How to fix this without disastrous results to the economy is beyond me. Inflation is thought to be healthy when controlled and orderly, moving forward the ideal situation is monitoring and tweaking the amount pumped into the system which also causes horrible results (like negative value events that are now commonplace).
---
Eve won't return to the time you're referring to, it is not possible. Countering the momentum of the proliferation causes great disdain. In a sense the train is out of control and there are no breaks. Realistically there is no going back and so the most valuable use of time would be contemplating the best possible design goals for the least worse future.
---
Sure but you have to be smarter than the whole operation, from scouts to fcs to all the supers jumping in to save the guy.
---
CCP making a huge fuzz about how they finally wanted to rebalance meta modules and streamline their naming conventions. they got about 30% throughh with it while taking 2 years to do so. then it was never heard of again. 
---
Oh I haven’t talked to riggs since upholders closed other than bumping into him once when he flew with hawks. 
---
You’re so defensive about people reconnecting on the internet. Did I talk to your man crush or something?

 Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit.

Consider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock. For the cyno is not yet lit.

Break free of the station and witness the universe before you. For the cyno is not yet lit.
---
Set your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait. For the cyno is not yet lit.

Pay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them.

---
I kinda agree with this, big structures, big fights big timers etc. Small structures, smaller fights, smaller timers etc. Makes very good sense. Upvoted.
---
I checked out their site and your guess seems to be pretty close, and according to their tech demos, subdividing space like that is exactly what it does.
---
I wonder if CCP thinks this is OK or they tried fixing it but if they remove it POSes wardec every wormhole and your CPU melts.

I used eve-O preview to 5-box (miners, so very low APM, I don't imagine you could pull of doing pvp with my setup) on a 1920x1080 monitor, it worked surprisingly well
---
mittens definitely doesn't help himself, but then again in his position he doesn't really need to.
---
I’ve been mostly focusing on the “magic 14” skills which are mostly around 4 and a few at 5. I recently tried looking up the purpose and how important the rigging skills were but I couldn’t find much info, so they’re not very high right now mostly lvl 2/3..
---
I can also equip some t2 weapons but I just recently got them so that’s not really efficient I suppose..

Thanks for your reply btw, that was very informative :)

Tbh it's closer to jita and very rarely gives a mission

The HadeonOS website does say tens of thousands at least, I imagine 'a few thousand' when translated out of corporate marketing-speak really means something more like 'not more than 100,000 lines of code (yet)'.
---
Upventured. 
---
What’s wrong with injectors?
---
Init deployed to Hakonen but they're just kind of ship-spinning there till goons come to give directions.
---
An improvement on Tapi at least, who deployed to Oijanen to "invade Geminate," then lost 130 dreads and un-deployed the next day.
---
Or that random goon sig that deployed to FDZ at Christmas, then vanished and had all their structures popped without defence.

Great stats. Do you track your super kills as well? What do those look like?

After a few years it just kinda happens.
---
Most of the support skills overlap. Once you can fly an Amarr Heavy Assault Cruiser with T2 guns, for example, you're only Gallente Cruiser 5 and Medium Hybrid Turrets 5 away from flying a Gallente HAC just as well.
---
You don't have to train everything to 5, either. For most skills level 4 is *good enough* until you need to train it further as a prerequisite for something or you've decided that's a thing you absolutely want to do as hard as possible. 
---
This is a fucking masterpiece.
---
Alright, I’m convinced 
---
focus alli/corp doc and then focus what you wana fly. after a couple years theres almost nothing cruiser down i cant fly.
---

Too many buzzwords. Sounds super alarming.
---
He talks about Mar5hy

Good suggestion. I think I may use that resolution for pvp if 4k suffers too much.  I'm surprised how good the game still looked at that resolution. I think I can survive with the 250% until they release some more custom UI options. Thanks!

What is the over under on people complaining that they didnt?

Hmm well not sure it will work. WoW has its servers now in cloud and it is worse than it was when they had server blades. Game can not keep more than 20 players in one spot without lags. So not sure cloud is the answer for big fights in Eve...

We don't have nearly as many of them: 3 supercarrier kills since start of 2018, with at most 5 times that number attempted. We've had 1 Titan into hull before we got turbo-blobbed in last 12 months, don't think we've had a credible catch on another.
---
Supercarriers and Titans are much harder to catch because if they rat aligned you see them on D-Scan, and by the time you've combat probed/warped, they are in a POS or on a Keepstar. At least you've got up to a 5 minute window while the Industrial Core cycles to try and get on top of a Rorqual. 
---
NSA forcing 0m/s like all other 'siege' modules might be nice.
---
Most of them will probably lose interest since APM doesn't mean dick in EVE, since everything is limited to 1 second (or more with server shitting itself) ticks.
---
This is a brilliant comment, and a potent reminder of why its important to bring new blood into the game, and encourage them once they're here.

I wasn't memeing. Just saying my foray into WH wasn't challenging.
---
This is really more of a tech demo for Hadean than it is for Eve.  The Eve visual assets make this demo more compelling (ie, to press, investors, etc.) than some debugging client.
---
100 Titans + Supers can destroy 1000 subcaps. It's not an easy problem to solve.
---
But much like the barbarian at the gates, wars of attrition escalated en masse could have an interesting effect, if you ask me.
---
But you're still asking the barbarian to suffer while the empires flourish... when that barbarian could just join the empire.
---
This is why you see so many complaining that a lack of scarcity is driving stale behaviors.
---
Wait! There aren't actually 10,000 real people that play this game, so do they want us all to bring our alts?

Currently, the meta is also build around TiDi. A hit and run titan drop that is able to get out within 10 mins is rarely possible with TiDi. With only 10 mins to react with enough force to repell a surprise drop, you will rarely see counterdrops. 
---
Just imagine:
---
* a dead dic/hic would stay dead (too little time to reship and get back to the fight) -&gt; time to clear tackle
---
* only very few minutes to gather the numbers for counterdrops and organize the fleets, is often not enough (you need significantly more than to defend a rorq
---
* even formed fleets are too late, if they are 5+ jumps out.
---
This everything has easily the potential to shift the meta to much more aggressive and therefore destructive meta. Currently, as soon as a medium sized alliance battle starts 400+ players, the Tidi is maximum at 50%. That already gives enormous amounts of extra time...
---
plz also tell me how to sell mined good or store mined goods that are in your cargo hold...
---
jumping is for moving through stargates, warping is for warping to different shit inside a system
---
I thought memetani quit. Is he still playing on an alt or something? 
---
All of them, but to break it down, I mostly fly caldari and amarr frigs and destroyers, faction cruisers, caldari/amarr BCs, gallante/faction BS, Amarr dreads, caldari/minamatar carriers. I mostly look at what I want to do, pick the best hull, then train the necessary skills.
---
p.s. caldari supremacy
---
Armageddon day was fantastic.
---
Of course...I was flying an Apoc with 8x 200mm autocannons like a noob.  Those were the best turrets for the punisher, why wouldnt three times more be good on a battleship? SMH.
---
Had a great time.
---
So THAT is where Mr. Happy went!
---
Now instead of getting irritated whenever the chat servers are down, the whole game will be! You no longer have to live with unreliable chat servers when you're in-game!
---
Surprised that Magnate was able to contain balls this.
---
jump = warp to gate at zero and jump through it in one command. you can actually cancel the jump part if you hit ctrl+space (stop ship) right as you land
---
warp = warp to stuff. you can warp to gates at 0, then use jump, or just sit there for ebin gate games
---
Every star system in EVE is its own "instance," or room.
---
When you warp, you're moving between different objects (stations, planets, startgates, etc) in the room (system) you're currently in.
---
When you jump, you're moving between rooms (systems).
---
Well that’s because Federico wasn’t there!
---
I'm not necessarily disagreeing, but it's easy to say that. But "being smarter" is pretty tough when all the rorq has to do is hit a cyno button to be completely safe. Even after you drop a cyno jammer, he has a full minute to hit the button before the jammer comes online.
---
Then after the cyno is lit, the defenders have 10 minutes to show up before the cyno goes down (I'm not sure if a cyno can stay cycled on if a jammer is online and in range, but let's say no). 7.5 of those 10 minutes, the rorqual can be completely invincible.
---
So yes, I somewhat agree that the attackers need to be smart, but even then, the rorqual has so many advantages under a super umbrella that it's a bit ridiculous.
---
Whelp, that explains it. My TV doesn't support Chroma Subsampling, so I have no distortion with text :)
---
NC. would bring fleets to 7RM, yes. It was always a good time though. 
---
~~Especially~~ except that one time I tried to DD an NC abaddon with the Beanstar and Securitas warped his T3D fleet on top of it and got oopsed. https://i.imgur.com/mUISKKI.png
---
Not sure how given 2014 brave lived in catch and sendaya before that, late 2014 brave mostly was subject to getting helldunked ( you known the thing your now doing to ever roaming gang ). 
---
Believe it or not some people would rather be a spy than triplebox AFK VNIs. They get their kicks from taking from others, rather than from gaining for themselves.
---
warping to something warps you at 0 to it +/- 2500m (iirc)
---
warping to within x warps you to that thing at whatever range you chose +/- 2500m
---
Jumping means either going through a stargate, or activating a jump drive to a cyno or cyno beacon.
---
After we moved out of Hek i got podded and couldn't find my way back so i spent a lot of time in hisec.
---
Making eve 64-bit will do nothing to help or hurt botters.
---
dock in station or citadel, open up your inventory, and drag and drop the ore from your ore hold (under the ship you are in) into your item hangar. 
---
how to find structures to compress your mined resources?
---
I appreciate the propaganda, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, considering test and those bee guys are buddies right now.
---
I can fly all subcaps, so I guess, "all the factions"
---
Wow. We should make up a reddit nuance blindness award to give you.
---
&gt; The numbers seem to indicate that rorquals currently are dying faster in numbers than all supers combined by volume. This would indicate a bit of content.
---
To make such a claim you need to know how many Rorquals and Supers are being used in the game. Monthly mining/Ratting amounts are not that different (40 trillionish). You need 4 Rorquals to farm as much as 1 super. If they are dying at similar numbers, then Rorquals are dying at the 1/4th rate of what they should have.
---
Here is what you need to do if you want to actually gauge how much risk Rorquals have. You need to take the Rorqual/Excavator deaths, and then divide it to total mining done (non-Rorqual mining in null is negligible). I have [already done it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=391531178). Some regions lose less than 3% of their mining. That is incredibly low and bad for the health of the game, as each Rorqual dying is often that day's content for an entire fleet hunting it.
---
The issue with Rorquals is not Rorquals in general. The issue is that there is pretty much no way to kill non-afk, non-idiot Rorquals under a supercap umbrella. This is why much of Rorqual mining has moved under the umbrella regions. At the beginning of the Rorqual changes they were dying left and right in many regions. Those were the times when Rorquals were actually good for the game. We are not in those times anymore.
---
People fail to realize the umbrella in combination of the Rorqual is the problem. A 7 minutes PANIC wouldn't be a problem if people couldn't reach to Rorquals in distress in one jump of their umbrella. Yield is already incredibly low compared to the investment. It has overafk'ability/overscalability issues, but if those 15-boxers of Rorquals regularly died and contributed to everyday content of Eve, then nobody would complain about the scalability issues.
---
Consider it a call for the Goons to Pearl Harbor TEST then. 
---
&gt;but those drones shouldn't be worth several billion either.
---
then use the Tech 2 variants that are relatively free. You have choice.
---
Lol, I know, it was an "ad" joke, nvm
---
omg someone just punch hilmar in the face at the next EVE thing he's at. just punch him. there are a ton of things you can do legally to avoid fully getting fucked for physical/domestic or whatever. esp a first time offender. don't worry.
---
but someone clock that faggot and then point at him and say "thats from everyone who plays eve" ok? dude seriously needs to be hit. pain is the reminder of what not to do.
---
if vegas is this year and he's there i'll punch him myself. it should verily terrify you i'm confident in this. it clearly shows i got the legal and money behind me. loving parents and all. "M-mr hilmar is a bigot and called me a faggot mommy, so i punched him!"  
---
my rich as fuck dad: "they called my homosexual son a faggot, my son whomst i love dearly?"  
---
"yes father! pay for my legal bills, that dirty icelander is mad he got decked"
---
auuuuutismmmmm
---
I would be totally okay with that. I dislike both, so watching them attack each other would be fun. Although the sperg on reddit would be pretty much intolerable.
---
Nice! 
---
it was an intermittent issue that has been fixed and broken again and again
---
yikes are you okay friend?
---
This is stupidly irritating
---
whats the difference between station &amp; citadel?
---
Your definition of pubbie is wrong.  A pubbie is ANYONE without an SA account.  
---
And how many heat sinks you running..
---
Honestly that sounds like a unwilling to figure it out problem because really getting a pod from A to B even in 2013 wasn't all that hard.
---
Some npc stations do this as otherwise an anthnor/tatara will likely have this but you will need to be able to dock to these and the service will have to be installed.
---
Lol hit detection .. that’s your fuck you response.. calculations are hard .. server farms can’t do shit??? PayPal and others are just lost in the mystic of math but thankfully ccp is so unique on that front ... the fuck you even know what you’re talking about .. who said anything about data lakes .. I know I didn’t ...
---
Come back when you’ve developed something more than a word press blog and some actual enterprise experience...
---
“Fancy” wording ... Jesus that was where you ultimately lost credibility 
---
Fiber or CO2?  I dont have experience with CO2 but we have a fiber.  I was looking closely at the "online" text and noticed the chiseling you have on top edges.  I have the same issue with thicker materials depending on how tight the corner is the laser has to go around
---
Nothing says invigorating sports levels of competition like belt mining.
---
Trade hubs will give you best bang for the buck. Jita, Amarr, Dodixie and Rens are the 4 major high sec trade systems.
---
You know it 
---
CCP Would need to care again and stop looking at Eve online as the awkward child they wish they didn't have to interact with more than they should. 
---
Right click a structure in your overview, choose "show info". Click on the services tab.
---
If it has refining in there, you can compress ore as well (completely free). Right click on the ore while it is in the item hangar (not your ship) of the structure, select compress.
---
So I just search them in the ingame search bar?
---
It's like poetry.
---
Citadels are player owned and managed. Stations or Outposts as they are sometimes referred to are "owned" by the different NPC factions in the game. Obviously the player owned ones can be removed either by the owner anchoring it or hostiles shooting it where as the NPC are permanent. 
---
Open map (F10) and on the top right corner of the map there is a search button, which you can look for the mentioned locations..
---
Beam or Pulse? 
---
&gt;Thinking literally everyone else plays this game as a mining challenge sim
---
OH MAN GUYS DiD YOU SEE HOW MUCH MINING WE DID AND THEY DIDN'T DO
---
SO MUCH WINNING
---
Oooh So my ship and inventory can be destroyed by a player in citadel whereas my things are safe in a station?
---
made my day this did
---
You must be talking about the mining frigates: Venture, Endurance and Prospect. They mine less than a barge or exhumer but they cost less and are better suited to operating in hostile territory. Alphas can use the Venture which costs nearly nothing. Hulks and Macks are now considered juicy targets even in highsec. Outside of highsec the Rorqual has been given mining drones and can outmine any ship in the game.
---
Did you mean orbital infrastructure?
---
And?
---
welcome you are
---
There are so many jita IV &amp; V and then moons so is there any specific location or any of them are viable?
---
I am coming to this conclusion as well . But let eve die while small gang pvp is still a thing.
---
Most people use jita 4 Caldari assembly base or something like that, that’s the biggest trade hub 
---
You tried. ;)
---
Doesn't matter if it is dying or not, its dead to me :D
---
There might not be much of a playerbase left if it takes 5 years to implement this.  Hell, it's taking over a year to put a simple chat server "on the cloud".  Porting an entire game would be a nightmare with a full CCP staff, let alone the skeleton crew they have now keeping EVE running.
---
Fucking brilliant, thank you 
---
Check the Eve dotlan maps. Systems are connected by jumpgates. You warp around in each system. 
---
EVE: Phoenix
---
Ah, well ocarina was the first version I played, so I guess it has more meaning to me. What are your thoughts on twilight princess? 
---
No the player citadel itself can be destroyed but your things inside it will move to asset safety. This will hold them for a period of time until you can either deliver them for free to any other station or citadel in the same system. I honestly don't remember how long this takes. 
---
you sound salty lol calm down haha
---
Flair checks out
---
Most of the time when a Corp hits a wh structure, they'll take the t2 and faction ships and pop the rest, not really worth the effort to get them to market.
---
Ooh so better keep my things in stations, right?
---
it's not dying, it's dead
---
Polarization is bullshit
---
0 x n = 0 
---
well, if you want, you can quit your corp, move to hisec, and join incursion group for safe isk (provided you can follow fc instruction), entry point is battleship or t2 logistic cruiser, such group is WTM which is newbie friendly
---
Find out what you like to pew pew with and whether you like to shield or armor tank... that will narrowed it down a lot. I love missiles and shields. Caldari is an obvious choice. 
---
nah as I said your stuff is fine it just goes to asset safety for a short time. Also there is reinforce cycles on citadels so it won't just die randomly.
---
bots and rorquals really kill it though
---
This is way funnier than it should have been!! 
---
Read "wealth distribution" CCP are communists
---
r/eve is a broken record
---
All the people who say it's dying don't actually play EVE, they just shit post on reddit. 
---
Eve's servers have been open to Korea for the entire time it's been active. 
---
CCP is adding localization. 
---
So you still lurking this subreddit makes you some sort of digital necrophiliac? ;)
---
They can't nerf Rorqs anymore without jacking up the Tech 2 market - Rorqs effectively replaced POSes. 
---
The issue is a bit more complex than it seems, despite the obvious imbalance of the hull.
---
Nah. It's fucking trash. 
---
I read that it is Pearl Abyss who wanted the Korean localisation. If CCP had gotten to make the call, it would never have happened.
---
Eve is staying... it's the players that are leaving. Why do you think they just opened it's servers to Korea! It'll be a huge bot farm there. Just think of all the new subs they'll get. 
---
I for one welcome the Koreans who will hopefully tank the plex prices.
---
Damn, they got that Brutix out JUST in time!
---
The age old adage, be able to out rep everyone and you win! Nice vid
---
A lot of people disagree with the direction the game is heading; there appears to be no real sense of loss anymore. Lose a region? Asset safety. It's somewhat ironic that wormholes have probably the best citadel and loss mechanics, while being somewhat cut off from the main "allure" of the game (sov null, empire building).   
---
Entosis warfare is one of the most boring aspects of the game, a few people have to gimp their ship while hundreds of others sit there picking their noses and watching.  
---
They made rorqual tanks too powerful, and instead of fixing that problem, they decided to migrate the risk to the drones the rorquals use. Now the best way to do damage to your enemies isn't even to kill their ships, but their drones. This lowers the amount of engagements people actually have, and just gives people an easy way to do a lot of damage (this isn't the players fault, it's a design fault).  
---
Years of unaddressed combat interceptor superiority for pretty much everything slowly bled out the players who camped gates, wanted to roam in pretty much anything fucking else, but couldn't because bubble immunity was a must.  
---
I could go on and on about citadels, fax, etc, the main point is that CCP needs to address issues with their balances a lot faster.
---
I'm having a good time. Fuck the rest.
---
Probably because they used to play, then found themselves not wanting to. 
---
agreed. 
---
Wait, I didn't realize we were doing these for Star Citizen now.

Rorquals are a hunting priority. End Transmission......

You forgot: Remove Titan Bridging. 
---
Titan bridging gives massive power projection to larger alliance and negates the local inhabitant advantage. The whole point of eve is the attrition of having to move through the vastness of space.
---
Its on life-support.
---
OK so because of cheating you want this to run on the server, you can't trust clients. CCP painted themselves in a corner on the server because they're using a special version of Python which is even more garbage with multithreading than the regular one. The only way you can scale Python is by having multiple of them run at the same time and talk to each other. This is other than being more cumbersome to do is also less efficient because you need to send data back and forth between the Pythons instead of them looking at the same memory.
---
&gt; Honestly that sounds like a unwilling to figure it out problem because really getting a pod from A to B even in 2013 wasn't all that hard.
---
I never said it was. Just that i couldn't figure it out yet. I couldn't remember the name of the system we were in and didn't know about the assets window yet. 
---
Admittedly i probably should have tried harder to talk to someone else to figure these things out. But in 2013 i was still pretty antisocial and hadn't gone through the process of becoming a raider in world of warcraft who must speak to people. 
---
And i spent most of my time in Aufay and Cat when i was in hisec. 
---
Its going to depend what you are doing, are you in Null? WH? Low-sec, Highsec (Fly a Catalyst)...
---
But honestly, it depends what what you are doing in the game...
---
Its a CO2 laser and I think the white stuff that you see at the "online" are just parts of the foil that I forgot to take off beforehand haha
---
But you are right, tight corners like these are pretty suboptimal most of the time
---
People disagree with nerfing caps in general, not small pvp. Nice try, troll. In case you missed it... CCP just announced they are looking into capital balance. LOL... sorry, bro. I'm on the right side of things here. It's obvious you have a game style that you want to keep. Try adapting those salty tears.
---
Bless you.
---
Whatever ll make this game less "bootcamp online".
---
Dammit stop getting my hopes up like that. For a moment I was worried I had missed the start if another war
---
Don’t judge eve health by /r/eve 
---
I agree with OP.  CSM just had a great meeting
---
I detect residual butt hurt from the AT cancellation 
---
Interesting, because Goons and TEST have been ganging up to fight Pandemic Horde. 
---
needs more purple
---
So that's slang that SA pickedup but it didn't originate on SA. As an internet historian and connoisseur who has banged no less than 300 14/f/cali vampires on AOL chatrooms including infiltrating girl on girl in the nineties I can assure you the term originates from public vs private teams. 
---
Infantry Online was an example of usage, 1999 and a game that operates to this day in a free capacity (away from Sony, the company who bought it and daybreak - the current owners of all the mess that was SOE/stationpass)
---
Infantry Online was bought by Sony as it had a unique chat system where you could Whisper, talk to your squad or talk in global and have many tiered chats which Sony would implement this system in a new game they were creating called Everquest and is the roots of todays multi-tiered chat systems complete with different colors/whispers/private rooms in online gaming. (Unfortunately they only wanted the chat and infantry would go pay to play and be left to die basically)
---
SA can use the term just as people are called cucks that might not actually have their wives fucked by another man; and you can infer that's what it means but it's actually just outside vs inside.
---
For further information you could try searching Geocities or Angelfire results or just existed on the internet in the 90's
---
and defender an even bigger advantage, making delve even safer, you see, you have absolutely  no fucking idea what you are talking about
---
Vonholes second AT kill in a week

Just take jumpdrives away from everything but jump-freighters and see what ll happen.

I'm not the one making dumb post about "ccp please make the game fit to me because I can't fit to it I'm too bad for it :( :( :( :(" 
---
btw, CCP is saying they are going to balance them since what ? 1/2  years ? They already start to nerf FAX but it's still pretty low, they are still beast in small/medium size warfare space, you know, Wh space, the space made for people like you
---
I like the bait that was used. new character. get it killed in a scan fitted astero twice. And then get this guy to drop it. 
---
You're right, all CCP needs to do is implement "cloud scale solution architectural strategies and get rid of hybrid on-prem server strategies" and all their problems will instantly be solved.
---
He has been using the virtuoso regularly to kill relic runners, so it was good bait. Even though i am blue with the virtuoso pilot, i applaud Vonhole for reacting so fast and using the correct bait!  
---
Amazing.  
---
The key to capital balance is in improving sub-cap objectives. You can balance caps all you want, but people want a return to small gang pvp. They need objectives in enemy space. Tasks that you can do if the enemy just docks up and spends an hour trying to form an "I WIN" bigger fleet. Think of Han Solo taking down the shield generator, so another fleet can attack something else. The options are endless. You could link constellations with objectives in each system, all of which can cripple the enemy's economy. Ways to destroy asteroid belts, decrease rat spawns, slow down moon and planet production, etc. Think outside the box... pewpew shouldn't be shooting a station, or hot dropping caps on one VNI.
---
Triglavian recently.

Vonhole is a AT ship killing machine!

Lady Scarlett are trying to find renters again...?

Good thing those carriers showed... might not have had the DPS to take that thing down.

You can change your default "warp to" distance as well.

I did the same thing with a 3d printer and our company logo. I completely hollowed the letters and then used it as a stencil to spray paint our logo onto boxes and stuff

translation to the "local language". Not all people speak english and even if they do, lots of them prefer their native language for complex things like eve
---
You are naive. I never even said one ounce of what you are claiming. I'm offering ways to re-kindle the love we all had for this game years ago. When small pvp was glorious and schmucks like you were still getting your diaper changed.  The game has evolved into what many players dislike. Sad to say, you are afraid of adapting to anything new. I pity you... I really do.

He better had used the lowsec gate in Stain...

Best ship, friendship.
---
Get some but don't let the corp take more than 12% in taxes or abuse newbros in any way. 
---
Fly safe.
---
At first yes. 
---
Focus on getting good Minmatar skills at first, as they can easily shield and armour tank depending on what you need. 
---
Get to T2 Minmatar Cruisers+frigates and depending what you do in Eve Battlecruiser &amp; battleship 4.
---
Then go go with what you want next,.
---
Thanks for the new wallpaper. 
---
I always find it funny by people saying "GAMES STILL RUNNING SO ITS NOT DEAD!!" 
---
Well no shit, Sherlock.  Games don't literally "die" until the company pulls the plug.  However, when a company stops giving a shit and meaningfully improving the product while putting it in maintenance mode, the odds of it recovering are very slim, and it spirals down on life support for potentially years until the company decides it isn't worth the server costs.  Many would argue EVE is at this point, and in the gaming field, that means the product is effectively dead.
---
Historically, very, VERY few products have been able to climb out of that hole, and CCP is not exactly showing anything to indicate they're any different.  No, fangirls, endless promises don't count.
---
3 days ....... like 3 days ........
---
then do the same to WHs.
---
What kind of role in PvP though? Huginns and Loki's (both minmatar) are considered great recons/T3 cruisers especially for fleet EWAR (webs) along with having the muninn which is another very strong ship, which is alpha damage focused. Armour or Shield tank. Projectiles can either be short to mid range dps autocannons Or high alpha long range artillery
---
Amarr have good neuting options in their recon ships and have some very tanky ships and generally lasers are pretty kite focused. Armour tanked
---
Gallente have the longest ranged warp disruption in their recon lineup along with the Ishtar and vexor which are both very solid ships. Armour tanked. Also the best option for PVE most of the time due to vexor navy issue/Ishtar/Dominic being great for ratting. Blasters are very high damage but very close range.
---
Caldari use ECM for EWAR but have some of the longest ranged ships in the game, so they can be used for sniping (especially the eagle). Shield tanked.
---
Additionally, if you're going to go into logistics (fleet healing/repair) amarr and caldari are capacitor chaining ships, scythe and oneiros are not, which makes them better in small engagements as they don't rely on a cap chain
---
Its like they got the opportunity of having a life, but dont take it....
---
Is there a particular reason why those ships are more useful in wh pvp?
---
Was a pretty good mate to fly with, we were both in Death by Design at the same time and had a lot of fun just doing small stupid shit. First time one of these posts was someone I knew....
---
CCP_Falcon, are you trying to save on lunch money by drinking the coolaid?  CCP didn't even pay the CCP employees to do the AT, so shush.  
---
You can talk about the next AT when CCP announces a date.
---
Glad you came to the conclusion I am right .. I stopped reading after that statement was made as the rest is just mindless waffle 
---
adding the two of them together is a net negative. dinos are so bad at eve honestly they should just get out of goons way. at least that would force goons to show up in something other than jackdaws to """"3rd party"""". 
---
asteros aint no joke 
---
Asteroid are beasts!
---
They're either not aware NC and Horde were neutral for some time, or just a line-goon who never left the echo chamber and spouts random shite.
---
thank for making delve ore price increase and thank for helping the delve excavater market healthy :))
---
Asteros are beast!
---
Right click, look at. You have to have drone models on
---
Not the rorquial bots
---
lol as if this makes even a DENT in our adapted military industrial complex, that's like a delve parsec you retard
---
But the reddit, with the bias, on erm... reddit
---
It's disgusting that EVE has turned into Rorqual online, in Providence we don't have rorquals and live an honest life but you can guarantee as soon as we get some of that spod gold CCP will nerf em. 
---
wow, you fucking fart huffers will never be happy will you? 
---
U R SO TRIGGRUED LMBO
---
So triggered Hahahaha 
---
If you want goons to show up in proper force, try invading Delve.
---
Not worth their time? It was Google translate level of Japanese. Some lore had romaji in the text, grammar was dying, etc.
---
I'm not buying anywhere close to the amount of man hours you are taking about.
---
Japanese DO play MMO. Eve was killed in the egg because Nexon was the only way to sub, and Nexon is aid and was making a pop up warning before downloading/paying "this game is impossible, no refunds, bought assets from Nexon can be stolen by other players" or something down this line.
---
"the game we used to like" loool, you got more joke like this ? x"D
---
So, you mean back when they were no damage cap, no fozziesov, no jump fattigue ? Back when the game was a giant blob with PL third party any cap fight, map split in half and all that shit ? You are so dumb you don't even realize CCP is already trying to make the game small gang friendly issue is... There is no such people in eve! Yes you guys are very vocal on reddit I give you that, it make me feel like I'm going to the zoo with your daily "CCPlease, I have this idea it will fix the game".
---
&gt;I'm offering ways to re-kindle the love we all had for this game years ago.
---
&gt;Sad to say, you are afraid of adapting to anything new
---
Stop projecting your own issue on me buddy
---
yonis'd or vonhole'd?
---
No matter how much you repeat this people will deny this
---
You sure about that?
---
Drones don't have skins, they have icons in practice. You can right click a drone and "look at" it if you really want to see it in action.
---
I thought eve is single shard, ie, only one location servers in London. What they are adding is localisation which is very different from adding servers in different locations 
---
&gt; This will hold them for a period of time until you can deliver them for free to any other station or citadel in the same system.
---
There is now a 15% fee for all asset-safety.
---
I cry every time I see pages and pages of blapped ships in a wormhole, I'd love and care for every single one of them until the day they day :(
---
I'm not, but I still agree with the idea. Would be good for the whole game.
---
&gt; Ooh so better keep my things in stations, right?
---
If you are going to setup a 'dump', do so in an NPC station.
---
Citadels are fine otherwise, just don't put all you own in one.
---
:)
---
vonhole'd this time :D 
---
&gt; Elite pvp right there, congrats, you are one step removed from mtu hunters.
---
Someone is not happy.
---
vote for removal of asset safety NOW!
---
I thought it was a cyno Prospect / Endurance for hot-drops.
---
Where in the settings is the transparency slider?
---
RememberMe! 1 year "is AT a thing?"
---
Geminate.  3 characters makes me about 250-300 every 2 weeks when I pick everything up.  I could rearrange my worst performer but I'm too lazy
---
The rigging skills usefulness really depend on exactly what rigs you plan on using. If you want to use rigs that come with fitting penalties, more levels are very beneficial. For most rigs though levels don't mean much. 
---
You act as if every citadel has a Gunner waiting. The Gunner list is usually pretty small on important infrastructure assets. 
---
I have camped ansiblex gates many times. And unless you are on like a staging system gate. It takes hours for someone with gunning rights to show up. 
---
Gates being bigger then regional gates. And enemies basically spawning at the edge of point range let alone being able to scram them before they got the gate is what's wrong. 
---
Then go into wormholes, there is no asset safety. Ur citadel gets destroyed everything drops into space. 
---
Anyone knows whats the difference between this OS and Spatial OS?
---
LOL, alternate history.
---
Twice as many bits, twice as many bots, grandad used to say
---
If you focus all you training on getting in one, it'll only take you like half a year to fly the ship with no fittings and no money to get one...
---
It's because we (Goons and TNT) have jacked the price of everything T2 up very, very high, on account of the fact that we control all major moongoo stockpiles, do the most reactions, and extract the most new R16+ moongoo, the lion's share of which never leaves Delve in its raw form.

All of these things are not related to ISK faucets except in incredibly indirect ways. They're related to *material faucets,* which are not the same thing.
---
This. I dont like the Dead co dudes, but the Sib dudes sure fleet up when is needed.
---
ok thanks. didnt know that! btw, water is wet
---
Are you?
---
Yay, now Our Dear Leader and the Exalted One, Kim Jong Un, can play EVE.

I wonder if Vonhole has tried to catch me yet
---
I think the thought of solo gets blown out. I've solo'd int he game for a pretty long time, with occasional fleet ups. I mean, you can play solo, but it's a good plan to get to know some people to help out because while it's just a video game..it is a pretty complex and in depth one.
---
Only if they follow through on it.
---
No, more like "resetting the server won't do shit, the same groups will reform, the only change is everyone has spent money on subscriptions, plex, and injectors for nothing- CCP has taken their money, and their game accounts"
---
you can definitely PVP using it -- you can make keyboard shortcuts for fast client switching if you read the docs. I think the trick to multibox pvp is finding things that don't need high apm, like bombers.
---
Yeah see that makes sense, the "400m a week" part of your original comment had me confused lol that's way higher than any p2 income I've ever seen
---
What zkill shows: A random mining ship is blown up in 2016.
---
What goons claim it shows: "There was this yuge battle, see, between all our enemies coz they hate each other, and they're all poopheads. And there were supercaps, or frigates, or something. And it happened yesterday, or very recently, or only a few years ago. And then this random mining ship blew up! It just blew up! Like, bang!"
---
"And that was a yuge disaster for our enemies, coz ... um, it just was. And that proves that goons are the bestest and everyone else isn't! So there!"
---
that's what happens where there is literally no other reason to join your alliance than to be a turbokrab, and they ain't even the top dog in that regard.
---
Op can have my babies
---
Remember him from my days in SEPR, o7 dude.
---
Getting scrammed legit equals death 99% of the time. So yeah, don't get scrammed is the strategy. If that's an issue for you then practice more.

Not free, there is a small fee (based off the price of

The item in question)
