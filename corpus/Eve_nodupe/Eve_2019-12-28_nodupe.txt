I would guess pirate factions fighting each other.
---

---
Like Serpentis &amp; Angels battling Guristas or Blood Raiders shooting Sansha's Nation.
---
Might need some tweaks on the lore but sounds like thing with great potential.
---
---
---
That's a proximate argument, but a bad one. Each of those mechanics as limited in range and sets up new strategy and tactics. They don't collapse space, so much as create new vectors through it. Even with jump drives, you still need to *move* your fleet in an essentially linear path, often plotting complex chains of hops through potentially dangerous territory.
---
Except you can’t krab the sovereignty level up. Plus, contrary to popular belief, not everyone enjoys krabbing. A bulk of my alliance mates hate doing it and the fact the game requires you to on an alliance scale to maintain ADM’s is super trash. Personal opinion, having sov based upon sitting static and krabbing to death isn’t good for the game
---
"Relax" is not an argument.
---
think of ships less like gear in other MMO games as there's no "final ultimate ship of smiting" to work for that you use all the time. instead it's more like gear in action games "this gear is for water world, this gear is for fire land"
---
To better clarify, the faction mods would just receive an increase in module HP, not have that linked with any kind of set bonus. This would add value to them individually as heat sponges if you only have one or a few of them, like faction armor plates or shield extenders.
---
A Hecate with all fed navy gear and a set bonus would be hilarious,  tho. XD
---
It's already happened.
---
Sad but likely very true. Also inadvertently when they patch that the boot.ini will self delete again.
---
Would be on market too, probably.
---
It is eve online! The most large-scale wars all of MMORPG games ever... what honourable brawl u are talking about? If we have 1 hundred people in our fleet t3 for example, and enemy will undock 40 Dreads, will be that fight are honourable?  Or, do we ask our players to not participate,  it will not be fair to them !  Such a game, as many as it plays !  This is not a tournament or an arcade game.
---
Going to join Volta :-)
---
Nope, it's dead.
---
Enoys aren't that bad, cmon. They can never be corax or astrate bad.
---
The entirety of Provibloc has no concept of what salt is.  Any chatter in local from the opposing side (or even random strangers flying through the system) is immediately and unequivocally identified as salt.  Other than a few exceptions, they are, to a man, complete and utter mongoloids without two brain cells to rub together.
---
Good luck Mcav! Y’all are going to need it.
---
Delve first.
---
give it a try and report back your results
---
Gib isk
---
Im of the belief that EVE is destined to be exactly what it is and nothing more. I had to come to that realisation for myself and move on a while back.
---
The guy who recruited you both into odin is a nerd
---
Didn't you come from mighty beans? Big think
---
I tried to explain, you refused to listen. Educate yourself a little in social science and consider asking people who know more about the subject than yourself. I can't force you to believe me.
---
Can you even fly an astarte?
---
It's a hisec complaint with nullsec attitude but wormhole payout.
---
wtf?
---
"Security" my ass
---
lol
---
Yeah, you're right! I'm gonna do it, dad! I'm gonna unite the world and get us off this rock and encounter a foreign species and then piss em off!
---
I would say there needs to be both. Proliferation has already happened, I mean, yeah, it's getting worse and that needs to be addressed, but what also needs to be addressed is the cancerously large amounts of roflcaps everyone and their mother has to throw around nowadays. The best way to get those numbers back down to a non obscene level is to integrate better content drivers. The 2nd best way is to make them a lot easier to kill, so that when they *do* get thrown around everywhere a lot more of them are dying.
---
Nerf fax reps further then they already have, cut titan and super ehp in half, and implement the other changes that people have talked about to help drive content and proliferation starts to become much less of an issue.
---
If is a fine gift, 3+ billion in Jita-currency  that you can name 2020 and leave in the hangar... Hovewer it is just a  blingy bait for an enemy:  
---
1) Where is Stasis Webifier? 673 pre-heat DPS better apply somewhere.  
---
2) Warp disruptor? Really?  Is this some sort of a prototype battleship tackler drake meta?   
---
3) It sports 191k\~ EHP with level 5 skills, with 74/79/84/87  resists across the board pre-heat which is kinda nice... I really hope those A-types won\`t drop from you unless your name is NewSecretSanta9000.  
---
4) 1525 m/s speed with MWD on means you need look for a target of similar speed if you want to get any kills.  
---
I understand it is a christmas gift, but i would keep that docked unless i can replace it with no emotions attached or having a fleet that comes to save you while you trying to be the best drake Eve Online has seen. Cheers.
---
A question came to my mind
---
Can light drones kill other light drones?
---
Context: got jumped by 2 asteros in my one astero.
---
If I could have killed some of their drones i would 1v2
---
I've been waiting almost a week for ccp to complete plex transfer, put in a support ticket and everything. Is there anything else I can do?
---
&gt;my enemies loot the field and i hope it makes every pilots day in the enemy fleet
---
1. I can get behind this. Double the meme-capacity!
---
2. Great! At least it will go down killing something... or at least writing itself in many killmails.
---
3. No comments. Have fun!
---
chvvvvcc
---
I'm the one guilty of this particular gift. I'm still not 100% sure what possessed me to put A-types on a drake, but after my CEO said "DO IT" I had no choice, the Solid Gold Dumpster must fly!!!
---
If that's the worst PVP ship that you can think of, you obviously haven't done much with it.
---
&gt;they are, to a man
---
&gt; Other than a few exceptions
---
Your writing needs work
---
Come out public with this, don't be a coward.
---
imagine all the things you could do if you wouldnt have to wait out a gazillion session timers...
---
Someone was quitting eve, just loaded up everything he had into a bunch of blops battleships, and decided to go out with a bang
---
Confirmed, [Gloryhammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkUAzcja74Y) is based in the Eve Online universe
---
please!!!
---
What the fuck
---
Join Pandemic Horde! You can start with Pandemic Horde HighSec Division if you're not ready to move to null. Great people and atmosphere and super helpful for new players.
---
200???? Shit I got the whole series I wonder how much I can get
---
the navy drake is actually really solid nanogang ship, great range and application with heavy missiles, and it's decently quick for a battlecruiser
---
there are *much* worse pvp ships, even within the realm of ships that are decent for pvp
---
What if both sides bring rifters?
---
Pandemic Horde!
---
https://imgur.com/a/R3ABlVn
---
I mean, you sure your willing to undock and come help him?
---
Someone might have quitted the game i think
---
Guys, if you want to leave eve in great balls of fire, buy titans and dunk them in lolsec!
---
Take them away from the game! (:

Nighthawk
---
To contribute to the games success by ensuring that it has a secure financial foundation. That is what you get from Omega.
---
Alpha clones were a mistake.
---
"Never look back" but still read and answer on the game subreddit
---
Yeah sure buddy
---
Specifically, Omega let's you train faster and use more skills at higher levels.
---
Ships, modules, etc are locked behind those skills.
---
Omega unlocks the true game.
---
Alpha is just an extended trial.
---
Sure, you provided a logical argument with no supporting evidence.
---
EVE has many other things to it than just combat. Alpha accounts only have access to T1 ships and only upto T2 medium ammo on top of an SP restriction of 5 million. T2 is a specialized tier where you can find ships dedicated to one thing only (bombers, electronic attack ships, recon and black ops, etc).
---
With omega you can unlock training for all those ships as well as remove the SP restriction. Not only that, it let's you have access to other playstyles of eve too, other than combat. Dedicated mining, planetary production, marketing and industry, reconnaissance, etc.
---
Yeah, i think i was the first one to get scram on them, and I did that by warping an AB double plated aug navy onto grid at 30km from them and just burning in until i had a scram. And with the ECM burst on them they probably could have broken tackle and warped out, but they didn't do that either
---
I'll give you three fiddy
---
The we form Volta numbers is proof that every nullsec alliance should have a dedicated sig to using wormholes to pop out and kill people.
---
That Volta Stat is crazy how efficient you fellas are.
---
Hopefully, one day, this game will go back to the good days.
---
I'll save y'all seats, just in case.
---
I started Eve when I was 14 and I've been playing off and on since. I'm 23 now.
---
They do accept credit card directly.
---
The issue is that you have steam accounts.
---
thank you
---
m
---
Well a week is under the 10 days it can often take.
---
Not necessarily where, but who to go live with.
---
New players who want to live in null can go for Karmafleet, Brave Newbies, or Pandemic Horde. Can't say for wormholes.
---
Oh and whatever you do, if you get an invite from a hi-sec alliance like "Incompetent and Proud" or "CONOCO" please ignore those.
---
i blame POS code
---
Oh wait removal of perma cloak would hit your over 9000 afk alts gameplay? No it cant be... 
---
&amp;#x200B;

And of all you complaining the widows have no role anymore...
---
I've seen Nighthawk as a links ship when people go with a DNI fleet for a wormhole brawl.
---
Nowhere else.
---
Rorqs can PvP pretty well
---
Can we just get active dscan already... These ships surely have the tech... I mean we can teleport other ships but nav computer can't auto update scanners?
---
That fit is hot garbage
---
&gt;  something smart
---
guaranteed to never be a feature now, thanks man
---
Sure, I don't disagree.
---
You mostly buy training thus SP. If you train on optimal mapping and implants you get nearly 2m SP per 30 days (to be precise (27+5 + (21+5)/2)*60*24*30 = 1944000). If you extract those, sell them and buy PLEX you nearly have enough for 30 days omega (exact stuff varies a bit with the market. atm you have to consider that you get a lot of SP through logging in too). This means the bit of extra isk you have to pay (last time I calculated it was 300m isk per 30 days) is the market value of the omega status while the other amount is the value of the skills you train while being omega. (It's not a perfect model but it roughly explains to people what omega really is about.)
---
I agree, current akternative is to anchor more citadels but that’s quite a hassle, also when you wanna switch clones.
---
No pants also makes your ship 4% faster.
---
I spent a pretty unhealthy amount of time on Kugu and Eve politics in general. I saw "VIRI" and was like "NO GET THAT FUCKING AVATAR OUT OF MY BRAIN"
---
Titans are the easiest ship in the game
---
What was CCP's *stated* purpose behind the "industrial cyno" business? I've looked through their dev blogs and couldn't find anything but some nonsense about allowing cyno vigils. Oh, and salt, endless salt.
---
I would have agreed to this several years ago. But currently the situation is horrible because almost all competent subcapital FC's have quit the game. We need content creators to undock and this has been awesome. And this will breed a new generation of FC's.
---
Total setup costs for a C5 WH with a Fortizar will run you around 40 bil (dreads and fits, rolling carrier, rolling ships, the fort itself, various other bits and pieces to make your life easier) and you will earn ~1Bil ISK/hr multiboxing the dreads by yourself to run sites. The main limitation is the number of sites that spawn and how long until you get new respawns, so there is a cap on how much you can pull from a single hole in a given week/month. If you want even more ISK you can move up to a C6 but you are better off sharing with another person, each of you can dualbox/triplebox dreads and also add in a rorq or two to handle rats that start orbiting and become difficult to track with dread guns. 
---
There are plenty of C5s in the game and although you may need to clear some abandoned structures you will probably find an empty one. Hostiles rolling for you are the biggest threat but since there are 512 C5 holes your chance of being rolled into are quite small depending on the number of groups active with a C5 static when you krab. 
---
C6s are significantly more coveted and you'll likely have to evict someone to take one. There's also a significant risk of you being evicted in the future by someone who wants it for themselves.
---
Lol my goodness. Seems logical given the Plex exchange rate.
---
It puts into perspective the articles of apha players claming to "make hundreds of millions of ISKs in a couple of weeks", it's easy if the average players are trading billions on a daily basis.
---
Well that’s why faction titans cost around 350-400bil
---
Why was the rorqual there alone in the first place then?
---
[removed]
---
&gt; CCPlease an auto-win and auto-everything button as well. Bcs Eve is so hard and has to be auto-easy for mouthbreathers.. :(
---
Because the challenge presented by 1 clone per citadel really adds so much to the overall challenge of eve.
---
lol. You need aggro  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDfKI24pkdU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDfKI24pkdU) 
---
The bug that keeps aggro even you warp off/warp away from sleepers range is another thing.
---
If you just warp at annom at lets say 500 km without triggering aggro it wont work.
---
All options needs at least several billions to start with:
---
Option 1:
---
Burner Missions in Highsec ~350m ISK/h, roughly 3b in ships to start with
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1knVqZEH8qFY0eT44nMEFwcKd3t4PbgcZeuv58SVUxsI/pub
---
and
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SAv6bnGM-5etLoPHxVtCsbsz8Q8feN5CFSEgUZclPLI/pub
---
Option 2:
---
Multi Rorquals in 0.0 ~100m ISK/h per Rorqual, whatever a Rorqual costs this time
---
Option 3:
---
Trading: The sky is the limit depending on how much starting ISK you have. Be aware trading is PvP without ships you can lose billions in a very short time if you have no clue at all.
---
Back in the day around 2011 i made 5-8b per week with 7h to 14h per week. Today you can only reach that number with PLEX or Skill Injector trading.
---
lol they didn't reform, just warped to 9uy gate thought about it and warped back in the same fleet with the dreads on grid? but i'm sure you probably weren't there so?
---
no it really isnt
---
Inflation Online
---
If what you're looking for is a guide on what to do in EVE, don't measure your experience in IPH. Use ISK-earning activities as a way to fund what you find fun, don't focus on trying to make the biggest pile of ISK for the sake of having a giant pile of ISK.
---
If you're looking for an academic assessment of the state of the game, there's a few good ISK-earners out there. The best ISK you'll make in highsec is probably Incursions, these will net you \~120-200Mn IPH, depending on how good the site spawns are and how good the fleet is. Investment to get into this is \~150Mn minimum for something like a Rokh, though you'll ideally want to buy a Vindi (\~800-900Mn) and/or a logi (\~300-500Mn) to be able to meaningfully contribute to the fleet.
---
In nullsec, it depends on if you have caps or subcaps. I haven't done subcap ratting in null for a while, but IIRC a Myrm will run you \~60Mn and net you \~100Mn IPH. The amount of bang for your buck escalates, obviously, and I'd assume you could run Rock Havens in a rail Vindi and get \~200Mn IPH. As for capital ratting, carrier ratting in Rock Havens will net you on the order of \~1Bn IPH, IIRC. Super ratting is even more lucrative and will get you well past that number, proportional of course to the amount of ISK you put in. I admit my null numbers are shaky at best since it's been a year since I really lived out there.
---
In wormhole space, there's a pretty damn decent amount to be made, though obviously the risk is greater. You can do Garrisons with two 'shaks and a Nestor at the same speed as a dread, pull in 1.6Bn IPH for the whole fleet or 550Mn IPH per character. If you run your own krabhole you can stock up on sites (since when they're run they respawn randomly in the same region and persist until cleared, leading to them clumping up in lower-traffic holes) and one-cycle them with 3-4 dreads, make 3Bn IPH. That's about the most you'll make from a single setup, though, everything more than that is just a case of scaling it up.
---
good fit
---
By Gojira right ?
---
I thought my billion Isk would make my return easy but I'm starting to doubt about it :)
---
Did they get a director level spy to unfit your fortizar tho?
---
after all the 3d printed crap we see on this subreddit, this is a sight for sore eyes
---
More like made sure to correctly manage citadel unfitting access...
---
1 titan, 2 supers, 20b of subcaps, 300b liquid.
---
again.
---
We are not the entirety of Provi bloc. This was the tale of a single corps roam, GF i guess, not sure why your posting this in here ?
---
Eviction are always dirty 
---
No one cares about bushido in those moment, people only care to dunk the enemy and to bring as many people they can to help attacking/defending
---
Only on a high tier moon.
---
You can't fly caps in highsec.
---
You can't fly caps anywhere outside of nullsec supercap umbrella either.
---
Caps need shitload of skills and most of subcaps don't.
---
Also caps are for losers.
---
[fast as fuck](https://youtu.be/Xw1k20DpHfA)
---
I'm a newbro, could somebody give me the story on why the Drake has become a meme? I've heard the classic "Can I bring my Drake", but no idea where that comes from.
---
I really don't get this kind of answer.  
---
I mean, we ALREADY have permanent D-Scan. We have to press a button, but there is no limitation.  
---
The only actual difference would be that the player does not press the button again and again. The permanent scan is already what currently happen.  
---
No idea how you'd imagine that it would somehow change anything related to safety.
---
I mean it's not unrealistic.  Mach warps super fast, land on grid, warp to the anomaly, about 10-20 seconds to clear the 3 waves, 1 minute respawn, repeat.  30 is doable with 20-25 easily done
---
You don't need 2/3 dreads for high class WH sites. You can do it with a single dread. But 3 dreads are a sweetspot because 3 dreads can finish the site in one siege circle. That also means you don't gain additional value by more dreads because I doubt you are mentally capable to run with 6 dreads in 2 different sites in parallel.
---
Smartbomb machs?
---
Highsec?
---
He is smartbombing in highsec. Next income option is to find out where he is doing that get him killed and grab the loot ;)
---
That will teach em not to bash u defended citadels in gallente spacd
---
If you warp to the anomaly you can easily turn off the smart bombs before anyone can get to you
---
I've always wondered at clothing in the game considering you are just wearing underwear in your pod as you can see when you get podded.
---
Probably not, you’ll spend thar time scanning down your chain and hunting for content
---
Didn't they mega nerf their ability to be a drone beast?
---
Crazy. Stab is a great fleet ship for anti tackle.
---
Alone though is a different story.
---
You know, you should have sent him an Iteron with a T3 turret lol
---
Rusted for her pleasure.
---
idk I don't fly caps any more.  But I see them being used a lot.
---
Ofc I have 5.0
---
How about just leave shit alone!
---
I take a lot of breaks from EVE and sometimes I'll come back to find that a shop that used to be good is utter trash and vice versa
---
Just make sure you bring more than two to a PGL fleet for the love of God
---
It waa the starter pack that was given out for free upto dec 21st. I added it to the library it shows that it is installed. Its been like more than a week.
---
Now you should self destruct your Reddit account.
---
ok
---
I dont know why but something about the mouth area reminds me of CCP Burger...
---
Kudos for taking the loss and hopping back in! That’s the way to do it
---
you never really mentioned how the game is about camping gates and waiting for other players to appear there and killing them. It's got a very common name for that "strategy" in every other game but there's this taboo about it in Eve and nobody mentions this extremely common activity or uses the common term to describe it that every other game does.
---
You never see it in any of the trailers, you never see it in any screenshots, and you never see it even mentioned in any of these "useful" comments but that is what Eve is going to be like for new players: just a bunch of other players spawn camping gates. That's Eve.
---
&gt; But Linux offers me more control over my OS and more flexibility to do what I want. It's better for programming, and there aren't really all that many trade-offs anymore since 90% of my games work perfectly well on Linux and the other 10% don't take all that much effort to make work unless they're literally hard-coded to break when not running on Windows.
---
None of this is needed or acceptable to the average user. You've got a really narrow view point as a programmer. As long as games don't run out of the box on Linux, people won't switch.
---
there is one that should hopefully be posted soon. The avatar died in a minute and 20 seconds so kind of a quick one.

---
FTFY
---
I guess you wear it in station maybe. And for your holographic portraits so if someone really really cares about you and clicks through on your character page they have something to look at.
---
&gt; But if feels like fighting a cancer with a cancer. 
---
I agree with this. But its not just about places which "shut down" due to campers. Those folks rely only on local for safety and that's why they cease activity. 
---
I camp Delve. They couldn't care less about neutrals in local wrt farming. The main use in Delve is maintaining the surprise element. You typically have 2 minutes or less to kill a Rorqual or a super. And you purchase that time by relying on the fact that the standing fleet isn't pinged and alert. The moment you begin active hunting you lose that advantage. So unless there is a serious fuck up from the PvE'r side, thats the only way you kill Rorquals and supers inside that umbrella. The access condition to Delve super-killing being special dudes like me permacamping their entire region is what makes it super safe place to farm to begin with.
---
So when a day comes and CCP gives active hunters new ways to maintain that element of surprise in heavy umbrella regions, and they give them ways to somehow circumvent the current instant-intel local to sometimes catch targets, I and other campers I know are willing to give up our campers. We don't like the sheer gruntwork involved in maintaining this many accounts either.
---
See, each barrel is quantumly entangled with the barrel next to it, so each of the 4 barrels exist in a superposition at the same time of firing, not firing, loaded, not loaded, overheated, and shitfit.
---
You have an attitude problem
---
then give me your isk and quit
---
That's fine you can work it out, earning income will not take long, and if you set your expectations you can balance your play time around a few hours a week.
---
Join a big new bro Corp like pandemic horde or brave, use them to work out the game, make friends. They will always have content when you log in as they are so large. When you work out the direction you want to go, have a little isk nest egg, also have a list of good corps, consider changing to a smaller more personal corp.
---
Missions could use an eye cast over them at some point I guess
---
You dunked him, he dont even have a response after that
---
And the application bonus if i recall correctly, so you lose a lot of potential right there. 
---
RLML Drake is kind of a noob trap tbh
---
Oh my dear summer child
---
do you have any idea how inane you sound? you literally want people to double/triple/quadruple stock stock everything that they need in every citadel that they have a clone in? sure, I'm gonna put my drugs, ammo, paste, flex modules etc in every single citadel that holds a pod. Let alone that I have midgrade and highgrade of the same sets, snakes, amulets etc, depending on what the risk assesment of what I'm flying against is, I should probably go ahead and double or triple stock all my ships as well, right?
---
you're an idiot lmao
---
U can always suicide gank them?
---
MCAV are a C5 wormhole corp. They are known for "flying kitey bullshit" (thanks Jack Haamilton) and this is typified by their flying of the enyo. Pretty much any situation they find themselves in will result in at least one nerd in an Enyo.
---
At the moment they are being evicted from their home by Inner Hell. In a cap fight where MCAV and allies lost 130bil in ships, this guy stayed true to what he believes in. This dude went down the MCAV way.

Press F to pay respects.

I've stopped playing EVE for now, but the Christmas stuff was already happening - so I made this anyway. Maybe I'll be active again next Christmas season; and maybe I'll make another one of these - but it's in no way planned as part of something bigger.

Honestly, grab yourself Photoshop and get to work - the general layout is easy if you stick to shapes and symmetry like I did, and colours you fiddle with until they look good. Probably don't even need Photoshop, Paint.net should suffice!
---
this post is dull, why would you ever waste everyone's time posting it?

You cared enough to complain about how someone is still having fun even though you quit because you weren't having fun. Maybe you should have tried MCAV instead and actually had some fun.
