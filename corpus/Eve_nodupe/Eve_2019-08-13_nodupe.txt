You can’t cloak in abyssals. The main way people ransom ships is by using a cheap kiting ship that can’t be caught and can out range the enemy. This is extremely hard to do in practice as most bling abyssal pvp ships come equipped with insanely long abyssal webs so you’ll get caught eventually. However some ships can be more vulnerable like AB ships with poor projection or drones that can be killed.
---
---
---
I imagine it will only be a brief lapse before bots evolve, plenty of methods to do this. Nullsec has taken a massive hit. I don't think it's going to be an improvement to game long term. I can't be arse to scout myself about anymore. So let's see where we end up this time!
---
People will do them in even safer places then making the sec loss just a general pain. The sites are already risky enough, especially those weird leshak spawns and future unannounced additions to abyssal deadsoace that risk losing your expensive  ship. Even now without suspect timers, its not uncommon to get suicide banked because the very ships flying t4/5 rarely are cheaper than 500mil and 1bil + is very common. All in all, hard no to suspect timers.
---
Guess you got unlucky.. I only ever faced small gangs chasing me around and setting bait ships
---
I go to school in Baltimore!
---
You're not fucking wrong, no clue why you're getting downvoted.

---
&amp;#x200B;

wormholerbtw
---
&gt; A small corp likely doesn't have the numbers to fight many roaming bombers/T3C's. If there are too many nearby, you can either undock and die, or stay docked. 
---
blackout didn't change that
---
&gt; Many people have limited hours to play. They can't wait till optimal corp hours to get numbers up so they can actually fight back.
---
blackout didn't change that?
---
&gt; There is a lot of risk and fuck all reward in null right now, unless you're part of a decent size alliance.
---
that has been the case for *years* already in sov null, blackout didn't change that, at least when talking about sov specific null activities.
---
When you wrote that whole thing, especially the bit about sitting on the beach with a friend sipping sweet cold drinks on the beach, did your farts smell ok? Surely their sweet aroma helped you write this beautiful treatise.
---
&gt; They literally unblued each other for a fight, 
---
Not actually what happened. We had no real idea what they were doing and certainly didn’t unblue them ahead of time.
---
&gt; Happens all the fucking time among coalition members.
---
Agreed. As I stated, this is what happens when you have alliances in your coalition that aren’t pets. Sometimes they do things they want to do without letting you know first, causing confusion.
---
&gt; Not sure what angle you are trying to drive here tbh.
---
My point is that the narratives about this being remotely newsworthy are stupid because the actual story is boring AF.
---
Literally there’s nothing interesting here.
---
On the other hand:there could have been. Wouldn’t have been the first time Frat had reset us, but that’s not what happened. Literally the unblue was because there wasn’t anyone from Frat to explain what the duck exactly was going on, and to my knowledge nobody in Horde or coalition leadership are fucking mind readers.
---
The whole "you are constantly at risk and consenting to pvp" thing would be more palatable if you didn't "have" to fit your ship specifically for ratting and could feasibly fight back. Constantly being at risk of getting into a fair fight in which your skills determine whether or not you die is an entirely different matter from the way it currently works, and is a situation I would wholeheartedly embrace.
---
CCP seems to have had a similar idea in the past, when they designed factional warfare - you engage in lucrative lowsec pve activity while pvp fit, which was probably expected to generate actual fights instead of the ganks that plague other forms of pve.
---
Of course, FW didn't work out quite as planned, but can you imagine how amazing this game would be if CCP actually managed to pull something like that off?
---
there is a difference between balanced and easy. I want balance. good caps are hard to kill in a small gang so if you suspect cap fleet support you might as well not even try
---
Wrong, t3 sites also have proving conduit
---
Sorry Squizz, I find gstatic extra creepy.  
---
Maybe you could sell some keychains for supernerds to celebrate dunking rare pixels.
---
delete this!
---
Scanning that far out is very unlikely.
---
That and a few other things, someone made a post about it few months ago.
---
Found the spodbrain.
---
I was trying to BM that wreck and was 80km away when it despawned
---
Only when telling others about our hobby
---
Whats is the use of the drones "Hornet EC-300" in exploration? I'm using an Asteros btw
---
They meant, never take a vacation without taking them too
---
Who said anything about dying? Thats what you dont get. Why would people choose to be content for brainless gankers who need more and more advantages? And supers were dying before the BO as well, its nothing new. It just required finess.
---
goodmeme, but no, it was 2008 ish
---
When it comes to RL work, and your (humour deprived) boss asks how the weekend went, how would you explain "well, I held up a guys ship, offered a ransom, was refused, then sold his corpse back. He was mad as hell"
---
&gt; But the rewards are exponentially higher in wormholes than in null
---
[citation needed]
---
Listen dude, saying the truth will always make bring one mockery. Thats how the world works.
---
And wow, sorry for not being all up in arms for him saying obvious things.
---
Rich, coming from a carebear.
---
Most of EVE is about baiting.
---
Oh you want to kill my small cute maulus? Oh actually it does 250dps and I've got crystals implants.
---
I'm gonna make you feel like you can scram kite me and.. I actually got snakes.
---
The rest of the fun is the enemy making errors. And people attacking anything with anything without fear of losing
---
Well carriers atleast. But ye true.
---
No, what changed is that you can get tackled a shitton easier without any counter. Thats the change. Now every retard can tackle you, doesnt require any skill.
---
Dude, please dont try to teach me obvious things and ending by saying these things are not for you. Its such a shitty argument over something that is mearly a test. It didnt stop the other side from constantly bitching and doing so even now in regards to nerfing NS so they can get prey more easily did it? One could argue that NS wasnt for bitches trying to kill VNIs as well.
---
T5s are already risky enough without the timer. Run into a full neut room? 3b gone. Get ganked by 2 nados? 3b gone. Disconnect for 30 secs? 3b gone.
---
Dude it really really isnt.
---
Actually I asked you how to go about ratting in high traffic areas. You stated "you don't"
---

---
dont see HIC's closing holes on there.
---
as most competent WH corps will adapt quite quickly, NS will be up in arms that they gave us more content
---
True. 
---
But if zkill is saying less shit is dying, then less shit is dying.
---
Is this one of those things where you project yourself onto me?  How am I a carebear?
---
Although this is true (people not running it), it was and still is safer to just be at a deep safe in a random null/low/WH system to run abyssals.  Honestly putting the suspect timer back will probably cause less blingy ganks because retards will just stop running them in jita/perimeter and getting blapped by tornadoes.
---
I could have sworn there wasn't any stopping you from doing this. Couldn't locate it in any patch notes or other documentation. Got a link for me?
---
No really? Then why did he use procurer as an example as defence when the guy is talking about how 90 bombers are dropping. My response wasnt at all directed towards how comical that was?
---
That.. deserves  an upvote
---
Thats a nice 'yak. What kind?
---
Join PL, they keep having to move.
---
don't bother with this guy, this is his killboard: https://zkillboard.com/character/96927124/
---
he's been complaining about "not finding anything but ganks" since bo released, whenroughly 2/3 of his fleets pre blackout are 40 man jackdaw/harpy home defense  and the other 1/3 are gon bloc blob. He's just projecting this concept of finding fights and blaming his lack of ability in the event
---
Wormholers just shouldn't exist. CCP should get rid of wormholes and ban everyone who ever lived there, and add a module that only I can use that instantly decloaks every ship around me, destroys every bomb, and blows up every bomber, with a 1-second cycle time. If CCP keeps refusing to balance the game like this then I'll unsub every single one of my 29.5 accounts!
---
Setup flex.
---
Vale is more US time zone and Tribute is more EUTZ content wise.
---
even 60/hr still seems undervalued  
---
I don't work contracting, but if my company ever does assign developers to client specific work its at $150/hr cad = \~$113/hr usd with $300 for the first 30 minutes.  
---
But maybe that is just inflated because we only do that when a client has a problem which should be solved by a third party, but they want to use us instead. (Database corrupted because you decided to run your own IT and did it poorly without backups? thats going to cost you...)
---
I agree with what you are saying. Except for the fact that the blackout removed said protection, local. Thats the only thing it did, it removed the only counter to many things without introducing new counters.
---
So it is the blackout. If you change x and it immediately leads to y then its safe to assume that x is at fault.
---
To socialize, build relationships and trust within the Corp, and to make time pass faster.
---
How do you know?
---
I looked the zkill and.. it tells such a story! It's so cool. The guy killed the same venture over and over for days with frigates, then one day with a fucking chameleon
---
The supers don't need the newbro watching the gate for them. They don't care about ~elite pvp'ers~ looking for easy ganks. The only people who need intel are the poor shmoks who dont have the isk or skills to fly supers.
---
Sir that's a dread
---
Nothing you listed raises the adms for your sov in sov null.  That's really the sov null issue.
---
An AT match was won by ramming a MJD battleship at the beginning. Some frigate came like a bat outta hell and made it turn around.
---
so true, maybe they should remove asset safety in WH's... oh wait.  
---
or maybe they should remove bounty payments from WH's... oh wait.  
---
MAYBE they should make it so another corp/alliance can connect to you at any time...oh wait.  
---
but seriously anything CCP wants to throw at us is welcome. any competent WH corp will adapt and those that don't shouldn't be there.
---
I thought you moved on?
---
" It is good but not for null. The increase in traffic in lowsec is noticable." You are talking about an increase due to the BO being bad for null but good for others. Which means you find a correlation between null and LS having issues.
---
This isnt brainsurgery. If this isnt what you meant then correct your statements to reflect what you actually mean. Words do matter.
---
You fucker come to Amamake
---
Blackout did change it though.  Nothing stops someone from leaving a bomber in every system in a region logged out, looking at the in game maps for targets, and logging in that bomber at a safe off dscan and cloaking til a tackle.
---
Because you're not just mining in belts. You are bullshitting on comms and building relationships.
---
An added bonus is that you can share all your ideas on the best way to do whatever you are doing.
---
Nobody cares about Waffles as much as they do dude. Their egos are suuuuuuuuuuuper big and they cant handle anything that threatens it. Which is why its so fun to mess with them. 
---
Cause they respond with random shit thinking they are superclever.
---
Gave me something to do during my lunch at work today so thanks for that!
---
Do you think that's because provi forces \[the small gangs\] out or because there are other groups that follow every small gang around looking to drop on any reasonable response?
---
Go back to Jita local and stay there.
---
great now I have water all over my monitor.
---
Which literally means nothing. I mean that was the entire fking point of the blackout. But how many times do you think you will catch that blingier ship? Before they decide its not worth it anymore.
---
Thats what the word decline means.
---
I will try it, thanks for the reply!

Chat on game is not much better, I had a guy say "BRUH" not in an ironic way. I died inside a little.
---
What the fuck is a squad leader?
---
&gt; Super ratting is the least safe
---
It's pretty safe if you are under an umbrella. The EHP of supers means you have at least a couple minutes for help to jump in through a cyno. Remember the cynojammer only prevents new cynos, it doesn't shut off existing ones.
---
I thought we were just exchanging random epithets, my dude. I am sorry, I did not mean to hurt your fragile ego by calling you a carebear.
---
hey its atticus
---
it was super fun lol. first time i actually got to use my monitor too. looking forward to future brawls :D
---
Waffles lives in a hole and hunts in hull, with income being supplemented from elsewhere. It's not quite the same as "nullsec residents".
---
Blackout is fantastic for groups like Waffles.
---
Its good for the small offensive PvP outfit but not for the small defensive null outfit that is trying to grow. But since the PvPers rarely live in null it makes the blackout a good change for everyone but the people in null.
---
Ye lets break more things. Cause that will certainly get all the people back into the game. I mean, whats the end game here? What do you think will get accomplished?
---
[removed]
---
Its a shitty argument. Placing bots and afk ratters in the same category. And youre assuming way too much, zkill doesnt even back you up.
---
https://i.ibb.co/YDsXfTM/botting-before-after-etd2.jpg
---
Aeon isn't actually in this shot, it was fairly boring to look at compared to the fighters.
---
Dunno if you are being sarcastic or not.
---
The procucer was never the issue.
---
I was intoxicated while writing it.
---
Literally not of that shit matters because they are so easy to fix. Asset saftey is means Jack shit without supers because most wormholes could replace there shit in almost no time at all. Bounties mean nothing and unless you are c5 space getting rolled into means "on on I have to suicide roll my alpha alts into this wormhole and then not worry about anything because I have 20 more because you can Male alpha rolling alts for free"
---
Totally dudes. They cant handle it soooooooooo much they sit on coms totally talking about what people like Maria_Tokila thinks. They're all like "That Maria_Tokila is suuuuuuuuuuuuuper import! Did you hear what they said!".
---
All the time bro.
---
It's too much work and risk, it was already easy to die in a carrier, super, or rorq, now it's way easy and the rewards are shit. Ratting and mining require you to pay attention. I dont get where people keep saying it's all afk. Unfortunately, it wasn't the weak that quit, but alot of people who were putting money into the game. Now all you have left are people who want low effort kills and when there is no one left to hunt but the hunters, players will drop like flies because of the lack of content and a pay wall. Its gonna be hilarious.
---
Pro tip, there is no one there cause no ones logging in lol
---
&gt; Supers are not scalable and give less money than a solo dread in a wormhole, or a fucking gila in an abyssal site.
---
wh dreads will die if caught by anyone looking to kill it rolling in no matter what you do, are like 4b each and can't farm as much as he wants since sites are limited, you also dedicate a dread capable toon for each. The gilas in abyssal sites that give more money than super ratting are *very* expensive, require pods and quite easy to lose, neither of those methods are scalable either. Although i'm not a fan of the lack of outside risk in abyssals either.
---
&gt; Supers are not that much safe against big bombing fleets or dreadbombs, especially with the fits you could see people using.
---
how do you even manage to get caught in a super for that dread bomb to come in? you can literally see bubbles and sabres on dscan, and those are the only things that could hold you long enough to kill ya. Super ratting is just safe to an extreme degree, the only way you die is fucking up massively.
---
This is the only one I know, crazy good:  [https://invadingyourhole.blogspot.com/2015/02/shattered-wormhole-backpacking-trip-day.html](https://invadingyourhole.blogspot.com/2015/02/shattered-wormhole-backpacking-trip-day.html)   
---
\-The blog link there is the best one I know of for C13 living. The only possible change I'd make would be to use a hauling character to haul your stuff out so as to not compromise your main site running. A porpoise is best as it  has a 5km3 fleet hangar and 500-600 cargo bay and a 60km3 ore hangar if you decide to gas harvest. the next best option is a max hauling fit magnate, which can carry 1,750m3 for only 10mil. A confessor can hold more if fit for max hauling but you might as well go for a magnate as it's a 5th of the price when fully fit for this
---
\-Confessor/Hecate are the best for ratting, the confessor better and the hecate almost as good but better at warping off a small fleet of reds land on top of you. For alphas a blaster fit incursus will work for ratting and I think a pulse laser punisher might work, but I've only tested a blaster incursus. As long as you have an AB with kiting and are using an armor repairer you can clear the sites. Turrets can be tricky sometimes but you can still make it with a T1 frig. If you only wanna run explo and hunt in the C13 then use a blaster, armor repping pacifier.
---
\-Remember to have a seed to scan you back in, I always had 2 seeds. If I had lost both my seeds then I'd have lost my main site runner and would be down to my hauler, in which case whoever was hunting me did well and I done messed up badly. 
---
\-Giant secure containers are your friend and anchor them around the system based off of safes built from despawned anomalies/signatures. Someone can still get to your secure containers but they'll have to wait a few days to a few weeks before an anomaly/signature spawns at the same spot to be able to get to your secure container, or spawns closely enough to triangulate it.
---
\-Bring multiple mobile depots for fitting and each ship must have a mobile depot in it's cargo with probes and launcher or have the probes and launcher fitted at all times. Leave the extra mobile depots in the porpoise.
---
I lived like this for the past year and loved it. You will have roughly 11+ sites spawning a day, with a few relic, few data, and few anomalies for ratting. Gas sites don't spawn so rapidly as they aren't getting ran accross all C13s too much, otherwise they'd be spawning at faster intervals. I had a Ukranian guy who only wanted to harvest gas, so he was running them every time in his venture when he was on. He'd drop the gas in his designated secure containers and everyone else in the corp would do the same. I'd haul stuff once a week unless they filled it up early. As a group you'll need a dedicated group, and new pilots coming on need to be willing to learn to properly live in a C13. You can refit, but you can't reship sadly so taking fights is tough if you wanna go fleet to fleet with someone. Solo though it is one epic place to live.  
---
Fly Safe o7,

---
Just realized I actually got the Aeon in this shot, center of the fighters.  Fighters were much more interesting to look at
---
I'm not offended, just confused by your response.  Thanks for clarifying.
---
Ofc, but Im seeing price increases in loot that typically isnt used in abyssal ships. And people will roll less when the price goes up, not more.
---
&gt; Ask wormhole people what would happen if you were removing their ability to close holes to farm in peace
---
you can't really close statics unless you scan and roll it out every minute and a half, and you can't even see the sig of wandering holes with the entrance on the other side before the guys on the other side warp to it in the first place
---
Ah thats sweet. Hope you enjoyed yourself.
---
if none of that shit matters then maybe it should be applied to null sec too
---
as for replacing that shit in no time at all, the logistics involved in replacing structures and caps isnt nothing with mass limits on holes.
---
not to mention anyone can connect to you at any time while you are onlining your structures.  
---
and the suicide alpha rolling thing is kinda correct apart from the fact that any attacking corp will just bubble the hole and eat your alpha rolling ships for breakfast and want more. 
---
you could make a better argument for nullified luxury yachts being used to roll and i would support you in that. but you clearly only have the vaguest idea of how WH space works.
---
There is no way you can say something like this. Like literally no way without years of data research. But if you have it, Im willing to listen.
---
I never said I didn't like playing with them.
---
"Why can't I do high reward activities with zero risk by myself in an mmo?? It's not fair!!!"
---
Always wished you could set the bombs launch speed. Like 0 m/s all the way to the current max speed.
---
Just make the rep amount sig based. Make it rep about half of what it does now on a cap, a bit more than a Guardian on a cruiser, and a bit more than a Deacon on a frigate. Problem solved.
---
They do things that I like.
---
Somebody doesn't know how to read.
---
Ow:( Feels like thats the way with a lot of games nowadays tho. Trying out BDO and seems you really cant f2p even when you buy the game. Not without slashing your wrists anyway.
---
Congratulations on the 10 Billion ISK Nomad.
---
Pretty bold assumption to say I know so little but yet you are a member of wormhole society. If you are a Corp that cant defend a wormhole long enough to kill it then you dont deserve to be in wormhole.
---
Haha expecting a carebear to be able to reason. Good one my man
---
damn who's got the period basis before and after LMAO
---
Lol, you do realise you are just proving my point right? Hahaha. Never stop being you guy:)
---
Sure, make it so caps/supers are useless for PvE and nerf cloaky ships to compensate. Keep blackout because it's actually made it harder to play AFK with bullshit like Near2.
---
If you want to bring back mid sized fleet combat, start responding with mid sized fleets instead of supers and the content will come. CCP can help this by removing HAWs and making faxes less oppressive in subcap fights.
---
I'm here to fly spaceships. 
---
Not listen to retards masturbate to the sound of their own voice. 
---
I'm not anti social, I just like people that are interesting. Most people, aren't.
---
No. People should be responsible for their own ability to learn the game. Stop spoonfeeding; you just perpetuate this toxic "zero personal responsibility" mentality. The fact is, if you lose a ship in EVE, you were at fault 99.99% of the time. Making mistakes is how you learn.
---
This tbh. Why would I bring 30 Harbingers or Canes to Delve when you're just going to drop supers on them? Umbrellas are the biggest reason you dont get roaming fleets that can take fights.
---
My initial scan is 64au. There's no reason _not_ to.
---
Better man than I am.  I'm just too lazy.
---
&gt;There is no counter to it? What is a mobile cyno inhibitor used for then? I know it takes time to anchor (like anything you deploy including a mobile depot, anchorable bubble, etc) but it is an option
---
In this case it's not an option. The inhib should be instant and the cyno on a delay. This is obvious. The idea that the block happens after everything has jumped is stupid.
---
I used to live in low sec.
---
And people will downvote this to hell because they are riding the sinking ship and refuse to believe anything but their current narrative.
---
You didn't and that is why he didn't post it.

I mean whsoc are pretty meh but your just being top  salty right now

wut? can you rephrase that please.

not being sarcastic, I just don't quite get what your saying here

&gt;There are tons of them out there that offer very low taxes and keeping them fuled as a new corp is either difficult or expensive, usually both.

And if you don't have one, P I R A T isn't going to come knocking on your door.
---
OK bb
---
Umbrellas are not the problem, YOU are the problem - umbrellas are a solution.
---
The problem is that CCP has catered too long and too hard to gankers. This has led individuals such as yourself to believe that they are entitled to risk-free (or close to it) killmails at the expense of people who were trying to do something other than pvp. As a result, you view game mechanics which either deny you killmails or force you to take risks in order to get them as "problems"
---
In reality, this killmail-farming playstyle is one of the biggest problems plaguing EVE. Ganking someone who was not looking for a fight and who has no chance of winning is at best a zero-sum game - you may enjoy your free killmail, but the other person certainly experienced frustration at least in proportion to your enjoyment. 
---
Those who support this playstyle try to rationalize it with the idea that the victims in these scenarios are just "dumb krabs" who are of no value to the game and that EVE is better off without them. Logically, though, it's the other way around - a player who enjoys the game without negatively affecting other players' experiences is worth far more than one who dedicates his playtime causing as much grief as possible to as many other players as possible. Most games recognize such players as being bad for the health of the game and implement systems to punish their toxic behavior, but CCP actively encourages it.
---
Yes, this is a pvp game and "constant danger" is one of its selling points, but ultimately it IS a game (one that advertises itself as a sandbox, in fact), not a military training simulation - its goal should be to attract players, entertain them, and encourage them to spend money, not to define its players' objectives for them and get rid of anyone who doesn't play it the way the developers' think they should.
---
I'm not claiming proof, only the potential. Anyone that took my comment as fact is an idiot. It's potentially an issue. As is all open source programs. You're relying on the truth from someone you don't know about something you don't understand.
---
i'm not gonna prove a negative here, on the other hand you're free to show me a small independent alliance that actually used sov to actually grow in the last few years
---
"Why EVE or CCP Games needs to fail."
---
Can someone who read the whole thing explain the 'Why' part of that? I only got half-way.
---
I confess I did chuckle out loud at being reminded that the famous apology letter was drafted by the fiction-writing team. I'd actually forgotten that juicy tidbit, but it sure sounds like someone's still savouring the taste of it.
---
So whiny bitching aside, does the article actually make a point as to why they should fail?
---
Here's hoping. Skins, injectors, promoting WWB out the arse, pushing for super capital warfare, attempting to soft reset null sec, lying about player activity during Blackout. It's not they don't it's they have their own agenda. It might very well be safe to say that Pearl Abyss wants their money back.
---
I AM NOT GOING TO THANK ANYONE FOR JUMPING 45 SYSTEMS TO CATCH A VNI

POST BLACKOUT EVE IS WAY MORE HONEST- IF KRABS QUIT INSTEAD OF ADAPTING THEN I'LL ALSO QUIT INSTEAD OF WAITING IN ANTICIPATION FOR SOME CHANGE THAT WILL BRING ABOUT AN EVE THAT I FIND ENJOYABLE

Very unlucky apparently, 4 domis in a row in the same night. All different haw pilots. Same thing the next night.

That makes zero sense. If Frat was blue they should be fighting with PH. The fact they weren't is why they should stay neutral. Get it?

If you're doing your RL work correctly, you already know that your boss plays Eve, and it was HIM you held ransom.

Maybe it’s just the people then?

just make the bumping be a non combat action on station grids, aka if you are in tether range (or dock range), you wont take damage and noone gets a timer
---
lol thank fuck, i was hurting my brain trying to figure out what you meant.
---
only 30m? 
---
oof
---
Do you see any opposite trends in hisec? I wonder if you could correlate decreased ratting in null, to an increase in high. Obvs you can't compare the exact number (1 rat in null != 1 rat in hi), just curious about trends.
---
$60/hr for contracting?  My "bro" price is $100/hr... 60 is damn cheap.
---
I’m
---
Honestly
---
Confused
---
I know we used to run roams on Frat. I’m not sure what the relevance here is except to give you a chance to shit on Frat/Noraus for having enough brains to realize they were outmatched being alone.
---
Also you can say ass. It’s fine. This is Reddit, there’s far worse here than the word ass.
---
No, you cant do reactions in highsec, that never changed.

We don't really know that for sure.
---
The ecosystem seems to be doing just fine
---
this is the kind of discussion i want to see in r/eve thanks for delivering
---
&gt; Lol, so lowsec being shit otherwise is NS fault?
---
You are the literal definitely of a retard. You made the very false assumption that i said that LowSec is shit because of null. The one needing to read is you. STFU
---
Banned for being banned
---
the minmatar were once slaves of the amarr, this is a fact. Why am I punished for this fact and mentioning it?
---
The Defense of HK's Keepstar would be sweet, as someone mentioned. Or something on the POSPY eviction would be sweet. There's other interesting events like these that there's good info out there but there hasn't been anything official other than talking about it in a podcast and Reddit posts really. The major Null Sec events up to 2009 are covered in "Empires of Eve" and the dude who wrote it is about to release "Empires of Eve II" which will cover the Null Sec wars up through World War Bee
---
Worries already are chaos
---
Ive done it, not even 50mb per hr, you could play a couple of weeks for several hours daily on 5-10 GB
---
There's nothing wrong with the people. They're nice.
---
I just don't need to listen to them talking about unimportant and uninteresting nothingness just because I'm logged in.
---
So you get the content you like and like the people you get content with.
---
Yet something is wrong?
---
Don't allow Tier 4/5 abyssal sites to be opened in highsec period.
---
Generally works pretty well in Delve.
---
Have you wondered that maybe it was how you went around talking about the subject?
---
It wouldn't be able to copy your username and password.
---
But copying your settings would give it the file that would allow it to add accounts pinned to the launcher.
---
The comment above mine was asking how people would be satisfied being an f1 monkey. To some people, being an f1 monkey is a satisfying contribution to "their team." I never said that's not the ONLY thing you can do or that it works for everyone. Just answered how some enjoy it.
---
You absolute hypocrite. One of the reasons null became the shit show it is was because of the proliferation of caps by PL and it’s moon mineral monopoly from years gone by. Now, after you personally had a hand in it, what was one of the easiest ways to make isk, you tell others to suck it up because Eve is meant to be dangerous? I repeat my first sentiment, you are a hypocrite.
---
Soooo... just FEDUP being FEDUP?
---
Outside of client updates and bulk downloads, the game uses next to nothing. Avoid afking in chat spammy areas just in case. 
---
Provided you can install the game and get the download everything option to work on another connection, you'll have no issues using the game on that connection. 
---
I just checked my data monitor and to help you get an idea how much data it uses in a month: Last 30 days was 1.54 gigs but the launcher used 1.78 gigs for... who knows.
---
Games generally don’t use much. I used to play eq for hours and it was hardly noticeable
---
For 2 weeks all worm holes should be enter only
---
Imagine being elite pvp
---
Even highsec pilots know about killrights.
---
HAHA TOU DONT KNOW WHAT A SQUAD LEADER IS?? LIKE WHAT THE FUCK, WHAT GAME ARE YOU EVEN PLAYING LEL.
---
This idiot thinks he’s a pvper and doesn’t even know what a squad leader is.
---
I’m still waiting for CCP Falcon to be put in charge of capital balance.  CCPlease
---
The only reason people want you to risk your ship is so they can shoot it. Deny content, win game.
---
I can only imagine what would have happened, if you’d discuss slavery in the the Roman Empire
---
Oh ok I guess I'll just practice with them for now I dont feel comfortable in the t1 sites in the rupture ccp fit I may add a mwd instead of the ab it's just so slow I cant get all of the cans. I changed the compact damage control for the t2 one because it was sbetter and cheaper. From the CCP fit.
---
HTFU whitey.
---
I see you met P I R A T. Fuck those guys.
---
The best way to avoid them is to transport your stuff on an alt not in a war-eligible corp.
---
Way ahead of you
---
even in jita no one gives a fuck as long as you aren't on the station grid. no group actively hunts traces.
---
stop projecting
---
&gt;I do too, which is why you won’t find any of my VNI’s ratting anymore.
---
Dude, that just sounds like sour grapes. "I showed you assholes! I win by not doing what I want to!
---
&gt; these are real players that either went somewhere else in Eve or quit.
---
Eve isn't for everyone. I personally would rather see the game shut down than become a boring AFK ratter game.
---
&gt; laugh when I see people complaining about less targets or ratting during blackout.
---
I don't really think I see a lot of that. People are pointing out how much less ratting is going on but not so much whining about a lack of targets. Here's the thing, what targets we do find will be players willing to lose something and not the guys who are programmed to warp off the second local shows a neut.
---
to be fair reddit shitposting has taken a giant shit in terms of quality lately so this comment is about what i'd expect
---
My man, the largest killer last century was infections, today its not. I.e., you cant use the past as an argument because tons other variables have changed. If you had introduced the old Eve in todays gaming competition the game would most certainly have died within a year. The only reason the game is actually surviving atm is due to its more casual approach. The cost of playing is lower than the cost of playing another game (for different reasons). If you suddenly decide to raise said cost then you damn better make sure you reward people more (not isk but actual enjoyment).
---
If you dont, the game will lose players to the benefit of other games. Nostalgia isnt gonna change that. 
---
Ill present myself as an example. I very much dislike the BO, one reason being I hate anything that rewards cowardice and instant gratification at the expense of long term planning and working. But also ofc the fact that this change will be counter productive in anything longer than a couple of months perspective. For me, NS was already filled with negative aspects but its the only place I want to live in Eve. But it was a package deal based on the information I had before moving there, I knew what I was getting into and decided that if Im gonna play the game I will do it there. 
---
Now the package deal has been broken, now the things that would generally relieve my stress (like PvE, industry, explo and so on) have become stressors instead. And PvP was mostly a stressor for me, it got my heart pumping and I love it for that reason. There was a balance. And this is what most people are missing about the BO, its not about isk or risk or bla bla bla. Its about being able to balance things on a personal level, to let the game fit into your life in a way that its costs doesnt become greater than its rewards, and certainly not greater than the cost of playing something else.
---
So fine, lets say we keep the blackout. Do you seriously belive that CCP will be able to fix the issues (restore balance) that NS has with for instance fozzie sov faster than it takes people to realise Eve is a sunk cost and start playing another game? Especially when they have already announced that their intention is to mess with sov NS for the upcoming 18 months?
---
Put yourself in my shoes. Wouldnt you at some point start to think, "The fking level of hubris on this corp (CCP), living in a bubble in which reality cant exist and they can do whatever the fk they like and still think theyre gonna keep their costumers". Like giving one of the worst interviews I have ever heard from any company leadership. If this was big business, Hilmar would have been burned at the stake by the shareholders, straight up. You always atleast pretend to be objective, not openly try to be subjective. And that same subjectivity is what pretty much signaled that they wont restore any real balance but instead will only try to hurt NS players, and honestly, Im nobodys fking punching bag. 
---
Tl:dr, Look at BO in the context of everything else and it pretty much becomes clear that sov null has become public enemy number 1. Players living there now have the choice of being everyones bitch for a long time ahead with the promise that some things might get better after theyve been raped enough, emphasis on might. Its extremely irrational to think that people would accept this.
---
CVA and -7- are the only active alliances in your coalition (as in with membership and leadership that contribute visibly in fleets) ; this was true before the blackout and continues to be true. Your entire alliance is sitting at &lt;10% activity.
---
As for the NRDS discussions; from where I'm standing don't know if it's even important to your group anymore, the rich set of neutrals that used providence simply have not returned. Additionally Test walked off with 50% of the regions' alliances, membership and structures and the remnants have not been noticeably recruiting nor are they welcoming to neutrals. I've played on various neutral characters that abide by NRDS over the last year and the welcome is far from warm with a stark shortage of space to dock and pushes to either join an alliance or move on.
---
the one reply with numbers, assuming you aren’t trolling so take the upboot
---
Updates my bro.  They be heavy
---
Just make sure you download the whole game in the launcher first.
---
Otherwise as you play it downloads new assets as you come upon them.
---
Most of the time this won't matter, but it could suddenly if a bunch of new stuff happens.
---
To hopefully break the target lock of anyone that ganks you.
---
you mean fuel costs? otherwise you're probably saving them wrong
---
Newbro here, so may not be fully correct.
---
From how I understand it, if you’re working a site and someone drops on you, you can set the drones to target your attacker. They are ECM drones, meaning they have a chance of causing your target to lose its currently locked target (you). 
---
It can make the difference between you escaping their warp scrambler, and you getting podded.
---
&gt;Tusks
---
Confirming Tuskers are legit awesome and generally chill dudes.
---
What a stupid article.
---
Says CCP is to blame for player actions, since they control the mechanics and they have to do something to enforce/discourage certain playstyles. Then complains about CCP forcing a certain playstyle...
---
People only care about carriers dropping on cruisers because its low effort and usually low risk.
---
Vonhole's ganks are high effort and in a way high risk (if your target catches on you burn everything and start again fresh with a different target).
---
The challenge and investment in setting up these ganks is high enough that he's basically the only person doing it.
---
Can we please just stop with this feelycraft? You literally have no idea who's actually botting and who isn't. This isn't clever, insightful, or brings anything new to the table. Every single system in null had less ratting due to all the recent changes. Just stop.
---
Dude, you have a problem with logic. And words. So like I said earlier, move along cause I doubt you will say anything relevant. You chose to upgrade it instead to non relevant and stupid. Run along now tiny tim!
---
Like any video game it can be addictive. As a former college student (graduated a few years ago it’s definitely do-able). The biggest thing you need to do is set realistic goals for yourself play wise. 
---
Join a Corp that is okay with you not being active during the week, and only somewhat on the weekends. If you have down time from classes etc, you can always play more. But when you’ve got that big project, exam, or whatever coming up, you know it’s okay to just let em know and pop smoke for a couple weeks.
---
Providence changed around the time cits came out. The locals got super suspicious and insular, even guys I'd flown with for years.
---
Move your guys deeper into null. It may be you're just outgrowing the CVA region.
---
You made the statement, the burden of proof is on your shoulders.
---
Honestly ye. Their agenda never really seems to be in line with reality.
---
Yes, they never shut up. Ever.
---
Which would be fine, if they had something worth while or interesting to be saying. They often don't. 
---
Just because they are nice people, doesn't make them interesting or have anything worth while to say.
---
So... still null on hardcore. I'm down.
---
Sometimes people don't know what's best for them.
---
Null stagnation was inevitable. People seek security and prosperity. But they find said situations boring and miserable. Yet they can't bring themselves to leave because MUH SECURITY AND PROSPERITY.
---
NullSec needs to get shaken up. All this intel crap needs to be removed and placed by players in systems. Supers and all that cyno force projection garbage needs to get junked hard.
---
contact ben booley in game for your shirt
---
lol imagine being this retarded
---
Ahahah! Thanks!!!
---
I'd suggest you fly a drone boat, like a vexor or something. Rupture isn't a good pve ship compared to others
---
I feel like Eve is super-organizing itself to death.
---
Which is somewhat ironic, since what you are saying is that there was *more* organization back then. But that's just the key: Organization. Not *super*-organization. Not all activities were managed at the alliance level, with some director spamming pings on Discord or whatever. People put stuff together, had fun, goofed around, called out hostiles, maybe lost some shit, gained some shit... but it was on the people.
---
Today alliances in Eve have become *extremely* top-heavy in terms of who's doing the organizing, and I don't just mean spamming links or whipping line members into fleets. The way alliances rely so heavily on incredible tools that are often eclipse the things I see at work gives me the same sense, and I constantly get the feeling this has bred a "from the top or not at all" instinct in.
---
Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's the rose-tinted monocles talking, or maybe the chicken came before the egg - it's that line members became so dependent, able to play less and less time as they moved on in their lives, that provoked this top-heavy attitude.
---
you didn't answer my question though
---
Ahh yes, I still remember my early days of RvB station games getting bumped by a 12km/s stabber to a whopping 40km off the station and 50 ceptors instantly warping to me.  I too, never had issues with bumps while undocking before then.
---
GOTG are good guys they dont bot mkay
---
&gt; Why would people choose to be content for brainless gankers
---
Lol, you're playing EVE bud, you *choose* that when you log in.
---
Fair nuff.
---
&gt; I'm not anti social, I just like people that are interesting. Most people, aren't.
---
Hey Dave, this means you're anti social.
---
&gt; There's serious discussions underway in provi about ending NRDS
---
This is probably a necessary step. It's sad but the game has evolved beyond CVA being able to do the old thing anymore.
---
Hi cocksucker, first, who really actually gives a fuck what you think, second, I'm glad to see you're still so fucking dumb that you can't tell that what 200 people have and do is entirely different than all of Nullsec doing that, and how that could effect the health of the game.
---
Supers and Titans were fine in relatively small numbers that they were historically in, sorry thats a hard concept for your tiney pea brain Aneu.
---
Also lol its totally not showing how bitter you are, what a sack of shit your life must be to still be buttmad after all these years.
---
A kayak
---
Eh no, I think the suspect flag is irrelevant.
---
No one is going to 1v1 a T5 ass fit.  And if you are bringing a crew of people, just gank them like you said.
---
You can abuse some tricks to not leave Ass space until downtime if you are camped in.
---
My man, first off welcome to Eve. 
---
Secondly, theres tons of shit in this game that will hurt a newer player like you far more than the experienced one. And most if actually has to do with griefing that people vehemently argue for. But thats another issue.
---
Thirdly, and most relevant to your situation, the corp you are in is now at war. Which means you will get killed on a regular basis just like this. My suggestion is to leave the corp and try to find a corp which cant be wardecced, either stay in NPC or choose a corp that is "not war declaration eligible". Then take your time playing the game and learn how it works.
---
If you are in need of isk, PM me your ingame name and Ill give you some to get you started again.
---
&gt; You can abuse some tricks to not leave Ass space until downtime if you are camped in.
---
Okey I guess.
---
&gt; I've played on various neutral characters that abide by NRDS over the last year and the welcome is far from warm with a stark shortage of space to dock and pushes to either join an alliance or move on.
---
It's been a couple years since I tried returning but this is pretty much my experience, too and I was a decade long provi supporter.
---
It's sad to see, honestly. I spend several years on and off living in Provi but shit seemed to change when cits were released and stations removed.
---
Still love them, though. I hope they find a way to make Provi great again.
---
You left out that people current rat in low ehp ships now since you can speed tank damage and let the drones still do the work.
---
I am sorry you had this impression, thanks for sharing! I am a gamer myself and the tone is supposed to be neutral, addressing both pros and cons and overturning stereotypes. My apologies.
---
Yay!
---
Your definition. Newsflash bud, you maybe not as special as your parents made you think you are:)
---
But as much as possible in jita put it in a. freighter and try to take it to the free trade hub
---
Lore-wise, I can see it going both ways:
---
"Hey John, there's that capsuleer I was telling you about who's fighting the triglavs on their home terf. Really great guy."
---
Hey John, something just came out of Abyssal space. FLAG IT THE FUCK DOWN!"
---
As someone else already said, it doesn't use much. Try to keep to very quiet systems and you'll use even less.
---
U
---
Clicked expecting a highsec nobody corp, left pleased it was FEDUP.
---
Appreciate the information.  Yes to download updates on WiFi.  I’m sure there is a setting that says yes to partial pushes for patches, that I can find and turn off.  Yes I’ve been playing eq and it’s been 2-5mb per hour.  I load a social media app once and it’s more data than that.
---
Bullshit. 
---
I mined 3 bil worth of ore in several hours using a porp and three barges. I did eventually lose my ~100 mil porp so I guess I only made 30 times what I lost. That's some terrible return right there. :)
---
Wait what?  That's the first time I've heard this argument lol.
---
You wouldn't hunt a fly with a sledgehammer because you could *never* catch it. You catch it with chopsticks, rip off its wings, THEN apply the sledgehammer.
---
Its the chopstick part thats impressive
---
Nah, they do their job.
---
I'm interested to know your thoughts about the massive exodus from provi into legacy.  Over half their coalition has ended up as buffer groups for test, which left them fairly short handed.  For the groups I'm talking about, I'm specifically referring to Warped Intentions, Evictus, Rezeda Regnum and Requiem Eternal.  Obviously for various reasons they felt that the grass would be greener but their departure was at the direct expense of provi at large.
---
Hey everything in your post is wrong, congratulations!
---
Still a better love story than Twilight.
---
Isn't that how you detect these sites?
---
In fleets going roaming yes, so no im not wrong about that (or anything else so far for that matter.)  J spacers also have an easier time doing it as they only have the one system to worry about.  
---
No you will not always be able to see them coming in.
---
Can i join your squad? Is that how is works? If I’m allowed to join can I also be a leader so I can add it to my title. I’ll probably also have a forums board banner made. And introduce myself at parties as such.
---
Maybe change Corp?
---
I would like it to be known I spent infinitely too much time making it. Once every 5 months or so I get a meme idea and then learn like, 1 more thing about how gimp works in the arduous, 45 minute process of making it. In another 700 years I might be basicallly competent at it kek.
---
&gt;Accepting cash will raise some of your expectations and what you think I owe you. No way in hell am i going down that rabbit hole :)
---
  He knows eve players too well
---
You need overview tab with celestial objects (or anom scanner in case of crab hunting). Set your dscan to normal pvp overview. 
---
1. Scan at max range (lets say X au) 360 degrees
---
2. If the target is there, reduce X to half (14 to 7 au) and scan again
---
3. If after reducing target disappeared from dscan, add half of remaining to the last known distance (from 7 to 10, from 10 to 12, etc)
---
4. That's technically called bisection search. The idea is to get 1AU distance approximation, i.e. target is at 5.65 AU, dscan is set 6 AU 360 deg. 
---
5. Set angle at 5 deg and start scanning celestials/anomalies *that are 0 to 1 AU closer than your max range*. 5.05, 5.33, 5.65, 5.87. You do directed scanning by holding V and clicking to object. That's why you need overview tab or anomalies only probe scanner window
---
6. There might be a lot of objects in that 1 AU range. Make an educated guess based on ship type, system, suspected activity - if it's a vexor navy in sov null, chances are it's ratting on haven/forsaken hub. Epithal in space probably doing PI at 0 at customs offices. Barges can be on belt, mining site or moon. Etc
---
Now, combat probes. The right way (imo) to use combat probes is to leave your target blissfully unaware of the fact that they're being scanned down. So.
---
1. Avoid combat probes if possible. They look spooky on dscan. If you know there is astero sitting in space for a while without cloak and there happen to be a signature that way - see if it's relic/data. Or just scan everything and bookmark it, WH way :D
---
2. Drop your combats off dscan. If not possible, warp them away asap by moving scanning formation far away from your target. Again, combats on dscan are spooky
---
3. Enable dscan overlay on your probe scanner. If target is truly in space, no celestials, you'll have to move camera a lot. Ideally you should have 5 deg minimum range dscan with target. 
---
4. Now, reduce probes to like 1AU and move them to that dscan overlay point. Do 1 analyze cycle and immediately recall ptobes. That gives ~5-10 seconds window (depends on scan speed skills/module) with spooky combats on dscan. They might miss it (:
---
5. Probe scanner remembers last probes position, so if you almost got em but not 100%, warp off dscan, drop probes, reduce their radius, try again. But it's one more spooky dscan windows, more chances of alerting the target.
---
Any program you install and run has the potential to put key loggers or malware or pretty much anything on your computer that you may not know about. 
---
Take it as a public service announcement. That's all.
---
Could have parked a laptop on that kayak to keep working for us
---
A fit would be great.
---
&gt; I've had to file police reports over the amount of malware some other games' major service sites push
---
  NAME AND SHAME
---
You gonna scan every rando system in every ass end pocket in all of Eve?
---
Amen. This dude gets it. I have similar stories from when i moved to immensea as a 2-3 month noob back in 2004 and we were patrolling our home system with rifters, because the Russian guys next door were constantly dropping gank geddons on our miners (when the geddon was still a laser boat and there were no stacking penalties...7xmega pulse II, 7x heat sink II and you would watch stuff just melt, lol).
---
We had to cooperate, we had to come up with compositions that were cost effective (because we were right on the alliance border but we were also the newest/weakest/poorest corps who hadn't had the time to farm isk and grow yet), but most of all, **we had to be out in the field**. This is the crucial part right here and i can't stress this enough, because it's the difference between playing the game and being alt-tabbed out of the game doing something else. It wasn't enough to sit on comms and wait for people to call for help, you had to be **proactive** and *actually play the game*.
---
You had to recapture a station in the middle of the night to get all your stuff out because there was no asset safety (this is a true story and it's one of the most fun times i've had in the game). But you could still do it in a few hours, because there were no sov mechanics, POS or citadels either.
---
You had to bust gatecamps and replace them with your own to secure a route, or try to find a way around, because you couldn't just cyno past them. There were supply lines (which are a crucial aspect of warfare in general and modern, mobile, fluid warfare in particular) and as a result, there was interdiction of said lines. Nowadays there are no supply lines, just jump drives, cynos, citadels and asset safety.
---
And this is why warfare in a sci-fi space game often plays more like medieval sieges (if sieges had magic resupply and teleport functions to move your armies and things around), than like a more modern form of combat. This is why the average line member has to get up at 4am to structure bash, or travel 40 jumps only to blue-ball and log off. Because you can't attack and intercept things while they are still en route and whittle down the enemy piece by piece, while also committing smaller groups yourself (which would be so much more fun, you know....more small gangs spread out instead of one concentrated blob = less lag, plus less isk in the field so people would take more fights). You have to commit to staged set-piece battles at a massive scale, because there is no other option that will bring a similar effect to the enemy. And since the assets has become so big and expensive, and the environment of these engagements is prone to lag and buggy gameplay, people often just won't commit.
---
Apart from that, over the years, power creep has given players the tools to do things easier. And by making things easier, a lot of people started scaling and doing things alone. But it's supposed to be a MMO game and a hallmark of good design in multiplayer games is "you shouldn't be able to do everything by yourself". It should be possible to do certain things with varying levels of success on your own (or by multiboxing alts, it's fine, since there's still an upper limit to that tied to average human reaction time and multitask ability/information overload), but not do everything at a high level of success.
---
So, the only moment where you now need to interact with others in "dangerous" space, is when you need to call for backup. And the only moment the backup needs to interact with you, is when they see a ping on discord. People can now afford to be **reactive**, instead of having to be **proactive**.
---
I agree, the blackout is not the ultimate solution and it does change the meta predictably towards certain strategies and tactics that could themselves become stagnant in the long run. But the blackout is probably just a way to gauge the reaction of the player base, to see how receptive they would be to a shake up and being booted out of their comfort zone.
---
You really want to fix null? It's easy, but most of your won't like it one bit. Just nerf instant force projection/teleportation mechanics and force people to be out in the field as a team whenever they want to achieve something, instead of watching netflix and waiting for pings. In other words, take a good hard look on cynos, capitals, citadels and asset safety. Of course, after so many years of softening the blows and molly-coddling, the amount of wailing if such a thing came to pass would be legendary. And that's probably why CCP is gauging reactions through something not as wide-reaching, by messing around with local. They probably knew a bunch of the players would cry too much if they tried to fix the game in one go, so they are probably doing what they have done in the past: softening the blows, but maybe going in the other direction this time.
---
Interesting times ahead for sure...
---
What the literal fuck are you talking about?
---
I say loss is supposed to matter, you go "WAAAAAGH I DONT WANT TO BE SHOT AT BY GANKERS" and I'm like bro you logged into EVE do you know what this game is? Your response is "your definition?"
---
I just picture you at home chewing on the corner of a couch cushion right now.
---
&gt; Fucking called it with the throwing up your hands and going
---
  This kinda implies you were saying it's his fault meighty
---
Spot on. But I am questioning your sanity of responding to Olmeca:)
---
Well that just sounds like an exploit. Maybe you should report the exploit?
---
Back in the day, we used to mine and even rat sometimes with a PVP response fleet flying cap. You guys should try it. You won't make as much isk as you did solo but the boogeyman won't have such an easy time when you have tackle and DPS floating nearby (and those guys would probably like the fun of someone jumping the op).
---
Does anyone have any recommended YouTube channels for learning solo pvp fundamentals? I'm just looking for a breakdown for absolute beginners with play by play commentary. If there are any for small gang pvp as well I'd love to know.
---
&gt; Or i know that google has the ability to do a better job
---
  And how the fuck is this either Squizz's fault- Or implies he has the ability to do something about it other than change to a more dodgey ad provider?
---
lol how so?
---
I'm not sure what you're complaining about then
---
&gt; Disable the ads until google gets the malicious ones taken care of
---
  Oh yea... Google, **Google** will listen to a small hobbyist who runs a killboard website for a small, icelandic, spaceship MMO video game...

A caracal for about 40m can run the electricals 50/50. The fit isn't mine but you can find it pretty easily.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9vkzrl/30mil\_isk\_caracal\_fit\_that\_can\_run\_t3\_electrics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9vkzrl/30mil_isk_caracal_fit_that_can_run_t3_electrics/)  Here's the link. Not really worth the time but if you can get in a pvp room and either get the chest without a fight or win... that's something.

Reliably a t2 fit gila can stomp t3 without much effort 100% of the time. rapid lights, mwd, drone dmg amps, reist amps and drones for filament type, passive tank.

Cynos predate battlecruisers.

Didnt CVA screw over yulai federation?

If you actually clicked the ad, went to a totally dodgey looking "competition" website- then downloaded a random program- That's your own special fault.
---
Any company with the amount of hubris CCPs got going on needs to fail. Will if fail? Honestly, its already failing. One of the best MMOs out there yet cant hold more than 30k "players" logged in during primetime. The amount and severity of the mistakes that has brought us here is staggering. Can things be done to give the game new life? For sure but sure as shit not gonna be changed by the current people. They are living in a bubble and failing to even comprehend that the gaming industry today is a completely different beast than it was 16 years ago. If you fall behind further there are plenty of new companies willing to pick up your slack.
---
&gt; Copies your username and password and makes it available to Goonscum to steal your shit
---
Verbatim, what you said. Sure sounds like making a claim, and not saying "it could do this" to me.
---
&gt; I've never had a problem with bumps while undocking. 
---
Have you been to Jita?
---
Thats a paddling
---
Its true, look what they've done with TAPI.
---
Yeah I'm a slow typer.
---
It's 1080p.
---
No offense but attacking logic when your own logic is flawed is...
---
For one, you dont know if its finite which means they cant just ride it out. 
---
Secondly, they have more choices and your assumption of +95% is wow at best considering the login drop was roughly 30% of the NS pop during the first weekend of the test. 
---
And thirdly, you are presenting all of this in a vacuum, entirely disregarding all the other factors that dictate human behaviour. For someone presenting an argument based in behavioural science this seems.. Well, poorly done.
---
I wrote those comments, I'm aware of what they say. I pity the person who, even in a game, decides being a bare minimum nobody and letting a spastic moron lead you is fun.
---
Eve is easy is very good for that. Suitonia is a really good pilot and his videos are very informative. Then you can try watching Lasker Emanuel, he's also good and he gives explanations to what he does and why
---
You could have it so no one jumping through a cyno can use high slots and can't launch drones or fighters for x number of minutes after taking a cyno or bridge. That would affect offensive drops, defensive drops, and fax/dread siege.
---
Thanks for pointing out you're one of the idiots.
---
just keep practicing man
---
What if they appeared from Wormholes, its cost time to scan the wormhole (if someone spotted it immediately) and during that time they just sitting in some safe spots across the system. WH corps are not the most concern but if another NS corps find the way to bypass the eye system through wh, its another story.
---
My point is still the same. The first year or 2 of cynos you rarely saw a capitol and it was kind of the same eve.
---
I wish every eve player reads this comment.
---
Hmm, I think Im gonna stick with that Ive already written. So you take a little time out and think about it and get back to me when you get it okey?:)
---
Good boy.
---
Cause you think you are way more clever than you actually are. Like being able to frustrate anyone with your intelligence or wit. Which is hahah. Omg you are hilarious man.
---
350 ly in a jf, weakling!
---
FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS???????????? Of your own money??? And you don't even break even or see a profit off of this??  *Shit.*  I am relatively poor IRL, right now I'm scrounging just to save up for a \_car,\_ I can't comprehend of having a lifestyle where I'm able to just throw $400 at hobby projects because I want to. And you won't consider subscriptions? Like, idk, a dollar a month + 400 subs = almost break even maybe? A dollar a month is a pittance... 
---
You've been thinking sometimes of shutting the whole thing down for good, I saw in the past; I wouldn't blame you one bit. 
---
400 a month. Fuck.
---
Ok feel free to carry on not making any sense at all and i'll keep on not feeling bad that its hard for you to farm for a super OK?
---
I'm glad its hard for you to replace your ships, its supposed to be.
---
Sounds like your the scout/hunter/E-ware Support, so honestly very important if you know what youre doing and what youre supposed to do
---
That seems pretty obvious at this point...
---
Then CCP should ban Dotlan, in your case hunters just search the number of jumps and players inside the system in 24h.
---
What is this "blackout" people talk about?
---
&gt;But that is the point of Null. If you want the rewards you can try to get better at some aspect where you are deficient. Get more numbers. Learn to be better at defense. Join a better rental group, putting up with the cost, crowds, etc. Try to imporve your own intel network with some cloaky alts on gates. Find fits, tasks or income sources where the reward outweighs the risk. 
---
So be just like Goons and Legacy?
---
Not gonna speak for Sait, but my "AFK" ratting was in front of the keyboard.  I'd keep my Eve windows stacked in the background, so I could pretty much only see local.  I was technically at my keyboard, but still considered it AFK because I wasn't actively playing/watching.
---
You dont need to replace ships that arent dying, cause they are not being used!!:)
---
Now go back, read what Ive written. And tada:)
---
Youll get there, I have faith.
---
I see you guys didn't mention getting decimated by the mighty beans! 
---
Although, I can see how losing to such a prestigious PvP group is nothing to be ashamed of
---
This pain is necessary to bring about what comes after.
---
What's wrong with them? They do what they're intended
---
Mostly sounds like Karen wants to speak to a manager.
---
Are you the same age today as you were in 2004?
---
Ok slow brain lets break this down then.
---
2 guys are talking, one says farming for ships is harder, you walk up to the conversation and say "farming for bigger toys is harder", when explained thats a good thing your fall back is basically "oh im not actually playing cause i dont like dying".
---
Thanks for hanging out hopefully you give somebody your stuff?
---
You mean the fight where we killed the fort, and the entire mighty beans fleet while losing a few ships?  Also since when is Waffles a prestigious group?
---
You mean great for you.
---

Hey Grath Im sorry I havnt sent that second bag of dicks yet I didnt expect you to eat the first bag so quickly. Will send second asap I know you get cranky when you dont get your vitamin D.
---
ayylmao
---
Gotta yske out those spoditans somehow
---
You havent explained anything, just made a statement based on your personal opinion. Secondly haha. No, Im not gonna continue with this. 
---
Ill just stick to what Ive written already:)
---
all that's obvious is how butthurt you are over the changes and how you are unwilling you are to adapt.   
---
but go on explain to me how I'm wrong
---
Fortizar cannot be brought into a C1, correct? It needs to be built inside first. Is this correct?
---
WHBOO!  
---
  
---
Also:  Scary Wormhole People are recruiting.
---
At least you got its good side
---
In the past we don’t have super umbrellas and 3rd party apps, but there’s local channel. I don’t understand why you need to rat in a group because you simply dock up or fly to your local pos when you see neuts or reds in local.
---
Plus before the Dominion expansion, there’s no anomalies in null, you simply rat in asteroid belts, which means you don’t want to rat in a group, you simply want to rat alone in a low true sec system
---
That's actually interesting. In my field of research, we've found too that questions (thinking of one in particular) that seem odd or loaded are sometimes consistent predictors of attitudes.
---
Prove it
---
Hunters want their free intel while complaining about ratters having free intel. Hunters are more risk adverse in their covert ops than the ratters ever were.
---
Lol, and repeatedly burn them out of every hole and watch as the rats scurry along to another one. But they will adapt they say:)
---
Its so cute when the little buggers who have nothing to lose have opinions about how others should lose things to them more often:)
---
im not sure why bots are going away... they pay for them self after like 1hr
---
also, i am sure you could go to every single region in eve and see the same trends, people are ratting less
---
You can get vitamin D from a dick?
---
Ok well what you've written is a road map to you being dumb, so its good you're leaving it there.  If you can get even one person to come explain your wit here I'll admit you're the smarter man but right now you just look pretty fucking dumb.
---
*farming ships is hard*
---
*you need to adjust how you do it*
---
**YOU** it wont scale to larger ships
---
**Me** ok its not supposed to replacing ships isn't hard
---
**You**Im not losing any ships because i dont like dying
---
**You** GOTCHA GRATH
---
**Me** ?what the fuck?
---
Yeah, but it's like 3 frames per second. It's a *slideshow*.
---
Yes, it is pretty usual indeed...
---
These sorts of extra statistics would be nice, maybe add an "info" page to the details of each ship with that kind of data. Who built it, when it was built, how many kills, how many systems travelled through, etc. Make in-game killmails and lossmails link to that specific ship rather than the generic hull (if it doesn't already) so you can see this stuff for your victim/last loss.
---
Give a man a fish and he'll be fed for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll be fed for the rest of his life.
---
Link lossmail.
---
Yippee kayak motherfuckers!
---
Local is turned off in nullsec. If you talk your name shows up, but just being there nobody can see you in local
---
Warframe is heaps of fun and way less grindy then eve
---
Its easily playable F2P this guy doesnt know what he is talking about
---
You can run t3 sites in a t1 cruiser, assuming your character has almost maxed out supporting skills
---
Otherwise just use a Gila, don't be cheap
---
The funniest part of this whole exchange is watching you act like some savant but actually never offer any sort of conversation. You just kept spewing one liners off thinking it makes you win the argument and the person actually attempted a reasonable conversation. Shocking that it proves you basically have no merit to your argument and have resorted to this as your method of discussion.
---
Oh hey look. Someone with a long memory. Perhaps he also remembers that it was PL that was so notorious for blobbing anything that moves with super carriers as they blame Goons for super carrier blobbing. Fuck the blue donut right? We totally aren't blue to everybody else who complains about Goons. PL has always been the epitome of hypocrisy. The 'elitist' community has always been a circle jerk. And Goons are the monster that PL had created. They became successful out of necessity. Adapt or die? They did. Better than any of you.
---
Yeah real shame he isn't like the Lord and savior Mittani.
---
So everyone gets paid but PL/WC.
---
&gt; No, I won't turn off ads because of a few bad actors.
---
The defect is yours. I don't block ads, I whitelist all third party content loading. Ads just happen to never get whitelisted.
---
&gt; This is the great debate, isn't it? Some people call themselves "pirate" just because they do lowsec PvP and have negative security status. To me, these are not pirates. In EVE developer lingo, they are "outlaws". Other people think of piracy as flying around in lowsec RPing as "yarr matey" buccaneers, attempting to tackle non-combatants in order to demand ransoms - which must be honored as a matter of principle, of course. This, I would agree is a sort of piracy. A lame sort. A relic of an era of EVE history in which this was a more viable practice, combined with some e-bushido and weird cultural baggage.
---
&gt; My definition of piracy is anything that involves using spaceship violence, theft, or deception to extract isk and salt from people who would rather you didn't. 
---
Since you're gatecamping piracy, I can too. Tbf your sort of piracy is a lame sort as well. Try sustaining yourself in wreaking havoc and stealing things in nullsec. Hisec ganking is just a minmaxed business with nothing extraordinary happening for years now. If you wanna send the message that nobody is safe in Eve 2019, you go to null. That's where you get real salt and hate as well.
---
Other people not having interesting things to say doesn't make me anti-social.
---
That's entirely to do with them, not me
---
Why? 
---
I pointed it out earlier, it's nothing to do with my Corp.
---
Tier 3 isn't much isk either
---
Botting is significantly down yes.
---
so is active players logging in to play?   A lot of people will say it is the eve way, adapt or die.   Not as many PvE carebears to run out and kill though.   That's a problem.
---
That would require you typing your username and password.
---
And not being up-to-date on your windows firewall.
---
That would actually be pretty cool/neat.
---
You could always put up a $$ donation page but put an EULA on it stating something along the lines of "Donations are voluntary, however whilst your donatinon is appreciated,  the donation itself does not provide any services except for the operating costs of zkill".
---
So I did make an honest effort to read your post but I quickly became agitated as I saw you move from point to point while ignoring obvious facts which change the circumstances from then and now.
---
Everything from account proliferation, ready access to skill acceleration, tightening profit margins, and an increase in 3rd party offensive Intel has made the work of just logistics a fucking nightmare outside of JF chains. You conveniently ignore these differences and denounce the modern era as "too safe".
---
I don't disagree that the blackout has been interesting and definitely shaken things up, but do not try to pretend that back in your day you had to walk uphill both ways in 6 ft of snow while being chased by wolves and indians. A more sparse nullsec population, changes to gate distance and warp speed, a lack of cyno capabilities and just a generally lower amount of SP in the game allowed a small group of skilled and dedicated pilots to run security escorts for their logistic ships. But now your freighter could be caught by a cloak sabre with a cyno and have a suicide dread dropped on it from 7 AU away. And that freighter is going to fucking die. Bet that truth is super inconvenient for you though, isn't it?
---
Its okey dude, you are absolutely right:)
---
No dave, they have interesting things to say, you're just too much of a turd to take the time to listen.
---
Because you're an introvert.
---
Fun fact grandpa ads today aren't the ads of the early 2000s. You don't have to click on them before they can do nasty things.
---
No they won't, everyone has to get on board to get them to change. [Fun fact i already said something like this.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cp33xd/impossible_to_use_zkill_on_mobile_because_of_new/ewnf3t1/?context=3)
---
yeah definitely not butthurt, I also am not living in null :P havent been for abit doing low sec stuff for a while.  
---
&gt; if you and your corp are not willing to adapt the way you play then no, you don't deserve to be there.
---
Hmm you say dont deserve to be somewhere in a video game, well that's just elitest bullshit that will drive people away, which despite your rhetoric is definitely bad for the game no matter who they are.  It's also just plain wrong as saying you shouldnt play a game you've played for so long and enjoyed got vastly imbalanced by a developer change (no game should do that to anyone on both a business and a moral level.)  
---
 &gt; back to highsec with you carebear or unsub. you won't be missed.
---
Pretty sure you are the one who wouldnt be missed here, got a good group of friends been playing with for a while.  Also not a carebear looking for easy kills like you ;) .
---
 So essentially you want people who you consider unfit to leave nullsec and the game thus making either one emptier which is bad for both because of a full swing in the opposite direction causing beyond unfair advantage to hunters due to developer change.  It sounds like you're just trying to bully people into playing in directly detrimental and unfun way to themselves.  So you're just being a bad well human honestly.
---
He has the ability to temporarily pull down the ads until the malicious ones have been sorted out by google.
---
So you can't get one other person to point out your witty bit?
---
&gt; You won't make as much isk as you did solo 
---
Which is also kindof part of the problem, if you arent making enough to make it more lucrative than other lets say "safe" activities then it isnt worth it and wont be done.
---
Look its simple, the detection is there, the software is there, if there are bots its because they wanted it. Just like wow where you think there is a major bot issue, blizzard looks at it as an acceptable situation until it's not and they scale them back. It's likely given CCPs past that they introduced some of the bots themselves. So like I said there isn't a bot issue, its if the dev wants to make it an issue. Pretty straightforward. So CCP claiming they are waging war with bots to help us is absolute garbage.

Being the responsible party has nothing to do with who's fault something is. If my kid smashes a window by accident it's not my fault he broke it, but it is my responsibility to take care of it.
---
How does 1 vs XX in an incompatible fit = exciting PvP? This isn't even about Abyssal at this point. Explain to me what is so exciting about a battle you are obviously going to win? In fact if you are going to tell me that your gank squad has EVER failed to kill a solo pve ship, then I'm sad to say that it isn't Eve's terrible mechanics to blame for your dismal failure. It probably started a lot early than that when your father released faulty genetic material inside your mother.
---
Well it won't affect being podded, as the jam won't happen while you are in your post and your pod can instantly warp.

Here's the short version: mining isn't profitable.

And if you find an item to manufacture profitably, someone will crash the price before you even take any to market.
---
&gt;  It's likely given CCPs past that they introduced some of the bots themselves

LOL what the fuck?

Are you a conspiracy theorist about any other crazy shit while we're here?

---
Mutaplasmids aren't a bonus, they are a modified.
---
They define the exact amount of the new item.
---
So they act like any other module with those stats.
---
Abyssal sites aren't an isk sink or an isk faucet.
---
They basically don't affect isk at all.
---
Wait, when did this stop?
---
No, they don't. Trust me, I've listened. That's why I don't do it any more.
---
Kill Rights seem fine to me. You can scam with them, you can use them for their intended purpose, you can get baited on a free whatever. Pretty great to be honest.
---
Wait tge onyx is on with a module thats bannded in high sec?

---
All systems normal in Esoteria, too.
---
i dont trust you though.
---
I have stopped "reading" what you write a while back haha. Im not about to go back and read through the entire convo just to prove a point. I trust that I wrote what I wrote correctly when it mattered. Which was hours ago. It doesnt really matter anymore, atleast for me.
---
So dude, take a breath, chill and let it go. Here, Im giving you the win, enjoy it and rejoice:)
---
Til next time Mr Grath, cause you know there will be a next time hahaha
---
Thanks
---
That's your problem.
---
Not a lot I can do about that.
---
Knew what it was, still clicked. No regrets.
---
First hand experience, we dropped on a Rorqal, got counterdropped by supers. Dropped on another rorqual 5 minutes later and even more supers dropped.
---
Well evidently I cant stop any other super pilot dropping caps. Which is why im ok with them being removed or changed in that way its irrelevant to me anyway as I used to find all the subcap fun outside of delve/eso/tke not so much anymore, random goon dropping his toy makes no difference to that.
---
 As for the local thing still no. They should make changes to the eula about third partys for chat log scraping for intel. Or make it so you cant log chats especially the intel. There should be no issue with people being able to see intel if they are there at the keyboard looking at the intel channel.
---
Gotta parcel out those supers accordingly!
---
From a wormholers perspective sure
---
You can absolutely fit a Myrm or Domi with an omni tank; you can't \*also\* cram in a diminishing-return level of drone damage amplifiers. It's just a new set of expectations for what a "good" 20 minutes yields you. Also, packing a few off-damage-type drones helps against hunters that don't bother to fit an omni tank.
---
First I thought it's a bunch of Kikimoras :)
---
&gt; I trust that I wrote what I wrote correctly when it mattered.
---
Ok but you didn't and it didn't at the time it didn't.

I got worried for a second after reading that, but realised I am AB fit w/the phoon. Still opportunities for them to tackle of course, but I go faster than a cloaked bomber.
---
gotta love how the retards conflate botting, afk ratting and multiboxing fluidly and without pause.
---
your previous comments about how hard it is to detect cloakies and risk/reward for subcaps crabing along with your dismissing the idea that a NS corp should actually work together to combat this new threat really come across as someone that misses the teat of perfect intell that allowed for afk ratting, mining and bots. and your most recent comment comes off as even more butthurt.  
---
elitest bullshit lol. do you really think the most wealth rich part of the game should be open to people/corps that can't even defend them selfs against minor threats? people that couldn't be bothered to scout gates or check sigs while they mine or crab or even form when something is threating them? why do they deserve to be there? how are they contributing? aside from inflating the market and plex prices. or by sending isk and minerals to their landlords directly contributing to capital and citadel proliferation. 
---
EVE is a harsh sandbox game that changes all the time. new groups will come to fill in the space that's currently being vacated by people that can't or won't adapt. and with plex prices dropping new players won't find it so hard to plex their accounts breathing new life into the game.   
---
and ive already run into a few smaller corps that know how to flush cloaky hunters out of their space. altho it did look like they where working as a group. something you and your mates seem unable to grasp. altho as your reddit username isn't your in game name who the fuck knows if you even have mates.   
---
so congrats mate everything you said is wrong
---
So how much money do you think a 2 DDA Domi gets you per hour?
---
Ikr. Our JF dude moves that many lys a week on the low side.
---
Plenty of FCs are actually quite intelligent, understanding and don't treat line members poorly. Don't let the oldschool PL FC rage memes let you unironically think that's what Eve is like. There's literally nothing wrong with enjoying the "f1 monkey" play style. If they enjoy it, who cares? No need to be a complete twat. No playstyle is any better than any other.
---
I feel the same , my corp is very empty and even my alliance is very quite its becoming very lonely atm . Logging in and seeing just me or I other and my alliance coms just static will slowly push me out of eve
---
Bye bae:)
---
Blackout makes botting and safe nullsec ratting hard, and that's the prime reason why it is good. If nullsec corps absolutely need safe ratting (or worse, botting and rmt) to survive and they would die without it then so be it.
---
I've returned because of Blackout and having a blast. I primarily wander in low class wormhole space, and it's currently more alive than I've ever seen it. Wormhole people lived without all of this safety long before nullsec lost just a local chat. Yet I don't see threads with bitching from wormhole dudes "game is too dangerous, we can't afford to lose tons of ships anymore, small collectives die, please send help". Wormhole collectives just endure risks and find a way to prosper in their own ways. So maybe it's something wrong with play style which nullsec corporations use, and not with the Blackout?
---
If reduced afk ratting, botting and RMT mean than many nullsec corporations would die then I want to see them die. And I want to see what will arise from their ashes.
---
I argued this a few seperate times saying how blackout is great, and if leaders utilize it properly it brings groups together like the old days. There is a huge opportunity to teach members dscan, where to roam, how to use ingame map, how to protect each other, how to actually socialize....
---
I was met with "well that's your play style, xxxx Corp doesn't like it"
---
Told them okay well then go to highsec where there is no risk. Was told "fuck you I want to stay in 0.0, I've been playing for 5+years, shouldn't have to adapt again. "
---
Told them okay, then teach people to use dscan, watch gates, work together. Or stop using excavators and caps if you can't be bothered to do that. To which I was told "no fuck you  that's not my playstyle. Also, I can't teach people to play because all they do is die. "
---
Holy fuck I lost faith in those people fast. Thankfully my Corp pvp has grown immensely closer, even talking with other corps regularly. Less afk alts on, but no significant change. 
---
And no not all of imperium are complaining. This is a select few who think they deserve to afk at no risk. Fuck those dudes....
---
To those who remember eve before Intel channels when a 10 man gang was serious... don't give up hope, this shit is great. You don't have to be a afk krab who cares about paplinks
---
Null shouldn't be the stress free environment. Go back to high sec, it should be more suited to your taste.
---
God forbid you need to take some basic security precautions. Just roll the wormhole, then even if they did come in they'll be rolled out of their own connection or have to retreat before you roll them out.

so back in 2010 when I lost this.. it tanked \~38k hp. put the same fit in pyfa today and it shows \~40k ehp and that's after the resists were nerfed... so in the complete absence of actual dates to 'read up on stuff'. how about you go dig up the patch notes where ehp was so dramatically increased, or at least provide real dates for your rhetoric.

---
I didn't realise not wanting to listen to boring irrelevant shit was some kind of disorder... since nobody wants to do that.
---
Yet again, missing the whole point.
---
hics have scripts
---
and how is that the player's fault? people are really good at min/maxing shit. 
---
want people to fly things other than speed tanked drone boats? then make those ships \*worse\* or make other ships \*better\*.. its called balance, and its CCP's job. not ours.
---
to be perfectly honest I miss ratting in drakes and hurricanes. the alpha strike on heavy missiles and artillery felt a lot more powerful than the slow grinding chip damage of drones.
---
Thank you, automod.

Maybe I should also play your character so you don't get too tired because of all this difficulties you encounter?..
---
I you want to HTFU and you need information for this then ASK someone who play better than you. Make some effort, ask people, do your own research. Expecting someone to teach you when you don't even bother to ask for this is some kind of entitled bullshit. Other players aren't your parents and they do not have responsibility for your well being.

Dave when you think everything everybody says is boring and irrelevant its not us, its you.

Its also somehow not shocking to find that you dont do socializing well.

i don't find everything that everybody says is boring and irrelevant. but nice try.

It's either:

  B. Ad program that's not google: something much worse.

  C. Google.

2010 is after the last time universal ehp was buffed. Yes certain ships have been rebalance but ships in 2010 had way more ehp then say 2006 or 2007. Jesus Christ bro read my post. Clearly I brought us back to pre cynos, and 2010 was years later. 
---
So again you come at me without really digging. Go back and look up the 2005, 2006, and say 2008 base ehp numbers for the raven for example and you'll see what I'm talking about. 
---
Besides being beaten down twice, your point is moot anyway. Since we had eyes on gates we were ready to respond before any1 said they were tackled. Generally we were hitting the gate and spamming warp the moment they were on dscan from bait. These days no one responds till after the bait is tackled. And yes before you say cynos, I already said that cynos changed this dynamic a bit.

Can someone ELI5 what happened ?

If they're happy just F1ing, by all means, do so! Just don't act like you personally did anything meaningful besides log on

MFW not using anti virus software for protection against... Ads that somehow install malware through... A GIF image... OK
---
&gt; Problem is that we are losing real players and gaining alt accounts.
---
CCP doesn't care.  Alts are encouraged, and often downright required.  You're not becoming a captain of industry, science, or the market without several alts.

Pretty much.

How did you read my post and get any of what your saying? This is not comparing now to then you moron, the point that everyone else but you in the comments seems to get is what I am talking about is back in the day we looked out for each other. Now everyone is a lone wolf with a bunch of 3rd party tools. I never ever said that logistics these days is easy, it's just different. 
---
But go on and spin what I said however you like it. 
---
What I did claim, was that old eve was better, and that's my opinion. Some things are easier, some are harder, some are just different.
---
Depending on system you may have 2 or 3 guys ratting 1 system. We use to just use entire pockets of space. If we had 30 guys on, we might be spread out in 5 systems or so. Some systems have like 60 asteroid belts so you need multiple people to run them right.
---
Nice shot man. 8.5/10 Needs more explosions.
---
More like only highsec pilots know a about killrights; they don't exist in null.  Some people  *cough* haven't been in highsec since they were introduced.
---
pls b gentle we never get kills we were actually happy to have gone isk positive for once. 
---
also many people now know you guys are god gamers
---
Lmfao truth
---
This i get. You did tell me it was unconventional
---
You missed my point entirely. It's pretty amazing.
---
With wh corps, it is the best solution. But with some NS corps try to gank dead-end pockets, what they need is some cloacking ships exit the wh and then cloak inside the system to cyno drop supercapitals or identify the target.
---
I got a whole capital fleet gatecamp for a ninja gas mining Prospect of mine once. They didn't get me tho.
---
No different to how killmarks work right now. What's the problem again?
---
&gt;"I've been playing for 5+years, shouldn't have to adapt again."
---
Oh that's adorable.
---
Ah i was wondering how the hell did that rorqual last that long.
---
ELI5?
---
Only one with any recruitment standards
---
Claiming it is better *IS COMPARING*! Imagine that, moron. And while we are on the topic, better for who exactly? I don't know what ween fantasyland space MMO you've been playing all these years, but all I have ever known is one simple fact about Eve: if you aren't being betrayed, hen you have nothing worth taking. The only difference between then and now is that everyone now has the bare minimum that is worth taking, regardless how cheap it is, and that's your pride.
---
So while you claim you aren't comparing whilst clearly you are, try to remember that through those ruby-tinted glasses of yours betrayal was fairly commonplace and no one could be trusted or depended on. And whilst that hasn't changed, now each individual person can depend upon themselves. We wanted this universe, and we got everything we asked for.
---
&gt; shit i got caught lying through my teeth, uh.... hey fuck you!
---
Not ONCE did I say anything about my aversion to risk.  I lose shit all the time, I'm not complaining about my losing ships.  The problem is the safety afforded by umbrellas.  You can't argue with me here, the statistics are that isk inflation is sky rocketing, assets are proliferating.  With out people dying and assets/isk leaving the ecosystem EVE continue to be fucked.   Listen to the Hilmar interview, he IS the authority on this.  EVE is TOO safe according to CCP themselves.  If you don't want listen or believer the man in charge of the whole damn game, you can also see by the proliferation of capitals rising cost of plex.
---
You have also assumed I'm hunting "krabs." This is not true.  I spend pleny of my time running sites and doing exploration, during which time I'm taking my turn being a target slamming v just like everybody else.  My main income is running anoms.   And you know what's fucking dumb? Within 10 seconds of me realizing I'm in trouble I can have 5 supers sitting on top of me covering my ass.  There isn't any reasonable roaming force that can deal with that short of 100+ man bomber gangs.  I want people to be able to enjoy their large gang/alliance content because the organization and comraderie is what they enjoy however it's currently coming at the cost of the things I enjoy, which is 1-5 man gangs.
---
You're bitching that "I want it my way" which you actually have no supporting evidence for.  In fact, your entire argument is "You can't have it your because then I can't have it MY way!" If you want to PvE cool, great - DO IT.  I actually can't STOP you.  I can come and make it difficult periodically, but I'm not going to be there 23/7.  I know this for a fact because as I've stated, I make my isk just like the rest of you.  In fact, right now I'm training into a hulk-&gt;rorqual because I need to start studying for exams.  I don't have any desire to use plex to pay for any of my shit.  I am more than happy to trade the absurd umbrella for more opportunities for unexpected pvp.
---
If we do away with umbrellas there will more than likely need to be some changes on the tail end of that.  Supers appear to be in desperate need of EHP/tank nerfs.  Making SOV be less of a nightmare would be a huge boon as well.  Anything that actually incentivizes alliances to only hold space they actually use would be great.
---
But I really am sick of this insecurity projection.  You've relentlessly put words in my mouth about what I want.  It's super fucking annoying trying to have debates with people on here when they demonstrate no interest in listening to the perspective of their peers.
---
&gt; it just so happens that when you don't shut the fuck up for more than 3 seconds, you run out of interesting or relevant things to say! shocker, isn't it?
---
There are literal industries built around proving you wrong here.
---
Huh? I thought this thread was going to be a bunch of echo clambering based on the response to my post. Seems that a lot of people remember things much differently than.
---
Sticking to the past or clinging to our depressing status quo is tragic.  I don't know a single person in EVE who thinks "everything is great now, lets leave it be." We have massive inflation and grossly stagnant sov.  We have to do something.  There has ABSOLUTELY been an improvement in little guy offense as you said.  If it has hurt them defensively, that's fine for now.  We can address that next by wounding the security of large alliances and/or by hamstringing their ability to project their umbrellas beyond space they want or care about.  Just about everyone agrees that their should be space for little guys in EVE.  The only thing stopping them is how easy it is for large alliances to bully them and horde shit they don't care about.
---
You have not presented a compelling reason to return to non-blackout, only reasons why it's not perfect.  It's an improvement with room for growth.  I want growth, not cowardice.
---
yo im not a liar im just trying to have fun 
---
my apologies
---
Damn dude difficult critic
---
&gt; just to get rid of the bots
---
&gt; just
---
Yeah I believe we can't afford any sacrifices for such insignificant thing as getting rid of bot plague.
---
WTF are you talking about. Like for example you raged about how hard it is to run a JF these days. I agree. I do not run a JF anymore because I find it to be insanely difficult and tedious hence I would rather pay someone else to JF my shit for me. JFs however make it easier for people like me who do not want to do hauling runs. So in that regard, I love JFs. I even love caps and supers, just I do not like how common they are. Certain things are better, certain things are worse. 
---
So yeah I kind of prefer old eve to now for me, yes for me, when you say for who, I am literally talking about me. Is that a problem? Another example opinion is I think supers/titans being able to dock in keepstars is bullshit, but thats my opinion. Am I bad that I have an opinion?
---
So again you missed my whole point which ultimately was that if your corp/alliance acted a little like they did in the old days when we relied on human eyes instead of other bullshit, maybe more corps and alliances would be holding up better in the blackout. That was my entire fucking point you moron. 
---
Ok, lets see what you've got for me this time, cause I have a feeling you and I are going to be going back and forth for a bit.
---
AFK ratting is the second worst thing after botting. It's actually good that you don't do it anymore.
---
Your level of smug can be smelled from across the room.
---
You're assuming that it's impossible to make life for groups as they get larger.  That's an absurd assumption, there are all sorts of things CCP could do, it's a matter of finding the right things.  We could (but shouldn't) just have a scaling fee for member count.  &lt;100, 1m per member per month, &gt;1000, 500m, per member per month.  It's a lazy, shitty idea but it would strongly disincentivize swelling of numbers and enact a logistical strain. 
---
Are there ways to improve blackout? Maybe, but now you're just nitpicking smaller less relevant issues.  The blackout isn't the most noteworthy thing that happened, it's what it has illuminated to us: that large alliance super umbrellas are murdering the ability for dynamic gameplay.  The amount of power concentrated in this space has gotten so entrenched that we're going to wait for the next news worth awox to undermine this bullshit.
---
You're also speaking in absurd hyperbole about how the game is going to die if CCP enacts changes.  Players with this mindset are trying to hold them game hostage.  EVE was never going to be for everybody.  There is a wealth of ways to play the game.  PVErs screaming about the game being ruined are being fucking ridiculous.  None of the content has actually been changed in any way.  All that has happened so far is that it is a little harder to tell if someone is trying to kill you, but overall it's still pretty easy to tell if someone is about to come get you.
---
In my opinion, Eve hasn't got the best gaming community. It just happens to be MINE though.
---
So I'm stuck here with you... sometimes amazed by your support for new players and the strange bond in this game in terms of "shoot each other in Eve, but get a drink in RL" that I don't experience that way in other communities. The evolved metagame around Eve is HUGE, the amount of tools and websites and everything, so much to explore and crawl through and read! And while not presicely mature all the time, it's not a average joe childish community with stupid fanfic-anime-porn-cringe-weirdos inbetween. I really appreciate this. 
---
And then there also is that bitter, elitist *"My way is the only way, duh. Also CCP does everything wrong."* approach, that really goes on my nerves and had almost driven me out of the game entirely at one point. And that constant *"I make 50b ISK/h in my hyperbling octa-boxed bling slave capital ratting setup, that is totally not an exxagerated number at all."* or *"Lick my shoes, idiot, you're happy that I even made you an offer to join this TOTALLY AWESOME renter corp of a corp in a renter alliance of a pet alliance of a minor alliance of a coalition of a powerblock after you gave me all he ESI scopes to check that you're not a spai, you filthy bastard."* was/is REALLY fucking annoying.
---
I am really torn. Sometimes you drive me nuts and I hate you all and everything that doesn't fit common narrative gets downvoted, too. And sometimes I love you, because the game and you are one of a kind and we share the same kind of awkward pleasure/hobby. To repeat what I said in the opening:
---
and your average corp member is literally not, or ever will be, successful or even in such an industry.
---
You get pounded a lot in EVE and don't know how to deal with it, aren't you?
---
I mean, that's cool and I'm glad it's working for them but it's predicated on pure luck and necessitates the population density of people doing the same thing with no motivation but hoping someone else has the same goal.  I'm of the mind there should be some intrinsic reason for people to roam around like FW offers.  Of course there's room for improvement, but the concept is good.
---
I do agree that the blackout has shaken things up. The first weekend was glorious fun as group after group came barreling into our space with whatever crap they threw together. With our organized home defense and umbrella,vas well as fairly staggering subcap numbers, we deleted fleet after fleet. That activity and excitement has died down now, however. In the aftermath, I do notice some problems, specifically with the little guys trying to make their way. I think what this really does is highlights some overall stagnant gameplay mechanics that need to be updated to be more active. For example, there needs to be an active method for hunting cloaked ships that isn't a guarantee but puts pressure on them so they have to move and adapt with defensive hunters. It needs to be 100% non-static, which means an active player has to actually engage the environment and *do* something. It also needs to allow a counterplay option for the cloak ship. This creates an engaging mouse-cat-dog game that feels rewarding to whoever wins.
---
Honestly, a lot of game mechanics need this kind of update.
---
I did forget to nut up or shit up in my other reply, so for example in blood moon rising, which was the christmas update in 2005, all ships had a 25% ehp increase. The next patch ships had their total Hull ehp increased by a third. So there are 2 examples.
---
If you once start, you never stop. You only make 4-year-breaks.
---
PvP is for Player versus Player.
---
When one player attacks another then it IS PvP by it's very definition, you don't even need to google anything to understand this.
---
Are you dumb?
---
I would like to play in the nullsec of ~2007. I like being in a small group, and it sounds like everyone else had small groups as well so it wouldn't be such a hindrance as it is today when the blocs have grown up. But alas I had just created my first toon at that time, and was barely getting my feet wet in HS, maybe thinking about trying LS.
---
In my opinion blackout is the latest link in the chain of changes that have made (sov-)null worse than it was ~5 years ago when I moved to null. I've spent the whole time in a small corp, and we've never had a supercap umbrella, and we've been getting a lot of beating over the last 3 years since Excavator drones made Rorqual the best mining platform instead of a support platform and skill injectors came, and made it possible for people with a lot of ISK or willingness to spend $$ to jump into the FOTM-Rorqual instantly. Blackout might be the straw that breaks the proverbial camel's back for a lot of players from null groups without supercap umbrella.
---
By itself either of these wouldn't be that bad, but combined they made it possible for a single person to start doing mining at scale as long as they had the initial ISK or $$. Pre-excavator one would have to multibox hulks, which starts to get diminishing returns at around 4-5 accounts since you have to move the ore at least every two cycles while keeping up with rat spawns and hauling. This combination of Rorquals and injectors is the main contributor to the supercap proliferation, and supercap proliferation allowed for more Rorqual multiboxing, and the cycle continues.
---
"But why did you not join one of the blocs yourself? You'd have 15 Rorqual accounts by now." I don't like big blocs, there's too much fuss about everything, and TBH too much drama. A smaller, tight-knit group is more to my liking. Joining Goons is completely out of the question, joining some other bloc (PH?) I might do if I really had to but TBH I'd probably just go nomad in a C4 by myself if it came to that.
---
So after tilting the board very much in favour of the big blocs what does CCP do? Tilt it even more because why not? They could have for example fixed cloaky camping to help smaller groups but they didn't. With blackout the smaller groups cannot really make ISK in null. I've seen people advertise exploration and yes, it might support 1 player per constellation, which is approximately zero. Yes, we can mine in Procurers without boosts or rat in Myrmidons but what's the point when you could make 10 times the ISK/hr in HS or 20 times the ISK/hr in WH-space, both of which are currently safer than null without supercap umbrella. For example in WH space you can have pretty good traffic control by rolling holes and critting the static. Sure login-traps can surprise you but the same applies to null now. They are not very common since they require so much prep-work, and it's a lot easier to just have a covert cyno move a gank-fleet in if there is a subcap ratters/miners to kill. The target will have no defence against it if the attackers know what they're doing. Abyssals in HS is almost zero risk with all the risk coming from your own mistakes. If you make no mistakes you lose no ships.
---
So what will I do? Well, for now I'll probably go do abyssals in HS for ISK, and go on roams from there. However, it's really not the same feeling as defending your home. It might be ok but I don't know if I'll get bored of it soon since having a home to defend is a big motivator to me. My PvP-toons are my PvE-toons so I cannot really have separate toons in HS for ISK-grinding and in null for PvP. I've gone through HS -&gt; LS -&gt; WH lifestyles before settling in null (and I used to like it here) but it's really looking like CCP only wants 2-3 big blocs in null. If it really comes to that then it'll at least help me win Eve.
---
Are is not smart i suppose.
---
Taking sov that no one wants is easy. Ratting in jump range of GotG, Panfam, and npc null is another story.
---
Yeah I just chose the cheapest one to use over all of the ccp fits for abyssals.
---
Ahhh the good old days.
---
But are *you* going to volunteer your playtime. Because they can't compensate you for the isk/hr that you are losing.
---
Honestly, local itself was a crutch. We don't need to revert the blackout, we need new active mechanics for defending our space. I would perfer any number of mechanics that allow defensive hunters to do more than throw out bait and see who bites. I want a mechanic that allows me as a hunter in my own home to put pressure on the invaders so they can't just sit there and wait.
---
Heres the point.
---
Heres you missing it.
---
Just because you dont find the average conversation interesting (because you're an antisocial introvert) doesn't mean the vast majority of people agree with you, its how the rest of us hold basic conversation.
---
People generally will listen to people drone on about just about anything really, and again, i can't stress this enough: When everybody feels one way and you feel another, its you thats got the mental/emotional problem.
---
Tbh I'm actually shocked you're not a solo high sec player, you seem like kind of a cunt.  Its hard to imagine you existing in a social corp environment.
---
Misspelling, edited. I'm not very smart too. But PvP is PvP.
---
Imho if your idea of solo PvP is killing ratting Domis and VNIs, you are not a solo PvPer.

The biggest problem would be getting it to only respond when someone replies to it without requiring someone to mention it’s full name to trigger a response

Looks like all of those living there have at least one krabbing system.

You should also brush up on your geography. None of those krab systems are within jump range of PanFam, and GotG havent figured out how to make PvP bots yet.

Just do the math. The rock has the refine yields.
---
Actually, JF chains are pretty easy with the right infrastructure in place. Did I say JF was hard? Because if I did I apologize as I have unspoken.
---
Moving on, let's all just take a step back here and put it all on the table, dicks and all: I *like* the blackout. It's been a real slice. I made a disgusting amount of isk as well because super carrier+proper fit+umbrella. I'm worried about the little guy though, and as such I want *new* mechanics that people can use to better defend their space. I want those mechanics to be active, requiring user input to work. My brain child was covert ops probes that could only detect cloaked rigs, but not tell you what ship that sig was. That way the neutral in state., assuming he is dscanning, will know an attack is inbound and can try to move out, but the numbnuts that just stays there greedily eyeing a juicy target gets surprise-buttsexed.
---
That's just a useless football idea, but *those* are the type of mechanics I would like to see inputted into the future of Eve. And while I do want chat back, I think a regional chat would be way more interesting. Risk adverse nerds that gotta dock up would do so if one dude entered just the same region. Cloak campers could shit down regions while still being effective at engaging targets if need be.
---
Just add static wormholes to nullsec

/s if that wasn’t obvious

Yes, they've taken a hit, will post later on.

Moon ores are split into their rarity so everything from r16 up (that is, it appears on 1 in 16 moons) is better than anom ore. An r16 like sperrylite will make about twice spod. R64 like loparite will be worth between 8 and 10 times spod depending on prices at the time. Moons have a small chance to jackpot aswell which doubles the value of all moon ore on field. Jackpotted loparite with a rorqual is about 2 billion an hour discounting travel time.
---
R64 rocks yitterbite ect

Thank you, is there a way to see a list of all moon rocks ore similar to how anomaly ore is listed on fuzworks https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/

Also is there a way to know what quality the moon is before a moon chunk pops so I can choose when it's worth moving from an anomaly to a Moon?

"Nobody wants that sov"

But four entities moved in, with two right across the border in Vale

"Yeah but they don't live there"

Ratting numbers and ADMs would say otherwise, as would actually visiting the region and saying hi to the locals

"They aren't living in there hard enough"
---
*sigh* Rote has 300 pilots and maybe 80 real members. Trigg has 350 pilots and around the same real members. Unspoken has 252 pilots and maybe 90 real members. Toxic has 229 pilots and maybe 80 real members. CENTI has 167 pilots and is realistically like 30-40 real dudes. ECHO has 185 pilots and like 60 real members. Forsaken Empire has 146 pilots and is like 30-40 real dudes.

These groups moved in more or less two weeks ago. I guess they just aren't winning fast enough for you, eh?

take that feeling distill it, that either the feeling you'll get from eve or you'll hate the game

Hey, umm.. What are killrights?
---
 [https://ore.cerlestes.de/moon](https://ore.cerlestes.de/moon) take this as a rough value, i don't know how often its updated.
---
Moon scheduling and the ore in each moon depends on your corp/alliance that put the athanor down. Horde has a schedule that shows when the moons are popping and whats on them but i can't really speak for any other alliance. If you mean to put one down yourself then you can use moon scanners probes to survey what is in each moon before you place an athanor.

You could scan it with a survey probe.

Less ratting and a nosedive in ratting are two different things.

&gt;Repackage a ship and unpackaged it.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Killmarks and dirt is all gone.
---
Exactly my point.
---
D. Not running ads for a couple days while google sorts it's shit out.
---
I think i replied to one of your comments claiming the same thing before, let me reiterate.  
---
Overall number of kills is meaningless as a metric if you don't dive deeper and actually analyse the data.   
---
For you blackout might be a failure because you liked the status quo of activity.  
---
But if we presume that ccp wanted to improve smaller scale pvp, than they were successful.  
---
Pointing at overall kills, and then ignoring that the nullsec warfare meta has failed to adapt to no local as of now is bad reasoning.
---
Claiming that because the overall number of kills is down the game is less active is bad reasoning.
---
Now if you start corroborating your claim with other facts, such as posted above (adms having sunk across the board, pcu being down) you might finally approach having a feasible argument.
---
Wormhole space remembers.
---
Actually, if you do any pve, particularly in high sec, you run far more risk than just joining a null sec alliance. Doing that means being a full time target but without the means to actively defend yourself. If somebody wants total easy mode, just join that null sec alliance or be a high sec ganker.
---
It’s pretty shit now. Used to be you got 500 plex, now I think you don’t. The person you recruited gets some SP though.
---
Why no alts? 
---
I found living out of a rattlesnake in a WH to be super fun. But I used a scanner alt to scan holes and scout/haul blue loot.
---
Okay, and there's not much wrong with having the stats go away when the ship is repackaged.
---
Sure, it sucks to lose all your history with a ship, but having stat tracking that gets erased on repackage is better than not having stat tracking at all.
---
Still salty about that one, eh?
---
Let’s just say I’m VERY glad it doesn’t have an obvious hour counter so when my GF randomly uses my computer and the eve launcher and steam launcher are both open I can point to Dota with 1k hours as “that game I used to be addicted to in high school 5 years ago”
---
Jesus Christ fuck this game can be addicting

EVE is just a video game at the end of the day. I don't see why people feel this overwhelming need to compare it to child care.
---
Like, if more people just sat down and calmly explained how an honestly complicated game/sim works, we'd probably have more people sticking around, or playing on general.
---
Instead you get people giving the "back in my day" rant about how they had to learn trial by fire. I did it to, frankly it was terrible, and it's part of the reason why I would generally take the time to sit down and walk through things when I run into people who are new or lost in general.
---
It's kind of why I hate HTFU and disagree with the people who preach it. EVE is still a video game, it should be about having interesting interactions between players, not just being the biggest hardass on the block.
---
I love the Aeon.
---
That’s my justification for subbing multiple accounts. It’s my hobby, some people have like model trains and shit, mine is just internet spaceships...:
---
this is bad advice
---
Many places had a nosedive in ratting. Obviously unprotected areas will get hit the most.
---
Officer, this one right here.
---
That's the thing though: Local was never implemented to be an Intel channel. Intel should require communication (you guys already have plenty of Intel channels and they're still pretty good, though some gangs only get reported on Theta comms) and shouldn't be perfect without effort.
---
I don't know how you used to find subcap fun and cant now. Theres more roaming subcap gangs than ever but Delve isnt a particularly attractive place to roam in anything that isnt cloaky bullshit or kitey bullshit. I'd imagine if you go to Brave/Test/Horde staging and plink at the jb in front of the keep to let them know you're there you can still get a decent brawl with 20-40 guys.
---
Wait till your bounty rivals a skill injector, then go suspect.
---
You (and others replying) are missing my point. I have *no issue* with dying or risk (I spend 90% of my time PvPing). Back in the day I'd still rat with an AFK cloaky in system, and if I died then, no problem, I'd still have had fun up til then ratting - not 'AFK', but maybe checking local/intel once every minute or so.
---
My issue now is that in order to play at all, the *actions* that you have to take to play properly simply make the game less fun. It is not good game design to require me to hit scan/look at my overview every 3 seconds for 1/2/3/4+ hours straight. I would rather there not be any option to dscan/align at all, because at least then I wouldn't have to worry about it.
---
Remove pvp in hisec everything solved.
---
I know you don't like hearing it, but HTFU. This is a videogame, and ontop of that one that always advertised itself as being hardcore and cut-throat.  
---
This is the only reason anything has any value at all in eve. Because there are consequences. If it was easy to pvp, hold null and flip systems in fw then noone would do it.  
---
The craziest thing that blackout has shown is that a part of the playerbase is so out of touch with what the game is supposed to be. How can you not realize that all the isk that you farm in safety becomes worthless if there is no tangible risk associated with it.  
---
Imagine if the dark souls community would petition to make that game less punishing.  
---
Imagine if in a csgo tournament the team that lost the game wants smoke grenades to be removed from the game because it makes it hard to push a bombsite, and their opponents utilized theirs better.   
---
For this game to mean anything, there needs to be risk, and there needs to be chaos.  
---
Even if you don't agree with blackout, it will be hard to deny that for the health of the game we need other measures that make living in nullsec actually challenging.
---
I never understood setting up in a non Forge hub. OP please enlighten?
---
Even 30 seconds would make a world of difference. I've heard a bunch of interesting ideas on it too.
---
cyno's require more fuel the more people that jump to them.
---
cyno's can only jump ships 1 size class bigger (need a battleship to cyno a dread, a dread for a titan)
---
cyno jammers not taking time to spool up and/or shutting down active cyno's.
---
There are idea's out there, CCP just has to decide on which to use and what advantages/disadvantages help the game the most and hurt it the least.
---
And this right here is one of the big problems. "But are you going to volunteer your playtime. Because they can't compensate you for the isk/hr that you are losing."
---
Speedlimits? Never heard of those. Greetings from Germany.
---
If I was more prepped I would absolutely take you up on that offer. I am newbro tho, been playing about 2 months. So I dont have any alts just yet that arent alpha and my main only has 5 mil sp. But in the future I absolutely want to try this. Thank you for such a detailed reply!
---
I see you did your research; you did the right thing using the word "risk" in your post. It will dogwhistle the people on here and they may treat you more favorably.
---
I like eve...
---
People aren't whining because super umbrellas are being used, people are whining because between capital PvE and supercap proliferation, CCP has killed any reason to roam in anything that isn't cloaky bullshit or kitey bullshit, and essentially killed off roaming to get a fight instead of roaming to get free kills.
---
Personally, HAW dreads/titans and FAX are far more irritating to me than super drops, but it's not hard to see why battleship brawling and Sleipnir roams are a dying breed.
---
I mean sure, but EVE is a video game.
---
HTFU and "Adapt or Die" make the fatal mistake of assuming a player's life is somehow going to be worse if they just drop EVE like a hot potato and play something else in thier free time.
---
It's really not. Because EVE, while awesome, isn't real life. Quitting is perfectly acceptable with frankly no consequences whatsoever.
---
 
---
 I don't know how many players were going to have to lose for people to kind of remember that...
---
To keep a static 100% shut you only need to roll it every 3-4 hours.  
---
If you don't warp to the new static sig after rolling the old one, the new static won't automatically spawn right away. As time passes the probability of the new static spawnig increases (thus the 4hrs mark).  
---
But to quickly point it out, even if you keep your static shut if anyone rolls into you while you are farming you are fucked.
---
Scan full range/sphere; decrease the range until your thing disappears... now you know his range... look at what celestial clusters where in range... set to 30* cone and hold V while clicking on those clusters... once u see his celestial cluster... decrease to 5* cone... hold V and click the "Panet/Moon/Belt/Anom" and you got him... can do it pretty quick with some practice
---
I'm not comparing EVE to child care, I'm comparing mentality of "take care of me or I'll get mad and leave" to demanding of parenting.
---
I could calmly explain what I know if I've been calmly and politedly asked. And I am not alone. If more people knew how to make a normal, calm and polite human conversation instead of bitching and spreaded this sacred knowledge to others, we'd probably have more people sticking around, and those people would be more pleasant to interact with.
---
I believe HTFU is about what you shoud do in case of troubles, not about how you should learn the game. Like, when you come home you should probably wash your hands before eating anything, or things could go bad. It's up to you if you should consider the advice and how you are going to accomplish what is adviced.
---
yes, so so would stats like who built it...
---
because people build packaged ships.
---
Considering I was responding to the stat of the builder...then...
---
that is entirely untrackable on packaged items...which is what people build.
---
Lol this is the most honest hilarious truth. The blackout just encouraged every entity in the game to turtle up into the most dense blob imaginable to even perform basic PVE. Of course trying to take that on solo isn't going to work, but hey it's what the roaming PVP'ers "wanted".
---
This is a obvious troll
---
Looking forward to hearing from you how people should adapt, linemember.
---
Next time he'll take a bicycle with him and use it as an excuse for not placing laptop there instead.
---
&gt; Not ONCE did I say anything about my aversion to risk.  I lose shit all  the time, I'm not complaining about my losing ships.  The problem is the  safety afforded by umbrellas.  You can't argue with me here, the  statistics are that isk inflation is sky rocketing, assets are  proliferating.  With out people dying and assets/isk leaving the  ecosystem EVE continue to be fucked.   Listen to the Hilmar interview,  he IS the authority on this.  EVE is TOO safe according to CCP  themselves.  If you don't want listen or believer the man in charge of  the whole damn game, you can also see by the proliferation of capitals  rising cost of plex. 
---
The point isn't your aversion to risk (or lack thereof) or how many ships you lose, the point is the negative impact the type of gameplay you've implied that you engage in has on the game itself. 
---
As I said before, the safety afforded by umbrellas is not a "problem" - it is a SOLUTION to a problem. The fact that you view umbrellas as a problem implies that you are part of the ACTUAL problem, as outlined in my previous post, but if you are NOT one of the problematic players I grouped you in with, then I apologize for my error.
---
You are indeed correct about inflation and asset proliferation being a problem, and you are not technically *in*correct in pointing to super umbrellas as a cause. Without the protection of umbrellas, nullsec anomalies might very well pump out substaintially less isk and ore, which WOULD be a positive change. 
---
With that said, though, the problem in this case isn't that it is possible for people to engage in pve activities unmolested, but rather that nullsec space vastly outproduces hi-/lowsec in terms of isk, and universal ship losses in terms of ore and minerals.  This problem is rooted in infinitely respawning  isk/ore anomalies and the effectiveness of the tools available for harvesting them (ie: multiboxing rorqs). Addressing these issues would solve the problem without the negative side effects that removing umbrellas would entail.
---
As for more ships needing to be lost...we're in agreement! CCP needs to give players more reason to fight and destroy/lose ships, but all they seem to be interested in is enabling and rewarding ganks. There would be FAR more ships destroyed if players could opt to engage in battles knowing that they had a fair chance to win, as opposed to the current system where fights are virtually guaranteed to be unfair, which only promotes risk aversion.
---
I don't even know what to say about you citing Hilmar as an "authority", and I can't think of a way to express just how ridiculous that idea is without making it look like a personal attack on him.
---
&gt; You have also assumed I'm hunting "krabs." This is not true.  I spend  pleny of my time running sites and doing exploration, during which time  I'm taking my turn being a target slamming v just like everybody else.   My main income is running anoms.   And you know what's fucking dumb?  Within 10 seconds of me realizing I'm in trouble I can have 5 supers  sitting on top of me covering my ass.  There isn't any reasonable  roaming force that can deal with that short of 100+ man bomber gangs.  I  want people to be able to enjoy their large gang/alliance content  because the organization and comraderie is what they enjoy however it's  currently coming at the cost of the things I enjoy, which is 1-5 man  gangs. 
---
There are plenty of methods of isk-making available other than ratting/mining/etc in nullsec under a super umbrella, and no one's forcing you to choose that particular method. If you want risk while engaging in pve activities, go virtually anywhere else in EVE, or stay where you are and just don't fit a cyno when doing activities where you don't want to be safe. If you want risky isk-making and small gang activity, try factional warfare. 
---
Just because you don't like a particular option that's available to you doesn't mean that it should be denied to everyone, especially when you have so many alternatives available to you.
---
&gt; You're bitching that "I want it my way" which you actually have no  supporting evidence for.  In fact, your entire argument is "You can't  have it your because then I can't have it MY way!" If you want to PvE  cool, great - DO IT.  I actually can't STOP you.  I can come and make it  difficult periodically, but I'm not going to be there 23/7.  I know  this for a fact because as I've stated, I make my isk just like the rest  of you.  In fact, right now I'm training into a hulk-&gt;rorqual  because I need to start studying for exams.  I don't have any desire to  use plex to pay for any of my shit.  I am more than happy to trade the  absurd umbrella for more opportunities for unexpected pvp. 
---
I'm not really sure what to make of this one...you seem to be throwing around half-formed ideas and raging incoherently.
---
&gt; If we do away with umbrellas there will more than likely need to be some  changes on the tail end of that.  Supers appear to be in desperate need  of EHP/tank nerfs.  Making SOV be less of a nightmare would be a huge  boon as well.  Anything that actually incentivizes alliances to only  hold space they actually use would be great. 
---
Supers aren't in need of tank nerfs, that's just an easy conclusion to jump to when mindlessly repeating the "capital proliferation" catchphrase that's so popular around here. It's more an issue of capital-based anti-capital weapons being undertuned, plus the ill-conceived idea of scaling logi to capital levels (to be fair, CCP seems to have some understanding of this, given the whole capital shield extender/armor plate thing).
---
&gt; But I really am sick of this insecurity projection.  You've relentlessly  put words in my mouth about what I want.  It's super fucking annoying  trying to have debates with people on here when they demonstrate no  interest in listening to the perspective of their peers. 
---
You aren't my peer and I find that claim insulting.
---
&gt;I could calmly explain what I know if I've been calmly and politely asked.
---
Lmao get over yourself loser. Nobody cares about your opinion.
---
Yet you took your time to commit this pointless comment. Well, fuck you too.
---
Take an interceptor, get 50 of them in Amarr, fly them home. :p
---
Agree with the majority of your post OP which brings back some great memories of my null sec living in early 2004+ and time spent in the Querious region. For me I simply love this blackout feature which brings a different dynamic thought pattern to bear when travelling or existing in null sec space. However I can see the potential negative effect towards some *solo* PVE activities that occured and still occurs all beit in a lesser quantity. Should the blackout stay? In my opinion then Yes!
---
Looking forward to see more pointless toxic shit from you, asshole.
---
&gt; Yet you took your time to commit this pointless comment. Well, fuck you too.
---
Yeah, cost me like 10 seconds too. Idiot.
---
Oh yeeeees show me your best
---
I literally have better things to do with my time than listen to people drone on about things of 0 value.
---
Why is this surprising?
---
&gt;But I wonder if blackout true believers will feel the same way two months from now when entire regions get abandoned and your target choice consists of Delve and Eso.
---
And by that time the people living there will be sitting on every entry and exit waiting for the enviable killmail to jump into their camp.
---
The selling off of assets continue and down to one account that is subbed.
---
&gt; more pointless toxic shit from you
---
That's rich coming from you lmao. You're an actual waste of oxygen.
---
Aeon is the best ship. Good job OP.
---
I really fucking wish.
---
Yes - but the less shit out in space is dying more
---
Implying that'll even work.
---
A neutral market alt is always handy to have no matter what you end up doing in eve
---
If you can hit R64's the isk you make is absolutely insane. If you can get a list make sure you hit all the R32 and R64 moons that you can. I remember in December last year I prioritized our public fracks with 2 rorquals, I ended up making several billion per day.
---
&gt; That's rich coming from you lmao. You're an actual waste of oxygen.
---
See what I mean? I told you it's coming!
---
&gt;Claiming that because the overall number of kills is down the game is less active is bad reasoning.
---
It looks like really sound reasoning, if overall kills are down and overall player  count is down and overall ADMS are down then the   game is a less active. Playing words games doesn't change the fact that EVE is currently going through an overall slump in activity, its plain as day when you view the player count graphs. You don't even need to run the numbers through a statistic analysis to see the downward trend in players, kills and overall activity.
---
That would be nice
---
You're like a child in kindergarten repeating "no you" ad nauseum. Your replies are as empty and thoughtless as your supposed "valuable insight". You're pathethic dude.
---
Thank you.
---
And how would that not work? We already know that if the ads are never displayed they can't do anything unsavory.
---
What does this do apart from giving alliance supercap umbrellas a new addition.
---
I disagree. With this mentality you will never have enough sp/isk to make the transition. It’s best to just jump in. There are fleet roles that require very little sp and isk like tackle or frig ewar that can be force multipliers and teach you how to play the game better.
---
From my experience that is most often caused by the 'undock while at war?' confirmation box. I got it a lot before but after i checked the checkbox to not show anymore i've not gotten it once.
---
Spoken like  a true non-nullsec member. These null players invested time, money, and energy into claiming that space, making it theirs, upgrading it and living in it. Why shouldn't they we able to create a semi-safe space for their activities given the investment and daily upkeep costs associated with living there? This whole nullsec should always be dangerous thing is a direct contradiction of the risk and reward concept. These players moved to nullsec, they live in a space someone could take away from them that is the peak of risk in EVE online and their reward is now in the gutter. Players are going to respond by leaving nullsec in droves and in a few months we are going to have to listen to the same roamers who cheered on blackout complain about how dead nullsec is and how there is nothing to do but go to LEGACY, GOON or HORDE staging for "gud fights" and how that's not any fun because the umbrella's are a thing.
---
&gt;nice joke
---
yes your post is a joke.
---
He does say the ads offset that. But yeah. Why pay $400 just to attract trouble? Not forgetting the hassle with bad site scrapers...
---
The nomad was in highsec, and was flown by a pilot that had a kill right available. A kill right can be bought, and after it is activated the pilot will go suspect allowing people to engage him for a limited time. So we paid the 30m isk to activate his kill right and could freely attack him in highsec.
---
HTFU and L2p You fucking bot carebear
---
While using the bubble is banned in high/low sec, the bubble module can be loaded with a script that turns it into a long range point/scram
---
How does this make nullsec dangerous, and how is this an isk sink?
---
Do you know any of the words you're saying?
---
Troll. Got it.
---
I think it pulls from either ESI or one of those market data sites. It should be fairly accurate.
---
often times, system effects don't affect npcs.
---
Dumbass if more iskies get blown up by the evil nullsec empires it will save nullsec by making it dangerous again
---
A *couple* of days?
---
the only way to move a fortizar is a max cargo orca (or a freighter).  
---
It can not come in or out of a C1  
---
So, yes, it have to be built inside.  
---
Btw, I think Azbel and Tatara have the same volume than a Fortizar
---
I'll bite, just in case someone with functional braincells is reading this.
---
Ships being blown up is not a isk sink, it removes no isk from game, it is a isk faucet because of insurance payouts adding new money into the economy.
---
Make shitposts great again !
---
Rat info shows base resist.
---
You are doing good, but use Republic fleet valkyries. They have more hp - harder to lose them to rats
---
insurance doesn’t cover the cost of such a big explosion you troll
---
Cause this shitpost sure ain't it haha
---
hahaha, hows those critted statics and then all you have to do is look for a new sig to pop... soooo dangerous.
---
The blackout favours those people who have a 1 dimensional (shoot 'em up) approach to Eve, whereas the attraction of Eve for many has been the multi-faceted nature (Industry, PVE, exploration etc as well as PVP). I like all aspects  (but spend more time PVP than anything else) and have found that the Blackout has made little difference to PVP. However, my concern is that people more focused on non-PVP activities are not moving to HiSec but are leaving completely (I certainly have a number of friends who have moved from Eve to other games (or even going back to real life) as a result of the blackout). The longer the blackout continues then the less likely that people will return. 
---
Look at [https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) and it is clear that numbers are significantly down compared to the same time last year, even with CCP bribes to get people to log in (skillpoints for logging in etc.). Now, I know that some people will claim that the difference in numbers is due to Bots, but the null regions that I have spent most time in have very little bot activity (as the residents do not tolerate it and will go out of their way to destroy any bot). What I am seeing is activity dropping across the board and that real people are leaving. 
---
I know that some folks will say that people should HTFU, adapt or die etc. and that is a valid perspective, however I fear that the long term consequences will be that people will choose to join one of the mega-alliances and we end up with one or two huge blue doughnuts (leading to essentially no null sec PVP content) or that people will adapt by choosing to leave Eve (which I believe will be to the detriment of all).
---
I can't help feeling that CCP are prioritising short term personal financial gain over the long term future of Eve (the handing out of SP for just logging in or killing one lowly rat would suggest conditions in the contract with BDO related to the number of logins 12 months after acquisition). At the end of the day, it is CCP's business and they are looking to make money out of it (which is fine and they are quite entitled to do) but their financial reward may not be aligned with the long term enjoyment or aspirations of many within the Eve community.
---
Certain PvP actions in high/low sec give kill rights. An example is attacking someone in highsec. If you attack me in highsec (outside of war/suspect/criminal status), i will recieve a kill right on you. I can then make that kill right available to anyone and set a price on it. If someone activates the kill right then youll become suspect for a little bit, this allows people to attack you in highsec without any interference from concord or gate guns. There are quite a few ways to get kill rights so its common for lowsec PvPers to have them.
---
Piercing thunder
---
Look if it goes in wormholes it’d make them TOO dangerous it’s why i said null
---
you also had local so you knew when shit was going down, and having forward scouts on a logistics run was actually useful.
---
I felt the same way....cant imagine skilling into a jump freighter, buying a jump freighter, and never learning about kill rights. At least he knows now.....also to always have an e-cyno....i followed him to an athanor where he docked and undocked a few times before warping to gate....he couldve easily gotten out of that
---
I was arguing against his line of reasoning, not against his conclusion.    
---
But thank you for using *my* argument from above.  
---
ADMs are also a pretty shit measurment of activity, as they only show one side of the story. Also you can make the claim that ADMs are down because of increased roaming activity.  
---
Blackout *is* the reason that ADMs are down, but actually it is because now there are more hunters active in space = more activity, not less.  
---
And this isn't even addressing that we havn't talked about why having lower ADMs is automatically a bad thing.
---
On TIS a while ago falcon and hilmar said that PCU is down, but DUA is up/stayed the sane. As that is the most reliable data we will get, i'll go with that. So while the number of accounts is down, indivual user activity is better than pre-blackout.  
---
Also your closing statement is pretty ironic. It's exactly the point that i tried to make. You havn't done a proper analysis of the data, nor have access to the complete data set, nor know what ccps intentions with blackout were.  
---
So why are you making that the pivot point of your argument? You are screaming out to the world "i am ignorant of the actual data, but i still know the truth". Fuck me.
---
on the ESS seeker thing...why is that an exploit what is the result?
---
I can autopilot in HS, can you autopilot in null?
---
Make sure you get into a wh corp if you haven't yet so you'll know basic safety for a C13 when the time comes
---
&gt;because now there are more hunters active in space = more activity, not less.
---
LUL wut? If before there were 20 people ratting and 10 people mining and 1 person roaming and there are now 10 people roaming and no one else there is LESS activity. You are literally ignoring reality and math to benefit your point of view.
---
Nullsec is to much for newbro's now.
---
I dont have it unchecked, however come to think about it, it didn't prompt me for some reason... Did have agency open though... Although it should just 'work'
---
&gt; like a tree falling in the forest somewhere and nobody hearing it fall
---
this is a claim often made by philosophers, in reality the tree has his api registered on zkill so a lossmail should be visible to everyone even if not immediately.
---
glad to hear your prot survived, but maybe the game is telling you not to fly it
---
Thats an assumption.
---
Less that, more confused by the constant calls in a sandbox game to nurf anything that doesn't force providing pvp content. Don't run them either way, but can't imagine run abyssal then sprint to nearest station and stay docked till timer runs out to be a fun playstyle. Increasing rewards for doing them from lower sec systems would give a reason for going there without taking away harder pve content from people who don't want to play with you.
---
shhh don't break his narrative that everything was better back when you could get 20 pilots in the same system before the servers fell over.
---
Got it, thanks for the tips.
---
no u
---
Damage Application is a big deal in Eve. Light missiles have much better Explosion Radius&amp;Velocity which makes them better at damaging smaller and faster ships.
---
Your name being displayed in local didn't create some kind of skill gap when it comes to tackling that you describe here.
---
To the contrary it made hunting a little less easy. While having near2 sure as shit made ratting easier for the krab, local intel also gave hunters information they could easily grab and assess as soon as they enter system, allowing them to see if that ratter is bait fit, has a history of lighting cynos, etc.
---
The change still doesn't stop you from monitoring gate with eyes, etc. Now you just have to assume you may always have a duder in local, just as you would if ratting with an ark cloaked in system beforehand.
---
Also, idk the fuck you're talking about with that little rant at the end, nul was never intended to be safe, the people who run the game agree that it has become too secure.
---
Adapt or die?
---
There was a June/July CCP stats comparison floating about somewhere using in-game eve data.
---
They will do more damage to larger targets, look at the missile’s info, see “explosion radius”, if this is larger than the target signature of what you are shooting you will apply only partial damage.
---
There is also explosion velocity, if a ship is going faster it can “outrun” the blast even if the missile lands.
---
[See this for a comprehensive explanation](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missiles_101) 
---
If you are in a cruiser class ship, check out “rapid light missile launchers” it is a cruiser class weapon that spits out light missiles quickly, and will apply to small fast targets better than heavys.
---
It's all about application of damage. Heavy missiles have bigger explosion radius and slower explosion velocity, so your heavy missiles' explosion barely hit target. Try using webs or target painters (or both). You also can change heavy missile launcher to rapid light missile launcher
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missile\_mechanics](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missile_mechanics)
---
This should help explain the various variables that can affect missile damage.
---
I know the proteus is "sub-optimal" at present, however I'm a die hard Gallente capsuleer and I'm just not comfortable in anything other than green... But, maybe in the future, CCP will show the Gallente some love again... perhaps not, but I'm still hoping :)
---
Saying the truth doesn't typically bring mockery, multiple cryposts on the other hand, that'll do it. 
---
You stated above he's only presenting one aspect when he made multiple points,, points you conveniently ignored because you didn't want to accept arguments that fly in the face of your preconceived notions.
---
Missile damage is affected by ship size and speed. If using heavy missiles against small ships try upping your skills, using guidance enhancers and computers, using missiles with less damage and better application (t2), using webs and target painters, and using them against cruisers and up while using rapid lights against frigates
---
That is true, its just an assumption. But so is your assumption about small scale pvp being higher. Outside of anecdotal data and without analysing zkill completelely we cant say anything more than zkill shows a downwards trend. Which is what I said.
---
Nullsec warfare meta? What are you talking about? Why would that change in any significant matter? We never had issues killing stuff. Why adapt to something that doesnt affect us in the warfare department outside of pure intelligence? 
---
No, I clamed that every vital piece of data, including zkillboard is saying it. Check dotlan, PCU is broken and cant be used outside of the first weekend due to login events. The MER, which dotlan can be used to indicate, will be out soon enough and it will show much less activity.
---
Every piece of information outside of pure anecdotal evidence supplied by PvPers is showing less activity in NS, dont take my word for it. Do your own research.
---
Signature radius is also a part.  This is where target painters and focussing on larger ships come in.
---
Webs can help slow the faster ships.
---
Also, paying for faction missiles can give better application of damage.

Yeah because Rorq changes, spammable citadels, Fozziesov, ihub anomaly upgrades, highsec trade citadels, moon mining changes were amazing for the game. /s
---
100% will try this... lol
---
You are still not understanding the point i am making, because now you are also using an anecdote and linking the data set that is, as i already pointed out above, inaccurate.  
---
Just throwing that data at me again in the hope that it will somehow stick this time is just silly.  
---
The reply i made in the first place isn't about arguing details of blackout, it is about how disingenous it is to take one trend in one data set and making an all encompassing claim based on it.  
---
I want you to take the data that you think proves your point, and then i want you to *explain* why and how that data proves your point. Sofar you have failed to do so.
---
Kill rights are great where theyre at....i wonder if he means bounties
---
N00b question: how do you get these clean screenshots? I mean, no HUD, overview, other windows, nothing by the sensors...what am I missing?
---
What is DUA? You mean DAU? The MAU and DAU BS they pulled? Check the newborn graphs and check how HS is looking, you will pretty quickly realise thats mainly bots and lots of them to offset the deficit of NS bots. That literally means nothing. I bet you that you can see this trend after every banwave CCP does.
---
And they also said its the highest in 5 years. Which means that today, with all the multiboxing, bots and skillfarms we still have higher MAU/DAU than 5 years ago when the PCU was double of what we have now. Does that really sound reasonable to you?
---
I too, prefee playing d-scan masher instead of actually enjoying myself.
---
Can I get a crying face as well?
---
F9
---
Look at improving your support skills for missiles such as target navigation prediction etc. You can also fit a target painter to your ship. It will boost your dps a lot especially vs small moving targets. 
---
Missiles always hit a target, but the dps is dropped by things such as the target's signature radius and velocity. Guns on the other hand will hit hard if they can hit.
---
&gt;  is either too safe (preblackout) or too risky (post blackout).
---
You are right about nullsec being too safe pre-blackout. However, the effect of blackout was not the same for everyone. If you were a super-ratter under umbrella you can pretty much keep on ratting, so the people on the top are not affected much. On the other hand, if you are something else, then the risk/reward ratio has gone through the roof.
---
He really really didnt. He talks about DEDs in 2 out of 3 pharagraphs and the third one was saying obvious shit which I will disregard 10/10. You want to take BS as holy writ, do it. But I wont.
---
I would love to see it. Not saying I dont belive you but data I very much like to interpret on my own.
---
Of you think scouting isn't useful under blackout you're fucking braindead, flat out.
---
Sure, if you had done either.
---
Even if you jam the dampening ship you are still removed from the engagement by the very ship you are jamming.
---
This basically means you ignore them and pray they don't target yiu whilst you try to jam something else.
---
Cool. Then mute your comms until you get tackled. You can be an introvert without being an asshole.
---
What? It requires zero fking skill to tackle someone today. You are cloaked in a non local environment where you dont show up on d-scan. I mean what?
---
Intended? Thats why local has been around forever and the test has been for 1 month? And you think you can talk about intended? Lul.
---
Shitty accidents like that is what antivirus is for.
---
do you really tho lol
---
&gt;Although it should just 'work'
---
Have you ever played this game called EVE?
---
Ultimately, everyone's got a goal. At a baseline, everyone seeks wealth. But in truth, you can't expect other to fulfill the auxiliary roles so you can reap all the profits. 
---
The most honest expressions of humanity are greed and hatred. Honor, faith, integrity, fear, rage, malice; all of these things betray you. But if you keep in mind the functions of greed and hatred, this world humans have built becomes incredibly predictable.
---
So if you don't want to motivate through greed, there is really only one option remaining...
---
&gt; Also, I'm literally not the only person who has ever complained about comms
---
In a non shocker dave, you're not the only antisocial introvert on earth.
---
1) they aren't.
---
2) if they were, they'd kill your ship in seconds, and you'd have literally no way to fight them. When they were about, a decent sized coordinated fleet or a super was required to not die very fast. 
---
3) you seem to have no idea what you're doing.
---
Ctrl + F9
---
Blackout didn't kill those, umbrellas did lmao. 
---
It wasn't not being able to read local that stopped large/mid scale roams, it was being met by bosons, supers and faxes. 
---
Why do you think snatch fleets and trig comps started seeing such prominence?
---
Toucé
---
The potential of even a 'notification' or a 'simple couple of steps' every 'now and then' to detract from, or worse - derail us from getting focused and in the zone is much larger than previously thought.    
---
That's the whole point of the post - it SEEMS like this is a good idea. The reality is, we waste. more. time. by trying to take shortcuts and split our focus.  
---
I'd bet heavily that it took them a disparately longer time to do his homework - and at the risk of not having absorbed what was exercised.   
---
I'd suggest you look into it, at least.
---
Okay so I can either take your cryposts as gospel or fall back on the words of the developers of the game that have been stated over and over numerous times throughout the life of the game that eve isn't supposed to be safe. This is entirely separate from how long local has existed and the removal of local os just another method for them to achieve what they intend.
---
You're an idiot abd wrong.
---
Oh wow FEDUP, just wow
---
NP.

Missiles deal damage based on your targets size and speed relative to the size of your missiles. A large missile will not do much to a small and fast target, you need a small missile for that. However, a small missile will not reversely scale and do insane damage to a large and slow target, you need a bigger missile to do more damage to larger targets
---
Jf chains require an army of cyno alts if you aren't 2 cynos from a spot near jita so yeah it's hard. It's taking risk, it's managing and plexing an army of alts, it's keeping track of alot of things. Yeah it's easy with a good setup but I don't want to manage 5 cynos for my jf on top of cynos for my super, plus a fax alt, a dread alt, a sabre alt, etc. 
---
I do agree that this game needs more active mechanics. I do agree that cloaks and blops cynos are op.
---
If you're shooting them both at a larger, slower target, HML's will do better.
---
So thats why people keep chanting about how Eve should return to the old days? Cause its progression?
---
You are literally talking about regression whilst pretending its progression, you realise that right?
---
It has hurt the majority of non HS people and improved the minority of non NS people. Thats not a good change. You think you can fix NS without NS input? Thats how you got Rorqs in the first place, thats how you got citadel shit in the first place. Same people are saying today, a balanced blackout would work but this iteration is pure shite.
---
And heres the kicker, the blackout is nothing different from the rest of what CCP has pulled the last couple of years. You only think that but its the same arrogance that brought the rest of the changes. Its not progression, its just the same old shit recanned. 
---
I dont need to present any compelling reason since this is a test. Burden of proof lies on your shoulders. Make me see this wonderful outcome of yours.
---
And correction, I never said lets leave things the way there were. But just changing random shit doesnt fix something. Breaking things doesnt fix something. I want things that are thought out, not just "we throw shit on the wall and see what sticks".
---
And we havent had massive inflation, weve had deflation. PLEX went up but thats 1 item whilst everything else went down. Thats deflation, not inflation. Ask anyone who understands economics and they will explain this to you.
---
This will also not do shit to stagnant sov. Like literally you think this will do what? 
---
And lastly, its not the blocs bullying the little guys. Its the non NS PvP guys that are doing it. I havent dropped anything on any small group and neither will I. Why the fuck would I do that? I dont know anyone else doing it either outside of people screaming for "content".
---
2 out of five paragraphs mention DED. You disregarding what he said as 'obvious shit,' is pretty hilarious since that 'obvious shit,' directly counters what the fuck your crying about all over this subreddit.
---
i didn't say it wasn't useful but it won't do anything for you if you are trying to move a convoy of industrials, 1 cloaked cyno sabre later and its goodnight all your freighters, doesn't matter what your defense fleet is.
---
There is actually a glaring despairity in the medium missile class. Light missiles are disgustingly accurate, and cruise missiles have their niche with the it baseline retarded range and the fact that battleships are so slow. But heavies are in a bind because the nanocruiser concept has just gotten out of control. Relative to the missile design to damage them, cruisers are retardedly fast. There are a lot of reasons for this. By and large, cruiser hulls are the preferred hull for many soloists and avid pvpers. They provide the perfect mix of fitting room, baseline tank, maneuverability and firepower to hit up and down. The icon of the medium hull, the HAC, has almost completely replaced the battleship as the ship of the line in most major blocs. Honestly, cruisers are in too good of a spot right now in general, but at least for now they could really boost the application of heavies instead of merging cruisers or the speed-tank concept. Make heavies great again.
---
Or maybe you just wont be missed with your childish tantrums and risk averse gameplay.
---
The cost of such a big explosion is minerals and the manufacturing cost for all the the ammo and ships involved. Which is less than the insurance in most cases.
---
That's why big explosions *add* isk to the game.
---
True JFs require a lot of effort and infrastructure. Ultimately I think that's a good thing. I do want to point out that we can find a fairly large common ground once we stopped calling each other moron 😀
---
Stop shooting small fast things
---
That was an interesting read, ty for linking. 
---
But he states that most of it is in non NS environment. Im strictly talking about null. But would like to see why they are getting killed.
---
[https://youtu.be/OUmEy8PvgKw](https://youtu.be/OUmEy8PvgKw)
---
Wait, you can't have it both ways, you are either working under current mechanics or not lmao. You won't see people doing the same type of logistics runs that you saw back in those times because they're easier to interdict, with not only sabres, but also anchorable bubbles. Meanwhile you have better ways to move your own stuff through bridging either freighters or cloaky haulers, blockade runners, jf's, etc.
---
And if you have a R64 , it reveals Monazite and that even crits into the rarity of Bountiful or even Shimmering.. $\_$ will rain on top of you, my friend.
---
 [https://ore.cerlestes.de/moon](https://ore.cerlestes.de/moon)  very accurate and refreshes a lot through out the day, just hit F5 sometimes and you see the raw/refined value change depending on the Market.
---
Kill rights are fine tbh.          
---
They are working good and i lost multiple ships because of them.
---
I'm not saying that the data doesn't show a downward trend. I'm trying to point out that the limited data that we as players have access to can be interpreted in such a multitude of ways that a deeper analysis is required to make any good claims. Therefore you can't use "zkill numbers are dropping = overall activity is sinking" as your argument.  
---
That is also why i am making these assumptions in my reply, because i am trying to show you that we both are flying in the dark. Which in turn invalidates both our arguments.  
---
I think we are both in agreement that the data is incomplete and any assumptions based on that data are dubious.  
---
In my perception you seem charitable to that idea, but not if it goes against your own conclusions.
---
I think what made me reply to you in the first place is that i'd like to see you communicate the uncertainity of your analysis a bit more clearly, as you make it seem very clearcut, when in fact it's not.
---
With nullsec warfare meta i was trying to express that most blocs have turtled up due to drifters/blackout, and we havn't seen a clash of bloc level forces under blackout conditions.  
---
 I am aware of frat/legacy stuff, i just havn't had the time the last two weeks to actively follow what is going on there. But my understanding is that it is very skirmish-y, and there havn't been any major escalations/turning points yet.
---
Not really no. I see now he has a 2,1 as well which makes 4 in total. 1 and 4 are braindead suggestions. 2 and 3 are DED. 
---
It really doesnt counter shit. Because you are completely disregarding the fact that DEDs are extremely rare in space. You have to farm escalations for them to even be feasible and thats pretty much just supers that can give enough escas. And thats 1 super for every DED runner. Or smartbombing machs for rally points.
---
And you are not protected behind any fking gate to grind these. The guy is a fking solo guy who gets 1-2 escalations per 10h of scanning and he things thats fine and give suggestions based on that. He understands exactly jack shit about things and if you belive his BS then fine. But that only means you are slightly dumber than him, nothing more.
---
Wtf I want to upvotes Omeca on something? 😟
---
Welp, time for the Apocalypse i guess. Perhaps this could even be called.....Ragnarok?
---
Are any of the old devs still around? Dont think so which means intention of something that is 16 years old literally means jack shit. Its a sandbox dude, if people make something safer then thats that. You dont remove a core tenet. I dont get how hard this can be to understand.
---
Y'all got me slow clapping for Templis.
---
Yea, i meant DAU, that was a typo. And i agree that ccp might just try to push their own agenda. But then we also have to assume that all data that we get from them is doctored, which is a slippery slope.  
---
But in general i agree with you here, it is not a reliable metric as we don't have access to the raw data (as far as i am aware).
---
I can tell you : 
---
1. don't fly in something you can't afford to lose
---
2. Fit something to defend yourself on your pve ship
---
3. Get closer from your friends
---
4. Buy cheap frigates and destroyers to learn pvp
---
"  it is about how disingenous it is to take one trend in one data set and making an all encompassing claim based on it. "   
---
I guess you're right, I mean after all its ONLY the total number of players online at any given time and it is also the longest, most continuous piece of data available to players. That's totally meaningless data in a discussion involving the number of people online declining over time at an ever increasing rate...  
---
" I want you to take the data that you think proves your point, and then i want you to *explain* why and how that data proves your point, and how it, for the sake of your argument, hopefully correlates. "  
---
Ok I'll say it really slowly and use tiny words this time ok?  Less players bad, empty systems because less players =  boring.
---
Light missiles &gt; Frigates
---
Heavy missiles &gt; Cruisers/Battlecruisers
---
Cruise Missiles &gt; Battleships+
---
That's the general rule for missiles. Of course, this is very brief. As others have said, damage application is important for missiles. If the target flies faster than the missile's explosion velocity, they will take less than the full damage. The target's size also affects it for some reason, so things like target painters will allow you to make the target look bigger and thus let the missile do more damage.
---
Logged in on my market alt to find a mail from Aura that a mission had expired.  Won't even talk to me anymore =(
---
What the others said... Plus for video clarity remove the curser too with the Alt F9.
---
your initial facts aren't wrong, but your conclusions are
---
most rattlesnake bpcs either come from gotg running escalations or from people who run burner missions in venal (lots of groups do this). panfam never had the krab output of gotg
---
and fatigue reduction
---
The data was avg out by player as well. Taking into consideration what I have seen happening in my own alliance - Saying that the people who are still login in, are getting blown up 20% more and ratting 20% less is about right. But that is only people that are login in, the total login per day has drastically decreased.
---
well you can fly mimii. we are friends after all.
---
Link bumping effect to security switchers and that’s it. Green switchers - nothing works. Yellow/red - bumping works and gives proper consequences.
---
Oh ye no I agree. I dont only use zkill tho cause I say in combination. But ye thats correct, I take my own words regarding zkill with a large grain of salt. And honestly everything else aswell. I present it as I perceive it based on the data Ive investigated. But, I havent done regressions or interviews and so on and I really wont do any of it. I could certainly be wrong, no doubt. Most likely am in certain areas of it. But in general my data interpretations are often more right than wrong.
---
Its been quite bloody actually. Caps have been used more frequently but supers are still rarely used. I think weve had the biggest fights yet during last week actually cause Panfam seem to have settled in and have shown up to 2 major timers. But its slow work and multiple fights every day over timers (honestly Ive lost count, some days are packed with contested timers, some none at all and some uncontested). Doubt we will see big turning points tho, think its just a straight grind for months. I do however think we will see more goon involvement soon tho since Panfam has become active again, maybe that will speed up the process.
---
Wow, so many words, and every single one misses the point. Congratulations!
---
RR/SS were pumping TEST level MER numbers with 1/4th , 1/5th of the member count. Massive botting and similarly, massive nose dive.
---
No.
---
But since you want a ISK sink, let me introduce you to the  
---
# Leprechaun Titan Class
---
They have no shield and armor hitpoints and their structure HP is equal to the combined ISK value of the pilot, the pilots corp master wallet (if the player is not in a NPC corp) and the master wallet of the executor corp of the alliance.
---
Shooting a Leprechaun will drain the player wallet first, once empty it will switch to corp wallet, then go for the alliance wallet. They will also drop 10% of that amount as  Bounty Reimbursement Tags (like an ESS). Each empire have their own tags and the tags dropped depend on the Titan (so the Amarr Leprechaun will drop Amarr tags).
---
I mean this section " Overall, based on June activity and recent history, a reasonable estimate of daily July ship losses was 20,342 ships per day. Instead, New Eden saw an average of 24,388 per day. Of the additional ship losses over the expected amount, over 90% took place outside null sec. " 
---
Dunno how hes calculated that number but. 
---
Oh you mean the graph itself right? NS seems to have little change there as well but ye HS and LS are higher. I might be misreading it tho. Bit tired. But that could certainly be correct ye.
---
I wish we had real login numbers. But they are so tainted with bot movements and login events that they dont make sense anymore.
---
How will turning them off force google to sort it's shit out...
---
On the face of it it does sound neat but I'm not sure I'd want my cars odometer displayed like some digital license plate.
---
Pilot would like the info, they should have that sure. Don't know if scanning or bumping dudes need more leverage.
---
From a former Qualtrics admin - Kudos to you for the structuring of the survey!
---
I dont know why you're getting downvoted. You seem to be legitimately asking for advice.
---
Heres what I'd suggest: stop treating the game like its WoW. Eve isnt about just buying bigger and bigger ships with all of your money, Eve is about flying ships you can comfortably afford to lose.
---
First of all, you've found the war griefers in high sec. These trolls usually sit around the trade hubs and pad their killboard with free kills. Take your second character slot, fly that character (not in corp) to Jita and dock at the trade station. On that character, join Haulers Channel.
---
What you can do to avoid dying to war decs without leaving a Corp you seem to be enjoying is buy your ships on your Jita alt and create courier contracts to have someone deliver those ships to where your corp operates.
---
While at war, and in general in EVE, avoid flying ships you cant afford to replace. Get some exploration ships, go out into lowsec and run relic sites (there are lots of videos on youtube) in those. You will lose some to random campers and hunters, but the ISK will start to build up.
---
When you successfully get some relic loot, drop it off in the nearest highsec station and again, use courier contracts to move it to the trade hub and sell it with your alt.
---
If exploration isnt your thing, you might want to look into doing escalation sites or incursions, both of which pay a lot better than missions. The former you can probably do whilst at war but the latter will need you not to be and you will need to look at another Corp (or getting your CEO to move structures into another corp, which is trivial and they should be doing anyway).
---
When you build up some ISK, try some PvP. Buy a bunch of T1 frigates, fit them up, and head out to the faction warfare zones. If you want to chat more, message me in game (Twilight Winter) and I'll do what I can to answer your questions.
---
Nice rant but Pve newbro asking nothing to do with what your wrote
---
Im very careful with CCP and their handling of numbers (in general with every info coming from people in power) as they have shown a tendency to distort discussions by using wrong datasets. I belive this to also be one of those moments cause I cant get my head around how we would have more active players with half the login count in an era with rampant multiboxing. 
---
But ye, without raw data I dunno.
---
yeah, also, games are way unrealistic. we all should be in real space by now
---
I could, I am strongly considering a loki, but only have all the subs to 4 atm. Not sure I'd fly one with less than 5's
---
Don't worry Balkor, We still love you.
---
There are green skins for other ships ;)
---
Give us! I want a jumpable KS. 
---
It should also be able to instakill all small gangs whenever I feel like it. No counters. Including WHs. And I should be able to finally control the ads in it. Also I want skins for it. Plus it should be able to destroy planets with its sheer gravitational pull. In fact, when its on grid everyone will just slowly move towards me. And when they are close enough I can just dock them up and steal them, no matter who owns it.
---
Think thats about it. If I come up with more brilliant ideas Ill hit you up!
---
There where no drastic changes to HS/LS. So you could interpret the data that the nullsec guys are hanging out more in HS/LS.
---
This is exactly what EVE used to be like btw. Seeing 2k npcs/24 hours meant it was kinda a big deal for finding people and 10k/24hrs meant you were going towards capitals or near someones staging.
---
It's been nice to see the bots get axed. (Mostly) Also somewhat unexpected, because I felt like they'd all just develop automated dscan tools and they simply haven't. 
---
Thx CCP!
---
I feel this on a deeply personal level thanks for the laugh and introspection have your updoot
---
I can't stand the ads but I send iSK to cover my end. Got me my loads of golden wrecks and monocle.
---
Might be doing it to a dozen people at once.
---
That would make sense. MER will also be an interesting read. Should be out soon.
---
The problem is the wording of the question. By answering "no" what you are saying is, "I stopped my gaming activity when it started causing problems with other people" which inherently implies your gaming caused problems with other people, it's a loaded question.
---
Disregard fun, acquire assets.
---
Dismissed her guidance a few too many times, huh?
---
12/10
---
PCU is the number of logged in accounts. Not the number of players. So if multiboxed farms, with a decent chunk of them probably bots, are not logging in anymore the PCU is gonna drop. Because the people that are doing pvp are hardly going to multibox 10-20 accounts regularly.  
---
Is that a net negative for the game? I doubt it, especially if it you look at the markets and the relaxation of plex/mineral prices. (There is a way to make this a solid argument against blackout, maybe you will figure it out?)
---
And once again, i want you to explain your point by analysing your available data. "Less players bad" is your thesis. Now you need to show me, by analysing/discussing the data that at this point in time the activity of players in space has dropped, and that this has a net-negative outcome on the health of the game compared to pre-blackout activity.  
---
I know that that is harder than just hitting downvote and screeching about how blackout is bad, but maybe it will help you form a more well rounded perspective that isn't warped by your own anecdotal experiences.
---
Here's a little lesson in trickery
---
I wont be surprised that if the bots evolved, because they probably will. But at least you have a higher chance of wrecking them vs before. 
---
Similarly, in major alliances strongholds, you're seeing more consolidation of ratting and less carebearing with null becoming more dangerous, which i support principally.
---
I'm super interested to hear how you'd approach the task of slapping caps and supers around to promote more small gang and subcap warfare.
---
What are your thoughts?
---
But seriously... is it more the blackout or the invasions causing losses from stupid people travelling with their gains?
---
Hey I remember you from -FA- times. Always enjoyed flying with you. Hope you are doing well.
---
You were one of the good guys, always eager to take a fight and getting better at the game.
---
Now I think of it, the backlog of killmails must be huge. I wonder how much space all those killmails occupy?
---
Is this Stain guy trying to get ships into his local area so he can get a kill or 2?
---
lol no :P
---
you have to FEEEEL the ship. make you and the ship one, then, this happens
---
Will be interesting to see. Would love to see the Sub vs unSub data aswell. But that probably wont happen.
---
aura doesnt care for us oldies anymore, only wants the new bloods
---

Was it something you did?

Reminds me of my wife. -0.16 and nobody knows, what's going on. Luckily this is (mostly) temporal. Can't speak for Aura, though. Maybe bring her some flowers?

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
thats why they made green tengu skins
---
[https://ore.cerlestes.de/](https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore)
---
I was honestly shocked to see what happened over the last 4years to nullsec when I came back after I heard about the blackout. Super/Titan ratting and Rorquals in belts with panic buttons.. wtf?
---
I feel like cloaky stuff needs a rebalance (something like cloak needs some kind of fuel to run), and supers/titans/rorqual are in a wrong spot right now.
---
Those ships still work for ratting... Drones are just easier since they are low attention. The player is making the choice to use low ehp ships. That is balance lol. You are taking the higher risk low effort/attention ship over the lower risk higher effort/attention ship.
---
"with a decent chunk of them probably bots"
---
lol go ahead and show the facts that back that up... oh wait you can't.  
---
" Because the people that are doing pvp are hardly going to multibox 10-20 accounts regularly. "  
---
You should watch the code streamer on INN fly his 20-30 account fleet ganking people in highsec.  
---
" but maybe it will help you form a more well rounded perspective that isn't warped by your own anecdotal experiences. "   
---
Your entire argument is anecdotal experiences, you have no facts and no numbers backing up your viewpoint. You just distract from this be demanding that everyone else go get the numbers and prove you wrong yet you offer no numbers you prove yourself correct.
---
he dropped a bomb before, doing insane damage to himself and the opponent and then wins because of it
---
Luckily I do neither.
---
Bombers have quite hard time shooting other frigates since they are using Torpedoes which is a battleship sized weapon and because how missiles work  in eve (Not going to explain missile mechanics).  
---
Because of that, the bomber in the video shoots his bomb while moving in the same direction. The interceptor (blindly?) follows the bomber and they are both get caught in the explosion (therefore "kamikaze maneuver").
---
Messy biomatter will only make things worse. Bring some cap boosters or idk...
---
skill injectors were a mistake
---
Wasn't this also the case in lowsec? Doesn't seem to be anymore, but I could have sworn it was a week ago.
---
No squids here :)
---
I got the same bug. The screen was darker and i wasnt able to klick anything. Alt F4 was my friend
---
2-3 Guys in PvP AF V a single PvE Battleship, yeah I guess that is as fair a fight as 2-3 Haw Dreds
---
Wow, thank you very much for all the great info. Definitely, going to make a second char later in order to be able to trade in high sec. Also going to go omega and get some industry going for now and try out relic  sites.
---
Yup same here, however alt f4 wasn't working either
---
You could also try alt+shift+q, that also works.
---
Current rewards are in fact not shit.
---
Raf link gets new player 1m SP. Referring account gets rewards when any of 3 things happen. New player buys the Meteor pack, triggers all three events  (buy anything, buy plex, buy omega time all must be directly from eveo website) and referring person gets two weeks omega and 4x cerebral accelerators.
---
I'd recommend the new player also gets the starter pack dlc. Undocking with 2.4m sp to start the game means you can throw a bunch at nav/engineering and still get skilled into a couple different ships.
---
I recently did this with an alpha minus the meteor pack of course and for 5 bucks had a nearly fully trained myrmidon pilot on the Undock.
---
/u/ccp_falcon can we fast track this guy's ban we've been killing him all over EVE
---
Afk solo orca
---
Tbf heavy missiles won’t do full damage to cruisers
---
Personally I’d use heavy missiles against  battle cruisers and up but if you have to use heavies for missions try a caracal navy issue as you get a bonus to application or a bellicose with a target painter 👍
---
All eve ships 3d printed look like sex toys
---
just alt tabbing very fast nothing to see here
---
(sponsored message btw)

Cam we wait to ban him untill I'm online next to join the km ;)

Unless it was a remote doomsday, so OP so awesome.

Bring back remote cyno aoe doomsday.
---
A ton of new players want to try industry, because people like building things, and because the career agent missions give you the - entirely inaccurate - impression you will get rich punching buttons on the industry menu.  
---
The reality is that doing industry collectively is hard, and not very profitable. You will be competing with heavy-duty industrialists who have better structures than you will, and armies of alts.  
---
That said, if you want to do mining and industry with friends, my advice would be to not build a structure, as that makes you elligible to wars, which means you won't be able to mine and the structure itself may well end up blown up somewhere down the road.  
---
Second, you will be competing with a billion other "newbie-friendly-RL-comes-first-we're-just-chilling-in-HS" corps for recruits, so do not expect hundreds of eager people to flock to your corporation. However, if you are serious about it and you can build a cool corp from a small core of people, then maybe in a year or two you will have something good going.  
---
Good luck!

When you put it like WH space living does sound attractive to me!

&gt; His justification is that it is just a [synchronization device](https://imgur.com/bBwHgkW).

uhhhm, ok...
---
"Warp drive deactivated"
---
But no ship can tank the site exploding?
---
What race ships is good for pvp? I think it's either minmatar or gallente simply because people use neuts and projectile/drones don't use capacitor.
---
Am I right?
---
&gt;On TIS a while ago falcon and hilmar said that PCU is down, but DUA is up/stayed the sane. As that is the most reliable data we will get, i'll go with that. 
---
I do not consider what Hilmar and Falcon say reliable unless I can see the figures. And guess what? They came up with a metric that we can't see.  
---
But they wouldn't lie to us, now... would they?  
---
I mean, I'm all for burning down the previous cancerous meta, and I agree with Hilmar's characterization of the sandbox having turned into concrete. Better late (by years!) than never, I suppose? That TiS episode just felt like desperation rather than like optimism to me, but I guess time will tell.  
---
Enjoying the blackout, btw.
---
So just as likely as you being a goon-spy who is trying to keep this tool private to your own tribe because the author didn't restrict access?
---
It fails, now what?
---
I didn't say it wouldn't be worth it; I said you wouldn't make as much. You're balancing the reward by reducing risk.
---
What happens when it fails?
---
Give it time, she will eventually get over it.
---
Just sitting back waiting for the reality check right now of just how real they can make the "eve is dying" meme work.
---
Fun fact: Emergency warp saved my super once.
---
If Squizz does it by himself? It won't. If every site, or even a majority of them that used adsense did it Google would have a fire under their ass to improve their screening process so that they don't lose significant amounts of revenue.
---
What he doesn't mention is that he makes anywhere from 1000$ to 2500$ per month depending on the month if my calculations are right and thats alone from zkillboard
---
Yes, the malicious ads come and go in waves typically in around 2-3 days. When a new browser exploit aligns with the ability to bypass google's screening.
---
tldr; yes, heavy missiles are bad. They've been bad for years.
---
How'd that happen? Big fight?
---
Hahahaha.... Imagine thinking this would even work....
---
  Why is Facebook still a thing despite all the dodgy shit zukk has done? Just switch on your adblock if you're scared of Google ads.
---
I'm still get the impression you're a little too emotionally invested in Eve online to look at this issue objectively, but all right.
---
Sounds like it was fun but being a casual player and needing to make a 4am structure bash, I be a single mum. Sounds like you had to be more than a casual back then. In saying that I came back to high Sec long before the blackout, it just suits my play style more.
---
Been wondering if solo in a carrier is possible or at all fun. 
---
Can someone tell me if carriers with T1 drones are at all useful in a drive-by? Not talking about killing caps. just smaller shit.
---
Very nice shot :D
---
music
---
I got a message how my omega status is about to expire. It look like the system has credited me with a free Omega. Anybody else?
---
(also I suspect account could be hacked - though no clue why would anyone want to activate Omega on it?)
---
i kept my loki skills at 4. since i tend to loose them pretty often to absurd situations. so does legions. tengu is alwas at V. still no t3cs on my RP Fw toon though.
---
&gt; There are already three primary anti capital ships in the game. The dreadnaught. The Supercarrier with torpedo fighter bombers. The titan with its doomsday. 
---
Tell me, how is that not "bringing even more capitals"? Those are literally all capital ships, when I was talking about an anti-capital ship that is itself sub-capital.
---
&gt; The stealth bomber is also already fantastic for killing caps if you have enough. 
---
The problem is that you have to really have **a lot** of them to be able to fight caps. That is not "fantastic". Even then, several capitals will completely obliterate the bombers instead because of how squishy the bombers are, and how good caps' application on subcaps is.
---
&gt; So really, what you want is something nearly zero risk for the largest reward in the game. Right..... 
---
I'm not sure if you are trolling or completely missing my point to make this statement. But in case it was the latter, I'll elaborate.
---
Right now, you have this thing called capital umbrella in the game that is the apex of the problem. However, even if you scale it down, you can still see people literally baiting small gangs on a ship just to drop a cap or two on them. That is the essence of "nearly zero risk" that you've mentioned - caps are too good at fighting subcaps compared to how good subcaps are at fighting caps, so you can just drop caps every single time without the threat of losing them. And that is a problem.
---
There have been numerous suggestions, both good and bad ones, on how to balance the insane jump in both EHP and damage when you switch from subcaps to caps, and introducing a focused anti-cap ship which is itself sub-capital is but one of them, which would force cap pilots to at least consider the risk instead of just dropping caps because there's none.
---
When caps were introduced to the game, some of the major factors preventing their proliferation were their cost and the required skills. However, with how much industry has grown since then and with the introduction of skill farms, getting a cap alt is now so easy that there's no prohibitive isk, mineral or skill cost, especially now that you can dock even titans. However, their strength has remained relatively unchanged compared to subcaps, and in some cases it was even buffed (see support fighters).
---
This has led to a situation where a smaller subcap fleet under threat of capitals being dropped on them, but those capitals generally aren't under any threat thanks to their strength disparity.
---
But she will always remind you of that one time that you let a mission expire..
---
I do. That doesn't mean that i'm not going to call out people for knowingly enabling the distribution of malware.
---
Miners do not have rights. Kill them all in game
---
Find a mining community either in high Sec or in null, solo can be ‘boring’ unless you have 8+ accounts to keep you busy. Being new I would suggest joining a Corp, people are always willing to help you learn and eve can be a big learning curve.
---
hier hier, as a member of a small alliance in dronelands, actively hunted by solar and triumvirate and CO2 jumping through wormholes once a month at us. you just had to know what to do on what time of day, not as hardcore as the days you speak of here. but still... eve is massivly soft now, and i mean the playerbase, not the game.
---
blackout removed cloaky campings awful effects if the camper was afk. its so amazingly brilliant for nullsec its obscene for anyone to argue otherwise.
---
This is a superb post!
---
&gt;when we would rat or mine, it was an organized thing. We would have people with alts watching gates on choke point. 
---
I've tried telling people this in comments that we used to do this. I'm glad you made a complete post about it (and a much better one than I would have managed).
---
&gt;if you were lucky enough to have a few freighter pilots in corp, you would load those up to, and you would form a pvp escort fleet
---
I really miss those fleets. Since the freighter was a moving target, the hostiles would have to react and come in what they had to get the loot pinata. Sometimes the freighter made it, sometimes not. Was stressful but a hell of a lot of fun.
---
You have not been in delve or esoteria recently have you? 99% of rorquals use regular t2 drones now.
---
I would not even be sad, with the new voice...
---
support skills on weapons are a big part of tracking or application.
---
missiles moreso than turrets, you will find if you shoot a battleship that is not moving those heavy missiles will hit for full damage. but the kestrals damage will also fit for full damage but the heavies are capable for more total. if that makes sence.
---
im sure its been said already. but missiles take explosion size (sig) explosion velocity (speed against the speed of your enemy) before the damage they actually apply into the equation. 
---
the benfit to missiles is they CAN apply full damage from max range, whereas turrets deal less and less damage the further out you go ie: falloff. or using lower dps ammotypes on turrets.    most people who fly caracals fit heavy Assault missiles (the medium sized rockets) or Rapid light missile launchers (the cruiser sized version of light missiles)
---
Aeon.. the monitor of supers lol
---
Heavy missile Launchers are the 'artillery' of the missiles line, alpha, range, less dps. realising this may sort the problems you have personally with heavy missiles
---
CALDARY SUPREME you gallante fool and your little toy drones!! :)
---
Lets stop right here, before we end up putting the damn thing on GitHub ready to use :D
---
snigg likes to feed in delve
---
Speak to snuffed out, they have a great reputation as a merc corp. Very trustworthy and effective.
---
All those ratting and mining bots will just switch to relic bots now. Without local they are even harder to catch than before.
---
Feels like there are more relic bots flying around now in nullsec than regular players. Well played CCP.
---
Miners build your ships..
---
I'm starting my PI alt right know and so far I know how to set up basics. Would you recommend something to read/see to know more on how to optimise the output from the planet?   
---
I'm not interested in anything more then T2 products that I can produce from A to Z at the same place. Clearly that's my (semi)passive income alt.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
active tank are the ones you turn on, shield boosters, resist ampliers, they use cap but they let you stay on the field longer and they don't bloom your signature.
---
I'm definitely invested since that's my hobby for few recent years. Still, I believe that my oppinion on Blackout and on it's consequences is objective.
---
Botting (with it's frequent partner RMT) is one of the worst things that could happen to MMO game. AFK ratting is better, but still really bad. Why? Because you don't play the game if you botting or AFK ratting. You just run whatever you need in the background and make game worse for others, making their activities mean less.
---
Blackout adresses both problems quite effectively and it should persist. And if some of nullsec groups depend on (semi-)AFK ratting or botting to survive, then these groups deserve to starve and disband. Adapt to new corrected and better game rules. Or do not adapt.
---
hahaha did I touch your delicate feelings?
---
Hasn't made sense to me why you have to pay to kill someone that someone else couldn't. They should be paying for people to kill. I think this would make for some great bounty hunter/police pvp content in high sec.
---
Can you find them on market?
---
It is like ice cream. People have different favorite flavors and sometimes their favorite changes. Someone will argue mint chocolate chip is best while someone else says vanilla.
---
There is no wrong answer. If you are able to fit the ship properly and put it position to apply it's strength to another ship's weakness, you will win 90% of the time.
---
Shame you wont take cash. Id happily slide some RL isk your way to hide the ads and keep the servers running.
---
Thank you for the work and effort you put into one of the cornerstones of the community.
---
Nope, you went full retarded and I was just trying to bring you back... what? I questioned your shitty gameplay sitting in Jita local kiddo?
---
That was a bug or some people say a short term "feature" by CCP.
---
the only time i use autopilot is by mistake
---
I mined enough in my venture to buy my first procurer (13m at the time) I found a mining community and followed them to null and back to high sec. I’m a casual player, I love to chat to my ‘space pals’ and make things for others to explode. Being casual I get more enjoyment doing what I do, then sitting in a pvp fleet waiting for my husband to tell me to log off. Just because some people find it boring,  doesn’t mean it needs fixing. Make it fun!
---
I mean... that's not what this is. You're buying the opportunity to kill the person without consequence. 
---
The bounty hunter thing is for just that, claiming bounties. The police thing is also just that, the ability to attack criminals.
---
collateral payout to the person who started the contract.
---
Hmm is this LORDE best effort of kicking brave out of scalding 😂
---
And it crashes/kills the single best way for a newbro to make decent isk in the game from the start.
---
Let's not forget the addition of rigs which are stacking penalised for dps but not for tank.
---
Alerts are created via the JavaScript alert api.
---
Still works ^
---
Instead of sorting icons by object size, sorting by icons currently show you a mix of celestials, structures, and ships tangled together. 
---
It would make more sense if there was.... any sense in the order. A suggested order: drones, ships, deployables, structures, celestials, wrecks, see bad mock-up here: https://i.imgur.com/U6wpTSx.png
---
We need more structures in T5
---
Blackout fixed boting issue, This is simply avoxing.
---
Dont lie about poor people trying to make some isk with sync device.
---
Or fit an ewar module. I put a nos in my extra high slot, pick a rat that isn't doing something I need to prioritize, and then focus on the others.
---
Its an oldie but a goodie. I was losing lots of drones until I did that.
---
Ur mum is my pet fam, what now?
---
You're asking the wrong person.
---
I do enjoy nullsec piracy as well, especially in the blackout era, but I wouldn't call myself enough of an authority on it to publish a guide. Mostly I just use an in-corp spy alt to identify targets, and a cloaky PvP ship to farm them. This has been my formula for wormholes in recent years, and post-blackout I extend it to null.
---
As a casual and primarily solo player, I have a few issues with this form of piracy though. First, I kill mostly T2 fit ratters, miners, and PvP ships. Its rarely even worth looting the wrecks, Ransoms are out of the question because I'm trying to stay ahead of a standing fleet and have no time for conversations. So there's no isk in it. 
---
I also have a negligable psychological impact on my targets. Standing fleet chat will be like "welp..." and then they forget you're there 2 seconds later. 90% of the fun of "being the villain" is terrorizing your victims. Maybe you do better in this regard, but you have a level of commitment and effort which isn't realistic for many folks.
---
Corp infiltration stuff works well with smaller null and wormhole entities, but I think I did discuss that in the article a bit.
---
So yeah, feel free to gatekeep your own piracy all you want. This is just an opinion piece anyway, about my own playstyle. And if you have any pointers on how to be a better, or more isk-positive nullsec pirate, I would be happy to learn.
---
Yeah this is what we want the developers spending time on.
---
Syncing device you mean imput broadcasting ?
---
Except when it's International Talk like a Pirate Day... Everyone's a pirate then. :)
---
Just train to Drake and use drones vs the frigs.
---
Karmafleet is recruiting
---
People have been asking for this for years. I completely agree. Even just a pulse that decloaks system wide would be an improvement
---
As all slaves shall serve their masters

I like eating calamari, warmed up by Neutron blasters ;)

sorry i always spell it wrong and always realize late, caldari :D
---
Its the only game that gives the shakes...
---
&gt;messy biomatter 
---
new alt name confirmed
---
Yeah getting that many characters into a fleet on the same tick is weird. The rest of the story depends since you can fleet warp a squad and video would be needed to prove all lasers went on at once. But that statement is an admission of broadcasting so lul.
---
Someone can make the killrights they have publicly available.
---
It's something I've never really explored despite only really doing pvp anymore. Do they usually just sell them through local or contracts as well?
---
I started during RMR, I think the addition of rigs was an even bigger potential buff.  Ships became far more tanky after rigs.
---
How about user definable order :P
---
Still hunting and hoping for frags every time I log in. Except when doing locust fleets.... then I wonder how people can live being so retarded. How you doing?
---
Imagine being excited about being a mindless F1 monkey and hating people who don’t want to be part of the blobs.  Good portion have tried it and we left for a reason.
---
Alt F4 activates your 4th mid slot
---
Lol nothing to lose. We we get evicted there is no “ asset safety “ we get the big ole middle finger. So I don’t see how this makes sense.
---
They did do it better than anyone else, but they were also extremely picky about targets and wouldn't engage anything that may have presented a risk to them. Top hypocrisy.
---
Yeah it's really not that complicated.  No need to have a Java monolith black box to do this task.  Just set up the script the way you want it, and then either just run it on demand or do what I do and have it run every time you launch the eve launcher.  (So it constantly syncs my settings across my alts)
---
smells fishy....
---
NC got glassed by goons, NC moved noone is talkin about it because it wasnt somethign that changed the eve universe or got this l33t fights that was promised to the goon linemembers.
---
You're supporting a feature that not only reduces the amount of ganking in NS, but will also push people toward big blobs with super umbrellas, making them even safer than before. That's exactly the opposite of what the game needs : people spread across more systems, lowering the efficacy of their intel network and response fleets. 
---
There are known problems that are completely stupid and should have been nerfed long ago, a few examples? 
---
Did the cynoes got nerfed?   
---
Did stacking 30/40k people in a single fortress region was nerfed?   
---
Did citadels and tether got nerfed?   
---
Did no-fatigue-ansiblex bullshit got nerfed?   
---
Did rorquals got nerfed to being a support ship again? 
---
Nah, cause CCP choose to throw a bone at the dogs that were loudly barking instead of fixing the shit they've done in the past years.   
---
So yeah, people will adapt and HTFU but i'm pretty sure that you'll be the one ranting in a couple of months when there will be nothing left in null but 4 blobs with super umbrellas and nothing inbetween.
---
I don’t really get the immense vitriol from the nullbois. Especially Goons of all people. You guys have been spoon fed for years and WHs have been pretty much left as an afterthought consistently. You have the umbrellas, you have the massive fleets of titans and the countless armies of F1 pushers to utilize as we as limitless sources of wealth... so what exactly is there to be so pissed about again??
---
At least you didn't just activate autopilot like that newbie from a few weeks back lmao
---
No, just no.
---
sure. if you do it also for lowsec and hisec.  
---
Else: No.
---
Yep, I am with some people I know from another game. We started up our own corp but they have been playing for years, with 4 of the 7 of us being experienced wormholers. Figured this would give me an idea of what it would be like trying to get a home hole established.
---
they shpuld charge you to log in ontop of subscribtion fee.
---
reddit should also charge you for posting
---
You seem mad? Glad to see your remember I am gay, not a good look using it as a derogatory term though. 
---
So you basically think that PL didn't create this situation? Where you expanded your super-fleet far quicker than almost anyone else in the game, even the largest of alliances, and now you are suggesting the whole "Do as I say, not as I did". You are a hypocrite mate. 
---
Supers and titans were fine in small numbers, until PL increased their super-cap fleet numbers exponentially causing everyone else around them to do the same in order to compete. This is on you. 
---
Now for the additional personal insults, my life is great, thanks. You understand that pointing out hypocrisy in a persons position does not mean their life must be terrible, it is simply pointing out a flaw in someones thinking. No one is butt-mad, it happened, but the complete and utter hypocrisy dripping from your former comment needed a reply, and that is what I did. To get such an insulting remark from you must have hit a nerve, eh?
---
Mind the TM mark Sir :D
---
I like the Blackout, but there are a lot of rose-tinted glasses in this thread. Many things in Eve are objectively better than they were in the past. And most of the things that were done to make Eve harder are what drives the super organization required to thrive in Eve.
---
I want to crawl back into Omega Status after a long break. Is there any non frustrating way in doing it?   
---
Couldn't find any source on how to get back into this game without using money cuz i am broke as hell.
---
The only thing you should watch out is cap neut. But I run a lot of deds in my Loki just fine.
---
Fuck you!11 ò.ó
---
On a serious note: Not a good idea... Wenever you dive into null or low, you are already expecting to lose whatever you are piloting! Certainty that a normal roam would end up losing more than the ship price isn't such a good idea... Besides, we are already having extra sinks shoved down our rears... Let's not talk about more soo soon plz.
---
Not enough, we need a fee for warping too, possibly also speeding fines if going more than 1km/s.
---
Here's my suggestion. Grab yourself some cheap ships, some cruisers, something you don't mind losing. Dive past that gate. Maybe ask a few people in your Corp for a late night roam. Just do it. You'll lose ships, sure. But you'll learn what worked and what didn't. 
---
Then build it up again.
---
It's like sex. Your first time is always daunting and scary, but sometimes it'll be fun and sometimes it'll be a pain in the arse. And sometimes it's better with friends and sometimes you just want to do it alone. But you need to build a ship and get over that sense of lose.
---
Anything you take into low sec, count that as destroyed, any time you have with it is extra time and you should spend it trying to kill someone before they kill you.
---
And don't get salty when you die. That just means they were luckier.
---
How do you safely fly an Orca around null?
---
It's called crop rotation.
---
Now we get to deploy North and fuck with all the small alliances.
---
I second this plug. I've been there, and the community has been just awesome... Can you imagine goonie and NC players discussing how best to help Noobies like me...
---

That make sense, just not the one you are looking for.
---
I'm almost grabbing a t2 venture and eating some Mercoxit. lol
---
ahahah, thanks!
---
If you already are in a large Corp, search someone who regularly roams and latch onto him.
---
Me: solo roams in a torp battleship. Shoots at frigates for lols when I 1 shot them.
---
Short story: Joined European Goonion while in -FA- , lived with them until Vee/most people back then left the game, left the game aswell and came back after blackout.
---
Docking permission....denied.
---
&gt;my loki skills at 4. 
---
&gt;i tend to loose them pretty often
---
:thinking:
---
God FedUp is retarded
---
Yea I was. I visited family in the area for a bit after ene
---
It's funny you say there is too much fuss about everything in blocs. You can literally disappear with your friends into nothingness in goons and no one cares. 5 of us have been hunting 0.0 for the last week and yielded the alliance close to 100b in kills. Others have been roaming in a group of 2-3 just having fun. Sure plenty are krabs just sitting in theta waiting to drop supers...but you are whatever you make yourself to be.
---
I am down with just being done haha.
---
That guy clearly has a gaming chair...
---
\&gt; to absurd situations   
---
dont cherry pick.
---
only use Valk 2s on battle ships, and RFV for everything else
---
Yeah, I'm a total bad ass space pirate.
---
My alt is a carebear.
---
Yes, "absurd situations"
---
Nice, EG was pretty dominant. SV was approaching gud level. Then we opened recruitment no questions asked to the blob. Now it seems like every brain dead monkey just wants welp/drunk roams and 110% srp.
---
Maybe try Eve Uni, they pride them selves in teaching people the ropes. Perhaps you will find something you enjoy doing and then you can start to specialise in that.
---
"new"
---
Uhhh anything that would make people not want to move around and hunt, rat, explore etc is a dumb idea.
---
Not new. Ccp kill the barge mining with rorqual. Ccp kill the vni ratting. Ccp taxes more the market. It always fuck the small guy.
---
Jesus Grath, you are obviously retarded.  If you look closely at the back of a $20 bill you will see the CCP planted bots faking the moon landing.  All bots in Eve are 100% legit players, they were just born near Chernobyl and have multiple appendages granting them godlike multiboxing skillz.
---
No they dont. They mine like the drones they are in game
---
gets pointed by a ratting vni dies to a npc dread.  
---
warps in without the nullification sub. to scout.  
---
has the support processor. while solo  
---
ejected in a pos and gets bumped. ( still dont have a clue how this went through)   
---
and the list goes on.
---
My thoughts: You were right, your idea is terrible. Lore wise, I have no idea who maintains the gates in the EVE, but like NPC stations they are providing a reliable service free of charge (sometimes you have traffic control though).
---
I mean, you're going after PVE fits that can't really fight back in a Loki, hoping to club seals.  You have no room to whine about getting dropped on.
---
My point still stands: no miners= no ships for your L33T pvp
---
You are already replaced. Look at diamond miners. They are the future. You are disposable.
---
well, dead bots vs docked bots does seem like an improvement.
---
Never played game, throws around in game jargon like nullsec.  Seems legit.
---
I think a big issue here is content generation. I've been in a lot of alliances where people just refuse to make their own content. So it falls on the upper tier guys to organize shit and get people out and flying because if they dont then those lazy people will go join an alliance that will do that for them.
---
apparently saying Hilmar is a wormholer is vitriol now?
---
Yes, totally legit, nothing to see here.
---
Nothing in isk value changed at all. They didn't nerf your haven, colossal, or bfg. You just have a slim chance to die now. And by you, no I don't mean you because nothing at all changed in delve. There is a super umbrella that squashes out content within 60 seconds. The only thing blackout did was make hunting a thing, excavators pretty risky, and it stupid to afk rat sitting still. 
---
Prior to rorquals people used subcaps all the same to make isk. If you have a single person in a whole alliance watch a gate to your krab pocket you get the same Intel as with local chat before.
---
&gt; And the "blue every fucker in 40 jumps" attitude isn't to blame? How about half-galaxy spanning coalitions? 
---
Part of that is due to CCREEEE making Sov warfare such total fucking canceraids that even people that like to PVP would rather blue up than participate in shit wanding.
---
DSCAN is to OP - its making nullsec to easy.
---
Flying around The Spire the last few days I noticed that this Corp now has four Ishtar alts ratting on a regular basis in the system OSW-0P (the last system in a pipe constellation). They also have alt ‘eyes’ 7-8 K sat off the entrance gate in a corvette. I’m getting suspicious that these are BOTs - not 100% sure yet but if not BOTS it’s definitely somebody multi-boxing like a pro. Watching with cloaky eyes in system so far the Ishtar’s always start to warp when anybody non blue  takes the gate into their system, then once docked up a lone Dominix will undock and carry on running the sites previously being run by the Ishtar alts.
---
I have managed to kill two so far by logging in already in that system so ‘eyes’ don’t see me entering, second time 30 minutes after killing one I got a salty mail (in bad English) hoping my mother dies and saying I’m a ‘son of scorpion’ . . . 
---
I was surprised to see PH alts so far away from their home regions ratting it up in Skeleton Crew’s main constellation. I’m also surprised that Skeleton Crew allow it - I mean those four ‘foreign’ Ishtar’s make that system light up on Dotlan, making it more attractive to visit for roamers. I can only assume that Skeleton Crew are so inactive they ave given Chinese botters the green light to help keep their defensive indexes up. Perhaps somebody in that alliance would care to explain the logic behind letting Chinese bots use their best system?
---
I believe people made abundantly clear how that solo mining is a very popular carrier choice lol
---
If you really want to do it, and do it well, you are looking at Venture&lt;Barges&lt;Exhumer/Orca.
---
Exhumers go when you do not want to mine AFK, they do mine slightly better than the ORCA, they do not offer the massive tank and hold thought, and if you are in a fleet, and a pal is buffing with an orca, the Exhummer becames the right choice by far, since the massive boost to cycle time on miner makes you eat ore fields way too quick.
---
Go Orca when you are alone in the belt, without a buffer and really don't want to worry about your ship in space. I do not recommend the full hands off approach... Check the game window every 10 minutes or less if inside orca. Do not go AFK if inside Exhumer.
---
Check /r/evejobs for a corp that sounds fun and don't be afraid to jump ship if it's not working out for you.
---
no, you will only see that there are kill rights available for purchase in local, overview, and you can buy it through the item selection window.
---
You should come out of your hole once in a while, maybe then what you're talking about would start to make some sense.
---
&gt;~~crop~~ crap rotation
---
FTFY
---
In lowsec only podding will give kill right (unless the pod was already suspect or you had limited engagement with him)
---
Hotslogs lol
---
NC and all of Panfam are consolidating under a new Supercap Umbrella in TKE, Geminate is their new rental region. The rest has been abandoned.
---
No l33t fights were promised to goon line members.  It was obvious from the form up in 1dq that NC weren't going to seriously contest the deployment.
---
So if I get killed by someone, I get a killright on my character sheet for them. I can set the price on that killright and make it available to anyone I want. Then when anyone sees the target around, they should be a different color indicating they have an available kill right. The player can then activate that killright and a suspect timer will start on the target.
---
I agree, and thats the point. All changes affect groups differently. 
---
Most Waffles make isk on their Waffles chars tho. Not at the same volume as Delve folks obv but we get enough and dont need to replace Rorqs.
---
You could repackage your ship to get rid of them like current killmarks.
---
Yeah, I think you might be overestimating how many ships and how much money my character has. I tried to rush through the gate, lost my ship. Came back in a pod, couldn't afford to buy a new ship so I am in my free Corvette. I managed to buy a new rail gun, but am working my way back up now. I am sure if I had years in the game and had built up massive amounts of money and ships they wouldn't be a problem, but I am not there yet.
---
THIS ALL CAP SHITPOST EXTRAVAGANZA IS SO FUCKED ITS GIVING PEOPLE AIDS!!   ALSO FUCK YOU CCCP AND YOUR NAZI INSPIRED BLACKOUT DESIGNED TO OPRESS KRABBERS AND RUIN HONEST PVP!!!!
---
Did it for 4 months my total data usage was about 6 gigs a month which really quite small for high activity dual boxing
---
That would be neat, but when it's re-packaged and ship specific info is stripped, it would be gone. Using the current killmark system would make it easier on the devs and require minimal extra effort.
---
Looking at the Sov Maps, it's interesting to watch for sure.  Just kinda neat to see all the small alliances taking up space.
---
Well Rorqs are poorfit now, just rorq hull itself is like 1.1B, another 2-300m for fittings and rigs, and then 100m for a swarm of mining drone 2's. It cuts yield in half but the "payback" time is cut to a third.
---
I'm old... what do you mean by glassed?  Sad to hear about no l33t fights also though.
---
It's not about whether you're able to kill it, but making it public increases exposure / opportunity to kill.
---
Any idea why war targets are showing neutral in local for me ? I am not getting the red/white star as it used to be. There a setting I need to change somewhere?
---
I just threw out a number. I wish I could be more accurate, but there is no easy way to track.... lol.
---
Quality of life suggestions go into the CCP LOL pile.
---
This. I regularly take frigates and destroyers into lowsec knowing I'll lose them eventually. Over the weekend I got a Stabber Fleet issue and an Endurence in my Thrasher before losing it to an Astero. 
---
In all honesty outside of FW lowsec is pretty fucking dead, hell even a lot of the FW systems are super dead. I spend far more time hunting than I do fighting. I might go 10 systems and see 3 people in local but they'll all be afk and docked up then I find a system where the 1 guy in local is ratting or mining cuz he feels safe being alone but docks up the second you enter system. So I wait. I sit and wait, and wait, and wait. Eventually he undocks, might even try talking to me in local and I gotta convince him I'm not a threat even though my name is flashy red in local. Convince him I'm ratting cuz I'm low on isk for pvp and this system is normally dead so i feel safe there. When he let's his guard down I attack. Scoring my kill and then I move on. 
---
My advice had to FW and when someone kills you ask them for advice. A lot of the older pvp guys are not only willing to teach you a thing or two but a lot will even send you isk for more ships.
---
Now you know what drowning in information feels like, welcome to Eve new bee.
---
Thanks for the resource!
---
my friend, one of the biggest things with eve different from all other games, (other than most FPSooter games) is death or loosing a ship is and shouldnt be a big issue, with each death you need to ensure you learn somthing, that is how you get true value, NEVER fly what you dont mind loosing is a common rule. at least until you get good understanding of the possible ways yo can die and to what and in what :D 
---
ive been playing 4years and im still learning things, granted i dont die without me putting myself in a pvp situation purposely but i definatly still die in ships. but when or if i move my belongings i do so in such a way to reduce risk or loss chance.
---
eve is evil and harsh, learn to love the harshness, and laugh at how crazy hard it is :D
---
This is surprisingly correct. Sometimes we point stuff and just wait for the defense fleet to show up. 
---
This can lead to three things:
---
* Goons drop a smartbombing Titanfleet that we deseperatly try to run from before we get fried
---
* Goons show up with a fleet and we get to fight. Sometimes win, sometimes die
---
* Goons show up in a kitchen sink that have to mercy kill for their own sake. 
---
All in all, Delve holes are never dull. &lt;3 Goons

We catch people when they come out of warp specifically to prevent them from escaping.  Typically if we're hunting something large with a jump drive the plan is to have a sabre bubble already waiting for them before they arrive at their next site, with sub caps its simple as just waiting for people to start new sites.
---
&gt;Can you imagine goonie and NC  .......

No i cannot imagine NC doing this.

Clubbing seals isnt what we are smug about. Having the ability as a relativly small group to do it 24/7 day after day while having an amazing culture is something we to beat our chest over. 
---
So many eve players out there are stuck in corps where they are ”the only one active”. To you I say, change corp. Get into an active corp. May not even be Waffles. Take the step before you ragequit over something. 
---
Waffles vs PL in a fight? We have totally different styles in what we do. Sadly there wont be any AT matches either, that would have been interesting.
---
Isnt syncing a multi box also a bannable offense? As I understand it you have to control each account separately. So that excuse doesnt really work.
---
Imagine how much more public exposure of the kill right there would be if it was a price on there head. Much more so than having to pay to get the kill right.
---
With how it's set up currently it seems more like just a scamming tool than anything.
---
It was always going to become like that, CCP just accelerated it with injectors and rorquals. But even without that, NCPL and goon supercapital fleet was already large enough to cause this effect, it's just that people weren't turtling by then.
---
Player count did change if you look the average on two months, small drone in june, small rise then drop. Don't forget we are on a holiday period, which should mean increase in player login in.
---
Its actually possible but I thought those were bannable as well. You can set up multi box software to replicate actions on one set to all other sets of characters. So joining fleet, activating modules can be done all at the same time but I'm fairly certain this is against ToS.
---
I actually do, too.
---
Probably should.
---
Don't know why you're directing this to Falcon, he's PR not a part of any team that makes changes.
---
to be fair, i am at a stage of the game i can play it if i want, or i can play it on ping warrior-ing.

where my alliance messages me when theres a fight going on, i log in, fight, die, log off :D works for me.

---
This. Static can stay "closed" for an extended period of time as long as you don't warp to the sig. As soon as an incoming wormhole opens, you have to consider your static to be unsafe and close it again.
---
And yes, you can get incoming wormholes, but that's not really far from the issue you have in nullsec with the same incoming wormholes, without the cyno part. But sure, when you get tackled in a hero dread you're probably dead.
---
But you sell your kill right, because by letting some1 else kill your target, you're giving up the chance to doing it yourself.
---
sure more trading players :D
---
How so? Point out what’s so bad about it, and then let Everyone else decide. Haha
---
My PC daemon is rattling
---
Honestly I think caps need a complete rework.
---
Delete capital injectors to make fax susceptible to cap warfare, reduce rep significantly, closer to old triage, and scale it based on sig so they're not great on anything smaller than battleships. Fax are the single biggest problem in capital and even sub capital fights. 1 fax can essentially make a 40 man gang irrelevant unless they're using Triglavian ships and this is imo why medium-scale roaming in anything bigger than Kikis is just dead.
---
Prevent supers from using any anti-subcap/space superiority fighters. Their role needs to be scoped better and I'd make them revolve around high anticap DPS (which will be more powerful without broken fax reps meaning you have to volley everything) and their burst projectors.
---
Delete HAWs. Dreads' role should be purely anti cap/anti structure, this scopes carriers back into the anti-subcap/anti-fighter role.
---
Remove the boson. The lance is more skill intensive and less oppressive to gangs especially with booshers and MJDs.
---
Finally I'd cut the EHP on supers/titans by about 33% across the board.
---
Essentially this would mean the only caps which are useful against subcaps would be carriers and new post-nerf faxes, which are reasonably manageable even for smaller groups. It would also fit caps into the 1 up/1 down metagame.
---
eve has never been a pay to win game, theres no 'pay real money for this ship to get it only' you can get anything with normal ingame money,
---
the bigger the ship the more useless it is against ships 2 or 3 tiers below it, and cruisers, (middle tier ship, say, tier 3 size ship are good vs pretty much everything, and are used to fight everything and can be gotten into for not alot of isk (in game money)
---
All this tells me is that you don't have the right attitude to understand how your decision making leads to losing ships. You're doomed to eternal badness if you think your losses are just "absurd" and outside your control.
---
trust me, the amount they update and change this game will shock you, the money on sub is money VERY well spent, this game has changed completly in so many aspects like 6 times in my time playing, all with smaller slight changes inbetween. i run 3 monthly subs, and never feel like i pay and am unhappy about it, at times it can feel pretty rough, but come the end its kinda worth it.
---
Nope, Lake Jocahasee in South Carolina, USA
---
A rental lol
---
Lets be honest.       
---
I am not sure if NC is capable to fight PH now, even with PL helping NC with this.
---
You can actually die pretty easily on a super, but it requires some luck on the attacker part (enter and warp to anom during a long warp time of the super itself), blue intel/scout/tackle or simply someone not paying perfect attention (super ratting is intensive as is).
---
As for blue intel, if you're in a super ratting alliance, you ABSOLUTELY have a lot of spies that can do it for you. You cannot count on spy purge and security measures to prevent someone wanting to awox you, so you have to consider that a risk.
---
Also, giving higher bounties is not the way to go, printing ISK was never meant to be that easy. Change it to blue loot, overseers effect or anything else that is either sought by players or bought by NPCs.
---
Hey, I’m also super new! Newer than you being that I didn’t play years ago, started about a month ago. 
---
That said, my Corp taught me wormhole exploration and since then that’s been my go to favorite way to pass time and make money. It’s a lot more fun for me than the large scale fleet stuff, and it’s actually given me a sense of direction and goals. 
---
Anyway, I could always use a partner to rat for me if you’re interested in coming out!
---
Well if you are of any use to the parent alliance, sure.
---
If you a basic renter, you can die in a fire and they will use it to cook marshmallows.
---
you can buy 'gear' with in game money that anyone can earn in game (its not hard) but you can spend IRL money to get in game money without needing to farm it. all that does is save time, not give you an advantage.
---
i promise if you spend any unlimited amount of money on a ship, i will be able to beat you in that ship in a ship that took me 1 hour to earn in game. purely because i know how to fly the ship, and you dont know how to fly the ship, whatever ship you chose well enough to live. :) its more about counters, you buy titan, i buy counter, you buy that, ill bring my friends and we will destroy that ship like it was nothing. you get friends and fly those ships we used, and ill bring more friends and kill those ships..... welcome to eve online,

130gb uncompressed, and that's still missing 20m plus kilmails

So true
---
With all the cencorship coming in 2020 yea  it will break down a lot more
---
Maybe they changed it since I used to do it. My Vexor would get down to about half armor and then I'd warp off. I wasn't even heavily armor skilled as I was a shield tank guy. And no..no longer have the fit. Never got blown up so couldn't even dig up the killmail for it.

Mate,  I was the same as you. I did exploring, not very good, for all that you do in it you dont get the reward. I did mining and liked it. got lots of materials and went into production. Not too bad, made more isk than exploring and i still do it on and off when i have other things to do outside the game. AFK mining earns you isk when watching netflix or youtube.  But the best thing i do is go into the Abysal Deadspace. It's so much fun. the level 1 and 2 are ok, quite easy, but when you get to level 3 and 4 the risk is much harder. I spent 300m on a ship (cant remember which one) and spent a good amount of time completing up to level 3 areas. then died. So i bought another for 300m and went straight into a level 3 and lost it on the first run.....but the rewards are much higher. I earn at least 200m a night gathering gear in them.  Also when you go into level 3 and higher there is a chance to go through a special PvP gate and your pitted against another guy for a big fat can of goodies.

Heavy missiles had their application blown to shit, so they don’t work nearly as well as they used to. When I ratted in a drake my missiles could actually chunk off the frigate rays, they can’t do that anymore. Arty hurricanes have always had bad tracking, I ran those because they were fun, not because it was efficient.

One of the reasons the VNI was so broken was that you could use heavy drones against anything, the tracking bonus is that good.

New pvp allainces have taken the home systems of Northern Coalition allies.
---
My advice is to focus on your navigation skills and skill properly into the rupture. Most new players make the mistake of skilling the minimum to get into their next ship whereas a well skilled rupture will be perfectly fine for the missions you are doing. Good luck in your eve life!
---
I think it might also be because back in the days all the players had kind of the same availability tbh. Everyone could spend the evening in eve 4-5 days a week + the whole weekend if needed without absolutely any regret. The players were early 20s, predominately male, educated (or at least able to learn) etc.   
---
Because of business decisions and overall state of the mmo market things have changed: the playerbase got older, couldn't push the time, the game tried to get more casual (which it succeeded in a way) and get some of that sweet mmo player pie that wow held 15m of.   
---
Turns out that without changing the core mechanics, your game will go the way of the "alarm clock" web games like utopia and shit - where the people willing to play them got old enough that can't afford them and the new players don't get them (because there's new products out there tailored for them now).   
---
I guess we're seeing some effort in the direction of at least changing some things but my experience with mmos tells me that when the developers start listening to the playerbase's wishes all of a sudden, it's because they're out of ideas and the thing will start going down. Hopefully eve will prove me wrong but I'm not getting my hopes too high.
---
It's literally 230 lines of code.

This. Even if EVE were to fail, the void it left would not be filled by any other project. Like it or not, EVE is a massive and unprecedented success. Yes, its success is eclipsed by the many failures caused by the fact that it's built by mere humans, however reproducing that success and even improving upon it would be very hard indeed.
---
Yes, I play EVE on both windows and linux.
---
People are salty because the game got hard and they were used to AFK ratting. I hope the null blackout is permanent.

If you were undocking in Caldari space is it possible you got the "this station owner doesn't like you" dialogue?

Thanks for your points. The age itself can work as a variable (aside from being 18+) - asking the DOB is very common. Regarding the US units and as an Italian in US, I completely understand but we had to pick a reference (also for analysis). Moreover, in other studies I did participants left measurements with the units they know, and I work from there. But you are right, it is not a perfect solution...thanks for sharing!

How is the hulls this cheap now? Abundance of ore? Supply much larger than demand.

I picked one up for 900m unfitted, can't fly it thou.

I mean the Rorq changes seemed to be the thing that pushed it over the edge because before that I very rarely saw super ratting. Carrier ratting and dreads in WHs sure, but carriers/dreads are much more engageable than supers.

Oh please. PVP against a PVE/mining fit using groups of stripped down destroyers is not risk. You're delusional if you think that's risky.
---
Sure. If you want to null sec PvP in a fleet. But that's hard to do in a high sec corp. Most new players need to learn how to handle themselves and understand the game before you throw them in some ewar frig. They need a cushion of isk as well. Trust me... I've managed corps and newbies are better off solo for a while.

Generally (especially for frigates) there are three ranges to fight: 18km+ (kiting), around 9 km  (scram/kiting) and less than 2km (brawling). The ranges I provide are approximate but give you an idea of the differences. Larger ships will have different distances.
---
The best range for a ship is dictated by the ship's hull bonuses, fitting and ammo.
---
If a kite ship is able to keep range on a brawler, the brawler won't be able to apply dps but the kite will. The opposite is also true. The scram kite ship fills the middle ground.

Have you let anyone in PH know?
---
You got that in reverse, mate. Yulai screwed over Provi during the PanFam invasion of 2018. They decided to leave - which is fine on its own - but before they did they sold all their large structures to PL, many of which were still being used by Provi as northern staging areas at the time.
---
I personally had to quickly replace a couple of combat ships due to mine being stuck in asset safety thanks to this.
---
The Drone regions are quite dense and you can pack a shit ton of systems under 6ly and 7ly umbrellas. Panfam and WinterCo are packing in together to make their assets more mutually defensible.
---
the fuck is that fit
---
Not when you changed them all :)
---
Uhh sir this is a spaceship game subreddit
---
That is one expensive ship to use for trig invasions.
---
How's it handling the myrm meta?
---
I went out and did things.
---
The end.
---
As everyone is saying, heavy missiles are siege missiles for battle cruiser a and up targets. Personally, I would use heavy assault missiles, but those can also be a bit skill dependant as their range is subpar and their application is  only a little better then heavies.
---
Other ships still work though. Nagas replaced drakes in Fountain/Dek when the application nerf hit. It isn't like everything other than VNIs were suddenly useless. Low EHP drone boats are popular because they are low effort and low cost. With local it was easy and near zero risk if you didn't rat with an AFK cloaky in system. No other ships provide that security or that ease of ratting. There was zero reason to fly anything else that required active attention. Now local is gone and people suddenly have to be attentive to the game when they rat again. Apparently that is too much for people to handle. They are given a choice. Low EHP ships that drop drones and do all of the work for you but will get nuked before help can arrive or higher ehp ships that require you to actually play but can survive a smallish gang attacking you long enough for a cyno to go up and the HD fleet to bridge in.
---
A real explanation, thanks!

When I was working on lateshift, I did the updates after downtime at home wifi, then at work I played and it used 50-100 mb within 8-10 hours.
---
yaaaaaas fuck them
---
The best part of this is its goons entosising the old sov in vale and tribute saw a few goon iMicus on the nodes throughout the last week or so....
---
Goons have been bored so they've been throwing more and more Hels into our backyard.  Two of them succesfully dropped on a ratting Hel in Paragon Soul a few days ago.  We anchored bubbles on their regional out gate and every time some token force came by to clear them, we'd re-anchor more.  They had to bring a 100+ Harpy fleet while we had a strat op going on in order to finally jail break the Hels that were stuck in our backyard.
---
I'm not sure I believe that a bot can probe down relic sites. But who knows.
---
Where do Guristas skins come from? Is there a limited amount in existence or can you get them via loyalty points or something?
---
Never tried to scale it. Some off days just roaming around a bit and playing the minigame. But I can imagine it being stressful if one does it fulltime.
---
This really doesn't sound like a bad thing to me.  Little alliances shooting at each other in space?  That makes me think of my days back in 2007.
---
Im just kidding. Its a good idea, I like more info. Rather have it and ignore than to not have it at all.
---
Your comments on supply lines and force projection are spot on! It really ruined a lot of great content..
---
Okay cool, I wasn't wrong in my thinking.  lol thanks.
---
What country?
---
One thing I've always played for was laughs and tears.  Tears normally generated laughs, it was fun.
---
And how often does that happen? Isnt it like people dont get evicted unless you are total d-bags? 
---
Flying around in nano ships, doing hit and runs and then running back to your hole.... And the thing is, remove mass restrictions and all the other shit you have and let NS come and pay you a visit. You would have lost your shits over it, basically WHs would be a dead man zone.
---
Docking request denied.
---
So is Goon really the cause of this big move?  From what I read, it didn't really seem like that much happened.  Not doubting it, but just curious if this really is the cause.
---
Oh I would love that. But ye prob never. Dont think well be seeing any relevant numbers outside of the public ones from CCP to be honest. So many things Ive got questions about.
---
downvote cause humble brag, upvote cause solo torp battleship chad...
---
remember you have much better skills than him and are probably applying to an MWDing shitter in a painted and grappled frig while he's hitting rats
---
I do like seeing the new blood moving around and doing things.
---
India. Pornhub, xvideos etc all are gone. There are a few less prevelant sites that are still there though.
---
Ill steal your ship first Kendarr!
---
This happens to me Everytime I forget something after undocking, redock and grab it, and undock before the screen finishes brightening up. I've since started waiting for the session to fully change before undocking. I also almost lost a ship due to this.
---
remove d-scan ;)
---
#PandaFam is a thing
---
who?
---
I thought Provi wasnt really helping them defend their areas very much.
---
It’s not a bad thing at all, it’s great! Reading this sub however you’d be led to thinking blackout has killed any alliance not under a Super capital umbrella.
---
Woah, very hurtful. I'll have you know we pride ourselves on our Christmas themed killboard.
---
I'm saying it probably wont be worth it.
---
I'd be perfectly happy with you just deleting super capitals and reimbursing people the SP and a bit of isk and given your approach on the blackout I'm sure you guys aren't that averse to pissing off big chunks of the player base who are used to their toys but that's an extreme.   
---
The more sensible approach is pretty much along the lines of what u/TwilightWinterEVE said below, the only changes I'd make there are Faxes straight up should not be able to rep sub caps at all, it's infuriating coming across a relatively equal force and having a good fight out of it and then suddenly cyno up fax hops in and they're invincible and the funs over.  
---
HAW guns are awful for a similar reason, things which could turn out to be solid sub cap brawls basically end when the other group drop in a handful of HAW dreads to pick your subcaps apart and then drop a couple of active faxes that make it incredibly hard to break the other sides tanks no matter how smart you are playing without just warping off.  
---
AOE Doomsdays are shit, I mean as someone who has definitely abused them, bosoning wormholes and gates, it's just a massive cock block to content, although a BFG can be used as a perfectly valid defense against a poorly placed dread bomb on a titan, so maybe on this front make it so that its based on sig so that it barely tickles subcaps and still works well on dreads, or make it so it simply doesn't work against subcaps.  
---
I agree with Twilight on the Rorq should be an on-grid booster, it should keep panic though and it should also keep the rorqual alive so that subcap responses have time  to actually respond this paired with some sort of change to caps should be more viable.  
---
I don't particularly agree with the cutting EHP on the supercapitals either, if they are to be a thing in the first place and their only real application would be towards other capitals there's no need to make it any easier to delete them, as they still are expensive and are large investments to the individual pilot, it's not particularly fair or balanced if you make them easier to nuke with subcaps especially if they lose their ability to engage subcaps, I'd suggest rolling back on the insurance payout cut at least on dreads to encourage bigger dread bombs on stuff like titans and supers.  
---
I still disagree on the keeping blackout part, it was as much a "tool" to trick people into forming or whatever as it was to be "perfect" intel and has gotten more people to turtle up than before meaning less diversity in targets and content than before. Fixing capital responses to subcap fleets balance should work to fix most of the issues  people think the blackout is solving and also makes the krabber and the casual/semi-casual player feel like taking part which means more people to interact with the blackout definitely reads and feels like a buff to ganking with no intention of fighting.
---
Nice post olmeca. Reading ops imperium article I couldn’t help feel this is just not my experience of the game. I am not sure why they still play if they hate it so much. Find that new game and take your friends with you o7
---
All my losses are dirt cheap. And I don't loose very often. I understand what you saying.  Just like your critical taught. I have my own. I'm the guy who goes head first in to any situation. I thrive on the caos. Makes a interesting play when you come out on top. 
---
Well it's how I play, if you are gonna critically evaluate every situation. And to play risk adversely id just stick to joining fleet pings. And be a f1 monkey. But even if I'm on fleets I'd be playing logi or scout. I quite often run gate campes. Double back and pick them off well knowing if I make 1 mistake I'm dead. That's the fun part about considering your ship as ammo. 
---
I bait, take baits.  Eat shit or even some times feed. It's all part of the fun.
---
Well your losses teaches you. And I always try not to make the same mistake twice. But we are human after all.
---
Thanks!
---
Although I don't see any common methods used to activate the omega status in transactions - neither credit card nor plex. Also there is no login activity (or is it data for control panel only?)
---
No, but reading the OP it sounds like PH already know and are purging the Corp from their coalition.
---
I tried to bomb some excavators the other day in delve and the rorqual pilot recalled them before my bombs landed. If he had been afk he’d have lost a bunch but he was at his keyboard waiting in case nullsec danger was lurking. I then happened to bomb myself so I had to reship
---
About time these came back.
---
It’s all he posts. Best just accept there are two kinds of people on these forums
---
Just for anybody who is actually taking this nonsense seriously: it's not real. Provibloc will remain NRDS, or die trying. That part is not, nor will it ever be, optional for us, regardless of what CCP elects to do with the game mechanics.
---
As for groups merging into CVA. I can't speak for everybody, but APOC sure has no intention of doing that. It quite literally hasn't even been discussed. - And I'd bet just about anything that at least -7- and CHISP wouldn't consider that an option either. 
---
I'm not sure if this dude is actually a COGG leader, or if he's just trolling, but I strongly suspect he's the latter. If not, then I see a some harsh discussion/demotions in his future.
---
Wow very interesting, hadn't heard anything about it!
---
Eh, it can help in a niche circumstance. When I played I'd usually have the destination station set as my autopilot destination on caps I was jumping.  Saved me from some trouble when my UI glitched after jumping a Rorqual where I was stuck in a jump tunnel except not (I could see it happily sitting next to my cyno), and a few reds decided to jump in to system at that exact time.  Just hit ctrl+s and suddenly I'm docked.
---
I love causing shit around the TCAG gate, but not supers. To each their own I guess.
---
Do you have no respect for the dead?
---
this is absurd
---
nobody in hull pen can afford a super
---
I agree mistakes were made, especially with upwell stations.
---
You forgot cynabals. Also why not fight them yourself
---
&gt;i kept my **loki** skills at 4. since i tend to **loose them pretty often** to absurd situations. so does **legions**.
---
&gt;All my losses are dirt cheap. And I don't loose very often.
---
Yeah... I don't think we're going to have a good discussion if you're not even on the same page *with yourself*
---
Ctrl + F9 as many has said. I usually bind it to the "§" key (which on a Swedish keyboard is left of the "1"), so that I can instantaneously toggle the HUD on or off, for those sweet sweet moments when you just want to admire to incredible beauty of Eve in the moment.
---
Nah just have stront timers.
---
No one is talking about it because they're busy playing the fucking game.
---
So simple but yet a very nice shot. Have my upvote!
---
Its hard to recommend any single corp, because the big, well known ones are so big that I don't think you'll really get a lot out of them.
---
I would recommend looking for a corp the old fashioned way, by joining the recruitment channel. Make yourself known, you'll get a bunch of people making offers, chat to them, see what their plans our for the short and medium term, see what they can offer you in training or fleets (anyone can offer free ships and mods, but you'll be better of with people who can show you the ropes in a hands on way). Make a decision and if you're not happy, talk to the CEO about it, and if nothing improves, move on to another.
---
You won't find what you want immediately (or you might) but after a few tries you'll find a bunch of people you;re happy just to hang out with, who can help you do what you want to do, and that you can feel home in.
---
I like that idea too would fix all the problems
---
TIL the numbers proceeding the "r" are a reference to actual fractional appearance of said moon across space
---
D-Scan should have pretty much the same options as the overview, I think. Tabs, sorting, moving (and remove/add) collumns. Even a option to, I don't know, "integrate" it in the overview for those who want that. More options is almost never bad, as long as their well done (which in CCPs case could be a hit or miss I guess).
---
Ots like you have never played any other games before you sad soul. Time for you to spread your wings. Eve has made you stupid.
---
Stront allows a small group to timezone tank by being smart and diligent. You shouldn't be able to be small and lazy and still have all your shit live through timezone tanking.
---
Those corpses seem like easy money
---
Argh I cringe at those who play this game in that way. I’ve sent you your 25m back. Don’t send people isk in the future who promise to double it. Actually just don’t send people isk
---
Why using a wolf if you can use a retri?
---
I tried it as well after the sutonia video or another newer one with a arty wolf.
---
The speed is way more then a retri but dps and more important aplication is not that well at al.
---
But fun to fly. Try to fit it for kitey arty
---
Keep smoking whatever you are smoking, it's working for you little buddy.
---
I share a lot of your sentiments, but we're not going to outright just delete classes of ships from the game (as much as I'd probably like it personally haha).
---
(Interesting read though, thanks for the context :) )
---
Hey friend, my comment is meant to be facetious.  What's your excuse for sounding like a retard?
---
We deployed to fight/kill NC structures. They evacc'd to lowsec, then a bunch of groups targeted Delve for idiots krabbing while we were deployed killing structures.
---
Thank you and fly safe kind sir!
---
That's very much untrue. The entire coalition spent most of it's time in the first few weeks of the war defending -7- and Yulai areas up north, as that was the part of the region PL's initial attack focused on.
---
Of course we were severely out-gunned by PL, so we were never going to *win* the war or hold the sov. However on the whole I'd wager we spent more time/effort/capital defending Yulai and -7- assets up in that area than we did almost anything else during the war.
---
now let's just hope they will krab more than goons and beat them in a few years ./crossfinger
---
It depends! That's why the answer to your original question is "all of them, Katie!"
---
The Merlin is the slowest T1 frigate but it does beastly damage with neutron blasters, so a "proper position" for *it* is "where it can apply scram and web right away, to hold the target down until it's dead." 
---
The Executioner, OTOH, is fast and has paper tank, so a "proper position" for *it* is "far enough away that it can avoid being scrammed and webbed and evade most damage from the target while it plinks away with its lower-damage weapons and holds long point until the target is dead."
---
Inb4 Hull pen move somewhere else to continue being irrelevant.
---
Yeah but "my client blacked out on undock but my route is still there, better hit autopilot" is probably not that situation
---
Some reasonable suggestions in there for sure :)
---
Who?
---
Tl:dr- took someone's cit and stuff
---
I was hoping down a random chain and I tried warping to a raitaru to see if the inhabitants were online, but it wouldn't let me warp. I combat probed the thing to find out it had been unanchored and had some of its contents scattered around the grid. All connections were EOL except the one I came through, and with a neighboring C2 under siege, I quickly took my way back to grab a hauler.
---
The distance wasn't too bad, only 11j to amarr. Made it back in good time, but I didn't pay attention to the chain and the 2nd  to last jump in the chain was a frig hole. Crazy. Wreathe wouldn't work and even my small porp couldn't hold the cit. Time for a new plan.
---
I ditched the wreathe and warped my pod back to amarr, grabbed my cov ops again and waited out the LS static to roll. 30min later I had an opening. Checked on the neighboring C2 and sabres and T3Cs were still on dscan, but not my connection. Still filIed with energy to pull it off, I hopped into the LS and back to Amarr.
---
I grabbed a T1 hauler and fitted for enough cargo for the rait and then inert stabbed the rest. Made it back and grabbed the rait, deposited it in LS, and went to look what else I could cram into the hauler. I grabbed half of their cap parts, only about 300 mil that they had, and left the hauler in LS. I came back to grab the praxis, and found it fitted with 500mil with of modules. When all was said and done, I had about a new cit and about 900mil loot. Not the biggest theft, but for my first citadel find I was pumped.

TCAG-3/G-M4GK is a fun place.  Had a nice throwdown in my Brutix vs 5 Corms and a Sabre the other day.

This is older pasta, but it checks out.
---
They started switching around the drifter invasion thing from what I saw. Fking riddled with them, like I all of the sudden started seeing atleast a 10-fold increase in traffic. Now, theres no telling, I suspect that number is even higher.
---
Yeah, I'm trying to get back into playing,  just IRL time isn't a good amount.  I miss the game, but being able to focus on it is rough.
---
That would be a lot more likely if they did this 2 years earlier

Yeah it's broken

I think with all the new bro alliances, people aren't learning to be self reliant and figure these things out. If Horde for example were to disband a lot of the pilots would be lost and would probably quit. Convenience is great but it's making people soft. I just remember people used to like Eve because it was hard and were proud of it. We would brag to our friends about the crazy things we had to do to survive.

Next time please use the metric system and not some freedom units, thanks
---
Rupture is great ship to start with. Make sure to try autocannons and arti, both.
---
Thanks for the suggestion ;)
---
My solution: each group sets their preferred TZ. When a timer is generated, game RNG's it to see which groups TZ is used. 50/50 chance you get a fight in your own TZ.
---
Is it crap? Yes. 
---
Is it more crap than the current solution? Sadly no.
---
&gt; so congrats mate everything you said is 
---
Correct - FTFY
---
&gt; your previous comments about how hard it is to detect cloakies and risk/reward for subcaps crabing along with your dismissing the idea that a NS corp should actually work together to combat this new threat really come across as someone that misses the teat of perfect intell that allowed for afk ratting, mining and bots. and your most recent comment comes off as even more butthurt. 
---
No where did I dismiss a corp working together, stop conflating.  I also am not talking about afk ratting, mining and bots but rather doing these things actively ( except bots), so again, stop conflating.  As for your last sentence: Sure bud.
---
&gt; do you really think the most wealth rich part of the game should be open to people/corps that can't even defend them selfs against minor threats?  
---
When the minor threat is caused by bad game mechanics and is also not a minor threat by killing off activites that allow you to fund pvp or living there at all and is actually a major threat due to bad game mechanics then that's not butthurt so much as a logical argument...
---
&gt; with plex prices dropping new players won't find it so hard to plex their accounts breathing new life into the game. 
---
This wont be happening for long I suspect with the sales ending and the summer eventually ending, but this is also a whole different aspect and doesnt really have anything to do with this conversation.
---
&gt; and ive already run into a few smaller corps that know how to flush cloaky hunters out of their space. 
---
Lol sure.
---
&gt; altho as your reddit username isn't your in game name who the fuck knows if you even have mates. 
---
Lol, K.
---
Sooo you're still wrong really.
---
Dont need 2. Still better isk than the alternative. But with rig and t2 relic analyzer its not that hard.
---
Tank a ratting goon/tapi supercarrier
---
&gt; loose them pretty often to absurd situations.
---
really read through. 
---
lemme put is this way. 
---
1 / 2 times i loose a t3c. i loose it to stupid. 
---
and i loose like 1 / 15 - 20 engagements. not all of them are t3c's. 
---
and t3cs are not the only thing i fly. im not the pro pvper who waits for his afk ratting kill for hours and walks away with zero risks. or the guy in cancer ships. i love to dick around people who are like that. more often than not i win. 
---
so if you are gonna judge me. by all means. 
---
honeslty. the level V skill matters most when you are doing 1 thing very fast. and imo the 250K sp loss is stupid. it does servers a purpose ( more like did ). but with injectors online. eh!. and adding a 1bill extra to my loss mail is form my point of view is a waste.
---
Interesting, from them I heard that they left because of the lack of help.  But that's just what hearsay I had gotten out of it.
---
On it chief. i searched "wh space" on reddit, and recommended the first 10 things I found to CCP. we flipped coins to decide which ones are going on. September patch should be juicy.
---
You can certainly do L4 missions if you prefer!
---
Dont worry, uve got time. Next banwave isnt due for months.
---
Your best combo for PvE in WH is 1 Pve ship (gila for C2 and any gas, rattle for C3) and 1 scoot.  
---
Scan every hole, check inside, put your scoot in the more dangerous (ppl in citadel for exemple).  
---
watch out for new sig
---
Next level meme fit. You wouldn't understand it
---
He even has an NSA..
---
I don't think that's very fair to the defender. Stront or two timer windows a week is a more balance approach
---
WHAT DID YOU DO?
---
The term 'glassed' existed before Halo.
---
I miss old Aura. She was cold and disinterested but at least I knew where I stood. I don't trust the new one at all. Bitch I know you don't like me you can drop the faux courtesy
---
The only tears i saw where goons crying why we dont charge on their 1k titans
---
It really wouldn't, in current meta numbers &gt; everything since everyone can get a titan.
---
I think the biggest thing is if people PvE in lighter, cheaper ships they wont care as much about losing them and the game will go back to "can our patrol catch and wipe out the hostiles and inflict more damage on them than they do on us?" instead of "deny content at all costs" and that would be good for everyone.
---
It also encourages local roaming patrols chasing things they see on Intel like we have in Providence which creates more content for local sov-based PvP focused players as well as for intruders.
---
Lastly PvE being rewarding in subcaps, and especially in groups of subcaps, will encourage new player retention because they dont have to spend $300 on skill injectors to get into a Rorqual in order to be useful and make some ISK, and because they're more likely to get on comms and get active in Intel instead of solo ratting/mining, which integrates them into their Corp and Eve community.
---
You were lucky I was online to get the killing blow on him. Otherwise he might not have died:p
---
To the Hel pilot (if you are here), what was happening? Give us your view. Why the fleet fit?
---
Bringing back strong timers would be sweet
---
Make Stront Great Again!
---
yea I figured that might be the case, it just felt very different from when I'm doing any exploration - pucker factor 10, one eye on the overview the other on the minigame, something moving in the list smash that warp button hehehe
---
older?  It was from earlier this year.
---
Look at the old DRF alliances and where most of the (non-renter) corps that stayed in null went. For most it's either Imperium or Legacy.
---
You're part of an entity that built itself on content denial for others and now you're qqing because people aren't giving you the content you want.
---
Good times
---
Once upon a time the advice would have been for you to fit rapid light missile launchers to your Caracal, but those were Too Good for PVP and got nerfed. To the dismay of every newbro running L2-3 missions in missile boats ever since, because *of course* CCP did nothing to change the mission rats even though they basically neutered the most poular newb mission boat by the change.
---
Yea so it's basically ancient.
---
They killed like 3-4 trillion worth of assets if I remember the number correctly.
---
At first glance fairness to the defender sounds like a good idea... until you take into account how many citadels are, essentially, spammed offensively or just as a means of trolling. - In many situations the *defender* of a citadel should really be considered the *attacker.*
---
Perhaps we need to separate this for medium and large/x-large citadels. Medium citadels are what contribute 99.9% of the "citadel spam" in the game, so I'd argue we should have mechanics for those that favor those trying to kill them.
---
To be fair, aim at rorquals mining on spodumain, they have a harder time recalling because the rocks are so huge.
---
Bombing yourself is always funny, tho.
---
The tone is very much not neutral.  I don't know if that's a bad or good thing, but the repetition of questions, and their wording, leaves the researcher bias very clear.
---
I still went through it, but it never actually asked the assumption it has: Have gaming problems ever been an issue in my life?  It just assumes they have been.  Which they haven't, at least in my adult life.
---
It's actually in the lore that ramming isn't a thing in game. IIRC when shields are disabled (not depleted, but straight up turned off which isn't something we can do) it also gets rid of the "bumping field" that all ships and structures in EVE possess. This was used in a lore event back in 2008 when a Gallente Admiral yolo'd a Nyx into a Caldari station where a peace summit was taking place.
---
I love your french accent :\*
---
Lol, thats not what people are saying. People are saying that if you wanna grow you will hit a brick wall rather fast. Who cares about 200 man corps taking space no one wants?
---
Can we not cap points battlefield style? Each time zone can participate. Using math and fucking science we can create a nice algorithm to help with scale vs participation and make this shit last a few days or even scale that with structure type.
---
Optional: Nodes have to be scanned or any other stupid ingame minigame.
---
No, you're misunderstanding.  Every single ship I've killed in highsec had to lock me and fire first. I don't gank in Cats.  I'm just better at PvP.
---
Define risk then - two fleets meet in an arranged fight in nullsec?  Explain your space bushido so I can better understand how I'm violating it.
---
Dual passive gilas work extremely well in c2 (fit them as cheap as they get with t2)   
---
A rattle will devastate a c3 (max damage) but you gotta watch out for people coming in - which means rolling the connections and puckering up. Best I can recommend is running it in something cheap - like rr dominixes or something that you don't mind losing.
---
I'm not investing a DIME until the botting problem is decisively solved!  It likes funny money.  Botting makes everything you do WORTHLESS!
---
That would be a pretty terrible solution considering the attacker can already decide when the first two timers happen (and the second timer disables all services). Especially in highsec, this would just result in the typical dec corps setting their timezone absurd since 4 or so accounts is enough to bash a medium structure. The attacker would have full control half the time, even though the defender is the one that actually paid for a structure and put it in space.
---
I'd say it's definitely a more crap solution than the current situation.
---
I am a gamer myself (see the tone of my pubs - https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Enrico_Gandolfi), and some scales used are prebuilt-created and validated by other researchers. We added further ones with more positive connotations (i.e., the community related ones). I am sorry you had a different impression, my apologies.
---
NC pun didn't go unnoticed.
---
Make no timer at all is better. Put bigger HP, and that we can kill it just in one time in the defender TZ. It would be perfect.
---
Let one timer or 2 for keepstar, and fortizar.
---
During the last two weeks of July to first 2 weeks of August, numbers are shit, because that's when most people are away, you're actually right. We still reached a record twice in one month for the lowest average concurrent numbers of pilots in space in 10 years (July 8 and yesterday).
---
As for Supers, it also has to do with the Fighter rework and the timing. After World War bee, people were kinda in peace, so it was easier to farm and safer to use supers in space with the turtling. Rorquals helped for sure.
---
I'd toggle Shift+C. This makes your camera track stuff you click on like stuff on grid, celestials, structures, and beacons. If you hold down your dscan button and click on an anomaly or a scanned signature you can scan it too
---
WHBOOOOOOOO!
---
sorry I should have been more specific with my wording.  
---
I don't think it is worth living in null for sub caps because I think there are other better options in both high and lowsec that are less risk then null.
---
don't know what you mean about the delve I don't live in delve I am doing just fine but I am not a newer player
---
&gt; I am sorry you had a different impression, my apologies.
---
In the future, I'd leave this one out, especially if you're looking to speak with an adult (and presumably professional) population. 
---
I know when wording implies, "Sorry you're not educated enough to understand".  I wasn't looking for any apology, you didn't offend me until just now.  I was simply pointing out that your study clearly didn't have a neutral tone because it doesn't.  Even to a lay-person like myself.
---
I also don't quite get why it's a problem if the research isn't wholly neutral?  Yeah, it's clearly biased, the structure of the questions will lead anyone to the conclusion of what you're actually asking --- sleep deprivation, social issues, etc -- issues caused by gaming.
---
and here I am trading my nexus chips and LP for ships ;)
---
imo what's needed is more rewarding and engaging subcap PvE, moving away from multiboxing low APM drone ships and more towards abyssal type content and a mining minigame, with boosted payouts to match. Nullsec should be both more risk and more reward than highsec, and right now for non-AFK subcaps it just isnt rewarding.
---
There will still be passive income streams like PI, production, SP farming etc for people who dont want to actively PvE at all, but it should always be less rewarding to play that way.
---
I understand that CCP will naturally be reluctant to move away from multiboxing when its a lot of income, but at the same time it's a huge barrier to entry to tell new players "well really to be effective in ISK making you need a supercarrier or 6 accounts".
---
Pick what you like most.
---
Haha ye I can imagine. Ive done some in WHs and thats def a high pucker factor. But that was more out of curiosity than anything else. Its a cool playstyle in general tho, explo.
---
EVE is a perfectly designed game with complete competitive perfection and no need for future stat or number tweaks as true optimal game design balance has been acheived and the game also has no interactions or mechanics or functions or systems or modules or ships that have any odd quirks or unlikelihoods or silliness
---
And other lies that aren't true

Caldari
---
did someone tell good jokes on comes?
---
Join FW, don't just daytrip in lowsec, *live* there. Come on in, the water's fine!
---
I was not implying something like that at all. Surveys can offend and stress participants (it happens, and it happened to me as a participant) and I was sincerely apologizing.
---
With neutral, I mean that the overall scope is open and not aimed at stressing/forcing specific correlations and cause-effect dynamics.  From a certain point of view, nothing is 100% neutral or objective - there is always the researcher with her/his own background and schemes.
---
Are you implying only citadels, or all structures?
---
Because promoting raitaru's to be more easily destroyed than larger structures, with mechanics favouring the attacker (to the point the defender isn't allowed to actually defend) is a good way to lock out anyone but large established alliances out of industry. The structure spam when it comes to the EC's is even by design so clearly intended by CCP. Consider how many rigs are needed for effective manufacturing (3-4+ different raitaru's for different market categories) and how much people get dicked over for using EC's controlled by someone else.
---
It doesn't really matter, you can cross train for weapons/ships.
---
I reported broken torp spec 2 days ago (EBR-180798), seems like they didn't fix it.

Starry Armada is not being purged; they're a real corp, not an alt farm.  The miner dude is being purged as an individual.  I'm guessing this is the first we've heard of the OSW dude, since he's so far away and the evidence is far less conclusive than the miner broadcasting.

Come spend a couple of days in Providence. :)

Back in the day this decision mattered more, but nowadays it is more cosmetic than anything.  It will impact what you can fly first, but you can train into ships of any race in almost no time (like 15 minute train times).  I picked a color I liked (green) and went Gallente, but you do you
---
IIRC, the module acts as if it is offline during the repair, which would mean the bonuses disappear.
---
You could test this by going into space and looking at your fitting window while repairing that EANM.
---
Either RL cash or make enough ISK to buy 500 plex from the market.
---
It pleases me that people are disabling their UI while flying supers around in EvE.
---
Why?  It's a highly deterministic game even when a human is playing it once you know the rule of 6.  It's a bit more complex than dropping drones, orbiting, and watching local, but it's not hard at all.  That's the problem, it's hard to design a PvE activity that can't be reliably "solved" such that players and bots do the same things.
---
I agree 100%
---
Good fight!
---
It’s almost like a covert cloak now actually makes you covert. Strange.
---
Kinda sounds like they already got fucked up
---
www.blackedout.com
---
Be covert no one has issues with that. But be limited to time so you don't go eat your sandwitch in the kitchenand stay covert in space.
---
You could join a wormhole pvp corp and easily be one of the most important players. The guy who scouts the chain.
---
I'm not the pilot, I'm cloaky watching. I forget the pilot's name but they had some turd-based moniker. I think the ship was called 'Come A Bit Closer' or something along those lines.
---
You probably were doing sites in high sec, last night I spend 2hrs from the moment I login to log out and made over 100mil clearing sites in 1 wh, my best run was 175mil isk a couple of days ago. That's not all I do but it helps me fund other activities :)
---
I guess I should have said I find the entire path from undocking to looting a can to be unrealistic. It requires you to jump gates, scan sites down, get to them and approach the cans, actually do the minigame, determine when you're actually done, then resume scanning more sites. I'm sure it's possible but it sounds like it should be a quite complex program to actually do all of it.
---
How about we just fix cynos? If a fleet of stealth bombers gets into your space,  That’s really up to them. 
---
Just be ready with a response. You are in null security space after all.
---
In that case it's not something either of us can really say is true one way or the other, since being worth it is a different threshold for all of us.
---
Do sites and gas mining in wormhole space.
---
But if I am eating a sandwich in the kitchen cloaked I am not a threat.
---
A cloaked ship can’t harm you
---
From another question: [https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore](https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore) tells you what you can make by mining what.
---
Yield of a venture when mining non-gas is not worthwhile.  You'll need a barge/exhumer for a decent yield.
---
Orca can be a "start it mining and Netflix" ship in highsec.  Yield is low but you're not paying attention to it so it can slowly do it's thing for a long time.
---
Mining boosts aren't usually worth it until you have 3 barges getting those boosts - the boosting pilot would mine more in a barge than the boosts increase yield.
---
And mining isn't exactly thrilling, so I'm not aware of anyone youtube'ing it.
---
Well if I happen to kill these guys, I'll take your money.
---
So then scan the program with whatever anti-virus software you use. Pretty sure with the number of people that have already used the program, we’d know if everyone started getting hacked.
---
If you need someone else to kill your aggressor, wouldn't it make sense for you pay the other person doing the killing because if you can kill your aggressor then why wouldn't you? I know it's nice to get paid for letting someone kill your aggressor but it makes no real sense to work that way. The only reasoning I can think of to keep it as is, is for scamming purposes.
---
Cry me a river with your massive super fleet defenses and cynos. As if you are some helpless victim.
---
Yeah let’s have WH space disappear. Or about about losses too! So it can all be the massive F1 borefest that is big bloc tidie null.
---
mfw a hel hull costs &lt;11B
---
That's because those players don't care about that kind of thing /u/cypeth
---
You really aren't playing this game until you lose it all. Been there, done that, Burned the T-Shirt.
---
I hear PF-346 is a good place to learn pvp
---
No,
---
Quicker ice mining means more fuel, more fuel means more structures.
---
It's almost a perfect system since I bet it hard to give out the roles needed to large groups and managing all those timers would be very difficult. A smaller group wouldn't have much of an issue either.
---
And stront allows for shorter timers and kiting timers and weekend timers
---
You would be severely mistaken.
---
this "Omfg we dont fight because goons blobb on us 4x numbers" was just a ruse to prepair the dronelands.  
---
And i remember that figths with equal numbers didnt go well for goons :P

**Behold, a simple primer on the current state:**
---
PVE players ask for counter play options to invulnerable cloaked ships
---
PVP players say NO JUST ADAPT, also downvoted
---
PVP players ask for carriers, rorquals, citadels and everything else they want to shoot to carry more risk
---
CCP bends knee to PVP players bot posting on reddit
---
PVE players try to ask for some measure of danger or counterplay or middle ground rework for cloaked ships
---
PVP players say NAH JUST STOP BEING SCARED, also downvoted
---
PVP players complain about invulnerable states on rorquals, citadels, ect
---
PVE players ask yet again for something to be done about cloaked ships that cannot in any way be detected or countered during blackout
---
**And the PVP players wonder where all their content went**
---
It's not what you said; it how you said it.
---
boored and did the math can some one double cheek.  
---
0.50 USD = 33sec so... 1 sec is....  
---
0,0151515151515152  
---
lets run it down to 0.015USD/sec  
---
0.015 x 60 = 0.9 USD/Min  
---
0.9 x 60 is 54USD/hour
---
.... wow my copy of AAA at 60USD is worth about 1 hour of dev time.  
---
and just for the heck of it 0.016 X 60 X 60 = 57,6USD/Hour.
---
This would just make null safer than it was before the blackout.
---
All they do is get fucked up.
---
I am relatively new too (on my 2nd month sub). If you train you scanning skills for exploration to 3 and get yourself into a heron with basic exploration stuff (data / relic scanners and a probe launcher) you can go wormhole/ls/ns scanning and make pretty good isk per hour. In an average few hour session, you'll bring in ~100-150 mil with relatively low skills and effort and initial investment. It's a good way to get you ISK to fly/do what you want.
---
I'll make it fun by diving into wormholes and keep going until I find a nullsec exit then make my way back to Dodixie or Jita to sell. One session gets you enough to afford a solid Astero for future runs with plenty leftover.
---
2x RR dominix. Insurance tank them, run C3 sites. Give no fucks. MJD means that if you see a sabre on dscan you can just mjdoodledoo away. Worst-case scenario you get a fun fight because if some wormholer group forms up a fleet with logi just to kill your T1 ratting hulls then they're enormous cowards and you've won, while not losing much.
---
Fit: remote reps and remote cap in the highs (drone link aug is needed for C3 sites as well IIRC, it's been a couple years), target painter (on one, replace this with a drone tracking comp) + MJD + large cap battery + whatever in the mids, plate + T2 eanm + explosive hardener and then DDAs in the lows. Should cost you less than 500mil for the pair of 'em and you can run Fortification Frontier Strongholds in less than 10 minutes as I remember.
---
Disclaimer: you'll probably lose any fight that happens. [Probably](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56917535/).
---
Botters trying to jump ship from gotb now? It's like the space they have been given is no longer safe because of the blackout and their not fit for purpose super umbrella....
---
Cool, maybe some day. I have absolutely zero interest in PvP so I have generally been staying away from wormholes red but I am really enjoying relic hunting.
---
There's actually fun scraps going on!
---
Also thank tschwery for his contribution !
---
I reject your premise. Cloaky campers can't shut down systems the MER proved that when Marshy was in Delve with his asic miners
---
My god, It's enough strong to read it?
---
Can't fix what isn't broken
---
Nice article, and overall inspiring. There is zero emphasis on creativity in the eve of lately.
---
It's better than nothing but I think the timers for each RF should be 1,2, and 3, adjusted to the next primetime after the 24 hours is up. days based on size of the structure. The game lets you pick your primetime so it may take 47 hours for the L to come out of RF. If you can't drum up help by the second timer, you're unlikely to ever be able to do so.
---
For unfueled strux, this means you'd be able to kill a M in 24 hours, give or take.
---
Doesn't matter.  Bots farm ISK and trade for PLEX and that pays for their Omega accounts.  
---
Damn I am mad too because this whole game is Screwed (and has been since the overrunning of bots here) and I figured it out in just 2 days after starting..shit!
---
Yeah, and have this same thing happen to your 2 Bill T2 Cruiser in a lvl 3 abyssal.. Ticket comes back "sorry, no refund". Fuck CCP. Fucking worthless scamming fucks.
---
I like this a lot man. We used to do a corp nomad ratting sting about a year ago - we moved around with like 6 rr nestors and a bunch of asteros/strats + 1/2 pilgrims and were getting along pretty decent on the c5 highway, settling down in c5s and farming for a few days.   
---
good clean fun but you need to be playing regularly and at reasonably high SP and have an alt that can scout you about if you get left behind :)   
---
I would love to get to that again, now you made me nostalgic hehe
---
Awes my playstyle is better than yours.
---
Caldari friend it makes it easier to get to some prime ganking areas with a free school jump clone

well i couldn't help but read "one scoot" with the french accent :)))

I never said or implied that this program is malicious. I was merely pointing out where your scheme to protect against a software that you suspect to be malicious is flawed. But as expected, that was in vain since you jumped right to the next thing instead of either admitting that your idea was not as clever as you thought or arguing why I was wrong.
---
Get into a fleet, you pleb.

thank you!

No. see, he's alt+tabbing in milliseconds, just like all of the Goon/Code. 25-man solo-gankers do. No botting, just playing the game like the other cheaters.. Alt+tab bruh. Get with the times... don't you know. Accuse others of that which you are guilty - Goebbels and Gianturco
---
Here's what you need to pull off the MWD-cloak:
---
    50MN Microwarpdrive II
---
    Improved Cloaking Device II
---
That's it.
---
Anything else is trying to make it a little more forgiving, but with a little practice it's not that hard to do with an active tank in the lows.
---
Plates make it harder, since you will need a little more of a "push" from the MWD.  So if you want to fit more buffer, then you'll either want to accept the risk of being exposed for a tick (decloak early) or the MWD rig.
---
Sorry, step one of installing any software for me is scanning it with my antivirus. You’re right, simply turning off internet and then deleting wouldn’t work if it can install a worm, Trojan, or other forms of viruses. I apologize your ego was hurt for not admitting I was wrong before moving on to the next point.
---

There are modules to help you with this called expanded cargohold. They double the size of your hold which makes you use half the fuel and time to freight your items. As a trader you are often facing a fairly competitive market, in which reducing your overhead costs plays a significant role. If you haul twice as much you can profit twice as much on high volume goods such as compressed ore or moongoo.
---
I think you can say that his dick is bigger than yodik.
---
Yep, seems like you have your arguing etiquette figured out at least as well as your computer security. Carry on :).
---
Amarr if you role play as the ruler. Minmatar if you prefer to be the rusty slave.
---
As long as you keep dscan rolling and cloak up or run if a squad shows up on it, you’ll be fine. I’ve only had one astero attack me with t2 drones and it was to get me out of a site that was half done.
---
From my experience, more of an opportunity to buy a scam. I've rarely seen a legit kill right, though I am still pretty noob in Eve's eyes so take that how you will. The rare ones that I've seen that are legit are usually way overpriced, the one above a diamond in the rough. I just believe that if you want someone to kill your aggressor you should pay them, just makes way more sense that way.
---
Can you imagine the content, and fun, of being a bounty hunter/police with a change to this? Able to be a proper avenger of the innocent, avenger of noobs, and opportunity in turning a nice profit with it? I'd totally throw one of my alts into that.
---
LOL - did he just say people that cannot defend themselves like NC? Haha. That was worth a laugh.
---
&gt; little to no consequence on those who cannot really fight for themselves like Haulers, NC, etc.
---
It's been 0 days since this terrible idea was suggested on r/eve.
---
200 of then can kill anything in a minute and disappear again. Where is the risk to this reward?
---
I know you're just trolling, as usual, but I'll point out the Goons and TEST don't seem to have any problems with mining or pvp.
---
Stay the fuck away from Jita with any character that is vulnerable to HS wardecs. 5 jumps ought to do it, if they are *not* jumps along the route to one of the other hubs (Dodixie/Amarr/Rens/Hek).
---
These guys that killed you spend all their time camping gates along those routes, or hanging out at the undock at the hub stations. Be where they aren't, and they'll be too lazy to come looking for you.
---
It wasn't a Caldari Navy or State Militia station? Weird. That's all I can think of.
---
Structures are so easy to bash, it needs no easier way
---
The guy who ran Cloaky Bastard blog did similar with nestors, seemed like a lot of fun. I don't have the play time to really log in with a roaming group, otherwise I would for sure. It can definitely be fun
---
I considered that something fun :)

yes, I have and gotten to my destination 20 jumps away safely.  Ok to be fair, I used a jump gate the last hop bypassing the 3 gatecamps always in the area of destination.  Using an interceptor with a prop mod for when I was paying attention and wanted to get to the gate faster.  Null just isn that populated in the deep areas in the umbrellas.  Most of the time I didnt, because its just too slow to autopilot, but still. 
---
Also I dont need to autopilot, most of where I need to get to is within 5 jumps.  Huzzah jump networks.
---
What, you want cloaked ships to be able to not be invincible when afk?
---
You MONSTER. how dare you think that’s a good idea.
---
Without a cloak how can people kill subcap pve ships easily?  If not that then how would space be DANGEROUS for all ships.

Where would the danger be without the hunter being invincible and unscannable until they get their dank killmails
---
It just doesn’t make sense :o

Na, dont touch cloaks. They are massively OP atm but they are not broken otherwise. Dont like cloaky camping as its the most afk someone can be in space but Im fairly certain the "elite" will get their panties in a bunch over it and honestly, who has the patience to deal with teenagers.
---
But outside of the blackout cloaks are doing what they are supposed to do and its a fair trade for bombers being squishy.

Tl:dr, dont break things that arent broken to fix a mechanic that is broken, just revert said mechanic and fix other things that actually are broken instead of creating an neverending cycle of breaks and fixes over 1 shitty mechanic.

How is a small active group supposed to fight timers?
---
Im a rebel bro! No ochre. Please dont tell on me!
---
Was going to make a smartass remark. But.
---
Maybe what's missing on my end is Acceleration Control V. Didn't think of that. 
---
I'm pretty sure it's not my timing that's off: I've probably done 1000s of warps with the trick in lighter ships, and what I find with the DST is that it is still a good 4 seconds (of uncloaked acceleration time) short of warp speed when the when the MWD cycle runs out. I don't think it's something I can correct by getting better at the trick. But maybe I've found a use for some unallocated SP.
---
I'm sure these dudes that paid 30 mil for an opportunity to kill a JF felt really scammed by it.
---
10b rigged
---
No, thinking of another way to make a spend area. I would even be fine if they increased the base cycle times to offset the crystals. I really just don't like the idea of active modules not having charges to them.
---
Im not neccisarily against the NSA, but it should be for blapping sabres after your tackled not for initial lock on a capital.
---
Fragging sabres in 1 cycle of NSA and getting away isn't too unlikely of a scenario.

“Eve is dying” has been a meme since for half a decade now. It’s less of a game, and more of a hobby for most players, eve’s not going any where any time soon.
---
Thanks! I do have a pretty decent retriever fit right now, just not had the chance to use it alot in solo play. Will definitely check out the discord and find you ingame.
---
What this game needs is a few more ingame and discord channels
---
I support this - also while we're at it , can we make the dscan automatic? Is our game "press V every other second while undocked" ?
---
🙏
---
Amarr/minmatar if you consider yourself good at video games
---
Gallente/caldari if you consider yourself bad at video games
---
We use them as heavy tackle in our battle cruiser fleets
---
&gt;I think this is exactly the way EVE should be, security scaled properly, and a little bit of fear in your heart if you decide to undock and live in nullsec &gt;:)
---
i'm not scared of black out, it's just now a lot more effort for exactly 0 extra reward - which means it's not worth the hassle.
---

OKAAAAAY DUUUDE

This is really just a long shot post of adapt or die. People are already moving more to the large alliances roqual with miner 2s and augmented still produce 60% of their old yield with a much lower investment 2.5bil versus 10bil. People are moving more into carrier ratting under the super umbrellas. Invasions, incursions, and abyssal dead space can give just as high or higher isk/hr in high sec. That is where it is going. They are not changing structures nor are they adjusting how anomalies work in null so it is more uncontrolled risk for the same or lower rewards. They have not changed what the ingame map shows so if you cannot find content with that you are just bad. I've really just seen more lokis and gate camps since the black out.
---
That’s a really negative approach on what I said. I’ll elaborate so I am more clear. CCP did a GOOD thing nerfing the VNI for ratting. I simply adapted and found an alternative means to making isk. Additionally I mentioned in another comment that I was not the typical afk VNI ratter. My fits had neuts and scrams with zero stabs. I waited for the solo hunters to come during blackout. I kept ratting during blackout till the VNI change came in. There are many targets out there, I am in SniggWaffe (we are recruiting) and we hunt stuff all day. It’s just a matter of how you approach this blackout and adapt to it.
---
Are you turning the cloak off before or after the end of the MWD cycle?  Turning it off after the MWD is off makes you lose a ton of speed.
---
Since I typically am not flying through gatecamps in a DST, I usually fit a plate and have to turn off the cloak about 1-ish seconds before the MWD cycle is done because of the plate's mass.  I'm a little more exposed, but I prefer the extra buffer when I don't have to GTFO as fast as possible.
---
Shit like this here is what made me want to play Eve in the first place. Y’all are savage.
---
i live in low sec and this is how another region should be so its easier for me to kill noobs in ratting ships. teeeeheee
---
Wormholes are the Area-51 of Eve. 
---
We all know they are there. We have even seen them.

Admitting to cheating doesn’t work like that lmfao. I can type “I sell plex for isk” in standing and it doesn’t mean I’ll be banned.

---
Why are you always so salty, has the asteroid depleted or something?
---
The NSA could give you the advantage to clear off tackle, but you are still locking yourself for a minute, that's a lot of time for new tackle to arrive.
---
I get where you are coming from, but I would definitely change some of that tank for maybe two sensor boosters
---
It’s not really all that different from ratting. Instead of clicking on red icons, they’re clicking on circles in a mini game. Instead of killing, idk, frigates first, they’re clicking ones by the rule of sixes.
---
Can use ESI data to get the bots to avoid systems where killings have recently occurred. Many people have written route finder programs (dotlan, gatechecker, etc) so it’s not that hard for a bot to determine its own path.
---
Can just check if there are sigs in system, if not can jump to next one.
---
I don’t know anything about programming bots, but it seems totally possible.
---
Can I create a tab just for hostiles, allies, wrecks, containers, and mission objects?
---
I like the blackout but the only ones who go to high are the bots
---
As an Australian time zone player who is off work Monday Tuesdays this is a bullshit idea. People have accused us of tz tanking many times but truth is our timers are in prime time on prime day for our fcs to draw numbers lol. So if your saying stop timers from being xyzabc because it annoys you your also hurting those who are usually smaller groups, and active in that time.
---
I wouldn’t upvote if not for the unbelievable amount of hatred people have for the very targets they love to hunt on reddit.
---
So, killrights are useless if the target is already shootable by everyone, or he flies where he's shootable by everyone
---
Shut up retard
---
Touche
---
such edge, much wow
---
Question, is it timezone tanking if we're actually an Australian alliance and it's in our prime time just because you can't hit it?
---
I know, which is where you can skip to after you see what is going on. Like I said.
---
Look to your own words. You don't remove a core tenet. Local isn't a core concept. The game being dangerous is.
---
This is a core concept that isn't just '16 years old,' and has been restated repeated by people who have come, gone and are still at ccp. This core concept was just restated weeks ago.

that happened to me too..I don't understand :0

Just add a timer to the cloaking module... 30 minutes should be a good balance.

Again, you're focusing on the DED points while ignoring what is more important to the overall post and calling it braindead. Yet those braindead points are what would allow you to keep carrying on in what I suppose is your playstyle with the least amount of overall pact and will give you the means to flourish. 
---
Look, if you keep insisting on projecting your idiocy onto others, this will just continue to be a case of you showing your ass.
---
another bug ive found is that HMLS fail to apply damage to anything at all ccp plz fix
---
Your choice of faction only affects your character cosmetically, and your starting skills. No matter what faction you pick initially, you can go anywhere and use every faction's ships and gear.
---
If you pick Gallente, you'll spawn in Gallente empire space. You'll start out with some skills in Gallente ships and weapons.
---
If you pick Caldari, you'll spawn in Caldari empire space, with some starting skills in Caldari ships and weapons.
---
Etc. etc. etc.
---
No matter which race you choose and where you spawn, you can reach anywhere in any empire's space in around half an hour at no risk to yourself. Empire space in general is considered a relatively "safe" zone, and no empire is going to shoot at you over which race you chose when you created your character.
---
In short, faction choice affects character cosmetics, spawn location, and starting gear. Nothing else. Every item and location in the game will be accessible to you no matter what you pick.
---
Null will be even safer when all PVE guys go to low and hi sec ;) all you going to be chasing is ghosts
---
Got it, thanks.
---
I think you have who is thinking one dimensionally backwards.
---
Yeah that requires buying shit. Before, you could just give the player 500 plex/2bil isk for free plus the SP they got (250k).
---
That’s equivalent to about another 2 injectors, or 1.250m SP total.
---
I didn’t know the SP reward was 1 mil now, thought it was still 250k, so that’s much better, but everything else you listed requires buying stuff and free &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paid any day.
---
Our Maximum Record is 3 days.
---
I don't think that counts as a pun but still a good joke.
---
No I don’t want cloak to work indefinitely to a point where someone can have 200 accounts and script them to login and cloak in 200 systems and not actively play

You don't actually have to spam dscan that much, you can have a more robust intel network of reporting hostile movement.  If there's no wormholes in your system the likelihood of something jumping out at you is incredibly low. Furthermore, your attitude appears to be that you're entitled to easy null sec PVE.  If the burden of doing Null isn't worth it anymore, then that is VERY much the point.  Take your isk efficiency loss and do it in high sec, or do group content to have the back up via numbers.  Before the blackout the best isk was in (is in) null and it was being done with less real risk than even some high sec runners.  And it's not even close to the risk lvl 5 runners are taking on.
---
I was thinking about dscan being/removed nerfed last night too.  To reduce it to like 2-5au or something, or maybe attach dscan to having a core probe launcher or something.  In addition/alternatively increasing the reliability of rats tackling people when doing pve.  Right now people fit hyper specific ratting fits which is why ratting feels so vulnerable - it is, those fits suck ass vs a ship that's out to kill people, generally speaking.  If it becomes necessary to be able to fight back while doing pve isk/hour goes down (which is good) and the experience of doing pve while getting caught would improve.  We could have rats prioritize harassing the agressor as well so both parties are under pressure. 
---
The bottom line is: Null has always been regarded as the big "goal" and perhaps the closest we have to end game.  It should be meaningfully more challenging to live there than in high sec, but right now it's the opposite.  The nuisance of going to your mission hub to be an errand boy is a bigger burden than just slamming anoms which is just ridiculous.  If we want that to be how null sec is, it should be accompanied by the risk of other players actually able to threaten ratters.
---
that would be too smart of a move from them, giving them too much credit
---
It's just part of the plan so everyone starts using faction guns on all ships and more isk value gets destroyed dont lie Falcon. /s
---
But you were okay with way less hassle before, for way more reward than high sec or lowsec offered.
---
You should basically never use Meta 0 modules. That means modules that are just named things like "Warp Scrambler I". They have terrible stats, and are only good as mats for making T2 modules. Meta is kinda like Gear Score in other games, and can be seen by using the Compare tool in the Variations tab of pretty much any module. 
---
Look for modules with Keywords like Enduring (better Cap usage) or Scoped (longer range) or especially for rookies with low skills, Compact (lower fitting requirements).
---
You can not respond on majority of smaller ships. Rorquals are of course exception and to some extend orcas too but everything else is too small to react.
---
If you aren't active/diligent the attacking group can punt the timer out of your TZ and remove your timezone tanking. You have to know the enemy to time properly.
---
Ex, being attacked by USTZ alliance so you stront for 30 hours. The enemy instead puts your citadel into RF in early EU so the timer comes out in mid USTZ after 30 hours. Therefore you have to adjust the stront timing against an EU attack by scouting it. However, now if your timer gets hit in late US it comes out early EU.
---
Really cool to see some shake up going on, I never did like the blue doughnut that I've seen going on when I was paying attention.  I just need to get on more and play, even if it's small ships in a fleet.
---
Should have never kicked Wally
---
RIP in pieces
---
Yeah but zkill content numbers will skew, I mean less pilots are undocking plus all of the bots are gone, so you cant really expect more things to die if less pilots are in space. But things are definitely still dying, and will continue to do so.
---
As far as I remember EG was vouch only and if you fucked up you got kicked, which almost never happened, because everybody was pretty disciplined. It was a brutal difference to the normal CFC/Imp fleets, the level of FCing by Vee and his team was unmatched to most other FC's we had/faced, Elo gave us good fights, but apart from him it was unrivaled. It was the best time of EVE I ever had and really miss it. Even Mittani dropped regularly in comms and listened us dunking everybody left, right and centre.
---
It actually hurts to see that so many good people left the game or seem to be inactive.

---
Right,  
---
I think it would be neat to give them "more teeth" so to say. Make it so activating a kill right denies infrastructure services for the duration of the timer (e.g. no docking, no tethering, no gates). A run but cant hide approach.
---
Issue is how can we adjust stront when were at work?
---
It “literally” is because we kept track of losses in delve. We lost 1.8T in large assets (with sub caps lost, that MAYBE goes up to 3T at MOST). In structures ONLY, we killed 4.2T up in the north. So shut the fuck up about shit you don’t know about.
---
I can’t seem to find the zkill stats I saw before, I will link when I do. 
---
Those botting werent being caught before anyway. Them not undocking doesn’t effect PVP numbers.
---
You d benefit from an alt, i do it in carrier and cyno/prober
---
Your point would work better if your example wasn't within the rules.
---
Too soon
---
Have friends.
---
The part missing is that goons did it before blackout. An they were clear that they had 0 intent on keeping it. They glassed the region an were reading to do more till ccp pulled the NPC undock an save NC drifter event.
---
Aura menopause maybe...
---
no but all kills in general are affected. I've been in a couple corps recently who are a part of the legacy blue donut, and a LOT of their krab players refused to undock right now because they have no intel. 
---
So I agree that the bots won't drastically impact the zkill stats, but the general sheepishness of the average eve carebear will when they just stop playing because they don't feel safe in the most dangerous places in EVE.
---
I'd swap a cap recharger for a battery, the neut resist is super nice and I think you should have the fitting room? And a drone nav comp instead of one of the painters, you very quickly become limited more by drone travel time than by time-to-kill IIRC
---
Otherwise yeah, this is pretty damn similar to what I would use.
---
I think you will see a lot of the carebears without teeth who just rent in nullsec pick up and go too
---
You can’t click the anom in the probe window
---
That's actually a feature my friend.
---
On top of what other people have said, you shouldn't usually mix buffer tank with active tank. It tends work best as active plus resists.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
&gt; This is really just a long shot post of adapt or die.  
---
Yeah pretty much, as I said many posts before have said the same, just wanted to add my own input. I just think CCP are doing the right thing in maybe making life in a null bloc maybe feel a bit less secure, and maybe curbing some of the crazy isk income we've seen in recent years.
---
Who's been a bad boy?

The ships lost in delve is a private sheet but you can look on zkill for losses in delve by GSF between May 18th and June 27th.
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks! :)
---
Lol meant usd, but if that’s the only critique you have, ez dub for me
---
I believe Input broadcasting is only a TOS offence if you use it to gain an unfair advantage over other players.   
---
Joining a fleet at the same time probably doesn't fall into that. It just saves someone clicking the same thing 50 times.   
---
Now moving around / warping / combat with input broadcasting is 100% an unfair advantage.

Totally into this idea, but we should add automated defenses to the KS to make it fair... some kind of mix between lasers and autocannons.
---
The only thing to fear in black out is if you go out to pve in sub caps. That's about it. Elite pvp in eve is dunking mining frigates with t3 and then strangling yourself while you jerk off on fruit, it's quite embarrassing.
---
Even if you are down to NO ships, you can just fly outside of the invasion area, in a pod or corvette, and find level 1 agents etc there via the Agency tool. And as far as ships elsewhere even a single frigate would suffice.
---
You could even try doing some "Project Discovery" if you want a risk-free way of getting a bit of isk to get a frigate or two with fittings.
---
Everyone has their own way of hunting. You'll find a lot of conflicting opinions here, but step 1 is always have your overview set up properly. I use the sarashawa overview pack and have my dscan set to "normal PVP" or "Ships only"
---
Then I pull down the range slider in increments until they vanish, then I manually type in the inbetweens to narrow down the range to about 1-2AU. After that, I cone to 15 degrees and press V on every celestial in that area - more often than not you'll find people either in a belt or at an anomaly. Never warp to 0 or 100, always go something like 25. I have my manual warp distance set to 2500m to prevent bumping or decloaking on the things I warp to as well.
---
2 guys took sov from another small group?  How does that fix the giant wasteland of wasted null bloc sov?
---
Krab sandwiches are the best
---
Well said mate.
---
Exactly, and that causes pvp to go down.
---
If your members don’t undock they don’t get hunted or make isk.
---
They a) don’t make isk to buy more ships to pvp with. yeah, srp exists, but not for small alliances (i mean it does but let’s compare goon srp to rote kapelle srp lul)
---
b) they don’t have the opportunity to get hunted. that’s such a big part of the eve experience. if NC comes and fucks test ratters for a month, test is going to start to hate nc, and maybe get more organized with their defense, thus creating content.
---
Couldn't even deliver shirts. Why do I keep letting other people try to run Rote. Go back to hisec.
---
They're only useful in high sec.  Make it so activating a kill right denies infrastructure services for  the duration of the timer in lowsec (e.g. no docking, no tethering, no gates). This provide a better way to force fights and provide "retribution"
---
This is pretty bad... 3/10, and only because at least you took the time to fake that Discord convo.

Honestly local was not the issue it was how pervasive and oppressive structures are and that they have not touched anomalies in almost 5 years. The replacement of POS which could only be anchored on a moon and maybe 1 station in a system had less safe spots than the 25 or more stations that can be anchored anywhere in the system currently.
---
Well I guess not everything can be saved. Or perhaps you need to work out some new methods? 
---
If the risk is too much for you then perhaps null sec isn’t the space for you.
---
I dunno, I'm of a different mindset in that I think the actual people who love to pvp are more active. Before you knew you were going to be on intel and a lot of the juicy things to hunt would safe up quickly. 
---
I mean personally I have no problem putting 40 killmails on zkill solo roaming in nullsec right now, and that is pretty well on par with what it was pre-blackout, but now I can actually hunt in someone's staging without a 40-man blob waiting at the entrance because I was on intel 10 jumps out.
---

Replace the scrambler for a meta one, drop the plate and put hardeners, and last but not least: use all your module slots, including the rigs (only exception to that rule is some utility high that can be left unused in certain fits).

yes 100% agree with you there, structures are ridiculous. I find it hilarious that alliances can own dozens of the largest structure in game. I think when the keepstar came around, it is one that should have been capped to 1 or 2 at maximum per alliance. Every major null group has a super highway of jump gates on keepstar grids, and that is just stupid. Siege forts are bad enough, let alone peppering space with a dozen astras/raits per system.
---
It just makes it a stupid feat to try and remove someone from their space.
---
Nah man, that tz tank is annoying enough for an entire coalition to deal with, doubt two alliances would be doing anything other than putting a gun to their head in game after the 80th citadel timer in an off tz.
---
Ummm who shit in your cheerios? Like seriously go look at my kb. I damn near only kill shit that cant fight back lol. This is absurd. Please some one open a contract on me so I can has more content.
---
You're either being deliberately obtuse, or you're an idiot who can't understand my point.  There is a giant wasteland of sov, period.  Goons, PanFam, and TEST use their space.  Pretty much nobody else does.  All those minimum ADM systems are ripe for the taking.  If 2 guys can beat back a 300 man alliance and hold sov, 20-50 dedicated nerds can definitely do it.  
---
Nobody is suggesting Delve get invaded.  But just about every other region is available right now if someone wants it.  But everyone is too scared to try.
---
Serious question, why not?
---
I can't tell if this is supposed to be a shitpost or not. In any case, this certainly is a shitty post.
---
Others get good with time. Just have to keep showing up to hunt that content. I'm shit a solid 50% the time ha

They can be easy. I grind structures a lot,if the structure is set to Monday-Friday at 1800 there is a basically 0% chance I kill it based purely on I'm not taking off work to kill some rando raitaru.

Except it's not because nullsec has asset safety so living there is far less risky, in terms of your stuff being taken away from you, than living in J space.
---
&gt; their reward is now in the gutter
---
Only in comparison with the levels they're used to with zero risk - which the MER has shown is consistently injecting vast amounts of ISK into the economy, so it's good that it's gone down somewhat.
---
Big sigma ? You killed my heron in a random wh when I began eve ! 1v1 me at sun
---
Low effort shitposts only work if they're done ironically
---
I'm convinced all the bots in nullsec moved to r/eve for the duration of the blackout.
---
You have got alot of good recommendations only one i would add is maybe skill into a incursion battleship fit an run with blokes like warp to me an get some isk to make a nest egg to fund some ship losses as you dive into the low an null sec cesspools where we all end up :)
---
&gt;Now that your security blanket is gone, all you krabs are whining because you actually have to log in to comms in order to know what's going on...
---
Fuck deaf people
---
Exactly this. Depends on the situation ofc but this is a good generalisation
---
yes you can.  Not the solar system map, the list of anoms in the probe windown you can most assuredly click on, and if you're holding V, you'll see your Dscanner go off.
---
Quite literally use it every day.
---
&gt; But are you going to volunteer your playtime. Because they can't compensate you for the isk/hr that you are losing.
---
I'm honestly not sure what you're trying to say here.
---
If you join my corp then sure I'll use some of my time to scout or protect you, and so will everyone else. That's how corporations work.
---
A buffer is the plate and trimark rigs; they add to the raw armor HP. The "active" tank is the armor repairer (rigs like an adaptive nano pump provide additional bonuses to it), which actively restores hit points but does not increase the raw total. Additional resists (from the damage control, adaptive plating, etc.) help both active and buffer tanks, but really pay off over time with extended use of an active tank, as in most PVE.  
---
In a solo PVP fight, you typically want to pick either a buffer tank (and hope they die before you run out of HP) or an active tank (and hope your active reps can stay afloat under the incoming damage until they die). In larger group fights, logistics ships can provide your active tank remotely, so ships tend to fit more buffer.
---
so wait, because you're a conspiracy theorist i have to play other games?
---
can you provide a single shred of evidence that ccp puts bots in their own game?
---
like even one?
---
Ah so no proof. Gotcha, have a good one!
---
Wrecking shot
---
Feel free to go fuck yourself.
---
The point about groups who can't defend their own space is spot on.  That cannot be said loudly enough.
---
A buffer tank is something that passively gives you more HP, but you trade something for it (Cargo space, speed, increased Signature Radius):
---
- Hull: Transverse Bulkheads (Rig), Reinforced Bulkheads (Low)
---
- Armor: Trimark Armor Pumps (Rig), Plates (Low)
---
- Shields: Core Defense Field Extenders (Rig),  Shield Extenders (Medium)
---
Active tanks are how we refer to self-repair modules:
---
- Hull Repairer (Medium) -- Very inefficient, very slow, only really useful for soloers deep into enemy space with a Mobile Depot.
---
- Armor Repairers (Low)
---
- Shield Booster (Medium)
---
Active tanking will typically give you more EHP in most fights, but buffer tanks are usually fit when you have support from Logistics ships (Remote Reps) or want to avoid getting alphaed (one-shot) off the field.
---
Sometimes you don't have the fitting room or cap for double actives, so you'll fit one rep and one plate, but those are pretty niche cases.
---

---
If having to acknowledge the people around you as your peers insults you, I pity how you must feel, burdened by the drudgery of ignorant swine around you.  I don't know why I'm bothering with you at this point, but here is why what you're saying is ridiculous:
---
&gt; You are indeed correct about inflation and asset proliferation being a problem, and you are not technically *in*correct in pointing to super umbrellas as a cause. Without the protection of umbrellas, nullsec anomalies might very well pump out substaintially less isk and ore, which WOULD be a positive change. 
---
You literally just said without umbrellas that there would be less anoms completed and ore collected.  If you know it's a positive change, then why are you defending them?  They are hording space and impeding change in null sec.  There is NOT an upside to Umbrellas as they are.  Maybe the large alliances that hold swaths of space like them, but that's what's killing the game.  People are frothing at the mouth to be line members waiting for artificial content.  The people who DO want that are actually worse for the game because they exist only to consume content and generate nothing of value for the game.
---
&gt; With that said, though, the problem in this case isn't that it is possible for people to engage in pve activities unmolested, but rather that nullsec space vastly outproduces hi-/lowsec in terms of isk, and universal ship losses in terms of ore and minerals. This problem is rooted in infinitely respawning isk/ore anomalies and the effectiveness of the tools available for harvesting them (ie: multiboxing rorqs). Addressing these issues would solve the problem without the negative side effects that removing umbrellas would entail. 
---
Null sec is the best case of end game we have, and there needs to be goals in eve - Null is it.  Of course it's going to have the ability to out produce high sec, we WANT that to be true.  We also want it to be difficult and dangerous to do.  All making null worthless does is make people not want to be there for any reason.  Holding null already is a chore between logistics and grinding, but that clearly hasn't been an adequate impediment to the sprawling empires that we have now. 
---
&gt; Just because you don't like a particular option that's available to you doesn't mean that it should be denied to everyone, especially when you have so many alternatives available to you. 
---
I don't know how many times I have to explain this to you: this is fucking circular logic that makes no fucking sense.  You're telling me I'm not entitled to murder every ratter that decides to undock, and I'm saying no ratter is entitled to unanimous safety.  If ratting becomes more dangerous be it because there is no more umbrella or because rats keep you tackled while you're in site does not mean people can't rat anymore, it just means they're going to die more often.  You're assuming also that hunters won't die in the process of hunting ratters, but nothing about hunters dying is being changed, save for shitting on using an umbrella to drop on people.  NOONE, not me, nor the ratters are allowed to be safe.  
---
At this point it's pretty clear that you think PVE is the driving force of the game and that PVPers are incapable of producing the content that drives the economy which is just so ass backwards.  Most pvpers know how to and in fact do pve to support themselves.  The players who want to do PVE without players shooting back at them can't be in null sec, as it is predicated on people being able to shoot other players.  Right now, the ecosystem makes it impossible for small groups to shoot players in large alliances because of umbrellas, and that kills the game.  If you can't swing up, there is no point to try and cut out space for yourself, your only option to affect change through large political awox or be a monkey of a group trying to get larger than their adversary.
---
where did you find a 4th highslot?
---
&gt; Check the newborn graphs and check how HS is looking, you will pretty quickly realise thats mainly bots and lots of them to offset the deficit of NS bots. That literally means nothing
---
But apparently the reduction in numbers in NS - from bots no longer 'playing' - is meaningful?
---
Better idea:
---
Remove your post. Or at least work a little more in the post.
---
I didn't mean fabricated, I'm sure it was actually posted on Discord.
---
&gt; So you basically think that PL didn't create this situation? 
---
No, as we had nothing to do with rorqual changes and skill injectors, thanks Aneu.
---
Also I quite literally never knew or cared you were gay. I call you a cocksucker because I think you suck dicks.  
---
&gt;No one is butt-mad
---
Thats not what it looks like, you still blaming an alliance who beat your ass repeatedly for all the games problems.
---
There shouldn't be TZ tanking at all.  You shouldnt be able to determine when a hostile can hit you.  It's like saying sorry can we hold off this battle whilst we have a quick nap.  Being in null is supposed to be dangerous isnt it.  It works both ways as well for more powerful groups.  I mean  goons for example whose going to try fight them on their TZ? No one.. hence why they have fortress Delve.  And look let's be honest if anyone really want to kill your stuff they would alarm clock if they must..
---
They will never be a 'fair' solution. Because someone Will always favoured or your always going to have o e group that's stronger than they other.  I'm not sure you can balanced that without restricting alliances numbers and blue standings..
---
I miss you. You are a good dude.
---
Hmm that does not work for me unless I am in fw space clicking plexes
---
Saar is fine with buffer tank, since it generally acts just as a delay buffer. You're looking to get out of it 8 cycles, for which you usually won't need cap injectors, which active tanks use.
---
You'd typically fit an offline salvager or mining laser to soak heat damage if you had an empty high slot, though.
---
Eh, it had its bullshit too... I remember in ASCN, we'd take a freighter convoy (~40 freighters and 140 battleships in +1/-1 escort, and ~20 scouts checking the route) from feythabolis to empire every week... Took about four hours each way iirc. But one day, despite all our efforts, Stain Alliance pulled a logon trap and just slaughtered the frieghters. 
---
Obviously we'd gotten too predictable, but I guess the real point I want to make is, that took a shit load of people's time every week just to keep the poses fueled and we used to burn out a lot of people out just keeping the lights on.
---
You misspelled "retarded" on the title.
---
Show your numbers then
---
Did you reply to the wrong post?
---
If you run them outside HS and have friends to save you then it's not going to be 1vX, is it? Because your friends will upgrade the 1.
---
Looks like you just want to be able to PVE with no risk of someone choosing to engage you. That shouldn't be possible for high reward PVE.
---
Yep stront timers make sense and is a mechanic that most ppl who ran pos's are familiar with. Would solve the perfect timer problem that we currently have and then force larger groups to either increase work in maintaining structures or not have as many as they do.
---
I stopped ganking them because there was so many hunters taking the good targets. So if wager that you are incorrect.
---
We're a lowsec alliance and I wouldn't consider setting a timer in our prime time on our prime day as attempting to avoid fights
---
Good riddance! This guy is total cancer to deal with. He’s made a constant stream of bad choices ever since taking over leadership.
---
His most recent blunder was thinking his group LS nanobrains could make it in NS. Clearly the pressure is too much and they will be better off without him.

I wouldnt be too surprised if mittens reads this.

This combined with the fact there's no pvp anywhere in nullsec anymore, can't blame him tbh. Can't rat, can't mind, FCs arent pinging, what are people supposed to do? Thanks retard ccp

I’d love to talk to mittens, but I think he is to busy herding morons.
---
Panfam, moved further south after Goons glassed their regions and saw it as an opportunity to move to better space. So they are now in dronelands. GOTG already is spread thin with their space and therefore have no need for it. So Vale and Tribute look to be the new etherium reach, with smaller pvp alliances moving in.
---
Minmatar is the correct choice. Gallente are iyt to.
---
** Botters: ** the continuing excuse for all actions. If CCP wants the bots gone, they'd get rid of them. 
---
** PVP: ** Harder to find targets that don't immediately drop supers on you. Also harder to find targets in general, unless using info via starmap, dotlan or other ESI data parsers, or simply looking at there the main crabbing fleet is at
---
** Interaction: ** This is some next level mental gymnastics
---
** Moving to highsec ** Small groups couldn't compete well before blackout, now they can't do jack. Join mega alliance or die is not good for the hunter. 
---
** Income ** reducing anom spawn rates and a few other minor changes would have gone a long way to making people spread out. Sadly we instead get changes that hurt the little guy and don't do much to the big ones

Wow thanks for the lesson today, I did not know this was a thing.

Some CCP developer is sweating his ass off typing away on a keyboard trying to find the bug that caused it like "This shouldn't have happened, how the hell did the skills just turn off?  We werent even working on that section of the code!?"
---
Nah, there should be 1 timer at least to give people a chance to prepare and defend or elsewise there will be no small groups around anymore.
---
Does this apply to Panic Attack too?
---
afaik that has been proven to be a myth long ago, empty slots absorb heat damage just like any module would, so there is no need to fit offlined crap at all.
---
My quick search only showed some old forums topic about it, where someone said that this theory was proven wrong by pyfa's creator.
---
you can create an *Overview* filter that you will then select in the DScan top-right dropdwon box, where it says *XX Filtered (FilterName)*
---
Bots also use d-scan, better remove it from null while we are at it
---
Ancil+Extender is also fairly common in pvp shield fits. LSE+LASB gives you a lot more buffer and fitting room in exchange for losing a mid slot vs XLASB for example. I found out the hard way that a single arty cane will make an XLASB nosprey bleed structure on the first cycle. Buffer's good for you.
---
Fit rigs, use your low slots, and don't use meta0 mods and empty slots. You have a lot of available Pg and CPU.
---
Make sure you put paste in your ancillary repairer!
---
Same. Once I went venture hunting, assumed maxed tank and so fit max alpha thrasher. I think it ended up with a 3k volley. Ended up 1 shitting a venture, laughed my ass off

Input broadcasting, specifically.

It's really not.

This makes me anxious to see the July MER.

This is what is spot on.
---
If you are new and not in a rorqual you are doing it wrong.
---
Eve is a game with few rules. No matter where you are, someone will want to ruin your day. There is no true escape from pvp in eve, which is part of what makes it so interesting. We're all in this sociopathic space murder sandbox together.
---
Just by figuring out how to avoid gankers, you are participating in pvp. As it is meant to be. :)
---
No? Not unless you count ihub upgrades which don't show on kills...most assets were taken down before the invasion
---
The thera’s one obviously.

Vic never left our hearts.

Considering the flux of people saying old game mechanics (developed to be learned, used, and becoming advantageous for those that took the time to master them) should be, either abandoned because everybody shouldn't have it if a few can't learn it or new convoluted stuff should be added because of reasons... Yeah, I'm inclined to agree with you! :(

It does in a case like this. How your example actually would look if it was similiar:

"Hey i noticed you've got a lot of dodgy contracts up, many billions being handed over from you to 1-day old RNG-named characters... what's up with that?"
---
"Yeah I sell plex for USD"
---
Yeah, that actually is admitting to the action stated there. The guy in this instance had questions because of his same-tick actions and admitted to using something that's against EULA to achieve the effect.
---
Change the plate for a heatsink or adaptive hardener and stay classy ✌️
---
thera is not a wormhole &gt;:(
---
Actually, my original point was that a small group can't take sov from large blocs, who are not, in fact, using all of their space.
---
But keep on keepin' on breh.

Any contracts on spy infiltration? Be happy to join and pass on the infos.

Can someone link the killmail for this thread?
---
for a lack of better zkill search filters, you can see [here](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/1354830081/stats/) that GSF kills more than we lose in both May and June.  So...as I said to the other guy here, shut the fuck up about shit you don't know about.
---
Well, the content and profitability of a bounty hunter doesn't really have anything to do with purchasable kill rights. 
---
Selling a kill right is a way to punish the player. They have to be careful where and what they fly because there's now someone who can attack and possibly kill them anywhere in space without intervention from Concord or other players. 
---
The person who buys it gets the opportunity to hunt this person and potentially make their money back from the loot. They're purchasing the ability to attack that person anywhere, without consequence. It's not intended to be a payment to them for killing the person, but a way to ensure retribution, and potentially for the purchasing player to make a profit from the loot.
---
The bounty system is broken for reasons that don't affect the kill right system. If there was a way to change the bounty system without breaking it and without giving players the chance to abuse it, more people would be bounty hunters. It used to be worth it to attack someone with a high bounty, but as the payout is currently tied to the value of the other player's ship, it isn't worth it anymore, as you still don't have the "right" to kill that player, and unless outside HS, will lose your own ship in the process. 
---
They should leave the current kill right system alone and fix the broken bounty system. How they do that, I've no clue - which is probably why they haven't done it.
---
If they aren't actively playing, and you don't know they are there, how is it any different from them not being logged in?
---
Imma need your dealers number bro
---
Because u cant without dying. So its unfair if you work for ur money
---
I mean...some of the replies to this are..hmmm.
---
Yes, but it’s easier than a random wh for bringing ships for an 1v1
---
Then I missed your point - I thought you were upset at the huge tracts of dead null out there.  No, nobody can take sov from the Goons. Working as intended.  But anyone can take and hold sov from any of the drone region alliances, including FRAT.  Also working as intended.
---
well I never said there was less content, actually I think content has gone up. I go hunt the blue donut space and get plenty of it :) 
---
And hard to say botters weren't a problem since all of a sudden you roam null space and dont see pockets with 5 insta-dock VNIs in 6 systems.
---
Small groups can compete, if you choose to try and move into space belonging to a large bloc, expect to get stomped. You can be friends with some of them, or do what Centi and Unspoken are doing, living in tribute fighting with everyone. If your idea of being a small group in null is to just undock and krab billions of isk and be left alone, then expect to be let down.
---
And it's not hard to find targets lol, if you're afraid to dip into horde staging or goons, or test, or any other densely populated area, then dont be surprised if you dont see much in the sparsely populated space.
---
mail me ingame and we can 1v1 tomorrow my friend
---
It's amazing how much Rote like to post about how great blackout and more nullsec 'risk' is when the first thing they do in Tribute is blue up Unspoken, the other consistent vocal group about how great blackout is, also coincidentally active in the same TZ and area as them. But hey guys, blackout is great, 0.0 is live and kicking, come visit ~~~our gate camps~~~ tribute, just so long as we actually don't have to put anything on the line.
---
~~Rust~~ Trust
---
Fixed it
---
Cant see where I mentioned avoiding fights..
---
Well it depends on how and where you are going to fly it. The best Lowsec fit is not so hot if you take it into nullsec. 
---
As someone said don't mix active tank with buffer tank (I would like to know the justification for this rule). I would go for buffer for newbies, as their is less to juggle.
---
Also you got no rigs on that ship. Extra bonuses to weapons or tank that you are leaving out.
---
As an aside if you click to import/export button in the corner of the fitting you will get the option to copy the fit to your clipboard in a standard text format that you can paste into a web browser. Less typing that way.
---
What's the isk per site? Need something to whilst training my rorqs....
---
This guy is correct.  He's also a subpar FC, but he's cute and has a sexy voice when he's excited.
---
I am mainly a PvE player.
---
And being honest, hearing that "someone will want to ruin your day" when you just wanna mind your own business makes the whole thing feel toxic.
---
I recall YF sold to PL *because* CVA was screwing them over, but every side is gonna have a dfferent story....
---
I agree with most of your post, but "If CCP wants the bots gone, they'd get rid of them" makes it sound so easy. There's a reason practically every MMO has a botting problem, and making sure no one ever bots is much easier said than done.
---
wait below par is good right
---
Agreed
---
lmgtfy
---
It's not so much toxic as...not a theme park game. Even in theme park pure PvE MMOs there are roaming bullshit enemies, Fel Stalkers being a good example in warcraft. The difference is in this game they're players.
---
Fuck your alliance for not being willing to relay for deaf members.
---
I'm contemplating a similar strategy, keep em simple and cheap and not fuss when they do finally get jumped. One thing I'm not sure on is Sentries vs Heavies. Which would you recommend?
---
[We're blue? ](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78002907/)
---
Fake news.
---
it's not unfair, you choose to live in nullsec, or no security, so all activities should come with elevated risk. You can go earn isk for lower risk, but expect to see less returns for that risk level.
---
She used to llove you, ya know.. Till you went and broke her heart for no reason.
---
what a low effort troll wow
---
100%. If you cant have a patrol that is pre-formed and ready to respond anywhere in your space, you have too much space.
---
What’s the elephant? Serious.
---
Never not put wally out to pasture, tbh.
---
Prepare for the whine brigade.
---
He's right, that in many cases you shouldn't, but on frigates they're the most common.  There's a reason when you see small ancillary armor repairers mixed in with a moderate hull tank (basically the damage control and your hull buffer).  Active modules really are just a replenishing buffer and instead of stacking out all our EHP at once, they parcel it out.  Once you think of active shield and armor reppers this way, it gets less dogmatic.
---
Programs like Pyfa will tell you exactly how much EHP a module like a small ancillary armor repairer (SAAR) will parcel out in reload cycle. There's a very good reason to use something like the SAAR in combination with a damage control and leaning on your hull for buffer.  I'll use the very common meta Imperial Navy Slicer to fit as an example:
---
    [Imperial Navy Slicer, Meta Solo]
---
    Heat Sink II
---
    **Small Ancillary Armor Repairer, Nanite Repair Paste**
---
    Nanofiber Internal Structure II
---
    5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive
---
    Warp Disruptor II
---
    Small Focused Pulse Laser II, Scorch S
---
    [Empty High slot]
---
Small Focused Pulse Laser II, Scorch S
---
    Small Energy Locus Coordinator II
---
    Small Energy Locus Coordinator I
---
The above fit has 3.01k EHP.  That's very low but this is a kite fit that leans on its range and speed. In Pyfa, when you look over to one of the columns on the right for the SAAR, you'll see that it repairs 1.85k EHP over the course of its 8 repair charges. So its functional EHP before reload is 4.86k EHP.  What's more, the SAAR has VERY good fitting, it only takes up 5 powergrid and 5 CPU but increases your EHP by well over 50%.
---
If we were to replace the SAAR with something like 200mm rolled tungsten compact plates, we'd only get an additional 0.92k EHP, which is basically half of what the SAAR gives us in one rep cycle but additionally, it requires 9 powergrid, 11 CPU (it's already over the CPU fitting room for this fit) and since it's a plate, the top speed got hit and now only goes 3573 m/s instead of 3786 m/s with the SAAR.  Other than the cap usage and additional skill in managing your rep cycles, there's absolutely no reason to use the plate over the SAAR on this particular ship.  It's not uncommon to see meta fit frigates and destroyers that have SAARs equipped but no other armor mods like resist mods, instead they'll have the SAAR and a damage control (DCU), opting instead to lean on their hull for the rest of their buffer. You see this SAAR/DCU combo on this meta fit Slicer above, a very popular Atron fit as well as a very popular Confessor fit.
---
I know you have to repay your self for morons that don’t listen but damn was it annoying to hear this dude repeat himself 6 times
---
Can you still use POS's for refining and reactions?
---
You don't even need to be pre-formed.  Just be active and ready to defend your shit.
---
Put anything on the line? I'm feeding shit pretty constantly.
---
You're elite sweetie.
---
I rat and mine in null. My umbrella is my alts. I lose some subcaps, who gives a shit? If I make 300m and lose 30m, I really dont care.
---
Plus when rigs came out they were so expensive that they were not common place on ships for a good 2 years or so. Battleships would use them and that was about it. If you saw a cruiser with rigs you knew the pilot was loaded. I remember the first time I killed a frigate that had 3 rigs and I was like "wtf who has that kind of money to drop rigs on a frig"
---
For reference, for a long while the only rigs in the game were what we now call large rigs (hence the occasional dead super with large rigs) but they were the price of t2 large rigs so putting 3 rigs on a kestrel was a good 200 to 300 mil. Also isk per hour was alot lower then so making 300mil took time.
---
I still have a kestrel with 3 large rigs and a cruise missile launcher, it's kind of goofy but that's the kind of stuff we had.
---
are you legit still *that* assmad about getting removed from the spire lmoa
---
No, i personally have my overview set to show thrm differently from other people, then i click on their name and next to the name there is a target ridicule that you can press that tells you how much the kill right is and gives you an option to activate it
---
&gt;moving around with input broadcasting
---
you mean the regroup command?
---
&gt; warping with input broadcasting
---
you mean fleet warping?
---
&gt;combat with input broadcasting
---
you mean drone triggers?
---
Lol, pathetic
---
If it's AI enemies, it feels less malicious.
---
I can't imagine players who go into an open world game with the expressed purpose of ruining the day for others being really people you want to come across.
---
Oh no, my Corp is fairly active. I'm fine. My thing with the seal clubbing comes from when you guys beat up on Provi. It's a personal rule for me to never go to Provi for the purpose of attacking them inside their home. If they step out of Provi they are fair game, but attacking Provi is like beating up the crippled kid on crutches.
---
It "literally" isn't since querious, fountain period basis etc. are imperium too and you need to add them when you want to jerk off about low power azbels from bot that you "glassed" ;-) 
---
I don't have actual numbers right now to prove anything but you aren't far away from 4T for sure.
---
But who cares about boring numbers, the point is that - considering you overwhelming resources and numbers - this was the saddest and worst executed campaign this game has seen in years.  You guys lost most subcap fights despite outnumbering the north 2 or 3 times. You failed to trap northern supers, you failed several times to form early enough for keepstar timers etc.
---
So shut the fuck up about shit you don't know and die to boredom in delve while your "defeated" :-D :-D :-D enemy just builds up a new keepstar and has loads of fun against test
---
Yeah solo roaming in a BS outside of your own umbrella is just asking for a cyno.
---
Fo real. This post is the one. I'm finally sold on the necessity of including a /s for all sarcastic text-based communications.
---
It's almost like force projection and umbrellas are the real defining characteristic between now and then...
---
You can’t change safety from green while in control of a structure.
---
it was never really more than those two offered, it was just a lot less hassle, by a significant margin.
---
Set a man on fire you'll be warm for the rest of his life.
---
I'm afraid that with a suspect timer your friends won't be doing much more than watching you die. This is why my idea of requiring 0.4 space or below for T5s would be better than all of this "bring back suspect timers" bullshit. It accomplishes your goal of putting Abyssal runners at risk but also allows organized groups to fight back. I would even like to see something like a covops gang using a random tracker to bait other hunters in to kill the hunters for a gudfite
---
Well sir. If you ratted or mined for your money in null as most here do NOT, then you would not need it explained. Empathy is not Reddit's strength.
---
It is easy. 
---
Problem is how eve works encourages botting + makes it easy. Couple this with no in engine detection for someone being online for 23 hours at a time, or a character doing a strenuous activity for untold hours without and slowdown. 
---
Even still there's not much difference between the afk highsec orca miner and a bot doing it.
---
Move to wh space, make Promi CEO, he knows how to live there. He can give directions :P
---
:-* Promi ;)
---
Back to highsec with ye. Mission running and belt mining, eve classic style.
---
It isn't, read my other comment answering him.
---
Oh, I realize that he's asking from a new perspective and probably doesn't know about missile application. But my point still stands.
---
Yeah, leave null to real men instead.
---
&gt; The blackout favours those people who have a 1 dimensional (shoot 'em up) approach to Eve
---
This is not true. That is it may be true for guys who think null should be a place to build empires in safety but not all industrial oriented players in general.
---
Concord warns you with a popup that leaving high security space can be dangerous. It's unrealistic to think you can move to null and rat and build in peace. If that is truly what you want, Highsec is the place for you. You won't make as much and your industrial builds might be limited but it is a safer option.
---
&gt;I like all aspects (but spend more time PVP than anything else)
---
I'm sorry man, but I am just not buying this. Unless by PVP you mean undock fifty harpies to kill a five man dessie gang. If you PVP (take chances) more often than not, you'd not be put out by the blackout making ratters dock up and hide. They would do that anyway if you popped up in local.
---
&gt;I can't help feeling that CCP are prioritising short term personal financial gain over the long term future of Eve
---
We don't really know how this has affected their bottom line. What I can say without equivocation is if they are doing this and know there's a fair chance the game is finished, I can only applaud them. I would rather see them shut down the game than turn it into "My little pony builders online". Every game is going to end in time. It's more important how they go out, rather than if they die.
---
&gt;The longer the blackout continues then the less likely that people will return. 
---
I would argue that numbers have declined partly as a result of the game makers making it more accessible for people who aren't likely to stay anyway. I'd argue that as the game became easier, people didn't feel challenged and left after getting bored. This game isn't designed for the feint of heart (or ingame wallet).
---
Ah ok thanks for clearing it up
---
&gt; what do you mean by glassed?
---
"Glassed" is a term popularized by the Halo novels referring to the Covenant strategy of using orbital bombardment to render a planet completely uninhabitable.  The Covenant use directed plasma weapons and it's so hot that it renders earth and sand to a dark, glossy glass.
---
Rote and Unspoken totally never knew each other prior to Tribute and having adjacent constellations was  totally not planned. Additionally we both Max form in EU, early US, late US, and AU bc we are all same timezone. We also never fight any of the surrounding groups, and are actually retarded for spending time camping one of the most highly trafficked gates in nullsec in the north.
---

---
Basic corpses already sell from 1-2m in Jita
---
So, it's just a change to make some people feel a bit more comfy. It seems like another case of crying for a god mode.  
---
This game is about gaming together with others. So try to find people from another timezone to help you. Or bash some other structure.  
---
For me, no need to change something.
---
Clear! 
---
I noticed that if you kill a belt rat, the loot is owned by the structures owner, not the pilot using the weapons.
---
the anomaly numbers, null sec ores, DED drops, all made much easier in nullsec with local and Intel channels. I'm just saying nullsec should be hard mode EVE farming. And now that it is, people are upset.
---
Actually all long range missiles follow that rule. But at a base Heavy missiles don't have fantastic range and don't do overwhelming damage. Combined with their relatively poor application and they end up as kind of a bad weapon. You'll find that in most cases where heavy missiles either do good dmg or hit from really far away, it has to do with the ship bonuses for the ship that fired them.
---
Hurray. It only took like 4 years.
---
chaos era
---
I've heard every idea imaginable, most of which are vindictively unbalanced. I just want mechanics that engage the player and allow hunters to be a lot more functional in attack and defense of an area.
---
So much spinning I am actually feeling motion sick
---
So that doesn’t answer my question, good post..
---
I've always considered lowsec pvp piracy. I never considered highsec anything other than grievers and gankers (I did both for years too).
---
I'm not starting an argument or trying to debate you. Just my humble opinion as a lowsec pirate :)
---
See in the military, we used to just call it turning it into a parking lot.
---
Yea it’s mental eh :)
---
RemindMe! 4 months
---
If CCP lets it go that long, I think the game's only loss will be bots and sub grinders who can't make omega anymore by running five AFK VNIs (which did get nerfed, btw) or AFK mining, who may as well be bots.
---
God they're so fucking garbage...

I unironically miss the drake meta

I don't actually remember! Sentries don't have to deal with travel time, so they may actually be better for blapping cruisers. I think it's what I used to use when I had 10-minute site times. But if you can fit a double drone nav comp in the mids heavies might be better! Worth mixing and matching to see, both work.
---
BUT if you take sentries, make sure you also take some Valkyries to blap frigate sleepers.
---
Haha yeah that one works too.
---
Well, based on my experience I will have to respectfully disagree. From what I've come to know, no one wants to spend their limited game time "on watch" just so another person can enjoy the game to their heart's content. People don't volunteer for guard duty irl, they are assigned it and compensated afterward. I realize that you are declaring otherwise, but talk is cheap and until a see a group big enough to fill a fleet in any time zone do as you insisted I'm going to keep assuming that humans will follows their typical line of behavior.
---
im on mobile soo i prolly fat fingered 4 MY BAD
---
&gt; it also lets people rp as the police with the fantastic skins for the bus and nyx
---
Let's be real, this was the true reason.  I instantly bought 3 Nyx police skins when they came out lol.
---
My first home was COGG, it’s really sad to know that Momo has stepped down :/
---
I hope Provi survives, goes on the offensive and do something new.
---
I still miss Provi from time to time
---
Believe me you have no idea the level of autism Eve players will go through just and exclusively to ruin other people's day. Some people (like CODE.) will go out of their way to harvest the tears of HighSec miners even at 0 gain or even *net loss* to themselves.
---
At the end of the day, Eve is an inherently PvP based game. Undocking in space is paramount to agreeing to PvP. Doesnt matter if you're in HighSec, LowSec, NullSec. People can and will hunt you given the opportunity.
---
There certainly are PvE main pilots out there, but if your thought is that people who actively seek out to kill others is a toxic environment---Eve probably isn't the game for you. If you get your ship blown up and complain you were just trying to mine/rat/etc., that'll only excite the attackers. To be sure, that is toxic, but the nature of Eve means that it's full of jaded and bitter veterans whose hearts have turned to solid ice, and I say this as someone who used to be like you---I had no interest in PvP and simply wanted to mission in peace. Now I laugh, as I helldunk a nullsec carebear.
---
it is hard mode - that's why players put so much effort in to things like intel channels and actually making an effort to secure the space they are living in.
---
Do your own bashing ffs.
---
Them's fighting words pal, I'll wreck u m8 1v1 me 0 at the sun
---
Id just go with Ogre II's. Save switching and still completes the sites easily. 9 minutes/site. Going to take your advice and throw on a cap battery and drone nav
---
Awesome news!
---
Right
---
Well you pretty much said it, they saw greener pastures and hopped the fence. Some of them wanted more content in terms of wars and to be able to grow bigger. For example, see where Evictus and Warped are atm. Truth is if you want to grow stronger and bigger Provi is unable to support you.
---
No kill mail just a idea a corpie had and i posted it to here
---
THose people you talk about, who seem to have no greater pleasure than to make others miserable, I know what I wish them.
---
And those people are also the reason why my default reaction to any player showing up in my vicinity is to just leave and enjoy my loneliness.
---
For sure, I agree people put a ton of work into those resources, but I just feel it's better to encourage people to actively patrol to protect their space, not park 10 alts up a pipe just to link hostile intel and safe up.
---

&gt; I just feel it's better to encourage people to actively patrol to protect their space, not park 10 alts up a pipe just to link hostile intel and safe up.
---
so, the very thing blackout promotes?
---
Checked account and it's fine. I guess it's just CCP dumped all the game time rewards I had from buddy program and the account ran on it for two years till it finally expired.
---
I strictly play eve on my phones hotspot while running music and coms. Its struggle through all of it I dont DC often just some lag hear and there.
---
I love you.
---
Came here to post this
---
CVA is gonna come for you now friend. Approx 1 year from now they will have formed up and will head out. Logi ratio 9:1
---
&gt;better space
---
Less assailable and as far away from goonswarm as possible.
---
sure, if your method of patrolling is parking alts on gates to watch them, then so be it, I'm sure major alliances do that right now. But there's a difference in having to park on a gate at a ping or cloaked and watch for actual gate activity, compared to just docking snug in your citadel watching for a name to blink on your local chat window.
---
man i kinda bummed im gonna miss this one. These are fun little get-togethers with dudes from all over eve. I reminds me of the early days of incursions where guys from all over new eden would get together in highsec and shoot stuff.
---
Holy shit CCP actually played their own game!
---
It will only decrease ice price and add a flat crystal fee onto your expenses
---
What's worse: being a goon shill or being an anti-goon shill? On one side, at least you still have an organized group to be a part of.
---
I'm already chucking ice at sub 30s cycles in a covetor with T1 boosts. TBH I dont know if I can click any faster
---
Oh, but friend...
---
*Those people are everyone*
---
EVE Online is claimed as an MMO, but it's more accurate to say it's a quarantine chamber where the most toxic and sinister video game players are kept. All other MMOs better hope that Eve never dies, because when it does, the influx of toxicity into other MMOs will be unstoppable.
---
The guy that just ignores half his coalition when counting his losses talks about spinnig :-D please go ahead, this is fun.
---
Way, way overdue. I'm glad this is finally happening.
---
Honestly, it doesn't even matter how much was killed vs whatever. It's about objectives. The stuff that died in Delve were personal assets. Those people learned some painful lessons. But when the dust settled one group was ousted and one group went home to krab. Claim all the moral victories you want, but looking at it from the outside even I can see who won this fight.
---
God I hate you.
---
Upvoted.
---
&gt; your method
---
no, that's literally the answer every one who thinks this is the best thing since sliced bread says - it's the phrase they utter after "adapt or die".
---
Grow your own food ffs.
---
&gt; I simply adapted and found an alternative means to making isk.
---
That's great and I applaud you but it doesn't change the fact you made it totally sound like "HAHA I stopped undocking and now make my isk from incursions" While you may not have meant it that way, it's how I interpreted it.
---
&gt;(we are recruiting)
---
 I don't know if I could take Grath rants or that he could take my constant poking and shit piloting. :)
---
Let's be honest. Stainguy is just here to shit on everything. No one needs to pay him 😀
---
It does not, no. Nor will I.
---
If you are too stupid to understand what I meant I won't waste my time trying to explain it to you.
---
i looked at your killboard and you seem to be beat by a 30day old toon
---
stfu with your SJW bullshit.
---
It is not racism when it is true facts.
---
If your culture is shit, that is your problem, it is not racism.
---
The guy that ignores the actual numbers (to their own admittance) talks about spinning* (there, corrected your spelling)
---
“It is hard to argue with a smart person, it is impossible to argue with a dumb one” -someone at some point in time, but most importantly, me right now
---
Garric where is my shirt.
---
Hehe
---
There is. Making someone who enjoys those tears salty - or hurt.
---
hahaha, ok mr high horse

What? Did you hurt your head buddy?

I wish Rote Kapelle a new future.
---
CCP likely to give us crystals that increase amount by 10% ... then use CcpRound(1.10) = 1

---
Welcome news, but is there a reason why CCP takes YEARS to fix things so obviously broken as fuck??
---
It's Pirat, thought I'd share the timer and we will.  As we did the last one :)
---
Serenity?
---
I always love the "people" generalised term. It's such an open term that it could be everyone it could be no one or anywhere in between LOL!!!!
---
They're not missing the point, you're trying to impress your values onto the game.  EVE was here before you.  You decided you're entitled to null... because you like it? Like you said, it's a package deal and that package has changed.  You can do the activities you like, you'll just have to do them somewhere else or get used to the idea that people are going to try to kill you.  You have to accept that other people are going to try to kill you because they came to the game for the opportunity to kill people like you.
---
If someone's doing anything pve related in anything except a capital in null right now, they need to rethink their modus operandi
---
You could be saying it to inflame the person attacking you further.
---
I multibox burners and the russians in venal always accuse me of botting/input broadcasting. In turn I just agree with whatever accusation they levy at me.
---
Point is, you can’t incriminate yourself with what you say in game lmfao.
---
That one at the end did. NC HAC fleet led by their leader and they dropped dreads and a FAX. Apparently, from what I'm told the goon FC was the most junior FC in goon and he stomped the NC fleet with just feroxes.
---
Rote kapelle are the biggest pussies in eve online. All they do is fly around in kitey bullshit. They are too afraid to even brawl us in Placid. We'd push their shit in daily. I guess we were too much for them so they ran away from placid to be shit in tribute.
---
Like snuff, these guys are total bitches.
---
Bit dated but still a great read
---
There's no such thing as too much shitposting
---
Yes, sorry, I am two stupid.
---
So... basically the same as Did He Say Jump? Gotcha.
---
As someone who has never done FW, why are Ventures in FW sites bad?
---
Is this grounds for reimbursement?
---
I miss you Grath.  Please never stop.
---
Warp stab bonus
---
Back in ye olde days everyone would go about their business nearby each other and run to grab a PVP ship when hostiles showed up. 
---
Of course back then hostiles had to take gates to go places, not teleport a cloaked bomber fleet 20 jumps in an instant. And defenders had to gate a fleet to go catch them, not park a boson on a gate or teleport a bunch of instalocking supers onto the grid. It's all gone mad.
---
Don't Torps alpha harder than cruise?
---
you should feel bad
---
Jesus, you think the issue started with rorqs and skill injectors? You fucked this game up way before then with your bullshit. 
---
I do suck dicks, what is your point? 
---
I blame an alliance for causing supercap proliferation, for building top heavy fleets that wouldn’t engage without a certain win. PL was known for it, to suggest otherwise is a joke and you know it.
---
So Nidia is still a prick. I'm shocked. Shocked, I tells ya.
---
... as in NC/PL couldn't use any server tricks to tip the fight in their favor....  or casino sites... So they decided to not undock for most of the fights.  Lost 4 keepstars (That is an EvE first I believe) and a crap-ton of IHUB upgrades.  The rest got saved by the drifters and null sec blackout otherwise I think they would have set fire to the rest.  Sort of a reverse of WWB/Casino war in my opinion.
---
At least they learned to consolidate and get their industrial side in gear.  (After receiving the great Goon Titan dick shwacking)  I find it funny that nobody on that side of NC/PL thought after the WWB/Casino war "What if they did it to us?"
---
Jeffersoon
---
You can't kill them, they simply warp off, they make a lot of money defense plexingand and they can be easily botted.

#FakeNews
---
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.                   I like it!
---
blessed rise
---
everything i said was apparently wrong according to you i would assume that also applied to my statement of corps working together. kind hard to 180 from a blanket statement like that m8
---
this bad game mechanic is just loss of perfect intell in whats meant to be the most dangerous most isk rich part of eve. its not like they gave cov ops ships interdictor bubbles that also stop MJD's or some shit like that.
---
plex prices where already falling before the sale. they will rise slight after but not back to what they where pre blackout so your defs wrong there.
---
and are you really such a scrub that you cant even fathom that people are already adapting to this change.
---
and i still fail to see how you have proven im wrong. im sure you feel that way but your beliefs really don't count for much. 
---
gitgud, chin up m8 local isnt coming back to null any time soon, so either deal with it or leave. bitching about it like a spoiled child aint going to change a thing.
---
you should upvote ;)
---
Seems like a legit argument tactic. 
---
"Your wrong because you don't address the biggest thing."
---
"Well what's the biggest thing?"
---
"Well if you you knew you'd know. We're assholes here."
---
I ratted in null for the better part of 4 years and I have no fucking idea what you're bitching about.
---
When you keep saying “the most dangerous space in Eve”, I wonder if you ever heard of wormholes?
---
Ah, so who all will voluntarily do d plexing now?
---
*crickets*
---
That people blindly shriek "buff my playstyle and nerf the play style i prey on or that counters me" is not new wisdom.
---
Same thing happened to me, the dimming, not able to interact with anything but ESC menu still worked. All my other accounts were fine except my main which i had to CTRL-ALT-DEL
---
Legacy code
---
Could someone please explain me what's an "authorized capital jump" as opposed to "unauthorized capital jump"?  What does that even mean?
---
They can surely exist no problem. Try farming without a super umbrella or blue status next to any of the blocks though, 😂
---
i know right, it’s almost like we have an instance response 100% win the fight concord fleet...oh wait our response fleets are player made and can suffer losses. people call it safe space buts PLAYER MADE safety.
---
I'm assuming it means taking a jump gate with a cap and using all the LO in it forcing mr. logistics guy in the OP a fucking huge headache.
---
The day SISI was shit
---
Has she gone back to saying "I cannot set a destination to the same location twice"?
---
The point is that it's better to ask people to give you fitting advice and show you how to make a good fit than to demand people throw fits at you.
---
Thxs
---
Well, hulks and covetors are tasty snacks...  They aren't the meal though.
---
There is no reason
---
To break the umbrellas CCP will need to implement mechanics that will fracture the large blogs.
---
The amount of REEE is going to be unprecedented.
---
We love them still.
---
Hhhrrrmmmmm
---
Try battlecruisers, the myrm is an excellent solo drone boat, the brutix is a great solo blaster ship. Those two, imho, take the cake for mid cost solo fun. You're still going to die to the 8-10 person gangs, but you're going to kill more than you lose a lot of the time.
---
Also, if you like battleships, look into the typhoon. people will tell you to torpedo fit them, dont listen. Dual painter with nano and rapid heavies, enjoy your 1300 DPS, 55km range, and perfect application to cruisers!
---
Just think of all the juicy targets moving in there now that panfam will get to dunk on with their superfleets
---
Flawless o/
---
You won’t have a much chance in solo pvp with cheap ships. You’ll need t2 equipment at least in order to not be melted in a few seconds. I’ve given up on pvp until I can easily replace my ships with my own resources.
---
Warp stab bonus (stabs prevent you getting into anything smaller than a Large) and frequently not fitted. They litter every backwoods FW system. More welfare than warfare.
---
nah its true man
---
No one is talking about it because they're busy playing OtheR fucking game.
---
Fixed for free
---
Oh no I mean the one for this very thread that is now dead.
---
I would have asset safety be 1/3 taxed 1/3 drop and 1/3 can will be given back via insurace (no price however).
---
As for timers, defenders have to choose within 24hrs or timer sets to exactly 24hrs of attack.
---
Their option has to be within 48 hours of the first timer. 
---
I would also lower it to only shield and structure timer. or whatever you want to call it but essentially two attacks the initial to set the timer and the last attack to blow the structure.
---
I would also have the drifters attack low fueled structures.
---
same with botters
---
Actually, I need to disagree. Provi is amazing and we would never try to kick them out or destroy them. We poke around for a fight and sometimes they answer it and everyone is happy.
---
Remember we are 150 guys and a few girls vs Provi that is a few thousand. Waffles has been down to provi so many times that we have developed a mutual respect with many of the ppl in provi. Of course some of them hates us a lot, but thats part of the game.
---
I dont know if you saw the other day where we had a massive dread brawl with Provi. I believe they killed 100+ bil if not more, so the talk about crippled little kids dont fly.
---
that's 3 words
---
Here you think SRP is mandatory to pvp.
---
Lol
---
ur dumb and ur advice is gay
---
Where did I say that?
---
Battlecruisers could be cool.  I'll give both the myrm and the typhoon a shot later.
---
haven't you heard? They're busy collecting statistics and are watching things closely
---
&gt;we killed 4.2T up in the north.
---
Does that include schrodinger's rigs?
---
The good thing about solo pvp is, you don't have to rely on anyone but yourself. The bad thing about solo pvp is, you can't rely on anyone but yourself.
---
Or blame anyone else but you.
---
I'd strongly suggest not to go anywhere where large nullsec imperiums are, as they won't let anything disturb their daily business and usually respond with Titans to even miniscule threats.
---
Start with cheaper stuff. Frigates or navy/faction Frigates are usually good to find fights. Don't expect anyone to hop into a battleship and fight yours 1 to 1, if they don't know, what'll happen like... does he have backup? A Cyno? Bait? You EILL get "blopped" in nullsec.
---
Hop into s-sized ships and go lowsec. We have solo pvpers that'll gladly answer your challenge and send you home via the neural network, if you have an expensive POD.
---
Warzones are Gallente vs Caldari and Minmatar vs Amarr in lowsec. You don't neeydto join faction warfare. That way you'll have more targets, but less (or no) allies.
---
Your sec status might drop significantly, but that can be fixed with bribes eeerrrr I mean tags.
---
I can only disagree with half of that...
---
Please fuck off back to that shithole called Stain.
---
Thanks.
---
Yep.
---
We got a problem with it.....

Blackout makes more chances for capsuleer solo battles.
---
wormholes used to be, and they still are dangerous, but you have the ability to close connections if they're a threat, as well those connections can often come with ship size restrictions, whereas in nullsec you cant close gates, and unless you monitor them 23/7 something will get through and you can be cloaky camped without even knowing it, similar to wormholes. But every hostile can easily find you in nullsec whereas in wormholes the only hostiles that can find you have to scan your hole to do it. So I would arguably say that without local, null is more dangerous than wormholes right now.
---
Include this for overview, seriously. And add different icons for different ship types instead of every bomber or ewar frigate using the generic "frigate" icon. And then let us prioritise individual ships rather than "all frigates", "all cruisers", etc.       
---
And then make the default overview usable.

If you're richer than nidia, he'll kick you out of horde. He dislikes people with more money than himself
---
lmao, enjoy your low-hanging fruit of an upvote.
---
it's not even so much the responses, I never said null sec was perfectly safe before blackout, I simply said it was a lot safer. But a lot of that security blanket was due to the fact that you had tons of Intel, lots of notice to dock and get safe, so 90% of the time a response fleet wasnt needed. Now they are, because it is far more likely you are tackled without notice, forcing response fleets, and thus content.
---
Yeah, but what about stabs?
---
No, they're just better at identifying game-breaking meta than they used to be.

Hey, i don't disagree with you. I think the best thing that blackout has shown us is how much multibox farming fucked over our economy and devalued isk, and therefore meaning. If anyone is claiming that the mer meta is a good thing you can just point to the plex price development under blackout.
---
But what i take issue with is the tone of the post. It is a simple karma grab designed for the contra-blackout group on this subreddit. Instead of pointing out things like your post did, OP instead decided to whine about how hard everything is now that riskless krabtime is over.  
---
All that he complains about is that provi is dieing, which is not because blackout, but because of provi internal leadership.  
---
Provi was dead (compared to activity 3 years ago) long before blackout began. The fault isn't completely with their leadership, test and pl will have to shoulder some of that blame.  
---
Basically the post reeks of entitlement, and that is the wrong attitude for eve.  
---
Instead of seeing blackout as an opportunity to improve as an eve player, he chose to be a spoiled kid. That's why i am telling him to HTFU.
---
Good luck! Just keep in mind for the gal battle cruisers you really want you BC skill to at least 4. That rep bonus is what makes them so durable and dangerous. Use auxillary nano-pumps in your rig slots, try to get 2 in there. Get 2 ancillary armor repairers, make one abyssal and you can use them both together (just make one with a mutagen or w/e it's called)

Yea it's cheese as fuck but it's hilarious.

Embrace the masochism of learning solo, this isn't something mastered over a weekend. From what you are describing in your post I believe you are on the right track. You are going to lose a lot more ships so just keep it up until you start getting those "ah-ha" moments. 
---
Learning things each fight is gonna get you closer to a win.  Always keep a positive mental attitude and have fun learning. Or drink too much beer when roaming, I find that helps.

&gt;everything i said was apparently wrong according to you i would assume that also applied to my statement of corps working together. kind hard to 180 from a blanket statement like that m8
---
It's really not with you...
---
&gt;plex prices where already falling before the sale. they will rise slight after but not back to what they where pre blackout so your defs wrong there.
---
I'm definitely not.
---
&gt; and i still fail to see how you have proven im wrong. im sure you feel that way but your beliefs really don't count for much. gitgud, chin up m8 local isnt coming back to null any time soon, so either deal with it or leave. bitching about it like a spoiled child aint going to change a thing. 
---
If you fail to see it then again that's on you, you're just being willfully ignorant.  You also are failing to see the third option of logically arguing for a more balanced approach and getting that implemented.  Also I did not say reverse the local blackout, something else would need to be done.  Alot of people like the blackout and that's not something I will argue against if they like it.  But giving something to find cloaked ( even if its not the greatest tool in the world for it.) is needed to bring the balance back towards the middle.  More changes are needed in parallel with the blackout.
---
I know some guys that are real good at getting and fueling gates. Have your people talk to my people
---
*Oh wait*
---
I feel like the next step is to increase reward for living in nullsec, but only for small alliances which likely means resource starvation and making sprawling empires logistically more difficult.
---
* resource starvation to encourage spread/population cap per system
---
* increase the profitability per individual so reward in highly populated systems is about neutral or only slightly decreased but much better in areas with low population
---
* narrow the difference in anoms between 0.0 and -1.0 systems
---
* nerf projection by limiting jump bridge networks
---
Even if jump bridges were nerfed we would probably still have problems with projection.
---
This will cause a lot of REE in entities that have blues 2 regions in either direction because it should be unreasonable to move three regions over and influence a regional war. Sure you could make your members go 40 jumps each way for a fight, but they will burn out.
---
lol there you guys go, you got what ya wanted :P
---
For subcaps, yeah, I could see ns with no local is more dangerous. But when you factor in supers/titans. It’s no comparison, jspace is way more dangerous
---
Let me dictate how you should play the sandbox. Lol. OP stop sniffing your ass for a second.
---
ehhhh....it took them a while so better maybe not is the correct term...but they're trying?

Upvoting common sense would go a long way to removing this subreddits toxic affect on the game

Stabs haven't been allowed in anything below large for awhile
---
Does it still hurt to be booted from DeadCo ? :)
---
That last part was more to curb the meme that you can completely lock down a wh system and farm forever and ever.  
---
You will never catch me farming during the weekend, simply because there are still groups that rageroll, even if theres only few of them left. So the risk is always there.

Hyperion, no implants. Web grapple mjd(mwd if fighting on gates) scram cap booster. 6x neutrons or 6x ions and neut. Two mag stabs large rep a large ancillary rep two eanm(or 1 and 1 dcu) and reactive hardener. 
---
This will fight 8-10 gangs depending on their comp. Bring drop boosters and exile. Try to smash as many as you can before jumping gate to split them up etc. You will die but you will also likely kill.

Q) Am I allowed to collect donations from users of my application? 
---
A) Yes, as long as they are purely voluntary. “Donations” may not be mandatory, and you cannot require a donation to unlock premium access or special items.
---
but see to me that could work the other way too, with jspace your potential for hostile caps drops is basically nil, whereas in nullsec dread bombs and other capital fleet drops are a real threat. See the vanquisher kill last week.
---
Don't forget numbers aren't everything - you actually have to get a bloc alliance to stop krabbing, undock and take a hunting fleet out to look for smaller entities.
---
Lol, no man it's a matter of beating a dead horse.
---
Oh yea, somewhere in another comment maria pointed that out and i agree. As long as we don't get to see those raw numbers it will be hard to make and defend claims based on them.
---
Pick a ship of your choosing, head out to FW lowsec and actively look for fights in Complexes (DScan is your friend, learn how to use it). 
---
Smaller ships will have more targets to choose from, will be less likely to get blobbed/dropped and will be easier to replace.
---
Good luck mate o/

&gt;See, anyone can make pointless posts that don't contribute to the discussion.

Hey, crips can bludgeon you with their crutches when backed in a corner 😀
---
But in all seriousness, anyone can put up a decent fight. I'd just like to see you guys go up against your mirror match, that's all.
---
wait so now your ok with the blackout now and you want to nerf cloaking. WOW super big brain thinking.   
---
yeah im done here. cant argue with stupid.
---
Why can’t Did he say jump just do it themselves ? Oh wait .....
---
This is one of those responses that even you knew was just being a trash human being. Congrats on embracing toxicity.
---
Depends on the ship. But if we take something base like a Raven which gets no actual msg bonuses, I believe torps have higher dps but crusie missiles hit for a higher alpha. Can someone check this I'm on mobile.
---
This is hilarious lol.
---
True lol
---
So.. apparently Horde space is the only part of the game that isn't sitting on trillions and trillions of spare liquid ozone? Who knew... Also, that dude pinging - is he roleplaying a shithead or natural?
---
hahahaha I'm not dictating how you play it, simply saying null sec had a reputation for being safer than high sec, CCP just fixed that and now the krabs cry because they cant make easy isk. I'm just saying either you adapt to it and survive, or go to high sec where eve is easy again :)
---
Weapons escalation. Which leads to nuclear deference. If only we had AoE DDs again, this problem would settle itself out real quick 😀
---
Wow, such anger. Judging by your language, you would be the one who is angry.
---
The hell is an FW
---
Make your own clothes.
---
Yep. Though it’s also sad. We’ve told people over and over no jump gating caps.
---
Only to see them do it.
---
Hit a rock enough times.....it still don’t learn
---
Yes!! I mentioned this to some other players. Basically it would drive incentive for war. Players would be more willing to structure bash if 50% of the shit dropped. Basically when a structure is pending the hull timer, players should be able to choose up to 50% of the value of their assets for asset safety while the rest is locked and susceptible to dropping if the structure dies.
---
Still have to move the stuff, it's fucking huge.
---
Get more freighters.
---
This post is the one I'm sold that no matter what you do some people won't understand sarcasm.
---
Plexingrad sounds like the Stalingrad of FW
---
Not entirely sure how they would come to that conclusion. I remember spending a LOT of time and resources helping protect their space, and their assets, along with CVA and the rest of the coalition. Practically every night for those first few weeks were devoted to fighting over stuff in the area of space YF and -7- lived in.
---
What else would they have asked of us?
---
&gt;You may want to hear, I dunno, that the Bhaalgorn needs more SKINs or a new low sec gate to a null region is needed. 
---
This made me laugh
---
No, this is a bad idea. You should never have your structure exploded because you couldn't be on at that time. Defenders should always get to choose the TZ.
---
Don't worry, they'll revert the breaking change. Everything will be fine.
---
But industry teams will mysteriously be back.

I would also add that the best thing to do is hold cloak if you see something on an initial 360 scan. Then set to 5 and go through the anoms that are popular for ratting and within range. If they are not there you can quickly scan the moons if their miners.

Imagine him as one of those villain cats in cats vs dogs or esma in emperor’s new groove.

---
Can you provide any evidence they dont? Any information other then what CCP spoon feeds you? No you cant. Video game companies have been doing this for years sorry you are just finding out now.
---
Just checked, Torps have higher DPS, and volley damage with no ship bonuses.
---
They are sort of the odd man out though in terms of weapon systems.
---
This post goes to show that nostalgia warps memories and perceptions.
---
 Its like people think the "good ole days" were a thing, but they never were. We all were just newer, and as time passes we forget how bad things were while at the same time we discount the advantages we enjoy in the present.
---
The worst thing is that people then use their false perceptions of the past to suggest that people in the present do things differently...
---
CCP RISE &gt; all other CCP
---
One little detail that makes this even better is how ingenious this is.  You see 10 Machariels coming in with no support/logi you assume smartbombs.  10 Nestors, most (myself included) looked at it and thought "Ohh, RR drone boat Nestors."  Well played.
---
You could remove them from the ACL right?
---
Thanks. And now we know. Class dismissed! 😀
---
I’ll save you all some time, it says literally nothing.
---
&gt; There shouldn't be TZ tanking at all. You shouldnt be able to determine when a hostile can hit you

I don't agree with this, that would mean that structure ownership is only available to big groups with a strong presence in all TZs.

Did you steal this from /u/phil-zorg ?
---
It's mostly a meme on Nidia's part, but yes some of our cap pilots have been using the jump gates when they have been told not to. The issue isn't so much how much ozone is used but the logistics of refueling the gates.
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying too
---
Sadly, reason fails when tempers flare.
---
Well, good. I don't understand why it took so long after they put the warp stab rule in place to do this, but it's a good change.
---
They still need to have a look at the whole mechanic of dplexing though, because actually the warp stabs are a bit of a red herring. If you're even half paying attention to dscan you can be aligned out well before someone actually lands inside the plex, and warp off when they enter. And dplexing is a zero fun activity if you don't want to let people in hard-counter ships select their engagements on you - just sitting there for 15 minutes hoping no-one shows up.
---
FW systems should passively deplex, probably. Make oplexing the only thing that matters.
---
If I had to venture a guess, you did not come up with that yourself.
---
~~Legacy~~ Spaghetti code
---
I was just fucking around, but seriously speaking, if you think that's "toxic" you either have never ever seen someone actually being toxic or you are a really special snowflake.
---
Yes, the comment was stupid, no argue about it, but you should learn to not take things so seriously.
---
Ah damn and here I thought I was gona make a eve online Baltimore buddy
---
It's like we're arguing but agreeing lol. In the post here you first replied to I said "don't run them in HS". Giving them a suspect timer again is a less hard-cap way of encouraging that than outright banning them in HS, but that would work too.
---
Are you familiar with rage rolling? When they do find you. You are pretty much screwed and there is very little way to predict when they are going to roll into you. The “ just close off your holes” meme isn’t full proof.

Your bug report got picked up around 1pm yesterday and it was converted into a defect at that time, which was fixed internally today. Thanks so much for taking the time to file the report, most appreciated.
---
Yeah, cynos are a huge problem for engaging gameplay (at everything but the strategic capital fight level). Instant uncounterable escalation spoils any fight, and the prospect of it deters those fights from happening in the first place.
---
My bet is they actually forgot Lowsec existed until they heard so many people talk about it that they ran an internal investigation (logged into their own game) and found it again not so long ago.
---
Did you know DSTs can fit guns?

---
Look at literally any wormhole corp, they will keep 'eyes' i.e. a character on guard duty on any inbound connection.
---
In Eve Uni when they run incursions, they typically have a newbie as a 'picket' i.e. on guard duty on the gate for war targets coming to troll them. That person gets a share of the loot.
---
If you have 'enough to fill a fleet' i.e. at least 200 people, you really should be able to organise well enough to put a cloaky character on gates.

lol after few years CCP do something with FW :-D and yes this definitely solve FW :-D this is the main problem... are CCP devs living on another planet?
---
whats the deal with missile precision scripts? They raise explosion velocity but also explosion radius, doesn't that cancel each other out?
---
yes agreed but rolling is still an option, shutting down stargates is not
---
Most of those cases it's an alt. Someone is doing something else on their main. Though I've heard of some particularly abusive WH corps that make their new guy do all the scanning and rolling. The call it nub training or some shit, but based on my time in the military I can assure you that these cases are nothing more than someone with a small amount of authority shirking his responsibilities and offloading them to a junior. Happens all the time irl.
---
Nope. Just a Vo-Tech kid.
---
Also when someone threatens a ratter you have a cyno to bring in the cavalry. Your average dread ratter is he himself and his alts against a full Corp. you iz very dead

This just in, Nidia has enough free time to go through jump logs. Time to add more work!

The last couple times I have gotten killed it has been by a cloaky strateos. Tackle neut and start pounding you should get a few kills.
---
Which jump gates in particular give you the most problems?
---
Well judging by how many people are leaving null because of the blackout because they can't survive.....yeah people need to do stuff differently.
---
I never implied that many things were worse back then. Bookmarking gates, upgrading clones, the training skills, 24 hour skill queue, etc.
---
You read this and think this person is a prick? Says a lot about you.

Friendly reminder that dev is a large group and giving positive or negative credit to one dev is a treacherous road.
---
This change happened because:
---
* FW discussions have raised priority across design and strategy team lately and this one intersects with botting, which is a huge priority right now as you know
---
* CSM raised this issue specifically to my team
---
* I took a proposal to other designers with expertise in FW
---
* That proposal was thrown out in favor of this solution after talking with those designers (Fozzie, design director, etc)
---
* The scope was proposed to and evaluated by my team, who sign off (production and QA play a large role here)
---
* Implemented by a programmer (love of my life CCP Cognac)
---
* Tested by a QA 
---
Thanks for the thread though I do love seeing my name on reddit. See you here again tomorrow I think.
---
We agree that they are too safe for their profit margin at a base. Where we come to blows is about *how* to increase the risk. I see a mechanics level problem with the suspect timer. I'm not sure if you are aware of what I mean by that. I propose that the entire episode be thrown out into the chaos of low sec and below, encouraging players to solve the problem.
---
That being said I do acknowledge that Abyssal sites are hard from a PvE perspective. That's a totally different argument though.
---
"The first line of SKINs that changes and reacts to different ship states."
---
Anyone know what exactly this means? I'm intrigued!

Can we just all agree to move to highsec for the month December
---
Caracal navy has application bonus, put a medium warhead rigor rig, medium warhead flare rig and a missile guidance cpu with application script and it dunks frigs with hmls. 
---
This is also why dual web drakes used to be a thing. So it could actually apply it's dmg with hmls. But the drake got a resist nerf, lost a launcher, then hmls got a range nerf iirc and it stopped being used. Not to mention 2 af buffs, t3d introduced, t2 dessie buff, faction cruiser buffs, BCs in general became far to slow to deal with the speed meta as well as shit application on most medium weapons. 
---
Everyone switched to rapid light missile caracls after chessur romped around fw space for a year dunking everyones tackle. They use the same ammo as light launcher so they apply really well. But they then changed rlml's so the reload time on them is terrible. Not being able to switch dmg types quickly meant they fell out of favor for a lot of small gang guys.

---
Warping, flying, in sheild, in armor, in hull?
---
Again, context matters. There was literal evidence right there and then showing their actions were happening at the exact moment, impossible to do without input broadcasting. They then confirmed they were doing that.
---
Unless someone can pull server logs off of CCP when they see you, they don't have anything objective when they're accusing you. It's hot air, in this specific case it isn't as they've been caught red handed and make no effort to hide their actions.
---
Some others already answered too but see here https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Glassed
---
I think the idea with flying cheap stuff is that you figure out things like match ups, counters, menuvering, ammo types, kiting vs brawling. Once you get good at that (and die a whole lot) you can start flying better fits to give an edge.
---
Don't give up on pvp entirely because you will get to a point where you are too comfortable to start!

Also tested by getting shot, even into armor, but no change there. So I guess just warping. Very cool though!

---
TBH I haven't played in quite a while, even longer since I was last socially present in the alliance.  .\_.
---
And so after years of nullsec becoming the safest krab space in Eve, the hisec carebears migrate back to where they belong.
---
They aren't going to "do things differently". They aren't leaving because they can't survive (they could if they wanted to), they are leaving because its not worth it (same reason people left after the old [anom nerfs](https://reddit.com) in 2011).  I'm still in null, damn near the last organized group in our region, but that's because of stubbornness. So suggesting people do things differently is misguided.
---
Also, if you don't think your post is an example of "rose-tinted glasses" thinking, I'd suggest reading it again, a lot of that stuff didn't even really happen that way, hell a lot of the "organized" stuff wasn't even needed to after the fighter changes (one exception being Goons of Response Chimeras).
---
some years to block warp stabs and after another few years they switched from module to ship. So fast.
---
I wish Dunkdinkle had reasonable takes, as they're clearly good at writing. The girning is a right turn-off.
---
I miss when incursions came out using hurricanes and other random ships to fight sansha, kinda bums me out its down to one highsec incrusion instead of the usual three.
---
&gt; I feel like the next step is to increase reward for living in nullsec, but only for small alliances which likely means resource starvation and making sprawling empires logistically more difficult. 
---
I love this idea, it sounds great.  I don't know the details but certainly has the spirit of what I think would break up the large groups.
---
While I do agree that jump bridges are incredibly (re: too) powerful, I wonder if their appeal would diminish in tandem with the idea of resource starvation.  If a destination loses luster, so does that bridge route.  I doubt people will be willing to change their bridges that often or if they do they're also going to have people out of position due to unfamiliarity with their routes.  If it means bridge networks become more general and less tailored to servicing the region that's still good for increasing response times. 
---
I like it.
---
Won't sorting by type fix this problem anyway?
---
&gt; haven't been allowed
---
I mean in a general sense of make them not fittable to combat ships or delete them entirely.
---
How about, not in FW, you don't enter a complex.
---
He's in init, he isn't worth talking to.
---
Can you fix stabs by just deleting them entirely or by not allowing them on combat ships?
---
I'm not going to bitch about how long it took for this glaringly game breaking issue to be fixed.  I'm just happy it is.  Thanks Rise!
---
Then don't run them in high sec. Run them in null sec....
---
Go for it! Remember, if you get tackled and can't MJD out try to frag some things. :D Don't forget insurance!
---
I would totally maybe buy skins if they didn’t cost  $5-10 each, it feels a bit excessive to me.
---
On that note I’m saving isk this month to get the One Eden skins for Strat/Astero, I don’t know if that makes me a hypocrite.

AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH

I'm glad y'all got that worked out. /s

Ah but not explicit :)

They’re both true. PH management are pricks. They also have to deal with *unfathomable* retardation on a daily basis. For years on end. Which is probably why they’re pricks.
---
let the fozzie sov be timezone too.
---
 High sec mining is too safe and ganking is too hard. &lt;&gt; High sec mining is too risky and ganking is too easy.
---
Simply put that is game balance in one sense but one can say that the Procurer, Skiff and Orca are too tanky for the gankers because they have to use 7 catalysts for the Proc, 12 for the Skiff and I never bothered to count for the Orca.    So they cry hard.
---
On the other side of things, one catalyst for a coveter, or a Venture, two for a retreiver, Mackinaw and Hulk.  So too easy.
---
There is real choice here, be difficult to kill and your yield sucks.   In any case when both sets complain it is often about right...   The balance here is fine.
---
High Value ‘whaling’ is too hard. &lt;&gt; High Value ‘whaling’ is too easy.
---
I am assuming you mean freighters in hisec, but all in all bumping is just dreadful game play for the victim.   Enable a BS MWD on freighters and perhaps we can see a bit more difficulty in it for the bumper.
---
Buy t1 frigates. Thats the fastest and best pvp.
---
Short qnd cheap.
---
I got moyt fun and kills with a 10 mil merlin. And able to kill 100mil fits.
---
Thats how you leaen pvp.
---
No reason to whelp stratios or battleships if you dont have a glue what you do.. And when you start solo. Pvp you dont have a glue trust me
---
Context literally doesn't matter lol. Someone could be bsing, I will say with confidence that someones' chat logs have never been used to ban someone (unless for flaming etc)
---
Anyone who talks to their corpmates as if they're trash are pricks.
---
That's just asking for many dead caps on jumpgates.
---
😆
---
you could use Netflix or anything else to make time pass faster
---
what is NC? I don't play a lot of Eve, so I don't know.
---
I didn't make any mention of boxing or American deacon is assassins?
---
Hey that's pretty fast for CCP
---
**CCP Hilmar:** Hmm, we need to do something to get people to log in, any suggestions?
---
**CCP Falcon:** hold my beer
---
speaking hard truths won't make you popular, but ur da reel mvp of dis thread...
---
Someone should put a capital spy in Horde and just run a cap with MWD fit through the gates multiple times just to break the record
---
The point of suspect timer is to force people to do 4s and 5s in low/null/wh space or risk getting killed in high sec. Another solution would just be not allowing 4s and 5s in high sec.
---
Fact is, this game might be a sandbox, but the guiding principle of this game is and has always been risk vs reward. There should not be a high reward activity that doesn't require putting yourself at risk.
---
And t4 and t5 abyssals are high reward activities that for now at least can be done with virtually ZERO risk.
---
asking for a friend
---
You da real MVP
---
So all of eve big corps?
---
Fighter mechanics  for excavs!
---
Yep
---
God, I love Horde...
---
As much of a purist blaster Gallente pilot I am, the Brutix does rails pretty well honestly.  
---
You can get some great DPS and projection with medium rails and still be quick enough to kite at disruptor range.
---
How does [this](https://i.imgur.com/zceLJJJ.png) make you feel?
---
Being a pedantic asshat, I believe it's "hear hear." &lt;3
---
CHESTER YOU FUCKING SPERGLORD, SHOULDA DELETED YOUR ACCOUNT LONG AGO. LIKE WHEN YOU TARNISHED YOUR NAME SO BAD YOU HAD TO RETIRE YOUR MAIN SO THAT YOU COULD FEEL A TINY BIT OF MEANINGFUL EXISTENCE UNDER A GUISE THAT MAKES YOU SEEM LESS HATED. EAT A DICK, CHESTER
---
I've been okay with the blackout this whole time, you werent paying attention as I pointed out before as well.  I am all about extreme balance.  So you cant argue with yourself?  I suppose that's true for you lol.
---
Maybe, we're talking about it.
---
DAMMIT zap
---
250 mm railguns?
---
Orbiting with long range weapons with low tracking?
---
Thats not how you fly these things my friend.
---
Of you fight frigates you miss half of your dps.
---
Dont give him Bad advice
---
You're not wrong.   
---
Also high density of systems so the umbrella covers a lot of krabbing space.   
---
Horde's no longer under a dreadbomb threat from FDZ.
---
It's time to burn it all down...
---
CHESTER I WISH YOU THE BEST AT YOU DEALING WITH YOUR ISSUES AND HOPE THAT SOME DAY YOU CAN REALIZE YOU CAN BE A GOOD PERSON AND NOT DEFINE YOURSELF BASED ON SOME SHITTY VIDEOGAME.
---
FLY SAFE.
---
yea fuckin railguns on a wolf, how kuch of a retard are you.
---
Or invasion threat from anyone
---
Eve is truly a beautiful game. Recently I've been turning off my second super account and ratting on only one client just so I can turn the graphics up. I recently discovered that there is a cinematic effect when you are zoomed into a ship that is dying. Your camera automatically revolves around the target while panning out. With everything turned up you get some gorgeous explosions, which paired with the subtle radio chatter they added last sprin makes for an overall cool experience.
---
Now if CCP would just do something about the mechanics of PvE
---
So glad i got out of corps like these. Way to suck all the joy out of eve
---
Fines? Is this the joke
---
LOL
---
&gt; People are already moving more to the large alliances roqual with miner 2s and augmented still produce 60% of their old yield with a much lower investment 2.5bil versus 10bil. People are moving more into carrier ratting under the super umbrellas. Invasions, incursions, and abyssal dead space can give just as high or higher isk/hr in high sec. That is where it is going. 
---
This is a problem for CCP to solve, and they can take measures on an iterative basis.
---
Step 1: Exponential cost per system/structure/member for corps.
---
You have no idea the amount of stupid we have to deal with.
---
And we still get most of them out the Hangar doors and Shooting!
---
I mean. Give them two warning then send the awox fleet over to forcibly remove their cap. Otherwise kick them haha.
---
Except CONCORD knows who you are at all times when in highsec or lowsec, and since they're the ones putting a timer on you that doesn't really make sense.
---
I read to right about here -
---
&gt; *Botters - Many people know that the bots relied HEAVILY on intel channels* 
---
\- then realized you have absolutely no fucking idea of what you're talking about and stopped.
---
&gt;I do love seeing my name on reddit.
---
Talking about treacherous roads...
---
If 200 people in stealth bombers are camping your system you've already won by wasting 200 people's time.
---
Oh Stainguy 😆
---
&gt; Maybe, we're talking about it.
---
Please, kind sir.
---
People barely mine ice anyway. Entire regions of ice belts empty is not uncommon in null.
---
Ok, now I have something to look forward for tomorrow besides the sudden shitton of work that landed on my desk today minutes before leaving the office.
---
Gl, the record was ncpl’s super fleet migration.
---
Fuckin cute shit
---
&gt;Yeah I bet every VNI ratter had perfect attention to local for the 23h a day they were running.
---
Yeah that's why none of these mythical instawarp VNI "bots" were ever caught.
---
Oh wait they were, so either the bots are less perfect than you make out, or they weren't bots.
---
Russians aren't a race m9
---
would be cool if the Jackdaw one would change colors in each of the tactical modes.
---
red for sharpshooter, blue for speed, green for tank.
---
Ok thanks man that was a nice breath of fresh air.
---
Who shit in your bowl of sunshine?
---
Best idea in thread tbh.
---
Add massive stront requirements to structures. No stront? No asset safety for youuuuu. Oh and your single timer is 24 hours.
---
Then increase the resource requirements to make stront. And make the sources move around.
---
t2 is cheap
---
Huh this is very helpful thanks for telling me alot man!
---
Most balanced it's been in years. Thanks for noticing
---
Eh it beats corps that die in a month
---
Or maybe just make them only able to fit 1 and ships with a core strength bonus cant fir any.
---
&gt; Can you provide any evidence they dont?
---
can you provide any evidence you're not a pedophile?
---
i doubt you can.
---
so i guess you fuck kids.
---
This is how your logic works.
---
Please dont do that, it would remove another module option and a counter to certain pirate actions which is needed.
---
Noo dont do that.  I like having options.
---
Yes sure but... Its not one or the other.
---
quite literally proving my point.
---
Stahp, you're making too much sense
---
Perfection
---
The risk happens when they decloak. While they're cloaked they are completely harmless.
---
Im sure this will have a positive effect on plex warfare, i have been burnt out something awful plexing a system to 60/80% all day only to get dropped overnight by one stabby boi. 
---
The mission runners can do all the missions they want but if they want to flip the warzone they are going to have to fight for it.
---
&gt; Jesus, you think the issue started with rorqs and skill injectors?
---
&gt;I blame an alliance for causing supercap proliferation, for building top heavy fleets that wouldn’t engage without a certain win.
---
Weird, its like they built that as a direct response to a certain alliance you were once part of, and if i remember correctly, it was your also your first experience with anal rape as we bent you over and systematically fucked you.
---
Bitter cunt suits you.
---
Not sure if I've ever given less fucks in my life.
---
No stront, no fuel, no timer.
---
Universal everythere.
---
Same for nullification.
---
TLDR: CCP we need a way to have more perfect intel back because now without local  I don't know if someone is cloaked in my system. I need to be able to AFK rat and mine while I'm watching Netflix but now I'm too scared because I don't have a mindless bot intel program to tell me when it's dangerous.
---
There has been a great disturbance in the covert cyno.
---
any change when you shoot at something or kill something?
---
the description seems to imply that those might cause changes too
---
With like 1 mil members. It's probably a different player every time.
---
It is for me.
---
First Corp died when leadership went afk. Pos lost fuel and died.
---
2nd died to goons.
---
3rd went inactive 
---
4, 5, 6 all wh died
---
I wholly agree.
---
Third day in August and major stront sources in &lt;regions&gt; have dropped. Early reports suggest strontium has been found in &lt;regions elsewhere&gt;.
---
Well, some alliances better go on deployment for stront!
---
Countries fight over resources in the real world, why not implement that in Eve.
---
Someone posted about how some bots can read local still, cause the blackout is client side. 
---
But we get a hundred clueless bot posts every day.
---
Supers can't use jump gates.
---
History has proven economics limitations work extremely poorly in Eve, especially over long periods of time.
---
Also a return to the stront system wouldn’t be as good as it was for POS due to some small issues like citadels having unlimited storage space. Making it impossible to disrupt fueling like you could with a POS. 
---
Definitely room to improve citadels reinforcement mechanics but not sold of the stront idea.
---
Lmao alright buddy, calm down now
---
Yeah, but their freighters can. Why they didn’t use jf idk.
---
But escort is a duty.
---
Other then donating a keepstar it sounds like he is only making himself richer with you guys.
---
Seeing how you don't realize that the post is a joke you probably won't fit in with PH 
---
I'm sure you are fun at parties though
---
Solo is dead. People just want ganks to pad killboard.
---
Your mom.  My cereal was on the coffee table and we were doing a little fisting on the couch.  I was almost elbow deep in her ass when the Amazon delivery guy brought her new "toy", ringing the door bell.
---
I feel bad, I didn't expect him so i was startled, I jumped up and yanked out my arm like I was pull starting a chain saw....shit went everywhere.  Took her all day cleaning up so you wouldn't noticed though she still thinks theres an odd smell in the living room.
---
Anyway thats how your mom shit in my bowl of sunshine
---
&gt; If I just supported the things that helped my personal playstyle, well you’d obviously see Tech 2 Salvage Drones, bug fixes to the Industry window, ACLs for intra-character hangar use, and easier structure fueling.
---
With the exception of salvage drones, those are all quality of life improvements and should benefit players of many different play styles. 
---
Making the game less of a ball ache is always a win-win.
---
NS and Wormhole Relic Sites &amp; Incursions are probably the most common way. The hours you spend there though, you might as well take another job and buy it with IRL cash. It tends to be frustrating doing it over a long period of time.
---
It’s me. I’m friend.
---
[This](http://evedarklord.blogspot.com/2015/10/next-level-blops.html)
---
Just bad luck buddy :/ sorry to hear that.
---
There are decent corps out there tho that aren't all dictatorships like the biggies.
---
Hit me up if you fancy a change some time. Black Rebel Rifter Club is pretty fun :)
---
Will do =)
---
Damn your worse then Stalin
---
\*Officer-fit\* Tengus
---
I agree with your sentiment /s /s
---
https://www.eveonline.com/now/owning-the-abyss
---
But mineus64 is right that it's better if you try to create a fit and then ask an experienced player what to improve. btw, better use the "no question is stupid" thread for questions because if you start your own you will be downvoted to hell.
---
You mean the ones who left couldn't adapt and died? Good. I thought that was the whole point of all this.
---
Funny you should mention Stalin...you should ask your dad about our Cosplay Cuck sessions.
---
Actually they didn't, but okay.
---
I removed my ACL from my knee, which ACL are we talking about? Lol
---
I prefer caldari. Reason, the home starter system is 4 jumps out from jita. This means you can self destruct to the starter system and save a jump clone.
---
Can you imagine an abstract game where all of null and wormhole space just completely flip-flops?
---
Missiles are broken. That's new I guess.
---
Sucks you're being downvoted for actually suggesting balance.  I feel you.
---
The script increases the explosion velocity and decreases the explosion velocity. So it's all positive for your application. For the exact mechanics see https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missile_mechanics
---
Adapted to what ? Boring mindless F1 fests? Big blocs are zzzzzzzzzzzz
---
Covert shouldnt mean invincible, that's a distinctive problem.
---
(Hearts)
---
Ps
---
For those who haven’t seen [this ](http://evedarklord.blogspot.com/2014/03/carebear-to-killer.html) already
---
Maybe there was some kind of internal shakeup, judging from how much they’ve removed their heads from their butts recently.
---
Shenanigans and bad logic.
---
In all honesty, it’s easy to forget 250mm artilleries actually exist
---
Yes they can?
---
No they're not.
---
I never understood how the PANIC module was justifiable from either gameplay or a lore perspective.
---
Evil idea: if you guys plan to take it out, maybe you could introduce a Triglavian or Drifter weapon that causes anything protected by the core to spontaneously implode? Don't announce it either, leave it as a nasty surprise for the people running Rorquals to discover on their own.
---
Like for other skins, it differs. Some you can buy for PLEX. Some drop in events. Some come from login rewards. Some are extra goodies for buying a bundle for RL money.
---
what do you even mean real men there are very few people who I would consider hardcore risking everything they own on the slimmest of margins most people player smarter or safer. The only real men I could even think you are talking about is people with so much isk they don't even care.
---
Why would you be such a asshole when I asked a sample question?~
---
No, a ship that is cloaked cannot harm you. They have to decloak first.
---
i’ll have to repost when account is 2 days old it says
---
That looks pretty boss.
---
&gt;no hyperspacials
---
this should say enough tbh
---
Which is a thing someone who has no ability to understand what is actually happening for miners would say, and thus be popular on Reddit. But then if a thought of wisdom was something possible, you would know all the "safe" talk was bullshit to push an agenda in the first place.
---
You say elsewhere you can get 40+ kills in a single roam without a loss. A child would think he's got shit. An adult would say " there is something wrong here."
---
yep I am on board with that, it's hilarious how many times I've seen guys out in a VNI 15 jumps from a staging screaming because response fleets didn't come save them haha. I think that many alliances in EVE stretch themselves a bit too far just to say "hey we own X systems"
---
ah fuck post the new link in comment so i can revote/recomment
---
(or I can post it for you)
---
... wait are you actually serious? ... *gasp*
---
A lot of null bears had gotten used to their safe space but null should never be safer than high sec.
---
Now they're all upset about it. The salt is non stop. Some have adapted already, such as goons. The rest should do the same or go back to high sec. Or quit playing eve- we need pvpers more than ratters.
---
i need the karma for this new account, after the 2 days i’ll post
---
to be fair it does help when they are
---
rip
---
Missiles are crazy overpowered
---
Small auto cannons with 300k ehp and mjd. The future is now
---
True. Ships with covert cloaks cannot killed. 
---
You raise a valid point.
---
Good luck
---
So the cloaking gives them the ability to position with impunity to attack which is harmful...so I'm correct and that decades long argument about a cloaked ship not being able to harm you is bullshit and I reject it entirely.
---
No, people still don't care.
---
Speaking of which, I need more grapefruit......
---
You're clearly deluding yourself if you think it was Rorqs and injectors that caused it. 
---
Please remind me what alliance it was, that I was part of? Clearly another one of PL's attacking things with overwhelming force and not risking a loss. What a surprise. 
---
I've not seen so much anger from a poster on /r/Eve in a very long time. You need a timeout or at least check your blood pressure. Chill with the hate, it really doesn't help.
---
Reject it. You’re still wrong.
---
...you do realize the page that asks you to decide tells you literally everything important about them right?
---
Copying the same model with 2-3 years delay. Did it take them that long to figure out how to form the perfect cancer?
---
No im not, you are.
---
&gt; You're clearly deluding yourself if you think it was Rorqs and injectors that caused it. 
---
yea bud, its not like titans and supers quintupled over night right after the rorq changes.
---
&gt; The less I get into PvP, the better for me.
---
Then just don't play EVE.
---
Why wouldn't I be?
---
Bandaid type of fix.
---
It says combat ships... combat ship should not have a get out of jail free card.
---
Hop in a frigate, start in factional warfare space. Explore the specific fits. Preferable Amarr-Min space, because Black Ruse which used to be the beat is now dead. Once you get the hang of it, try nullsec.
---
It's not like there was already an issue that was simply exacerbated by said changes eh?
---
&gt; Please remind me what alliance it was
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I'm happy that blackout is proving to be a positive experience for you.
---
However if Nullsec had a reputation for being safer than high sec, isn't the real problem that needed to be solved: to make high sec less dangerous than nullsec? Or looking at the reasons why HighSec with its fast concord response was more dangerous than the lawless outskirts of space where there is almost 0 penalty for agressing someone?
---
The blackout has definitely increased the danger/risk of living in nullsec, but then they didn't adjust the rewards to match which might have softened the blow somewhat. And I'd say that HiSec probably isn't any safer than it was before.
---
It doesn't matter, they  will just cancel the war if it goes into hull and start them up again after its repaired.
---
Just ignore those whining wankers that have no clue what it takes to run a website.
---
Keep the good work going and thanks!
---
Yesssss!!!!
---
I hit 10b in my second month... but i buy plex
---
Post proof of a cloaked ship killing another ship and I’ll send you all of my assets.
---
I include a cloaked ship decloaking to attack being a cloaked ship killing another ship, you should send those over now.
---
tbf, I thought this person was a prick before reading that, too.
---
Oh so you agree it has to be decloaked, got it:
---
Retard
---
Yes
---
“Due to Concord’s crippling bureaucracy, all things coming out of Abyssal deadspace must be flagged as suspect, even if it’s obviously harmless.”
---
I think that would work as an alternative lore explaination.
---
Oh so you agree that that is part of the cloaked ship killing people?  Got it.
---
See I can be a dickbag too?
---
Yes but the reason nullsec was safer than high sec was because of the local chat, which led to intel channels, near2 and other programs, and a blue donut of comfort because with those things in place, you were able to spot danger coming (for the most part, not always, but generally it was VERY safe) and the people who lived in nullsec always recruited high/low sec pve pilots saying they could make null sec money and be safer than high sec. I think the rewards in nullsec are perfectly fine, ratting anoms pay well, null sec ores readily abundant meaning lots of isk to be made. But now you run a much higher risk of dying thanks to blackout. Maybe you see the nullsec rewards as needing to be increased because they've been in the same spot for so long, but I see the nullsec rewards as already adequate, people just got used to those higher level rewards being so easily obtained that now they think they should go up.
---
Nah you’re just an idiot.
---
No that would be you, though in this case you're just being willfully dumb to support the cloaky playstyle, just like everytime this bad argument comes about.
---
The new direction CCP is going with skins is interesting, from the abyss gila ones with all the glory effects to these.
---
I just hope they don't become too cartoon-like.
---
Of course I understand what is happening for miners, miners had months and months and months of excavator mining with local, intel, and third party programs that allowed them to see shit coming and safe up or get friendlies formed up and even on grid ahead of time. So yeah, relatively speaking it was safe, unless you had a dread bomb on standby, the chances of killing a rorqual in a place like Delve or Esoteria was highly unlikely with their ability to see hunters in local and get defense formed.
---
And I didn't EVER say I can get 40 kills in a single roam without a loss. I said I have no problem putting 40 killmails on zkill, I never said I don't lose ships in between them, I lose 5 to 10 ships a day on average. All I was saying is that it's completely possible to find good content post blackout, I think it even enhanced the amount to be found out there.
---
The guy tried to suicide gank my nestor with a tristan after too
---
They have a natural bonus to warp core strength.  As a result, a warp core disrupter isn’t enough to tackle one.  This usually results in the ship easily warping off, the moment someone else enters the site.  The FW community holds a position that once you’re in a site, you should be reasonably committed to the idea that you might have to fight someone.  Ventures are used, almost exclusively, to avoid fights and farm LP.
---
ok this guy is officially retarded lmfaoo
---
Indeed, very funny, what alliance?
---
Why are people so desperate to turn structures into loot pinatas? I would perfer a system that destroys the assets, that way you can effectively remove martial strength from an enemy faction that tries to just dock up and deny content. I don't need to nor do I want to make money off the ordeal. I mean, if you crack a Keepstar and Titans start pouring out, how would you even go about dividing it up? Based on my experience in a small alliance, your leadership would seize the assets to "help fund the SRP" and next thing you know all director level members are sitting in shiny new supercaps. Better to watch it burn.
---
Try again: https://reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c594h9/northern_war_ii_update_the_structures_butchers/
---
How the fuck did it take so long lol
---
Well sure, it's generally an alt, but plenty of nullsec players have multiboxing alts you can use for that.
---
You'd think that, definitely plenty of repeat offenders
---
But they'll whine anyway.
---
&gt;Easy, one sided fights are only allowed when I'm on the winning side!
---
https://reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c594h9/northern_war_ii_update_the_structures_butchers/
---
I heard there will be TWO more gates to null.  But none of them will be to Stain.
---
While you are 100% correct, the problem at the conceptual level is shifting through the legitimate cases of being within a given time zone and the cases where someone has just geared their timers outside of an attacker's TZ. That is where the frustration lies.
---
and yet, you gave enough fks to post here.  Thank you for you contribution.
---
Because the small gangs are the minority on here. Just a consequence of the eve population mostly living in big blocks
---
I could see that getting old after a while. Thanks for sharing!

It’s easy to detect people doing this from corp taxes

Whens a new SISI mirror coming?

Thanks, and same to you... we all know we need it.

Well you clearly can’t read my friend ;) I actually suggested intel to be delayed to avoid knowing without putting effort . It is good to read before you talk!
---
lol https://i.imgur.com/isIBEqo.png
---
You're literally gatekeeping being a wanker
---
I think CCP should stop a cloak and a cyno from being able to fit on the same ship. 
---
That'd be hilarious.
---
T2 missile launchers are fucked due to a bug and next month Ventures won't be allowed in FW plexes.
---
... why won’t people just find a ship with 4 low slots fill them with warp stabs? That’s more likely to survive isn’t it?
---
Noone can see reds in local. NRDS or not. It's same for everyone.
---
That will make recon ships useless I like that gameplay just have to make it more attention intense so you don’t drift off you have to be present
---
i mean when its clear the rules cant be enforced its usually the rules that are poorly thought out.                       
---
Why not just ESI everyone and charge 2m/ cap jump or something similar and pay people to fuel them, its shit work when you do it for free, when it pays in line with ratting or mining there will be plenty willing.
---
Horde is best corp, i can't wait to get back into the game properly and fly with them again. Soooo much fun 😁
---
People here are so against AFK activity, apart from AFK cloaky camping. Why is this?
---
I think wormholes are too easy by letting groups set up fortresses. POSes were ok for J space although I would have preferred a limit to medium sized at most. Citadel spam is cancerous in J space.
---
But I doubt CCP would make any changes and most wormholes are basically serfs who cry when their PVE content is touched.
---
I got sun burn. I'm staying inside now to play Eve. Lesson learned...
---
The problem with cases of "of course" and "obviously" is that you can't base an argument on assumptions. For example: the average air-sucking-waste-of-a-perfectly-good-cumstain that flies around New Eden is fairly inept at PvP, myself included. People are going to make mistakes. But if your strategy is banking on the other side making a mistake, then in situations where they don't you are screwed. You have to assume the worst case scenario at all times: the person you are going up against is disciplined, focused and experienced. If you do not respect that possibility you are going to be the one being etched into someone else's hull. The same concept applies to assuming someone else will take care of the auxiliary responsibilities. I have my own fax alts as a testimony to the fact that I support my faction's umbrella. The morons that don't are only bringing us down, and the ones that outright refuse are noted and ignored if dropped upon.
---
Coming round circle (I think?), you cannot expect that newbro on his first account with just a subcap to rat in to also provide his own alt for scouting purposes. He isn't that invested into Eve yet, and telling him he has to get on that level or GTFO is a surefire way to strangle out any new players from Eve Online. I don't hate the blackout, but we seriously need new mechanics that help incentivizes and enable veteran players to hunt hunters in their space.
---
It's difficult to learn solo PvP. People often recommend frigs first because they are cheap and help you to get used to the PvP shakes and make better decisions. Once you've lost the frigs and learned a bunch you can roam in anything you want.
---
Bear in mind solo PvP is not really about the skills or the ship. It's about the ability to get the right fight. It's an art that's very difficult to master because there are so many factors.
---
Northern coalition?  Probably.
---
It'd make recons able to scout an area, just not cyno in half the active playerbase too. 
---
But yeah I agree cloaking needs to be active rather than an AFK activity.

What you did is terrible.

I'm so proud of you, you bring tears to my eyes.

This is now a calf posting thread. Everyone post your calves.

The drones are not and all it takes is a few bombers.
---
HiSec also has local, and corps/alliances have made and can run intel channels as well.
---
Although I have an old (single-named) pilot I haven't played much eve over the years so my experience and expertise is quite low.
---
My opinion as to why HiSec might have been perceived as being more dangerous than null sec would be because everyone and their dog could easily create multiple alpha accounts for the specific purpose of ganking/ruining someone's day without any real penalty to the main pilot/accounts within HiSec. To me that's a problem of CCPs own making.
---
(Time to get out a small violin 🎻)
---
For the record I'm one of these CareBears that came to null (providence), nobody recruited me on any promises of massive isk/rewards, I came out here and got a feel for it and asked to join Cogg.  The increased risk of nullsec was something I considered, I've lost a lot of stuff since coming out here probably lost more stuff in the last few months than the last few years previously combined so I'd attest that null is/was always more dangerous than high sec.
---
I've voted with my wallet on this one, I've cancelled my renewal, I suspect I will get very bored when I can't fly my cov ops around whilst cloaked or use T2 drones or T2 mining barges, or use T2 weapons, or fly my bustard/crane around. It's at that point Ill either crack and resub or just stop playing. I don't know which way it'll go at this point. I've already started playing more planetside2 on my main pc, might jump back in to battlerite on my laptop at some point, which is a bit ironic because these games are PvP games, I just prefer to pewpew rats and mine asteroids in eve.
---
And it’s not like Nidia suffers fools gladly.
---
Lol, thanks man. I could have looked it up, just thought the answers from you all would be more entertaining.
---
They invented the guillotine
---
And this is a problem because?
---
Bit of both, actually.
---
Just change reinforcement mechanics to what is currently used for wormholes. 48 hours for fueled structures, 12 hours for low power ones. Going back to stront is also stupid. Defenders should be able to pick their reinforcement time and day since it’s their shit on the line.
---
In Gangs (Wolfpack Bombers for example) Target Painters grant more boni because they stack but if you're ratting or looking for smallscale PvP then take Missile Guidance Computer, they're more versetile anyways.
---
I'd be excited if the prices weren't so offensive.
---
Cancerously overpriced and known to be stupidly bling-fitted so you get headshoted quite often in PvP.
---
buy whatever you can afford and fly straight to player owned nullsec
---
They’re all carebears and give free kills.
---
If for some reason you fail post here and beg for whatever killed you or stopped you from getting kills to get nerfed 
---
You will get many upvotes i promise
---
You can look into your brackets if you changed some colors.
---
There are lots of people who come to null to fight because of the blackout. They aren't all that rich. You see, that's not how pvpers (real men) think :P

Nobody is saying that this was the main problem or that it will fix fw

"Moon Mining POS removal nerfed PvP funding. "  
---
bring back automated moon mining &lt;3 (and make them vulnérable AF soo big bloc can't own them unless if they spread)
---
Which pirate actions are those? I'm interested in how pirates would use WCS. If you don't want to share on a public forum feel free to DM me.
---
sorry where cloaks not in the game before the blackout? and why are they a problem now?  
---
\*popcorn\*
---
LOL good one. Sweating their ass off. More like "We'll fix it eventually".
---
&gt; LIKE WHEN YOU TARNISHED YOUR NAME SO BAD YOU HAD TO RETIRE YOUR MAIN SO THAT YOU COULD FEEL A TINY BIT OF MEANINGFUL EXISTENCE UNDER A GUISE THAT MAKES YOU SEEM LESS HATED.
---
I deleted my main because I legitimately quit.  Derek convinced me to come back as an advisor thus the alt.  Then bewalk got banned and I couldn't get the SP back onto chester so I ran with it.
---
Just fyi, it had nothing to do with my reputation, i'm one of the most hated people in wormhole space. Do you really think I was deluded enough to think that a simple name change would fix that? Come on.
---
Also, I've ran multiple successful and large corporations in my history... maybe one day you can run a single one.  Cheers.
---
No PvP expert - but I did learn to suck ALOT less this way (and this same method is often recommended);
---
I would suggest cheap, 6-15M ISK frigates to start. Try novice complexes in Faction Warfare space. Check Dotlan for kills per hour and try some of the slower, but still moderately active systems (DON'T go to Tama). You'll get blobbed often regardless of where you go, but you'll get some 1v1's as well. You will take a minor security status hit when you fight. Don't worry in the short-term.
---
Here's THE guide on Eve frigates;
---
 [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w\_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view) 
---
Watch a few Lasker Emanual PvP videos (or others). Learn how to sift through  [https://zkillboard.com/](https://zkillboard.com/) to check for fits.
---
Try a T1 frigate of you choice. Equip it with highest meta / T2 modules you can and those proper for how you want to fly it (e.g., brawl). Find a novice and get ready (or drop in on someone else). Hit D-scan often. Run from faction or pirate frigates (or not - you will still learn a little getting trashed by them). Tell 'em 'gf' in local, even if it wasn't.
---
Record/review your fights if you can - helps.
---
And here's the key - if you have a *specific* question on how/why you just lost, start a convo and ask that pilot you just fought. Be nice. Keep it quick. Be nice. They might not answer; They might offer up some very good pointers/help; Or they might tell you to f/o. Regardless, be nice.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Good luck.
---
A ton of Breachers and faction war. When you blow them all up, then move to some faction frigates... like the Firetail.
---
&gt;your attitude appears to be that you're entitled to easy null sec PVE.
---
No, again missed my point completely. Null sec PVE should still be *FUN*, not easy. The new/current game mechanics are *NOT FUN*. A "robust intel network" doesn't change the need to perform these antifun mechanics now with blackout, whereas before with local, it did.
---
THANK YOU FOR BEING A REASONABLE PERSON JONN, DESPITE OUR FIGHTS AND SNIPS, I ALWAYS RESPECTED YOU AS A HUMAN BEING.
---
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DONT REALIZE THAT I DON'T BEHAVE LIKE I DO ON EVE IN REAL LIFE, AND THAT IM TRYING TO PLAY A ROLE ON THIS GAME THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN REAL LIFE.
---
I DON'T DEFINE MYSELF BASED ON A SHITTY VIDEOGAME, THIS IS JUST FUN AND ANYONE WHO TAKES IT INTO RL IS A FUCKING FAGGOT.
---
FYI: IM NOT QUITTING THE GAME, JUST PURGING MY SOCIAL MEDIA FOR A REASON (nothing scary like violence etc, no one report me to fbi etc)
---
Let me get back to you tomorrow, will try to find out!
---
Gate camping mostly is what I was thinking.  More of a counter to that, but as a pirate ive also seen anom baiters use them if they deam what they have baited in to be too risky and gtfo.  Also had a guy use it against me with a warp core stabbed covetor (guy was suspect) that scrammed me and he had either a buddy or an alt come in on me in an ancillary shield boosted myrm to wreck my day while the covetor just moonwalked out heh. (clever bastard he was.)
---
Yes pls
---
Problems with them before and after.  Your popcorn is burnt btw.
---
There needs to be fuel usage to post all these bad ideas about cloaking.
---
fuck you.
---
Artillery and railguns can still be used to good effect and apply well, if you manage transversal. Missiles can't.
---
one of my propaganda ministers at great work.
---
SUAD is that you?
---
Panfam just did what they already had to do 2 years ago, which is consolidating.
---
Huh your just being a Asshole for fun I see.
---
Carriers use Fighters nowadays, they need to be actively controlled by you and you kinda need to look into Fighter control by yourself, set up some keybinds etc. to handle them properly in PvP as well as piloting your Carrier and using its modules at the same time.
---
Usually in PvP most people use T1 Fighters because loosing a squad of T2s is fcking expensive, \~10mil for a T2 Light Fighter so \~90mil for a full Squad, \~30mil for a T2 Heavy Fighter so \~180mil for a full Squad.
---
Compared to that T1s are cheap, only \~2mil for Lights and \~8mil for Heavys.
---
Their usefullness depends on your Carrier and your Fit. If you want to hunt for subcaps I'd advise to go for Gallente Carrier!  
---
There are different kinds of Carriers out there, we distinguish between offensive ones (Minmatar / Gallente) and defensive ones (Caldari / Amarr), they set themselfes further apart based on their tank: Shield or Armor.  
---
If you want to hunt subcaps Gallente are your best choice since you can fit lots of tracking into your midslots while still keeping decent tank.
---
With correct fitting (fulltank) Minmatar Carrier will deal allmost double the damage of Gallente ones but lack tracking to apply properly. It really depends on what you want to achieve, for PvP Minmatar Carriers are best for their Damage and Shieldtank, for PvP Gallente Carriers are better fit because of their larger Fighterbay, capstable Armortank and shittons of Tracking.
---
&gt; identifying game-breaking meta
---
Shame this is only getting attention cause of the botting aspect and not the shit gameplay aspect.
---
I'm a fan of this. Cloaks should use charges like the change to command bursts.
---
Right on brother
---
I had just been subbed for 4 years straight and took a break for the last 6 months. This change plus blackout may have me dropping you Bois some pennies soon.
---

---
"Hey Jab, how fast do you go when I web you?"
---
"I'm not shooting you!"
---
No we're not, cunt.
---
I think they would be better if they countered bubbles instead of points.  
---
Obviously, capitals should not be able to use them.
---
Pick a ship or shiptype that you enjoy, and just start taking it out. After a while you will learn the areas to go and what types of ships you can engage or not and other ways to improve. 
---
Highly recommend fw for starting, however its not for everyone so go where you enjoy. I always enjoyed flying cruisers, bc, and bs, so when I did some fw it was tougher on me to make the split second decisions you need in frigates and destroyers. But its a good way to find fights fast and not spend a ton of isk. 
---
No matter what don't get discouraged losing ships. Its how you learn and we all were there at one point.
---
Just think of the mental anguish inflicted on those poor coders trying to patch this ten year (or is it longer?) old behemoth..
---
Presses F to pay respects to programmers sanity.
---
Clearly never watched then ganking streams then? No alt tabbing involved.
---
&gt;I really just don't like the idea of active modules not having charges to them.
---
* Neuts.
---
* Smartbombs.
---
* Warp Scram/Disrupt.
---
* ECM.
---
* TP.
---
* AB/MWD.
---
* Hardeners.
---
* Armour/Shield Reps (non ancillary ones). 
---
There's *plenty* of non-charge modules.
---
In Reykjavik, the sun will not actually set until August 17th, and even then, not until between one and two in the morning.
---
That leaves a lot of time for activities, but very few opportunities to hide the bodies.
---
Not to steal Merinis' thunder, but Zulu Time is a term used in all US military branches. It's most commonly useful for pilots, sailors, and their commanders because cross-timezone operations are far more common for them, but even we simple crayon connoisseurs had to learn the concept in case we had to do any large scale combined-arms missions involving sea or air assets.
---
Sure *you* would argue that but one would hope that CCP is less retarded than you.
---
Dirt and Glitter
---
Great bunch guys and fucking hilarious comms
---
&gt; I don't know if you've noticed but capitals aren't great fast-moving roaming ships.
---
Because a proper battle is a lot harder than easy ganks. Let's do some hard to do route planning guys, open dotlan, see delta, send scout. Give me a break.
---
I d ol kill rights on an alt in jita....ill undock a t1 hauler with max ehp and some xtype/officer mods in my cargo and sell all of mine for 30m, but all of those "afk battleships" you see in highsec with super high kill rights are scams....generally anything i see with a kill right over 30m is a scam
---
What is FW? What does it stand for?
---
Grats in getting easier kills.
---
I’m glad you’re enjoying the push to capital pve under super umbrellas or die in null.  
---
You’ll change your tune soon enough when you run into things you can’t kill while not being caught.
---
I used stabs to move pvp ship through incursion in nullsec, cause frigs had points. Not a pirate action but still it had some use on pvp ship :D
---
delete this
---
Kind of an effort in futility. As I typed this I literally got a discord notification.
---
Ever think of joining a wormhole go to? There's so many different options as far as content wise. I highly suggest it
---
Aideron Robotics. Met some super cool people, and only embarrassed myself on less than 10 occasions.
---
Yep and all of them should have charges
---
Nice try goon, oh wait someone prolly told you.
---
recruiting btw.
---
how many?
---
While it’s true blackout has helped me make fuckload a more isk with less competition than before
---
You’re an utter imbecile if you think fucking over every group that isn’t on a mega alliance or cloaky hunter is a good idea.
---
You don’t like that people defend their space so you cry about “that being safe”
---
Null became safe when people like you decided cloaking and shooting mining barges was your only option in mega alliance space.  It was your choice to not try and build and escalate.  It was your choice to not try and adapt to fight elsewhere or bring something that can win vs what you KNOW is there
---
It was your choice to cry and blame “null beads” for having a strategy that best yours in a sandbox until the devs had to change the fucking game structure to hand you a participation trophy stolen from the little guys
---
Free MAAAATE with every big toe?
---
From what I know about him I fall into that catagory and he has to kicked me... Oh he saw this I'm kicked.
---
How do u fix ur security status with tags?
---
So when will cloaked guys have fear of being scanned down or caught?
---
Or did he only mean for subcap pve?
---
11 Proteus, 6 Leshaks, 2 Legions, 1 vindicator, 2 Guards
---
Yeah no one cares about the ozone loss because the caps compensate us for it anyway. It's having to actually refuel the shits that sucks.
---
Bannable
---
It stands for Faction Warfare. It's a way for people to make money by sitting semi-afk doing nothing and then running away at the first sign of any "warfare".
---
Temporary Legion was your best WH corp? Curious what the others were
---
The smaller model Ares compared to the Taranis in the ship tree makes me feel the same.
---
Doomheim 👌
---
Init. Pando was the best FC I ever flew with. Alliance fleets I've been in have been the been boring since I left.
---
So... Tldr.
---
You like that you can hunt in heavily defended space
---
You like that null is “dangerous” because you think you are important by making it so
---
You don’t give a shit about any small group affected by this because muhkillmarks
---
And best of all... you don’t even care that with the literally endless possibilities of a sandbox... You needed the devs to shatter the balance in your favor to become “dangerous”.... and you think that’s something to be proud of and gives you a right to tell others why it’s great.
---
I am a bit dumbfounded.  It almost seems like you’re joking. And that’s coming from a literal troll
---
wow to think someone is proud to be in gotb (guardians of the bots)...LOL
---
No joke, if you jump a cap through a jump gate you get fined by nidia. Unless you are specifically told to do it by someone who has the authority to piss off nidia.
---
Because you can't enter a plex (other than large) with warp stabs fitted to your ship.
---
i already have the others you mentioned :D oh man i hope the go in the shop one day :)
---
Ok gotcha perfect thanks man.
---
This fix doesn't change the commitment. I get the rage against Ventures, but there is MORE than enough time to get out from any Plex.
---
This role will now be taken up with iStabed frigates or something else similar.
---
I like d plexing more. I'm really just there for fights and it helps to not have a rat shooting at me while trying to 1v1. They don't do much damage but still.
---
Hilarious is Nidia sounds like he's 15 on comms.
---
Fucker runs a tight ship tho.
---
Not enough Thaddeus yelling over minor shit /10
---
But overall great work
---
Lemon water Grakar Lemon Water
---
Honestly at this point I just assume anyone posting with a hull pen flair is being ironic
---
Have any vods or links?
---
Seems slightly excessive
---
That’s retarded.  “I should be able to kill you easily and you should expect that”
---
No.  You should be just as vulnerable as any of the shit you hunt but the current whine fest of reddit cries holy hell if it isn’t “easy” for crybabies like you to win every fight or run from anything you don’t want to fight
---
Don’t pretend to give a shit about risk when you don’t give a damn about the power of “choice of engagement” hunters have over prey right now.
---
Yes if you make a robot it will be considered a bot.
---
If you made an artificially intelligent robot to watch the screen and physically play for you, it will be a bit.
---
Robots are bots.
---
Best you can do is MANUALLY B
---
Click Ctrl A the CTRL C then CTRL V on a Intel page
---
Has to be manual any automated is bannable by TOS if you think X or Y no bannable it's clear and percise
---
Ideally, players are required to purchase and anchor their own buttons.
---
Realistically, FW was dropped 11 years ago and has had one significant update since, plus a few nerfs to stymie abuse.
---
But odds are you won’t be using a cyno on a rookie ship with your main
---
Ventures specifically aren't the problem with this and botting. If bots are in a plex, they're gone before the +1 stab gets close to being a benefit
---
This made too much sense, can you make it a bit vaguer to understand what happened or see what was going on please?
---
Don't give up when it gets difficult. That's the joy of this game. Ask questions.
---
Wait, wait, wait... a fleet of bombers, each worth about 10 Corms, can kill a fleet of Corms!?
---
Mouth Trumpet Cavalry and NSH are both a blast. My brief time in Init was also pretty chill if you can get over leadership putting goon interests over alliance interests from time to time.
---
Thanks Goons
---
ha you reminded me of Warframe.
---
nah he's a natural. Dude has no chill.
---
You must be new here
---
oh please explain how it was broken before and after
---
and why you came into a blackout thread to bitch about it and how it has nothing to do with the blackout
---
*continues eating delicious popcorn*
---
No, because those superfleets you're talking about took loss after loss after loss to a population of the game that didn't have those fleets.
---
Just because you got your shit pushed in doesn't mean that other groups (like goons who you looked down on) didn't figure out the puzzle
---
No shit Sherlock.

&gt;Raise a village for a FW change.

Uhmm.... Okay?

I liked the guys in there expect for a few of them. I've been in most of the big name wormhole corps. I was with them when they where a 20 man c4 Corp. I just knew everyone and enjoyed it.
---
&gt; Noo dont do that. I like having options.
---
Please tell me that's sarcasm. :)
---
No, only yours.
---
I played a long time ago and I have a POS tower and some mods in assets, should I just liquidate it all? I'm basically just looking to do refining and reactions. 
---
What's different about Upwell structures?
---
The penalties for stabs need to be navigation related (either in addition to or instead of) the current penalties.
---
I'd like to see the needed align-speed raised per stab. 
---
No stabs. The current 75%.
---
1 * stab. 87.5% 
---
2 * stab. 93.5%, etc.
---
Ah didn’t know that
---
But... red is fasta?
---

---
Spoopy Newbies. I can be away from null, and away from the frankly horrific toxicity i've experienced from groups other groups that i've either reached out to, have reached out to me or i have spent time in comms with.

gibe back PODLA Drake pls
---
Love how this got down voted OwO
---
Revive the &lt;blink&gt;-tag to make sure everyone gets a joke.
---
Thank you
---
But what about built in stabs for the venture, supers, titans, etc.?
---
PL took fleet losses on super fights?! Come on, this was extremely rare and a loss or two to a massive wipe of an enemy fleet was why those ships were lost. 
---
As for goons, I’ve never looked down on them, held a lot of respect for them and what they’ve accomplished. Hey are honest with their asshatery, unlike the old PL. 
---
Also, what alliance, I’ve been in quite a few who have had their shit pushed in, or done the pushing. It’s been a long road.
---
Shift+ESC
---
The north is invested with those bots, all similar fits, all newby npc school and all fly a scripted path.
---
Warp stabs removal would be interesting. A better change would be creating a bubble to allow counter play to nullification (aka a hic script bubble that just targets nullification)
---
VoTF and EMO.
---
This is toxic AF, why is this being celebrated?
---
Well, FW meta has shifted from Ventures to LML  Jackdaws with lock range of 100km. Almost impossible to catch them if they are not falling asleep running the FW missions.

&gt;the devs had to change the fucking game structure
---
&gt;You’re an utter imbecile 
---
&gt;You don’t like that people defend their space so you cry about “that being safe”
---
At this point, are you sure I'm the one crying?
---
Yup, but with the blackout they cannot see you either because before local was gone they'd warp to the next system  if you'd had killed one. Then your name was on a avoid list and all the bots would just go to the next system continuing their scripted path. This is why I think all these bots are owned by a single RMT'er. around 50 to a 100 bots. All Asteros. 
---
But now with the blackout they cannot see you and all you have to do is cloak up near a Ruin in the relic site and wait for the bot to come and you just snag him. they are good loot pinatas with +300 mil in each ship. They go through certain systems multiple times a day.
---
&gt; Lots of small alliances deliberately taking unwanted sov and having fun fighting one another
---
It's not unwanted. NCdot didn't leave voluntarily. And nobody would move in if it was unwanted. Also those little alliances will not keep it long. It's only a matter of time until someone blobs all others out. It's how nullsec works since 2003.
---
join Pandemic Horde. It's the best new-bro experience available in EVE Online right now.
---
&gt; step one of installing any software for me is scanning it with my antivirus. 
---
yeah but assuming a very recent malware is not bypassing your antivirus is a bad assumption, so bad advice. It's easier than you think. Do not run untrusted shit *at all*
---
It depends. If you have a solid Corp they will help you out with tips and support. Some corps have programs for handout ships etc so you can pvp. Some corps do PI handouts and blueprint copy handouts so you can start industry. Null isnt all about ratting. HMU if you have any questions. Idk who you are with but if you aren't having fun it may be time to try something new. It's not about isk per hour. It's about fun per hour.

because people are desperate to find an incentive to actually deal with structures. Can't blame them, i sure as hell am.

if anything is important to that point they'll just jump off before its destroyed, really isn't hard
