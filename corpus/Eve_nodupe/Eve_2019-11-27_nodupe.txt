They should! I did the Eve Forum one, lots people for real nice stuff... I got some guys hanger trash üòï
---
---
---
wouldnt that be fun tho, a ship that makes capitals obsolete that cannot hit subcaps.
---
I‚Äôm just surprised CCP still has people that talk to us
---
It's really more like 1.5b with implants. [This](https://zkillboard.com/related/32000025/201905281200/) is where I was at the last time I was running them. But I added Navigation 3% &amp; Neurotoxin Recovery 3% to the pod. I always run with standard drop active and a cheap speed drug.
---

---
That was my absolute cheapest fit after a lot of T5's and cutting numbers because I made up for it with experience. I died there because of a disconnect, but otherwise I have 500+ successful runs with this ship.
---
You can't allow the user options to pick how they want their user experience to be!!!  That's some kind of madness!
---
https://youtu.be/q4EEgEm_q6s?t=1515
---
Yeah sure it's above
---
Regarding complexity, I think we disagree about what "punish" means. I would say that EVE is a hard game, and that its complexity (as well as its breadth) are the two main drivers of its "hard"ness. But "hard" and "punishing" are different ideas in my mind. And I value the hard-ness of EVE. It gives me challenges to figure out, and makes the goals I set out to achieve more meaningful.
---
Regarding your second point, I have to disagree. For comparison, everyone needs to be able to fly a travel-ceptor. But I don't think either of us is arguing that frigate V and the interceptors skill should be in a new pilot's starting skills, nor that these skills should go away. What's different with the magic 14? (I'll further note that, for a newbie, I don't think that they actually need all of the magic 14. For example, it includes both armor and shield tanking skills, and a newbie could quite reasonably choose to specialize in one type of tank for quite some time.)
---
This is a great video. Thanks for putting it together. 
---
I was trying to work through warp speed/acceleration math yesterday myself.  I'm interested in weighing agility against warp speed to see where I can make improvements in my roaming fits.
---
God wills it!
---
I would love a non-pulsing, solid color module activation ring.  Or at least stop it from going fully transparent while pulsing.
---
Yep.
---
Drifter?
---
Thanks for posting that stuff for me ‚ô•
---
Since i cant keep note while talking id have to relisten to the entire episode to make notes and stuff :x
---
I always appreciate a compliment. :) Very happy I got to see you in vegas, although I don't remember specifically talking to a CCP-Convict. I'm sure it was pretty awesome as I'm generally very jolly in Vegas. Hope to see you again next time we do Vegas, or I suppose worst case in San Diego if I decide to go there. ;)

Thank you for your service

Best part about eve is you don‚Äôt need to play like wow just play when you got some time and you will never get behind
---
A lesser known game mechanic in eve is when you have a cyno fitted, self destruct your ship
---
 reminds me of my Loot Fairy experience [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78425438/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78425438/)
---
Flair checks out. :P
---
Okay so, we are talking about the counterplay to ninja looting in trig sites. Whereas established in your last comment the counter play is to "tether up", i.e. not run trig sites. There basically is 2 options if you are being ninja salvaged. Let them salvage or don't run trig sites. How is that not a binary?
---
Wormholes...  if you plan on paying for everything with plex, then sure this might be a thing since pvp is easier in the sense of no local.  But if pve grinding for your isk is your thing then wormholes are trash.

rlml boats (nosprey, cerb, orthrus)

&amp;#x200B;
---
That said medium acs might become somewhat workable again. Dualprop armour cynabal is already ok, now it might even be competitive. Ac cane is cheap and welpable, this is a straight buff for it. Ac sleipnir might come back to popularity. Dualprop stabbers are always fun. Even the lowsec brick brawl rupture might get used again once in awhile.
---
Ultimately I don't think the buff is enough. Which is a shame because I highly doubt they will be touched again any time soon.
---
Create a new root folder and move BMs there.
---
Here is with a single "Open Location Menu" key + Right click: https://monosnap.com/file/gARuLjjSd62Ds3KOYlPEDKoQFQSeKz
---
You need to set window mode  as active and then log back out. On relog the problem should be fixed. I do this every time I plan to play on multiple characters. 
---
NOTE: when I try to window mode directly on my iMac my mouse flickers and I cannot see where I am clicking so I use window mode on a second 4K monitor with no problem. No idea why, I have yet to find a solution for it.
---
&gt;Now people are bitching about how if you have an ungodly amount of bookmarks in the same system it intelligently makes it easier to parse (even if it requires a couple extra menus).
---
The menu is nearly ***identical*** to what we had before once you get past the nested menus.  The only difference to parsing it is that CorpBMs are not mixed in with PersonalBMs anymore.
---
probably diamond rats
---
proposed solution. the ability to have bookmarks at the first right click menu, like the really important ones, with the ability to have nested groups of bookmarks as well for all the rest? win/win
---
I think you mean 50/50. They either drop or they don't.
---
Why can I only add one ACL per folder??????  That is quite a few steps backwards imo.
---
I've run out.
---
Have you tried anything?
---
Kill the process from task manager, reboot, anything before blaming it on CCP?
---
Time for some sooth sayer fix,  that's some good stuff.
---
No idea since I didn't really tinker with the other races.
---
There wasn't a whole lot of stuff to choose from though. Just the vests (which I used), a zipper jacket and some sweaters and stuff. I saw there was an in-game store though that had some extra options for clothing or something, but I dunno if that stuff really matters since you just see the ship anyways.
---
Don't even know what a fedo is. 
---
The first thing I'm thinking of is a fedora, which wouldn't be an altogether bad look for my character.
---
Pyfa has ingame stats of it. No idea what "placeholder" means in this context.
---
I played on single account for like 2 years already and I managed to have a lot of fun doing small gangs and solo hunting and also farming iskies with my super (so far ..like 70B) :)))
---
&gt;Assign the new shortcut we've added for this
---
suggestion: Can we also choose for this to be the default behaviour and the shortcut shows the full (current) menu?
---
/u/-TempestofChaos-  is a shame to all /r/Eve .  He submitted a shitpost.  SHAME!
---
Yeah, but the chance for *none* of them to drop is 0.5^8 = 1/256
---
I assume legacy code makes it impossible, but being able to toggle folders to have all child bookmarks appear on your overview would be really amazing! There's already a similar feature to make folders appear in space, right?
---
&gt; December will mark 5 years of service in Thera. 
---
How can it be 5 years already? I've been playing this game too long... Thera still seems new to me.
---
Wearing a Fedo like a Fedora would be bad, very bad.
---
So basically, WANGS got blobbed by ships that were too small and fast for them to either apply damage to or escape from.
---
Dont see anything wrong. No bugs there
---
SHC was a dedicated eve forum setup to allow free discussion of eve mechanics (as Ccp used to be quite free with banning people from heated debate on the official forums). It was initially setup by a player named calmdown and was rapidly adopted by a lot of small gang and solo players. It became quite a ‚Äúclose‚Äù community, it was fierce and rough at times but generally it was a pretty supportive place.
---
There was a nested set of forums to discuss ship fits and discussion was heated but often very good, as many of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù players of the time were members. A fit would be posted and discussed in a thread. The best fits would then make it into a list of suggested fittings. There were also forum areas dedicated to discussing piloting.
---
It all coincided with a time when minmatar ships were in a pretty bad place. A number of later small buffs to the ships and the incessant theory crafting of shc led to minmatar ships becoming pretty effective.
---
You could log on, read two small gang fcs discussing a fight they had, catch up on a vagabond fitting thread in which people would be discussing (with worked maths),  the benefits of nanofibre over overdrive injectors, Discuss the correct and safest way to shave ones hairy bits. Offer some words of encouragement to someone who was having a crap time in their love life and then smack talk the same bloke in the battle reports areas. 
---
Syndicate was a hot bed of small gang pvp back then and a number of its corps used to recruit on SHC,
---
Why do you convict him to a world that lacks something as basic as lowsec gate to Stain?

Honestly not too hard, there's a 2 minute timer before the dread sieges so you try to burn it down quickly

Aside from boosher how are you any different? 
---
Go poke Inner Hell lmao.
---
A thread full of heresy
---
Cant anchor bubbles thera side :(
---
Nothing a broadsword cant fix tho :)
---
Couldn't you use those mostly-useless autotargeting missiles when facing those damps?
---
so you can only have 5 folders so what i did was have one small for all undock/docks that way if there is only 8 or less bm in one system, in any of the main folders they will list (like the undocks and safe in my pic 
---
then you just have to try to sort them out the same way in the rest of the folders placeing some in one of the 5 main folders and the rest in sub folders 
---
https://i.imgur.com/7qT5Ji5.png is how its all looks for me right now
---
insta/and all the safes shows up in the first lvl of the new right clickdropdown if there are less then 8 in system 
---
but i might move out wh from a sub folder to the spot folder so they show up in all wh's except thera were i have alot of stops saved so i can pre warp the 200 au as i scan new holdes
---
will take some time to get it right
---
Yeah.... no.
---
Ignoring the hilarity of "release it broken itll be fixed before people have them".
---
People can see the stats and make choices around those stats before they've been built. There were questions around the DPS when it was datamined, there were questions around the DPS when it hit SiSi, and when it hit TQ it was "oh, I guess it really does have those stats".
---
To then be "oh nah we actually fucked up again and released placeholder stats".
---
This would probably cause all of null to unsub.
---
Again.
---
And that's without abstracting away this specific scenario and just looking at the fact that CCP messed up a release, again.
---
Capsule ejected...
---
I was already looking forward to higher unspooled alpha than capital artys with twice the tracking of capital autocannons..
---
Seriously though, I'll have to look at the numbers but that almost seems like too much of a nerf, damn
---
It's probably fine once it's spooled up though
---
I've never extracted my main character. I am a very aggressive PVPer though that solo roams in nullsec constantly so I usually don't have implants so may have missed about 50mil SP or so.
---
Having a friend with a command destroyer is a very elegant solution.
---
Drawback: Playing with a friend makes the game more enjoyable and you have have less time to post stupid ideas on reddit.
---
Damn, so basically it's pretty useless now? 22k with a HG pod - so what, like 15k dps with a normal dreadbomb pod? So basically you can spool up to nag dps, epic.
---
I'm a 2003 player - running might seem like a good solution to you but I don't see it as a solution to balancing brawling ships vs kiting ships.
---
the difference between a condor hard tackling and a jag hard tackling is that the jag will not die within 20 seconds to light drones or 2 grazing hits or pretty much anything that manages to put any amount of dps on it
---
Had a powerful and dreadful weapon.
---
CCP: Let us turn that into a wet noodle for you
---
If blaster boats are in a bad place than obviously AC boats are as well. And pulse brawlers too? 
---
Or just accept that it isnt 2010 anymore and you cant fly brawling BS/BC without getting turboblobbed.
---
Fast short ranged ships are fine, kill the tackle before the blob lands. Being closer than 150km to the blob helps as well.
---
Anyone know if this is a bug or just asshole design?
---
Every "redeem item" event we've had so far let us claim omega rewards after upgrading but this one doesn't.
---
So...adding another module that only fits to specific ship types is a more elegant solution than using an already existing module that can technically be fit by almost every ship in the game? Where's the logic in that? Is combat-scanning too hard/bothersome since you want to implement a 'select target and activate'-module to do the work for you?
---
Damage modifier 2.55 -&gt; 1.00, doesn't that mean they removed spool function?
---
Log all the way out and back in and try it
---
Damage modifier is a just a flat multiplier on the damage the ammo deals, ie if ammo shows 1000 em damage per shot it will do 2550 em damage per shot with 2.55 modifier. Most turret weapons have this.
---
I mean missing things skill wise. Surely it's basically all the mining and manufacturing/indy skills.
---
No
---
Its ok they can have another go in tomorrows patch :D
---
It's not economy. It's personal income.
---
If you need x isk, you gotta do that activity until you have x isk.
---
I've been saying since years that Skynet sta
---
Thats how it was before TE nerf and has been since ac's have been around. If you kite, use TE's to get range for ac's. If you brawl, you don't use TE's and lose range. Are you asking if autocannons should hit out to 50km without using TE's? Even scorch ships need optimal rigs to reach that.
---
Ac's and minmatar ships were designed around TE's (Flexibility comes from their ability to change with modules/ammo, not just a flat they can do whatever anytime with no sacrifice). Until TE's are fixed, autocannon balance is always going to be a mess.
---
Space Quicken.
---
Honestly?  This was a chance to make it more unique, linking the spool to the siege timer instead of firing the guns.  They could have made a not-too-overpowered dread that spools to full in 5 minutes as long as it doesn't desiege; to balance it could start at like 50% normal dread DPS, and cap at double.  With the pricetag on an inherently suicidal ship I think this would be relatively balanced, or could easily be so with some numbers tweaking.  As is, it looks like another patented CCP waste of dev time.
---
haha epic Rick and Morty reference
---
Can you link your fit? I've been using a Gila but the last couple I did they kept targeting my drones and I barely broke even after salvage.
---
That what he's trying to say. There are no reasons to join any side, except for payout, which is purely game mechanic.
---
I wasn't asking for a certain range. It was a more or less serious question. Are we advocating that weapon systems require enhancement? Currently you can accomplish what you need with scorch using 1 TC, but because TE suck.. you literally have a layout that becomes 2 TE, 1 dcu, 2 gyro. It's almost set in stone and if you need more kite you drop the dcu or gyro.
---
Welcome to addiction
---
It has the tracking of LR guns now and 2x dps only against structures
---
Dude we just want to create the material environment for you to get your own place and become a socially useful member of society. It's all in your best interest!
---
This is literally true
---
...with like 200dps, yeah. I was hoping they'd do more than tickle.
---
no boosters. no drugs.
---
heated barrage.
---
1 te, 2 t2 ambits. 3 gyros.
---
266dps at 40km
---
unheated
---
230dps at 40km.
---
these are good numbers. Ac's were already not as bad as we all made them sound, this is a good change and CCP should wait to see how it shakes out, before making heavy handed buffs/nerfs.
---
Go into the systems and shoot CONCORD, see how that works out for you.
---
V0lta with a dozen kikis
---
I cannot play the game for at least 3 months.
---
you choose what to shoot, what you shoot determines whether you get the ship BPC or the materials.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
170 dps at 70 km is a shit load more than a nomen's 0 dps at 50km.  
---
And then u get 230 at 40. and more and more the closer you get.  
---
  
---
AC's should not be some god teir weapon that throws 400 dps with close range tracking to 50 km.  
---
They were useable before. this slight buff makes them more viable. And CCP should not be making heavy handed buffs/nerfs.  This is a good change, and if youre familiar with flying kiting AC ships, you should be able to see how this is a very reasonable buff.
---
Lootboxes where you have a lot of chances to get not just shit, but absolutely nothing!
---
do you guys not have phones HyperCores
---
Good, finally something CCP can actually control .
---
I feel like besides hypercores being from the ccp bux store, this isnt even that bad? Like its very easy to ignore. Not sure what the fuss is about
---
That seems fair enough. Is this with T2 ammo too?
---
ccpblink.. now we just need a popup when there is a promo :-)
---
Greed is Good (r)(tm)(c).

Also does anyone else see this as a potential new RMTs tool to get 100% sale success for their clients selling high value items for low value raffles.
---
Gambling with extra steps
---
CCP BLINK
---
Assuming that the T2 gun will have the same damage modifiers as the subs, and the increase between occult &amp; tetryon damage is the same for caps as for subs, I'm getting 7721-19302dps with 2 T2 rad sinks. For the wormholerbtws, that's 8408-21020dps with faction rad sinks and SS-905.
---
Well no considering it's the antithesis of it...
---
How so?
---
It's a feature people have asked for for quite a while.
---
If i read this right, could this be used as a way to make instantaneous transfer of goods across the universe for little cost as long as you are fast enough?
---
really satisfying to watch though.
---
We also need the k-pop version of the krab rave.
---
More online gambling! Yay!
---
...at this point, I hope all this microtransaction bullshit gets regulated to hell, honestly.
---
It's annoying that of all things *this* is what they spend development effort on.  I'm also personally not a fan of using any game as a vehicle for overt gambling.
---
But, being powered by CCP Bux is what really annoys me.  It feels like they're chasing a quick buck by finding more ways to squeeze in microtransactions.
---
Looks like the suits over at CCP sold their Seoul for some IRL spodbrain
---
So is this basically a raffle? I.e., the seller can list an item to raffle and then people buy raffle tickets? Then the winner is selected at random from those who bought in?
---
Even if it was legal, I'm feeling really bad for any Eve players with legitimate gambling addiction issues who will be 2-3 clicks away from a gambling mini-game from now on every time they log into Eve.
---
Hi. Thera is very safe don't worry.
---
It's not just gambling. It's penny auctions.
---
Thanks a bunch for these numbers. üëç

Any chance we can get a copy/paste for those at work?
---
Yeah this is a pretty positive change idk what you are upset about.
---
i dont want the plex prices going up sigh

This is gambling, and should be illegal.  What the hell are they thinking??

Thanks for the clarification.

Any idea roughly what percentage the cost of the cores will be at current prices?
---
looks like a half used tampon.....
---
ok boomer
---
No idea I'm afraid.
---
I'd hope CCP keep it low, because high could kill the use of the system.
---
I think CCP is going for an interesting "out" to the gambling claims.
---
It seems there are a maximum number of tickets for each item. Say it's set at 31 for a given item.
---
If a purchaser buys all 31 tickets, they get the item. That's it. There's no gambling if you just choose to buy at full ticket value. This would be compared to a system with infinite tickets, where no matter how much you gamble, you still might not get the item.
---
Key word in your post is **WIN ITEMS**           
---
Ignoring the fact that this is gambling and if you are adult you can just go to casino - EvE Online is rated for 13yo and older.          
---
I know that industry loves to teach young to gamble to increase profits now and even bigger later when people get addicted.        
---
Question is do we allow it
---
Hey no worries mate. FWIW its in the patch notes too, but thats obviously not the way to explain how a feature works! We're looking at assigning a default to it and have discussed how we could maybe show this in the People &amp; Places window too.
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
I mean they straight up refer to it in the intro
---
ISK that can be easily acquired via PLeX which can be easily acquired via Credit Card.
---
It's like if the Casino first had you convert your cash into "CasinoCoins", and then they converted those into "CasinoPoints" which let you enter a raffle to win a jackpot. **This is gambling** regardless of how many "interim" steps you put in between.
---
The only thing that might save them running afoul of laws is that you can't convert ISK back into USD or you run afoul of their EULA/TOS. I'll be curious to see how regulators look at this sort of thing though.
---
Referencing this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box#Europe
---
I see this paragraph that jumps out at me:
---
&gt;In March 2017, the UK's Gambling Commission issued a position paper "Virtual currencies, esports and social casino gaming". The paper took the position that virtual items are "prizes", and that, in general "Where prizes are successfully restricted for use solely within the game, such in-game features would not be licensable gambling". However, the paper continues that:
---
&gt;**In our view, the ability to convert in-game items into cash, or to trade them (for other items of value), means they attain a real world value and become articles of money or money‚Äôs worth. Where facilities for gambling are offered using such items, a licence is required in exactly the same manner as would be expected in circumstances where somebody uses or receives casino chips as a method of payment for gambling, which can later be exchanged for cash.**
---
Also, please don‚Äôt let this be the ‚Äúmarket overhaul‚Äù that was teased at Eve London. Please. Please. Please.
---
Cool, sounds good! You could go the way of showing the shortcut in, like, a greyish font on the right-click menu a few levels into the ‚Äòbookmark structure‚Äô.
---
Players would probably put 2 and 2 together if it was presented to them like that.
---
I want to give so many of these comments gold, but unfortunately I only have one gold to give and reddit doesn't some kind of... raffle feature where I can select one of the comments at random. Gosh. If only they had that.
---
Am I the only one who doesn't care?  I won't use it but if someone wants to give their money to CCP and receives no "updgrades" or "gold ammo", why do I care?  
---
I can't see anything wrong with it.
---
Yes, but who really puts skill points into sense motive?
---
Got a link, out of curiosity? Everything I've seen so far suggests that the "conversion back into RL currency" is the deciding factor for most of these laws/regulators.
---
"No really, selling ourselves to Koreans doesn't mean that we will add more microtransactions in EVE!"
---
Everyone would have believed it?
---
lol so glad i managed to RMT my shit
---
Give me a link to that request! Where did reddit asked for gambling?
---
Bold of you to assume CCP plans 4 years out.
---
Lol.
---
When i clicked on the Dev Blog, i really thought they would introduce a new citadel structure. Perhaps something local related after the blackout? The Administration Hub / Intel array they teased us years ago at fanfest?
---
But no, instead we're getting a new monetization "feature".
---
What a sweet summer child i am....

Oh ....... :(

I really doubt anyone is going to take CCP to court over gambling.
---
Except this time watch the player base gobble down on that CCP cock...
---
This man has been a developer for so long he's forgotten that normal people don't understand his nightmares.
---
Happy now?
---
But this is EVE. EVE loves and respects a scam.
---
ALARMS!!. Kill report available
---
Just pay $
---
Yea
---
This is total bullshit. First they close all casinosites cause they were against gambling laws. Then you make an even worse gambling machine, with more bullshit in it, and a possibility to spend real money for it (this is 100% like every gambling website). I can't understand how someone proposed this bullshit, and they all agreed to that.  
---
They asked CSM's opinion on this shit? Or at least they asked something?  
---
Eve online was spreasheet in space. Now it's casino, but with some spaceshit in a station
---
I can‚Äôt get in the test server. But would love to see the cost of them. That‚Äôs going to be the deciding factor.
---
1isk each? 1 mil? 1bil? That makes a big difference lol
---
https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/45483447
---
Belgium at least considers it gambling because the outcome is unknown and you can put real money in to get it.
---
I can only see it as not gambling in two lights:
---
* You can technically buy-out all the raffle tickets for an item, therefore guaranteeing you get it (no gambling)
---
* CCP themselves aren't gambling or forcing anyone to raffle or buy for raffle (less than buy out price) items. Just making a market for players to do so
---
Because it hurts what CCP or PA i think in this case now is doing to EVE.        
---
Sorry, you are correct - but currently i am angry as hell about what is happening.
---
Hilmar said in an interview that he has been preparing EvE for the Korean market for years now...
---
I'm curious what your CSM reaction to learning about this was...?
---
yeah get that rush... so you can be easier to manipulate into gambling...

It seems in most of those cases, the "defense" of the company in question is that "Well you always receive a set amount of items, so it's not gambling" (which is bullshit obviously since the value of those items fluctuates), but in this case CCP can't even fall back on that defense since there is zero guarantee that you actually win anything.
---
With an implemeted "taxation system" for ccp based on PLEX --&gt; real cash
---
Just when I think there might be hope with Team Talos kicking off this hits.  No dev would dare drop into this thread without getting torn apart.  Such a waste of dev time when we need it badly on structures and sov fixes.
---
As far as I can tell you could in theory buy all the tickets and guarantee the win, but either way this is kind of heinous profiteering by CCP
---
This is the same shit as those CS:GO Gambling sites where you buy tokens on one site which you then exchange for actual raffle tickets on the gambling site lol. It's the same shit
---
So plex but you can't directly buy gametime, MCT, skins or anything else in the New Eden store with it? Plus add a gambling aspect to it.
---
CCP has jumped the shark.
---
So, where is link for new EULA? 
---
Just because CCP killed game. Doesn't mean you can do gambling.

I checked with devs, it's all good, as long as we don't take a rake.
---
What they deliver is usually up to management, but the art team always delivers.
---
I almost never want to fly a t2 cruiser, I almost always choose a t3 instead. They are incredible
---
How does CCP profit from in-game isk?
---
From their point of view, you can't start cherry picking which casino you ban or not? It was starting to smell rotten so they cut it.
---
Does it really matter if an HyperCore is 10 PLEX or 35M isk? You can freely convert between each other at any time regardless. Admittedly, it will drive up the price of PLEX as people will buy them and make it even more expensive to PLEX an account for a month.
---
Well gambling is illegal in korea accross the board and while microtransactions are common in korean games, gatcha/loot boxes are really not. Exp booster/skins are how MMO are monetized. I doubt this is a move made under the guidance of Ncsoft since government is working toward banning loot boxes and any form of real money gambling in korea and it seems like it's only a matter of when and not if now.

This, combined with the fact that CCP doesn't create anything new.
---
The lootboxes are a big issue because they are the *only* way to get a lot of the content (which has value) like skins or consumables (depending on game  they're in). There's no "buy this" option as wingspan mentioned, but on top of that the odds are *blatantly* unfair and can potentially be tweaked on the spot to try and milk more money out of people after a system can figure out they're trying to get x type of skin, just reducing their chances.
---
This system, unlike lootboxes, is not creating new items. Like an item exchange, the seller loses their item and the buyer (or raffle winner in this case) gains it. CCP is earning income by the barrier to create a raffle, but otherwise has no hand in what items are sold, at what price and what odds.
---
Good choice to post this
---
Utter shit. Do ccp even speak to the community before putting shit in to their game?
---
Wouldn't achieve much, as they are updated frequently.
---
There are also some chars that only exist to bookmark Thera.
---
Ah, gambling with real money. What could go wrong?
---
If this isn't yet another sign of the effects of CCP's parent company, I don't know what is. Milk it till it's dry
---
Nice to see you covering your back  "I understand that there are legitimate ethical perspectives under which this is plain wrong. I also believe in people's and organizations' right to have their own ethics and that includes CCP."
---
So as eve online is 12+ in the uk is it ok for a 12 year old to start gambling, and then become addicted ? did any of you bring this up at all ?

"It's better to give than to receive."
---
Sweet so instead of working on gameplay balance and features to do with playing the game, they release a half baked gambling add-on.
---
I'd rather use the moros for suicidal applications.  At least it brings face melting pain from the moment it starts.  This ship honestly seems unnecessary considering what's already in our current toolbox.  I dont know how to fix it when I cant see a reason for it to exist.
---
Oh no, a lot of the ships in Eve look amazing. I love most of the games feel and design. But I enjoy lore and setting and Eve is rather loose with applying that to the game simply for the sake of it. 
---
For the longest time half of the ships of every faction was asymmetrical, just because. There was no in game reason for it. It was purely a design choice. 
---
This is, for example, as if a teams colors were Blue and white but half of the team wore red and black for no explainable reason beyond so the whole team wasn't wearing blue and white.
---
The devs have a history of this kind of behavior. Players wanted to walk around and explore their ships/ stations just to socialize. That was it. But the devs wanted to add a bunch of strange content that players didn't care for. No running was allowed because they thought that looked dumb. Over detail on frivolous crap that just got in the way like having the characters feet properly step on stairs. 
---
In the end, we got what the devs demanded and none of what the players wanted. For a game that hosts a big event to talk to player reps, they sure miss the mark on players who aren't killers want.
---
If they can't prove that their customers are above the age of majority then it makes this pretty illegal in so many places. Without even mentioning the ethics. But it's PACCP, we're talking about.

Jesus christ, I'm so glad I stopped playing when I did. This is just fucking egregious. No wonder CCP Falcon left.
---
" or from the regional market "
---
That might get dodged cuz you can use Plex to buy them, right?
---
So basically it'll have to be an honor system or website that represents the ISK with tokens and then demands members pay up to the winner or lose membership.
---
i am thinking it has a lot of Pearl Abyss influences.
---
Is this an out of season April fools joke?

Every time someone mentions CCP rules and litigation in the same sentence, a texas lawyer passes the bar

Calm down, lmao. It‚Äôs a stupid shitty system that nobody should be surprised at but until there‚Äôs some sort of coordinated effort at a national level in a major western country or bloc like the EU - which companies have been lobbying against aggressively for years - you‚Äôre just gonna have to deal with it

Perhaps you saw different threads to me, but generally I though the commentary was pretty negative and loads of people were banging on about being MT'd to death

Once i was being kited, then i droaw the kiter to my tacle buddy warp in point.

Do not demand game changes for your lack of abilites, please.
---
You turn real-life money into PLEX
---
You turn PLEX into HyperNodes
---
You risk HyperNodes to "buy" something on the Hypernet
---
This is a fucking joke right?
---
I must be an idiot, because I can't understand exactly how this works. I see everyone saying it's gambling, but can someone eli5 how this damn thing works?
---
Kill things while gambling??
---
What to do after you finish all the agent missions?
---
Funnily enough, hypernode.com is a hosting provider for e-commerce.
---
They shouldve taken a bit more than just the name and improve the whole commerce flow in eve
---
Of course they ignore gambling addiction it's easy to exploit for money. Companies don't care who they exploit/harm as long as they profit.
---
Put them in a bifrost and anchor it to your main - it's real easy to multibox and if you're in a gang just broadcast it occasionally so people know where to expect links.
---
452 dps, practically cap stable (~8mins). Falloff at 157km with optimal at 110 km. Targetting range starts at 150 km.
---
You basically warp in at 50 and align away from the conduit and then just burn away with MWD on. Dont wait for the trigs to spawn, you need your personal space! Try to keep the trigs as far away as possible, when they get sub ~70km range start cycling your micro jump drive to gain distance.
---
The basic idea is to hit them from out of their range. Trig aggro range is ~250km. For second and third wave approach the trigs until they start targetting you, turn around and start slow boating away from them. At ~160km you start running your MWD. 
---
Its basically impossible to fuck up, but keep always in mind, you are a sheet of paper in space. The trigs are ~1km/s faster than you.
---
Here is the fit, ~75 000 000 at the moment, so rather cheap.

Buy Hypercores with plex from barbie store (or with isk from the market).  
---
Right click the single item you wish to raffle.  
---
Assign how many Hypercores you want to the item (these are the raffle tickets).  
---
Put in your price per core.  
---
Wait until all cores are bought.  
---
One core is randomly selected as the winner.  
---
They win the item.  
---
Everybody else get nothing.  
---
You get all the isk.
---
ALT+T  &gt; Right click the station the stuff is in &gt; Move to asset safety (if it's applicable) to recover it if you don't have access?
---
I miss gambling in eve and while this isn't the form I'd like it to take and I don't like how bizarrely limited it is I'm glad there's an option.
---
Do I have to keep pointing out that CCP didn't sell themselves, because they haven't owned themselves for years? 
---
Hilmar owned some, sure. around 7%. Most was some finance firms.
---
What you're talking to are warp disruptors, and there's a number of ways to avoid them. 
---
1.) Use an even faster ship. Generally, a ship that aligns in less than 2s will be very difficult to catch on a gate. You can increase your ship's agility by fitting Nanofiber Internal Structures or Inertial Stabilizers. 
---
2.) Crash gate. If you think you won't make it through a camp, simply reapproach the jump gate, overheat your prop mod and tank and pray. A frigate will actually make it through most camps this way. The downside is that it doesn't actually get you where you need to go, but the upside is that this is an option regardless of your fit. 
---
3.) Use a cloak+MWD trick. Equip your ship with an appropriately sized MWD (for you, that would be a 5mn Microwarp Drive), as well as an Improved Cloaking Device II. Then, after jumping into a camp, do the following in that precise order:
---
* 1.) align (do not warp!) to a celestial (your next gate or a planet, moon, station etc.), and keep that in your 'selected item' window for easy access later
---
* 2.) IMMEDIATELY hit your cloaking device
---
* 3.) IMMEDIATELY hit your MWD, overheat for good measure
---
* 4.) wait for the MWD to be near the end of its cycle
---
* 5.) deactivate your cloaking device
---
* 6.) IMMEDIATELY hit warp
---
I won't go into specifics about how this works (it's not an exploit or anything), but the end result, if successful, is that you go through the whole alignment process while cloaked, and as such can't be targeted. There's ways to counter it as always, but it's certainly an option. Make sure to unfit your cloak once you get to your destination system. 
---
4.) Use Warp Core Stabilizers. They let you simply ignore the warp disruptor. WCS give you one stability point each. Disruptors apply one point of disruption (per disruptor), and warp *scramblers* apply two. If there is more disruption applied to you than you have strength, you can't warp. So for example, fitting 4 stabilizers to your frigate means that even if a gate camp hits you with two disruptors and a scrambler, you can still warp. 
---
5.) Burn *out* of the camp. If you just overheat your prop mod and go in a direction opposite of where the enemy ships are, they might be too slow to react to your movement and fail to follow you. You can warp once out of point range (~30km). 
---
6.) Anticipate and go around the camp. You can try to check for camps using http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/. If you see kills along your route, try to avoid that system on your trip. 
---
7.) **Fight the camp**. This is the secret option that unlocks a +10 manliness buff and makes you 2 inches taller IRL. You will almost certainly die. One day, you will survive, and you'll remember that day for the rest of your EVE career. 
---
Hope this was helpful, and good luck.
---
I mean freemium mobile game do it and no one say anything
---
I'm more confused than usual...
---
&gt; not your personal army. 
---
If you don't care about game why you even bother? It's not about gambling but what is after that.
---
That's great, thanks!
---
Apparently the HyperCores are gone after a transaction completes?
---
Aren't they sold on the market to get their value back or some such?
---
Almost looks like a loot box animation.
---
While I don't like more gambling as much as the next guy, I don't really see how someone with a gambling addiction who already has tons of way more enticing gambling options than EVE raffles. 
---
Like, if I really felt powerful urges to gamble, any game with a lootbox for cosmetics or anything else was already more interesting. And if I wanted to gamble in eve... well... have you every heard of abyssal mods?
---
Remember when you could stack chat windows nicely and did not have to worry about a useless "+" tab?

If only to bang Lisa from BlackPink, otherwise what possible reason exists to learn Korean?
---
Just google 'CSM Summit Minutes 2019' its the first result.
---
&gt; Something this big definately would have had a meeting right? 
---
I'm sure they had plenty of meetings with marketing, UI, and monetization teams. CCP isn't obligated to get a blessing from CSM for everything or anything. They're more like a privileged focus group or think-tank.
---
Well usually a dread is mostly shooting a dread or a fax anyway ... unless the opposite site has no caps on field anymore (from my cap-less understanding) ... so the other dread or fax is probably not moving out of range due to being in triage, siege them selfs. And neuted out ... well ... you may have a subcap fleet to help you with that, like pressuring bhaalgorns or whatever. :)
---
They dont care. This isnt a feature for the average player. It is a feature to milk a very small percentage of whales who dump a whole lot of money into it

1Mil Isk per ticket
---
Plex are still pretty chunky, if you want to allow for small lotteries.
---
Right now, you need one core per 6 million or so. At one plex, that'd be *high*.
---
Do I need to remind you that RMT is not actually illegal and you can freely do it? The only issue is with the EULA. If your quitting however and 'cashing out' of the game, this is perfect
---
How is it hypocrisy?
---
Buff? You mean un-fucking? devs killed them along with TE in a single patch...
---
I mean I definitely think there are people in the playerbase who want gambling (myself included) to return to EVE.  Sure there are ways for a game development studio to make the experience predatory and/or for them to profit off the playerbase but why wouldn't we want them to make a profit so they can keep developing this game?  I also don't agree that just because something is bad for you that means that you shouldn't have access to it.  People have the right to make their own decisions.
---
It's a shared folder, and the folder you mentioned *is* the root of it, thus the issue :)
---
Will take a lot more than that to bring me back. Im sure the Hypernet is nice and all that but some showing of meaningful development might be nice but we all know that the CCP of these days are a shadows of what came before.
---
Those are dailies, right?
---
CCP is owned by a Asian company, Asians fucking love to gamble like Americans love their guns. This game is going to have gambling. Period.
