Yeah sorry forgot to say I'm not an elite tournament honourabu space samurai duelists. What I am however is some dude that likes to roam with friends but sees that the krabification of nullsec is making that less and less appealing. Rorq immunity, cap proliferation, citadel spam, analblinx gates. All of that stagnates small gang content.  
---

---
  
---
"WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO LOWSEC THEN HURRRR"  
---
Cause lowsec sucks a fat turd my dude. It sucks there even worse.  
---
But sure ride my dick about your autismo issues with my kb. Totally addresses the greater issue at hand.
---
---
---
Oh absolutely you‚Äôre right. I didn‚Äôt mean to insensate that the fight will be fair. Where‚Äôs the fun in that? Of course I‚Äôm going to use ever tool at my disposal in order to win. Are you so full of space-bushido that we should agree on the terms of an engagement prior to fighting?
---
All the mechanics we use are equally available to everyone. You choosing not to and then complaining when I choose too is just a tad silly don‚Äôt you think?
---
I respect and look up to a lot of the skilled pvp‚Äôers. I also find an art in manipulating game mechanics in order to put you in a favorable position. 
---
Yeah sure, ‚Äúit‚Äôs highsec and all there are here are idiots, casuals, and new players.‚Äù... but my group has single handedly destroyed and caused the disbandment of most every Highsec group that has rose against us. Thanks to the Keepstar in Perimeter we also have Nullsec pilots buzzing about, and that‚Äôs awesome.

We are mostly unemployed deaf guys that play whenever we feel like it.

The fist post refers to bottling supers instead of bottling VNIs, but a similar result can be achieved with enough VNIs, and they are significantly easier and cheaper to generate.  
---
There are also FW bots, that create the entirely different problem of being unable to gain WZ control because you are competing with plexing bots that are incredibly difficult to catch, worth almost nothing, and require less skills then a VNI bot.
---
Wait, what?  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, so you have to make up yet another story that doesn't exist?

I'm assuming you are referring to discussions of techniques, strategies, and trends, and not somewhere to arrange long-term deals or high value transactions. Some corps have their own in whatever program they use for chat. You can always post on this subredit, but results may very. There are also public discords, such as the one associated with this reddit, or the one for the New Eden Report, that often have trader specific channels as well.

Well played.  Probably should have insured by fancy mino.

I like the NPC mining mechanic but you would need to find a way to make it so null groups couldnt just come in and steam roll the moons for passive income.

Ok that‚Äôs an idea, I‚Äôll look into it. Also don‚Äôt really care about SRP as long as I get to have a good time.. thanks for the idea :)

Is this a bad time to mention I have blueprint kits for sale for hels, rorq, avatar, will discount 1 isk to assist you on your replacement issues.

It's pretty assailable just roll holes.

How tabbing out will sometimes cause the next gate in your route to not auto default as selected. Also Jesus Christ the map is beyond useless at this point and it's compounded by them removing the in game browser so now not only do I have to use a 3rd party map, I now have to tab out to use it. 
---
Thanks, silent storm sentinels, it's a ap-turn based rpg that has some excellent environmental destruction. Would recommend if you like og xcom.
---
INIT guys said there was -A- in system for the cloaky camping part. There was lots of Providence and Charon gating from adjacent systems so the idea was to use that as event bait.

 You damn Russofob. Die in horror. The Russians will come to you and take everything from you. Tremble!

I know this duder personally. He is a dog shit reddit poster, but he doesnt lose his shit.

I think the "battle line" systems should be jammed but not all of fw space. You still want to be able to move caps freely if a system isn't really in play. How to prevent them from participating once they're in system though, idk
---
This is exactly the garbage quality posting I expected out of you. 
---
Here goes the salt mine
---
I understand that you're proud for killing a shitfit bomber but why did you think it warranted a post this bad 
---
tl;dr
---
Sounds like TEST has some real enemies now, maybe ya should change your narrative's and refocus away from your adversaries to your antagonists. 
---
"Man wtf leave my venture alone when will the pvp end in fw!!!!????"
---
This is what I am talking about people. This guy gets it. You're hired for my next campaign.

I got on one Mino kill. I hope it was yours.

Goons vs TAPI and PL vs Skill.  That would be the dream
---
I had skills to run solo, since you last played?
---
Yes, if we all had to start over, I would be a founding member of a new corp, that would be a huge leg up, but I have had to make decisions about what to train and what I can fly, I don‚Äôt even like big ships, I‚Äôm flnally about to be able to fly everything I want, and I would be upset if all that planning and delayed gratification went up in smoke.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
See you have such a sanctimonious defense, you shouldn't be such a salty bitch when you get fucking shrekt by one of the noobiest alliances in game.
---
P I R A T is for noobs and Russian angry boiz
---
Yes, it had broken regen and such.
---
I'm simply saying that shield supers are already the tankiest in terms of ehp - with front loaded reps as well - so after the change, they'll either need a nerf (forcing shield slaves to reach current ehp) or they'll be absurdly broken 
---
I like this. 
---
10/10 title
---
Time for CSM to go away, they do not represent the player base.  They are not part of important decisions, and are only told or informed after CCP implements decision.  They can only nudge CCP in direction.
---
Resources better spend on a community manager get a wider spectrum of feedback from the player base using other tools.
---
Having your 3 toons camping a wormhole chain each day is a glorious way to play solo. You can do whatever fleet comp works for your play style. Maybe post up on some active holes and see what pops in and out to run sleeper sites or roll etc. Cheers and good luck!
---
Looks like krabbers who didn't deploy lost shit. Lol.
---
Oi I'm deployed m8
---
What with full neut spawns? manage rep ? Mindflood Booster ? 
---
Do you roll some boosters before enter abyss? maybe some drop without penlty? 
---
This.
---
And on-grid with stations too. Fucken hate being turbo-lagged docking at Jita 4-4 because some cunts want to spell out something or draw space cocks.
---
So stupid and surprising that CCP would allow this given that it must add server load and the amount of data sent to clients for no good reason.
---
I said this would happen- Yolo supers enough and you get the attention of groups with nice dread caches
---
People still use IIRC?
---
Don't worry they will be using the new fighter implants üòâ
---
I mean, sure, if you don't have an argument you can strawman me into a venture if you'd like. 
---
You think vily is special? They were spouting gay slurs in local just an hour or so ago... they did accept adversity after all.
---
Paciencia, mucha paciencia...
---
When we go to germinate, the only time we fight caps is when we tackle one. 
---
&gt;So bring your best 300 man blobs as that‚Äôs the only way you can win.
---
Maybe if the entire galaxy didn't think your playstyle is more risk-adverse than NC./PL you might be able to form your own 300 man blob.
---
It'll mean less solo PVP opportunities. If I wanted to get into blob warfare I'd pull my toon out of FW and move into nullsec.
---
They are a group that have a reputation for declaring wars against everyone they see and then waiting at trade hubs for unsuspecting victims (usually new players). They immediately dock up if anything remotely threatening show up and pat themselves on the back at how ‚Äúelite‚Äù they are. Most people put them somewhere between pubic lice and a six-month-old bull carcass in their living room.
---
Well, there is no one answer to your question. EVE is easier then ever to get into, but the learning curve is still very steep. Honestly, there is so much to cover that instead of trying to enplane everything, I'll just leave you with [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1p915i/what_you_need_to_know_before_playing_eve_online/) instead.

Please elaborate, this is pretty intriguing

I love that bot, btw.

Literally told you this almost a year ago.

Of course I knew, and its utterly irrelevant. Why cant you read?

Not really, pretty much without supers on grid most null-sec blocks can't fight a organized WH response unless they don't outnumber them 5 to 1.
---
Horde are all about the subcaps anywhere, buddy.

Are you sure you're playing the same game as the rest of us?

ISBoxer (Or rather Innerspace) allows you to redirect files for any game through [virtual files](http://isboxer.com/wiki/Virtual_File). 
---
For each of my main characters I redirect the following files:
---
* \*/core_user___.dat &gt; {1}/Mains_User_Global.dat
---
* \*/core_char___.dat &gt; {1}/Mains_Char_Global.dat
---
* \*/core_public__.yaml &gt; {1}/Mains_Public.yaml
---
* \*/core\_user_*.dat &gt;{1}/Mains_User.dat
---
* \*/core\_user_*.dat &gt; {1}/Mains_Char.dat
---
* \*/prefs.ini &gt; {1}/Mains_Prefs.ini
---
Has to be in that order as Virtual files do a string replace on the file path and we want to 'filter' out the shared core_user and core_char from being picked up by the core_user and core_char with wildcards(*) for the character and account id.
---
End result is all of my mains essentially sharing the same settings file. [This is my settings folder.](https://imgur.com/a/X54We7Y)

iron armada and unspoken are more independent than most alliances. so in comparison - yes, they are independent kind of.

 Are you sure this thing exists?    
---
I have not seen ping

Wellllll, they don't shoot them, but they do shoot them.  Actual residents abide by the Not Red Don't Shoot policy, but there are many folks that roam the area, and well, they don't care about NRDS lol.  
---
As far as profitable, I'm not certain really, never really did much exploration myself.

Didn't say you were.  Vily felt betrayed by it because he thought he had an FC relationship that he apparently didn't.  But afaik there was no formal agreement, which means fair game.

Can you run sleeper sites cloaked?

Too bad nobody cares about the price for adding extra accounts, making PLEXing a few times in null but that's it.

there is no way anyone is paying frat, they have certainly had their bad days in the last decade.

I‚Äôm not an alpha I‚Äôm just wondering

Idk then

alpha's can't cloak. 100% sure. :)

Why no supers?

No capitals!
---
You are asuming his laguage, no hay razon para ello. 
---
Scanner alts?
---
Maybe? The most profitable areas are ones where Shansha rats spawn, Stain being the only NPC null region like that. In Provenance you may be safe from the locals but there are more hunters there for a similar reason. If you want to get into exploration as a long term career Signal-Cartel is the group to talk to. They are also very newbro friendly.

Tbh the problem with null is getting out with my loot... any tips?
---
What's the difference? 
---
Next up for Snuff is to snuff out Stain as well. Guess lowsec finally dried up. 
---
For a moment there, I got my hopes up that PIRAT might be stepping up their game.
---
?
---
Taste that test? That is the taste of shit. 
---
warp to a citadel, deposit your stuff into it, asset safety to lowsec.
---
How do I automatically make it go into asset safety? And wouldn‚Äôt it going into a null citadel make it go to the nearest null station?
---
 In your country? Is everything bright and great? 
---
in what way is the video great? looks like a standard uninspired zoomed out f1 level video to me.
---
 I will talk about the game again, you have to tell me about the real thing.    
---
What you said is just an ideological thing. In my opinion, my life is getting better. I have not seen what you said, I don't know if it is real. What do you think? 
---
You can't do anything cloaked except sit and look at stuff. If you have a covops cloak you can also warp around to find new places to sit. There's no targeting or interaction.
---
Look at this point eventually even without anoms.
---
i have alternative accounts/characters (short: alt(s)), that i leave in multiple other wormhole systems for whatever reasons.
---
 i don't know if you're familiar with wormholes? if yes, forgive me, but i'll explain it shortly:
---
Wormhole systems have no "normal" stargates that lead you to the same system. Instead they have wormholes, that only stay open for a certain amount of time and only allow a certain mass to pass through them. After they collapse there will spawn new ones, but to completely different systems. You will never know who will be your neighbour the next day/hour/minute.
---
Sometimes you find a wormhole system somewhere that you like (let's say J123456) so, you save it, because once you're in it, you can always can your way OUT (for example is has two exits, one in jita and one in NPC 0.0 sec in Venal), but you can never scan your way in, because you never know where in all of Eve's approx 6500 systems the wormholes are that lead, you would have to scan EVERY SYSTEM IN EVE. i don't think i need to explain further, do i?
---
so what you do is, you send an alt in there, that can scan the way "out" of J123456, which in return is also the new way in. this way you always have access to that particular system.
---
Or if you want to evict a fucktard enemy and you have a timer on their structure that you really want to pay attention to. you need to get in somehow, but don't wait 7 days with a full fleet in their wormhole without doing anything (wormholes USUALLY collapse within 16-48 hours), so you need an entrance for later.
---
That's why you need a lot of characters even if they just have a T1 scan frigate with a probe launcher and nothing else with also shitty skills, but they're *like a key* to open the lock to a specific system.
---
right click in your assets window, choose move all items to asset safety, you can choose where to asset safety in system if available or it will default to nearest lowsec you can also choose to default to lowsec.
---
I can see them, you aren't cloaked. Or are we assuming the bug isn't fixed yet?
---
Asset safety locks it for three weeks and dumps it in a lowsec station that's probably camped.  
---
The best way to get loot out of null is to scan down a wormhole and find a connection back to Empire.
---
that's how i feel when i watch open comms sober
---
How easy is that?
---
I think you mean point and no prop, right?
---
Wrong attitude. If you want easy then you can mine veldspar in highsec.
---
Nah.  That's y'all's reaction when someone at Starbucks says "happy holidays".
---
*oMg ThIS iS THe END OF WEsterN ciVilizAtiON!!11!*
---
You have several problems: 
---
It's very easy to get into the game if you are willing to read/learn how to play. 
---
It's very easy to get into many corporations, but it's very hard to find the right corporation for you. Many corps will promise things, others will have requests of you, and not all corps are the same. 
---
But you would be incorrect to think a single pilot won't make an impact somewhere. Sure, in a large 200v200 man fight its hard to be important, but in a 10v10 fight? One pilot and their choices, in ship and gear, can win the fight. 
---
He could maybe do sansha sites in C1-C2 space?
---
&lt;3 Major. Hat gons. Is this what it feels like to be questioning?
---
Pancho HyWanto strikes back
---
You people are weird because I don't have any idea what you're all talking about 
---
Don't actually use the arrow keys, double clicking in space is the way to go.
---
In addition, familiarize yourself with the hot keys. For example, holding A and clicking on something on your overview aligns you to it, S and clicking warps you to it, D and clicking docks on stations/jumps the gate. Holding the Q key can also be used to move your ship. Hold Q and click once to select distance and then click again to set your angle. Note that you'll stop when you get to your point, so I don't recommend it on fast ships where you're meant to maintain speed.
---
Learn to spiral in vs turret ships and maintain high speeds vs missile ships. Learn which ships commonly use missiles and which ships commonly use turrets. Learn about managing your sig radius.
---
Learn to Google. Learn a little bit at a time. Use Eve University wiki.

Let me know you need a corp to join.

- Operate in a riskless krab hellhole with a boson titan on every gate, a super protecting every mining anom, and bubbled gatecamps in 15+ gates at any given moment.

---
- Instead of RMT'ing like them or getting capitals to only use with 800+ titans behind, choose to reinvest 300+ billion of stolen shit back to suicide dreads to kill more stuff MadMax style

- Suicide tens of dreads just to see supers burn.

&gt; "OlMEc yOU aRe A RiSk-FrEE KraB..."
---
The new narrative is portraying the hunting side as "risk-free" so they can block buffs it needs to make the actual risk-free space riskier. There is no pleasing these morons buying into that koolaid. 
---
Game is just shit until they fix cynos.
---
btw also providence is usually a good place to scan yes, although it is crowded.
---
In general you can say, that Sansha Relic/Data Sites are the best, and Providence is one of the regions that have Sanshas. Another very good region for exploring is Stain. There are also NPC stations in Stain that you can live out on, but it's remote, so you don't have a lowsec gate there and no fast way to sell your stuff.
---
The second best sites on average have the Guristas. So  exploring makes most sense in Sansha and Guristas regions, but that always depends on luck of course.^^
---
I'll leave you two links. I'm sure you know DOTLAN, in case you don't, you can check there, what npc enemy the region you visit has:
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map
---
Also here is a nice average comparison of relic/data sites (no guarantee though), which kind of resembles also my experience to a good degree:

Why you wont jump into my Pool of autism but happy into Stain Guys? 
---
Is there really even an MMO out there where 1 player can make any real "impact"?
---
Actually, Eve could be the closest because of the player meta/political influences having so much effect on large regions of space but still there are areas of space totally unaffected even then.
---
The Legion's best bow shape (Tactical Targeting Complex) was abandoned in the rework
---
Tons of skins from events are available for preview to get you excited and then they exist nowhere on the market
---
The fact that the entirety of Nullsec looks the exact same. You should at the very least be able to recolor your structures or have them take the corp / alliance colors, and at best have different appearance permutations for different fitted modules like T3 cruisers.
---
All Ferra sov is cleared, new catch alliances are brought in to that im unsure how it works.
---
you can, but WHs spawn all types of sites equally, where as Stain only spawns Shansha sites. Exploring is still good in WHs, it's just most profitable in Shansha null.
---
Why did he think it warranted a post at all?

Way too complicated for CCP. The "mother of all balance patches" is basically what you can expect after 2-3 years. Essentially 10 minutes of actual work to appease the crowd of bitching retards while fixing nothing.
---
Thanks for making it even got into your hands.
---
If you ave access to a station in the region, store loot there until you find a HS&lt;&gt;NS WH, then use that to evac loot. This will help you avoid the camps in the more common routs through NS. You can also use an anchorable secure container or a mobile depo at a safe to store loot as well. The best thing though is not to carry too much at once, particularly if you are going to spend more then a day or two out exploring.
---
Don't tell me what to do.

Upvoted.

Keep up The good work make test suffer

Personally, I'd love it if they took it a step further and replaced the new map with Dotlan. One can dream .

This is the difference in ideology. For us, this involves respect for others.  And still some things that don't know if it's real. We are the people‚Äôs representative election, not everyone‚Äôs vote, which means that we don‚Äôt need to participate so much.

" Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar sense such things I grant may be compared:) says well and like a philosopher, that those sins are greater which are committed through lust, than those which are committed through anger. For he that is angry seems with a kind of grief and close contraction of himself, to turn away from reason; but he that sins through lust, being overcome by pleasure, doth in his very sin bewray a more impotent, and unmanlike disposition. Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of the two is the more to be condemned, that sins with pleasure, than he that sins with grief. For indeed this latter may seem first to have been wronged, and so in some manner through grief thereof to have been forced to be angry, whereas he who through lust doth commit anything, did of himself merely resolve upon that action."

Deals that your alliance reneged on as soon as you could.
---
We have our own alliance where we were introducing it. snuff did it it wouldnt work. but for test and doesnt shoot tri, so they certainly aren't the botters you would have to charge back in this case the ONLY one there.
---
Imagine being on it sober.

"Independent" as they call the Imperium for help.

I mean easy as in how long would it take?

You can play EVE for a year without even looking at half the game has to offer. While a normal approach like "Tell me what's in the game I'll pick what I like best" sound good for most MMO's, it's hard to do it quickly here.
---
If you were to tell me "I like fast-paced combat" I get a better idea than if you chose "factional warfare" in the list of things you can do.
---
Give me 3 things you think you would enjoy for a while, or 3 other games you play and I'll do my best to direct you from there. After you get the hang of your favorite activity you can then get assistance from your corp mates to branch out and try more of what EVE has to offer.
---
TL;DR: There's so much stuff, just give me an idea what you like and I'll get you started. You can do more once you know the basics.
---
I hate the Imperium probably as much as you, but having a NIP and being friendly are different things. I loved The-Culture when they had their run in Fountain, I considered them pretty neutral, too, despite having very close ties to you guys (assuming the flair is correct.)
---
If you search for a completely neutral entity without ANY friends whatsoever you won't find any beyond 100 members I guess. I guess we have different definitions of independence.
---
I mean what do you expect from fleet level videos. Most dont have comms because people dont want to give away too much.
---
Regardless of your countries voting habits your government acts on your behalf, you're in some small part responsible for your governments actions

Depends. The first hole you find may end up taking your right to HS, or you might have to go 5 holes deep in every direction. At alpha level skills, i'd say that I'd find a HS or LS connection under an hour fairly consistently, but rarely less than 5 minutes.

---
is this real?
---
No different than the nullsec'er who camps the same gates or pipes as their thing to do. I have a similar view for people who think "PVP" is anchoring on a FC and following broadcasts. In fact, that probably requires even fewer braincells to engage in.

Unfortunately RvB has been pretty dead recently which is unfortunate because I used to have so much stupid fun convincing the dudes to 1v1 me with both of us in rookie ships and using only meta mods.

&gt;wow look at that, the mjolnir bloc decided to stop being gate edgelords so they return with templis back to black rise. galmil stops renting from tapi and comes back to black rise as well. wow fixed thx ccp. *subs with real money*
---
I wouldn't bet on it.  The lack of lowsec focused changes and increased consolidation of independent entities into null blobs over the years have ossified the FW playerbase beyond repair.  Just look at the relative corp sizes and activity.  The only corps that haven't withered and died are galmil, and they're basically just null crabs that have made their homes in the decaying husks of once legit FW alliances. 
---
Even if you managed to get CCP to fix the shit out of FW specific mechanics, there's relatively little that CCP can do to fix the mannerisms of the playerbase - which is the more immediate problem in this game. Most people in eve just want to crab in absolute safety. Who are we to tell them they're playing the game _wrong_.

I've been going to some of the regions near amamake recently, there's been a couple of opportunities to fight people, I just generally avoid fighting faction ships unless I'm in a breacher, which I have thus far found to be a very good solo ship, especially with boosters

I don't expect much but it's nice when people actually try.  This video is merely very typical of the low effort video content that comes out of the eve community at large.

Terrible idea. That‚Äôs teaching him to crab...not to PVP. He‚Äôs better off in TEST for that.

It's not whether they should nor not (everyone should do whatever they want), but it's about how should they able to defend it and what mechanics the game provides them for defense.

I‚Äôm a fan of NPC null sec like Outer Ring or Great Wildlands. They‚Äôre usually fairly empty but you‚Äôll get some good experience out there. There are also decent missions.

My alliance was blue with the folk that live there, I made 170m in a hour in a half, but I always travel like everyone is trying to kill me so I wasn‚Äôt really paying attention to where I was going.
---
I then smoked another bowl and went the wrong way into a dictor camp in Catch, crashed the gate the first two times, swore I had the right gate the third, nope.
---
I have since given up weed for more Eve.
---
Do the relic sites in worm holes have better loot per site than the ones in nullsec?
---
Peace is relative. I can guarantee you, that you will not have 500 people crammed into every system waiting for the second that a new relic site spawns.
---
I can't guarantee you either that nobody is there and you're alone the whole time, because you would not be the first person to know that this region is good for exploring and there are locals that live there, too.
---
In general it's perhaps one of the lesser populated areas in Eve, but it's not really empty. Make out of this what you want really, look up some statistics, or just try it and see for yourself. :)
---
Different corp, and I assume you think I'm someone I'm not. I left the corp I was in a while after they joined SiCo but they were still a "member" corp when I left.
---
To expand on my previous post, a bit after my corp joined (I am just a member, not involved with the decision), we ended up involved in two hs wars that bypassed the in-game war notification mail, and which many members weren't expecting because we didn't own structures (we ended up a part of a group that did by joining an alliance or having them join one or something). Manual mails were sent out just before the second started but nothing automatic / from CONCORD. So the wars went live, losses start rolling in, and on the second war I whined about the losses on comms to a couple members of leadership like, I admit upon reflection, a bit of an ass: I was asking why *so many* people were feeding losses that *seemed* like they should have been pretty easily avoidable for people who had been playing long enough to fly freighters, T3Cs, etc. What I got back was that it was by design, as I explained above. That evening we formed a "defense fleet" which pretty much confirmed it: we were supposed to be defending a structure, but instead were flown haphazardly around a constellation with constant free comms chatter in what seemed like an attempt to confuse everyone and spread them out. War targets had great intel on stragglers, and on the main fleet location, so we just spent an evening feeding losses without much of the main fleet even seeing a red in local. After that, I left.
---
I don't know what HVEN's involvement in the farming was / is at all, if any. For all I know they are targets for farming. I liked the few HVEN members I encountered. From what I understood it seemed like farming kills off of people was mostly about wardecs / via SEADC and other "HS Entry Corps". I assumed the eviction in the original post had to do with SEADC, not HVEN. I honestly don't know the details of the politics - I left. I wasn't trying to step on the toes of anyone with good intentions with my post above, but I don't know who all has good intentions, and who all is just conning / farming people. I was just attempting to explain to the poster above me what the "Silent Coalition" is, because they asked.
---
If you really honestly believe everyone in HVEN are good people trying to make good content in J space, I'm not going to argue - I think that's entirely possible. However, I think you should probably look into who in SiCo leadership has alts in the group that evicted you or at least profited from the eviction.

u/penifsmash Hello sir I would like to speak with a diplomat and make a formal complaint regarding my red status. Being primaried in every fight in any future battle vs snuff is ruining my emergent gameplay. If this is not resolved in a timely fashion I will be forced to notify TEST diplomats.

It's the exact same, but instead of getting one pirate faction per region, you can get sites from all factions

Those would work, but they tend to be camped, and unlike NS you can't go 4 jumps and leave the campers behind.

you do as your master tells you to!!

I‚Äôm going to give you some odd advice.  The reason you don‚Äôt like the game anymore is not because it does not interest you, your priorities in life has changed.  The games trying to kee you hooked into your old life, that ended years ago...
---
Instead of trying to salvage your game legacy, look at what you can do family, career, kiddo wise.  Games should be made to be played for an hour or so, not these multi day excursions... you do not have the time for that anymore.
---
You‚Äôve been playing since 2009, anything else will just be a new ‚Äúmechanic‚Äù... the game won‚Äôt grow to accommodate your schedule.  Don‚Äôt try to make it do so.

You were not meant to log in everyday till you die.  Don‚Äôt.

Aite, that's clever I'll give them that.

Test and Imperium is neutral to eachother. There is an understanding that we both want to shoot ncpl if possible.

Don't know anything about the event, but I would assume just showing up on the day they explode the rock would be one way. Just scan it down ahead of time. Should be a station pulling the chunk towards it.

But if it was a goon kill, this post would be astroturfed to hell.

 The fact it allows multiple accounts logged in at once.If CCP enforced a 1 account active per player at a given time we'd have a balanced game

---
Honestly can't tell if this is a meme thread. I'm surprised by the fact that this set of completely inward-looking recommendations are getting so much love, when they completely ignore that there are people (most people) who don't care one bit about FW and shouldn't be forced to engage in its gameplay. There's some points that are whatever, but here are my thoughts on the big offenders:
---
&gt; Remove supers from FW space by making them unable to jump to a cyno or take a gate into FW space
---
&gt; Make it so citadels that dont belong to the faction's FW system consume 50% more fuel, have no asset safety and have no tethering = encourages fighting for the system
---
These two together are something I hear all the time. I understand wanting to have control over an area of space and be able to dictate terms to third parties. Thankfully, Eve already has a game mechanic for exactly this, it's called *sov null*. You can jam systems, structures are affected by sovereignty, the whole shebang. The game is very clear about giving players a choice to participate or not in FW. These changes would punish players for events that they are literally unable to control.
---
&gt; Make it so FW moons are mined by NPC industrials from one faction passively = before every retards REEEEEE and tells me how mining is fun and cool, think about this. FW alliances can now afford better srp programs for their members and have a way of funding themselves without doing the most autistic shit in this game. This will mean more ships and more content. The NPC industrials can be attacked and destroyed by the enemy faction to steal the ore and reduce the enemy's passive income, so they can trigger fights.
---
Your idea is literally "CCP give us free ISK"? Come on, mate. If you're advocating for rolling back the active moon mining changes, so be it, but I don't think that's what you're saying. I think you're literally saying "FW should be excused from having to take part in areas of the game I don't enjoy". Nevermind the fact that if FW suddenly got passive mining, you'd find your gameplay suddenly shut down by every null-sec group in the game.
---
It doesn't take much perspective to realise that these recommendations are completely self serving. Pick one: "FW should force other players to change their gamplay (supers, structures)", or "CCP you can't force me to engage in mining gamplay, that's autistic!" Can't have both.
---
&gt; Make it so the combat tutorial ends with the newbro in a FW NPC corp and not mining in a venture because of the autistic advice of starting npc corp chats.
---
More of this "only FW matters" mentality. You're saying CCP should make the choice for new players that they *must* get involved in FW? Why not make then join a wormhole corp, or a low-sec pirate corp, or a null-sec bloc, or a high-sec wardec corp? What's special about FW?
---
&gt; make the AI dynamic so they cant be botted.
---
You so smaht, if only CCP or any game designer had thought of "designing our gamplay so it can't be botted" before! Make the AI dynamic! You must have a huge brain!

Being formerly of TRI and posting literally non-stop about how great and independent they were, I suppose that would make you quite the expert on that exact topic, eh?
---
Instead of removing the venture warp core bonus why not just prevent them from going in in the first place. I feel like completely removing a bonus it gets due to players abusing the bonus would be bad for the ship and bad for balancing (i.e. people use a ship how it was not intended so instead of fixing the problem of abuse we just rip the ship to shreds)

but the data load from a few hundred mobile depots isn't even much at all

Will CCP ever allow Alphas to have perfect ship skills for t1 and faction frigates and destroyers? I don't really play eve that much anymore and I was trying to enjoy it on an Alpha only account and I've seen that Alphas are vastly inferior to omegas even when two pilots are flying the exact same fit and ship. I want to enjoy the game by going out and shooting stuff but I feel like subbed accounts have the advantage when it comes to dps, tank, heat, etc.

How do you scan stuff?

It‚Äôs being run by a big Corp and it‚Äôs a public event so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be able to defend themselves
---
You'll never get perfect skills, but you do get T2 guns, and at some point piloting skill becomes more important then that extra 5% falloff.
---

---
Try doing what I do? I take video of major engagements or general activity in hostile space, turn them into gifs and share (or sometimes sell them) to the opposing factions. Seems to be fun thus far just traveling in cloaky super light ships just to be a voyager versus joining a corp to pretend to be their friends before you rip their hearts out.

Nice fight.

---
I guess I can try flying the ships one more time as people like Laskar and Tomalak really makes frigate stuff look so much fun. I don't think I'll ever like flying bigger stuff since I'm always space poor and flying at the speed of light blasting small things feels more liberating than anything else.
---
This is a great idea that I‚Äôm seeing for the first time. 
---
It made me think about DED plexes. Very similar concept in that it‚Äôs a gated site with ship restrictions with a reward at the end. The huge difference is that your progress can be stolen if you‚Äôre not willing to stay and fight for it. If you have one rat left and a hostile appears, the hostile only has to blap the one rat and claim the reward. As a result DEDs are fought over a lot.
---
If they implemented this to plexes it would make a huge difference 
---
CCP keeps bringing up new player retention. How about not having them navigate the agency dumpster fire full of lag. Escelations, no it was too hard to open the journal. Need an agent, nope using the agent finder that actually listed agents was too hard. Here, use this. Drile down a half dozen menus to find something that doesn't list all agents even in the same station you are in. Welcome to Eve.
---
we lost ammo shooting that keepstar
---
&gt;How difficult would it be to get into this game?
---
Well, the game itself is easy to install and make a character. It becomes more difficult to understand what everything is and does in the game. For example, all the different ships, roles, and the items they can use and how those tie into the various roles, etc. The other difficult part is just finding things to do on top of finding a linear progression line for your character as it's a open world game that does not exactly point you in any one direction. 
---
Over the years, the biggest hurdle for my experience MMO gamer friends has always been the lack of content in EVE Online. While that may sound silly to most EVE players because there is so much content, EVE is about creating content for yourself versus being handed it.
---
&gt; I see videos come up for it all the time and it looks like a blast, but very difficult to be good at.  
---
This is somewhat true, but somewhat a farce. In most big fights, like with fleets of ships, the pilots participating are being told what to do by a fleet commander. This is dead easy to succeed at even as a new player. In other cases, you may not be able to be as effective due to the skillpoint gap, but that has little to do with difficult as much as it does with uncontrollable circumstances like not being old enough or have deep enough pockets to skill inject.
---
When it comes to smaller engagement like solo PvP or small-scale PvP, this can be difficult because it requires most all pilots to work together and have more independent thinking versus larger fleet PvP where it's brainless except for the squad/fleet leaders who are directing their armies.
---
&gt; Where would I start? What would I do? What even is there to do? 
---
Start with joining a corp that has pilots that can teach you the game. There are corps dedicated to just being academy/schools for this or just look around for a good group of pilots that will show you. I started in a mining corp in 2004 for a couple of months before I joined a pirate corp in the north. Just learning how to fly, mine, and do basic tasks was beneficial to me before I started burning pilots alive at choke points. 
---
The only times we really drop caps are when people are camping a gate with a large-ish gang of kitey bs, usually with a bunch of jackdaws and a hyena or two to take out any fast tackle. 
---
And even then, it‚Äôs usually a bored dread pilot tired of watching everyone feed who just warps in and forces the enemy off, not an actual drop with the intent of killing them, unless you stick around after the dreads end warp and siege up
---
Also note, EVE Online has been online since what, 2003 or something? I've been here since 2004 myself. I also worked in the MMORPG industry for 7 years too. I would say a game that has over 100k subs is going to likely thrive and be profitable for the company until it dwindles down to say, below 50k or less. EVE Online will be up for another 5 to 10 years unless their new publisher screws it up or the PC market crashes.

Either that or prevent anchoring in systems not controlled by the empire the structure's owners are part of. If control switches away from that faction, diamond npcs start attacking the structure *significantly* often.

As a dude who's been doing explo with a new toon that's ~45 days old and using a defenseless imicus, undocking means accepting you can and probably will be blown up. Now that's out of the way, I'd say don't worry about null sec yet. If you're lucky you can make good isk on low and even high sec sometimes. Use your map to find systems with low population, and try to figure out ghost times for your region of space. Practice setting up bookmarks in random areas of space and keeping an eye on local/dscan. If u have a second monitor, run the game in full screen window and have zkillboard on the other screen to look up passersby and get a feel for how dangerous of a player they might be. You're not going to be buying plex any time soon, but you will be getting experience dealing with all sorts of sotuations. Finally, I'd recommend trying to join a good friendly Corp and googling everything. 
---
Some really good and logical ideas in there, sadly CCP isn't very good at logic and only listens to what the null lobby wants.
---
Supposedly one of the benefits of renting is their space is protected by their landlord. In reality it's just a megablob treating them like less than humans.
---
It's an appalling model but renters aren't interested, nor more importantly capable, of actually fighting for the systems so the rental regions are just paper tigers that get thrown under the bus right out of the gate, despite the income supposedly being rather important.
---
Check this guys fit out. He's a really good frigate pilot: https://zkillboard.com/kill/75822676/
---
He also streams under the name evelog if you are into that. Informative pvp content. 
---
Yes manual piloting is clicking in space for the most part. 
---
Or a newbie myself tryna get some moon ore
---
So that guy is scanning things down or killing small stuff with a venture lol that's awesome! I may have to start doing that. Or something similar. Just proves you dont need a lot of isk or high sp to have fun.
---
Each account has a cloaky camper/cyno alt/pi alt/random on it. Each account has 3 toons that are used pretty often. 
---
Which literally sounds like your account set up... just with more accounts.... also you have A LOT of isk tied up in your accounts. Characters are priced at about 1 bil per Million SP. By having a single character that can fly multiple caps it‚Äôs like throwing money out the window.
---
What he described does not happen in the leet homo gate camping class just incase any one is curious.
---
Thats what i said. P0-p1
---
I think 1 alt is a really healthy number for most players. You want a scout or a cyno, you really need it in most cases.
---
You say that like that was any better
---
You're wrong, orphan meat is worth more when building a meat dragon
---
Autism is my native language and i can't read this, sry.
---
Oh not at all lol. Anyways I was trying to point out that I made this character 10+ years ago and this is the first time I actually get to play it.. the game as a whole.
---
I don't see a version where Test and Frat are allies in the near Future tbh. :D
---
Technically all corpses are orphaned.
---
Trigger happy super pilots yolo their ratting supers on experienxed hunters? What could possibly go wrong.... Didnt inner hell did exatctly the same thing in impass like 2 months ago with skillu and scourge?
---
It matters whether they were orphans before they died tho...
---
I was responding to how mafia protection rackets work :P
---
But generally for renters it's more like "this is land we control, you can live here for money and we won't kick you out". That's nothing subhuman about that. They don't make them mine shit all day or anything. You pay you can do whatever the fuck you want. They do also hopefully protect your citadels and such but anyone under the impression that they're going to be able to ward off every attack is retarded :|
---
And what do you mean paper tigers? Are you saying there are people that think rental regions have muscle? If there are then they are also retarded. It's just a mix of people trying to have a full chill living with no commitments, bots, and alts for some money making. Anyone who goes hunting there knows that 90% of the time people are just going to safe up and wait till they leave :P That's one of the reasons cloaky camping is effective as they often have nowhere else to go, just their pocket or system. 
---
You are making renting out to be a lot worse and more then it is :P It's just a lot of extra space they can charge people money to live there for :P
---
Stainwagon will have its revenge!
---
You think capsuleers have family?
---
 They're immortal Homunculi with a digital "soul" trapped inside.
---
I used to do exploration but the agency killed my will to do it
---
make it stop
---
Nope only Providence
---
It is rather astonishing that the easy solution to bots is so profoundly ignored.
---
Here is how you stop bots: on positive confirmation [that one is important] that a toon is a bot: set their skill point count to 0.
---
Run a script x amount of time later [the time where a new toon would have acquired the skills to operate the bot operation] to check the toon‚Äôs skill points at that point. If it meets a certain threshold: set the skill points to 0 again. Repeat until they biomass the toon.
---
End of botting.
---
Disproving the bible... lol
---
Needs to be proven first.
---
No, I think he meant it the way he wrote. Frigate fights are often so quick that you can sometimes get away without having a point &amp; rely on the other side not realizing that they aren‚Äôt tackled until it‚Äôs too late 
---
The Charons started the whole thing. They got tackled by some wh lokis and it escalated from there. Charons were just doing their thing with moon goo.
---
"Slow doen! You cant do this quite so fast! Please wait for 40 seconds! When i reconnect to drones after a short warp, or redeploy them." Wait for 40 seconds during pvp wtf

Downvoting for the greater good. 
---
It's not new or a narrative, captain autismo
---
It's been my deeply held belief for nearly a decade that anyone who krabs in w-space and then roll and troll grazes nullsec is a consensual pvp hypocrite and these rants are like a child bawling in the supermarket because he didn't get a lollypop
---
Being ganked without counterplay is only content for one side, that's what virtually every PVP encounter vs a PVE subcap has always been, because the two configurations are necessarily optimized for different goals.
---
All ya'll are just booty blasted the krabs finally opted out of the scam, organized and shipped up.  The stakes and risk are higher, so naturally the game is broken because don't they understand everyone in the world exists to provide you with entertainment, right?
---
People that choose the ganking style of play absolutely do owe the game inherent risk as much as anyone else, and it is only from a position of complete self absorption and utter entitlement that anyone can reason they are owed what they want from the game at the expense of others and that it is fundamentally broken because it does not deliver this.
---
The reality is that you are not more skilled than many of the guys on the other side of the screen and your tactics are not new.  Until quite recently with the massive proliferation of capitals and innovations in defensive tactics the covert style of gameplay was virtually uncounterable.  It was possible for small groups of players to completely shut down entire regions and literally collapse alliances with 100x their active players by sustained pressure, because no subcap lives long enough against a drop for assistance to rally, and there was no practical way to bait players that were using spies, watchlists, continuous map analysis, and scouts on every stager or active mass of players.   There was no reason for the hunted to even play, so they didn't.  In Eve the ganker always enjoys perfect intel and the initiative if they care to have them, so they must necessarily be disadvantaged for there to be balance.
---
You have the option of hunting smaller or less organized groups where your version of these tactics would achieve the results you want, but you don't.  You have and enjoy the option of hunting at the fringes of the larger alliances, where the greed-driven morons congregate to die, but you want more.  There is no degree of solo or small gang obsessive no-lifing which is reasonable to expect to meaningfully impact the core holdings of player groups with thousands of times your resources and player count.  And it is just as asinine for the wormholers to expect to be able to roll and troll into any situation, warp to top belt, tackle and farm without exerting the slightest fucking bit of effort in gathering intel or adjusting to the local threat topography.  Any state of meta which permits that degree of imbalance is what would be fundamentally broken.  Quit fucking crying like it's a god given right to grief people out of the game, because it isn't.
---
I'm noob, what's plexing?
---
why is that? I started on a steam account no knowing this.
---
same amount if you account for inflation
---
Inflation, free isk etc.
---
Thats pretty cool tbh
---
Actually the best part was the "this is the reason of what will happen" (paraphrasing at work). God the stream was good.
---
Still wanting this so damn bad i miss my cq still :&lt;

Damn, this shows how easy wardeccers had it, that a little bit of bad press had whiners like this one come to try a comeback.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w6WWP7RM8U0 Here‚Äôs a vid of it in action. He doesn‚Äôt even use prop.
---
Which probably also makes the CCP accountants happy. The greater the ISK per PLEX the more likely someone will pay real money for more PLEX to buy ISK with.
---
It took an alliance over five times their size six months to seed enough shit to attack a wormhole which by their own admission HK didn't even live in anymore.
---
It can very definitely be both.
---
I've played X3 and know how this goes.
---
If you're in amamake, as an example, there are 6 different systems adjacent to that you could be in. It's both Ng to do with blob warfare. This is about making FW interesting and making the warfare part happen instead of stabbed ventures and risk averse dplexing.
---
I reckon you could have upwards of 20 systems contestable at any one time. Hardly limiting where you can go. Don't be a dumbo
---
Wewlad. Gettin reich up there with the race targeting.
---
How the fuck does adveristy get shit on and called racist tendies because FreeTibetTM while this is a legit prop post???
---
Welcome to Req Walka guys
---
I'd probably say that Stain is a better region to explore in.
---
NPC Stations all over the place, out-of way so not many randoms come over for and the best relic sites spawn in the region.
---
On the downside you'll have to compete with exploration bots most likely and few random gatecamps.
---
If he is in brave our dojo gives out free ewar and tackle t1 frigates for all races. No need for SRP when the it's free.
---
There really aren't 1000s of potential gankers around. The amount of individuals ganking is unlikely to reach 100. No, F1 drones don't count as individual gankers. 
---
The most efficient form of mining, and the smartest thing to do, is taking it from someone else. You can't beat that ore/hr.
---
At least pandas undock to every fight even against odds, which can't be said about you guys.
---
You know what is more funny?     
---
Bigger part of the dreadbomb survived ... and those dreads are insured.            
---
If you consider fuel and time needed to move them (from Stain) - it is just better to throw them on anything that moves in Esoteria, so i this will be not final fa-vily welp.       
---
sounds a bit like the old bounty system, and could be abused the same i think: just blap the industrials yourself, if needed by making an alt in the opposing faction
---
What part here is the spin? Did you not form a 300+ man fleet to come shoot a citadel owned by somebody with less members overall than in your fleet? NC got mad and phoned phorde to help them out.
---
Shield supers :thumbsup: :joy:
---
We had somewhat of a deal with phorde where we leave their rorqs alone in KE and they would leave us alone. Only deal we've ever made with anybody. Then they ended up shooting one of our rorqs so that one kinda ended up irrelevant. Otherwise we left BOT alone as far as bigger things went because we didn't feel like dealing with NC. There was never a deal that we wouldnt dumpster BOT, we just didn't feel like it was worth the hassle until recently
---
Its funny you still think Imperium would really care to help us if we just went about calling them. Maybe you shouldnt bring 300 man fleets within a few jumps of their sig staging and they woudln't notice you and thus not offer us to come corncob NC and friends with us
---
Well TBH i know that those "no-cap-hels" melted, but also 2 armor titans died.      
---
At some level of dreads and FAX on field stuff will simply die.           
---
With those FAX changes that are coming - you will see double tanked supers and titans from now on. 
---
The rent you were getting from Omist and Fey....

Snuff filling the shoes of PL while they're on vacation these days.

You do realize no cynos and passage through FW systems turns them to basically highsec systems and is stupid af?

Since you are clearly lacking analytics on the occupancy of The Spire ill help you out less than 10%. Never stop dreaming of your goals once day you will be relevant. 
---
Hi, what's with the pipebomb ? I see a packed group of big ships running many smartbombs. Is that correct ? Are the ships tanking so greatly tanked that they can survive for several minutes their mutual smartbombs whereas that i can instantly blowing a BS before it gets out of warp ? What is happning here ?
---
How can they ask for protection if NC can't protect its own structures
---
Apart from when test want to side with panfam.

Yes

Not sure if this is the same time as the Loki kills, but I saw in comms with a whole lotta people and I didn‚Äôt wanna miss on the fun which I was late for anyway, so ended up looting about 2.5bil worth of mods lol 
---
a few of these points, lead only to people just disbanding from FW corps and doing thier pvp elsewhere. nice ideas, not good ones
---
Not very well pointed out tbh
---
Remove the tier for LP on plex sites, the closer to the battle line you are the more LP you get. Make the missions to go run plex sites 
---
Time?       
---
Wait a week ... or pay 100mil more ....
---
Spai 
---
Next he'll be saying there was no collusion.
---
i personally dont see alot wrong with carriers and dreads in lowsec.
---
no im not a large group who drop these infact we get dropped on. supers and titans are a bit, much
---
maybe make it so that capitals can only be gatd through lowsec? or certains parts of fw? instead of the usual cyno hotdrop.
---
many have travel fits. how about travel modules. (and say that you need one to go through lowsec) that disable locking anything atall.
---
like a reverse NSA

How much for your alt 'Lux' corpse ?

---
nice keep up the good work
---
This! I feel it's already happening however, but poorly tracked and not official. 
---
In essence, they(CCP) can not expect or manage to control what happens in this gaping, vast expanse they created. It's us now.
---
Did you report it?  CCP remove some bots every now and then. I saw a lot of exploration bots banned.
---
What is the purpose of that shit in highsec anyway?  
---
Do they get a lot of recruits, because someone saw their shit corp's writings in the sky and was generally impressed?
---
Whats wrong with 50 man kitchen sink response fleets? Thats literally exactly what your 5 man nano gang should look for. Unless you are complete shit. 
---
This is what happens when you try to use shield FAX on armor Titans :D
---
&gt; then yes I‚Äôm mad.
---
so....which one is it?
---
hey I take offense at....ummm hmmmm no ok, carry on

It‚Äôs good for the TEST economy, we needed  to get rid of some supers, so the miners could get some more buy back orders. üòÜ
---
We had this battle x2 last night, was fun.
---
RIP the harpy/Tackle fleet when fighting Muninns :(
---
for running away in Camal
---
It's actually trending lol
---
But he is talking about dead armor titans and real Faxes - so stuff that matters. 
---
You could have shortened it to "NC unable to".
---
Possible modifications:  
---
2. Supers and titans can freely move through FW space but can't activate offensive modules.  
---
3. Insead of endless fiddling with mobile depots and ventures, make it so that all ships have a warp strength of 1 when in a FW plex.  
---
4. Too easy to camp chokepoints and have the FW version of the Imperium. Suggest systems not within the frontline get a stiff penalty instead.  
---
5. Citadels that do not belong to the owning system's FW faction need to have a new service module active (insert "activation within FW area" service module, that burns a bunch of fuel), faling that they are considered low power with no asset safety (you can still tether, though).
---
without hearing from tapi and getting a full aar, my guess is they were sitting on a mining op on an athanor, probably mostly afk
---
.. and face

Do you turn up in capitals? Don't be surprised if the response is capitals.
---
&gt; the jump beacon in M-0
---
you mean the bait beacon that's kept permanently bubbled and cyno passively fishes by gunning the fort it's anchored on?
---
oh wow how will our infrastructure *ever* cope with this *terrifying* assault
---
Stainwagon maybe will raise again, but a lot of things need to change before this happen. 
---
On the bright side - when Hedliner finally pulls the plug for the PL - RTSQ could come back to Stain and try create something new with some people that are still here.

---
with the amount of hics we had, this is true, the Nyx was never in danger, especially in lowsec let alone the amount of subcaps/capitals in field, so in the end of it.... you have to ignore the nyx and start chewing on the dreads/fax as much as possible :)

was breaking sliding seriously an intended change?

CCP stated this years ago - in context to changes relating to Shield Slaves.        
---
It is set of changes :           
---
* Sansha ships considered having shield as primary tank             
---
* Sansha DED/Faction modules moved to shield group (aka copy of Guristas modules)          
---
* Introduction of Shield Slaves           
---
* Moving NPC drops and salvage to correspond with this (aka shield race dropping T2 armor salvage should not be a thing)           
---
But then ... it can take next 15 years, depending on the how much time CCP want to spent on it.           
---
On the other hand - all those are easy and bulk database changes both to items and in terms of drop tables.

this is just a false narrative, there are usually 10 fleets leaving goon space during my way time and maybe 1 of 20 run into supers.
---
If you don't see them on your overview, chances are you are not seeing them on dscan either (if you are using the same settings on them)
---
Also why the hell don‚Äôt the plex cap faster with more people on them? If 10 ships are in a large it needs to cap faster 
---
try WH Pve. more activ than 0.0 Pve. you need to stay focus on you Dscan, don't mess with the trigger. also include some overheat  refiting for max profit (up to 300M/h for a solo rattle in C3)

alloy of "vets" belong to PL/NC who just to be honorable fighters i.e. recruit anyone with supers and sit in their station only to engage enemies with much inferior ships.

When you join a proper alliance and not one that ganks defenseless frieghters and miners in high sec you can talk about TNT feeding. Until thats happens you got no right to shit talk an alliance that actually does.

How much is it? AT ship prizes are damn weird.

If you utilize some reading *comprehension* it is quite apparent the intended goal of misling the enemy into thinking INIT was otherwise engaged and to cover INIT's presence in the area (for the wh) connection.

[The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: ÂÖ≠Âõõ‰∫ã‰ª∂, li√πs√¨ sh√¨ji√†n), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) in 1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: ÂÖ´‰πùÊ∞ëËøê, bƒÅji«î m√≠ny√πn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Peng declared martial law. In what became known in the West as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests)

I am doing this right?

the amount of people who assume affiliation because "you must be a mad member of x affected group" on r/eve is hilarious

not sure if you think tapi was supposed to have eyes on hakonen/m-o but as far as i'm aware they do not. misdirection only works if the intended target sees you do it

You really shouldn't need all those cap modules.

Tbh it is sad that you consider this meme.

AAR:

REEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

It will be an Athanor or a Tatara. If you enjoy sadomasochism, you could warp moon to moon until you locate it (Hek has 42 moons in the system).
---
Alternatively you could use a combination of d-scan and your HUD scan layout (the strip above your capacitor displays signatures in space, colour coded by where you can dock or access, and the little line being above or below the plane representing your own y axis.
---
Or you could just ask in local, since if it's a public event, they will welcome you.
---
Fuck, I'll reelect you on that platform alone. 
---
And then they ll make the system-buttons dark grey with light grey text in it on a very dark grey background. Dont underestimate CCPs talent to make basically good features unusable.

Not gonna lie, I thought this was a /r/nottheonion for a second.

why dont u try for CSm.. seems what ever csm says CCp listen . no matter how logical it is. join HORde or goons and run for csm .. its very easy

How you and other people use it, it is a meme. 
---
&gt; "Haha, let's post about horrible atrocities in a thread about a primarily-Chinese alliance having a fight! Maybe some auto-flagging system will pick it up and it will be blocked in China! Haha!" 
---
It is not a meme to think that China is a country led by a terrible government, but you're not doing anything to help that, nor is it related to this battle report about a fight in a spaceship game.

Both, right is as said \~21B. Left is whatever buyer asks for it.

I always wanted to ask what's purpose of that, without legend, filtering or system names?

it's nicely done, but it seems like something not really finished or am missing some features somehow?

This is not a war. There will be NO mention of war.

This would also make the eve lore end and I think it would be a story-wise suicide. it would remove the mysteriousness from eve. I don't think that's the way to go. but some of those game mechanics you mentioned could be pretty neat.
---
oh good it's not just me
---
where is ccp peligro when you need him :sob:
---
I've solo roamed with battleships almost my entire EVE career. I've never felt I needed a scout. I've been camped into systems. I just accept thats how it is with my particular playstyle. I've gotten better at knowing when to bail or when to stay and also knowing systems to find fights in, where i won't be camped in.
---
It forces you into areas you wouldn't normally go as they're lower traffic. But sometimes the lower traffic, less popular areas will have people eager to fight, but less likely to blob or drop capitals.
---
Is it nice to have? I'm sure. I wouldn't say its needed though. I feel like the game loses a lot of its appeal when you start cramming alts in just to feel like you're "effective".  
---
I've been playing for \~8 years or so, been through OGB, skynet, peak orthrus, pre-nerf T3D's and capital's online. I've been able to counter almost every one of those era's FOTM on my own (except capitals, not very many battleships can tank a carrier+add-ons for very long, I just got good at finding cynos).
---
ESI stuff always gets my upvote! All those nice tools and calculators wouldnt exist without it.
---
Vily said it was "sustainable pvp" on the meta show which translates to they actually can't beat FRT and have laid the foundation for a good excuse (also going to knife init in the back just to get to snuff killed their backup)
---
With that fitting i was able to run all sorts of low level sites. Also, there are NPCs that use cap warfare and until now this fitting allowed me to not have to worry too much about it.
---
Hi,
---
Nobody gives a shit what you "think." Put a spy in Horde, find out within 10 seconds that dropping a cap on a variety of enemies is prohibited and will get you screamed at, as will a small handful of other things.
---
Then find out that the reason you "get caps dropped on you" is because you're fucking delusional and/or showing up to enemy staging and harassing people rather than actually taking any kind of fight. Nobody in your BRs was "dropping" a dread on you because in both of the BRs you listed they are literally in Horde staging.

Thanks,

yeah you take a fight when you know how disrupting the cancer ecm on the tatara is. which effectivly takes out over half the logi.

so your logi is fine (noone can tell of the br how many t3s were logi fit) + dont forget your "most of our logi is in corp"- out of corp logi.

Sure, after Vily telling Bliss ‚Äúno, probably not‚Äù when point blank asked two hours before if TEST were going to defend the Keep, and then having another TEST FC convo Dark Shines and ask if we wanted to work together, to which we agreed, and then having JayAmazingness scream not to jump in because Vily just told him TEST was going to kill Snuff and INIT and then leave so as not to have to fight Goons two minutes after we let the in cyno...

So yeah, we thought we were getting backstabbed. Kind of reasonable to think that, right? But Vily‚Äôs cleared it up to my satisfaction, at least.

Next week on the META show: Vily accuses Rocket X of backstabbing. He thought they were friends. Why would Rocket X allow 500 NC/PL supers to stage in newly dropped keepstar, only to wipe out tests Titan Fleet? Vily slices wrists live.

---
The Boni misses her Clyde
---
I think like a week earlier there was also post on reddit about someone moving a dread bomb close to Eso.      
---
But tbh for quite a while you see people moving dreads around Stain in the direction if Esoteria and Impass. 
---
And when we asked him later in order to clarify what they were doing because of all that, he told us they were probably not going to form to save the Keep. 
---
Like I said, at best it was mixed messages. Regardless, it‚Äôs water under the bridge. 
---
According to section 7 subsection 5 line 32 of the NIP, you are incorrect

It would be correct in my native language. Give me that at least.

So they had like 5 faxes? Also there was a post from one of the TEST minokawa faxes that was proud that he made out ... as when he noticed what is happening  :

* he didn't triage        
---
* managed to tank with OH hards ... until he managed to jump out.

As a TEST FAX pilot he was truly proud of this.

there were no fewer than *FOUR* convoes with Vily about LGBT rights prior to this engagement

Yep sorry.

A single hero bubble can make or break a 200v200 fight. In both directions though, if you drop one in a bad place or a bad time, prepare to be yelled at.

Ahem, when can we expect the SP reimbursement? ^^^/s
---
Those NC. dreads are probably accessible to select few (AFK?) individuals - would be interesting to see who still has the keys to the car.

I have to agree there needs to more low gates to npc null and sovereignty null.

Cant be one gate however otherwise it becomes gate camping hell..

So are they really PL, if they are smurfing under other chars?

Have you tried downloading more CPU's?

No people simply moved to other alliances. 
---
&gt; Dunno I just like doing everything with my main
---
This option isn't really available to you the first ~3 years of playing.
---
Snuffed Out has in last 30 days active around 115 dreads
---
n1 the game gets more interessting with several powerblocks fighting each other... cool to have test maybe as another big block insted of a goon-pet to turn sides in their favor when fighting panfam...
---
Those were hard to miss. You were in?
---
yeah nice flair
---
But where?
---
Since alphas can‚Äôt use a t2 ab, they will always struggle for range control in FW against omega accounts. So, you can‚Äôt really engage a scramkiter as a brawler, or visa versa. 
---
But really, that‚Äôs your only big disadvantage. The last level of racial frigate V isn‚Äôt a huge deal, and you can get t2 guns/damage mods/webs just fine
---
Our alliance logo is in color. Thats the only thing that matters. 
---
I learned solo pvp 
---
Interesting suggestion, with only a minor snag - we didn't have a dread cache in Delve while we were still blue with goons... 
---
V. Nice vid, keep 'em coming &lt;3
---
I don't speak Icelandic, maybe that's where things went wrong :)
---
&gt; I don't believe the guidelines even exist, and if they do, I seriously doubt they are enforced.
---
Not entirely innacurate, but they do get enforced some. Also what corp/alliance are you in? Because part of those guidelines is that certain alliances are open season 24/7, mostly strategic enemies.
---
To be honest the best way to get rid of beans in caps is by getting rid of them yourself. We don't have a supercap umbrella itching to drop every thirty second to save any and all random beans in memecarriers.
---
You counterescalate and there's a fairly decent chance you get away with it. Just last week someone dropped 2 dreads on a krabcarrier in geminate. The dude that got dropped just put w's in fleet and ragelogged when he died. One dread got caught due to luck more than anything. Supers die to half a dozen dreads sometimes and when they do the dreads get out cleanly far more often than not. The way we respond to random dread/super drops is honestly the weakest part of our alliance.
---
i tried, but all I got was a bunch of cars :(
---
guess I need to unequip the cloak

since its not that long ago that you left NC. i guess you know exactly who does have those key's ;)

I like to convo the enemy FC and ask how much to jump off my own logi wing with a command dessie.... pays pretty well and makes a big difference usually.

No, it's the same group Vily called boiled meatballs, a famous traditional British food.

I mean... I‚Äôve seen quite a few of them out and about recently.

---
This game would be a lot more fun if I could be out exploring, doing combat sites or whatever, but still be able to PvP when the opportunity arises without being completely gimped by a suboptimal fit.
---
I'm not going to fit for PvP and fly around for hours looking for good fights that often, I mean 95% of the time is spent flying around doing nothing.

Eyjafjallaj√∂kull! *gesticulates wildly at the smart fridge which runs one of myriad EVE nodes*

It doesn't explode on it's own. The system works by first setting up a structure, then equipping a moon mining laser to the structure. Once equipped, the laser blasts the moon to create a chunk of rock far away from the station. Then the laser will pull that chunk close the station during N days (more days you set the duration, the bigger the chunk, thus more minerals to mine). Once the chunk is close enough to the station, normally around 100KM I do believe, the laser can then be activated by a player to fire onto the chunk and cause it to explode.

There are a few entry points into Provide, YM is generally camped on the Kari gate and is probably a crap shoot.

I mentioned this to a veteran Gallente FW pilot at Evesterdam this weekend and he mentioned they had actually done attacks on systems behind enemy lines to remove access to lvl 4 FW agents or cut supply lines, so it would remove some of the interesting choices that can be made by FW alliances.

Also, I just watched Clear Skies, and they say something about the Jove keeping all empires at the same tech level. Is that actually true in lore, and would there be any jove left after the Caroline‚Äôs star incident? Or is every last one of them gone

thoughts on the eve-o preview?
---
There is a blog called Cloaky Bastard. His play style sounds perfect for you - and it‚Äôs an interesting read too. 
---
It depends on what exactly you're doing, 8-9 combat accounts is not unreasonable - having 1-2 versatile subcap accounts, super account, titan account, 1-2 FAX accounts, second super account for memesuper, and 2-3 hunter/cyno/tackle accounts you don't mind leaving logged off somewhere for sometimes weeks isn't unheard of; depending on what exactly you're doing you might want to have more flexibility in terms of what combat-capable characters you can have online at the same time. This doesn't even include spy accounts to put in another groups (and for spies dating to XML API times, they had to be on separate accounts).
---
Of course it's completely different topic what you do with remaining character slots on those accounts, here amount of possible uses can vary a lot between players.
---
Guess you got violated in a bad spot, eh comrade cringe?
---
I will gladly take that label, bro. I would rather be that than someone defending the type of shit that is on the wrong side of history and human decency. 
---
Yes, so someone coming past won't be able to tell when it's due to explode, right?
---
\&gt; Just scan it down ahead of time. 
---
This suggests there's a way for a third party to find out when it's due?
---
It's the top 1% in some fields that have 13 accs on average, so that's not too crazy

Most of the things from the list are way more complicated and easily affect many other things outside of FW. But this point is absolutely great.

The initial setup took me some tinkering but after I figured out how to resize my layout and such it wasn‚Äôt terrible. I‚Äôll definitely keep playing with it. 
---
It depends on how exactly it is implemented. If "behind enemy lines" attacks are still possible, but simply not senseful for the average player, it could still be a viable option in a big campaign.  
---
Also, the question is how often this tactic is used. Only because it is an option, doesn't mean it's worth keeping it up.

&gt; To be honest the best way to get rid of beans in caps is by getting rid of them yourself. We don't have a supercap umbrella itching to drop every thirty second to save any and all random beans in memecarriers.

Unfortunately, this isn't always possible. I'd be pretty hesitant to drop caps on grid with horde's staging keepstar, even if it's out of weapons range.

In the 2 BRs I referenced, one was a spectre fleet roam, and the other one was NSH. Neither are (to my knowledge) "strategic enemies".

You can't know exactly but by the distance the rock is from the structure you can guesstimate. If the rock is in position the station owner can detonate it manually, or it happens automatically after \~3 hours.

lets not pretend him calling hy a fag was even close to being one of the things that prompted this, come on. Also imagine needing prepping for PR in a spaceship videogame, next thing you know they'll snitch him to HR
---
&gt;CCP stated this years ago 
---
What'd be funny is if some folks read your comment and dropped IAP sales prices. I do sorta remember this now but as you said, it was years ago. That is to say, it'll probably never happen.
---
I haven't flown a capital in quite some time. Every time I've shown up to horde space, it was in cruisers or below.
---
Granted, a few of those times were in larger fleets (like 40-50 dudes), but for the 2 I listed BRs for, one was under 20, and the other was around 10.
---
The last time I saw RP like this from Goons, it was a thinly veiled cover for harassment and griefing.
---
Hey!  Pretty sure I've never used Tri and independent in a post/comment before.  
---
&gt;The only potential problem that comes to mind is the impact on capital travel. Anyone more familiar with the routes capitals usually take around the universe than me able to chime in with how badly this would cripple the ability to get from nullsec point A to nullsec point B?
---
I personally like the "problem" with supercaps travel. It would put more bottlenecks and geographically important systems into play, which could create conflicts. It would also reduce the travel time "around EVE" in general, which is also not a bad thing.   
---
The discord gave up the partnership with discord, mostly due to the extensive shit and garbage posting in general and all those weeb channels iirc 
---
I'd rather work with (criminal-)timers on this. It also works for Titans and it doesn't give you the feeling of limiting your ship - which is in general not a good thing.
---
I can't be bought for less than 5M SP.
---
Haha 10/10 points for you
---
I'll elaborate. There were multiple red flags in his presentation, especially from a guy that is supposedly doing analytics.
---
Hardly any of the numbers he presented made clear if it was number of players, number of accounts, or number of characters. Needless to say, these can vary wildly and need to be specified to tie conclusion to the numbers.
---
There was next to no sample size given, so you can't tell if it is representative or not.
---
He took data from secondary sources and put it in his data set, like the guy who said he trained 10,000 new players and 82% or something felt a certain way.
---
Nowhere does he show how many 'elite players' he interviewed and how he conducted these interviews.
---
So what I think happened here was that the narrative and conclusion was created first: get people to join fleets and be social. Then they picked the data that supported that conclusion.
---
By not supplying any of his data acquisition methods, CCP Ghost might have well just said: "Listen, I looked at some numbers, I'm not gonna tell you which, but here are some slides. I concluded people need to fleet up and we're gonna make better tools for that. The end."
---
Maybe he did proper research and everything he says is great and scientific, but I, as a viewer, can not read that from what he showed us, nor did he give a link to more in-depth reading into what he analyzed.
---
That is how I concluded it was incredibly amateurish, especially from someone who labeled himself as part of the Analytics Team.
---
Somehow 11 hours in, nobody has pointed out the real issue with Provi exploration
---
since so many before you have heard mythical fairy tales about the land where noobs don't get shot at and can harvest the local sigs in peace, Provi is very much farmed out as far as exploration is concerned, and you'll rarely see more than one or two relic sites per system, if even that
---
if you want to make money doing exploration, sack up and go to wormholes... it's emptier than you think, and it's easier to consistently find big hordes of relic sites to work through
---
Then dont be surprised when they bat phone too. They asked for help and they will get it everytime against nc/pl.  So keep showing up in your 300 man fleets, nothing we like more than shooting panfam.

Go into other areas of the game besides nullsec. I've done null, low, and WH space. My favorite is FW since each gated Plex has its own PvP mini-meta.  I would recommend you try them all.  However, I do love actually having people on comms everytime I log on.  For that, ensure zkillboard ship kills for the Corp you join lines up with the times you intend to log on.  For instance, my Corp is strong in late EU TZ, so that's the only time I really log on. 
---
This is the most Brave statement I've ever read. 
---
Supers being banned, New players forced into FW, and fucking over truly uninvolved structure owners are bad ideas (not every neut structure is a FW alt. NPC SRP programs is pants on fire retarded.
---
Restricting tether and docking from the opposing faction warfare is cool. Tiericide is OK. 
---
Undocking head on view of your ship and station making right clicking in space awkward.
---
I want to see where I'm going - Not where I undocked from.
---
Bhaalgorn is extremely powerful in wormholes, but highly situational. You have a sluggish battleship in a space where you don‚Äôt know if you have enemy eyes watching your every moves, and a faction battleship is a shiny kill that few fleet will pass on. You also have wormhole mass, which can get you locked outside of a safe haven if you don‚Äôt calculate your moves.
---
However, the ability to just steal the capacitor with heavy nos like a fat kid‚Äôs lunch money is extremely good in PVP, because you will always power your tank and guns while shutting down the enemies‚Äô.
---
Repressed memory of 24 hour skill ques just resurfaced.
---
Like why can‚Äôt we see always see 5 systems ahead when we are close to a constletion connection it‚Äôs really hard to figure out where to go as t looks like dead ends.  
---
Well, Hilmar mentioned several times the idea of a new (maybe second) universe for EVE. Sometimes it has been the answer for the stagnation of the game (pre-wwb), sometimes it's just a cool idea and most recently he dropped it as a possible method to migrate people to another server and thus avoiding the problem of changing the game engine/code while people still use the server.  
---
I personally don't really know if that would be cool or not. But we'll see if it ever happens that way :D
---
Ohh I mean why not just put the whole map up rather then just one set of systems. 
---
&gt; More capital free zones would be great
---
It exists already. People call it Highsec.
---
FW ist not on the longterm agenda of CCP because there's obviously nothing to fix.. CCP Fozzie said this in EVE Amsterdam AMA
---
AFAIK, yes.
---
Mobile depot 
---
I met a russian (I think) who was flying as astero without a covops cloak (not sure if alpha or low skilled) in stain. I ended up not killing them because they seemed to cute. They seemed to be doing ok at not dying without a cloak, so it should be possible.
---
I personally stay out of the pipe to/from catch and have only rarely seen interdictors around the rest of stain. The issue of being an alpha is mostly that if someone wants to hunt you with combat probes you pretty much just have to log off because you can't cloak to hide.
---
Lol ya this game alt tabs really poorly 
---
The vaga is fantastic for electrical sites, though. Super speedy, tanks like a boss, infinite cap, nice damage, nice tracking.
---
More than all, it is incredibly cheap. My only faction mods are the battery and booster, with 3%  implants. I carry pills, but they're meant for emergencies.
---
Comes out at 700 mil, maybe? Dirt cheap, for a ship that can complete T5 sites all day.
---
so, he basically made you all form? He still didn't press the trigger, he could've told Jay nothing. But he did.

Here lies the difference, you chose to pull the trigger, twice and he didn't.

Do I have to explain expectation subversion humor to you?
---
I actually have a follow-up question. If i'm looking to see the volume of items exclusively in Jita how does the 'Volume' variable in your query reflect that. Is your volume for sell orders in a region and buy orders in the region? 
---
Your reverse psychology worked. Upvoted. 
---
Beautiful 
---
Yeah mobile depot is great in some situations but it takes too long so the opportunity for PvP disappears most of the time :/
---
For some activities a mobile depot and spare fit take up too much cargo space as well, so it's not worth bringing.
---
It would be nice if some ships could swap between two fits or something like that. Obviously it would be problematic for PvP though, if people could swap between a kiting and a brawling fit quickly for example.
---
Wasn't that the whole point of this covert "noobie question" thread?
---
Yea, but you cant shoot poeple in highsec. I ment a pvp zone without capitals.
---
Join Horde... Kill Pirat on Jita 4-4 undock :)
---
I remember when my wormhole Corp back in the day would find a wormhole along the highsec route between jita and amarr and bait out marmite in their hayday. The fucking salt when the table got flipped "pussy faggots",  "losers", "assholes". Eventually they sent out a mail (forwarded to us) stating to stay away these guys are dangerous. LOL.

Fair enough Brisc, a major case of bad communication between all involved.

Sure because instead of presenting a objective AAR he gives one with made up political spin and meaningless real life politics which makes his AAR less than useless. 
---
it was even worse actually, it was called that faxes were being primaried so that was after the second titan and like 6(?) hels were dead, the dude jumped his fax 5 minutes into the fight and then just fucked off after having cap to jump out. Why even bother jumping a buffer fax this late if you just gonna bail when targeted and not even triage if there's a chance to be targeted
---
You can lock the Athanor or Tatara and use a data analyzer to see when it's due
---
Havent logged in for more than a week and i still dont want to play. Its getting scary.

I always carebeared a lot, but eve turning into farmville for capital space ships made me lose all interest. The irony.

Its just not fun anymore when there are no real fights and everyone has (or can have) everything.

Check your wallet.

A Lawyer lol ? Doubt it he sounds like a typical Highschool guy

Thank you for playing your part in Inner Hell's campaign to discourage krabbers from mass dropping supers on Inner Hell when they're killing rorquals and what not.
---
This was the presentation I enjoyed the most of the whole evesterdam venue but it was rather disappointing to discover that double clicking in space hasn't made me elite yet. 
---
Nope they were at a gate.
---
r/Eve was baited on a free API question.
---
&gt; ...when they totally ignore that there are people (most people) who don't care one bit about FW and shouldn't be forced to engage in its gameplay
---
THen all of this is irrelevant to you. None of these changes would affect you one bit  except for the nerf to the venture where I think the problem ventures present in FW can be fixed in other ways.
---
&gt; Make it so the combat tutorial ends with the newbro in a FW NPC corp
---
I disagree with putting them IN the FW NPC corp but I think it should be prominently promoted in the last PvP tutorial ("Hey capsuleer if you're interested in a career as a combat pilot go here to sign up for the militia..."
---
&gt; What's special about FW?...
---
FW provides the most newbro accessible PVP environment (or it should) and it is *intended to do so*. It's an ideal place to direct newbros interested in PvP when the feel lost and directionless after completing the tutorials. 
---
&gt; Why not make then join a wormhole corp, or a low-sec pirate corp, or a null-sec bloc, or a high-sec wardec corp? 
---
Those aren't NPC corps? I think it'd be fine to also add "... or consider joining capsuleer run corps engaging in 'X'" at the end of each career agent tutorial with a link to a pre-filtered search of corp ads would be fine. But honestly the in-game corp ads aren't that helpful at finding a good fit... and I don't think CCP should be promoting particular player corps or alliances over others. FW is unique in providing an NPC corp which has some direction, provides some motivation and also facilitates and encourages meaningful interactions with players in other corps and alliances. 
---
Now, I think it would be great to add to the game some similar NPC corporations to other areas of the game that can provide a similar smoother transition for the lost newbie with no direction into other aspects of the game.
---
Damn. Don't make me do that. It's depressing. 
---
Xenuria is that you? Is it me?
---
It would not end eve lore you nerd it would open up a whole new galaxy of lore, all new stories, all new things for us to discover and learn, it would give CCP the opportunity to make some big changes and spice everything up for the game.  
---
I get it tho youd rather things remain stagnant. 
---
Thanks for elaborating, you're making a good point! 
---
then *MY POINT IS VALID* fuck your couch stainguy all the oldies either left game or left PL and are no longer affiliated with the name "PL" - PL 2k19 is Hedliner tries diplomacy and strategic planning coupled with Doomnchinchilla forgetting armor links for super fleets in combat.

Doesn't seem quite like a war. Just fights. The Russians said some things but they're Russian.
---
Yeah, I saw somebody suggest lower LP payouts for systems behind enemy/friendly lines, something like that would keep the options on the table for an organized effort to flip the warzone, but not for most plexers who try to gain LP

You must have missed hy threatening vily on the  metashow.  Also dread cache there wasnt a secret.

Are the Russians still split down the line of who thinks Ukraine is a legitimate country?

I love exploring a map/space, finding new and exciting things. Small combat would be awesome, maybe some steathly type stuff. I love hit and run type deals to cause havoc and then disappear. 
---
what's your class?
---
if you're \_just\_ wanting Jita, I can't do that. 
---
You can get just Jita 4-4 cnap, that's possible. and you can get the Forge. but not just Jita.
---
Depends what you're asking for. by the forge id, or by the jita 4-4 cnap id (well, what I can see of it. I probably need to update the structures again)
---
Something like that, yes. Im not enough into FW to know the best way to do it, but that suggestion sound pretty reasonable.
---
It also follows the principle of the least change. And it even easier adjustable
---
Agreed!!!
---
I would be absolutely shocked if CCP ever gave a name change. Your name is everything in Eve. 
---
Either sell the character and buy a new one on the bazaar or yes extract and inject if you need it changed that badly. You will lose a lot of SP doing it through. 
---
There are around 8 left gold monocles in game, if I remember correctly.
---
One of them is screwed into my face.
---
(You remember Blink ran a giveaway for Vegas, where CCP arranged the prizes? I got it then)
---
Here is a stupid idea I just thought of: An tax on structures in fw that don't belong corps in the owning faction. Have to make it expensive and daily. If the corp owning the structure does not pay then it locks down to only the CEO of the owning corp being able to do anything with it and the only things the CEO could do is unanchor or transfer it to an apposing faction corp. It would go low power and tether would be disabled while locked down as well.
---
How much SP would I loose? 1/5?
---
its due to discords new policies on partnered servers actually.
---
You told me everybody lives together peacefully in china . I showed you china is a totalitarian dictatorship and you are brainwashed. Now youre telling me this is a minor thing and it doesnt matter ? Either youre a bad troll or you are so brainwashed you can't be helped anymore.

I'm looking to get something similar to what you see in game sitting in jita looking at volume. I'm pretty new to all this so i'm not sure what 'cnap' is. my current sheet is a fairly rudimentary version of your https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/2018/05/.
---
highsec minining, highsec mission running, solo pvp, exploration, pi, market trading
---
Can someone tl;dw please
---
I was kinda shocked by your choice of language on the meta show. We all do/say stupid shit when we get wronged. Your issue here is that you are a statesmen from a major block alliance. Your actions and words have consequences attached to them. Don't apologize to reddit, apologize to your subordinates and maybe Hy-wanto. That or you can keep giving him content.
---
Now now, the only one that can have the shame tag this week is Vily.
---
Y-MPL - entry system into provi from Kari (quick route to amarr)
---
Well you‚Äôll lose 5 million right off the top because you can‚Äôt extract once you are below 5.5 million SP. 
---
You‚Äôre look at injecting 27 million SP back into the new one then. After 5 million you‚Äôll only be getting 400k instead of 500k per injector. So another 4.4 million SP lost there on 44 injectors.
---
You also have to take the extractor cost into account. That‚Äôs ~400m per extractor. So you‚Äôre looking at 54 extractors for 27 million SP so that‚Äôs about 21.5 billion. 
---
So to do it it would cost you 9-10 million SP and 21.5 billion isk. Hell of an expensive name change. 
---
Could I get a link to the video? I can't download it with sound from reddit, and I need a copy for...reasons. 
---
Restrict depot names to a very short name or even numbers only. They'll still be spammed to some degree just for someone's autistic pleasure but the bots trying to get value from them will go away when they can't actually say anything meaningful.
---
Ghost's presentation was awesome is so many ways. I recommend it even for people who don't play eve but has an interest in in the psychology of nerd herding.

Join TEST (or one of the other null alliances). The ore is much better and null is often safer to mine in than highsec.
---
They can't shoot preemptively to protect anyone unless they're at war with the gankers or the gankers have low sec status. They can respond by shooting a ganker in progress but that's not really defending since the victim will likely be dead already.

I'm posting it because I've been on the receiving end of a few kills lately, and I came here asking questions about how they got me, what I did wrong, what I should do differently.  
---
I got a few good answers and then I thought hey, I should try that instead of just exploring in my align-and-run Astero. So, I got more advice on a more combative fit.  
---
So in short, it's thanks to some of you for answering my idiot noob questions with good advice that helped me to this.  
---
Thank you! It was only a Heron in J-Space but it was by far and away the biggest thrill I've had in my 8-ish months of playing this game. I'm so glad I ditched the Lvl4 Gila and went out exploring, and then from that went to this.
---
Dear lord my ears

No, it is actually more meaningful than 90% of the posts in the sub. Nice job, hunting is good! :)

Good job. Exploration was where I started in EVE but it didn't take long before I started hunting. If you think your heart was pounding with that heron, wait until you jump a combat fit Astero and have a real fight! Keep hunting.
---
You really would be depriving yourself, ghost gives amazing talks. They start off a little bit insane and very slowly you realise he's fuckin right.
---
hi im wally
---
Bahls are very usefull in large fleet combat in J-Space, not really good for smaller skirmishes unless you are sitting ON the wormhole (preferably your side so you dont get locked out). I actively use them to defend my home when needed and they do a good job at neutralizing T3Cs when used in groups, alone a properly fit t3c will ignore them as the cap drain is not powerful enough to neut out a dual battery t3.
---
Finally, fit as heavy tackle they are amazing as most solo ships cannot break them (even if the bahl cannot kill the other ship either)
---
Great Presentation and great chat afterwards. Ghost seems really passionate about what he does.
---
It wasn't in eve, but I still remember my first non-consensual consequential PvP encounter. I think those shaking hands will stick with me forever. Congratz on the kill dude, keep it up!

Are you sure you're not doing something wrong? The only time any eve launcher has forgotten one of my accounts was the time that they specifically said it was going to do so.
---
This might be unpopular. Others would say outright stupid. "Carriers are cheaper and do more dps" yada yada. What I have found to be both heartpounding and rewarding, is dropping a Blops BS on Ratters / Miners. Bling dat ship out to de max if you have money to throw in the blender.

Thanks for having my coffee spat out everywhere...

I hope ccp never brings up wis again it's just a resource sink and doesn't do anything to improve the game. Theres plenty of other games out there that let you customize a character and living space but eve is all about the spaceship

also ccp plz gib cat ears

What is a good new player PVE way of making some ISK? I have submitted a app to join a larger corp and thats going to be the avenue i go for trying to get introduced into the PVP side of things. I am planning on sticking to Alpha for a little bit just because my former attempts at EVE i always rushed to get to the larger ships cause they looked "cool" only to be able not to fly them effectively, lose them when i couldnt afford to replace them, and overall make the typical new player mistakes which ended up killing the experience for me every time. I dont mind the thought of mining and will probably do some passive mining while i play another one of the games im active in, but also want a activity i can be engaged in. Is mission runnin lucrative in any way early on?
---
as stated in the other comments, Eve Uni is a great resource and are always willing to take newbros.
---
another option is to go diving in wormholes solo and if you run across a corp that speaks you language, convo their CEO or diplo and ask if they are willing to teach a newbro or can recommend a corp that is. For the most part, us wormhollers are very welcoming to any newbros (even if it is just because of the eventual new content they bring)
---
your final option for finding your next home is the dreaded corp adverts (these can be helpful but are mostly cluttered and really bad).
---
Ask TAPI
---
Woah, now 24 is a number that refutes all the arguments about dreads vs faxes
---
Good pilots but they should really lay off calling everyone they don't like a nigger
---
Sorry but I‚Äôm a noob myself. This is your first player kill?
---
Wasn't that bad. At least I had some time for work.
---
Just let's you see kills in real time. It's kind of a cool thing for fun. Not really a super useful tool. Unless you see lots of kills in the same place, then you could go join in.
---
Don't shame the nevernakeed
---
TAPI is safe, don‚Äôt worry.

If anything bad happened, Daddy Goon will rescue the Dinos.

have you considered leaving some cap charges in your inventory rather than the fleet hangar so auto-reloading actually works? that injection was kind of painful to watch
---
for you weebs, there is  [http://koahi.co/eve](http://koahi.co/eve)

hahaha not ISIS, ex army

I‚Äôm not saying someone should be ready to be naked everywhere, but it‚Äôs a natural state of being. It‚Äôs so childish to freak out over being naked.

Does it have a wizard hat?

Haven't had a release since December, partly due to EVE not really having much in the way of data updates. But we've been hard at work on some new features and a slew of bug fixes, and we wanted to get this update out the door instead of waiting for the April patch!
---
As always, let us know of any issues you may find at https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/issues 
---
Thanks!
---
let me pose here with my first kill..... whats this noise... what?.... a cloaky bastard is locking me ????
---
cHeCk Ur IsP

Sure, then have an NPC response fleet that's able to take out a few unorganized pilots, but can easily break with a fleet comp of like 5 people.
---
upvoted
---
Fuck yeah, first kill is never meaningless. 
---
You'd have to ask PL.
---
try replacing the 10000002 with  60003760 
---
Exploration is your best option, alternatively salvaging after a carrier ratter.
---
Mission running can be decent isk, but that‚Äôs not going to be nearly as viable for alphas, since they‚Äôre losing access to levels 4 and 5, which offer the best rewards for missions. 
---
Personally, I quite enjoyed day tripping into wormholes‚Äîit‚Äôs difficult, especially as an alpha, but you can walk out with half a billion isk in your cargo hold, and it‚Äôs a great way to learn good scanning/safe spot practices. Running incursions is also quite good isk as an alpha‚Äîit‚Äôll take maybe a month and a half to train into one of the Warp To Me incursion group‚Äôs alpha battleships, after which you‚Äôll be able to consistently make at least 100m isk/hour.

t2 battleship.
---
with active module that 
---
pros: decreases sig radius, increases speed, increases damage (or capital weapons)
---
cons: removes resists, decreases tracking a lot, prevents warping/booshing
---
Good stuff! Always happy to see a Stitch K vid
---
This sounds epic, sign me up. I think the best part about EVE is change, if you get comfortable for to long the game becomes boring.
---
If you want a stupid ship design: A Triglavian destroyer with 8 guns and a reduction in disintegrator fitting requirements
---
What about a t3 cruiser that can fit an area denial system to counter missiles and bombs make it useless on its own but brilliant at defending in fleets 
---
There is people who've played for 10 years and have yet to achieve their first solo kill. Congratulations!
---
I can only comment on the your cover up theory concerning the German extermination camps and it could`t be farther from the truth. The second world war and all the unspeakable things Germany did are by far the biggest subjects in the German curriculum at school. And the pictures and movies of the bulldozers and corpses at the extermination camps I saw at school are still the most horrific thing I saw in my life.

Next year

---
I'd just request some caution when it comes to potentially hamstringing non-militia structures within FW systems.
---
Lowsec is home to much more than just FW, and so I'd suggest that non-FW citadels simply be unavailable to FW pilots. No tethering, no docking.
---
It reinstates the lack of docking abilities in systems that are not held by a given militia, but doesn't penalise non-FW players for not wanting to be part of the FW mechanic.
---
I've seen other suggestions in this thread go as far as to ban non-FW citadels completely, or force them to pick a side, which I think goes way too far.
---
It's not reasonable to force those corps who've been based in lowsec for years and/or used to operate POSes, etc., to either have to leave a system and base themselves somewhere else, or join a permanent war scenario with the consequences that brings, if they want to establish a structure.
---
Improvements to FW should work to increase and invigorate lowsec gameplay, not restrict it unecessarily.
---
Ok thats good to know, yeah i mean i definitely wont permanently be Alpha, i just want to force myself to pace myself for the early days. WH always intrigued me but also intimidated me so ill have to do a bit more research.
---
But its good to know as alpha i can potentially do incursions as thats always been the PVE activity that interested me the most probably. 
---
I am running Caldari and focussing on blaster boat training (love missile boats as well and will end up training into that in the future as well) would you be able to recommend a good Caldari ship to work towards so i have a goal to work for?
---
I have never upvoted so many times in a single thread. As a very long time FW lowsex resident all I‚Äôve heard is how broken It is and how hard and unlikely it is to fix, but I haven‚Äôt read anything here that should be too hard to implement. 
---
This line tho.....

 &lt;i&gt;the average snuff edgelord wont be able to get his micropenis erect by dropping a ragnarok on a 10 man merlin fleet while reading manga with a katana in one of his hands and disproving the bible on reddit using the other. &lt;\i&gt;

most underrated comment of the year
---
Un-who?
---
a Ship which attracts cynojumps from neighboring (gateconnected) Systems.
---
(i.e. fuck umbrellas)
---
&gt; that dies to small ships easily
---
So dies to carrier even faster than current BS ? It's like, a really bad idea. The capital killer should be dreadnoughs. Subcap should just be able to kill a few unsupported capitals, and capital shouldn't be able to kill subcaps with subcap support.
---
Savor that feeling, no other game has ever given me those massive PVP shakes.
---
Really nice try, ISIS
---
Battleships with xl weapons, like a heavy bomber
---
sounds like it's not. I'll have a look at it and see how much work it'd be to include it. 
---
That'll take a while, till I'm at an appropriate computer.
---
what's your ingame name?
---
Thanks so much for your help! 
---
Ever heard of a dreadnaught?
---
Grab a venture and fit two mining lazors and a shield booster.

This is more meaningful than sitting in a mass fleet and pushing F1 when someone tells you to. Good job man, keep it up!
---
I still remember my first solo kill.... and that was in '07 or '08.... something tells my that story will one day piss off the poor fuckers sharing my retirement home. 
---
No, thank you!
---
I‚Äôm not a Trump guy. 
---
If this happened in a wormhole, don't forget to blow the wreck and to scoop the body
---
You don't want to leave any traces :)
---
Agreed, fantastic talk, and he really draws you into it.
---
We have enough cruisers imo. Make it a t2 ABC!
---
Go roam in faction warfare space, lots of frigate fights there and most people are eager to tell you what you did wrong if you ask them.
---
I think hes talking about an attack battleship. More like a tornado
---
Seriously I second this. Im so incredibly tired of seeing memes whose characters have cutouts of alliance/corporation logos for heads. Its never funny and it looks weird. 
---
Im not terribly good at pvp in eve, and I def know about getting the jitters on each and every one of the few kills Ive racked up over the years. I have never experienced such an adrenaline rush from any other video game ever. 
---
Ppl say Eve is boring, and it can be at times, but moments like your recent kill overwhelmingly make up for it imo. I bet the guy on the other side shat himself when an attack ship suddenly and unexpectedly uncloaks next to him and blows him up. 
---
The first kill is always the best, gz! 
---
Shouldnt take that long now that an asian company owns ccp
---
Jesus I don't even know what that means
---
Anyone else getting network errors  from the twitch player? 
---
Any way around this? 
---
God I love hard hitting torpedos.
---
That was probably me.
---
Glad I could help.
---
Hahaha, a dessie that can solo bash citadels.
---
Nice job! It is meaningful. Most of us remember that feeling. Hardly ever find that nowadays.. 
---
Thank you 
---
I don't want to! I have actual things to do and it's the worst.
---
Oh dear god no, never Theta. Join 7G Standing to learn how to live lol.
---
I think best value loot is in Guristas and Sansha NPC pirates space.
---
And of course you'd want to run relic sites only.
---
However, even ProviBears will shoot you if they catch you running their sites.
---
This would render missile fleets completely useless. Which they basically are anyway ... lol. It would need to come with some kind of counter play in the same patch too.
---
\&gt;camera bob not disabled
---
‚ÄúTheir‚Äù sites?
---
A battleship sized Tornado... hnnngh.
---
Lol this would be amazing. Like a drag bubble for cyno fleets.
---
No hands would be in Bad taste?
---
Unique intaki syndicate industrial ship with bonus for drug cargo

When I first saw this post, my page wasn't scrolled all the way down so all I saw was "t2 battleship." And I was like, dude, you're right...
---
Good god...
---
Drug smuggling ftw?
---
It‚Äôll just be 100 dead PL jackdaws to snuff Machs and supers
---
I will do the same when I get my first kill too. 
---
&gt; The engagements have been really fun with back n forward tho. Been having tons of fun lately
---
Agreed, I like fighting with you guys.
---
I think 18 eve time, but not sure. My memory sucks
---
If it is balanced to only be effective against larger missiles cruise, torpedos and bombs it would still leave light and heavy to fight with
---
Have you tried taking less cocaine beforehand?
---
Have you put a support ticket/bug report in? 
---
what Keepstar? and where located?
---
Good job mate.
---
Allways nice to hear of a good kill
---
Have you considered that it has nothing to do with the launcher?
---
This is a fantastic deep dive. Ghost is amazing he needs to do more talks!
---
Considering a fax can negate around 5-7 Dreads, yes.
---
however test are just THAT bad at the game and couldnt even save some of the buffer fit hels. That is just sad.
---
Nice work.
---
If you find the time, can you create some extra rorqual and excavator profiles or sliders so we can nerf the rorqual before ccp does?
---
My account was born in 2008 and I still don't think I have a legit kill.
---
Well done! Remember this kill firmly, the shakes will make you feel alive beyond imaginable!
---
Sincerely appreciate all that you do
---
This such a great shot man. And this post IS NOT meaningless. It makes me, an 11 year veteran of EVE smile because I remember my first fight (and subsequent death) back in 2007. The adrenaline really does get going. Congrats on your first kill and killmark. Where did you get this kill? Low sec, high sec, null sec? Were you mission running or hunting site/mission runners? 
---
I bombed a navy slicer once with a house d and fragged it instantly. It was only a few mil but me and my friends absolutely lost our shit when it happened
---
We totally care :)
---
when someone says "shoot this guy" 95% of the work was already done before ... 
---
Pretty sure the latest versions auto check the box to save the login info. So something else might be dumping the saved info. 
---
good meme
---
guess you never saw a loki fleet with HML's. However, yes, this would make missiles useless
---
I think that number is soft.
---
&gt;Fit Price Optimization (#1841)
---
&gt;We now have the ability through the main menu to optimize the fit for price. For example, Federation Navy Web and Shadow Serpentis Web are essentially the same module (mostly the same stats), but one is 30M more. This feature will fetch fresh prices and swap out such modules for cheaper alternatives.
---
Fuck yeah thanks for this
---
You can do that with smartbombs.
---
Denim shorts ftw
---
Propulsion mods and jump drives for citadels.
---
AAR? for fight?  
---
AAR for current provi situation?
---
No idea, but I think TAPI sounds dumb.
---
Lol, remember when you tried super capital combat and forgot the 70km rule? 
---
There is a whole bunch of factors going in why this dreadbomb was a success. But you can't refute arguments specifically made for dreadbomb vs fax balance based on this br. Delve will drop a hundred of them on you at most given moments. The bottom line is you can't exchange dreads for titans if an umbrella has proliferated enough faxes, which is one more condition making mega empire space safer.
---
Isn't there a cover trig ship though?
---
I always loved the Tier 3 Battlecrusiers (Talos/Oracle etc). I wanted them to create a Tier 3 destroyer with 2x large guns/Lauchers.
---
Another one would be a T2 Battleship/Battllecruiser that can act as a picket ship for taking down fighters/drones/bombs. Restricted to small weapons, the ship gets a great bonus to Weapon range/tracking and lock speed.
---
Sounds interesting, but could be really game-breaking. Just the fact that such a mechanic could exist might make capital-pilots even MORE risk-adverse.
---
bsb
---
THIS PLEASES BOB. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!
---
We should have a ship that has a 5 minute spool up timer (Ti-Di not effected), and when it fires it kills the server for 30 minutes.
---
Lokis are always amazing. RLML fleets are amazing too. In general though, for fleet stuff, missiles get out-performed. Sadly. Because I love missiles.
---
yah . iremember very well howdid it end up last time for u guys..
---
This is something i still have to achieve ... congratulations dude ! I can only imagine the effect of the shake once you're on the other side ! Hope to join you there soon ! o7 
---
post a video instead of zkill you fucking mong
---
this is a partnered reddit, no can has make tarder
---
I should really come back to eve and try some pvp. The one thing I couldn‚Äôt get the hang of.
---
&gt; but at the end of it's cycle it inflicts 10% of the total damage it's caused to itself
---
This is actually kind of a cool idea for a module.
---
Yeah but it's a special edition.
---
Credit for that feature all goes to Kadesh! It's indeed pretty cool. He had the idea of going even further and replacing with "better" modules that are cheaper, but unfortunately the logic CCP provides for determining something being better is flawed.
---
Nopoors
---
I remember my only solo kill... I was when... On no wait, I died then, too.
---
Oh man, the first of many.   
---
My favorite set of screen shots is a small pvp gang that war decd us on a gate. It was my first time running covops for my Corp maybe in '03- First picture is the enemy fleet in position on the gate with dscan, second is the same gate with a dscan of all corpses and my Corp mates happily cleaning up the lewt.  
---
Small pvp used to be so much fun.
---
Angel keepstar that goes as fast as a dramiel and is immune to web/scram
---
Not meaningless at all.  Taking pleasure in gaming is time and money well spent.  Also, decloaking on top of an Imicus is reason to get up in the morning.  I prefer a cloaked Sabre and lots of patience in a Relic site.  Excellent source for Sisters launchers and a modest but useful isk stream.
---
Keep up the holy purging of the Imicus threat!
---
Ok ty
---
ripperoni and cheese
---
That's actually a good kill, those explo herons can be slippery to pin down :) 
---
The nevernudes rose up!
---
need to bob with my rus tunes ))
---
Well said o7
---
Is that all you have? Shit man - this is low effort even for you.
---
On the bright side you can add "driving an alliance into the ground" to your EVE-resume. Also are you and Judy related because I just realized you two sound almost identical
---
Don't sell yourself short!! First kills are awesome!! I am still waiting for my first solo kill, but as a krabber, I don't get the opportunity very often and I am terrible at pvp unless I have an FC telling me "what do"  Well done!!! o7
---
It was a better time because we had time to shower and pee while servers were down. I wonder if there is a correlation between Eve players average body odor and downtime shortening.
---
Rise Of The Nevernudes^TM, they are never unclothed, their cupboards are always full. They carry a *third* set of spares, they are dressed up to the eyeballs everywhere.

I know the feeling. I still have the frozen corpse of my first solo kill. I‚Äôve hauled it with my other belongings through two corp/alliance changes.

Well a non AT ship version
---
Not really, we arent doing anything serious, just dicking around.  A little pressure with bombers, and some troll toasting is about it.  Funny thing is frat is already "redlighting" krabbing if we undock more than a dozen guys, and morale pinging around twice a day.
---
Hearty Congratulations!  I do hope that whenever I am caught and killed, an epic "selfie" like this is taken.
---
PS. Heron's are also awesome!
---
I dumpstered the last one we had at our unit thank god.  I lived OE 254 life
---
haha yeah. with one injector its not too bad but with triage for example, yeah, usually dumping them into the inventory is more kind on eyes/apm. kinda forces you to be aware of it tho instead of zoning in on targets and not noticing your booster ran out. could have preheated my hardeners as well but i bumped a fair bit and felt safe. they started shooting revs for whatever fuckin reason. lmao
---
This saves so much time spent manually clicking each variation and checking the price, it‚Äôs incredible.
---
did you read the: faster with low sig?
---
you could add a "takes 90% less damage from fighters" also.
---
i just described the general idea. 
---
and just relying on dreads for that purpose sounds bad. every ship should have counterplays, if the counterplay to caps is caps, I think we missed something.
---
also: this ship should not be able to take down a super fleet with only 50 dudes. but at least trade fairly. the "subcaps" should not be able to fight caps, starts to piss me off... why not?! thats exactly what makes subcap fights so cool, a small group of destroyers can fuck up a battleship fleet quite good. of course not destroy it, but trade good and cause permanent annoyance.
---
cap fleets don't have that, period.
---
i have to pick a profile for all my acc's everytime i restart the launcher (1-2 times/day)
---
the profiles saves all window positions, slots layout and drone groups etc on all ships you use on that profile 
---
so yeah you have to pick a profie everytime you start the launcher untill ccp makes the launcher save them again BUT apperently its super hard to do it 
---
Fit a **medium** shield extender, not a shield booster. The rats are not your main threat, and your passive shield regen should be plenty. You want buffer and resists for if a ganker shows up to ruin your day.
---
Words are hard...
---
he never said they were there for any objective. Just to shoot idiots. Win or lose they will shoot at idiots. 
---
Thanks, will do
---
Yes. You can freely roam in their space and expect not to be shot (but only by Provi Bloc members).
---
Relic Sites, however, is something only members belonging to the sovereignty owner of a given system can run. If you are running a relic there and a Provi character lands there they might ask you to leave or shoot you.
---
At least this is how it was a few years ago.
---
I would advise you when you gain experience to just roam hostile space in the north or south where you have either Guristas or Sansha loot and avoid the choke points that are camped. Even better - use wormhole connections that will bring you back to empire space once you have 100-200 worth of loot.
---
And use WHs again that will take you to those regions 
---
Be interesting to see how Test would be able to handle this "war" or skirmish whatever you want to call it if goons decide to not answer the batphone calls anymore after the recent developments.  Guessing it gets smoothed out, but if not who knows maybe we see a TEST+the North coalition if the relationship with imperium sours any further lol.
---
Pyfa for life!
---
I agree with OP. Mobile Depots are a botting scourge and it seems to be getting worse in certain areas of space. Personally I believe they should not adhere to the reinforcement model rather  give them something like 100k hp (which would hopefully deter the casual griefer) and allow open season on them. I would imagine that their abundance causes a degree of server load that would improve if we set about wiping them out. Maybe allocate a new skin if you kill x many. Mobile depots. Hate them.
---
Hi.  Former resident of Provi that lived there for years (sad i Know)
---
OH Provi residents totally will shoot neutrals.  they claim NRDS but don't fallow it and CVA doesn't Enforce it.  hell after legacy Co  took provi back from PL.   Provi can't even claim being Neutral.  
---
If you go to provi, don't expect not to be shot,  and defend yourself accordingly  
---
The nodes were heavily defended....by goons and unspoken.
---
Should this post be called shit?
---
What war, mate and what is the pandas and dynos (no ' between o and s btw) reference?

That is freaky awesome. I am at about the 3 month point, sounds like about where you were. I have sat on my perch overlooking a relic site, scared to death to pounce on that Heron. May need to hit you up for some tips.
---
- RCboi got tackled in Nyx. 
---
- Provi drops dreads

- RCbois drop subs and dreads

- Provi keeps dropping in dreads. Kill RCbois dreads

-RCbois retreat. Provi holds grid

The traditional gatecamps that were camped 24/7 like Tama and Jan are dead, but you should not bet on that.
---
Ships do jump those gates every now and then.
---
Not meaningless in anyway, the great thing about eve and hunting. The rush does not only exist with expensive "elite" kills, I still get the rush now after killing something solo no matter what I fly.  CONGRATZ! and you now found the addictive part of eve that adrenalin fill moment. 
---
Joining one of the major newbro friendly groups in Eve is super easy.
---
So join them and then learn how to PvP in frigates and destroyers, worry about earning isk at a later stage as you progress your skills to more expensive ships in the cruiser class 
---
I actually think you can get a Hel out of this 
---
A new kind of destroyer able to equip a distortion probe launcher that would be able to attract bosons fired within x kilometers of it.  [Kinda like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzJv2dCJ2xk)

---
Dumb but cute.
---
Yeah. What he didn't take into account is that I barely log in my main since I have about 100 characters. I probably left a few corpses during dreadbombs but I dont think someone has 5 of them. Might as well join and get a Hel.
---
Not disagreeing there. What I'm saying is that the typical blob fleet chatter to line members is literally "shoot this" during the actual combat. Nothing about that is opsec.
---
Perfect. Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet, Brave Newbies, Dreddit, Eve Uni can all help you learn this.
---
Theres mjd ravens, theres cerbs.... wtf are you even talking about?
---
Whether Test baited these dreads out our not isn't the point.  The point is 2 dead Titans, 8 dead Hels, along with 20+ Fax's.....  If Test baited this out, they need to train on baiting really badly
---
If you believe you needed 6 months worth of ravens to evict ~100 folks you're a brainlet. They could have cynod onto the hole at zero in their bombers and pre-seeded 3 freighters worth of ravens and had a pretty easy fight.
---
I‚Äôd like a way to clear all my personal ship fits at once
---
NPSI fleets - Spectre Fleet, Bombers Bar, Bjorn Bee's fleets when he is streaming and the likes.
---
But you need to like be on comms at least for the duration of the ops.
---
Fir soli I'd advise you to roam factional warfare lowsec, but like 6 months ago. Nowadays this area is barren and not even close to what it used to be.
---
He's talking about the old, OLD 24h skill queue. When EVE players were REAL men (m/f).
---
Wait wait, slow down. All I've got so far is '1. Remove LP.'
---
praise bob!
---
Good to hear the CSM is on top of things. Hostiles should not be able to use our own structures to funnel loot out of our space.
---
Honestly, this is precisely the kind of content I expected to find on r/eve when I first started, and this is the content we need more of on this subreddit. Not the propaganda (although I enjoy propaganda/shitposts), but this. 
---
Good job on your kill. I'm still waiting for my first legit solo kill. 
---
TEST Vs. All of EvE
---
Good hunting, Ace!
---
Yes please. Gimme a BC sized Cynabal nao.
---
Yes then use bait citadels to catch them moving unsupported
---
Nice work mate.
---
Haters gonna hate.
---
Chill fam. Yes they're good -  I was speaking in hyperbole. But when you can fleet warp to a ping before they apply, they're just not as good as guns for fleet fighting.
---
Great movie btw

Plexing refers to the act of running faction war complexes to increase your faction's control over a system and/or make money in the form of LP that can be redeemed at the faction's store.

Story time! Give us the rundown please.

I've been using yapi lately as it more accurately describes them (after a phone autocorrect)

Nah man you always remember your first

True story: my first KM was Vily in a Crow i n 3T7- back in 2006

Totally not bitter yapi dinoposter btw
---
Who's test, do you mean tapi?
---
Wait, a "diplomatic" announcement not filled with spins and bullshit talk about peace and prosperity in a game about blowing up spaceships?!? What is this?!?
---
OP is the kind of diplomat this game needs.
---
Correct, it's just super satisfying to smug post after dumpstering them so hard
---
Projecting much?

is there an easy way to have profiles for max alphas?

Cool, I heard hy likes someone who spits at him rather than swallows, should improve your next "leadership" meeting.

Holy shit you posted something self aware.
---
This was me a month ago, started playing in 2004, but never PvPed until this month.  Went from getting excited for killing a frigate during a crazy 4 way battle in null that I stumbled into, and now less than a month later I'm sitting on 256 kills.  
---
It really is a whole different game.  Everybody was right when they said to get out of highsec.
---
Creating your own content and doing it all by yourself is worth more than being one in a fleet of 100s or 1000s. Well done!

Everyone is just pretending that it's not unreasonable to have "1-2" accounts of anything you can think of. 1-2 super accounts? Sure! 1-2 faxes? Why not? 1-2 hunters, scouts, and cyno accounts? obviously! I think that's completely unreasonable and you are confusing characters that don't need to be simultaneously logged in with accounts that do.
---
Let's say you have 3 hunter accounts - by the way, one of the more reasonable roles to split across accounts. Are you actively hunting with 3 accounts? You're probably not doing a very good job with any of them. You're also lighting up intel like a christmas tree. Are most of them cloaky camping? Obviously that has to be spread out for account. But if they are logged off in system, you log in to check for targets, and then log out if nothing juicy is there - you don't need 3 accounts unless you're trying to shut down two constellations by your lonesome. Sure you *can* do it. But it's wildly inefficient and most people, even most hardcore PvP'ers, won't. Same with tackle alts. If you need 3 tackle alts in addition to your subcap toons or cap toons on a fleet, odds are you're doing a shitty job at 5 jobs instead of a good job at 2-3. 
---
Or the guy that forgot to pay the alliance bills.

Or the many guys that clicked jump instead of bridge.

Or the many many guys that talked shit and got their corp/alliance hit.
---
A personal assets tab that shows only ships to speed up searching of "I swear I had a ship around this region somewhere, on which alt is it? ffs"
---
The technique grandparent recommended is a misuse of the asset safety and dropbox mechanics. The player council is lobbying the developer to close the loophole.
---
No Dino logic plz

Copy all 5 character and then set the copy as an alpha
---
Apparently they weren‚Äôt suppose to have caps in eso. Their discord went to shit. Good times 
---
If you want to work towards incursions, I know that WTM accepts Rokh pilots into fleet. The Rattlesnake is a strong PVE missile boat that sees some use in incursions, as well as sleeper ratting if you decide to commit to wormholes, although that ship belongs to the Guristas faction, and will thus require you to train Gallente battleship skills as well. If you find yourself committed to incursions, the Sansha‚Äôs Nation Nightmare battleship is one of the endgame ships, but it requires both Amarr and Caldari skills, as well as training into lasers. 
---
A word of warning though‚Äîthe race of your character has little to no bearing on what you fly. A piece of advice that you‚Äôll no doubt hear repeated in your time on these forums is that you should figure out exactly what you want to do, and then work backwards to an appropriate ship, rather than choosing a pretty boat and trying to make it work for your trade (although it does seem that you‚Äôve learned that already!)
---
i accidentally took the pvp gate in a tier 3 abyssal in some shit fit gila. I have no idea what crazy fucking black magic fuckery this game has going for it but i could swear i was having a heart attack. The feeling never goes away man. Grats on your first and here's to the next 100.

I really need to create a compilation gif of tooltips blocking useful info, or tooltips that say the same thing as what you're hovering over.
---
It‚Äôs surprising the amount of times you can catch someone with double webs + prop or even just double webs no prop (coercer) and no point and they never warp off. Partly because the average dude doesn‚Äôt check for pointed. And then there double webbed and being anihilated it doesn‚Äôt matter by the time they realized it because they‚Äôre dead anyways

Congrats, the first kill is the first solo kill is the most memorable. I remember my first kill. I killed an SB with a BC, got jumped by a T3C and lost the BC but saved my pod, all in wspace. I was yelling for half an hour and my arms started falling asleep. Keep up the corpse collecting, it's another fun hobby that goes well with hunting.

Some chick has her house damaged by a natural disaster. The insurance company refuses to pay out claiming force majeure. She logs into EVE and cries on comms for an hour, so one of her mates hooks her up with a lawyer who takes on her case pro bono and forces the insurance company to pay out. Tuned out after that.
---
Something that ignores dmg cap on citadels, thinking easy to kill with a fleet, hard to kill with a citadel thinking dread mechanics on a sub cap that can move with fleet but costs enough to dissuade solo use.

Congrats! I remember my first kill. May this one be the first of many in your Eve life. Win or lose, try to learn something from each battle!
---
Really cool, enjoyed watching. Thanks for this.
---
Because it‚Äôs bad and inefficient. 
---
Manual piloting most of the time(actually all the time wtf did j just write) refers to clicking in space to direct you ship, rather than relying on along points or the ship commands (orbit, keep at range, approach), often used in combination with kiting ships to use the speed and agility they have to literally fly circles around your opponent. 
---
Chessur(Back before he sold his character and quit) made some pretty decent videos (I think) explaining WHY this is good https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke3ROIFB3Ms
---
Definitely worth a watch, might lead to a lot of trial by fire deaths until you figure it out, but once you do it‚Äôs a great feeling of flying in Eve. 
---
Can you link a BR, not just the link to the system for the folks that aren‚Äôt reading this thread in real time it‚Äôs a lot harder to see exactly what‚Äôs going on.

YOU JUST WANT KITING TO BE UNCOUNTERBAKLRE FUCK I SPILLE DMY MCDONALDS XL COLA FUCKFUCKFUCK
---
I got my first solo kill the same way, Astero vs a Probe on a JSpace data site. It's a hell of a rush. "Is it bait? Am I the only guy stalking him? Can I catch him before he warps?" And then you decloak, you get the lock, the scram, drones out, and you see his little exploration ship crumble and dammit now I want to go hunt some herons too but I'm stuck at work
---
Now, ON TO THE FURTHER EXTERMINATION OF THE HERON MENACE!
---
I can't think of a more nightmarish thing
---
Hello, fellow dino!
---
Good luck getting thunder fucked by the likes of tapi lmao
---
It's ok, I'm here for you
---
Just breath and think happy database thoughts
---
I got my own first true solo kill a week or two ago - warped into a bubble near a gate in an Atron, and a Nemesis was in the bubble.  Not really a fair fight...
---
The odd part is I wasn't particularly excited, as I wasn't looking for him - I was moving to join a fleet and just ran into him.  It was my good deed for the day, as he had two wrecks in/near the bubble with him.
---
Not sure who's bubble it was though - might have been dropped by a blue that he killed.  But the Atron was just too small.
---
Oh, I don't mean using them at once, that would be crazy ineffective; it's more about having them ready and available exactly where and when they're needed - giving you freedom to get to a certain point regardless of circumstances (like trying to not scare away your target, not having to try and get through a gatecamp, not trying to safelog when someone's combat probing you etc). I tend to keep 2-3 hunter alts on each of my hunter accounts, with those alts being seeded/staged in faraway parts of EVE universe, as a result it means I can any of those logged and usable whenever that's needed, since there should be no reason to, say, relog an account to switch between alt seeded into Deklein and Omist.
---
You can think of it more as a workaround for jumpclone timer and inability to jumpclone between inspace locations more than using multiple hunter characters at exactly same time. In fact, one case I found it be impossible to replace was having one alt to be used for active hunt and at the same time get second alt to just anchor a bubble in line to citadel/gate in next system over and sit there cloaked in case I had to force my target through a gate - and that is something you need to actively prepare for in one way or another, even when just solo blopsing.
---
No, this just pushes away the few that are now left in FW.
---
It's uncanny how this was my exact thought process.  
---
"it seems far too easy...surely I don't actually have the drop on someone?"  
---
The rush from getting the lock before he realised what was happening, and the rush from anticipating a bigger fish dropping on me and the sinking feeling that I'd taken bait.

Related to this, is there an easy way to set up a character profile with all of the skills a completely fresh character has? (Like rather than an All 0 profile, a 'this is what you actually start the game with' profile?) I've been building a lot of new player/alpha fits recently and I found myself wanting this.

Good for solo pvp unless you are a ratting carrier or battleship, in that case you will find a cyno on grid followed by a group of angry t2 battleships
---
Faction warfare has a bunch of com**plex**es that you can capture to try and take control of the system.  Capturing or defending a plex rewards FW Loyalty points which can be traded in at a FW station,  Navy cap boosters, ammo, and ships are some of the main goods.

40m per month? Is that HS? I make that per week per character with my low - effort setup
---
It‚Äôs not the best way to do it though imo. Maybe you think it‚Äôs great and works for you, but for me I‚Äôve got my left hand working module shortcuts, right hand on mouse to navigate + use overview.  Taking my hand off the mouse to use arrow keys to fly and then back to mouse to use overview seems like a waste of time to me. But if you like it, more power to you.
---
If you want to explore in a heron you can configure it so that it warps in less than 2 seconds (anything under 2 is the same). That way if you pay attention to the overview you don't need to pre-align, just have an orbital selected and click warp. Only way you can be caught is if there's a warp bubble being dropped.
---
That moment when ppl still can't differentiate between the nullsec CODE aka goryn clade and the HS meme wing.
---
Cringe.
---
Suddenly signal cartel becomes major nullsec power despite still following their credo?
---
That's the thing about prophecy. As long as a prophecy is vague enough, pretty much *any* event can be hammered and beaten into a shape vaguely resembling it.
---
Given that CCP haven't bothered to print the entire text of Macaper's prophecy in fifteen years, I'm not confident that their current lore writers even remember it exists.
---
Orca sized ship with orca tank, no jump drive, can use light fighters. Call it an escort carrier
---
If your prey is concentrating on the mini game then add a good second onto that time and if you're in a cloaky fit they should be toast. Or at least a warm bagel.
---
PLs new keepstar in lowsec. Not sure where exactly. Provi? Or close to it.
---
You are right, the battle Orca is the King of the HiSec battlefield. But not anyone can handle it.
---
Some thoughts: 
---
A mining ship that has a doomsday for rocks on it, like a 15 minute cycle time for 80k m3.
---
Kamikaze ships / Something that can deplete hull to increase DPS (like overheat but at cost of EHP)

Modular Ships, where 3 or 4 pilots can come together in ships to provide more firepower or stronger boosts

Hey, I've been talking about the Jaguar with CCP Rise a little because it's clear that the Jaguar is over-encroaching on Interceptor/Tackler roles and is frustrating to a lot of players, since as mentioned it has near interceptor damage mitigation and speed while also having all of the benefits of being the hardiest advanced frigate class. It's seen as generally 'strong but fair' for 1v1/small gang outside of this role. Your suggestions all seem to be reasonable.   
---
I think there are some important avenues of discussion to be had here specifically away from the Jaguar itself. And I'd like to foster some discussion.   
---
**Ancillary Shield Boosters**: Do you think it makes sense to simply limit them as a max as 1 per ship instead? Currently this is how the Armor and the Ancillary Remote Armor/Shield Repair modules work, active shield boosters are currently the only 'ancillary' module that breaks these rules. Limiting them to be 1 per ship is a discussion that was put out there when the Capital variety was limited to 1 to help balance FAX/Rorquals that were abusing them to gain near immunity to energy neutralisers.
---
Obviously at the time I pointed out, and the community too that this would break some existing fits, such as Dual XLASB Battleships, Dual MASB Frigates in FW mostly, and the occasional Dual-Large ASB fit.   
---
I think if some follow-up work was done to ASBs that currently could use some work (SASBs!! maybe LASB) This would probably be something that would be positive overall?   
---
Also if the Jaguar was nerfed, would you still be worried about other AFs in similar roles? Like Ram Enyos, or is the fact that they are more dependent on capacitor for their tank making them more reasonable to deal with.   
---
This post makes me want to get an astero again. I started out in pvp wondering why I got killed exploring as well. 
---
Mostly, yes. This is due to the fact that you can actually shoot the same thing many times with different ships before it dies, so the game has to make assumptions and basically do its best, which isn't always enough. I've had ? next to my name on killmails I appeared on but was dead when the final blow was struck.
---
I don't see my name there. Please show us on the doll where we touched you
---
For people who don't know:
---
Blobs are Large OBjects in a database. These can be a few thousand characters, to millions of characters.
---
% is a wildcard. So that query mentioned (LIKE '%...%') is searching every row in that table, in the potentially massive column, in a way which cannot be optimized past 'look at everything'. 
---
It may not be the worst kind of query (I'm looking at you, cartesian products on tables with millions to billions of rows), but if you've got any serious amount of data, it will _kill_ performance.
---
And you'll normally find out about if when a new application has been developed, tested with a bare minimum of data, and then deployed live. And you're expected to look after it.
---
/me starts sharpening knives. 
---
Mmmm. Now I want a bagel.
---
This would definitely hurt the triple ancil rep fit, although you might be able to fit a t2 ancil current router or two and be fine. 
---
You‚Äôd also have to look at all sorts of t1 destroyers and frigs, both for newbro pve and FW lowsec, because more ships exist than the faction/t2 that most of us nullseccers fly. 
---
But really, ceptors can already go 6km/second. Even a heated jag with dual nanos won‚Äôt break 5km/s. Combine that with nullification and ceptors have a purpose still. Maybe just drop the base speed or increase the mass if you want to slow jaguars down, it would definitely be easier than rebalancing a whole module 
---
Ok so is there an ACTUAL BR? or do we need to keep linking these shit BR Reports and just guess wtf happened?
---
One always remembers one's first... good job!
---
A cruiser which can put up its own POS shield.
---
Starbursting your enemies while protecting your allies with your own health.
---
A terrible idea, but it‚Äôll be real fun to pop the POS on the Jita undock.
---
Try goons
---
Congrats, you lasted about 3 minutes into a 1hr talk. 
---
The issue isn't that jaguars outclass ceptors in every role, it's that jaguars outclass ceptors in any form of role that involves running down a MWD fit ship to such a level that all but the strongest anti-frigate setups are completely out of the meta. The nullification and ~10% extra speed at the cost of above cruiser levels of tank is simply not worth it.
---
Delve is Blood Raider space though, which is about as opposite from Amarr space as you can get.
---
Not if the Dinos keep fighting Snuff. 
---
Umm maybe CCP should make a Caldari Minnie fation instead of bringing in a entierly new one and nerfing the rest of eve to force everyone to fly these new ships AND DEAR FUCKING GOD MAKE ANGEL CAPS. CCP just finish one thing you promise us.... that is all i ask...
---
Have you bug reported it?
---
If you have, can I get the EBR number?
---
thanks for having a meltdown in a reddit thread, it was semi-entertaining. 
---
I‚Äôve had way more luck in Esoteria/Paragon. Sure, you don‚Äôt have the npc stations, but there is less competition, less gatecamps, and less cloaked cyno bombers camping sites
---
I remember my first kill hunting explorers...this game holds a special place in my heart because of the thrill of a successful solo hunt. I started hunting mission runners in low sec with a Proteus not long after my first few explorer kills. This game really can't be beat imo when it comes to the thrill of hunting.
---
I'm currently showing 28,300ish people online.
---
If you explore in stain you will need to be omega, have covops cloak trained, and know how to avoid gatecamps, in addition to looking up everyone in local on zkill before doing a site. 
---
As an alpha, stick to wormholes, very few gatecamps there, a cloak won‚Äôt help you anyway if you get ambushed while doing sites
---
Exploration is probably the most lucrative at your level. Looting relic sites can yield a few hundred mill over the course of an evening if you get lucky. 
---
Some other good lowskill income streams are salvaging wrecks left behind by more veteran players, and sneaking into wormholes in a venture to huff gas.
---
You can anom rat in a Dominix if you want to fly a cheap battleship.
---
Pretty sure he wasn't serious =)
---
A frig that can scan down cloaked ships in a system, no tank or weapon modules, scanning takes quite a while and sends a warning to all in system.
---
A neut is all you need to escape a jag, or just scram/web/blasters. Triple rep means no nos, so you pull range and transversal drops to almost 0 while the mwd is off, and if they have a nos a dual rep won‚Äôt last long against short range guns
---
No disrespect to the presenter. Dunno what your problem is with my dispassionate teaser.
---
I would give anything for this. GTFO out of our space, Orcling!
---
you're dumb lol
---
Ai carramba!
---
Hahaha
---
did you contact snuff?
---
Literal kamikaze ships would be dope too. Like, a module that lets you self-destruct to deal AOE damage lol.
---
And your last point ... are you suggesting ... Voltron?
---
Is the orca considered a cap? I don't know the ORE ship heirarchy very well.
---
I remember certain someone who shot his own alliances' ratting supers if they were out during ops... I wonder if Vily just hired us to do his dirty work...
---
They are. But whose going to use a huge drug hull? Drug smugglers. I'm all for it.
---
Yes plz.
---
My first kill was a heron as well!  
---
In retrospect I wish I'd never gotten it. 
---
That‚Äôs how you do it. Wtb evesterdam kiki skin btw 
---
So your solution to the jag 'problem' is to:
---
1. Apply a *28%* nerf to powergrid, rendering the ship incapable of making a useful fit without faction fitting modules due to having the single lowest powergrid of any combat frigate in the game. (Your jag: 31. Astero (a droneboat): 33. Every other combat frigate: at least 35.)
---
2. Remove the utility high that every single AF has.
---
3. Apply a *20%* nerf to velocity, rendering a *minmatar* AF the second *slowest* speed AF in the game, with a base MWD speed of only 2700 m/s. (Retribution: 2660 m/s. Every other AF: at least 2780. It also gives it the worst agility of all AFs.)
---
4. Globally increase the PG cost of a balanced module by 25%, breaking a whole bunch of fits. (I don't know what fits *you* tested, but I looked through my saved fits and 3/4 of the ones with a MASB would be broken by your change. Were you looking only at AB fw fits or something?)
---
I think I'll give this one a thumbs down. You don't want to nerf the jag, you want to delete it.
---
They use Dual NOS it's impossible to neut off the scram btw.

Great plan to take it slow. Too many folks are eager to rush headlong in search of an 'endgame' instead of enjoying the ride. Spoiler: once you've done everything there's not much left to do and it's boring. AFK mining is not the answer though. There are plenty of lucrative activities that are also highly engaging.

---
On a completely unrelated topic - WTB 40 Revs and 20 Nags in Stain...
---
Yeah so in the end I want my main ISK making activity/grinding to PVE, so ratting, mission running, and most of all incursions. I have interest in PVP but have little to no experience in it so not sure where I wanna go from there and gonna try to find a Corp to help me with that. But I have a general idea on the direction I wanna go pve and isk making wise which is a start.
---
Everyone also keeps saying exploration/WH so may look a bit into that too and see if it peaks any interest.
---
&gt; Ancillary Shield Boosters: Do you think it makes sense to simply limit them as a max as 1 per ship instead? Currently this is how the Armor... modules work, active shield boosters are currently the only 'ancillary' module that breaks these rules.
---
It's important to note that ancillary shield boosters do not behave similarly to regular shield boosters the way ancillary armor reppers behave similarly to regular armor reppers.
---
Ancil armor reppers are basically just 'regular armor reppers, but better while they have paste', and so there is no reason why they can't be mixed with regular armor reppers. Ancil shield boosters behave completely different from regular ones in terms of the constraints they put on a fit, and there is no reasonable way to mix the two. As such, AARs being limited to one works. ASBs being limited to one would break the module for anything that doesn't have an existing ASB that's the appropriate size for them to use only one. (This includes destroyers, battleships, some BCs, and some frigates.)
---
This is another example of breaking things by changing something globally to fix a single problem.
---

Don't train niche ships that you're emotionally invested in. It'll just lead to you feeling dissatisfied when your FC doesn't call for it. Train commonly used stuff like dictor and command destroyer and your mainline doctrines. Once you've got a hangar full of that stuff you can think about adding a Bhaalgorn.

In what world a "short range cruiser" burning through a frigate that can hold you for 45 seconds and goes 4220 m/s cold is "not tanking much"?

People are too concerned with isk in this game. Their wallet balance, their killboard ratios, the value of their kills. Remember what it's like to be this guy: achieving a kill by yourself, the risk involved, the effort and patience it takes to stalk your prey and get the jump on them. Anything that goes wrong is on you. Instead of sitting in the safety of a tether until a hunter gets a cyno up and the FC calls jump, get out there and shoot your own stuff. (I need to do more of this but...real life)

---
Cmon mate. Link you killmail like a dank pvp lord!
---
Thx for the great work, pyfa is thumbsupemoji
---
So, a few things to discuss here.
---
1. I'm not opposed to limiting ASB's to one per ship, however, if you want people to use T2 shield boosters with a cap booster, they actually need to be good for the fitting they're using. Similar to how T2 armor reps are decent and not something you skip over and go straight to deadspace stuff. This comes back to tiericide (Which CCP says they are going to start doing again). So if ASB's are set to 1 per ship, a look at the shield modules should come along with it. Also, i'd look into reducing ASB fitting if only 1 per ship is allowed, this would actually make the "Ancillary" and not something you use and sacrifice all your fitting for. SASB's either need to be removed or get a decent buff as well, they're worthless.
---
2. While ASB's can be strong in certain situations, i feel like the Jag is not strong "Just" because of ASB. I needs to lose some of its damage mitigation, which you said yourself (and others) its comparable to interceptors. I was actually somewhat surprised by the jag's sig and how small it is with shield mods. The typical ram jag sits at 119m sig. A fair nerf to the jag would be to give it a larger signature, which would mean more damage applied and would help to kill them faster. Another fair nerf is to make it weaker to ECM, so some pocket sand ECM drones will disrupt a lot of ram jags. Though that may make them too weak to any frigate with some random EC drones, would need further review tbh.
---
3. The ADCU itself feels a bit too strong on frigates. Its nearly perfect on cruisers, but frigate fights are so quick and bloody, the "invuln" time of the ADCU is just too long. In correlation with the jag, this provides it too much of window to just ram with impunity. So maybe consider reducing ADCU time in half and then give HAC's a role bonus of increasing ADCU time to allow them the same time they have now on ADCU operation.
---
Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate

Am confused and aroused.

Its okay, we already killed more in ihubs than our forts are worth. We can get new forts, all your renters will join PIBC because we won't shoot them. In the end we still win.

---
As I've spent more time in Eve, I've found my preference to fly almost exclusively tackle. (Assuming the standard Dual ASB fit) The ramjag is definitely strong, but it doesn't overshadow interceptors. It offers a very specific role in being able to maintain fast tackle on a grid with rlmls. The dual ASB jag still has many weaknesses such as required meta points for fitting, can't maintain a long point due to cap issues, very little buffer with a larger sig than a ceptor, kinetic hole in the resist profile, and weakness to defensive scrams/nuets. If the jag is allowed to get a scram off, it can tank a single mjolnir rlml orthrus clip. However, most competent small gangs easily counter with extended scram on a garmur/orthrus/keres, sentinel with nuets, or a couple jackdaws loaded with scourge.
---
Against any comp that doesn't contain rlmls, ceptors reign supreme. Lower sig, faster, extended point range, no cap issues maintaining long point, and nullified
---
Without an answer for tackle on a grid with kitey gangs loaded with rlmls, the natural go to is recons with long webs/points complimented with snipey doctrines such as corms. This usually just forces small gangs off grid and no fight occurs. I'd rather have a dangerous anti-rlml tackle solution (ramjag) which allows the fight to still occur than the nuclear option of just bring caps or recons+snipey stuff that just causes a disengagement.
---
I do agree with touching back the speed of the jag, but only that. Right now the jag serves a niche role that is very different to a ceptor. The reason it's so prevalent is just because of the prevalence of anti-tackle small gangs that don't allow ceptors to be on grid (rlmls)

Not sure I'm convinced this is a good idea. BUT, there would be 9 systems contestable in that region if they chose to go this way: Aldrenette, Vlillirier, Renarele, Moclinamaud, Aubenall, Frarie, Vey, Intaki, Agoze are all bordering an enemy system.

Got my first kill when I accidentally orbit someone and they shot me I had no idea what I was doing so I fought back killed then warped away
---
I don't think touching the tank is the solution, nerfbat the tank and velocity and the jag becomes useless again. It's filling a very niche role atm that a ceptor can't fill. Touch back the speed to still retain being the faster AF (minmatar) although not as dominant. It will still have a niche role different to ceptors, but make ceptors the go to solution when a anti-rlml tackle solution isn't required.

Second slowest AF maybe, but if it's fielding the most tank of any AF at the same time, I'd say that's a reasonable tradeoff. The retribution has to sacrifice all durability to get that speed, for example.

---
I don't think ASBs need such a broad nerf just for the jag. Frankly, it doesn't even need the ASBs. Consider the following example:
---
Just the other day I was roaming Pure Blind and engaged a Russian gang in an RHML Typhoon. A malediction was coming at me but the rest of their gang hadn't arrived, so I banked on rushing for a grapple and killing him quick*:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75863464/
---
I got snagged by a sabre bubble and pointed by some more inties, but no biggy**. Then a jag came in. I still had a good number of missiles and tried for the kill. Here's his fit (from Sep 2018):
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75863477/
---
Now I didn't get the kill, but I don't think his fit changed that much since he wasn't boosting for a bit after I neuted him. The problem was he was able to facetank WITHOUT ADC (since I saw him activate it after I put drones on but before I put missiles) and WITHOUT boosting (mostly, I ran out of missiles before I got another neut in) while grappled at 0.
---
I probably would have [died anyway](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75863477/), but still. The point is, **sig radius is probably the biggest issue**. A cruiser weapon system (admittedly weaker but also rapid-firing) failed to take him out in time regardless of ADC and shield booster. (And all he really had to do was plow into me and wait for me to die.)
---
*plus it'd make me isk-positive with that ship and I was insured so DGAF.
---
**I'd like to point out it took a ridiculously long time to lock any of these frigates even with no EWAR on me. ccpls buff BS sensors.
---
Leave the jag alone, maybe your the problem. Jags and AF's in general are in a good place at the moment. Stop whining and get good.
---
Will further ship customization ever come to Eve online like we see in Star Trek Online? The paint jobs are nice, but some ships have warts I would like removed and other ships I feel would benefit by looking more chaotic and free design to exemplify a tribal feel. 
---
I've been doing level 3 security missions. How do I know what drive damage type to prioritize and which passive resistances to prioritize for the pirates?
---
True. But it's at least slight more engaging as you'll have to turn on TWO modules instead of one :P
---

They are special waste filtering swim trunks. All that virtual alcohol has to go somewhere...It's stored then recycled to make food for various large alliances.

---
That solo fit requires a faction MAPC. If you need a faction fitting module *and* compacting literally every single PG and CPU module except the scram *and* need a 3% PG implant, something is wrong. That's not an example of these changes being balanced, that's a very strong argument that these changes are *not* balanced.
---
I'd also note that the jag is also the worst DPS assault frig. I don't think it's fair for it to be cursed with terrible speed *and* terrible fitting *and* terrible dps for the unforgivable sin of actually posing a threat to kity nano gangs. (I'll also note that the  only slower AF, the Retribution, has the best-in-class combination of dps and projection of all AFs along with a huge amount of base HP and great resists making it less squishy than it ought to be even in a kite fit.)
---
Just from a quick look through my saved fits, it breaks MWD dual masb hawks, MWD dualtank breachers, MWD dual masb breachers, MWD dual masb jaguars that actually have guns, the stupid MWD dual masb hookbill I messed around with once, and the meme triple MASB jackdaw. I won't claim that all of these are necessarily the best things to do, but they're all at least theoretically usable fits that I have messed around with at some point. Like I said, it seemed to me like you hadn't looked at things with MWDs. 
---
If you want to nerf the ramjag, I'd start with sigrad, you could bump that up to 40 without affecting frigate fights basically at all but it would make it significantly more vulnerable to cruisers. Frankly, though, I don't think it needs much more than that. Just because you can't trivially RLML it off the field like everything else doesn't mean it needs to be nerfed into the ground so hard it'll come up in china. Long range control shuts it down, you just can't casually negate its threat with solely damage is all.
---
For 9 cycles of the ASBs, sure. A drake doesn't really fall into the realm where the Jag is overly oppressive, you'd have the same issue against the other active rep AFs.

It is a nice way to enjoy this game, of course. And mining, and industry, exploration, and so on. But the feeling that you got seconds before that you decloacked in that engage, is the most wonderful sensation that I've felt playing this game. It cannot be compared to any other activity in eve, imo. And that's just an heron. No billions in Killmail. But gallons of adrenalin in your veins. Well done!

&gt; Remove ventures stab core role bonus
---
I don't like the idea of nerfing a ship which is primarily used in entirely different contexts for the sake of it's unique bonus being abused in this one area. I honestly don't even see that many plexing ventures so I'm not even sure of how big this problem is. If if it is a problem just make venture not capable of running down the timer or exclude it from entering plexes. 
---
&gt; Make it so you can only plex in systems next to each other
---
I've had a somewhat similar idea of making the warzone smaller but make capturing and holding that smaller warzone for a period of time shift the warzone into enemy territory and out of yours. New enemy systems would become contested parts of the war zone and some of your own systems shirt out of it. That way total FW victories would feel like they're accomplishing some tangible change.
---
&gt; Make it so the combat tutorial ends with the newbro in a FW NPC corp 
---
I think the final interaction with the career agent should *encourage* you to join but it shouldn't make that decisions for you. I imagine something like: "Hey capsuleer, you've completed your combat training. You should consider going to system X in and join the glorious &lt;faction name&gt; militia fighting the nefarious &lt;enemy faction&gt;" In system X have them talk to a FW career agent that would give a couple of FW career missions to explain the mechanics: "go cap a defensive plex", "Fit a shipt with guns and cap an offensive plex", "donate some LP to a hub". 
---
The biggest flaw in the NPE isn't really in the NPE itself but the fact that so many players feel lost and directionless once it's over. They have no clue what they should do next and feel lost and directionless. Guiding such players who happen to be PvP oriented towards the FW NPC corp is a great next step and aid new player retentions (or it would if the developers gave FW a little love).
---
This is a perfect post and thank you for posting.  You will never forget your first.  :)
---
Gratsi!
---
I always cringe expecting a Stratios to uncloak and 'bigger fish' me. Hasn't happened yet though, fingers crossed.
---
Hey Suitonia, glad to hear there is an awareness of the issue!
---
I think Stitch K's comment about sig is one that I didn't really consider as a balancing factor, and definitely worth a look, especially if it means the speed/mass changes could be reasonably toned down a bit, to keep minmatar 'flavour'.
---
I posted this after discussion and testing/brainstorming for a while, and unifying 1 ASB/ship across all scales was one of the first suggestions put on the table. The pressure against doing so was mainly due to the midslot starvation that would exist if you were expected to fit shield booster/ancillary shield booster/cap booster to get a big burst and moderate sustained shield tank. It was this pressure that drove the more complicated changes I suggested in the OP.
---
I think active shield tanking more generally might need a look - the reason multiple ancillary fits are so prevalent and favoured is in good part because of how many fitting compromises, and slots, are required to get a solid standard shield tank, and how much more difficult it is to combine repair modules and buffer modules, due to this slot starvation (considering you also want propulsion, and tackle). 
---
A very simplistic comparison between an Armageddon and a Raven indicates that it's somewhere between 5 and 6 dedicated tanking module slots (including an injector in both cases) where the tanks are comparable, which in both cases leaves 3 mids free for prop/tackle. With 7 mid slots, there is no problem, and this parity of tank persists through rig us (em screen + 2 solidifiers vs 2 nano pump + accelerator), but if you consider less abundant slot layouts, it becomes an issue.
---
Comparing Thorax and Caracal (4M/5L and 5M/4L respectively), while you get comparable tanks using 5 slots (including cap injector for both again), and this persists through the same rig combinations, the shield tank is not remotely cap-stable once you add solidifiers, and the caracal only has 1 mid slot remaining for prop/tackle. As you remove modules, even dropping to a 4-slot tank is enough for the Thorax to have 30% higher EHP/s than the Caracal.
---
In a gang context this is all probably moot, as both fits would likely be buffer-based instead.
---
__TL:DR__
---
The minimum number of slots for tank parity between armor and shield needs to be reconsidered, because it is a prime driver between ancillary fits being so prevalent. Once this is addressed, 1 ASB per ship (with perhaps more forgiving fitting as Stitch_K suggested) would probably be a much more reasonable change.
---

The closest you can get to that is T3 cruisers, who's appearance changes based on what subsystem you are using. Beyond that I don't see that as a feature that will be added in the foreseeable future. There has been some concept art with ship appearance changing based on modules fit, such as haulers growing with cargo extenders fit. That appears to have been put on hold, and is no where on any publicly known road map.

---
Thanks for the fleshed out response :)
---
I'm just going to note that the Tomalak fit I'm referencing has all those compact modules already, so my only change was the faction MAPC, which doesn't add that much to the fits cost (50-&gt;60m). That said I recognise your point about that all being necessary being an extreme way to make it fit.
---
As I said in the OP, quite a lot of fits we looked at require a bit of a tweak of lows and rigs. Dual MASB mwd hawk was one of the fits we tested, and found to still work largely unchanged (https://pastebin.com/F16P6Nmd) but fully willing to recognise there may have been oversights! The driver behind the sum of the changes was to try and keep dual MASB fits still viable on some ships, because as suitonia has pointed out, the simplest fix is to just move to single ancillary shield of any size on any ship, like with armor.
---
As you may note in my reply to suitonia, in light of Stitch K's comment as well as yours on sig radius, that might be another lever to pull on so the speed reduction isn't as great, but at the moment they're fast enough to put interceptors out of a job, so they have to come down a bit regardless.
---
The ramjag being seen as a problem is due to the combination of tank and speed, and more broadly, of those two, the latter encroaches most on another class of ship's role, so that was why it was the focus, attacked in part through base stats, and part through making the dual MASB fit sacrifice a bit of potential speed for its durability.
---
Well I have been enjoying the model changes for many of the ships to bring more symmetrical. Especially for Amarr and Gallente since one is about perfection, the other is more organic.

The midweek changes based on outfitting seems like a cool idea. Thank you.

- You‚Äôre alone in the pod. Nobody‚Äôs looking at you. Why wear trunks?
---
- You‚Äôre in that pod, submerged in liquid, for bob knows how long. Wearing trunks is the most comfortable idea you can come up with?
---
- As soon as the pod is cracked the pilot is killed so that they can jump to their medical clone. Why would you need to wear anything?
---
I‚Äôm not trying to make a social statement. This is not about ‚Äòliberating minds‚Äô. This the applied practicality of being a pod pilot going through their daily routine. Wearing trunks seems stupid.
---
What is a ramjag?
---
I don't want to come across as dismissive, but I've got a few questions, because it sounds very much like you're defending the Jaguar from a position of defensive action, and because you've found in it a ship that lets you fly a role you enjoy (which I empathise with).
---
1) How much time have you spent on the kitey small gang side of this equation? 
---
I ask because it's much more obvious on the other side of this equation why the Jaguar needs tuning down. I think you'd find you understood where the complaints were coming from if you spent more time on this side.
---
How many other assault frigates or interceptors perform as the Jaguar does?
---
My point here is that it being so exceptionally well suited to such a tackle role (compared to the other 15 options across AF/inty) is highly indicative that it needs to be tuned down a bit.
---
Responding to your point about recons, they and ramjag have the same effect of forcing a disengage, but at least that's a 400m hull specifically bonused for the job, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. If a 5-10 man kitey gang focuses any small ship, it should die pretty fast, it's part of the tradeoff being made for their inability to hold on against more durable equivalently sized hulls.
---
Hello! Recruitment posts go over on /r/evejobs, Happy hunting!
---
That adrenaline rush doesn't wear off even after your 100th kill, but the first is always the most memorable.
---
Good work!
---
I just checked for fun, your last loss or killmail in cal/gal FW zone is 2 months ago, 23 zkillboard pages lmao.
---
you are active in amarmil zone though, but mostly in nullsec. you're qualified, but you did run away to sov null
---
If only there was some sort of gate to get from stain to the kind of space where FW is!
---
Fully functional web based fitting tool. Like pyfa, only on a website.

But why would TAPI be scouting an init group that far away when they're semi bluetral? It's not like PanFam was going to go help TAPI, so what was the point of attacking such a pointless structure as "bait"?
---
Is this another init pointlessly over-planning ruse?

Cloaky Sisters of Eve Destroyer with bandwidth to carry Medium Drones. All the other usual SOE bonuses otherwise.

Plus let‚Äôs have a SOE battlecruiser and SOE Caps while we‚Äôre at it.

Lore-wise maybe they‚Äôre built as a response to the rise of the Triglavians or something.

Cloaky?)

Pirate on, my friend, Pirate on.

I would love to know where this Keepstar is because the one in Camal is starting to smell. 
---
It's a way of fitting the Jaguar assault frigate so that in most situations requiring catching for example a kite-fit cruiser, you can overload your mwd and click approach, and more or less survive the distance between your gang and the target under any circumstances, through a combination of high speed, small sig, large repair amount, and in extremis, using the assault damage control. Once it is on top of its target, the nosferatu mean that it is very difficult/impossible to use neutralizers to get rid of the scram.
---
I think you missed the point...

Hmmm... I should write an EVE Bot...

Well down Komrade. well done. TY for the translation.

https://br.inyour.space/?s=1002096&amp;b=8534460&amp;e=120&amp;t=uvv
---
How did that battle start? Did you catch them in site, or did they get baited on you in site? 
---
Unrelated to EVE, but have you had your voice checked out? It can sometimes be a symptom of something, especially if it goes on for a long time. 
---
Can you post a pic my man?
---
Thanks for trying to communicate about this issue suits. I have been playing 6 years, pvp and mostly FC small gang. Here's my quickie.
---
The Jaguar is by far the best tackler in the game because of two things: speed and the ADC (you could just say tank). These two are the best stats because they are *directly* countering something so prolific, which is "kitey bullshit". So, other AFs will fill the role if you nerf the Jag solely, yes.
---
Here you can infer how I think: overall *game* speed velocity needs to be slashed by 10% across the board, all ships. Long range guns need a damage nerf. Not quite the long range guns of yesterday, but a little less [damage than they do today](https://i.imgur.com/bwtL3Xf.jpg)
---
 Garmurs doing 10k (for a reaching example) is dumb gameplay. Having the current align times with slower speed will still allow for people to kite. Aligning to something and overheating is a big I Win button with kitey bullshit, and there's almost no time for someone who is equal speed or slightly slower to anticipate it to cut them off or anything cool like an Immelman. 
---
 The only things that can keep up with a snaked orthrus (4629m/s two nanos) is something that can do over 5km, which leaves billions of isk, or something like an Assault Frigate. Recommend the Jaguar stays 
---
&gt; None of these changes would affect you one bit
---
Did you not read the post? How does banning supers from FW space, changing citadel mechanics, and re-introducing passive mining not affect the rest of the game? You realise that FW isn't the only thing that takes place in FW low-sec, right?
---
&gt; FW provides the most newbro accessible PVP environment (or it should) and it is intended to do so
---
Says who? On this and everything else you said, I think you're all projecting your wishful thinking on the game: FW NPC corps are just as useless as starter NPC corps, FW space is dead so nQ2ew players would get bored to death warping to empty plexes, and few changes have been proposed that would fix this beyond "force them to engage with FW game play". 
---
Reality (and zkill) say otherwise.
---
Most elite pvpers would just drop 15 carriers on this dude. For the challenge of course.
---
Attack destroyers. Paper tanks, fast speeds, medium guns
---
Also remove skill injectors.

---
Not running away, just broadening horizons, variety is the spice of life is it not? In any case, the chief reason this is the case in the first place is because CCP's neglect of FW.
---
I don't see what that has to do with anything? 
---
ok i get it. thanks for clearing it up.
---
You never forget your first.

I am a simple man. I see a Lussy Lou video, I upvote.

its been good fun following you guys doing this lately through zkill, lots of great BRs

loved seeing subcaps feed into the 99% webs + nags, that is some scary dps
---
excellent video!

Nice video. #inrustwetrust

hear hear
---
Right, exactly. The OP I was responding to was suggesting having one account per role. I have 4 accounts and use all 12 toons in very much the way you use yours. 
---
Yeah you're right, and I hate that mesh shit in swim trunks, wouldn't make it as a capsuleer
---
They must have changed it then.
---
Several AFs can be used to ram to some extent. The assault DC and the speed make them very hard to deal with in a reasonable amount of time. They are just overpowered in general.
---
gunboat diplomacy
---
I've been to the Dr several times, they just say its a post viral cough and will last a couple months and deal with it.
---
Like i can talk fairly normally, but after 30s or so of talking, my voice will crack and i'll cough. So, hard to do commentary like that.
---
AFs are totally never used to kite.
---
Eve is about the communities and their actions. Nobody cares if a rifter blows up unless it had 8 bil of bpos in it, nobody cares if there was a fight in lowsec unless it's long time rivals or powerhouses. Nobody cares about person leaving corp unless they take all the assets with them.
---
Eve is about people and their actions. If you think it's "ALL ABOUT THE SPACESHIP" then by all means keep doing your level 4 missions. 
---
I've changed the name on two of my doods so far, all you need to do I prove to whoever reads your ticket that the name breaks a rule or is offensive in some way ( both time I did it reported myself with a few alts about how the name means something deeply offensive to a group of people ((all made up course but it works )).  Ccp will change your name to something like Caldari Citizen 1763002872 and once that happens you can rename at your leisure
---
Getting rid of overpowered stuff is good for the game.
---
I would hate to see an eye turned into Coblat Edge. Sone faction titans in build there that you don't want anyone knowing about.
---
Yeah, the fact that it basically cant die isnt a big deal.
---
Because your ‚Äúteaser‚Äù was the icebreaker story ghost used. Not the real meat and potatoes. And doesn‚Äôt actually inspire anyone to watch the video.
---
Thanks for voicing that part of this dynamic between kitey and the powerful ramjag is just that everything is so _fast_ these days.
---
If it's extremely tanky but can't run things down like an interceptor can, then it's secondary heavy tackle and that's fine - it's no different than a cruiser warping in and grabbing a secondary point. The issue is that it can close distances like an interceptor while being that tanky. If you make it slow and take away its tank, what's the point of flying it?
---
going from goon pet to tapi pet is variety?
---
Big Yikes
---
One of the other ideas we tossed around was halving ADC duration, then adding a bonus to the HAC to double it back up to where it is now. This was motivated by how strong the ADC duration is on a frigate hull, where you're typically dealing with much shorter lifetimes and smaller HP buffers. Do you think that would be a better initial change?
---
I remember when DT was an hour. And 2 days on expansion days.
---
T3 triglavian cruiser
---
Horde not cutting it anymore?
---
No, but going from a purely Faction Warfare alliance to a hybrid Nullsec and Faction Warfare alliance opens up a lot of avenues for different kinds of content that would not be available to us had we remained purely a Faction Warfare alliance. 
---
Lussy has the best eve videos.
---
&gt;I don't think it's fair for it to be cursed with terrible speed and terrible fitting and terrible dps for the unforgivable sin of actually posing a threat to kity nano gangs.
---
A lot of those gangs are other AFs. So the "best" counter to an AF is an AF.
---
When the blob arrives (and it will), DPS wont matter.
---
&gt;note that the only slower AF, the Retribution, has the best-in-class combination of dps and projection of all AFs.
---
Also overpowered.
---
&gt;Just because you can't trivially RLML it off the field like everything else doesn't mean it needs to be nerfed into the ground so hard it'll come up in china.
---
What other "counter" is there? The balance is basically bad enough that its either RLML or dont bother.
---
^ This! Everything I do in Eve now is to fund my still ridiculously inept hunting expeditions - but SO much fun - hunting and avoiding being the prey yourself.

Lmao

There really isn‚Äôt much to say - Inner Hell caught some Charons near a gate. TEST Yolles caps in to deal with it. Snuff was waiting and dread bombed them. INIT had a Stuka fleet out and came in and we killed a bunch of supers. We got half the dreads out, 75-80% of the bombers. 
---
**heavy breathing**
---
&gt; Make it so the combat tutorial ends with the newbro in a FW NPC corp and not mining in a venture because of the autistic advice of starting npc corp chats. 
---
I am a newbro and this would be a bad idea. I have looked into FW Corps and they all want the person to have a ton of skillpoints. If I was thrown into a FW NPC Corp, I would lose my starting ships and wouldn't have a way to earn isk or progress. Maybe FW Corps should take newbros under their wings like the null corps do and help them get started and teach them. Just a thought from a 4 day old new bro.
---
My first was an Ares in my Atron. He warped right on me and for some reason I was able to kill him before he killed me. He was also rail fit? /shrug
---
I actually like CODE. A CODE member was even my first kill, I believe... Tisiphone Dira or w/e. THAT is a rush. No real gain. Gotta try to get your shots in before Concorde. But man, shooting CODE is awesome! So, I like them lol.
---
why no stabs in refit to save caps though?
---
Just light a cyno and... nevermind.
---
Compare for every module is tedious. I know that because I've been doing some logi for my corp lately.
---
Also this feature forces price validity to 2 hours, which means if price of a module with replacement candidates is older than 2 hours it will be refetched, while comparison tab doesn't do that, keeping normal price validity of 24 hours, thus making it likely that it's outdated.
---
Lol the first time anyone shoots back at PIRAT they fold instantly like a soaked tampon. Who would‚Äôve thought eh.
---
I've encountered quite a bit of crashes since this update. Happens once when drag-dropping a module to fit it and then once it happens once, keeps happening until the app ia closed and restarted completely
---
Oh! Well that makes sense. Couldn't have managed an hour of tearjerkers like that.
---
The thing about the hawk was that you can currently fit it without a current router at all, having to add a fitting module where it didn't have one before is a big difference. Also, that hawk fit doesn't have an ADCU, which is enough by itself to make me call that a broken fit, that module is far too powerful to leave off. And just in general, I am very leery of making a global change to fix such a specific problem. You may be able to massage and tweak it enough to avoid most of the negative consequences, but that still doesn't stop it from being the wrong approach conceptually speaking. If a ship is broken, fix the ship, don't globally nerf a random otherwise-balanced module in the hope that it won't have *too* many negative knock-on effects. If the MASB gets changed, it should be in the context of a (greatly needed, I will admit) global rebalance of shield boosting modules as a whole, not trying to use a global change to swat a specific ship.
---
For the rest of it, I think the problem is that you're too narrowly focused on the jag-as-ramjag. You correctly note that the issue is the combination of tank and speed, but I don't think you're giving enough consideration to how those fit into the wider context of the ship, race, and class. For example, DPS obviously doesn't matter for the ramjag tackle role, but it's very important balancing lever in the context of AFs in general, which is why nerfhammering the lowest-dps AF into the bedrock in all the other areas that it gets as partial compensation for that lack isn't fair. Similarly, if you think that you have to nerf a *minmatar* ship's speed so heavily that it goes from the fastest in its class to the second-slowest (and only second-slowest because the retri was specifically speed nerfed after the rebalance, otherwise even *it* would be faster), that ought to tell you that you're going down the wrong track - that's not how a minmatar ship is supposed to be balanced. Likewise, if you think you have to step so far outside the usual balancing rules as to give a combat frigate - and an AF at that, with extra slots to fill including the extra launcher you just added - 4 mw less powergrid than literally any other non-droneboat combat frigate in the game, that also ought to be a sign that this isn't the right way to balance it. (Similarly, every AF is supposed to have a utility high - the Jag already has problems in that it can't afford to fill it usually, but it's at least there.) Basically, if you have to sledgehammer the thing into the ground *this* hard, you're doing it wrong.
---
Nerf the sig to 39 or so (still in the normal range for AFs), and/or reduce the sensor strength (something which is already a thematic minmatar weakness) to 9ish to make it more vulnerable to cruiser weapons and ECM drones. (Both of these are great suggestions from elsewhere in the thread.) Hit the speed a *little bit*, perhaps, but not by such a ridiculous amount. Maybe increase the capacitor recharge rate and reduce cap amount in order to preserve the overall cap recharge but make it more vulnerable to getting its cap alpha'd by cruiser (or bonused) neuts? Honestly, if you wanted to attack its tackle role, I'd sooner swap the shield boost bonus for a second DPS bonus (e.g. an offsetting bonus that preserves its overall power level if you're *not* just using it for tackle) than give it such extreme nerfs to fitting and speed. (Not saying I'd really want to do that, but IMO it'd be a more reasonable change than your proposed ones.)
---
As an aside, I think that a lot of the problem is that right now kity gangs are too used to being able to remove tackle just by applying damage. It's not like the jag can't be shut down other ways, it's just that you can't trivially RLML it off the grid. 
---
Now this is one type of Hisec (salt) mining I can support.

I had my first kill on some poor bastard in a cheetah using my astero. Housed him for like 80m and felt bad. Stopped solo hunting after that.
---
However - now I help defend my corps home space. This is exceptionally enjoyable, especially when you finally take down some cloaky goon camper... 
---
&gt;Also if the Jaguar was nerfed, would you still be worried about other AFs in similar roles?
---
Yes. Its often impossible to get rid of a fast AF tackle with ADCU before the blob lands (which consists of other AFs).
---
&gt;It's seen as generally 'strong but fair' for 1v1/small gang outside of this role.
---
Its generally annoying and low risk because of its speed and five mids that can easily fit say a defensive faction web.
---
&gt;Obviously at the time I pointed out, and the community too that this would break some existing fits, such as Dual XLASB Battleships, Dual MASB Frigates in FW mostly, and the occasional Dual-Large ASB fit.
---
There is something more fundamentally broken with AFs. They are too fast and tanky and have no real counters. 
---
Very valid questions.
---
1) Most of my time in Eve has been based around flying against or with kitey comps. It's what I love to do in the game. Granted as a Horde member, we get an amazing amount of content, so when I want to play the game for 20-30mins at a time, I'll scan intel to find fights. Which is why I prefer tackle roles. I'm able to get to fights fast, and force engagements. When I roam, I typically go with a nano rlml loki, retri, rail hecate for obvious reasons when going alone. The second a ceptor starts a burn in, I know it's an easy km. Jag is a cause for concern because it's gg if the scram touches off in hostile staging. Range control is the name of the game. I'll still take the fight due to web control range and can usually pull off the kill with faction scourge unless the jag immediately doubles back. 
---
It's important to reiterate that I agree with you, the ship does need a nerf. The nerf needs to be to speed/sig rad though because of my answer to question 2.
---
2)  There are no other ceptors/AFs that fill the role that a Jag does which is what makes it unique. Jag's dps is terrible, why use it over other AFs for kiting / brawling / fleet dps. It's used for a specific niche which is tackle that can stay on grid with the presence of rlmls. Ceptors cannot fill this. The ship can fill a scram tackle role that ceptors simply cannot. HOWEVER, while this is a unique niche due to the ADC, the drawback should be that the jag shouldn't be as powerful on the speed spectrum when compared to ceptors. I like the fact that a tackle ship poses a danger/consideration although easily controllable. For all non-rlml style comps, my go to is still ceptors because the benefit to speed (scaled with snakes) combined with the lower sig, and extended point ranges, and reduced cap reqs make them easily dominant when flown well.
---
3) Part of my point for not killing the jag as a scram tackle roll (although a speed nerf is warranted) is because the jag is a controllable anti-kite rlml solution. Whereas recons are not as easily. There are many ways to range control jags, damps are almost the only way for recons. People are always going to bring the tools that a fight warrants. Jag is an engageable tool for a small gang to control (even more so with a speed/sig rad nerf) which allows fights to still progress. When groups like Tuskers, Rote, or KR come to Gem for example, they rarely bounce grid because of a couple jags. However the fight progresses because it's a tackle role that can stay on grid so both sides have a fighting chance. The jag has a fighting chance if not nueted, webbed, damped, alphad, or forced to adc early to snag a scram and survive as a warp in for 8 sec, and the gang has a chance to control the jag getting within 9km. So both sides commit. Take that tool away, and the ceptor still doesn't look any better for taking on kitey rlml gangs, the standard tool just reverts back to snipey shit covered by recons.
---
Well done m8

My first targets also were Explorers and was alot of fun, once in a while il sit in a WH and set traps. Keep it up it only gets better!
---
Bugger off, what's your problem?
---
He's genuinely trying to make a game improvement suggestion. Take your salt and whatever spat you have and get out if you don't have anything to contribute.
---
Is it wrong for me to call out someone who is terrible at the game and dosent understand it that they shouldnt try and change the experience for hundreds others?
---
Like its a cunt thing to say, but the truth is the truth.
---
okay, this is about a lot more than jaguars. ruining dozens of fits at a minimum and outright nerfing a large portion of an entire hull size is beyond jaguars
---
In the first cap battle however you managed to get the music synced with the explosions and command bursts.... Was awesome. 
---
&gt; You realise that FW isn't the only thing that takes place in FW low-sec, right?
---
Good point. I was misreading the citadel change as only impacting FW alliance owners. I think it's a good change for them but for neutral freeports it should just be that they FW players can't dock if they don't own the system. 
---
Perhaps permitting passive mining in this limited context would have a larger economic impact that could affect you than I think but I really don't think it would be that large of an effect. 
---
As for banning supers. There's far more non FW space to play with supers unaffected by the proposed change than the relatively small space which would be affected. meanwhile there's no other area of space dedicated the sub-cap warfare accessible to newer players and smaller groups which is being driven away from the game by oppressive supercap umbrellas of larger older entities. 
---
yes, there's more that goes on in FW space than just FW. But there's all of new eden to engage on that other stuff and only FW space to engage in FW. And for most of the non-fw players in FW space the attraction is the vibrant solo/small gang, sub-cap PvP environment which FW had been so successful in generating.
---
&gt; FW NPC corps are just as useless as starter NPC corps,
---
i have to disagree emphatically with that. Between people sharing intel and kills and shooting shit in militia chat, the public fleets run by player alliances open to anyone in militia and the occasional ping in militia chat to joins such fleets  to bash ihubs there's WAY more interactions and opportunities to interact in meaningful ways with player corps and alliances prior to joining one than I ever witnessed in any other NPC corp... whose chat channels are generally dead.
---
&gt; FW space is dead so nQ2ew players would get bored to death 
---
FW space in my experience has really only been dead for the past six months when the major Caldari alliances fled the combination of Snuff and GalMil's dominance of the warzone... in the past couple of months it's slowly been coming back though still far from what it was just six months prior. I think almost any change would likely help revive FW especially one which makes the much larger null and pirate blocks less oppressive to the smaller alliances of mostly newer players who dominate the FW factions. 
---
Good job dude! 
---
Can you post the error message you get, either here or on github issues?
---
Same place you report bugs :) github issues page
---
I'm a simple man, I see a joecuster post and I downvote.
---
Except that all these fucking arguments are predicated on pretending that PLEX'd accounts don't make CCP money which isn't true OR they're pretending that people would buy PLEX with $$ even if people didn't use plex to sub their accounts which is also fucking stupid.
---
Which is why this ENTIRE fucking thread is a stupid waste of space.  I don't know why anyone is taking this shit as a serious consideration.
---
&gt;you'd have the same issue against the other active rep AFs.
---
Maybe there is a pattern.
---
As others have said, it seems unlikely. Especially because of the strain this would put on the server during large fights.
---
It‚Äôs fostered some great discussion, and some more thematic, arguably better, suggestions though, which is really all you hope for with a thread like this :)
---
you ever tried to fold a soaked tampon
---
So I'm getting mixed messages here.
---
&gt;I dont think your in any position to talk about fw when you ran away from it to sov null lmao
---
And
---
&gt; Is it wrong for me to call out someone who is terrible at the game and dosent understand it that they shouldnt try and change the experience for hundreds others? 
---
What does "running away" to sov null (which is also not true by the way, as I pointed out earlier, probably more than 50% of my time is spent in Faction Warfare Lowsec) have to do with being terrible? And just to push that further, 5/10 of my top systems on zkill are FW Lowsec systems.
---
why were those guy so desperate to kill those dreads as to call in half the universe? was this an eviction or something?
---
Is this how fight in W-space usually go? I was under an impression W-space was mainly small gang pvp.
---
If you‚Äôre looking for PvE combat that is easy you can run highsec anomalies in a Tristan to get escalations. Serpentis (gallente space) is the best for this in my opinion as their escalation is quite easy and can be done in about 30 minutes in a Tristan. 
---
If that interests you then lemme know and we can talk details! It isn‚Äôt suuuuuuper exhilarating or tough but it can be fun now and then and pay alright for a newbie.
---
&gt; i hope the hac bubble spools up in size
---
wishful thinking ... I would love something like this. A growing Trig bubble ...
---
It is wrong because you are unable to see beyond your personal dispute with this person's playstyle and how you deem it inferior to yours, and unable to address the merits of the idea. Nobody cares for it and you're making a fool of yourself.
---
Moreover, even if they were genuinely unaware of the nature of the game, that's what discussion is for. It's still possible for an idea to be a good one even if the speaker has only the shallowest of experience to base it on.
---
If you're going to say something, why don't you start with why you think this idea is a bad one?

You have something tackled you can't kill, you batphone so it dies.
---
If they batphoned for an armour brawl that would be a total dick move (tho tdsin has done that before), but for random dreads they have tackled?
---
You can't blame them for batphoning to secure kills, and you can't blame people for accepting free content. This is Eve after all. 
---
blap dread setup with 99% vindi webs means everything thag comes close is fucked.
---
so, how do you kill a fax that tanks 40k cold without getting close to it? you have to bring 80+ subs in kitey stuff..  ''FUN''
---
What's your point? All AFs are too strong? They seem to be in a much better place than they used to be which was pretty much nonexistent. 
---
&gt; It is a common error for new players to Faction Warfare to shoot the friendly NPC based solely on the fact that it is red.
---
Heck not just new players. I'll find myself shooting the damn thing because I didn't realize the system I'm in had flipped a couple days ago. 
---
Just a heron? Herons are super scary bait ships. If people pvp fit the heron, we'll.. I've seen sabres and asteros lost to those.

I disagree. While it may be OP in some environments vs some ships, such as FW, its about on par with at least some of the other dessis, specifically T3Ds and Command destroyers, note some, not all.
---
Also, a Kiki swarm is very welcome due to cap unbalance. Even with the upcoming changes to caps that just won't change much, and the game as a whole needs many more ships such as the Kiki, not less.
---
Therefore, I submit to you that it isn't Kiki that is OP, but rather caps, while rest of the vast majority of sub-caps with exception of few ships and specialized / expensive fits, are completely fucked up in this department and they should all be brought up, all of them.
---
But but but... I thought supers were op  and Rorquals impossible to destroy and and and...
---
I think Autothysian Lancers should follow this pattern too, if that's not too much to ask. Neutral colored unless you're carrying something like a body, perhaps, though that second bit will be hard.
---
I like this suggestion because the system has already been demonstrated with diamond NPCs in mining fleets, so it should be relatively quick to implement.
---
I'll just have to trust that's a funny way of saying that you've rethought MASB fitting changes
---
PH must have ran out of tornadoes
---
I'm glad my first feature in one of your vids wasn't of me feeding horrifically.
---
What do you mean "if"? It is extremely tanky and fast.
---
&gt;it's no different than a cruiser warping in and grabbing a secondary point. 
---
It is different because it happens faster than a cruiser could do it (generally).
---
&gt;If you make it slow and take away its tank, what's the point of flying it?
---
A similar claim can be made for any ship that is overpowered. The point is to have balance.
---
It's 3 insignificant sub kills yet I can't help but upvote. The magic of the wardec corp hate circlejerk.
---
Its just like tinder!
---
Please tell me how an alliance affiliation disqualifies one from saying something.
---
I've been trying to log back into Eve since a computer refresh. However, every time I try to submit a verification code, it takes me back to the login page, and I get stuck in a loop of getting codes. Anyone else have this problem? How do you fix it?

---
This pleases me
---
\*steeples hands
---
It's an if-then statement dude. Not a hypothetical.
---
If the Jag was made slower, it would be balanced. It's OK for a ship in the AF class specifically fit to have a massive tank to have a massive tank. Who cares if it's a brick if it can't catch you?
---
I guess its a start. It probably needs to be removed from AFs completely.
---
Or no need to use them. 
---
If Pirat die this  easy, PH can switch to battle ventures.
---
Great stuff
---
&gt;All AFs are too strong? 
---
Pretty much. They can fit the ADCU, so they all have that invuln. The speed is also a problem.
---
Of course people like them. Just like they liked every overpowered ship in the past.
---
i'm not sure why both CCP and people on here spend so much time thinking about / shitting on little high sec pvp groups like this.
---
it's like when they bring a pedophile apologist on a talk show just so everyone can shit on them.
---
cheap entertainment in lieu of having anything important to say or do tbh
---
Doubt it, sadly.
---
Goons will ask Test (or at least Vily) to say sorry to Hy, and ask Snuffed to stop shooting Test shit. 
---
Then everyone goes back to holding hands.
---
150man dreadbomb and almost no fax support...
---
It was a great presentation. One of my favourites from that weekend.
---
ill give you 5 mill for buy out pm me
---
lmao you realize that NC was so tired of feeding to unspoken, they had to call Phorde and PL, right?
---
anyone would brag when they are less then half the size of a group, and still stomps them, lmao. NC are just shit.
---
I died a little inside when you deselected that sleipnir. Thank you for posting another nice vid!
---
Its basically false. With snakes, it will go 4-5k (seems modest) even after a speed nerf. You need to do something about the tank.
---
I've got a decent chuck of ISK from exploration and I wanted to start more passive methods of farming ISK. I heard about PI and decided to give it a try. I watched guides and did some other research until I learned that PI for alphas is... limited. Is Planetary Interaction really worth it for alphas? 
---
remember you can look up the missions online:
---
https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=MissionReports
---
https://eve.nikr.net/missions
---
actually that would be https://discord.gg/thWrsHS
---
Good to know. I'm a big fan of your videos and your desire to make battleships great again!
---
those guys actually take fleet fights and honestly seem much less risk averse than most null groups who drop supers on small gangs
---
[https://zkillboard.com/related/30000142/201903151600/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30000142/201903151600/)
---
if you look at their killboard most of their kills are on players from null sec, doesnt look like seal clubbing to me
---
guess its just fun to shit on guys who have enjoy small scale subcap pvp content, while you rorq mine and pretend like your video game experience is somehow more authentic or superior to anyone else's
---
lmao
---
&gt;high sec pvp
---
does not compute
---
Why not just say Inner Hell and Lussy make great WH vids? (:
---
You sound like you hold a high sec mining license. No one likes code... **no one...**
---
We (SOUND) were the group that initially tackled, fed, reshipped, and then called in more jspace groups. A batphone of this size is a pretty rare thing in jspace just for some dread kills. Usually a batphone of this size is only for evictions. But in this case Lussy and friends were very well set up and we didn't have the numbers on our own to take them down with subcaps. Due to wormhole mass issues we couldn't just drop all the caps we own, which is why jspace is usually a great place for smaller groups ([we had 30 titans dropped on our subcap fleet in lowsec earlier that day for example](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003068/201903242100/)). 
---
Their bhaal grinder comp (what we call the dual nag + fax+ vindi comp) is very powerful against subcaps, so once most of our battleships got chewed up and our guards + damnations started dying, we had to pull back to something kitey so we could stay away from their bhaal and vindi. So we kept sabre bubbles up and pulled back to get in Cerbs so we could stay out of range of their bhaal and vindi webs. Once we did this we were able to keep them tackled, but couldn't apply enough DPS or neuts to break anything they had on field, which is when we hit the batphone button. As the video mentioned, the fight when on well over two hours, and the early kills we got on their subcaps were dependent on getting a lucky jam + zoop so we could kill it out of Apostle rep range. Eventually we got enough subcap power to take down their vindi/bhaal (the subcap combo that makes their caps so dangerous) and eventually their caps, but getting that many groups coordinated and into the right wormhole while the fight is going on takes a lot of time and effort. 
---
Lots of respect to Lussy and friends for this fight - they are really good at this and it took a lot of people people and lost isk to finally take them down. Glad to see people doing some cool and unusual stuff like this in jspace, and making such great videos to boot. 
---
cant wait when there will be service that will fit wormhole with stuff for you so u dont have to move ur ass to anchor stuff. 
---
Give nullsec/wh exploration a try. As a fellow new player myself I can attest to its effectiveness. Got round 200M ISK in three nights work. Don't let the risk stop you. Good D-Scan and Local habits make it decently safe, and a single can will buy 3-4 sets of T1 Exploration Frigates, so losses arent a huge deal
---
I know, it wasn't even worth posting but I know what get upvotes. Also the salt is a bonus
---
I like it! Been playing on and off for 4 years, still haven't been able to kill anyone in PvP. 
---
U wot m8 I will bash ur head in once I get within 5,2km
---
Give the agent orange more time to kill off the vegetation and it will look just like Etherium Reach.
---
Beautiful sir, well done!
---
So basically nano cruisers?
---
No it's more like the fat guy in Gamer (with Gerard Butler) dunking waffles in syrup.
---
So what you're saying is, a purpose built ship with specialized implants is good at the thing it's focused on? 
---
Wouldn't that be a good thing since you would be much more likely to find someone living in a hole with more money than sense (easy pickings?)
---
That's probably the one
---
ur retarded &lt;3 :)  
---
Hey folks,
---
Returning Eve Online player here.  I haven't touched this game for well over 2 years now, and was just thinking of getting back into this.  Is it worth it?  I can't even remember what I did last, or where I left off.  Is there a good story line to follow now?  Which Corporations should I consider joining as a "new" returning player?
---
My character has just over 19mil skill points, no idea if that's decent anymore.
---
Looking for help really, lol.
---
Thank you for your time.
---
Wasn't this an armour brawl?
---
This makes no sense
---
Dude, I'm going for 100 mil sp this year and you could kill me in a shitfit helios if you caught me solo
---
Tell Daddy where mommy touched yo
---
infinite
---
There chances of me beating a Pirate-Faction Frigate with my lncursus... :/ 
---
I know it's not the "same" CODE even though they share an alliance ticker for salt but I want to add that New Order Outreach is a very spooky people to fight.
---
I still consider myself pretty inexperienced especially compared to them and it shows. I had the opportunity to come across Velsh and Intigo and co. and the gap in experience really showed. They were very punishing of mistakes while hard to truly separate themselves; I managed to survive and leave but didnt feel like I could do anything meaningful, though part of that was not having similar numbers on grid and limited communication.
---
I learned a lot just from watching them though, like a bit of how to fly with links dessies on grid.
---
Hope to fight them again and maybe one day be good enough to secure some kills against.
---
So hats off to that branch of CODE and no shame to anyone who dies to them.
---
You don't know the seequet handshake
---
Follow that thirst for blood, trust me.
---
Not a visual that really needs more color...
---
Oh you didn't read the memo.
---
CCP is closing the plex sell to higher the price and shout down bots
---
Yes I remember this it was creepy as hell too.
---
There's always gotta be a scapegoat. In a PvP game you're going to have hunters for every kind of target. The hunters are going to optimize their strategies to be most effective. PIRAT's got the highsec carebear corps crying because that's all they're good at, and the LNSWH elitists sneering at them for daring to operate in HS. I don't see a good reason for all the hate. Risk needs to be present in all areas of space for EVE to work properly.
---
You'd be surprised, I've seen guys get silly shiny kills in Atrons. T1 combat frigs are in a really good spot right now, and you can get fifty of them for the price of a worm. So long as you pick your fights, you can fly dirt cheap ships and get nice kills.
---
Why bother when rorqs and drones are getting nerfed in a month
---
If you _actually_ look at their killboard you'll find that capsules, haulers, shuttles and t1 industrials are more than half their total kills.
---
So no, they aren't here for the "gudfites." They're here for hisec newbie frags.
---
But how do I know if I should take a fight? 
---
It was a fun fight. Good video! And womhole Voltron will be ready when you come back! :) GF
---
Welcome aboard!
---
I would probably say they are overpowered. There isnt one thing that is broken.
---
&gt;if you look at their killboard most of their kills are on players from null sec
---
Well yeah, after the wardec changes pirat cant just camp noobs in stations anymore, I'm surprised they are even still around.
---
He exclusively uses Herons for solo pvp
---
People (and I hesitate to use that word) that defend groups like Pirat are the most pathetic babydick betas in all of gaming
---
Like who sucks the dick of newb killers?  How pitiful are you that you have to stick up for the bullies to feel wanted?
---
Pathetic.
---
So by "armor brawl", another\_eve\_account means an "honor (armor) brawl", which is something that happens between large wormhole groups sometimes when they roll into each other. At its height, it involves 3 caps + 6 battleships + a large armor battlecruiser/cruiser fleet, which is the theoretical maximum you can fit through a completely unmassed high-class wormhole. It usually involves agreeing to the fight by both groups, and is considered really bad form to call in another group or drop more than 3 caps (if you are fighting in your own home, and thus can do that). 
---
This wasn't that case. In this case they get set up in a random C5 wormhole and bait people in for fights, which is more of a gank/anything goes situation. In this case I think we caught one of their nags rolling wormholes, tackled it, and they signed on the rest of their caps/subcaps within about 5 minutes and started the fight (right where Lussy's video starts). In that case, pretty much anything goes, including calling in friends if you can manage to keep tackle for the long time it takes to get another wormhole group into your chain. 
---
Here's some other BRs of groups they've fought the same way recently:

---
Lol so true
---
on sisi btw, the ship is so big you can open 2 depos at the same time if you have placed them before hand and warped to the bm between the depos 
---
ofc you cant move or you cant save them 
---
A) you watch videos, which I strongly recommend. Look up Lasker's Atron vids, for starters.
---
B) you just take it, and find out how it goes. EVE pvp is about learning the meta, the crowd and the territory, as much as about clicking tge riggt module.
---
You will lose a lot of ships, but that's part of tge fun too, and hey, atrons are cheaaaaap.
---
Yup, im tired too of watching post about eve is dying... btw really nice pic. 
---
its as if dozens of mackinaws cried out..... and were suddenly silenced
---
I'm up voting for Captain Bukkake
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
can I Skype into this?
---
i appreciate the sentiment but i think.... that analogy needs some work, my guy
---
Casey, do your homework. Also have my upvote
---
congrats!!!  you've joined the dark side....you can never go back
---
Spread that sheet over here... thanks really this will help a lot
---
Remove excavators - problem solved
---
Do autoscythian lancers shoot people with corpses in the hold? Is that a new feature?
---
thats works too :-)
---
I hope the corpse is sitting safely in your hangar. Congrats!
---
Call it like a heat purge or something. 
---
Never not try to bump the sun! 
---
Like old school relic sites
---
tHe CaSinO wAr!1!1!1
---
Goons back Pirat. Unsurprising.
---
Yeah, I think I would come back and fund some stupid fit roams for fun, if I was confident it was busy.  
---
Same last week or so has been good fun, looking forward to more hopefully soon. 
---
7o
---
But why tho?
---
Even PL and Goons fight would on the same side when it suits them.
---
Not high. Just browsing r/eve and missing the time when i was like the dude in the image.
---
fuck off
---
As it's you Edooty...No
---
upvoted this purely for the well formatted post, wish i could double upvote for content.
---
If he doesn't follow up, check in with me, eh? Makoto Priano.
---
Because that's how Astero bots operate. If we cut out how they work, we can slow them down or at least force them to travel all the way back to jita giving more chances to kill them.
---
Nice work this is great 
---
All you need is kill
---
But then what about us normal players?
---
Gets votes cause no one likes high sec war deccers. 
---
This takes so much more effort, 90% went bother and will lose 2 instead 
---
Thats a lot of work positioning and repositioning wetus as the rorqs move to new rocks. Now imagine the person has 8 or 10 rorqs tto do this with, lol.
---
I get the feeling its more likely they would tie the eve gate into the  death of EVE. Think stellaris endgame crisis. but after whatever comes out of the gate wins, and they will win, the server gets shut down. Maybe CCP Stonemason will chisel the final battle in the sidewalk outside of the office. 
---
No
---
Realised I forgot to answer part of the question. My efforts to fit e.g. a ram enyo along the same kind of lines (dual nos, mwd/scram/web, 400m restrained/energized exp/adc/OD, dual poly) seems a lot more 'fair' in that it is entirely buffer with no repair ability, and goes 3.3km/s. Dropping that plate for a rep brings the ship up to 3.7km/s, but it has half the EHP/s of the Jag, which I think is a lot more reasonable, and would be comparable to a single MASB Jag fit performance-wise.
---
Like we could interrupt an op and have the competent people to do so, however we also just don't care... We are not actually Panfam, we do our own thing with our own goals. Its also why you will never see us deploy outside of provi and adjacent lowsec in any meaningful way.
---
Sure PL/NC. could crash on our couch in Camal, but there are much more strategic locations they would rather stage from. Its really not a good place to hit anything other than provi.
---
Its no different than if goons were coming thru and "requested" usage of Provi's Keepstar. I expect the doors would be wide open for them but that doesn't make provi-bloc an Imperium entity.
---
Entirety of Legacy space that is in titan range of Camal, nothing that legacy actually cares about.

---
We call PL/NC. (and other people generally friendly to us) when our Keepstar is in danger because as other people have pointed out "don't anchor a structure you can't defend", and the only way we can defend it against a null super power is by asking other null super powers. Same goes with provi's Keep. Neither of our coalitions matter in the face of the null super blocs, any of them could roll over both of us like a minor speed bump.

Oh wow I killed you last night in Deklein. Didn't know you had 100 drakes. I'll give you your corpse for 25 of them :) 
---
I sure wish I could go back to my first kill in Eve... 9 years later with hundreds of kills but its still an adrenaline rush. 
---
&gt;I always carebeared a lot
---
  &gt;Its just not fun anymore
---
  Gee I wonder why
---
&gt; those guys actually take fleet fights
---
Dude, have you ever fought them?
---
They only take fleet ganks. The only time I've ever seen them take something with a chance of killing anything in their fleet, it was because they had to be baited. Or else they just play dock/undock games and sometimes whine in local.
---
They won't even take fleet fights with odds heavy in their favor if losses are still possible. 10 Caracals is apparently too scary for Vindi/Proteus/Mach fleet with nestor backup, and they definitely outnumbered us not even counting neutral logi. I remember catching that while I was still an Eve Uni noob, and watching their fleet run. We eventually killed off their Nestors on different grids because they got aggro'd and left them to die.
---
They may do fleet combat from time to time, but fleet fights they do not, and most certainly do not have a good win record for them.
---
Basketball shorts seem ideal to me personally...
---
It exists even if you can't or don't dare. :P
---
The fuck
---
Oof
---
yeah prob only ppl that do alot of rorqs on one moon at the same time will do it so they dont have to move
---
You sure it's him?
---
Might come to this, Lincoln isn‚Äôt too far
---
remove  mobile depots..
---
give us ship module for low slot called - ship reiconfiguration matrix... once fitted  it allow you to adjust ship modules/ammo/drones..... if not   ship module what about giving  ALL LOGI ships ability of mobile depot so  hug logi for notonly reps but also for refit?
---
You asked on r/eve, a site devoted to fans of EVE, so it's unlikely anyone is going to tell you to fuck off and run for the hills. "New returning" players are better known as normal players and r/evejobs is devoted to helping them find a place. 19m SP is a moderate amount, that's enough to be quite good at one thing or quite bad at a lot of things. The Triglavians are new lore, and there are now private instanced "Abyssal" sites where you can fight them for decent rewards. For fun team play, as always, look for a corp outside of highsec. For round-the-clock fun and access to prime territory join a nullbloc.
---
With my pants down 
---
remove with bombs and torpedoes - best way
