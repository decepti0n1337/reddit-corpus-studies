yeah but after that they have to sub anyway. I don't see it so bad on that aspect. It will maybe help skillfarms but i think they will implement that the app actually counts toward pcu. And when we speak of life improvements yes it would help improve new build skillfarming but also new players. I go for new players help &gt; skillfarm help when i look at eve login numbers.
---
---
---
If you actually like the idea of this i would be willing to lose a freighter over it. I'd tank it so any gankers would need to throw a lot at it and just get shit in return
---
San Diego is a very nice city with a lot to offer. I lived there for several years. I’ve had as much fun in San Diego as Las Vegas.
---
Because its the easiest and safest way to the fight?
---
Isn't bumping from tether considered an 'exploit'?
---

---
I remember there being some drama about it involving some titans.
---
I spent my first 10 minutes escaping the tutorial and orbiting a billboard. It's a real nice shake-up if you're used to WoW, FFXIV, GW2, etc.
---
Oof. Possible error?
---
That login in screen is nothing but functional.
---
No ads, no ads, and no ads.   Though a little more work for the 20 account people.
---
Does this ship need to be a certain distance away from the citadel before he can attack it?
---
Most underrated comment ever lol.
---
No.
---
I don't think people are really stockpiling ore. They are spending it on supers as quickly as they can mine it.
---
Brave newbies has a bag training plan
---
I find myself using Soundcloud CCP page on another screen as a ghetto jukebox..
---
There is zero reason to move the top fan event from the place where it has been for years and consistently sells out.  San Diego is a fine town, but it's not Vegas.  If they're going to move it, it should be to Orlando or DC.  Those are far better choices for a big American event than San Diego.
---
The game is moving away from super safe farms and umbrellas to a more balanced playstyle.
---
The question is why wasn’t it done sooner. Before the years of over farming and isk inflation happened. 
---
The fact that it’s happening and will continue to be balanced is pointless to argue.
---
No, eve skill system + grind to set you up not in the rest of my life i would touch this game again. 
---
a new game sandbox with less grind and a different skill approach probably.
---
go ahead fit an AB or an MWD. That way the bombers can drop their bombs and boosh even sooner since you will be burning into their bombs range for them, what could go wrong going prop on into a bomb wave or two?
---
50m is more than Titans dude.
---
You know what's funny though? The fact that this whole chain of events will end in CCP unveiling a "new structure" that lets you scan local or some shit, making life in nullsec safer than ever before...
---
Not sure if memeing but okay lmfao
---
as new player look up on eveuniversity, get a new UI asap like Z-S overview etc. Also hang out in Newplayer friendly channels and ask questions there is no dumb question :). When you like tha game and don't like the approach of hisec look for Tuskers for lowsec stuff, Ushrakahn etc for Factionwarfare. Or when you want to dive into nullsec hit on Karmafleet, Brave Newbies, Dreddit and Pandemic Horde.
---
Nope completely doable. It actually can higher.
---
People are most def saying this. The EHP nerfs to supers/titans are saying just this. Olmecas comments about how subcap fleets should be able to alpha titans is saying just this.
---
Its not evening the scales, its massively helping the small gangs. The umbrellas cost trillions of isk and require thousands of manhours/day. Only in this game can that be considered bad and only in this game would people who at most "risk" a couple of billion in assets and perhaps 20 manhours belive they should stand a chance.
---
So you wanna even the scales? Then no one should ever be able to kill anything under an umbrella.
---
PvPers basically sound like ultrahardcore feminists to me at this point. Equality but only if we are the winners.
---
Killmails are stupid and so are people who care about them.
---
what monitor do u play on
---
I always liked it when they had a new theme with a major new release. My favourite release/login music is [These Sovereign Systems](https://soundcloud.com/ccpgames/eve-online-yc1183-theme-these-sovereign-systems).
---
Damn it, totally missed it on my mobile lol
---
You have something to support that claim? For example, I started in 2010 and just gave up eve for better games after one month because skilling up learnings was too much fun and it wasn't obvious what goals should be pursued. I came back in 2013 after watching Pretty Lights of Asakai (and I still rewatch it from time to time) and haven't gave up on eve yet.  
---
So even while you used safeword "almost" the rest still sounds like your personal biases.
---
&gt; Brave newbies has a ~bag~ bad training plan
---
Fixed that for you
---
What a surprise, right?
---
Map - personal - systems I have visited
---
Exodus/Red Moon Rising. 
---
Eve was at it’s finest then.
---
Yeah, hunters live to bash structures...
---
Being male, he couldn't have birthed anyone. If you're going to go in for the insult, atleast understand basic anatomy.
---
it sounds cool af, but I wonder how much laggier large battles would get if you include another layer of human response and feedback for player controlled fighters / bombers... drones and fighters already bottleneck the shit out of the server don't they?
---
Why do you keep using the economy as an excuse when you clearly dont understand it? If isk spam causes inflation then why didnt we see it? I mean its fking data, we had price drops not up, thats deflation and not inflation. Stop using irl economic theory, its way more complicated than you think.
---
PLEX prices is more tied to skill injectors than anything else and you know it. Besides if its high it means more accounts active.
---
And the faucet situation didnt need more risk to control and it its certainly not under control now. 
---
Stop using these arguments, you clearly dont understand them.
---
&gt; Afghanistan and the Middle East beg to differ
---
without the intent of virtue signalling i think there might be a way to be less casual about this
---
this is true, but if you just hit approach its good enough 80% of the time, at least better than what this guy is doing.
---
Eve reddit is a cancer.
---
Eve bitter vets are a cancer too. And most of the posts (eve official forum is even WORST) are from veterans. They are full of cancer.
---
harpies, condors, RML Caracals, or any nano'd up minmatar T1 cruiser really...
---
Only if all the risk averse people huddled in super alliances stay behind.
---
Not unprepared: they did it on purpose because having too many anemic servers in a month is worse than these queues.
---
may i haz pod tew?
---
He is so full of shit dude. In his other post he stated outright that if the chaos era kills Eve its not because the chaos era was bad but rather that the previous damage done by PvEers was too high. Hes created his own sandcastle in which he cant be disproven, not by data, not by logic, not by anything.
---
So that your «already replaced» mentality changes and losing ships matters to your coalitions.
---
peak subs for the game was 12 million in october 2010. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I very highly doubt they even got *near* that.
---
Yes, friendly citadels have a ‘tether’ mechanic. If you’re close, you cannot be targeted or harmed. 
---
If you target-lock anything or are bumped out of tether-range it drops and you become vulnerable.
---
It can be p2w but winning takes skill and a lot of knowledge of the game that cant be bought with real money. It's easy for a new player to get started since it's free. Worst case you dont waste anything by just trying it. Follow the tutorials and look up anything you are unsure about on google.
---
Respect
---
Talwars are cheap and pack a punch with enough of them.
---
didn't they already give up on Valkyrie because it didn't generate the player base they thought it would
---
no
---
Below the Asteroids...
---
I’ve been playing nearly every day for about 3 months. It’s a very deep game, people who have been playing for years still learn new things all the time. As long as you do the tutorials, maybe watch a few videos on YouTube and check out some Eve University stuff, have some patience, and ask questions in the right places it’s not a hard game to get into and very worthwhile.
---
Also watch out for scams.
---
Fly safe!
---
Peak concurrent users, not peak subs
---
Also note if you like using ArrayFormula then MAX() wont work in it. It is one is the few functions that don't like ArrayFormula
---
So, 2 things:
---
1) I think you are missing the point of my last post. It wasn't too QQ about how that fleet didn't get any kills while in delve. I'm totally fine with that. I'd expect a response fleet, like it would be stupid not to. We entered their space and bullied their player. Why wouldn't they drop caps on us? My story was meant to illustrate the amount of effort that goes into setting up those bomber fleets. It is incredibly ignorant to say that kind of PvP is "lazy" (inb4 relevant username). 
---
2) 
---
&gt;If i engage things in frigates, i will be putting in far more effort in execution because i put in so little effort into setting up.
---
&gt;You CHOSE frigates because they’re cheap and easy to set up and take zero effort to plan for besides going on the way and then fearing drones. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Out of all the options you had, you chose that because it’s quicker and easier and less effort intensive
---
If I am reading that right, you are upset that those covops groups use bombers to try to attack large ships like rorquals/caps? That frigates shouldn't be able to engage those targets? Am I correct with that reading?
---
Omg, this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEEmORyxpho
---
I miss them so much when i started eve. Alone, in Lonetrek and The Citadel regions, mining with the shittiest yield possible.
---
I miss that soo much, great time of my life, it almost hurts me.
---
lol
---
Wow that's fucking dumb. San Diego is gonna be worse than Vegas  for most things we want to do. Especially in October.
---
Wait no guys this graph is terrible the steep curve means you gain skill very quickly. Y is labeled skill and X is time played. It should be the other way around.
---
Thanks
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Wow, thanks for all the information, I'll look into it, thank you!
---
Shield thorax + scythe : ) DPS galore
---
Good to know
---
You could have done that with one strong twat to the astero
---
being unfair mostly. almost all of the challenge i've encountered so far has been overleveled mobs, mobs packed too densely, mobs doing too much damage and having much higher dodge and parry chances. 
---
it's possible as a melee class to walk up to a mob and have it dodge parry and you miss until you just die and there was nothing you can do about it because of how far the leash distance is and needing to plan a route to leash the mob.
---
This game isn't actually that hard if you're willing to fail and see this as an entertaining part of the learning process.
---
Wow damn so you're telling me if I stay up till 5 am I could get STDs on the cheap?
---
twelve whole meters per second yeah  
---
and five whole percents less cap penalty while using more cap itself
---
Again: Coordinated effort should be balanced against personal effort or n+1 becomes the only viable playstyle. You can kick and scream and claim that there should be an unlimited and uncapped amounts of beneficial synergy effects associated with the number of players in a group, even if you do jackshit yourself. The other side disagrees. And so does CCP.
---
And right after you finish your training plan, then purchase the ship CCP will announce that they are going to nerf the nagalfar, rendering it useless. Wasting billions of isk and months of your time.
---
t2 ab is an actual improvement if you can fit
---
Well, as a hunter, this is the shittiest moment that i ever saw.
---
it's a possible tradeoff tbh, not the end of the world  
---
if you need the cpu for something else why not
---
Firstly, eve is great. I'm not going anywhere, i started in 2004 and still going.  
---
  
---
Secondly. I think you mean all the pubg clones.. Fortnite was an entirely different game before they thought "oh i know what we can copy!"
---
But you're right it is sad. But fear not. With this age of chaos the devs are finally getting things right. And i know a lot of old timers like me who are deciding to resub because of this. Eve isn't dead yet. It may have taken the devs a while to get clued into what eve needs but they are doing good things now, old players are returning and new players are joining. 
---
 
---
Don't be sad. It's about to get really good.
---
you never fit t2 mwd. ever.  
---
the whole industry is literally being kept alive by t2 producer lobbyists
---
They are one of the biggest lag generators there is in TIDI fights.
---
This.
---
We (her own corp)  put 2.5b in bounties on her as a joke when she started in our corp.
---
Nice to see it's still there.
---
That’s from 2011, they made gave better truesec systems *more* high end sites, which allowed more people to pile into a system.  
---
I’d be interested to see them limit ore belt and anomaly respawns rates to a much lower level, like ice belts.  Ice belts respawn on a 4(?) hour timer, ore belts should do the same. Anomalies can be faster, but they still respawn within a few minutes.
---
&gt; I do not want special treatment for me as a new player.
---
I don't want special treatment.  I do want the assurance that when someone kills me, it's because they were better and not because they sat on their ass until their invisible numbers could out-math mine in 99% of situations.  It's borderline impossible to learn the game when you have to outplay veterans by factors of 2 or 3 with zero indication that that's the case.
---
Same.  Only I had only been playing the game for maybe a month or two when it was announced.  Glad I did it though.  Was very painful however.  Drek is def. worth the train.
---
can’t tell if /s...
---
me too
---
Goons glassed tribute uncontested, do you really think they cant go an do the same to take those resources an leave you all with nothing? Making it harder an harder for the rest of us, Goons arent the issue good on them for getting their shit together after wwbee an building a space empire that every no risk pvper reees over.  CCP has just not devoted enough to invigorate or expand the game, taking stuff away never inspired someone to do more think about it (if take your crap awsy you worked for an saud go do it again now with less to get the same result you will go fuck you pal i aint doing it)
---
Maybe you're a shitty hunter. Because now hunting requires less skills.
---
I don't see how a +10 all attributes accelerators are in any way confusing.
---
I guess if you don't wrap your willy.
---
I just realized ive been playing this stupid game for 7 years....definitely earning that tattoo
---
someone under t2 web is going to be 10% slower than they would be under meta web  
---
triple rack of t2 damage mods is a 7% dps upgrade over triple rack of compacts, yes it's a big deal  
---
can't load null into t2 blasters i'm skipping the whole guns part actually  
---
t2 neut sucks harder and further also sucks harder on your cap but you make sure it sucks harder for the other guy than it sucks hard for you  
---
the 2 km extra range over closest meta on the t2 point means you'll hopefully slingshot outside range only 6 times instead of 2 because the guy warped out
---
etc etc  
---
are these qualities indispensable? well you'll have to sacrifice some of them to make room for others (welcome to pyfa online) but emphasis over the word "sacrifice".

How many skill points do I get from it?
---
I regret I have but one updoot to give for this comment.
---
fun
---
Vikings hate farmers and find them incomprehensible.
---
If EVE were designed by farmers, it would require players to have to setup certain conditions, sow their resources in their declared space, and then wait for it to mature at harvest time.
---
If raiders came along, they would burn down undefended resources and steal what little they could carry along the way.
---
The vikings would prefer that you all just get into your little longboats, and sing your own reasons for bashing each other about the head.  It doesn't matter if the others have more or bigger longboats.  The purpose of a longboat is to be a longboat and do the thing it does for the glory.
---
If this doesn't make sense to you, and you sit in your mead hall all day instead of getting into your longboats, then it must simply be what farmers do and not worth understanding.
---
hows the gameplay? :) any idea when this will be released?
---
Can bridge Asteros and Strats to any wormhole system from Thera.
---
Electronic space bubbles is how I'd describe the song. Love it as well tho :)
---
I relate to this so much. But I was mining in an imicus in Cat.
---
I'll just chip in with my experience, i've played for two days now. Start out with doing the tutorial and the career agent missions to get a feel of how the different paths works and what you like. You're really just dipping your toe into each career path, but it net's you some ships, items and around 10 million ISK. (Read the mission text to avoid unpleasant surprises, they're quite short).
---
After that you can decide on which direction you want to move in, and while all of it can feel quite overwhelming at times, you really don't have to learn everything. Just focus on the thing you're currently doing. I felt like trying out mining and conveniently got an invitation from a recruiting corp with focus on mining which welcomed new players. They're really nice and helpful, and I have access to high quality ore and can sell it off easily to the corp. 
---
Just give it a try. You might need some patience with the UI and huge amount of information available, but decide what you want to do and set some goals for yourself after the initial missions and it's really not that difficult. And again, find a corp which welcomes new members, they're great!
---
You say that, but I know several foreigners that go to eve vegas without doing any of the official CCP stuff.
---

&gt; Have a successful and growing fanfest
---
Fanfest wasn't really growing or successful.  Iceland is expensive to visit and not a great tourist town if you've already been once.  Moving Fanfest was actually a smart move.  Canceling a growing player meet in a globally recognized party town is a pretty shit idea though.
---
Wonder how many gallons of paint went down on that one
---
They gatecamped the M-O to 15W pipe incessantly. That's where the kills come from.
---
Those bait WERMT were all NCdot alts.
---
Asks an honest question, gets downvoted :(
---
I gave you and upvote, but you're still negative. Sorry ericader.
---
Yup!  Possibly use T1 missile launchers and HAM’s until you are skilled up...would be an experiment though.
---
Yes of course there are. The standard Wingspan joke is about them sitting off a highsec wormhole though.
---
For frigates Kestrels or Condors with Bantams, for bigger stuff Augorers and Prophecies or Caracles and Scythes (or Ospreys if you want to try cap chains).
---
Lol. Youre funny. All I hear is the same BS Ive heard from you guys for years. Nerf everyone else so we who are putting in the least amount of effort can get the biggest gains. Its a massively demented approach to things.
---
And the very fact that you are agreeing with CCP is actually the funniest part of all.
---
I’m genuinely disappointed this post wasn't a full parody.
---
I don't have the source, but it's hardly a secret around here that CCP has incredibly low new-player retention. You're a very rare exception, not the rule, and even you admit that you were not truly retained as a new player, but quit and only came back years later.
---
You know what's worth going to war for?
---
Hatred.
---
Never going to happen again though now every nullblock sits in the same chat rooms and discord reminiscing about old times.
---
DC? Are you high? That’s a swamp filled with politicians and whores... on second thought... maybe you are on to something...
---
What would make sense is doing one event on the East Coast and another on the West Coast.
---
&gt;look ccp has a good product it is just time and again they show a lasck of understanding the players of the game. 
---
And the 19 years of not understanding the code.
---
Very true.
---
And I would add that there is a huge component of enjoyment which does not calculate to ISK...if you like to mine, and all the cool min/max and research and skill trees that go into that Indy profession then do so!  Also interesting to think that what you mine will wind up in some small way in the manufacturing products that drive everything that happens in this game, from ships to structures.
---
AFAIK we don't have bots on Reddit. With thousands of members on the site, I don't think we need them. 
---
That said, it's bad form to downvote other corps/alliances just because they aren't us.
---
&gt;People are most def saying this. The EHP nerfs to supers/titans are saying just this. Olmecas comments about how subcap fleets should be able to alpha titans is saying just this.
---
If he was serious about wanting 200 battleships to alpha a titan, then he clearly is off his rocker and everyone else will agree.
---
Nerfing super and titan EHP is most definitely not saying "nanogangs should be killing titans left and right" but rather than dread bombs shouldn't be as-easily countered by faxes and that DD slugfests should be bloodier. I totally agree, having flown all of the above in all sorts of engagements in null.
---
Don't forget this is a game. It's not about "evening the scales" in a vaccuum or "it's only fair that 1000 people playing 10 hours a day can never lose anything to 10 guys who play 2 hours a day." CCP knows this, thankfully, even if they're slow to show it and go about showing it in perhaps-less-than-ideal ways.
---
You sound like a broken record:) An ignorant one on top of it:)
---
This. If there's anything EVE players do well it's work with details and organize.
---
yes i read it and im saying to allow rorqs to jump through this cheap cyno would be a mistake
---
The Overview comment is spot on. The default overview (the table on the right with a list of nearby ships and planets) is junk. The filters are not well thought-out. There are plenty of good options around, just ask in one of the newbie help channels. I liked Sarashawa's, but Z-S is also common. Eventually you'll start fiddling and making your own, but it's painful to START that way.
---
There's only one resource that drives conflict in EVE: member count.
---
Got ur back fam))
---
Finally someone gets it. The boys who sit to pee are the ones who clean bathrooms, if I don't have to scrub sideways morning wood piss off things that's well worth it
---
Oh yeah. Scamming and being a jerk is totally within the rules, and encouraged actually. For example, don't ever trust an "ISK Doubling Service" or an in-game Bank. They will take your ISK and laugh at you. 
---
Especially when you are in the Jita star system (the main trade hub is Jita - planet 4 moon 4) just ignore trade offers you get, and completely ignore the local chat. It's almost all scams.
---
In order for new empires to rise the old need to fall.
---
EVE has music anymore? 
---
Jon or bust :(
---
&gt; Problem is those battles are the ones that get media attention, and so attract the new players CCP desperately needs.
---
Nah.  You don't need super blob fights to attract new players.  Eve attracts new players pretty well on its own, it just loses a huge proportion of them.  As far as media attention there's not really anything that separates subcaps and supercaps other than "value," but getting a record number of people in a subcap tidi-fest is going to get as much attention as doing it in supers.  It's not like the media is paying really any attention to super blobs as it is.
---
It's the old players who overvalue supers so much.  New players don't care about goals they are years away from if the game leading up to that goal isn't fun in and of itself.  Supers/caps being more difficult to use sure as shit isn't what's driving them away.
---
And there is always this!
---
[The Big Career Map](https://www.alpha-orbital.com/news/the-big-eve-online-career-chart)
---
Welcome to r/eve
---
7.5/minute for the entire duration
---
ccp limited spawns to 1 now, so it's much different than it has been in the past... keep your options open
---
It's literally what makes the game so great is the pvp.  No handholds, you screw up lose your ship its gone forever, and you have to buy a new one.
---
So you missed the maybe part?
---
you know that observatory was just a dumb shit salty krab found and put that and reddit and now a fuckton of idiot believe CCP gonna put that in game ?   
---
they never said blackout was permanent or if blackout gonna stop, but they seem to prefer the first one judging by the recent interview of hilmar  
---
and no they don't want to make NS more safer the "chaos era" is a transition betwen a "safe NS" into a "cruel but fair place" just wait some month you will see asset safety change, no more umbrella and a NS more rewarding but moooar dangerous, that what CCP want to do
---
There's a difference between being able to do this and it happening frequently and it happening frequently with the people doing it not just welping to you.
---
Eve doesn't actually have much of this happening on a large scale, as in someone new joins and buys his way to t2 battleships and cap alts in a month or three. And plenty of the folks who do stuff like that are still bad pilots who die easily.
---
Honestly playing in null blocs, it was much more common to see people who played to earn isk to inject alts, or a new player with 1 account who does training by exploring all day, or someone who regularly lapsed into alpha cause he couldnt afford to Plex and wouldn't spend real money... than to see someone who legitimately credit card warriors. Those who swipe to play tend to be vets who can't be assed to play to sustain their PvP anymore, not newcomers becoming uber with no ingame time invested.
---
Time to buy a fury suit I guess. Not sure I’m into this but I’m willing to give  it a try.
---
It is... quit like me and you can win the game too!
---
Shusshh, don’t poke around things you don’t want to know the answer to. Ccp’s business model of selling multiple subscriptions to each player is not a cancer at all, everything is just fine. Eyes forward, no questions asked.
---
I feel like this video is a great summary of the current elite pvp crowd
---
so you’re really missing the point of the comment??
---
50% dealin', 50% chillin
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I mean.. I also don't need to worry about the ships I lose..?
---
The only difference is that I know what I am doing (mostly) while $ doesn't buy you skill. Nor does isk. So your entire point is kind of moot to me.
---
Even WHs have become more tame, because there are more people there... because you can live there. It should be visited and if anything a rare "living out of an Orca suitcase" semi-permanence. This would make it require more players for C5-C6, more risk and MORE traffic for pirates and such.
---
NS should still be that way. LS was that in the past, but (as you said) people just bypass it now.
---
CCP also made LS and HS security status not mean as much as it could. There really isn't a difference between 1.0 and 0.5, but 0.4 is a steep cliff to drop off into the abyss that is 0.4 through 0.1 (which are also basically the same). And yes, there ARE differences between levels, but not really in a "safety" sense.
---
The Trig invasions making changes to how your ship/drones/weapons operate, now that's an idea. Make the danger go up by degrees in some way. Give each level its own ecosystem that preys upon and takes advantage of another in unique ways.
---
Eve is too safe.
---
Chaos is a weak attempt to make it less safe and more interesting.
---
The problem I have with this chart is that the "time played" and "skill" axes are the wrong way around.
---
Taking the chart literally, after a week or two of playing I would be on the top plateau of the chart along with all the long-time veterans.
---
Why does it matter what other ships people can fly?
---
I hate to tell you... but... you're on r/eve
---
Take a break, come back fresh
---
Fyi, life itself is pretty pointless, so yeah it is, just like everything else
---
Rough guideline is:
---
Amarr - Phased Plasma
---
Gallente - Fusion
---
Caldari - EMP
---
Minmatar - Kinetic/Explosive (so just use Fusion if you're flying a projectile ship)
---
Dude wtf do you think people are saying. You think Olmeca got elected for saying other shit than exactly that? The issue is that people are actually agreeing. I dont know if you have actually read this sub lately?
---
Thats a FAX issue, not EHP issue. You already dont have enough reasons to deploy them. Nerfing them to shit will only make it worse. 
---
You are talking about evening the scales and Im letting you know this isnt even remotely close to doing that. The scale has always been tipped in favor of the attacker, always. They get to pick the target and when to leave grid. And the killboards agree, always had. If you are not willing to put in the time and effort then why the fuck are people using arguments like "hardcore" and shit.
---
You want a sandbox? In that sandbox you dont get shit if you are 10 playing 2 hours against the bigger group. Thats a fact, thats a game thats hardcore and honestly, in pretty much every other game that is true. Maybe the PvPers need to go to WoW instead of telling the PvEers to do it?
---
The solution would be to do a Vegas and an Atlanta / Charlotte / other East Coast area event.
---
You dont like it fine. But I said maybe and its such a small part of the entire argument that its not even relevant. You are completely glossing over the main argument to argue about something I said maybe about.
---
Here's what matters... your ship, how it's fit, the mods, the rigs, the ammo, your skills, your boosters, your fleet, and how you fly.
---
It's basically a ton of mathematical equations going on with a bunch of variables and you're flying around trying to control them all. 
---
The little dots on the screen are all ships or drones moving around calculating the answers. 
---
In the end you probably just pressed F1 and anchored yourself into another ship.

I wish I could upvote this post 100 times
---
Because if you accidentally visit r/eve for help or whatever, youll get buried in negativity unless its a complaint about whatever is popular to complain about at the time
---
I’ve never played wow but I sense quite a bit of irony there.
---
Look up Gitzo Gutface ingame, we have a pretty casual hisec corp. With some moons every week and some guys to shittalk to whenever you feel lile it. Also se reasonably experienced abyss runners.
---
No obligations, lower taxes than npc corp, nice and casual for the working man :)
---
Not really, it's up to anyones desire to get isk with real money or time spent playing, the loss is real either way; "already replaced" is a meme that still applies to both situations and is mocked alike in both scenarios.
---
If you kill me you have taken away time I spent earning that isk, if I kill you I take away some money out of your pocket and burned it... I don't see how one is "less significant" than the other. 
---
And I'm not really sure that "significant" could even be applied to a game I choose to play risking time and/or money, because I have fun doing it so any of those has been well spent in my opinion.
---
There is no pw2, feel free to inject into a perfect HAC and bling it to death, watching it die two jumps into Lowsec to the hands of five dudes flying t1 frigates will be hilarious.
---
[removed]
---
It's varied and complex.
---
PvP happens in lots of different areas of space, that are a lot different. And with lots of different ship types and compositions of different ships together in fleets.
---
Generally the dots you see are other ships or their little drones they launch as weapons. People steer their ship in space with mouse movements and shortcuts more like a RTS than a flight sim, though there is limited (and not recommended) flight sim potential. 
---
There are several classes of ships, some with special perks but the biggest differences being size, toughness, speed, and weapon ranges, from frigates to destroyers to cruisers to battlecruisers, battleships, and capital ships. 
---
Ships fit "modules" which are Eve's version of WOWs gear/equipment. Modules range from guns or missile launchers to afterburners to different sorts of tank modules to make you tougher or repair damage, mods you activate or mods passively active, etc. There are different weapon systems with different ranges and damage types that work better or worse against different enemies (small and fast and shield tanked? Big and slow but armor tanked? Different weapon platforms and damage types are best).
---
High-security space is where you start. NPCs do a little bit to protect you and a lot to get revenge if you're aggressed against, but it's still not "safe" space. PvP often is ganks where the attacker knows NPC police will kill him, but he burns down a soft and valuable target first, usually with friends/alts collecting loot. There's war declarations legalizing combat between parties. And there's criminals you can go vigilante on. And more.
---
Lowsec is kinda like highsec but without NPC police. So aggressors have little penalty for engaging, and it's home to a lot fewer carebears. All sorts of ships are present, but there's an extra lot of small ship, solo and small gang fighting centered around factional warfare. Frigate and destroyer 1v1s and small fights are fast paced and nuanced, often lasting 30-50 seconds and easily won or lost on one split-second decision. They take place at close ranges, with fast moving ships that have short range weapons, inside a sort of instance limiting the size of ships that come in.
---
Nullsec is no npc protection at all, and rules about using aoe weapons and Doomsday's and warp disruption bubbles (aoe "you can't warp away to safety, DIE! modules) are usable. Fights can be small still but with a different ship focus to cover a lot of ground and fight at range to not get caught by numerically superior locals. Large fights often are "fleet" fights with hundreds per side, leadership carefully selecting and monitoring the ships and modules used by members and precise mixes of damage dealers, support ships, scouts, etc uses. Capital battles are more common, huge groups live in nullsec.
---
Wormhole space/jspace is nullsec too but in solar systems connected by random-ish wormholes, and even some more safety nets are missing to make fights even more so or die and painful to lose. No supercaps, wormholes have mass restrictions limiting the size and number of ships that can move through them (and then back home!). It tends to mean smaller groups and fights but more expensive ships.
---
I'm losing steam.
---
this is the most autistic picture I've ever seen
---
I bought a heap of plex and when I started to help me out, then realised I had no motivation to play because I had all the money in the world. I eventually gave all my Isk to an alt and started again, it is much more rewarding having to work towards buying stuff now.
---
Hey, Falcon can we take a look at Rorquals again?  I feel like there’s a way we can make Rorqual mining more sociable and introduce new players at the same time.
---
Yet here you are on the eve subreddit... :P
---
They are pure garbage vs small shit. Light fighters should do more damage than light drones to a frigate.
---
Damn you, not only I tried to read your entire post like it's lyrics to that song, now it's also stuck in my head!
---
I love this.
---
So I can control my ship and shoot whenever I want? Is this in 1st person? I haven’t seen anything like this in gameplays
---
Merge the kill rights mechanic with this. Only someone with kill rights can open a bounty. You sell the rights to an agent, who then resells it to a player at a little less than full value (his commission being an isk sink). After that it would work like the above suggestion
---
He put way too much effort into making that point...
---
wat are you talking about? you either want to play in a sandbox or you don´t. if you don´t then take your low effort krab friends and go fuck off. go run 6 hour sessions of AoE 2 without attacking each other or some BS.   
---
&gt; Nerf everyone else so we who are putting in the least amount of effort can get the biggest gains
---
on average it´s the member of a  megacoalition that has to put in the least amount effort. i don´t see any reason why lazyness should be rewarded. 
---
&gt; the very fact that you are agreeing with CCP
---
can´t beleive it myself tbh

PvP works like most MMOs. Click button, do action to your target. The major difference is that your setup is almost endlessly customizable. The reason everything looks like dots is because they are zoomed out to a super wide view because it's hundreds of dudes fighting hundreds of other dudes, so every one is looking at it like a friend or foe display, not at individual ship models.
---
Ancient Philosopher Nietzsche say, if you gaze long enough into EVE Online...
---
Eh, injectors are here here to stay friendo. fwiw, life is precisely as pointless as EVE, yet here we are together on this dumb sub. If you feel the ol' MMO ennui then do something else for a while until you feel the itch again (or not, as the case may be).
---
&gt;hard working gamer's day
---
lol, good one
---
It does if they do exist ;p Back when moon distribution mattered a lot more and even before then when there was only crok up north and ark down south and no other way to get high end mins then .0 yeah it kinda fucking mattered ;p
---
Approach, zoom in, turn on mwd then double click right on the ship to keep going in straight line.  I bump/kill afk off citadels often.....
---
I think we need to stop balancing around this mythical small group of people waiting to grab some null space. They don't really exist and there isn't much we can do to support them if they did. You either make space valuable and the big blocks want it, or you make it useless and no one cares.
---
EVE PvP is a battle in which one player attempts to nullify a portion of another person's lifespan ( in real life ), let me elaborate:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Player A - Grinds some isk making activity for 4 hours and uses those resources to put together a ship
---
Player B - Grinds  some isk making activity for 8 hours and uses those resources to put together a ship
---
Player A thinks with his 4 hours + skills, it will overcome Player B's 8 hours + skills; regardless when they come head to head one of them is going to lose their ship ... but more importantly the time ( lifespan ) it took to put that ship together.
---
It is why people's hands shake and their heartbeat sky rockets, you are literally putting on the line your real physical time ( something you should see as precious ) in the form of a ship, this becomes even more dramatic the more expensive a ship ( Titan , Super carrier , etc ... ).
---
Sometimes I'm concerned about the individuals who literally spends months grinding something, only to lose it in a moment ( a gank while in transit ) ... in those cases the ganker has literally removed a portion of the victims lifespan with no enjoyment given in return.
---
EvE is terrifying and exhilarating in that way. Gamble your lifespan responsibly.
---
that´s why i never bought PLEX. feels shallow af.
---
kintzel has it down to a art form so, cant see why no one else can just gotta be fast
---
So many ways to interpret that chaotic curve and once you are on the top, shitty things happen...
---
I want the sandbox. Its you that doesnt want it. You want to change the rules of the sandbox because you cant put in the work. Thats indicative of someone who fking doesnt want the sandbox. This isnt balance, in no way or means. This is "CCP give us crutches because we cant operate in the sandbox" BS.
---
On average sure. But its hell of lot of not average people that far outweighs the small gang.
---
And on the subject, can you even give me one good reason why it should matter if small gangs even exist in the game? I mean seriously, wtf are you guys even bringing to the table? Outside of tears.
---
Arty Thrashers if you don't mind doing a bit of up-shipping. Another one is the derptron.
---
Sorta like how the Mercoxit anomalies spawn randomly throughout systems? I wouldn’t mind this. I would throw in there that you had to actively probe down the anomalies. This would kill cloaky camping with the added benefit of forcing miners to still have to actively DSCAN. “Fair but cruel.”
---
Love the opsec! Hope the big DK form goes well tomorrow for the Strat Op!
---
Eve isn't about the ships you fly, it's about the people you fly with. I'd much rather go on a meme fleet with some buddies than solo in an ultra bling ship.
---
Except that with 300b isk sitting around, I still get shakes using 10m isk frigates in FW, even after 70ish fights now. Lol.
---
Sounds like it's time to fly AT ships. If a $3000 USD loss doesn't hurt you, you could always send me like 100k to pay off my student loans :P
---
To elaborate, while most PvP does take place with zoom levels where you can't see your ship model well (even at 20km zoom, which is nearly useless for most PvP, a battleship is still just a little blob), smaller scale stuff often involves close viewing of ships. You can identify what sort of weapons your enemy has and therefore know what range he wants to fight at and sometimes other features of his fit that are likely based on knowing how much "fitting" those weapons take up of your ships total available power grid and CPU. Stuff like that.
---
But yeah generally you're zoomed out far enough in PvP to not see any ship details because the wider view is often crucial to seeing/understanding what's happening.
---
so you have enough money to play the game without worrying about losses, go play now instead of counting your isk in station.
---
Think of the ~~children~~ spouses.
---
Armor AFs with frig logi
---
Kyte RLML caracals with a ceptor or two. Works with other kyte ships too.
---
T1 armor logi, some buffer fit t1 cruisers, a command dessys for some boosts, and an ash for the webs.
---
Think about it like this- you're captaining your ship and giving commands to its crew. You tell it what to do and where to go, but you aren't controlling it in the same way that you would be controlling a plane in a flight sim or something. 
---
You can play in first person or third. I would strongly recommend playing only in third.
---
I think I first saw this a decade ago.
---
I laugh out loud every time I see it.
---
You are not doing Eve right.
---
Train an interceptor first, then.....
---
If assets dropped from citadels you’d see a lot more conflict.
---
I consistently hear this line being towed. We need less resources and more scarcity. What if CCP were to go the opposite route and  give us more space to explore than we know what to do with? Like entire systems you can only get to through wormholes because they’ve been abandoned, empty npc stations that you can capture, etc?
---
Some groups use beam legions, if the enemy isn't using muninns they can be quite strong
---
Eve is gaining new Alpha players weekly.
---
hey, I think to be fair, you really need to revise the way you form conclusions. You think Im saying no randomly? You are pretty assuredly just forming conclusions based on purely anecdotal info... based on the people you surround yourself with... that my friend, is a thorough head in ass! haha
---
Very cool! I assume you signed an NDA, but if you could share any info that would be awesome!
---
Roleplaying CCP by ignoring low sec.  I like it.
---
t2 will be cheaper, but faction can be very affordable. Also, sometimes the performance gain is worth it. faction points in particular, and scrams can be pricey but very very useful
---
It’s all good that is the price
---
I like them but honestly I love the fleet coms when they put those on there as well. That way you can listen to the FC loose his shit, or after shit hits the fan you can here the comradery of people talking about their losses.
---
No
---
What is safer...?
---
&gt; its literally just flying far enough away and then hitting approach
---
THIS is why people are bad at bumping. Because they think like that.
---
WoW always reminded me of hokey pokey, at least raiding.  You put your warriors in, you take your warriors out. You put your healers outside the circle  you put your dps inside the circle. Then you shake them all about. That's what raiding is all about.
---
The larger ship with the more expensive fitting wins. I often loose to bigger ships. I love pvp with all of my heart.
---
They tried with a similar game..Dust and CCP failed miserably.  
---
Eve needs a massive overhaul or just make Eve 2 and have these design elements in from the get go.
---
Turns out 2019 empire building has nothing much to do with in-game pvp.
---
It's much simpler than all of that. Anyone who is dumb enough to start a petition like this (and try to brag about the inconsequential amount of signatures) is typically not someone whose opinion matters in the slightest about anything remotely relevant.
---
NOLA would be a very, very, good alternative to Las Vegas....if any would work it would be NOLA.
---
It depends. Some do truly enjoy that kind of videos, each to their own etc.
---
Some of my favorites used to be Jonnypews, also known as Sir Livingstons EVE Videos. They were invabluable to me when I was a lil newbie. Hunting for drones in high/lowsec. Salvaging wrecks in FW for T2 rig salvage etc. So much info, unfortunately Jonnypews videos have been deleted.
---
As for today, Lussy Lou's videos on youtube are pretty great, he does some truly insane bonkers stuff and sometimes gets away with it, dunks entire fleets by himself/with a small group. A+ Piloting most often.
---
Bait Post #322
---
I hope this is real.
---
I doubt it. San Diego driving to Las Vegas is only 5 hours (If you drive the speed limit)
---
Flying is under a hour. I believe most San Diegan's easily take the time to make it to Vegas. Those who do not probably do not care either way about EVE Meets and will go to EVE San Diego simply because it is there and they do not have to travel to get to it, IMO.
---
NOLA would be the best alternate choice.
---
My suggestion would be to park some T2 fit frigates in Amamake and fight in the plexes.
---
Pit your skills against all who come. Don’t out ISK them with pods a s fittings, work in improving. That will develops skills that give you what you are looking for I believe
---
Nothing. That's not what this is about. I'm referring to the risk people would take if they worked hard for their assets vs someone who bought it all and can replace it instantaneously. 
---
There's truth behind it. Whether you want to believe it or not. I'm open for a decent debate if you're up for it.
---
Plus the fact when someone talks shit you can destroy their stuff and on a single server there have few places to hide means the shitty players learn to keep their mouth shut. Unlike every other mmo, talking shit gets you hit in EvE.
---
My corp meetup every year is in Austin. I love Austin, and specifically Southern Austin, but people in Austin have no fucking idea how to drive. That is the worst traffic I've ever seen.
---
I’ve played EVE on and off since 2008, and only started reading this sub in the last 6 months. 
---
Obviously fake but god damn if number 3 doesn’t hit the hail on the head. This sub really sucks the enjoyment out of the game. 
---
Reeee rorquals are too strong, reeee now rorquals aren’t worth it, reeee VNI bots, reeee no AT, reeee blackout, reeeee zkill/dotlan, reeee chat x1000, reeeee bombers OP, reeee free SP, reeee cyno changes, reeee EVE Vegas. 
---
It’s never ending. Valid complaints or not I guarantee you this sub has ruined the game for many people who got sucked into this cycle of negativity.
---
If there is one thing Eve has been consistent about since day 1 it has been the ability of extracting salt from every single type of player.
---
I enjoyed Vegas a lot. I would definitely go back. I will not go to San Diego. I'm not a fan of the area, and Vegas is so fucking cheap to get to from pretty much anywhere that doesn't charge a bible tax on flights to there. This is one of the strangest decisions I've seen in a long time.
---
Can't wait for the Triglavian Interceptors. Time to fit AX weapons
---
How many people are you suggesting plex for all their ships and why do you think that people care less about the ships they  pay for with real life money, then they buy with virtual currency?
---
I guess there's still people who are too lazy to play the actual game. They prefer to bypass the effort and go straight to elite.
---
When I was playing wow I found it much more enjoyable if I never read the sub. I can't say the same thing about Eve for some reason, but I 100% believe that others have the same issue with Eve
---
So I'm going out on a limb and saying this whole post is because snuffed are reffing all the deadco jammers. Adapt or die
---
How is that supposed to be better than info provoded by existing useful tools like pathfinder or siggy ?
---
Funny story: We had a Goon Meet in Austin this year, and I had the pleasure of driving Mittens and Tuzy to lunch one day. Not only did I accidentally go 30 minutes out of the way, we nearly died when I juked onto an off ramp at the last second.
---
🤦🏼‍♂️👌
---
Its not hard to cycle mwd off to give yourself time to align, though
---
&gt; I juked onto an off ramp at the last second.
---
The locals just assumed you were an Austin resident then.
---
Option 3 of course. :)
---
&gt; I want the sandbox.
---
No, you don´t. You want to sit in your little low effort wonderland where everything is spoonfed to you. And besides a few tiny pockets of activity outside these environments that´s all that´s left of your precious sandbox. Reality Check: It´s pretty fucking dead mate. 
---
 &gt; You want to change the rules of the sandbox
---
The rules get changed all the fucking time and that´s always been the case. Stop talking out of your ass. 
---
&gt; CCP give us crutches because we cant operate in the sandbox
---
same right back at you tbh
---
&gt; On average sure. 
---
hmhm
---
&gt; But its hell of lot of not average people that far outweighs the small gang
---
good. where is the problem then?
---
&gt; And on the subject, can you even give me one good reason why it should matter if small gangs even exist in the game?
---
Because streamlined large scale engagements are pretty fucking boring and unengaging for anyone with at least 1 fold in their brain? Because new player entities usually don´t have 250 fleets full of super caps to throw around to establish themselves? Because a diverse PvP meta and political scene is more engaging for everyone involved? 
---
&gt; I mean seriously, wtf are you guys even bringing to the table?
---
Currently nothing. Because, as we established, personal effort became irrelevant in this game. Also who is you guys? I haven´t smol scaled in years.
---
You seem to be speaking from a pvpers perspective who I assume spends most of their time hunting in nullsec. Blackout didn’t fail because local disappeared. Blackout failed because CCP didn’t turn off the lights completely and tear up the maps and force players to link systems on their own with the new gate system.
---
That's good to know, and it makes sense why they made the change.  Lately in Vegas I've been staying at non-smoking spa hotels and I gotta tell you, it's amazing to breathe and not stink of smoke constantly.
---
Game=changed
---
I talk shit so people will potentially fight me.   People blueball my name alot :(
---
i'm more of the idea of skill locking
---
E.g. remove skill points from caldari frigate get an injector for caldari frigate 
---
i'd also allow players to remove skill from prerequisite skill but it turns of the skill and access to those skills
---
Eve is pointless if isk is the only thing you care about and it doesn't matter if you buy or farm it.
---
Not being edgy or anything but what you do in-game and what you do out of game are both cosmically "pointless", we all die in the end. So go cause ripples in meatspace and evespace. It's about the journey and all the shenanigans, the experiences you can create and the stories. All the empires and collections we build won't follow us into the next life. Use your imagination.
---
One of the stupidest things an EvE Dev ever said considering every system with prices uses price as a balancing factor.
---
Wish they'd bring it back.
---
I'd like to see it change after say 2 or 3 cycles an r4 could become an r64 and r64 to an r32 or 16 or what ever 
---
but having moons change is a great idea
---
No, anything like that will completely kill eve.
---
Did you just assume their gender?!
---
You're better off googling application errors yourself.  What do you mean quit working?  Have you done all the basics like reinstall?
---
What are you talking about. Ns is not like whs and sites dont respawn instantly.
---
They'd have to have another game to make this worthwhile.
---
must do - or you wouldn't be whining about how you can't blow up their ships.
---
&gt; I don't see it so bad on that aspect.
---
easily creatable skill farms are not a good thing.
---
People figured out how to make a profit off of them so CCP got rid of them.
---
Agree I just told him this on discord. :-)
---
Saying that EVE is a primarily PvP game, and that everything else is in service to the PvP, is not the same as saying "play like me or your doing it wrong". Yes, there are ways to play the game that don't involve directly engaging in PvP but that doesn't change the fact that EVE is at its core a PvP game and that the game must be balanced around the PvP.
---
If your desire for Farmville in Space means that PvP becomes less fun, then it is the Farmville in Space playstyle that must be on the chopping block first. If you don't like that, there are other sandbox games that aren't PvP focused, like X3 or WoW. Take your pick.
---
NC PL moved all their alt corps to BOT, all renters had already already moved to BOT or been kicked
---
Just public download.. still needs an activation key.
---
Having numbers or assets =/ PvP prowess.
---
Well, yeah. But who among us didn't lie about our country and have a couple keys in their emails? :D
---
Small gang PvP is great to watch if you actually know what's going on.. F1 fights are boring.
---
Nope, dad refers the male parent. Gender may have fluidity, but biological sex as related to parentage doesn't .
---
no, because all you usually see are a few coloured boxes and not much else.
---
it's the shittiest spectator sport going.
---
Anything with cruisers or battle cruisers as a core, they're dirt cheap.
---
so if you've got so many kills, why are you constantly whining?
---
Kitchen sink is pretty hard for a beginner FC, it's better to learn the basics if you're going for actual fleet concepts
---
Why buff a ship that can do basically everything in a wormhole
---
No-one is trying to take away any and all intel. There is a difference between real human players actively communicating intel and a script running in the background, collating information and sending it out to everyone else without a human ever having to lift a finger to type or open their mouth to talk. It's the equivalent of an intel bot. If you can understand why playing the game is OK and botting is not, you really shouldn't be confused here.
---
I fuckin did it. I upvoted you. The fuck is this sub becoming...
---
maybe if the game didn't have so many issues, there wouldn't be so many complaints?
---
One of my favorite boots off Eve lore: Some of the warp to zero bookmarks would lead to an armed pos set to shoot on sight.
---
Eve with some shit song overlaid is waste of time. Only watch with compelling commentary.
---
I'd recommend doing abyssal sites in frigates. You can do T2s in decently cheap things, and it'll be a decent challenge.
---

You realise what a sandbox is right? The ability to do whatever the fuck I want and my effort matters. Its not your choice what my choices should be. 
---
Ye no local and cyno changes are just like every other changes. Stupid reasoning.
---
Right, the last years of crying because your nanogang cant kill carriers have been the same. Luuuul.
---
Pretty much never. I mean, you are part of an instant gratification group that really dont give much back. I dont think you ever did. Now its usually not an issue but when you want to change the game to suit your needs...
---
Im simply not impressed.
---
&gt; Zkill confirms this: https://zkillboard.com/ship/52645/

Then why does this killmail exist?  Which happened *after* you made this post?

https://zkillboard.com/kill/78684973/
---
I’m not gonna lie.
---
I miss the long training.  It gave purpose to flying specific ships and made me feel good when i got there, not every fight was against cookie cutter minmaxed frigates because they’re op but was whatever they chose to commit to
---
And it was rewarding
---
I'm only glad that I've already learned my lessons about trusting game subreddits or boards in general without a big grain of salt. Most people on any gaming board or forum are just mad. Doesn't matter what, they're just mad at something.
---
Thanks, I had a look and couldn't find the updated list.  In any case, it's still not 'available to all'.

Can you not see how writing...

---
I have just shown you that the sources for the objective data. The MER is fking objective data. And you pull anecdotal info as a response.
---
Dude, its okey, you dont agree. But dont be an idiot. Dont be that guy that even when everything points to an obvious conclusion you still sit around trying to be smart.
---
All enough, compared to those who had potential access before.
---
Hey freedom of speach is only valid if I get to say what I want.
---
I was a bitter angry vanilla player when I read the realm forums every day.
---
Stopped reading them at all in tbc and had a great 10 years after that.
---
I want others to get kills and fun.
---
Players are passionate about the game. They want their voices to be heard. Where else can this happen. Maybe instead of complaining about complainers make a solution to the problem, like a subreddit dedicated to new players for eve or something constructive.
---
People complaining about people complaining is always amusingly hypocritical.
---
i played elite dangerous for a while.
---
it was pretty shallow at release but these days they seem to have added more content - no idea if it's still grindy as fuck though. pretty good at scractching the spaceship itch when you want to feel like you're actually flying a ship, though.
---
if you can do it,  then they can too. there's clearly nothing stopping them if they want to do it.
---
It goes something like this, you push a couple of buttons, preferably on non shooting targets and then you act smug about it until you need your next fix. And if you dont get what you want you cry on this sub for years until CCP breaks down and make it easier for you to be "elite":)
---
Meh, I'm just salty that I've got a modern-ish phone and an access code but still can't play it.
---
But what if your mom gets a change after birth and now is your second dad?
---
X3 is pretty much the singleplayer equivalent of EVE.
---
I know I wont stand for this. 
---
Praise the Far Gods! Prepare to die!
---
(Inb4 "reee some scumbag griefer just killed me. TFAS is literally terrorists and they need help IRL."  I love Elite but fuck ED players.)
---
\&gt; EDIT: so what your all saying is theres no reason to goto war, no reason to start one because the null blocs will just merge, all you want todo is Krab, wars are too hard, CCP isnt doing enough, CCP should do nothing and Goons have already won eve so why try? ...man what happened to eve players, we used to be cool. Fuck this noise I might aswell unsubb but not because CCP killed the game. It's because We killed the game.
---
AND NO YOU CANT HAVE MY STUFF!
---
Don't let these retards get you down, Eve is a game of retard vs non-retard that's how its always been. Lots of stupid fucks want this to be farmville-in-space at-least CCP has enough brains to see what's happening considering recent and near future changes (finally)
---
Hope for next round though! Since I doubt they'll go back on the region, only add more phones/people.
---
&gt; There is no way local would ever serve another purpose than intel man. I mean its literal information. No dude, these were not loopholes. Im not saying its cool to drop caps on everything but its not cheating.
---
Instant intel became a problem when people started to use 3rd party tools like Near2 etc. It was a huge loophole. And dropping caps on everything isn't cheating it's just bad gameplay.
---
&gt;Honestly, when was NS this hardcore endgame content area?
---
When Eve still had 40-60k players logged in. During the golden years.
---
&gt;The blackout isnt needed for the economy
---
It's needed because instant intel is too easy to abuse with 3rd party tools. It just doesn't work. We need more chaos.
---
&gt;Cyno change will only bring stagnation.
---
Combined with the other changes it might make things interesting again. Smaller scale skirmishes around Eve will be possible again. Currently you can't do shit in smaller scale. Old CSM member Ripard Teg wrote while ago better than I can ever say it: 
---
&gt;EVE gained its fame and its player base from being a sand box that welcomed every type of play. That's gone now, and only two types of game play are valued: hard-core PvE and hard-core massive alliance sov battles.
---
CCP: "The chaos era isn't killing eve as quickly as we would like. Lets cancel our most popular player gathering "
---
What are you doing the exact moment before it stops working?
---
Its still finite (during a timeperiod), the amount has an upper limit. Issue it that the upper limit is way too high. It should be drastically reduced so that each system can only maintain a certain amount of players thereby forcing people to spread out. Atm you have systems that can maintain perhaps 50 people, that number should be perhaps 10.
---
&gt; if you can do it, then they can too.
---
None of this is about possibility or impossibility of frags. Which is why "look a super died in Delve" was never a good argument. It was always about inaccessibility of frags due to the sheer effort or luck it takes.
---
Btw, notice how we're already miles away from your initial argument "defending krabs takes PvP skill". You should raise your argumentative level above the elementary school level. I'm not here to chickenfight with every half-thought knee jerk response you have.
---
CCP customer support is a joke. Answer time range from 1 day to 7 months!!! I had some tickets opened for 3 months, and then closed by CCP without answer. Just go find fix on google, it will be faster. Or just do clean reinstall.
---
The end goal is to balance the risk vs reward. 
---
Balance to intel networks, super cap umbrellas, cynos, capitals, Afk ratting using said intel network and Botting. 
---
This has all been explained to you in several responses quite clearly. At this point you are either trolling or clinically retarded.
---
Looking at zkill, there is a weird gap of kills. It's about 24 hours long. 
---
So they're out and about again, but there definitely was a temporary disappearance.
---
I'm not op, was just telling you how much SP/min since you asked.  Wouldn't be hard to add that text to a booster though.
---
Probably should have mentioned that I also play elite and x4... oops
---
Really depends on what you want from the game. I would say something like Old school runescape is probably the closest thing you can get to the loss mechanic in current eve. I know it's not space but tbh if there was something even close to eve on the market im sure people would be evacuation to it. (at least that's the perceived r/eve response.  If you want space battle's homeworld remastered and homeworld emergence are pretty good RTS games.
---
&gt; The ability to do whatever the fuck I want and my effort matters
---
your efforts are next to non-existent, why should they matter? i can tell by your self-entitled bitching and moaning.
---
&gt; Ye no local and cyno changes are just like every other changes. Stupid reasoning.
---
can´t remember ever mentioning local and/or cyno changes. stop projecting. it´s not healthy. 
---
&gt; I mean, you are part of an instant gratification group that really dont give much back
---
Playing for 15 years, was a director in several sov and NPC null corps. have FC´d for lowsec and nullsec corps. have helped to build up new player corps, even in the CFC. have flown with and against large blocs. ran logistics and SRP programs in nullsec. half of my remaining chars are currently in Init. i gave some away for free (all to nullsec players btw)  
---
try harder scrub. don´t get burned out while watching netflix tho.
---
your logic has no place here this is eve
---
&gt; It was always about inaccessibility and low occurrence rate of frags due to the sheer effort, creativity or luck it takes.
---
have you considered putting in as much effort as the defenders do?
---
cos a few 20m bombers sure as shit ain't equal effort, dude.
---
I don't see why people find it so difficult to grasp that concept 🤷‍♂️
---
The irony of #3 when every change they implemented in the last year has been because of this subreddit.
---
weird flex but ok  
---
particularly long one too no doubt
---
Yeah, as a newer player myself its unreal how much it has an effect on my prospects for the future of the game, this sub needs to lighten up and realize even though they are veterans and have grown bitter about the game over time, people are just discovering it and are willing to stay because of how great this game is, that is, if the community doesn't drive new players out after one glance at the subreddit.
---
&gt;How does PvP actually work?
---
you grab your buddies, they grab theirs.
---
guy with the most buddies is probably gonna win so the other guy doesn't bother and goes home.
---
I'm like a bald spot man - you can only ignore for so long before you have to accept me.
---
If their latest trailer doesn't scare you away then try it out:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPFII3ozSHI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPFII3ozSHI)
---
"Video games are in a horrible state generally for me with all the fortnite clones..."
---
Fortnite itself is a terrible, terrible clone playable only by 5-year-olds and Twitch titty streamers.
---
So true, if I'm interested in a new game and the sub/forums are full of REEE it's probably worth playing, it's when the last post is 3 months old that I worry.
---
&gt; One thing that was discussed but never implemented was what was coined "brand unification". Basically making it possible to have one account and launcher handle ALL the game titles from CCP. This alone is a great idea and should have been a high priority and delivered to us years ago. 
---
i remember a slide show from fanfest or eve vegas a few years ago and they had this idea, still have zero idea why they haven't done it.
---
We're a select few, my friend. Be proud.
---
You dont like 3rd party tools? Remove them, idc. But it wasnt cheating, it was exploitation.
---
But it was hell of a lot more players. I mean more people means more conflict. But we had bloc issues back then as well right?
---
Perhaps, but its not an economical issue. And if creates more problems than it fixes then it needs to go. Which it has.
---
Listen dude I dont disagree here. My opinion is that most of LS should be cap free and most def super free. But SOV null shouldnt be touched when it comes to capital usage. Dangerous cuts both ways, you wanna roam into someones area be ready to pay the price for it. 
---
All playstyles should be welcome and me personally I like caps. I shouldnt get fked anymore than you should. But thats only in the space that my group owns. If its a neutral area like LS then sure Im with you. Ive had caps/supers dropped on me in LS, its not fun I agree. 
---
But at the same time I dont roam into NS thinking I should be able to kill anything or allowed to leave. I fully expect to get blobbed to shit by supers and titans in NS. Its someone elses home, they fought for that space, they have invested trillions upon trillions and tens of thousands of manhours. I dont belive I should have the right to do anything there but Im happy if I get a decent fight there. 
---
But its not my right.
---
Because it takes a good 3 months or longer to get into a HAC. Yet it can be done in a day. Where's the respect for that? It's not about the ship. It's about the time and effort dedicated to get into that ship. The pride it had before CCP sold out to people like you.
---
Ye the snowflake that is massively self-entitled is throwing bricks in glasshouses. What a shocker.
---
What? Wtf, are there other changes? Dude, stop being obtuse.
---
So what, none of that actually matters if you did all of whilst leaching of the people that are long term planners.
---
Try looking at all the recon ships, rather than just one specific type:
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/4028/
---
There's a gap, but only for that specific entity and there's 4 types of recon trig.
---
This sub would be great if people weren't discouraged from posting (good) AAR, no matter how small they are. It's always fun to see a story from any size of fight.
---
People like me? Kind of an odd assumption.
---
Just fly the ships you want to fly and kill the noobs that injected into ships.
---
Honestly people who reee a lot can be a good sign because while many people are probably shitposting there are probably people with genuine concerns. I'd rather find a game with a community that post more critical threads and opinions than ones that do nothing but praise the game because the former is a sign that the community is active and want to see the game succeed where the latter is just one big circlejerk over how good the games no matter what kind of nose dive the game takes.
---
&gt;which is good for the game and makes botting harder.
---
the pod bots sitting on gates compensating for not having NEAR2 say otherwise, botters will always adapt over time, and they already have in this case.
---
So many levels of disappointment.  Vegas has always been a great city to hang out with my Eve friends.  Good hotels.  Easy to get in and out of.  Enjoyable non-Fanfest/Eve activities in a small easy to get around space.  
---
I don’t see myself flying into SD and I expect that others will feel the same.  I can only guess why CCP feels the need to screw up a get together that pretty much sells out every year and draws people from all over the US and internationally.
---
What balance? The isk sinks and faucets are now massively negative, they went right past balanced and are now unbalanced again.
---
I'm comfortable with that.
---
\^\^ you see that guy up there you said goodbye to? He's your only hope at replacing all the vets that "choas" is chasing out of the game... if the new guys don't like this game play any better than vets how long before all you "pvp is all this game is for" folks have literally nothing to shoot at because the server is sitting at a player count of 5K day in and day out?
---
Most of the things you'll see people talking about are done with an alt in tow so many guides are already setup with 2 "people" in mind. You could do any of the things you mentioned, cruiser abyssals are the only content that is single pilot locked. 
---
I'd try the frigate abyssals as suggested, you could run C2 wormhole combat sites with 2 RR vexors and C3s with 2 RR domis.
---
Exploration can work well with 2, cuts down on scanning time and if you both run asteros you can back each other up if a frigate jumps one of you.
---
This is not smart, the statement was "the downward trend is clear, nothing else is", you went to the "idiot" and "head up your ass" routine and thus imperilled the whole conversation... you are THAT guy my friend!
---
&gt;where it is actually intended by the people who are literally in charge.
---
Hilmar just recently found out that warp core stabs are a thing and they aren't any fun to encounter in the wild, that's how out of touch the guy in charge really is.... and he currently only gives a fuck because the deadline for his sale bonus check is getting closer and its pretty clear he's worried he's not going to get the full amount based on his ever increasing erratic changes, that after 16 years he suddenly decided to start making 10 months before his once in a lifetime pay day.
---
I’d be down with that, or Nashville / Birmingham too. I guess their thought process is just that, if they can only do 1 - moving it isn’t the worst idea.
---
A new sort of bots appeared: The Bumping Bot  
---
They bumped Trig scouts back into their space
---
Maybe my post alerted the dev responsible for them to the fact that had stopped spawning ;-)
---
I hear the argument about how money can't buy skill all the time.. so tell me how skilled you have to be to buy an F1 dread alt that some alliances require?
---
Also, to my point... it's doesn't matter if you're skilled or not. It's about time and effort. Not skill. Stop making it about something I'm not even referencing.
---
Lee run to the center!
---
I swear eve must be so boring once you hit the critical mass that goons have
---
Makes me sad honestly, these songs inspired such joy in me when I began playing. I don't know how to have fun in eve anymore.
---
Your shak has only 600dps?
---
Lol. Well slow down now.
---
It's a fact: I practically never use T2 MWDs myself. But.
---
12m/s on a novice frigate? I guess I can believe that but am not gonna pyfawarrior it right now.
---
But what about an interceptor and a pilot with perfect navigation skills and skirmish boosts? Like I said, not gonna going to pyfawarrior that right now, but I bet it works out to something more significant.
---
Anyway the point was, not that they're *great*, but that they're not actively *bad* in the sense that they're not "meta 4 or worse, only more expensive and harder to fit."
---
ok, so having MWD on all the time was bad but the rest was just as u said...get distance (random direction) and hit approach. I was not always double clicking in space
---
&gt;I think this is the one that should be the most blatantly obvious
---
There has never been a single day in the history of goon delve where some dumb fuck didn't die being stupid in his precious shiny. There has never been a risk free day in Delve, its a myth created by players who think they should be able to go after whales with zero counter play and no chance to see them coming complete with the ability to moon walk out when they are done killing their whale target.
---
Yeah I fell for one of those once! - used to buy the packs off contracts and took a while to copy into your people &amp; places. Could always sell the bookmarks yourself again if you could be hassled waiting for hundreds to copy out again.
---
I view r/Eve as a way to find out more about the game and what people think and the dank memes but it personally doesn't effect how I view the game.
---
I had only my MWD on all the time that was bad. "flying far enough away and hit approach" is there
---
It's more like a RTS game than anything else, to shoot you just lock a target and turn the guns on and they fire automatically after that. There is a first person view where you can steer the ship but this is just for shits and giggles and nobody actually plays in that view. You usually steer by telling the ship which direction to fly in. Though many fights are decided by who has the bigger blob or the counter to your fit (especially bigger battles) in close or smaller fights proper positioning and activating/over heating your modules at the right time can swing an unfavourable fight. When you play pve content it seems like there's very little to do most of the time, but in pvp everything seems to happen alot faster and every decision you make matters more, there's a little bit of twitch skill involved, especially in fast frigate fights but being good/bad at a game like Elite will have little bearing on how good/bad you are at eve.
---
&gt; What? Wtf, are there other changes? 
---
i hope so. because the current changes don´t adress the actual issues. there need to be far more radical approaches. 
---
&gt; So what, none of that actually matters if you did all of whilst leaching of the people that are long term planners
---
long term planners like you? weaseling yourself from one failing group of shitlords to the next after getting shat on by code and quitting the game for 3 years? hey, at least you finally found a group that´s too big to fail and lets you dunk on people. kind of explains your overenthusiasm and blind devotion tbh. for the first time you actually belong and now here comes the CCP boogeyman and those mean smol scale terrorists who want to take your new found freedom &gt;:( 
---
 cherrish these feelings while they last (you should stop posting tho).
---
Currently, there is more risk than reward while ratting. If that were not true, you would find people ratting all over the place. Instead, the only places people continue to rat are in locations that are well fortified and they are still losing a lot of ships. It is not balanced at all. The rewards for ratting need to be increased to the point that more people are willing to risk their ship in order to take a chance on losing it while ratting. That is how to balance something... You cannot balance anything if you keep nerfing things until its not possible to come out ahead while ratting.
---
I just realized the scariest thing about this point is that if they mid and you're at 20 then they'll still be pointed when they land hahaha
---
&gt;The end goal is to balance the risk vs reward.
---
well then they have completely failed as we all just watched the economy go massively into the negative in July and we know based on numbers and player count August will be even worse, so now they have a ton of risk and next to no reward, these changes didn't solve a fucking thing, all they did was invert the problem.
---
My point went way over your head. It's about time and effort.  I've played long enough to not have to worry about isk. But I earned that right. There's a sense of pride.
---
&gt;Wormholer, so no ships
---
so what you're saying is the next stop on the "here have some more risk" train should be WH's?
---

---
What’s worse is that the opinions posted on this sub seem to be accepted by Ccp as quality community feedback. Ccp also supports this sub by contributing their own content and responding to comments as well.
---
This subreddit will scream if there was a massive problem. Have you tried a friends PC? If it works elsewhere likely the issue is something local.
---
Most of the videos you see of dots shooting dots and the people recording doing nothing are major fleet fights and are fought with everyone's cameras really far zoomed out. The way those fights go is that each fleet has 1 person (the 'Anchor', usually the 'FC' \[Fleet Commander\]), and everyone in that fleet is following the FC (literally, their ships are set to approach the FC, and the FC is the one telling his own ship to change headings) while the FC calls targets ('primary') and the rest of the fleet all fires on that target together. It's very simple, efficient, and not very effort intensive for the general fleet line member.
---
What is slightly more interesting in these fights is that all of these fleets have a second wing, the Logi wing, which is a handful of people flying in remote-repair ships. And these guys are frantically trying to keep track of who in the fleet is getting shot at, and repair them before they die. Watching a fight from a logi perspective, you can see they're doing a bit more work. ([Example Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llYHZ22W_qQ) of a fight, recorded from a logi perspective. Video is an hour long, actual fight starts at about 5:25, but this video also has full voice comms and isn't sped up at all.)
---
This is the general way that most large fights play out. What's generally a lot more interesting though is the small gang fights, where there's maybe 10 dudes flying frigates/destroyers/cruisers at most on the attacking side. Those fights are much higher-speed, as each pilot is flying their own ship and trying to dance around the edges of their own and their enemies' effective weapons ranges, and their defense is reliant on 'don't get hit' rather than 'Logi save me'. ([Example Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhqBhv-rmSo) of 5 dudes, one of them in *completely* the wrong size of ship, taking on like 50 dudes. Conveniently, this video also includes text pointers about what the pilot's doing and thinking. IN RUST WE TRUST)
---
Player A is warping to a frigate sized plex, player B kills player A with a cruiser on the gate. Player A returns with a cruiser, player B cloaks up.
---
I'll offer 3 isk
---
Because it doesn have the same use case from what i can see?
---
I miss the propaganda, shitposts... Now it's 90% complaining about the game
---
Why is this a bad thing? Me has been over farmed massively for years with super safe space. 
---
Now there is some risk to balance the massive amounts of isk generated still. 
---
I really don’t see why the concept is so difficult to digest.
---
Participation is important, but so is t2. Try Kirin &gt; scalpel &gt; harpy &gt; crucifier
---
If people who think classic WoW is challenging and EVE is not are our only hope just kill it now. :p
---
This has always and will always be a niche game, not everyone will get it, even less will like it enough to stay and yet somehow, the game rolls on.
---
Not bad for a control tower.
---
True, I will be doing assfrig roams in the future but a number of newbros joined corp so figured it would be good to start with t1 frigs.
---
How does watching a gate work for them when you come in via a wormhole or just never leave system? Sure, eyes will be on gates, but, now if you have 4 gates, it takes 4 eyes, not 1. Those eyes are also not perfect and there are much easier to exploit gray areas.
---
Fun fact; searching Eve on the app stores gives you a bunch of period tracking apps. Can’t wait for my wife to ask what that’s about!
---
I miss them all, but my favourite is the [Trinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVJLAg6lWOY) login screen + theme.
---
Chaos in RL too #NewCEOPls
---
I second this motion. With a little modding and some understanding for its ancient age, that game can be absurdly enjoyable.
---
You make a good point
---
You don't get it. Probably best if you stopped posting in my thread.
---
WHERE IS MY JUKE BOX
---
Ok, then I suggest upshipping to cruisers. Scythe &gt; Rupture &gt; crucifier
---
Depends on the budget ofc. 
---
Just do a kitchen sink frigate roam, or maybe like thrasher/corm roam those are all decent choices. If you aren't afraid to spend (and most likely loose) a bit more, than caracals, ruptures are always fun too.
---
But if you are just learning - just do a T1 frigate roam, its super cheap with T1/meta modules and people in your fleet will learn a lot, grab a bantam or two as well so people who are interested in logistics can try it out too.
---

I don't know the post before the edit but I think the issue isn't that nobody wants ressource depletion but that it's very difficult to come up with a good system. You seem to have given two examples and people already went nuts it seems :D
---
Nice. Guess I coulda included the link, huh?
---
Few things:
---
1) ships get blown up often, so the bounties in most cases will be very low, but that would still be a bit better than it is now;
---
2) ship repackaging - CCP doesn't track repacked ships as a unique ship with their unique ID. Once its repacked it has no distinction from any other ship that just came off the assembly line.
---
It’s the only reasonable option
---
Rust, escape from tarkov
---
To be honest, WoW has (had?) more than accessibility going for it though. There was a nice world to explore and group PvE content was great. It wasn't something as self-sustaining as "create your own world and content" sandbox, but not everyone needs a single game they can play forever, so there's that.

Also, Tic-Tac-Toe is broken as f.

&gt; Games Similar to Eve
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/EiJkUWW.jpg)
---
On one hand a fleet &gt; single player should be fairly obvious...
---
On the other hand, a well piloted Frigate can be just as deadly (or even more so) as a battleship depending on the situation.
---
The deficit is now barely a deficit compared to the insane surplus there was before.
---
You act as if they would be able to predict the different down to the number exactly.
---
Eh, good thing we were trained to wait for 1400 cooldown in TiDi.
---
"You are not prepared!"
---
What a time.
---
I mean, B-R5RB started because someone didnt pay a sov bill, so maybe it would spark more fights due to people screwing up, but i still feel the long term effect would not be good, since as directors and such burn out, you need more people to step up and take their spots and thats something alot of groups are struggling with as it is.
---
"  or just never leave system? " Have fun camping the same system indefinitely I guess?  
---
" when you come in via a wormhole " WH spawns are essentially a D20 roll if you get lucky you find a target, if you don't you either have to take a gate and be spotted or go roll the D20 again.
---
Yeah i get it, but you're only talking about time and efforts in regards to isk so you've kinda failed at making your point clear. I'm playing since 2008 and haven't worried about isk for a good while, though i've bought it several times. My idea is that eve  is fun when you have some goals that are meaningful to you, like building your corp or being badass pvp-ninja or whatever suits you best. Try "the best ship" in the game =)
---
" and yet somehow, the game rolls on. "   
---
And yet for the first time ever we are seeing log on numbers reach and dip below release numbers... you know what you don't see with a game that still has years on its tires? Log in numbers matching the launch year after more than a decade of being far higher.
---
😂
---
enjoy it hahaha  yah same to me  it is funny by the way  but is true
---
Don't worry
---
there's an app for that
---
Oh god exactly this. Every time I visit this sub I leave thinking „as a newbie, should I just stop playing? Game is dead soon anyway“ lol
---
It has more, but that was the lower bound being discussed.
---
I would remove the shitty laser bonus and give it a more appropriate role bonus, like remove the scan resolution malus for wearing a cloak. Or give it some embedded cloak that doesn't take a high slot and acts like a better improved cloaking device and doesn't reduce scan resolution. (kind of like a T3d mode)
---
Also reduce cloak reactivation delay to 5sec.
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been saying too. K162 sigs spawning immediately on jump is retarded.
---
This is perfect
---
Only one that is anything close to eve is Perpetuum.
---
The difference in flight times is about 2h on a flight that's already 14+ hours.  I'm not sure how that makes it more attractive to Aussies?

Another instanced PvP? Just no.

You blame your reason for quitting eve on reading this sub? Fuck me... You must be one delicate flower and a genius one at that. You realise you can unsub from this subreddit right?   
---
Also, real quick, do me a favour... Just have a look in the top right or left corner of your monitor. Depends what OS you're using. 
---
Can you see an X?  Go ahead and click that. Should solve your problem as well as put us out of your misery.
---
I agree with both of you but the simple fix would be to just disable this system if tidi comes into effect
---
Imagine playing a game so bad that reading people's opinions of it somehow makes it not enjoyable, and then imagine further being so fucking retarded that you think the problem lies with people's opinions, not the game itself.
---
Space engineers. Build ships and bases as large as you want. Includes walking in stations.
---
Sadly Perpetuum is mostly dead.
---
Nevar!
---
&gt;This sub really sucks the enjoyment out of the game. 
---
Imagine thinking that opinions of some randos on the Internet can "suck the enjoyment" out of a game.
---
Perhaps the game is simply not as enjoyable as you tried to convice yourself?
---

[RIP Sins of the Empires](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7h0u96/ccp_has_issued_a_cease_and_desist_to_a_fantastic/). Given the timing in retrospect, I can't help but wonder if it was sacrificed because CCP was looking for a buyer and couldn't allow someone diminishing the value of their IP.

Reps on grid
---
Funnily enough I was on -5 or so before I went to bed.
---
So my edit actually was counter productive in increasing downvotes.
---
Damn it.
---
X3 isn't *that* old...
---
&gt; Apparently, WoW Classic alone on launch day had more concurrent players than ever in WoW's entire history. 
---
any official / semi-official source on this?
---
Leaving MWD on is fine. You just have to control-space and let your speed drop to below half your base speed before reapproaching.
---
&gt;i would love to try it, but I wouldn't even know where to begin
---
download the client and run the game
---
People resist change, even those who say don’t :-)

I'm watching worstplayerever streams

---
No, but only because there's no point to a restart unless shit gets fixed.
---
Otherwise sure would... then again if shit got fixed I'd actually play the current game too
---
I like how only two of these are still alive, and what the fuck even is POTBS?
---
Did they say why the won't do anything.
---
That's rather important. I'd like to know if there's no good reason for it before I break out the outrage and uproar.
---
The bunch of dots shooting dots is because people use the tactical overlay and then zoom out. A lot of Eve pvp rely on range control and speed.
---
Which range to take, which speed, which modules to activate and when : you take a lot of decisions. One wrong decision and you gave your opponent a decisive advantage.
---
For more advanced tactics, a lot of pilot also practice manual piloting. Instead of giving your ship a command "orbit at 30km" you choose yourself the angle and direction. "Spiralling" for instance allows you to approach an ( generally bigger ) artillery ship by changing tack and therefore beating its guns ability to track you. "Slingshot" a manual piloting procedure in which you use the residual inertia of a faster enemy to burn back and catch him.
---
There a many examples. Most need a lot of practise.
---
That's the battle itself but actually the battle starts the moment you undock : how you fitted and theory crafted your ship. Which strengths does you ship has and which weaknesses you traded them for. Which target you choose.
---
Finally solo pvp is totally different from small gang pvp itself utterly different from fleet pvp. In the latter, logistics matter a lot : can you fleet remove this particular ship before the enemy logistics wing counter your effort ? Will you focus your fire on the E-War ( "debuff") wing of your enemy or its logistics ( "healer") wing ?
---
Choices
---
Another suggestion comparing loss mechanics is Escape from Tarkov. Similar to OSRS you can protect a small amount of what you have but most of your stuff is gone if you die, what you take and what you loot is your risk. They also have insurance for gear though so if nobody takes your stuff you get it back.
---
Also bring Dwarf Priests and Hunters into EVE too.
---
[https://youtu.be/0bjTrPutt4k?t=39](https://youtu.be/0bjTrPutt4k?t=39)  
---
This is what's happening if you zoom in on those dots.
---
When there was a themed login screen with splash background and music instead of an undersized launcher full of ads.
---
Caracals with osprey support, you can never go wrong with caracools.
---
He wrote that he can’t do it and that that’s the rule for all players, which both doesn’t answer the question in any way...
---
Really disappointing.
---
Zeroooooo
---
 Stoped playing not due blackout but due to cyno changes. 
---
Playing some old games until CCP will stop smoking that hard...
---
Old games as Pharaoh, ceasar 3, zeus, mm6 and mm7 and mm8.
---
Replace Gaming skill with "Learning UI" and I'd say relevant.
---
I'd say if you are talking fleet battles then eve is the easiest of all for pvp.
---
Keep at range, shoot broadcasts, jump. If you can do those you basically set for most of your battles since the FC is telling you what to do.
---
&gt;My opinion is that most of LS should be cap free and most def super free. But SOV null shouldnt be touched when it comes to capital usage. Dangerous cuts both ways, you wanna roam into someones area be ready to pay the price for it.
---
Yes if you roam to someones space with caps/supers then you should get dropped with caps. But if you roam with subcapitals then you should meet mostly other subcapitals. That keeps the game fun for everyone. Defenders have the upper hand in both cases anyway. They can switch ships / reship / dock freely.
---
&gt;But at the same time I dont roam into NS thinking I should be able to kill anything or allowed to leave. I fully expect to get blobbed to shit by supers and titans in NS.
---
Then why go roam in enemy NS? This is a game and it's supposed to be fun :D
---
Got it. Just trying to understand people. All in all it was fun AF.
---
Will bet OP didnt log in to an account within the 24hr period.
---
It only seems like dots on a screen because most people zoom way out to get a better view of the field. But you can zoom in to your ship and fly by double clicking in space. There is no aiming. You lock targets and fire. Hitting and missing is based on several factors you can control. Like optimal range. Fall off. Transversal. Ammo types. Tracking.  Sig radius. And the enemy can also distrupt those ways to make you miss. 
---
Try it for free. You got nothing to lose.
---
The problem is not the effort of the AAR, but no matter how well written, there will be a cesspool of comments following how you are:
---
a) a filthy blobber
---
b) already replaced
---
c) terrible music even though taste is quite personal
---
d) random smack talking
---
The only thing appreciated around here seems to be solo pvp-ers in lowsec plexes. And sometimes completely false AARs get posted because somebody can't remotely objectively evaluate their own shit. 
---
I also understand that for every whiner that posts you have 10 people who just watch and maybe enjoyed but just didn't bother to post.
---
&gt;Having perfect information on when people leave and exit a system and who they are through local chat seems ridiculous to begin with. for a region that's supposed to be the most dangerous, local being like that just shouldn't exist. Stop being such carebears jfc.
---
Null was dangerous enough before
---
&gt;Cyno changes also look good. Multiboxing absolutely shouldn't be the norm or as commonplace as it is in eve. Hurting the throwaway cyno alt strat goes against this multiboxing norm, and for that reason it's a good thing.
---
The cyno changes do nothing to dicentivise Multiple Accounts. It propably makes it even more nessesary since the chance for someone to have a Recon at your target destination is way lower than with rookie cynos. So you have to get the cyno there yourself.
---
If you bet your money, you’ll lose it.
---
"Better" means something different for different people. You may say you want it to be fair. But life itself is unfair. The fact that you are obliterated for no reason is part of life. Sometimes you just meet death. Maybe lots of times. The challenge is to improve despite the fact that bad things happen.
---
Hahaha, c'mon. At least try a bit when shitposting
---
Also keep spamming approach untill you hit it. For some reason you hit the "centre" of the model better 9 out of 10 times this way.
---
Lol whaaaaaaaaaaat? hahahaha omg youre funny.
---
Now Im starting to get why you argue the way you do. Youre trying to make me laugh. Thanks bro, it worked!:)
---
im completely serious..
---
If all my Eve isk/processions were converted to free game time in the new wiped universe .. then maybe, if not then .. No!
---
I really wish the mods would step up. I feel like their inaction on curbing the more toxic posts have helped foster this kind of environment in the sub.
---
it makes the cyno alt more expensive or difficult to make, this discouraging it.
---
Ow wow old school Muse, that has been a while.
---
They are good and null was really to safe. People are just lazy and don't want to change their ways. 
---
Ratting 23/7 with almost perfect intel about roaming gangs was "dangerous" enough....
---
Now let the Downvote begin \o/
---
I think it is the non stop barrage of negativity. You know that old saying, if you tell a lie long enough it becomes the truth. I feel like it is the same thing here except with negativity.
---
the necessity is still there. If you are so invested into the Game to own a Capital, you get yourself a recon alt, either by ingame means or through Injectors.
---
It really depends on the experience level of your fleet members. If your fleet members are comfortable piloting their own ships, then a kitchen sink kitey bullshit roaming gang is pretty straightforward to FC. Your job is to direct the roam, keep track of where your scouts and tackle are relative to everyone else so the fleet doesn't get strung out, call primaries, and make the call on when to bail if you get blobbed. No anchoring. No ammo types. No calling the engage even, really, since your scouts should be doing that for you.
---
oh hey good for you, you found your scapegoat
---
So since you're new, ho educate yourself and read the entire cyno threadnought on the forums...
---
This will give you some insight into why its not all as rosy as you seem to think.
---
Also, ccp's implementation of blackout hasn't been all too good. However they try to bullshit you about player numbers etc, they are taking out of their arse.
---
No local in nullsec is good, but they went about implementing it wrong.
---
The fact that grind is part of the game is not a problem. 
---
I like Eve because it is a social game. For being the type of game that it is, it filters out some player types that I would just not want to meet in a game. For this reason, Eve community will always be formed of people with some things in common. Things that are hard to find in other games. Like maturity...
---
The level of trolling in eve can be epic.
---
I like the fact that it is a social game. Most things that are meaningful involve a lot of people.
---
There are lots of things I do not understand in Eve. I've never been involved in PvP or a war. When I will be, I will probably notice some frustrating aspects of the game. But until then, the game seems interesting.
---
Tarkov is the eve of shooters
---
get them an fatigue, like jump fatique, so you need x days to inject a char to y SP. ever injektor add up and at some point you have to wayt weeks to add a new one.

In no world was null dangerous enough before. I used to run sites in my thanatos on my other screen while watching my lectures. Load up near 3 or whatever tf it was called and the program would yell at me if any badguys came anywhere near me so I could dock up. Went an entire year without ever getting dropped on and I flew with SLYCE and they’re not even good. Can’t imagine how easy it must’ve been flying in goon space.
---
you go back and forth switching between keep at range and approach
---
Thats not your choice. You have the choice of what you want to bring and you most def have the advantage. You choose when to engage and when to withdraw. If people drop caps on you in sov null Im not gonna feel bad about it, sorry man. They can choose how to defend their area.
---
Why I seldom roam in NS. If I want small scale content I can always hit up LS. Im not in sov null because I want to engage with smaller groups, Im there to fight with the biggest things against people that have the biggest things. And thats okey, people have different tastes and it should be okey to do both.
---
I do strongly believe small gang should have content dont get me wrong. But I also dont belive in restricting sov null to get it. Thats a lawless area and its the domain of the people that own it. If they wanna drop supers and titans its their right. But I dont belive it should be okey in LS, that area should be neutral and a haven for people who dont wanna engage in super/titan warfare.
---
And thats okey. There should be more choices and not less in a sandbox. Everyone should have a place and be able to choose freely. We shouldnt nerf playstyles to buff other playstyles. We should make sure every playstyle has a place though. All of this is because LS has died out (almost) and imo that has to do with the lack of isk there. Smaller groups should most def be able to build up there and fight amongst themselves for content.
---
Idk man, CCP will do what CCP will do. We just have to wait it out. I dont belive in these changes and I dont believe in CCP all of the sudden started giving a shit about the game theyve neglected for so long. But Im subbed for quite a long time ahead so Im still in the game. 
---
If it turns out I was wrong then I will be uberhappy about it, I just hope I am. If Im not, if this goes on and its only downhill then I dont think the game will recover. We will lose another big chunk of players we will never get back and we will all be sitting there going "fk, maybe it went too far".
---
If you enjoy any game, never go to it's Reddit sub or the forums
---
Oh yeah I know. The blue donut can adapt to anything and everything and the only saving grace for EVE would be to listen to them and do as they wish. Well, except that it didn't work for the last 5 years.
---
You can't argue with Olmeca about this. He doesn't understand that the defenders has to do something too. All he sees is ships jumping in to help and that obviously unfair.
---
People bitching about this sub can't possibly have seen the official forums or the facebook groups, can they?
---
Because you're retarded.
---
Elite has about nothing close to Eve except theme
---
Eve is only 2 years older than X3.
---
Dwindling resources is only a problem if you have a mercantilism kind of economy. However in a world where most things are bought and sold freely on the market it is much less of an issue. I think overall it would lead to trade agreements between groups (not that is a bad thing). 
---
However I think the real utility that would interest you is that you could offensively mine and rat in order to cut off a groups income. Now that would be a good use of dwindling resources. So yeah I think it would be an interesting addition to the game. Though I don't think it is going to give the exact result that you want.
---
about player numbers.. the weekly max didn't look significantly worse compared to the past 5 or so years. definitely not proportionate to the amount of complaining I see..
---
It is because a bunch of people who used to live in highsec moved to nullsec blocs over the past few years. They now think that they are nullsec players but in reality have the same risk averse mindset they always did. It has just been safe in nullsec lately and they are deeply uncomfortable with change.
---
You have to understand that EVE is a very old game. Players have amassed large sums of ISK's over the last decade, so obviously these old school players are going to have more knowledge at hand and more money. Therefore easier access to skill injectors, ships, structures...etc  
---
EVE isn't so much about ISK anymore. While you may see a Titan, Supercarrier or Dreadnought as the pinnacle of end game achieve. It really isn't anymore (Capital proliferation is up for another debate). The gap between a new player and a veteran isn't so much about skill points anymore. Skillpoints are literally given to you on a platter nowadays.
---
Why did you just paste the EVE logo? ...Oh wait
---
The original EvE soundtrack (Below the asteroids and the like) are my most played soundtracks, I revisit them so often because of how amazing they are.  
---
Eve was much more when it really had that theme going for it, it's certainly lost a bit of it's 'Vibe' back, I would have loved to see the paycheck boost go to a fresh, nostalgic soundtrack that had people glued to listen too again, even if it wouldn't be for long!
---
&gt; Null was dangerous enough before
---
No it wasn't.
---
This is by far the lowest the numbers have been since 2005 lmao
---
Good sock puppet tho
---
Ye and that has nothing to do with the login events keeping the numbers up? 
---
I dont know if youre shitposting cause honestly this thread is bad. But there are a shitload of arguments against these changes. And very few for it that pretty much always ends up in 1, NS should be more dangerous which means "give us more kills for less effort". Every other argument has pretty much already been debunked.
---
Which means its got more disadvantages than advantages. Common logic dictates the changes are bad no matter ones personal opinions on the matter.
---
&gt;Why I seldom roam in NS. If I want small scale content I can always hit up LS. Im not in sov null because I want to engage with smaller groups, Im there to fight with the biggest things against people that have the biggest things.
---
These are some of the core reasons that have caused stagnation in the game and destroyed roaming pvp gamestyle almost completely. Earlier caps were almost useless against subcapitals but strong against other capitals. So you still had reason to use subcaps and you could go roaming in them.
---
&gt;But I also dont belive in restricting sov null to get it. Thats a lawless area and its the domain of the people that own it. If they wanna drop supers and titans its their right.
---
It's not restricting. It's called game balance. They can still drop supers/caps but they should work like the old capitals and be somewhat useless against subcaps. Rock paper scissors wouldn't work if scissors would win every time. Nobody would choose paper or rock.
---
Ccp customer service has always been excellent and handled my login issues in the 4hrs following my messages. Id be surprised they would do this without reason.
---
I feel personally attacked!
---
Had the same problem recently. I found an older article about issues with the launcher and multiple displays. It stated the launcher has issues when it doesn't recognize the current window position as matching the previous  window position. 
---
My issue was that when my PC goes to sleep it reorders the windows on the monitors. It's a common issue with Windows due to how Windows reorganizes program windows when it detects the loss of a display.  I've never had an issue with the launcher before. Nothing I tried (uninstalling,reinstalling, etc.) worked. I finally let the monitors sleep and when it came back up the windows had reorganized and the launcher was displayed again. I was able to duplicate this. 
---
What may have happened in your case is when you swapped to full screen, Windows reorganized the windows on your screen and the launcher now has a similar issue. I would try forcing Windows to reorganize your windows again and see if the launcher comes back up. 
---
I'm still looking in to figuring out how to stop from my windows reorganizing themselves on sleep, but it's pretty low priority because they often revert to the appropriate screen when manipulated with the window control buttons.
---
You wanna play like bots, then adapt as bots.
---
if you're going to be like that, then the argument against the blackout basically boils down to "give us more afk mining/krabbing income for less effort"
---
if the pcu was 50k every day for 20 years then one day it was 49,999, it would be the lowest amount of players in 20 years too. what matters is how many have dropped.
---
Cap-booster-Ninazu pilot?
---
Hahaha lol
---
For less effort? You mean the same amount of effort ye? Cause it wasnt buffed, nobody was asking for a buff. Nobody really cared about it getting nerfed either. 
---
Its besides the point. Its got more disadvantages than advantages. End of story.
---
People are here whining so their contribution was meaningful.
---
*Go on\~*
---
Get your nano ship blobbed by merlins and atrons recently?
---
I was thinking the same thing reading your comments. You're arguing semantics because you know you're wrong.
---
How did you estimate the player count and how do you know how many bits are excluded form the statistics after July?
---
As much as CCP are on my shitlist lately; I will say the GMs were always helpful and provided a positive solution to any issues within 3 days for the few times I did tickets.
---
Why “I love the changes” never comes without  “small gang”?
---
if he doesn't do it, someone else has to. Just because we're cheap fucks and don't pay enough doesn't make his job less worth.

**The important thing is to just grab ships and GO. Something cheep, something fast, something disposable and repeatable. The faster you're out there doing things, and the more fun you're having, the more you're going to learn** *and your fleet members are going to just keep staring stary eyed up at you from your lap, just get out there and DO things!*   
---
If you need some ~~bad~~ ideas from a numpty like me
---
Kitchen sink and you can never go wrong, especially with 10 people  
---
Make sure you've got a tackle ship, a T1 battlecruiser can provide you with links, just have fun!
---
T1 ships are very fun because they're inexpensive to replace. You could take T1 Blaster-merlins out to lowsec with replacements and just bum-rush cruisers you see in plexes for a laugh
---
If you're looking for something much more 'fleety' Rail Brutix are easy and don't require logi If you hull fit them, DPS race the gang you're fighting. Ferox and Ospreys are similar, and in a good place right now!
---
**TL;DR: Grab some T1 blaster frigates and go nuts, replace, repeat, enjoy and learn.**
---
Wow. So my Boss deserves the credit for the work I do? You have to be (to use the word you used earlier) retarded dude.
---
and how long is the player base for the fighters going to stick around if you keep turning their game play off every time something interesting happens?
---
I agree, but it is what it is. The main thing that went wrong was Rorqs that spewed out tons of minerals in combination with skill injectors that just made shit go crazy. But its already happened, you cant reverse it. Instead you have to build on it. And thats the second thing that went wrong, it never got built on and we end up here.
---
You cant erase these last years, no matter what you do. You have to find a new path for the game, not just resort to old tricks which wont work.
---
It is restricting man. We are going back to an age where people have alts in HS to make isk. Its not going forward I can tell you that.
---
I honestly dont agree on the caps part. I take part in enough drops to know that they suck monkeyballs against subs. If they have enough logi and more EHP than an alpha its pretty hard to actually kill them. Bombers die easy though. But they are rather safe to use in a drop  even though Ive seen plenty get killed. And they require less effort cause you dont need a subcap fleet for defense purposes.
---
I.e., caps get dropped because its easier, not because they are OP. If they were it would never be possible to solo them with subs.
---
more disadvantages than advantages? says who? it's essentially pvpers vs carebears, with botting getting harder so already the scales are tilted in favor of the pvpers in terms of advantages vs disadvantages.
---
afk pve activities aren't what make eve great... it's the player interaction, which pvp is.
---
&gt;Load up near 3 or whatever tf it was called and the program would yell at me if any badguys came anywhere near me so I could dock up
---
You mean a tool created by players, and only worked because of player input... because of how dangerous null is?
---
&gt; (less anoms if you overfarm a system as an example)
---
I think this should be a thing, but i wouldn't have just nerfed their spawn, instead make a better system to compensate for it. How about having pirates play a larger part of nullsec, where their spawns are more dynamic. If a system were to be overfarmed, the pirates would be pushed back so far it would take them a while to recover. But on the other end if they were not supressed, their power and riches would go up. An analogy of this could be a garden, if you tend to it (suppress rats) they would be manageable, but if you let things grow they become harder to push back. 
---
An system like this would also make less used systems more rich in pirates, which could make more of nullsec be more evenly populated. Compared to as it is today with maybe a few systems for ratting, and only a few others for mining. 
---
Maybe even the anomalies themselves could affect how the pirates behave. Say if there were an anomaly that did industry for them, they would have more ships. Or they had pirate gates, which would make the pirate influence grow more quickly in neighboring systems. If an alliance wanted to make the pirate threat lower, they could take out key pirate structures affecting their powers.
---
Perhaps there could also be a system for suppression assignments, where they would get a target that would have an affect on the pirate population in that system. Kinda similar to missions, just that they have an actual effect on the system rather than just some standing gain. An assignment like this could also give some extra reward. Maybe the alliance could manage these assignments to give players guidance of what tactical targets to destroy? &gt; (less anoms if you overfarm a system as an example)

(Not saying this is a definite how things should be, just throwing out an idea for discussion)
---
So concurrent players logged in going down from 30k+ to 21k is not significant?
---
Freespace 1 and 2 (dogfight) has some big fights during campaign. Also comes with an editor and u can make your own missions/campaign.
---
You definitely want to give Star Citizen a try. It’s been in development for over 7 years and it will released soon, no later than 2043.
---
&gt; why is so much of the game 'lock target and f1'?
---
that's pretty much all of the game
---
X3 series became quite bad after Albion.
---
:Cry:
---
&gt; use 3rd party sites for more isk or injectors 
---
thats harram
---
talk dirty to eachother
---
Maybe you're a shitty krabber, now krabbing requires more skills
---
You all moaned for years that they should leave high sec.
---
They did.
---
Now you're moaning they left.
---
In my experience if it's an in game issue they will come to you soon and most of the time resolve the issue quick. However if your issue is related to the launcher not working they pretty much never respond and close your ticket without reaponding. Try to find your solutions online and hope one of them will work.
---
Actually, capitals were exactly like that for the majority of the game's life. They didn't apply very well to subcaps (apart from drone swarms and grid-wide doomdsays, which were recognized as problematic and changed/nerfed) and that's why people used battleships as the mainline ship of every fleet. It worked fine and it was more fun.
---
The main reason capitals got buffed in the first place was the phasing out of POS and the introduction of citadels, because without POS to grind (and enemy capitals in those fights), they were becoming useless.
---
So i more or less stand by my original comment. The role of capitals should be to kill other capitals and structures, they shouldn't be able to stay on grid without subcap escort. Shooting a battleship with a dread or with fighters? Sure, makes sense. But seeing videos of HAW dreads deleting swarms of frigates and cruisers is just ridiculous.
---
Some of buffs to capitals in recent years completely broke the foundation mechanics on which PVP in this game is entirely based on:
---
Small stuff: You can hit anything, but you won't do too much damage. You die easily IF you get hit, but you have the speed to get out if you play well.
---
Big stuff: More DPS on paper, but much worse application against anything smaller than you. More tank but also slower, if you get caught by a lot of smaller stuff you're dead because you can't escape.
---
That's the way it has been, it worked very well and it should be this way again.
---
Solo videos and AT was super fun
---
Yeah the thing that people could update by looking in local chat without undocking and posting in a channel that program reads. The problem wasn’t exactly near3 but how easily used the program was. Now you at least need scouts on gates to see the badguys to post in the intel chat. It by far isn’t perfect but its a step in the right direction
---
Do you prefer to fly a Marshal or a Velator? ... Velator please..
---
56k sp starter chars REEE
---
Have you tried pvp yet? Solo pvp can be quite a threshold to pass over and having a friend helps alot at the start. You can either go with the ”easy” approach of hunting ratters/explorers, or fit up a couple of frigates and head out looking for people who will shot back in FW zones. I’ve been getting back to eve myself with a friend, roaming in destroyers. Frigate abyssals are nice isk, as someone else suggested.

Awesome mate thankyou for this.

if you actually look at the graph, it doesn't look that bad. past year has a 31k average and 2009-2018 has a 37k average. it's really not as massive as you whiners are making it out to be.

I'm gunna have to go with this cat. Seems like one convincing mother fucker.
---
Not only are they mad, most of them are also the Twitch Chat Grandmaster types, who "know" everything about everything, and their opinion is "totally 100% accurate and objective". These people suck in any subreddit, compound that with such an open-ended game like EVE, where even if you know a TON about your favourite tiny facet of the game, you probably know sweet fuck all about 80-90% of the rest of it. This creates an even worse situation, as people who are respected for their knowledge and skill in one area of the game speak on one of the many topics they know literally nothing about, and people just reiterate their rather inaccurate or *highly* subjective statements as if they are gospel

Hi I'm new to eve and I know all the terminology and jargon and parrot old ass memes like perfect intel and shit.
---
Propaganda post are the best... But first we need a big war... :(
---
Every time you hit KAR you will fly off in a semi random direction, try it. 
---
Using a BM make sure you keep hitting them in the right direction.
---
perfect information isn't a meme or specific to eve, it's a general video game term.
---
I've picked up most of the jargon reading this subreddit.
---
Given how many in this thread are against the EVE videos that just feature songs, I feel like they deserve some love too.
---
I really like them as they allow me to learn of new songs, while looking at content I like, and keeps me my need for space destruction satisfied. Hearing the FC is something I don't care about, as the videos I have made myself show I suppose.
---
Offer 1 isk for key pls
---
We haven't had a good Cymek in... 11 months? Draining yo.
---
If you want to stop programs like that all ccp has to do is turn off chat logging.
---
Yeah.
---
And [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09wIFIzC944](Pandemic Phone) is only a lackluster substitute. (and jeez thats old.)
---
i'd use Rapid Heavy Missile launcher instead of cruise :)
---
"New player here" is the new troll bait
---
you should put bumpers on all the edges in your house......
---
Keep up the good work. Pretty soon you'll be a master baiter.
---
To some extent, you can feedback on the ticket. According to their Eve North presentations they'll double check it thoroughly.
---
If you logged in every day, far as I am concerned, you should have the skill points. However I'm going to guess you didn't click the 'claim'. In which case the GM is completely correct to not give you the SP.
---
2043? you're quite the optimist arent you?
---
Yeah they definitely need to do something to stop programs like that. Imo when something takes the human interaction part out of the game it needs to go.
---
That's a seriously crappy display of reading comprehension skills.
---
It wouldn't be that bad if it accepted direct touch controls.
---
Then just have a big screen phone and a stylus and high dpi scaling and you're golden
---
Count me as one...joining corps and trying to explore and have fun and go through nullsec corps sorry about their killboards which makes things not fun then you can’t fly in fleets unless everyone has some build that takes months to train and you also have to have have Alts that can do crazy shit and then when you branch out and play solo it’s boring not to mention you some how always find salty people when trying to do pvp or missions and it completely kills everything
---
Yeah, no „claim“-button to press, so what should I do? Write a ticket?
---
It didn't.
---
All it does is reads chat logs. People still have to put things in chat channels for it to do anything.
---
Do you even know how it works?
---
Nah I could never do that. I vaguely looked at getting into alliance industry, economy or tool making at some point then gave up because all I heard about looked like my day job minus the pay. Or the ability to truly automate shit.
---
As a dev, the fact that botting is bad is a constant source of cognitive dissonance. Everything in EVE makes me want to break out the scripting tools.
---
One clever guy !
---
Personally I use chrome remote desktop on my phone to "play" eve on mobile. its really handy when you stuck on fleet op and need to go take a shit. Brain dead follow broadcast and press F1 in tidi are easy enough to control through phone or some relatively simple activity like move a cap and travel cepter around.
---
In any complex game, and especially one that has ran for so long and with such a dedicated and committed player base, it is a constant race between the developers and the players.
---
What usually happens is that players will min-max the shit out of the game, find loopholes and unintended uses of game mechanics and use them to their advantage. Up to a certain point that is creative, after a while though it may become too much. The game meta may change a lot in favor of a specific playstyle to the exclusion of everything else (and the players doing the "everything else" feel shut out by the game), so then the devs step in to rebalance things and shake up the sandbox a bit. This has happened many times over the game's life.
---
Some people don't like this, because people are lazy optimizers by nature. They figured the game out, they have been reaping the rewards, and now someone takes part of that away from them. Some are also selfish. They value their narrowly defined, short-term personal enjoyment more than the long-term health and continued existence of the game sandbox, so they will cry a lot on the internet about it, threaten to leave the game and exchange insults with strangers and other nerds who might be old/young enough to be their dads/kids.
---
The people you see crying now are the guys who like the long-term planning parts of the game and flying big ships in fleets of hundreds or thousands, where combat is slow. These people are good at strategizing and long-term plays. I can't say much more about them, because that's not my preferred playstyle and i don't know all the bits and bolts that go into it.
---
The people who like the current changes are people who like fast combat in much smaller groups with much smaller ships, going deep inside enemy space, killing a few easy targets to provoke a response of ships that can actually fight back, killing whatever they can from the response fleet and then escaping, and generally causing mayhem. These people are usually not interested in the long-term and politics/drama part of the game and just like fighting for the sake of it, rather than for a strategic purpose. Compared to the previous group, they may not be very good at long-term planning, mostly through lack of attention span. In other words, they are not bad, they just like playing the game differently and optimizing other aspects of it. They are usually way better at actually fitting a ship and flying it competently than the average members of the big fleets are (engaging enemies in bigger ships or against bigger numbers teaches that to you). When i first played the game and was much more active than now, that's more or less what i also did.
---
It's basically a case of organizational power and scaling in a big group vs personal skill of each pilot in a smaller group. If it's balanced, it is very enjoyable for both.
---
I mean, sure, you won't topple an empire of 10000 with your 20 buddies, but it's perversely satisfying engaging outnumbered 3 to 1 across multiple systems in a running battle, utilizing anything at your disposal from on-grid tactics to map geography in order to stay alive and managing to keep chaining kills against seemingly superior opponents (in hull types and numbers) who can't fly their ships as well as you can.
---
If it's not balanced though, it's only enjoyable for the selfish player whose playstyle happens to be on top of the meta at the given time. The main problem is that CCP has been catering to one of the two groups for a while, which caused a landslide. People saw that a certain playstyle was favored, so they rushed to get in while the going was good. They opened more accounts, made more alts and bought injectors to skill into it all, so they are now upset that things are getting taken down a notch or two.
---
I think that a few years ago, it was the other way around. I wasn't around at the time, but i remember various forum posts about nerfs to kiting and nano-fits (speed-based fits for small ships, to enable them to hit and run efficiently).
---
I bet you anything you want that most of the people you now see crying would have been applauding CCP, because CCP made it harder for small ships to run away from their lumbering behemoths. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, it's "i'm cancelling my subscriptions". In a similar fashion, i'm sure there would have been people who complained a lot about the nerfs to smaller ships back then.
---
Personally speaking, most of my original group of players quit en masse even earlier, starting in 2006 (that's when i stopped playing) unitl 2008, when it was becoming obvious that the game was in the "bigger = better" mindset, because we could see the writing on the wall.
---
Some of us (including myself) still play casually from time to time, but it's nothing like our initial experience and investment with the game.
---
The point here is that the game didn't die when we left, and i don't think it will die if the currently dissatisfied players leave either. New and old players who like the playstyle i enjoyed will replace them, just as i was replaced by players who enjoy the playstyle that is currently getting nerfed.
---
It just goes in circles, because it's very hard to balance everything in a way that one group or another won't be able to optimize to the point of being game-breaking in the long run.
---
TL;DR a large portion of the vocal part of the player base are either long-term jaded veterans, people who settled into an optimized game flow and became lazy through the years, upset that they invested late into imbalanced activities right before they got nerfed, or just spoiled/entitled by the fact that their preferred playstyle has been at the top of the meta for a while. That's why they oppose any change that might force them to rethink their approach to the game.
---
Personally, i just stick to ships i like flying. They may get nerfed today and buffed again in six months and i may take a break now and then. I won't buy a bunch of injectors to sit in the "flavor of the month" ship and then cry when it gets balanced back into reason, i just fly what i like to fly and know that every now and then it will be balanced, underpowered or overpowered and just roll with it.
---
Read up on stuff but make your own mind, go out, play and enjoy the game doing what you like to do. The current changes mostly affect nullsec and according to data released a few years ago, that's just 20% of the player base. Even so, not all of null is against the changes, you'll see people in the same alliance having different opinions depending on what they like to fly and do in the game. Plus, some of the changes mostly affect players with dozens of millions skillpoints, so it doesn't even affect you as a new player.
---
Wormhole dreads not having to train jump skills cuts down training time immensely. Off the top of my head you'll want
---
- t2 siege and t2 guns
---
- dread 5
---
- max gunnery supports (you don't need the cap reduction skill for a nag)
---
- relevant shield tank skills
---
- evasive maneuvering 5
---
- target painting
---
- heavy points for the drifter
---
- cybernetics for brainfarming after all these are done
---
This is probably in the range of 15-20 mil sp
---
Dread chars go for a high price on the bazaar, but if you keep your eyes peeled you can pick one up that has most of the skills
---
Not like CCP left perfect intel if someone is loged in the system and what activity they are doing.
---
You are bitching about people leaving? Oh dont cry little hunter.
---
Ahahah ! You clumsy pilot !
---
no I'm bitching about people bitching
---
So glad I wasn't the only one, I was looking forward to that...
---
Albion Online is conceptually similar in many respects (player drive economy; safe, less safe and totally unlawful areas; large scale pvp; player alliances; scammers; a number of toxic players; ability to take control of parts of the map e.t.c).
---
Clearly not in any way about spaceships mind.
---
Anyone want to just extract the apk?
---
I even used a pixel 2 emulator and got Google play installed and it still just says "item not found"

do you really think i would play this shitty dumpster fire if i had an alternative?
---
not really, they always used isboxer as it is infinietaly superior to even todays eve launcher
---
Never forgot those brave souls who failed and won eve
---
im thinking players first 10-12 million SP should be focused. getting t2 small guns, maybe t2 mediums. t2 medium drones. fitting skills all maxed. getting favourite cruiser skill and frigate skill to 5.
---
and im advising that training every cruiser hull and gun to level 3 or 4, not getting any further up the tech tree just getting more choice is not the 'best' way. it makes progression EVEN SLOWER up a tech tree in an already slow game
---
Pepper that enjoy the game are mostly just enjoying the game not paying on Reddit
---
ignorance is a virtue i guess?
---
The game could come with ASMR Aura snapchat subs and I still would not get rid of my S5.
---
1. "A lot" is a big overstatement here. A bit more annoying - yes, more difficult - no.
---
2. As the point 1 does not work , this becomes just a minor nuisance fro WH population
---
If you realy want to mess the things up, then you should add mass regen to more wormholes. Random amounts of mass at random time intervals. That's the way to go.  
---
Moreover, statics should stop leading to specific type of space or wormhole class, those also should be random.
---
If it’s solo or gang:  shit! Double click double click double click double click, point scram, double click, double click, “ hes almost down just a little morrrreee” ... double click, “ no, too close I let him scream me..” , Hull alarm.. death.

Fleet: ping, sit on Titan... 30 minutes later... sit on Titan... “ take the bridge”.. F1 F1 F1 F1 F1....

Why not just do it yourself? Assemble a demolition crew of a few people and bash em. If they are abandoned none will stop you.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
And most these changes don't appear to be having a positive effect on the game. This is a salty, shitty echo chamber with a massive bias towards a single playstyle.
---
Un-ironically the best change CCP have made in the last year is upgrading the app.
---
Cormorants or hurricanes
---
There was a lot of isk to be made in high class wormholes, but let's not pretend it was as easy or brainless as making the same amount of isk in null. Yes, you could roll any extra holes, but more could appear mid site. Yes you could rat in your static but again, more holes can appear and also you have to keep rolling to find systems with sites in since they don't endlessly respawn like in null. Also if you did get gone on by someone who found you ratting, no cynoing in friends to defend you
---
I'm not denying there's a lot of isk but you have to actually pay attention and put effort in.
---
I don't eat in high class holes btw before someone says I'm defusing my own playstyle.
---
Also the idea they threw out about not being able to roll holes will make wormhole space have less content not more, and could in fact make ratting safer in certain situations. Knowing that nobody can rage roll into you will be a boon to the bears
---
I already mentioned that the statics should remain untouched. So people can always rage roll into you.
---
It does accept touch control, I've been working on ways to dial in the mouse control to achieve more 1 to 1 parity with my finger movements.
---
Still a little ways to go... But at least remote krabbing is possible.
---
never gets old
---
Yeah, ideally you'd probably do something like mining on this set up.
---
As you can see, I went for a more click intensive option.
---
Well one of the things the devs mentioned is removing max total mass from Holmes, meaning they can't be rage rolled any more, and I was assuming thats what you were referring to when you said devs are talking about changing wormholes
---
I don't want to make it impossible to roll wormholes. Just make it go crit randomly while rolling so people have to decide whether to take risk and try to fully roll it or leave it crit. Also, I'm sure there will be many krabs finding themselves stuck on the other side with rolling ships.
---
Watch Lasker's channel, they're always entertaining:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5F3RCReOweuoBYQlV3OIPQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5F3RCReOweuoBYQlV3OIPQ)
---
Not really. I've had several jobs in my youth where all I did was lift shit my boss pointed at. I think you just need to go and relax a little and rethink this whole thing because you're just making yourself look stupid at this point.
---
or just wait for your ship to be aligned and tap any arrow key before you are about to hit the target?
---
&gt;A small gang of frigates shouldn’t be able to dunk a dread, rorqual, carrier, or supercarrier while taking zero damage. They should all be one shot. If the USS Iowa could track a frigate at 20+ miles and dump a 2,500lb round in their lap in 1942 a space ship can sure as hell do the same.... stop whining.
---
The USS Iowa would be target practice for modern frigates and destroyers. Small ships plus air power (carriers or land-based) is literally the defining meta for real life. 
---
&gt;And on what planet should/would the USA Iowa be “balanced” with a friggin row boat ???
---
*This* planet. Torpedo boats and aircraft made battleships obsolete before the start of WW2. Nuclear ASMs and jets welded them into their coffin and buried them six hundred feet deep.
---
If EVE followed the rules of real life warfare, a small gang of stealth bombers would be an unstoppable god-tier threat to literally everything. Carriers backed by dozens of guided missile destroyers would be the only counter. Dreads would be a joke ship and Titans would make cool museums after they're mothballed.
---
It's actually cheaper. Cyno 1 vs 3 or 4
---
I use splashtop to manage my orders while watching movies ezpz
---
So what does that do other than stop someone ratting until they get back in?
---
More random wormholes could be fun, but making it so they could randomly be rolled out means less content for everyone.
---
You don’t get to catch them ratting anymore because they’re toons are stuck outside the hole
---
I was told not to use a Barghest for level 4 missions because it is inefficient and stupid. I am doing it now and enjoy the game a lot more and make good Isi. Do what you love.
---
You're welcome to go back to the eve o forums if you don't like hearing what people with over a decade of experience with the game and ccp have to say.
---
PVP in Eve is the most time consuming part of the game, usually it doesn't require any skill or attitude, because number of players and their shiptype solve everything. You usually don't have to think, aim or have some special skills, just lock target and faceroll f1-f5.
---
Eve has nothing common with good PVP games such as Lineage 2 or Aion, even BDO (shitty money sucking hole), which require skills and where you can solo kill 5 guys whith comparable equipment if you are skilled enough, where you can get as much pvp as you want in 10 minutes.
---
Eve is the game, where you have to spend hours again and again to find someone to kill, no matter you are alone or a 200 men fleet. 
---
Even survival games such as Rust or Ark Survival provide more pvp and more fun, despite it is about full loot.
---
Eve is a softcore farming simulator according to other MMORPGs or survival games, in other case no one would play it. WoW is the closest game to Eve by it's spirit and playstyle.
---
The best way to get pvp in Eve is to undock rorqual -&gt; start mining -&gt; wait.
---
I think the restrictiveness of being an alpha is a bit too much :(
---
There are people who buy their way into ships all the time there's nothing wrong with that it's his money what he does with is none of your business. Also it doesn't buy skill exhibit a. https://zkillboard.com/kill/78224491/ and skill is more important than what ship you can fly.
---
I come here for the tears, and stay for the Shenanigans. 
---
You know, the place with all the goofy shit on the walls.
---
Dude... did one of those boxes fell on your head? Because you clearly don't understand what I meant.
---
Yeah but then I dont have to read anything myself nor be on any comms. I just load up the game load up near and do my thing until the program screams at me. Sure people still have to write in chat channels but I no longer have to read them, which removes human interaction.
---
The one argument I'd have about this is Eve has a much lower starting skill.

R/eve is part of the Eve Online's experience. 
---
If you can take r/eve with its highs and lows, you can also take the game. 
---
Think of r/eve as a small experience of what the game has to offer. 
---
If you  take it too seriously you are not prepared to undock in game and fall into its darkest pits this sub has to offer. 
---
That is why this is a good thing, because it hardens you, filtering you from the rest of the 'casual' players. 
---
R/eve and Eve Online it is not meant to be played by everyone and anyone, that is why you should consider yourself someone if you make it in game and on r/eve. 
---
But if you really want to fiter r/eve from eve online, think of this sub as a place to unwind, to truly speak your mind... being bad about the game or good about the game. 
---
And if you let r/eve get to you, although you enjoy the game, create your own sub with blackjack and hookers.
---
No love for the OG pixel then

You also need max cap skills

Thank you for the answers. Just to be clear (since I am new to the game) Abyssal is the unknown part of the universe, aye? Also the PVE combat sites in C2 u guys are talking about are those visible in green right away when you arrive in the sector, right?
---
answered this already in thread some where.
---
How fucking long did it take you to get 300b isk.
---
answered this in thread some where.
---
Abyss are the sites that spawn when you use a filament. The “unknown” places are probably wormholes - not sure if you mean something else. C2/C3 are wormhole classes - C1 is the easiest and C6 is the hardest.
---
Bring back passive moongoo, the wars will restart.

Sins of a solar Empire with the eve mod is pretty cool \* looking for players to play online\*

I saw a group of four of them about two hours ago a few jumps out of Jita. Spooked the heck out of me, they were scanning the citadel I was in and I had no idea why the entire starbase was rippling in red.
---
and 3 more retris, and garmur, and loki and a bomber
---
don´t use a Barghest for lvl 4 missions tho
---
Making wormholes into Kspace gates. Pretty garbage.
---
it´s not like it matters what crabfest you join these days
---
While I do not necessarily disagree with you, I'll remind that hard != tedious.
---
Hard is when you have try something multiple times to get it right once. Tedious is when you have to spend a long time per try, but get it right most times.
---
I have the key but not the allowed phone :(
---
TL;DR: The Aether Skins for the guristas ships, Inner Zone Vanguard skins for (seemingly) every Gallente ship, and "Crown and Swords" skins for a good selection of Amarr ships.
---
Yeah it would be awful. Want to PvP? Tough, wait 16-24 hours for a new connection
---
As long as they include fleet comms, I will watch and listen to Eve gameplay videos.
---
Since you are discounting skill as not being an integral part of Eve Online and have absolutely no idea what I am talking about you really just look like a salty newbro here.
---
And so the desire for safe spaces continues unabated.
---
eve-o forums are that way --&gt;
---
Yeah unironic shanking of WH space. We need to preserve unique play styles not continue killing them off. That’s also not playing favorites either, I have no issue with two big entities brawling out in their supers. I’m well aware of how escalating to that point with frail recons is going to hurt that play style severely.
---
&gt;  easy or brainless as making the same amount of isk in null
---
And not unlimited. Sure you can roll statics for more sites, but the big isk/hr figures come from using capitals.
---
Isn't that the entire goal of your corporation though?
---
It has 100 less dps than a rattle for me and I really like flying it. It is more important to enjoy what you’re doing. Or should I fly a ship I hate to grind isk and quit the game?
---
Press "F" to use drones
---
That's not an activity I've ever seen anyone do.

Bonus based on performance did that.

There is a nonzero number of players that put the nergal as better than the kikimora.

Is this the more popular community server? I played UO way back before (and after) T2A and tried to find private servers that emulated it but they were always plagued with drama and "admin abuse".
---
It's a bait
---
Twat.
---
Even moreso with the new secret coming out on Friday at PAX
---
So many nullbears who don't understand WHs crying for a nerf.
---
Messing with rolling masses or unrollable WHs screws the PvP side far more than the PvE side that people are targetting.
---
More wandering holes, 5 min spawn of the K162 for rolled holes (delay allows ragerollers to scan and be on the new static before giving the K162 prior warning) and crit holes dying after 5 to 10 mins once they are mass crit would be the correct way to impact PvE without impacting PvE and ragerolling.
---
What is RR?
---
All Poses gonna explode.
---
This is actually Legends of Aria which is a crowdfunded UO clone. It was finished and released(I think? You can never tell with that soft launch crowdfunded bullshit) to the usual drama of broken promises and p2w.

Legends of Ultima itself is supposed to be a Legends of Aria private server that is more UO-like, without the p2w

You can set in game chat channels to flash when key words are present. Flag the next door systems and the in game client does the same thing.

You should see the GTA sub, it's just constant memes bitching about getting killed while doing courier missions as if the game is supposed to be a delivery simulator. Is Grand Theft Auto ffs, literally a game about causing as much criminality as possible!

If it makes you feel better, I have been playing  since 2005 and "Game is dying" has always been a thing. Whining about changes has always been a thing. Yet, here we are.

LOL wtf is happening

That's right. Obviously he needs to use a passive tanked drake.

just read the last line, its a whole lot of words to come up with a lore reason to shut off POS's for good, so before you get to excited think bad to how hard the game shit the bed when they initially fucked with local and imagine that for who knows how long to they sort out the "spaghetti code" involving removing POS's
---
There are a lot of groups that have the critical mass. The critical mass is "enough frigates in in fleet to kill any subcapital and every capital if you use bombers/kikis".
---
Everything else is the same thing, just with bigger toys
---
Because whenever you let players unchecked, they will optimize and min-max the hell out any game to the point that it's game breaking. Then a playstyle becomes dominant to the exclusion of everything else, and it kills the entire ecosystem, so developers step in and rearrange things to prevent that.
---
Because it's unrealistic and immersion breaking for any game that centers around warfare to portray warfare in the way that EvE does. You don't see fleets comprised only of carriers in real life, they need a ton of escorts to survive. Otherwise a single submarine (basically, a real-world version of a cloaky hunter) can ruin their day. There have been quite a few documented cases in NATO exercises where a submarine penetrated the entire defensive screen and surfaced within a mile of the US navy carrier in the center. You don't see armies comprised only of tanks or artillery, because tanks are basically blind to close proximity threats and taken down by a single infantry squad that flanks them with some anti-tank weapons, and heavy artillery with a range of 30-40 kilometers is cool as all hell, but it's useless against those 5 guys shooting at you from 50 meters away, just like a dread should be useless against frigates orbiting close to it.

Because the current situation breaks the long-established foundation of PvP mechanics in the game. Smaller has less EHP and does less damage but has better application and can choose the engagements thanks to higher speed. Bigger does more damage on paper but has worse application to anything smaller than itself, has more EHP but is slow, so if it gets caught by a lot of the smaller stuff, it's screwed and it dies. It has been like this since the launch of the game and it worked pretty well. It changed when POS started getting phased out because capitals would be left without a role, so they buffed their application against subcaps. They should have just made capitals better against structures, keep their original role (anti-structure and anti-capital DPS) and keep them dependent on subcaps for escort, instead of making them capable of deleting almost every other class of ship from the grid.
---
Because the existence of asymmetric counters creates more interesting gameplay and incentivizes people to spread out, instead of fighting it out on a single grid in 1% TiDi. It would be much more interesting if we could play "blitzkried in space" instead of "medieval siege in space". The reason we can't is that that the main valid "tactic" for strat ops is n+1, which translates to "bring more dudes than the enemy does in the biggest possible hulls". Then the enemy responds in kind and you get a few trillion isk on grid in bad gameplay conditions (lag, tidi, disconnects, etc), so that both sides are too scared to commit to a fight. It's like you start playing rock-paper-scissors (that's what EvE used to be) but after a few rounds and changing of the rules, you end up in a situation where paper and scissors are useless. So everyone just play rock every round. Hardly engaging, definitely predictable, ultimately boring.
---
Because 40m/hour for a minimally engaging activity is still enough to grind 2-3 doctrine fit ships (which are also covered by SRP by most big alliances) and then work on your own personal projects.
---
Because a single region should not be able to support tens of thousands of players through endlessly respawning anomalies, otherwise they have no reason to get off their lazy ass and invade anyone else.
---
I could go on for days, but that's why.
---
Things have been getting buffed and nerfed throughout the game's life (correct me if i'm wrong, but didn't nano-fits get nerfed a few years ago?). It's just that the past few years things have been moving in a certain direction pretty consistently, people got on the bandwagon and it destabilized the game even more. Well, it's going to get nerfed sooner or later, like it has happened in the past.
---
Don't like it? Don't play it. Nobody's forcing anyone to keep doing something they don't enjoy.
---
I left the game when it was obvious it was becoming "capital ships online" and so did most of my group. I came back 12 years later to find the game is still alive. You can also take a break if the current situation is not to your liking. The game will still survive without you, you'll play something else and come back later with a more relaxed, fresh attitude, possibly doing something completely different. There are loads of things to do and try out. Personally, i'm currently playing more on my alt account than on my main and doing completely different activities than what i originally did. Plus, nullsec is 20% of the population and not every single guy in null is against the changes. I think it mostly depends on the activities they prefer and the type of ships they like to fly.
---
So, instead of spending a ton on injectors to skill into whatever is the flavor of the month and then blaming CCP for trying (not very successfully, admittedly) to rebalance their game, why not recognize that you're riding the wave of cyclical imbalance and at some point it will get nerfed back into reason? At that point it's much easier to make up your mind and decide whether to take a risk and inject into the "flavor of the month" ships, or just keep doing your own thing and save yourself some potential trouble.
---
Last but not least, on the matter of login numbers, i remember a time when peak concurrent players were 10-15k on weekends, there were no injectors, plex or skins to buy and yet, CCP didn't go bankrupt or anything. In fact they made enough money to develop all the cool shit everybody is now taking for granted and complaining about.
---
You expect them to have the replacement ready the same time as the removal? LOL remember the WH change and how long it took them to put in the new mod for HIC to roll WH's?
---
make them active. jam system for 3 hrs when activated then, cooldown for 20hrs or something.
---
Makes it still possible to lock out enemy super fleets for specific timers. But it is not oppressive anymore, but one-time tactical decision (that can actually backfire)
---
the way its written makes me think its fake anyways, and op didnt provide a link
---
It does not matter how much spaghetti are tangled inside the bowl when you throw the bowl away altogether )
---
My money my problem.
---
xD it's funny because eve and spreadsheets get it? haha xD funny
---
WOT?
---
RiP shield supers and TAPI
---
Lol they have been taking about its replacement forever. Though you sadly have a point.....
---
How long does it take to punch in a credit card lol
---
How is this 'chaos', they were going to go the way of the dodo oneday. Are we now considering Hilmar not putting butter on his bread chaos too?
---
How come he only got 12 mil from the 2 billion bounty?
---
Delet pos &amp; tether what a time to be alive.
---
it´s you guys who are moaning tbh
---
Well ive played on and off since 2006, and spent most of my time played skilling up 5-8 characters, and now only one has any sp.
---
It would have lived if it was an armor super?
---
A hole going crit doesn't stop you rolling, it just means you finish it off with a hictor. Your proposal would add a little tedium but not fundamentally change anything.
---
Today they remove POSes, then they will nerf caps, what next ccp?!
---
what matters is what the spaghetti is attached to that is still in the game. They were supposed to do the same thing with the chat servers, and we are still having issues with local not working the way they wanted. This evening in 1dq1 local was showing people who didn't talk there, and many of them were not actually in the system. If it took them a year to still not figure out the code involved in local, how much worse are POS's, a mechanic tied closely to in-game functionality going to affect everything else?
---
What is also a good guideline are the capswarm skill plans here: https://capswarm.goonfleet.com/required adjust for your case
---
Link?
---
just remove capitals already, maybe the game will become playable again. also, ban goons. grrr, goons
---
source?
---
Oh god he’s eating it! It’s so dry, how is he not choking? This is a chaotic event.
---
With the way hilmar has been pushing for his bad ideas to be released with no notice who knows if its real or not?
---
If it was a more stable product, I could recommend this.
---
Studies have shown that anger promotes people to act twice as much as other emotions, but it's also the emotion that distorts your worldview the most. You're twice as likely to post about something that made you angry than you are to post about something that made you happy, and that post is twice as likely to make others angry about the same topic than the happy post is to make its readers happy.
---
Lol, had me in the first half NGL
---
me and my poor little A6 is shit out of luck then :/
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure a number of folks kept krab alts in WERMT and pvp pilots in NC for whatever reason.
---
We all know the reason.
---
supers get get fucked lol
---
Just like society today... only the slack jawed morons who disagree with an opinion have to make sure it is known rather than see some good in anything.
---
OP not giving a source, linking screenshot rather than link. Also nothing is announced on the games website.
---
This is a shitpost and you all are fucking retarded
---
Death to all Supers!
---
Sometimes I find myself in an inexplicable cheerful mood, quite contrary to my usual morose self.
---
X4 came out end of last year. New expansion coming out this year. It is pretty good and getting better.
---
That’s what I am thinking
---
&gt;why is so much of the game 'lock target and f1'?
---
Theree's a vocal population of PVPers that want to turn Eve into World of Warships.
---
Thank you. So you recommend doing Agitated Filaments with normal frigates?
---
Second Galaxy is coming out on mobile soon
---
I’m interested. I’m perturabo on the discord. EU tz
---
is it pos removal or deactivation and sticks remain and people who like to bash them can continue to bash them? i mean its still a content for a lot of hs carebears
---
uff discord never used it xD but i have time at the weekend
---
Probably something with citadel defenses as well and shield tank capitals will lose some shield hp to compensate for shield slaves.
---
Nobody is able to find the official link to this.... well played OP. Many knees were jerked.
---
Um...citadel's.
---
In my experience MOST of game subs are just as bad as this one.
---
I learned my lesson on The Division. Not only do these people ruin experience for everyone else, but they spread theor fucking shit so much that they leave developers no choice but to listen to the “community”. In this instance, they literally ruined a game. And that game was, for me at least, a breath of fresh air in gaming. 
---
In other words, I basically avoid reddit since then. Good information is near impossible to find. Because it’s just toxic bullshit or a bunch of kids spamming meme crap all day long.
---
It doesn't take mu h spaghetti figuring out to just turn them off.
---
Looks like they’re for missions. I’m guessing your site was a mission site.
---
If not idk. I’m guessing they’re items you can sell to NPCs.
---
There appear to be zero buy / sell orders for them. Maybe they’re really rare and you can sell it for a lot. Idk.
---
we are all elite pvpers on this blessed day
---
And "the Concord" instead of just "Concord".
---
You probably aren’t running the latest version then. Get it here: https://discordapp.com/invite/CwtD4Pe
---
Any recommended mods?
---
wow, look, CCP took their eggs off the shelf and did something cool. Eve is alive!!!!
---
What I have always heard from CCP is "one player action equals one in-game action," or something similar.  I take this to mean that, if you have a voice attack command such as "scan" that then caused your one client to perform a dscan, that would be fine.  However, if your "scan" command tabbed through all of your accounts, dscanning each one, that would be bannable.
---
However, you could and probably should just ask a GM and not risk your account on advise that you got from r/eve.
---
Now *that's* the EVE Mobile we want...
---
You largely nailed it here I think!
---
I remember the Ultima thing - and they did ruin the game by making it easier.  The thing that has to be noted though is that they made a business decision.  They were not worried about making the game "better" for the players in any way besides keeping them spending money.
---
Having the "easy mode" players leave is problematic in that CCP is a business.  They have operating costs and a profit motive.  If there is a smaller player base, they need to squeeze more money out per player.  Eve is expensive.  Eve is very very expensive.  Whether it is money or time, people spend far more on it than other games.  CCP is simply trying to squeeze more out of the current player base.  I do not believe for a second that they are trying to make the game "better" as the players would define it, they are looking for profit.  Making sure that the current playerbase has more trouble obtaining isk in game (as well as having to risk lots of isk to try) is a business decision.
---
Then you just train into a Phoenix or Rev, right now the Nag is very powerful in WH brawls (capless guns means you can focus boosters on tank), if OP gets into C5 PVP then nag is certainly a decent option.
---
Uhm yes? Atleast within range. Its sure as shit safer than trying to warp around in tidi.
---
Much earlier than me. I started here in 07/13
---
there are still things citadels don't do well, the eviction stick you need for 2 hours or the temporary titan bridge pen for example.
---
I was elected to lead, not to read.
---
\-where- in high sec?
---
in lonetrek I dont remember the system
---
By buying more plex and injecting... Exactly how they want you to do it.
---
Been playing for about three years, spent last year and a half in null. Am no cap pilot and in no hurry to be cause other game styles are more fun for me, but i like the game a lot now. I like the emptiness and the cold in null, even though it always looks too empty in the summer. I like the cyno changes and am waiting for a new update to encourage cap deployment, i am sure it will be here soon. Not everyone here thinks eve is dying!
---
even larger fleet battles? What do you get from them. I can barely discern what is going on in them?
---
what system do you run your missions in? For research purposes.
---
he has not passed his bounty hunter exams to get the full license yet
---
see this is my general take as well. It's just like really bad rgb on the screen
---
1: It means you can’t reliably 1 shot a hole with a rolling carrier, also, +-25% can be the difference between a 4 cap fleet with light support (T3s, Vigis, Nestors, BCs) and suitcase bhaals vs a 2 cap fleet with more support but, well, only 2 caps...
---
2: More roaming is always nice, it wouldn’t be a nuisance.
---
&gt; Moreover, statics should stop leading to specific type of space or wormhole class, those also should be random.
---
Then it stops being a static, WHs are chosen entirely because their statics are good for PVP (or PvE in a few cases), messing that up is just a major pita with no real benefits (it also makes C5 space much less attractive with no cap rolling).
---
grammar looks off and way too many commas, looks amateurish even for ccp standards
---
Not other successfull game as eve I think.
---
Why are you asking questions you dont wanna hear the answer to?
---
Its not, its small gang vs big gang. Botting hasnt vanished, just because you dont see it doesnt mean its gone. The economy is broken, we have lost a shitton of players, content has already started to dry up and so on. I mean its a long fking list of things that went to shit. You, like many like you, arent even looking at the big picture. You like it and thats all you see.
---
But even CCP has already stated that the outcome isnt optimal. 
---
Who gives a shit about afk PvE outside of your vocal minority? The game isnt strictly PvP either. Its a sandbox game with many many elements in it. If it was a pure PvP game then everything would be NPC bought. But it isnt right?
---
I mean some of these arguments are really bad. Like PvE is gonna vanish all of the sudden, if it does the game dies that very instant you get that right?
---
They are not replacing POSes , the are cutting them out entirely
---
Shut your mouth, you're talking like a hedonistic Gallente or a slave, Amarr Victor!
---
Do you have a source for this /u/Waselon
---
Neither of those things are things we really need to have in the game though.
---
Really? Cocaine is a hell of a drug dude. 
---
New player, I've played this game since 2003. The numbers are lower than they were since the last time they obliterated capitals.
---
Those are the first triglavian titan blueprints to ever drop
---
&gt;disruption in the work of the emitters of the protective fields of citadels and super-capital ships
---
What does this mean?
---
Oh yeah now I remember one of the message was about some Tyrannos dude or idk about a miniature doomsday I didn’t understand everything.
---
"disruption in the work of the emitters" sticks out like a sore thumb, other than that its not the worst thing they ever posted if it turns out to be real.
---
Just like it was in the early days of classic. Blizzard just wants to give you the full experience. :)
---
Since you arent a real wormholer, let me explain.
---
When an eviction is performed typically you need a beachhead for a few hours before you anchor a structure (if this even happens at all). Removal of POSes without some sort of replacement will favor the defenders even more, making evictions less likely.
---
Keel in mind this is not on grid with a B274, so you may not have seen it before.
---
r/eve has definitely gotten more and more bitter over the years, about pretty much every change ccp has made to the game.
---
would like to give more than 1 upvote ...
---
X4 wasn't mentioned until you said something. My bone to pick with that game, is it still needs a bunch of features and for it's economy to get unfucked. I put 40 hours into it before I got tired of dealing with stupid things and dropped it for a couple patches to come out.
---
My best guess, based on the vague hints in the above, as well as some rational deduction is this - Ships that cannot dock at a thing cannot tether at it.  Which functionally means Supers do not get to tether off anything but a Keepstar.  
---
This will put supercaps in greater danger when deployed in any system, especially those w/o a friendly keepstar, and seems consistent with the "Era of Chaos" mantra.
---
That's my guess anyway.
---
I definitely second that Perpetuum is close to eve. It got the same kind of market, a fitting window (without simulation though), bot (instead of ship) insurance, player controlled outposts, corporations, don't deploy (instead of undock) what you can't afford to lose (at least in some parts, you're unfortunately completely save \[from players\] in the carebear areas).  
---
It is mostly dead, I agree to that as well. For me that is actually kind of cool, because the individual players has much more impact on the game world if only 30 ppl play regularly, compared to a few thousand.
---
Certainly, having fought in them myself and having kept somewhat up to date with which side hates who it usually doesn't take me long to understand who is against who, with what doctrine and how I'd expect the battle to play out. Beyond that I just love seeing ships get blown up in a video that doesn't make me want to sleep cause EVE at 1x speed is really boring to watch to me. Which is why the commentary videos get skipped by me, as more often than not they are real time, and I don't require the explanations. While FC/fleet comments from time to time are fine for important decisions that may have swayed the battle, hearing the FC call out a new primary 100x is rather unnecessary from my point of view. Seeing a kitey small gang fleet just fighting an enemy fleet that wouldn't ever have a chance of defeating them is similarly uninteresting to watch for me.
---
However, I like the videos more when both sides escalate, as it means both sides see a chance for victory, rather than it just being a 300 vs 50 battle that is basically already decided before the fight even began.
---
the lore better be fucking spicy for the last few events!!!! love me some precursor backstory
---
Best way to start learning to FC a microgang or small gang is from the tackle role if OP wants to go down that route.
---
Would also be lovely if the mods actually did mod things. Such as banning people who post literally nothing but "you're a mouthbreathing pubbie". Seriously, there are people here who have been "contributing" nothing but posts like that and it is obvious that the mods are either absent or don't care.
---
If I was CCP I would be embarrassed to have this subreddit associated with my game.
---
It doesn’t mean anything because the post is fake
---
i got the las one =) only use discord for the versions but i dont like it
---
&gt; few hours before you anchor a structure
---
Why?
---
&gt; without some sort of replacement 
---
Citadels.
---
Drake &gt; else
---
WTB link to source
---
Too sweaty
---
wtf i love triglavians now
---
But seriously, I like that the trig story around this is shaping the potential changes, I know it fundamentally makes very little difference but it gives me a lore-boner.
---
Of course, it'd have been even cooler if they dropped that this was going to affect citadels _after_ the fact, just to see the rage and/or delight permeate through r/eve
---
Gank it.
---
Yea it's all fun and games until it reaches international waters.
---
Even doh i love blackout and cyno changes i still lose interest in the game. Its to static. Nullsec powerblocs sit like that for years and nothing hsappends. CCP has lost control over the game few years back and now they have a monumental task in front of them. Retain players interest in EVE.
---
Flying mounts is one of the huge sticking points so they'll have to sort that out before releasing the later expansions, if they do at all
---
Similar to EVE, there aren't... it's unique.
---
remote repair, it's a high slot module
---
The only ones I find any enjoyment watching are my own replays. Reason being is I have 5 accounts and multibox several of then at a time in different variations for different circumstances. 
---
So I like to review them after every fight/capital drop/snipe and run and look for any mistakes I made so I can improve on each engagement.
---
All supers, citadels and control towers everywhere in new eden will lose shields. #chaos\_era
---
”The new bounty system only pays a portion of the bounty at a time. The **amount paid is at most a percentage of the target's value loss**. eg. blowing up the shuttle with a 100 millions bounty target won't pay as much as blowing up a battleship with the same 100 millions bounty target. The number is 20% of the target's value loss or whatever is left in the bounty pool if it's less than 20% „ 
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Bounty\_Hunting\_System](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Bounty_Hunting_System)
---
Citadels are not a replacement - they take 24 hours to anchor, and a week to unanchor. They do not serve the same purpose as POSes - I literally don't know how else to explain this to you.
---
If you have random bounty selection do you really need no notification?
---
What app is that? Teamviewer works sorta fine for me but there's a black square right where the cursor is in Eve.
---
If by astounding you mean "it is now actually playable and even enjoyable", then yes. Still nothing actually amazing about that game, though. Just an arkadey simple fun game without commitments or drastic curves to learn in an hour or two and enjoy for a few days. 
---
X4 is still somewhat raw - though I did really enjoy it. Nowhere near as much as x3, but soooo much more than X:R. The truly amazing economic feats one could achieve in X3 was worth it alone, not even talking about building a semi-automated mega-empire in the process...
---
Yeah you should try to get out of the blob fest and try to actually play the game. I think you are missing a lot of it...
---
And further still, CCP always uses "CONCORD" rather than "Concord", as it's an acronym.
---
*Consolidated Cooperation and Relations Command*
---
Dude... you need something BEFORE the anchoring citadel. Didn’t you move to POSPY or something? These are things they need to tell you about normal Eviction SOP.
---
You will learn this guy knows nothing about Eve but continues to argue with people about it.
---
Can't find source, where is this from?
---
The last post I made on this sub was a propaganda post, that poked at how we need the bees to have a civil war.
---
It hit around +300 within an hour, then got mod-removed, followed up by a mod sending me a warning to not post it again.
---
A community is generally about only as good as your mods. In this case, we can expect the community to be pretty useless and full of salt.
---
I specifically mentioned that static wormholes should remain untouched so you can always rage roll or people can rage roll into you. 
---
I'm only asking for wandering wormholes to be un-rollable or very difficult to roll with increased spawn rates.
---
Almost as bad as the sad little twats who have to keep coming here to remind you they don't play.  Move on then pal, we'd forget you if you only shut up.
---
Guys it's a fake post most likely. No source and there is nothing like this on the official blog
---
Get trolled I guess [https://gyazo.com/2a1f5f039f80940d21a28429d636a4d5](https://gyazo.com/2a1f5f039f80940d21a28429d636a4d5)
---
For point no 1. that would mean in low class 2000 hole would be between 1500 - 2500. You would roll this bm. normally with extra few IQ required. This would also mean that at worst case scenario you can only take 7 no higs BSs through hole safetly (In a way that you get back) compared to current 8. This would make things safer for people in other side krabbing.
---
Point 2: Just few extra minutes used to roll these away.
---
Why are you wasting your time, the guy clearly doesn't even play the game or fly anything above a frigate anywhere outside of highsec.
---
I understand your concern and agree with you
---
&gt; you need something BEFORE the anchoring citadel
---
Why? The pos isn't going to keep the citadel safe.
---
That's not fair. They've not been talking about it forever. It's only been like 10 years since they started talking about replacing POS. Got to give them a bit of time to work.
---
So you're going to be on defending anyway. What benefit is the pos?
---
Came in to write that. Not about space at all, but I was impressed how easily it was to compare things - or, for example, explain some EvE enemts to people who only played Albion by using Albion terms instead of EvE ones. 
---
On the other hand, the scope feels... smaller. A bit like EvE-light. And no space.
---
Calling bullshit on this post.
---
What a trash
---
Exactly. I'm pretty sure most of the people who complain about c5 ratting are imagining it basically being null with unlimited respawning anoms and no chance of you being rage rolled into
---
Maybe Hilmtard wrote it himself this time
---
Hard to say. My interpretation (hopes) were that this would remove shield timers from low-power citadels, and severely nerf/remove the Rorqual PANIC module.
---
My reasoning is: The PANIC module, as stated in it's description, is based on Upwell Citadel shield tech. It would make sense that a lore based nerf targeting citadel shielding would affect that too.
---
There is a fast workaround that doesnt require lots of dev code and planning. Buff warp speeds of all ships like x3, and that way you kinda reduce the size of ur universe, the time it takes to navigate your big world. Yes, some systems will still be empty, but it'll take you less time to get to the ones that are populated. Lets just say that flying HS and empty LS 30 to 60 minutes in BS to get to a populated pvp zone is just plain bad. Roaming less populated zones will require even more time to find a fight.
---
Proving fake pic is fake with another pic, that's some new level :D
---
&gt; Please define "Risk-free" 
---
Losing no more than a mere 3% of your farm during farming activity on average.
---
Point 1 : It will have more severe effects in high-class wormholes. 
---
Point 2: Yes, but it increases the chances of people getting caught off-guard while busy krabbing.
---
Space is really big. Unlike some space themed games "cough* Homeworld *cough* Eve does not distort ship models to keep them visible at great distances. Overlays, icons, "dots" are needed to provide the information and context required to interact with the game environment in a meaningful way.
---
If you're interested in learning more, try joining one of the many newbee friendly organisations in the game. I usually point people at Karmafleet(.org). They're Reddit based and open to just about anyone with a good attitude who's willing to learn.
---
Some pepper just enjoy the salt.
---
&gt;And not unlimited.
---
Until you run out of filament in your WH :)))))
---
Remember that CCP is also removing the rolling of the wormholes.   So you will have the doors open.       
---
You will just need to control the entrance.
---
Shitpost 10/10, well played OP
---
Well, "better" or "worse" is entirely subjective anyways, lol.
---
CCP has not officially said this, but ok.
---
You need somewhere to store your rolling ships, sabres, instalockers, booshers etc.
---
"...battle against the Concord..."
---
This is the best fleet fight video I have seen. Gets good at 1:10. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c5vkbwU8cI
---
Any "small" group with the organization to take a small amount of sov would much rather go into wormholes instead. Inherent safety from hole masses, less contested space, an order of magnitude higher isk if they aren't too large.
---
Yeah, that won't work.
---
It'd require a small modification to the programs, but turning off chat logging doesn't solve the problem when external chat programs exist.  Just point the program to an intel jabber room or whatever instead of the EVE logs.
---
Quantum rise music. 
---
If you have an iPhone try out jump desktop, works decently for me
---
"Crop rotation" allows you to keep things more concentrated and under the umbrella vs spreading apart.
---
That's a horrible acronym for such a name.  Coop &amp; Rel.. Comm = CORD?  Where does the D come from?  
---
Gee thanks, that makes me keep thinking CONCORC.
---
Memes are automatically removed.  Please submit to /r/evememes instead.
---
Was a cheap shot, I admit it
---
I haven't really lived on high class but this is my theory: Lets say you find one of these "random" holes and it opens up to people doing sites in dreads the following happens -&gt; with -25% mass possible this means that the lowest amount you can expect the hole to have is \~2250 and you need to setup your gank comp according to this. Now normally from my understanding you use 3 dreads to do sites. 3 dreads is not a light gank target to kill which means that you might no be able to dunk these guys bcs there might not be enough mass in WH to bring comp in. If you roll the random hole to BS site fleet from initial jump they just MJD out cloak up and scan the new sig(sig list updates(flashes) when new sig pops up). ezpez.
---
At that point it would become even better. You could get it to send pings etc. You could be even more afk than before

please not more p2w dead on arrival instanced pvp content kk thx bye
---
Sounds like you want Wormholes to be handled with kid gloves because you're afraid they'll get a real Chaos treatment like what Null has gotten. HTFU
---
CCP Lebowski confirmed this is a hoax.  We are some gullible folk.
---
Or, y'know, learn how to be goddamn civil and not act like kids. With the average age of players some of the responses are ridiculously angry.
---
I think this is my favorite post that you have ever made.
---
They should add a player built gate to wormholes restrict the size to hole so small for small medium ect. Remove rolling and have natural forming holes that cant be rolled.  Player built wormhole gates could be turned on for a huge cost and running cost but create and artificial wormhole with a gate at one end and normal wh exit at the other, this would have to be turned off to shut the hole down or reinforced by hostiles to be shut down. This would be very expensive to run but also stratigicly  good.  It doesnt change it much but adds restrictions and isk sink instead of the current safe 1 min rolling times 30 sec for a new sig. roll again.
---
Or maybe your post was just bad
---
Agreed. This sub sucked out all the happiness I had had just multiboxing highsec incursions because I was too scared to get blown up outside of FW. NS powerbloc issues are the kind that this sub trumps up a lot yet it doesn't really touch those soured by the callousness of nullsec corps.
---
&gt; This sub really sucks the enjoyment out of the game. 
---
Every single game subreddit bitches and moans about the game like "DEVS LISTEN TO US EVERYONE WANTS X" but when you play the game with normal people and ask them about X they dont really give a fuck.
---
wouldn't.the +300 karma suggest otherwise?
---
The 'D' is at the end of Command.
---
You sound traumatized. Show us on the spaceship where the capital touched you.
---
Well yes and no.        
---
Hilmar stated that CCP is looking into it.
---
As there's no source, nor a post (Which i can find) on the Eve online forums, it's most likely this isn't a real image (Also https://i.imgur.com/EGmFHb0.png)
---
Minmatar need more skin love :(
---
You use a bhargest for lvl4's? Lmao
---
Damnit I wish this wasn't fake it sounds amazing :D
---
The game becomes more difficult in 2019 with using the d scanner daily.
---
goon detected.
---
It's funny tho, why people think the opinion of a new player would be more valid than arguments between veterans. By definition, new players really don't know what they are taking about.
---
Not spaceships but Albion Online I am told is quite similar to EVE
---
Don’t buy plex go play WOW Classic
---
Anyone tried [Avorion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/445220/Avorion/) there is lot of good review
---
You forgot: reeeee someone else went reeeeeee
---
Here is a game that prob no one here knows about but has similarities to EVE in a different theme settings.
---
**SalemtheGame**
---
Game Features:
---
* Sandbox MMORPG
---
* Persistent, terraformable and mutable world.
---
* Crafting, farming and building.
---
* Open PvP combat with permadeath.
---
* Free to Play.
---
&gt; Players can train a vast array of proficiency which enable access to tons of difference skills. There are no caps on proficiency levels nor no limit on how many skills your character can achieve. Build a town, small camp or be a hermit living off the land.  Many options for farming, building, mining, gardening, tool making and much more.  Being a sandbox you are only limited to your imagination of what you wish to create and achieve. -[source](http://gamingwithdaopa.ellatha.com/salem/)
---
This game runs on java, the graphics are dated and the combat is wonky, but everything else is top notch on what I think makes a good sandbox MMO.
---
You're exactly right. While Eve online does have a pretty active Reddit community it's no different than any other game. WoW subs, Overwatch subs, any game is going to have max reeee posting about every change that's made good or bad. This sub isn't special, the vocal minority doing all the reeing just think they are. Still a great community and a lot of good people and discussion in this sub.
---
Looks like this famous streamer.    [Suitonia](https://zkillboard.com/character/1192491827/) is his name. :D
---
But... but that requires at least a couple of minutes of effort on my part. Can't you just feed it to me?
---
Shitposts can get upvotes, doesn’t mean that they’re actually good or belong, and if mods don’t do anything about them then subs get flooded with them and all other content drops off
---
Do they make you assign some other hotkey to weapons in your nano gang of 640 members then? How liberating
---
That is not at all what was said, go relisten to the clip. He said it's too routine/predictable/controlled which most of us would agree with, there is a 0% chance that he meant they were considering making holes unrollable because even a cursory thought in that direction makes it pretty obvious why that's stupid.
---
sorry about the messed up font.
---
And many more butt cheeks puckered...
---
Looking into does not mean removing.
---
The numbers speak for themselves thou.
---
I did a Zkill pull a while back and all WH space combined has around 2-2.5x the isk killed of Delve, but shits out 3x the isk. Delve is one of the safest regions of null by isk destroyed/isk created, with the sov null "average" being about twice as high.
---
Suitonia is one of the most intelligent and skilled players iv ever met. He has great  rhetoric and his content is pretty educational.
---
Remember that most pople in this sub see PVE as a means to an end of putting money in their wallet to do something else. Paradoxically this means they get really good at it to maximise isk/hr. If the activity is the fun itself for you then its a completely different situation.
---
Quality shitpost
---
You got anger out of that, incivility? 
---
Projection much.
---
@frosty dont make me put more bounty on you  [https://gyazo.com/fd53993b18063028b9e1de248ff3222f](https://gyazo.com/fd53993b18063028b9e1de248ff3222f)  :)
---
I agree with you on the serious business is followed by boredom. I think that's where I've been the last two years. The only difference now is I stopped my subscriptions from renewing. I can't justify the cost of 7 accounts in my current situation, especially when I hardly login.
---
This is really cool but with the delayed reaction on the mouse, if you get dropped on, it's going to be bad. 
---
Now the perfect application of this is updating and moving pi
---
I think the challenge with eve videos is that the strength of the game is in how story driven it is and if all you have to go by is what's on screen it doesn't generally provide the context needed to tell that story. A video of a supercapital kill is fine in general but it's way better if someone tells you why and how it all happened.
---
Perpetuum was made by ex EVE devs iirc.
---
"EVE but with mechs"
---
I tried it ages ago and it was dead back then too.
---
Post the msg of the mod or it didnt happen..
---
Guilty. You are what you eat.
---
I thing he meant to say that closed beta should begin in 2043.
---
Yeah, the bullshit that changes absolutely nothing while the game has massive problems. It's almost as if players want the game to remain shitty as long as they can catch some random caps.
---
I've been looking at this sub for a while and have been playing since 2011, I think this sub has always been going on about how the game is dying and just been rather negative. I just try to upvote the posts that seem like people are having fun, cause I know I'm still having fun in EVE.
---
This sub is only a result of what you find in-game.
---
Strange, you only have 4 posts and they are all ‘grrr CCP you are nerfing my 99.99% safety in Null’.
---
&gt;people are just discovering it and are willing to stay because of how great this game is
---
Tell us about that 4% retention!
---
So do most so called elite PVPers
---
ah, there's the fallacy you kind of people often fall into. something doesn't have to be entirely eliminated for a change to make a difference. obviously, blackout hasn't completely eradicated botting, but it has made botting more difficult, and thus less goods are being botted and that's a boon for the game. "x still happens" isn't a valid argument.
---
your best bet would be ultima outlands i reckon, its pretty nice
---
Arty thrashers. T1 fit they are super cheap and have good alpha. Fun to fly
---
I'm curious, please link.
---
And i dont even play the game.
---
All of my upvotes
---
wouldn't look forward to moving said dread into the jewhole with no jump skills
---
Maybe he should take his own advice from back when CCP was making decisions that he happened to agree with
---
&gt; Stop trying to think. You are not developers or CEOs of a company. CCP have 20 years experience managing and profiting from this game. They know better.
---
I think you either have to have a system that accepts bounties on everyone or no system at all.
---
My launcher is oversized
---
How did you get the shots out 3x the isk bit?
---
Yeah I really enjoy pve, a lot more than pvp. It’s something I spend most of my time doing. Flying around in a Barghest is great for me and I enjoy it.
---
🎣
---
There are some static pve sites that looks pretty interesting.
---
I once found this *giant* wreck field full of these weird stone artifacts. I assumed they were related to the COSMOS mission arcs, or maybe those old DED sites you find occasionally.
---
Can I has your key?
---
Tic-Tac-Toe.... Worst game you've ever heard of.  But you've still heard of it.
---
Yeah! Because CCP balances with a 10 ton hammer lets fuck all other spaces as well!! That will be good for everyone involved.
---
July MER?
---
Exactly, that would all be shattered if they tried it for a month.
---
TL;DR - REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
To add to your last point, the whole game is focused around PvP. There are some more pacifist avenues like industry or mining, but the reason they exist is because PvPers will buy what industrial types make and then blow them up while fighting. The economy is centered around the making, buying, selling and blowing up of weapons, ammunitions and offensive modules.
---
There's are a couple avenues where you can be completely pacifist, but sooner or later, what you are producing will be used by PvPers or used to make weapons for PvPers.
---
You use a bomber fleet to take out the dreads. A few rounds of focussed void bombs and they will melt. 
---
With increased spawn rates there will be cases where people might not notice a new sig before it's too late. Especially if they are multi-boxing nestors and rattlesnakes. The point is to increase the risk and create more pvp opportunities and not kill high-class krabbing all together.
---
Get out of this sub, Nobody is quitting the game, if they do, they were not the content creators anyways, but rather pve krablords who would do nothing but print isk.
---
A lot of salt you're seeing are from these useless krabs, their only goal in this game is to gain isk, to what end, nobody knows, so now that their revenue source is under threat, they are crying about it.
---
Almost all of my eve career I have played in wormholes and there has been numerous times when my chain would be connected to a nullsec with ratting nyxes. random wormholes were the only way you had chance to catch them. It always blew my mind how people could use supers for ratting of all things and they were totally safe too, because the ammount of work it takes to kill a ratting super is far greater than to defend it and losing that one super has almost no impact to the person who lost it.
---
With blackout changes it has become much easier to hunt, dont trust people on this sub, most of them dont even play the game, you can go out yourself in a frigate 10 times and I guarantee you will find prey 8 times out of 10.
---
God, reddit is tame compared to my corps discord... I thought this was a fairly tame place.
---
The forum is fucking awful.
---
I used to LOVE watching kil2 videos. It really depends on who makes them and whether it’s just turbo folk music playing with lots of camera angles or if there’s people explaining why they are doing what they are doing.
---
[HFY link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw6BcQtszj0)
---
Less graphics, more text and menus. EVE is basically a MUD, anyway.
---
Wait, what? Why?
---
&gt;Random amounts of mass at random time intervals.
---
this either makes absolutely no difference or it makes holes mass effectively infinite. Rolling holes is pretty quick and done at times in a single strike, the regen would need to be insane to change anything im that regard.
---
&gt;Moreover, statics should stop leading to specific type of space or wormhole class, those also should be random.
---
so you want to remove statics then?
---
(think OGame)
---
CHEKI BREKI
---
Yeah I probably would I think. I don’t want it to happen but I’d restart from scratch.
---
Quit
---
It's a niche game that is only as old as it is because the people it does hook, stay, and for a very long time. In my opinion the low retention rate is synonymous with the things that make the game great in the first place. It's a harsh game to get into, there's always going to be a lower retention rate, but this is only exacerbated by a community that seems to want to cry out that the sky is falling every chance they get.
---
Tried that some years ago, and it wasnt "close", most of the UI and the like was almost an exact copy of eve only with mechs.  
---
Not sure if afterwards they made it more unique but back then i thought "holy fuck, is that even allowed".  
---
Seemed interesting tho, but it was already pretty much dead back then.
---
If it is so great, why won't you move there?
---
This is less a war of resource scarcity than a war combating the extremist fringe of a religion who believe you should join them or you should die. And that any atrocity, no matter how horrifying is sanctioned by their god because he didnt appear in front of them and say "Dont do it."
---
The US presence is there to to deny that profit stream to the extremist groups and to defend the oil not just for its own use, but for the use of much of the rest of the world too.  The last bit is the part that many smoothbrains like to forget when criticizing US policy.
---
The 2008 nostalgia is real.
---
I even remember gasping at "Beta Reactor Control: Shield Power Relay I" costing 4 million ISK. Thanks tiericide.
---
Didnt that one get shafted by ccps lawyers?
---
I feel so exposed.
---
In development for 7 years? Or in promotion mode for 7 years?
---
&gt; his either makes absolutely no difference or it makes holes mass effectively infinite. Rolling holes is pretty quick and done at times in a single strike, the regen would need to be insane to change anything in that regard. 
---
It's about not being able to crit-and-forget the holes when you want to crab, not to remove the ability to roll holes.
---
&gt; so you want to remove statics then? 
---
They are still technically "statics" as being ever-present in the system even when you roll them shut
---
Clowns cant be intelligent?
---
He migh be, but check his opinion on eve-offline its not working.
---
I recommend Mining is excellent with 2 pilots and 4 pilots. I love the ore and how it is beautiful.
---
Tried it, but i am not up to date how much it has progressed since ~ a year ago or so.  
---
Fun game, but its not eve. Not an mmo (tho it has multiplayer), and its more comparable to starmade and the likes, where you build your own ships, mine resources etc.  
---
If thats your kind of stuff, definitely worth keeping an eye on (or purchasing, if you dont mind the risks of early access)
---
Given that PvE fit ratting Titans abs Supers became the norm in Null, drastic measures were / are needed.
---
op says he wants to make space more dangerous and the changes he proposed are aiming to do that. Parent says changes he proposed will not really do that. That's all there is to this. stop trying to make this something it isn't, it shows
---
I recommend mission running in high-sec space.
---
&gt;messed up ~~font~~ post
---
FTFY
---
Now imagine what can be achieved by removing big cargo holds on mining barges and restricting number of accounts person can use!
---
this was jsut to proveto myself it was possible.
---
I don't plan on doing this ever again, I may use it to look into PI...
---
having said that, my search has begun for a bluetooth mouse i can sync to my phone.
---
Reminds me of Steam reviews you can find almost on any game's page bitching and giving it a negative because game in question is not something else entirely. I mean, there's a ton of that "something else" on the market, why not just pick one of those instead of bitching on this particular game's page?
---
Heh, guess it's especially all too familiar to EVE players now that I think about it.
---
tbf though, its a game made in the vision of 1 man and wont be released till he's satisfied. And from what he's doing currently, its gonna be one hell of a game once it comes out. Keep in mind, no release date ever announced and imo this is amazing. They say its done when its done, not before. Lots of companies nowadays wouldve shipped that game as "full release" already and then added "DLC's" over time, which he doesnt.
---
PS: whales are everywhere, not just in star citizen
---
lol such a convoluted way. Check this simple one
---
1. all whs are now shattered (get a 30 day warning to move citadels out otherwise they pop)
---
2. wormholes are now anomalies 
---
3. wormholes instantly spawn the exit
---
4. increase wandering   wh connections 10x 
---
tyvm.
---
Wow, yes.  Things like options, futures, shorting would introduce a whole new dynamic to the game - can you imagine the rumour-mongering posts that would flood this subreddit trying to influence market pricing?  You'd have legit daytraders and arbitrage - fantastic.  I actually really like this idea.
---
The WoW sub is a shining beacon of positivity compared to this sub. Even at its worst (post BfA release) that sub, while being largely negative, at least remained civil. People who troll or call other people retards get the boot very quickly.
---
What a nice kill.
---
Nice photo.
---
Well if CCP didn't do aggressive changes so quickly....
---
but the filaments would be the same as highsec isk. right?
---
The citadel.
---
&gt;It's about not being able to crit-and-forget the holes when you want to crab
---
that doesn't really happen, critting holes is asking for people to kill you
---
&gt;They are still technically "statics" as being ever-present in the system even when you roll them shut
---
i just dont get what this achieves other than making systems less unique and giving the krabs even more perks ala rolling their c6 holes to get a direct hs
---
&gt; Because it’s just toxic bullshit or a bunch of kids spamming meme crap all day long.
---
I remember how For Honor community had to create a separate competitive No Honor subreddit just to have some more civil discussion and tech sharing without memelods and scrubs shitting all over the place.
---
Thankfully, mods sort of do their job there, so the community doesn't have a need to create "r/trulycompetitiveforhonorforrealthistime" again and again.
---
Sry what is "RR" Vexor and Domis. New Player aswell here
---
Are you looking at sleeper components? And combining mining and bounty for Delve? Having done both c5 sites and carrier ratting in delve, delve pve is considerably more relaxed, lower effort, safer, more consistent. You can make huge amount of isk in c5 space, but you have to work for it and you have no guarantee any system will even have anoms in.
---
Comparing the entirety of wormhole space against 1 region (even if that 1 region is one of the safest) isn't right. Also remember blue loot has to be taken out and sold in high sec, it's not just automatically added to your wallet.
---
it tries to avoid perimeter taxes!
---
Someone put it really well, it’s less they have control and more they don’t know what they are doing. CCP genuinely does not understand how the game works. It honestly is as simple as that. A former csm member of a few years recently had his do not disclose expire and revealed ccp effectively is a derp company. Teams had plans to introduce some really cool and likely popular ideas to the game (did you know that destructible stations where supposed to come shortly after dominion? And there is a much longer version of dominion, but ccp execs basically cut out all of the stuff)
---
Funny how everybody says this but if they'd actually think about it, CCP's actions are not aligned at all.
---
If you are aiming for a bonus on active players why would you mass ban bots and then make the all the "unpopular" changes made in the last several months? 
---
And since everyone on r/eve  is gleefully reporting Eve players leaving in droves for classic WoW this would have to be the worst bonus campaign ever.
---
I miss Cymek so much :(

---
Can be a fun saltmine, but yeah. They're absolutely atrocious.
---
Everything he suggested would be to a Hunter's advantage...
---
Wasn't the common advice always to have a subcap main and a cap alt anyway? Subcaps to complete the objective or bait the larger fight and the cap for backup. It was good advice.
---
Chances are you have a muninn, ishtar, or Eagle pilot these days, train another 10 days and get that toon into a recon. Or shelve the cap temporarily and get an alt training.
---
I got 60m 2 weeks ago from his gila, so Im working on that bounty :D
---
&gt; because of this subreddit
---
Do we know it's because of this subreddit, and not because feedback CCP listens to is also posted on this subreddit, eventually?
---
Not a single WH corp is big enough to have bomber fleet with size that can kill dreads. 20-25 bombers dont kill krabb dreads, atleast i  have never seen this happen.
---
It is nearly impossible to not notice the sig list to update. Ofc there is always retards but not so often in high class. Also Nag will most likely start popping bombers the moment they start to aligning bombs.
---
GOOD RIDDANCE
---
You’re full of yourself!
---
Agreed with the saltmine. I had fun on the industrial cyno thread lol.
---
wormholers cried against nullsec, ccp checks mer data sees wormholes are not better for an inch, next target wormholes confirmed easy thought process.
---
Oh no, one more "I quit the game because of X, but I still make posts about it" tread...
---
do you seriously trust anything that Hilmar says? he's literally doing this to get more people to play EvE before the deal in October ends and then he's out...
---
Stop having fun! You're not supposed to be enjoying this and you're doing it wrong!
---
Meanwhile PL have alts in wormholes closing holes all except for one while they farm effectively risk free from any entry or how about the classic incursion alts? Kettle meet pot
---
Yes. But then you need to travle our of your WH.
---
Practice your writing.
---
Or in fact I want them to nerf PvE and not PvP, given that we are supposed to be playing a PvP game.  The Null Chaos changes have been about enhancing PvP over PvE as it should be.
---
&gt;Orange/White Nyx
---
Wow, Wingspan can do mass delivery now.
---
so, if my opinion does not matter in the slightest, why did you spend your precious time responding to my posts? looks to me like it's not as insignificant as you say it is...

---
Why do the amarr ones usually look so much better than the gallente skins?
---
People upvote garbage all the time. If the mods disappeared tomorrow the front page would be 90% dino suit """memes""".
---
Because Amarr are better than Gallente, that's why they have better skins
---
&gt;	wont be released till he’s satisfied
---
&gt;	once it comes out
---
This is entirely unrelated, your subjective definitions don't apply to a discussion about numbers.
---
I'm an active duty LT myself.
---
Go to FW lowsec. It's where the fun is at. Join a Corp of 100-200 people.  You will probably get 10-20 people on comms.
---
Join fleets or use your small team leadership skills to FC small gangs.
---
You will have a blast.
---
Contact me ingame: KiithSoban.  Put in an app to my Corp.
---
Fly safe buddy.
---
I dont know what's wrong with doing what you just said, that's good careful gameplay. Like, I cant figure out what pot is meeting what kettle and why. Stop posting
---
You call it promotion mode, I call it an exciting time where contributors get to play around with all the wonderful new features they will eventually be able to conquer the universe!
---
I mean yeah but then again there’s also statistics.
---
Why would you ever need to do this? Lmao nerd at breakfast still need your eve hit
---
well the average player skill of both games is comparable at least
---
The automod scheduler still does not accept our updates to this OP. The correct link for the discord is https://discord.gg/tWeMAek
---
Alternatively you can use the link animeistrash.org/eve (Yes, that's an actual redirect we set up).
---
So is docking up when you see hostiles in local or nearby systems. It’s just “good careful gameplay”. Problem is prey got really really good at doing that and the clustering of nullsec populations resulted in vastly superior Intel networks, back in dominion where most systems where empty Except for optimal ones hunters could travel almost freely without getting spotted or having their location known for 15-20 mins at a time. Regardless manipulating entry like that to something you only own is literally the definition of absolute safety, and I wouldn’t normally raise it, but when I see hunters bang on about null being safe, meanwhile they associate with alliances that use alts to make extremely safe money or what not I find the hypocrisy irritating.
---
I just wanna gril Rifters fer garsh sakes!
---
Well yeah, that's the discouraged part of doing it. So many people here will spew bullshit just because someone else had fun in a way that doesn't correspond to their way. And so much negativity...
---
Hi all, as promised the third part of my series on the truly amazing economy of EVE online. A huge thank you to everybody from the eve community who has assisted me with my research on these video's and for everybody else who has commented and created great discussions.
---
I will do my very best to reply to any comments here and over on the youtube video.
---
Otherwise I hope you enjoy :)
---
no u
---
And? I didnt say anything to the contrary
---
We have mods?
---
[Currently sitting at +632.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cvwci6/the_true_wow_classic_experience/)
---
I think this is a good enough example to not bother going farther back to demonstrate the high bar for posting this community requires.
---
One of the primary conflict drivers in Afghanistan happens to be rare earth minerals that go into every modern mobile electronic device.

People have used the term “war for oil” numerous times in context for Iraq.
---
When he said "you don't get it" he actually meant "you don't agree".
---
&gt;So we argue for a more balanced game and hope for the best.
---
You argue for easier kills. If you want a more balanced game, you would roam nullsec in places where the response is going to be equivalent (balanced) to what you are attacking with. There is no need to destroy play styles because you think it will be easier for you to ruin someone else's day. If you expect that 100 Titans will drop if you attack that Nyx, then bring 100 Titans with you... hey, you just got your ***balanced game!***
---
The casus belli is multi-tiered. You have resources, you have ideology, and you have religious extremism.
---
Religious extremism is the populist reason.
---
&gt; Where does the D come from?

from the center

&gt;A community is generally about only as good as your mods. In this case, we can expect the community to be pretty useless and full of salt.

Subreddits are incredibly useful for googling a very specific question and appending 'reddit' to it(r/eve included). The general day to day is mostly just complaining and memes though. This is the only large eve forum where you can actually do that though. CCP's forums are far too strict (probably for legal reasons) and discord isn't quite the same.
---
You speak of people that deploy 2000 Titans and Supers to bash undefended structures ? Or of the people that drop these guys daily in their krab space while heavily outnumbered?
---
remove local. problem solved. god bless.
---
FFS i just sold my super and am taking a break why CCP do dis?
---
That still doesn't solve the problem I listed though. If bounties are assigned by distance then there will be regions where you can live without ever worrying about bounty hunters because they're not close to any NPC stations and therefore no one in those regions would ever get selected by the bounty hunter agent.
---
If you stay on approach it begins to decelerate in the last few seconds. You need to double click behind them once close enough.
---
A myrm I guess... but tbh u won’t rly be fighting much. Just dying or getting ganked by more than u can bring. Find friends. Work with them. Covetors die easy. Use a proc if u want to fight stuff.
---
Ya, I don’t get the benefit of skill queue tweaking away from the game. Let us manage PI through the app. You can call it PlanetVille and allow walking in stations.
---
I enjoyed beating every dark souls game at level 1, difficulty is fun!

Thanks everyone I'll be giving it a shot!
---
I'm not so sure honestly. It's been fairly positive over the last couple months with the whole Age of Chaos thing. It went into a pretty bad slump around 2017 but we also had no wars, no generally viewed as positive changes on the horizon and a lot of really unpopular things were going on at CCP. Honestly, the subreddit served as a useful platform to communicate that to CCP. Even if it was communicated by literally throwing tendies at /u/ccp_falcon until he was permanently trapped under the sheer weight of it.
---
i always giggle a bit when ppl actually think wh krabbing with dreads in c5/c6 sites is safe
---
Most PvP I see is done with T2 cruisers and below or capitals. Outside of bashing or Ferox cheap fleets you hardly ever see battlecruisers or battleships in PvP.
---
&gt;the vision of 1 man and wont be released till he's satisfied.
---
That’s not how you build software. I’ve worked in the business for 20 years and if anyone had suggested this is how it should be done, that’s someone who is updating their resume.
---
It’s not even about features. It’s about having a plan to build and implement features and releasing a product to market.
---
They’ve now been at it for 8 years and they have a budget at a whopping $250 million dollars. A quarter of a billion dollars, thank you very much.
---
At an average life expectancy of 80 years, the product has now been in development for over 10% of that time.
---
For a budget of $250 million dollars you can tell your backers: “Thanks for all your support. Here is where we’re at: we are now releasing Star Citizen for you, to try out and show your friends. This is not the full product, not by a long shot, but it is something for you to start building your stories in. These are the features \[feature.list\] that are in the present product. We are currently working on \[more.new.features\] the release will be announced in due time. Over time we are working diligently to put our vision into an actual, living world for you to explore. So, go out with your friends, explore the universe we have built for you so far. Let us know what you like, let us know what you don’t like. We’ll be using your feedback to build a better product for you to help you tell the stories you want to tell."
---
And then people have something to play AND something to look forward to. $250 million dollars is a shit load of money. That will build very many features.
---
Right now, since the start in 2011, you’ve got no game and no release date.
---
The late, great Steve Jobs said: real artists ship.
---
My point is just that that is NOT the income he's talking about.
---
That isn't wormhole income.
---
&gt;Atleast within range.
---
Thats literally what we were arguing. Your force recon is not going to get alphaed at 70-150km range before hostiles can manage to jump in assets.
---
&gt; You saved me from having to pull my laptop out on shady hotel wifi
---
you should stop going to shady hotels
---
So what are you doing during that 24 hours?
---
Ship spinning in a pos?
---
a nyx in cyno range if someone takes your bait
---
:|
---
There are a lot of things you don't know.
---
&gt; Tell us about that 4% retention!
---
That is a very high number. In marketing a 4% conversion rate is very high. If they had a 4% retention rate I'd say CCP didn't just succeed, they excelled.
---
From the heart
---
Could u elaborate cause I am not sure if this was sarcastic or not.
---
I think the problem with goons talking shit is they’re literally the worst when it comes to risk free gameplay. It’s not really even the risk free part. I think the reason why a lot of us dislike goons is it’s an “easy” way out and can be a “lazy” game style for them. Like if you could not be lazy and mine billions effortlessly we wouldn’t have an issue. The problem is how even a guy drugged out of his mind sitting in a rorqual making billions is completely safe as long as he can say he’s tackled and drag a system, maybe a d scan, push cyno button, push panic and everything is alright. Living in a wh requires more effort, even defensively rolling holes requires you to at least think about mass. Pay attention to when new ones spawn. You also have more assets at risk in the WH. I guess I don’t hate goons, I just hate lazy play-styles that are safe and highly rewarding at the same time. This is what needs to be addressed. It doesn’t mean the blackout is the solution, or jump changes, things just need to happen to adjust the safety.
---
Hint. Use Nvidia Shield.
---
*coughs haws and mobile depots being out by default and again control and scout over the only entrance*
---
Your 1st point wouldn’t be that impactful, just annoying. However, it does annihilate triple dread nomadding because with a 25% random increased or decreased amount of mass theres a chance for a 3B XL hole to close after only 2 dreads. Would hate to see such a change come through. Especially since Im one of the few people who like doing it.
---
I'm not sure to understand what you want to do.  a covetor will die realy quikely even with a friend in a combat ship not far away.  
---
use a couple of battle procurer (buffer shield + bulked tank + tackle + 2 strip miner + lots of light drones)  
---
or only one procubait and some cloaky friend in stratios right next. or a not cloaky but ready to come (in a safe farer than 14AU, pre-aligned to you). for this kind of thing, I like to brawl with T1 BC (brutix or myrmidon) or faction cruiser if I want to kite (osprey Navy, omen Navy)
---
what do you mean with only entrance? you realize someone can roll in any time
---
Use two Procurers, you'll have better chances of survival than if you bring anything else that draws attention.
---
That being said, a cloaked T3C near a Procurer could be a good idea, since the surprise effect will probably allow you to kill whoever attacks you first. But that will only work a couple of times, then people will just attack you to bait your T3C and kill it.
---
Same can be said about you bud.
---
But just for a couple of weeks. And a Covetor is a shitty bait ship.
---
And the likelyhood of that considering how rolling works is low, not to mention you will know pretty much instantly when it happens if you have your scanner out pulsing every whole or so.
---
See, it's a very unbalanced situation if half of the nullsec farm activity moves to space which I need a bigger titan force to kill a rorqual. It makes the coalitions with biggest titan forces virtually immune to attacks. in turn more people join these coalitions. Drying content and fun everywhere else. Spamming the macroeconomy.
---
I am not arguing for easier kills. You are arguing to keep your risk free Farmville.
---
There are special anoms in certain systems. Not sure if related but there is a mission site in thelan that is the only one in the game to drop a certain item for exchange in an LP store for some ship. I don’t know, was kinda useless to me. However, it is there nonetheless.
---
If we go any harder than we are now people start rioting at us for being too strict. We're already inundated with complaints in this respect. There's always calls for removing something very vague and subjective like 'toxicity' but the line always seems to move ever forward and backward at the exact same time. 
---
The fact that you feel we're inactive is kind of a success in a roundabout sort of way. We're not, but you don't see us mentioned that much. That's how it should be.
---
Can’t edit the post for some reason, so more on that, if it’s your own hole you likely have a massive defensive advantage. The enemy can bring maybe 3 caps in, meanwhile the average c5-6 Corp will easily have 20+ combat ready caps.
---
thats a subjective statement. you also dont see it via "scanner out pulsing"...whatever that means. sounds to me like you are not very familiar with the mechanics and how "farmholes" work.
---
No shit.  I didn't quit playing EVE... I quit hanging out on r/eve.
---
Fucking whiners.
---
Go for a tornado. If bad guys show up, kill the Covetor.
---
wrong. ppl ratting in c5/c6 space are doing so in individual farmholes where they live alone with alts or with 1-2 other ppls alts. there is no defense fleet. again you proof you dont have much knowledge about wh farming
---
The new what?
---
If you are allowed to do something for years and then that right is taken from you there will be ppl that don’t like that. If we had started out this way in the first place there would’ve been less drama. But would we have had the same amount of ppl playing? Who knows, ppl are going to comment saying that eve would’ve been dead a long time ago if they would’ve started with a blackout and they’re right, it would’ve been dead when there were more unoccupied systems. You’re just seeing the backlash of changes. It’ll pass in time. Groups will adapt. Most ppl are enjoying it. A lot of opinions don’t make it to reddit because ppl have lives or are busy actually playing the game. I don’t know, we’ll see
---
"Titans represent so many examples of an era of EVE Online that needs to end" *makes more titan skins* :surprisedpikachu:
---
Can confirm
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/59265830/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/59265830/)  (that's me getting rekt)
---
Also the phone also needs to be connected to the shady hotel wifi.
---
Unless you use mean using mobile data, but you can just open a hotspot with your phone and use that with your laptop, EVE works fine with mobile data.
---
Yeah its fucking terrible that he's enjoying the game in a ship he likes to use.
---
Dang was retribution really the last one? Thanks for the link btw
---
How many major evictions have you been involved with? Zero?
---
i mean it depends on what you are looking for in the video 
---
there are videos whose gameplay is just f1 monkeying but the editing is so on point to get the mood across that it becomes great, an amazing example of this is the original therabois(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSNZX9gdLlM&amp;t=463s) which is still for me one of if not the best eve video made, and it does that despite the actual pov fight footage being completely uninteresting. Other examples of these would be stuff like toddfa's vids(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiriXHQZy1YbGF7raSY2h1A), its pretty much just fleet f1(with some sabres sprinkled in) but he edits very well. Those are more of a music video than gameplay really, but that's not necessarily a negative.
---
there are those that try to tell a story around it, stuff like rnk's vids, fishbowl(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whr2NRIuJvs), some of olmeca's stuff(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whr2NRIuJvs), this iron armada compaign vid(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ezqt1_skrk) etc
---
there are those that focus on the gameplay/execution and make that the focus, that's where you're gonna find the more on grid skill intensive stuff generally, most of those are small gang/solo for obvious reasons. Guys like abkiller(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whr2NRIuJvs), nyth(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xiiGQJAd6U), lasker(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayeShhOTWzA), chessur(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6-Cks0M0kA), suitonia(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huYX2s28KLw), niko(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQ440kjs9w), etc.  A not solo/small gang example of these would be some of hk's dunk videos mostly due to the boxing(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZv7Km-4N1w)
---
there are also execution focused videos, where its about a specific setup working, or a plan coming to fruition. I fell like most of gulnar's videos would fall in this category(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZv7Km-4N1w) although he would easily fit into the previous one as well. A more straightforward example would be this gem from skillu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZv7Km-4N1w
---
it goes without saying that those are some very rough approximations only and the overlap is quite high,they're by no means mutually exclusive. And there's way more channels than I mentioned here, those were only the ones I had in mind.
---
Caracals, moas, thoraxes, minmatar destroyers... arty Nadia, brutixes... the list goes on.
---
I don't even know what point you're trying to make but it doesn't even matter.
---
Looking forward to watching this, been really enjoying your content, hope you keep it up!
---
ccp needs to make an official guide for new players, than just throwing them into running missions in hisec,
---
Ive had some friends try play the game, they all quit thinkjng that the whole game is just plain mission running...
---
You want to know why? Because there is no point in conflict, CCP took all the reasons to go to war, so that's all that people have left... and endless stream of hate towards CCP...

i dcd 7 times in x47, and just walked away from keyboard

And yet you felt the need to comment and reply.

Are you angry about something, things not going so well irl or something?

At least I have a house.

We Just did a corp meet up there it was alot of fun its got a different vibe then vegas but its got alot of the same party vibes

That site is for this mission chain https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Celestial_Imperative#The_Hapless_Thief_.281_of_2.29
---
How many evictions have you done without a staging POS?
---
Zero.
---
So how do you know they are totally required?
---
You can rent out parts of the convention center pretty easy, and the nightlife all around it is really decent as is the lodging.

someone at CCP is dipping gallente caps into ranc dressing, but the amaar one looks dope (that provi skin, phew)

You realize SniggWaffe is not PL right?

facts!

This active subs?
---
When nullsec got hit the wormholers came en made to tell off the “nullbears” about how they deserve no safety and made too much isk.
---
When wormholes get noticed for how much so few make with not many losses or danger they come in droves.  Read this comments of them desperately trying to defend it. 
---
You are carebears
---
Too little too late
---
Even counting the Loki, everything we had was collectively smaller and cheaper than that Rattlesnake. (Which was my point here; the cheaper and smaller ships won the day handily. Well, except for the Rattlesnake's friend the Jackdaw. He got 1-shotted. Incidentally, that fight also demonstrated [the fatal flaw](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/582326355199262721/609288957355753472/unknown.png) with large weapons.)
---
r/Eve subs
---
I have done an eviction out of an orca in a system that was completely moonlocked. It was awful and gives the defender such a huge advantage. The defender doesn't need more advantages, is everyone's point.
---
What’s the end goal besides making edgy hunters less discontent?  Seriously.
---
“more risk!” for what?  if the goal is more random risk just have ships randomly explode if you don’t want it to be preventable.  
---
It’s why i asked, “super safe space” is a fallacy.  Anyone can shoot you in null with any size ship.  Period.
---
Since Eve has always been willing to embrace third party aids, I've often wondered why they do not have a noob corp certification process and then push new players to join one of them. I think if you look a retention of players in noob friendly corps versus noob players solo, the corp retention will be much higher. Many games have an incentive to joining a guild because they know it helps retention, Eve should do the same.
---
I laugh, because one of my random alts gets emails sent to their account weekly. But I've never received any from my accounts that are 10 years old..
---
It's been really eye opening to see how much more difficult even such an 'easy' game as WoW was back in 2004. I quit wow years ago,  found eve etc... but classic has been great fun, my old crew from 10 yrs ago are running together for at least a few weeks. The game feels very alive and interactive.
---
When local chat existed, you appear in local when exiting a WH into nullsec.. did you forget already?
---
the problem with #1 is it doesnt actually add anything to the game. people arent going to stop closing Whs as long as mechanics make it the optimal way to do things. in many cases rolling wormholes is HOW we find our content. Making it harder to find content will end poorly.  No one wants to lose a ship to RNG mass calculations, it adds no meaningful decision making, and its just ship loss for rng reason. If the primary concern is the ability to close up a system there are way better ways to do it. such as
---
1. making your static always open, so rolling it does nothing, the next one opens right away
---
2. Massing a wormhole also cuts away at it's lifetime, so trying to turtle up with crit holes means theyll just roll shortly after anyways
---
your #2 I fully support, and will be brought up in the WH session next week.
---
Are you fucking stupid? Do you not see how Dave stark low key flexes his BJJ skills in this sub? He's gunna break your fucking neck. Rip my dude
---
This is something I wouldn't be opposed to.
---
Let me speak in smaller words for you since you think clinically retarded means not blindly following like a sheep
---
1) botting is still a thing you’re a fool if you think otherwise, this hurt the casual player 10000x more than bots
---
2) “more dangerrr” is a buzzword akin to me saying “remove cloaks because more danger” and nothing else.  It’s , in your oh so keen words, “retarded”
---
3)What the fuck is “balance”?  Making it so small scale hunters can shoot more shitty subcaps isn’t balance for anything other than feeding trolls.  It’s why i made this thread, and nobody has a fucking clue why any of these changes will be good or bad with logical points .  “the economy!” what do you WANT the economy to be or think this will do to it?  “The dangerrr” what do you WANT null to be danger wise?  
---
If your entire reply is “but pve ships got help making them too safe” you’re clinically retarddd and entitled to hell because you think a video game is only fair when your group can pubstomp someone with them not being ABLE to get help or else it “is too safe”
---
And if you aren’t, again as you said, “clinically retarded” you’d know i’m right in that all of this has been JUST to shake things up with no actual goals or changes in mind
---
Oh you mean that kind of farming, yeh it’s risky because you literally place yourself in extreme risk lmao, by the way that isn’t by any means the primary way people in whs farm, there is literally not enough holes to support that compared to how many live in whs.
---
I thought it would have a cooler skin...
---
i wonder where your *assumptions* come from
---
just chiming in that this looks pretty cool. I am not 100% i have a need for it, but it is awesome still the same
---
Irrelevant to the topic. You argued that pod eyes do the same thing as NEAR2. They do not, as they do not have omnipresent intel on the entire system. Only whats on gates. I stated that if you come in via wormhole, they have no clue, same as if you just never leave system. they have no way to determine if you logged off or are just cloaked and waiting.
---
Cloaky camping isnt something i do, but other people will camp bots (we already have topics on reddit from the past week of people figuring out when bots start ratting again when they dont see you jump out), the pod eyes are not as effective as free local intel. Which is why i stated there is a gray area now that can be exploited.
---
Christ man. You really really really like your safe space. Just move to High sec my dude and be done with it. 
---
I don’t think it’s worth getting this upset.
---
What happened in 2016?
---
Drekavac fleets are a thing I see; and then apart from that I've seen special purpose Sleipnir and Machariel fleets, and I know several Command Ship pilots who bring a few Damnations or Claymores as support ships. But yeah, out here in J-Space you don't really see a lot of stuff larger than cruisers either. T1 BCs want to be good but they just don't quite put out, T1 battleships are usually way too slow and just crush wormholes, T2 battleships don't fit into fleets at all, and T2 BCs are good ships but they're expensive and the skill train is really annoying. So yeah, most of the good fleet combat is either fleets made of Faction/T2/T3 Cruisers, T3Ds, or assault frigates.
---
The one big exception to this is the Leshak-Bhaalgorn-Nestor megadeathballs, because really there's damn near nothing that can contest those except even bigger Leshak-Bhaalgorn-Nestor megadeathballs or Leshak-Apostle emplacements.
---
Delete the colour blue from the game.

---
That was the post. May 2018. You posted this when we had an active warning stickied to the sub that we are removing low effort memes, due to community request.
---
The way they describe this sub... I love how CCP is obviously in line with the behaviour of it's players.
---
It already did, and in some ways still is
---
People seem to think that big wars fix everything. They don’t realize that we’re still in the direct aftermath of the northern half of the war while the southern half is as hot as it’s been since UALX and is still heating up. If wars fixed everything the game would be in a amazing state right now
---
usually for reasons that are not clear to other parties.
---
I second this.  Just add wallet and the ability to place/manage orders and it will be perfect.
---
CCP never had control.  That's kinda the point of a sandbox game.
---
CCP devs only understand a very narrow slice of the game, because that's the part they play.  After the T20 incident there's been a massive reluctance of the devs to get involved in the major blocs when they play the game.  So they don't experience that part of the game and so they don't really have a good idea on how to design for it.
---
For example, Citadels are pretty well designed if everyone was in a mid-sized corp.  It's the massive manpower and resources of the blocs that make them work poorly.  We shouldn't be able to sprinkle them all over Frat space because we shouldn't be able to build them as easily as a mid-sized corp builds Rifters.  But we can, and it breaks the design for citadels, sovereignty as a whole, and null wars.
---
Theoretically, the CSM is supposed to bridge that, but the CSM has never really been trusted by the devs.
---
So they're bull-in-a-china-shop-ing through changes, with the results you'd expect from that technique.
---
you ain't catching wh ratting battleships cause they didn't pay attention to the sig window, only if they didn't pay attention to the sig window, dscan and somehow you got them scrammed. they'll just mjd out. A better solution to that would be the proposal to add more scrams to the high class sites.

^(Don't forget to tell your friends that EvE will die without lowsec gate to Stain.)
---
Holy shit, I keep telling again and again that RNG masses should only apply to wandering wormholes and not statics. I KNOW how you find content rage rolling statics. Hence they should be left as it is.
---
Yes, people wouldn't want to lose a ship to rng mass calculations. But it's either that or you leave crit holes open in your farm hole. Hence, increasing the risk while turbo-krabbing part.
---
So, Tribute being wiped off the map didn't achieve anything. What would the Imperium or the game gain from 3-4 more regions getting glassed because someone didn't want to fight?
---
Why would he use two devices when he can only use one?
---
Also some phones come with wifi protection, my samsung phone throws me a notification to turn it on if I connect to a open wifi network.
---
No need for propaganda when there is just 1 big blue donut ...
---
problem
---
why fight?  what incentive is there to a war?   resources?  controlled space?
---
war typically has a goal.  but in this case...there really isn't any reason.  all regions have all resources you need.   and more space to control isn't that beneficial right now, its just a chore to keep.
---
add to that citadel spam, reinforce, and tethers means any invasion will be a chore grind(blueball war) of endless citadel grind and then waiting for timer after timer.  which can easily be replaced with a free 3 days of fuel....
---
plus, with the titan/super proliferation and the ease of suicide fax mega rep.  its not exactly appealing to either side to get into fights where your gonna be outnumbered so badly that you know you'll lose. so why deploy?
---
ok, well other reasons wars start. political ideology.  take for example open space vs free space of the venal civil war.
---
...nope, the people with those grudges have all been burnt out, left, or buried the hatchet.   real grudges these days don't really exist as not many take the game as seriously in terms of rp.
---
in the end,  EVE is in a mix between a cold war,  and a utopian scenario(aka where everyone has what they need and no need ot conquer your neighbors to get more for yourself)
---
Homeworld MMORTS
---
No, the sad part is that you didn't give me your stuff.
---
One day CCP will remember the Moros is out there, just waiting for a good skin for once.
---
You stopped playing? That means you won EvE!
---
Yeah man, a lot of recent changes. With blackout, invasions, some ship rebalances, etc. I'm just coming back from a break for the summer. The changes are looking interesting. Glad that CCP is shaking things up. I think they are more confident to try new things with the new Pearl Abyss ownership. So much negativity on here, but personally I like that they are making aggressive changes.
---
What are with all of these absolute fuckwits thinking they understand the first thing about wormhole mechanics and asking for changes to wormholes that would make them \*safer\*

If wars were that fun, people would fight.
---
If there was a reason to fight - that couldn't be solved through cooperation, people would fight.
---
I don't think these online wars breathe as much life into the game as you think, and that should've been made obvious with the glassing of Tribute. The stakes aren't high enough.
---
Sorry let me reply in words you’ll appreciate

Get out of reddit and online forums and get back to your safe space where nobody asks you scary questions that prove you wrong :(

I am absolutely shocked by this revelation!

There's nothing like having a FC continuously yell at you asking why the boosh squad isn't booshing fighters when mods aren't cycling.

Last night i saw the game near 10,000 online players for. e first time in years, comms were empty, even the bloodthirsty roaming myrm and barge hunters were pretty inactive

Congrats everyone, we almost there

And before anyone mentions “the botterssss” they’re still subbed, they’re using even more accounts with the pod scout bullshit...

So yes.  The massive loss of people who played this game... was people who play this game

And that’s sad to me.  But it’s life

holy fuck mods removed that? i remember upvoting that because it's well known that the only thing that can eradicate goons is goons

Was the whole Microsoft rehabilitation wing utilized?
---
Yes I used to play on Windows server 2012. Worked fine as long as the components are up to spec. Not sure about ubuntu
---
As far as I know, Voice Attack is fine. I have a friend with poor use of his hands who relies on voice software to play Eve, which due to its low APM requirement is actually quite an accessible game for a disabled player.
---
Remote repair. The idea is that you can tank more by having your friend repair you too. A similar type of fits are “tinker”, where you have remote cap transfer on both ships, and use that to run local repair modules that use more cap than you’d normally be able to run. Feel free to pm me here or send an evemail to Razeleao if you have an other questions.

Show us on the Kikimora where the dinos touched you.

Players adapt to the situation given which reverts back to being on ccp. Please try again.
---
lol just blue the other half of eve and have epic ferox F1 fights against them
---
It was a purely singleplayer game with none of the player generated economies and content such as eve online. Look at the success of No man's sky as an example of what a more multiplayer focused vallyrie/second genesis mix could be like.
---
The best reply I've seen in a long time. +1
---
Dont forget your kin therm hardeners ;)
---
It really sounds like you are struggling with these changes my friend. Plenty of people here have given you some very constructive and reasonable answer. All of which you’ve chosen to ignore. 
---
I’d suggest either accepting that things are going to continue to change for a while, or maybe take a break for a bit. You seem overly invested in the wallet simulator version kind of gameplay.
---
And if you do take a break can i please have your stuff?
---
oh yea I am sure CCP is responsible for nullblock leaders being massive risk averse pussies
---
Only if the initial startup time on the app wasn't 5 minutes long. And mail would be fixed (mobile does not understand color/font and concert it to html
---
Most of the gameplay would be outside of large fleet battles i suspect. Smaller scale 1v1 or 2v1 ganks happen much more frequently on eve online currently and this asuch is where the majority of pvp for mercenaries will probably occur imo.
---
why unblue?   what reason would they have to fight? what incentive has CCP given to be hostile to eachother and fight eachother?
---
heck, what means has CCP given us to fight the Imperium with their massive supercap fleet.   any fight would be a near guarenteed suicide against them.
---
most people just waiting it out and hoping something changes(CCP)  or imperium falls apart internally(civil war....yeah not likely)
---
TAPI tried a stuka fleet on BBC

---
Wasn't Kenshin a Goons battle-cry in one of the recent wars in the North?
---
Has me yearning for a "Chaotic" failing of ALL in-game standings.
---
I agree but I my idea has been to implement "pop up" PvP sites that spawn randomly in systems and have randomized # of participants (1-3) and class (up to Battleship) and number of ships.
---
I.E. a site randomly pops up and is titled like 1v1 AF  or 2v2 Cruiser or  2v2 Frigate or 3v3 Destroyer etc etc etc.
---
Once the participants are both in the gate de-spawns, you can't warp out until all enemies are dead or you are - you get interrupted fights w/o the blob.  Or maybe if you die your pod cannot get out... cuts down on blinged pods.
---
If no one enters the site in 30 minutes the whole thing de-spawns and you have to wait for the next random PvP popup site.
---
So similar - but you don't need any abyssal filaments....  I'm sure my version needs some other tweaks like maybe a bit of extended invuln inside so the first ones in don't have an advantage (i.e. no beacon to sit on).
---
Classic F1 response from a spodbrain. 
---
Why do you think BBC is fighting Dead Co atm....to have fun....
---
Do you really want to see this community flip out? They go crazy over cyno vigils... imagine a game reset. Oh boy.
---
[No.](https://tenor.com/view/lotr-ring-no-isildur-lord-of-the-rings-gif-5743603)
---
Not sure but I'm certain it was yelled by them at least once when they flipped their structures and stole their Keepstar.
---
For c2 sites, you’ll be running the combat anomalies that don’t have to be scanned for the most part. There are also some combat data and relic sites that can be run, but those are harder. Gas sites and ore anomalies also have delayed spawns that can be run. You can look up all the sites either on [eve survival](https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=WormholeSpaceClass2)  or on this [spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/443mbj/rykkis_wormhole_spreadsheet_updated/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) . Make sure to know the triggers before doing a site. Feel free to pm me any questions or send an evemail to Razeleao.
---
On your final point, if there is sufficient diversity between the fighters and gun turrets the average console or pvp player will and should experience significant diversity in the ships or gun turrets they are required to pilot. The very best should be able to flawlessly transition between turrets and fighters regardless of the changes in recoil patterns, aimcone and dropoff. This would result in a higher merc score and therefore a naturally higher salary
---
Was thinking much the same.
---
2019 Eve is better than 2006-2008 Eve.
---
It's pretty sad that you just now realized that spending time with you family was more important than getting a fat wallet in a videogame. Better late than never I guess.
---
ok, that isn't exactly a big conflict.  thats minor.
---
if we want to look at small conflicts. we could look at content roams any day.
---
if we looking for large scale combat between the large powers of eve.   the only one we have is Test vs frat.....and nothing much newsworthy has come out of that lately. 
---
so why should test unblue imperium?  they got frat to content roam against.   and no point to expansion
---
thats like saying that i shouldt be put into jail because i shot someone. the gun manufacturer should be sentenced for it.
---
Yonis, CCP made them put in a keepstar in perimeter so they could make ISK and then agree upon having fake fights in nullsec
---
You will likely have issues getting up to date graphics drivers working on Windows server.
---
Do something about it then instead of waiting for someone else.
---
Yes... but  as said, you will want non integrated graphics which means a more expensive board.
---
I have a custom server i built years ago for game testing, works wonders for eve :)
---
Kenshin is a solid corporation.
---
They might just add that lowersec gate just before they turn off the servers.
---
yep, you're right, mods are shit because your trash meme was removed and that's why eve is dying.
---
Eve, at its core, is brilliant. The constant 'balancing' ruined the immersion. Back when I played the player base waited for divine intervention from the developers, rather than accepting that such an expansive game is inevitably going to get aspects that are like this.
---
CCP giving into the complainers bred a bad culture destined to fail. The community is both their strength and weakness which they never seemed to get under control.
---
Fraternity is always fighting honourable.
---
Ah yes minor conflict
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30003686/201908201200/

GOTG can no longer access the full microsoft arsenal, so maybe?
---
There simply wouldn't be a community at all. It'd be like 3 people per system, including Jita, and you'd never see another capsuleer ever again.
---
Looks like Darkness just lost the entire Microsoft arsenal.
---
I mean... your answer is the classic "grr spodbrain ft monkey" response.  
---
Think about what he asked you. What reason do they have to not be blue? What mechanic or incentive is in game to make it enticing to attack each other?
---
On their way to Init from what i have heard.
---
Be aware it seems that you will only get a key if you signed up stating you were in a Nordic Australian or New Zealand region
---
Do you want to skill into a Hulk?
---
They were one of the most active corps in Darkness
---
lets subtract the cost of the titans that got refunded by CCP after...
---
would you like to do the math?
---
also, what actual impact has that fight had?   content roam, or actual meaningful event that has a noticable effect on soverenty or alliance stability.
---
.....looks like content roam funded by CCP's refund.
---
* cries in 4-years-old smartphone *
---
Well i see it more as a wipe but with 2019 stuff ;).
---
To generate content? Pretty simple lol
---
3... 2... 1...
---
I think they would offer it up as another option like WoW did. Not just reset everything.
---
First time using a burst projector. How the hell do these things work? Every time I fire at a location, I'm miles off. LOL
---
I know who's gonna get awox hazed then.
---
Like 90% of their AUTZ.
---
Arent they basically Darkness? What's really left?
---
Nope, all the things that are stacking that could be at work here
---
* Faction point with very good abyssal roll    
---
* Ship with highest point range bonus (Arazu/Lachesis)    
---
* Overheat    
---
* Maxed out interdiction maneuvers on the highest bonused ship (Command Ship) with a mindlink
---
* Possible huge overload bonus in a Red Giant WH (though from that number all the above prior to this could reach that range)
---
So.... shooting frat fleet is bad content. Shooting Dino fleet is good content. Is there a manual that you can show me?
---
what an absolute mad lad, 2 vanqs in a month and an AT ship the month before
---
Oh really? That's too bad
---
This is so funny... although i think about FRT botting and it's not so funny really.
---
God damn it you beat me to it lol
---
I have reservations for the ability to manage orders out of the game to be honest.
---
Well ... don't be poor?
---
\+1
---
Unblue each other and then people won't complain about not having anything to do and grrrr CCP. Gives you a reason to use your ships and find content in any system/region. I am a nobody in this game but I tend to find a decent amount of USTZ content in USTZ since everyone hates us. It is awesome.
---
Almost every post you make is negative Nancy Debbie downer with a side of snide snipe. I challenge you to be upbeat and encouraging for a month of reddit postings. Are you strong enough and brave enough to do it?!?
---
Why not create an alliance and call it "Null Bashers". Invite everyone to join it and collectively mob them untill they submit and disband.
---
Idk if this is about botting or a big ass credit card
---
Its a copypasta my friend.
---
The people shooting Frat in this fleet appear to have had something to do. So, again- as long as they have people to shoot, what incentive is there to unblue?
---
I'm wanted by Amarr, cause I did too many missions where I kill them (I guess).
---
If I travel in Amarr space, I always get a warning message that I'm wanted. But I can still dock and travel fine. I think I got popped once by guards, after being AFK after jumping into an Amarr owned system. 
---
Q1: If I don't go afk, and have relatively fast ships (BS and lower) will it always be ok to travel in Amarr space?
---
Q2: Will I always be allowed to dock into Amarr owned Space stations?
---
Q3: What should I do to start and try to restore the rep status for Amarr? I would guess that Agents aren't allowing giving me missions due to the low rep with them. Right?
---
\+1 crab/crybaby gone !   
---
Win/win situation :)
---
It’s literally the same guy that lost the Vanquisher time, the same fucking dude that lost the Tiamat. My guy has the most expensive E-Peen.
---
You would have to bot for a real long fucking time.
---
Probably gets paid a lot or lives at home still.
---
Kinda worrisome either way?
---
Is 252b a reasonable amount for the hull as shown on zkill?
---
Yeah sure how many bucks is a trillion isk again? I RLY doubt we see a creditcardwarrior here but hey I can't prove it.
---
A Eve reset is a bad idea, everything the game is to me is tied up to my character, had he not been intact after a decade long break I would not have started Eve again.
---
Eve Echos is your reset if you truly want one, if they make it for iOS and Android there’s nothing stopping them from publishing as a desktop app stores for Win/Mac, so maybe you can play that.
---
third time's a charm?
---
&gt; lets subtract the cost of the titans that got refunded by CCP after...
---
Oh     
---
My     
---
God     
---
He actually believed CCP refunded any of those titan losses. -_-
---
Fleet invite scores another kill?
---
Think about it this way, he's driving PLEX prices waaaay down
---
People are killing the game, and they all are desperate for a carrot to chase after. Unfortunately people want to be validated and not just have fun. That's what's killing the game, it's playerbase.
---
I unsubbed about a month ago. Who wants some free shit when it comes out of asset safety?
---
look who´s talking
---
check yourself.
---
also again, what impact did this battle have on sov holding or alliance stability.
---
if none, then its a content roam.  no real impact.
---
&gt;And they require less effort cause you dont need a subcap fleet for defense purposes.
---
Yeah they are super tanked low effort high dps ships that can tackle using fighters. And they are cheaper than faction/pirate battleships. Really annoying to deal with in subcaps unless you have large'ish fleet. Or fit your ship in certain way which make you vulnerable to blobbing. Lately I've been dropped 90% of time when roaming anywhere in null. It gets really boring.
---
There have been occasional rich irl players who have funded entire alliances by rmt. I'm almost positive this dude is just a whale. Vanq liquidity going way up.
---
That's not true at all, you are just reading my comments in the "buaahhh CCP nerfed my isk printing game buuuaaahh" threads.
---
And if you don't like it don't read it vOv
---
I'm absolutely positive I can be a better and upstanding member of the reddit community as well. I'm not entirely unaware of the humor in me making that statement. I'm also keenly aware that I have an almost automatic downvote level of friendship with the wormhole community.
---
Its a cool idea for sure, only thing is if its random it would be too limiting I would think. You have to be roaming through space and randomly come upon this site, AND you need to have the proper ship already AND you need someone else to also be roaming through space AND they also need to be in the proper ship types. It seems like super restrictive faction warfare that is in random locations.  
---
I just don't see the stars aligning often enough for those to actually work. Whole benefit of the abyssal proving grounds is players know exactly where to go to get a fight and can get one quickly.

I think it would answer your own question...to fight and destroy everyone's structures. I am quite confused on why you think blue donut is a good thing, not having blues gives you alot of options to fight

Not as much as that Lumpy pilot that seems to be being paid to post.. at least that's the volume of responses he has going out... My comment is tongue in cheek, but also somewhat spot on.

RMT or Botting it's the same in my books. I rly doubt he bought plex to found those three ships so y'know. Again he might have done that it's not impossible just very unlikely in my books.
---
We just burned down all of Tribute. Half of reddit is telling us we had no fun doing it and the other half is telling us to unblue everyone and go bash structures.
---
You can see the consternation, right?
---
whats wrong with this guy?
---
Yep there goes most of our AUTZ and over half of our active FC's
---
TIL that not every single Goku/Stuka fleet results in a dunk. More at 11.
---
See I thought it was lightning fast compared to some App. Even my S6 which is a few years out of date boots the app in like 30 seconds.
---
Then dont join them, action taken, problem addressed.
---
They dont make you do anything, you have to do things yourself.
---
If the enemy has supers
---
You might want to farm up at least dreads.
---
Imagine if someone had the energy olmecca has for frig warfare but to put this together to make literally tens of thousands of dreads as a group and just nuked as many supers and titans as possible with nonstop baits and cit reinforcements 
---
I can dream... Effort like that is gone
---
People predicted that EVE will die before shield slaves will be implemented and it looks like they were correct.
---
I mean are you surprised? Doesn't matter how much isk he brings to the table, someone that fucking stupid is not worth keeping around.
---
Literally the worst
---
I mean... some people decide not to RMT with their botting empire and just buy a trillion isk in ships. Right?
---
Classic WoW is not super wildly popular, the launch was just fucking hyped. Also CCP has no reason to restart/rerelease another version of EvE. Go play EvE Echos if you want that feeling. 
---
EvE will in no way benefit from it.
---
The only reason I am playing Eve to this day is because of salty videos with people raging at each other.
---
But yeah, fleet vids especially with no comms or narrator explaining what is going on are painful to watch.
---
oh xcuse me I decided to avoid a post with such a garbage title lmao
---
anyway brb relogging
---
Iirc titans/structures and maybe supers have their risk value based on current build cost but idk for sure
---
I don't know how he makes his isk, but definitely don't underestimate those chinese credit cards.
---
So what would be the point of it if everything wasn't reset?
---
Skull queue from phone would have been extraordinarily helpful a few years ago. PI app would be fucking awesome! I'd also like official fitting (saving fits, pulling from only modules you own), maybe market trading? Hell, just let me at eve on my phone.
---
If he pays for it all out of pocket the only thing it hurts is the zkill pride
---
Fuck zkill it’s a cancer to eve
---
&gt; Thank you CCP for your great effort to kill this game, you will indeed succeed someday. I'm not bitter...
---
lol okay
---
That number is after 30 days. You may have noticed that the number of logged in players is not growing. So even if you actually think that retention is high, it is not sustaining the game.
---
Nope, gating while there was a huge entosis battle raging 5 jumps away.
---
Close to 1%  (0.7) of the players that have bought into Star Citizen have already died which would be around 8000 people who paid but will never see the release and every year it isn't released another 1000 fans will die before seeing it go live.
---
[Source](http://www.bandolier.org.uk/booth/Risk/dyingage.html)
---
Honest question here could you even use a chinese credit card to pay for plex with the whole regional lock China loves to enforce on everything or would the illegal RMT sites be the only way?
---
What we need are random daily wormholes with no time or mass limits that connect all null space constellations across New Eden. 
---
No longer doesn't matter if your neighbors are blue.
---
It shows him at over 900bil in losses but at rank 25 of losers and the top 10 is mainly counted from the kda ratio is there a way to get a top 25 in isk lost? i dont want to shame the guy its his life he can do what he wants but to be the first one to break a tril in losses is somewhat of an achievement.
---
Can you board it tho
---
&gt; Test would have been slaughtered by PL if the imperium hasn't stepped in.
---
TEST is almost 9 times the size of PL, on what planet would PL alone be able to take on TEST?
---
I got honor 6 2 years old and the initial loading gets stuck to 49% and it really takes 3-5min to start
---
I have no issue what you did, the north just cowarded out. Not my fault that Goons have most Titans and supers in game
---
Oh fuck I remember this: Brave was wormhole diving in cobalt edge when we found a Nyx in deep tether just sitting there looking all lonely and not Exploded. To make a long story short though: Legacy, Combat Wombat, Iron Armada and Bombers Bar didn’t have the combined autism to bump that bitch of tether
---
So yes technically right, however there is also the argument to be made that the vanq could be going to someone who won’t feed it stupidly and could actually use it for its intended purpose in a null bloc titan fleet.
---
I’m not actually sure if it’s much better than a normal Erebus, and am purely speculating a “not hurt the zkill stats” reason
---
It completely killed the momentum of the battle that was happening at the same time. Someone who kills moral is not worth keeping.
---
Why does anyone put bounties on anyone when the bounty system is pretty much useless?
---
Microsoft arsenal
---
Steam makes it super easy to install and play Eve on Ubuntu, and it works really well.
---
Most people who where excited bout wow are back to their normal games. Not worth
---
zkill pride is all most of null have though, to the point where entire alliances refuse to let you krab in that alliance and force your alts into a renter alliance so you don't make the KB 'look bad' if you die.
---
At least they undock.
---
How long ago have your played this? I bought it a long time ago and couldn't really play because of stability. After the release it was pretty good for me. (and became better after I obtained an nVidia instead of an Athlon GPU.)
---
And you’d have to put every point into industry and mining to get ahead.
---
It would take months for the galaxy wide production chain to satiate and T2 ships/caps/stations even hitting the market.
---
As always I suggest Null exploration to make Isk.
---
With 2 you could have a cloaked PvP ship lying in wait in case the hacker gets attacked (assuming you have the cloak skills).
---
Or use a bait ship that's disguised as an explorer.
---
With missions or combat sites I would suggest one of you has a tanky ship to land first and take all of the NPC aggression before the second ships land with more focus on damage.
---
good effort tho :D
---
You sound angry, OP
---
I mean as someone who has spent time there, I can tell you there are definitely ways of getting money out. But I don't know enough to answer your question. He could have bought plex, RMT'd or just have 40 rorqs, they are all possibilities.
---
that doesnt change that #1 is still a abd idea. RNG based ship loss will do nothing besides frustrate people.
---
Get fked.
---
Until recently, that "harshness" was partially caused by wardecs on new players resulting in a retention rate that so low I don't believe they actually stated a number.
---
That being said, I'm not sure what your point is. 4% retention does not appear to be able to sustain the game. If people don't complain, it seems nothing gets done. Forum rage might be the only effective weapon against CCP.
---
Into the deep blue donut, go GOTG will.
---
230b in Delve so 252b sounds right.
---
Hm, a Chinese Radakos
---
Based on that lossmail looks like we did too.
---
&gt; I think they would offer it up as another option like WoW did. Not just reset everything.
---
There's a zero percent chance of them splitting the community with another server.  Likewise for a reset.
---
WoW classic is attractive to people who want to indulge in some nostalgia and relive past experiences.
---
This "Eve Classic pls???" idiot fuckery is solely the domain of people laboring under the delusion that maybe, just maybe, if Eve were reset, they'd have an opportunity to be relevant this time around.
---
My shits are usually solid , doesnt mean anyone will want them.
---
Dinos will blue everyone/everything they could.
---
Gotta love the name of his ship though. Lol

“Try and kill me this time Test”

Dynamic Rats... ruin the NPC game in sectors with high player population.

in terms of capital and super capital power.

otherwise, why else did Test call in the Imperium to save them?

indeed I heard a great suggestion that you only get to see dropped mods and the destroyed are unknown... that would help a bit...

what's the difference between Stuka bomber fleets and Goku bomber fleets?

I liked using this reasoning when I sent through my suicide ganking phase.

Someone would complain about how he wasn't doing anything to bother me, so why did I tank him? I'd quote a classic Godfather line and explain how him fauceting isk indirectly made my isk less valuable... so I mean, he was really just asking for it.
---
with the new 5g that is coming out next year... I wonder how effective projecting my desktop to my phone will be?

Never was my intention and I seriously try to avoid going there... but well, he decided to use it as an argument here, so I feel like my comment wasn't out of line as a response to that.

They had some corp theft happen. Some fellas doxxed the corp thief, but comms were released of the aftermath and some nerd said he had "the entire Microsoft arsenal" at his disposal and wanted to use it on the thief.

---
Eve reddit wouldn't actually be the target of something like this. This is where a lot of the raving madmen that have made eve their life live ;). It would be for the rest of the people. 
---
Which would really upset the eve reddit crowd since there wouldn't be newbs to blow up, scam, and force to do awkward positions for small amounts of isk.
---
&gt;Video games are in a horrible state generally for me with all the fortnite clones, call of duty 19: roof sliding insta combat, etc. Such a shame that the people who made this game great are abandoning it.
---
This is the very reason I still play eve, this is the only game that keeps feeling like a challenge after years of playing.
---
Something many people don't understand is that eve players, in reddit specifically, are NOT the majority of the players, thus, many "popular" opinions are biased towards the benefit of big nullblocks, just take a look at any goon reply on a hiseccer or wormholer, they just try to shut people up telling hisec is crap while having a Hisec incursion alt themselves to make isk or a c3 farmhole because they're too bored mining spod under their umbrella... bunch of hypocrites.
---
First time reddit user here! I have to say, i love that Sankey Plot! cheers

Lol, trade corpses with your friends: Corpse Collector “Catch ‘em, trade’em with your friends. Collect all of New Eden!”

I can't sue you for something I enjoy doing myself...

smh at everyone joining fucking goons or test, not like they have enough right?
---
I would say it was the most tone-def skin release CCP ever did, but then I remembered that they released the Empryean Dragon skin on Chinese New Year, during the time the Chinese were migrating from Serenity to Tranquility, and it was only released for the VNI...
---
If you start making it so statics are always open, people are going to leave wormhole space.

It also makes evictions a lot harder. Maintaining hole control would be next to impossible, part of that is to make sure people cant get any reinforcements in. It would lead to people rolling the hole repeatedly and burning out very quickly. The only people who have the desire (are anal enough) to do something like that would be the russians I reckon.
---
It would also lead to a decline in people site running simply because they can just go to Null to a super umbrella group with great intel channels or Incursions / Abyssal sites in hisec.
---
Who is anyone that want it?
---
Imperium was glassing tribute 2 month ago. Panfam didnt show up.
---
Something something adapt or die.
---
I think in the past PL would have been a threat to Test. These days though, not so much.
---
what about ANZA? (LUL)
---
Gotta quit the game in style I guess
---
I am totally agree with it. Let WH be DT to DT with mass limit only to allow dread + carrier max.
---
Jazz music intensifies
---
You’re an idiot, you can’t even respond to questions and just get into anecdotal deflection 
---
People have yet to address the “why” or end goal beyond ad hominem fallacies
---
I’d suggest stepping back from your bias.  Set down the kool aid
---
You might be able to think for yourself and look at consequences... or that might be me putting you above your statiOn
---
Either way, consider my questions, see how nobody has real answers or specifics... and move on, even if that means quitting eve if that’s what you have to do bro.  
---
Good luck
---
FC, what is jump drive?
---
This is simmingly annecdotical but it's one of the core issues to understanding the sore state of the game.
---
Lmao, priceless.
---
How do jammer strengths and sensor strengths interact? Is it the same as warp core strength and scram strength?
---
looks to me he's bumping the big guy
---
This is a really good post for people who are looking for casual content outside the bloc, tryhard wh sperg, and highsec solo life.
---
Killing Vanqs is a huge morale boost to the enemy though. You get something bright and shiny like that, it gets everyone re-invested and staves off burnout.
---
Wars in Eve last until one side gets tired of fighting. Giving the other side big wins means they'll stick around longer, which means you're more likely to lose.
---
If you want me to discuss strategic value 
---
It doesn’t have the firepower of 4-5 titans which is generally equates to the cost of.  So it’s strictly a trophy item of wealth.
---
They aren’t used beyond that because n+1 is always better with small differences in power and large differences in cost (it’s why we use faction mods instead of officer mods in super fleet metas)
---
So.  Feed or not feed, it’s not cost efficient, and yes... No alliance would SRP it or “give it” to a pilot for strategic use, so it’s a personal asset value wise beyond being a titan that can be utilized.
---
They just need a covert jf which has a slightly larger capacity then a DST.
---
Yeah I'm into it as long as my skillpoints are mirrored from tranquility every month like the test server
---
Joke stealer.
---
Did WoW when it started, the now "classic" is just nostalgy hype, and in about 2-3 month more dead then eve ever called on reddit. maybe 1-2 server then left.
---
I’m absolutely loving all the changes at the moment. Why would I quit? 
---
For the first time in ages the game feels like it’s got some semblance of balance.
---
Yeah that is what matters isn't it huh, good thing we have easily accessible statistics to show the drop has been substantial over a short period that goes well above the standard decline.
---
I'm sure snuff batphoned init goons and their fxr gay boys to come help too
---
So when do we see a corp called Darkness joining RR?
---
Hahahahahahajajajajajajahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
---
Supers are obsolete now, CCP just send everyone who has a Super 30 bill and call it good
---
Probably got recruited by one of those SARD mobile depot adverts in HS.
---
Because they have no other source of content
---
interbus moros best moros
---
That was me in 2007. I thought it was a mining/building game like Minecraft and quit after 1 week.
---
I came back once I realised that was not the case.
---
Which one?
---
I’m going to assume it’s this one 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78691017/

it is one guy
---
I feel like we've skipped WWA
---
The enemy of my enemy is my friend?
---
All fun and games until your kid is playing candy crush on your phone and buys 12 billion in capital skills on your PI alt.    
---
Just sayin.
---
Porque?
---
"on 3, kensheeeeen"
---
From vily: "I was camping the system which was the only unjammed system around, so it was obvious where cynos would go up. A cyno got popped on the gate and the vanquisher came through - the sad thing is my HIC was the only tackle around so if he would have shot it he may have gotten out"
---
So he was trying to gate into staging while both sites had a max CTA, with legacy supers and dreads in range because there was a jammer up
---
People have jobs now. The harder they make it for non goons to farm isk the less interest anyone has in building up against goons.
---
Nobody cares anymore. I log in to watch intel channels for a few minutes of nothing is around I'm out. If its the weekend I spend a few minutes to find some moons about to be popped and park sabres on them ask cloaked until rorquals show up and ping a drek fleet to wh over for a quick dunk and log off.
---
Who actually wants to have a 8 hour f1 battle in max tidi and 5k+ in local
---
Killmails used to be the opposite. You could only see the destroyed shit.
---
It was lame.
---
Or do project discovery, that would be awesome. I’d get a marshal on all my alts In less than a month from playing at work
---
Why change whs. Biggest isk/risk imbalance is T5 Abyssal in hisec. Are you a null guy asking for changes to space you don't use?
---
What you mention will fuck with pvp. We don't need any pvp inhibitors right now. We need reliable connectivit to each other to keep Zkill hamsters skinny.
---
That would be 50% of the people here so far.
---
Unless there's a better mitigation for 0.01 isk undercutting in place. You'll just have to he on 23/7 to check that your orders are still okay because people will be monitoring theirs a lot more than before.
---
As long as my rorqual hunting isn't made difficult I'm happy with anything that causes others to not play the game.
---
/s
---
Yah but veteran legendary delve FC lorenzo in particular
---
they got visa or mastercard logos on their cards
---
RLML Caracals. They're cheap and highly effective.
---
Won't happen:
---
TiDi means only Titans effectively work in very large scale battles. GoonInit Titans outnumber RestOfEve Titans by some margin. No one wants to risk their titans without an overwhelming advantage (except Goons maybe since they can replace them all quickly).
---
Nothing about botting or rmt. He is just a crazy rich asian.
---
i thought all the subs radakos lost were actually caspers
---
I love your deal, great write up, a lot more people are quietly doing what you do and are enjoying themselves in game.
---
I feel you a lot on the recent chaos changes, mostly not affecting me I’m a fan of the null blackout because I like roaming null for relic/data, but I get in and out via WH.
---
&gt;As always CCP isn't killing EVE, the players are.
---
It's true.  Developers can't be blamed for not anticipating that players will optimize the fuck out of the game to the exception of fun and/or notice that it's been happening forever.
---
Ho hum, I guess CCP should just find a whole new playerbase that behaves differently.
---
Classic subhuman response
---
It only confirms that Faction police will hunt me. Doesn't seem to answer the questions I have, unless I read it wrong. Perhaps a little bit about repairing the low Standing I have with them, by running missions with rats that Amarr would hate I think. Perhaps other factions would offer missions which contains rats Amarr hate?
---
Today i learned that Non invasion pacts and neutral third party = blue.
---
MER makes the crabs loco
---
Couple more chaos's and we should be able to reach 5000-7000 online. 
---
Got my fingers crossed here boys
---
It doesn’t even prevent ratting. Folks will just start rolling with alphas.
---
If you stick around for even a minimal amount of time, it becomes very apparent that the "next step" in the game is joining a Corp. I was ready to join up after my first month or two. I even upgraded to omega. Spent the next 2 months trying to get into any group that peaked my interest (basically, anything but one of the blocs), but lost interest in the game before heading back from anyone.
---
Just sayin, you can have multiple accounts or a 'guest' account on your phone that will help you avoid this situation. You maybe don't need 8 bil on a PI alt either?
---
From what I have heard and read CCP does what they want despite what the null blocks say. The big things you all complain about: excavators, citadel spam, cap proliferation were all things the null members of the CSM warned them about. CCP did it anyway, and the blame lies solely on them.
---
trench warfare and mustard gas? i think we already had that in eve
---
Nope, just tired of people like you on the internet. Have fun acting tough.
---
Don't let the door kick you on the way out
---
Who could have seen this happening though. It's not CCP fault that something completely unforeseeable could result from drastic improvements to one play style at the expense of all others.
---
Thera and eve-scout would probably be useful for you.
---
Not spaceship games but definitely there in the hardcore, I can lose everything category. Especially Rust.
---
Nice weite up Joey and glad you enjoy that style.  Do you base from one location or go where the WHs take you?
---
We've got a backup plan for if CCP removes standings. Nothing will change on our end.
---
" Eve Echos is your reset if you truly want one, if they make it for iOS  and Android there’s nothing stopping them from publishing as a desktop  app stores for Win/Mac, so maybe you can play that. "
---
Like how they made Dust 514 for PC ?
---
Yeah I remember them being nicer. I recently bought a new sub for 3 month. 2 days before the Season Of Skills event where they gave you 3 month MCT for free if you subbed for 3 months.
---
So I opened a ticket asking them if they can extend the deal to me because I bought the sub less then 2 days before and they said no. In the past they would have extended the deal.
---
It's kind of sad because most companies will usually extend a deal they have if you bought a qualifying item within 48 hours. And I know CCP used to do it before. Guess they got a bit greedy since then. I even wrote that to them in the feedback email (not the part about them being greedy). But they never responded to my feedback.
---
Still a shitty idea. Eve isnt the game that can afford splitting the entire playerbase
---
He is not a nobody, he is a ceo and an fc.
---
then you should also know that intel on map and dotlan give also information how many npc's got killed and jumps where taken in that system etc. so the hunter knows where his target is while the hunted dont know when the hunter will strike. so the hunter don't have to hunt actually :P
---
are you an olmeca gold alt? your arguments and logic trys sound like him.
---
or just get rid of KM all together?
---
I understand you don't and - honestly - I probably won't use it much, but I now have that ability where I didn't before and might use it. It's also faster to change chars than log in multiple characters from what I have seen.
---
I dont think many eviction crews rely on the static being unopened, they mass it and backstop it, that use case would be unaffected.  
---
Assuming you meant people would leave Wh space from a farming perspective, its possible. But you wont find the isk/hr anywhere else. WH pve is the safest in eve, so I think changes to fix that are both necessary, and probably coming.
---
Lol 300b
---
Krab corps go to the safest krablands.
---
you can also buy tags and turn them into the Amarr in order to quickly gain standing. Costs some isk, but it can fix it.
---
The PS3 was unique to develop for, and hard to port to x86, Echos has already been developed for mobile cross platform, dropping it on the desktop app stores is trivial by comparison.
---
yes
---
If you align fit a porpoise you get the same effect with a lot bigger ore hold and boosts.  Then again it's also 3 times the cost, but the porpoise warp really fast and has a cloak
---
Never heard of that. Sounds like an alliance I wouldn’t want to be in.
---
&gt; in terms of capital and super capital power.
---
What timespan are we talking here?
---
Changing my static or mass limitations does nothing but make me safer and only a minor annoyance. Zero fucks given.
---
Neither do most people on the internet,  anyway. You do you and enjoy your mission pancake. :)
---
It is very close to EVE circa 2010

Lineage 2 private servers for a lifespan of 2 or more years of the server, rust for a couple months persistance but very dynamical gameplay.

&gt; It's not about the zkill, It's about the liability of what you're throwing to save his ass every time he fucks up.
---
Make resources scarce. For starters, remove half the systems from the game.
---
Before the hellcamp made pl turn into a ghost
---
Its not even that. Both Goons and TEST have no incentive to fight each other.  If Goons invaded TEST both sides would eat enough collective shit that Panfam would have the most supers in the game making neither side better off since it puts PL/NC in prime position to call their banners and raze whats left. Its literally them choosing mutual survival over mutually assured destruction.
---
Why would someone care that a dipshit lost his big dumb toy? Losing morale over that is silly.
---
Good Job putting a giant target on our heads dumbo. Expect to receive an evemail detailing your punishment for making a reddit post without the approval leadership.
---
Your right! Human phycology is NOT something a game designer should need to contend with! Stop being people, people!  Why would you folks act the same as folks in the real world! This is insane...no it's not insane! Do things against your own interest! Do not optimize anything! 
---
Stop playing the way you will play and play in the abstract way the dev thought you should!
---
wait hisec and lowsec and parts of nullsec die in your argument cause test and goons don'T do an all out war and you think this a argument of any sort?
---
test and goons went to war in fountain but after test recovered and helped to evict goons from deklein some pl/nc. and horde overlords decided to fuck test and co2 . Common Enemys = Enemy of my Enemy is my friend right? Thats why Test and Goons have a NIP it suits them both and is their counter vs Pandafam.
---
What kills the game truly is CCP with 0 Investment in the game since years, when you don't reinvest in your product you can't compete with the future products of other companys SIMPLE LOGIC. CCP don't invest manpower and money into the game since "forever" 4 devs or so work on eve for some small changes thats it. While they invested 10 times that numbers on devs for other projects and still do. All they do for eve and the Community is lip service, WITHOUT A BLOWJOB.
---
TEST alliance has faction super/titan SRP, just not at the full rate. We get SRPed at the rate of whatever an equivalent non-faction super/titan would be. For instance, Komodos get SRPed at Levi rates. We certainly wouldnt SRP any sort of cap/super/titan, regardless of faction/regular, if the dude was being a moron like this though.
---
As opposed to now, where you have to be on 23/7 to check that your orders are still okay, because bots are always monitoring theirs.
---
that guy has probably another vanquisher some rich china dude.
---
Maybe only ccp knows
---
still lolling at this sub crying bloody murder that goons wanted regional data out of the MER when it turned out to be one of our best recruitment tools
---
Would be super useful for alpha alts.
---
Skill tweaking disabled in alpha - facepalm
---
Running on Manjaro now, used to us Ubuntu, there is a lutris script for it
---
What hellcamp? UALX?
---
Well, there are still real people - I want to believe? - having real sell orders and working or sleeping that can't update every minutes. 
---
I feel the sell order system has shown it's limits and it's needs to fix the 0.01 issue
---
Relevant like haulie? Judge was a big promoter of eve classic.
---
Need a Komodo next time
---
i like Kenshin Uesugi not that this corp has anything in common with that legendary daimyo.
---
Ah nice. Those would need to be Amarr tags I guess? I got shittone of those.
---
What will it matter? Only your coalition is blue to you anyway. Despite all these morons who think a NIP is equivalent to setting someone blue.
---
At this point, I am all in favor of this kind of content. If people play Eve and suffer meaningful loss on TQ, that’s fine by me. I’m unlikely to ever engage in this sort of activity, but that’s because I play a different style of Eve. If this turns out to be wildly popular and thousands of people are participating in 3v3 tournaments on TQ and blowing up ships, then that suits me just fine.
---
goons civil war is when mittens balls hit each other when he jogs!
---
94 bots plus one vanguisher pilot? In another post there were alleged pings saying the pilot was going to get kicked. Could this be how the person afforded to whelp those ships (one AT and two vanquishers) in two months?
---
/s kinda. I hope I am wrong. Maybe.
---
1000 billion, when Plex was 1.8b for 500, would have been 555 lots of 500.
---
That's £8325
---
Absolutely do I believe there are people spending this much money on video games.
---
If I came across as pissing on this feature; I apologize, I didn’t mean to. I just didn’t see the use for it. If you find it useful, I’m completely wrong and I’m glad you find it a useful feature.
---
One person was (-94)??? Ban incoming for botting when?
---
You have no clue about this game, "not much else"
---
Plex is RMT too, yano
---
Yes. We mocked them endlessly with 3..2..1 Kenshin! I forgot why by now, wuz fun though.
---
And running the raids in classic back when there were no guides and addons were primitive was actually pretty hard. Learning BWL with no guides at all for it was pretty rough.
---
Thanks! Just base out of Stacmon but often get trapped in random corners of the universe behind closing wormholes and have to find my way back
---
actually that ccp neglected to do anything beside low effort low cost stuff for years made most people more bitter. I mean cmon isnt it obvious we pay them, we play this game and they do nothing with the money or devtime in return. They just sit there and spend that money for other projects.
---
the organization that's running it is the difference.
---
I didn't think so. I've installed the app and have yet to change my skills on it. No harms done here!
---
Fantastic!!! This is called real emergent gameplay; you're using the sandbox properly!
---
Find your own fun and go for it.
---
If you get tired of it, feel free to reach out to other wh groups. Some may not require comms etc.
---
Sounds like you made a shitpost
---
Some of us have a new home now thanks to the tribute glassing, thank you very much.
---
Content on Sisi doesn’t result in meaningful loss on the only server that matters. 
---
I used to be opposed to “arenas”, but I have come to realize it is a way to get more people involved on TQ. As long as all the things happen on TQ, it’s still part of the Eve universe. I don’t need to be able to grief these people for it to be good content.
---
Almost every games sub is like this really. You need to find a sub sub like r/feedthebeast for Minecraft, summonerschool for league, etc to get any useful information. We have fittings? Lol.     
---
I will say I'm having a great time doing stuff with my new Corp. Not part of an alliance. :) Most of the buzz in game I've been picking up from other high sec, lowsec, and wh corps is excitement for the changes that are coming. The chance nullsec will return to bring the wild west it used to be had brought a lot of old timers back.
---
you need to turn on your tactical overlay. without it, you're just pissing in the wind.
---
Damn, ill have to wait till i get my note10 on sat
---
How is it P2W?
---
It will not, you have a crit hole in front of you and you **decide** to take the risk to go in hoping it will survive for the return trip. You **decided** to take the plunge knowing fully well the consequences and **knowing** that you always had the option to leave the hole crit. 
---
Again reminding you that this only applies to wandering wormholes and not static connections which you can rage roll indefinitely. Wormhole people seem so fixated on that.

What play style are you talking about
---
I can't see Kenshin joining us or TAPI.
---
Awesome story. Always fun reading different peoples playstyles and wayd to enjoy the game.  No one playstyle is for everyone
---
also pl/nc actually alienated test out of their alliance. all the stagnation is pl/nc. fault after world war bee. They killed off co2 and test space in the north etc.
---
It's not a 'narrative.' FRT shot to one of the top all time botter alliances within the span of a year. They're way heavier with bots than anyone else, at least when stats were last released. That's also not at all why Legacy is fighting them, so there's not much point in driving it as a narrative.
---
Hope the next one is named "What're you gonna do, drop me?"
---
there are bad posts, then there is this.
---
It's probably better to do chaotic darks
---
Its a rich Chinese guy botter, I was in a small gang and went to the staging system through a wormhole to his old corp, asked the Chinese guys in local politely to feed us, which they did. 
---
\&gt; where is treenewribbons?  
---
\&gt; come fight  
---
\&gt; Chinese guy: on my way.  
---
\&gt; gf
---
He means they will succeed at killing it, I think.
---
Edgelord confirmed.
---
If alliances had a reason to want/need to grab more territory, we might. As it stands, we both have all the space we need to prosper. Why take more? To satisfy your desire to see your betters duke it out? Sorry, but we don't play Eve so that you can have fun.
---
Don't feel bad I made a rokh mission runner just for shits and giggles. It's actually pretty fun and I needed a sniper for something else anyway :)
---
It doesn't matter which botters did more than the other, they are all shit. XiX for YEARS ran a botting empire but FRT gets the hammer because they are botters? Who cares if its FRT, XiX or anyone else. It's  just a bad idea to start talking about botting when you support it or agents that do.
---
Giving out my secrets.....

LOL, are you dumb? Test and Goons aren't blue!

And hunters will come back in droves if they know you're easy targets.
---
You're just reading it wrong. The "Gaming Skill" part is the skill required to continue playing after a set amount of time. So after a few weeks of playing Eve to continue you'd need high skill, if not you quit (die). In WoW after a few weeks you require very little gaming skill to continue.
---
Well that was low effort, wasn't it?
---
Edgelord confirmed
---
No ship so big in EVE that it can’t be destroyed.
---
Also, if zkill is your reason for being in EVE I don’t know what to tell you.
---
/*I do know what to tell you*
---
This feels like they are going to annouce bigger alpba at gfleet
---
Alpha rollers in praxes will be used to overcome any mass instability issues that ccp introduces.
---
The only way to make ratting scarier is by changing disruptors to scrams and delaying when incoming sigs show up on your probe windows.
---
The only counter argument I've heard is that some weaker groups will roll their static away from more powerful wh groups without even being discovered.
---
However, the flip side is that those groups weren't going to give more powerful groups a fight anyways and my proposed change will give greater gank abilities to actually active PvP wh groups. 
---
That is, PvP groups don't need to worry because this will allow them to find content and get the gank on before the other side warps off.
---
Would someone be kind and provide a libretto to this Space Opera? Somewhat lost on who, why, what, etc. is happening.
---
Well, sugar will feed and grow malignant tissue. So there is that.
---
I didn’t even consider this. Shit, here’s an upvote. Great idea!
---
Hes chinese
---
lowsec gate for stain is so easy to do and still even that ccp neglected to actually code into the game :P. So many stuff hinted at with lip service so many real money earned by CCP to spend on other projects and so few devs who actually work on eve. Its a joke that this company even now don't approach us with more than lipservice and give us faith in them be hiring people and show us the EVE ONLY DEV TEAMS they create now to give us content and rework stuff. All those devs who spoke out years ago where booted...
---
The Enemy gains morale because their members joined a fleet and bagged a Vanquisher, then bagged another one a month later. This encourages enemy pilots to join fleets because of the lure of getting yet another Vanquisher kill.
---
Cool, spent my Eve youth based in the HS island and surrounding area of Solitude, so was able to enjoy HS/LS/NS all within a few jumps but we had to be fairly self sufficient in the same way which was fun.
---
The guy's entire loss value of ~980billion isk comes almost squarely even to the amount of 280,000 PLEX 
---
That's about half of the sell orders in all four trade hubs combined. Hard to believe CCP would miss that kind of RMT so more than likely the guy bought ~18 of the 15,400 PLEX options ($499.99USD each) from ccp over the span of his sad career.
---
For those of you curious, that's $8,999.81 total or or ¥64,299 yuan...not too unrealistic for a crazy rich aisan looking for an easy trillion
---
Isk for brains
---
Yeah sounds weird must be some small elite pvp alliance
---
So eve appears even more dead?
---
Buff your mom.
---
Yeah it doesnt take into account the cost of the BPC which is where the price spike happens.
---
I think this is a rich and crazy BIG ASS SPY, relying on spending $1,600 to reverse the TEST morale.
---
I know, I've had an alt watching him since he was dumb enough to get fleet warped to our Astra. Knew it was just a matter of time before we got him again but man am I ever disappointed to be at work when it happened :-(
---
They can join my alliance. Friendship Alliance : )
---
I meant it as in new things, not activities in general; he is a returning player not a newbro. Please stop being so fucking stupid.
---
He has a big fat wallet irl and a carefree attitude. I don't see anything wrong with that. We need more people like him. ;)
---
I liked the videos of siege green as they allways wrote what was happening for people that don't know.
---
That's because any time you try to do something outside of sov null, the blocs go all scorched-earth on your ass and snuff you out within days.  The goal is to eventually extinguish all hope of making a go of it on your own and force you into joining a bloc.  Brilliant strategy, but totally strangling the game.  That has way more to do with the currently-awful new player retention rate than "steep learning curve" or other stupid excuses like that.
---
Yep. Back when PL still had an ego and more caps
---
Does it still have pvp fatigue?  And Greyscale?
---
Maybe I should add more smilies?
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
It should be posted in your screen right after you finish the tutorial "WE AT CCP GAMES SUGGEST YOU FIND A SMALL PLAYER CORP TO START OUT".  
---
Finding a nice little group and playing this game while chatting on discord is hella fun. There is a ton of content to do. We do incursions, complexes, wormholes, hunt gankers, even mining (well, only after considerable alcohol has been consumed does my group mine lol).     
---
But I returned twice before and didn't renew my sub because I was bored. Last 2 times I joined big blocs though with to many people to really get close with anyone.       
---
Who your playing with makes ALL the difference. I already added a 3 month sub now because I'm having a blast smashing beers with my Corpmates and doing whatever together after work.
---
I too hope that condoms stop all std's
---
Considering the largest pack you can buy officially is 15400 plex for $499/£409 1 Trill is now around $8991 US / £7374 UK.
---
Paging Frank the Bank. Did he have cloths and Plex in his cargo hold?
---
&gt;I dont think many eviction crews rely on the static being unopened, they mass it and backstop it, that use case would be unaffected. 
---
Your second point literally argues against your own point that you're trying to make here though...
---
&gt;Massing a wormhole also cuts away at it's lifetime, so trying to turtle up with crit holes means theyll just roll shortly after anyways
---
&gt; Assuming you meant people would leave Wh space from a farming perspective, its possible. But you wont find the isk/hr anywhere else.

We don't want people leaving wormhole space, it's barren enough as it is.  
---
I do agree that changes need to happen. But hindering several styles of play simply to spice things up and causing people to leave is not my idea of benefiting WH space as a whole.
---
Make more random connections. Make it so that there's more holes in your chain. If the chain is still dead you can still roll it with ease and find content elsewhere.  
---
Add scrams to ALL sites to make it so that there is more risk involved if a hole rolls in. Make it so that MJD bullshitships can't run C5 and C6 sites in groups of 2s and 3s.   
---
Make it so that Caps have to be on grid if you want the drifter to spawn. And they have to be within 50km of the beacon so they can't just warp in at 400km and warp off again.
---
Upvote!
---
Man I miss pink guy...
---
Asking the hard hitting questions.
---
Don't let the crap on the sub get to you. The null blocs aren't the most important part of the game, it's the hundreds of smaller groups that are actually playing the game and having fun that matter. The ones that don't care how many billions of isk per hour they are making in their caps. Believe me lots of people are just having fun and my Corp has a bunch of newbies that have gone Omega this last month alone.
---
Horde Will recruit him then?
---
Yeah, If they want to meet their originally stated goal of launch in 2019, they really need to get a move on! Though the game feels really polished as it is IMO. Some things are still NYI, like the help text for some screens. And drones aren't in yet. But the overall feel of the game is very nice.
---
yeah i just said, veteran legendary delve FC lorenzo.
---
sorry i dont recognize your authority in fort M-OEE8.
---
&gt;The stakes aren't high enough.
---
This is the core of the problem. There's no stakes anymore. All the big null-blocs have loads of anoms to mine/rat in, and there's no reason to expand.
---
The guy also does abysals in hawks, sure hes legit made the isk
---
You forgot to add "can't kill each other's supers and rorqs"
---
FUCK delete this we don't need fury road nerfed any harder
---
I assume you're not aware of anti-cap warfare with bombers. 20 bombers with booshers and logi support are enough to kill dreads specially when it's completely capped out. 10 people in leshaks and t3c can also melt dreads. Watch some videos on how it's done. And you can land focussed bombs easily- Cloak &gt; position &gt; decloak &gt; bomb.
---
I actually beat you by a solid minute lmao
---
The dumb is strong in this one
---
WEEBS OUT
---
Ill say it again. We dont need an age of chaos, the chaos has been in us the entire time. No patch or mechanic change is gonna turn eve into a dangerous place. The players are the agents of chaos that eve needs to revive itself.
---
Porps are only 40m for the hull, covetors are 40m for both fit and hull.
---
Indeed same here. Living in null used to be chaos. CCPs plans to return chaos to null is what initially got me to check things out again.
---
To be fair, they are the only ships where you can actually see the skin.
---
weebs? since when this guy is a weeb? : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uesugi_Kenshin
---
What is a stuka fleet? I hear about them a lot but I dont knoe anything ither than that theyre bombers
---
"PandaFam"
---
Ohh, I like this. Def stealing it.
---
"Third Time's the Charm"
---
You board the ship, you tell them this is the best ship in EVE, watch them look at you as if you’re escaped from some place.
---
That day when the leshak is good at something that's not bashing a low power structure...
---
Yes, we should definitely unblue Goons to make it easier for PL to blue up with everyone else to evict us. Great idea, we'll get right on that.
---
You seem [full of horseshit](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78593679/)my dude.
---
Faction weapon gives more dps right?
---
Fitting window too to make fits out of game that load into your saved fits in game
---
EVE is in app purchases at their finest. Devs get lots of money, players get awesome kills. Everyone wins.
---
You understand it was SRPd right?
---
You would make him almost believe yourself LOL, how can stay frosty recruit such garbage.
---
Link to that active sticky?
---
And generally you'd just assume "low effort meme" from downvotes - otherwise it's just subjective. And considering the sub is currently a breeding ground for toxicity against the game, the subjective opinion of one lone mod when it rallies against any one well-upvoted post is.. well, I guess that's par for course. 
---
But tbh, if the mods actually had that as an excuse, it would have been given over modmail. I mean, I know myself how painful it is to actually have to put in the effort to respond to the community that you're supposedly representing, so generally if there's a "hey, look at this clear rule", I'd be more than happy to send that.
---
Instead of just ignoring one mail, and then later responding with a no-effort warning to not post it again.
---
From the recording that was released of their comms when they were talking about doxxing.
---
Nope
---
My point is that FRT isn't getting the hammer because of botters. They're getting the hammer because noraus is possibly the single most grr test dude in the entire South and openly recruited everyone who's ever shot test except Goons to try and evict us from Eso. This is continuation of the only feasible policy test can have against FRT. FRT's absurd levels of botting just add extra internet points when someone feels like bringing it up.
---
look at how long it takes to spool that much dumbass
---
I don’t usually point the finger at botting
---
But this guy dropped more than a trip in a month, if he isn’t a very old player... report his ass for whatever he’s doing
---
If the world sees my greatness on zkill they wont find out about my tiny little nerd-pecker, and that virginity thing!
---
Lol keep telling yourself that
---
I mean, historically it was mostly "we just wanna fight you" as well. Never really been an issue that i can think of where an alliance went on the offensive because they \*needed\* more space. It was bragging rights more than anything. Players have wanted since 2004 ish ways to make alliances, ways to build their own empires. They are really managing it now and people are mad about that. CCP gave us the tools to do stuff like this, they can't really take it away. Rather see new content or new things to help drive content.   
---
Bear in mind first alliances only could exist on paper as there simply wasn't an option, was all done with standings (and the entire south and east was 3 alliances when i joined in 2004)
---
It's not really they are afraid to fight each other, there is just no reason to fight each other.
---
Achieved the consolidation of Panfam, also unless it is now "renter" it would be kinda epic if the large blocs just agreed to leave some of the northern regions alone and let any small group do stuff there. Rental is just cancer though.
---
Whole thread will mock him, while he's probably had more shakes losing these than the rest of the nerds combined.
---
Zkill pride aside, when there is blood in the water the sharks will swarm.
---
That's right!! lol Thank You
---
Mastercard.... sometimes its just a CC warrior
---
Yeah but for faction titans squizz also has to work in the blueprint cost, which he usually does pretty well
---
LOL, your afraid of PL
---
Hahaha, I wish I had the skills to fly capitals. :P
---
I have... questions....
---
What was even tackling him? I saw one cruiser cyno, presumably the HIC. Was that it?!
---
Not at spec 5, at least.
---
&gt; eve-o forums are that way --&gt;
---
Half those retarded fucks live here now, have fun with that
---
Outside of changing skills I would wager that this is the second most popular request. I've seen this request foreverrrr. CCP?
---
Not broken until you prove me wrong on the killboard. 
---
It's a great ship but it comes with significant downsides.
---
If you have a dot at the end of your alliance/corp name, it means you're not baller.
---
Chromebook? I know they have the play store now and will be trying that next time I'm on my personal laptop
---
Post the ping or fuckoff
---
&gt;You don’t get it. I used an example from the past to point out one specific mechanic. Turret tracking and damage application which is unarguable. 
---
Turret tracking and damage application is unarguably trash on Battleships, yes. They had severely limited practical gun range and required an entire entourage of support vessels to make up for their vulnerability to torpedo boats, aircraft, submarines, and virtually everything else on the ocean.
---
&gt;You then pull that ship into the future change around the entire example and think you’ve debunked it. When, really, you just don’t get it.
---
I don't need to take the Iowa into the future, you can just look at the utter devastation battleship fleets suffered in WW2. The most heavily armed battleship on earth was sunk by torpedo bombers with [less than a dozen US aircraft lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ten-Go). The Bismarck was crippled by biplanes and beaten to death while it drifted about without steering. The HMS Prince of Wales was sunk with [just four Japanese aircraft lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse), and [half the Italian navy was destroyed by 21 biplanes that had a cruising speed slow enough to be legal on highways.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Taranto)
---
Battleships just aren't worth the expense when a literal small gang of aircraft can blow it to kingdom come in an instant. Or a Submarine. Or a volley of anti-ship missiles, now that those exist.
---
Literally any hotel is a shady hotel when it comes to wifi. Want some scary night reading? Look up the dark hotel attacks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DarkHotel

---
It's great for people who do a lot of traveling and don't always have the time to sit down and play. As a dirty casual I greatly appreciate this. :)
---
There is no problem shooting each other if you feel like it. If you ever think about botters and something not being funny, tapi might want to stop helping XiX.

Man just because it’s not the Mona Lisa doesn’t mean y’all gotta ban it. I know it’s easier to shake a stick and tell “get off my lawn” at those than it is to deal with this mindless bitching about people’s hangar spinning simulator changing, but damn. That post got a genuine chuckle out of me, which is more than I can say for all the dreary whinging that makes up this sub today.
---
These tears are delicious! Keep them coming.
---
Hm, the price must have gone up for a covetor then.  I remembered them being like 25-30m fully fit.either way, larger ship that's more expensive
---
Uh oh you spoke the forbidden knowledge
---
Goon here.. confirming was srp’d for rorq loss to Tapi.
---
Nice read! I'm in a very similar situation to you (outside if the game) and have been trying to come up with ways to get something "done" in short play times. Its no doubt difficult and you have to broaden what you're willing to do, can't just autistically camp wormholes for weeks until residents are tired of it.
---
Is it enjoy playing the game way that you enjoy it and don't worry what other people think? I bet that's what you'll tell them.
---
this is good content 10/10
---
must be vry small indeed, to the point of not existing anymore
---
Ok well hit me up this weekend to play!
---
Oh my god, yes. Make the nestor a Blops
---
I think the point is that PanFam really wants to just fight more than achieving ultimate supremacy... assuming they at least have a chance of winning those fights.
---
If the ships used to rat in wormholes only cost 100m, id be inclined to agree with you.  But as they're usually upwards of a bill and require more than 1 ship to run, not so much
---
&gt;Sure, thats why all the marketing campaigns are about HS miners and LS pirates right?
---
Believe it or not, people don't come to EVE just because they heard of a big battle and they want to press F1 in it while the game is playing at &lt;10% speed and people are crashing randomly. They come to eve because it is possible to do so many things; the battles are certainly a part of it but far from the only one. Player stories, and people like chance ravinne / wingspan TT have brought huge numbers of players to the game over the years.
---
Plus, as you pointed out, it's been a while since we had big fights, despite having players in large coalitions, with numbers of players and ships more capable of big fights than ever before... it's almost like the blackout is there for breaking up stagnation and lack of fighting.
---
&gt; But you are missing the other side here. You somehow think the nerfs to the economy is good but even CCP Rise said they have to start buffing it cause its a long term issue if it stays low
---
I'm not missing anything. You're clearly aware that this is not a long term solution, because the very same statement from CCP Rise that you mentioned states they can now start on directed buffs and changes thanks to the blackout doing what is is doing. It's a temporary solution but you seem to be playing it off as being permanent and it's "killing the game" so you want it gone. It's a terribly disingenuous to get what you want.
---
There's a lot of "other sides" in EVE, and you seem happy to just play all those off since only your playstyle seems to matter. Trying to present half-truth to give your opinion legitimacy doesn't really help. Nullsec PVE still exists, even if you opt not to consider it. It might not be in the best state long term, but it's not long term so give it time. Your apparently chosen gameplay was breaking the game for everyone else, it's not going to be the same again now that drastic measures have been needed to change things.
---
&gt;The blackout is ruining the economy, not fixing it. Anyone with any real knowledge about economy will tell you that.
---
Well that's just your own (selfish, IMO) opinion and has nothing to do with "any real knowledge about economy". The  economy has been out of whack for years due to the safe incomes. Anyone with "any real knowledge about economy" would tell you to not pass instant judgement (wait to see the *actual* long term changes) and especially not that the previous state of rampant overinflation and stagnation of everything in nullsec was better for the health of the game.
---
Tough now? It's weird how you seem to project your feelings onto others, what are you struggling with that you're angry and feel the need to try and toughen up? We can work through this together bro, don't give in to despair.
---

This is the bubble I have always wanted to find but haven't been able to!

Dunno if it will be good, but Second Galaxy is pretty much an EVE clone that - from what I can see is supposed to be cross platform mobile / PC . [https://secondgalaxy.zlongame.com/index\_en.html](https://secondgalaxy.zlongame.com/index_en.html)
---
Those 10% are not running the games economy, they are ruining it. There has been so much ISK printed by low effort afk ratting and botting that ISK is essentially worthless. And the turbo crabs running all the rorqs make it impossible for new players to make any decent profit mining unless they inject to a rorq.

Why fight tho? All space is claimed. All of it under the shadow of Mittens’ supercap hammer. Can’t take space without supers, can’t make supers without space.

10/10 quality posting

Still pretty sketchy
---
I used to base in Huvilma, a low/highsec constellation near Rens, in Heimatar. Its was great scanning the systems for anomalies; mapping the wormholes and 'day tripping' into the other communities around New Eden.

Bye bro.
---
Look at how long it takes for you to deal more damage than a non-implanted Leshak (which could be using another pirate implant set that will benefit you in a big way). Damage done over a period of time, not DPS.
---
I'm personally not remotely excited by that implant set, sticking with snakes/genos/etc. for Triglavian clones
---
Right but there is oil elsewhere but no one is proposing we annex canada
---
Yet
---
tbh I just didn't bother posting here again after that.
---
Eve was always "just a game" to me, so I enjoyed the sub for shitposts and other positive/fun things, rather than the endless complaints. I was happy enough with the above post doing well and getting people joking/laughing, but the mod who removed it didn't even bother to send a PM citing a rule had been broken or whatever.
---
I thought it was actually auto-spammed until I eventually got a modmail telling me not to post it again.
---
I wasn't much in the mood for deciding what I hated about eve the next day, so I didn't really have anything to post which followed the sub's rules ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Getting more people involved is easy. Just get all the solid good Pvpers that quit to come back. I don't care if these newer shitler players all leave. As an older player I'd never conceive of asking for instanced pvp. That's trash
---
Even with having slight velocity pyfa is showing pretty significant damage when applied to a stationary HIC. I'd like to see Vily's combat log on that HIC rofl.
---
This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their fort before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.

Perhaps you should take your own advice; stop being a coward and do something about it, if how others choose to spend their free time in an MMO bothers you so much.
---
Alternatively, you could choose the comedy option by doing nothing except posting something like this occasionally.
---
I don’t even play anymore tbh, and I’m mostly a member of this sub to remind me why not. There’s good people on Eve but there’s also just so much of this shit it’s just not worth it.
---
Well the dude self tackled himself when he lit the cyno and vily wouldnt be able to log off cuz he had to point him to prevent jumping the gate. 
---
There were 2 options for the vanq pilot: 1) shoot the HIC and warp out 2) light a cyno, self tackle yourself and hope they save him
---
Don't triglav get a bonus to smartbombs?
---
Your response is the best in the thread. The OP is looking for validation as you said, he's arguing with literally every answer that doesn't line up with his own point of view.
---
Pretty sure it is farms.
---
We seed Ihubs. Grind up indexes, then krabs come and harvest until someone kicks over the IHUB.
---
You can argue harvest season lasts too long or indexes go up too fast. You can argue its too hard for vikings to come take your moon profits. But at the end, we definitely have farms.
---
If you are looking for some adhoc NPSI style fleets, and can fly a bomber/recon, look into bomber's bar. They are a good bunch of dudes.
---
I'd actually encourage you to live in low if this is your playstyle. Easier access to PVP, and the wormholes are always there for easy logistics.
---
Find a corp that doesn't prioritize the killboard over having fun. Mine is one such corp, if you are indeed looking.
---
But seriously. Look into Bomber's Bar.
---
Why? - The guy is providing quality content for 100+ players multiple times per month. If anything you should donate isk to him so he can keep it up.
---
So what makes you think it would go differently **this** time, that would magically change Eve for the better?
---
*Squints*
---
Oh shit you're right, he lit a cyno. Didn't even jump in a personal FAX or anything. What a colossal doofus.
---
Was definitely a claim button for the second event. Can't remember on the first.
---
The issue is he doesn’t need isk donations and that seems shady af
---
There are a ton of relaxed lowsec pirate groups that do just this. Lots of people think lowsec is just FW, or empty space, but there is tons of isk to be made, and pew to be had, especially mad maxing down the chain.
---
How big was Brave again?
---
This is about as quality content as killing an untanked retriever.
---
&gt; Sadly Perpetuum is mostly dead.
---
Well he did say "games similar to eve" so...
---
I'm curious, what's the jcode of the wormhole you live in?
---
Prolly bait but hey, always take the bait. I'm interested
---
More of this crying about small groups?
---
My small group has been farming unencumbered since the blackout and we're richer than ever before. I wish more roams/gankers would come around towards us. If you actually fight and win consistently people will move their hunting grounds else where.
---
They never said that.
---
Whole point of thread is to point out the player base cries all the time about the game being dead but in reality they are the reason the gameplay is stale. 
---
And lol, you should think before you type since you don't know what I do in EVE for my fun lol.
---
EMO. Lmao.
---
Not every plan comes with tethering, plus service is usually shitty as hell when it comes to traveling.
---

Reminds me a lot of the amarr jubilee skins, those are fantastic.

I wonder why.....

Please do this and post the resulting lossmails here XD

Wouldn't be as bad if test wouldn't be on goon side too.
---
Welcome to Eve Online. One thing that is inevitable to get to know this game is online search. I prefer duckduckgo.com
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=does+race+matter+in+eve+online&amp;s=d&amp;t=w
---
No balls for sure ;)
---
&gt;You realize that TEST is actually on war with Winter, and Winter mobilized all of Panfam to defend them?
---
Lol "mobilized all of PanFam"...And by war you meaning phoning goons on all big timers to make sure you don't lose
---
Yes, they know what the problem is, has to do with Wine and the interface with a Mac. They had a solution, and it didn't work. Last I heard from them on the 9th.
---
there was no combat log he never shot the hic once.
---
in other words, my statements stand... it’s a trophy item.  Yes it can be srpd
---
at 1/5th the value as a regular titan, because there’s no strategic value in faction utilization for the cost compared to regular titans, which is why the SRP is set up this way (so the alliance doesn’t lose a titan to field, which is all that matters)
---
no horde doesnt let u feed lol
---
It started right after a Patch. There is no error, the launcher just doesn't work. The GM the first week after I sent them some files said that the new Wine Patch was missing the video information from my mac so its not starting the program. They gave me a solution, it didn't work, and they never responded after that, its been 20 days
---
Yup, colossal doofus confirmed. Great catch.
---
But why would anyone give a fuck about killing a vanquisher? Zkill stats? Whoopdeedoo who gives a shit. Its just xbox schievements all over again except you can pad your stats a lot easier in eve. 
---
Inb4 accusation my killboard is shit, my main pilot has 19 bil destroyed and 11 bil lost ,not that it matters. Just used to people thinking im some salty bad because I dont understand why people care about shit like that.
---
Oh I am?
---
The GM said the new Wine patch for Mac was missing the video card information. They told me to uncheck the 64bit option, delete the wine folder and start the launcher back up. It didn't work, 20 days later I have heard nothing from CCP
---
oh i don't disagree with you there.
---
i was hoping they'd call in horde for a rescue. and then there would be a big cap fight there as we fight for the field. would have been fun.
---
but no...instead we got a rather...weak end to what was a newsworthy hellcamp T.T  evil mechanics.
---
the only good part of it was BL's escape attempt being entertaining to watch.
---
Falcon....not sure how much he's being honest, and how much he's just saying what they tell him to say.  but everything defenitly isnt fine.
---
heres hoping they start listening to us rather than focusing on their own trig narrative,  and make wars and fights happen again
---
And the whales get rekt because whaling doesnt equate to skill in eve! We all win!
---
So you are saying someone is able to RMT or bot 1 trillion isk out and concentrate them onto a single account with frequent high profile loss without being banned. It’s either you or CCP security team being idiot.
---
honestly with rails i doubt he would have hit the HIC once the dreads jumped in from the bumps. But there was no other tackle.
---
Race doesnt really matter anymore. The absolute most you get out of picking a different race is like, a couple hours of very small skill. No biggie in any way. 
---
Caldari are my favorite race for any type of content, and they happen to be astoundingly good at PVE. Selectable damage types is very good.
---
No maybe yes
---
That's what I used to use in Provi to mine.  Its align was awesome and it could tank some dmg.  With blackout and ecm changes I'd have to revamp the fit though
---
2 Hours of trying to bump PepeHands
---
Or you could just roll it with a HIC....
---
It's pretty clear you have no idea what you are talking about and just want to nerf WH because null got one, what about all the buffs nullsec has had over the years? When do we get those?
---
Isn't it basically an inside joke circlejerk of a bunch of dudes who've been playing a long time
---
Nothing says "noob krabbing in here" like a crit hole, I don't want those rolling themselves before I can find them. Kthx.
---
Yes.
---
If you want to pump that much isk into the game, you could just start your own alliance. 0% tax with free hauling and SRP, who wouldn't join?
---
Fuck i hope no
---
Yeah, there was one with me too, but not on one day per event.
---
You don't have to care about zkill to want to kill expensive shit. Expensive shit, expensive loot
---
I believe that is still less than the cost of injecting to maxed skills.
---
It would probably take a revamp of game mechanics, or a relaunch/EvE 2.0.  EvE has a reputation at this point, and those who try it either get turned off by the UI/lack of structure most modern MMOs have, or they don't try because of the reputation for being a den villainy and spaceship sociopaths.
---
It would need to do something to get gamers who have more time to play, and are able to stream it to a wider audience.  Or maybe not, Warframe is huge and that game is 115% grind and boredom waiting for stuff to finish while hitting 4 every few seconds.
---
They could always find a spot in Tribute and join the mash-up that is there. We'll see i guess.
---
&gt;Whole point of thread is to point out the player base cries all the time about the game being dead but in reality they are the reason the gameplay is stale.
---
?
---
&gt;hah joke's on you, I was only *pretending* to be retarded
---
Oh, I see now.
---
&gt;And lol, you should think before you type since you don't know what I do in EVE for my fun lol.
---
What you do for fun literally has no bearing on the topic of discussion. 
---
I can understand you needing to flex after being emasculated though.
---
19b is nothing lmao
---
Strange because I am from The Netherlands but I have received a key. The thing is that I have a samsung galaxy S7 and I can't play. I am trying to extract the APK from a emulator but I have not found a emulator that can act as a supported phone.
---
"Gatecamping with..." 
---
"Cool dude..."
---
Cognitive dissonance much  ?
---
I think that's still fairly cheap as far as hobbies go.
---
FC, what is calculus?
---
I'm Baller then!! pfft I always knew that though. :P
---
You don't get that much isk or money being a moron. More like $3000 doesn't mean as much to him as it does to you.
---
Im not really sure what else you would call someone gating a vanquisher during a CTA
---
Just put inertial stabilisers in the lows. Then spam D-scan like it will cure your cancer. Once anything shows up, ~~scram~~ scram.
---
right now wasn't 10 PM last night which is in the US prime window when we were sitting at 18k online, when the game was averaging 22-26 thousand online back in 2006. By midnight, still a formerly popular time to play eve in the US we were down to under 17 thousand.  
---
 [https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility)
---
Warframe's core gameplay loop is fast-paced and stimulating which helps with streaming.
---
No the newer generation is far from the old generation of eve players attention span is to low.. to much fortnite
---
Unless they create another instance I can only see eve decline
---
After all the changes CCP has done skill Injectors, alphas etc numbers and retention have been poor.
---
I really think CCP need to stop with eve is hard rhetoric and scamming nonsense it's an outdated concept that deserves to be in the past.
---
That's why I was asking him to explain, but he just got defensive.
---
CCP investing in the eve again.           
---
Like Hilmar stated, over the years EVE made almost 1bilion in profits.        
---
This kind of profits compared to investment from CCP side into game itself look rly bad.         
---
Like sure we got 64bit client - but how many years after it should happen?              
---
I guess till October PA is obligated just to observe current CCP actions as they cannot force decisions while the bonus pay was not made.        
---
Maybe after October?
---
I think you are confusing null sec poor fit dreads with high class krabbing dreads, also when your bomber fleet decloaks the sleepers will start shooting them (and the dreads will pop the triggers) bombers don't tank sleepers too well logi or not.
---
" You argued that pod eyes do the same thing as NEAR2 "   
---
No I didn't, you decided the word "compensate" means "the same" which it doesn't, a pod on a gate isn't NEAR2, YET, but they will get better with it the longer they use pods in that fashion till it is nearly the same thing.
---
I sincerely doubt that... So far that seems to be the case, since I've not seen or heard on the forums CCP addressing the complains. :(
---
You said no alliance would SRP it and I said thats not entirely true. I agree with your statement that theres no strategic value in faction utilization for the cost compared to regular titans, with a slight exception for the Komodo. The Komodo is both the highest damage ship in the game AND the tankiest ship in the game, by far. DDing a Komodo in a fleet battle situation is basically wasting a DD volley. The fact that PL et. al. wasted one of their initial DD volleys on one of our Komodos in UALX allowed us to easily take the upper hand right off the bat in the titan trade. So I would argue that a Komodo has a strategic value, but maybe not one quiiiiite up to its cost. The rest of the faction supers/titans I agree with you 100%.
---
Am nub, both less than 8mil SP so no porp for a bit but that's the plan
---
wasn't it also a VR only game taking it out of the same market as no mans sky which can be played on a regular monitor without VR?
---
Never login again...
---
I remember back in 2004, calling and telling my roommate to go to my PC and change a skill... because I was stuck at work and there was no queue.
---
But they happen at completely random times and intervals. So how is a player supposed to log in and play when they want to?
---
I want PI changed, but also want mobile PI. Just management and make it an ACTIVE game on your phone. Pickup in-game only, etc.
---
Always wished PI was integrated into DUST and fought over, to make it more interesting. Secure a planet with the help of Dust Bunnies and get a higher return versus a planet in conflict.
---
What happens in October where PA can step in more was there some sort of no intervention deal made?
---
Sadly still not working on mine
---
This entire comment has literally nothing to do with my final point that console players are not going to want to play laggy battles for 12 hours at a time.
---
I'm sure WoW classic has absolutely nothing to do with that...
---
PA bought EVE for over 400milion, it is split into 2 payments.         
---
1st one was instant, 2nd one will be after october if specific goals are reached.
---
That’s like a million years vs any subcap hull
---
( ˘ ³˘)❤
---
You call me a coward yet you have zero idea what I do for gameplay? So if your flair is true you shouldn't use the word "coward". And who said I wasn't retarded?
---
Every other week their is a post blaming CCP for low server population. But in my opinion it is the players fault because everyone is blue with NIPs and risk adverse.
---
LIES
---
I hear it a lot better. I played a bit after some patches and had a fair share of fun. 
---
I have high hopes for the upcoming DLC to be honest. X4, in my opinion, won't have any competition when they get the bugs polished and small issues taken care of
---
I mean CCP is killing industry and news worthy events. The Eve in this video no longer exist.
---
dude, just give hilmar a little more time. In two months he took the game from the 2007 numbers of around 34 thousand to the pre-2006 numbers of 22-26 thousand, another few months and he'll have them down to 5 thousand no problem.
---
hence it is a bad alternative model to the slow trickle.
---
!remindme 48 hours
---
I just got off discord with a corp-mate. He is new to nullsec and doesn’t have a lot of isk. I want the ability to contract him a Thanatos so that he can have fun getting it blown up.
---
Naah
---
When someone becomes a capsuleer, is their original body fitted with the connectors that enable them to command a ship in a pod or are they first cloned and is it the clone that gets the connectors?
---
Gits a probability, let's say that you have a radar sensor strength of 2, and your radar jammer has a strength of 1. Then every cycle of the jammer has a 50% chance of successfully jamming you.
---
So it should be CONCORC, CONCORM, CONCOOPREC, COCAREC, COCARED.
---
My new fave is COCandREC
---
Do you really think any alliance that can successfully hold space can't find one person to hop on the keepstar gunner's seat and DD the attacking fleet to hell?  Cyno Jammers are so absurdly broken in favor of the defender and are just another reason that Titans are getting printed without dying.    
---
BuT tHiNk Of ThE lItTlE GuY!1!    If you can't afford a 2b structure how the hell can you afford to hold space in null?
---
On the other hand I noticed that all the alt tabbing out from eve between warps or to check the alts or an intel tool made me used to focusing for only for a short time. In Fortnite you can't really look away from the game if you don't want the other guy in a dino costume to dance on your corpse very soon.
---
Does anyone know the "rules" for D-scanner making the "chirping" noise? It seems to chirp when a new object is scanned, but I'm having trouble determining which objects trigger the chirp. It seems that player ships, diamond rats, structures, and probes result in a chirp sound.
---
Similarly, does anyone know the "rules" for when D-scanner shows the silhouette of a player ship inside the solar system map window? It seems like the silhouette is only shown the first time that ship is found on D-scan.
---
Does anyone know what I'm talking about, or am I a dumb dumb?
---
42
---
I wanted to remember it like it was before Addons and made it two whole days before I threw in the towel and installed Questie.
---
No, wars in eve last until ccp introduces stupid new mechanics that force the attackers to head home to defend against pve attacks...
---
&gt;You saved me from having to pull my laptop out on shady hotel wifi just to play around with skills.
---
You don't use a VPN on public networks? Ballsy...
---
Lets mention the Tiamat also.
---
Yeah, probably done that for the twenty thousand chinese people joining TQ
---
Still like it though, SP = yay
---
Is there somewhere to download all of the Eve-related music?
---
Noob question. Is it normal for a Titan to fit omni tank or is this a noob fit? He has both shield and armor tank mods in there...
---
Are you trying to compare brave and tapi?
---
They are scanned in to a clone, which has the connectors already. The original body is killed.
---
FREE healthcare? In your own words...
---
&gt;Lmao this isn't how it works.
---
If you want to buy more than 500 PLEX, CCP has a helpful contact link on the plex page for such transactions.  You can get a better deal than the $500 one if you're spending a lot more than $500.
---
I and my corporation remain in eve online since 2017. We keep recruiting Alpha members monthly.
---
Im pretty sure they didn't like me before....
---
&gt;And despite the orange buffoon we're saddled with at the moment
---
Speak for yourself, guy. Trump is the greatest President in America's history. Turn off CNN.
---
There's a link on the plex page to contact them if you'd like to buy packs larger than the $500 one.
---
Best copypasta.
---
Do the alphas ever pay and go Omega or do they fade away before they are done the first month?
---
cap use. so kinda?
---
Is there a smartbomb fit to that ship?
---
Proc + Porpoise
---
Well if travelling by freighter you will notice a drifters on gates ... you will need a new freighter now.
---
Wow, isn’t this his second Vanquisher that dies?
---
Nah it likely won't. CCP is hellbent on alienating more of its veteran eve players rather than drawing them back in and there is simply not enough kids interested in investing the time planning and money into a game like eve.
---
 This generation is all about fast paced quick stimulation so they can hit their bong while the next map loads.
---
You wanted CHAOS?! FINE! No Vegas!
---
Fed 2 vanq's in 1 month, near the same gate.
---
Impressive
---
Yeah I think I'm pretty damned screwed hah
---
So what you are saying is you pulled that number out of your ass? Got it.
---
&gt;luckily i don't live in a third world country and haven't been subjected to the ravings of that orange buffoon you call president.
---
Enjoy losing your country to an onslaught of heathen illegals. Third world America will be here, behind our wall, ready to clean up your mess.
---
&gt;Stop being cowards and unblue each other.
---
for what reason?
---
Ty for positive/useful content!
---
i'm going to be straight up honest here.
---
the best feature of 2019 was the unselect all button on the redeeming queue window.
---
Well Eve should have never been allowed to have 20,000 man alliances. Why should your average logged in be equal to the numbers of these coalitions? 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
Nothing of value was lost....... You can scuttle the entire alliance and STILL nothing of value would be lost. 🙄
---
yo sweet game, thanks for making me download 1.3 gigs just to tell me it's locked behind a password, ffs.
---
Another instance/robot/classic/2.0 will not save Eve, it has a cult following, but is a hard game to play, and a hard game to maintain the server for.
---
We have to accept that Eve is a very niche game, very drawn out, micromanaging, time, and sometimes socially demanding.
---
Even regular players are dependent on wikis, and a dozen other sites or their own spreadsheets for figuring out costs, profit, ROI in everything you do.
---
CCP is right to seek out the new server framework with Aether, if they can optimize the game server side and get it to run on scaleable off the shelf platforms, it will free them up from a ton of effort and cost, it’s probably the biggest deal for them right now, and I hope they succeed.
---
They are also right to cash in on the mobile market, if you don’t want to play, don’t, but if it makes money, then it is helping Eve and everyone should be stoked.
---
So, we may never get as many players ever again, a better question is how few players are needed to maintain profitability for CCP?
---
-quote from man dropped
---
nice ty
---
What do you think, how many more vanquishers do he have after 2016-2019 botting?
---
19b? You been playing for how long? Half a year?
---
OMG that's hilarious. Can you please show me a pic/link?
---
Yes, I think the game has plenty of life left. 
---
It's been the same idiots proclaiming the death of Eve on Reddit since I joined. Often literally the same people, and they've been wrong every day since 2003.
---
Keep in mind that the game didn't peak until something like 7-10 years after it was first released. Most games are long dead by that point. I wouldn't be remotely surprised if the right combination of good updates and weak competition give it another good spike before the servers turn off for good. But CCP needs to rehire the community team and bolster the marketing department to make that happen, and they've shown no interest in doing that, so we'll see. 
---
&gt; With how old the game is i figure the people who wanted to play have done so
---
I've played with several people who weren't even born when Eve came out. New ~suckers~ capsuleers are born every day.
---
All the times I’ve used PayPal it less then 2minutes
---
The eve is hard, scamming, and backstabbing is vital to what it is.
---
I saw that capture of everyone lining up for some spawn or whatever in WoW classic, everyone was like “that’s so wholesome”.
---
Ewww, I wouldn’t want that unless I could kill as many of them as possible and fight for the loot myself, scam or buy myself to the front of the line, or just pay someone that doesn’t know better to do it for me, that’s what you get with eve Eve.
---
No ita absolutely not it's a very very outdated thinking that no longer wanted nor required
---
So please leave the game we dont need that thinking anymore.
---
Solid! procurers have a fastest align of the barges and great tank especially when paired with a logo ship or porpoise.
---
&gt; horde overlords decided to fuck test and co2
---
you know that's a straight up lie right?
---
its fascinating what line members believe
---
Yeah that’s why a lot of people that play fortnite are playing multiple instances of the game at once
---
Noob fit
---
Totally this. 
---
“Load and go” if you know you can’t win what is warping to you (dscan).
---
“Stay and play” if you have procurers and a porpoise. Just make sure they are fitted for mining and engagements. If fitted correctly, they will be able to force a t3 cruiser off the field. 
---
I prefer bailing but sometimes... I just want to see if I can win.
---
You know when people refer to RMT they usualy don't mean the legal type. Neither was I here.
---
Is this a new implant set? What does it do?
---
For those wondering what the downsides are...
---
* very squishy
---
* susceptible to cap warfare
---
* without cap its even squishier
---
* brawler, very slow, very low range
---
* long spool up
---
You'd have to hard tackle something then warpin from a ping to get on top of them in this. If you're fighting a kiting ship and you hard tackle them 50km off the shak its gonna be ages before its in range
---
Eve has more moments of down time than any other game I’ve ever played. Are you a carebear that never travels or something?
---
I'm realistic about how that would play out. Especially given that it's already been tried once.
---
So no, if you want us to unblue Goons you'll need to give us a reason better than our partnership being unfair to you. Because brother, IDGAF. That's called "karma".
---
I've used it for mining and afk structure grinds, works pretty well, takes a bit to get used to
---
I haven't played since before the tether mechanics were introduced, but I've seem people dock their ships into citadels. Is there a reason why you'd AFK a ship tethered instead of docking?
---
it's thirty something m/s on a slicer actually, which works out to less than 1% extra speed. it's not going anywhere.
---
throw in all the best possible conditions, and you'll maybe squeeze 200 m/s over 10k. the list of compromises you make over quad-lif on the other hand: around 5% higher sig (talking ceptors), worse mwd sustainability, cpu/pg, and you also get to pay someone 4m isk for it.
---
i know in eve chasing the last few percents can make a difference, t2 mwd is not one of them.
---
So what your saying is that you were booty blasted by old PL so many times they fled to the other side of the universe and everything you do is at some level dictated by that PTSD
---
in the same month
---
Even if you had you wouldn't like every time there is a conflict system in about a month there is some diplo solution worked out. 
---
the reality is none of the big blocs want to fight regardless of the incentive. 
---
Like there have been conflict drivers every time the happen within 2/3 months some Diplo solution is found where all of null benefits, rather then 1 side taking advantage of the conflict.
---
Eh. The one guy with a mobile depot is happy, everyone else gets jack shit. Not that worth
---
Yeah i know. I dont care about KB stats at all. But last time i tried to say Zkill stats were worthless I got people say "lol isk negative loooool" so I wanted to get in front of that
---
I don’t feel alienated, that’s on you and your playstyle being unsustainable, for you to be unable to accept change is YOUR problem.
---
  “Kids” don’t play games like Eve, they don’t want to grind, and don’t the cash for Omega. late teens and up do, it’s about accessibility, being able to plan things out, and the fact that Eve is really a mature game.
---
I don’t know how old you are, I’m in my 30s with work and a family, so I ain’t exactly young, and I hate using age to assume people’s position on stuff, but what kind of salty person are you to stereotype a whole generation?
---
Can only dock a super in a keepstar. That was a fortizar. He was probably ratting and warped to his spot close to the structure when hostiles came close.
---
I do not like the idea of people knowing what ships I have. Don’t think people with AT ships would appreciate it either.
---
7 years. I dont pvp much on that guy and if I do, its solo t1 frigate stuff, occassionally a t1 cruiser, rarely an ass frig.
---
Oh, that makes sense. Thanks.
---
Lol, no.
---
You got to pay extra for tethering?
---
There's a website card EVE Offline and you can see how the EVE concurrent online population have been dropping. And recently there's a bit of a slope as well
---
With my current plan i get 500 mb of tethering a month, and thats it. Absolutely zero way to get more. But i get unlimited LTE if its actually on the phone. Its a weird plan. But ive never tethered in my life so it doesnt bother me.
---
Long answer short? No, not with the direction CCP is going. I'm not saying that in any manner to be biased, but they are producing a lot of controversial changes and they haven't been able to introduce one that is extremely outlandishly popular across the board. They are changes to appeal to one segment of the game, not the masses.
---
Orly? And how does that site show you actual against actual+bot characters?
---
Wait, it does not. But, hay we can rant on Reddit 'Eve is dead' I guess
---
Man sounds like a horde of assholes.
---
I agree. They can either reduce the need to multibox, or they can make it a discounted subscription for alts --- like in FF14 if you just need one character you pay £9, if you want multiple characters you pay £14/mo, and there are no difference on whether you pay for two characters or more. CCP can achieve this by making it possible for characters on the same account to be multiboxed or something.
---
I think making content less terrible to peruse would be a huge step. 
---
Null Sec strategic objectives (Sov, Moons, ect) are needlessly difficult. Citadels have turned what used to be a 2-3 day event with poses into a week long effort for no real reason. Shooting citadels is very boring when uncontested and fighting on grid with them is oppressive due to the strength of some setups (Mostly talking about forts right now). Myself and other content creators have been very vocal on a timer adjustment for citadels so killing the smallest, cheapest citadels isn’t a week long investment. 
---
Sov is an interesting topic because there is some people who really enjoy Aegis Sov. Personally, I think it drags out sov contests and spreads out content so much, it forces people to adopt smaller faster fleet doctrines to play sov wack-a-mole. While Dominion sov wasn’t perfect, the fights that it sparked were way more localized and the fighting much more intense. I think instead of a sov revamp, adjustment to the new system, along with the improved client stability we enjoy now would be a welcome return and make sov war feel less horrible. 
---
The short version to this would be, yeah, I do think we could see a population increase. It most likely won’t happen on the roadmap we are on currently on.
---
Its a useful one
---
2 out of 10 Alpha pilots become Omega pilots.
---
This is what happens when alliances turn a blind eye. This is just one guy that probably did the following:
---
* Run VNI bot for 23 hours, make 1b per day.  
---
* Set up 25 VNI bots. Make 25b per day.  
---
* Run for months on end without being banned. 3 trillion.  
---
* Choose not to RMT 1/3 of your money and buy ships.  
---
* RMT the remaining amount at 3-4 USD per b. 6-8000 USD in pocket.
---
Wasnt even a fort, that's an astra lmao
---
Still mad you can't solo with your falcon alt?
---
Nah, I just know that your leadership can't help being dumb as shit and will continue to make the same mistakes over and over until you slope right into being a PH member corp.
---
Not very. About a couple of months ago, I got hit by the 'all your asteroids and planets are gone' bug and lost a lot of progress on a save. Haven't seen a fix for that so far.
---
A coalition of cunts if you will.
---
Shit spending 100 bucks on a hobbie is almost too much for me.
---
I was thinking that as well, they should just remove it. I mean I see why the devs did it, you could just exploit it. Someone gives you a huge bounty and then the guy logs on his alt and kills his cheap ship and reaps the bounty.
---
From the far, dark Northern reaches of the world.
---
This sort of claim is made every time there is a war where potential third parties always favour one side over the other. Maybe Imperium likes to third party in this conflict more than PanFam does, but it's undeniable that Winter also has similar allies.
---
Although it could be argued that Chaos era is making it even less likely that NIP'd groups will want to play it safe and not make enemies of their immediate neighbours until they see how ~~all CCP's insane bullshit random fuckarounds~~ it all plays out.
---
Top Dog flex, you tell those dicks
---
Go away.
---
Strange self stroking session here.
---
Yes, carefree attitudes are good for EvE. I completely get why people become upset when something they spent months on gets blown up, but at the same time, I think players need to avoid taking things too seriously.
---
Heh, kinda remind me of the clip where Grath was raging at a bunch of Panfam who were actually *giddy* that they'd lost so much in one fight. I can completely understand Grath being ticked off, but at the same time I think the big null-sec blocs need to just YOLO away and get in massive fights with each other for the sheer hell of it.
---
For most people's VIDEO GAME playing that is truly truly outrageous.  People with gambling problems stuff less into slot machines.
---
I have used the golf analogy before too (spend less than average golfer) - but we are pushing it to an unhealthy extreme here.....
---
NINETY FOUR MILLION ISK OPPORTUNITY WAS MISSED. 
---
That's it boys... may as well pull a Clinton and cide.
---
I swear, it would be so much better if player corps could just buy billboards to put near stargates and avoid the whole mess with mobile depots and secure cans, those things are annoying.
---
dicks don't work in lowsec, duh
---
First off, I apologize for the post spam over the kills, I had just finished the video and thought one would the background would be appropriate.

 There was no real fleet engagement so the BR may not report the entirety of each side's force. However, FRT, Legacy, FI.RE and Goonswarm were the major players on field. 
---
AAR: Legacy has begun to get more organized in responding to PL's mass entosis of Legacy including efforts to offensively mass entosis FRT space. At some point, a individual pilot took it upon himself to go out solo and reinforced the KE-0FB i-hub held by FRT in Detorid.
---
KE-0FB is part of the Detorid constellation that borders with Immensea; the location of Legacy's main offensive staging system. The resulting timer was in prime EU time; Legacy's strongest time zone.
---
FRT made standard preparations by cyno jamming the entire constellation and bubbling the entrances to the constellation which would had made it effectively impossible for Legacy to use capitals. However, FRT cycled the U0W-DR (also the Detorid entrance to the constelation) jammer to light a cyno and bring in its super fleet, Legacy followed suit. Now, both sides had a similarly sized super fleet locked under jammers.
---
Initially, FRT does a great job clearing Legacy entosis ships which are mostly sub-capitals and bring Legacy within two nodes of losing the timer. While trading FAXs, Legacy being to assign portions of its sub-capital fleet to nodes and slowly turns the tide.
---
Because most of Detorid is mostly cyno jammed, there is only one system FRT can use to mid additional supers. Legacy has a HIC waiting in system and catches a Vanquisher, the very same pilot that lost a Vanquisher weeks before.
---
The titan kill was understandably a tough blow to Winter Co and they choose to stand down for the day. TEST claims the KE-0FB i-hub.

Biomass or your words mean nothing.

The problem isn’t so much that they are favouring one segment if the players - it’s that they favour easy, low-effort fixes to problems. I get that they have limited resources and they have spent effort on a few systems, but so many other changes are just easy tweaks or deletions that don’t really expand the gameplay of Eve, often they delete it. 
---
Change is fine and often will be uncomfortable, but the best kind of change is something completely new rather than something that invalidates a way the game was played. 
---
But some changes are necessary to get out of the hole CCP dug for itself pandering to the masses. They game was stagnant and on the brink of economic collapse, so let’s hope CCP can find the resources to add real, new things to the game, not just more of the same or reimplementing an existing game system yet again.
---
Given having an unknown mass hole isn't exactly uncommon after you had a fight on a hole ( most of the time you can't really track everyone's jump mass while fighting ).
---
So like the common rolling methods still rarely result in a rolled out hic so really don't see the massive difference pre-randomizing the mass will make ( yeah it means SDing slightly more hics / sigils for a farm hole ), but really that's not gonna make that big of a difference.
---
Now fighting on a wandering hole on the other hand, yeah that just became massively painful, as you have no idea if your fleet will be rolled outpost fight, this means especially if you're not on friendly terms with the locals your likely to well not fight on them, but even if you are like rolling the hole mid-fight is a massive pain the ass and can royally screw the side that is jumping in, so most likely both sides won't really want to jump them leading to less fighting on those holes.
---
If you had idk like a bil then I'd at least take the bait even knowing it's bait

Maybe I've seen it before but it didn't catch my eye until this.

It can get hit by any other form of electronic warfare aswell, especially targeting range and ecm will render this utterly useless.

Nice write up. I had a similar play style living in Solitude before I moved on. Did you consider to use the lowsec to nullsec WHs for a bit of PvP? Often enough alliances are too lazy to roll those WHs which go to the middle of nowhere.

This was from early 2018 and I didn't have anything to do with it, just FYI. All I have to go off is the reason and the thread itself. Just posted it for context. Basing on the time frame those were the days where the sub was split between wanting more memes but mad about too many memes. Lots of mass brigading from discords was going on around then to. There was a whole mod strike thing because of that shortly after. All of this is conjecture, though. Just trying to help the discussion by providing what details I have access to.
---
We don't need a reset since according to this sub everyone is leaving anyway, now is the perfect time to join and begin building your all conquering empire, the current blocs will be powerless to stop you since by their own admission they will only have 3 players left a few months from now.

Yes, I understand that, I just know that I'll miss those near heart attack situations when you just hope that you'll be able to warp out in time before getting pointed.

Putting 1.5-2b worth of radiation sinks on it. But to stupid to put a plate on. Or tech 2 rigs. That thing will die to anything before it can spool up.

I’ve been playing on TQ for 12 years. What’s your way to get “solid good PVPers that quit to come back”? Eve’s old players are literally that: old. They have lives, jobs, kids... they need content that is readily accessible without 4-6 hours of uninterrupted playtime.

I pulled the numbers you don't like right off the graph. We're down, up to 8,000 players at prime time in 2 months, 2 more months will have us at 8,000-9,000 at this rate. A month after that you won't have anyone to fight with on this sub because it will be as much of a ghost town as the game is.

The merc market could be instant. The player could either run simulated combat against pther pilots to improve their skills whilst they wait for a merc contract notification to come through. With sufficient player growth the merc's should not need to wait around too long for pvp to arise as they can instantly transport into the cockpit of a fighter or the turret of a gunship after accepting that contract. 
---
The only thing that will increase this wait time is a lack of small scale pvp (unlikely) or far far too many pilots for the pvp available and only the most skilled pilots get jobs whilst every other merc runs simulations or npc fighter/turret job's against pirates or opposing factions for example to improve their merc score to a level where they can receive real player jobs.

The eve dev team still did a lot of work (probably more than necessary) for what spaceship first person pvp would look like. VR by definition provides more information that 2D screens and so a port should theoretically not be difficult. What is also more telling is the fact that Eve:Valkyrie was primarily criticised for a lack of content rather than it's gameplay and "feel" asuch.
---
1) Make sure your Safety is set to Green. This will prevent you from performing any action that would result in a Suspect or Criminal flag. If your Safety is set to Yellow, you're allowed to perform Suspect actions. And if your Safety is Red, you're allowed to perform Criminal actions.
---
2) Do you have any Killrights on your head? If you've recently ganked someone (within the last month) then they can activate the Killright at any time in order to force you Suspect. Or they can sell the Killrights for a price, and anyone willing to pay the price can force you Suspect.

Eve is not dead as a concept. It has been and always will be a niche game, but it's a niche no other game has even tried to fill. Growing the game again could happen with the right changes. But they are either too expensive in terms of resources, or require a deep understanding of the complexity of the game that few people have.
---
There is no quick fix though. There is nothing that would suddenly get players to join or return in droves. The communities need to be brought back and allowed to build and thrive. Conflict needs to be encouraged, but losses limited(not too much, that's just as bad). Balance between attackers and defenders, wolves and sheep, the peaceful and the warlike needs to be fixed. Done right we can go back to retaining more players than we lose and grow the game again.
---
It's not going to happen though. What I expect is more ChAoS, more short sighted changes which only damage the long term player retention of the game.
---
brawler with shortest range ammo 21km optimal?

You know... they thought about doing this years and years ago. Making a time to warp duration, and regardless if you're aligned, or being bumped, you'd still warp at the end.

No, if you want to advertise you can put up billboards, but dropping mobile structures within a certain range of a stargate in hi- and low-security space would get it flagged as a suspect so anyone could shoot it without CONCORD repercussions.

I was referring to the 8 years your corp spent in PL, dropping titans on Brave while avoiding anyone with teeth. Definition of cowards.
---
What if you get bumped? Does it go back down?
---
Yeah, that's a classic. Funny thing is I initially sympathized with Grath because I'm not very good at suffering fools - or anyone I mistakenly perceive to be a fool, as the case may be - and his alliance's casual disregard for losing extremely expensive ships riled me a little. Then I learned more about the game and I kinda sympathized with both sides of the argument, because one of EvE's major problems is apparently the proliferation of capital and supercapital (what's the difference, BTW) ships to the point where no one wants to fight because it just gets boring.
---
Aside from the 4 minute ramp time, it’s also worth noting that it’s a full implant set. That means you can’t fit slaves. IMO that’s not worth the trade-off.
---
The only time you’ll be ramping for &gt;4 mins in a fleet fight is vs. caps, and realistically if you’re fighting caps you want the slave clone more than you want the extra damage.
---
Just reset the timer with a corvette with a t1 point?  Unless I'm missing something it's not exactly game breaking.
---
The point i should have made is that the vast majority of eve pvp remains small scale fights which should remain largely unchanged by a doubling or tripling of the players involved. Considering most of the information sent to a turreted player is going to be the same as the player driving/piloting the ship there is a lot of opportunity for turreted players load to be optimised serverside so that the main load is instead where they are firing (something that is anyway calculated for a turret rn) and what they can see (should already be calculated for small scale fights).
---
I take your point about fighters and as a result in much much larger fights player piloted fighters may be limited or no merc contracts issued instead allowing the ai to manage the piloting with player given directions as it currently is. 
---
This change imo will primarily affect the smaller pvp engagements where there is a large opportunity for skillfull kills and the lag should not be too great with additional clients present (especially due to turrets provided the developers don't duplicate information unnecessarily and instead run a lot of calculations client side such as giving more information than the turret weilder needs (i.e. who needs to know where other ships you can't see are or are not moving remotely towards your LOS) a lot should be down to the piloting verbally relaying over targets etc reducing information required to be sent to turrets. Drone pilots won't see much beyond their range of flight anyway so load can bebmassively reduced there especially if we assume drone and main pilots have good comms.
---
For profit: Another mining ship. Double the income, just as likely to lose the first ship anyway.

“Without it’s cap it’s even squishier” FC what are adaptive nano platings, armor plates, and EANMS?
---
“Long spool up” well that is the trade off of those implants no?
---
“Very low range” pretty sure mystic has more range than null if not very close to it and does similar damage.
---
“Very squishy” mkay sure. Try having a fit that’s not tinker fit and looks like a ratting fit. 
---
“Very slow” man it’s almost like it’s a battleship with an AB, those cursed MWD frigates running away from me!
---
Leshaks are pretty awesome all around. This fit  isn’t a great example of their capabilities past the damage with implants. 
---
Yeah it’s basically HAW dread damage in a battleship for ratting which is nice. 
---
This fit is also very likely not meant for pvp, so saying you’d need hard tackle for this to get on top of it also doesn’t really make much of a point given lots of people have secondary tackle ships/alts when using this in a small gang scenario for example
---
Don't forget the high tolerance for stupidity. I think if you put veteran NCOs and longtime Alliance officers in the same room they'd bond so damn quickly over all the nonsense they've had to put up with during their time herding cats.
---
Less about the corvettes and more about the plexes needed to run all those pointing accounts...
---
When you say turrets are you referring to turrets on piloted sub caps, or on the fighters themselves? Because I can honestly say I have zero interest in flying a sub cap in fights where the guns I put on my ship and paid for are not under my control.
---

---
Lmao anza, who had to pre ping for T1 barge mining ops a weekend in advance just last week.
---
From the security report they just released, I'm thinking the primary (masked) purpose of the Drifter invasions was to test possible features that make botting more difficult, not really to destabilize null in general. Also explains why they didn't immediately follow up -- apparently they got the data they wanted from it and are evaluating/developing more ideas to come later.
---
“OMG so broken” lol right it’s ratting fit with what I’m guessing are max rolled rad dink’s there. Leshaks are strong but this implant set will far from break jt
---
lol u mad?
---
Damn, just went threw my emails. No codes. To those who have been able to try it, Any good?
---
It's already an OP strategy cyno boating and it's hardly like that's going to change with fighters doing more damage whilst player controlled. Also many of the smaller ships t2 etc will actually receive a massive buff from this change as it becomes a matter of how good your turret pilots are, the more turret pilots the easier to shoot down incoming torpedos, fighters etc. Multiple players covering your angles will massively buff smaller ships and probably make them hella more difficult to take down as turrets rather than needing to be manually switched to separate targets as they do now can switch on their own and deal far more damage to fighters than they currently could. 
---
A smaller ship (provided turrets are buffed more than drones) should be able to hurt a carrier more than it can now arguably balancing the game a little more in favour of casual or less isk solvent players.
---
there will never be a burn jita again, you can't deal with a mechanic like this for 72 hours
---
(15 minute criminal timer / 3 minute warp timer) + travel time= minimum 6 alts to point.

No one is going to wait the whole 3 minutes so more like 7-8 alts.

Star Traders: Frontiers is available on Steam. It's much more crew-focused, but you can choose plenty of hulls and modules, which reminded me of Eve. You can trade, explore, pirate, smuggle etc.

Didn't they cost a lot more a decade ago? 30b sounds familiar, if you go back to 2009. Of course that's irrelevant now, but those which survived this long did actually cost as much.
---
that's when you get the jumper cables
---
It's comepletely optional ofc. But remember if you have multiple turrets on your ship the ability to quickly change and focus targets could be especially effective in ships with multiple players on board. As i mentioned below the ability for a ship to deal with large swarms of fighters or npc pirates will be massively buffed by the capability of turrets to quickly switch targets depending on the need.
---
It's definitely a mobile game with simplified (somewhat, this is still EVE) UI. BUT it's enjoyable for sure. One thing I actually love is by default you'll auto orbit your target, and auto switch guns to next target.

&gt;Q1: If I don't go afk, and have relatively fast ships (BS and lower) will it always be ok to travel in Amarr space?

Yes.  Basically, don't fly an orca or freighter with that character.  Everything else should warp fast enough to leave grid before the police arrive.
---
&gt;Q2: Will I always be allowed to dock into Amarr owned Space stations?
---
Yes.  (Assuming no game mechanic change from CCP)
---
&gt;Q3: What should I do to start and try to restore the rep status for Amarr? I would guess that Agents aren't allowing giving me missions due to the low rep with them. Right?
---
This guide can be helpful: [Faction Standing Repair Plan](http://cache.preserve.io/2p2pv1ca/index.html).  It's old, so don't be surprised if something in it is slightly off (such as you find agents via the Agency screen now)
---
Some level 1 agents will always be willing to give you missions.  However, grinding up status via missions will be tedious.
---
The SOE epic arc can be helpful, if you haven't run it recently.  Just choose Amarr when you reach the step where you're helping one of the empires.

You know, if an "EvE Classic" were to appear from the depths of the internet like Aphrodite rising from the seafoam of Ouranos' severed ballsack, I would play it for about a month just to see what the game was like back in the day.

That said, I don't want CCP to spend time and effort on something that will probably die after everyone's rose-tinted glasses came off and they realize a lot of the old mechanics they tolerated back in the day have been replaced by newer, better ones. I'd rather they spend that time, money, and effort on fixing and improving the game they have *now*.

---
splitting guns almost never has any advantage and frequently puts you at a disadvantage.
---
'well known' now is a acceptable excuse to drop - quite useless - homophobic slur? Good to know! If you can explain me what purpose 'gay pwned' serves other than "we've been saying it all along!", I'll reconsider my position.
---
Tbh the fcs there are trash. Not much lost in that department
---
...Falcon, you're going to have to accept the fact that when it comes to the internet, someone will *always* find a way to boggle you via shitposting or their genuine, incomprehensible "how-did-you-survive-this-long" stupidity. Sometimes both.
---
&gt; the more turret pilots the easier to shoot down incoming torpedos
---
The fuck? You could never "shoot down" torpedos, and people stopped using firewall fleet comps years ago because of how hard they are to use. You're not talking about merging the game play of two separate games, you're asking for a complete re-write to all combat in eve for a game with next to no player base, that's already been out for several years and at this point is far past the time where you could draw in new players by simply adding new features.
---
Best news I've heard all day
---
Dead
---
Nah just moved on from the edgy "harden the fuck up" bullshit.
---
EVE isn't a game its a hobby and most people have limited time.
---
According to r/eve if you were out in a pve or industrial ship for that long without dying there isn’t enough risk
---
Nb4 Hilmar finds this thread and makes a button to teleport bombers to any industrial hauler nearby
---
If they werent entirely meaningless, I would. But I cant be arsed to shoot citadels so they will stay low forever
---
I saw "warp drive preparing" there. I hope this will get it into the game, it looks much better.
---
I'm talking about mods in the context of moderation. Don't care about making subreddits pretty.
---
So you're saying I can build supers in lowsec?
---
This is true, but in massive fights like this the fc will be in multiple accounts, at least one will be cloaked on the other end of the grid for this reason
---
I don't feel like explaining it to someone who is so stuck on his stance that manages to twist what I meant to try and accuse me of being a piece of human shit.
---
I'm not homophobic and I didn't use it in any relatesd sense, no matter how you feel about it, that's just a fact. Hope that makes you feel better if that was what was worrying you so much.
---
If you just feel like slashing your pedantic burgoise concept of equality and social justice feel free to just go fuck yourself.
---
Your choice mate.
---
Oh hey, cynos are getting more expensive.
---
This. The most important thing in huge battles are doomsdays, because they work more  reliable than other stuff in heavy heavy heavy tidi. With the fax changes (dr on reps per tank type) it's even better to dual tank
---
"effort like that is gone" says the line member that never ran one of those types of fleets
---
I could get a sick ram Jag with that, hit me up on the next shipment
---
Great picture, you should make a wallpaper out of it.
---
This doesn't seem like that bad of an idea. The only concern I have is that adding a random variance as high as 25% to wormholes without giving us a way of knowing what the mass is will make the logistical side of large fights a bit more annoying. It would be nice if we had a way to tell, maybe if the description for the wormhole said, "your sensors detect that this wormhole is X% more/less stable than average", for example.
---
Wormholes should be more dangerous, and it should require more effort to lock off your home. A third suggestion, to add to yours above, would be to make wormholes populate both sides when generating, instead of waiting to populate the other side until someone warps to them.
---
No, but you can take in internet over one interface (the cellmodem) and spit it out another (the wifi, usb, or bluetooth) on every smartphone ever, unless the carrier cripples it.   
---
If you're confused, so was I - the thread just above your top-level comment is about tethering your phone to your laptop and I thought you were replying to it.
---
No, you didn't. You said "for the first time ever we are seeing log on numbers reach and dip below release numbers..." There's no graph that says that because it isn't true. So how about you get to the point and show us where on the model spaceship CCP touched you?
---
First lets compare risk levels:
---
Null sec ratting - afkable in ships costing under 200m with negligible downtime if caught and podded.  Can do it aligned, so even if an interceptor lands on grid with you you can escape as long as you haven't fallen asleep from boredom or got to distracted by your Netflix. 
---
C5 WH ratting: Its still eve pve so I wont pretend its difficult, but not afkable. Your subcap fleet or dread is risking about 1.5-2.5B. Assuming you're closed off your downtime if caught is significant as you must scan your way back in. If using a dread you cannot do sites aligned. If the wrong group rolls into you, you will 100% be caught and killed no matter how much attention you're paying.
---
So sure, you can make a high isk/hr, although it's a way lower potential isk/week, but the risk is such that even taking all reasonable precautions leaves you unable to avoid occasional multi billion isk losses.
---
Assuming you still feel butthurt about the blackout and that WHs are too safe,  here's why your suggestions are stupid: 1) adds tedium but no additional risk. Hell, we already have nearly unrollable frig holes fully capable of transporting kikimora fleets to ruin your day. Because the anomalies don't continuously respawn a prudent player just waits until they despawn with almost no impact on isk/week.
---
2) random holes are rarely the dangerous ones. These are the ones you can scout beforehand and close. They don't have a hostile fleet ready to swoop in and kill you.
---
While I appreciate your nod to maintaining pvp content, the rest of this garbage wouldn't have any of your desired affect on my income in WHs. Its just making life more tedious for no reason.
---
If you really think WHs are too safe then get your buddies, find a C5 static, and come get us. The ships are pricey and the rats have us pointed for you. Shit you might even have some real fun that doesn't require Netflix in the background to tolerate.
---
Yes
---
Yes. Anything that automates an in game action is a violation of the TOS and will get you banned. Even keyboard macros.
---
Yeah! Stop being cowards. get those 5000 ferox's out, fire up the entosis drakes and START RUNNING MONTHS OF FOZZIE NODES!!!!!!
---
I feel very conflicted upvoting you, /u/TheCumDentist
---
I have nothing against gay, but let me tell you... You kinda sound like that.
---
Saying something is gay has been related to being homosexual. Calling someone/something homo, gay has been widely used as an insult. Do you have a better explanation?
---
That sentence also serves absolutely zero purposes. 
---
You're resorting to insults? As a human, I often do perform that act and that's widely regarded healthy. Thank you.
---
Grow up human.
---
The timer is there to set a limit on how long you can be bumped. The timer can be reset by scramming/pointing, so literally just throwing a T1 point on a corvette is enough to extend how long it takes for someone to warp.
---
Just to supplement this sweet dude's point: [leshak](https://funkyimg.com/i/2Wzmm.png) with this set breaks even vs leshak without a set at ~190 seconds, [ikitursa](https://funkyimg.com/i/2WxjH.jpg) like i posted in another thread - at 350+ seconds.
---
How often can you shoot one target that long undisrupted? Is it worth to give up another implant set to have that?
---
If you think so - then go ahead and use it. But personally, I think it's niche set at best.
---
Couldn't he just shoot the stationary HIC, regardless of what guns he had fit, deaggro and take the gate?
---
Yes it is. Now fuck off.
---
he've been going so fast at the begining, i wonder if he could've just rolled out of hic range.
---
thanks
---
It is really surprising how many here don't actually play. Guess that shows the game's power to retain interest, but it makes for a strange atmosphere.
---
Weird Advertisment
---
If I use the align command I will warp. If I just double click in the direction of my fort/safe I wont. Cant wait for the extra action of camera drag/click when krabbing.
---
In other words you have nothing to say to anything i’m asking so you just want to try and hurt my credibility with accusations
---
The fuck?
---
&gt; And if you're jammed or lose range you have to start from scratch.
---
Tbh in 4 minutes you're gonna be almost out of ammo and have to reload

It's also nice if you finish an uncontested bash and just want to shove a bunch of the loot (and often your bashing ships) in the pos shields while you figure out how to get it all out.
---
Krabing in WH much safe, please move to WH, yes.
---
&gt;It's not CCP fault that something completely unforeseeable could result from drastic improvements to one play style at the expense of all others.
---
You're like six inches away from self-awareness there, my dude.
---
I report most of those posts, and it is obvious there isn't anything done about them, because their posts don't get removed and they happily keep on posting. [Bo_Hunt is one of those people and he keeps trolling and insulting to this day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cvb10n/jinterviews_olmeca_gold_on_csm_141/ey30r7k/)
---
Yeah exactly that
---
When you listen to too many Permaband songs.
---
You don't need a huge bit rate, you only need a stable connection.
---
This was recorded at approx 800kb/sec stream.
---
A higher bitrate delivers diminished returns on picture fidelity after a certain point, that point will be due to the size of the screen. With phones for eg: a bitrate of 1mb/sec is plenty due to the size of the screen.
---
Ya anything having to do with skill points, skill injectors, mct, etc is a no go. Even if CCP is at fault the GMs are not allowed to reimburse any of those items. It’s pretty shitty. I don’t think it’s the GMs I just think CCP keeps way too tight a leash in letting them reimburse those items.

It is, but the market botters seem to get away with it a LOT easier than the other types.
---
That is a dope looking Provi and Revelation.
---
Roaming whs, so you mean hs/ls/ns holes? Every wh-wh connection has a static on one side or the other
---
I agree, just for the split ships I'm probably gonna jump back. They think they have the economy fixed so that was one of my big problems as well.
---
ok thanks, I don't want to get banned. I figured it was "safe" because it was just market orders (not mining etc)
---
&gt;ok thanks, I don't want to get banned. Training takes forever.
---
I thought they used an API or something, but its hard to compete - my orders are getting burried in a few minutes
---
Thank you for the background! Most of the other conversations/vids is just of the vanquisher kill. I've been scratching my head on what he was doing/ thinking (which I'm not the only one).
---
&gt; “Susceptible to cap warfare” man it’s like it’s the only ship that has cap consuming guns....
---
Disintegrators are more susceptible to neuting, damps, TDs, ECM compared to lasers or hybrids because it resets their spoolup, and they lose higher percentage of DPS relatively situation where no disruption is applied.
---
Upvote for super optimistic release date.
---
I kind of feel like a way to shake things up would be to cause Null sec rats to spawn at varying rates based on the number of players and stations based in given constellation. For every x players/clones in a system, the pirate spawn rate shifts up a sec status point for 168 hours. And the ore types go up in sec status at half the rate. It’s still null sec, but now you can’t just print money by killing high level NPCs and mining you ABCs. You’ll have to fight players for loot and isk.

Ahh, copypasta, very original.

When people post videos of frequently used ship pvp, I get excited. Mainly for the theory craft of expensive ships that I would otherwise not consider seeing as I don't know how they handle. 
---
Lussy Lou is great for this. Bjorn bee does off the wall things. The battle rorqual in low sec was the best IMO
---
Just debating if the extra Plex requirement  or quiting the game is a better option
---
I mis-remembered the date the game launched, take me to court and sue me why don't you? That doesn't change the fact that we have lost 8k off peak times in 2 months, it doesn't change the fact that if hilmar keeps making rushed changes to try and get himself a bigger pay check and we continue to hemorage players at the same rate we WILL be a launch numbers on 2 more months.

They stated that they saw a significant number of returning players.  Nothing about final counts, though that should be easier to deal with since they gave the numbers in the security report.

Where do you see the ship name?

It would if it re did it’s pve content

please return to being an invisible lurker ty
---
As the other guy said: if there is no keepstar tethering is similar to the old school afk'ing in a pos. No idea why people do that instead of logging off. Maybe they want to spare themselves of the hassle to rejoin their umbrella fleet or something.
---
Nah, bots being Illegal and against the TOS is just a Myth, just send a Ticket to CCP telling them all the accounts you use/plan to use bots with and you'll be fine.
---
Try not playing the .01 isking game.

The latter that pick on the newer players and then demend that hunting be made easier

I love Amarr ships and my style of combat is turret lasers at range. From what I understand though in both pvp and pve amarr is underpowered in the current meta. This being considered what’s some other fun combat styles I’d like to move into cloaky ships and again sit at range. Would missiles or rails be the next logical step? Help a brotha out!
---

---
Those things that people do that you don't understand why, it's because they're different from you. They're different people with different thoughts and feelings, different experiences, different emotional reactions that release chemicals into their different brains because they are not like you. And that's cool, we're all different. 
---
In life and in Eve, try not to get worked up about it because there a more important things to worry about. Sometimes shits different. 
---
Have many great adventures, Capsuleer.

Hey, its been than people bitching and moaning about nullsec and CCP.

This is what frustrated me - I am getting out bid by 0.01 every order. :/
---
Not really. People generally come to games expecting or wanting certain things. Whether it's the classic MMO player expecting a WoW type MMO, where they'll be grinding quests for ages to reach the "end game"; or the Fortnite player who thinks they'll be able to drop in and start killing people left right and center from the first moment without any effort put into it. Everybody is predisposed to a certain play style from the moment they enter.
---
Which is probably why CCP is putting such heavy focus on making small-gang/hunting play styles a priority now. These days games like Fortnite are all the rage, and people joining EVE are probably expecting/wanting things like that: being able to just jump into a fleet and start shooting things. And CCP seem desperate to get those newbros to stick around.
---
Which, again, is absolutely contrary to what EVE has always been.
---
Imperial Legacy is a monster created by NCPL when they decided to shit on TEST et CO2 after WWB. So if Imperial Legacy "kills" the game, it's thank to Panfam.
---
so you're saying you have run those types of fleets?
---
It is against the TOS. It is not, at least in America, against any laws that I am aware of but people have been sued for distributing them (e.g. MarkeeDragon)
---
I'm about to unsubscribe a few accounts because I'm just not using them, but I'm definately going to sink the boot in about the Blackout.  I support the Blackout's concept but it's been implemented, communicated, and thought through poorly...

All these people saying that bumpers are fucked are delusional. The max warp time is 3 minutes, which is an eternity in which to swarm and gank anything you want.

It's too long to be an actual ship name.

And never use caps again.

Wait. I can move them around, I though it was a view only type of thing.  Sweet

Yes, he's saying stop. It's a race to the bottom and virtually ever market trader will tell you how dumb it is.

You can so it in wormholes. But be prepared to have a fleet show up because a scout saw you and will stay seeded until you're almost done with the boring part.

Wait, we are blue again? So I can mine in gmagik again without goons coming from t-can to fondle my rorq?

There's no way those sticky, clumsy buffoons are touching my stuff!  That's what a cheap kindle fire with a huge case is for.

If you sit there and spool for four minutes uninterrupted and your target doesn't die, you could do as much damage as half of a dreadnaught! Amazing.

ccp got the money from players, invested it in other projects which had nothing to do with eve. ccp got money from pa now invest into mobile gaming, still only 4 devs work on eve. thats the truth for the decline, the layoffs of community teams, localization just show how small the company wants to hold investments into eve.

The thing is, this ***was*** a great game.  Hilmar captured lightning in a bottle, because there was no other game like Eve.  An open world, sandbox, space game, that was deep and complex and I am still learning stuff about how the game works ten years after starting.  Trouble was, Hilmar thought he could do it again, and purchased White Wolf, and then we get into the whole Incarna debacle.  Then Dust 514, and the foray into VR games just reinforced the idea that capturing lightning in a bottle twice is impossible.  Each of these 'forays' just drained resources from EvE.  There are deep systemic gameplay problems, that aren't going to be solved by the blackout, or the cyno changes, or any little tweak here or there.  Capitals, FAXs, supers, and titans, need a total rebuild.  They are a big hammer, and to them everything is a nail.  There are massive problems with structures, and sov mechanics.  Cruisers, Battle Cruisers, and Battleships, have no place in the meta, other than what you have to train to get into a carrier or a FAX.  After you train up bombers, interceptors, and Svipuls, it is a long grind to a super, unless you pay cash to inject.  Hilmar, ***fundamentally*** does not understand the game he has created, and his meddling is causing long time players to wonder; "is it still worth it to play this game?"  and that bodes ill for the life of this game.
