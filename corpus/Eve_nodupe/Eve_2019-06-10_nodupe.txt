Just curious, what groups use Thera other than wormholers?
---
---
---
I have been playing for two days, and I have not ran into a single other soul, is it because I am staying in certain areas or something else?
---
Still best game i can find
---
I haven't done anything other then the Career Agent Tutorials. And I don't see that listed under Agency-&gt; Agents &amp; Missions -&gt; Epic Arcs, am I looking in the right place?
---
Hey, he said as far as he knows. Maybe he is just really dumb
---
but NC/PL bots, rmt, lost ihubs, something something didn't want those titans anway.
---
Ninja salvaging is a lot of fun, look for systems with mission runners, FW systems and systems with invasions.  You will also find lost drones scanning down systems.  You can see info NPC kills killed per system on eveye and dotlan.
---
Gilia ?
---
I actually want to see GOTG get invaded and see if daddy condi will come to their rescue
---
I feel like this war should be the 'Lame War' oneside is basically semi-afk Netflix bashing a region of structures the other is not really enganging because they don't have the numbers and are basically just whaling on the other side of the map
---
Yeah I'm trying to look for some tutorials on Youtube on how to Ninja Salvege and most of them don't really explain anything. I don't understand how you find the wrecks sites or which Systems to look in or anything like that. So you find them using the Probe Scanners like in exploration?
---
Make sure you're not filtering by range, it's very likely 10-15 jumps from you at best.
---
In the Neocom, click "The Agency, "Agents and Missions," then "Mission Agents"
---

---
If you want to do combat missions, pick "Security Agents,"
---
On the next screen, set Agent Level to 1, set location to whatever range you're happy traveling to, set Security Status to High Sec, and you'll have the results.  Pick one, right click it's picture, set destination, and off you go.
---
Dreads ignore damage cap?
---
And it can be done with the noob level stuff I have?
---
Great thank you!
---
Yeah I've priced out an i3 mk3s with some filament and spare nozzles to about $825 + who knows how many hours to assemble it. I can get a used Wanhao i3 v2.1 for less than half that, and a used mk2.5s with mmu for a bit less than a new mk3s... so many choices. I don't mind tinkering, but not to fix poor printing reliability because of shoddy build quality and/or design.
---
Most of it can be done in a frigate, later in you'll probably want a cruiser. Look it up on the Eve Uni wiki, arc is called The Bloodstained Stars.
---
I didn't said that they weren't aligned with the Imperium in this war. I said that they have no relationship with the Imperium.
---
And of course by relationship i meant an official agreement, something public, something official, like for example, in the previous war, there was no question Imperium and Legacy had made an official agreement with each other for mutual defense, it was public knowledge.
---
As far as i'm aware there is no such thing with GoTG, that doesn't mean that they have no stake in this war, they obviously do, they have a bone to pick with Panfam, and are obviously providing assistance to the Imperium.
---
But they are a 3rd party, they have their own goals for this war, they have their own motivation to be involved in this timers, so they are a 3rd party to the war between Imperium and Panfam.
---
OK thanks I'll take a look. Do you know how much ISK you get form the missions? Or will the Wiki have that info?
---
Yes, the Sisters of EVE Epic Arc "Blood-stained Stars" is meant for rookies, and can be completed with a rookie stuff. The last boss needs about 100+ dps to break his tank, which you can reach with a destroyer (which presumably you've already gotten for free from the Advanced Military career agent) or with a cruiser. If you still can't reach that dps, you also have the option of asking for help from other players nearby.
---
TIL I need to move the last of my shit out of M-O. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; I didn't said that they weren't aligned with the Imperium in this war. I said that they have no relationship with the Imperium. And of course by relationship i meant an official agreement, 
---
Uhh. Ok. That’s literally insane.
---
&gt; But they are a 3rd party, they have their own goals for this war, they have their own motivation to be involved in this timers, so they are a 3rd party to the war between Imperium and Panfam.
---
Yeah, no actually.
---
So use combat probes to find something like a marauder in space, save that signature  as a bookmark and scan until the ship dissapears. Warp to the bookmark.  Loot someone else's stuff, salvage their wrecks. I have found implants worth 20 million left in wrecks to decay.  Most of the stuff is not worth that much but it is kind of cat and mousey and is a great way to learn some game mechanics.
---
Wiki should have most of the info, I think it's overall like 7-10m isk but I'm not sure.
---
Awesome Thanks! Yeah my Cormorant has 76 dps so I will probably have to upgrade to finish it.
---
Also gotta remember to watch out for a few missions later in that can and will destroy inexperienced players.
---
Have you joined the rookie chat channel? Also, join a Corp and use somebody’s referral link to get started. Shameless plug for eve uni. Pm me and I’d be happy to help get you going in game.
---
So would I be looting NPC wrecks or players wrecks? If it's players wouldn't they be angry I took their loot and try to kill me?
---
Reliability is worth quite a bit, as does not having to tinker too much to get good print quality. I have friends who've bought various i3 clones and most of them have told me to just get a Prusa (heh).
---
SLA is in its infancy for consumer printing, so I'd rather wait a while to jump on that particular bandwagon, hehe.
---
The next to last mission, "Our Man Dagan" you'll want a cruiser while you're on the lower end of the SP scale.  There's a solid 30 missions before that that can be done in a frig or destroyer though, and you'll earn more than enough for the cruiser before that mission.
---
If it's the second to last mission there's 48 missions before that, the arc is 50 missions long.
---
Please keep doing these! They are amazing. With your updates and TiS, it’s like full coverage of what I’d like to know about what’s going on in Eve!
---
&gt;Uhh. Ok. That’s literally insane.
---
Its unfortunate that you think that simply clarifying a statement with further context is insane.
---
But okay, i  guess.
---
Did you miss the part where horde and friends already tried that after the last Goon war ended and gave up after weeks of not being able to push timers in AUTZ?
---
In FW systems and triglavian invasion systems you could be looting player wrecks.  I saw the other day a system from the invasion  had an MTU killed, in had a player's wreck in it. It was well over 2 billion dropped from an MTU that was scanned down.
---
Cheers.  It's been a decade or more since I did it, didn't rightly recall how many total there were.
---
Most elegant solution honestly. The amount of moons in a system limits its strategic ability to anchor structures.
---
I still haven't finished it, got like 15 missions in a few months back and said fuck this and went off to farm DED sites.
---
&gt; Its unfortunate that you think that simply clarifying a statement with further context is insane. But okay, i  guess.
---
It’s unfortunate that you’re so delusional as to think that two groups who have an agreement and are coordinating, as well as fighting a common enemy are two different sides in a conflict.
---
I mean it’s like suggesting that the Chinese were a third party in the Korean War.
---
Check your deliveries hanger. It probably got dropped there. Any time I cancel a job that is where it goes.
---
We were just looking for tips on the best way to whelp. You were the natural choice.
---
More skill training into your Small Hybrid Turret skill should raise its dps. Other skills you can train to increase your dps are Gunnery, Rapid Firing, Surgical Strike, etc. At least train them to level 3.
---
Using meta 4 turrets should help increase dps as well (meta level is listed in the attributes of the turrets).
---
Most people do. It either takes a well fit destroyer, a cruiser, or a friend. Good luck!
---
The Wanhaos do quite well with reliability. There are a few essential upgrades that will push it to perform at a relatively high standard of deposition printing IMO and those are essential if your looking to invest.   
---
You will however, tinker with maintaining accuracy up to a certain point, but honestly, this is good for a beginner, as youll learn the ins and outs of the hobby.
---
Reliability really is great though. Last year, I was using my printer for a class project and it decided that that was the time it should start acting flaky (partial jams ruining prints halfway through). That was when I really started questioning my choices. I've recently discovered, though, that feeding it quality filament makes a huge difference. So hopefully it'll be a while before it jams again. Also, because replacement nozzles and PTFE tubes are so cheap, jams are really not so bad to "fix".
---
Yeah I've chatted in the rookie channel. I joined a corp and talked on Discord with some older guys, I know nothing about Eve but it seemed like the corp just recruits miners and then exploits them lmao. I was given 25mil for a caracal by the owner. I don't want to seem unloyal to a corp but this corp is kind've weird, I am down to join uni if you're down
---
Ok I guess I just have to find a decent YouTube tutorial on Ninja Salvage because so far it sounds like the most fun and the most profit. Thank you for the suggestion
---
legendary story, rage roll of a life time honestly...
---
I don't consider the people who live in Thera to be wormholers except for signal cartel..
---
Also, lots of people use it as a transition hub.
---
Here's some real advice.
---
# Part 1
---
I would say the most time-intensive skill train for most pilots are support skills, which you definitely need for combat and probably won't need much at all for industry and trade. Industry and trade are highly specialized and have a fairly high barrier of entry, so my advice would be to have fun with combat missions. Forget about the Moa. You don't need it yet. Learn to fly your cormorant like a boss, do level 1 missions until you feel really confident. Move on to level 2 missions. They are super easy but not like shooting fish in a barrel when compared with level 1's.
---
*Side note here: figure out where you want to do missions. Just do them for Caldari Navy if you can't decide, but there are a lot of options and you can spend a lot of time researching which corporations give the best rewards, but it's not necessarily relevant since you are probably going to move on from missions soon enough.*
---
Eventually you'll be tempted to try level 3 missions. Don't use the cormorant. At this point you'll probably have trained missile skills, but it's okay if you haven't. You can get away with a Caracal and good skills if you want to do level 3 missions, but this requires good *piloting skills*. If you stick with railguns (and/or blasters), you'll want to hop into a Ferox at this point, otherwise a Drake has and always will be king of level 3 missions. If you're still interested in missions by the time you reach level 4, well, you don't need advice now to figure out what you'll be doing... that's for sure.
---
Now here's the important part: Your focus is training support skills and honing your piloting skills. A nice side bonus is a bump in standings for the corporation and faction you mission for.
---
# Part 2
---
Find a player corporation. This should pretty much be the first thing you do in EVE and 10 years ago I used to fly around convoing anyone in a noob corp and invite them to join me and my merry friends. I don't know if people still do that, but those are usually the kind of people that help you out a lot, or screw you over, just bear that in mind...
---
But really, find a corporation that will show you the ropes, show you things you can't do alone, and so on. One thing I used to do with noobs was to take them into level 4 missions, with most of them flying destroyers or cruisers and working frigate duty, or salvaging, or mining the juicy asteroids which were a lot harder to find around trade hubs at the time. Much to my surprise, working together like this didn't seem to affect the income being generated by the missioning character but all the newbro's were very content with their content. Pun intended, but what I really mean is that they were very grateful to be able to make so much ISK so easily, which doesn't surprise me since level 4 mission bounties aren't all that bad when every ship in the fleet is specialized to killing exactly what they are shooting 95% of the time. But they didn't know that, they just thought they were tagging along when really I was teaching them to survive NPC aggro in squishy stuff.
---
So that was really long-winded...
---
# TL;DR: Combat missions are good practice, and you should join a corporation at some point.
---
If this fails you can use jeveassets a 3rd party tool. if for some reason it is in a ship or something as simple asset search will not find it.
---
May I please use these images on my stream? I can give credit if you tell me what to say.

---
Can you still stage in high-sec if you join a nullsec corp? I like flying around in Bombers Bar who usually stages from Jita, but am kinda interested in getting into the Predditors in Dreddit.
---
I really don’t understand how SS and RR haven’t risen up against them. They are pathetically weak vs those 2 now.
---
What i said was in relation to 3rd parties in eve online ( i clearly stated that in my original comment, interesting despite that fact you decided to bring real life events to make your point anyway)
---
If you played eve for any amount of time you know that the term 3rd party is always a controversial term in nullsec wars, often used for propaganda or just as a "funny quote" to create some controversy for the other side to complain about it.
---
I saw this happen when Test was getting 3rd partied by not only NC. but also goons (and maybe even PL, i'm not sure) Pretty sure this happened during the fountain war as well, when BL was paid off by the CFC to switch sides and hit Test instead. I'm pretty sure i can find examples of this controversy in pretty much any war.
---
Also this happened during the Halloween war, i remember the CFC loving the idea of mentioning at every opportunity they could at the beginning of that war as well as the first few months of the war that they were only 3rd party, which was to be fair, true, they were at the start. the Russians were the main Party for that stage of the conflict, the CFC later became the main party when they decided to fully commit everything they had into the conflict.
---
So yes, i do think that the  term as used in nullsec for years applies to GoTG. 
---
As for your real life comment, no, China entered on the side of North Korea, also as a side note, i don't think i ever heard the term third party in reference to a military conflict where multiple parties  took part of the same engagement, i'm sure this happened somewhere, probably most recently in Syria due to all the different factions fighting in there, but that's kind of the nature of civil wars, but when it comes to Nation actors at war with each other i don't think i ever heard of a third partied showing up in the middle of the conflict, interesting thought nonetheless.
---
I'd bring a loki boi
---
If you haven't found a corp to join, I would do that.  Your chances of surviving the first few weeks in Eve go way up when you connect with one.  Probably the best way to find one is go to the forums and look in recruitment, and find one that matches your interests.
---
Yea I know evicting shitter corps is their thing, but how many of those shit corps come back to j space? We need more nerds to shoot, not less.
---
&gt; So yes, i do think that the  term as used in nullsec for years applies to GoTG.
---
I’ve played EVE for fifteen years and I’m still amazed at how some of the playerbase can twist themselves into these kinds of thought circles.
---
I'm not defending the term used, in fact, initially when i saw the reference to  gotg being 3rd party i read as a piece of sarcasm, but then i saw the other user apparently taking offense of the term, so i made my comment in defense of it, that in relation to eve online and the way that the playerbase decided to twist the meaning of the term 3rd party, it applies perfectly.
---
Likewise

Vily didn’t shout blue In local so no one knew to stop shooting. Tell him to apply for SRP

---
i dont think that there needs to be a counter to literally everything in the game, i think that being cloaked watching a system is kindof at the bottom of the pyramid when it comes to "counterable play" if you know what i mean.
---
plus the counter is moving systems, for example you could (and people do do this that aren't in megablobs) prestage dreads or even bridging titans/subcaps in a different system a few hours beforehand so that the enemy doesn't see it coming.
---
Was it a good fit?
---
Now skil urself trolls, this is a BR to be proud of
---
Follow me on Instagram
---
I'm going to assume that by Darkness. you mean gotg, or Sort Dragon's coalition. In that case, yes i do see them as independent. 
---
Note that independence doesn't make someone strong, it just means that they are the ones making decisions about their future on their own.
---
So yes i subscribe to that idea, they are independent, weak and at the mercy of the Imperium, but still independent. 
---
I see them kinda like smaller nations in EUIV (not sure if you ever played the game) nations that are just destined to be annexed by the bigger nations but they are still trying to survive on their own and forge their own path, we'll see if that's successful or not.
---
Was this from that same little excursion?
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30002110/201905312000/
---
We were the GalMil Nomen gang.  Once I read *Odin’s Call* &amp; *Immensea* I thought that sounded familiar...
---
I once said in Jita local that I'd double any ISK sent to me and this mad lad sends me 0.1 ISK only I didn't double it. Had to lay low in syndicate for a week after that, pretending to be a gneiss miner.
---
I tried SS nozzles, but I would still get problems from my all-metal hotend. I'm guessing your problem wasn't with brass nozzles, but with *cheap* brass nozzles. Most places that sell SS nozzles seem to do a good job machining them, like Microswiss.
---
\*wizard hat
---
&gt; I'm going to assume that by Darkness. you mean gotg, or Sort Dragon's coalition. In that case, yes i do see them as independent.
---
Magical thinking. I go back to what I said that after a decade and a half I’m still surprised by the mental gymnastics people manage to pull off.
---
&gt; I see them kinda like smaller nations in EUIV (not sure if you ever played the game) 
---
You’d do better with a Victoria 2 and Sphere’d nations analogy honestly but sure. I disagree and that’s maybe because I know things you don’t or just have a different perspective. The fact that you still refer to them as GotG when Slyce is gone from it would be the same continuing to call the north the Money Badger Coalition.

Please read my flair and then biomass your character and delete your Reddit account.

Are there such thing as Ninja Salvaging focused corps? Or maybe corps focused on salvage in general? It's something I really want to lean after someone pointed it out to me in this thread.
---
&gt;Magical thinking. I go back to what I said that after a decade and a half I’m still surprised by the mental gymnastics people manage to pull off.
---
I don't understand why you think that is such a stretch to call them independent, if you have an argument against it, please go right ahead, i'm open to the possibility that i could be wrong in my opinions, but so far the only thing you did was trying to insult me, or saying that i'm engaging in mental gymnastics, go ahead tell me why i'm wrong, i could change my opinion.
---
&gt;You’d do better with a Victoria 2 and Sphere’d nations analogy honestly but sure. I disagree and that’s maybe because I know things you don’t or just have a different perspective. The fact that you still refer to them as GotG when Slyce is gone from it would be the same continuing to call the north the Money Badger Coalition.
---
I never played Victoria 2, but its on my list of games to try out.
---
The reason why i refer to them as gotg is because its easier to type it, its on my mind already. Its why i will continue to call Test.. Test, and not tapi, or whatever the fuck people are calling them this days. its why I often called  the Imperium, CFC a few years ago, because i still didn't got used to the name change. 
---
GoTG went from gotg to deadcoalition, to what dumpstercoalition? idk, i saw someone say that they shouldn't be called dead coalition anymore because it was RiotRick name for the coalition, but i don't care, until they give another name that sticks on my mind i'll keep calling them gotg, also i like the name, because its actually a cool name, even if its a bit presumptuous for them to have picked that name.
---
Mostly payback to snuff, but it was also to maintain a good balance of power on their northern border.
---
Test and PHEW have both lived up to their respective side on any deals between the two, anything outside those deals is still fair game.
---
Because they do vastly different things?... We're also talking about a platform vs an mmo. So... How did you manage to fuck up logic so much that you asked me that question

---
How did 606 ships lose to only 70?
---
What would we do without Jintaan
---
There's not going to be any youtube video on ninja salvaging.
---
Find one on scanning with probes, combat probes preferably. Use the agency to find the invasion systems. Go there and probe, warp to stuff, lock it up and use your salvagers.
---
Use zkill to see the destroyers killed in invasion systems to find one fitted for salvaging. You can easily fit a corm with several salvagers, an expanded probe launcher and maybe a tractor beam or 3. But use zkill to find a good fit, thats educational too.
---
10 minutes of salvaging in he invasion zones will net you enough isk to replace your corm multiple times over if you get blown up. Just remember to dock up in a freeport or station every now and then and unload your salvage to keep it safe.
---
Lowsec or WH
---
Since I don't really like completely structured gameplay and also don't like high risk I have 2 recommendations.
---
No risk exploration. Grab a probe fit for exploration scanning which should run around 2m isk. Go to 0.6 and 0.5 sectors and scan for data and relic sites. You should find a few million or so each sector on average.
---
Low risk teiglav ninja salvager scout costs 4m. For for combat probe scanning, and hobgoblins for a little dps. Scan down some enemies, grab the location to link in chat with am estimate of the number of enemies so local can warp in on it. Then you can warp in doing 40 dps with your drones while salvaging with your ship.
---
You help with the info and drones making you feel not worthless and can expect around 5 million a wreck.
---
Is it for sale?
---
Some people suggest thera as highway route between null and Highsec. I learn it when staying in nullsec static wormhole.

---
Are you going?
---
I'd love to hug this animosity between us out
---
Maybe a little bit of tongueplay
---
Might you share the 3-d printer file? i want to print one for myself! its look very great!!!!
---
Both are perfectly possible Ever heard of Skill U?
---
And your Instagram is ...?
---
Neither fit is  going to matter much if you are caught by a competent pilot while you are exploring. Your best defense is keeping your wits about you. Decloak as little as possible. Warp cloaked to and from a tac rather than burn from can to can. Cargo-scan cans and hack the most valuable ones first. If you see probes on dscan, cloak up. Be pre-aligned to a celestial while you hack. Spam dscan while you hack and hit warp the second you see anything appear on your overview. That will keep you alive while exploring more than any fit or ship you might have. No one is going to mess with you unless they think their ship has a reasonable chance of killing yours, right?
---
Now, that that's out of the way, I'll give you my two cents on Astero fits, and flying a PVP fit Astero (with some hacking mods you can swap with, using a mobile depot) is way more fun than a pure explorer fit. Hunt other explorers and when things get slow, swap out a couple of modules in your mids for an analyzer and a cargo scanner.  
---
The shield Astero is really hard to kill unless it gets in web range or it's against light missiles. Then it's toast. It's fast as hell and most weapons can't hit the thing. It only has one point in the long point so some stabbed explorers will get away. 
---
The active armor brawling Astero is a brick and can withstand a ton of punishment (unless neuted or the incoming dps is way more than you can rep), and if you have a faction scram with three points you will hold onto almost every explorer you lock.
---
Never underestimate the stoopid
---
This frenemy narrative is way more interesting then rapid chunk blowing from both sides
---
so you are saying you'd rather have no one talking about wormholes at all, than a non-WH candidate? i can see why whs are getting screwed all the time
---
you mean horde tried to invade? And that NC didn't partake in?
---
I wonder why they are not hitting geminate instead =)
---
Alliances aren't coalitions.
---
Join pandemic horde. I need more targets to shoot.
---
without the word "never" your whole post goes from just being wrong, to making no sense at all. And i don't think statement "it's more viable for small alliance to hold sov now" can be somehow interpreted as a justification not to try and make things better
---
Have you looked at the map before? Dead co space is kind forever and a day away from horde space.
---
Absolutely retarded
---
is it global average or region average? I thought it was for the region which is why you get weird notices that something is a likt 999% markup for some items when they're normal priced via jita
---
imagine falling for such fucking obvious bait jesus christ
---
Are they even a coalition anymore?   Its more like Darkness + renters.
---
Oh right, I almost forgot is was NC that invaded deadCo space.
---
It shows ignorance of the situation, which is that small alliances are still turbo-chokeholded out of the possibility.
---
If you join a null block you can go around salvaging havens and sanctums. It pretty good isk

&gt; I don't understand why you think that is such a stretch to call them independent, if you have an argument against it, please go right ahead, 
---
The fact that they’re coordinating and are actively working together is obviously not enough for you so I’m not sure what I could provide you. You’re not gonna get a public announcement if that’s what you need so I guess just continue to think they’re independent.
---
&gt; i'm open to the possibility that i could be wrong in my opinions, but so far the only thing you did was trying to insult me, 
---
I’m sorry if something I said made you feel insulted. If you point out what it was I’ll apologize for it specifically since non-sensical “I’m sorry your feelings got hurt” is sort of crap.
---
&gt; or saying that i'm engaging in mental gymnastics, go ahead tell me why i'm wrong, i could change my opinion.
---
Again, I’ve got no idea what proof I could provide you since you’re insistent that the fact that two groups fighting on the same side in a war are somehow not. Or the fact that goon dreads got saved a bit back by tethering on a GotG citadel. Or the fact that they’re coordinating fleets. The mental gymnastics comes in with you saying that none of those things matter.
---
Which is weird because PanFam gets shit talked about the fact that it’s a Strategic Defense Initiative and not a true unified coalition.
---
It’s exhausting to hear, for example, that people “aren’t blue” in the south or west because they occasionally shoot each other, and yet when the North says the same thing for the same reasons we get told it doesn’t matter because for strategic timers we recognize the need to actually form coalitions to not be completely steamrolled by a giant blob.
---
I’m not saying the North has always been honest on its politics but it’s certainly more up front than most of the others have been lately.
---
they aren't

I mean, it's been that since bob tbh.

Tell that to every Anthem gamer. Sure they could all change their play style, but then it would simply suck as a game. Good games evolve. Eve has evolved and the evolution has changed the player and revitalized the player. I'm afraid you're trying to make a comparison that is simply irrelevant to my statement.

It's not about waiting for cool down timers, it's about market bots instantly undercutting you by a penny. I'd actually be FOR longer modify timers.

Cheap answer: Ender 3 off of Aliexpress
---
Expensive less fiddly answer: Prusa i3 MK3
---
The cheap printer is a clone of the expensive one. Which one you get will depend on how much of a hobby you want to make tuning the printer. I can say that the Ender 3 for $300 CAD shipped works great now that I leaned how to adjust it, and how to play with settings in the slicer.
---
Instead of PvE ships wondering if a hostile is going to magically appear on top of them, tie local to gatecloak. Hunters get a maximum of 60 seconds to dscan a target, and if they break cloak early, they show up early.
---
This way, the play and counterplay is equal instead of giving hunters an advantage just because "muh kills" and hunters won't have to worry about bots pulling drones and running while they're in the middle of a load after jumping in.

Gobloons, is all I have to say.

Just because Mittens said on the Meta show "We'll see if DeadCo move on to Vale/Tribute" at exactly the same time Sort announced on a SOTC that DeadCo would finish up Tenal, and then move onto Vale/Tribute is 100% coincidence.
---
There’s probably not any corps that focus on just salvage, as that’s not something that’ll keep a Corp going on it’s own. You can look for high-sec corps focused on industry, they can help you make ISK a little faster. 
---
That said, focus on exploring all that this game has to offer, rather than trying to find the right way to make cash.
---
Horde base out of NC space who they were blue to at the time.... don't play stupid to benefit your point its embarrassing when the whole game knows what happened

Yea, pretty much as far as i can tell from history lessons. But as for the last major wars i must admit i enjoyed wwb more than current one.

What you really want to do is have it at 0 and mine a mercoxcite rock like 4000m from some excavators.

&gt; The fact that they’re coordinating and are actively working together is obviously not enough for you so I’m not sure what I could provide you. You’re not gonna get a public announcement if that’s what you need so I guess just continue to think they’re independent.
---
As i said, it depends on the level of coordination, the coordination that i was able to observed so far is not the same as coordinating with wartime allies, even the mbc push on the imperium in world war bee had a bigger level of coordination than what i've seen from gotg and Imperium. 
---
Again i'm not denying the obvious, yes both Gotg and the Imperium are fighting Panfam, but is gotg part of the Imperium war? that is a different matter, if they are not, then they are a 3rd party in the conflicts in Tribute. I see gotg being opportunist (nothing wrong with that) in this conflict, they saw the opportunity to strike an enemy that has wounded them in the past year or so, and they took it. 
---
Again i'll bring up the example from EUIV, if in EUIV i'm playing as a smaller nation, and the big nation that wants to kill me is getting its ass kicked by one of its rivals, i usually try and declare war and see if i can steal some land from the stronger nation while they are losing their other wars, does that make my nation a part of those other wars? not really, and that's kinda how i see Gotg role in this war.
---
Don't worry, you didn't offended me, but i felt that there was an attempt at insulting me when you took the position that my statement was insane a few posts earlier.
---
&gt;Or the fact that goon dreads got saved a bit back by tethering on a GotG citadel
---
**I was actually not aware of that!**, if that is true, and Imperium fleets are getting access into gotg structures for this offensive, then i'm wrong, they are not just being opportunists like i initially saw them, (or maybe they were initially but diplomats worked it out a deal behind closed doors) and are indeed fighting together in the same war.
---
Regardless, if what you said is true, then, I'm willing to admit i'm wrong.
---
The reason why the north tends to get shit talked here on reddit is because the north is made up of PL and NC. and like it or not these two groups made a name for themselves by pissing off people, and the people that they pissed off, got together and formed one giant coalition called the Imperium, and a satellite coalition called Legacy, and they both have a pretty significant presence on reddit, kinda like what happened with the Imperium during world war bee, they pissed off half the game minus the Russians, and that half after getting paid a bunch of money went up there and evicted them while trash talking them on reddit, circle of life really.
---
have to read the forums :p
---
One meme Lord resigned, another rose
---
Yes, you can make probably 75-100m an hour if you do this in an organized fashion in a system with enough wrecks.
---
What you do is save every haven/sanctum as a bookmark.  when one disappears, warp to that bookmark, drop a MTU.  like 10-20 minutes later, warp back to that MTU to salvage (sanctums and gas havens take some time for the MTU to work).  means you are warping to each site twice, but allows 8 salvagers and you should always be in warp or salvaging.  be sure to save each new anomally as it spawns.  forsaken hubs are also worth saving.

Do invention on a mining barge bpc
---
Meh
---
It’s one thing to smug about killing a few fortizars or Tataras, but an entire region worth of infrastructure I believe is deserving of a recognition.
---
I see, so I’d need to purchase a blueprint from the market for say a retriever and then do invention on it? Does it somehow unlock exhumer type mining vessels?
---

It's a nerf to free intelligence, but does not hurt people actively using d-scan.

can confirmed angel dreads need 2 carriers, or if you have a spare character in a dread and are super bored, takes about 15-30 seconds of siege to kill it
---
The Titan is the same way, couple of carriers or a dread.
---
They aren’t “unlocked” per se.  you take a bpc for a barge and perform invention on it, and get an exhumer bpc in return that is consumed on use.  Read the eve uni page linked above and that should tell you what you need to know, and how to do it.
---
Thanxalot! ;-)
---
You guys are so elite attacking evil Panfam in tenal when they’re busy trying to not get completely run over by &gt;1000  Goons every major timer
---
Honestly in most dead-end pockets that would actually be a buff to free intel, because the VNIs can warp off long before the hunter ever gets there.
---
Rhiload did say if I recall in one of his last actual videos that he was cool with people copying him and doing it to give people Content™
---
Hey don't you diss GOTG who are an independent strong coalition who needs no goon ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/byo1n5/gotg_escalates_with_dreads_on_2nd_tenal_battle/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bx7yy3/gotgs_first_tenal_fight_goes_as_expected/))
---
Well, he’s the reason I started flying them again, but I guess im not the only one in that boat.
---
Yes because hundreds of spodcels who like mining and shooting red dots coming together to do the same thing but with structures is a amazing feat
---
not only are you dumb and stupid in game, but your posting has to be by far the worst of any group here as well.
---
wait he went csm?
---
Please read my flair idiot
---
It depends. If you are the one generating those wrecks in a super - probably not worth the hassle. If you are a newbro, looking to salvage/loot after someone else, or a rattlesnake/vni - then it's a good source of income.
---
Uhm yeah you can smug when you are razing an entire region . 🙄 Like why wouldn't you. No one has the balls to try to defend.
---
They can't smug over getting their home razed.
---
Deal!
---
Renters are stronger than the landlord.
---
Yea, I mean if you raise an entities space in eve and then roll out they totally cant put 90% of it back in 8 days or so.
---
The truth is that CCP cucked us and wars generally dont hold any real meaning anymore.
---
According to their reddit team its not their home because they don't care so it doesn't count if we burn trillions worth of stations because they didn't want them anyway.
---
Really I was under the impression fights were happening. Why do YOU think they should care about the structures?
---
&gt; the north is made up of PL and NC. and like it or not these two groups made a name for themselves by pissing off people, 
---
Most of the players in the North aren’t in PL or NC. Including most of the ones affected most by the War Of Pointless Aggressions.
---
Aside from that there’s also the very real fact that most of the pissing off that PL and NC. has done in the past is nothing that any other group hasn’t done in equal parts. If anything the fact that this myth continues has more to do with NC. and PL having no PR department. When you have people like Catlos and others constantly pumping out propaganda and people constantly pushing the other sides’ narrative without any real response people tend to easily become indoctrinated to forgetting that there’s nothing at all unique about anything the North has done in that field.
---
Things like the Viceroy program or TAPI being the only alliance to try and actually kill off Goons post WWB get forgotten but somehow PL “hellcamping” Brave or evicting TAPI get remembered in the collective consciousness of the community.
---
Also: as far as the goon dreads goes, hard to provide anything like a BR as proof given that we moved supers to catch them only to have them be able to tether on a structure of a supposed “neutral” party. Which is when everyone besides Horde figured out which side “GotG” was on. Or Sort at least. Not that anyone who knows Sort’s history should be shocked by that.
---
New to Caps, so please forgive me, but if a cap remains aligned, what risk is there to a neut? Is it due to seiging or something which prevents warp?
---
Nah im gud
---
Actually not a bad idea. Good job!
---

Sure PL and NC. are not a majority in the north but they are the north, without them there is no meaningful coalition in the north. Horde might eventually become the dominant power in the north, but that's not going to happen any time soon, NC. and to a lesser extent PL are the figureheads of the North for better or worse.
---
I don't disagree with what you said about the lack of PR group to advocate for the north in the propaganda wars on reddit, Cymek used to post some pretty good propaganda anti test after he left Test, but unfortunately he stopped doing that. 
---
And yeah i agree with what you said, people pushing one single narrative it becomes the de facto truth due to the lack of counter arguments, as i said its a similar issue that the Imperium suffered during world war bee, they had no real presence on reddit to advocate for them, and as a result reddit was very hostile to goons and very pro mbc.
---
About the Dreads, i'm basically taking you at your word tbh, as I'm not a participant in the war, only a distant observer, i can't really contest it one way or the other.
---
However i'm a bit curious about the timing of this event, did it happen in this war? or prior? because your comment about Sort tendencies to backstab his allies seem to indicate that the dread thing happened before Horde attacked them. Since that would be the only point where GotG would have (at least from my perspective) any allegiances to Panfam, after Horde decided to invade gotg, i don't know why gotg should have had any real obligation towards Panfam.

INIT Tengu fleet roamed in SH1 and nearby killing a jump gate with tengu fleet and also cyno'ed in a phoenix to kill it faster. It was 2-3 days back. We expected some escalation, nothing happened. The 1000 vs 500 narrative doesn't check out anymore. You are not willing to UNDOCK.

its like the dumbest activity but maybe you can google a guide for it, you skill into a procurer or covetor put proper modules in and mine. The annoying part is your haul will fill up in about 10 minutes so you ll need to eject the ice into an mtu or a jetcan then when its filled swap to a hauler and move it to a station to compress.

What fights? The north is getting steamrolled. This is what happens when you refuse to destroy your enemy. It never made sense to let.goons just run off to Delve and not pursue. In the old days alliances died from genocide. Now you just let them rebuild 😔

What are you smoking? Mittens literally doxed someone at fanfest, while being a CSM member, to try and get them to commit suicide IRL.

Are you daft mate? He clearly admitted he had to do what he did (Join PL) because they forced him too. Who the hell talks like that on the internet? *My* alliance? Nobody knows who you are, ofc he is going to call the alliance by name.
---
This "idea" is posted at least once a week
---
Again I do not disagree with the problems as presented but the OP has a real history of being biased against Goons. He may say its about playstyle but he always or almost always uses Delve as his example instead of other regions of space. That makes anything he says come off as biased wether he wants to believe it or not. I personally live in NPC null and have no issues with being dropped on by caps or subcaps..I just make sure I have a solution for the problem. Personally thats one of the reasons I like NPC null...The danger factor.
---
Probably because they never leave their homes.
---
I've never seen this as an actual thread, and if you're reading it in the comments, I've been the one saying it.
---
great story ty for sharing
---
Yeah... About that... They aren't exactly fighting the goons now, are they? No, they are keeping well enough away from them. If they were, we'd have seen many times more fights than the couple that has actually gone down.
---
But then I'm just a goon pet please ignore...

Im just arguing that when it comes to content generation, corps that have the numbers but are afraid to lose ships are contributing exactly 0.
---
Skillu has zero super cap FCs.
---
Reading memory sounds like a very bannable offense. Not that botting isn't, but from what I'm aware bots rely more on OCR and log files than memory reading. So anyone trying to read from the client is more likely to be detected by anti-cheats.
---
I'm sure switching sides away from Skillu will go over *just fine* for them... lmao
---
Lol, I guess the joke is the PH one is a shit emoji?
---
But the joke's on you because they all look like absolute shit
---
No supercap force either, really, so

They've got plenty of space to build one up in and the dronelands are hard to siege. They could realistically do it if they commit to the plan.

---
What anti-cheats?
---
you wouldn't say that in autz
---
Ok, so let me do a little analogy for you so you figure out how me (and I assume other people too) see these kind of posts:
---
\*
---
You and your friends hate goons and they hate you. When goons are home (most of the time) you can't do shit and most you can accomplish is jump the fence, kick the tied up dog and run away. At some point in time goons decide they had enough of you using valuable oxygen so they go to your house and start burning it to the ground. You can't do shit about that either so you take even more friends and now you can make it all the way to the porch and kick goons' disabled child that just sits there in the sun. Then you come to reddit to brag about how you have suddenly developed the ability to do more than just the poor dog. 
---
Now the goons in what soon will be a barren field which you used to call home do care about the dog, but think he should be used to the spanking by now and they do care about the disabled child too, but they have quite a lot of those so it is more a matter of principle than actual love. Actually what it probably hurts them A LOT more than the dog and the "odd one" is the rusting tractors and the rotting harvests. But none of these compare to the satisfaction they get from not only razing your entire neighborhood, but doing it so fast and thoroughly, that even after they leave, you will still think twice about re-settling. 
---
Now with the bigger picture in mind think what the joy you seem to get from kicking the weaklings say about soon to be homeless you.
---
Now I want the same thing
---
Underrated comment.
---
I thought it was jita sell :)
---
B-team gets to commentate
---
Now imagine the tidi when two or three full goon fleets hold their cloaks on entering system and decloak at the same time (a valid move and tactic). 
---
If 774 people joining local in a couple of seconds wouldn’t melt the server I don’t know what would.
---
That response fleet is not something to ignore. Do your homework on how it works before engaging cause they are mean and scale up.
---
As a cocaine fueled murderbean, I approve of this representation of PH!
---
Look at what you can sell your ore for before refining and what you can sell the minerals for after refining. Also think about how you'd get the minerals to market as they are a lot bigger in m3 size.
---
Usually though if you don't have maxed out refining skills with implant and the best possible structure you're going to lose isk over just selling the ore.
---
ahahah same here, I did not had any computer for 2 weeks, log back had my ships in space was like "woaaaaaaaaaa so beautiful, and those stars in the background woaaaaaaaaaaaa"
---
stay afk.
---
I will tell you a few thinks. 1. Take a look at the corp history of members of the "good?" wh Corps, you will see that often they start in small, in your eyes unworthy Corps. These Corps bring Players into the Wormhole space. 2. CCP don´t Count like you ( These WH Corps bring Content and These not ). They just have a look of the raw numbers in wormhole space. If the numbers sink, it´s less likely to have Patches/changes for the wormhole space.
---
can I see what I am getting
---
This is a fucking decent idea.
---
sure
---
How are attentative players not getting punished by this? You will have even less time to react assuming you spot the baddie as soon as he decloaks which you usually dont and the hunter is already inwarp to you either way...
---
i ran my wanhao duplicator i2 until it would run no more, good machine, deffo some tinkering needed, but thats just a free lesrning experience
---
Oh god...just think about that sexy LEGO ragnarok 😱😱
---
Fit your ship to handle inbound hostiles. It's plenty possible to change fits on ships to better handle hostiles, it just lowers ticks. Drone navs, inertial stabs, MJD on Rattlesnake/Dominix, etc. Hostiles still have to warp and land, that all takes time.
---
If you've got Netflix up over your monitor then you'd be just as at risk either way.
---
you are either strawmanning or simply didn t get the point. 
---
nobody evicts small corps that put up a fight and generally strive to create content.  All those are welcomed in any space tbh.
---
what can give casus belli is that you re a corp that can field 10+ people regularly and you turn down fights and only take those that you are 100% guranateed to win. 
---
The only content you get out of those people are ganks, at best, and that s not a great content driver unless they lead to an eviction.
---
This is a superior idea to just delaying local because recons don't appear on dscan.
---
GJ op
---
You can overcome this quite easily.         
---
Like you are just reading the memory.    
---
Most of the anti virus software doing this constantly so detecting abuse is quite hard to get not to many false positives.
---
If youre attentive you'll see local spike. You will have less time to react, but you will know to be aligned and ready to evac if you see someone land on grid (assuming they arent on dscan coz recon)
---
Any leading alliances wanna fit me up with a puppet state?
---
1. That's a very approximate thing. Station trading is difficult and it takes some game knowledge to do well. I hate it for isk making and I think it's an over suggested thing to newer players.
---
Other activities aren't really done on a % of capital. I do a lot of importing to my null alliance. I charge a 10% markup on on all my costs for fit doctrine ships I sell on alliance contracts.
---
Most isk making activities are measured in isk/hour.

---
Wouldn't that just work the same as if they all jumped in at the same time? Local would fill at whatever rate it does for massive user spikes the same way as they decloak.
---
If youre the hunter youre not the hunted
---
Needs a banana for scale.
---
and you can look into the Situation from outside for sure ???
---
From this 10+ People how much FC´s? how much PvP driven Players ? Or Maybe Players who are not comfortable with PvP and afraid to loose over and over again. YOU simple don´t know it. It´s easy to say, just give fights if you are on the "Winning" end and you come most of your fights on top, but if you are on the "reciving" end and loose most of your fights, it´s likely you look witch fights to take to have a Chance to win. Only loosing isn´t fun you know.. Also if you evict those People, be sure, that you won´t get more Content, you get less Overall. After all it was C2 wormhole. These called "lower-class" Wormholes meant to be for the "not hardcore" Players.
---
Let's make combat interceptors just not appear in local at all.
---
So about that whole not-magically-appearing-on-top-of-you thing...
---
I agree that combat interceptors need a change (honestly the entire interceptor line probably needs a rework), but this would not be the thing to do to make them better.
---
At the moment that’s slowed down by traffic control when the characters skills, ship health, stats and everything is recalculated when you enter a system (part of the brain in a box set up of the engine from my understanding). 
---
Adding the delay based on an action that’s going to cause pretty much a secondary traffic control seems bad. 
---
Maybe tie it to a set time delay rather then an action that way it’s a known and pre calculated variable rather then something players can use to their own advantage.

yep, and the cheat/anti-cheat war heavily favors those making cheats. I like how CCP detects cheaters serverside, but they do have a lot of room for improvement.
---
which server?
---
local is in amazon.
---
As long as T3s with the cloaky sub can use it fine, otherwise you're hurting BLOPs hunters as well...
---
He left it at fanfest!

The more zkill guide vids the better

Invention runs use one run from a bpc, a 10 run BPC will give you 10 tries to invent from.
---
I wouldn't touch covert cynos at all, or maybe give them a small delay but the session change already is enough delay.
---
let me guess the mmo you backed: star citizen
---
You don't even need to invest in a Noctis to try this. A scanning frigate or destroyer hull can be pretty efficient as well - and will cost you maybe 6m instead of 60m.

It sounds like you may be interested in null market stocking. Train up t2 haulers. Blockade runners are for moving small cargo while cloaked in a ship made of paper and deep space transports for higher volume and tank. Both can fit through medium wormholes. I started my import business about 6 weeks ago with 400mil just stocking 1 item and am now sitting on about 10bil combined sell orders and in escrow on my jita alt and about 1bil liquid, stocking about 50 items. You will want your jita alt to remain in an npc corp and haul the stuff on that character to the system with the wormhole, not take your null alliance character to trade hubs. You may want to consider a second omega account for hisec t2 haulers. You can definitely make enough this way to plex one or both accounts, but it will slow down your empire building. T1 haulers will be ok for the hisec leg if youre careful, or use public courier contracts, but then ou risj the hole closing before the goods are delivered.
---
Haha. If they ask for faction they better pick it up themselves lol.

---
It's not a new idea
---
CCP does not say, and if you try to mess with these values it is an exploit.
---
ok, CFC
---
I disagree.  I bookmark the wrecks then will get them "later" before the 2hs expires after i refit off a nestor to an align/warp fit.  so yes, i'd get it eventually - just not before the salvager does.
---
That moment when your TLDR is longer then the other half of your post...
---
Oh, I didn’t know market manipulation is an exploit, because that could definitely mess with a lot of values lol
---
The in station graphics and lighting were changed dramatically a few weeks ago. Longer than 2 weeks though.
---
This is 2019 Eve. You don't engage if you think you will feed.
---
It's really not that hard or involves that much effort since SP farming is a thing. Literally free alts you can AFK on income sources like mining.
---
&gt;corps that have the numbers but are afraid to lose ships are contributing exactly 0
---
And it's fine to be wrong. People can't live solely out of their hole. If they exist in J space they're getting in supplies. Most corp members have to get isk somehow. Usually krabbing in some place. Gotta haul in ships which you can bubble and kill. 
---
This whole winge about content generation is shit. Most people just don't know how to extract said content outside of "well we put our 30 man heavy armor fleet on their hole and they didn't undock". 
---
Example 1 of why you're wrong:
---
I've done so much degenerate shit to corps who were actively voiding every single interaction with me they possibly can. I literally read a book for close to an hour one night while cloaky camping a hole because these Russians knew I was trying to fuck their rolling ships and they weren't having any of it. Sat there until they thought I was gone. 
---
Corp actively trying their hardest to deny me content, but look at that. Amazing how difficult this game is.
---
market manipulation is fine, but manipulating the prices that CCP selects for items is an exploit after some people bought and sold some useless items from themselves in several regions for stupidly high prices and then filled haulers with that item and blew them up for basically infinite LP profits and then listed stupid amounts of LP store items in jita to make mission running LP rewards useless from that point forward.
---
Nice story dude, but I'm afraid your conclusion isn't fully supported by evidence yet. It's poor reasoning to suggest that since he died in x, he must not have y.
---
Would be cool if you did a follow up by tracking the chap over a few weeks or something to confirm he actually had no super, or something similarly high effort.
---
This sounds like a "buff my play style" post.
---
"Alright, I got a Loki to specifally kill ratters, now let me catch them more easily!"
---
2/10
---
There was a time (not too long ago) when the sigs were lost just by docking or leaving the system
---
Thanks for the fight, was a lot of fun! One of the best fights i had for the last few month.
---
BTW just to make things in the Second Fight clear:
---
We were trapped by HC because there was an internal misscommunication which led in the capitals warping to the correct citadel but the subcap fleet not.  
---
So the capitals where initially save. But since we coun't dock them anywhere anymore anyway, we dicided to bring them back into the fight instead of saving them just to have some more fun with them instead of just selfdescructing them later.
---
&gt;only take those that you are 100% guranateed to win
---
MFW this is how tons of large C5 entities treat fleets, but they're still here lol
---
Wow... But they fixed it. So this can be fixed too right? 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
1) You can reconnect to lost probes after disco
---
2) Bookmark your entry WH first
---
Fixed.
---
The reason GOTG is burning Tenal is because Sort Dragon is a backstabbing piece of shit
---
You mean so sort can install more botters ok
---
He rose above his station.
---
Ahhh someone's salty
---
Venal is not NC. space
---
Which one do you do? Exotics with vedmaks spawns wreck me due to their insane tracking
---
It's not a new idea, but who cares.  It's not like they're gonna stick someone's name on it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bss0v6/z/eouw44k
---
no of course not, they just have structures and renter structures there and other panfam structures there.... definitely not their space.
---
So, those are game mechanics, I don’t get your point. I mean even scamming is considered a game mechanic also you do realize that the “price CCP selects” is usually affected by in-game activities as well.
---
I’m really lost with the point you’re trying to make tho, from what you have said it’s all things that are part of the game and it’s like saying “Playing Eve is exploitation”
---
I bookmark my WH but I lost other signatures too
---
Found the Netflix ratter
---
first a titan, now a super. when is the keepstar theft happening?
---
Probably not i think it s tied to how the game is coded. Use a 3rd party to map.
---
he still wouldn't have lived.  only difference is there might be a few less people on the killmail and they would be a tad more inconvenienced.
---
Should have joined INIT.  then goons, then test.  that way he gets to move his super safely at each step.
---
It's an NPC region
---
Test supers moving across lowsec are fairgame to anyone not blue.  there is no shortage of sufficient dreads to kill them.
---
Commenting on a br where your enemies are undocked saying they won't undock....
---
...ok
---
BUT MITTENS
---
I mean CCP could probably have people load up in local and noch showing client-side until gate cloak is broken? (or the tick after, since that should be double checked server-side)
---
You get no isk from it only standings.
---
Ok I’ll go to my room , it’s not like PL will undock anyways right ??
---
So why all the hate here for DeadCo who are actually giving fights?
---
Considering there are at least a few flashform skirmishes every day, you're not just a self-professed pet, you're also a self-demonstrated moron.
---
How many times have you engaged their capital fleet?
---
originally it was not a bug (when sigs disappear after docking). Recent years updates added this feature. 
---
Why the disappear when loosing connection ? From software  side I could assume sigs are stored in client in memory. Each login/logout restarts client, so no sigs any more. 
---
Fix them ? yes probably, but it would be new development which is not priority I suppose.
---
ps. Few years ago when entering system signatures where not shown at all, still remember times of Deep Space Scanner Probes to find all available signatures in system.
---
Inb4 haw dreads. i mean one haw dread can take on like 7 black ops and be like " brah that tickles" stop ...
---
Where did you get the model???
---
An even bigger space poop. I can not imagine something like that.
---
NPC delve isn't in the middle of your influenced space and exploited by your entire coalition for isk making purposes, Venal is.
---
CCP made explo already way too easy.
---
Just train small hybrid weapons and caldari destroyer to 3 or 4, that should be enough to bring you over 100 DPS. An
---
underrated comment
---
&gt; Edit- also, there are no exhumer BPOs.
---
Incorrect.
---
name change to SuperSalty needed
---
There is no regular northern meetups, However occasionally a Northern one/Manchester, there is however the main UK one which meets up in London every few months. Which is often worth a visit if you are near the main train lines.
---
What all sites can 2 nestors do?
---
But it still needs to interface to the game to “know” where someone is. 
---
Either way don’t want to burn Amazon’s server side down either it hasn’t been terribly reliable and doing something that’s going to place a potential greater strains that side of things isn’t smart
---
Don’t tanked stronghold - last wave
---
I think a local “delay” would be best for hunter and hunted.  
---
Say you enter local and you have a minuet before not only you pod in other peoples local but before your local kids to the system.  That way people not paying attention to Dscan are less “safe” then they currently are while leveling the playing field for hunter and hunted.
---
You would want to open agency and find triglavian invasions from there. Fit combat probes and locate battleships farming there. Warp at 100 then just before you land make a bookmark. Warp to that bookmark and aproach the battle ship this is called a perch. When wrecks appear you warp to them open and if there is a skillbook you steal it and run. At this point you can link it local and see if you get any salt. If there is nothing worth going suspect for you lock the wrecks and fire your salvagers and steal the salvage without going suspect. This process will likely cause the carebear to enrage. Which you can use to squeeze more isk by selling him a salvaging permit or selling him the loot back.
---
tldr?
---
lmao as a horde, thats hilarious
---
Oh ok thanks. So pretty much everything else then?
---
Hell yeah I can get behind that idea!

---
It's a lost art that's mostly irrelevant now but remote rep black ops are actually really powerful if you have like 20 of them and tank them properly. You fit em out with plenty of tank and they're bassically T1 BS with lots of utility. If you're feeling lucky you can also chuck in a cheap Apostle and you're ready to brawl. Redeemers become squishier/higher DPS napocs and redeemers are squishy AC machariels. That HAW dread might have be able to tank your damage, but he's going to struggle if there's 15 heavy neuts on him.
---
Or use a purpose-fit Hecate and be literally uncatchable short of mass smartbombs in high sec, which I for one have never seen.  That's how I've moved Titan bpos if I was too lazy to simply use a Black Ops for truly perfect security.  The stange things which old industry alts find themselves training...
---
No. This is obviously Rhiload bro-viding a guest voiceover while squish gets his squeaker fixed.
---
Jeez.
---
Yeh this could work. Helps hunters but also slows them down as they move through empty systems.
---
Where did I say supercaps?
---
You mean like Aberdeen?
---
Is killing capitals give different result?
---
Don’t now is they tanked?!
---
On the contrary, doing what we did required a specific set of circumstances; which only came to fruition last night...
---
Including things like TEST being busy, being a weekend timer in EU/US crossover, the fight starting at the right range, provi fully committing to our bait caps...
---
Its basically like predicting the weather. But try enough times and it'll happen; which is exactly what we did ;)
---
Hope this makes sense?
---
It’s a Blue Yeti!
---
Please tell me GotG at least won whatever objective they had. This hurts to look at honestly
---
Fair enough, it still sounds funky though! &lt;3
---
attackers know when they're attacking, so they can easily focus their attention then; defenders have to stay focused a long time, so they also need more time to be able to react; especially since the first hint you'd get with your logic is the intercepter/bubbler \*entering warp to you\* (as they had 60s to see where you're at, then get a free tick or two for relaying the info that they're acting through the server to you); if you're speed/sig tanking with for example a vni (which non-botters also use), you then need to slow down, align, and get back to warp speed; as well as you don't know if it's "just" a single ceptor or if there's also a huge fleet coming behind it (which is already in local, just holding cloak waiting for the tackle to land) as there might have been a wh in the adjacent system where your eyes just might have been afk for 20 seconds, so they didn't notice the blob entering through a wh.
---
counterproposal: nerf kitey ships - they're in my book a worse problem to pvp than wcs: it lets ppl pick whatever fight they chose. if the defender brings something to counter them, they can run - the defender needs to bring a second counter on the other end of the pipe to intercept them, which in turn can get seen by their scout, and they can warp to a safe and safe-logoff for a bit to get through lateron
---
Dont buy tourettes, buy missiles.
---
&gt; However i'm a bit curious about the timing of this event, did it happen in this war? or prior? 
---
It was a bit before, when goons we’re deploying their logistical assets one of the things they were doing was pulling back assets they had staged to attack Branch/Deklein last year to reposition them for use against Tribute/Vale. During this they moved a sizable dread cache that we got word was being moved around the Fade/PB/Venal area.
---
We rush moved supers and sprung the trap only to have the Goon dreads end up suddenly getting tether rights on a Darkness. structure. At the time most of NC. and some of PL still seemed to believe Sort was on their side.
---
GOTG are Imperium allies? What kind propaganda is this.
---
North East UK - and we get "Humberside", "York!"   
---
YOU MEAN NORTH EAST ENGLAND!
---
And people wonder why I'm a nationalist!
---
Exactly. It has nothing to do with Sort needing to expand his botting empire.
---
No, Camelot Unchained.
---
You first.
---
Huge boost to standings at the end in your choice of faction though.  Eat a glam booster for even more.   I found it quite useful for my Jita alt for Caldari standings.
---
Sure, I'll bite. Mfw guy with FW flare talks about defending stuff and having balls.
---
&gt;Horde and Friends
---
Just Horde, actually. PL didn't really do anything and NC even reset us for it.
---
Press F for Kenny Powers mach. She lived a long time
---
I liked when local was just completely broken and unreliable. That was perfectly EVE.
---
Im a simple Eve guy, I see cornak post I updote. Don't even have to read it
---
And then you fed when you actually encountered any resistance. But congrats on killing completely undefended sov. All of Horde is shivering at this display of your unmatched military prowess and neigh on indestructible fleets lmao
---
they say ladies first

I just don't feel like flying around to all the various stations to do that.

Exactly.
---
People are willing to travel for such events, I’m from Manchester and Middlesbrough’s easy enough for me to get to so I can imagine quite a few people would come.
---
Uh, are you okay...?
---
Thera isn't a wormhole, it's a system only accessible by wormholes. Sounds weird but it doesn't have the normal wormhole mechanics, so therefore Thera residents aren't considered "Wormholers"
---
Your from Seattle. You wear glasses.
---
wtf everyone is Goonswarm pet lol. don't deny it
---
They landed from warp with Ishtars and a dread a second after Astra repaired.
---
The fact its undefended says enough
---
Oh wow that's just sad
---
You're right, and also a cunt.
---
I mean his content was sorta copying a world of warships channel in the first place.
---
Yep because we are currently occupied with an enemy that can actually do shit opposed. Maybe you can even graduate from winning against no defenders to winning against defenders you outnumber? I know it sounds hard but just imagine that. Actually winning a fight for once and not even having to suck goonie dick to do it.
---
Vid of the fight from skillU PoV: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCP16Y5cAsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCP16Y5cAsk)
---
With all the deadco 200 IQ higlights:
---
1. The SkillU Astra reps in the moment the warp in
---
2. Deadco jumps more dreads to ref the astra in the moment their subcap disengages
---
Buy PLEX, sell PLEX for ISK, buy turrets for ISK. Problem solved!
---
So literally no difference from now? What OP described wouldn't affect bots in the slightest, as they have literally no reaction time, and are always "checking" local.
---
&gt;And I’m not saying injectors are bad.
---
But they are. They've removed from this game the one thing that money couldn't buy - skill. It makes no sense for a 1-day old alt to be flying a titan because someone has the cash to inject that much.
---
Sorry mate, only John O Groats residents need to be applying to this meetup, take my apologies and please don't blow up my bus.

Im waiting for SS and RR to work out that they can charge GOTG rent.

So 14 Titans and 12 Supercarriers destroyed a huge armada of... 35 Dreads. Shock horror?
---
Sort saved the north for nothing!
---
Sure mate, everyone is welcome providing you don't mind a little travel.
---
It still died. The attacking side had eyes on the timer and Leshaks ready to warp in when the Muninn fleet didn't kill the capitals fast enough.
---
they did do a deployment (only darkness), they movefleet had 30 dudes
---
What would test have to do with anything? It weren’t a tz crossover, was eutz.
---
All welcome mate
---
i have full skills to fly even a super, mate, but it's armor fit thanny with armor rep and rigs are for fast align and warp-&gt;max isk.  I don't have pvp fit with me, as i have another carrier just for that.
---
goons should know how hard it is to control venal
---
Those PL legs are impressive for a 3D printer. What model is it?
---
what fights did you see lmao
---
all fights have been pretty even or a goon feed
---
whatever you want
---
Autz seems working pretty fine and gotg wouldnt fight alone so ... sometime youve evicted us iam sure we say hello there
---
Don't fall into the biggest skill trap for newer players. You have the skills to sit in the ship, but to ***fly*** the ship you need skills for the ship, appropriate navigation skills, skills for the tank modules, support skills for the tank modules, skills for the guns, support skills for the guns, and any snowflake skills for specialized crap like ewar or tackle.
---
Doing all that for a T1 noob frigate takes hours, T1 noob cruiser days, and it just gets worse from there
---
Good idea
---
Well, I'd say a huge difference. Real players wouldn't know about a hostile in their system for up to 60 seconds while bots could already be docked up long ago. 
---
I'm not saying CCP will implement it this way nowadays, but in the past, they've relied heavily on client-side validation of information which made it so that the people who were technical enough could bypass many of the restrictions and even read enemy ship fits remotely as they activated modules off grid.
---
Contact dark shines in game for puppet terms
---
Yup also on Teesside...
---
I was worried about those before I began, but they printed quite easily. I printed them two at a time laid down flat. I used a small brim and a slow speed. I got a model from Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1159501
---
It's such a shame CCP has nerfed this playstyle :(
---
Not he didn't
---
I understand what you're trying to say, but a hostile can't do anything while cloaked at a gate. Unless they have an align time, warp time, and lock time shorter than the bot's align time, there's just no difference. A bot can react instantly, and can always be pre-aligned. Even appearing on local when they land on grid wouldn't be enough to catch bots that aren't intentionally coded bad to look more realistic.
---
The one with Darkness in it or some other OP?
---
Quite possible. People on reddit aren't known for clear and concise posts. More often they are just blabbering about random nonsense
---
I had a 7.5" Wyvern made as well as a Dramiel and used them as Christmas ornaments, came out nice
---
Valued allies illustrated
---
The reason people kite is that right now hard commits are suicide, like most of the groups that kite heavily or do nano gang are not all that large so often it's about not having to commit well against a fleet 3 times your size. 
---
Nerfing kitey ships would make N+1 even stronger as nano is often one of the few tools you have to deal with large blobs.
---
I mean... TEST could always join up and try and even it up, maybe try and avoid the total death of conflict that we are approaching... :\\   
---
Legit, game dies this year at this rate as all of null will be blue, and there won't be any viable way to ever build up in opposition again.
---
Test being busy reduces the chances of your batphone going through.
---
yes he did
---
Rebuilding is still going to require effort, funding, and the opportunity cost of all the shit that was destroyed mid-build. 
---
Regardless - yes, I agree it’s disappointing that an offensives success is measured in who spent more time AFK sov wanding or cycling guns on an anchored structure.
---
Also lol at this vote brigade, guess Horde is successful at one thing.
---
total bullshit
---
Anyone else feel bad for CVA? Ever since I've been playing, someone has always been oppressing them.
---
You aren’t going to be able to replace all that in a week.
---
Huh?
---
Grath please come back and make pl the boogeyman of eve again.
---
Nice, I watched the whole nyx stream. Those comms sounded like loads of fun, cant wait for the titan. Might have to move some assets down there

WTB dreads lol
---
Here is a selection of BC fits (not all brawl) and some commentary about them to help you choose.
---
Myrmidon 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/69608145/
---
Triple rep double links seems cool and the tank is solid. However I find I have terrible luck with the myrm in the current meta. The dps is low and people know you’re heavily tanked which causes them to bring all the hate.
---
Brutix
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75630023/
---
Again, not a huge fan. Double rep is cool and provides longevity but you lack control and the weapons are short range. You’re also vulnerable to basically anything with a long point since no projection and no mjd.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/72194320/
---
If you’re going to do brutix, hull tank. It is tried and true, has one of the best ehp to dps combos. You can force people to come in and scram you using the MJD, as long as you’re on the ball, you can scram them back (except for good inty pilots but those don’t exist in null).
---
Harbinger
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76387421/
---
This used to be both my undisputed favourite ship and fit. It’s got amazing projection, dps and tracking with scorch and unlike other kiters, if you get scrambled by a cruiser you can switch to IN Multi and drop 800dps on their face. BUT it got fucked by the rise of the ram jag. You literally can never kill one no matter what. Jag on field = instantly cucked = warp or die.
---
Gnosis
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76651128/
---
Probably my favourite active tank brawler. It gets all the utility especially double webs and an mjd which allow you to kill frigs and escape kiters. The even resist profile is also amazing for active tank + reactive. Only downside is low dps.
---
Prophecy
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73757293/
---
Surprise! The kite prophecy is both unexpected and amazing. It’s not as slow as people think and it’s one of the only BCs that can fit double links, neuts and still get 400 plus dps past point range. Also triple medium neuts is amazing for killing tackle or messing up cruisers.
---
Faction BCs
---
Disclaimer: I don’t think you should brawl in a faction BC (other than the hull Navy Brutix because it’s cost effective) or you’ll get turbo dropped a lot.
---
Hurricane Fleet
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73318074/
---
I like this no tank full application fit. To be honest it’s only good in lowsec. If you want a tanker null fit check Takuya Gogiko’s killboard.
---
Drake Navy
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/71552447/
---
Great application, fast, decent tank and mjd. One of my favourite bcs. A little pricey and it really wants snakes to shine. Also will get fucked by ram jags.
---
Hope that helps
---
that would require them to commit to more than just collecting isk from ~~bots~~ renters
---

You know, this is a dumb attitude.  CVA had a 230 man fleet yesterday with nearly a hundred caps ready to commit over an astrahus, compared to 130 our character fleet and still managed to claw a loss from the fight.

The wyvern, espcially the older model, is such a great design. It's original, functional looking, aesthetically pleasing. A matter of taste perhaps but for me among the best looking ships in the game.
---
Poor hordeling, no one ever listens to him/her/it

Why aren't they all burned and melting?

Well described. Diplomatic mistakes were made (like giant blue donut coalitions) + retarded sov mecahnics and infinite resources.

Think about that for a second. When someone jumps into local, it'd make sense that they'd see the local channel and be able to chat in it. Right? For that to work, you'll need to join the channel. The xmpp server just queries the current members of that channel and reports them back to the client. If they wanted to implement something like hiding certain members on the channel, the easy (but shitty) way would be to have the client check if any of the reported members of that channel should be hidden temporarily as they are cloaked on a gate. The harder way would be to modify the xmpp server not to report all members until certain conditions are met (player drops gate cloak).
---
Or the other way to solve this would be that the person who enters a system won't be able to see local at all until he drops cloak (as he'll join the channel after his gate cloak drops).

Don't necessarily just vote for who your alliance tells you to vote for, take a moment to read the campaign topics if you haven't already but intend on voting, and vote for who YOU think should be on the CSM.

Oh shit you’re right. The medal is two sided indeed so they will be in xmpp’s client memory of this room (system local). Not joining local until decloak is a wise move. More skilled hunters is better!

Depends on what region of null you are in. In Delve, salvage only sold for like a fraction of the Jita buy prices and was absolute shit. Wasn't even remotely worth the time. But in other, less farmed regions, you could make decent money. So on paper it's a good way to make money, but in reality you need to check your local prices and/or figure out logistics of selling the salvage to a more profitable area. It's certainly not as easy as just collecting a bounty payment.

Nor should we. Replacing fundamental stuff is question of roughly a week, rest takes time indeed. The entire point though is a fact that this sov system ultimatelly destroyed the entire point of sov wars or any wars whatsoever as we knew it from the past. Now its like either you have numbers to toss shit or you dont, theres no other factor that matters.

---
Not joining local upon jump makes it significantly more time consuming to hunt people though. If you jump into a 100AU system and cannot see anyone in local, you need to choose between warping to a haven or warping to the next gate. If the system turns out to be empty as your fast aligning tackle ship has almost begun to warp, you'll have to just sit there waiting for it to land and then warp to the gate. This isn't a problem if you hunt in a Tengu for example as you can just cancel the warp.

So I guess my main issue with this is that it took a good bit to get involved in WH space and it can be fun, or boring as shit.  I don't really care about making ISK out there, I just want to shoot things.  I do also miss using my carrier a bit at the same point.

I am a bit interested in the new invasion stuff, curious if it is any fun at all, but PvP is my main interest at the moment.

The old newcastle meet used to do fairly well (Though I can only remember 3 occasions, 2 were ccp events (1 with a staggering amount of rain) and 1 was player ran)
---
IIRC `Angel of the north` was the ingame channel for that group, whether they still exist, idk.
---
Newcastle worked pretty well, fairly "central" in terms of travel, but the showing was basically newcastle, sunderland, teesside and a few from outside (including one guy, from like, japan? Who flew all the way just for a NE pub meet)

With the current PLEX prices buying votes must be really expensive~.

I got back in this week after a few years off. Invasions are ok. The main problem with invasions is the lack of organization when attacking a foothold system. I saw battleship after battleship warp in one after the other and get fucking smashed when they easily could have fleeted up. The good thing about them is you are almost guaranteed to have some looter go at one of your kills and get suspect status so you can kill them
---
Frog and PushX are really NCPL? I always thought they were Goons
---
mine too
---
I won't be doing that, but making them was only stage one. Stay tuned.
---
Huh alright.  I'd imagine there are likely some groups out there working on organizing with them.  I know when the Excursions happened, there were chat channels made and all sorts of organization that came about to run them in the most efficient manner.
---
Yep NCPL.
---
Where were all of you when us in goons were saying “*this fozzie sov is a really bad idea and these structure timers are dumb*”????? Oh yeah - kicking us from Deklein and parading about how much you loved it. Now the tides have turned - you are crazy to not have seen this coming.

I have a couple opportunities to join some big, massive alliance/corp if I wanted.  I almost want to find some small group that is trying to scratch their name into the dirt.  I could even go back to the WH group I was with before.  I used to be apart of a mercenary corp, but I don't really hear about mercs being really used anymore.  I guess it would be nice to find something a bit unique also... who knows.  I'm enjoying the discussion so far on this, thanks!

Market manipulation is a thing, that's for sure! Although again, you need a lot of ISK for most markets because the markets that you can manipulate with a moderate amount of ISK (&lt;1 billion) mostly lack the volume to be worth manipulating. You can manipulate it, but it will take years for you to liquidate your stock. There's also speculation, mostly driven by patches (ie: you think x ship or module is underpowered, so you buy a lot to eventually resell after a price increase), that also requires good in-game knowledge to predict patches. There are probably other trends you can analyze, but I'm not knowledgeable about that.
---
I'm not sure how many market manipulators/speculators there are in WoW, but there are plenty in Eve. Eve players are also a lot more into PvP, which includes Market PvP, so there is a lot of price manipulation and price speculation going on all of the time. You will have competition on that front ;). Also note that a lot of market manipulation/speculation can take months to liquidate the stock. Unless you are very lucky, you will rarely find "making a quick buck" to be a thing with trading. All profits usually come in the medium/long term.
---
So the passive vs active part usually refers to how and when you accumulate the assets or ISK. For example, mission running is active because you need to be on the keyboard to make ISK. Planetary Interaction (usually referred to as PI) requires you to log in every couple of days to reset your extractors + extract production, but it's considered passive because acquiring the assets happens in the background. It's the same thing for Station trading, acquiring ISK does not require you to be on the keyboard at all times. 
---
For the most competitive markets, you could probably say that clicking 2 buttons every 5 mins is active, but more time at the keyboard doesn't always equal more sales. In general, more effort or skill will lead to more sales, but there's a lot of luck involved. If another seller happens to change his price 2 mins after you do, and he gets the sale, all of your effort comes to nothing. The burning out part comes because the gameplay is very boring and the luck factor means that you can sometimes have multiple days in a row where you have no sales, especially if you only change your prices once a day.
---
All of this is compounded by the fact that you need an alt to stay docked in Jita to do your trading, but if you want the best margins, you need an omega account to get Broker Relations V and Accounting V (lowering broker fees and sales tax) and that's after grinding standings to lower the tax even more. This doesn't matter so much if you station trade with a small amount of ISK, but when you start dealing in billions, small percentages can make a sizable dent.

Well, we’ve had them in our system and it really isn’t that hindering, you just have to bit carful travel around in one because of the gate camps, but there is no anchorings in the camps and roaming groups, so all they do is web you into warp. I find the content it’s self quite fun to do as a group, and it encourages people to join to together and form fleets (impromptu public fleets have been happening) which, imo, is extremely healthy for the game, and lots of fun.

---
Algos is a cool ship. I rate it
---
absolutely not
---
Don't forget Xenuria!
---
The catch is an extremely low chance of dropping.  Lower than 1/50 by a considerable margin.  The drops are weighted.  The BPC is easily the rarest one ive ever seen drop.
---
If you disable d-scan while cloaked, sure.
---
yeah its quite the threat, isn't it?
---
These are generally pretty moderate plans, and I like them overall. The game needs a lot more room for small gangs, outside of wormhole space. Make it more important for an alliance to take a smaller response fleet to deal with an offensive gang.
---
I agree that the current state of Ansiblex gates was nothing but a mistake, and that polarization is not enough. Being able to travel to different stagings through a null empire without costing a jump clone is cool, using them for combat operations is less cool. My thought: massively increase the fuel multiplier by mass, and/or add a mass related fatigue timer.

There is not enough "no-ness" in my answer of no.

Learn what you're doing first. Also, you might still be in your noob system rather than a trade hub - everything other than the newbie mission supplies are extremely overpriced there, as people try to take advantage of people's lack of experience with the market.
---
Do your tutorial and career agent missions, poke around with the ships provided for those, and learn the basics of flying your ship. Unfuck your overview (search for Z-S Overview or Sarashawa's Overview), learn to use your Directional Scanner, and figure out your skill training plan for a little bit so you can fly what you want.

---
Are you slow? If bots react to local and you now have 60 seconds of not showing up in system, you can now hunt for nearby ratters before showing up. Depending on your warp time, etc you have a better chance of catching them. Make sense now?

&gt; Think the game should attract more players

I'd be hard pressed to find a candidate that didn't think attracting more players was a solid objective.  
---
Likewise, I would be hard pressed to find a candidate that had a half a clue as to how to achieve that beyond things like, "CCP market moar better!"  Not that I have anything better.
---
is there even a worse candidate?

So make brawling great again, being able to escape a fight the moment you don't have a 100% win is nothing but cancer on the game.

---
Both are great. Tristan and Algos. The navy comet is great for pvp. For ratting and running missions I prefer drones because it cuts out the ammo cost since your just trying to make money. Obviously the algos costs a little more than the Tristan. So if losing the Tristan hurt you financially maybe stick with a Tristan. But if your doing good and they’re both super cheap then why not Algos.

You know that's not how the CSM works, right?  CSM candidates don't make CCP do things.  They serve as a sounding board for CCP.  Maybe they can stop or tweak a bad idea, but voting for a candidate who promises to make "x" happen is a wasted vote.  Vote for people who can work with others, who have a broad knowledge base, and who are most likely to curb CCP's terrible ideas and tendencies.
---
wtf are you retards talking about why would we bUiLd aN eConOmYYyy we have like 150 people on discord anyone that we would fight that cares about eCoNomY and sUpER fOrCes has 1500 there’s literally no point and it’s not worth the pain of krabbing in rorquals and ratting to get blobbed gathering resources when we can just pvp retards and get rolled by blobs if we get blobbed
---
imo the idea of ccp implementing changes to hinder bots  is counterproductive since bots will always execute sequences better than humans and nothing stops them from changing fits and writing a few extra lines to alling on landing. That will result in you seeing less real people and more bots in the anomalies since it'll be more dangerous to rat and the rewards arent all that good... I exclude supers/titans from this. They will still be harder to catch sinteh the moment you decloak they'll initiate warp...
---
Doing some exploration to get isk, ducking into nullsec space for Sansha's relic sites, could serve you well for big money. Otherwise, hisec mission running can be a good start while you decide what to do next. Hisec mining is both boring and not very lucrative until you have a LOT of skills that only help with mining, so I recommend avoiding that entirely.
---
Ninja salvaging trig invasions can make you dank isk apparently too.
---
A moa will do low rated hisec missions fine, I think you'll need a bigger boat for L4s but I know nothing about missions.

I think it just comes down to nobody playing the game right now wants to put in real effort - even the dudes farming the Delve idiots want more assistance bc “*killijg krabs isn’t easy enough*”. That’s the fucking problem - everyone is making this game so god damn easy to participate then get butthurt with groups explode ahead of others.

Yes, FI.RE is at war with Winter Coalition (= Fraternity and allies)

In fact they started the "invasion" on Detorid you currently see run by TEST and some parts of Legacy. It was the same when they tried to take Tenerifis in the last months of 2018: They could not do it alone, they had to call in TEST to get the numbers to make actual progress.

time we remember this thread lol
---
I agree with you for the most part, but I see no problem with jump gates. You mentioned how people get trapped in pockets. Why is this an issue? Should a fleet not be able to protect their space? Any good FC will know where he's taking the fleet before moving out. If said FC gets his fleet trapped in a pocket, its his own fault. I've been on fleets before where we trapped some junior FC's in a pocket and they would not welp their t1 dessie's. We formed, camped, and they bat-phoned reinforcement. Then, we stomped the reinforcements. While that particular engagement had no reliance on jump gates, the fleet getting trapped in a pocket was still the same. 
---
Conversely, I've been on fleets into Frat space, where we knew we probably wouldn't make it back. Low and behold, when we got to a particular Frat system, we were immediately bubbled and dropped in my 2 Rags and thousands of jackdaws. We died with honor and glory. I'm sure a good majority of the fleet that welped us utilized jump gates. But it doesn't matter. We sought content and got it. We fought and died with honor and glory in a ball of wrecked caracals. By nerfing jump gates, you would be nerfing content. The bigger and superior fleet should always prevail. Sometimes it doesn't though, and that's where it gets interesting.
---
Yea, well effort like that kinda used to get a reward of some type.  Huge levels of focused autism brought some of the great heists, fights, espionage and conquests.  Most of thats been neutered to a point that its hard to justify those levels of commitment.

Epic Norb ! 😂
---
I voted for the return of the AT
---
I was thinking about something similar a few weeks ago...
---
"Wonder how many MTUs it would take to fully englobe Jita 4-4 at say, 1000km?"
---
But a whole star?  Ambitious.
---
Jin, I'm a huge fan of yours, but I think you dropped the ball here on your role as an interviewer. You can ask for further specification on a question if you felt not enough was answered. In fact it may have better illustrated that he didn't have an answer prepared. 
---
Disagreeing and arguing makes it a debate. That's fine by itself, but it differs greatly from the other interviews I heard you give. 
---
Basically you put him at a disadvantage relative to some of the other candidates. 
---
I still love your content and appreciate the work you put into these interviews though. Just my two cents.
---
 [New Eden Report](http://newedenreport.com/) \- In my opinion, the currently best and neutral institution when it comes to reports over fights and general happenings.
---
[Imperium News](https://imperium.news/) \- Run by Goonswarm and it's affiliates. While it has some very good articles about Eve in general, you should read articles of a political topic with a big grain of salt as you are likely to read a narrative favoring the group which renamed itself "The Imperium" a while ago but still is Goonswarm in its core. 
---
[EN24](http://evenews24.com/) \- A platform that tries to be more neutral, often shining a different light on things as Imperium News does.
---
[Crossing Zebras](https://crossingzebras.com/) \- No longer being actively maintained. It still may be interesting for the one who likes to dig in the past.
---
*~they are just bitter vets, they don’t know what the game needs nowadays~*
---
They were never supposed to run. But last year we got screwed over because Steadyo got banned from running for BS reasons, but CCP didn’t fix it in time to let him run. So, in case something similar happened this year to Gobbins, Arqui and Aeg both applied to run for CSM as a backup. Since Gobbins did get on the ballot there’s no reason for either Arqui or Aeg to be there, so that’s why they aren’t on our ballot
---
I will gladly vote for who I think should be on the CSM (which is exactly how my alliance wants me to vote).
---
Thank you for playing.
---
i mean we had 3 open spots for the ballot, could have just thrown em in *shrug*

The command processor rig allows you to activate both at once, additional rigs can allow up to 3 links.
---
Can't deny that 2012 EVE was much more enjoyable and much less broken balance-wise than 2019 EVE. There was a much better distribution of players across playstyles, and if you actually wanted to do something besides the current join major nullsec alliance and show up to citadel bash fleets/farm for your titan you had a much better experience than you do now.
---
Urd, you forgot this:
---
"This is not where i parked my Hel?" 
---
qoute of the month on comms :)
---
Just and update CCP responded today and the issue was solved within the hour of receiving the email. Very satisfied!
---
I couldn't put up the vote for anyone related to Goons or Test or PanFam. Nothing personal with guys coming from there, I really respect some of them, bu I believe they will have ballots that will put them there.
---
Feeling good there were few LowSec and WH guys I could put my votes for + some neutral people of that kind.
---
you can save your settings file.
---
No, that would be democraty.
---
Huh. Forgot about those. That could be p dece.
---
Do you guys live in WH space or visit to shoot the fish in the barrel?
---
Thank you I am good financially so I will try out a Algos.
---
Haha, nice.  Thanks!
---
Honestly I would like all the planets to get an overhaul. They are great but could be higher res and even more detail. Love having structures close to planets but planets kinda look a little fuzzy 😃
---
Stitch has that BSB support :)
---
I expected a little more detail to why the slot position matters.  So here is the quickie:
---
STV like what the CSM elections use makes it so you can vote for candidates that are "riskier" (i.e. not supported by large null blocks like Dunk here) but more preferred and then you can put safer candidates toward the bottom of your ticket.  If your 1st choice doesn't get in then your vote still counts.  If your candidates get eliminated from contention then your vote goes to the next available person on your rank sheet.
---
Great video.   well done
---
Gotg a shit
---
Join a small gang corp or a small gang sig in a bigger corp. I'm one of the guys running one out of Dreddit and it's been fun. You don't feel as important in a big corp, but you've got a fuckton of money backing up your stupid ideas. On the other hand in a smaller corp, you're a bigger fish in your pond, but you have to handle logistics more on your own.
---
&gt; If it's players wouldn't they be angry I took their loot and try to kill me?
---
Youre adorable.
---
But, but that requires independent thinking...
---
*shudder*
---
At least somewhere people are actually fighting even if outmatched.. love it!
---
Mercs do still get used, but they're a lil less common and a lot less openly recruiting.
---
Idunno, when I roll out a new doctrine I expect to eat shit to learn how it works a few times.
---
Wait, your telling me that a keepstar is useful for staging caps?
---
Well shit, TIL.
---
You can always just hit align to see what local looks like and then warp
---
Can you not read you moron? You responded to my comment where i specifically mentioned bots.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Probably not a good idea to commit so many caps if you don't know how to fly your primary subcap fleet.
---
Hey duder. Welcome. Got isk? Cool. Yeah, mess around with the algos, do more of the career agent missions and learn to make some isk, then go pvp and lose a bunch of tristans once you've got some fitting/support skills (drones v is pretty mandatory, t2 light drones, etc).
---
RTFMission if you're into missioning, yeah.
---
See, some 'guys' are just out for themselves, but other 'guys' will be straight with you. My only advice is to mention your tz, since that will probably rule out 2/3s of the suggestions.
---
If your alliance is too small to have a JF service you're also too small for NCPL to care about damaging their hauling rep fucking you over.
---
excuse me sir, that one is about NC. PL is dead. Please use your two jokes correctly.
---
Are you playing Alpha? If so, you'll definitely need to separate the two due to the skill point cap. 
---
If you are playing Omega, you *can* do both on the same character but, it's highly recommended to keep PVP and PVE characters separate for various reasons. 
---
Frigates aren't that great for PVE other than some specific circumstances, most of which aren't ideal for new players. 
---
They are, however, great for PVP. The easiest to get a fight in and the easiest on your wallet to lose.
---
Pretty sure Kaneland has a pretty good chance.
---
Yeah no. It's a better recommendation for small gang than to suicide a pile of caps.
---
If it’s a ceptor and you’re within 14 au of the gate, you’re going to be screwed if you’re in an overprop VNI, unless you’re lucky and happen to be on the other side of the haven from the warpin.
---
Is thealphasguide.com a good site to learn fits or no?  And yes I have isk to play around with. I play back in 2014 with a friend but he pretty much gave me ships and told me to follow and attack what he was attack so I kinda learn how to play but at the same time I didn’t.
---
&gt;Isn't this the Phoenix parked in the COSMOS site in Tenal?  The Phoenix itself  is piloted by a COSMOS agent.
---
i dont know/ i sold it 6month ago:)

Yeah, I'm looking for straight forward.  I'm US East Coast.  I just don't have time to putz around and I am hoping for the ability to drop out if needed as well, I do have a kid and wife to worry about.
---
can I get a zkill guide to voting pls
---
You do at least give a momentary pause for considering what comes out of your mouth, right? It just sounds stupid is why I ask
---
Was very chaotic, but very fun, 10/10 would participate again.
---
It's almost like you just want to sound dumb
---
While it is possible, due to the nature of the game's character skill progression, people will oftenly have alts specialized in the different facets.
---
Say you have a character that you can immediately start training some solid core skills and then specialise in PVP roles you want to fill, if you start training mining/industry it will take a detour which could take a while. If you had a second account, you can train both side by side.
---
Considering you're still a beginner, I guess it wouldn't hurt to give it a try on your main toon. Get a taste for it, of course you dont need to immediately load up a 6 month skill queue. Worst case scenario, the Battle Venture is an actual thing, so is the Dual Web + Scram Procurer, so it wont be lost time.
---
Fit 20 cheap frigates and have them all blown up in Faction Warfare PVP
---
I'd disagree on the splitting your main thing. If you're omega do whatever you like with your main. I have all sorts because I don't like to use alts and just about all of the mains of my corpmates are skilled up for combat and some indy skills.
---
I've never actually played in Faction Warfare before.  I've thought about it, but never really have been sure on it.
---
I'll probably start by playing alpha and if I like the game upgrade to Omega
---
Also total noob question:
---
Can you make several character on same account, sharing the Omega or you have to pay for each
---
What are the benefits of having separate pve/pvp character except skill acquisition? isn't there inconvenient as well?
---
As I understand it skill acquisition IS fixed over time and not action dependent ( mining doesn't improve your mining skill) so that would be the main reason to split character (twice the skill acquisition rate)
---
And I bet it's nice to have something to do..... since you never leave the house.
---
Find a friendly corp to join, listen to their advice but learn at your own pace.   
---
Don't feel bullied to miss out on trying different career paths, some people love mining, others despise it, some people hate PvP, others live for the thrill.
---
Don't try to rush into big ships too fast, they can be useful and fun, but are super-ineffective without good base skills. (I have 125mil skillpoints, and spend 95% of my time in cruiser hulls and smaller.)  
---
Make some mistakes, lose some expensive sh\*t and most important enjoy yourself.
---
If you're on one account, I recommend getting combat skills sorted and using some form of them (missions, anoms) or low investment skills like Archaeology to make isk early on. :)
---
Yeah I totally agree - Not overly happy with how this went and my conversation with him afterwards was a lot better. 
---
He found his way onto my ballot this year, this interview didn't really manage to show what he offered as a candidate and I didn't do enough to work with him as an interviewer to allow him to express it.
---
You have it exactly right
---
Help the guys that farmed us for years and pushed us into the hands of goons? Well, that day will come. But that is not today man...
---
Whoah there, Eve is a sophisticated piece of gaming software that requires no less than an IQ of 140 to log in to the servers. Are you actually implying that this person is smart enough to have the brain power to run Eve in parallel with another piece of software? Amazing!
---
U can do it all with us!!!!! 
---
We are BO-LD and we reside within Test Alliance Please Ignore. We attempt to kill everything (no freighters pls) and sometimes make decent memes. Our goal is to make an effective and lethal close-knit group with a family-like community. We want members who want to be a part of our community and share our goal .
---
To add onto this idealistic Corp shit, we take no bullshit when it comes to things that stops us being an effective fighting group. We also understand that EvE is a game you play to have fun and we support you to have fun however you want to.
---
What we offer:
---
Regular fleets in most time zones. Easy access to content in Catch/Detorid and surrounds. Safe and Secure money making opportunities in Esoteria. Alliance level and corp level logistics/contracts. PVP focussed mentorship - and ‘what to do’ advice from our various experiences. Expanding numbers of Corp Athanors for dank isk. Warm and fuzzy levels of hazing for non compliant players, a relaxed atmosphere.
---
What we want:
---
Well rounded dudes with their own drive to be better players. Willingness to fleet up when able. Protect your bros - don't mine during stratops. A healthy level of integration. Ability to fly rorqs/caps/supers/titans is a plus. Life comes first, but do your best.

Can actually confirm. We are a german wh corp. Even though small, we are already known to a certain point. So far nobody tried to evict us, didn't even shieldtimer any structure.
---
We generally undock, take almost every bait (Eve rule #3: Always take the bait. Always.) and undock even with lesser numbers (Ofc we are not doing harakiri at 1:117, but 1:1 is pretty sure a fight, 1:2 might still be a fight, too.). We also almost never camp any entrances/holes for cheap kills if there is not a goddamn good reason for it and drop no capitals (because we don't have any lol).
---
Turns out people mostly like us so far, have no issue with us and don't want to evict us. We get GFs a lot. Our KB might look horribly inefficient, but we have fun and no eviction threats so far. So we must do some things right.
---
Given they can’t tell who you voted for unless you said who you voted for I call bullshit
---
new pod skin incoming
---
Come and see for yourself, join one of the best alliances in New Eden. You can do whatever u want. I feel safer in our space than i do in hisec. 
---
Vote who you think is not a complete moron and can actually do something good for the game. That should narrow it down.
---
I want to see a planets asshole as much as the next guy.
---
It's for your loot to escape!!!
---
There are 3 character slots per account. 
---
By default only 1 can be training a skill at a time, but you can purchase an item that gives you the ability to run 2 or 3 characters' skill queues on the same account. 
---
As for separating characters based on their use, there's a few reasons, as I mentioned. 
---
In Ye Olde times there were two big reasons:
---
The first is that some corps and alliances were anal about doing PVE on PVP characters because they didn't want PVE losses showing up on their killboards. 
---
The second is that before skill injectors, buying and selling characters was a popular way to make money and having a streamlined, focused skill set on a character would make them more valuable. 
---
These days, however there are still plenty of reasons. 
---
For one it's easier to keep them separate for future proofing. If you get attached to the game enough you'll eventually, likely, have multiple accounts; having each character be specialized will make it easier to keep track of what you are doing.
---
Similarly to the above, having your PVE/Industrial character separate from your PVP one lets you keep your PVE and Industrial activities in a different part of the cluster than your PVP activities. 
---
For instance, right now the Goons are waging ~~bore~~ war on the other side of the cluster from their home territory. So having your characters separated by focus would let you be on the front lines with your PVP ships while still being able to do your industrial and PVE work in the downtime without having to waste your jump clone timer or fly across the entire cluster.
---
We have missed u arfuss, this time fit your supers right and dont make dumbass under table deals. Always welcome in GE
---
If you don't vote, you have no right to complain about the outcome or the next CSM. So just vote :D

Just create trial Prime accounts to get the Twitch Prime PLEX.

Hey no worries man. You should do this next year. Listened to just about the whole series of interviews.

He found his way to my ballot too. 
---
Fly dangerous
---
Hm.... so far best one was probably "[The Grand Little Scoop](https://thegreybill.wordpress.com/2019/04/15/the-grand-little-scoop/)" shortly followed by "[A Fax for Free](https://thegreybill.wordpress.com/2018/10/06/and-a-fax-for-free/)".
---
But those are no real heists. The problem with a heist is that if you tell people about it, it may not work a second time. I would have another fun story to tell - and despite it did not work out in the end - the planning-part, contacting people in discord, figuring out details, doing some math, was great fun alone.  
---
Can recommend shady "gameplay" in Eve a lot. It's great fun, would do again.
---
Never 'stole' from a corporation I was part of though. And I don't plan to because I like my reputation and rather be in a decent corp/alliance. I have only one account and this kind of things would require me to join and spend time with a corp and people I don't like. No thanks.
---
He decided not to run again.
---
Not gonna lie, I laughed. You should do more of these!
---
I've wargamed this out in my head a lot. I think this is a really good change.
---
1) This is a big nerf to bot-like ratters, who are programmed to pull drones and turn&amp;burn on local contact. Most bots will not respond to intel networks right now showing hostiles 1-2 jumps away, because they don't need to. They can safely wait for the hunter to hit local and can escape with drones with ease.
---
With this change, it's going to be way less likely that a botter will be able to keep their drones, and in some cases potentially even manage to get their align off if the inty pilot is really good.
---
This will have an exponential damaging effect on botting activity since they will have to respond to regional traffic, not just local traffic. "Legit" subcap ratters will be able to get by with more creative fits, particlarly non-oversized-prop fits that offer reasonable align times.
---
2) For fleet dynamics, you'd still get gate flash before decloak, so people who are actively watching a gate will still have a solid idea that something is coming through.... the new gate graphcis could even have some sort of visual indicator as to HOW MUCH is currently coming through... so that way people can still differentiate between a solo Astero and a 200 man eagle fleet..... as long as they're on grid with the gate, and only if.
---
I love using frigates for PvE when I'm not really supposed to. I find them to be a lot more fun to use than drone boat cruisers. A decently-skilled blaster Enyo can out-DPS a decently skilled Vexor, and its tank (when combined with its speed tank) can happily out-tank that same Vexor. No worrying about managing drones, and the price for the hull and fitting are about the same in the end.
---
Serpentis-Phi Outposts are a good example - My Enyo can run the site a heck of a lot faster than my Vexor. My Gila can do it just a little bit faster than my Enyo. The Incursus is technically capable of running the site but the DPS with perfect alpha skills just barely eclipses the reps of the overseer, so it takes forever.
---
Make lot of Sense.
---
So to sum up:
---
Double XP with an item you can buy ig ( with ISK?)
---
Allow to sell your char or send it to another account
---
Your pve/pvp activities might be on different location and it would be a hassle to transport your shit from one place to the other
---
I don't really see it making keeping tracks easier but that's probably just me.
---
It probably comes from playing Albion where skill XP is action dependent (need to perform the action to get XP) and everything is simple to keep track of with the skill wheel
---
Am I missing something?
---
Follow up question:
---
Is it really beneficial to have more than 3 character?
---
How many career can one perform?
---
It will drive conflict, High-Sec isn't supposed to be safe, it's just supposed to have security for the newbeans.
---
Rip
---
Well, just step into my office then good sir...
---
Well, i somewhat feel that multiboxing or any kind also breaks the balance a bit :(.
---
What's the goon ticket this year so I know who not to vote for?
---
But not being able to use dscan while gatecloak as well, right, right?
---
Or is only one side of perfect information system bothering you?
---
I am a huge fan of this ship. I often appreciate some of the most hated ships in the game for their superb design however.
---
lol, that must be a super awkward situation... \^\^

---
&gt; Jin'taan asks about the possibility of making it so people wouldn't appear in local until they drop gate
---
cloak. There's a joke from the CCP side about having demonstrated their ability to have people not
---
show in local. Oh snap. Burn.
---
I personally like this idea a tonne.
---
Typical boomer
---
Yes, they are fun. However, not really the best thing for a new player, like OP, to strive for. 
---
Haven't paid attention to FW so idk if they are still farmable with bombers, but there's also burner missions that frigate focused too. 
---
I personally like smaller ships the most. The account I have most fun on for PVP doesn't fly anything bigger than a destroyer. Because there it just so much versatility in the Frigate and Destroyer hulls.
---
Tying it to cloak is basically a compromise.      
---
Just delaying it by 1 minute each gate means they are in your face before showing up in local.
---
I realize that this is a dream scenario for small gang PvPers, but it will probably just as much opposed by PvE focused players as removing local completely would.      
---
If one side wants one thing and the other the opposite it's nice if daddy has a compromise at hand so neither feels left out.
---
If you have different characters on the same account do they share wallet?
---
How could you! D:
---
The way he says 'what the FUCK dude' is my go to response when I'm surprised since I saw that clip back in the day
---
So not only did this guy waste all that other time...  he wasted time making a shitpost on r/Eve?
---
What word do we use here?  Pwned?  Wreckt?
---
Why would you join Goons if you're in INIT?
---
Having backups of configs to asspain systems pays off, who knew
---
was great fun, i enjoyed being logi and not having to do anything seeing as everything was dying instantly
---
The who what now?? How do I get this Twitch Plex
---
*plays curb your enthusiasm theme*
---
Given enough time and Isk a character can do everything. But that'll either take literal years or a lot of billions in isk for skill injectors. 
---
If you get into the big alliance scene and really want to get into the deep end, then it's likely you'll find yourself with a dozen or more characters. 
---
A single character is still limited on how many industrial jobs you can produce at a time, or how much planetary materials you can harvest. If you want to become a major producer you have no choice but to have another character with those same skills. 
---
For the advanced production stuff, the amount of skills required is high enough that it's more economic to have 2 characters that are specialized for building a few different things each, than to have 1 that can build everything. For both skill investment and for the number of production lines you can have running at once. 
---
For high end PVP stuff, you'll likely be asked to be running 2 or more characters at a time on the same fleet. 
---
For example, having a Cyno alt (beacon for jump drives and titan bridges) or an interdictor alt ( Destroyer sized ship that puts bubbles in space that you cannot warp in or out of) while on a fleet is an extremely useful ability to have. Especially for smaller groups where they may not be able to afford giving up a DPS ship for either of those roles. 
---
On the largest end, if you one day find yourself in a Super Carrier or Titan fleet, you'll also likely be expected to have one other character in a support capital as well as a third character in the main fleet. 
---
Starting out, there's not too much to worry about or keep track of, but starting off with the future in mind will definitely save you some headaches if you find that you want to do some more high end activities.
---
Nice!
---
It’s not actually plex. It’s added game time of like two weeks if you claim the twitch prime eve rewards. If you want to extract those two weeks worth of sp and sell them, you can do that.
---
Ahh ok
---
Does anyone have a sense of what the total liquid isk wallet of a major nullsec alliance is?
---
Trillions? Hundreds of trillions? Quad?
---
Blocked in your country? VPN or proxy to the US maybe
---
I guess they never got the "the client is always compromised" lesson
---
The "And Friends" bit was BL.
---
This just incentivizes Near2 like intel handling. The difference would be to warp out when a hunter is reported in the system next door, instead of the current one. Would it get more people killed? Probably. Does it really change the meta? No. Does it inconvenience bots? Not really, at best bot developers need to change a few things about threat detection mechanics.
---
What we really need are anomalies that ships can't just leave anytime there's a hint of danger and also potentially restrict cynos. Like abyssal space, ratting and mining should be a minor time commitment that gives hunters time to catch up to you. Obviously unlike abyssal space everyone would be able to follow you into the site as well as no sudden death mechanic.
---
I didn't say they couldn't you moron.
---
Really useful thanks for your efforts.
---
To be fair most of the games I play like 80-95% of the time industry and the remaining time either pve or pvp depending on the game
---
Also is your wallet shared accross the characters of one account?
---
That site is pretty outdated, unfortunately. The [Eve University Wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) is a great resource. They have mostly-up-to-date reference fittings for every ship and a lot of tutorials.
---
Why don't more elections work this way? This seems smart.
---
That's a good point. I'd personally suggest OP get into exploration for a bit to build up some spending ISK then experiment with different career paths to find out what they enjoy.
---
Having two alphas(on different accounts), one for subcap combat and the other for industry will double your SP aquisition, you'll progress at max alpha speed.om both accounts. If you later on decide to omega up you will have several options. You can omega both and reap the benefits of being able to dualbox. You can omega just one and keep the other as alpha, or you can transfer one of the characters over to the other account.
---
So, create one alpha for each distinct path in the game you think you'd want to explore and train them all.
---
Mostly because the people that make the election laws aren't impartial.
---
Eve University is a good place for a new player to start, you can learn the basics until you decide how you want to play. Join here. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University
---
Because for many alliances its the only way to earn ISK without recruiting retards to mine for you
---
It is not. Some people use 3rd party tools to track that kind of stuff. 
---
Personally I have 1 character set up as my 'Bank' character. The only skills it has is for market skills and it is docked in the main trade hub (Jita) of the game and never moves. It buys the stuff my alts need and gets them shipped to where I need them. Stores my isk and other inventory that isn't being used. 
---
Another good use for an additional character. Most people have a 'Jita Alt'.
---
You're the one who jumped into our conversation about bots and started talking about human ratters. Whether you _mentioned_ bots or not is completely irrelevant.
---
If you can't even read, you should consider a less complicated game than EVE.
---
It is so you can go down to the surface to interact with your PI network
---
I hate it, but what can we do. Serious thought gas been put into this, maybe if we change the way ratting works or maybe if we add a captcha every 30 minutes. Idk, what do you think we should do?
---
tr00f
---
EVE is about waiting around so you can shoot fish in a barrel.
---
The Goon Gevlon
---
Exploration is a great way to start in the game. Some of the larger new player friendly corps will also hand them out for free.
---
I meant [this](https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/7/18535615/mcu-phase-4-movie-dates-marvel-disney).
---
He is trying to get stuff to a location his Alliance doesn't serve.
---
holy shit look at that comment history
---
Haha totally approve, we ran similar propaganda pieces back in 401K's Branch campaign against CFC, and when Goons decided to 'hellcamp' 6NJ to lock us in.

With jump bridges, extra jump range and no jump fatigue, the first group to build the cap fleet/infrastructure wins nullsec. It would be even worse on anybody who doesn't start day 1, because people who start capital alts who beeline will have that fleet up and running while regular dudes are getting their DRAEK on.
---
Ok totally doing that, what are market skills? I mean isn't the economy player made?
---
It is. Its what you get from me at 545 am and shitty McDonald's coffee.

this is some low quality bait

What is this on?

Why is it my fault that you are a sheep who believes that wars are fought for humanitarian reasons?

---
It is player made, which is why having the skills for market stuff in the game is important. It allows people who want to focus on market trading able to spend time/isk to be able to have a small advantage over any random person who wants to get in on the market. 
---
 - There are Taxes that can be lowered with the right skills. 
---
 - There is a limit to the number of active buy and sell orders that a single character can have. Both can be increased with skills. 
---
 - There is a limit to the number of contracts a character can have open at once that can also be increased. 
---
 - There is the ability to have buy orders open where the total isk needed to purchase everything is less than the total isk you have. The margin trading skill allows you to be able to do that (As well as some of the oldest scams in the game that people still fall for).

The first one for sure. We couldn't ignore PH, though.

I'm just waiting for the first group to do trackable ballots. :D Just to see what the outcome is.
---
It's been doable for years, but you need to provide each member with a unique ballot.
---
have you considered that the NWO are the reason eve has bots, and hilmar is a part of big pharma?
---
don't worry.  You have safety in numbers.
---
that overly dramatic [text inserts...](https://media.giphy.com/media/ARCBFeHuMVyWQ/giphy.gif)
---
sheeple, and zionists, and deep state, Oh My....
---
I've never been entirely sure what said service would entail, tbh. Other than holding large quantities of isk and lightly skimming.
---
Eve does not have the worst botting problem in the history of MMOs lol. Not even close.
---
Remember runescape?
---
Yeah we beat that one into the ground for a bit, there was even a charity appeal video with Sarah McLachlan's Angel as the backing music, it was very dramatic.
---
Look forward to seeing what you come up with!
---
Olmeca, Stitch, [Matterall](https://zkillboard.com/character/95269590/). Please don't vote big blocks
---
Not even just "remember" it tbh. The shitstorm about how prevalent bots are is still ongoing today in OSRS. The devs *say* they "ban 100,000 bots a week" but there's tens of thousands more that exist for months/years just fine.
---
not really, no
---
Made it sound like you shot the supers..
---
Naysaying from a position of ignorance.  Idiots like you are what is wrong with the world.
---
Yep.  The Hulk BPO monopoly was one of the major driving forces behind finally getting CCP to realize invention was necessary.
---
Person a want to sell a citadel, 2nd buy it.      
---
Without trusted third party each can scam other.      
---
Third party can hold the isk, and transfer it to old structure owner when the deal was completed.
---
r/woosh
---
People owning so many accounts do break the balance. I agree. Even if I'm one of those people.
---
On the Nestor
---
and? you won't be able to tackle him anyway if the bot is half decent, only *maybe* if they are overpropped and you get quite lucky. Trying to make this change about bots is a waste of time, its a potential good change for players and thats it, bots have been in the game since its inception, this reddit panic is just a fad.
---
Who?
---
It's like if you asked Van Gogh to paint what a gas planet would look like lol, nice.
---
Sad but true. A man on the CSM with literally no legitimacy other than his ability to buy votes.
---
Ok thanks for your explanation
---
So basically I should have:
---
One banking/trading account
---
At least 2 pvp character
---
One (or more ?) Pve character
---
Several industry character with different specialties to be able to produce high tech vehicles
---
I will probably start with one account for one or two weeks and the create a few others
---
The banking one and the rest to have 2 pvp 2 industry and 2 pve to care for the future if that make sense
---
No, you have to transfer isk between them manually. Select that character in "people and places", right click, "give money", and make damn sure it's yours. Most people don't give back random money. :P
---
Thanks, needed to know who all the extra peeps were. 
---
Shart Dragon? :D
---
Mike is running! Mike, Mike, what day is it?
---
something something nullsec safer than highsec something
---
They probably still won't hose you, but idk, there any record of them hosing enemies of NCPL in the past?
---
Isn't Astarte a T2 command Battlecruiser? 
---
I must be losing something here... Are those rare/event exclusive ships? O.o
---
Damn, I already lost by voting for you and Dunk.
---
and Mike, he knows what day it is...
---
ok then don't use an overpropped vni if you don't want to take the risk? the game has like 200 ships and countless ways to fit shit. Theres a reason people don't really rat in dreads in kspace, and lack of efficiency isn't really it(for the most part at least)
---
Your title is deceptive.
---
Both the developers and the players care about removing botters from the game.
---
Ultimately however there is this real world concept called budget allocation, and as business finances are limited unless they're financed by a Sheikh or the cocaine trade, the business officers must pick and choose how they apply their finance; for a product that requires replenishment of users over time (due to the subscription nature of the game), this will eat up the bulk of their finance, and then will come product improvement, modernization, and so forth.

Classic test victim card
---
Station Trading was actually the reason I got EVE in the first place. Are there any good guides out there?
---
Erm... could you explain this in newb terms please? I can't really understand that much...
---
The CFC is the Clusterfuck Coalition, which used to be what Goons called their coalition and to this day some people who aren't fans of rebrandings. What Killah Bee has to do with this conversation beats me tho. Unless you think i'm him in which case the true retard here is you.
---
I know what it is. However the CFC doesn't exist anymore. Pure retardation would see folks still calling it that. 
---
And yeah. I assumed you were him just flair baiting. Since he seems to take the shit slung at him in stride.

Hold my hand
---
joke's on you you're on the test ballot
---
Sorry for the late reply!
---
1. What would you say is the best way to gain capital to start station trading?
---
2. How often to I need to log on to manage sell orders and buy orders?
---
3. When does station trading start becoming worth it to do in between other things?
---
4. Would jump clones work for going to Jita? How often can you use jump clones with max skills?
---
5. For market manipulation, are there any good guides out there?
---
6. For market manipulation/speculation, I understand that it would take a while, most of my income would be from relisting and sell-buy orders.
---
7. Eventually, if you're rich enough to list enough things, could you theoretically be relisting every second of playtime?
---
8. The main reason I don't think it would get too bored is because I would also do market manipulation/speculation, which would require a lot of interesting work. How reasonable is this?
---
9. Could you give me an example of market manipulation in EVE?
---
The reason I'm so interested in this is because it's actually what I joined EVE for. It's not that anybody suggested this to me, I simply am very interested in
---
It does exist, it just runs under a different name now.
---
Raider still exists too, just that it's now called Twix.
---
But it doesn't. It wasn't a rebranding. But also a restructuring of the entire coalition.
---
Cringe
---
I agree http://imgur.com/gallery/qslkBXI
---
Spending hours clicking dscan literally every 2 seconds sounds like fun to you?
---
As an alpha you should probably just have 1 character. Maybe 2 accounts so you can train 2 characters at the same time.
---
The game has no issue finding new players. It has issue keeping them. and IMO, the game shouldn't thrive to attract all the new players as not all are interested in what Eve has to offer. Many could be kept with better IG tutorial, non shit overview, removing a few boring and long to train skill etc. And also a big overall of IG PvE and rewards, but there are many points I could make about ll that.
---
Any way, I want more players. The game attract them well. keeping the one are interested beyond the lies of the marketing is what we need.
---
because apparently most bots run VNIs.
---
when you look at how to fly a VNI, it practically bots itself - it's not like a bot running a VNI is providing that much input since as a player you're not providing that much input either. the fact that some guy can do it for a few more hours a day than me doesn't bother me all that much.
---
there are a myriad of other things in eve that bother me a hell of a lot more than a few VNIs grinding for a few more hours per day than most players do.
---
As part of his plea deal he cant run again.
---
https://psychcentral.com/blog/maybe-the-problem-is-you/
---
Ok thanks
---
How much work is it to get that item that allow you to train two characters on one account and how does that work? limited amount of time/ unlimited etc
---
Yeah no, not really.
---
No, it doesn't. The bot and spam problems in Eve are laughably small compared to more popular titles. Take a Valium and chill weirdo.
---
Dunk is definitely not a lock, he needs your votes!
---
If three years ago you told me he would be the best candidate on the ticket I would have died laughing. Fast forward and it turns out the biggest joke in eve is actually sort dragon. What is the universe coming to?
---
Nice try, clown, but i've had far too many accomplishments that strongly suggest i'm a cut above the rest of you sheeple.  The best part about the internet is that I don't have to be nice to ignorant morons like yourself.

Awesome work!

For a newbro dont even think about it. Its 2 billion Isk.
---
you will be lucky to earn 30 mill an hour as a new player.

Multiple character on one account training is an endgame or real money kinda thing.
---
I'm not the one who lives on the forum of a shitty bot-infested video game, kid. :)

As far as I know TEST usually only gets batphoned in USTZ. Why would we batphone in EUTZ for the armor timer of an Astrahus?
---
mods pls don't ban him this is more fun than watching people figure out the dinobrain bot
---
Mopp
---
Thank you
---
EVE players have protested before but they have not done so in a major way against botting.
---
Eve is kind of like botting just playing it normally
---
is this retarded advertising for your terrible corp or what
---
Oh ah. Thankfully there is no snap in EVE :P
---
Even a troll gotta have a few screws loose to produce this kind of diarrhea ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I tried but the deep state deleted my posts.
---
Yes and according to lore even 1 isk is equivalent to 10k USD to a normal human living in EVE's universe
---
So when next time you check your 100m tick, think about the starving children
---
Why? Is paying attention too hard for you?
---
Maybe a bot can do better than a simpleton such as yourself. A human player will need to pay attention to Intel and maybe even put alts on gates. Not something a bot will do. Again, you're a moron
---
Mostly because it would be wasted effort.
---
EVE player protests have usually arisen when there is a divide between what the players believed and what the developers believed (or were perceived to believe).
---
On this occasion both sides are aligned. Protests would serve no purpose since CCP already know and already agree with your position.
---
If you wanted to get a more proactive reaction out of this I would start a petition where 4,000-5,000 players agreed to purchase a 1 year subscription to the game immediately so that CCP could focus some of their resources away from worrying about other avenues of the game and onto bothunting.
---
Failing that, you will have to accept that CCP are doing what they can, when they can, and perhaps could be more transparent in communicating about it, but other than that, you will have to largely accept it in it's current format.
---
Thanks for advocating for it.
---
I won’t vote for a goon block vote. However, that said, X is still getting my vote(s).
---
Basically because he is quite combative and irritating. 😊
---
Let's think outside the box here. Supers are on field murdering your cap fleet which means you have no counter escalation left. So, if by chance you could keep them tackled, who could come kill them? Poppa Test. There's why you would batphone TEST.
---
hey you butthead im the director of black frog and i am a part of neither. so are most haulers that work for BFF. in fact some BFF  haulers are a part of old black legion (now scattered to the winds and all over the map), snuff, shadow cartel (rip), rote kapelle, and believe it or not goons.
---
Ok make it harder for them. If you are so cowardly you can't stand the thought of having to fight another person make it as hard as possible. If you don't like that stay out of 0.0/lowsec.
---
I was there, nice catch on the cyno ceptor.

VNIs don't even make much lol. A well skilled vni might make like 60mil/hr.

Question to the ССP. To the boss.
---
When will the configuration files stop being reset? In 5 months I was faced with the need to re-configure everything 7 times already! When will the normal import and export of custom settings? Copy 2 GB and 15,000 files every 3 days? Especially since this last time did not work. People lose tens of thousands of hours because someone cannot program to save the settings of each account in a small text file! This is extreme incompetence! Who from the management can already solve this question!

Yes. A full minute to dscan would allow new guys to hone them skills.
---
- apply right filters (high-pass filter)
---
- some compression
---
- bit EQ up on the low end
---
Came lookin for a post about an epic revenge heist, found someone who got bored, abused trust and walked off with belongings to spite the people they were 'befriending'. 2 years of work and you got 10b each?
---
It's posts like this that make me glad I'm winning eve and just shit posting on reddit instead.
---
you can easily get 10b ratting in highsec - even more once you get into incursions. I paid for my first Fanfest with plex from Incursions - 11b in less than a year.

It's usually fairly quiet in amarr space, for example. It also depends if you mean seeing them nearby you (on grid) or just in local. Even within a single system there can be many asteroid belts or stations where people could be!
---
LOL
---
This is some serious "when did you stop beating your wife" type shit.
---
Generally most people sell the raw ore, especially in hisec. Regular ores can be compressed at a nearby player structure that has the reprocessing service (check the structure browser) for easier transport to market.
---
Your belief that protests against bottling would be wasted effort aren't founded on any logic.  There are certainly people who aren't satisfied with CCPs pathetic efforts to curb botting and their justifications are well founded.
---
Protests would serve a purpose because it could definitely force them to do something about it, especially if there are calls to boycott.  If a few thousand people boycotted the game they would definitely do something about bots in the next content update rather than hit or miss additional content.
---
Always thought it was a bit wierd that a blood raider, someone who literally murders civilians to obtain their  blood, would  be upset about families
---
lmfao yeah no bots would neeeever use intel channels, that's definitely not one of the most popular usecases. I love when you idiots double down on your stupidity so everyone can see how clueless you are.
---
Ok, I'll probably have to talk to EQ 11 about exactly how to do this, but thank you
---
eve dead, come back in 5 years when they finally finish the mobile version and add battle royale

---
botting in EVE has arguably a far greater impact due to the nature of the game since wealth and numbers is the greatest contributing factor to pvp domination in EVE.
---
So basically you're saying you're to risk adverse to deploy in the EU timezone? 🤔
---
Seems odd they would ban you for that...I'd bet it was a mistake, or you were/seemed to be abusing something to get free omega time.
---
As a first-time player, start with one thing and then the other.  Focus your skill Q on the specific skills that drive you toward your goal.  Once you can do said goal competently, then you could think about exploring other branches of the skill Q. The great thing is, if you don't like what you're doing, then simply switch gears into whatever else you're interested in.
---
Why do you have to be such a worthless clown?  Get a life, reddit trash
---
If you have to ask this question the answer is no
---
Game is f2p so just try it out and find the answer for yourself
---
If it goes through then gets rescinded you get banned because you owe money.
---
You should be able to. I've never had it happen to me but I know people in the past have gotten it fixed. Just file a support ticket. They're usually very helpful.
---
It's possible people are using them more against assault frigates, I'll have to check market trade graph volume and get back to you.

It is actually pretty amusing watching dumb kids like you lose their shit whenever someones criticisms your favorite vid game.  
---
How mad were you on a scale of 1 to gordon ramsey when PC gamer wrote that article? :)
---
Usually just at work then
---
The number of players who bot is so small it's not having as much of an impact as you think. It's not like entire alliances are botting. And when they get banned, they track where the isk went and remove/ban the account that benefited.
---
The Eve Novel 'The Burning Life' goes really deep into this. It's a fun read for some deeper lore.
---
[Captain's Yacht](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Captain%27s_yacht)

In my experience it wears out fast, and ruins your standings to such a degree you can't fly easily in whoever you were enemied to.  That and I've never liked small ship combat may have colored it poorly for me.
---
Who are these people?
---
hole men
---
Yep. They also help CCP by bringing issues to the forefront that they might not be aware of.
---
Original Nestor design had shuttle bay just for this.
---
Not odd, but I think it's fairly common as iirc both Xbox and Playstation will ban your accounts for charge backs on various related things.

[This page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Template:ShipsMatrix) contains links to the specific pages for every ship in the game. There's a lot of 'em!
---
[This page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Fitting_Guidelines) gives you general guidelines on how to fit a ship. This is tried-and-true advice, but it's totally fine to deviate from it too once you've figured out what you're doing!

---
&gt;NC. hard reset Horde and was on GotG’s side of the fight
---
I think i heard from both Sort and i think even Killah bee in a podcast (maybe talking in stations) that NC. basically decided to stay on the sidelines after the reset with horde, so they weren't participating on anyone side, and recently in talking in stations Sort Dragon said he saw this as his casus belli to join the war against Panfam.
---
I'm however curious about the fallout of the deal though, from what Sort said it, as well as Killah indicated when the deal was first announced, NC. was in full acknowledgement of the deal, meaning that  they were consulted during the negotiations, which is weird, because Horde actions and now what you and NC. are saying seem to indicate that they were caught by surprised by the deal.
---
Do you know if NC. was aware and in agreement of the deal prior to it being announced?
---
As ex-Provi I have enjoyed these.  
---
Also, Provi has caps?
---
Go choke on a pretzel in-game. Thanks.
---
The evidence suggests otherwise and you are very mistaken if you believe that every account that benefits from RMT gets banned.
---
well, sharing an unpopular opinion usually gets this kind of response, so i wasn't surprised by it. Glad i was able to have some productive discussions in the end though.
---
“Decided” yes yes.
---
If you get a week off, solo evict a wormhole. Super fun. I did it in a Proteus a few years ago (much different time) but I felt like a u-boat
---
TISHU is recruiting.
---
paying attention to...what?
---
Rise up!
---
did you just assume "her" gender?
---
Well who's going to show the little ones how to properly drain a body, if their parents are dead?
---
Use your super fleet then talk to me about risk averse.
---
&gt; This will have an exponential damaging effect on botting activity
---
it will not.  at best bots might lose drones.  at worst, it just hurts actual players while doing nothing to prevent bots.
---
by the downvotes I surmise it that this shitty community  is complicit with bottling and deserves all the criticism it gets.
---
Why don't you silly human trash learn to play a pvpmmorpg that actually requires you to press more than 1-2 buttons?
---
Everything to do with chargebacks and subscription time just auto bans you because of how many scams can work around this. Not doing so in freemium games can also start a run on the premium content, which is a quick trip to being out of business. Or having to run bots in house to make it look like you still have players wargaming
---
We don't and it doesn't. Have you basically been banned from everywhere and come to troll this now?
---
No they're not they're too busy doing time
---
WHY DO YOU HATE FREEDOM
---
This is the part that I'm worried about with it.  I wouldn't want to have to go repair my rep just to be able to fly around freely.
---
we dont.
---
and they do, just it takes longer to verify if someone is a bot then it take to make a new bot
---
I've honestly thought about doing the solo thing sometimes.  Never really did it before.
---
My hawk could probably do T3 fairly reliably, but its a bit blingy with perfect skills. T2 shouldn't be a big deal if you have the right ship for the filament. Hawks and Retributions and Worms are popular.
---
Seems you know an awful lot about how bots work. Maybe too much or you are talking out of your ass
---
Small corp is something I'm thinking about as I can do my own logistics typically with my transport/trade alt.
---
Have you seen the PC gamer article?  I've never seen a major publication write an article specifically to complain about a devs lack of response to botting.
---
The nestor has a ship maintainance bay with 5000 m3 capacity.
---
This is just enough for a single shuttle.
---
So yes, you can fly it.
---
I agree, but botters and hardcore krabs would move to systems where all the sites are like 60 AU away. So yeeting yourself to a site would be your only hope of catching someone.
---
I've got a Hawk fit at about 500m right now ab fit Ill try and work my way to an agitated. I'm still learning which hole to hit on Drifters, and Sleepers. If I can run fleet T3 but solo that'd be awesome.
---
Whatever you need to tell yourself buddy.
---
Cornak, tbh. He seems to have a solid grasp of what lowsec should be.
---
WoW
---
Their "core" candidates yes, but honestly, their smarter, broader spectrum candidates like Cornak are counting on lowsec.
---
He's not likely to get kicked, banned, or arrested during his term on the CSM. That's a start.
---
Yeah many game comes will ban your account for charge backs
---
Grose
---
Try to join eve uni they have classes.
---
don't need scouts.  any decent botting program will be able to warp off in the time it take the ganker to warp to the site, lock, and scram.
---
It is cheep, it is easy. The old way is better. There is a reason some things never change. It's because they don't need to. The old way was fine and should have just been applied to citadels.
---
Tired of all these products.  iPod, iPhone, and now iVasion.
---
I'll stick with my android Vazion²
---
botting in WoW has no where near the impact that it does in EVE.  What you can do with currency in WoW is very limited but in EVE it plays a enormous role in the end game.
---
Yeah, I've seen it. PC Gamer takes a lot of paid smear articles lately, not sure who's on a run to smear Eve but with a CSM candidate and a couple of fake reviews in the last month, this piece didn't surprise me either.
---
I just want the roaming zorya back
---
At least it provides a gameplay that requires some brain cells while still making good isk
---
Pure Blind, JSpace, or lowsec would be my suggestions then!
---
eh, not really a fan. 
---
the only counter that pve ships have now to being ganked is to run away or cyno up.  this isn't going to lead to good fights.  
---
alliances with good intel will know that you are coming miles ahead of time.  Bots will still be able to warp off with no problems.  The only people this will affect is small alliance / corp pvers.
---
Pretty much.
---
Vote for those people you want to get elected. Then vote for those you wouldn't mind being elected. 
---
That way, you're more likely to have your vote count for someone who you don't actively dislike. (If your entire ballot is eliminated, the required number of votes drops)
---
One thing unclear to me is, whose vote transfers to 2nd choice and whose not. Sure in a bloc ballot vote it doesn't matter, since all have positions filled the same. But when the 2nd position is filled with different candidates, who gets the vote?
---
Or maybe I'm a software engineer and thus know what is _really fucking simple_ to create, unlike your uneducated ass whose job (if you even have one) we'll hopefully automate before short, so crying on reddit about things you don't understand can become your full-time job instead.
---
Is not really worth the price as a newbro. You can focus on one thing at a time and experience all sides of EVE a bit before deciding to go deeper into one of those careers. If you like industry make some things. try to make some money on the market. See if you take raw materials and build something you can get "some" profit. See how you can increase those profits, invest in materials, building time, study the market prices, the fluctuations. The needs of alliances on deep null-sec to suply those alliances of weapons, shields hulls... Try it all bro. Then as you keep playing you will see yourself the need of another character, account...
---
In the same account i have the trade alt, the banker. and my main PVE character. Once you train the market character you can stop the queue and it just works perfectly without the need of taking up the skill training space.
---
The industry character can be making money without training also. The other account can be a PVP character and perhaps planet industry characters, a hauler...
---
You will see by yourself as you keep playing what you need and if its worth the price.
---
Price for omega is 500 plex per month.
---
Also an aditional training queue is 500 plex. 
---
As you start making more isk with your activities you cna decide to use that isk for that or plex your own account. 
---
My serious recomendation is to just pay they 15 for your main account and if you have isk to spare start plexing other accounts or characters.
---
Have fun o7

If I remember correctly, I asked for that after seeing the model. :) I may be misremembering though.

My ship is looking especially good, I spray painted your mom on the side.

Vote 4 Cornak
---
I guess it depends on the implementation.  STV is kind of a framework rather than a specific defined way to implement.  So I guess we would need a CCP source to explain.
---
why not?
---
Its actually fractional votes which transfer. 1000 people vote for someone who needs 500 votes to get elected? Each ballot who voted for them has 0.5 of a  vote pass to their next candidate
---
Yeah, not buying it. You're moving the goalpost for what an endemic problem of botting is. WoW economy is entirely shot due to botting even if it's a simpler system. There are literally hundreds of thousands of botters in WoW.
---
Botting is a huge problem in EVE but it's not some example of the worst in gaming.
---
Haha good post ))
---
Oh no. I've been in her enough to know.
---
Time to vote for me, you know you want to
---
Hm, that actually makes sense, but not what it sounds like when you hear "your vote gets transferred"
---
Coming back in 2019, I have two characters, with each around 9 mil exp point spent, or something around that.
---
One should be a station trader, the other one a hauler. But it seemed to frustrating of an experience to play like that. I could somehow never find the deals I looked for and sucked at station trading because of my limited knowledge about the game. So what can I do now? Should I sell my chars or exchange them for another one? (Can I even do this?)
---
Im looking for a casual experience without fearing of loosing all my progress after I bet everything on one card, like pvp or something. Im looking for the chill experience of flying my space cruiser around and making some money, having fun and enjoying the game sometimes on a semi afk or active basis in the evening or on the weekends.
---
Anyone can give me some tips on what I could do or what my next move into progression could/should be overall?
---
I encounter this a lot from a certain segment of my corp's miners. Code is a joke, code is lame, code is pathetic, i taunted code and they didnt do anything etc etc.  Then one gets ganked in their faith tanked mackinaw and suddenly code is the scourge of the universe and its not fair that CCP allows them to exist.
---
Not as good as the 50% codes we got last year but still the best I have seen this year.
---
It's a huge pain trust me.  Unless you're willing to dive in and go hardcore, best not to do FW imho
---
You know what would be even better? If the post linked directly to the sale instead of your shitty referral link.
---
Gobbins is the leader of Pandemic Horde. Steady, Aeg, and Arqui are all FCs.
---
Unless you already have very well researched ammo bpos, i wouldnt bother.  Your production costs will be higher and profit margins lower than your competitions.  Most of the ammo youre buying in those stations is probably being made and sold by the mission bears who live there anyway.  They can repro a bit of loot every now and then and churn out ammo to suit their needs and then sell off the rest.
---
And yeah, just build it using the station facilties of the hub.
---
Were you around when Jin screwed us?

er.... it does. What are you on about? You can see the URL in the post

Goons. I'm sure you've heard of them?
---
I enjoyed 2012 but lets be real the game was massively broken back then and the balance was even worse than it is today. The only thing I miss from back then is the general ignorance of the playerbase with a 40k PCU.
---
Pop some glamourex potency-75 and run the soe epic arc, then run some caldari career agents.
---
Use the booster and it will be super fast.
---
&gt;It is theoretically but not practically possible to game the system...
---
Out of curiosity, what is that possibility?
---
An in-game character name isn't "doxing", even in the fevered imagination of the most fervent grrgons
---
Provi has a large Cap-group. Although the EUTZ Dreadwing might currently be 'in build'
---
Carrier ratting ban was lifted a while back now. Thats going back before PL invasion and following test invasion.
---
Although provi super numbrers are quite low. The standard cap numbers get quite impressive! Had 100 carriers fielded for their Keepstar anchoring!
---
Provi's certainly gone thru a change. But it has emerged a dusty moth rather than a beautiful butterfly! (Imo)
---
&gt; counterproposal: nerf kitey ships
---
Lol are you for real? People fly kitey ships because they're the only way to avoid getting capital dunked at the convenience of the locals. It sounds like you don't want any PVP to inconvenience your low APM krabbing.
---
&gt; if you're speed/sig tanking with for example a vni (which non-botters also use), you then need to slow down, align, and get back to warp speed
---
Oh heaven forbid there are some fitting tradeoffs in supposedly risky space
---
that's some booty
---
Please elaborate for the class?
---
I was around when Jin left but being a scrub I never got to hear what happened or why.  I enjoyed flying with him though.  And Vysh.
---
&gt; the new gate graphcis could even have some sort of visual indicator as to HOW MUCH is currently coming through... so that way people can still differentiate between a solo Astero and a 200 man eagle fleet...
---
You'll get 1 flash or 200 flashes already
---
In that case i have no idea why did you came up north, you knew upfront that nobody is gonna bother with anything at all, now you are blaming us that we do exactly what you knew we would do, nothing. Flawed logic, dont you think? The only thing that may possibly drive you is revenge for so called "casino war" the difference in this case is that now nobody gives a shit, because its pointless.
---
There's a lot to it for a reddit comment. Join a null group and they will be able to help you with more specific questions. Tier 2 haulers can be found on the ship tree. Each race has 1 blockade runner and 1 deep space transport. If you cannot fly those yet the null blocks will also have jump freighter services to help with your importing.
---
What if there aren't 10 people that you like? Only like 2, the rest you hate with the power of 10 billion suns.
---
I covet one of those resin printers, but the overhead is too much for me right now.

For reference, here's the same ship at about the same scale done with an FDM printer. The same level of detail isn't possible, but you can come closer and the plastic is a lot cheaper: https://i.imgur.com/q2lshhS.jpg

I love it when people give me free kills too!
---
I don't want to alter three characters worth of skill plans for 3-4 months to train into the relevant frigate ships, invest in 3-6b in frigates, and run a large sample size of T5 ships only to find out they have a crazy high loss rate or make less than a T5 cruiser site. I also don't want to have to rebuy 6b worth in cruiser fits/implants to start rerunning T5 cruiser sites without a weather report.
---
"Hey goons!  FC here,
---
Its time to fight!  Fuck yeah...
---
...but, in the interest of being fair to the people on the enemy fleet, im only going to take  as many of you as they have.
---
We will be holding a raffle to determine who gets to go to war.  The other 1450 of you will have to sit this one out.  Maybe next time guys.  In the meantime, everyone get your doctrine ships checked and ammod up in case your ticket is called."
---
Sound stupid?  Yeah.
---
The default position is going to be to ban for a chargeback because usually people are trying to scam free game time.
---
Send a support ticket to CCP explaining the problem and that you'd like to repay, and I'd be surprised if you don't get a positive answer. They want your money after all.
---
It's always a good idea to fill out all 10 slots. If you \*really\* don't want to though you don't have to.
---
&gt;In that case I have no idea why you came up north.
---
To burn every single thing around you down to the ground and watch you squirm on Reddit about it helplessly, that’s why.
---
Reporting ccp to ccp for local chat harassment
---
How about low-sec pirating?   Anyone from that area of the game having fun these days?  I did it before and had a lot of fun in the time I did it.
---
Are you always this retarded or are you just having a VERY bad day?
---
If I'm remembering right, the fits for running 3 frigates in T5 are pretty cheap.
---
TIS has some of their guys showing how the frig sites worked on an older broadcast, check it out.
---
Well, they are probably very fond of their own families, that's why they risk their lives draining the blood of *other* families.
---
I like the style. No idea what they are saying. Just a shame they can't use their own footage of dropping titans and killing keepstars. Maybe they should try moving past the 77s / 46dp gate.. Please.
---
Are you gonna cry, dude?
---
then you put those as your top 2.
---
if you do not place anyone in 3-10, and your top 2 do not make it, then your votes go uncounted towards anything, and the self inflicted grr 'whoever' mentality prohibited you from voting for anyone, effectively.
---
Fair enough, I looked at the link but didn't check when he joined. Might have wanted to say that earlier, but still fair enough. Fly safe

Providence doesn't have a super fleet 😎
---
I'm sure you heard of the Anime war
---
TLDR; Jin goes on the CSM summit I believe, pisses someone off because he's an anime lover, enemies put a big bounty on his corpse, he sends a long bullshit letter to the alliance explaining why he can't continue with us and leaves for Dreddit.
---
That's a Serpentis message, isn't it? Or do they all use it?
---
I couldn't get it to load for some reason.
---
Big brain plays by that super pilot.
---
Really? I'm surprised, would have figured the frigates would have ran at at least a billion each. Regardless, I'll check them out.
---
[deleted]
---
I didn't move the goalpost.  I guess it depends how you define "worst".  WoW economy isn't a serious concern because money doesn't influence the end game and botting his minimal impact on gameplay. The only thing you need a lot of gold for in WoW are convenience items.   It is very different with EVE.  EVE's botting problem is much more serious than in WoW.
---
Classic Eve Server is an awful idea that could hurt an already dwindled player base.  Even if you like or hate the old or new eve, splitting a player base between two servers would severely hurt both servers.
---
Nice baitpost. Made me clock and watch. Accept my sincere downvote.
---
Thank you sir!
---
I have a valid complaint.  How stupid you must be to be crying about valid complaints.
---
No, I never heard about the Anime war! Hahaha.  It's too silly to be true... I hope.
---
Plex isk prices gonna go lower with all the sales.
---
Well.. Yeah.. Eve online literally fought a war over anime... I'm as ashamed as you will be when you learn it's true.. lol
---
I mentionned it as an example as to how it's possible to make isk without local as an instant source of intel. 
---
Iirc CCP even said somewhere that local wasn't meant to be a source of intel at all.
---
Sounds like delaying local = deleting it = wormholes for you. Oh well, spodbrains gonna hate, not surprising.
---
I just think that null should be somewhere between empire space and wormholes in terms of risk, which makes sense considering the decreasing security status. TEST member btw.
---
How do you expect me to be swayed by the masses of ass clowns like yourself who aren't intelligent enough to form an any kind of argument?
---
What are you too stupid to understand, exactly?
---
THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!
---
Was proposed many times.
---
CCP: Let's make them some new ships and retarded PvE instead
---
Appeal to authority logical fallacy has been activated. This is how you know the battle has been won.
---
Eh its kinda true. Waffles was already prodding us and they came up with a silly excuse to go on a content deployment. There was no "Provi is defending anime" or anything since the story goes that it was an internal fight between those in waffles who wanted anime memes banned from their discord and those that didn't. The side that collected more Jintaan corpses won. When they stopped talking about that they didn't leave and just kept fighting us for content.
---
Lost my first one yesterday, love it.

I'm not trying to sway you, nor I feel the need to lower myself to explain anything to an imbecile like yourself.
---
Get off the horse maggot, people are just interacting with you in this thread out of boredom or because they want to laugh a little.
---
Yay! Welcome to eve, good luck. Fly dangerous.
---
Did you try to self-destruct during the fight to save your E-honnor ? If yes , it would be considered like a spaceship bushido honorable act to do in this kind of situation.
---
Whatever you need to tell yourself to help you sleep at night. Just close your eyes and keep telling yourself that you're good at something, while wondering why nobody seems to like you, or why you just can't seem to get a job when everyone else manages to.
---
The world is wrong, not you, of course. 
---
I'm sure that'll work out great for you.
---
All candidates could be the best ever and it still wouldnt matter. The problem is CCP.
---
Nobody even knows what you are talking about, moron.
---
You might as well have typed GAHTYAGDFGJHAGAG
---
Why would anyone take seriously some random idiot who posted like you just did? A poster who was so stupid that they  didn't have the mental foresight to give the slightest inkling of basis to their thoughtless post.
---
HAH!
---
They already did. How fast should the fastest ship go in your opinion?
---
1. Any way of making ISK that you'd normally do if you wanted to PvP instead of station trading works fine. Incursions are a fairly safe way to make a good amount of ISK (around 100m ISK/hr). Ratting in null as part of a big null group is also pretty good. I'd look into ISK making guides, there are a few.
---
2. It depends on the competitiveness of the market. For very competitive markets, you might need to log in a few times during the day. In less competitive markets, once a day/every few days would probably work. Market competitiveness can change too, so it depends.
---
3. It depends on your needs I guess. You can be profitable with not a lot of ISK, it depends on how profitable you want to be. Trying it to see how much profit you can make is the best way to know that.
---
4. You can max jump once every 24 hours, I don't think you can change this. With max skills, you can create more jump clones, but not modify the amount of time in-between jumps. The best thing you can probably do is to set your medical clone to Jita. Then, you can self-destruct in space and will be transported to Jita. You will lose all implants if you do this, so make sure you have a naked pod. Then you can jump clone back home. It's recommended to keep an alt to do trading though, even if it's an alpha. From there, you can calculate the lower margin that you get from not having Broker Relations and Accounting V vs the flexibility of always being to log in Jita without having to jump back home.
---
5. I'm not familiar with any, your google search will be as good as mine.
---
6. Good!
---
7. With max skills, you can have 305 orders all at once. Since you can modify every order every 5 mins, clicking through and changing the price of each one could take more than 5 mins so I guess it would be possible. But it really depends on the competition.
---
8. To each their own! I have some friends who like looking at graphs and finding interesting trends. It's very much possible you could enjoy this. Eve has a great Api if you want to do it programatically, so you can have pretty advanced spreadsheets to find your items to station trade or manipulate. Just try it with a small amount of investment and see if you enjoy it or not!
---
9. A simple one that I encountered was a manipulation of the price of a faction ammo (I don't have the history of it anymore, I don't remember which one it was.) Someone had bought all of the stock in Jita (around 2 billion ISK's worth) at around 400 isk per unit and put it back at 800 ISK per unit (it was a relatively small market). I happen to acquire a large ammo of that type through LP and put it up for sale, but could never get a buyer (I suspect it was too high and the ammo not popular enough). I had a sizable amount of the market, so I crashed the price back to normal levels to get buyers to buy my stock.
---
One final tip is to always follow Eve's golden rule: Never fly what you can't afford to lose. The same thing applies to markets: Never buy what you can't afford to lose. You never know when the market you have chosen might be much smaller than you thought and you might be stuck with stock that takes months to years to liquidate.

Why should they? It was FIRE that claimed they would invade.

---
&gt; CCP even said somewhere that local wasn't meant to be a source of intel at all.
---
Whether CCP intended it or not doesn't make any difference to whether it's good or bad.  There are plenty of bad things they did intend and quite a few good things they didn't.
---
&gt; Oh well, spodbrains gonna hate
---
I don't mine and I don't rat.
---
&gt; Sounds like delaying local = deleting it
---
Here's the deal: if you want delayed local or even removed local, you're going to have to come up with counters and/or different ways to rat and mine.  Rorqual has panic as a counter because when it's in siege it's *as if* local were delayed in any case.  It can't go anywhere.  
---
In ranking things most likely to die number 1 would be people in subscaps.  They can't live long enough to cyno in help.  Next would be carriers, which die very fast to dread bombs or bomber gangs.  Last would be supers which still die fast to large groups or dreads but may survive long enough to get some fax on grid and cyno in the umbrella.  What will happen is those targets just won't be in space anymore because... psychology.
---
But I wouldn't even concede there's a problem for attackers.  Just look at the killboards.  Even in Delve which has the biggest cap umbrella in the game, rorqs, carriers and supers die all the time.  Groups that are well organised and are skilled at hunting (like Bombers Bar) get kills.  So I think it's fair already.
---
haha, yee man, panfam is crying but TEST, on the wining side, confident in it's position is playing the victim card...
---
you don't even listen to yourself do you?
---
Maybe. But putting better voices into the room with CCP when they are making a decision they aren't sure on won't hurt.

Probably best to do FW on a dedicated alt, the standings hit and perma-war would be annoying on a main.

Right. The stupid corvette or shuttle you get as insurance payout is worth many life savings.

If you want to get involved in the invasions, join the channel "Consortium Operations". It's ran by the arataka research consortium. Look them up on youtube. They're currently running invasion sites and I'm sure you can find someone to fleet up with.
---
If there are two candidates you like, and the remaining candidates you hate *precisely equally*, then put the two you like at the top and whatever you do with the remainder doesn't matter. Let's just say I sincerely doubt that this is an accurate description of your preferences.
---
Much more likely is that you (like many) hate thinking about voting and hate thinking about candidates that aren't your favorites, which makes it harder to fill out the latter parts of your ballot. **To address this, here are a couple simple principles you might like that can (statistically) lead to decent voting with minimal effort:**
---
* **I like candidates that will actually put in work on the CSM:** If so, fill out your ballot with the first candidates you see on the list *that you've heard of.* That means they're at least putting in effort to campaign. It's not a perfect proxy, but it's not a bad first pass.
---
* **I hate the "establishment" / I wish I could vote "none of the above":** If so, fill out your ballot with the first candidates you see *that you* ***haven't*** *heard of*. Again, not a perfect proxy, but if your goal is something new then you're probably looking for... someone new. (And if your goal is a non-existent representative, then voting for someone who isn't campaigning could well get you someone who doesn't show up to the CSM either.)
---
* **I wish someone else would think for me:** There are slates out there. Pick one. Easy.
---
* **Slates are ruining everything:** There are slates out there. Pick one. Then take the first candidates you see that *aren't on it*.
---
Note that these randomized methods work because CCP is pretty awesome and shows you candidates in a random order that's different for everybody.
---
I fucking love this.
---
Yeah my Xbox live account got banned for this, but they let me keep going online for the month then were like pay us the $20 or go to collections.
---
I know its used in Guristas at least, so I assume its all of them
---
Can you run the career agents for all of the starter systems? Or can you just run them once?
---
You can do a bit of everything on a character, particularly all the things that involve ships, as there are a lot of shared skills, and the way Eve's skills work, you can train a skill to III or even IV and it doesn't take that long.
---
But yeah to heavily skill into one thing you will want to use that character to stay with that thing, otherwise you'll have 'wasted' skills that you aren't really using.

After a 3 year hiatus I join my friend in Test Alliance’s last wormhole corp. 9 days in we both go deep into the wormhole chain. Couple of hours in, we realized a wormhole closed behind us so we have to keep going. The last wormhole we check has a bunch of caps in 7 different poses. I decide that i want to investigate more and log off in that system.
---
I go to work and 8 hours later I log back in to start jotting down pos locations and all the intel i can gather. I plan to stay here a week, but the second pos i warped to I see an unpiloted Chimera 100km outside the pos! I try to rally my corp and I find a guy who can fly one. He disappears for a while and I see one of the chimera’s corpmates log on. I don’t think he could fly the capitals or maybe he didn’t notice. 
---
I go directly to my CEO, who i didn’t realize was a complete shitlord, and he immediately grabs the CEO of another corp to extract the chimera via a nullsec. One of the most exciting Eve moments for me. Turns out to be a 3 bil ship
---
Naturally, i figured we would split the loot somehow. Nope. My CEO was like “just let him have it” and “it’s in the alliance.” I didn’t say much about it for a while, but people kept hearing of my story and they all wondered how much I got from it. Everyone was surprised to hear  I didn’t get anything. On top of that, the guys involved took credit for the “theft” and the only credit i got was for “scouting” out the ship. 
---
By this time, i got fed up. I went to the alliance CEO and after a long discussion he ended up giving me 800m. I forever hold Saporro Jones in my heart and have the upmost respect for that man. I love you Sapporo!

Nah you can do em in around ~300M per Hawk.

You might be interested in Spectre Fleet and Bombers Bar, or when you have time in the EU-Timezone, the streamer BjornBee does public fleets as well. Great if you don't want to commit too much time but like the occasional pew pew.

no theyre not 100 mil an hour. About 2-300 mil / hour. Three times that with frigs since the rewards are multiplied by 3 there.

The discussion already moved past this point, and i later acknowledge that there seems to be some deeper agreement between gotg and Imperium given that Gotg provided access to gotg structures for the Imperium, which is something that i was not aware of when i made my comment defending the point that gotg was a 3rd party. If they are coordinating to the point of giving each other access to structures for the war, they are clearly not just 3rd parties and are in fact participating in the war together.

However to answer your point specifically, no they aren't, because it has been stated by a number of people, including Elo i think,  in talking stations at one point and vily in the metashow, that Panfam were given access to the Jump gate network from Fraternity, so they could show up for timers quickly and without Jump fatigue, there may not be a public agreement that we can all read about it, but it is public in the sense that everyone knows that they are coordinating. Kinda like Legacy and Imperium last year, there was no public agreement that we could all read, but it was public knowledge that they had a mutual defense agreement, and once the war started were actively coordinating with each other.
---
As i said in another reply, the 3rd party topic is always a controversial topic in eve nullsec, often used for propaganda purposes as a way to piss off line members of the other side.
---
Examples to his would be Fountain war where NC. claimed to be only 3rd party while providing assistance to Test, and then later the CFC used the same argument (i believe in a state of the goonion just before they went to war with n3) that they were just 3rd parties in the war between the Russians and the N3 for the Halloween war, i'm sure there are older examples as well, but those were some of the ones i can remember of the top of my head, the overall point that I was hoping to make it clear though is that the term 3rd party is so broad due to how it has been used in eve online over the years, that even in cases where two groups are assisting each other, one of them could still claim to be a 3rd party and would be subjectively speaking correct to say so.
---
well bring them, as I said it was a lot of fun, and I guess everybody knows that this and every other Ihub is undefendable against your numbers.
---
It just feels... I don't know, wrong to smugpost about a timer that you almost lost despite your overwhelming numbers, and that you saved in the end by bringing even extra numbers. It's like doing a Race between a formular one car and a fiat 500. 
---
Sure, in the end you won, but it is nothing you would tell a women in a bar to impress her.... unless you are looking for women whose self-esteem is based on a similar kind of "victorys" ;-)
---
Yeah, I was looking at these actually.  I may look into them a bit more. Thanks.
---
IIRC its at some times even reffered to as more valuable than that.
---
There is a paragraph somewhere that refers to 1 ISK being able to buy an entire continent on some backwater planet somewhere so you could live out your life and retire with money still to spare.
---
Can we have a follow up?  
---
Why do EVE players tolerate posters this caught up in their own hype?
---
You are crying about perceived crying, moron.
---
It is hard to imagine how stupid you must be to not realize it.  Of all dumb shit to cry about you cry about someone criticizing botting.
---
Quite the contrary. Voting/CSM legitimizes CCP's desire to avoid communicating with the community. This protects their shitty ideas from public scrutiny. 
---
If you think bots, injectors, rorqs and isk fountains are good for the game, go vote, because you will not change anything.
---
There are a lot of highsec corp that hire miners to exploit them, since it originally seems like not a bad source of ISK but you'll be much better treated in corps from other areas of space (nullsec has the biggest corps right now). Eve Uni (like the guy was saying) is a good corp to start learning Eve, since they do a bit of everything and is specialized for getting new players ready
---
Actually, I'm a pilot in real life. I make far more money then you'll ever make doing your made up nerd thing. This makes me uniquely qualified to say that you are all wrong about everything Spaceship related. If you had my qualifications, you'd know that you are stupid. That's the thing about being a genius astronaut pilot in real space.
---
hmm
---
lmao, imagine making shit up and getting called on it
---
You don't need a high value hawk to even do these sites. I run three hawks with a 70 ish mill setup. The setu0 runs t5 darks. You can't run any other type of site but the loss ratio is low. Maybe one to two hawks a day if I'm not lucky. It runs t4 sites reliably. I haven't lost a pod or full fleet of hawks in well over a month. 
---
Here's the fit. If you don't have advanced weapon upgrades 5, downgrade the booster to a meta booster. I also run a 1% implant for light missile damage, range and precision and an agency pyrolancia db3. Whatever the lowest damage booster is. Each t5 dark site pays for at least 1 and a half hawks. 
---

---
lmao, imagine lying about shit just because he is in your coalition
---
Hahahaha, keep it up boy. As long as you believe yourself, don't let anyone else tell you that you're wrong or insane.
---
I hope you live a very long life, as we both know you're going to hate every second of it.
---
The hawk can do dark sites for 70 mill a pop. See my other comment. I lose maybe one or two at most in a day if I get an unlucky spawn, but it has a very high survival rate
---
Even if it was a referral link, isn’t he... referring us?
---
If you make 2000 more bricks you could build a chimney. Actually this is pretty cool!
---
Think a Hound would work for this at all?
---
Grab a Hecate, a bubble, find a decently traveled pipe in nullsec, set up the bubble and kill anything that lands in it. Or run if it’s something you can’t kill, obviously.
---
And if there was no CSM, what makes you think they would listen to the playerbase on some of their more shitty ideas they want to implement?
---
that remains to be seen.
---
Yes. In the last room there is occasionally a proving conduit in addition to the origin conduit, that is how you get to the pvp room
---
That at least seems like a fair payout. Scumbags for not giving you scout's share, which is by tradition a double share of the split.
---
They're cool with it as it was the plan all along. Also noone knows what arqui is saying and aeg has no chill man.
---
As mentioned in CGP Grey's video, it's possible for a candidate to have widespread support and still be the first eliminated. This happens if you're everybody's second choice and nobody's first choice. Imagine the following scenario:
---
You like candidates A and B, and dislike candidate C. The election threshold is 100 votes. Candidate A has a hardcore following of 80 voters (of which you are one), but nobody else has them on their ballot at all. Candidate B is the second choice of all the A voters, and the first choice of 50. The voters who like B the best have C as their second choice, and the 70 voters who like C the best have B as their second choice.
---
* 80x: A --&gt; B
---
* 50x: B --&gt; C
---
* 70x: C --&gt; B
---
Since nobody has 100 votes, B is eliminated and C gets elected. If you and 49 of your friends strategically voted first for B instead of your favorite A, then B gets elected right away. If you and 20 of your friends do it, then A gets eliminated first and then B gets elected.
---
I think this is the likeliest scenario where strategic thinking is relevant, but it's still (IMO) quite unlikely. It requires a very asymmetric relationship between the bases of two candidates, where people who like A also kinda like B but the reverse isn't true. I'd be curious to see examples where this is an accurate description of people's preferences, but I simply don't know of any.
---
Yeah not trying to white knight for them or anything, just thought there would be no negative in throwing them in the last remaining spots on the recommended horde ballot.
---
Prove it then. In what way did he dox the wiz? Address? Phone number? Job?
---
I spent too much time reading what people wrote, probably didn't vote at all how my alliance would want.
---
Upvoted because CGP Grey has a ton of great videos on voting (among other things) and a great podcast.
---
Just change the US flag to an Imperium one and you got the eve CSM.
---
They cannot be forced to listen, but at least there is a chance that better ideas are heard. Should they still ignore us, they would be completely isolated without being able to pretend the community is with them.
---
With how many planets there are buying a continent on some backwater one far out in J space or nullsec probably would be dirt cheap, the expensive part would be getting supplies and protection
---
no, who's on first, what's on second.
---
&gt;Your belief that protests against bottling would be wasted effort aren't founded on any logic.
---
Your thought process on this is incorrect, and therefore your conclusion is wrong. My opinion is based on microeconomic realities an entity with finite resources would have to choose from, and therefore centred in logic. Your opinion draws from a philosophical root. While being logical, it also draws more from a theoretical rather than a factual model, hence it's weakness. So it isn't a misalignment between logic and non-logic, but rather a debate between economic and philosophical principles.
---
&gt;CCPs pathetic efforts  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Why do EVE players tolerate botting?  
---
&gt;worst botting problem in the history of MMORPGS  
---
&gt;force the devs to do something
---
May I just make a suggestion since from your posting history it is clear you enjoy political and philosophical discussions; presenting a polarized viewpoint doesn't lend it credibility; the danger in such a scenario is that unless you are stating a fact, the polarized viewpoint comes across as both conceited and ill-thought out.
---
It would serve you better to temper a more neutral position when expressing an opinion; people would be both more receptive of it, and you would probably be engaged in more meaningful discussions about the topic on hand.
---
Our local NWO office has your location by now btw, the Zionists are already on the way to *reeducate* you
---
Wheres third then?!
---
Exactly this. The Anime War was just for shiggles, rest was just content.
---
Who the hell cares about delve. Hit ihubs and structures and people might give a shit
---
Didn't they do just that like a year or two ago?
---
[Signal Cartel](https://www.signalcartel.com/) would welcome you into "Eve on hard mode".  We're a neutral service focused corp with a strict non-aggression rule (unless we're aggressed first).  Our main activities are Exploration, and running New Eden's only (that I know of) wormhole Search and Rescue service.  We also run fleets regularly into wormholes and we're engaging the Triglavians whenever they dare venture too close to where we operate - which is most of the universe, known and unknown - although we do have three highsec offices, and an office in [Thera](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Thera).
---
Theres always hope as long as you still have hands.
---
I don't know
---
As a wow player: oh my sweet summer child.
---
Whbtw
---
There's nothing inherently wrong with a Goon CSM member on its own, the main reason people say this kind of thing is because the Goon high command picks people that will benefit their alliance and their vision for the game, with general disregard for other views. They tell the whole alliance who to vote for, and open rebellion against it can get you into some serious problems. It's rather authoritarian, and a lot of people don't like it. Not to mention it kinda promotes a sheep mentality. That's the main reason.
---
You did not get it, did you ?
---
Goons are NEVER engaging unless they completely overhelm enemy numbers. Why call GOTG into this fight when you have already 3 times the enemy numbers ?
---
Not familiar with George Orwell I take it
---
Woest thing being I think he still doesn't get it.
---
Feelsbad he only uploads every decade
---
I mean,  just like in real life. You can buy cheap swampland in the middle of nowhere for nothing, but having the financial backing, connections and tools to build something is the real cost. He'll, you can buy a small, shitty house that don't pass inspection for cheap as well, but again, the real cost comes with fixing it up and getting it legally livable again. All in all, not THAT different from real life.
---
your higher up needs to stop leaving all the loot in the abyss if he's only making 100 mil an hour in t5. I make between 70-100 mil an hour speed running t3s from just the red loot and materials
---
More like $100k. In lore 1 ISK is enough to comfortably feed, clothe, and house a large family on a planet.
---
But he is.
---
Test is playing the victim card to exonerate themselves from any justification as why they are siding with goons.
---
"I'm helping goons because ncpl were means to us three centuries ago"
---
"But they are already the most powerful coalition in the game by a huge margin, why not being an independant  coalition ?"
---
"But NCPL..."
---
"So you would prefer that Eve dies a Serenity death because someone killed your pixel 2 years ago ?"
---
"But they are mean..."
---
You assume that the next content update could not be possibly postponed to invest in botting prevention.   I really don't understand how you could think that or that it would not be preferable to the community.   You are just guessing, making faulty assumptions and presenting it as fact.
---
If enough people threatened to boycott, CCP would be forced to do something about it or go out of business.  To suggest that the money isn't ever going to be there to deal with botting is completely unfounded.
---
It's almost like u/Rhiload got the idea from someone else... Go look up the unicum guides for world of tanks.
---
Bots can switch to non-overprop fits too. Currently overprop is best because active shield takes up more slots which could be used for nav computers or tracking links. But with this local nerf bots would just switch to active shield and be fine.
---
Judging by your comments you’re missing one too many screws lol.
---
That is what I would expect to apply to a wow player in the context of understanding the CSM. You did not disappoint.
---
“Krypted gaming” sounds l33t
---
Lol.
---
Taking a year off.  Didn't have the patience for running again after the recent unpleasantness.
---
Way to pull Yes Roundabout out. Going old skool with the tunes.
---
Ignore the spaz, you know what they say.. Give somebody a hand and they take the whole fucking arm. 
---
People are straight up ungrateful, honestly if you didn’t post this I wouldn’t have known, so I could care less if you posted a referral or not.
---
If that dude bitching thought it’s such a big deal he could simply use google.
---
How does my office rental fee go from 5mil a month to 21mil? Whats this based on exactly? I'm at an NPC station in high sec.
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/212689029-Profile-Management-Tool
---
The CSM is there to allow them to pretend the decisions have community support. Stating their shitty ideas in public would hurt their feelings.
---
Your #1 is a big null block candidate - specifically, Hordes.
---
That is a good thing
---
I'm well aware - they are a focus group in a unique position to convey ideas to CCP. It's not up to the CSM what CCP does.
---
That's What!
---
Classic servers are a fully flushed out and proven concept. See: OSRS and Everquest. Those servers are the only reason those games are still kicking at this point.
---
Nothing at all, I just don't think Nullsec needs more than 2 people representing its playstyle.
---
Well I bothered to read about every candidate, even listened to some interviews. I normally do not care as much to do that with real life candidates.
---
&gt; Isn't GotG now referred to as "Dead Coalition"?
---
I think so but I haven't seen it used by anyone but themselves. Changed it tho
---
Well, kind of the same if you think about it... Goons are more honest about it, that's it.
---
So I am not sure about the price manipulation being an exploit, though frankly I doubt it. The event you are describing however was specifically based around how Faction War kill mails used to reward LP. That was an exploit and has since been patched out of the game.
---
Rental space turning back into rental space... the state of eve where alliances can now take space do nothing and make even more billions in passive income... 🤔
---
I mean at least we don’t need to trick test to shot your structures 🤫
---
ha ha get dread bombed noobs
---
My CSM interview with Talking in Stations: 
---
https://www.talkinginstations.com/2019/06/csm14-blood-ruin/
---
what comment?  why should i take some random idiot like you seriously?  Nobody knows what you are even talking about.  Add your name to the pile of idiots that make up the masses.
---
Is that why PL also don’t undock then ? Because they are dead ??!!!?!?!! Oh my
---
That seems extreme. You’d think you’d just get dropped to alpha until you paid. I guess in a perfect world you’d be punished somehow so you avoided it happening again, but not banned.
---
They came to take Shrek's swamp, too
---
it's probably still not *1* isk though  
---
like if having a thousand of the thing makes you a multi-hectillionaire or whatever why even have lore tbh
---
If your intentions are as pure as you claim then why did you put yourself not only on the list, but at the top of it?
---
This doesn't sound like you genuinely want what's best for EVE. This sounds like you want to get elected and you're willing to play some holier-than-thou bullshit to do it.
---
You can just send your isk to Grandpa Fogie in-game
---
Take what seriously? Like I said, something is seriously wrong with you my man, you are delusional. Read your comments throughout this thread, the immaturity and incompetence is unreal. 
---
You’re asking me what comment as if you don’t read or think before you post. 
---
He's in NC. who they're actively attacking. Seems a little surprising to me, but maybe their views for the game align and the GSM prefers working with him.
---
See, the CSM _does_ matter!
---
blood ruin once saved the life of my first born child
---
I like this format that you are doing now. Keep it up!
---
By your own admission it is a select few who are most vocal about botting. You also appreciate that the majority of players, while against botting, accept that CCP are doing \*something\* about it (though could be doing more).
---
Those opinions are reactionary, most often fueled by forum discussions about bots being rampant. It's actually cyclical; players complain, it rises in a crescendo, and then CCP releases statistics on all the accounts they have banned over the last period they were tracking. You will note that those bans are not done spur of the moment, they are done over time to achieve a cumulative effect, which is then reported.
---
As to delaying a content patch in favour of botting prevention; you're forgetting a lot of variables in making that fixed interchangeability argument. Drawing resources away from one department doesn't just mean telling them to stop what they are doing to do something else; it means sacking them. Firing staff, rather than having a structured increase of budget for a concern area over time, is the epitome of poor decision making and does not future proof your business.
---
It also massively damages staff morale across the business, not just in the team being axed. Your core mistake is assuming there is this interchangeability; there is not. My explanation of budgets to you was to highlight the fact that that is how company finance allocation is structured; it does not mean there is interchangeability like your favourite game of Sim City or whatever.
---
then hrode should be deleted
---
The "Anime War" was an excellent bit of content that had a lot of people had a great time with.
---
At slot # 8, its more like lets just keep the highsec carebear nobodies out.
---
Duuude why not post this earlier? Some of us have already voted.
---
Maybe? I though it was just sun's tho
---
True, I did it on an alt myself, its ez 120m an hour on the low side.
---
Calls people sheeple. Literally uses trigger words and talking points of sheeple. 10/10 shitty troll
---
Even with all the sales we had last year, PLEX was on a steady rise. They will still trend upward, just like they always do.
---
I think bans are justified in this case, until the situation is cleared with a ticket. After all, it requires little effort from the customer.  
---
Consider the alternative: Rather than immediately banning people who charge back it could lead to potential exploits that could be time consuming to correct and in a worst case scenario, could affect the whole server in a negative way.
---
It's my ballot. Ofc I put myself on top of it. I even said "prioritize your candidates".
---
You can run T5 darks with this shitfit? No offense, but I was expecting full blues and greens, implants, drugs... the fit itself is nice but 1/10th of the price I imagined. i ran T3 frigate sites with a 200m retri.
---
Pfffft hahaha.
---
Frigate sites have the same loot table as a cruiser? Wow. I’ll take a look into it. Would a multiboxing platform like Eve-O preview work?
---
And by not voting and having lower turnout year over year like for the past 4 years, you expect them to slow monetization rather than wring every last nickel they can from it... why exactly?
---
If I recall correctly, it's a formula based on how many other groups are staging in that station. Your standings with the NPC corp in question might also be a factor.
---
What are you hoping to get out of an answer to this question?
---
What's the question?
---
its all about priorities, isn't it? People would not necessarily have to be fired to invest funds in bot prevention.  
---
  If enough people protest they will do something about it where their money would be better spent. Preventing botting is not high enough on the agenda because of lack of protest and there are countless stories of bots not being banned for years.
---
I agree that it probably won't happen but to say it can't happen doesn't make sense to me in the absolute way you stated it.
---
I think if you press 'F1' it will auto fill the GSF approved candidates for you.
---
I podded to a station today and I didn't get a free ship. When did that change?
---
@/u/Jibrish Can we fix this bot auto removal problem please? I keep private messaging to the mod team and nobody is answering. In the 4-5 hour period a mod approves my posts they are already at the bottom of the new posts page. You know it happened to me once before.
---
Or please tell me if I am some sort of intended "show post upon approval" list.
---
He also goes on about how different playstyles should unite, specifically naming WHs, them”n doesn’t put any WH candidates in the ballot (Except Stitch who is primarily Smallgang and has readily admitted that his WH knowledge is mostly limited to C2s).
---
We need more info. Do I want to survive? Do I want to take something with me? Do I want to tank for a long time?
---
One common answer is a "sneaky pete", a cloaky interdiction nullified Tengu fit with rails. I stand a pretty good chance of surviving even 1vMany, and I can pick off small ships from extreme range if they aren't paying attention.
---
An uncommon answer that sometimes sees use in wormholes is a Marauder. You can potentially tank an entire fleet (small gang or poorly equipped mid-size gang) with one of those, and while your DPS is nothing to write home about you are excellent bait for when your own backup eventually arrives.
---
FYI the yellow box means they successfully locked you. They just didn't shoot.
---
Go to wormholes. I came back after a 3 year AFK and loving it
---
ExookiZ is the main wh candidate and he is 2nd on my list. He is also the one with the best chance.
---
Nobody knows what you are talking about, dumbass.
---
If you are going to attack me, you could at least explain your reasoning.  
---
Fucktard posters like you are in no position to be labeling others "immature and incompetent".   You are absolutely worthless and have brought nothing to the discussion. The best thing about the internet is I don't have to be nice to trash like you.
---
Deal with it.
---
After this exploit, CCP explicitly called out manipulation of the ccp base price for items to be an exploit.
---
I'm in good standing and there are 2 open offices available. There has to be something based on traffic in and out and maybe even the estimated value of your assets. I just never seen an increase like that in one month.
---
That either means two things, either you are a moron. 
---
Or you just know the players in the game in real life and dont need to research them as much.
---
dude your running abit late with this "not a AMA" lol
---
Steve Ronuken has been doing good technical work on the CSM that just helps everyone. Vote for him if you want to keep politics out of your choice.
---
There is no problem. You posted this thread on a brand new alt account which automod nuked, then you posted a duplicate on your main, which automod nuked for being a duplicate. Then you linked a thing on twitter of a guy talking about his thread being removed when it was never touch (and I posted proof in that twitter thread.
---
If you want to avoid issues with the spam prevention it's recommend to not use new alt accounts with little to no history, and it's also recommended to not duplicate large amounts of text between those posts. If you feel a need to do this, please reach out to someone on the mod team first so someone is aware when it happens and can override automods spam filtration.
---
Vote for someone who's too incompetent to understand how an AUTO MOD feature works, and narcissistic enough to think there's bias against him by a literal bot.
---
Quality CSM material there.
---
The only thing that even potentially would make them stop is public scrutiny. If they want the input of the community, they need to come and get it.
---
They keep pushing the CSM because its very convenient to claim the community has some kind of voice. This is what they need to lose. We ultimately cannot change their decisions, but we can stop supporting them.
---
Didnt recognize the FCs good to know. (Everyone knows gobbins)
---
Our FC Seth Cane and our propaganda dude Crime Time already created a battle report in video form (also thanks to Hole Sale for providing additional footage).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ5JY5mePqc

edit
---
Also this should be the correct battle report:
---
https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/iu5dePmM6MTWD43DA
---
Why don't you do us all a favor and just unsub?
---
I did have fun when I did before. Maybe it was the group I was with that made it boring at times.
---
A. You come over like a real shitter in your comments. You're asking a question and then you're rude to people answering. 
---
B. Yes, that hawk fit can do T4/5's pretty reliable. You need to multibox 3 of them though. They can't solo it.
---
Even more reason for ccp to take judge's voice of sanity into account
---
Would that make you happy?
---
When is the Titan whelp? I missed this but would definitely bring my Drake to the next one!
---
Fair enough, I will explain to you what my point is.
---
You literally can’t go a single post without attacking people, name calling and trying to offend everyone. That only shows how weak your personality is. 
---
Why do you feel attacked by me? Is it because I pointed out how hostile and immature all your responses are? I’m just speaking facts. You can keep up all this “dumbass trash dick sucking” bullshit, but it doesn’t bother me even the slightest bit.
---
Also you’re literally talking shit for no reason, I’m still trying to process what the problem here is lol.
---
I honestly hope that you’re just trolling, but if you aren’t I’m seriously concerned about your mental health and that’s because I generally care about people even if It’s just random people on the internet.
---
If by "plea deal" you mean "total exoneration" and by "can't run again" you mean "didn't feel like it," then yes.
---
I can't wait to exercise my Goon-given right to vote for exactly who I'm told to vote for!
---
EVE Source says that 10 thousand isk is enough money to live very confortable life from birth to death in most places across galaxy.
---
I understand what the CSM is and what its relevance to the community is. That's why i think its hilarious that you think its such a bad thing because i see first hand what game devs who don't even have limited contact with even a council does.
---
Not having a CSM does not mean that they will listen to us. And it won't stop them from pretending to listen to us. And you aren't elite for not doing something, only doing things can make you elite.
---
Yikes...
---
Think I found my own answer. They increase by 5% per day if all slots are rented. Over 30 days that can add up to a lot.
---
Sure, I wouldn't have a gripe about him using a referral link - I was just pointing out that even if you wanted to be fanny flustered over that, he wasn't using one.
---
Yeah not voting for you after seeing this exchange. I agree with Olmeca. We should have more psychological warfare tactics like cloaky camping, not fewer. What applies to Delve can easily apply to any other region if the players there were as committed to the task. Just because they don't, doesn't make the mechanics involved any less important.
---
The intel networks, the jump bridges, etc etc. What you espouse is to nerf the one thing that can overcome those things in Delve because the practice is more effective in regions where people haven't accomplished what Delve has. Which is a completely idiotic frame of reference when you should be focused on the ground truth irrespective of the difference of application of the mechanics themselves. Those mechanics become overwhelmingly powerful when employed properly, and thus necessitate a counter like cloaky camping. Without it, what more would there be to penetrate the defensive net of Delve? A net which could be erected anywhere else with just as much efficacy.
---
This is the flaw with you bloc candidates. No matter the concern you wish to address as CSM, it has its roots in enhancing your bloc and your bloc alone.
---
Not just me.  Us.
---
Reddit != EVE
---
Sidenote, bots can totally be biased. I don't think there's serious debate about that in the ML community anymore--I think it's just taken as a given by those of us who work or study in that area.
---
to be clear, its totally okay that they locked my account, i was just wondering that there is no email or the option to pick another payment method..
---
wrote a ticket.. hope it doesnt take weeks
---
No I think it's fair. You're not playing for free. They paid you. It's not hard to resolve.
---
what sheeple talking point?
---
the ban itself is reasonable imo.. but no mail / no possibility to set up a new payment method is quite strange
---
&gt;I'm in good standing and there are 2 open offices available. There has to be something based on traffic in and out and maybe even the estimated value of your assets. I just never seen an increase like that in one month.
---
Whoa. Today I learned.
---
&gt;That's why i think its hilarious that you think its such a bad thing because i see first hand what game devs who don't even have limited contact with even a council does.
---
After 10 years of shit coming out of CCP with the "support" of the CSM, I can say its shit. The only unknown is how much worse it would be without them, but we can estimate it to be "not much".
---
&gt;Not having a CSM does not mean that they will listen to us. And it won't stop them from pretending to listen to us. And you aren't elite for not doing something, only doing things can make you elite.
---
The correct way to deal with a shitty situation like this is to de-legitimize or remove what they value, even if its not much. Thats all you can do.
---
The vast majority of posters here seem to be morons and they are asking for it. I gave you what you deserve, given your comment.  
---
Insults only detract from the argument when it involves stupid people who get hung up on them.   Intelligent posters are able to recognize the arguments despite the use of insults.   
---
the best trolling is the unwanted truth.
---
I posted on my main. It was shadowbanned. I deleted my own post. There is literally no reason for me to create an account with my own name and post it from there. 
---
Then I tried the alt account. Got nuked.
---
Then I tried getting it posted by a friend. Got removed. We deleted it too.
---
Then I posted on main again. This time I waited 4 hours to get it approved.
---
Don't play games please, if you are. Above is the story of how it happened.
---
PS: The very same shadowbann happened to the below thread. It was manually approved 6 hours later. You can notice nobody realized the post on time from the lack of Goon shitposts in there, if you don't believe me.

I'm generally on board with the idea, but I'm curious as to some of your choices. Specifically, why are Gobbins (Horde) and BlazingBunny (NC.) on your list?
---
Incidentally, I'm kinda glad that folks like Aryth don't campaign. They've got a bloc of voters that they represent. That bloc is big enough to get a representative, so they should have a representative, and the fact that they don't campaign beyond that means more air time for other candidates.

"good" post
---
Needs more purple
---
It’s like starting a fire and asking, “Why is this shit burning?” 
---
Did you even attempt to start off with an intelligent reply or did you decide it’s best to go as low as those “morons”, which makes you what? A reddit legend? 
---
I saw zero attempts of starting an intelligent debate/conversation, instead it was all “fucking idiots, morons, lifeless dumbasses”, not very productive or constructive imo, but then again it seems that was your goal in the first place.
---
My initial comment was the impression you gave me judging by your responses to other people, if I was wrong then why did you take it so personal?
---
How many people really have that much cash to shit away on caps? I mean, I tried buying a few injectors to see what it's like boosting my skill queue: waste of money.
---
1. Dump Dominion combat site "forever farms".  They broke and continue to break the game.
---
2. Leave mining as an income source and materials faucet, but increase warp-off times so that mining without protection is suicidal, even for a bot.
---
3. Combat income available from killing player ships and structures.  Payout = market value of what you killed less insurance.
---
4. Explo combat sites remain, and are the source of meta and rare modules.  Density can be influenced by system upgrades.
---
You'd essentially eliminate bots.  You'd provide more driver for conflict.  You'd cut the insane income levels that make combat losses essentially meaningless for top-tier orgs.  You'd turn Eve back into a game where there is real existential struggle and risk again, instead of the farmville that it's become.
---
No worries it happens all the time, lol. Most Eve players expect dudes. If you have ever had an Elizabeth in your life, majority of the time our nickname tends to be Lizardbreath, =)
---
Things every wormholer knows you can do for 500.

&gt;(Only kidding :) While I'd appreciate your votes, vote for who you think will make Eve better)

yeah that's pretty much you.

If it would make you happy, then no.
---
Where can I find some bots?
---
I'm literally saying it's the automod that's removing my posts and it's a technical issue. Some of you folks are completely blinded by hatred to comprehend what you're reading lol.

PS: I don't have to know how reddit automods work to be a CSM. I haven't used reddit before Eve.
---
Dat reaction then our fleet landin on head

That's not a shitfit. It uses meta modules for fitting space is my guess without dropping it into Pyfa.
---
Its quite easy to find on zkill some all-DED fits or officer fits that are shitfit though.
---
Also, it's considered a mark of intelligence by the intelligent to use the cheapest fit possible that gets the intended job done.

I don't see PH (not Panfam) as a "null mega empire" in the sense I mean. Mega empires for me aren't only defined by their size but also the main activity they foster. Krabbing should come first. BRAVE was this way too, but perhaps recently changed.
---
Gobbins and his entity actually represents a playstyle which chases after PvP and content, rather than organized krabbing. A second such person is Elo Knight. I think these are the best kind of people who can represent nullsec. I also owe him a spot in my ballot because his is the only bloc vote adding me somewhere. 
---
Blazingbunny is a Northern dude but with lots of other interests in mind.
---
I just shared my own specific ballot which was shaped taking many nuanced reasons into account. Goes without saying that other people are free to add and remove candidates. All I'm calling for is a ballot of independent candidates representing underrepresented playstyles.

We already have a great example of what would happen: Activision Blizzard. Instead of having a chance of being heard you would have actually no chance. You could drum up support of nearly the entire vocal part of the community against some change and they won't even acknowledge it. 
---
&gt;The correct way to deal with a shitty situation like this is to de-legitimize or remove what they value, even if its not much. Thats all you can do.

The CSM's value? You can't take it away by insulting them. Or are you talking about something else here?
---
Ok but nebulas first ;)
---
WITCH HUNT
---
He's got my vote! By the way, should I use all my 10 spots? Coz to be honest beyond spot 5, I kinda found it difficult to care about any of the candidates?
---
I have played the game for almost 10 years with just 1 account. I have on my account one main character that has pvp skills, 1 market/hauler character and one factional warfare frigate pvp alt. It's doable but not easy. Usually people have at least 2 accounts.

Im not sure what the point is. CCP was recently bought by a Korean grinder. CSM could obviously do nothing. So you had nothing to lose.

&gt;The CSM's value? You can't take it away by insulting them. Or are you talking about something else here?

Im talking about the value of the CSM to CCP. If all we can do is to take away something CCP values, thats what we should do.
---
"I don't see the addition of P2W mechanics as destabilising the game."
---
For the love of god I hope he doesn't make CSM. CCP doesn't need this particular Wormtongue whispering in their ears.
---
I didn't even realize t5s were possible in frigs, two buddies and I were struggling in fairly blingy retris/worms in t4s.
---
"I'm ok with CCP selling gold bullets for real money because EVE isn't all about PvP"
---
There is no possible excuse for voting for this flaming pile of dogshit
---
Yeah same. I just assumed it wasn’t possible. Though I can solo T3s pretty easily, so I guess it’s possible with the right fit and actually maxed skills
---
Of course he would say the game isn't just about PvP. It's also about ship spinning and playing PUBG while wondering what that UNDOCK button is for.
---
On a more serious note, this is exactly why Matterall has no business on the CSM.

Agility and warp activation should not be linked. Split the two, generate content. 
---
Naturally this bugs over the whole prop mod into warp trick, but we're trying to make eve dangerous again, right?

Oh and you'd have to either rework the inertial stabilizer mod or create a new one that accelerates warp drive activation.

---
&gt;Im talking about the value of the CSM to CCP. If all we can do is to take away something CCP values, thats what we should do.
---
I disagree completely. Just because you have been playing for long enough to be bitter, jaded and be like "well this ship isn't right enough, best burn it down to to the water line." Doesn't make that the right way to go about it.
---
CCP presents the CSM as a focus group when in reality theyseemuse them more as a sounding board to see how crazy they think the playerbase would go if they made changes x, y, and Z. But then they go ahead and make them anyway regardless of the feedback from the CSM which really defeats the whole purpose.
---
Its almost like people don't wanna lose their ship or something.

Chargeback bans are extremely common in a variety of games.

Are you having your butt buddies come in to spam downvotes on anybody who disagrees with you to hide the fact that you're full of shit?
---
There's no way anybody with half a brain and even minuscule knowledge of Goons would seriously believe the garbage you're spewing.
---
Goons literally have the best retention in the game. A few morons losing titans because they turn off pings and are stupid obviously should be laughed at. They either refuse to listen, or their corp leadership is incompetent and can't reiterate the rules or translate them for non-english members. 9 times out of 10, it's because they're fucking dumb and refuse to listen. And those fools definitely don't represent GSF as a whole.
---
Pretty much. So what can we do here? Not much, but we can at least not vote. This makes it more difficult for CCP to pretend to have the support of the community.
---
He’s pretty awful but not for the reasons you stated. Who even knows what the guy stands for or what’s to contribute? I have no clue. Just listen to his interviews. He has folks like noraus on who we all know had 30 accounts banned and 1.5tril deducted for botting and RMT. That, according to ccp’s last banwave announcement accounts for more than half the bots in game. Matterall can’t even bother to ask the question about it, he was too busy gushing like a little fanboy. Hard to argue he could ever be an advocate for the community.
---
Right, but what's the deal with that ?
---
How does the system work ?
---
Do i get more votes ?; is it just 1 vote and it goes to the first in the series that has a chance of entering ... what's the deal ?
---
The fact that this was downvoted literally proved your point.
---
Anything pro-goon posted on this cancerous sub just gets shuffled under the downvote rug by weaponized autism.
---
GoTG is trying to embrace the meme and call themselves Deadco. So far people outside of the coalition seem not to give a shit
---
&gt;The CSM's job is not nor should it be to speak on the business side of CCP operations. 
---
Why did you bring up Activision/Blizzard then?
---
&gt;I disagree completely. Just because you have been playing for long enough to be bitter, jaded and be like "well this ship isn't right enough, best burn it down to to the water line." Doesn't make that the right way to go about it.
---
So you think we should keep giving them what they want while they shit on us?
---
Okay well to play EVE and have really any fun with it you’re going to have to accept you’ll lose ships. If you are looking for a truly casual space flight game you might want to look at Elite Dangerous or No Mans Sky. Also you should never be betting everything in one ship. Rule number 1 of Eve is don’t fly what you can’t afford to lose. 
---
Your characters aren’t going to be worth anything on the exchange so you might as well keep them. It’s not like those skills are useless. Just start training now for what you want to do.
---
If you think about it, that's kind of sad.
---
But then again, I work in politics. Generally, we're happy when folks like you don't vote.
---
Got a great deal on a GTX 770, been using that instead of whatever the hell my CPU had integrated.
---
Holy balls, EVE on max settings is pretty.
---
Because FC said to shoot it. Why the fuck else?
---
I'm prepared to be wrong, but lying?  That implies I knowingly misstated something I knew.  Of course if you just wanted to be an asshole to someone that took the time to answer someone's question, op success.
---
Few years ago (2014-2015, there were no skill injectors yet I think), when I was talking to my space-geek friends and telling them about my love towards EVE, all of them (3 dudes), raised an eyebrow and instantly reacted with:  
---
"It's full of pay2win bullshit."
---
Occasionally, while being around communities in other games I do the same, I mention EVE and I get that kind of a response.
---
Be real on this shit right here, EVE - outside of our community - is marked as content for "pay2win douche-bags"  for a long time already.
---
Mm, as an actual Red Frog person, thought I'd say hi.     
---
'Chiyachan' is my main account and also within RFF - I consider them my family and my home within EVE.    
---
I can 100% say that although my friends and family MIGHT be where you say they are, nobody actually knows.     
---
Because we work on servicing anywhere within New Eden, we operate under strict guidelines to not discuss our in-game affiliations.     
---
The article you linked is over 5 years old. Things change since then. I believe the CEOship has changed ~3 times since. We're now managed by Which Frog. He's a RFFer too - for life. He hasn't got TIME to do anything else but lead us. 
---
Addition, cactusjack48 isn't associated to the Frog Alliance as far as I can see (Feel free to nudge me in alliance chat if I'm wrong!). They're run by 'Lyn Fel'. I asked on Discord if that was a Reddit name for her (or her team), she says no. \o/    
---
Regarding other haulers that may be able to help you:     
---
-PushX    
---
-Haulers Channel    
---
-Public Contracts     
---
-Galactic Hauling Solutions Inc. \o/ (For the sake of honesty, I'll mention them)    
---
Large alliances also have their own internal logistics groups which work out nicely. If you find out who they are, you can slip stuff in with them to move content, they don't care WHO sets up contracts, as long as they get paid to move things.     
---

Anyway, have a lovely evening and fly safe.

Literally your only option to not give them what they want is to unsub. Literally the only thing they want out of you is your sub money. 
---
Advocating the disbanding of the CSM would actually be a point for them because the CSM costs money to maintain.
---
What are you talking about...? You get 10 votes, they get tallied up at the end, most votes win. Crazy stuff, I know
---
The amount of games that keep critical info client-side is seriously astounding nowadays. You'd think they'd learn to keep SOME things server-side, and let the server decide who gets to see what, when, but nope. We can trust the clients right?
---

---
Fuck Aryth
---
Yeah well ... i've been away for a while, so not sure how this works, do all the votes have equal value ?
---
What happens if i select 2 guys only, do each get 5 of these votes individually ?
---
Id imagine nothing happens if you only use 2 out of the 10. I only voted for two people myself.
---
Pressing anything autofills the GSF approved candidates for you.

Because it is. Frustrated of getting owned over and over again in fw space? Get that credit card, buy plex, get some skill injectors, HG implant set and an 500m bling frig and your the boss.

EVE is the most pay2win game i personally ever played.

Every single thing you can achieve in eve can be bought on day one if your wallet is big enough. There is basically nothing you cant buy with real money.

---
Gosh if you could have heard comms during that. John almost lost it again. That OP wasnt the brightest show of organized super activity. I counted 3 obvious fails.
---
They can be rough, but you have good options for tank and projection, dps at that size and some have good speed. I liked using Brutixes or Myrms, Canes can be nice, just pick your region and targets well for your roaming TZ and get acquainted with local pop responses in low/null, sometimes you die in a fire but still kill things,  sometimes you'll just get baited or ganked. The more you practice and choose though, its a great suze tier for solo, and cheap for T1s with insurance.
---
That would depend on what you mean, ratting, pvp, or mining wise?
---
Sansha too.
---
Forgot, i like HFI with Neut/Smartbomb and 425s or 720s, but dual neut definitely adds a gank factor on active tank enemies or kills tackle mods. Ive just been ec-300'd too many times, gence SB

I'm guessing you guys had a good laugh, wish I could hear those comms. It's only a ceptor anyway not a huge deal. I think most of the mistakes were because nobody expected me to be a r/madlad and go for that ceptor in front of so many supers.
---
Edit :sentences
---
Wow those looks awesome. Man I wish ccp merch wasn't so garbage I'd buy that shit.
---
I rorqual mine and super rat and I’m the one suggesting this so
---
[CCP uses STV voting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bz0quq/csm_voting_how_stv_works_in_5_seconds_5/). You're ranking your preferences in case your first/second/third/etc candidates get eliminated.
---
Yep we did and John got himself a new ceptor shortly after.
---
Because obviously as a whaler deploying to the region with the most whales to play Eve as I like is hateful. So is making explicit the discussed Goon plans to get me banned on reddit in the year I'll run for CSM. Definitely shows hate.
---
No mate. I don't play that metagame. Goons leaders play the game where they direct hate to ingame rivals, and linemembers typically drink the produced koolaid.
---
That would put the cost of the average Super at roughly the entire GDP of planet earth for a year.
---
&gt; I think i heard...
---
This is a reply to the whole paragraph there but tbh don’t trust anything from anybody on a public forum if you can’t validate it or cross validate it somehow yourself. Includes me and I’ll admit it. For all you know I’m just a mouthy flair baiting troll. As far as that goes: NC. didn’t shoot our structures while we hit Branch but they also were still blue to GotG and not us. There were a few times they showed up on the opposite side of a BR but nothing major. The bigger issue is that GotG was still blue to NC. and not us, making for some interesting situations in NC. controlled space.
---
&gt; I'm however curious about the fallout of the deal though, from what Sort said it, as well as Killah indicated when the deal was first announced, NC. was in full acknowledgement of the deal, 
---
I’ve heard four different stories about this that changed over the course of time. First Killah didn’t know anything, then he knew but didn’t tell Vince, then he knew and told Vince, then finally he knew and Vince agreed.
---
I’m not sure why the story seems to have evolved or whether this is one of those situations where something was tried to keep quiet then wasn’t or what. My money is generally on Sort having done his thing and NC. trying to save face honestly given what I’ve been told by other sources because it’s what adds up. It’s possible I’m wrong but it’s also possible that Sort is laundering money through the Faction Fort deal for his personal gain. What’s most questionable here is why the Fort deal was negotiated after Imperium forces were already starting to withdraw and what the actual details were.
---
&gt; meaning that  they were consulted during the negotiations, which is weird, because Horde actions and now what you and NC. are saying seem to indicate that they were caught by surprised by the deal. Do you know if NC. was aware and in agreement of the deal prior to it being announced?
---
I’m not Sort (or Killah or Vince) but I can tell you that there was a lot of coordination that was going on that involved daily discussions and those discussions involved a lot of surprise the day after the public announcement of the Fort deal from all parts, including plenty of dudes who *shouldnt* have been surprised if NC. was in agreement with it. Ultimately though I’m not going to be able to provide proof here but I can tell you something that’s technically public knowledge: GotG had been using Horde space to mine in their rorquals under our response fleets. This was something offered to them as a way to help them. That had brought increased attention and danger to Horde in general but was done to benefit the coalition as all the ore those dudes were mining was getting sent back to GotG. Those dudes got sent home immediately when the news hit. When we sent them home, Sort’s response was to call Gobbins emotional and to make vague threats about “making decisions he [Gobbins] would regret later.”
---
You can draw your own conclusions but I can tell you that internally there was a lot of shock and disbelief. Afterwards was when I started hearing and seeing people saying that evolving story about NC.
---
I'm with you on most other points, but I disagree here. The Horde culture is pvp based, but it is mostly just another big null entity. It's hard to avoid being that given all of the safeties added in the past few years.
---
Honestly, finding a small npc null group would probably be a good shout. Bear in mind that casual groups will have casual content, so don't expect them to be mega active. I hear Good Sax in stain are ustz and decent folks; I don't really know much about syndicate, great wildlands or venal ustz groups though. I wouldn't bother looking in any of the other npc null areas.
---
&gt; I mean, if I went through that shit I wouldn't be keen to return either.
---
I mean if I had gotten away with murder I’d probably keep my head down, yeah.
---
the one that is linked
---
Matterall has no business being on the CSM
---
and yet, that's not what pay2win means
---
&gt; The game has no issue finding new players.

Objection, assumes facts not in evidence.  And the rest is high level generalities.  "Moar better tutorial" is just as helpful as "Moar better marketing."

Can't buy rl skill
---
get fucked matterall
---
Okay, firstly, don't mine in low sec. It is simply not worth it.
---
Secondly, you need guidance. Eve is not the kinds game u can simply learn on your own sadly. When I started, I joined a friend's group but it didn't really teach how to play the game. I was left being pretty bad for good 2 months. I only learned when I started flying with a NPSI lowsec group called &lt;SWArm&gt;.
---
So, get yourself in a newbie corp, I recommend you stay for a month, you will learn the ropes faster as well as the mechanics and will be a lot more able. You will also find ur interests faster be it mining, pvp, or whatever and be rightly guided on ur skillset.
---
After a month in a newbie corp feel free to leave if u want to or stay with the alliance and go and do what u like where u like. That's what I would say.
---
When will Panfam learn? They're only helping the Imperium by killing stuff.
---
I’m not OJ Simpson, dipshit.
---
I used to like you, you know?
---
Do you happen to be the guy asking in NPC corp chat about not being able to tank the low-sec belt rats because you keep running out of cap, as well as them jamming you while mining?
---
Between him and marshy hes like 20% to a seat, nice

Can we like, have ccp save money om flight tickets and just cancel the whole csm thing. They can use the money to get the AT back.
---
He always looks like his dog just died on stream. 
---
Like the show, not the man.
---
So if two 1 week old players go at each other, one who spent $500 on the game and one who didnt spend a penny, who would win?
---
&gt; if you're in INIT?
---
did you mean:  
---
&gt; if you're IN IT?
---
Waow. Please never gain a position of power or advisory anywhere.
---
Fraternity don't bot, you're not allowed to bot in fraternity. Stop being retarded. You can't control what your renter alts do.
---
Why isnt not voting an option? They want that vote.
---
&gt;Advocating the disbanding of the CSM would actually be a point for them because the CSM costs money to maintain.
---
Yes, why would they be paying for something that is irrelevant to us?
---
Send spankme yah a tell in game bud il give u 100.000.000 to start out with. U Will lose alot in the beginning. Eve has so much to offer but Will take alot of time to learn. Im still a noob and been playing 1 year.
---
Fly safe.
---
No, not me.  I’m ratting not mining.
---
At one week it's anyone's game. 6 months or a year in there'd be a difference if they both learned intangible skills at the same rate or in the same way. But then it would begin to even out again.
---
Moths are beautiful in their own right. 
---
All that is gold does not glitter. ;)
---
This didn’t even occur to me, but yeah, that’s a good idea.  How would I even find who it was after I’ve been sent back to the clone factory?  Is there a log or record I can access?
---
Ah OK, yeah, ratting anomalies in low-sec is not really worth it most of the time. Doing DED combat and exploration sites however, those are definitely worth it if done carefully.
---
It is an undeclared exploit because they semi-closed the only known exploit vector.
---
Ever kill the response fleet?
---
Do not mine in low. If you want to mine, join some nullsec industrial corp.
---
https://zkillboard.com/ search for yourself, there is wa way to do it in game but i havent played in a while and i forgot/dont know if its changed
---
Are we considering injectors or not? Because buying plex without injectors is just isk.
---
If you don't know how to fly your ship, you're dead regardless.
---
Example : the hundreds of shit fit cruisers, battlecruisers, and battleships that die weekly on lowsec gates
---
Good advice.  I’ve already been looking at newbie corps but figured I’d try learning a few more things solo before applying.  After this though I think a Corp is my next move.
---
I agree with Roatus. It's possible but quite a reduction in capability and increase in risk, a combination which I wouldn't exactly consider fun. To do missions you typically need to sustain your tank and damage dealing, and sadly (for missions) the orthrus sacrifices both types of sustainability for mobility. I'd try using a gnosis or praxis as they're super cheap at the moment, and then you can test out how to use drones! 
---
Sadly a lot of ship models are very dated, but there are a few good ones such as the Myrmidon, Harbinger and Hurricane. All three are excellent battlecruisers and good for L3s.
---
Lol 2333333333333333 could be a Lucky number there
---
Once per system, not once per category, if that helps any? So you can run each series twelve times, three times per each of the factions. Euni has a list of systems: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career_Agents
---
Yeah but you can buy a worm which more than makes up for it
---
Buying plex &gt; selling it for ISK &gt; buying bunch of implants for stat buff in all kinds of shit.
---
I do agree most of these guys get shitted on, because there is really EVE skill.
---
But outside of our community this is pay2win, whether you like it or not.
---
Its almost like they went against their normal design decisions involving building a ship to fill a role, and instead just built some ships to be powerful and unique.
---
Special resists, special damage mechanic, special bonus roles, special everything.
---
Its a bad design precedent that old CCP knew better to avoid.
---
Might as well make World of SpaceThunder Citizens, a 15 v 15 pvp combat game with gold ammo, loot boxes, Real Money exclusive Pirate ships, and gold ammo in loot boxes.
---
THAT JUST GETS ME HARDER!!
---
I dunno, I guess a laugh? Good point.
---
Fuck, and I almost made it the whole day without reading something that made me dumber for having seen it.
---
Or try learn something from death, not just repeat it. You don't even know how you died.
---
1. Check and exploit local chat. Assume anyone there is coming for you.
---
2. DSCAN VVVVVVVV if anyone got probe out you should be running.
---
3. Hisec DED combat sites are still profitable except rouge drone asteroid.
---
4. Check your killmail, there will be a list of people that has involved in killing you, right click and message them for advice. Most players are friendly to new players and are willing to teach if you ask.
---
If you can buy a significant advantage with rl cash it's pay to win, even if you can still physically lose by playing like a sub 70 iq retard.
---
"huuur duur they're all the same"
---
If you really think that you are a fucking idiot. 
---
Like jesus fucking christ. 
---
America for example
---
&gt;one party, more tax cuts for rich, fuck the poor, fuck healthcare/education
---
&gt;other party, More taxes, workers rights,equality in healthcare/education
---
I will! Thanks kind internet stranger
---
(Although Eve has now put me in the paranoid mindset of “okay...how will this fuck me”)
---
Matterall may not be an expert on spaceships, but he is an exceptionally nice, and easy to work with, guy and his Talking in Stations Podcast is enjoyed by lots of eve players.
---
He is coming into this CSM race on a unique platform; wanting to represent the media of Eve, the creatives in our community and the interaction those aspects have with regards to new and potential players. If you can understand that, then you can decide if you want someone with that background helping CCP provide for, and expand, our community.
---
TL:DR  You don't vote for Matterall to help CCP with ship balance, you may want to vote for Matterall to help CCP with their PR and media output. Golden ammo is irrelevent in his area of interest.
---
There are ships in this game that require 1 input in a fight and win against 90% of same class ships btw
---
If they don't give their API to zkillboard it would not show up. Simply by seeing the notification would bring up the killmail if it was fairly recent.
---
I found a chart, it's basically a loop to check if you used all your votes, if/after your candidate is either elected or becomes inelligible.
---

---
It kinda becomes important to fill all ...  i think, but there are few candidates for the lowsec/wh crowds.
---
people are okay with p2w as long as you can grind for the same effect
---
see: skill injectors, PLEX
---
Votes are anonymous. They won't be able to tell who you voted for- Unless you told them "fuck the goon CSM's I voted for [highsec player]"
---
With elimination being either 'they can't run' or 'they were elected'.
---
Can't say i'm a fan of the system, nullsec is practically guaranteed the majority of seats now.
---
Vote for Dunk!
---
like i said its been a while for me so help him out
---
just remove local lmao
---
no other change needs to really be made
---
PUBG? That's so 2018. Hold my fresca while I show you APEX.
---
But then the credit card warrior spent those 6 months doing only PVP on a character with the actual skills to do so, while the other dude has had to spin a VNI all that time and barely completed his basic training for one ship. 
---
The credit card warrior can then just buy a HG slaved DD and use his super basic level of knowledge to beat any T1 frig 1v1 except for the single 500m isk (+ implants) counter ship, which the other guy unlikely has the skills to fly, nor the knowledge to bring it as he's spent half his time running a VNI.
---
&gt; Why isnt not voting an option? 
---
It is an option.
---
&gt;Yes, why would they be paying for something that is irrelevant to us?
---
Because it helps improve the quality of the game by a measurable amount. AKA it's not as worthless as you think it is.
---
Welcome to Eve
---
&gt;Because it helps improve the quality of the game by a measurable amount. AKA it's not as worthless as you think it is.
---
It simply doesnt. Quite the contrary.
---
Perfect! Thanks for putting me on the path to apprenticeship, and in time, sweet cold vengeance!
---
or friendship, i once flew with a dude who awoxed my first freighter
---
Clearly not or they would eliminate it as it costs them money to maintain.
---
It kinda pay2win, except when you kill them because they're trash, you get to keep half the stuff they paid for.
---
APEX? That's old hat, hold my Long sword while I show you Mordhau.
---
You are using the term "gank" incorrectly. Gank is when you are killed in high sec by disposable ships before Concord can arrive. You sir just got killed.
---
You forgot the /s at the end.
---
He is doing a pretty decent marathonian long-time approach and this is good.
---
Shoot I came back into the game after 11 years last week and I'm just kind of lost lol.
---
I believe we’re all bad at this game, some are just less bad then others :p
---
&gt;Fraternity don't bot, you're not allowed to bot in fraternity. Stop being retarded. You can't control what your renter alts do.
---
you can't control what your alts do? 🤔
---
This game is literally ONLY about pvp. No one would even touch the PVE if this was a single player game. The only reason people play is cause there are others on the server. Its all pvp and player interaction
---
He's not my alt he's my brother retard
---
Still a nice thing to see younglings thrive.
---
PR isn't in the roadmap
---
Yes, its beneficial to CCP, not to players. It allows CCP get "community input" without risking scrutiny of their ideas. But its a good point that this is so valuable to CCP they are willing to pay for not having their ideas in public.
---
What I'm reading the Proteus was a different beast then before they nerfed them.
---
Road isn't in the roadmap
---
THAT'S STILL A BAD THING.
---
You can interact with other players without being 'vs' each other.
---
What a great video.. well done
---
I recommend you pick a character, pref gallente, and just do high sec security missions. Follow the ship chain all the way up to battleships. Take it slow. Gallente and drones specifically because every race makes some use of drones, so drone skills are never wasted skill points. 
---
Drones 5 first. Then get a tristan. Highs get salvage and tractor. Shield or armor tank, whichever you prefer.  
---
Then get an Algos. Once you're in the algos, start training for salvage drones. 
---
Then get a Vexor. Start doing lvl 2 sec missions. You can get by in lvl 2 missions with light drones, but start training for medium and heavy drones as well.
---
Get a myrmiddon after you get your drone skills up to par. Start running level 3s.
---
Get a domi. Start running level 4s.
---
And that is your character's purpose. To run lvl 4 missions. It's not great money, but it's easy, you learn the ropes, and you have a character you can always switch to and run missions with, and you'll never be broke unless you do something silly.
---
You can also go the exploration route, which is a little more risk, much higher reward, but I'd recommend you at least have a vexor running level 2s with salvage drones before you start down that path. Even running lvl 2s, outfitting an explorer ship is only a few hours running, and it increases your standing with that race, meaning the government taxes you less.
---
Savage
---
I learned something about Russia today tyvm!
---
That's a good idea. Home hole site policy is always interesting. I know eve uni keeps em as bait because as  a C2, Innuendo sees quite a few daytrippers. It'll definitely depend a bit on the class of the home hole.
---
im bat at everything, i go ratting i get ganked, i go mining i get ganked, and obviously when i go pvp i get ganked too
---
How is it not beneficial to players to have something that makes the game better in it?
---
Here's a quick simulation of the response to any change that CCP proposed to the greater community: "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
That's why they don't present stuff to you and me.
---
Tried, really not worth it... First the spawn in random!
---
Some times a few frigates, some times a few frigates and cruisers, some times only Battleships.
---
On top of they using electronic warfare to break your lock, or fuck your aim etc.
---
Also, the loot is SHIT! &gt;.&gt;
---
It's really not worth to engage them, some times they are shit, some times they have enough DPS to kill a T2 cruiser! --"
---
And honestly you don't have to worry about them, just pop the loot pinata and warp out before they even land on grid o/
---
Ah okay thanks—so much to figure out still.  I stand corrected!  Plain killed, it is.
---
No, you didn't. You've been claiming from the beginning that I did what I was accused of, and that CCP somehow decided to just pretend I was innocent. I guess it's too damn difficult for you idiots to simply take what they said at face value that they made a mistake. 
---
That's what happened.  Leave the tin-foil at home.
---
No fucking way. Not my votes.
---
was nice to fly with you guys. very entertaining. still hate you tho &lt;3
---
Hi man! I'm also a greenie, if I may give you one tips is to google a lot, like really a lot.  You won't get everything in one day (or even one month), but step by step you stack knowledge and experience.
---
This sub, the eve university website, YouTube and a lot of other sites and forums are full of infos, guide, tutorials and other useful resources. The learning curve is hard but this community compensates by being helpful as fuck.
---
You can find your combat log in your character sheet (click on your picture in the Neocom menu). 
---
And yes, you should ask to join them. Most groups will be hesitant to invite you to corp right away, but they might let you tag along and be either bait or tackle.
---
Filthy Sandrackers
---
protip: rebind D-Scan to space bar.
---
No one is good at Eve; some are just more proficient than others. That said, you’ll learn a lot more and more quickly if you join a reputable corporation with experienced members.
---
Just to clarify. I like the fit, it's not shitty, but compared to what I was imagining it is a shitfit as I was imagining very specific, blingy hawks.
---
The whole interview sounds like a pitch to try to get hired at CCP and the CSM is a good way for him to get an in at CCP by meeting devs personally.
---
Check you don’t already have another ship in the station, you only get the free one if you have no ships in the station
---
&gt;How is it not beneficial to players to have something that makes the game better in it?
---
Its not making the game better, its helping CCP push their shitty ideas.
---
&gt;That's why they don't present stuff to you and me.
---
They have been given incredibly constructive suggestions over the years, some even being implemented due to how correctly it predicted the issues with CCPs idea (after being added to the game of course).
---
They dont make things public because they are shit and they cant successfully argue for them.
---
The game is already compromised in this respect.  It has been since Plex came out.  I can use real money, buy plex in game, sell it on the market and with the ISK buy ... faction ammo (or whatever else I want).
---
I'm not saying this is a good thing btw but I don't think there's anything particularly heinous in what he said here, especially in the context of what he said after it, i.e. essentially judge each proposal on its merits.
---
Thank you for the fit. I will check out the video as well!
---
Are you in null sec? If so war is happening, so a lot of activity, provi is leanyate on greys, but reds are a no, including orange. High/Low sec is another story, depending on the situation pvp can be rigged by the other player by bringing in a fleet, mining can be camped by players that are cloaked and they hit you, and ratting, that depends on how good your ship is, or how your fit is.
---
I know you're memeing, but he's basically the ideal imperium Goon but happens to be in NC.
---
stale
---
Not possible. We all know StainGuy is Hedliner's shitposting alt. How do you think he always has the hot scoop on corps leaving?
---
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come across like that. I was just genuinely surprised that such a cheap ship could run T5 darks. The fit is nicely put together but its degrees cheaper than what I expected. I also used the word shitfit in the wrong context. My apologies to /u/overworked_dev, I didn't mean to insult you. Thank you for your help.
---
Join pandemic horde. I need more targets to shoot
---
&gt; No, you didn't. 
---
I’m glad you can read my mind but only selectively read my post history.
---
It’s ok though, I know who my #1 vote was last CSM election cycle and it sure as shit wasn’t Killah or Sort...
---
&gt; You've been claiming from the beginning that I did what I was accused of, and that CCP somehow decided to just pretend I was innocent.
---
“Somehow”? I feel like being threatened with a lawsuit over a videogame would probably dissuade most people regardless of what’s gone on but I guess that’s a “somehow.” Yeah.
---
&gt; I guess it's too damn difficult for you idiots to simply take what they said at face value that they made a mistake.
---
I’m more bothered by the fact that they never explained the odd market manipulation that was going on, or why it happened, or why they suspected you and the others who were banned at the time. Or why you reacted the way you did.
---
The reason I don’t like you is because you came out and decided to act the way you’ve been acting ever since. Bile and fury, despite the fact that after the first day most people were already on your side despite the fact that literally no-one will ever know what actually happened.
---
&gt; That's what happened.  Leave the tin-foil at home.
---
Hm. Funny.
---
You'll always be broke because your suggestion is the biggest waste of time possible. What is this, 2010?
---
You can shoot people in game and still think they are competent and knowledgeable.
---
If it's not too much to ask, would you mind describing the tactics you use to use this ship in the abyss?
---
Stitch seems like a pretty knowledgeable person
---
Reminder that Sgeine/Jesse was closely associated with Noraus and helped organize the WinterCo renters for quite some time, and is thereby complicit in everything he posts about in the above statement.
---
Lol show me a screenshot substantiating your claim. Or shall I post one that refutes it and further embarrass you?
---
Wheres that pitchfork bot at when you need it?
---
The isk sink we’ve been waiting for
---
Sansha's robots having slaves hmm
---
He was belt ratting in lowsec, not mining.
---
Wouldn't be that far out if the gold bullets can be resold. After all, right now you can sell Plex to buy elite pirate ammo and get an advantage over people using Navy ammo.
---
Have you seen in-game and Reddit lately? It’s way too easy.
---
Belt Ratting in lowsec is risky, but worth it if you can farm clone soldiers and mordu spawns. However if you want to minimize the odds of getting jumped you want to stick to combat signatures (the ones you need to scan for) that way anyone who wants to attack you needs to scan you down first which if you're paying attention to your dscan will show you any probes in range and if you start seeing multiple combat probes within 1au align to a safe spot and prepare to gtfo.
---
Yeah but we gotta educate the null sec dwellers so they can see the riches and bring more activity to jspace 
---
Who am I kidding it’d just be one more krab to kill
---
That always makes me giggle....
---
Clade Runner.
---
in a 1v1 contest of equally skilled players, the player who pays more IRL money will win. If players can literally pay to win, the game might be pay to win. I love the game, personally, but come on.
---
This is what nullsec warfare should be like most of the time. Brutal fleet fighting without dropping supers at every chance.
---
Ah there’s the good ole “goal posts Harvey” I know.
---
Everything you doubt on, do it with a dedicated alt. It's the way to go anyway to test out a few playstyles.
---
Just Zillow Detroit
---
Good stuff. Thanks!
---
So you're they guy always losing hawks that's driving up the price of compact missile guidance computers
---
&gt; Its not making the game better, its helping CCP push their shitty ideas.
---
You know this for certain? Despite the fact that you've also claimed that we don't know about said ideas because they are only presented to the CSM?
---
No, I can't read your mind. I can just read what you've written. And you've said a bunch of times both before and after the it was entirely possible that I did what I was accused of, even after CCP said they were wrong and the whole thing was a mistake. 
---
I never threatened CCP with a lawsuit. I never needed to. As I have said multiple times, as soon as we started talking, they did the right thing. It never had to go any farther. 
---
All of the parts of the story are public now - it had nothing to do with market manipulation or any of that nonsense. One of my guys sold a Molok, somebody thought he did so because of leaks, conclusions were jumped to, and the rest is history. None of it happened. It was a mistake. 
---
The only bile and fury I have are for idiots like you who keep claiming that I did something wrong despite being cleared. That's the one part of this whole thing that I still find annoying. Folks rushed to believe CCP when this whole thing went down, then refused to believe them when they accepted they made a mistake and owned up. That pisses me off because they could not have been more clear, and I denied breaking the NDA from the beginning. 
---
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
---
ah Eve's biggest POS bitch, aren't there some citadels you should be fueling somewhere ?
---
What vexor fit?
---
You will do well young padowan
---
The people who play in large Null Blocs are pretty much NPCs at this point.
---
I'm not sure all types of sites are doable with frigs at t5 (by this i mean reliably doable for a combined fleet price of less than 3 bil including implants for each character) but darks and electric are doable in frigs reliably although i only know of assault frigate fits for them.
---
