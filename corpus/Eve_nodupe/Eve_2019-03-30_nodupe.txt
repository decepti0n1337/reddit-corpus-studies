It's simply a guffin, an artifical item or point of technological progress that the capsuleers are bringing about. The older more traditional empires ideologically oppose this, and the conflicts between the two may spiral into unwinnable wars or otherwise chaos. If we get too powerful, and reach too far, we might wind up with a war against highsec itself.

I would not do it. Not until your kid is older and has some better understanding at least. Maybe get her to one of the easier games with limited online interaction like Path of Exile or something like that. MMOs are not good for young kids.

T3 Abyss, DED sites, up to 4/10 for alpha, maybe 5/10s but that would be pushing it on a solo account and the sites may be hard to find on a weekend as a lot of people will be flying around and doing them.

Can I get a quick recap? Been a bit ootl here.

Make daily alpha the only kind of injector, useable up to 20m sp by any toon whether it's alpha or omega. Then delete large and small injectors.
---
Newbies can catch up, abuse is difficult with the daily limit, FOTMs barred by being unable to use past 20m.

If you're gonna present an interview on written form, please make a *formatting distinction* **between** ^the ~~question~~ and `the answer`.

Fighters with scram would instagib all small gangs, getting a carrier dropped on you right now, you can get pointed but you can still mwd/boosh/mjd to dodge. A scramming fighter shuts all that down. Scramming fighters would be the most cancerous blight on New Eden to ever exist, eclipsing even lurch hictors in their grossness.
---
once you pick a ship the general idea for any combat site would be the same, but depending on the nuances, you may need to attain different numbers in certain aspects (range, dps, reps etc.) for the most efficient return. each faction has one or two ded sites that can be considered the bread and butter for a certain level, and they often have some sort of challenge that needs to be met in order to complete the site. it can be stasis towers, neuts, active rep structure with loot inside, or in case of angel cartel, [our pride and joy](https://zkillboard.com/ship/17749/).
---
i'm sorry
---
I can see how that is unclear, I will keep it in mind for next time. I just kept the questions **bold** and the answers in regular text. Thanks for pointing it out though.
---
L4s vary on your playstyle and market swings. if you kick back and mess around a lot you will make as little as 50 mil / hr if you go full retard non-stop mind numbing blitz grind you can farm up to 100-120 mil / hr. the second major difference is that if you do full clears and kickback then like 50-60% of your income will be immediate from bounties and mission completions, with the remainign being the LP. If you blitz then like 90% of your income will be LP, which has a huge market swing dependancy. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
L5s give a ton of LP but aren't really worth it considering all the effort and set-up it takes. Plus ideally you wanna be in a LS corp / alliance for them with good agent access. The set up plus pulling toons plus everything else is just too much of a PITA.
---
If you want to do missions, then best I think is just to do L4s sometimes blitz a bit but kick back most of the time and not skip burners, just do them as you get them. This will give you moderately good income while not being autistic to the point that it makes you throw up.
---
Another day another low-effort shitpost. EVE is fine but r/eve is dead.

The questions are/have been bolded.

Would it be completely impossible to create a tengu that can run any ded site, or would such an attempt simply result in significantly decreased efficiency in all sites?

I agree about capitals, add to that a couple other things. But I do want to see plex keep on rising and price the SP farms and large multiboxing ops out of the game, or at least make a really good dent in them.
---
Yes, some of the low players will be affected and will have huge problems and may go into alpha state or even quit, but I think in the long run the game will be much better without those huge negative elements. So its not a choice between what is good or what is bad, its a choice of picking lesser of the two evils.
---
pandemic horde is a newbro corp :). they also have vanguard which specializes in certain ops as far as i know. if you are a dedicated defensive pvper and help keep your fellow krabs safe you can also get into the blessed bean corp.

"Hey guys this mechanic is broken in 9/10 situations, but don't worry if you want to counter it, you MUST own a citadel, you MUST fit an inhibition module on a citadel, you MUST have ACL to gun, and you MUST sacrifice a character to man it.

Your knowledge of other game mechanics seems lacking too - as showed from your lack of knowledge on how fighters work, and your callous suggestion to 'fix tidi' as a balance solution lmao.
---
I'll go ahead and spell it out for you; balance requires tuning down something overtuned, not creating an artificial solution to counter it that requires dedicated resource.
---
More over, hilariously, its your small gangs that will be most effected by your foolish suggestions:
---
A higher percentage of your characters gunning

A higher percentage of your carrier's total offensive capability sacrificed

nope, mittani isn't, neither is asher
---
i don't think it's possible, not sure though. even if it's possible, it simply doesn't happen due to following reasons:
---
-people don't hop around regions in their pve ships, and there's no real incentive to do so.  
---
-having a single fit is not really playing into t3c strengths.  
---
-if that fit exists, it's probably better off running c3 wormhole sites, and there's probably a better fit for running c3 wormhole sites.
---
Guess they didn't want that fort anyway? Didn't even do a flyby to contest.

---
I mean scramming fighters like ruin way more setups, like your nano gang is now gonna get massively fucked by a single carrier on grid, as you can't reliable kite fighters as a nano gang. 
---
Now the reason i want a global limiter so if a command dessie get's booshed X time it's not longer allowed to boosh is to allow them to be powerful in there small gang roll without being scalable ( as the core issue comes from them scaling ). 
---
I couldn't care less about things being blown up -- for example, threads about Gold Magnates or tourney ships exploding move me not at all. But I care a lot when relationships or time frames in EVE come to an end. For example, I was incredibly sad during my first null-sec eviction (the old Gentlemen's Club being pushed out of a single constellation in Scalding Pass) and I'm still sad about it now. I was equally sad when I left a couple of the alliances that had been my home in EVE for years.
---
To me, things exploding make the game more interesting and it's the sort of thing that should be celebrated. Friendships and alliances exploding make the game less interesting, and I hate it when I see people celebrating the disbanding of an alliance (for example).
---
I hope this ends up being as epic as it sounds, good luck ahead.

Sorry to disappoint but all abyss sites are entirely doable by bots. The code is more complex than a vni not for sure, but it's definitely doable for up to T4. T5 or the new mega spawn single pocket sites, I'm not so sure about, but T4 is doable without overheating on a 1.4b gila with no implants and trivial tactics.
---
But I won't disagree that it's the only fun form of pve we have, or that it's a great material sink. Now if only the rewards weren't so niche and the demand was higher, so the income would be better... But that's probably too much to ask.

Booshing is fine and shouldn't be nerfed. Chain booshing really isn't much of a problem. It's the ability to chain boosh hundreds of ships with zero downside. Nobody whines about a 10-20 man boosh fleet. What people are upset about is a sub 100m destroyer moving 100+ battleships with absolutely no restriction.

1)4-6s is too fast even if you're in a ceptor in a system with lower than 5au radius and you automatically know what anomaly the ratter is in. Even then, them being undocked when you've shown up on Intel for multiple jumps means they are either a noon or afk, in other words trash tier "content".

2)It's a sad time when ganking ratters is considered the objective of solo/small gang roaming.

---
Caaaaaake!
---
The point of the time dependency is that you don't NEED to grind to get ahead. At least, that was the stated reason for many years before injectors came along. 
---
Keep in mind also that 80% of the effectiveness comes with 20% of the training time, generally. And there's a hard limit to how good your character-sheet skills can be. So ideally if new players specialize they can "catch up" in certain areas.
---
If it were to be reworked I'd remove a lot of the unnecessary Big Skills(tm) that everyone has to train cause it just bogs down noobs. Removing implants and just free dumping skillpoints into your brain would also be nice (a la Dust).

Honestly if the ravens play it right none of those should work that's kinda the core issue. 
---
Like sure you might be able to pick off some ravens but you will have like 10/20 raven kills while they have the fort. 
---
Let's do some math let's say they have a 250 in fleet, with 40% command destroyers ( your target ) 
---
that means 100, command destroyers that means you need to kill 1 every 18 seconds so you have to keep this up for 16 minutes just to force a warp off and reship now optimally it takes about 10 seconds for a kill ( probe land ceptor lock target naga's lock kill target ) 2 seconds for a ceptor land and 2 seconds for a lock then naga lock etc and 4 seconds per failure. this means 1 in 3 of your attempts have to succeded ( aka the fleet didn't boosh the second you cycle probes ).
---
now all you done if you manage to pull of this amazing achivement is force a warp off ( that might eat 5 minutes of the timer ) so you would need 3 of those on armor and 6 on hull to save the structure. 
---
Yeah i don't think that will work, given it takes you 16 minutes to get that far and it takes about 30 to kill it. 
---
why would they do this

PvE. I take fleets to shattered wormholes for the PvE sites. It‚Äôs nice to have a scanning alt logged in good ones, so that it‚Äôs possible to come back every week. 
---
&gt;Well I've lost 500 or so ships and I've destroyed almost 200.
---
That's actually a huge number of fights IMO, especially if you stuck only to T1 frigs the entire time. Hats off to you. I can't really give you very informed advice since I've never spent any time in lowsec, but I will say that from what I can see, the best place for small gang and outnumbered fights currently are C2 wormholes with a nullsec static. Most of the top pvp groups in the game live there, they roll their nullsec for content every day and just fight whatever they find. Look up groups like Tuskers, Hydra/Goryn Clade, Odin's Call, Kronos Ritual and similar. 
---
However, I don't see those groups using a lot of T1 frigates, so I think it's past time for you to graduate to bigger, meaner ships if you think you'd like to join them. Other than that I don't really know - either join a proper j-space corporation, or just stay on your own but still move on to bigger ships. 
---
&gt;I also haven't joined a corporation b/c in FW that means less targets and that has been the limiting factor for me.
---
In my opinion, the benefits of joining a corp will always outweigh those kinds of negatives. I would get bored within two weeks of staying on my own, but I guess everyone is different and there's nothing wrong with that.

I made the case for this in another thread. Long story short, I think the disintegrator mount is for a giant triple-disintegrator and the ship does have a set of HUGE bays behind the singularity cradle, which make more sense as fighter bays than as a drone bay.

They mentioned in the csm minutes that they may look at attributes. I assume probably making them alittle less visible more in the background and default everyone to base. 
---
But yea learning implants are lame even with citidel clone bays. I ALWAYS forget to learning clone before I log. I bet im not in it now! Lol. 
---
real hipsters sub and keep their training queue empty
---
It is strange but it makes isk the grind not skills. So your goal isnt to get max level you know. Most of a general MMO like wow is gated till your max level or x level at least. Dungeons come to mind. Altho I would like to see the fitting skills gone and targeting. You know the general shit. I understand like mining and resource processing. Even weapons *I think there should be a skill less weapon system that does comparable dps to a low to med skilled guns pilot as your kinda usless without the skills already trained* removed to make being a newbro a bit more intuitive. 
---
But I like the general system it always gives you something to progress towards. I also think the injector diminishing returns is a bit much for 50m area but I understand its a necessary evil. Just means I dont use them personally unless I extract it from my own toon.
---
The SP farms I think are a problem to some extent..
---
So, right now, it's impossible to run T5 Abyss sites in T1 non-faction cruisers in any practical way. You can do it, but you'll end up spending so much on shiny mods that you're paying only like 10% less than if you put the same fit on a HAC.
---
The time limit + travel factor, energy neutralizing, and the presence of tiny frigate NPCs would allow them to balance the sites to a specific range of Damage/Application/Tank/Cap Strength/Mobility. If they were anything like cruiser abyssal sites, a ship would probably need to perform pretty admirably in all areas, not just tank. I would expect that Marauders could do pretty well, like HACs do now, but would need to use their slots for application, mobility, cap reinforcement, etc; not just tank. 
---
ooooo I got killed by an Imp once
---
You made Wally badposting worse
---
Ooh ooh! While they're at it with trend chasing, and with nerfing those dirty, cheesy kites, they should also disallow ECM, cap warfare, weapons that shoot past 10km, local reppers, cap injectors, and double-clicking in space! Just make it a pure, mindless, approach to zero and test DPS vs EHP game! The random spawn point RNG will decide who wins!

I will upvote this because is actually one of the few posts I have seen that involve a stealth bomber doing something useful.  Its a shit tactic however because then the next FC just calls anchor but I get what you're saying.
---
I said directors, not people that pay their bills with isk. 
---
SP system is fine, maybe lower lvl 5 req. to 4 to allow new players to catch up.
---
Atm SP is gated behind ISK (injectors / implants) and time. If you want to grind XP, just grind ISK and spend them on injectors/implants.
---
As foretold in the prophecies
---
I'll walk it back. I was wrong.
---
A nano bhaal will almost always eat shit to a nightmare, even if it manages to catch it, in this day and age of 3200s...or meme cap recharging nightmares. Its also why current abyss pvp sites arent ashimmus only, either.
---
It would be a really good fight to see though.
---
TBH as much as I love this idea, I can't imagine a change I'd like. Not to say it doesn't exist but idk what I'd really like done differently. At this point I've spent so much time getting used to this one, it'd be hard to change 
---
&gt; A higher percentage of your characters gunning
---
It's still only one person gunning at a time. 
---
&gt;A higher percentage of your carrier's total offensive capability sacrificed
---
I'm more than willing to walk scram fighters back. But I'm still not conviced the problem is solved by making the cooldown so intense that it makes spearfishing impossible, which even a few seconds would do. 
---
I can 100% agree boosh ravens suck. But I'm not will to trade my snatch or spearfish feet to be rid of it. Being able to rep citadels, A citadel only scram burst projector, or even a general AoE module preventing MJDs on grid with Fortizars or Keepstars would all be better options. 
---
The double boosh for spearfishing for snatch still gets lost. 
---
He didn‚Äôt say it leads to he is saying it‚Äôs caused by.
---
Higher price is caused by fewer people spending dollars for isk on the supply side while more people are paying isk for subs on the demands side, which results in upward price pressure on both sides.
---
I do think it breaches into over powered ness due to the 100km range if you want a fleet of faster ships trying to chase your options are extremely limited.  Nerfing it to 75km would allow entire lines of cruisers and bc to chase with booshes while keeping the main power of the tactic intact.
---
This coupled with the hitboxes create a giant engagement field that is uninteractble by a large part of tactics.

querns it may come as a shock to learn that people think of you as more than just a line member. It should be a compliment to you. I don't know why you're fighting it.

Could you have not just pm the host and asked that question instead of throwing a grey cloud over the event ?

I think something similar is also in Vernor Vinge's A Fire in the Deep
---
I agree with the point to an extent, but I'm going to be a bit of a pedant here and point out that CCP doesn't *set* prices, but does influence them via SKIN releases, the existence of SKINs at all (and any other potential non-subscription services or goods), sales (and how they choose to implement them, like here where an NES Omega sale has an entirely different effect on PLEX prices than a subscription sale would), etc. Therefore, the price of plex is *influenced* by how easy it is to make ISK, but it's not *directly proportional* to it.
---
Given that, we have to assume that CCP has a goal for how much PLEX they want to sell, given how far they're willing to push the price up via the influence they do have, to try to incentivize purchases. We have to remember that for us, a "healthy in-game economy" is one with somewhat stable prices, balanced income to cost ratios, plenty of movement with decent but not excessive margins, few major radical, extremely-rapid changes in prices, etc. For CCP, a "healthy in-game economy" is whatever gets them the most purchases of subs, plex, or both. Based on EVE's history and goals, I think the sustainability of their model does actually matter to them, but I also recognize that that sustainability is almost certainly not being prioritized as long as certain "acquisition-related" short-term revenue goals are still trying to be met.
---
You don't have to; however, if you decide not to do so, you must be okay with enjoying the discrepancy between your position and the meta.
---
 EVE Online has too much number crunching , complicated menus and old clunky unintuitive mechanics for kids to  feel a sense of enjoyment also training skills takes too long for their patience.Oh and did I mention the griefing potential since player interaction is not censored in any way.
---
I hope that it's because they intend to use that gate design for something else instead. A while ago everyone was talking about / hoping for gates to other parts of New Eden.
---
T3c trig is mega cumes
---
You can look around here, or the actual Eve forums, but there aren't as many fits being posted as there used to be.
---
Another place to look is https://zkillboard.com/ and see if there's a common theme for the ship you're looking at. Of course, if they had "the best" fit then they probably wouldn't have died, lol. But you can look through a few of them and see if there's things you like about them.
---
It wouldnt have to be a big monument...
---
The cost probably won‚Äôt be an issue, although I will admit that my savings are tanking as I‚Äôve been trying new PvP fits out and learning
---
May or may not be an option, but you can remote desktop from your phone/laptop to your PC, as long as you have someone to turn your PC at home on. That way the launcher downloads all its bumf via your home connection, as EvE and all its bits load on your home PC, not your local device, and your local data usage is just enough to connect &amp; send commands to your home PC. It's janky, totally unplayable beyond checking market orders or very basic stuff, would would get you logged in and the rewards claimed, and only requires the other person to press the power button on your PC so no account sharing activity concerns. Have done it for my mister before.
---
I think he should be immortalized with a new gate named after him, to stain from lowsec 
---
Though many factors in PVP like pilot skill points, pilots piloting skills, server ticks etc. will determine the outcome of the battle, not just a well and or expensive fit ship. üòâ
---
Are you having a stroke
---
Well sure. But they asked about fitting. =)
---
Osmium is dead right? One website with all the fittings.. Lasted a bit longer than battleclinic? Lol yes we need another fitting site. Your best bet is to ask around. If your in a corp usually someone has one or can help you. 
---
Usually helps to ask for specific ship fits to as not all fits are the same what works on one ship won't on another in every case.
---
Agree abyssal sites are probably your best bet, and will take a bit of getting used to since you didn't do them before. 
---
Incursions are still a thing, but you're reliant on meeting the criteria of your local fleets which may be out of the scope of an alpha. The guys that do them take them pretty seriously, so I've always been too scared to waste their time with my noobish self. However, given you have experience - however rusty - you should be able to hang around a trade hub for a bit and see someone advertising fleets to ask what their requirements are.
---
And just so you know, there's no limit to the number of referral invites you can send, so it's not a waste to send it to someone who'll never sub and get the referer rewards, and does get you 250k free SP to get you undocked a little easier. If your new account is on a different email address to your main, you can even refer yourself, but if your worried about that seeming cheesy pretty much anyone will happily throw a link at you with no expectations of a reward down the line just to help you out.

Currently sitting at 255million SP. I dont really have a skill to really push for other than just throw it into my skill que. 
---
This is awesome. Where does one acquire this?
---
Idk, that assumes quite a bit. We had experiences with boosh fleets when we deployed against GotG, and we were sniping command destroyers with sentries in Ishtars unless they were double-booshing, which could pretty easily put them out of range of the citadel. Granted, they probably didn't have a full 40% of their fleet in command destroyers, but I would wager many of those fleets don't have that perfect of a composition.
---
Slurp.
---
Alt PI skills
---
It's simplified but fun. It's designed for fast turns in multiplayer on the strategic scale, but the battles on the tactical level can be set to a maximum length between one and ten minutes. So when a war's happening for another human player, you get a lot of piss breaks.
---
because that is not a jump gate. that is a star gate a very long range one, just looking at the trailer it seems to be able to reach out and touch stars others cant so possibly to no star cluster stars or other star cluster's.  
---
it may be even able to reach back to Terran systems, so its more a idea for a much more powerful and long range gate to reach some where else other then in cluster.  
---
500 plex costs $20, for 30 rorqs you need 20\*30= $600 every month. Not to mention risks and losses while rorq mining. So it looks like you're still losing isk, what did I miss?

Been there. It gets problematic after you have several dreams of EVE in a row.

Just make sure it consumes your soul and free time, but not your life or wallet. Keep enjoying the rest of your life. Try to get involved with local EVE groups. It gives you a reason to go out, if nothing else.

Would limiting booshing by mass similar to how wormholes mass out be a workable compromise? Would still keep small gangs working similarly but for a larger gang or larger ships would need more booshers in fleet.

we should buff fighter damage. and give carriers bonuses to energy neutralizer range
---
For the most part, I like that it's time gated rather than activity gated, purely because otherwise I'd never leave my PC and slowly die there from lack of sleep. Plus, as others said, the option of grinding isk to buy injectors is a sort of round-about way to the same idea.
---
What I would say is maybe keep levels 1-4 as they are now, and make level 5 a sort of "agency mission" that's unlocked when you hit level 4, and requires you to hit level 5 in the relevant activity tracker to bounce you to the next skill level. Given the low reward-to-time ratio of level 5 skills, they are rarely trained unless a pre-requisite for another skill, or the character really needs even the tiniest boost (Amarr pilots and cap skills), or the player is stuck not knowing what to train next. However, some don't seem to fit with that because there's no trackable usability. Mining 5 is fine cause just mine forty bajillionty units of ore; Turret Specialisation of choice 5 is fine cause just fire off eleventy-billion rounds with that type of turret; Cap Management 5 is...how would you rank using that? 
---
So yeah, would need a bit of micro-evaluation to work out how to make it work for a lot of less direct application skills, and if it was to be done it'd limit to only the level 5s with 1-4 staying as they are now. But not a horrific rough draft of an idea.
---
But what for?
---
ISK? Skill injectors? A supercarrier wet dream?

---
People often complain that, "there is to counter to x." To me that just sounds lazy. I think rather that people are just lazy/uncreative. If something doesn't fit into the idea that, "the biggest/most expensive fleet should win," it should be removed?
---
Some logic:
---
If it were the case that booshing were an unstoppable mechanic then every structure in the game would be destroyed. Every structure in this game belongs to an alliance with enemies capable of fielding a booshing fleet of the composition you have described. Last time I checked the keepstars in 1DQ are still there.

No its completely impossible but it would be bad compared to an optimal fit for x faction. You end up wasting modules/ stats in areas you don't need it. You would get decreased efficiency but also with a possibility to not finishing the site. Most ded 10s demand 90¬± resist profile for that faction. Hard to get in an omni resist fit.

---
That's kinda where I'm at as a new player. Ive been prioritizing combat stats that help with lvl 4 security missions and overlap for pvp. Its kinda disheartening that getting the magic 14 and other necessary skills is at a 190 skill time. That's also with +3 implants and skill mapping. The plan is that lvl 4 security missions can sustain me for awhile until I get into a decent Corp. Any excess ISK will be spent on injectors.

So plex prices are going up towards 5 millions?

In theory you could fill a buy order but not list the item at sell price. Without market access. I think...

---
The other facet to the issue is models intersecting one another.
---
&gt; the main lesson that we learned from everything is that you can only count on yourself
---
from an alliance who has for all of its existence paid others to fight their wars, and whose existence relies on the support of a 40000 man blob
---
&gt; We simply did not have enough numbers to fight all of them.
---
The XIX-DRF blob could field 4 fleets plus a full titan/super fleet and still had a lot of friends.  Pretty sure it wasn't lack of numbers but lack of will.
---
Get your hands on a machariel and go join the alpha incursion group *he says forgetting the name of it*
---
Should be easy to make the isk to plex lulz cuz thats viable right now! PLEXCONNECTTTTT...
---
As Ajax said, the cooldown is 2 minutes or so, but consider having 30 of them in a blob... you can basically push that button every 5s or less, forever.  (at least until you start losing destroyers)
---
Heroes
---
\&gt;Honestly if the ravens play it right none of those should work that's kinda the core issue. 
---
That's quite the broad statement to cover. You're talking about coordinating  properly ordered and timed boosh chain, non-stop for whatever the damage cap time is. Even under optimal conditions that's still a challenge to manage. To expect everything to go right for that long is quite the stretch. its potentially up to or beyond 360 booshes, in at least a partial order, over the course of 30 minutes.
---
\&gt; 250 in fleet, with 40% command destroyers ( your target ) that means 100, command destroyers that means you need to kill 1 every 18 seconds 
---
You only need to kill about 70-80 before they can no longer sustain a regular chain of booshing at all. You might to go a bit further, but at that point you just need to wait for them to mess up the timing or hold on too long for a cool down. Still a steep price, but you have 30 minutes to kill 2-3 a minute. Difficult, but not impossible.
---
The nagas (or whatever sniper you are using) will have a much easier time keeping up with the ravens than you might first think. The ravens have to stay at least within a 100-300km sphere around the structure. Your sniper s will only need to be within 0-50 of it for decent coverage. This means your fleet only needs to cover about 2/5 the distance as the ravens in the same amount of time. If you 'play it well' your fleet will rarely lose lock. Assuming your ceptors are on the ball, you might even be able to snag a decent chunk once in a while to be dealt with by the snipers.
---
Lastly, since this is on a structure grid, you do have access to some fairly strong paints and enough webbing to drag some key ships out of the fleet (though only temporarily). If you can manage to use any of the burst projectors successfully (although very unlikely) you can buy yourself more time.
---
\&gt; now all you done if you manage to pull of this amazing achivement is force a warp off ...
---
Thats a bit more important than you might think. Their fleet is more vulnerable when entering and exiting warp. 
---
\&gt;Like sure you might be able to pick off some ravens but you will have like 10/20 raven kills while they have the fort. 
---
Hopefully the primary target would be the booshers as much, if not more than any other ship. Thats the key element of their fleet. 
---
My point here is: there are lots of options and tactics to choose from and mess around with. But more often than not, you'll see people try the same tactics they would with any other fleet they encounter and wonder why it doesn't work. Hell, the last few major examples of Ravens in use like this that come to mind also include things like "Grossly outnumbered their enemy" and "Defenders could not do arithmetic".
---
Yes. Yes.
---
What the hell are these lokis
---
because all ur stuff is on fire lol i get it
---
Don't be shy, this man is trying to help fuel your success! Nothing wrong with getting help, hell, pay him back when you get 10x your wealth. He may refuse, or he may take it back and continue helping others. It's an undocumented mini game :)
---
I certainly have a list of those who have helped me along the way
---
Im no market expert but ive been around enough to kinda have an idea whats happening..
---
So over the last year ccps been "cooking the books" for the PA buy so to speak, in doing so they did a shit load of sales last year. Selling a shit load of plex in the process. I think the last sale we saw was x mass? Anyways so the market guys and whales bought in stock piling it.
---
But wait theres more! With how easy it is to farm isk and rocks in rorqs and caps a super tick is like 250m or something? Maybe thats hourly im not sure I dont own one lol. The point is isk is flooding the market devaluing itself in the process. Check the MER sooo much isk comes into the game from bounties its spectacular it wasnt a problem before! 
---
Both of those combined with eves been at a higher demand than ever between bots, alts, sp farmers and newbros the demand is extremely high. Mostly the latter 3 but I would bet SP farms consume a spectacular amount of plex between omega and extractors.
---
Long story short CCP has kinda primed us for these prices by either sales or lack of isk printing restrictions.
---
There is more isk in the game than ever but also more pilots.
---
PLEXCONNECTTTTT!!!!
---
We havnt seen hyper inflation yet. Some, like myself, subscribe to an old theory that plex prices have a specific inflection point where if they cross it, you will see a bottom out of the economy. But those who I talk to it about have already heard it from me to death so its probably more a meme now than anything. When/if plex crosses roughly 3 billion, things should start getting very weird in the market but for now its just "expensive". 
---
A lot of the problem with stopping botting has to do with how easy it is to just replace bots.
---
They could ban every single vni/gila bot in eve tonight, and most of them will be back out on new characters within the hour on a new proxy
---
Injectors are good btw hilmar told us so
---
judging by damage tanken it was an unpiloted carrier
---
You're framing this like it's a bad day for the guise you're trying to evict? That first battle report would make me shout for more. Looks fun as hell!
---
fuck i hate that i agree with this
---
I kinda feel you hit a wall where it's not useful to train more around 120 million, after that it makes more sense to specialize a new character on the same account
---
&gt; the main lesson that we learned from everything is that you can only count on skill yourself
---
FTFY btw
---
also, ftfy
---
Lets hope it ends up like Fire Festival!
---
As long as it isn't syndicate #Poitot
---
XIX could do the same thing like they did in Drone region.Pay ISK to let others fight for them.
---
First question is based on a faulty interpretation: supply demand ratio doesn't account for the supply in existence, but instead the supply available for sale/on the market. Thus, stockpiles don't count as 'supply' unless someone decides to dump it out. In short, both your options are correct, because people hoarding previously created stockpiles that are being drip-fed while prices are high, but people hoarding now because they're scared the market will keep climbing keeps supply too low to account for demand. I'm sure if everyone suddenly decided to sell all their Plex tonight, there would be massive oversupply and prices would crash, but that's never going to happen, and so supply remains lower than demand, with the drip-feeding from hoarders the only thing keeping the market from outright emptying.
---
Second question is again faulty: one can never "safely assume" anything when it comes to market speculation. Someone with enough of a stash deciding to dump it all would cause a dip that may result in a plateau at/below current value. Likewise, the more people deciding to get in on the action and buying Plex with RL currency to sell will increase supply, possibly stopping the upward trend it even dropping it slightly. On the other side of it, Plex pricing many people out of the market might reduce demand enough that it becomes over supplied, and the price crashes slightly. Effectively, as long as CCP don't intervene *and* no one (or at least only a minimal number of people) decide to purchase Plex to add to the supply *and* no one (or at least only a minimal number of people) gives up on Plexing their account(s) due to lack of return on investment, then it'll keep rising; the second any one of those caveats is no longer true, it'll stabilise; if more than one factor changes at the same time, a crash is possible.
---
In short, don't buy Plex or hoard it in order to wait for a new high unless you're happy to risk a crash, but likewise don't dump forty million Plex on the market and be shocked when the price dips.
---
I give it a month

Thanks, but you're Legacy.

I mean i cant be the only one to remember how SOCO went, with the russian half leaving the english speaking half to fend for themselves and get fucked in the face of the hbc, so much so that they turned on the russian half.

---
lmao
---
currently dankrupt... why are you  so mean :)
---
Well you'd need to plex 3 accounts for the same amount of extractors. And in this case you'd only get a third of the injectors for the price Eg 3 injectors for 4500 plex or 9 months of sub.

That's awesome, made me chuckle :)

Karmafleet is recruiting
---
I actually have a good fit for it. Just looking for some tips to fly it more effectively.
---
You got your soul back from PL? I thought they only gave those back on the way out.
---
Important Tips...
---
1) Don't advertise on Reddit that you have a shiny new Carrier.
---
2) Don't advertise that you have "a good fit for it" b/c that means you have good loot for someone else.
---
3) Don't advertise your name for people to run a Locator on, so they can come find you and kill you.
---
Since you've failed all 3 of these so far...
---
4) Dock up and wait a month or two before you try flying this again. Possibly taking the time to make another Alt to fly the ship instead.
---
Ask your Corp for fittings. Not in a Corp? Join one. 
---
EVE has a tendency to do that to a person.
---
You‚Äôre one of us now.
---
Make your fighrters orbit stuff. If they stamd still, they will get killed. For better understanding try searching youtube, there are a ton of tutorials up.
---
Also joke's on you for investing in a carrier before they get nerfed into oblivion.
---
I‚Äôve had carriers dropped on me 6/6 times in lowsec, 5 times by SC when they already had me outnumbered 4/5-1 and once by some other potato‚Äôs lol. Lowsec is no different to null in that regard.
---
Don't worry, ccp experts have already figured it out. The problem is the carrier ratting. Now that they will nerf them as well as the rorq mining plex will be 1 bil again, just watch! 
---
Or get half priced injectors for alts, or free plex by extracting
---
Getting my last battleship skill to 5. I have some odd gaps olin my skills. 
---
ik its not hard, still boring
---
Unpiloted carriers welps all of it's fighters to frigates. What has eve become!
---
Go join the corp "Eve University", and let them teach you. =)
---
PLEX prices are controlled by only a handful of players, who offer the big sell orders in The Forge. I suspect they also buy up a lot of the PLEX to keep the price at the level they want, thus creating scarcity and control. This allows them to drive up the price until it's at a level that people start to bark. Keep it there for a couple of months until the dust settles, then drive it up again. Repeat. It's the long game with deep pockets. 
---
I know most people just inject them but I like to relax with my skill points so I'll probably crush them up and sprinkle them on a joint.
---
Mostly I save them for an occasion where I need to train a certain skill quickly, for instance when I want to fly a new ship that I can't yet. 
---
Join Karmafleet.  Watch intel and local. And gg you will quickly feel safer in zero space then you do in highsec.

&gt;Would you be opposed as for someone active way to gain skillpoints?
---
there is.
---
grind isk, buy injectors
---
leave them with the other 10m unallocated sp that i have.
---
plex will keep rising as the demand constantly outstrips supply because of skill farms, which are practically never, ever, going to run at a loss.
---
Literally how my brawler jag looks when (if) I finally dock after an hour in geminate. 
---
&gt; When/if plex crosses roughly 3 billion, things should start getting very weird in the market but for now its just "expensive".

people said this when it hit 1bn, and it just hit 2bn.

it won't when it hits 3bn.

I don‚Äôt know about Serpentis missions, but you can certainly mine in a Kestrel.
---
I just hate how cheap it is to make a boosh raven fleet, and how expensive your fleet has to be to deal with it
---
Imo the boosh should apply a debuff that applies a stacking effect that reduces the chance a ship is able to take a boosh, and if a ship fails to take a boosh it's warp drive is put out of action for one minute
---
Like boosh once, 80% chance of being successfully booshed a 2nd time, 60% chance of being booshed a 3rd etc. Just so the fleet would have some tradeoffs to booshing, maybe they'd fit ravens with Mjd's incase they get left behind. Then they get less shield tank
---
Oh man you smoke marijuana? That's so cool! Thanks for sharing this fact with us.
---
i don't want higsec - i want ability for capital fleets to move also
---
I actually don't disagree that NPCs can be more effectively deployed to make the EVE universe a more dynamic gameplay environment.  Indeed, content like Resource Wars and NPC mining fleets have already been implemented to move in that direction.  I just don't think that FW mechanics should involve such heavy reliance on NPC battles with players as only incidental participants. 
---
There were things I liked about Elite.  As you say, it is cool to undock in Elite and see NPC ships flying around doing stuff like mining, hauling or whatever.  I think that kind of content and feel would be a great thing to implement more in Empire space, just not as something linked to FW mechanics.  Thankfully, in EVE I can undock and see players doing all the things that NPCs do in Elite. Activities you talk about joining in on with NPCs in Elite can be done by joining player corporations in EVE.  Perhaps not with the never ceasing reliability of NPCs that never have to go to sleep or work or live in a different timezone, though.
---
Anyway, I'm down to see more NPC stuff as a "baseline" in EVE for players to do things with and feel more involved in the setting.  Better to join up with an NPC mining op that offers some interaction than mining alone.  With FW, however... NPCs only interfere with players seeking PVP.  Nobody would suggest that NullSec would be improved simply by giving everyone pirate NPCs to command to attack each other on a grand scale.  EVE's biggest draw has always been emergent gameplay and conflict between players.  There are ways that NPCs can enhance that, but Elite depends too much on artificial systems interacting with each other while players isolate themselves.
---
profitable lol. hmm pay 500 mil for an account because its sp farmed or 2 bill to plex it, tough chooices to make right?
---
Destroyer with the only benefit of having dps outdpsing a frig.. reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee^(eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
---
for real. highsec is scary now
---
Flycatcher is way more fun in my opinion. 
---
Just rejoined for 30 days. Been playing on-and-off since 2009. I stopped playing just as Citadels were released. I want to do something fun and meet new people within the next 30 days. My hope is that the experience will entice me to keep playing beyond 30 days. Unfortunately, it looks like the Corporation finder and most of the UI is still outdated and cumbersome. What should I do in the next 30 days to get a good EVE experience?
---
fixed it, fix will be available for current release. You probably copied fit without header line which specifies ship type, and first real line was actual module.
---
I always keep my SP and wait for the moment when I think: "I need this NOW"
---
  Stocked up for over half a decade of sub no care given
---
Ascendance is recruiting.
---
People buying PLEX and subbing would be a good ISK sink. I think that might have been what CCP was trying to do with the sale.
---
Depends how fast it gets there tbh. At this rate it‚Äôll be a month.
---
these comps usually have a hic with a bubble up at all times and they will often boosh periodically even if there is no threat in sight. 
---
It seems you met all the right people. 
---
An isk sink REMOVES isk from the game plex is NOT an isk sink on any level.. Ok maybe taxes lol but thats it.
---
Wonderful! Now that Eve has already taken yours you don't have to worry about it being corrupted by the capsuleer lifestyle.
---
Battle cruiser with 1 high no mids no lows no rigs can fit 1 capital gun.
---
How about fleeted ships get collisions. that way you cant have that many in a 6km radius. 
---
It would be also a nice shakedown of the current ball of death type of fleets too.
---
The high plex prices are simply due to Eve players being Eve players.  It does not take a genius to realize that the massive isk faucets ccp created over the past few years (you know the list) would lead to upward pressure on plex prices.  The market pvp players saw this trend and have capitalized on it.  Even if ccp were to have a sale, we will end up back here until two things happen (which won't): a) the faucets are readjusted downwards by a considerable amount and b) the piles isk are consumed.  This would take ccp acknowledging the extent of the issue and taking actions to rectify it.  They will not take these steps as it would cause an outcry that would dwarf the bleating over higher plex prices and drive away a lot of players.  Please stop complaining about the plex prices as, apart from the occasional plex sale, they will remain high due to players optimizing the toys ccp provides.
---
I didn't mean hyper inflation, what I actually meant is artificial inflation, commonly known as market manipulation (except it's not just one  or two guys but a lot of traders with deep pockets). Post updated for clarification. 
---
Also, what do you mean by 'things should start getting weird in the market'? Normally, the economy just adjusts itself to the inflation. 
---
More like Facepalm Coalition...
---
Consider joining us in [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com). We're a newbie-friendly corp with a lot of stuff for new players like a mentors program, free frigates, etc. Our corp as a whole is also pretty chill and casual.
---
&gt;N+1 finally came to
---
Is there a different J space I dont know about because the majority of groups just n+1 armor brawl and bitch about our kitey bullshit 
---
Could field 4 fleets and a full titan fleet lmao when was this?
---
when razor got evicted DRF repeatedly brought two fleets (typically phoons + jackdaws or some other crap), XIX another two (typically machs + bombers), and at least once they did pull together a 200+ man fleet of supers, titans, faxes, etc.
---
Because if the problem is the Venture's built-in double WCS and not the ship itself, then I'd go with addressing that. Also bot punishers with a full low-slot rack of WCS.
---
The Venture could still be useful to get around gate camps, it just wouldn't be stabbed when inside a plex. Also the odd chance of an actual battle venture being fielded.
---
Go farm npc all day be as risk and pvp averse as possible. Welcome to null sec 
---
You're not thinking about balance correctly. The devs have in mind some amount of damage required to kill the structure. In their mind, this is where the structures are currently at. To introduce this repair module, they'd have to decrease the HP of structures, to where on average the rep would be required to simply equal the EHP of current structures. 
---
If you want more EHP, what you need to argue for is more EHP
---
I believe OP is just making a joke about being a stereotypical dysfunctional EVE player that's outside soaking up the rays. 
---
Well I will now
---
This is great. I wish you luck on your wars.  
---
It's exciting to see the russian player base rise again :)  
---
Totally agree.  Check Karmafleet out at www.karmafleet.org 
---
Test would probably benefit from a nerf to booshing given the propensity for our pilots in large fleets to approach the anchor at unfortunate times.
---
eh, depends the EHP and reps.  titan might just be "oh, DD"  and the dread promptly pops.  
---
This was for the distribution shit tier bots not advanced bots.
---
The recruitment channels are pretty active in-game, but more importantly what do you want to do? It's easier to find aligned interests if you know what you want.
---
It doesn't look like it! The best you can do seems to be ensure your cap skills are up to snuff to dampen the blow.
---
In the past the market frequently suffered a jolt causing a jump (usually upwards) anytime the primary plex market was killed by Test, forcing all orders to be relisted.  Since Test lowered rates. don't think there has been the same frequency of market resets - or the scale - that there had been before.
---
&gt; what did I miss? 
---
lowsex gate to stain
---
Odd seeing some russians who have been enemies of test my entire time in EvE now blue.
---
Depends on what ship class you max out on, if you want to fly all ships not including titans you are looking at like 230m sp.
---
Give me 5 of those and I'll make you a stabber.
---
This was something else though....it was supposed to be a gate to "somewhere new". Where the fuck that was is anyone's guess and I assume that whole roadmap left with CCP Seagull.
---
but... but... PLEX is power... ^^/s
---
Gooble, gobble, gooble, gobble!
---
TIL krabbing = wat.
---
Have you tried switching to Chrome? /s
---
My queues are always at least 200d long, so I will do the same thing.
---
Ive been whittling down my 2m unallocated SP here and there, but I'll keep 1m as a reserve. Probably never gonna be used that way, but hey, if you don't undock, you don't need skills anyway

collect them
---
HODL
---
I'm gonna echo marcus and recommend you browse zkill for fittings.
---
Also, check out some Eve youtubers like Bjorn Bee or Lasker Emanuel. They give really great tips, and you can watch them fight, then go find the ship fitting on their KB on zkill. :)
---
Why is he leaving
---
Not much point having dread on main, but carriers can make sense, lops a good few million off the total.
---
That's not what a sink or faucet means. 
---
An ISK sink means that isk will be taken out of the game permanent. Like station taxes in npc stations. 
---
A faucet means isk will be made out of thin air. Like bounties on rats. Or wormhole loot sold to NPC buy orders. 
---
It doesn't matter if you have to buy your ship 20 times back if it's destroyed and you have no isk left. Most of that isk spend buying new ships will just have changed hands to another player and stays in the game. 
---
Triglavian space is a faucet. There is loot that goes to NPC buy orders. And there is insurance money being given when you loose your ship. 
---
But it's a way smaller faucet then (wormhole) ratting. 
---
Milk...
---
plex has been creeping up a lot, every so often some one points at it's glacial growth and suddenly people create a bubble because some one pointed out the latest value of plex.
---
the recent bubble and perceived explosion of the plex price is a bit overhyped imo.
---
it'll hit 3bn, but i'd wager it'll take more than a month.
---
legion of death  should not be  in this coalition, rmt and botters  that's all they did their whole existence 
---
no worry xdeat boyz u have our back always
---
Join up a nullsec corp and just dive into it. Eve university, Karma Fleet, Red vs Blue are all good choices for learning Eve and especially learning combat, which is kind of a prerequisite for learning to operate in null.
---
Also, consider spending some time in w-space. It's both simultaneously the safest and most dangerous place in Eve, and if you find yourself loving it you'll never want to leave null again.
---
**Important:** You *will* encounter bad corps eventually, or even just corps who don't fit your playstyle. Just like a bad job, don't be afraid to leave them. Eve is meant to be fun, and nothing will ruin your enjoyment faster than trying to stick with people you don't mesh with.
---
they bring 200 men to fight how many do you?
---
I  wasn't playing anymore when this trailer was released, but I figured it was to be an attempt to reconnect New Eden to our galaxy, as a replacement for the old collapsed wormhole.
---
ugh, i feel dirty for actually thinking the Deep Lore of eve actually meant anything in the game
---
So the standard advice is to join a nullsec block, this includes brand newbros (part of TEST alliance), brave newbies (allied with test but have their own alliance), karmafleet (part of goons, and have a ‚Äúit‚Äôs complicated‚Äù thing with TEST), and pandemic horde, who takes all comers and is like 1/2 spies. Null blocks all provide decent fights in standing fleets and roams, logistics for moving stuff, and help with most aspects of eve.
---
There are a couple other options though, such as joining one of the smaller null or wormhole space groups that tend to be more close knit, a couple names for those I can throw out are MCAV, spleeer dreams or signal cartel (signal don‚Äôt fight, they do explo and rescue other people)
---
me_irl
---
Says Therabois who literally only can dunk on afk miners/ratters lmao
---
Maybe the "Prophecy" hasnt come to pass yet, and we just havn't seen the thing introduced; whatever it is...
---
\[laughs in german\]
---
When a non blue appears in your local just dockup.
---
That was spelled Fyre. Just sayin... lol 
---
Have you even used them? Supercaps cant even take them.
---
Better send that to Hyde and collect that prize money. 
---
I‚Äôm going to guess for Dust 514.
---
Maybe learn to pvp solo in the trigavian arenas. You got the isk but it should be fun and you can do it when you feel like it.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I actually had thought of that. From what I've read though it seems to be more decided by random chance do you win for the most part. Is the ship you see a hard counter.
---
I could be wrong, and if I am then I'll definitely start trying it out. If any Abyssal PVP players could let me know, I'd be very thankful.
---
Spend on alcohol and drugs. 
---
Killed by a VNI? 
---
Yep, you used to be able to buy and sell Dust gear on the Eve markets when Dust was a thing
---
Could be for dust but ccp could use it for planetary warfare for people to take over planets by destroying command centers 
---
Germans laugh?

---
oh man what is that poor rapier fitting?  Oh wait it's a reeepier, now it makes sense.
---
Well the CD is 160s, and a Raven fleet will have 15-20 destroyers with it, so theoretically they can boosh every 10 or 8 seconds or so, giving them a speed of over 10,000m/s
---
to make a Video with the Music of a series (the expanse) where the mankind is hugely **devided and not united** is comical if you see the Name of the "coalition"
---
Only dreads fax an carriers can use them. An after one fleet passes through its empty on fuel.
---
I've only seen it done once and it was on one jump, witch was more hassle then useful
---
Well ‚ÄúGoons!‚Äù Enough said. 
---
The Music is from the Expanse, I think?
---
Oh man he must have lagged out or som...  Oh NVM that's just pleb fit as fuck.
---
At least the thing it sits on can't point, neut, ECM, damp, target paint, web, an shoot you all at once while needing no one to gun it.
---
Why am i sure that VNI had no point or scram, and still that dumb fitted rapier died.
---
Quite hard for them without a dock or jump button
---
Thanks, I hate my own language sometimes.
---
Wh. 
---
Boosh spool time proportional to the mass of the ships being booshed?
---
I stopped reading like seven words in. You really need to work on your writing if you want to keep an audience captivated. 
---
Grrrr. Goons.
---
Och.. Im goon. 
---
The sweetest post here last 1y. 
---
&gt;I could buy a titan and whelp it into lowsec, but I'd imagine it wouldn't be something I blow up a fleet with, more as get blobbed in 10 min after 5 alliances have pinged for a free titan kill.
---
Yeah, they would just cyno in 100 dreads. You would likely live longer in a frigate.
---
Comms bring life to eve vids. Why did he die so fast no panic fitted?
---
Try to play by plexing accounts you will win eve pretty fasy
---
The greed.
---
Have done so since 2015. Onle spent real money on EVE once and that was back in 2014 when I started. Steam had a sale for EVE gametime. Think it was 64.something ‚Ç¨.
---
Got plenty of PLEX saved up. So thats not a problem. Just subbed two accounts for 6 months actually thanks to the recent sale.
---
it's dumb and wrong, plenty of reason to fight it
---
What an incredibly dishonest statement. I can totally see why he wanted to hide from reddit.
---
Start a charity where you give all your isk to gets like me. 
---
faction warfare
---
What activities are you doing were you can justify plexing these days
---
The plex price was always rising and it will continue to rise. Though it will eventually slow down/stagnate once it hit the point that skill farms and ratting/mining alts become not worth the effort anymore, as they inflate the demand quite drastically.
---
Hes completely full of shit. For 10 years (at least) they claimed SP dont matter. The only reason you can inject capital skills is because they wanted the "market" of older players to also use injectors.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75942562/
---
&gt;Yes. This was the original purpose of injectors to alleviate that.
---
It wasnt. And they knew it. They just wanted to monetize eve. Thats it.
---
Why do you say "willing" when game time basically isnt optional?
---
Just wait till neutral logi is nerfed :D Gonna be amazing. 
---
Injectors, rorqs, supers, bots.
---
Don't tell me it's an AFK Ratter
---
Pls
---
Making way more in 1 month in industry than it costs to plex my two accounts.
---
Having plenty of plex saved up also helps.
---
CCP indirectly control plex prices.
---
I still miss Seagull. The direction the game had under her was simply great.
---
Mynxee has helped me out a few times. Props
---
&gt;given how far they're willing to push the price up via the influence they do have, to try to incentivize purchases.
---
A higher plex price means people buy less.
---
Just give it's sig 100% bigger.
---
Not a big buff!
---
Farms. Bots, rorqs, supers. Thats basically it.
---
Trig stuff to prepare for the vedHAC.
---
Throw your money around and start a war. Back an army and try to take some space for yourself. Youve done plenty of solo stuff. Start an empire.
---
Why would people be buying more plex when they get more isk than ever?
---
Yeah, its so good for the game that people quit.
---
I could do that. However no interest for that really. No one has really wronged me and I don't have interest to take sov. More as due to administrative reasons more than anything else.
---
Or start in the deep end, wormhole space. It will make a man of you double quick time. Shadow Flight are really good for keen newbeans wanting to jump in with both feet.
---
Dude this is eve 2019, MER comes first.
---
I hear there is this thing called the "CSM" that CCP uses to keep themselves informed about the state of the game. I dont think we need to worry about anything!
---
&gt;We were just getting back to something **close to normalcy** after last weeks stupidity
---
Mate...
---
Im not going to say i wouldnt mind a super myself. (Would thou )But if i was in your shoes, i would heavily bling a few ventures and go PvP in diffrent areas of space never visiting the same area in like 2-3 weeks every once in awhile. Hell even take suggestions for what ship to roam every once and awhile if you feel like it. 
---
I've come to love EVE as not only is it a great game but because it certainly appeals to different styles of life and play style.
---
But in your case, i would avoid acts like "welping a titan cuz why not." As i feel like this will make eve uninteresting in the long term. Take a break, maybe a neat idea will come to you or maybe getting good fights in shiny fits is just the thing for you.
---
dude weed lmao
---
&gt;I see no problem with high plex prices.
---
You are almost uniquely ignorant. Congratulations!
---
wtf are you talking about? I just want an area that favors solo play. An area where you cant bring 10 of you friends and logi support to fight a solo cruiser. 1v1 would be boring because then people would just fly worms, gila and rattlesnake with shiny fits, but when you have like 10 people you have a lot more variables, i.e. players could temporarily team up and wreck the dude with in the shiny gila, but in the end they would still have to kill each other because only the last man standing gets the reward.
---
buy high sell low
---
Both is good, if you're running Jackdaws as a fleet comp, Flycatcher is easier to train. 
---
Dusty old Golem squad, unite
---
Start a PvP corp. Form blindy fleet, kill important / impressive targets, make wars, spoil your isk to give people content.

I'm in btw

Yep this exactly.

I always try to keep at least 100k sp unallocated on all my characters. It means I can pretty much inject any skill I might need to level 4. A lot better than wanting to do something then having to (not anymore) go by the book and slow train it.
---
Try 425 as that's all you need for 30 days time atm.
---
This could be a good thing to prevent RMT tbh, lets say plex prices reach the prices people sell on the black market, people those who RMT are more likely to buy straight from CCP rather than risking negative wallet/ban through the black market..
---
Just a thought, I wouldn‚Äôt be against that as I buy omega with real money and I buy plex to fund my pvp so the higher the price of plex is the better it is for me and people alike.
---
omega now 425 plex's, you fool.
---
Must be a Sentient Carrier spawn.
---
Death to all supers (even friendly ones)!
---
Skill farms don't operate month-to-month (unless owner is retarded), you generally have some leeway in when you buy and when you sell and the more leeway the more potential for profit there is as you can repond to price fluctuations rather than impulse sell asap, now farm owners have 250k cushion to amortize over and wait out injectors to follow plex price
---
IMO this will mostly "hit" people with 1-2 accounts most often newbies who pay for eve with plex as they generally go month to month and get slapped with every plex increase
---
pm sent
---
I can finally complete the magic 14.
---
Totally get that. The game of thrones is appealing to everyone so to speak.
---
Another fun one is stealing from people. Camp in a cloaky hauler with as fast of a fit you can get it and steal from suicide gankers, supers killing jump freighters, titan ratters in a C6 wormhole, and so on.
---
I wouldn't be against that honestly, experiences have soured my trust that something like that wouldn't massively backfire though.
---
Seen many spectre fleets where FC gives out blingy ships, yet does not get many that survived back. I'm just thinking I spend 5-10B In a really cool blingy doctrine and half of them quit corp right after that.
---
Dear PIRAT, 0.0 lesson #1, cyno is different than a salvager.
---
Logging in to extract on accounts where the characters are "done", and if I'm feeling particularly ambitious, running some long reactions.
---
bonus points with an MTU out.
---
AAR is about as good as AUTZ.
---
is there a reason the people sieging cant just chain scram?
---
That. Now that is something I'd want to do. I have nicked stuff from suicide gankers on few occasion as I've passed by in my DST.
---
What I'd really want to do is basically steal an alliance. Do one of those historic things with headlines "One man's theft brings down tens of thousands of players" etc.
---
The only downside is that, I like people, much as I want to be that asshole, after knowing them for a while, unless they really are assholes, I just couldn't pull the trigger on the heist. :)
---
Supers and titans can go into wormholes
---
So, Dust? 
---
pirat discovers that enemies can shoot back in null.

---
Solo frig pvp
---
only way to win eve its to quit
---
Painfully true
---
Turns out you were correct!
---
?
---
only play it from reddit :P
---
Dont know if AFK, but it was certainly ratting fit. No point or scram.
---
I'm game
---
Nullsec is scary.
---
Thats assuming you bother to maximise profit.  Just churning out shit still provides ok Isk/hour for the slight bit of hauling you have to do.
---
Nothing is wrong with you, you poked someone and as the rule goes, "if it moves, shoot it".
---
Point out on the doll where CCP Guard touched you.
---
Notice everyone points to the the dolls Heart!
---
someone with far better video editing skills than I should link all those triangular rotating schematics together.
---
Rather than a titan I'd go full bling on some Marauders. Will live longer than a titan with MJD and blingy tank mods 
---
But if they are going to play, do they have a choice?
---
The jumpgates aren't full blown stargates which is what was originally intend. They were replacements for POS jump bridges. CCP made the replacement and said look "player owned stargates, we finished Seagull's vision"
---
Looks like he forgot to switch accounts a few times.
---
Just fell off the wagon, and had a dumb question. Is it possible to see what's in your Asset Safety Containers, or do I have to keep flying around the cluster to find out what I actually have?
---
But think of the skins you can buy with the leftover 75 plex lol.
---
He had a Gallente Phenomena generator, but I guess it generated the wrong kind of phenomena because that's a lot of erebuses on the field
---
After we saw nid prices in 1dq we are planning on a suicide roam, so i'p using it for minmatar carrier IV
---
You're not forced to be omega
---
You're not forced to grind ingame for gamtime when 1 hour of rl work lets you sub
---
Yes you have a choice
---
I honestly can barely see what's going on.
---
Wow that guy dies a lot, what a noob.
---
Re-posting my reply the last time I saw a thread like this because very few people actually know WTF was going on here...
---
This trailer actually meant so much to me, and probably to a few other former devs as well. Five years ago, when I first saw this, I honestly believed that we would all eventually see some of the work that was done for Dominion and it's follow up expansions (which never saw daylight). Four years later and we're still nowhere near true 'stargates' and the mothership / construction platforms for them.
---
I ASSURE YOU that the new jump gates are nothing at all like what's represented to being constructed in this trailer. The entire tone and seriousness of the trailer isn't about building something to take you to another place you've already been or link to another similar gate. No... the alliance in this trailer is about to do something that TERRIFIES the Empires; they are about to open a gate to an entirely new area of space, and there are serious risks involved.
---
Abyssal deadspace is very cool, but looks very much like nearly ten year old ideas for wormhole / deep space exploration iterations. Oh and, btw, had Space Farmville "Tyranis" not happened (had to have that DUST link), it's likely we would have had alliance bookmarks, 'coalition' level standings and many other things back in 2010 / 2011.
---
Yeah, this trailer filled me with so much hope. I'm still waiting. :(
---
i member when it was sub 400 million isk :(
---
Sadly, whatever it is today, it wasn't a guffin back then.  That was an actual player built STARGATE, opening a path to an entirely new region / dimension of space.  There is a matching gate on the other side, having been built by a Mothership / Construction platform that did a one way jump into the unknown so it could anchor the other end of the gravity anomaly.
---
Seagull had a vision based on years of old / epic plans.
---
It was a true stargate; new regions / resources / dimensions.  No one wants to open a gate to Terra - we'd be ants to them.
---
It was a bait VNI, to be fair.
---
It did at one time... when we had writers and a real community team.
---
P I R A T has no PVP skill but they think they're elite because they sit on jita undock chewing through noobs. P I R A T are no match for PH.
---
GOOD JOB YES YES GOOD JOB JOOOD GOB! OJJJD! DOG! YES YES !
---
But they want Omega, beacuse they want to play the game. Based on that, why do you think plex is as optional as any other item?
---
hmmm yeah, the titan would probably call a defense fleet of other super capitals and capital ships to defend the titan which would probably lead to the triglavian DD being popped
---
hah!
---
I wonder how much they will cost vs. a standard dread.  Just because they might do 25k dps, if they die easily and cost 10b - people are just going to use titans often.

I just bought a month of Omega (love how it didn't automatically give me the 15% off, you have to actually know to click the offer to get it, so it screws new players right off the bat, lovely) - so, onto the question: what is there for a solo-miner to do beyond getting blown up every time I enter 0.4 to mine something other than the basic ores? 
---
I mean - really? Some people have nothing better to do than sit in asteroid belts and pick off new characters. What's the point?
---
I'm not confident enough in my Caracal build to try the calm filament I bought, I can sometimes fly around and do data/relic sites and what not - or go into wormholes to try and find some rare ores - or just trade items between systems/run agent missions of course.
---
Other than those things or "join a corp" - what exactly is there to do? I basically just float around citadel doing low level stuff and die if I ever try to leave, it's honestly kind of frustrating. I dunno, I feel like I wasted my money kind of.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

How about a faction mission giver where you have to interact with another player to complete the mission.
---
Btw this post was censored, like previous post about Sotiyo in NC space ;)  
---
hmm, i don't think a triglavian dreadnought would be *that* reliable in battle, i think people just might have it for lols or something like that
---
Looking at dust on YouTube it looked like a bad rip off from planetside 2 imo..
---
Every asset in Dust had to be represented on TQ in some way. There is a video of a QA with Rattitis out there somewhere where he explains how much of a a PITA this was.
---
I would strongly suggest getting into a newbie friendly alliance like horde. You will make slot more. Running lvl4s by yourself is soulcrushing.
---
2 a minute would mean you would take 160 minutes to kill 80 you only have 30.

Jesus fuck Jeracho. How do you choke that up?

I found a great pvp refit for my loki yesterday while checking the zkill activity in my new prospective wormhole region. Zkillboard has diverse search and filter functions.

---
I said close. We were heading back down towards 3.5. 
---
Your missing the point, the objective can be killed while the defenders are there. This has literally been done under a hostile super fleet because the attacking fleet is unengageable
---
a this point and trend what is u're opinion on plex prices in the next days? Thanks you...actually we are at 4,5 m
---
Welcome to the jungle...
---
Because the hostile fleet is literally blinking around the grid and you have to catch them in the first place?
---
Note: if you browse zkill for fittings do so with a focus. Look for a pilot who is successful in a certain ship (lots of kills with a hull). Then go to that pilot's page, go to "losses" and see if they ever lost that hull. Odds are good it will be the same fit they're getting lots of kills with.
---
All that said you won't know exactly how to fly it. So, in addition you can get out there and die to some people. See how they flew their ship, then check zkill for the fitting.
---
Gluck 
---
I see that point and I realize that is a problem.  What I was saying in my previous comment was disagreeing with u/pvprazor.  If there are defenders on field the objective should be more difficult to kill, however that doesn't make "anything valuable" impossible to kill.  Objectives could still die, but the defenders would need to be driven off first.  Please review the chain of comments leading here, I think there has been a misunderstanding.
---
We t14 now
---
it's really funny to watch people constantly die to ivana, to freeports and to their camping/hunting in the chokepoints and everything, knowing that it's ironically way safer to just move through null on the east side of the map than it is to move through metro/molden/derelik
---
As someone who never travels with capitals It was somewhat interesting.
---
It was 4.5 yesterday and not much left in Jita. Maybe it has changed.
---
Yes, its always been there in IVs as a tribute to space odysee.
---
why do they need to catch them instead of just sieging the target 
---
Breaking news  nc. jumps titans against ,how the fuck cares , and remember dock all faction titans 
---
Not just PH. Anybody beyond Jita undock.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt see how this gene can be put back in the bottle without pissing off a ton of people.‚Äú

---
they are pirates so it makes sense that newbeans would rat them
---
Beep boop
---
I found any kind of grind absolutely kills my motivation to play.  It's OK for a few weeks but after that, no, I'll find other things to do more rewarding than that.
---
3 weekends... I mean that's most of your free time if you work!

I heard those ivanka guys retired last year, area is safe to move through now
---
How many people have 30 Rorquals out?
---
You're talking 1% of the 1% of the 1%.

But horde killed a PIRAT ship another time!
---
Indeed I did :).
---
Well he found his true calling, whelping titans nonstop
---
o/ Happy cake day. I just felt like a couple of this fellas really needed a shoutout after they spent years helping keep Eve great.
---
damn it.. have your upvote and go
---
God I love this so much.
---
Please make all of Pirat rage quit.  Fucking scumbags.
---
&gt; it was supposed to be a gate to "somewhere new".
---
so say it leads to stain 
---
EVE is not safe
---
Gotta love the dual sensors boosters and salvager. 
---
Ahahaha I was so amaze when I start the game and found that, I trough it was like a special thing, something rare, I took multiple screen of it, but well, I realize it was just a pretty cool site design and nothing important :p
---
Just set it all aside and take care of RL. No need to make a ritual of it. If it's meant to be, you'll be back, and welcome.
---
My "win condition" is to own (and get a kill in) every ship in the game, other than super rare stuff. I've made my way through frigs, dessies, cruisers and BCs.
---
 Taking a bit of a hiatus rn, as I am a bit burned out on getting the isk for a full set of battleships. They're not that expensive individually and I already got the T1/Navy/Pirate ones, but when I add up the T2 stuff, it becomes quite the expense. Still not sure that I can afford a Marshal at all. Oh well. We soldier on...
---
Finishing Minmatar Cruiser V so I can fly a Loki. 
---
Just sell them, and then SRP any losses, and offer to buy them back after the fleet 
---
Please quit alliance 
---
&gt;they bring 200 men to fight
---
&gt;to fight
---
Nope
---
That's the same sentiment that a lot of my customers have when they don't understand why I give a 40 hour estimate for something like adding a button to a screen. 
---
Damn you're pretty salty for a guy who just joined. Some people enjoy shooting spaceships in a spaceship shooting game and aren't picky about their targets. Did you obtain permission to mine in that 0.4 system or did you just feel entitled? You're gonna be a sad panda if you expect to foist your real life ethics onto other EVE players. Check that baggage at the door. 
---
I see wut you did there matey

Looking mainly for mining fittings, so does not apply.

*You seem to be needing a mentor of the ''troll/pirate'' mentality.* 
---
*So much is there for you to grasp and play with if only you would let go of your ''morals'' and become immortal.*
---
That being said you have become trapped by the fallacy that you need to be of a certain ''level'' before you participate. Its ok, we all did at the time, learn to think lateral, eve is a mindset. Try and push yourself and find your limits and what you are good at. You also lack a goal or an archenemy :P.
---
You are doing yourself a great disservice by not joining a good corp, as you will never achieve those high-level game feels since you lack experience in game to create them yourself.
---
TL:DR: you will think all of the above is bullshit until you get older. 
---
How much does it last? I'm almost thereeee
---
Hmm, I thought that coalition's name was "RU-co" (where "RU" doesn't necessary stand for "RUSSIAN")
---
It's possible. Asset safety wraps and their contents show up on API so you can view them with jEveAssets. I think there's an in-game way too that perhaps someone else is familiar with.
---
Wait you're telling me people don't set up fortizar freeports for traveling capitals out of the goodness of their hearts?
---
^one ^of ^us
---
this is not a boast , but i learned , the less shits you give the less likely youre to get cought . at first when i got my titan i was super nervous , multiboxed like madboi and checked everyone in local etc etc . these days i just light cyno and go. never even got close to getting cought idk. maybe im lucky
---
so simple, so good
---
If you are already at Level 4 missions you cna join a decent corp. 
---
Get into Brave Newbies, Horde etc and focus back on Cruiser skills for PvP and Ratting, as the Battleship skills for Level 4 missions are pretty much only useful for Level 4 missions.

You DD‚Äôd the wrong target, you plank! *hahaaa*
---
Chain booshing is not a problem.
---
The problem is the way lock radius, huge citadel hitboxes and 100km jumps interact. And actually, the problem is usually that the defender is n+1'd - you put a 180 character fleet into a wormhole fight and you're going to win pretty much any fight, whatever the mechanics.
---
Chain booshing is one of the few things that can be used to mitigate n+1 blobbing with skill, or to hurt the rorqual fields.
---
One reasonable change to booshing (and MJDing?) might be for it to break locks. Warping 150km breaks your locks (and locks on you) so why does insta-warping not? That would limit its use for memeing structures a bit.
---
Do doo-doo do.
---
snip, snip, snip, snip!
---
Because that bomber pilot gets killed and podded out, and that means you lose a pilot every time you want to try to pull a ship out of the herd.
---
burn back to station and dock up 
---
[race that isnt recommended or useful to the alliance] Titan V on my main

obviously :D

at that point you can just extract [random race] BS V and retrain it

What about when a German mechanical engineer looks at something made by China to a cost point?
---
Frig battle Royale in a massive system ? üòÇ
---
So are plex going to cost 5 m anytime soon?
---
Why? I have not paid u yet! 
---
Oof
---
Not sure, but you'll notice the sale on PLEX is that it's less Plex for Omega (425 instead of 500) and not a reduction of IRL money for Plex (like a 15% off sale). 
---
Further reducing the supply. Also the market bumped the price so for 425 Plex it essentially cost the same as 500 Plex. 
---
I feel like the price will not likely drop after it goes back to 500 Plex for a sub.
---
Tinfoil intensifies.
---
Actually you do. It‚Äôs obvious from your responses to the other advice you‚Äôre getting here that you have some kind of social disability. Eve isn‚Äôt a good game for people like you. Just stick to single player games. 
---
You‚Äôre the only one that suggested joining a Corp instead of actually giving advice to the topic. I see who has the social disability. üòÇ
---
nice editing, good video, good feed
---
8/10 always glad to see people having fun

NEXT!
---
people said the same shit when it went over 1bn.
---
yet you're all still plexing your shitty alts and whining about it.
---
Sure it does. Look for mining ship losses, and you will see good fits.
---
Underrated logic.
---
&gt; With how easy it is to farm isk and rocks in rorqs and caps a super tick is like 250m or something? Maybe thats hourly im not sure I dont own one lol.

I actually have three containers called "Return to EVE" at jita which have collections of T1 &amp; T2 ship hulls worth few hundred bil exactly for that purpose. Whenever I go on a breal and if I return to an EVE where ISK is worthless, at least I still have these ships I can fly.
---
Naturally one can for t1/faction/t2 ammo and another for mods/drones as well.
---
Its what most of the Russian community was largely known for years only over taken by the Chinese in resent years 
---
Already happening. From the next release [Yulai IX](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Yulai/IX) will be named **Yulai IX (Kjarval)**.  
---
Falcon has [announced](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/400419490?t=06h31m36s) it at EVEsterdam.  
---
It's an ice planet, but not a dwarf by any means (Earth's eq. rad.: 6378 km, this one: 11610 km).
---
So how exactly will this work then when it comes to standings I wonder. If they've reunited 'all' the (major I guess) Russian entities, but they still hang on to their current alliances / coalitions.. eeh. Does that mean that as a member of TEST you'll be blue to SB-SQ or something? And at the same time the Russians you guys have, unless I'm wrong here, will be blue to Deadco.? Sounds like a clusterfuck to me.
---
he SD'd

I bet Guristas are doing a better job at it.

Thank you, I have regained my sanity already \^\_\_\_\^

pls stop

Bonne change bro o7

lmao wtf is that
---
Save them for the next triglavian release....
---
The last economist CCP had said that the economy could reasonably sustain players at between 1-3 billion back when plex was at roughly 700. Granted this was going on the large average number of players individual isk holdings being a certain amount. Supposedly that has not changed much. 
---
Merci l'ami o7
---
I see that you used some of the corp BPOs to build the best ship Eve has to offer.  It's always good to see a Scout - what a cool organization.
---
Agreed, not serious if not wanting to join an active Corp. say your looking for all these guys but reply looking for mining fit... highest miner.....
---
Consider suicide.
---
If you're genuinely looking for help with just highsec npc corp mining(per several of your comments)... Well, I'm not sure how many ways you can fit mining lasers and MLUs.
---
Hey there, is there a way currently to track rorqual losses? I have a capital feed up currently, but i was looking to filter it to just rorquals if that is possible. 
---
Would you be able to have it as a separate entity similar to the excavator losses feed?
---
Honestly, just have them in the same corp as you. Then you know the people your kids are hanging with. Almost every corp I've been in have been kid friendly environments, none advertized themselves as such. 
---
Fair enough on the advice, still - I don't understand the immoral players and I have no desire to interact with them, there's enough of that garbage in the real world!
---
Guess I'll just join a corp and bounty hunt or something, thanks.
---
Chain Booshing is indeed quite devastating. Have had the pleasures during the Pamfam invasion of Provi to deal with them. 
---
Only on /r/eve would such a simple joke require this muh explanation lol
---
Touch it. 
---
&gt; No Question is Stupid Thread
---
&gt;Damn you're pretty salty for a guy who just joined. Some people enjoy shooting spaceships in a spaceship shooting game and aren't picky about their targets. Did you obtain permission to mine in that 0.4 system or did you just feel entitled? You're gonna be a sad panda if you expect to foist your real life ethics onto other EVE players. Check that baggage at the gate. 
---
Not trying to foist ethics on the players, I was just expecting there to be more players WITH ethics, hunting down people 1.5 billion bounties so that new players could actually explore the game without being crushed until they quit. Seems like a poor structure for introduction into the game.
---
That was before injectors, which basically let anyone play for free, as long as they don't mind sacrificing the ability to train new things. 
---
alcoholic satan? playing eve instead of POE? unheard of.
---
We got giant space lasers, right? Carve his name into a planet!
---
Itl go up.
---
Since the design probably was made by the German mechanical engineer in the first place: Sadness.
---
Gotta admit the unusual presence of balls here.
---
Imagine the courage it took him to jump through a few lowsec and a few nullsec systems.
---
The horror! The bravery!
---
The retard fit is not surprising, of course.
---
&gt;BPCs, deadspace items and skins
---
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA
---
&gt;30%-50% of their estimated value
---
rofl
---
----------------
---
don't get me wrong, we do need something to remove isk from circulation to slow down the inflation.  but this is idiotic.   this will devalue players actually grinding to get modules and selling them.  
---
so no.  theres other ways to sink isk.  but this....just hurts the EVE Free market that has given EVE such lovely economic studies in universities.  
---
if you can't afford a subscription, maybe spending your time getting a job would be better?
---
They got the dysfunctional part right...
---
Well, there was a  
---
FUUUUUU  
---
REEEEEEE  
---
coalition at some point (still waiting for cat ears)
---
This was the last post I‚Äôve made. I‚Äôve made several comments since then. I asked a simple question of where to find ship fittings and you tried to change it to joining a Corp.
---
Your ethics are self-serving and extraneous. Be grateful: you received a cheap education that lowsec is dangerous, so next time you go ninja mining there you will know to warp off when something scary shows up. Ventures are very good at that.
---
Thats why I said it should be only a tickle and not a flood of items. Also since they cant be bought out directly but only bid on the players will adjust what they want to pay fot it at the end. 30-50% are starting bids not the end price. 
---
I lol'd at...all of this
---
I am afraid with your attitude you will choose a poor corp.
---
**Actually nvm i am sure you will.** 
---
Good luck
---
and it will still hurt the players who grind for it. aka who set the price.
---
so no.  for example if i wanted, i could buy out Jita of all Type A Energized Adaptives.    it wouldnt be the first time i tried to do such a thing and caused the price to spike a good 400m for a few days.  
---
but with your "idea", they just sit in a station and wait for one to be put up for auction.
---
so my sabotage of the market in the name of profit. now becomes less effective.  and depending on the quantity and how often they show up, can actually force my market price down.  just because they coem from the ether.
---
got nauseous, i'll try again later
---
Those signal cartel dudes are fun guys :D
---
It's fucking beautiful.
---
FTY bounties mean nothing. I
---
ts just a way to milk even more isk from your salty victims as they place a bounty on you... uu so scary. 
---
You hunting bounty means NOTHING to the one who wears it proudly.
---
I guess no one told you that....
---
That's hilarious, thanks for the laugh (I'm like 15% German).
---
&gt;Also what about just giving out old skins through that
---
old usually = rare.
---
rare = valuable
---
take for example the blood raider AT tourny skin. BLODO EXPENSIVE.   going at around 5b?
---
so owning it, feels a bit more special. as theres a limited number (aka NOT an artificial increase over time),  and thus the value of them remains.
---
if new ones are put in the game, the price of the existing ones drops.  
---
and the perceived value of them drops 
---
So yeah you mean it wil make a real dent in your pocket because then their will be couple A-Type energized adaptives which run for 2-3 days then were people have to bid on it. 
---
As I see it you look at the extremes like there will be dozens or hundreds of those items more on market then. i talking about a few not enough to affect the normal markets and also harder to get to since you have to travel into nullsec or lowsec for them. 
---

---
Keep them in case i need to get a random or new skill fast
---
No mention of TEST? Cap nerfs? Carebears? Hi sec worshippers? Can I bring my drake?
---
it doesn't matter if its a few or many.
---
what matters is its artificially shoving them into game.
---
what happens if the group controlling gurista space locks it down, puts in ALOT of work to make sure NO faction or deadspace modules from it leave.
---
the price on those will creep up due to the lack of supply, despite steady demand.
---
but w8. your black market means people just need to wait for the black market.  cause fk actually WORKING to control the supply of them.  now you can bid and buy from a npc.  
---
might as well print "gifted by CCP" on them, and go back to the controversy of 2006 to 2010.  
---
you want the module, buy it for the player price, or hunt for it yourself.   
---
because your black market idea will either
---
a. sell to rarely to actually matter as an isk sink. and so be a waste of time for CCP
---
or B. sell enough to be an isk skin, and in doing so destroy the player supply/demand market, and start artificially limiting prices.
---
aka WOW market of general store sold items.  vs the dynamic EVE free market.
---
You are a spy,  embrace this now and play around it 
---
nothing intresting there
---
still waiting for collision damage and the sheer chaos that would follow xD
---
I personally couldnt care less about that but ok. Lets say there will still be very special skins like this AT skin that wont ever came back while other skins like the Police skins or the ambulance skins will find their way in limited numbers through such a market.   
---
In my opinion it is an extremely bad idea to bank money on value of skins at all since they do nothing else then give your ship a somewhat nice look.  
---
I personally would exclude tournament skins and also the special skins for the CCP employes since those are in my opinion reyll very special skins, while other skins like those mentioned before only have their value because they were valued high on the plex prices they cost.
---
No mention of the Stain gate........gets a downvote from me.......
---
you really don't understand a supply/demand market.
---
or a finite resource market.
---
seriously.  might want to switch to Star Trek Online.  might fit you better.
---
That only goes on for so long but I see the sentiment. The inflection has never been met so it‚Äôs only logical to test to see if he was right. The average player is still worth less than plex so who knows. 
---
alt ganker skills.

---
I remember when it was 5b isk... sry, wrong server
---
lol im glad. i think thats the first pirat killmail ive ever seen outside of hisec xD
---
keep it up guys. 
---
There is a timeline in the vid's desc, you can skip the shaky part.
---
CCP made enough bad choices with their spinoffs that I don't want these to have any major influence on the game at all. Just imagine one of the games interacting shuts down and all of a sudden important gameplay elements of the main game were outsourced to them.
---
Then what is that "warp scramble II" thingy there?
---
What is that ‚Äúgallente phenomena generator‚Äù in the hoghslot????
---
Fit up some frigates, go pick any fight you can find in low/null and then ask them for tips after they killed you on how you could be better.
---
Eventually someone will ask you to join their corp, try them out and see if they're a good fit for you.
---
If not, repeat process.
---
I totally understand that you are just stubborn without showing anything of your own afraid of losing money

1.6 average was like in 2015 AMA? if you have recent plz link i would like to read all of it.

it's great if it's real. because back is the days people looking for a tackle for a fleet or a logi. now they just take their stiletto alt and exec alt.  i live in low and see hordes of bots and multiboxers run missions\\plexes or just mine on daily basis. it was nothing like that in 2015, for example.

Make sure to post the rorquals that died right before as well, don't want to forget them:

The market for faction/deadspace items is already flooded.
---
Rorquals...really?
---
LMAO how do you able to get a br that rigged, at least include Progodlend's loss 
---
old titans used to passively give fleet buffs, like +hp, +recharge rate, whatever. because passive links got removed they converted those passive benefits to an active high slot item, which have benefits/drawbacks and effect everybody in range rather than just your fleet.
---
basically, erebus gives +armor ehp, levi gives +shield ehp, and nobody cares about the other phenoms

Fight was initiated with the systematic hunting and slaughter of 2 legacy rorquals

---
no, i'm just against ruining the silutated free market that made EVE so appealing to me.
---
i can count the number of games that have a free market simulation to the level of eve on one hand.
---
and none of the others to the extent of EVE, which has been studied and credited as having hte most accurate market of a real life market.
---
and you want to hurt that by adding in artificial supplies, that can't be controlled by players.
---
i hear they reopened club penguin.
---
They were the reason we were here so why wouldn't they be included?
---
Its about 8-9b-29b but zkillboard is shitting itself atm
---
That's because pirat only recruits the same spineless bads that were killed by them in the first place.
---
"I'm so upset I got ganked, only way I can make myself feel better is to join them and make other people feel shitty too."

My corporation has a fourteen year old. Despite him being a little bit derpy, because there's also a small language barrier, he's actually a good guy and really, really well mannered. I already have experiences with minors in corporations, they can be quite difficult to handle but it can work, if the environment is also able to adjust. However, most corps don't like taking in minors as they are often perceived as a liability.
---
Best bet would be to keep your child close to you.
---
LOL test dumb asses nice blob
---
zealots!
---
Nope, this stuff is old and was meant for Dust.
---
Damn TEST ruining everything. They're worse than millennials. 
---
Hahha so you first turn down the amount of hours to search between to cut down losses and then you add a system 3 jumps away? Okey bud
---
Friday, Saturday, Sunday
---
If you missed out Friday, yepp bad luck!
---
Call them what they really are, Frat Legion.
---
Sounds like you're just mad that a super pilot found a creative solution to get out of his predicament.
---
Subcaps have agression timers, fighters dont because they aren't ships able to be piloted. They're much more like drones - which, get this - also dont have aggression timers
---
Random chance for someone to get fuckover is a really bad mechanic, the two changes I proposed will allow allow more counters to exist.
---
I'm sorry Dave, I can't let you do that. HAL
---
I don't work so it's okay lol

 [https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/Cvjk3gjz3euFsDqDR](https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/Cvjk3gjz3euFsDqDR)   
---
its more realistic BR
---
I don't find that to be creative at all. It is not the first time this has happened to us and there is simply no counter to it. Even with jammers you don't have the locking speed fast enough to jamm the fighters. So you simply watch how your inhib goes down and there is nothing you can do. 
---
You're right. These things are important to elite mining vessel hunting alliances.
---
Line of sight though.. imagine hiding behind a CONCORD patroller when you're being shot at by a war target. Oops
---
huh, so he had enough alpha to break through the shields each salvo, and do a little armor dmg.
---
scoop for reload/cooldown.  and repeat.
---
that....is surprisingly well thought out.   even if you can kill a fighter each launch, he just has to reload the tube, and repeat. each time knocking a little more amror....
---
In game fleet formations. Fleet/wing/squad commander can access and change their layouts. 
---
Implementation would be no different than creating a hidden object deployed in a grid of sorts, allowing the approach command to keep you in fleet, as you are following said hidden object. 
---

---
sure i would if anything is to see in this trash video
---
No. You simply don;t have time to lock them. He launches them, one salvo the inhib and scoopes them back in before you can lock any fighter
---
so hes not even loseing fighters.
---
Comment of the thread, lmao
---
When the time comes, you will stop playing EVE naturally. You will be lurking around r/eve - like I do, laughing at those stupid people who still keep playing this obsolete and horribly unbalanced game - like I do, trying to do your best to forget EVE exists - like I do. And then one day you'd log into the game and run a fleet with Bombers Bar or Spectre or Zarvox etc. Like I did.
---
Damn this terrible, terrible game.
---
...are you anchoring your inhib like right next to him or something? You do realize they have a 100km range and you dont really have to worry about a super slowboating his way out anytime soon, right? Especially not if you keep bumping and webbing? Try anchoring like 80-90km from him, increase fighter flight distance to buy more time.
---
If you're running into this problem routinely, maybe try bringing a ship that solves this problem? Something with a faster lock time to lock and tackle those fighters faster? 
---
Or do the obvious workaround and bring more inhibs and keep anchoring them
---
prob should never do it
---
I love how NC. are on a roll blaping blue caps all week ....
---
think how high that inflection is though.
---
with 5m SP you can have a substantial amount of reaction, science and industry slots. the point at which it becomes difficult to fund omega through plex will be an insanely high isk value. way beyond 3bn isk.
---
So dont be dumb and anchor it at a distance where fighters have to travel. Enabling you to shoot them. Eve is hard.....
---
Inhib was 70+km from him
---
You could conceivably anchor the inhib at range so the fighters can't get there instantly, not that it would matter as you could never kill enough fighters to stop him from chipping structure away before scooping them due to fighter speed and effective damage cap.
---
Inhib was 70 km from him. we were sitting between him and inhib so we can rep it. Im not dumb.
---
Didn‚Äôt tell
---
Wouldn't that be Russian made not Germany. Or was that just tanks.
---
Use more burst jammers
---
Also complaining on the official eve online PVP forums about something they use isn't going to get you very far
---
That was after the sale was announced. That‚Äôs the problem. 
---
Hull tanked ramming megas incoming
---
Best bit will be the guys that didn't read the patch notes
---
And it would have been a whole lot more supers if they hadn't sold them all
---
Not used
---
Sounds like you need to reconsider your jamming fits to have faster lock times, or have smartbombers between him and the inhib to kill some fighters as they pass by, or...
---
There are counters, you're just going to have to change your fits and/or fleet comp to do it. Think broader than you apparently have thus far
---
aye.  its kinda clever.  and i ment even if you could kill a fighter. it still wouldnt be enough.
---
thats something to look into
---
forget megas.  grab a freaighter. armor it.  RAM THE TINIES
---
What fighters pass by mate? did you read the description? Read carefully first and then comment. 
---
Fight was concluded with the systematic hunting and slaughter of your fleet.
---
Absolutely amazing fight on the Legacy side. Great coordination on all fronts.
---
Well, its back up to 4.5 now. The situation is unsustainable. CCP has broken the demand/supply-balance.
---
Armor hacs\*
---
I have read, and unless he has some fighters that shoot 70km, which you didnt specify what type at all, it sounds like they would have to fly past your fleet to reach the inhib and get in shooting range
---
As i said he launches them, one salvo and scops them back faster then you can lock in a cruiser , what fly by do you imagine i was talking about?
---
A good hearty laugh indeed! 
---
The Ansiblex is orders of magnitude smaller and less powerful than what you see in the image above. 
---
It wouldn't make sense to use the same model for them :) 
---
do you move through Heimatar and Metro often?
---
Yeh thats right, but you will be spending the majority of your time in Null and most alliances have enough shit on hand you'll never have to go to Highsec.
---
ITT butt mad snuff boi didn't catch the titan
---
The effect that happens in the trailer isn't a weapon, it's just a by-product of the sheer power of the gate when it's brought online for the first time.
---
Massive gravitational and electromagnetic distortion.
---
Or have it done by sqauds and wing's each wing can move independently in the formation with a restriction set by fleet command an same for squads.
---
With enough bosons any fight is winnable. Even against the Chad Elo Knight.
---
init only shot legacy in that fight bw
---
Okay, you have provided no new information whatsoever, and frankly I dont care enough to argue with you. Apparently one specific suggestion i made wont work but you wont explain why so i cant help you any more. Hopefully one of the other suggestions works for you, or you can just keep getting rekt by supers and crying about it on reddit, whichever floats your boat lol
---
Get a job???
---
Wrong. You could not do that. 
---
Maybe the Trigs are just building the angels their capitals finally? I mean... they are overdue and all.
---
If nyx so powerful why not use your own?
---
 Fat Legion. 
---
The nyx pilot kept his head and did the sensible thing - well played to him. I think giving fighters a recall timer affects other scenarios and shouldn't be implemented for such a niche scenario. We don't have such mechanics for regular drones - it would be a real pain in the ass. Maybe buff the cyno inhib? Whatever, take more logi with armor/hull repair drones.
---
What motivates you to keep putting up these threads when they are just attacked by brainless morons who you end up teaching them about game mechanics?
---
If you can't predict where you'll cyno, neither will the enemy.
---
wtb recording on how bad the bosons are

good bot 
---
I'll take Feroxes getting shat on any day. Upvoted, downloaded, liked, subscribed, bell rang!

hehe
---
we fed a bit in the real fight but at least we got an afk rorq
---
i'm motivated by stupidity.
---
Remember: Webs decelerate a ship until m/s reaches a set value.  Adding more webs or stronger webs will not slow the ship faster.  Consider an interceptor that briefly goes inside your web range.  You will slow the ship with your web(s) but the interceptor will probably not be slowed fast enough and could use its inertia to escape web range again.
---
Aar? 
---
Great idea.

Yeah we've struggled for super capital kills this past month. Been a longer dry spell than I've had since I lost my viringity. 
---
Tip: I havnt lost it yet 
---
Only after missing god knows how many Lance's and Bosons. Was great fun!!!!
---
Its actually amazing what FC's come up with do deal with situations. It mentions being able to make ships with large shields to protect ships behind them and FC's have already used this tactic with "Fire Walls" which are ships smart bombing missiles. I agree a lot of thought needs to be put into new features but anything to help future proof the game is good. 
---
Whow, heavy man
---
did you just hashtag in a reddit post? this isnt twitter
---
The kind of shitposting we need.
---
Solution for you. Anchor it 40km off of him. Make the fighters travel. Don‚Äôt cry for new mechanics especially with a nurf bat inc. Adapt just like everyone else does. This game changes drastically from time to time. The name of the game is adapting.
---
WTB: Magic fighters with 70+km range.  
---
Then you obviously didn‚Äôt have webs. The pilot outsmarted your group

all started in 2 systems away on mining rorquals

---
Im going to redo the post. I have video included. 
---
i do believe this could also be done with sentry drones.
---
I like the idea of line of sight as applied to objects in space. It gives a vast new dimension to combat, especially around stations. It might also allow for fights in asteroid belts, things like that. However, CCPLS do not make "asymmetrical" ships or apply line of sight to ships. This would just create frustrating tedium and give FCs a whole new thing to rage at.
---
Damn the torpedoes, FULL SPEED AHEAD!
---
I dont know, the avatars cap regeneration is great for long super fights.
---
The free market in eve is a myth anyway. 
---
Also stop insulting without giving anything constructive. There is a direct need for something to dump isk in and if that means some minor sacrifices for the health of the game in a macro level so be it. Prices are inflating on a ridiculous level and every major alliance has a big cache of all those items. 
---
2 a minute is 60 killed and 3 a minute is is 90. That‚Äôs why I said 2-3. It‚Äôs a range.
---
Open the Pod bay doors, HAL
---
I disagree. A lot of those skills lvl4 is fine. Getting them to lvl5 is only to make you the top damage on killmails.
---
Targeting is a big advantage when in a fleet. So having better targeting skills means your logi is much more effective.
---
I too am gay
---
Pulling them in and redeploying to keep them from getting locked? Certainly. If you mean the rest of the scenario in the OP though, I dont think sentries have the alpha for it
---
I had a lot of fun watching the 3 competent titan pilots in your fleet correctly aim their bosons
---
when you broke out lances there was active laughter on comms
---
&gt;Imagine having to organize 200+ people into formations
---
Honestly this sounds sorta cool, would make being a linemember more than just anchor+f1 most of the time. 
---
I take full credit for this kill. Really made the fleet's day. Zkill lies, it is more like a 6bil killmail. Pretty exhilarating kill as we managed to bait this kronos, who really only wanted to play station games. Been quite a few nice tasty kills since too. So really loving PIRAT participation people. Really good stuff!! :D 
---
You said you want a way to quit eve. Being stolen from by your friends sounds like a great motivator. Why don‚Äôt you try it?
---
Lock time is one thing but total number of locks is just irritating. And why do we need fitting skills? Its literally just kicking newbs in the shins. I mean skills like pg 5 and cpu 5 the skills you should have before you set for in ANY starship. 
---
I can agree we need like gun support skills and all that but the basics that literally every pilot needs before they fly anything is a bit out of hand. You have to sign up for eve set your queue and leave ot for a month THEN you can play the game. Simply because of the fitting skills. Like for an alpha it takes like 2 weeks for each of these *pg5 and cpu5* how is that fair to alphas thet basically cant fit a ship properly till they get theses skills..
---
Im not talking upgrade skills like shield upgrades that reduces the pg for extenders that stuff is fine *altho could be a bit more intuitive for newbros*
---
post comms
---
this could be applied to anything i do, not just playing eve, lol.
---
http://k162.xyz returns "ok" https://k162.xyz is not being served
---
Was a great fight from a testpet perspective.
---
The main engagements themselves were very even dispite the massive number advantage we had. Frat punched above their weight, but were ground down in the end. 
---
The end of the fight was kinda funny, scanning down Elo, then waiting at his safe for the horde of people stuck in a ti-di warp thinking elo must be safe!
---
Eh, most of the big fits can be flown with those skills at lvl 4 by fitting meta mods. You aren't as effective, but you can still fly them.
---
And no cpu amd pg 5 is never acceptable
---
So his fighters had to go 70 kilometers one way, 140 kilometers in total...
---
...and you didn't have enough time to lock them.
---
Fighters with a MWD on go at about 5000km//s at most, so it would have taken them *28 seconds* to go from the super to the target and back.
---
You're telling us all, right here and right now, that *no-one* in your fleet could target and shoot a fighter in *28 seconds*.
---
The problem is with you, not the fighters.
---
Stay in wormhole. its safer for you.
---
"minor sacrifices"  by targetting some of the largest money makers.  aka skins, deadspace, and BPCs.
---
heres a few ideas to sink isk without destroying the economy.
---
the new "buy skill book" for non rare skills that CCP just put in.
---
the Taxes in Jita,  problem being the 0% taxes of perimeter citadels.
---
the fees for war decs, the fees for alliance dues,  the insurance fees,  reprocessing fees(problem is citadels with 0%), fees for POCO deploy, fees for citadel deploy,  
---
with a free market, its always going to inflate as more join said market and scarcity begins.  thats healthy.
---
And yet you're not smart enough to bring a ship that can lock fighters in the few dozen seconds they would take to fly from the ship to the target and back.
---
Loving what line of sight will do to focused fire.
---
Line of sight would be great. Powerful new weapons which only work if the target is in a certain cone directly in front of you, or to the side, like broadsides. 
---
Would give much more engaging content IMO.
---
you are a moron. pls stop posting if you have no idea what you talking about.
---
Here is my ping after fleet, thanks for fight TEST - glad you came
---
Thank you for assisting me in my research, the Frog Laboratory thanks you.
---
If you survived in a frog labs technology, please contract it to Elo Knight when home.
---
Stay cloaked for now in QRBN.
---
If you died, no need to repay the ship - it will be replaced for next weekend to hand out.
---
Very happy - looking forward to next test, we have 3 more test fleets to hand out to try.
---
If some reason you lost a personal ship, mail killmail to Elo knight ingame for SRP, not to Winterco SRP.
---
Appreciate the fury of our Zealots! 
---
IF you made a video, send it to me.
---
yeh imagine being in a elite mining vessel protection alliance instead
---
What a wonderful refutation of my arguments, spodbrain.
---
Ah, so you admit I'm right.
---
Join a corp, I sincerely regret the time I spent solo playing.
---
EvEuniverity has good ship fittings.
---
yes.
---
Why should whether a faction like you affect ship skills. You aren't flying with them, you essentially stole the ship. You have your own crew. It's not like sansha would have built in anything that says " yea we like this guy. I crease power 10%"
---
Seems to be a slight super superiority.
---
And you're getting salty because you don't want to admit to the whole world that you fucked up and couldn't target shit properly, so instead of doing that you post on r/Eve and complain about a perfectly functioning mechanic that is incredibly easy to counter being "broken" and demanding a "fix".
---
The key to avoiding people calling you out on your BS and mocking your five-black-guys-and-a-dragon-dildo-levels of butthurt is to swallow your pride, consider where you went wrong and where you can improve next time, and moving on.
---
I'm reasonably sure that CCP removed those, or at least replaced them
---
Why would you not include them, I mean they are often the source of content?
---
Except the first all you suggestions have been implemented ages ago and are not enough. But ok let's make a tax on character value too. Id say 20% of character value annually so now you have another sink the rich pay the most for
---
Wasn't there a fairly recent shitpost by _high level_ TAPI imbecile recently about how unfair it is that titans are an auto win button vs subcaps?  
---

---
From scale 1-10 how much of an idiot do you consider yourself right now?
---
Noice inversions of SP
---
Is there a Eve survival post explaining this?
---
Giving all to my alt. 
---
If you reduce the range they'll just use more command destroyers. Also I wouldn't mind if the numbers are different, I just used a linear 20% to demonstrate it
---
Maybe it could follow the fibonacci sequence/8 so 0% on the first boosh then 12.5 12.5 25 37.5 62.5 100%
---
It's not random chance either, it's a clear stacking risk that an FC would have to make calls on. It would create a lot more interaction, which is ultimately what people want: "Is this one ship worth booshing away from" "should we go back/wait for stragglers" I imagined the mechanic to be fun to play with and against, after all, losing a T1 battleship doesn't fuck you over at all if you have insurance
---
False! Where is stainguy? 
---
I don't think you understand what side of the argument I'm on here? I'm against faction standings applying to increased ship bonuses.
---
lol, you do realize that nothing you will do will stop inflation.  thats part of the free market.  ffs thats part of real life.
---
Coke was 5 cents once. now its $1.50
---
but the WONDERFUL part of the free market, is that to counter more isk being in circulation, prices can increase (supply and demand) to keep it in balance.
---
your idea puts a limit, and would hurt more as some items end up devalued or over valued due to artificial restraints.
---
take the Raven for instance,  when 30m was rich in eve's early days, how much was a raven.
---
now 1b is rich, how much is raven.
---
the raven's price goes up with its demand.
---
how about the Barghest, expensive ship. high demand.  but the supply is kept low by the players living in Mordu space to keep its price up.     
---
or Bhaal, cheap for a pirate.  demand is mid.  supply is high due to mass selling.   and as demand gets lower, price gets lower.
---
welcome to capitalism.  the pride of Caldari.
---
I wish your life would be concluded with a systemic hunting and slaughter of the last 4 brain cells rattling around in your skull

---
Daredevil says hi, by applying 2x 90% webs and proceeds to repeatedly ram you with its blasters
---
Not fast enough, do to damage speed is also a factor. A freighter would, just like right now in the game, simply push ships away
---
I try to always have some spare sp in case i need something asap. 
---
All I see is a butthurt FC who's terrible at her job.
---
And that ends with people not being able to generate enough isk anymore and then stop playing the game. Which means less people and less contend and so it cascades 
---
...
---
fk...i was going to suggest bumping it with 2 machs
---
then i realized what would happen to the machs.....
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
lol. moron.
---
So you admit I'm right.
---
So many neuts out there.
---
Yes, ofc
---
Good to know.
---
You asked the question then asked "if not, why?"
---
I was just building on the discussion
---
Question; Did the events from that trailer ever happened? O.o
---
You need to learn why a high plex price is bad for the game.
---
Yeah, that sounds equally as boring.
---
Now go find the real Monolith near EVE Gate :) that‚Äôs a way better find 
---
I'm surprised you can count that high.
---
Stop quoting me
---
I sexually identify as a jackdaw
---
Done!
---
This could be a good relaxing video if done right, but it really doesn't fit the super excited music.
---
Shit that's smart as hell. Sounds likes it's working as intended 
---
nope.  it means rare stuff becomes more expensive yes.  but common and uncommon stuff become more plentiful, and their price scales appropriately.
---
example, back when making 30m was hard.  raven was appropriately priced
---
getting a raven now is easier than it was back then. as now making 30m is easy, even for a new player.
---
we also have more ways to make isk.  incursions, lv 4, nulslec ratting, abyssal, and on and on.
---
the only stuff that is harder to buy, is stuff like officer mods, rare skins, limited number items, and so on.  and those make sense as rarity is a quality.
---
ffs i'm in Horde, i train newbeans to get set up in EVE.  and never have i heard htem complain "its impossible to generate enough isk anymore"
---
usually, they more concerned about logistics of moving all their stuff.
---
What I told you that VNI was playing AOE2 at the same time and won the match
---
it's a definition statement
---
and you won EVE
---
Okay, so I am genuinely curious: What is the counter the this? One that won't get three quarters of your fleet podded out of the wormhole? If a wormholer's podded, we don't have the ability to get straight back into the fight because our jump clone is in the same system.
---
Genuinely curious. 
---
But it works in highsec gate camps! 
---
Well there is not counter to it. Especially if he has t2 fighters. You can't lock them, he kills the inhib and lights the cyno to get saved. 
---
I did not know that, thanks. Explains how I‚Äôve failed a few catches :) 
---
What's a decent mech fit right now. I only have aboit a bil isk available. 
---
hi goon
---
Can anyone explain the fit, I just dont get it.
---
He gave up, as in he won Eve, pity about your lack of content...
---
Line of sight would be great. It would mean that pilots would actually have to fly their ships instead of just approach+f1. It would add a whole new level of skill to the game.
---
People who struggle to anchor+f1 should add minimal value to a fleet. It gives better groups something they can do against n+1.
---
Piece of Steve, unit of lag, fedo, well worn fedora
---
Pro strats right there!
---
have another look there bucko
---
This could easily be fixed by making fighters 
---
Yeah man totally. No idea what you talk about doh.
---
we love ya to.  now undock and fight!
---
Ya...i think we are blue right now to like red alliance ect
---
Reload is a really nice guy, I expected to find him on the list :)
---
They're pretty nasty if bait-fit. Their 500 DPS applies fully to cruisers and if you expect them to be anti-tanked but they're suddenly omnitanked that counts for a lot.
---
keep it up, ur mental endurance must be so strong haha
---
:))
---
1. What the fuck are those **LANCES** test??
---
2. Drop 12 titans at point blank, 3/4 of them miss their bosons...
---
GF test, c u on teh battlefeld o7o7o7 9/11
---
It would only be cool if manual piloting was less aids. But I do have to agree, it would be beneficial to the game if fighting was more engaging and less like managing a spreadsheet. 
---
You never had a soul, in the first. So, don't worry, and keep minning.

This works. Its what eve uni had on their site. But ask around an incursion group they usually have slite variants. Bling what you can but I think this work's. Altho sum ask for artillery instead of Ac's
---
I briefly looked for the name of the alpha incursion group but it appears they dont have a website but there is a group somewhere they have an ad ingame
---
You can also use a cheaper hull if you want but you wont get in as many fleets
---
Nope. 
---
It was meant to be a bit of a preview of the future. A tease of what they imagined was coming.
---
In fact the Ansiblex gates are....quite small and very regional compared to -that thing-. The gate in the trailer was closer to what it would be like to open a second EVE Wormhole.

That comic doesn't have infinite space, it can only mention the important alliances.
---
I do understand your point. I mostly look for people who dont have the options you get in nullsec because maybe they dont want to join a big alliance or coalition. I myself am in Goonswarm so I definately dont have a problem generating isk. My vision would be items that arent needed for the broad playerbase but interesting unique enough so people who already have a lot of isk want to spend their money on it. Maybe deadspace items etc arent the best option for that. But as I see it there is way too much raw isk generated and not enough sinking away into the depths of the game again. I have absolute no problem with player trading but there just needs to be something to get all that isk out of the system again without just shifting between individual players. 
---
I really think someting like a black market where you can directly buy from NPCs isnt a bad idea, but i do understand that items which other people depend on for their wealth generation arent good for that. 
---
I personally just dont see a lot of options other then nerfing the isk generation as a whole and thats when a lot of other people will start crying too thats why i thought of a way where you can dump generated isk directly back to NPCs

I think that as long as there is that itch to keep logging in and do things - keep on going. People leave when that is gone and every time they "have to" log in they feel like giving up... or gave up already some time ago and the last time they even clicked on EvE was months ago and they just now realising it, as they hadn't missed it even a bit... then it's time to win. 
---
cant get any good help these days.
---
Mining? No, I'm not that dead inside yet
---
don't need to be in nullsec.
---
i have newbeans in neut corps in highsec running incursions
---
i have newbeans i run lv 4s with.  train to run burners.   even do abyss running.
---
as long as the items being sold arent rare items like officer, BPC, deadspace, skins,  or in some way hurt industrialists.  its fine.
---
options: Volitile skins, npc sold boosters(weaker than player boosters, but cheaper or longer lasting), putting a higher "minimum" tax on citadels to avoid tax evasion. 
---
btw, a big isk sink. is the LP store.   people put isk and LP in, to get an item. which they sell for isk.  but hte isk they spent on it with the LP, is gone.
---
so altering lv 4 missions to give more LP, less isk.  
---
peets sake, the LP store sounds like that your suggesting.  only it does it in a way that doesn't hurt player made items.  (instead ot upgrades them to navy issue).
---
so focus on that.  
---
though isk inflaiton will still continue on.  but the free market keeps it balanced, even with the LP store.
---
If CCP fixed this repeatedly relaunch fighter "bug", tackled carrier would literally unable to fight back or even put up some resistance because fighters will die like fly, and not to say how powerful ECM is while countering fighters
---
The only thing I could say is this Nyx pilot knew what he was doing
---
Give fighters 1 minute weapons timers.

You have to understand one thing - a pirate doesn't give a damn if you're a 3 day old newbro or a 12 year veteran, if you present yourself as a target, they will kill you. There are corps and people who specifically target new players,but others just want to kill you because it's fun to pew pew stuff. It's a game, people do whatever it takes to have fun, even if that means being an asshole to others. Just like in real life, you will meet others who are assholes and who don't care about you or your feelings and you just have to deal with it. It doesn't matter if you think it's immoral, there are no rules in eve, there is no Bushido code of honor that players need to follow. If you don't change the way you think, eve is always going to be full of frustration for you, and that's not what a video game is supposed to give you
---
Every time balance complaints come up in this (or really any) game this kind of statement gets thrown around by bitter types.  If a mechanic is broken, nobody's going to altruistically just decide to stop using it.  Supers and titans are an I-win button. They are stupidly imbalanced toward subcaps.  Why wouldn't we use them until CCP nerf them properly?
---
Lukewarm off the presses!

Higher plex prices are good for CCP, so higher prices are better for the game because the servers can keep running for longer

Most people combine skill farms with PI, which gives you depending on the setup additionally 500mil to 1.5bil ISK/month.

---
What exactly do you expect from a war? Fair 10v10 fights? Lol
---
&gt; So I just read [*this*](https://www.pcgamer.com/how-eve-onlines-experimental-10000-player-battle-could-radically-change-its-future/?ns_campaign=article-feed&amp;ns_mchannel=ref&amp;ns_source=steam&amp;ns_linkname=0&amp;ns_fee=0) article. And the idea of asymmetrical ships does sound appealing. What doesn't sound appealing is a line-of-sight mechanic. Imagine having to organize 200+ people into *formations.* People struggle to keep anchor *as it is.* Or maybe CCP will introduce a way of having your fleet automatically get into a presaved formation? At least they have a lot of time until they can actually implement any of this, so it will hopefully have a lot of thought put into itkappa. 
---
This would be great. The whole thing of a giant blob stacked on top of each other and shooting through each other is what turns me off from it in addition to the lag and current obvious issues. It also greatly limits tactics and in general dumbs down the gameplay to follow and F1.
---
On the small scale, it will open up a whole bunch of tactics using fast ships that can weave in and out of LOS using whatever is available in the immediate environment.
---
how do you figure?
---
higher price means more people are incentivized to buy, but the fact it's high means fewer people are, you get that right?
---
God damn 60% tidi in nearby systems ruined my isk p/h lol.
---
On a second note, I was late for the fun once again but how did I manage to loot only 300mil out of all these billions hmmm CCP???
---
If multiple scimis couldn't keep the inhib alive against constantly recycled fighters from one carrier, this is broken. The lack of counterplay is the problem here. 
---
It was a while back I'm afraid.
---
Maa, more like https://imgur.com/a/HSrJFNM ü§ü

Lol he got ratted. I bet the bean got a nice bounty tick but didnt otherwise really noticed.
---
Oh, i see where you're trying to get at. See, while it's possible that fewer people are buying plex, doesn't it make more sense that due to the value of isk falling in comparison to plex that the price of plex is increasing? Food for thought
---
My subcap-only main will finally be training into a cap as Ive run out of subcap skills to max out. So yeah, cap skills for a blap phoenix.

---
Sounds like you really enjoyed hunting DED runners.  Try doing that again.  
---
Then bring more logi, that solves all problems in eve
---
And lack of "counterplay"? Well, nice joke, there are tens of thousands of solo ships got ganked each day and you are talking about a legitimate "counterplay"?
---
engaging gameplay. dont forget useless anchor restrictions on inhibs...
---
Mechanics that work like that are super bad game designs they take away player agency and give harsh consequence.
---
The point that they will bring more booshers here is non-relevant, It changes the engagement field more ships can move and shoot with more agility 75-150km vs 100-200km . Cruisers will be able to give chase to a BS boosh fleet and potentially out maneuver them. It opens the field on what shits are able to take part in boosh fleets allowing more engagements and counter potential.
---
 And what about the salvage,  you're brave after all?
---
give fighters weapons timers even 20 seconds is better than nothing.
---
that makes the pirat guy look even worse, all he had to do was use his kitey tackle ship to kite and tackle, and he would have lived, but instead he goes to scram range and dies in a fire.
---
Due to the amount of ore being mined, products that are made using t1 materials haven't really seen a rise in price. However, if you look at t2 salvage or at AT ships, you'll see that in general the prices are increasing.
---
the real question is why was the rapier in scram range when it has a disrupter fitter?
---
No salvager on my crow lol
---
Love you too
---
I'm not familiar of any groups that have a similar agreement with a neighbor as CO2 did with PH back in Vale.
---
Basically CO2 &amp; PH were frenemies. We had smaller and larger skirmish battles for content but neither side was allowed to shoot at eachothers miners or structures/systems and we could go run DED sites in eachothers systems. You however were fine to be shot at, but many PH guys didn't care.
---
If anyone knows of groups with similar agreements with neighboring groups, please do let me know.
---
So to actually answer your question instead of just flaming you. Solo mining sucks. If you want to mine, Find a group of people to mine with. There are things called ‚Äúboosts‚Äù (kinda like buffs in other games) that significantly increase the rate you mine at. Groups are also safer to mine in since a random solo player isn‚Äôt really gonna be able to touch you. 
---
Warp the freighter in at 0. It has speed as it comes out of warp lol

You know that you can make "recruit a friend" account, get free 250k sp and use it as wh eyes?
---
 Don't forget it next time..
---
Age of Kings? Are there still servers for that game? 
---
shouldn't it be RMT legion now that play with a group who's CEO got banned for it?
---
I see that. The problem is, that almost every mechanic in the game is built around fights being a few big blobs shooting each other. And as interesting as large scale fights could be with that mechanic in place, they would be an absolute nightmare to manage. As I already said, people are stupid. Upping that floor of necessary fleet cohesion and organization will inevitably lead to disaster if not implemented in a way that only makes it marginally harder for line members. A big part of this is also EVE's movement and piloting mechanics, which are trash. I would certainly enjoy it if they fixed both of these issues, tho.
---
You're going to get down voted because "REEEEEEE people playing the game differently than how I think they should enjoy it" but you're not wrong. 
---
Reps are not holding! Everyone shield the primary from incoming fire!
---
I‚Äôll make sure I have my crow fully fitted for the juicy salvage!
---
they're not sending their best
---
How often do you really get to practice Lances though? Good practice.
---
Take my upvote. Sadly i only have one to give.
---
Double negative, you just admitted this was interesting to see. 
---
Why do you even hint at this being intended and not a bug. The pilot of the Nyx is fully aware of the fact that he can just do this if there's an inhib going up against a group like this. Doesn't matter if he's just a stupid krab or not.
---
Of course caps and over should hold their own against subcaps in smaller numbers, but if a Muninn fleet with T2 logi (80+ members in that fleet by looking at the vid btw) can't outrep the inhib nor defang, how isn't that broken?
---
There should 100% either be some sort of mechanic that prevents this from happening. Either figthers get a short weapons timer, or can't be scooped that quickly.
---
If you put the graphics all the way down, they look like a massive white block where the object didn't load and some random default white block replaced it
---
no where near comparable to plex, and meta modules are stagnant 
---
You can't rep damage that alphas into bleeding hull you idiot.
---
never really asked why they add them to the fleets. Maybe for salvage ops? Tractor in the enemy wrecks as fast as possible. 
---
Because the locking speed games(quick dock/undock and gate camp) had been existed in Eve since, probably the day it was born
---
I'm sick about people calling out it being a "bug" because they can't get a easy brain dead kill just because their opponent has some part of a functional brain left
---
&gt;\*\*There should be upper limit for how many PLEXed accounts player can have\*\* and no limit on running subs.
---
The game allows seperate accounts, each one on its seperate e-mails, it would be very difficult for it to ID which ones are being run from same system then enforce those rules.
---
You can't use IP otehr then to flag to check for bots because too many people have legit shared IPs or dynamic IPs and even if you have a bot on an IP that doesn't mean the next person on same one is that bot. You would ban too many wrong people.
---
That leaves unique hardware identifiers, but those can also be very easily reset and spoofed, hell I have all that shit disabled starting from my router through every device I have, except my phone which I never connect to my hardwired internet ISP, keep it on its own network at all times. And I do that just cause of basic security precautions. Disable everything I don't use cause why provide unnecessary attack vectors ?
---
Then you have VMs. Not much to say here, you would have to have the game dig very deep into the OS, so much so that it might fuck with it in bad ways or be illegal in at least some countries due to compromising systems security in doing so. Though if the game were able to determine if it is being ran in a VM on actual hardware, that I thing would be an excellent flag to tack on top of the other flags, to do some investigating.
---
The only thing I see that would be of practical use if they were to set a hard limit in the game exec as to how many clients max can be ran. This would force use of VMs thus upping the system reqs at least and that in turn would make a small dent.
---
Everyone is talking about the bosons, did anyone see the lances? Damn I had so much fun actually using them is a realistic situation. 
---
Next thing on the agenda, make fw great again so people spend more time there, generate more lp and spend that for the market xD  
---
but yeah LP stores are a good implementation but dont get as much appreciation as they should

what about repping the inhib? that could be a counter
---
thanks dude

Fair point

That was my suggestion. I got hanged for it in the previous post.
---

rip FW.....every update gives it more problems and makes it that much more painful to fix....
---
People wana protecc their OP boats so they can attacc the rats in peace with a cyno. 
---
Yes he did. He killed the inhib with this tactic. With each shot he took 2-3 or even 5% of strcuture.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75954871/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75954871/) 
---
I understand what you are saying. Then Cyno Inhib need a serious buff. But i still see that fighter tactic a bit OP.
---
The Nyx got off about 2 cycles each time, also no armor drones to rep the armor of the inhib and give it more surviveability. All I hear is that a caught super isnt allowed to get any counterplay.
---
He's going to see a lot of shitfits if he's looking at ganked miners on zkillboard.
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt have a clue about how flying carriers work if this is any news to you. 
---
I hear c0ne is recruiting,  and they are a bunch of good guys
---
We are using the tools the game provides. The tools are turning out to be inadequate to scale. That is the key problem. We need tools that work on scale not individual kills. 
---
The second, smaller but still significant problem is that we need these tools to be easily usable by newbros and alphas. T3Cs, bombers, all that stuff is just not applicable. If the tools we had were usable by more people then that would make a dent. 
---
Also, tools provided are being eliminated, or at least the bloc controlled CSM is advocating to further eliminate them. For example take a look at the last CSM minutes and how they want the last of nullified ships to be removed. This is 100% pure agenda there. The game needs more nullified ships and more of such mechanics that allow people to engage and GTFO, not less.
---
This really hits it on spot, although I have to say that this was just a shower thought.
---
Getting a more active experience during structure fights and sieges is what I was trying to get at, if that makes sense. 
---
Introducing active reps was an example I had on the top of my head, but how to balance things after that is something I haven't even considered.
---
You went with the nuclear option instead of brawling with superior numbers. But I understand the cowardice of your FC's I wouldn't want to fight Elo either.

Maybe next time posted a better clip so CCP could use it for some number tweaking

The broken thing here is not the fighters, it's the inhib - in this case specifically the terrible HP distribution that means you can't keep one up under reps. That's what needs fixing (along with a bunch of other stuff that's broken about inhibs).
---
Well, without plex sales data from CCP we won't know if people actually are buying less plex or if it's just caused inflation
---
I see nothing wrong. The Nyx pilot was aware of what he had to do. Fighters would have been getting molested otherwise which would hve rendered the Carrier defenseless. Next time you could bring armor drones too to help keep the inhib alive. that should do the trick. Nerfing carriers even more of buffing inhibs just benefits big alliances and hurts the small ones. 
---
Will look into them immediately. Thank you Ronin
---
Neh I hate PIRAT for only one thing. Their botting/RMT Nyxes in KWG and how their entire alliance is funded with botting money. How PIRAT leadership is still able to continue playing the game while caught red handed a year or so. How as soon it got out that PIRAT was behind the infamous 10+ botting nyxes that got killed by some wormhole alliance they instantly replaced they CEO of PIRAT with an alt to avoid the alliance getting locked up due to a possible incoming banwave. Yet CCP did shit.

Do you see the drones on the inhib? they were remote armor drones. So you keep finding glitches in our gameplay and stuff that we haven't done acording to you but you don't say anything about the fact that a Nyx can kill an inhib with 3 t1 termites even if we have logi on it? Great point of view. 
---
Fighter balancing is one hek of a hot potato.
---
If they are too strong subcaps fall into a bad spot
---
If fighters are weak, on the other hand, yes, it will bring much subcap roaming fun back, but nobody would undock their 15b big toy for others to hunt down
---
I agree with you, but not only for the inhib, what CCP really needs to take a look at is not Capital balancing, but the entire cyno system
---
FC, this isn't a Rock Haven wot do?

Not sure I follow your offense?
---
See you at the next station? Is that... wrong? \*confused\*
---
Glad I could reach out to some kids here to. Thanks for the reply.
---
imagine injecting billions upon billions of isk to fly a titan only to not be able to hit a subcap blob at point blank 
---
See my edit.
---
We had small remote armor drones on it. And if you think a single Nyx with no support should out match 40 ppl in munnins with scimi  then i hope you don't run for csm.
---
that makes sense except when you consider that PIRAT doesn't actually put up decs on random new player corps.
---
aside from which it's now impossible to dec a group without a structure, and even if the new player corp wants a structure they can place it in an alt corp to avoid any and all PVP if desired
---
sorry but you are not making a single valid point here and it doesnt matter how many years you've been mad about this issue
---
what these guys do is cary out mercenary contracts and hunt for people flying or transporting valuable stuff in between ops. your views are not based on facts, just salt.
---
Low plex prices are worse for the game / CCP.
---
All the cry babies who can't afford plex need to get some money IRL to pay for their account.
---
I started fraps only a few seconds for this tactic to be recorded. My comp is not strong enough to run several clients and record. 
---
FUCK YOU
---
If that's the case then you are a bigger idiot, because of the Nyx pilot in this case have to manually relaunching fighters every few seconds and fighters have to relock inhibitor after each relaunch(which brought the total time longer than fighters primary weapon cycle time), the brust Damage is even lower
---
EVE-U
---
and avoid newbro corps.  or goons.  or meme corps. or.....well
---
yeah....go to EVE-U.
---
This is correct. I wrote about it in the past. Cyno engagements will always be preffered. Cyno is instant. Instant save of instant action. No need to wait for an FC to ping and raise a fleet when you can jump your titan or super straight into action. So yes. the cyno mechanic needs to be redone in my opinion. 
---
i mean i dont know your exact numbers about dps and logi etc. I can only tell about what I have seen when I am hunting with my sig and our biggest problem is normally respondfleets because of subcapfleets warping in or caps warping in or an early cyno. We normally dont have problems keeping the inhib alive
---
nah we have other people in CSM for that thanks :D
---
You are correct. But i see this fighter tactic being a bit broken as well. 
---
There is an element that Eve lacks. let me describe it first, its from playing other PvP MMOs though out my life.
---
What Eve lacks is assymetrical direct warfare. In other games I have played, many times a group of players that is better individually skilled and has better teamwork can often take out opponents while being outnumbered by a factor of 2-3. Sometimes I have been in groups that take out opponents outnumbering us up to 5:1. It all comes down to tactics and skill of individual player at both individual level as well as fullfilling their team role and then coordinating all that. It is difficult to achieve.
---
In contrast, in Eve all you are ending up with is N+1. I feel like implimentation of LOS mechanics will go a longway to allieviate this. 
---
The nightmare will be only for those groups that will be stupid and fail at both individual and team work. These should die which currently is not the case.

Fighters engage just 1 second after command. If target is in optimal it does not move much so it can be rescoped instantly after damage has been aplied. All process... 2-3 seconds. You can't lock them fast enough and you can't rep the damage hes doing. So ... ?

500mn HFI 10k m/s suicide runs would be glorious
---
Form my own experience the actual time need for the process you've said is much longer
---
Once launched
---
1) Fighters will spend about 1-2 seconds jerking around, setting up a orbit around the carrier
---
2) Fighters will take at least one second to lock onto anything
---
3) Registering damage usually will take one second
---
4) When recalling fighters they usually will fly for a short distance towards carrier even within scoop range
---
5) And there is a big part, fighters will spent a few seconds to refuel, even without any special ammo used
---
Didn‚Äôt you know, this is the ‚Äúculture‚Äù of goons... Every time they fly through our space and I see shit talk in local, I think hmm is it goons again and yup, it‚Äôs them again haha. Some of them are good guys tho, but not the majority, could have something to do with 37k members.
---
Eve uni or just pick a Corp and talk to the people in the public chat for a while 
---
No, you got it all wrong. A low price encourages players to buy more plex as they dont get much isk. A high price is the opposite and makes players quit.

So are parts of hisec. When I have to get to Urlen from Sayartchen I have to take the 47 jump route otherwise I would have to go through Niarja.
---
Depends on hull I guess. Tengu or heavy loki could work. Maybe heavy legion. But range, damage type, resists. Are the basics you have to worry about. Beyond that you probably need a travel fit. So the answer is more of you can carry enough refits maybe you can do it. But you really should just fight one or two factions. Like bloodraiders and sansha same resist profile..ish but like sansha then angels is begging to die cuz of off resists. If that makes sense.. Lol
---
If were talking lower level content like 6-8 /10s and avoiding 10/10s you can get away with a lot more.
---
Grath. Bosh takes 5.5 sec roughly. He can launch you can boosh, he can scoop. No COunter to it. 
---
We are capsuleers. Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. 
---
Resistance is futile. 
---
"Not very" is my guess.
---
Git gud
---
Eve uni wiki is good yes. I should have said that :P
---
I never used anything but battleclinic or my head, so I can't speak to how good osmium was its just the one the lasted the longest afaik. 
---
Your best resource is your brain and experience but that takes years of playing and learning the game.
---
depends where you hunt. For example in delve. We tackle stuff and online inhib. Inty comes at 200km+ and lights a cyno. Single titan comes trough and insta pops the inhib and clears the path. 
---
Test are now having their Morale war because they got their shit pushed in by horde 1 to many times.
---
Except those people that continually managed to get themselves killed by CONCORD accidentally.... of course.
---
I had fun regardless. I'm guessing your titan pilots had fun. The ones that actually hit something that is.
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
Vinni listed on KM in capsule lmao
---
Firstly, no, you aren't. If people were using the tools that the game provides, the way people like BB or HK do it, Rorqual mining in null would be as suicidal as it is in WHs, minerals would be way harder to source, caps would be harder to replace.
---
If BB can roll a null static and kill caps in the heart of Delve, so can any group. Sure, I can "paper theorize", but I don't need to, because I log in twice a weekand kill rorqs and nyxes and minos in a bunch of t2 fit frigates.
---
Secondly, bombers are very easily used by newbros, and the skills you need to get into one ate compatible with explo training. The restriction placed on alphas are there for good reasons.
---
And thirdly, how conveniently you ignore that CCP just announced substantial nerfs to carriers, titans and rorqs. But sure, ccp is always against you, and you know what's best for the game. You want it cheap, powerful, easy to disengage, low sp, what else? It's a bomber. It's a Talos. Ships need drawbacks, but no, let's have it all.
---
TL;DR: why aren't you rolling a null static right now? Why aren't you sitting in a blops, waiting to cyno 50k dps on top of a super? Why are you not killing caps, while we are?
---
Posting about how our FCs are cowards and don't want to fight elo definitely sounds more like salt posting than someone who had fun, but OK.
---
If I'm honest, last time it rained bosons on me, I had a pretty shit time, so props to you for finding a way to have fun with that.
---
OPs logi piloting isn't the icing of the cake either ...
---
yeah, im bad, was multiboxing other things...
---
This is the silliest thing ever so I'll just drop it.
---
&gt; Make fighters that can scram.
---
You suggest that the cooldown will kill small gang and then propose a solution that literally would kill small gang. Nice.
---
This is the kind of stuff why I do zkill, evewho, etc etc.
---
I wasn't named in the list, but I don't care. I know there are thousands of people who use utilize my tools to make their lives easier (or others' lives more difficult) and that makes me happy.
---
EvE Uni is a great suggestion, also have you tried looking into Signal Cartel ? They're a peaceful exploration corp with a very mature community, although they follow a credo that strictly forbids engaging in PvP unless you are attacked first, would highly recommend them if you're looking for a unique experience with a great bunch of people.
---
Brack Region
---
I'm pretty new too, 30 days in. I've noticed the soulless pirates you talk about who blast ventures and then laugh
---
when you send them messages about it. I tend to agree with you, they are pretty heartless about the brutal learning curve, but there is so much worse. My suggestion is if you wanna mine in .4 you might wanna invest in a procurer, they are very tanky and can hold defense drones, if you can use integrated yet, get those.
---
Take a blingy Marauder around in wormholes. 
---
I suggested in your last post, maybe review the inhib. If you still think something should be done with the fighters perhaps give them a separate lock timer so there is a delay in firing after launch. 
---
I still think the nyx pilot kept his head and came up with a good plan to gtfo. Can't win 'em all m8. 
---
It's ok friend, I understand test would be salty about this that's why you guys bent over for goons so you could feel safe.
---
Sounds like you need thicker skin there bud. And also expletives are not purely the verbiage of children. Adults are free to and i see them use such language all the time.
---
In my experience online spaces that stifle the way people are allowed to communicate by banning expletives just end up being just that, stifling. Of everything because a lot of people let one slip out every now and then and that leads to chastisement and then there silence.
---
What are you even on about?
---
Why would I be salty about bosoning the fuck out of some random FRT fleet, and what do Goons have to do with any of this?
---
Cap escalations in C5s make between 1-2 bn per hour, not too hard to pay for pled doing that. 
---
just use hurricanes or something and see how it works out
---
#TYPICAL TAPI
---
First off, we're TAPI. Like, we're not horrible, but we definitely don't claim to be elite either.
---
So yeah, if we need two  bosons to hit, we drop 12 Titans, and it sometimes works.  
---
Well fighters are broken too, but that's not the issue here.
---
some people will be dumb enough
---
Oh trust me i know. We have a very low succes rate into killing rorquals/supers certain areas. Yes i agree, they should work on inhib attributes and mechanics. But this tactic in my opinion is broken as it has no counter to it. If there is no work done to inhib then this is simply OP as hell. 
---
This isn't solo moving though is it, you used alts, next time use gates
---
1. Never share screenshot with your actual account name, that's not good
---
2. As you can see at the top left side of the launcher there is your account with "Play" button left to it. Try clicking it, it should start client for that account
---
You can have multiple accounts, it is not against the rules. You don't even have to open them with unique email addresses, you can have all on the same email. You can add all of those accounts to launcher. If you PLEX your accounts (buy Omega time) you can start all of your Omega accounts at once.  You can have only one Alpha Account running at a time.
---
Put two spaces at the end of each line so reddit formats that correctly.

Wow!!
---
Check out some NRDS Corps, mostly in Great Wildlands and Providence. There are always plenty of reds in that space and enough blues to form small fleets and roam everyday.
---
Dont play, its The only way to win.
---
I've seen them hugging 4-4 daily. The fuck are you smoking?
---
No idea what that title says but holy shit that's a pricy one
---
Found the pIRAT station hugger
---
Yeah I can understand the hate about the allegations of botting. I don‚Äôt think the average member is RMT‚Äôing but again it‚Äôs not something that anyone has ever openly talked about. We do have an ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù and ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù speaking sides of Pirat, so maybe all the Russians are RMT‚Äôing, or maybe some of my fellow English speakers are RMT‚Äôing. It would all be speculation.
---
What I do know is that ISK from contracts goes to the members involved and loot from drops is equally split among those involved. With all the blingy shit we fly and the multiple implant sets, I don‚Äôt see where there‚Äôs any room to speculate that members are RMT‚Äôing.
---
It appears like the original CEO was botting, according to those Reddit threads and if that even is true it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs involved with Pirat in any way currently.
---
I don't want to sound nuts with this but since you are passionate about it and I understand why I will give copy paste of my comment not so long ago on one of the threads.
---
Again I know what I heard and I am not crazy, nor do I want to give people fake hopes since I heard it like year or so ago.
---
&gt;I allways had sound off when I was playing but about year or two ago when I was visiting drifter nexus in one of those wormholes I turned on the sound that day for muh immersion, upon reaching the vortex effect in final room and messing around with camera angles for screenshots I would hear this weird chatter on just one specific angle and in just that camera position.
---
&gt;I tried to mess around with advanced audio options to lower other sounds that interfere with the chatter and I swear I heard that chatter in one of if not the best trailers from CCP and hearing Valkyries, intercept those troop carriers confirmed for me it was from that video.
---
&gt;It was repeating timeframe from 2:02 to 2:25 from this [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFTUazuGdTw) 
---
&gt;I found that interesting to say the least but shrugged it off for devs must be messing around with explorers or just weird bug.
---
Did you boson? You said earlier you have been salty about being bosoned.. you are starting to sound a little salty bud go get some water.
---
"Where is the library" in Spanish lol
---
Does he really need the cap controls?
---
How fucking mad you have to be to complain about being dropped by supers after dropping supers on anything that moves in Detorid.
---
Elo specialty is running away from any fights.
---
Think the greenlight/redlight pings broke something in your brain buddy.
---
its a shitty meme
---
I'm sorry you suck at reading.
---
dude, you sound pretentious as fuck. 
---
They just need to tone down the 14 core skills a bit. They shouldnt be month long trains just to fit mods like everyone else.
---
Besides that everythings fine
---
I started UO when I was about that his kids age. Not all kids are impulsive impatient etc. Funny what you reveal when you project. 
---
This. I swear like a motherfucker so you think that makes me a child? Op you sound like either a teenager trying to act 'mature' or you're a sheltered adult. 
---
People say such a lot, it's a good word. 
---
Ah ok I guessed you were multiboxing due  to some parts of you not doing anything, that excuse the piloting a bit :P
---
Not that I care about such trivialities, but I can see how it might be annoying if the vocal majority of your corp know no other way to communicate with one another without sperging and memeing at all fucking times. Sure they're all having a good time but it can get old.
---
Read title, thought "glwt". Read post. Yep. 
---
Yay dumb ass auto bots! Glad you enjoyed a fight!
---
More players in game the better
---
honestly eve feels more like starshitizen, it's only about taking screenshots, jacking eachother off on reddit and discussing all the new juicy skins/PLEX prices...
---
Bullshit, you literally had no tank and only took 150k damage. Capitols are intended to be used in fleet or as fleet support. AF's are in a good place. Hopefully now pilots think twice before dropping carriers on small gangs at every opportunity or using them to rat new Eden into something resembling Venezuela.
---
Tech2 tier3 BCs. Similar hull traits, single (nom HAW) capital weapon. Siege cruiser or something. 
---
At least we know Rekrab undocks not like some.
---
What the hell is with that pod?
---
Maybe axial-mount. Vessel has to be aligned to the target to hit. The code's already there with moon probes and it makes for an interesting bit of balance since that makes it harder to get away if shit hits the fan.
---
Plus, it adds a new dimension to fleet combat.
---
They are large, aka legacy rigs from a different era when carriers had a different role.
---
WOW, you got baited hard
---
I think Line of sight would be awkward to properly manipulate with how you move your ship. Line of sight would work better in games with Elite Dangerous, where you‚Äôre actually in the cockpit flying with a joystick and a throttle
---
Thatd be pretty cool. Like WW2 tank destroyers. That would allow for the boat to maintain the nimbleness of the T3bc hull without being OP as hell in the presence of excessive paints and webs.
---
&gt; they could have actually fought as they had a sizeable carrier fleet 
---
and enough subs to fight. 
---
&gt;However as you said there was nothing the defenders could of done about it even if you didn't have booshs.
---
wot
---
A smartbomb on a logi? 
---
Good bait o7
---
I mean yeah, we all can dream.
---
But i doubt eve even can change it's core combat mechanics to that degree...
---
it's just really weird that all you weirdos swear up and down that i'm some leadership figure when i'm literally just a line member and all the shit i say is stuff everyone can figure out if they just use their damn brain for once in their life
---
Jousting phantasms :)
---
ty ty
---
Hmm I said I could understand why you would be salty about getting bosoned, that is why you bent over for goons who like to boson things
---
Thx, fixed!
---
Haha, you know the tears are real when nullbears post 300mil ISK killmails and everyone upvotes.
---
Good job pirate, looks like you are doing something right.
---
Oh that's what it is. I was told it was stay cunty. My bad.
---
Then go play star citizen then

Looking for an adult corp. First sentence references "straight dope". 
---
He can also MHD fighters back
---
Try to see Eve as a simulator that allows us all to explore all forms of morality. Letting ones inner sociopath out in the game can be very healthy. Eve is a sandbox so that we can do all these things.
---
If "bad" guys gank you mining, then put on your cape and costume , jump in something pew-pewy, and go show those guys how good always overcomes evil or whatever.  
---
Someone linked this thread in our discord and it almost makes me want to play eve again.
---
Almost.
---
Reading through the answers I realize I still have a steep learning curve.. Range, resist types, etc... 
---
Going to have dedicated fits for specific activities. What do I need? Travel, exploration, pve? 
---
Going to have to research site types...
---
For now it's WH space im interested in. So WH C1-3 sites and ghost sites in these locations.
---
I already changed to the quad lif. I also packed a mobile depot, some nano paste and a hull &amp; armor repairer for licking my wounds on extended trips..
---
I try to hop around in WH space for a week or so. Did that in an astero but was always a bit limited and want to broaden site types and fun factor
---
Wheres the Lowsex Gate to Stain?
---
found razor
---
Not in your prefered area but Of Sound Mind, a wormhole corp, has a nice and non-edgelord adult player base. finding them is why I'm still losing eve.  
---
What a fucking shitty thread.
---
Why am I getting angry messages from test dudes. Thought you guys were'nt salty.. go cry to your 50k man coalition or something. Test has done nothing but run until they bent over for goons.
---
Take my upvote. DO IT CCP.
---
Just like IRL carriers, launching/having carriers out requires reduced manueverability, making aligning a very slow process and reducing max velocity to 30%.  
---
Wym?
---
You know when you have a retarded idea, without grasping what it even would do to the game? I think you do.
---
People like this is what ruins eve
---
Ya I'm waiting to find out which Corp I'm going to join to get into specifics. I applied to dreddit and the process is taking way too long. I applied to PH in game as well. I will eventually join whichever takes me first. 
---
It would also make half of what us line members do impossible. Look at military history and the formation leading polka dotted planes of WWII for an example of the ensuing chaos. 
---
Don't get me wrong, that would be cool in something going for functional realism like Elite, but I don't think manual 3d formations would be a good thing for EVE. Even if the option existed we'd just anchor as is
---
This would be complete, total cancer with 1 second ticks.
---
Just don't get close to bomb explosions
---
Hmm there are clear difference s between the sub 25 yr old gamers and the 30+ crowd....
---
It's not about stifling word choice, it's about maturity
---
If enough people say it, perhaps there is truth to it? 
---
Ratting Anoms in null is better yeh. 
---
You can do it in a cruiser hull as well. Vexor Navy issue is the most popular but theres other options.
---
What is the system j number ?
---
I was born a non verbal autistic, i almost didn't get a chance to communicate with the world around me. So i elect not to chastise others for how they chose to communicate.
---
Seconded. Wormhole corps tend to be a bit more mature but Of Sound Mind probably enforces that the most
---
Actually a nice video. The state of the game it shows is really sad though. 
---
A clear difference eh? Well then mr smarty pants maybe you could tell me which i fall under if its so fuckin' crystal clear?
---
Run the J tag through something like Anoik.is, it'll tell you what connects "should" or "shouldn't" be
---
One of the planets in the system of Yulai was renamed after him iirc.
---
so much hate for poor snuffie boy. much butthurt 
---
Cool
---
everything says it should be a C3 however inside are frontier barracks and whatnot. rand it through anoik.is also and it confirms it should be a c3.
---
Sounds like a shattered system to me. Shattered systems have sites some levels above their class, but cannot be populated with structures. 
---
I have a hunch its a shattered.
---
It predates meme and the internet....
---
That said, the dude also died with a lit of skill books.

Wait, oh youre just bullshittin again to look good...got it ;)

was my first guess corp im in uses Tripwire so im not entirely sure how to tell but thats the only thing i could think of as well.

are we not highlighting the correctness of the statement?

That &gt;6s align. Hope you get your investment back before stumbling into a halfway competent gate camp, though those are hella rare these days in my experience.
---
And I wouldn't have it any other way. 
---
I have always been a fun of self control rather than forcing the issue. You seem involved in the game, are you sure you won't regret wasting your isk? Are you sure you won't come back one day and will need to grind back for your needs? Wouldn't it be better to sell all you have, buy something useful that hopefully won't lose value (like a basket of T2 moon goo) and then go take that nice break? You can always come back and do the isk wasting 1 year from now when you are SURE you don't care and won't care for the game?

Can confirm this yourself by seeing if there are 0 moons.
---
100% feel like an idiot cause i checked on there and didnt see the shattered info on it.
---
Internet confirms it‚Äôs shattered
---
It says, where is the library?
---
I am pretty sure I had a dream (nightmare) about my Tengu getting caught in lowsec BEFORE it happened.
---
You could skill the alt into a recon and have that logged off. They might not combat scan if nothing is on dscan.

I got you bro.

I checked for planets didnt realise it was moons that you had to look for. Got my eve 101 today XD.
---
didn't repeat himself...oh wait
---
You can do a few things. Long-range sniping Rokhs is what NC. did and it worked. PL has tried smartbombing machariels, and that also could have worked. Once you pick off enough command destroyers, the fleet loses its mobility and it can't stay on grid. Hell, HK got close with Munnins, if they hadn't fucked up the warp in. 
---
Any long-range comp that can hit the CDs. 
---
We will never see Weimar Republic/Zimbabwe levels of hyper inflation unless CCP starts doing something super dramatic to inject new ISK into the game. This seems unlikely and CCP have no history of doing so.
---
Hyperinflation is the product of government central banks going crazy and printing money. As far as I can tell ISK creation is limited by the need to actually take a ship out there and kill rats.
---
Could have let us in to show you some of the counters :D
---
So you‚Äôre too stupid/lazy to counter a boosh comp so you want CCP to remove it? 
---
Wow
---
you first, why the hell do you care at all
---
you should be thankful for my position on the matter if anything
---
How do people manage 30 accounts at once? Holy...
---
What is this Killboard tool? It looks amazing! 
---
I keep them for that one time when I HAVE to have that skill NOW! Not happening often, but it does from time to time... and no, injectors will never be something I will use (inefficient and expensive and slightly against the spirit of the game, though that would probably not really stop me :D).
---
So basically a legacy shitfit :)
---
Are pirate bounties the same or do they scale with ISK inflation?
---
For example, are the bounties for the first wave of battleships in a Haven the same as they were 5 or 10 years ago, or are they constantly changing?
---
üòÇ touche
---
Good logi work!
---
Okay, cool. Had worked on an idea to try and counter these, so I'm beating around the right bushes at least. Cheers. 
---
Why not mention that they actually didn't fight for that timer? And you actually think you cant kill a fortizar when outnumbering hostiles 2:1? the damage cap is so low that a single dread could pause it forever. Any other doctrine could have killed that fortizar (probably way easier tbh). Should have let us in to show you some counters :(
---
You'll understand when ur older young'un. Til then don't trouble yourself too much about it and get off my lawn.
---
No, simply rorquals are so "demanding" - to recall drones you just need to change client 30times and manually press recall drone.     
---
You can automate this pretty easily. 
---
There it is. The self importance of someone that is more than just a line member. "You should be thankful!!"
---
Nobody cares about your input on the subject. If it quacks like a duck, smells like a duck, it is probably more than just a line member. 
---
I'm glad you agree with our thoughts on that matter, and hope that you will vote for CSM to further help us to propagate this fact.
---
&gt; Like, we're not horrible

I just turned 30 this year which is why i wanted to challenge your hilariously specific scale.
---
... to the very guys who evicted them lol
---
&gt; It feels so sluggish coming from a sub 2s astero :/
---
Yeah I tried probably the same you are trying. After flying a nano Astero I though to upgrade to a explo Tengu, because I thought nullification and higher damage would be fucking awesome. Went back to my trusty Astero after I realized that the much lower sensor strength makes it borderline impossible to catch other explores and nullification isn't that much of an advantage if you have otherwise high agility/acceleration, plus gatecamps seems to fall out of popularity nowadays. Though, stay away from GE-8JV, Brave maybe has a bad rep, but the fuckers camping that system are quite decent in catching even slippery pray.
---
ah yes, the only people who can be self-important are also leaders
---
that's the dumbest thing i've heard today and i just got done listening to the meat show
---
Must be triglavians
---
just equip more Hull Impact Mitigation Module IIs, you'll be fine.
---
In H-5 there were SEVERAL other fleets helping the ravens to just keep the dps up. Just because someone got their titans around they shouldnt win by default.
---
EvE University has a portion of everything, as I understand it, but you could also check out Brave newbies, BrandNewBros, KarmaFleet or Pandemic Horde, the four that I mentioned as the latter are in null sec mainly, but I think you could be able to do some Exploring in each of them, and I belive some of them has a WormHole sig/interest group aswell, if that is what get's you going.     
---
Just get in there, explore some corporation's and settle with the one that suits your likings/needs/comfort, something like that.     
---
Fly safe and best of luck!

&gt;I'm not arguing here that we should remove tethering as a mechanic, 
---
You actually are by posting this.  Otherwise what the point of your question?
---
But the answer is because docking games are shit.
---
flycatcher is the best dictor to fly solo in null. Sabre is for shield fleets
---
&gt; I'm just playing Devil's Advocate.
---
&gt; *gives no reasoning just forwards the question*
---
that's not how it works
---
&gt;Otherwise what the point of your question?
---
As I say, to play devil's advocate. I'm not going to seriously rail against tethering as a terrible mechanic that needs removal, I'm just curious what reasons the game has for it as a mechanic.
---
Like bumped out of position bad, didn't track where enemy directional headings were bad, or 180 degrees from where it should be bad?
---
You sound like part of the 30- crowd instead of the 30+ crowd if you know what I mean

I did cap escalations years ago but when the drifters were introduced it wasn't optimal for me anymore

But if you can afford to sub accounts rather than make isk for plex then you can spend more time with your wife? Admittedly I only sub a handful of accounts, but they make enough isk to mean that I don‚Äôt have to grind to support my pvp habits.

from what I've seen the popular strat is to blitz with carriers,  only certain missions are blitzable so you need pulling alts with high faction standings to be able to cherry pick the good missions. 
---
Then Rattlesnake is also popular due to the passive tank and most lv5s having neut towers.  Can also do the gated missions that carriers can't get into. 
---
What do you mean by IVs? Is that the scan difficulty of the site? They always seem to give me good loot.
---
CCP has injected plex into the market several times. The first time they did it was somewhere between 2012/2013, and that was confirmed by several employees at the time. There was supposed instances in 2016 where they did the same thing. 
---
XD I was building a stealth bomber for exploring and flying in dangerous area's just to sight see a bit XD  I am very happy to know it will work out thanks guys.

One of two essential Spanish phrases. The reason being, if you are ever stranded in a Spanish speaking area ask for the library. In every library there will at least be a bible in multiple languages. Or a translation book for languages.
---
The other phrase. Yo quiero cervesas. I want beer. Because if you can't find a library to stumble through language translation you can at least get drunk.
---
Damn, that seems very plausible. I was doing the Sisters of Eve epic arc, so I was jumping around a lot. May have hit Ctrl+D at some point instead of D.
---
I guess you exclude them when you want to make brag posts about isk ratios?

Good luck timing that one old man.

Unpopular opinion, it‚Äôs highly likely they‚Äôll end up a a lame power creep addition

wow i was in GC back on Scalding Pass time....remeber having good old draekes fights with dark side and cursed alliance...and eviction by pl goonz

Triglavian ADC ramps up resists &gt;:)

i was able to run 16 clients on a fx6300 oc to 4,5 ghz. bottleneck is usually always ram or the slow harddisk
---
If a game with stressful scenarios does not show up in a single dream it'd be weird. I was talking about multiple consecutive dreams, night after night.
---
Rip your Tengu though
---
Why did you not "stagger" your reps? and why did you switch ALL reps to the Oneiros from the Zealot that died(At about 5:27) moments after you swiched all reps?
---
Been a very long time since I have seen large rigs on a cap...wow

1. I already did my share of dunking for the week so TVFM.
---
2. I hate WHs due to carpal syndrome resulting from scanning. Quite literally.
---
3. The people I wanna play with are not logged in on weekend.
---
4. So you log on for weekend and do a couple dunks huh ? Just like me. While a couple hundred are needed. GFL with that and I stand by what I said. Scale is everything.
---
Or your fighting on a station undock and a neutral ship body blocks a round meant for the enemy. 
---
Whats the problem with having a subcap doctrine/concept that doesnt get murdered by caps by default?
---
&gt;if we need two bosons to hit, we drop 12 Titans, and it sometimes works. 
---
hmmmmmmmmmmm

La biblioteca est kaput

fakest of news good sir
---
Calm down I'm not slapping the food from your mouth. 
---
The guy suggested fighters as a counter, we were pointing out why it doesn't work, not claiming it should have worked.
---
corax might be a better option fix some what like a kestrel 
---
whenever anyone talks about formations, I am always reminded of Torfi nerding out at fanfest ~2011 about giving them to us
---
Lul t1 triglavian ships are already power creep enough
---
T2 versions would probably have the same maximum DPS but much better application or survivability depending on how CCP design them
---
He's making a joke that the group NC. is always docked in station 
---
Oh, there are planets, they are all shattered.

I wonder if the Master Race's financial sector will need another Amarrian Bailout this year.

Not as unpopular as you might think. Game needs sub caps that punch vastly above their weight due to cap/sub cap imbalance. Even the upcoming nerfs are going to be just a fraction of what is needed to bring things down to where they need to be. 
---
So if that's unpopular then I'll give you another. Bring all the sub - caps on par with Trig ships. All BSes in the game startign from your basic T1s should be capable of 3k DPS while @ perfectly stable cap and decent tank, bump the Leshak up even more. More actually, at least some, like marauders, possibly few others should have XL weapons.
---
Put all sub caps in line with caps / supers with regards to EHP, EWAR resistances, etc. Instead of these stupid fucking cliffs that no one can figure out what to do with now cause on one hand people that get fed up with this shit are quitting the game, on the otehr hand krabs and cap pilots are screaming "but muh ticks!" and all that shit.
---
Krabs are goin down either way though, cause either they get nerfed, like really nerfed, not the joke that is coming, or they make more people quit thus diminishing their own multiboxing plex supply further and they will simply price themselves out of their own shit if they continue. Its that simple.
---
How is this for unpopular ?

---
how can I play it if it's not a game?
---
oh look, a super that costs as much as supers used to cost 
---
CCP add more hp/resists and next we see people complaining that an entire fleet can't kill a single inhib under reps...
---
Well I mean fighters are just bigger drones, so lets make it easier to defang them. Next.
---
except good luck getting all the materials required to make a decently sized fleet full of them in order for them to actually mean anything but a fancy ship in smallgang pvp that no one gives a shit about except those few that still do it.
---
Well imagine how powerful a cyno is if you think about it. So you are saying that a buff to inhib will make it unkillable while a rorqual can light a cyno and go invulnerable for 6 minutes? Think about the balance betweek cyno and inhib. And you will see that a slight buff in hp and ressists is nothing comapred to the cyno itself. 
---
That is the longest fucking killmail I have ever read in my entire life

Petition to immortalize all the fucks I give, oh shit, there aren't any...

Best is to simply ask, but be aware, don't treat these as "must be" absolute, treat them more like guides to be adjusted to your liking.

There are large guides for some content such as Burners, Abyssals, certain DED sites, etc. You can find them on those forums, they are continually updated so start reading from the end before you ask anything, cause more often then not you'll find it already posted.

made me laugh have my updoot

Frat gettin raped
---
Haven't read this sub in a while. Post checks out.
---
Causation does not equal to correlation. Dropping player numbers may simply be people not logging into their alts after plex price increased, and general dissatisfaction has always been there. Either way, without proof nothing can be proved conclusively
---
I'll second this
---
Goons are literally ruining the games and CCP should ban them because they play the game.
---
Did they change the Loki model??
---
ur so dumb
---
i never said there was proof ya fucking mong
---
you've been nothing but strawmanning and esling here
---
Good stuff, Im sure, but im NOT watching 18 minutes of moving alts around and lighting cynos. Congrats on the succesful move tho
---
Before Tags4Sec, I belt-ratted in lowsec with a Talos. It cleared it pretty quickly. Wouldn't work against officers n shit, though.
---
What stops them taking more dessies and making that 75-300km? It doesn't stop the fleets getting so big either
---
Even my solution doesn't work that well because even with 7/8, 49/64 of their fleet they're sill going to do enough damage to destroy the structure
---
Maybe the answer is to just form up better and htfu :(

Back in the day we had remote repairs on the motherships. We also had one rig size. This rig setup is from those days, and that pilot may not have been the first owner of this old nyx.
