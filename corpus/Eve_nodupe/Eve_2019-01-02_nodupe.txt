Damn, that’s a scary fleet. Gf
---
---
---
Yeah, I bought this ligature when it was far cheaper. Only one is okay though when you get used to it, you can leave useful items in the puzzle.
---

---
The strength is a bit misleading; on the Ligature (and I assume on the Calvicula too) you get skills bonuses from data *and* relic skills, so the actual strength and coherence ends up being pretty high. I get a strength of 30 when it's equipped.
---
I guess the scary wormhole people got their own back https://zkillboard.com/related/31001967/201806052000/
---
Pretty much
---
The beans couldn't take Brave let alone Goons or TEST.
---
Is it really so hard to accept that your alliance is a toxic shitpit, run by toxic screelords, who are so far up their own ass that they can no longer communicate with the outside world in a normal fashion? Because it's pretty obvious to everyone in third person.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I haven't play this game for awhile. Did Pearl Abyss changed EVE at all so far?
---
yeah, put a hard cap of 50 people per alliance
---
It means they don't know how to do it.  
---
All the imaginative directors left. re: Seagull. Immediate downward swing in quality once upper management stepped into leadership roles
---
It's like... I've seen this some place before. Its strangely familiar.
---
Oh god, we're the baddies.
---
On the fourth attempt people will learn.
---
Worst part from our end, i mean besides getting our shit pushed in (which always sucks), we also had a slyce rorq tackled and and inhib online when one of our rorqs called that they had been tackled, so we had to leave it. Think our indy wing learnt a hard lesson about frig holes today.
---
If you're going to complain about text that you see posted too often, the least you could do is get the text right.
---
We’ll get an AAR up from our side hopefully soonish! 
---
I will note that when those fabulously quotable lines were uttered, there were 60ish duders mauling the rorqs, so while utterly wrong in retrospect, it wasn’t unreasonable at the time.
---
true story
---
Pospy has to batphone everyone for a fight, shocker.
---
God jspace is so cancerous these days.
---
Spectre Fleet's website is missing fleets? Am I dumb. They're still a thing right? What other big NPSI fleets are active.
---
I mean low sec should be a route to null sec, a faction warfare area, or a shorter route to a trade hub vs high sec, that's really low secs only niche atm.
---
Never get tired. It was never our fault Eve has so many weak minded people reading local. 
---
The problem is that they know it doesn't work, and don't appear to be fixing it.  
---
I mean there is a ton of reasons why that wouldnt work, but i know what you mean.
---
Only thing that would actually make that happen is less in game and RL greed and putting eve first for long term health of the game.
---
But people are too short sighted for that.
---
I would need to come from some game mechanic. But that wont and really shouldn't happen in a sandbox.
---
I predict this post is going to age well. Just like every time someone makes this post. 
---
I never said anything about an alliance..... small corp in big alliance is better than big corp in big alliance. Horde is a massive corp and you get very little help unless you beg in discord. Probably 30% of horde is alts for other people anyway.
---
So who paid for it? Goons?
---
Insert &lt;Not sure if serious joker meme here&gt;
---
Haha, we (slyce) we're 2j out with a 90 man muninn fleet. When yall just left, we were all like "What, they're deagressing?"
---
They're horrible at keeping it upto date. If you join the chat channel ingame it has everything listed in the MOTD.
---
I think this is the one Thing even ccp realized with nerfing anom respawn.
---
They are Just waaay to slow doing it.
---
Force people to spread Out to make space feel alive again. Give defenders a reasone to Gate Camp again instead of Just Reading Intel, burning a ceptor there and dropping a super.
---
yes rorquals really force people to clump up, both for safety in using them and firepower to kill them
---
TIL Dead Terrorist still exist. 
---
You should re-examine your prejudices. Your disparagement of line members and sweeping assumption about botting policy reflect poorly on you. No matter where you go, you will be ordinary until you find a way to distinguish yourself, and at least in a large coalition there will be plenty of opportunity to do so. Goons are no more tolerant of botters than anyone else—get found doing it and you're blacklisted.
---
This ignores the fact that the largest alliance in the game, Goonswarm Federation, has confined itself to a single region for nine years.
---
I don't know if it is worth while to build. They are a very common drop from the event rats.
---
What topsy turvy upside down world is this? Throw the newbros to the human meatgrinder of Horde, so they can stumble out 6 months later and bitch about the experience for the rest of their EVE career.
---
no
---
No group is capable of unseating gons. The reason you are comfortable with this is because you are gons. The system favours you so you favour the system.
---
POS are the old Racial Control Towers you launched next to moons that are being phased out and aren't relevant anymore. Upwell is just an RP name for the new structures which in highsec are Citadels for pew (Astrahaus, Fortizar, Keepstar), Refineries for mining (Tatara and Athanor) and Engineering complexes for research and that (Raitaru, Azbel, Sotiyo) all of which have asset safety.
---
I can buy this and use the code on a new account in 5 weeks right?
---
Standings and ACLs make this do nothing but increase the tedium for two people per organization. If CCP adds alliance standings and ACLs via ESI, then it drops to zero.
---
Yeah I kinda miss the days when goons kept their bad post in helldump

Good fight, was an expensive evening for for us, but we had fun, and that's what this game is all about.
---
What rats do you use your Legion against? Thought everything suspectible to lasers TDed you to fuck and back?
---
Actually, we do... That's how we get CCP to show their bosses that this deserves time and effort
---
No one in the history of game has, or ever will, put the health of the game before their own interests. Saying otherwise is one of the most naive things I've heard.
---
Wasn't sure I wanted to watch until I heard my favorite Aphex Twin song. Nice vid mang.
---
On the other hand, we didn't have to kill all that much to ensure we'd be isk positive, we could always run away, and I'm pretty sure most of us came in at the same time so I think you are underestimating how many of us were there at that point.  Smack talking is only smart if you can actually back it up, otherwise you end up looking like, well, that. 
---
nidia is a fuckin asshole. 
---
I know....its almost like i said EXACTLY that.
---
However, the tone of your post is telling people that they should. They won't. Ever.
---
Iirc we were practicing our finesse control comp and it wasn't working well. We weren't optimistic we could beat PL, which was chief concern before points. So we focused on how we could at least buck expectations and deliver a win. Even if we couldn't advance it would be a moral high note. So that's where we focused energy of theory.
---
We discussed ideas about a triple sleip base and how we could get the most dps to wipe floor with any big things, very fast. Ben and Brent both really loved the sleip. It was facemelt dps, and huge self tank, with cap independent guns. Good starting platform. 
---
I noted AF were only 4pt, and we discussed quickly on TS, while putting together the dumbest high dps enyo fit, and then clocked in our fleet dps at some crazy number. Ishkur got close to enyo, so it was secondary pref for ship. Scimmy did not work well with either, but we didn't have high hopes of scimitar staying on field, so we made scimitar a bit more nano/bait, knowing it may buy us time to do our thing while they focused on burning it. The theory was dumb and fast, but pretty ballsy, and exact opposite of what we'd been practicing most of the time.
---
Our practice partner was groon iirc. We ran that comp in only 2 matches and it performed great.
---
I remember I was flying sleip, and when we landed on field i think we saw the local chat counting up everything, and the 8 point under emerged. I was pretty surprised, but I think everyone else was too. Like "oh fuck we had 8 more points to use?!". In my mind I was thinking how many harder ships we could've up shipped to for that extra. 
---
Too late now. It worked out way better that we didn't. 
---
Such a fun, awesome upset. As you say, it'll stay with me for years.
---
Also we are in similar stitch to you nowadays. Based in Covryn / Stacmon, striking out from there. I'll be sure to roam around your way to generate content :)

But then that leaves the question of why aren't rent prices in freefall? If a corp/alliance can't Rorqual mine or Super rat, then they can only pay so much in rent. Even 100mill isk in rent for a system beats zero. Then more people move in, the space becomes populated, content, you raise the prices, etc.

For someone brand new starting out, I'd probably recommend Caldari. Shield tanking is very easy to manage, since half the work happens automatically anyway. And missiles are a simple weapon system as well.
---
I'd also recommend you join the corporation Eve University. They are excellent for teaching new folks how to play.

As for your second question it's just bombers bar I know off.

---
That's what CCP Seagull pushed when she was in charge, but after the first few "mini" releases, they went back to full scale releases, I assume under pressure.
---
They probably don't know why it doesn't work and are just sitting thinking 'what the fuck' 
---
So why is it an issue now, and it wasn't back when Dominion was released ten years ago? I don't think anomaly mechanics are the problem.
---
Remy get out of the titan sir, you aren't allowed to drive after the PUBG incidents.

It was a great battle.
---
Are there any null regions, like Providence was, where neutrals can live and not be shot on sight?
---
Gallente for VNI. 
---
And haulers?
---
Really? Well, I don't like managed Ammunition and I like more Amarr designs more, seems like a win-win for me.
---
So... Amarr?
---
Duh, it's cheaper to do it yourself.
---
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind and might apply to the corporation. :)
---
dt still exists????
---
Providence is still NRDS, iirc
---
They are all good, so yeah.
---
like whats the point of 26 virus strength...
---
Amarr is the right choice. 
---
Isn't this entire thread about how empty space is? Seems like there's never been a better time for these mythical smaller sov owning entities to appear. Shit, we're doing those legendary snipes a service by packing into one corner of the map.
---
Good old times where local was still working 
---
Boo join goons
---
VNI?
---
Haulers?
---
Sorry, bit new here.
---
Ya. But that is still exactly what i said. You are repeating it as if it hasnt been said.
---
Its not a problem. Just pointing it out in response.
---
If someone had said that 2 years ago when we were in the North I would have agreed with you then too.  Look how wrong that was.
---
I think this is the way it should have been from the start, Technetium was great and worked well for driving content.  But yeh, now we have our little pocket of New Eden and we never need to go anywhere else for anything because why bother?  CCP let us bed in and get comfy by providing literally everything we need within 1 region.  Maybe if we had to get off our asses and leave Delve for anything ever the game might play out a little differently.   Too late to do anything about it now though.  Ho hum.
---
I agree. They should be out trying. People are just to scared to lose in our modern version of eve.
---
Pixels BB.
---
New to the game could some explain what this means?
---
I see, thanks! ;D
---
I'm just going off my (imperfect) recollection of events and the numbers of involved parties on our first few losses (71/44/61 respectively, then add a few for the dictors tasked with keeping the Rorqs tackled). You can rest assured that the Rorq pilot is aware of how foolish he looks after the dust settled, and has acquired a healthy paranoia about frig holes to boot ;)
---
VNI = Vexor Navy Issue

---
Ship of choice if you join nullsec corp and start ratting.
---
They might need to just switch highsec back to the old system.  The new one is really nice for null, because it takes a lot of strain off big fights.

What about the new respawn nerfs? You need ~3 heavens to chain in a super

He sees a word and responds to that word. Getting him to read the whole post would be too much to process.
---
its hard do to.
---
basically test or goons or pl or some large block will shoot you to death. then those who are in your alliance will just move to goons or test or one of their "blue" alliances because its simply much safer to rat and mine and use your "supersor big ships". I would say that even provi loses people to this issue as well, as we aren't big enough to go tow to tow with test or goons or nc etc. i suppose if we were deeper into 0.0 or in a different region like goons with only certain areas people could jump "into" us , it could be different. but again its mostly about who you are "blue" too.
---
 idk what kind of "strong" independent alliance out there would be able to hold anything unless they were allowed to by someone else. Its simply much easier to be "blue" to goons or test or nc or another larger force if your a smaller alliance, because then you atleast have someone to help you out. but idk even on a lesser extent you basically end up being blue to surviving because if not its a hard life. provi systems are usually pretty busy with hotile activites, (not complaining quite contrary to that) but it does make living in providence hard compared to some other places. while we have semi-decent relations with our neighbors (for the most part besides a few auz dudes) we only really have "sov" becuase we actually generally provide a source of content that generally is good for thier own pvpers. I don't know / think we/ i am under a different illusion from that. if larger forces wanted to take provi they would eventually be able to (see pl invasion last year). 
---
I would say the advent of timezone tanking with structrures and adms "does" help the smaller groups espicially if they are outside the timezone of others, we have some issues with some people who are red to us, and as thier us/auz tends to be stronger than ours, we have had/are having issues with them. so, maybe you just need to be around in a tz they aren't active in, but that being said its hard if you have a 20000 pilot alliance to not have "some" coverage in every tz. not sure what the solution and or what the ideal goal is.
---
Only 30%?
---
100mn hics, and have multiple hics that can take turns dropping point to get reps. You'll be perfectly fine. They are extremely useful when used by skilled pilots, it's one of those ships that really depend on pilot skill and not SP.
---
The bubbles are super useful how they are, if the'res one thing I would change would be to add a script that makes a small bubble. You will often see hics have multiple bubbles on their high slots of varying meta/faction. Having the meta one that has a small bubble is great to keep up at first, yet when a fleet lands on the end, you can switch to the faction bubble and lock some of them in. While the max size difference of bubbles you can get is 6.25km (T1M0 vs True Sansha) you're able to pick off targets, yet it's a small window of opportunity.
---
And I don't know what kind of mallers you fly, but those can be very tanky when fitted properly.
---
Providence only. 
---
We will see in 6 months or so, but from what I can tell so far, it won't have much/any of an impact. Maybe larger alliances will need 3 constellations. But I doubt it.
---
I hope to see you back there in qff :D 
---
every time I've looked recently its just been a blank window, for whatever reason it seems to be working today. 
---
Oh, I see, so Gallente is the right choice to start?

---
Isn't input broadcasting/macros supposed to be banned?
---
They're the lower caste of society, the alliances usually have set Crabbing times off of usual hours to prevent people from seeing renters as it tarnishes the reputation.
---
When I see renters out during regular hours there's usually orders to shoot-to-kill, they obviously were not obeying their masters, which of course need to keep them on a tighter chain. The alliance leaders usually praise me and send me a supply of mountain dew and doritos for my valiant efforts. There's a point system I'm currently accumulating and im 27 renter kills away from being hand fed chicken tendies from mittens himself, with his wizard hat of course.
---
What do you think is the issue then? I get that you are a loyal goon, and you're not going to admit that the goon playstyle is cancerous to the health of our game. What do you honestly think is a fair way to handle the dwindling population issue? Ride it until the brakes fall off?
---
Two wasn't enough before, so it isn't that big of an impact on me personally. I always do sanctum - sanctum - haven - repeat. The sanctum's always back up by the time I finish the haven
---
If its like any indy wing/care bear wing i've seen, I doubt the lesson is actually learned until they've whelped harder with 10 rorqs.
---
No it's not a good time because you invest time and resources into getting the sov and then your big neighbors decide to evict you and drop titans cuz they want 'content'. You can do guerrilla SOV warfare but you will never keep that space as long as your structures are always in dander of getting dropped by titans. Been there :(
---
&gt; Is it really so hard to accept that your alliance is a toxic shitpit, run by toxic screelords, who are so far up their own ass that they can no longer communicate with the outside world in a normal fashion?
---
I mean that still puts them above test and goons so hey, silver linings. I'm pretty sure that's a flairbait tho
---
Yes it is. This guy uses very clever window placement, you can watch his stream. 
---
Only niche I can see for mods like this and zeugma is saving a midslot on stratios to do both explo and PvP without refit. But for normal exploration it's just worse than the t2, which you should have anyway if you're serious about exploration.
---
Link please?

Is there any chance there’s a 3D model of this? Kinda want to 3D print it.

---
Are they related? Test Alliance Best Alliance (EVE) &amp; Test Squadron Best Squadron (Star Citizen) - just curious....
---
There are profession agents that will give you missions . it is set up for you to learn the various directions you can go in eve. Wile gaining the skills knowledge and basic equipment to do those things like exploration, mining, running combat missions exct.
---
Okay. How is that any different than any other time in the game's history? Shit, it used to be worse back when you could shove any kind of ship, even other titans, through a titan's bridge and no one took any kind of fatigue.

This isn't the eve online forums.

---
Clarion Call is an amazing series about happenings of the olden days. https://youtu.be/XrYe_4vHzgE?t=60
---
It's actually quite the opposite -- CCP would love for there to be ten or twenty Goonswarms. Well, probably not led by the same sort of dude, but groups of our size and our general approach to Eve -- occupying and investing in space as the primary goal, rather than the way that most folks lionize: merely exploiting it for wealth while the alliance itself stays offline waiting for pings. You're falling for classic correlation = causation here.
---
We (CENTI) tried, or at least sort of tried. We attacked a small coalition that was Legacy-aligned, kicked them out, took the good parts of their space for ourselves, let PL stage in one of our systems for the southern war, then moved out because we were in direct bridge range of the UALX Keepstar, there's no reason to want to live so close to hostiles.
---
Then we moved to Etherium Reach to grab some space so we could safely krab and chill after six months of near-constant fighting, only to get skill urself parking themselves nearly on top of us, so we left from there as well. Now we're just crashing on Red Alliance's couch because apparently you need to be at least this big (in a coalition) to hold sov in current-day EVE.
---
We might go back to do some more pvp in the future though, we just gotta get our leadership interested in EVE again :|
---
Oh damn, that's beautiful! lol
---
Not enough people are saying this. You can try everything as alpha and in my opinion you should have something in particular that makes you want to go Omega
---
tldr for people who dont understand whats going on.
---
someone got mad no FCs were killing the structures (astras) and complained in standing.
---
and basically the response was "no ones stopping you, wanna kill it, form a fleet and do it, you dont need a strat op or senior fc"
---
but right now, not really bothering with the structures as they so easy to replace that its just not worth the time.  kill one and they place another, and you wasted hours going through its timers.
---
so citadels in oij, or heck. bwf.  unless we see alot of activity coming from them thats a threat, not worth the effort.   
---
heck as of right now, the only thing worth attacking is the faction fort, but we need numbers as we know they'll form a response for it. so we gotta wait till holidays form up.
---
PL never farmed us. Unless you count the time when they and NC burnt provi
---
I agree that skill injectors have allowed the "wrong" people access to power. Power should be collected by sniping away all people with the will to perform laborious ISK grinding over years from every organization and concentrating them into yours, while practicing a form of gameplay that minimizes asset exposure at all costs.
---
isnt this asked every single gank?
---
There isn't much reason to leave the safety of the pack even if they greatly nerf anom respawns though. High sec alt isk, wh diving, infinite abyssals next to your keepstar, limited diminishing returns on PI, moon mining, etc.
---
....honestly sounds like you have not been in PH. There are 5 or 6 Newbean fleets every day, with the sole purpose to answer questions. 
---
Answers to questions is not a problem. That said most people find it hard to feel like they make a diffreance or find personal friends in big corps. 
---
When you start to feel lonly in a big corp it is time to leave for greener pastures.
---
except he isn't using macros
---
... if you refuse to do anything other than rock havens, that'd be a problem in populated systems. Except that there are like 1.5x more gas havens, some sanctums, and a bunch of forsaken hubs (which don't have as long of a respawn) and dozens of other sites in a decent truesec.
---
At most, imo, this nerf spreads goons out a little and makes everyone else utilize more than just rock havens (while maybe getting 10% lower ticks).
---
Test, Goons, same people right ;)
---
You still have to manage crystals but it's much less
---
Yeah, Horde is the best at running from a fight and docking up. Best retreat mechanics in the game! Sorry, couldn't resist. :-)
---
ISK is a means of progression now.
---
ISK translate directly into SP, which gives a huge incentive to farm ISK, which then leads to the "ah next milestone" Grind.
---
5 years ago you were flying T1 stuff for like half a year and we had fun doing so, knowing that we had to wait. The difference between buying a Toon and a couple injectors here and there is huge, as its a big upfront sum you had to grind with lower sp. Today you Grind a day and inject the next upgrade. 
---
Then you grind a week and get a Carrier, then you grind a month to inject a super, then you grind another month for your Titan. No one stops to just play with the skills they have anymore. 
---
Did also get local today did take 35 min but it Come up an running haven see jita local for 3 weeks or so.. 
---
Ashur says he loves you
---
Just kill capitals in a 20 man dessie down fleet lmao just get good
---
You don’t count Waffles/PL and the weeb wars?
---
So there's a Charon sitting outside a station in Amarr with an active killright. It's well off the station, but of course I'm skeptical that this is a scam or setup. Is this bait? What's the deal here?
---
It doesn't actually matter anymore which faction you start out as. That only determines which faction's space you start out in and a couple of your starting skills - you are free to train to use any faction's ships and weapons, and the differences in starting skills amount to less than a day's worth of training. So just pick whichever faction sounds coolest or whichever you can get a portrait you like most in.
---
This game is dying. I would milk it for everything as well.
---
TDSIN SMUG POSTING, WELCOME TO 2019
---
\&gt;  The situation turned quickly to the leshaks falling with their reps barely holding and such they started burning towards their citadel bleeding expensive battleships on the way upon reaching it they started their Jump drives but leaving 6-8 of their members behind which quickly died. 
---
this sentence makes me want to rip my eyes out
---
See, that wasn't my experience starting Eve in 2010. My first half year of playing ended up with me buying a combination tengu/thanatos character, with which I could run by myself the DED sites I'd been scanning down and selling to other players. I leapfrogged the fuck out of the game experience you're reminiscing about, and that was eight years ago.
---
what? horde will fight almost anything unless it’s going to be a complete feed lol
---
No kidding dude, those 30 pospy guys restricted to frigs and destroyers totally could have taken 20 shaks/nestors with 5 rorqs and home defense capitals... so risk-averse of them :thumbsup:

That's exactly what we have now...

you dont need isboxer to lock+press f1 a bunch of times tbh
---
That's just straight up impressive.
---
They should just create a full blown war between the factions, allow everyone to join a side, let supers in and turn hi-sec into a bloodbath. A suspect there would actually be a decent influx of resins just to have a battle royale to take Jita. Then the eve gate fixes itself and we all warp back to Earth leaving nothing but the smouldering ruins of the civilisation behind and a bunch of afk botters mining in a dead end system.
---
o7
---
I feel you. We are only small but we have fun doing the sov thing. Its about realizing that someone bigger then you will push the sandcastle over at some stage. Just dont put To much isk into the castle.
---
I will say though we have had great content out of it. And the big boys havent been to bloby to us latetly.  Bloby is just the way it is i relized that along time ago. Im just asking for not 500 vs 10. Which they have been cool enough to not do lately.
---
I see, I'd like to see some Gallente ships too eventually.
---
Nidia Masters, that guy is a mango

And with the ongoing situation in PB who knows how RMC will end up. Goons moving in everywhere.

sadly, no one resource will have all the history, and much of it is hard to find as its old.  but that makes it all the more valuable

Wingspan TT's got one heck of a story
---
Not really. People join Goonswarm Federation before they have their fortune, make their fortune inside our borders, then stay here. This is different from the past, where the players being stolen were coming from all over, and being stolen after they'd completed their ISK grind.
---
As other people are saying, there's no "right choice." Do what race you feel looks coolest, there's no downside to it.
---
The only right choice is what you want to do. 
---
what nerf is this? i'm a little out of the loop i think....
---
It was a fun fight on our end, I'm glad to see you guys aren't salty about the losses. 
---
Bob give'th and Bob take'th away.
---
But if you see us in chain and need help we're usually open to coming out to help. Just pop in our Diplo channel.
---
Jita Chat broken? Merry Christmas CCP, thank you for the belated gift. Can we keep it?
---
Incredibly fun to FC this, mad props to the dictors and Xafen for the scout. Cheers to everyone who picked up the phone and GF to DT.
---
The T1 destroyers used to be the ship of choice, but you will need some CPU lows probably.
---
up-voted, epic and hits a nerve at the same time. lol
---
Coming from the POSPY side of the engagement, your AAR is on point. Accurate and not salty. I think your number estimates were a bit low as TDSIN pointed out; we did mostly jump at the same time, and I think it was closer to 100 ships with a few stragglers following behind. We'd be happy to join you next time. GF.
---
gf
---
Jump fatigue does, not rorquals. That being said, the alternative is worse.
---
is it aligned to something? if it's sitting at 0 speed, I don't see how it could be bait, unless there's a whole fleet ready to help it out of trouble. 
---
But realistically that's not going to happen. There aren't enough people to have 5 or 6 Goonswarms. As it is now you guys have at least 25% of all people that log in daily ratting and mining in Delve. My ratting alt is in Goons so I see it. It is to the point where if you want to rat or mine you more than likely have at least an alt in Goons. Thats not good for Eve, it's just good for Goons. 
---
The true answer, unbiased, is two fold.
---
Mechanically, income structure, capital jump mechanics, and sov/structure mechanics, all now penalize the 'rent out the system' model.  A functional single system can only be properly exploited by coordination and logistics that would expand beyond a single system.
---
Because of the above, the active player presence needed to defend and achieve the profitable level of exploitation of a system(s) requires a motivation to do so.  If the space is rented, why would anyone go there?  If you can go there, you might want to help make it safe.
---
The second major factor is the new-era nullsec politics.  The major entities are opening their doors to a wider range of players, partly because of the above, and partly for other reasons like military power.  The exclusivity of many top groups (Goons = SA Vouch, PLNC. = Capital Req, etc) has been abandoned in recent times, and this is why you see very large player numbers in groups like Goons, TEST, Horde.  They opened their doors the widest and the earliest.
---
If it is easier than ever to get into a real corp, and the income is higher than ever, and the protection is better than ever, why would you pay to make money?
---
Site respawns were nerfed a bit.
---
When losing means 100s of hours of work is gone, then yes. People absolutely are not willing to risk that.
---
There seems to be a very loose relationship at best https://www.reddit.com/r/TestSquadron/comments/20j94w/is_test_squadron_of_any_relation_to_dreddittest/
---
it was hard for 30 confessors and a few deacons to break 5 Rorq's, shocked you don't know your DPS requirements to bash 1 RORQ let alone 5.
---
That's odd, given how many confirmed bots have been in Goon, and how there've been multiple public callouts of bots in Goon recently which resulted in the people calling them out getting kicked and told to not talk about bots. It's almost like someone's trying to spin a story.
---
 constructive criticism is appreciated.
---
 saying that ripping your eyes out is not constructive criticism 
---
Said sentence aswell as most other has received a mild refreshing.(which they needed)
---
If a system is rented out for 3B you only have to make 100 M each day to cover that. That’s like 3 or 4 havens.
---
Real easy to do with a small group of friends.
---
So the empty systems you see may well be rented out. The renters are just not online most of the time.
---
The solution, here, is to increase the number of people playing Eve.
---
Unrelated, but don't you feel a little hypocritical decrying the concentration of players into Goonswarm Federation while at the same time having a ratting alt in our space? Seems like you could practice what you preach.
---
Is it me or did no one actually get what you said?
---
Something something bio text length legacy code.
---
You won't get flamed for your lack of writing ability if you don't sound like you're failing Creative Writing 101.

Change your flair, yall left BL
---
Nope. You can't beat them join them. I've had that alt in goons since Fountain, why would I not take advantage of perfect ratting space and the ability to literally cyno in 50+ Titans and all the FAX needed to keep us alive? I will burn her someday, but not today.
---
Everybody knows no tank is complete until the permit slot is filled. The miner could have bought a lifetime supply of permits and become the 5th greatest New Order shareholder. He could have had it all. Instead he pointed his vessel toward Uedama, turned on autopilot and went AFK. RIP 8 billion ISK pod. Congratulations, Agent Kusion, for doing your part to keep highsec free of bot-aspirancy!
---
Fit a proper JF tank.  
---
Still fly through Uedama.  
---
He was only half retarded.
---
"Since Fountain?" You originally from TEST or something?
---
While donnie is highly competent, he is also highly afk
---
Because there is no reason to rent, if you can join easy peazy the Imperium. For a few paps a month you dont support the northern tyrannical Renting System !
---
Also you get, if you dont act stupid, fast help if your precious Krabbing/Ratting Mobile is tackled. While your elite Landlords in the North telling you to fuck off.
---
True, could've been a combination of time zones and strange circumstances (wh means I seldom visit the same place twice sequentially). But that sheet I pulled the price list from had 1/3 to a half of the systems listed as vacant. That and the locals advised me they were being farmed by nearby pvp groups.   
---
3B in corp taxes is easy to hit if you can rat in peace. Hence my wondering why not adjust the prices to suit the safety of the space, then if it gets safer - increase pricing. Rather than leave it vacant. 
---
Maybe.
---
Another one
---
Gf, WKEND is recruiting come play with us on the weekends, or anytime really. 
---
In the corp I joined recently (in goons) I'm the only active guy below 100m SP and probably the only one w/o a super/Titan yet. Being small SP in my former corporations I always felt the pressure to Inject so I could fly the doctrines that are tight fit and T2 guns and they constantly change. To inject you need isk and isk does not come easy when you just took a system and don't know for how long you will keep it. And in a no upgrades system you are not going to make isk.. there are no good sites to farm and mining is out of the question. When you take a system/constellation you 1st need to spend time and isk improving it before you will make money out of it. In Teneriffs we took some systems that basically only had belt rats and even 1 system that only had 2 belts (that took one determined guy 2 days of rat killing in those belts to get adm to 2 so shitty sites would spawn). All this time you are fighting which is fun but not making any isk and if you lose ships you better have a VISA. And the pressure on corp wallet is even higher when you have to anchor Fortizars etc for your small cap fleet and then you lose them to the big bored alliances near you while the corp wallet doesn't increase while you don't have good control over a few systems

I submitted a big report when I got my first BP for this. I don’t think I ever got an answer. 
---
TEST has the same setup. Why not go back to them?
---
If you want a taste of ‘true goons’ before the Mittani reign here’s a video of Darius Johnson from fanfest talking about the Band of Brothers era. https://youtu.be/NsC4Lx0ibTY
---
every nite i'm pufflin'
---
The bigger entities like to third party these 'little' conflicts cause of the overall stagnant content within their regions (and bluetral neighbors).
---
Wow, someone else that actually gets it. I've been saying "the mechanics that enable contemporary nullsec power aren't new at all" for a very long time, now. The only reason it's taken this long is because no one was able to put the pieces together until we did it.
---
That being said, outpost eggs weren't that expensive. I dropped an outpost in Deklein on my own dime, and it was only about 20b or so. Twice as expensive as a fortizar, but still quite affordable. It sure as hell is easier to drop a fortizar, though -- I had to stay up until an hour before downtime to drop my egg so it'd complete anchoring before downtime. That was probably the most stressful hour spent playing video games of my life where nothing happened.
---
Not even the same. There is literally NO RISK to ratting in certain spots in delve other than getting awoxed. And Goons sell shit way cheaper to other Goons. 
---
And it isn't the same in TEST? They have a lot of supers and FAX, too, last time I looked.
---
Next time, maybe he'll draw a picture so you understand better? :) 
---
So i could make a good argument but instead i am just going to do for the easiest part of your comment.
---
&gt; You won't get flamed for your lack of writing ability
---
Yeah right
---
This and Zeugma (and the first meta) benefit from both Arch and Hacking health bonus, so you get massive health couple that with the  blackglass implant and you can 1-2 shot every node with no worry.
---
can i have your stuff?
---
I'm an anti-botting hardliner and I can assure you that I would not stay if that were the case.
---
You're deflecting blame. TEST is just following the leader. And no, you can get supers and titans in Delve way cheaper than anywhere else if you know how. 
---
What? I genuinely don't know how things are in TEST land. I figured they'd have the same setup as we did, and it so would allow you to go back to them and get what you want without having to be a part of a group you think is strangling the life out of the game.
---
Also, what does cheaper prices on supers and titans have to do with anything? Moreover, how does acquiring supers and titans from Delve require you to rat and mine there? Money can be exchanged for goods and services.
---
Use dotlan, figure out the area.  Get a new account into that alliance, use that account to scout you an out cyno to a Freeport fort. Problem solved.  Or drop a stick and fuel it in system, login and warp to your new stick. 
---
What could possibly go wrong?
---
You got a couple of options here, 
---
1. You could join the locals and if you like them, stay for good
---
2. If that fails, start evacing 
---
3. if your accounts are omega, you could look for WH chains or start looking at a cyno chain
---
Lastly, welcome back
---
Your carrier has a jump drive. CCP has always said that jump capable ships won't be moved. Just move it out yourself.
---
They are Alpha stage was going to go back to omega until I noticed that.
---
Which ever has the better looking rookie ship. That's the only thing. When you die and rez in an NPC station with no ship (or need a rookie) which do you prefer the look of?
---
Insta warp Hecate.  Sub 1second warp. 450m3
---
I have been in PH, I don't just make up bull and spout it. I feel its good to get around and compare so I can make informed decisions. My comments are based on experiences in many corp with various toons. I will be hated, but goons are the better organized and the most helpful. I have been ion PH, Brave, Test, Goons, and a provi. I have also been in some wh corps. It could also be a TZ thing, hence me putting that in my statement.
---
If it's outside the docking radius and you tackle it right away you'll probably secure the kill, but you will no doubt discover that the following inequality is true:
---
    cost of charon + cost of plat. ins. &lt; cost of killright + insurance payout
---
He profits when you buy his killright even if he loses the Charon.
---
He's still there... and the kill right cost is near 800mil... so there's my answer. LOL... I misread that before as about 800,000 thousand
---
 Seems to me they’re letting the game die on purpose now
---
Been there done that
---
o7 Dude you guys rock!
---
I misread the last post, sorry. TEST space isn't nearly as safe as Delve. Nobody other than a few idiots are going to drop anything actually dangerous in Delve the way things stand right now. And if someone did and I got ganked I could replace it way faster in Delve because of how cheap things are. 
---
adding cheaper renters just adds more targets for roaming gangs and so encourages more disturbance for the expensive renters.
---
the ideal renter is a bot because it rats most hours of the day to pay high rents and docks up the moment anyone enters system. by never giving hunters any kills it discourages more hunters.
---
You're supposed to ask them to PM you. 
---
Renting ITYOOL 2019 is pretty much only the realm of bot havers.
---
Good Fight everyone!
---
Yeah the bigger groups leeching content from the Muppet Coalition. Snuff was always coming, Tri, NC., Darkness/SLYCE, they all leech from the produced content by wkend and CMC, now called the new Muppet Coalition! Ohh I love that name, an Old Sch00l guy gave it to us, and honestly it's great! &lt;3 it! He said that we have as many different alliances and corps as the colors of the Muppets :) Yeah that's FW and especially CalMil, lots of small groups all working together as the Caldari Militia Coalition short CMC.
---
The bomb runs of conifers were fantastic!
---
Thank you everyone, all the CMC members who showed up, WKends and especially also Wolf who is always leading us in the bigger fights. And, our "enemies" the EWOKs also deserve a special thanks for keep undocking and fighting us. I'm sure this is not over, and a lot of brawls between the Muppets and the EWOKs are to be coming up soon!
---
Best Regards,

---
Oh hey, I used to fly through that system on freighter guard all the time!
---
Somewhere between Deklein and Lonetrek on that route there is a SUPER long warp, I think they have safes in the middle because some ships can make it. Is it still there? It’s been a decade.
---
You sure they know that? Seems to be more responses to what gets a lot of traction on reddit vs forums
---
By the time any of this matters to you, you will easily be able to cross train.
---
even if you don't actually join E-UNI they have public chat channel to answer questions and their out of game wiki pages are an excellent source of information.
---
as for your original question - race only affects your avatars looks, some of your starting skills, and your high sec school station (spawn location). all races can cross train into other races ships and weapons. 
---
some outdated Alpha guides may still state you are race locked but this was changed a year or so ago.
---
Does that mean I can't take my Astero there and hunt other explorers even if I don't personally live there?  Who enforces that?
---
I think there is a system that is around a 200 AU warp, it's horrible. 
---
How safe is a structure that is being deployed in highsec? Assuming my corp is in no wars would it be 100% safe since wars take 24 hours to start? Of course i'm only talking about the deployment, I know what comes next.
---
So because life is hard and ccp wont spoon feed you its time to cry on reddit
---
disagree 
---
Sure dude, whatever. I dont know fuck all about horde, that wasnt the point I was trying to make. Insert whatever helpful corp you think is best. 
---
So I'm not sure what kind of engagement you are picturing, I assume you are talking about tackling a single super? Which yes, HICs can kind of do (although dictors still do a better job). However watching 20 HICs warp into a blop of supers/titans/dreads, and watching as the HAW titans/dread pop them like skittles. Their fit doesn't matter at that point, their 'skills' don't matter either. They just melt. 
---
You can do a huge amount of the game as Alpha. 
---
- battleship (and below) fleet fight doctrines
---
- T1 logistics
---
- market trading
---
- moon mining (though omega would increase yields)
---
- basic blueprint research and manufacturing
---
- VNI ratting
---
- destroyer salvaging behind corp ratters
---
- faction war farming
---
You can also easily make enough ISK as Alpha to fund PLEX to pay for Omega.
---
Do you own caps without cyno alts and/or no knowledge of how to move them?
---
If the answer is yes you should probably just stay unsubbed.
---
&gt; Snuff was always coming, Tri, NC., Darkness/SLYCE, they all leech from the produced content by wkend and CMC
---
Not true, at least not for tonight's activities. TRI are now apparently moving to [Anin](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Lonetrek/Anin#npc) and were trying to online a staging fort which was shut down by snuff&amp;co with NC coming to third party (or were with TRI, it's unclear). [Battle Report](https://br.inyour.space/?s=1439&amp;b=8415500&amp;e=1180&amp;t=GqpdaWaad) of skirmish - sides may be wrong in parts there's a lot of random stuff in there.
---
You can, but you will get put on the kill on sight list. Which basically means that you just have to fly normally 
---
Shes made it very clear shes a princess. She'll have ur head for this
---
If only I was space rich I wouldnt give a fuck about a carrier. But since I'm not then whelp... unless you my good sir would like to donate me a few billion so I can cry less and try harder... not everyone has been printing idk risk free in delve with their 20 rorqs.
---
Um, I was there in Horde in 2017 and we weren’t “kept” in a single constellation by anyone. In Pure Blind alone the RQH pocket became a center of carrier ratting and the Russians held down the area around KDV in their TZ. True enough that the 7RM main drag was a death zone but that’s pretty much the way Gobbins and the rest of the command staff wanted it. Fade’s main ratting center was the GME pocket but 8W was a good alternative and in fact was where I ran my Rattle (because it was safer there from droppers than it would’ve been anywhere in GME pocket). The one place in Fade that wasn’t used was O1Y and its environs and that was because our frenemies arrangement with GOTG made it another PVP thunderdome. In all of this remember that Horde never at any point emulated the Goon strategy of sealing its space — a strategic error, I’ve always thought, but within its context we put all our holdings to good use.
---
A point that goes unmentioned in prior comments is that time zones are a thing. Horde had a ton of people but standing fleet at any given time in both regions was about a steady 200 people. But it was 200 per region around the clock, US AU and EU, plus however many people were out mucking around in sigs. A Goon or TESTie would have to supply the equivalent numbers for their space. Point being, the big alliances are 24/7 operations and that dictates space usage as much as anything.
---
&gt;sabres and flycatchers in a ls fight
---
that's a nice meme
---
I like how you completely ignore the part where you could spend a few million on a shitfit frig to light a cyno to get you out and instead cry about how you're not space rich.
---
They day players started to refer to fights as 'content' was the day eve really started to die.
---
I brought this up awhile ago but the concept that killing rats makes anoms become more common is backwards.
---
"Uncivilized" space should have the most and best anoms
---
Not crying my friend just figured ccp  would be more helpful and would want another 6 accounts to resub instead of basically telling me to get fucked. I've seen them move stuck characters in caps and sups  before so idk.
---
So what system are you in? Maybe I’ll help you out for a small fee... if you’re near fountain. 
---
Heh wouldnt trust the help plus I'm stuck in terenifis in razor and Russian space.
---
I realized that and it's a shame we have yet another scam in Eve. I wish we could all sit down and figure out ways to prevent this kind of shit. It just diminishes what the game could be capable of. 
---
Nullsecers gonna nullsec.
---
INIT were never actually involved in the skirmish around the Fort, they either were in the area for the EWOK timer or simply arrived too late for the fight in Anin and just went to whore
---
X-70?
---
For $50, not $70
---
Makes you wonder what the management is currently wasting their developer resources on....
---
Desperate goonie that wants to roleplay spy meta, that is Nidia’s daily gag.
---
Trust me when I say this, if you were to trust any null Alliance. You would want to trust Initiative, but you are on other side of new eden where theirs litterally one guy every 10 jumps so why not just gate it, or go to your market find the closest fortizar with fuel and jump out somehow. 
---
it's been an entire year and they haven't been able to resolve these issues? god damn
---
lol
---
X-7OMU
---
“First, we have to beat Fraternity,” lol.
---
And here I thought they were going Full CCP and doing another new chat backend.
---
Frankly, in any business I was involved in, if there was this much of a publicly visible instability in our systems the entire engineering department would have been told to stop everything they were working on until it was resolved.
---
Bad PR costs $$$
---
fuck off retard
---
Infinite anomalies killed the game. 
---
Meh, while in BL I got the impression that Elo was pretty successful on deployments in terms of ganking a few rorqs and farming some response fleets.  IDK what else you were expecting BL to accomplish.  Did you think that they were going to single handedly evict gons from delve?  Is it a failure if BL didn't dent imperium's supercapital force?  Please...
---
I agree. I wonder if part of the issue is that most players never really encounter (or notice they encountered) the problem. 
---
Hourly, you mean.
---
The “don’t be a dick” rule rings pretty hollow every time Nidia shows up on comms.
---
We had a solid cap fleet between cva apoc cogg and yf. - 7- kinda refused to cooperate much. We did field 170 caps in my prime so yea. Provi wise we did good.  
---
Of course not. Full CCP mode is the new Beta Eve Launcher ^(TM) for the new Beta Eve Launcher ^(TM) that replaced the previous Eve Launcher:

---
Sniper DPS in a Mach is ass. Literally every other role or ship choice in an incursion fleet is more engaging.
---
Amarr are decent.  But they do play best in fleets over solo.  Not that that should be a problem, because you should join a corp very early in the game.
---
Join a corp or search for long term goals to work for. For me this is keeping my Job Queue full and getting a realiable income from Jita / Industry. That means I need Jita Standing to keep Taxes low. There I found my activity, I'm running missions.
---
Fuck off pl faggot  go die to goons some more fucktard
---
It's most definitely not incompetence, at least not at the developer level. But software like other systems need some love (maintenance, bug fixes, and upgrades). In short: human resources.
---
EveOnion is a satirical "news" site, that makes up silly explanations for things that happen in eve, in this case, Jita local being fritzy for a few days.
---
Actually worse than goon smug posting, I am amazed. 
---
Friendly cyno
---
&lt;3 u Lacco
---
thats where you're wrong kiddo. 
---
Both Bombers Bar and Spectre Fleet use logi. Ship type can vary quite a bit from fleet to fleet in Spectre.
---
Worst case;
---
Self destruct your carrier and start over again with the insurance money.
---
100mn and keep transversal, you need to coordinate with logi and the other hics, "X is taking damage, confirm point" "confirmed Y has point" "logi, reps on X". And yes, HICs are like skittles, a lot of people think they're really good. Those who think they're bad, might not be all that good themselves.
---
You cant be an F1 anchor type if you're flying a hic, let go of your skittles and manually pilot a bit to keep transversal, as much as the situation permits.
---
You should come to live in wormhole space btw
---
Our bombing run was mentioned a few times. We had three of them that were successful -- the Tornado run, a Gila run, and a Griffin run. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Since this was off TZ for us, C0NE+G0F1S formed 14 bombers betwee us and a pair of friends that tagged along. We split into a squad of 8 and a squad of 6. 
---
The run against the Tornado fleet was captured on a stream that OLDS had running. The fleet had been aligned so long that they had drifted out of the POS they were using for warp-ins. We also had a couple keen eyes in fleet that realized the wreck they were aligning toward. Our smaller squad warped next to the group leaving the POS and our larger squad warped to 30 of the wreck. The small squad fired bombs, causing them to panic warp. As they landed, our larger squad fired, killing the Tornado fleet. Here's the [clip of it from Twitch.](https://clips.twitch.tv/TiredHonestKeyboardRalpherZ)
---
it shows in your garbage opinions and your love for themepark rides.
---
good bot
---
Soo.. once you hit total immersion and find yourself in your happy space, you reach out to those friends and tug them in for a drink :)  One day you might be running your own corp, leading your own fleets, or owning your own space with life long friends from far and wide.  Welcome to the game where some never leave.. others leave to only come back.. and the ones that don't are often missed.  Good info and advice above!  Give Eve an honest try x3 and pls reach out to someone in-game or this thread if you find the learning curve too steep.  All the best on your new journey!!
---
Because there's really nothing to do there that you can't do just as good somewhere else. Add to that the increasingly amount of ways to earn isk, plus the fact you can just fork over cash for skills, items, or isk... there's just no motivation to be in a large alliance anymore or have the need for null space.  
---
There's no endgame... and I suppose that's how it should be in Eve, but there needs to be reason and motivation behind building and empire and fighting wars for space. What Eve needs is a shake up... a drastic change... something. 
---
TIL you, as a guy stuck in a carrier without a corp, should trust INIT., let alone anyone in general.
---
Yikes.
---
No one gets moved nowdays. Assest safety is a thing now so there is no need for ccp to move anyone. If you logged out in space and took a break from the game that is your problem. It's basically the same thing as safe logging in space the asking ccp to move you out of danger cause you think you might die if you log back in. Even if someone had 100 accounts I would expect CCP to not save them from their mistakes.
---
&gt; I wonder if part of the issue is that most players never really encounter (or notice they encountered) the problem.
---
I've never really had any issues with chat, or noticed it being 'broken'. maybe once or twice when it was new but every time i see people whine about it i check my client and local seems fine etc.
---
Frankly the largest issues is renting isnt ideal when you can get into any one of the major power blocs for free. Renting a system is only used by the corp/group renting it. So if its 5 AU dudes who grind for 5-6 hours straight in their tz then log for the day thats it. That system in theory shouldnt be touched by anyone else until they log back in.       
---
The infinite anoms thing has been around forever. It wasnt until goons settled into the best population density/ jump range region in the game that it became an issue. Even now goons(Imperium) are spread out in 4 regions yet all you hear is that their 60k mega coalition is in 1 region. Delve is the major one and one of the largest system wise in the game. Period Basis has red alliance Fountain has INIT and everything in Querious that looks like its in Jump range is directly held by goons.     
---
Reality is the average system can support 8-10 people actively ratting before someone has to find a new site. Lower truesec it goes to 10-15 higher truesec 4-8. The bigger issue is and will always be injectors and being able to have instant rorqual and super pilots. Eve of yesteryear you could find a pilot that fits your needs on the bazaar but it took time to make. Now you have people making extractor farms for set easy income and groups like goons, TEST and Darkness all clamoring to grind and inject massive capital fleets to catch up/ stay in power. They were a horrible cash grab by CCP and I doubt there is anything they can do to stop the power creep they created.       
---
If anomalies were removed tomorrow and all you had for income in space was your moons you would likely see a mass exodus of people leaving nullsec. Without the anomalies level 4 missions/incursions would pay better then your potential share out of the best moons.

So you have six accounts. You were going to sub to the game again you said, but stopped because your carrier is somewhere in space.
---
Seeing as you have more than one account why don’t you sub one of your cyno toons + the carrier alt. Plan a route and get out of there. Depending on the system you’re in, see if it’s safe enough to refit to cheap travel mods if needed.
---
It’s not CCP’s fault that you decided to leave the game without securing your expensive assets somewhere they can easily be moved for when you come back.
---
What makes you think your 6 accounts are so special that CCP would break their own rules?
---
if you can not stomach losing a carrier, why are you flying one? 
---
You can cross train that pretty easy. Gallente and Amarr both use armor tanking and drones (usually) so you don’t have to train for all new stuff.
---
Does that mean if you pick an empty system and start ratting the landlord will ignore you for a bit?
---
Actually Period Basis is now pure goon (I'm RMC and we won't be there shortly). And Outer Ring, even though it is NPC null, is full of goon and Init athanors. Cloud Ring is partly under Init control (might be fully now though). 
---
Surprisingly?  The beta launcher is much better than the old one, it hasn't forgotten any of my accounts (yet) and it launches them on the first click.  That said, its kinda sad that I'm happy a new launcher actually works.
---
Noted, Thanks.
---
Kinda my point though. Yes the fortress Delve is a thing but its not 60k people living in 1 region everyone claims. It actually spreads out even more if you start trying to divide those numbers by tz as well. Say 10k AU 25k US and 25k EU. Spread out over 4 regions potentially that makes up 1/5 of all of nullsec. Not everyone logs in daily or grinds isk daily.

Yeah I’ve only noticed it mess up once. While I was in Jita. Bounced back and forth between Jita local and some random system over and over. So it didn’t effect me.

I know it happens elsewhere, it just hasn’t really happened to me.

Then I start Amarr, I prefer them the most the more I look at them.

The practice partner was Exodus. And a good bit of the finesse comp strategy was disinformation we were aiming at PL because they kept watching our practices. I wrote it up at the time:
---
http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2012/07/about-that-pandemic-legion-comp.html
---
Leboe told me later that PL brought the comp they did against us because they expected us to bring out our Vindi flagship against them.
---
Lol the sarcasm in this post.
---
Goons traditionally pushed heavy anti renter sentiment as renters tended to be their rivals. But the reasons are no more than ideological. Non-botting renter space actually was a beacon of everyday content for many groups and people. Their farm translated to content and explosions at much higher rate than yours. That content died as renter space did. Now most of the same people live are under protection of untouchable umbrellas, safe farming to infinity, killing many playstyle and disrupting the Eve ecosystem with it.

Because even if you pick to be an Amarrian you can still fly Gallentean ships so it doesn’t really matter however if you pick Gallente you get a tiny head start into Gallente ships which can be beneficial if you don’t care about role play 
---
Pro Tip: Launch bombs when at 30k from target. Then, if you miss, the explosion radius will still hit your target.

Lemme get that other 99% then playa.

Nah, we dont want the action to go away so by all means stay. Is Test the ‘pets’ you meantioned ?

I think you only have to manage the crystals if you use faction or t2 ammo, which shouldn't be an issue when you are starting out.
---
My first thought when I saw this lossmail shortly after it happened was to ask you how much you'd sell it for.  Then I figured you'd probably end up dropping it in Uedama.
---
If you've got it, *flaunt it.*
---
Says a lot when NC refuse to fight their own battles but turn up for shite like this 
---
Drones are generally considered the best weapons for pve, and the Gallente love their drones.
---
Drones let you have selectable damage types and can even fight without orders. They also don’t use ammunition or capacitor.
---
The Amarr also have some drone-focused ships, but Amarr droneboats combine modest drone bonuses with Electronic Warfare bonuses (which are useless in pve) while Gallente ships offer better drone bonuses with no Ewar bonus.

Shh Mikal dont' interrupt narrative here. The fact that BL didn't kill the largest AU coalition in the game despite farming their US tz so much that everytime we formed for fleet they docked up everything in 2 regions means that we failed some nebulous goal for the retarded commentariat whose greatest claim to success is grouping up with 48k other mouthbreathers to Rorq mine until the end of time.

When you say "uncivilized space" I think of lowsec.
---
Its not though is it, guy has daddy issues
---
Virtually the entirety of Horde's ratting happened in GME- pocket, as you noted. (1 Constellation) The same was true of Querious before that as well. Yes, there was some ratting in other areas (naturally) but it was all heavily focused on one pocket. I think you misunderstood/I didn't communicate very well that we (I spent a bit of time in Horde's leadership at the time) never felt the need to expand ratting grounds for horde at any point in time. The biggest thing was giving Securitas a side pocket of his own for CDIAT and that was basically it.

Just came back to eve, is there a bug where I can't add or remove operators of a chat channel?

Good. Only regret was that I didn't get to personally witness its demise. 
---
Please explain which of our ‘own battles’ we have not turned up for.
---
Considering you're exchanging isk for something with literally 0 value, I doubt CCP cares or will want to repoman your ~~ glorified dick picks~~ body art pictures.
---
I have on occasion given bad relationship advice in local chat for isk. If what you're saying is true I may have to reconsider my side-hustle.
---
We actually found out about that Fort about 10 minutes before it went down and since it wasn’t far, we paid a visit with an obviously nullsec composition when basically everyone ran when we first engaged the Gilas.

Tip appreciated but our bomber FC has bombed more than your alliance has killed so I'll stick to that. 
---
CCP has an official SoundCloud with some of the sound FX from the game on it. 
---
otoh, The anti-goon culture in horde is actually pretty self destructive. The whole culture is pretty goofy. The north doesn't respect horde in the least and the south needs to slap them down because they're filled with goofy goon lust. It's just all around bad politics, bad positioning. 
---
TL,DR: couple of dumbs crying in standing coms, the only retarded I've ever blocked on horde discord and nidia catch wind of it and sperg out.
---
Evelexicon.com may be of some interest
---
Thanks but all I get is a white page with the EVE logo at the top. What am I missing?
---
CCP makes all sorts of changes to the sandbox pushing their own vision of the game already though, but the players are just too good at subverting these to their own benefits; not that any of us has any obligation to the game other than having fun in our own preferred way anyway. I guess they might need to hire a couple of social psychologists/microeconomists now to devise a plan to provide specific incentives for players to act in a way that helps with the long-term survival of the game... and it might fail anyway. 
---
Wait wait wait. So you're telling me that if I'm doing a relic, my virus also gains coherence from both my hacking skills? The lower attack strength and fewer power up slots still stink, but I never knew it did that. That's pretty cool.

Eve is like going into the military, Everything is in abbreviations. you just gotta fall on the sword and be that guy that asks, gets laughed at, and then gets the answer you needed.

That being said eJin’taan put out a YouTube video recently on eve politics and he takes a nice step back and goes over some of the language, that might be a good place to start.
---
Who is he? I’ve heard of him
---
Awesome, this is very helpful. Appreciated good sir!
---
The main reason space is empty is because people got better at utilizing the space they do use and yes, megacorps have their place in the causes for this. If you have space that is protected, why go out into unprotected space?   
---
Safety in numbers, that's all there is to it. Mining/ratting in densely populated systems is annoying, but doing it in systems unprotected is much more annoying. Speaking from a goon perspective, we could sure as hell use more mining systems. We could sure as hell utilize more ratting space too.   
---
The reason we don't is because we can't protect more space reliably. The Umbrella protects us if we aren't dumb and that's worth more than any convenience or even a bit better ISK/Hr can provide.   
---
Why this is a bad thing is another topic, but in times where hotdrops can happen literally everywhere, you basically need backup forces to be on standby and arrive in an instant the moment something happened, if you want to do any major Mining/ratting operation.   
---
If you don't have that, then you don't do bigger ops. Sure, VNI ratting can be done everywhere, but that's about it. 
---
No problem! If you have some specific questions I’d be happy to help too.

What the fuck? And actual good ass aar.

Sounds like in your absence you forgot that Eve is for grown ups...

Its virgin banna, who gives a fuck what the attention seeking cuck has to say
---
&gt;Then we moved to Etherium Reach to grab some space so we could safely krab and chill after six months of near-constant fighting, only to get skill urself parking themselves nearly on top of us 
---
That'll keep happening to you anywhere in the game if you don't do any scounting and drop forts to a random system right next to some larger alliance's staging system. Or even jump range, like you said was the case with UALX KS.

Are you even a wormholer btw, if you haven't gotten fucked by a frig-hole?

Hey thanks, I'm really enjoying my time in EVE so far. So much in fact that I've already subbed and plan on playing EVE for at least the entirety of 2019. Taking it slow so I don't overwhelm myself.

Join brave. They are honestly pros at this. Not even BM'ing they do this well.

Props to all involved, good use of a frigate hole to cause mayhem and a decent lack of salt from the victims. Good AARs to both, glad to see WH space pvp flourish. Thought DT was dead but damn, looks like they've been having a lot of fun.

Eve is sandbox, you do what you want, but I really advise you don't PvE for the sake of it and join a corp to PvP (you will need to PvE to get ships anyway, but your corp generally heads you toward a way better isk making activity).

I am not saying it's irrational for you to live in the umbrella space. Quite the opposite actually. Player behavior is not at the wrong there. It's dumb to accuse player behavior anyway (sometimes even CCP does it). It's never gonna change. Game mechanics themselves are problematic. 
---
Too late, you're in. You'll be overwhelmed. But that is part of the charm of eve. Eve is hard, there will be new stuff to discover all the time. Build your own experience the way you like it, but never be afraid to ask questions. In case nobody told you before, join a decent corporation, they will help you a lot, and the social factor is what makes this game interesting. The only time I considered quitting the game was at the start, because it was so much to learn and it felt like I would never be able to catch up. But I joined a decent Corp with friendly people, and discovered the joy of fleet fights, so I stayed, and I'm still here. Anyways, welcome to eve.

Thanks for the advise. I joined a corp SEADC a couple days ago. Just got approved and invited but no advise as to where to start or what to be going for. So I opt'd to continue with combat and business missions while I level skills and learn more of the basic mechanics.

I am a fast learner so I might need to leave this corp if I continue to not be a part of... anything really with the corp lol. I guess its goes with the territory of being new but so far, this corp is very lack luster.

You dont need local when your hard afk in a vni anyway.
---
Toughen up
---
&gt;With current mechanics it is. Doesn't have to be this way. Here is a comprehensive post on why.
---
I agree that it doesn't have to be that way, but the question is: why change one half of the defense players have in order to counter the numbers game? The game punishes you for "grouping up" naturally, by diminished bounties, loot etc. so without an umbrella, you are either forced to group up (less isk) or to play less safe (again, less isk) and in many cases: both at the same time (grouped up and still ganked is a concern)  
---
On the other hand, attackers don't have any disadvantage to bringing more numbers, since isk is rarely relevant to "getting fraggs". So, the advantage (without an umbrella) is so overwhelmingly stacked in favor of the attacker, it's just not funny anymore. Yeah, local is the other part of the "defense", and I too think it's problematic, but consider what happens when you don't have local and you don't have an umbrella. Ugh, freefarming PVE players.   
---
With the umbrella, you have a good chance of getting backup, and you do pay a price in inconvenience and less isk. So, I don't feel particularly bad about being condensed to a region and I do consider it fair. You are not "perfectly" save and you pay in reduced isk for the protection (also: Taxes etc). 
---
&gt;  
---
 Game mechanics themselves are problematic. This game, if it tried just a little, could provide diminishing returns for growing larger. 
---
The game already provides diminishing returns for condensing into a small space. Even in Goonspace, you can't mine/rat 24/7 without running into problems and so you do earn less isk in general. Nowadays, we also need 2 umbrella fleets (might be temporary, might not be), but with it comes an increased demand in organization. Yes, it's not that bad in goonspace (maybe the inconvenience is not big enough), but less populated systems don't have any of it.   
---
With big numbers, it get's more problematic and the whole reason why goons are in Delve is because you can protect a majority of it from a single staging. That's not that easy in other regions, but that's imho more a balancing question between regions (which CCP hasn't touched in years/Decades?) than anything else.   
---
So the question is: Should there be more of a burden with growing big than there is already? I don't think so (ofc it's my biased PoV, but everyone has his own biases), and I don't think CCP thinks so either. Maybe I am wrong and maybe CCP is wrong too (or their decisions make eve a worse game overall), but maybe the situation isn't as bad as you want it to be. After all, your Viewpoint is rather limited too. I think the majority of problems eve has atm is that that there simply aren't enough players.   
---
Imagine if goons had twice the players because eve has twice the players? Now bombers bar could field 2 fleets of bombers. Now Goons would need to move to other regions. Now the small gang bro could field twice as many players too and actually produce fights instead of ganks. Well.. difference in oppinion. 
---
Lol awesome, makes me feel better haha

In Tenerifis the dangerous hostile structures were only set up after we kicked out the previous inhabitants. As for ER, when we planned our move we were still blue to skill urself, who moved down a few days after we had moved iirc.
---
Loot furry saz fuck yeah
---
LMAO didn't get what you were talking about for a while but now I understand. Stupid phone spell correct pisses me off sometimes. 
---
Eh, we didn't expect y'all to go try and hold Tenerifis, which is something you did when looking at who lives there now. But with a Keepstar nearby and daily BRAVE blobs of NOspreys (which we'd dunk iirc) coming to us to entosis our entirely cynojammed constellation we decided to pack up and leave.
---
As for us getting kicked out because we sided with the attackers; you needed space for XIX and RZR, you would've kicked us out regardless of affiliation unless we'd join you.
---
Did you ask them if you're gonna remain blue long term?
---
iirc TEST brought more than a full Nightmare fleet to attack our home Fortizar lol, by that time we decided it was time to leave since we'd form max 50 or so (with a lot of multiboxing).

Its been a hot minute since I've played Eve. But its nice to see they are still kicking around. I was with them in 2010ish living in Cloud Ring and loved it.

Awesome to hear DT is still doing it's thing, and sounds like a nice fight.
---
Don't worry about it friend, everyone goes through it. The key imo is finding a group of people to fly around with and identifying what you wanna do in the game. Eve is ultimately a pretty social game, and flying solo versus flying with friends is like night and day.
---
I sometimes fly incursions but I mostly just take extensive breaks from eve until I feel like playing it again.

C5/NS WH. Sometimes you roll 3 times into that one region that is empty in a night, but other times you roll into a solo rorqual, or just a region where people actually bring subcaps to fight around. Vastly more entertaining than structure bashing.
---
Alphas were originally race restricted, but that is no longer the case, you can now train any races ships and weapons systems. Pick any race that seems fun, in fact why not make 4 new accounts and train them all!

March, what is this a fucking canvas bag?

I mean there probably have been cases where unimportant structures weren't deemed worthy your attention.

Everyone does it like that.

Play other games.

Personally I'm past the point where eve can entertain me long enough every day with the "fun" aspects. I don't like PVE, industry, I don't like solo roaming etc. The fun content for me is alliance level pvp which doesn't happen constantly so I usually just play something else while keeping an eye on discord. 
---
Hey thanks for advise. What is the best way for a new player to earn some ISK that you can do right out of the gate? So far, I've been doing the business and combat missions. I've made about 10mil so far, enough to buy some of the skill injects I needed and fully fitted the free Thrasher I got from a quest. 
---
I'd like to at least have a good idea what to do to make ISK, I'm sure this is literally the million dollar question but maybe there's a better method. 
---
&gt; All of these aberrations
---
I see what you did there
---
As long as skill injectors exist nothing will be able to fix Eve. Injectors are CCP's last bang to squeeze as much money as they can out of the game before closing the doors.

Play other games.

That's because half of the posts are retarded mumbling.

What if mining is just made automatic and we inflate the market so that ISK becomes less valuable than something so we all start using ammunition as currency...

The issue ratting, it's super ratting (and now that titan spawns are a thing it's even more retarded, because 450M ticks are fine right ?) and generally speaking each systems in NS having way too many anoms, allowing people to concentrate into single regions and thus able to rat under a super umbrella safely.

Reduce the respawn of anoms a lot more than the small fix that was attempted, work on a way to make supers (and carriers ?) to be less efficient at farming (like, I don't know, fighters being shit at killing cruisers and down) and it will fix so many issues with the game already.
---
Flair checks out
---
Yeah everyone complained and got a small SP gift. Since then, nothing. Players took a pretty small payout to get quiet and CCP noted players were a cheap payoff. No need to actually fix anything.
---
Oh for sure, but that hardly constitutes a 'battle'.
---
That's just a random abandoned citadel, usually in the ass end of no where lol.
---
It's hard to tell without knowing what you're training towards. But in high sec, the best isk/h comes from trading and incursions, both aren't easy to do for a new player. I would suggest exploration in anywhere but high sec or salvaging behind a ratting carrier in null sec.
---
eJin'taan? Dude your Klingon spelling must be impeccable.
---
No different to any other time in the he's history. 
---
As the others said, it is highly recommended to join one of the large newbie corps, there you will find tons of support. Myself I am in BRAVE braveineve.com can recommend it, but there are others as well. 
---
Lets all hold hands and lower everything on the market to 100isk then.
---
When was that prime? I lived in provi from early 2016 to early 2018 and we never fielded so many caps. Also Severance was bringing often the 2nd most pilots after CVA. And in USTZ -7- was the one who carried the whole Provi.
---
Most I’ve seen formed was a 100 something man cap fleet but then we lacked sub cap pilots. Also this doesn’t change the fact provi formup times sucked, there was only one competent FC - Jin. 
---
Also Provi started building their Super fleet a few months ago?! How is this good they are lagging years behind everyone else. HTP+TRC+WAFFLES+PHEW terrorize them daily and kill the few rorquals they have. How come a coalition the size of Provi is unable to deal with a few small alliances albeit far more competent than them?
---
If you look at numbers on fleets it’s only CVA and -7- doing the heavy lifting now and Apoc from time to time. Provi is weaker than ever atm
---
So, there is a guy(not you) and he posts a screenshot. And says something obscure like "In memory of Sort Dragon" (pulled that one out of my ass just now) in the post.
---
And everybody is like "haha, youre right" and "remember the battle for FCK-ME". And I'm standing there, thinking "yeah top post, quality nice". And I get tired asking for a TL;DR and an explanation all the time.
---
So I really wish [/r/eve](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve) wouldn't be the secret boys club you can only enter after having been in three major wars, a 100b on your account and several supers on standby.
---
GIVE ME A FUCKING EXPLANATION YOU MEME SPOUTING COCKBLASTERS!
---
You'd get deflation. Mega Deflation. 
---
I'd cancel all of my own Buy-Orders. I'd sell all the shit I own to other Buy-Orders. Even shitty ones. Because the ISK-value of everything will plummet. It makes the most sense to liquidate everything you possibly can now, and buy it back later at it's new lower-price. People with most of their net-worth tied up in assets will lose out massively. People who have piles of ISK will see their piles magically able to buy *fuckloads* more stuff. 
---
No
---
Play this game for about 10 years and you will still have to learn things. It's part of the game.
---
Show me on the doll where they dropped on you coming from your WH. 
---
Couldn't say it better myself lol
---
Generally eve is a game of continually scaling benefits, you earn a certain amount of money, use it to find a more lucrative source of income, then you keep repeating until you reach an income you're comfortable with.
---
In terms of maximized gain for minimal skill investment playing around with the player market can be a lucrative source of income. But that requires some degree of capital that might be difficult to pursue.
---
Nullsec ratting may be your best option considering the youth of your toon and the capital available to you. Full disclosure, I ratted with Pandemic Horde at the time and made use of their ratting pockets while learning the game from other people there. At the same time, you could go check up on Test or Goons if you'd like, I imagine they'd offer the same service and help.
---
A few things though. As a rule of thumb, never undock more than you're willing to lose. Since you're in highsec the odds of someone going out of their way to suicide gank you is mega low, but once you start looking about in low and null that safety net goes out the window.
---
At the same time though, minimal sp toons played *well* can absolutely be an effective force in pvp via scouting and tackle and the like. Due to the nature of the game, dumping irl money into getting sp and good gear is meaningless when the pilot has no idea how to fly the ship. 
---
Good riddance to that slob
---
&gt; how many SKINs would I have to buy to convince your management to get that fixed?
---
0
---
Sure, let me just sign up to Dual Universe.... aaaaaaand it's another Star Citizen.
---
Ah that makes sense in terms of scaling benefits, good way of explaining it, thanks this is very helpful advise. 
---
They'll break it after release, it's exactly how it went down with the current one. CCP has my full trust on this one.
---
Ackchyually
---
where are you guys going?
---
So then we really could throw money at our problems!
---
Is there anything in the game that hasn't killed it? 
---
Must be a special Business. Today developing  new (Software-) Features is way more forced than hunting bugs

Been playing on and off since 2011 - still don’t know how so much shit works. You’re not alone!

Lol holy shit. I haven’t heard of anything that bad. Rip
---
Pfft its the War of Sovless Agression thank you very much!
---
For the newer players: the meme is that forgetting to pay a sov bill is what led to the [fight of B-R5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath_of_B-R5RB).
---
^ wormholer btw 
---
&gt; Lots of the comments seem to think that 'recent changes' have somehow caused this crazy situation to appear out of nowhere. The functional structure for this type of game-play was already possible in 2013.
---
This is ignorant to many nuances. Mainly due to how you folks worship this "we were smart and they weren't" INN brainwashing rhetoric.  Here is a breakdown.
---
&gt; The mining power creep a current rorqual compared to a previous exhumer is like +20
---
The strength of Rorquals does not come only from the yield . If so, a lot of people would not make 5b+ investment to mine in them for just a mere 20%. First of all, you can get buttloads of Rorquals and be virtually afk with them. Multiboxed barges require a much higher APM. You can't guide a generic linemember into barge multiboxing track because it requires multiboxing skill/patience. Some people has that skill/patience and some don't. Whereas you can put any random person on Rorqual multiboxing track. And as we know, multiboxing is key for getting rich via mining. Single Rorquals amount to pretty much mean nothing in Delve's MER. So, Rorquals are actually significantly better. And Rorqual changes hit November 2016. Not 2013.
---
Now, as we all know umbrella regions provide a much higher safety compared to renter space where you have no help. Even mediocre alliance space was significantly unsafe compared to umbrella space. These alliances like InPanic, Solar, FCON etc kept feeding Rorquals the first year of Rorqual changes. Then most of their farmers joined umbrella empires. 
---
The gap between comparative lucrativeness of umbrella space and rental space was still not that large until people proliferated enough FAXes to keep dreadbombs at bay. That happened sometime late 2017 and not 2013. Groups like PL gave up dreadbombs in Delve. Umbrella space scored one more goal.
---
&gt; The second major factor is the new-era nullsec politics. The major entities are opening their doors to a wider range of players
---
This happened when SP changes enabled any determined new player to get a titan in a year or less. Again, not 2013. It's not like TEST/Goons brightly discovered this treasure tactic, of non-selective recruiting, in a genius manner. People just didn't want to play this way. When your playstyle is invalidated by game changes, you can resist and/or give up playing. That's not a failure to adapt.
---
&gt; Olmeca says that ratting in a rental system is a death sentence, as hunting power is at an all time high. This is compared to a relatively unchanged defensive power, that has had both positive and negative changes. 
---
Yes, hunting did evolve. But defensive capabilities also changed as I explained above. Particularly how proliferation caused umbrella space to be safer. Don't get me wrong, when I say "death sentence" I do not mean Rorqual mining in random space is not profitable. I paid 30b+ to do [research on this question](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=391531178) and it shows that the riskiest regions still have 80% of their mining in their pockets. It's just in Delve the number happens to be 96.5%. Imagine with all the organization game mechanisc made sure that they paid at least 12% of their mining in content and explosions. The lucrativity gap wouldn't be that much anymore, and people would move out to different spaces again.
---
So it's not at all about how hunting evolved. It's about how umbrella space got safer and safer to the extent that other options are not meaningful anymore.
---
Yeah trying to understand what is going on in null space is like being in coma during ww2 and waking up trying to understant who hate who and why... There are books to it
---
No problem, anytime.
---
No this sub is all nonsense. Nobody knows what the heck is going on. Don’t feel like you’re missing out. 
---
For PvE Gallente is the best faction hands down, especially for alphas.
---
The worst is Amarr(unless you use their drone ships), Minmatar are obnoxious and PvP-centric, Caldari is good if you stick to missiles.
---
is that what you've suggested? --&gt; https://imgur.com/a/RmdPjKc

I never used Pyfa software, so I did not import my character skills, didn't understand why it shows only 1 high slot for Skiff ... but just to confirm the fitting

How did they managw to keep the old chat working fine and reliable 99.99% of the time? 
---
Fly to a citadel, change out of training pod into empty pod, fit ship, scan down wh, jump in, scan down relic site to camp, watch youtube... get bored...
---
Fly back to citadel, get back into training pod, flying back to Jita, update orders and log off for the day. That's my routine.
---
Well, if you join a player corporation, depending on where they live the answer might differ slightly. Firstly for the 5 major (and some smaller) new player geared corporations, they might have specific initiatives to give you ships or skillbooks.
---
Right now you live in high security space. PvP is still possible, but has a lot of restrictions. Think of a pair of duelists; it's about as regulated as that. However with the low risk is also low reward and almost every corp worth its time has moved out completely. The only exception is EVE University, but they have a "campus" in low, null, and wormhole space so you can try a bit of everything. Do *not* mine here because you will tear your eyes out of boredom for almost no reward. There are raids (incursions) and hauling or market trading that can make good isk, but those require a bit of capital to get started in earnest.
---
Low security space PvP still has some rules and penalties but is generally open. It's a hotbed of small scale PvP, think of a barroom brawl. There are many corporations such as Templis CALSF, Bebop, etc. that accept new players and can hone you into an excellent solo or smallgang combatant.. Additionally, through the faction war system your kills of enemy militia players and capture of complexes will generate stuff that can be cashed out for money. Mining or killing NPCs for bounties is possible here but with a few exceptions is generally inadvisable. If you wish to become a pilot quick of their wits and veteran of duels, low security is the best place.
---
Null security space has no rules and features all sorts of fun mechanics like interdiction spheres. Think of a battlefield. This is also where groups capture space to live, have their "name on the map," and you frequently see battles involving 30-100 players in a fleet with capitals frequently involved. You don't get the side benefits of faction warfare here, but the money farming NPC kills or mining is excellent. There is also industry and hacking. The starter ships needed for these activities arent hard to get into and you often get a set for free. The amount of money you can earn is once or twice an order of magnitude from high security space. Space is extremely factional and territorial though, so if you're not wanting combat it's advisable to stay in the systems that your alliance/coalition calls home. If you want to see titans and big fleet fights, come to null. Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet, Brave Newbies, and Brand Newbros are the premier large new-player corporations here. Industrialists, future titans, soldiers of the line, inquire within.
---
Wormholes also is notable. Wormhole systems are a free-for-all like null, but they have no stargates and do not appear on maps. Instead, they rely on unstable wormhole portals that connect to other systems, which are often other wormhole systems. There is no local chat--so you can't tell who's in system with you unless you can spot them/their ship--so it can be very much a space for cloak-and-dagger style fights. Stealth/probe scanning skills are indispensable, the latter mandatory for navigation. It is much less densely populated than other spaces, however, and corporations don't formally own their systems but still enjoy many benefits in common with null security. Battles are usually intense and territorial to a single star system and feature shiny ships. For money, there is mining, NPC killing and hacking. NPCs do not pay directly, but drop loot--they can scale more lucratively than in null but in turn are more difficult (though the class 1 and 2 sites are likely within your solo reach)--frequently wormholers will fleet up with corpmates for co-op. For the explorer, the cartographer, the rogue, the frontierman, choose wormhole space.

Sorry couldn't help it.
---
You have a few nullsec groups that really take care of newbies, Goonswarm Federation(Goons, GSF, CONDI) in the south, Pandemic Legion(PanFam, PL, PH) in the north, and Brave Newbies in obscurity(Newbies, Noobs, Brave) these three group regularly take in new players, teach them basic mechanics of the game and how to make isk. The best way is station Trading:(playing the market is boring as shit.) Second is 10/10 farming(hit it miss could be 2 billion could be only 100 mil) third is super ratting. Ask your new team what these are. The top two are doable inside a year the last one is about 3 years out.
---
should be fine anyone trying to destroy it would get concordokened
---
now even the newbie alliances have a supercap fleet, no need to be a target of goons/PL, everyone can stomp you.
---
This killed my eve play seriously.
---
Yeah I don't think he's thought his math out properly here.
---
Who in the world are dead terrorists and why are they living in a C3 with 30+ chars 
---
&gt; Should there be more of a burden with growing big than there is already?
---
I read pretty much until here and still failed to see the kind of burdens huge groups have. The only thing barring Delve from growing larger is that there won't be anyone else to play/war with anymore. There are no in-game bottlenecks
---
The way I see it, CCP should aim for mechanics to guarantee, any region in nullsec, pays 25% to %12 of their mining/ratting in content (mining Rorquals, ratting Supers, Titans etc dying, generating content). Currently, that rate is 3.5% in Delve. One way to get it higher is forcing farmers to spread out via anomaly changes (which already began). The other way is cyno inhibition revamp (mobile cyno inhibs which CCP touched but insufficiently). That's not to say nobody should ever use supercap umbrellas. But perhaps smaller umbrellas (thus more spread out farming), and umbrellas that are harder to project and can be blocked better by better inhibition.
---
If I had to pick one reason why I pay for Omega: Cloaking skills.
---
For me, it was the high sec mission running that killed me, which is what he's doing now. The large corps absolutely suck long-term but they are good at introducing you to fleets, ways to make isk, and don't micromanage what you do with your time.

this is sov space only, not including NPC 0.0, lowsex,WH or HS

&gt; That's just too easy/cheap a thing for a genius to discover.
---
Yeah, it doesnt need someone to discover even, it happens naturally. People like certain systems for various reasons and will flock to them until they're packed, and when you have a few largely inactive systems left over it's pretty obvious it's because nobody needs to be there.
---
Also anyone with a probe scan window and a vague awareness of their local ratting situation can figure this out intuitively.

I would suggest one of two things for you if you're bored.  Wormhole space with a decent corp.  It revitalized my play for over a year - hands down the best, most strategic small gang play you can find in Eve.  Then RL came crashing in and I had to win Eve for a bit.  Wormhole corp mostly disbanded while I was gone (not my fault, I swear!), so now I'm in highsec baiting mission runners and war deccing groups that appear blingy.  It's something different and I can play as much or as little as I need in any given day.  
---
FW is terribly dead for now.  RvB is around, but you don't have anything but back and forth combat.  No money making potential.  
---
Winning eve since 2015 and it's getting harder and harder to keep up. Hoping to find some RL time again when the kids are bigger so I can drive back in. Problem is you can't do it half-assed.
---
A direct quote from the article.
---
"With the March release, we will replace the text chat backend for EVE Online to use ejabberd, a ‘Rock Solid, Massively Scalable, Infinitely Extensible XMPP Server’. Ejabberd will run on a cluster of machines in the cloud, so we're not just separating chat from the game server application, we're also taking it outside of the EVE cluster."

this is easily fixable by disallowing capitals to enter anomalies, no need of anything else tbh
---
By not touching it for a decade and a half
---
This deserves way more love
---
CCP would never do that because of how many people inject into capital / supers. A nerf and most importantly a spread out of carrier/super ratting for content would hurt CCP income a lot less.
---
&gt; That's why Delve is such a good region =&gt; a large portion of it can be covered from one position. 
---
You are talking past me right now, also saying uninteresting things we all know. By "growing larger" I never meant space. Right now Goons have 30% of all nullsec's population and a greater amount of all its farmers. I was saying that the umbrella range is enough to recruit even more players. Delve is about 60% utilized, if not less. What's stopping you from recruiting more is that you ran out of enemies. It'd be an uninteresting game if you recruited everyone, right?
---
&gt; I agree to the idea of forcing money out of the game.
---
First of all you need to get a better grip on Eve economy. PvE ships dying does not force money out of the game. It deletes minerals. But that's not an important thing. My suggestion is not about ISK sinks or faucets. ISK sinks and faucets are unimportant memes people have been fixated for lord knows what. What I am arguing is about explosions regularly happening, people regularly killing each other, people having reasons to log in the game, and people being active. Which means people regularly playing and enjoying the game. That's what keeps Eve alive. 
---
Random null linemembers like you talk about ISK sinks and faucets all the time. You can't give me a single overarching reason why faucets are such a huge problem in Eve, and why sinks are needed. Sorry but people talking in terms of faucets and sinks are not that well versed with Eve ecosystem. The only thing faucets are related to is inflation. Inflation in itself is a complicated issue, because it does not actually happen in case of directly mined ships (including capitals) due to excessive Rorqual mining. It just occurs for PLEX and faction items etc. Inflation is a rich people problem, and they circumvent it by investing into PLEX. And that's pretty much all the problem faucets are. Focusing on ISK sinks/faucets is often a memorized argument with no content.
---
&gt; Touching the cyno-inhib is not the proper thing to do. Either it's too weak (and doesn't inhib the response fleet at all), or it's too strong by preventing it all (and allows the attacker to have an infinite advantage).
---
There are solutions with a good balance. You just did not think/read about them. That being said, I'm open to balancing umbrellas by cyno itself too. But that kind of a solution is more complicated than you think as well. For example, "mass limit on cynoes" merely means that people will chain cynoes (ships will take the bridge and light their own cynoes to bring more friends). In the end this is also "too weak" a solution.
---
Watching the number displayed on space wallet ticking up is all EVE players need
---
Or just go play other games 
---
Funny how so many ppl say it's always been like this and it's easy but you never see splinter groups of experienced players from big alliances trying to do it. Like I said above the reward I got while doing it was not worth the effort. Something has changed and I can't  say what since I only played EVE seriously since 2016, maybe it's the capital proliferation, maybe it's the economy changes (no more passive moon goo income) and big alliances just offering so much.

---
Imagine having to jump to save renters. It would actually take commitment to have multiple fleets up 24/7 that cover rental space. And this for only 3b per system to save some carebear nobodies? Not realistic. As a result rental systems are only useful for subcap carebearing.
---
Goons came up with a model organized themselves to protect their friends, established services and markets and major industry, and it works very well, they also probably recruit the most new players who later plex and inject many pilots. Panfam pilots and randoms come on reddit and blame ccp for bad decisions and as a result of them their rental model being non viable anymore. The irony...

Your only at risk in delve if you fell asleep while ratting or handicapped to the point where you can't hit the cyno button.
---
Also whew build a dread cache to kill someone making ratting what a day. Are you the kind of person that suggests building a dread cache to counter the supers that drop on me in my solo frig roams?
---
This is the issue, check out the price increases on the High-Tech stuff 😉
---
It's not even close to Zeugma.
---
those 4 points are worth both the price and the train when combined with Blackglass.

I mean I guess if you want to cheap out and fly throwaway Asteros it's fine.. sort of.

You'll get used to it. The DPS coming out of the sub is pretty nasty, especially when something juicy happens and people go in hot; you're bound to see them burning their whole racks out. As a newbro, the alpha experience has a pretty steep learning curve, you can't object your way into experience after all, so you're gonna get blapped by a few posts guaranteed. 
---
It gets better though, not every post is an n+1 slugfest of slowcats and bittervets on the grr gon hat gon train, though as a wormholer btw I wish more were. 
---
Eventually you'll train into a better subreddit tank so you can bull on through the spergposts, throwing out GFs with your upventutes and whelping bads with your downvultures. 
---
You might even see Falcon get into a shitpost battle with some of our favourite sperglords, like globby or some GSM member. Sorry, CSM, I guess. Brisc Rubal already knows where I live anyway, it's not like Virginia has a lowsec gate to Stain that I can use to run and hide. 
---
Though if it did, I'd probably go hide in Poitot. It's the only named system in Syndicate. Much better than HED, that's gonna get me podded instantly. Though I wouldn't go so far as to join a blue donut, or Bob forbid, become a renting botter in the dronelands. I'd rather biomass IRL. 
---
But anyway, call a comms check check check because there is a neut in local and we are NBSI, so I should get back to the topic at hand. Long story short, just keep your head down, stay away from the frigate menace, hold your rapid Jesus launchers close, and soon you'll be just as comfortable here as The Mittani is, at Fanfest, with his wizard hat.

where do you go for subcap fights ? thats pretty rare 
---
It's Christmas and New Year's, you morons. [Elo went on vacation](https://imgur.com/a/zGh0Fyp), and we've been having regular fleets the entire time he's been gone. You all are more panicked about us than we are. 
---
Breaking news: 2 lowsec alliances go back to lowsec when they never really left it in the first place. More at 11.
---
Don´t use a dessie - take a T1 Scan Frig, bonussed to salvaging and scanning. Add some salvage drones and sink in ISK. Open Probe Scanner and bookmark any anomaly - because you will find wreck later. 
---
Don't touch me I'm poisonous classic 
---
me, problem dickhead?
---
the gila is imo the best ship for new players, you will have no cap problems, good dps good tank. Then gnosis praxis and sunesis are also good for low skill players. I d use that while training into whatever you set your first goals to.
---
Those who don't live under a super umbrella (or don't want to risk being dreadbomb, or just don't have enough support) just come with subcaps in a regular defense and try to blob the shit out of you. Hence why you roam in nani ships otherwise you're going to die horribly.
---
Contrary to what many people claim, rental space is doing just fine as a business model. If you look at the major rental programs (RMT, BoT, Init Assocs, voltaurself, et al), none of them are struggling to fill space. 
---
Rental space feels dull and empty partly because it is, but also partly because there's fuck all you can do when you roam through it. Mechanically, supers and rorqs are just as strong in cobalt edge as in delve; not all (or even most) of the issues stem from goon hyper-organisation. The ships are just op. 
---
For a group like yours, nullsec has basically nothing for you to do. You can't camp stations because they are citadels with guns and tether. You can't camp gates because geography doesn't matter anymore, you can just take a jump bridge in gunner range of a fortizar. You're a wh group, are you really going to make a timer?
---
CCP have removed most of the reasons for spontaneous, immediate conflict to occur. Defenders have a ridiculous advantage across all facets of the game, so you are highly disincentivised to leave your own space. I had hoped the new structures could provide that, but then they put them on citadels. 
---
As I do this as a career I can tell you this would of taken 5 minutes. Its actually humiliating for CCP to try pretend that their art team is talented.
---
Then stop crying and fuck off?
---
You got stockholme syndrome or something?

You need more love for this, thank you very much!

I laughed pretty loud. +1
---
I have one word of advice for you: find a good corp. Ask lots of questions. Lose lots of ships. 
---
Ok, that's 3. I don't care, JUST GET OUT THERE AND DIE LIKE YOU MEAN IT.
---
The scary thing is, in a year from now that'll all make sense to you. 
---
Someone get this man a life 
---
go follow some streams on twitch to get ideas of what to do, chat with streamers and join either a small corp within your interest or a large newbie corp. Large corps have good services but you might feel lost in them at first, to help with this go on comms and introduce yourself then explain where you are at and what is your goal. Think of eve as of a canvas which you paint on.
---
youtube, netflix and reddit. eve isn't fun.
---
i would finally stop playing
---
I recently rediscovered the fun of solo pvp.  I got blapped this morning by an excessively try-hard NC guy with an abyssal ancil rep but I had him in deep structure so that's something.  I also roamed through geminate on New Years and got 7 kills so that was alot of fun.
---
Scams are a disgusting scar on this game. In a universe where you really need trust, scams ruin it all. Especially since one person can undue your lifetime of work. There are literally thousands in the game that could do it without much repercussion. That's the problem. The act doesn't have consequences that can realistically be enforced. 
---
best advice i can give, join a newbro corp and ask a eve history nut.   most newbro corps have people willing to answer any questions
---
or, join the E-UNI chat channel, the guys at EVE University are great for helping out
---
I've enjoyed medium sized (~50ish) fleets a lot recently.  We get a ton of fun fights in Catch.
---
Small to medium corps are the way to go imo. Ofcourse there are very few ones now
---
13 years and I'd never seen this (not that it existed for most of that time). This is great - thanks!
---
When are we having The SACU War: Round 2 Electric Boogaloo
---
I always found exploration in null-sec and WH space was always fun. Be it either doing relic and data sites, or combat sites, trying to get away from ganks and trying to gank as well, using WH connections to get around, always a new part of space to be found daily.
---
When you can admit im better ;)
---
Jeez, I tried to multibox 2 accounts the other day, one of them being afk orbiting Griffin, failed anyway. How many vaccines did you have to get to be this proficient?
---
He's too busy spending all is money on Heroin to buy PLEX lol
---
&gt;You are talking past me right now. By "growing larger" I never meant growing to a larger space. Goons already have lots of regions on the map. They are just not using them. Right now Goons have 30% of all nullsec's population and a greater amount of all its farmers. I was saying that the umbrella range is enough to recruit even more players.
---
I am talking past you because you couldn't be arsed to read earlier posts tbh. Yes, goons have more than delve but they don't use it because they can't project their umbrella too far. You seem to think (especially with the context of the "article" you linked earlier) that only the largest umbrella can protect people (which is false).   
---
This is simply not true, as the umbrella means nothing if it can't arrive in time and 5 minutes for 2 jumps is already too long (unless rorquals are the victim). What's stopping goons from utilizing the rest of querios as an example is the lack of an umbrella. Yes, we could use it if we felt like it (like we do on locusts), but it's not your every day farming space unless it's fake Querious. You are right in that it doesn't stop goons recruiting, but that's only a concern when the space is overutilized and the current ammount of players just isn't enough to overutilze what goons have a the moment (maybe if we condense all nullplayers into delve, but that's not going to happen unless we get more players).   
---
&gt; First of all you need to get a better grip on Eve economy. PvE ships dying does not force money out of the game. It deletes minerals 
---
Maybe I should have made myself a bit clearer. Yes, you do not force money out of the game, but your idea is to force money out of big entities hands (by CCP guaranteed 25% loss).   
---
&gt; What I am arguing is about explosions regularly happening, people regularly killing each other, people having reasons to log in the game, and people being active. 
---
and you can have all of that by visiting delve. The problem is not explosions happening, the problem is that people don't do it because the chances to get shot are a lot higher than the chances you kill something. Why should you go to delve when you get your face smashed in?! Why should you grind money for a ship only to have it destroyed without killing things?   
---
Well, that right there is the problem. People don't see roaming as content UNLESS they can kill people. Why is that?! The way I see it, it's because they have to grind isk to replace losses unless they are in a big alliance. If they are in a big alliance, the alliance pays the ISK but that can't go on endlessly. Somebody has to replace the losses eventually and that's why ISK = Main Conflict Driver. If the alliance has enough ISK to wage war comfortably, they will do it.   
---
The lack of such a structure for small entities is what makes the game "boring" cause they simply don't have the money to go in with substance. Imagine if random lowsec entity Y had the money to comfortably replace 10 titans each month? What do you think would happen? Goons can do that, very easily at that and we have constant fleets day in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out. There is no day without multiple fleets happening, and you call that "Bad"? We provide the content for our members and it's not our fault that other people can't.   
---
It's all about the ISK and that's why I think ISK sinks are the problem and you could see that principle working any given day in goonswarm if you want. Members are rich = &gt; they are active and they participate a lot in fleets. 4 full fleets of subcaps? No problem?! 4 Fleets of supercaps + 4 fleets of Subscaps? Call a CTA, no problem!  
---
ISK sinks matter because Goons inflate the money and since they have a lot of it, everyone that doesn't suffers more and more as with more grinding to be done, less PvP happens. You can say that "prices are stable" and they are, except for the inflation tankers (aka Plex and SkillInjectors). However, given the plex and active-player history that we've had in Eve, I think they are much, MUCH more closely connected than you want to admit. Player activity is low and it was a lot higher when plex were reasonably cheap.  
---
 Contrary to what you are saying, there are solutions on the inhib side with a good balance.  
---
Make it Instantly anchor =&gt; defender has no chance to help  
---
Make it anchor with delay =&gt; Cyno is up before anchoring  
---
these are the two extremes any inhib change will produce without changing the cyno too. It will always produce situations that are as binary as they are now. Any other solution will either favor the defender heavily, or the attacker heavily. If you think of "well, cyno inhib with 2 minutes anchor delay but shuts down the cyno" =&gt; heavy advantage for the offender because he can control the fleet size. These compromises won't work for that mechanic, they might make extreme cases less likely, but extreme cases will happen regardless.   
---
And yes, I am aware that changing the Cyno and the Inhib isn't easy as many loopholes exist or need to be dealt with. I know it's not easy, but it's the proper thing to do. 
---
what about my hard afk?
---
One of my favorite exploration content was Sleeper Cache sites, and finding how to do them with as cheap a fit as possible, never did the final room of the Superiors though, too rare to find and too much tank needed for final room ):
---
There are other sites if you google eve abbreviations. This was the first one that came up.
---
Yep we been there a few times.
---
Darwin 
---
Tell me more. 
---
Since this game is a MMO, which contains multiplayer, go and get a friend, corpmate or just one of you alts and light a cyno yourself and jump out.    
---
Multiplayer is key, especially true when using capitals.
---
Dude you have serious issues with comprehending what you read, keeping on the logical track of the discussion and not talking past people.
---
You said Rorquals weren't significantly more profitable citing yield. I said they were significantly more profitable due to multiboxability. You said the mechanics allowed today's Delve were in game since 2013. I showed you that's not true by talking about what happened past 3 years. 
---
Now you are the one talking about safety vs. profit. To me safety IS part of the profit. I already talked about many ways in which Delve became safer over time and that's an important thing. 
---
So I don't know why you are responding to me with this dichotomy that I didn't even take a side. I don't even know how your graph shows the thing you say it shows, but even if it does it talks past me. It feels like you scan what I write in 2 seconds then respond. Every time I am writing something to you I question whether trying to reason with you is worth my time.
---
Fucking Mandark!
---
It sure as heck ain't shootin' dudes, which is what the GP was whining about.
---
In my original post I said 'rorquals mainly bring defense and logistical benefits' and you went on some rambling diatribe about how great you are and how evil mining is.
---
+1 :D
---
I also have never drunk moonshine with a redneck or bourbon with a KKK member. ;)
---
I formed an alliance in HS with one of my alts, with a bunch of newbros and some other veterans for Highsec wardecs. I didn’t expect to have as much fun as I have doing this.
---
There is something satisfying about having a citadel tracking disrupt your guardians...or having some professional nerf group hired to save some structure you are war deccing and them refusing to fight vs slightly smaller numbers...
---
If you’re bored I highly recommend picking a region in HS and just cleaning out out the useless structures. Even better with newbros that are willing to learn. 
---
I will probably be retiring from EVE (assuming the game remains as stale as I expect it to)... so I’m going to explore the other gameplays I never did before. 
---
The one I’m most interested in is living out of an orca in a shattered wormhole for a couple of weeks. 
---
No. I'm just clearly more intelligent than you. 
---
But Templis is a 'little' entity and Provi is big? Not sure the same comparison can be made to NC and this conflict. :)
---
Yeah thats why your reddit history is you getting told every comment that you make that your a cringey virgin? 
---
From 2013 to 2018 there have been a lot of changes to null.  Moons, jump ranges, fozzy sov, minning(rouq), caps.  Saying witch changes made the difference is a little hard.  I could talk about how, new bor friendly alliance holding sov remove the need for a lot of players to rent.  But I think that would be a bit of a fabrication.   In all honestly null had a lot of unused systems in 2013, and thing haven't really changed. And the hurricane that I'm flying still isn't an avatar. 
---
i will cut his hands
---
Roger Roger :) once its in the head its in the head.
---
Pretty much this. This is the inevitable road that we are already headed down. 
---
Welcome to the first steps of Serenity. 
---
As it was previously outlined, the short and sweet of it is there's no place safer to use Titans and Rorqs than in these giant mega alliances. Can you use them? Yes, being the most expensive ships in the game are people going to willingly put their Titans and Rorqs out to make money if they have no way to protect them? Doubtful
---
Let's say for example sake you're a wealthy(so we don't have to even address the isk investment, although there are huge isk implications in this) individual or even small group of say 15-20 people and let's say you decide you want to own some null sov now. People are going to notice you when you move in. You're going to get beat on by your neighbors and really it's only a matter of time until a larger groups gets bored enough and fields caps that you just can't match. All the while, you're trying to hold your sov and raise ADMs and top off that wallet. Good luck.
---
The bottom line is this is capitals online 2019, people want to fly titans, people want to fly Rorqs and Supers. The truth is these ships come with huge price tags(including real life monetary value for people who value their time investment or just swipe credit cards) and I don't know many people that are fond of throwing away their money or hard work so it only makes sense if you want to play Capitals Online '19 to join Goons or INIT(Goons) or TEST(Goons). 
---
Let's face it Eve is a game that for the most part requires a player base with a little bit of brainpower. You kinda gotta have an IQ higher than a doorknob to make it very far in this game. Everyone knows the best way to field your Titan that you bought with your life savings without losing it is to do it under the Goon ticker.
---
This game is a beautiful and conceptually deep and rich game and I love it, I'll play it till the servers shut down. But there's no catch up in this game. There is no way for the little guys to catch up to the big guys. The bigger the organization gets, the bigger the separation is. And that's fine, because that's fundamentally how current sov and game mechanics work, but let's at least be honest with ourselves and admit that this game model leads to Serenity one way or another.

&gt; In my original post I said 'rorquals mainly bring defense and logistical benefits
---
And I didn't engage at all with that point because I agree with it. Newsflash: I don't have to disagree with everything you say. See you can't get past at your zealous "arguing over the internet mode" to dissect the reasoning in people's responses to you.
---
There were other things in your post with which I disagreed, and I engaged with them. Like how Rorquals are not significantly more profitable, or how mechanics enabling Delve 2018 were in game since 2013.
---
Yea, I'm somewhat of a new player having only 10mill SP. I'm getting really tired of security missions...

If you are part of the massive blue blob you get less content as you have to roam 9 million miles to find peeps not blue.  Join smaller group have fun.  Lots of Content in the north no need to roam steady flow of content comes to the door.  Lots of fun to be had.

---
I don't measure how great a corp, alliance or coalition is by how many titans dongs they can wave around. 
---
In my mind, there are two names that stand out; Provi and Rooks &amp; Kings.
---
----------
---
Provi because they took the least hospitable part of Null Sec and still opened it to a NRDS policy. They are inclusive. Got some flea bitten little corp of 2 vets and 8 newbies? No worries, you can come to some arrangement and be included.
---
Want to making a fleet with some strange fit? Talk to a few people, refine the fits, make a call and people will show up. Does leadership jump down your throat for not following some chain of command? No. They have been around long enough to sit back and see what might grow from some initiative.
---
Provi don't drag their line members all over the map, trying to pee on this tree and then that tree.
---
... and Rooks &amp; Kings? They were just amazing at bending the game to their will, taking a smaller force and standing toe to toe with the bigger groups.
---
A-types or no types.

It was a troll fit that a corpsmate gave me, every year, around Christmas time, we make a shitfit roam and make a small gang out of it and try to welp into whatever we find, to our surprise, everyone came back safetly at home after the roam. There is a contest to see who got the shittest fit, and no wonder that punisher won :) Was really fkin fun.
---
make sure you learn about Highsec war declaration mechanics and ensure your new corp is not at war. many new player friendly corps will be war decced by aggressive highsec pirate corps looking for easy kills. 
---
it can be safer staying in the NPC corps while you fly around highsec doing the career agent missions, SOE epic are and other highsec activities. then join a new player focused corp when you are ready to jump into nullsec space.
---
Small corp in a larger alliance FTW. :)
---
Sounds like one hell of fun yeah :) 
---
There's no need to build them since rats dropped them.

And lose a couple a hundred miles in fighters to them.

Fyi imperium were blue for a short time to legacy during the war months back. But after the war was over, both reset each other to neutral. 
---
Both now fight each other multiple times on the daily as fleet after fleet go into each others space,  and we love going to brave or test space and seeing what responses they can muster. 
---
...we sometimes ruin them, they sometimes ruin us, sometimes its blue ball central. Local is shit up and good times are had.

HAC can fit assault damage control 
---
&gt; What is the best way for a new player to earn some ISK
---
1 - New Player Experience - tutorials whatever they are called now  
---
2 - Career Agent Missions - all of them - possibly even at multiple   locations for extra rewards and faction standings boost  
---
3 - Sisters of Eve Epic arc - the blood stained stars  
---
4 - join a newbie focused nullsec corp  
---
 - salvaging corp members wrecks 80+ mil / hour  
---
 - moon mining in a venture 40m/h  
---
 - faction war defensive farming 60m/h  
---
 - VNI ratting 50m/h  
---
 
---
i don't buy skins. They are way overprized and most of the time i don't see them anyway.
---
&gt; Its simply much easier to be "blue" to goons or test or nc or another larger force if your a smaller alliance, because then you atleast have someone to help you out.
---
This is exactly the reason that big coalitions will never go away. It doesn't matter what they do with the game mechanics, it will always be easier to blue up and have your friends help you out, than to fight outnumbered.
---
I read this and thought Ev0ke was back again :(
---
Nice AAR tho, founded like a fun war.
---
well where is it?
---
I don't know where you get this but .... (with ferox exception for some of the points - aka caldari HAC is bit shit)  ...         
---
* HAC warp faster (cruiser size)       
---
* HAC align faster (if you compare armor vs armor and shield vs shied)            
---
* HAC have better or same tracking ( when same weapon systems are compared)           
---
* HAC have much smaller signature and better resits ( they can eat bombs, while BC tank bombs on your pod structure)              
---
Actually it's the fleshlight wars. How else can you cycle your mods in 10% tidi for so long and not masterbate with hentai on the other monitors?
---
...with a fleshlight...with a fleshlight.
---
Unless you are a master at arms accelerator...
---
Ok I guess I need to clarify.
---
Why haven’t you guys just taken a 2-NS/C5? 
---
With that many guys you’d be a bigger group and could more consistently get content out of other wormholers and also still have the null. 
---
Just surprised to see someone living in a C3 and being that big 
---
Hacs can fit assault dmg cntrl, snipe 200km, faster speeds. Warp faster. Better tracking some instances. Bigger drone bays futher drone control. 
---
HACs eat shit to bombs
---
This was half shitpost, half me wondering why I spent the last two weeks training into them.  Ty.

The only time I saw CENTI form more than 50 dudes was in etherium reach (for some reason). We formed like 75 dudes somehow. Granted, about 1/4 of that was actual people, and most of the rest were Wildkins.

how's the election going?

Nah, you get blessed with a void bombs love and you cant activate it.  even if 75% of your fleet survives the initial run if you're engaged then you've just lost 25% of your pvp capability.

Just look at the ammount of times inits done it to both GOTG, PL and NC

I have found mission runner ninja salvaging can be pretty fun. Just need a combat probe launcher and combat scanner probes, as well as a mission running system.
---
Primary benefit of HACs in general are resistance vs BC raw EHP.
---
This comes into play at fleet sizes below that of alpha strike battles of logi volleying.  If the HAC and the BC have the same EHP, but the HAC has 15% better resists, remote repair is that much better and more efficient.
---
I don't know why but the chat messages you posted sound so awesome
---
HACs are doctrines in almost every alliance, and getting faction cruiser V is always a good idea.

A+ AAR.  Nice to have such an epic fight, and very little salt from those involved. Those whaling fleets sound super fun too. Also, mad props to the decision maker on our side to swap the Kiki fit for the TD, those were HUGE. 
---
Dead Terrorists, move out of that dead end hole. Get into a more content providing hole, c5/c5 c2 ns-c5, really anywhere else besides where you are at. There is a reason half the people commenting are surprised your organization is still kickin. 
---
While not being officially apart of Legacy holy have on multiple occasions called for TAPI backup and maintain regular contact. To coin a new phrase they’re “discord blue”. 
---
My fond memories of them are them being the scary boogey man in FW space while I was with DnG and doing everything we could to ruin their evening and spr srs DVD fleets with our particular brand of fun.

Except If You Were one of those dudes crying in UALX

&gt;some randoms talk on reddit
---
&gt;WOW i guess they are talking for bb!!!!
---
i believe Pando would like to have a word with you LOL
---
Fkn kids these days 
---
its cute you are pretending you did something 
---
I recall one such br, which was when PL+BL were trying to invade. Seems logical to get help from my enemies enemies at that stage. And some help from goons when co2 tried to invade (tho it seems skillu did that shit all on their own). It seems to me those are friends of convenience more than allies, HRE gets help, test/goons get to hurt their enemies. 
---
It's not only broken but has some nasty JavaScript included that got blocked by my antivirus
---
If someone "blessed you with a void bombs" and you are not warping off already ... your FC is unlucky or shit. 
---
In addition to all of the HAC benefits you also got wrong the chief benefit of T1BC. After insurance BC is cheaper than 25% ratio; it's more like 5%.
---
But can an F1 pusher find the button to push it?
---
CCP had nothing to do with it. [PL just let us use sphere to get out of there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHRNVnnKVxo).
---
I have yet to see one situation where a HAC hasn't been able to turn it's ADC on despite neut pressure.
---
The ones that died, died because they derp and fail to turn it on, or had it on cooldown, etc.
---
I have also yet to see a bomb run where a void wave has ever been placed closely enough for a HAC to not generate the minuscule amount of cap needed to turn their ADC on.
---
Give me one example where the scenario you described has occurred please, I would love to believe it because such a spectacle of timing would be legendary.
---
Go to frat space and hunt vni's 
---
Not in PROT space, but you are correct in that we do not have sovereignty in our current staging system. This is public info viewable from dotlan.
---
That, detective, is the right question.
---
You don't sell sleeper loot in Jita unless you like losing money.
---
Also does it look like CCP cares about curbing inflation?
---
Yep it is pretty relaxing thing to do after the work.
---
Benefit of BCs: Insurance.
---
The net loss by a pilot on them is so minuscule, they are called meat grinder doctrines for a reason.
---
Heck TAPI put them to excellent use when they were based out of Fountain in 2011/12, and it translated into the Drake comps popular through 2012/13, and onwards to the present day Ferox.
---
The ability to lose 4 of your ships and still be ISK positive from 1 kill is a remarkable e-peen magnifier.
---
That overview just gave me all the epilepsy. Then again I'm bad... so you might be onto something. 
---
Eve Lexicon is great, but if all else fails the set off letters might be a system name in null sec (or abbreviation of) such as [HED-GP](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/HED-GP) or [B-R](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/B-R5RB). They're always 5 alphanumeric characters with a dash somewhere in between (the name never starts nor ends with a dash). If in doubt, check with dotlan maps, which are a great resource also in many other ways.
---
Typing is too hard, my poor fingers are crippled from smashing F1 too many times.
---
I know it could look kinda busy sometime but tbh that's the best ones i've came across so far. In huge fights there is a lot of stuff flashing. :)
---
BB is literally a bunch of randoms lol

You're welcome for the high T2 prices~
---
Upvote for frienemies :D
---
&lt;3 Thanks sir.
---
Wasn't laughing at the idea of beating Fraternity, just at the way PGL interjected it into an otherwise fully tangential rant.
---
I keep 5-8 Omega Accounts at any given time, based on wormhole/industry needs. Omega accounts are a completely different side of eve, it’s like taking the training wheels off. If you can’t find your way I suggest coming to see us in TNT, or anyone else in the Imperium. The hate is hype, we have the best times in the game.
---
you just need to tell them to put the ADC on F1 instead
---
I, too, wish for capitals to only ever exit fortizars or keepstars in mass numbers for tasks sharply limited in scope and duration, reducing their chance of death to zero.
---
Yes, the answer is nerfing carriers again.
---
But what button will the gun be on?
---
Remind me when was the last nerf ?
---
T1 switching for ranges
---
The only thing that BC's do better than HACs is cost and maybe damage. HACs are faster, faster to warp, do comparable damage over a similar range, have an ADC, better resists, and a smaller sig.
---
That said, the ferox is so powerful right now because it does good damage over a long range, and costs about 10 cents after insurance. They are decent ships that you can literally throw away (which makes them op imo). You just get groups like TEST who form up 200 of them, and take on fleets of better, more expensive ships, but almost always come out on top because of isk efficiency.
---
And the hood!
---
NC has lost 80 billions in capitals, including a super, to get Oij fort into structure. Then they didn't form for the final timer. Please, Horde, I wanna see you try. 
---
Leadership might not have felt the need, but the guys tripping over each other in I-U and X5 may have felt otherwise. Worth noting also that Horde space was and is heavily allocated with the Frenchies and Russians getting pockets of their own that go under-utilized outside of EUTZ. Geography further plays a role, i.e. 7RM defense focused on KLY because who wants to experience the 100+ AU warp in X-7 in anything bigger than a frigate, or who rats in FIO1 because that's on the main drag to Cloud Ring so there's almost no early warning from intel.
---
Also, we're discussing ratting almost exclusively but mining matters too in any discussion of utilization. And it's beyond dispute that Goons *and* TEST use their space better than Horde does, as evidenced by the proliferation of 6.0 ADMs in Delve, Esoteria. Querious and Fountain. It's simply not true that they focus on a single constellation.
---
Dafuq is Osmion?
---
Did you just say this game is good for new players? Haha oh boy your gonna find out soon enough how toxic this game and community is. Hint if you ever played rust that's here x2.
---
I think with the deployment and initial vuln time an attacker would need to war dec you in the first 15 minutes of you beginning to anchor to have a chance at killing it as it came out of build.
---
Hence, ishtars

---
Without the ability to scam, blackmail and backstab, trust would be irrelevant and you may as well be playing a different generic mmo.
---
Uh hi. I'm going to need you to take a different name. This one is taken. Thanks.
---
Ah, fair enough.
---
I remember talking to CCP Rise about this exact thing at Eve Vegas. The biggest balancing factor HACs have is that to effectively fly them you have to be paying attention.
---
By having one monitor :) large series only cycle every 3 minutes 20 seconds, I don't have to look but ever hour to recycle guns
---
You just DD'ed my brain off the grid with this post.
---
The big corps are not terrible, they are a pretty solid choice.
---
A small corp can be better, if everything comes together well. But out there are also lots of small corps, which are really terrible. Wrong time zone is only one possible mismatch - corps may be very focused on one activity which one may not really enjoy (e.g. only gatecamping, only turbokrabbing, ...), many have low activity in all timezones, some are even scamming or exploiting newbies.
---
Finding a good small corp is not a trivial task, that's why most people recommend the big 3 (PH, Brave Newbies, Karmafleet). 
---
I can only describe Brave from my own experience. We are big enough to provide lots of different activities in all timezones. If you ask, people will help you, also explaining things more than once if necessary. But there is no forcefeeding. Nothing is obligatory. Great freedom, but for a good experience you need to show some initiative yourself, go on comms, participate, ask stuff. Otherwise you'll go unnoticed and still sit there without an idea of what to do.
---
Upvote for some awesome neighbors.  
---
Fun group to fly with.  
---
What if you have more than 10 Ishtars and only one marginally competent FC?
---
If you trained into them for no reason, maybe it was a bad idea.  If you're in a corp/alliance that flies them, it was a great idea.  Unless you like mining all day.  Then it was a bad idea.   
---
Shortly after a a humongous buff
---
You're not wrong.  But if someone actually cares about getting better at PvP, flies small gang, or wants to see reps land more effectively, the HAC wins 100% of the time. 
---
One major factor that I haven't seen mentioned yet is that the additional cost of a HAC (or most T2 ships) over a BC isn't much compared to the value of a player-hour. For most null-sec alliances are are always struggling to get as many folks into a fleet as they can, but often those players/alliances have the excess wealth/industrial-capacity to easily field a HAC over a BC. 
---
I'm not saying the ISK-war doesn't matter, but if you get 10% more from a doctrine that's 300% more cost, it can be worth it. 
---
[removed]

Half of it is ^^
---
I'm in love with the Nestor!!!
---
Good vid from a good pilot :)
---
Its funny because for all the blame they put on legacy code, BY FAR the worst systems are the new ones.  The current devs just can't seem to do anything right and use the "but but but legacy code!" excuse.  Now that they've redone most of the crap and its even worse than it was, people are finally starting to see through that argument.
---
Thanks!
---
&lt;3 Thanks man \\
---
Awww. Tyvm mate
---
Mobility is a pretty big deal.  The warp speed and align alone makes HACs a lot less annoying to fly around.
---
Also, and this is just me, but I have a fuckton of SP, and it's nice to use them sometimes.
---
apologies, just was thinking about what i said in another thread about 0.0 and renter space and why is it empty and why doesn't anyone just take sov there. Generally as someone who has played eve for along time its not anything new, and its not anything that hasn't been talked about for some length either. : ). I'd prefer if everyone was nrds and no one was kos anymore and we all got along swimmingly and i could retire, but i doubt that is every going to happen  :)
---
Maybe he thinks a gigantic spod rock is ‘content’
---
Palms are sweaty, hands are shaking and I'm still getting headshots.
---
Oh agreed, but this entire thread is full of people commenting on how much the HAC is better than the BC, and extolling its various virtues.
---
I figured I would point out the one tactical reason why someone may prefer the BCs; because who gives a fuck when you lose 100 of them!
---
Bluewaffe are by far the most l33t corp in WKEND so by all means get in touch 🥳
---
***If you cannot afford to lose the carrier, why are you flying one?***  
---
Also you have 6 accounts, ***you are perfectly capable of moving the carrier yourself***, or using a different account to actively search in game for a corp of friends or to make an attempt at getting the carrier alt into the alliance of the new owners of the region for a successful evac into NPC Null or Lowsec, or any kind of security.
---
There are a vast number of options available to you, the worst you could have chosen was complaining to reddit with a gross sob about how CCP won't make you the exception of it's rule because you took a year break like most players in new-eden do at some point.
---
*If you trully cannot get out, contacat me in game and I will light a Cyno for you*  
---
r/SubredditSimulator is leaking again.
---
&gt; If you are part of the massive blue blob you get less content as you have to roam 9 million miles to find peeps not blue.
---
That's a bit of a generalization.
---
Sure, if you krab up in Eso/Delve/wherever, you're not really close to any content.
---
However, I'm pretty sure everyone (Test at least) has numerous stagings, most of which are close to bad guys.
---
holy fuck horde won a fight in hisec. these are the end times
---
Nice!
---
Strong design and lots of maintenance hours.
---
Making structures, grabbing cheap firesale contracts, and blowing up bads.
---
Don't forget that Horde is the group that used hisec mechanics to make test look like incompetent idiots.
---
i mean.. id hope you blap stuff with 80 nados..
---
but didnt exactly that happen to you guys before tho?
---
He says with an ocean's worth of salt.
---
In higsec - sure :      
---
* no bubbles       
---
* no tackle ships in separate fleets         
---
* no bombs         
---
ok!
---
Stop crying about CCP not holding your hand, and use your brain to figure out how to fit a T1 frigate to light a cyno. If you can't even put in that much effort to help yourself, why would anyone else help you?
---
Howdy, So I can't fill in the history with Volt. I come to this thread as a "top posting" line member of .VC. and wanted to come share the current state of the corp. .VC. has been in the GSF for just over a year now and is in a pretty good place. Participation wise we do our part. Although I can't disclose numbers about our assets we have made strides to improve our super cap and rorqual count (Spodbless Delve). We have an extremely positive outlook for 2019 and I am happy to be a part of it. 
---
I joined .VC. after they had joined the GSF after I was in another GSF member corp for 6 months to rejoin my old friends that merged into Volt.
---
Fighting autism with autism. Nice 7b br post tho &lt;3
---
Explain?
---
That’s a really great point.  That’s the main reason I trained into them.  My alliance stryggles to get more than 25 people in a fleet so T2s are
---
pretty essential.
---
No, the answer is no.
---
The race of your char hardly matters (only a few starting skills), more important is, what you actually train.
---
The big decision in my opinion is the tank: Shield or armour? This depends mostly on your corp/alliance. It is a major disadvantage, if you trained an armour race like Amarr and then join a shield alliance like Brave - you'll have no/bad skills for all doctrine ships and for improvements above 5M skillpoints you need expensive Alpha injectors or Omega time.
---
So if you are already a member somewhere, look at your doctrines / ask the people in your corp. If you are not decided, yet, it might be a good idea to create at least two accounts and train them differently.
---
Playing rs3
---
 *Okay you think I am watching just reddit I people on the fleet.*   
---
wut?  
---
I PEOPLE ON THE FLEET TOO!
---
I'm going to think you're saying you have people in the fleet relaying information. But if you were on this fleet or had people relaying, you would of easily known no one was blamed for anything. Other than our FC leading us into dank kills!  
---
So you're not in Evictus, but you are?  
---
At some point, you've got to make up your mind. Either you are or you're not in Evictus.  
---
You've got me so confused. I'm going to disband my corp and go to Highsec as a solo miner!  
---
:D 
---
So basically space usage is so low there's no point in having that much space to yourself and the really rewarding perks of null are gated behind having a super umbrella anyway?
---
I mainly trained into them for small gang fuckery, so this makes a lot of sense.  I was just a little underwhelmed by them because I thought they would be more than a T1 with more tank and an ADC.  
---
They would need to both nerf the spawn into the ground while bumping the rewards up significantly, so that things would turn into anom hunting rather than anom camping, while still being profitable thank to the boosted rewards.
---
Would that work?
---
&gt; \-Don't loot from wrecks unless you're prepared to get shot at. 
---
If you want to get shot you'll need a fleet comp with the following (Ideally):
---
* 1x Ninja baiter
---
* 2x Logi / DPS pilots
---
* 1x Orca Pilot with a 100mn MWD Cap stable fit and spare Logi / DPS ships in SMA.
---
The workflow:
---
1. Ninja salvage + Loot Wrecks
---
2. Get Shot by Mission Runner (MR)
---
3. Tackle MR + Don't Explode
---
4. Warp in 1x Logi and land Hero Reps
---
5. Wait for MR to shoot Hero Logi
---
6. Warp in 2nd Logi and Orca
---
7. When Orca is on-grid, One pilot De-Aggros and ship swaps using the Orca's SMA 
---
8. Ransom MR and ALWAYS honor the ransom!
---
A typical ransom would be:
---
*In exchange for safe passage of the MR's ship the following conditions are met:*
---
* Shoot remaining on-grid rats and blue all on-grid wrecks
---
* 50 Mill Isk Payment
---
* A Rookie Ship kill mail to help claim the monthly Ninja Corp competition prize for most Kill Mails in a month.
---
The Ransom workflow:
---
* Once ISK received and wrecks are blue, MR is to eject and dock in station to get a free Rookie Ship
---
* MR Returns to mission pocket in free Rookie ship and provides the Ninja with the required kill mail.
---
* MR's ship is to remain in space to ensure the MR returns to complete the transaction.
---
What really happens and does not violate the Ransom terms: 
---
1. MR Ejects and warps to station in Pod
---
2. While MR is gone all ships and drones unlock MR's ship
---
3. Ninja boards MR's ship, copies the fit into fleet chat for LOLs
---
4. Ninja ejects from MR's ship and returns to bait ship waiting for MR to arrive.
---
5. While MR is getting the rookie ship and returning the 5 minute Aggro timer will expire and so will the Ninja's suspect timer if done properly.
---
6. When MR returns he is told to shoot the Ninja and that he *might* need to change his safety settings to do so.
---
7. MR will shoot the ninja and get concorded.  (They shoot because they see that their ship is still in space, empty,  and safe as per the ransom agreement)
---
8. Someone in the Ninja fleet will take the blame for 'accidentally' shooting the criminal pod on grid. (whoops, thankfully the safety of the MR's pod was not part of the ransom.)
---
9. Ninja re-boards the ship formerly owned by the MR, Scoops the MR's frozen corpse into the cargo hold, warps MR's ship to nearest station and contracts it back to the MR for 50% Jita buy price.
---
10. Ransom terms have been honored and the transaction is completed.
---
11. Bonus Round:  Use the Kill Right the MR provided to hunt the MR down a second time.
---
12. Bonus Bonus Round: Convince the MR to repeat the ransom workflow.
---
Init Stukas frequently pull this off. 
---
You keep believing that it will be your down fall -  wonder what happened to the test bombers last night.  You keep believe that mokey you want me to lower my guard and that will not happen.  
---
I'm rolling up on my second year of being free of this shitpile of a game. Absolutely in love with the fact that most other games I can wrangle up what I need to go do things within a few minutes rather than trying to beat even a small group of idiots into shape for a solid 20-30 minutes, an hour of travel to find someone worth shooting etc etc.  
---
I don't miss managing/wrangling social misfits who's only life is Eve Online, and yet even though they live breath eat and shit eve and I at most had about 2-4 hours a night to play would still flounder about uselessly without a non moron adult around.
---
Still like reading about it though. So hi, here I am. 
---
Been playing EVE for a few months now, just have a quick question:
---
How do shuttles get kills? I see kills on ZKillboard with shuttles that do 0 damage, how do they even get a kill?
---
Thanks
---
But all scams rely on the victim being uninformed, gullible or straight-up stupid. People that have their lifetime of work ruined, as you say, fall in the 3rd category. The few types of scams that cannot be anticipated, such as the character bazaar fraud, are forbidden and severely punished. And if scams were forbidden altogether, then trust would be meaningless, just as it is in almost every other MMO. They're not a disgusting scar, they're part of what makes this game deeper and more interesting than your average amusement park game. 
---
idk im asking you
---
What's your point? that fights happen in Eve?  Because they do...sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
---
The thing that confuses me here is why the TAPI FC let so many bling ass ships stay on field after the first one went down in one volley.
---
This is the most apt Eve metaphor ever.
---
Then you switch to gilas.
---
It was usually 4-5 chars from Wildkins, 2-4 from other directors and at least 2 from most line members ^^ Memeing around in Gila's is great for a smaller alt-heavy group :D
---
&gt; This. I think it's about money. They invested all their money in dead projects. Meanwhile they kept Eve in maintanence mode, where bugs, balance problems and botting is OK as long as there is no huge player turmoil. And the turmoil is just extinguished with some PR post. 
---
I can't blame them for diversifying, but I can sure as hell blame them for wasting development resource in mismanaged projects.
---
A world of darkness MMO is a sure seller even if it's fucking terrible because frumpy middle aged ex goths who lived for that shit in the 90's abound, and they have disposable income for flowing pretty dresses in their ERP simulator. It's the entire reason Second Life still exists. The fact that they fumbled the ball roughly a dozen times on that project is very telling about the management at CCP (it's bad).  
---
Definitely.  When I lived in null, we ran a standard Arty Cane fleet routinely.  As much as I love fighting outnumbered in nano, it was incredibly relaxing to just sit back and punch F1 when asked, collect my insurance and SRP, and move on to the next fleet... 
---
whats the point of creating a reddit thread of outblobbing 3to1 with only 4.5b of kills?
---
Don't get me wrong, those gilas allowed us to do all the cool stuff we did. They're still super gay though.
---
 **EVE Elite Shitposters Club**  
---
 as always, stay true to your beliefs!
---
They were great, as long as one of your characters in fleet actually had an interesting role like logi, anchor, dictor, etcetera.
---
The entirety  of drone space and Angel space can be halved to increase content tbh . 
---
what's the point of responding to a thr....oh never mind
---
The faction and race you choose to play as doesn’t matter. Where you play is more important.
---
Sure we do.
---
Gotta disagree with you bud. The beautiful thing about EVE is that such scams are possible, and that people fall for them constantly, and have no recourse.
---
It's really just Ferox that are a problem right now, their tank is pretty good when taken in tandem with the fact that their damage is effective from like 10km to 100km.  The primary advantages of HACs are slipperiness, far greater bomb difficulty, and MWD sig reduction meaning they can kind of linger on grid with caps without *completely* eating shit.
---
Never said bombers bar was neutral. Just pointing out the facts that when it comes to strategic operations you guys are blue. You aren't deployed in each other space. You both have deployments and SIGs in Geminate. You guys are basically blue to each other. Only an Imperium or Legacy pilot would think the two aren't blue. 
---
Yeah you guys kill each other's fleets, but so did NC. when Horde was Bluetral to Horde. Guess what see that blue in there. Yeah we were still blue to each other...
---
Noice! Smart thinking on the ahimsu fight I thought you were toast for sure.
---
all you need to manage is ammo for range (mutifreq for close, radio for long)  , only T2 and fanction wears out   
---
in the end its barely a hit on cargo, wich is great imo 
---
I mean, or you just offer a % ransom and then demand the ship and renege on that as well.
---
You're welcome to your rituals but I think most people are here for the isk. Don't care about honoring ransoms.
---
You got me for a moment I thought ccp had finally decided to fix it their post and reasoning looked good - then I saw the date.
---
I don’t care about local intel happy to see that removed, and the spam in jita is toxic but the all round instability that seems to have come with the new chat is what is annoying.
---
Why did the user above you delete their comment?
---
You get in a ship, shoot at someone, miss, dock, get in a shuttle/freighter/whatever, they die to NPC's, you get a killmail showing you in your current ship as the killer.
---
Nice vid even though rlml makes me sad.
---
That was good
---
holy yikes, you clearly live in bizarro land.
---
If you are in Brave, you are already Kill On Sight, same with Horde and other bigger space guilds.
---
Of course, but we keep buying tons of skins and not bringing up bugs CCP will probably put their money in skinmaking (for example hire more artists) rather than other parts of the game (like fixing months old bugs with with a new feature).  
---
As a side note, I know development takes time, and I’m not expecting a fix for a bug within a week. And I’m also aware that they, of course, want to push things that makes money.  And I know r/eve tend to blow things out of proportion.  
---
But a balance is needed, if they let to many technical problems stay the game will die. (And nobody wants that, hence why people tend to get annoyed at bugs that aren’t getting fixed).
---
In today's EVE, using BCs is committing to a fight and committing to losing some ships. Using HACs means you can evade the fight (and the losses) if you wish.
---
It's almost like CCP signed a really bad year long contract for some service and can't get out of it.
---
The best part is that some of the acronyms don't make any sense any more. For example the Raven Navy Issue is shortened to CNR because it used to be named Caldari Navy Raven
---
Sometimes it just feels good to get a win.
---
Always wondered how they would hold up in there. Was fun to watch 
---
I love tornado fleets ;)           
---
If you mean years ago, then there used to be a mechanic where you could "assign fighters" to any ship you wished. The ship could then warp many AU away and the fighters would follow that ship, respond to its targets, and protect that target. So if you assigned your fighters to a shuttle, the shuttle could "attack" with them.
---
If you mean more recently than several years ago, I don't know.
---
Currently in EVE, there's a significant war over.... tax revenues. 
---
This game is weird.
---
Nice Video.
---
Gwen is such a hard fight. He is a really good Vedmak pilot, think you've also killed a few of my buds but I've been lucky to steer clear of you.
---
I love the Vedmak for Abyssal sites, it's damn good fun. The only downside is you can invest 3bil into a ship and pod and still only coin flip the matchup. 
---
I go with a cheaper 800m setup. One normal rep one ancil, works ok. 
---
Maybe if the bug isn't your whole chat system in a social game where being able to chat or at least see chat is extremely important. This is just an embarassment.
---
Great Video, I killed that dude in the Ashimmu twice already

---
This process has been fine tuned to provide Max ISK per engagement and allows for a followup opportunity to repeat the process.

The only significant detriment to this process is the loss of shiny kill mails and a Zkill board that makes it look like all you do is hunt Hi-Sec pilots in rookie ships.

Or bumping them just for the sake of bumping. You don't ask for a ransom and you don't want to steal their drones, but making an orca to go over 3000 m/s is quite satisfying. Of course if they happen to pay or lose their things for some reason it is a bonus.
---
More numbers than in wwb 
---
Was in test great content in catch.  Just saying the north gets lots of roaming gangs and it's fun as fuck.  Smaller groups tend to get more content as they have less or no blues.  
---
"Followup" opportunities are meaningless. My group recorded over one hundred hits (characters who we saw when we warped into a mission) over a 3-week period and found 0 repeats.
---
Even assuming our sample size was wrong by a factor of 10 or (so the repeat rate could be as high as say 5%), it would still be worth more to simply drain each individual dry for as much as you can get.
---
1-2 systems for a say 500 char alliance is a silly estimation. Given that is like 30-50 real humans, it is.
---
Even with high truesec you can only have like 10 VNI alts per system or 2 carriers and 5-6 VNIs per. Worse truesec gives you less ratting 'slots'. A constellation - sure, will be enough. I agree though rental empires are in the past and mostly botters use them.

Windrunner tornados are meant to have t2 hyperspatials.  4.24 au/s subhumans.

The problem is either the anoms aren’t that good compared to just sitting in the umbrella and running “worse” anoms more consistently and safely, or they pass the “definitely worth it” threshold in which case groups figure out how to project and be safe in that space, kick everyone out, etc. There’s no balancing PvE with infinite/gradated anoms in any real way, that’s why CCP made abyssal payouts almost entirely in loot drops rather than bounty mechanics
---
im actually french, and i used to fight outnumbered :) (and still do haha)
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30003668/201812231700/ or maybe not outnumbered but atleast outgunned? :D all it takes is to find idiots :)

Hehe yea that certianly didnt hurt (:

Remind me again how making test look like incompetent idiots is an achievement?
---
It's almost as if you can't attract talent to a failing games business on a remote volcano in the middle of the ocean.
---
Serpentis extravaganza again!?
---
Yeah we tried something like that for a bit. Turns out the fact there's no repeats is *because* the usual target is a sporadic player. And poopsocking it across new eden to chase down some MR who's probably flying a T1 fit raven after you blew up his shiny?...
---
Not worth the time.
---
It's much easier, simpler, and faster, to simply generate new content with new targets.
---

---
I hope you get caught. I have no sympathy for pilots like you who cba to play the game mechanics and just want to be spoon feed by CCP. 
---
You got the carrier there, you get it out. 
---
Goons certainly need the elbow room, but with TEST I don't think it's a matter of "require," they've simply committed to using their space more effectively than does the similarly-sized Horde.
---

Most of the people I knew in Horde were pretty alright, but that dude is just a textbook sycophant. Literally everything I ever saw from him was either sucking up to people in power or being abusive to people who have less power than him.
---
Isn't Gila Caldari?
---
I am eagerly awaiting more free skill points
---
So I should start Gallente First.
---
May try to do that in the future.
---
Dark Blood... Oh you mean the Amarr Vampires?
---
Pando is the first to admit that HACs (and muninns especially) are the hardest to bomb. We throw void bombs in the mix in the vague hope of stopping them from hitting ADC right before the damage comes in, but it's all in all tough as shit. Mostly because of their ADC and their speed. 
---
So before I won Eve for the third time I started The Angel Cartel corp to house my alts with the intention of scanning down Hisec carebear mission runners which used to be an epic fountain of tears. I thought it would be kind of entertaining karma if in the middle of them slaughtering angel ships in their pwnmobile if a bunch of actual players from The Angel Cartel came into their room with all the ensuing ‘Here’s one spawn you didn’t expect from Eve survival’ trolling smack. It’s a shame CCP never let us align with the Pirate Factions FW style and gave us a mechanic to jump into any NPC mission from our faction and do the mission runner dirty in surprise bumsex. Not sure if there is enough players left to make it worthwhile content but if any bittervets want to have a go with some HiSec terrorism to try and find some fun shit to do then hit me up. No real requirements beyond the usual freighter bumping Mach’s, ganknados etc or whatever the current working meta is. If nothing else it’s a pretty cool corp name to have if you are a fan of angel ships &amp; piracy terrorism. If we get a dozen or more like minded idiots it might make Eve worth logging in for again.
---
gobbins must like it, otherwise why would he allow that fuck to be in the corp?
---
As a fellow lowsec shitlord that welps to schneckt and also helps schneckt collect on their insurance payouts, I can confirm that these guys are a blast.  They're pretty much the antithesis of the risk averse PvE centric brain drain that is the cancer of the game. 
---
Good video lads, keep them coming. 
---
can we get the old one instead
---
Oh, didn't know that.
---
Thakn for that piece of info, then I might start in the green team.
---
You have any damsels for sale then? 
---
Noted, Thanks will look into the Gallente then.
---
nano Drek... rams brutix first fight :D
---
Remind me to never piss you off.
---
So I still have to restock ammo every now and then?
---
&gt;aka caldari HAC is bit shit**
---
It's actually a pretty good hard counter to Muninns.  It shoots straight into the resistance hole with more effective damage at just about every range.
---
Like Hi-Sec, Low-Sec and Null-Sec?
---
Not bad for a new player, next time try not to ram a hull brutix in a kite ship.
---
Don't both learning it. The game is still fun without the bittervet epeen contest on Reddit.
---
I prefer shield but that also means starting Caldari and... well no fan of them except for few of their ships.
---
I think you'll find test are the group that used hisec mechanics to make test look like incompetent idiots.
---
"u mad"
---
Ah, got it, thanks for that bit of info.
---
Anything else I should know? like Drones and Missiles?
---
Its wasn't until TAPI tried to act like they were good at hisec. Then it became an achievement in schadenfreude.
---
... That's fair.
---
Let me rephrase. Make test look *more* like incompetent idiots.
---
And they were recently nerfed so CCP probably thinks they're just fine
---
You're probably right.
---
Yeah, because CCP are gonna fire some guy over your dumb petition lmao
---
If ratting bounties are the most important aspect of Eve for you maybe you should now 🤔
---
Heyyyyyyyyyyyy my bruh ! Thanks for support and hopfully see you on grid soon :)
---
I petition you to stop posting.
---
The other factor that people seem to not realise, is that the good smaller pvp groups such as skill urself (and others, im sure there are some) are opportunist, they go for renters, weakening alliances and small 'independent coalitions'. Why, because they know there is a very good chance of beating them. 
---
Why don't they go for the mega coalitions? **Because they just can't fight the numbers/sov autism**
---
So eventually the target collapses and members bleed into the blue coalitions and the game suffers a bit.
---
Not a criticism at all, just something that happens.
---
Well yes, but also each one of those has more popular areas with more people. ie in my experience for high sec: minmatarr space is pretty dead, caldari space is hectic busy, gallente space is quiet, Amarr space is somewhere between quiet and hectic busy.
---
Well at least we got some high quality train drifting scenes out of it! 
---
Thanks man, Like we said, get in pub,just ask us for a fight and we will bring it. Timer fights are boring as fuck. Gotta defend the home somehow tho :)
---
sounds cool af. Which region do you mean? 
---
You run faster with a knife. Everybody knows that
---
Waaaay smaller sig
---
use the drones and missiles according to your opponent (see NPC damage table) against players its random, but Shield tanked ships have a weakness against EM usually , armor tank is usually weak against explosive (unless the player has fitted modules to counteract em) 
---
By the way, if you have more fotage from that fight against waffle's leshak fleet off your citadel, I'd love to see it.  I recorded that fight as well but my footage isn't great - plus it's always fun to see a fight from a different perspective. 
---
Doesn't it only affect jita though? I'm saying its not bad but if it only affects the 0.01% of players who wanna post in jita local for some reason I don't think it's a problem that should be on the top of r/eve every single day
---
Updooded. Excellent video man!
---
I think ive recorded the entire fight and i think jevs has footage too. I'll confirm this as soon we see each other in game &lt;3
---
Ah I miss the old CDIAT days. Sec was the fc that kept me in game. When they disbanded into horde vanguard I won eve for awhile. Making a comeback now though!
---
join another corp in goonswarm?
---
Seems legit 
---
Thanks senpai :D !!
---
👌😂😂
---
Maybe it was me not explaining it but the structure would be a freeport. Also, we would not be "participating" except to scan new sigs to K-Space.
---
I agree it is difficult to try and get something going and this isn't the first time I have tried (probably wont be the last either), I also came up with a race idea with sounded pretty decent on paper but nobody wanted to do it (despite quite a healthy discussion theory crafting ships to run in)... but I digress. I had someone contact me that might be interested in running a news story on it to help generate interest and I have a few friends in other WH corps that might give it a go to see if it works but will have to see.
---
On the trust point, I take your point but it's a bit of a catch 22. Nobody will trust me without a track record but I can't generate a track record without people trusting me.
---
This is why we are anchoring a freeport and making everything public even to the point of posting routes on a separately hosted website so people don't need to use our Corp's TW.
---
In game channel is now up though ("Wormhole Warzone") so let's see.
---

---
SSjGhost
---
Still worth it
---
Gila is pirate faction (Guristas in this case) which means it uses 2 racial cruiser skills, in this case Gallente and Caldari.
---
Tapi is deployed in Oij for 3months already. 0 progress in Geminate.
---
&gt;All of these aberrations
---
Watch that tone of voice, you are one of "these aberrations" too!
---
Regions good for small gang in my opinion: Syndicate (sometimes), Germinate, Wicked Creek/Detorid, Tenal, Malpais, Omist, Catch, and some parts of Querious. I might have missed some but I find that these regions you have a decent chance of being able to get fights as a small gang entity. Other regions are either too dead or too cap blobby.
---
Why is NC even there?
---
That could happen yes and for one wouldn't want to stop that and let's be honest, what stops everyone that gets shit on by Sleip fleets saying, "fuck this" and grouping together.
---
I have (at the advice of several people) created an in game channel ("Wormhole Warzone") and what stops people from posting in there if they see 60 Sleips crashing a hole from jumping into the nearest HS and bringing stuff specifically set up to counter it?
---
I don't mind people questioning my motives, the logistics of setting it up or the interest it may or may not generate but not doing something because "someone brought more guns" doesn't seem like a legit reason not to do it to me.
---
Stuck in goon propaganda echo chamber. Poor spodbrain :(
---
Yea, because CCP likes to just ban random people for account sharing without any cause. They clearly had something on you. That doesn't mean they were right, but something happened that caused them to think that you were account sharing.
---
Also, There's no way they're going to fire a lead GM because of your stupid petition that nobody is going to agree with.
---
Come to 1-SMEB next time?
---
Who knows? If this works then maybe this might be the first step of setting something like this up.
---
As @lokley says though, the two main factors for me that would prevent something like that happening are cyno and local chat.
---
Still something worth thinking about though.
---
The guy has a pretty nasty demeanor also takes forever to reply to support tickets.
---
Solid video!

LOL.

You, for showing support for an idea, on Reddit, may just be a braver man than I for attempting it in the first place :)

Do you promise to drop a cap fleet on us?

I would argue there are lots of things that make J-Space different to K-Space but to address what I think is your point, the route in and mapping a few selected "hotzones" only facilitates people being able to get to the area where they (hopefully) know other people are doing the same.
---
On the EvE forum post I explain how I think this is different to Thera and wont do it here because it was a wall of text but hopefully I have articulated the subtle but important differences.
---
If you are interested then take a look but I appreciate it is, as mentioned, a wall of text.
---
CCP don't go out their way to ban (especially permaban) for account sharing unless you're doing something else. OP is obviously not telling the whole story.
---
No, lol.
---
Not really because R O R Q U A L S. Nullblocs really don't need to do anything now except tax the miners using the new mining ledger. Line members get better access to the goo, and the passive empire is now an active member-driven empire with a supercap umbrella. If you had an R64 outside of your super umbrella I suppose you might move for that, but I don't know of anyone that did.
---

I like how during the one fight in the video the Tri move op is ganked.

Everybody knows that dropping your supers on a 2 man gang is way more fun.

How do you dismiss contracts and stop them endlessly nagging for attention? Swear it used to be in the journal.

Sounds like you need to play another game like the rest of us

Just inject into capital - you can do it now.

A friend rented a system in Vale Of The Silent.  I think it cost around 3b a month.  It would take him about a week to earn that VNI ratting.  Another ex-corpmate also rented another system for personal ratting.
---
Couldn't mine in them, since too many random hostiles and no response fleet.
---
I got notice of clone destruction recently when he stopped renting it.
---
It just wasn't worthwhile anymore.
---
Amarr have a relationship with cap booster charges. That's basically what goes into your cargo hold besides crystals. Amarr ships are cap stable later when you have the proper support skills.
---
He might be a cunt of a GM but you dont get a permanent ban if there isn't evidence against you. 
---
generally most newbro alliances have relaxed requirements.
---
Horde for example doesnt have activity reqs.  unless you want to go for one of its more specialized corps like blessed bean.
---
if your in horde main, just hop on when available or when u see some fun in discord pings.
---
i can't speak for karmafleet or test.  but they do got more relaxed requirements than mainline corps.   not sure if its as relaxed as horde though
---
its sodium chloride. thats what I said!

yeah lol test would never do that!

would have been 100x more interesting than episode VIII.  and less lore breaking.

If you check out my post history, you can see me harp about this on multiple occasions. That one single scene basically invalidated any need for the Death Star. Just have a bunch of shit rigged with hyperdrives and blast them through a planet

I feel like guiynan would have a simultaneous aneurism/heart attack/orgasm if he could see how well AFs perform in the current meta. 
---
Yeah, I was thinking that something like, Horde, Test or Brave (Brave is still around, I hope) where there are a lot of newbros might be a good fit. It would also hopefully give me a chance to roan around in some smaller, less expensive ships like T1 cruisers instead of only T3, HAC, pirate BS and capital blobs (though I wouldn't mind some of that either). 
---
You can even decide between shield and armor or both.
---
Go to 1DQ, get boson’d. Rinse, repeat.
---
Teneferis is okay, Querious is hit and miss, Wicked Creek is okay, vale depends, TEST space is also 25% nice fight 75% supers drop on you, FRAT generally blob but you can catch some stuff, BOT (and renter space in general) can lead to some weird shit and lots of fun.
---
I don't think you have a single idea what we are talking about :D
---
yeah.  and its even more idiotic that no one ever thought to do it before.

whoever made that scene had 0 foresight or hindsight besides money.

I approve of people making isk, and injecting rorqual super and titan pilots.  I saw this coming over a year ago, and got titan super and rorquals bpo printing isk as fast as people can inject.

There is Eve, the game you play using the Eve client, and then there is Eve, the game played via Reddit, forums, Discord, TeamSpeak, etc. They are two almost entirely different games.
---
Dreddit is recruiting -- and I'm not just memeing when I say that. Your capital experience will be put to good use and the activity requirements aren't bad. What you describe should fit in just fine. There are also several other corps in TEST that would happily work with you, too.

What's the process to join Dreddit like? I remember applying to a Corp in NC. about four years ago, and the process was about as involved as an actual job interview.

Well shit. The newbros grew up! And I remember camping several hundred of them in a station with a fleet of like 30 talwars and a few dictors at one point

&gt; Eh, clumping up isn't exactly needed for using them. I'd argue being spread out is more important for using them because then you've got ample warning to dock up.

^ To me the best part of being in BL.  Elo's pretty entertaining in fleets and he's a great FC, but I think one of the _best_ things about flying with him was his honesty about what he wants to do in the game.  Elo (and by association all of BL) is about having fun and getting better at blowing people up [study and practice]. No delusional narratives about smashing someone's space clan or controlling entire regions. It's beyond me why anyone playing a game like eve would hold narratives over _actual entertaining gameplay_ but i guess that's just me.

Ignore the snarky comments. As a recently new bro myself I was asking the question of when to go Omega and the conclusion I came to was to go omega when I "needed" to. That might sound obvious but the truth was, I was able to play the game comfortably for a solid month or two before I hit my first omega wall, other than the reduced training time (which doesn't matter as much as a low sp character anyways) it didn't effect my gameplay at all and if i had paid for the sub during that time I would have basically just been subbing to train skills at normal speed. 
---
So i'd say if you are enjoying the game, keep going as Alpha. When you start getting to the point were you are hitting your head against the sub barrier then you know it's time to pay up. But understand that subbing in itself itsnt going to drastically change the game. ccP actually is giving you a LOT of access to the game for free even with the skill and ship restrictions because the game isn't really about what ship you can fly its more about who you are flying with and what you are flying for.
---
Me for me I am currently spending most of my time in game grinding lvl 2-3 missions for standings in between doing lvl4 mission fleets with corp and a bit of low sec ratting to keep my funds up so that I can fly in roams with corp. For what I am doing right now, Omega status isn't necessary. However I did go ahead and sub after the 2nd month for faster skill training
---
nice to see what the dead terrorists have ben up too

I think it's a fine idea to join one of the mostly-open newbie alliances while you find your footing. Then as you go along, you can look around for other places/figure out exactly what you want to do.

---
Based on wat you're telling me, Caldari and Amarr are more active.
---
I also seeing that no one is suggesting Minmatar in this whole thread.
---
I think I've got it recorded but I haven't edited/uploaded it. I'll check tonight and see if i remembered to click record before it started. 
---
Also &lt;3 you Mikal! We appreciate the support and of course, the pew &lt;3
---
So there is not viable form of tanking?
---
Do Gooners rent?

#[reconquista intensifies]
---
Well it’s not the actual races/ships or factions logged in per say. It’s the space. I guess you could compare it to real estate. Certain regions are more active for various reasons
---
Yes but Alphas doesn't have the ability to cloak unless I go Omega which is a problem since I don't really want to spend real money.

There is a floor on price and that floor has been reached already.

If botting isn't proved by trial, bad them for being bad at Eve. CCPLS

Hmm, a sub-catalyst fleet?

I just want to know how he comes up with this shit...  He has me rolling.

Hi HypeSwarm, I'm here again annoying you.
---
I started using the new sheet and everything seems to work flawlessly.  
---
I have only one questions about the ESI pull since I didn't understand that completely.  
---
No all the characters added through ESI have their assets/indy pulled? Because I have some jobs running on multiples characters, but I cannot see everything.  
---
Am I missing something?
---
Thanks  
---
People will drop their supercats on the subcats.
---
Yeah, bring back local everywhere but Jita and wspace please. 
---
We had some good fun with horde last night! 
---
So only caracal fleets then? 
---
This, this is art.
---
I haven't played this game since 2005 but I sub because the politics, history, infighting, memeing, and evolving world is just so damn entertaining.
---
What if CCP turned off NPC bounties and released a good bounty system on Player Pilots simultaneously? 
---
Caldari because you spawn closer to jita saving time to skill inject cap pilots
---
I know how they feel last time I did a 12 month sub.
---
Im sorry for your loss Mrs. Jackson. I am foreal.

Hah, yeah, they're a totally different animal now. Old BRAVE still shines through sometimes but overall they're in a good place.

he's one of the few i've had consistent problems with, but then again they're all dogshit and anyone coming to replace him is dogshit

There very much is, there are modules that can improve your resistance, but between some people just being bad and not improving their resistance and only the base hp and the fact that there is a natural weakness for each tank, damage types can help you in fights quite a bit. For example, if someone has 1000 shield hitpoints, 10% resist in EM, and 50% resists in all other types, it would take 2000 raw damage from the other types to break his shields and only 1100 EM damage. This is also referred to as EHP (effective hitpoints).

&gt; 1 x wing disarming an entire dreadnought
---
but one griffin can disarm a carrier xd
---
do you understand the irony?
---

---
We should certainly assume that at this point the health of the game is "bad". There are at least 15-25% bots on at all times, probably much more in some areas.
---
I am four eels not a guy* 
---
It must be interesting to see.
---
Another thing I noticed when actually fitting this thing is the absurd access difficulty bonus, about 3x that of my t2 relic analyzer. From experience I've come to think this makes the minigame easier, but I think I need to test quite a bit.
---
Log in eve, have a chat with the alliance/corp bois, Stare at items in my hangar, stare at ship skins on the market, stare at chat, log off and do something useful. 
---
&gt;Im worried that my somewhat varied Corp history might paint me as a potential spy though, having been in Razor once upon a time, and NC. before I quit the game last time. Are there any alliances out there that might look past that fact abd which don't mind casual players that don't have the commitment to click 20 pap links a week (are PAP links still a thing?)?
---
You have been gone for a long time, like spy checking has become well non-existent at best people still check the API as a token action but realistically rolling spy's has become so trivial.
---
&gt;  I don't have as much time to play as I used to, maybe a few hours a day on weekdays and more on the weekends. Im in the Euro TZ. I'd like to find a corp or an alliance where I could hop in fleet, enjoy some fleet pvp for an hour or three, then log off again, or maybe log in and rat for a few hours to save up for the next welp. 
---
Honestly this is the majority of Eve right now, normal if you commit to a fleet you might get stuck on grid issue's apply. 
---

I joined Signal Cartel, and went exploring.
---
On my first outing, I got attacked, escaped at 11% structure and had to find someplace to repair in NPC nulsec.  Got hunted for half an hour, travelled through a LOT of nulsec (4 regions), and a little bit of lowsec (2 regions), and arrived "home" safely the following day.
---
Thanks, I guess I look more on the aesthetic look on the ship, faction ideology and the Lore. It must be why I'm so picky but also on the Alpha Clone's limited shiplines. I can't pick up T2/3 items or ships, for examples.
---
While is true that Capital ships like Dreadnought, Carriers and Titans are off limits, Battlecruisers and Battleships are my kind of ships
---
Nobody asked Mandark shit anyway. 
---
I start to lose track when people start talking in slang or acronyms out the ass. My eyes gloss over when people use the word PLEX for more than one meaning. 
---
Man, I jumped the Proving Conduit because I just wanted to see what it was compared to just ending the abyssal run. Sat for two minutes in my Ishtar when an Orthrus appeared. My Ishtar fit was very proficient at running the PvE content, but I was woefully unprepared for the PvP side of things. 
---
Thought I could tank him until the last three minutes were up (I was tanking him quite well for a while), until I noticed the timer stopped ticking and I'd be stuck there until one of us managed to kill the other. We just kinda sat there staring at each other for a while, me unable to do anything to him in my heavy-drone using, afterburner fit Ishtar, and him not being able to break my tank. I guess there's a stalemate breaker or something involved when that happens, because suddenly he broke through my tank really easily and I ended up in my pod. Was sat close enough to the gate that I could jump out when it opened up.
---
Looks like the Proving Conduit arena is a lot more competetive than I had expected. I am very impressed with the flying in the video, and it's nice to see the Triglavian ships being put to use after reading so much on the forums about how they all just suck and are way too expensive!
---
Thanks, I'll try my best as well :)
---
This was the feeling I was getting, and so far I have not "re-left" high sec. Just running a few buy and sell orders in Rens I feel like I am competing against 50% bots. 
---
I am not really sure what CCP can do about this, or what they desire to do about, since if 15 to 25% of the playerbase are botting accounts, actually cracking down on botting really hurts their bottom line. Of course, so does having a game people start to leave in droves because competing with bots is neigh impossible and un-fun. 
---
Dinobrain? My bad.
---
it's extremelu sad that the bar for "paying attention" is simply watching the screen, and still is such a big difference to be enough to balance it out.
---
I know you're joking, but I'm still triggered at the thought of a HAC with mining drones out in a belt somewhere.  
---
Generally you'll be flying what you're told to when it comes to larger-scale PvP. The BCs in vogue for fleets are the Ferox and Hurricane right now.
---
free lenny
---
How would CCP know which accounts are "alts" if they don't use the same email address as the main?
---
Maybe play eve a few years before opening that trap about the politics
---
not if you don't have the money to continually welp one after the other like you would bcs. Believe it or not most small gang players don't have the wallets of turbokrabs or the top AT alliances. The difference in isk lost is huge.
---
You're not in contro-ho-hol unless you're out of contro-ho-hol.

Your elite corps evacuated to the drone lands.... The DRONE LANDS if I was evacuated to that place I would find a new corp.
---
If working IRL is the most important thing to you maybe you should consider your life choices. Because, you know, that one thing you do that let's you eat, have a house, pay for fun stuff etc is probably not that important.
---
Eve’s biggest problem has always been power imbalance - there is really neither the incentives or will of the playerbase to upset the status quo. Recruiting and building a corp takes time, and you need healthy numbers before you can realistically push into null and hold ground. With GSF making life so comfortable and relatively open recruitment policies it’s difficult to gain numbers willing to go against the path of least resistance. There really is no upside for players in renter corps vs being assimilated into bigger alliance Corps and there is no longer any mechanism where they could reach critical mass and not just be farmed by bored alliance fleets with everyone blue. It’s zero fun to be farmed and the quickest way to destroy any growing corps morale so while everyone grrrs goons and the stagnant meta, we’re all to fundamentally well kept and comfortable in our alliances fortresses to ever try and start new things for ideological reasons. This is like the post WW2 Cold War where the power blocs like NATO and USSR became so powerful and comfortable the prospect and cost of MAD made war unpalatable, so all we have us small regional conflicts where a superpower goes and wtfpwn’s some tinpot dictatorship that is incapable of threatening their home kingdom.    
---
Tl:DR - the mass newbro sponges have created a generation of players comfortable being spoon fed, the original adventurers and rebellious individuals are long gone and sov mechanics favour entrenchment. Without CCP intervention to literally create a full blown war across null, low and hisec by introducing a must have winner takes all resource then we’ll continue to stagnate.
---
It's 125% bots tho.
---
People would just make neutral alts and literally kill themselves in game.
---
Many times easier to kill a BC. No comparison.
---
You should try joining a newbro corp like Pandemic Horde and go from there.    Most of us that played Eve for a while have multiple omega accts :)

What in the fuck is the abyssal arena?
---
Meanwhile wormholers keep their bearholes, literally making several billions an hour. Which is completely fine. Us nullsec folk with our absurd income of up to a couple hundred million/hour are the problem. For sure.
---
The absolute fury that spews forth because you cost them a 200k mining cycle really makes this joyous.
---
DUDE ! i always wanted to make a video with this song &lt;3
---
Don't ask for what you know only CCP has access to. If you play the game, you know it is true.
---
We grow'd a lot in the last year, that was a really nice 2018 for us :)
---
My time on r/eve has come to a close, I finally got Globby to respond to me after four long years of shit posting.
---
When I did my blops fleets regularly we'd hunt the surrounding area (1 cynos distance) and then go farther and farther depending which targets were juicy at that time of day. generally we'd travel three to four regions in like a 3 or so hour sitting. 
---
I use to be the XO of  Enlightened Industries “ENL-I”, now a goonswarm corp. 
---
Its a long story so stop reading now if you can’t be bothered.
---
Anyway when I joined as a noob it was mostly an industrial corp in Solitude mostly filled with EU tz players that had formed from Eve-Uni graduates or whatever led by Lovelocke. It was constantly being wardec’d by small gang pvp’ers who at the time seemed elite and popped us for fun.
---
 As a result of the constant wardecs the corp began to grow horns and began running very mixed fleets with marginal success and fleet commanders started to emerge.
---
Then came the great migration, our taste of pvp had made us curious and to get involved in what we thought would be real fights instead of docking games we left solitude. We left a number of indies behind, we took most of our noob welpers and in a corp fleet of haulers, batteships and tier 1 frigs we made the journey from solitude to SMA space. We were mostly noobs including myself and a fraction of experienced indies. Space Monkeys Alliance I believe were in PureBlind at the time (2011), so it was one hell
---
of a journey. 
---
Our time in SMA transformed us. The corp had to learn to adapt to living in null and our numbers quickly dwindled as people fled in their droves back to solitude or high sec. Many a ratting carrier or AFK’r was wiped out by lone wolves or roaming parties. The gangs we formed to expel invaders to SMA space usually resulted in complete welps.
---
After a while our recruitment methods changed, we became more selective of who we took and who we recruited and how we trained them, soon we were joining SMA fleets in the tens to join up with the hundreds of goons to fight NC. I believe over Tech. At the time this seemed huge but again we were largely mixed fleets joining uniformed doctrines of goons. Goons are goons but SMA were like local militia with pitchforks in comparison at the time.
---
Then our management wanted a bigger thirst for blood, SMA fleets were not regular enough and there was politics behind the scenes I was not privy too, we were told that we were off to Fountain, to fight for Test and we would be joining them. Again many a corpmate left to remain in SMA but we took a fraction of our indies and our the majority of our welps. ENL-I had become more disciplined in pvp and in its income sources and noob player development, we had outgrown SMA to a certain extent.
---
Then our Test story began, huge fights and regular, the corp grew huge with noob welps who we were training and we all grew up and learned alot from our time with TEST, I became head of recruitment and eventually XO for a time and soon we were competing with the top corps in Test with numbers on fleets and kills as our noobs went from the rifter doctrine welps to semi competent drakes/hurricanes pilots and high number of stealth bomber pilots and emerging cap pilot group. We were no longer novices to null, the thirst for titan killmails and SOV and lucrative moons and ratting grounds made our corp grow day after day and we were never pro’s or hardened but we had come along way.
---
Our secure null SOV in fountain as part of TEST started another industrial revolution in the corp as we started to grow in all manner of directions.
---
Then my journey with ENL-I ended, real life took over, I met my mrs, ENL-I had progressed alot and it was looking like if it continued to grow we could of had an alliance of our own one day. From my own perspective it feels like ENL-I peaked for me, we had a number of active cap pilots and fc’s and plenty of welps to throw around. 
---
However I wanted out, real life is real life. Not long after the corp id been in for years had gone from being ran by Locke to Alessadra &amp; Ghost. A pair who i had a huge amount of respect for and were great friends. Locke’s reason for leaving are his own but we remain in touch even to this day. I’m not sure what went on after me and Locke left but ENL-I was battling it out on either the side of the goons or the side of TEST for fountain, i’m not sure which but ultimately they ended up as Goons.
---
6 years on, Who ENL-I are now? I don’t know, are any of my old friends still there? I don’t know, i’d like to go back as a returning player but if denied i’d chose another direction. Why the switch from Test to Goons? That is not something I can answer but its a story, i’m sure many on here can fill in many of the blanks that I simply cannot.
---
I apologise for the boring waffle, but thats my story of being in ENL-I. For any that read on to the end, thanks.
---
Trapped in the Closet?
---
Oh wait, that's a different creep. 
---
Can't drop if out of range.....
---
yeah......always felt the ECM should scale with ship size. rather than letting small stuff jam giant ass ships.
---
doesnt make sense in its current state.
---
should make ECM additive rather than RNG.   like each addition ECM adds up to eventually be able to have a chance to ecm a ship.
---
and larger ships have stronger ECM per module.
---
I've got some too
---
So how's your brain cancer doing?  it's fully treated, then?
---
👏👏👏👏👏
---
Oh, I get it now.
---
And If I don't have those ships?
---
Tom Cruze is a fudge packer
---
I have yet to hear any particularly strong argument on how bots actually transfer money to CCP. Bots only consume plex. If you have 100% bots, they stay as long as plex last or until they realize no one is gonna buy isk. The accounting thing doesnt actually create more revenue, and bots have a cost in lost plex sales beacuse of RMT.

Gevlon Goblin was right.
---
tuzy when will the palatine be done
---
It's a little higher than that. You have to wait till the enemy fleet is _just_ about to apply damage to you. A second too early, and maybe your ADC saves you from 1 volley instead of 2. A second too late, and you never get to activate it at all, or you're bleeding structure/armor your logi can't rep. That window is different for missiles and turrets, and wider against inexperienced/poorly disciplined fleets (who might be locking up the secondary too early, or firing before the FC calls it if your FC is snap counting). Yeah it's all "paying attention" but what it really comes down to is knowing what to pay attention for.
---
Not to mention that bots drive the cost of plex way up which pushes real players out of the game.  Real players who might have made more accounts if they had stuck around.
---
You're assuming how the bounty system would work. 
---
Basically. There was like a week before UALX that we were sov wanding and we all _hated_ it. It isn't what we want to do, it doesn't generate fights we want, and you don't get "better" at it outside of throwing more bodies at it. The only objective we have is to have a good fight and try to win more than we lose. That's why I think it's so funny when people talk about Branch in the context of Sov - I don't give a shit about sov. Elo doesn't give a shit about sov AFAIK. So then why was everyone harping about how we didn't take any systems?
---
I play the game and I don't know it's true. There are lots of bots. There are lots of alts. 15-25%? That's just a number you made up because it captures the right mix of "when I roam nullsec it's pretty empty" and "reddit frequently gets outraged about dozen+ person botting corps"
---
The guy who developed this new chat system apparently left, so in a way it is legacy now.
---
well as an alpha you're screwed unless you allocate your limited sp maximum into doctrine ships for whomever you fly with
---
Between all the alts and bots, the actual EVE server population at any one time would probably fit into a large bar......
---
With a huge power supply, internet access, and beer refrigerator of course.
---
[Griffins too stronk](https://youtu.be/ruxQfb-BO1Q)
---
Would 25-50% been more to your liking?
---
It is obviously an estimation based on the information I get from playing the game. Why would I exaggerate the number?
---
If you want to go full-autistic mode, yes. - But part of the fun of Eve (at least for me) is the random convos with fellow capsuleers.
---
; )
---
i mean, everyone competent is leaving ccp
---
Jackdaw best daw...
---
Since returning, outside the big pillars of newbro alliance centres the rest of the game space feels empty. Certainly there aren’t anywhere near the volume of carebears running round hisec (which is probably a byproduct of the newbro alliances soaking up recent joiners for years and taking them to the front line.) There is an easy way to quantify it - look at the number of jumps / activity on Dotlan and the number of active pilots on zkill We can assume a good chunk of market alts, Indy’s etc are alts of other players so the actual active PvP roster gives a good indication how many ‘real’ pilots are active.this reddit sub also seems to be a fraction of what it was during the Clever Girls rage fest of 16 and the official forum is completely dead.
---
You know what’s shit? Getting a Leshak alpha’d off field and not immediately fucking off, and allowing 2 Nestors and another Leshak to get killed. We warped to a ping and then back after each. 
---
come to O-V.   or start shooting the jump gate in BWF.   
---
please make sure we not on a strat op. use your horde spy alt we know you have to check on that.
---
I've often thought doing this, running around behind HS incursion fleets...
---
0.01Ly
---
At some point at a fanfest they had shown a graph about that - it was somewhere around 1.5 accounts per player.
---
Let me introduce you to ansiblex jump gates.

But otherwise you’re right, small groups can much more easily find content

I actually took a two year break to get some help and get my life together. Have a nice job, wife, and a sweet little girl I care for now. Ty for the concern though. Fly safe friend :D

---
So what you're telling me "Go Omega or you're screwed."
---
At least for a while once you know what you need. Alphas can train up to about 5m SP. Alphas can USE a list of skills that add up to about 20m SP. If you go omega to train those alpha skills up you can still use them as an alpha later.

Haha came to post this. 
---
Why the fuck would you use a T1 scan frig when you never use any of it? Use the destroyer for the better cargo and 8 high slots and stop listening to this guy 
---
Yeah, was very sad to watch :(
---
I'm curious (and this is an actual question), how that info is viewable from dotlan if you don't own the space you're staging in?
---
Trust me, we'd find a way...
---
It seems everyone has a couple alts these days. Some have only 2, others 5 and some alt-aholics 10+. When it says 30k people online, its around 5k real people.
---
When I first started playing I joined Eve University and the help channel and people there were very helpful.
---
&gt;  I suspect the majority of these numbers are alt accounts 
---
A paid account is a paid account. Trying to determine which are "alts" is fairly fucking insane, to be quite honest.
---
Is my titan pilot my main? 
---
Is my main the character with the most skill points?
---
What about my pilot that can fly every subcap, and 2 types of supercarriers?
---
Which one of these is the alt?
---
Impossible question is impossible.
---
I will ask corpies if any of them have one.
---
Killboards aren't really a good way to measure this, either, considering many people dual, triple, or morebox for pvp.
---
got about a minute in before i closed the video because of that vape trick video in the bottom right. why would you include that...
---
So do any subcaps if you use *enough* bombs.
---
But it takes significantly more bombs to kill HACs than their equivalent BC.
---
Watching videos like this make we wish these sites spawned in USTZ...

The Brave Collective Wiki also has a page with a basic (though I'd say pretty comprehensive) list of EVE Acronyms: [https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/wiki/acronyms](https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/wiki/acronyms)
---
Ignore this guy's offer, I'll pay a whopping 3b and I'll even come to pick it up. 
---
No one really cares which one is your main just how many actual people play eve. You sir missed the point.
---
RIP Michael Jackson?
---
Then that would be a problem. I can't pay up for a Omega subscription..
---
Then you need to be VERY careful about what you train.
---
Sure. Wait. No. 
---
Open task manager while eve is running, right-click the eve executable, select "open file location"
---
How so? Is it dreads in general that are dead and useless, or is it just the Moros specifically that's a bad dread? It used to be the best one!
---
guaranteed one of them does.
---
Hordes got so many spies, its what we rely on for content coming to us.

what, your micropenis?

There is actually spicy drama behind this, but I suspect they will change websites soon, or the issue will be resolved.

From frigates to supers, you pick the comp, we win. Deal with it.

Wow interesting read, and also thank you everyon who responded to this post. I have learned a lot about eves history and I am very impressed by the vast history of this game. I look forward to flying with all of you guys. o7

Everybody and their dog has a super and FAX (triage for supers) alt now so dreads just get deleted off grids as soon as they materialise in most cases. There's still use for them in some niche cases where you think you can beat the response fleet time.

Slowcats are obviously completely dead since carriers don't get RR bonuses for a long time now.

Most people tend to lose ships before they need to refill ammo.   
---
Exception: Structure bashing, Super/Rorq hunting, Mission Running, Ratting.   
---
In short, yes. T1 Crystal Ammo should last forever. T2/Faction will break after enough usage and you will eventually need more. As Trepnock said, you will probably need Cap Boosters depending on your fittings, which are effectively a type of ammo to keep your guns shooting. Everything needs to be replenished from time to time if you are good at not losing ships. Newer players should try and avoid unnecessary loss by stuffing their cargo completely full of ammo. 
---
Agreed! This is quality shitposting, indeed.

I don’t think this is the subreddit to talk about the meaning or purpose of life but....if you are only focused on work, no hobbies, no family, no social life, work is the only thing that brings meaning to your life and without work you would just “quit” life....then maybe you need to revaluate your life just a tiny bit🤷🏼‍♂️just my 2 isk
---
Well, that escalated slowly. 
---
Oh, how do you fund your PvP then? Credit card?
---
For sure but I have 3 accounts (2 supercaps) and all 3 are omega subbed because any isk I get I spend and subbing is cheaper than plexing. If I was brain goo farming or afk multiboxing I’d be plexing those accounts and skimming any profit, so while it won’t give you an accurate indication of player count it will give you a better indication of subs that don’t purely exist as Plex funded isk farms which always get shut down when Plex goes too high to make it profitable. What I mean is - my 170m sp character can’t be skill injected at a reasonable price and almost all skills are omega dependent, so for monthly subs rates it’s the cheapest sp/money conversion and I tend to keep it subbed even when winning Eve to do all the painful 3m SP level V capital stuff. Same with my secondary supercap at 150m+ and my main PvP character. Everything else like cyno alts/industry/invention/krab fleets are only needed when active and don’t need any skills doing unless it’s profotable to brain farm them - so in terms of stable income that isn’t tied to Plex and isk the number CCP should care about is active PVP pilots especially ones that can’t skill inject at a decent rate since they are the most reliable recurring income and most likely to switch to pay monthly subs if Plex prices get too high rather than unsub.

Let's take a step back for a second. You are seriously arguing right now that because we do not know the actual number of bots in the game that it's perfectly legitimate for you to make one up based on your own experience. How about instead we simply - and sit down, cause this is gonna be a shock - don't assume any specific number or degree about the prevalence of botting in eve? It could be 10%. It could be 50%. It could be 90%. It could be 1%. You and I literally have _no fucking idea_ what the real number is - and that's not a justification to just make it up.
---
Just to show you that when you create something you add to the rich quilt of New Eden's lore.
---
Mikal you're never gonna guess who this is :D
---
Hint - fuck CRISPR and fuck not diluting your reagents
---
“Trust me, we'd find a way...”
---
Just about sums up eve as a whole
---
&gt;what the true measure of health for the game is...
---
That’s a broad set of values with many being difficult to measure. Honestly the best way to probably look at it would be to generate some kind of “fun per hour per person”. Even then it’s still subject to things that are inherently going to be a part of the game as a sandbox.
---
&gt;home many actual individuals are actually playing (or at least logged-in to) EVE at any one time.
---
The data is a bit old, and does miss some major changes in the game, but the previously statistic that CCP Quant have last I saw (mind you I’m pretty sure it has been updated almost every year I just can’t fjnd it right now) was 1.35 accounts per player. Assuming my napkin math is somewhere in the ballpark, that means at any given time you could expect 1/4 to 1/3 of accounts online to be players. This varies greatly as alts are not always needed or used and sometimes all the alts will be logged in.
---
&gt;This is quite obviously information CCP does not want people to have...
---
It necessarily. It may be simply more accurate to assume they just don’t regularly put that info out. Either from laziness or a lack any real need to. You also need to understand that finding out these numbers isn’t an entirely accurate process for various reasons, as Quant says himself.
---
&gt;which says to me that actual individual account owners are way, way down from say 2008.
---
That’s a possibility, but a very pessimistic assumption tbh.
---
Link to the post I’m refering to btw: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3j7nso/at_least_we_know_how_many_alts_there_are/cun2q2o/
---
And yes I’m aware I’m bad at math.
---
There are three options: 
---
1. It's a contract you made but didn't sell &amp; expired. Right click on it in your Contracts window and it'll give you the 'delete' option (refunds the item and removes the contract).
---
2. It's a completed contract you sold/bought that won't go away from your 'requires attention' list. If you have the Get Isk/Items button, use that to claim your stuff. If you've already done this, then tough luck, you must wait until the other party also claims their isk/items. It is a pain, especially with so many unloved station traders taking months to check on their completed contracts.
---
3. It's a contract you bid on and lost and is annoying you every log-in. There is no hope. It's a known bug since October (they have marked it as such in bug reports, so they know it's a fault), but to date no update on if/when it'll be fixed and no known workaround. It may be linked to a type 2, where once both parties involved claim their guff it releases all those innocent bystanders, but I personally have one still bugging me from the drop that caused it nearly 3 months ago so dunno if they're just extra lazy or it's with me forever.
---
I was a sad panda when y’all landed within our Ferox engagement range but we fleet warped off as the Tornados landed.

I am a member of a large corp with some several hundred characters. I can tell you that the ratio of mains to alts in the corp is about 2.8 characters per main. Those are just counting the in corp characters and does not account for alts on the same account. From the size of the corp, I think the sample is large enough to extrapolate to the general state of most corps.
---
There are many people with just one main, and then there are a few with dozens of alts. The data shows that the median number of alts in my corp is between 2 and 4 accounts (and maybe a few additional alts in corp).
---
It is one of the largest corps in the game, but this is Eve so I may be bullshiting. No guarantees. 
---
The mittani , is not my lover?
---
Guess you need to comprehend what you read... I'm okay with scams, but the consequences currently in game are crap. There needs to be better recourse for a scammed player to take. Most scammers will just stay docked or play one of their 30 other accounts. 
---
question. who the fuck commissioned it 
---
for science ofc
---
not ironic at all.
---
she was such an incompetent commander that in a panic situation instead of keeping her charges calm and under control, she instead provoked one, and caused everyone else to question if theres a plan or if they are all screwed.   and thus lead to a mutiny.
---
a commander who doesn't keep control of their crew, is not a commander, they're a failure.     and one who decides to play alpha monkey instead of keeping a level head and keeping everyone calm, well...historically they've usually lost their ships and been left in lifeboats to row back to britain and low their commission, while their officers either get hung, forced to resign, or demoted to private.
---
don´t ask ahahah  hahahaha happy new year bro
---
thanks  for those words  happy new year

and plenty of air freshener 
---
\\o/ yeah bro just future will tell   and when that happen i can see many other from where i am playing eve 
---
ty ty  thanks you are amazing  
---
As for race it doesn’t matter so I’ll just touch on some ships that are useful for beginners.
---
Vexor Navy Issue is probably the best isk maker and overall cruiser for any alpha and indeed omega. They can do anomalies virtually AFK by fitting a large afterburner and letting their Heavy drones chew through everything automatically.
---
T1 frigs are great for solo pvp and in faction warfare. They are cheap and you can become a very good pilot in lowsec by taking these out and learning the fundamentals, beyond any 0.0 line member. These include the Executioner, Tristan, Breacher, Kestrel, Merlin, Arron and some others I’m forgetting. There is a bit of Rock Paper Scissors to them, some are great at kiting, some better at getting in your face and others are more versatile.
---
Other than that if you are looking to join a corporation they will likely have skill plans you can follow since they will have ‘doctrines’. Each doctrine contains a set of ships that will fill a desired purpose. When a fleet is formed an FC will want you to bring one of the desired ships in the doctrines.
---
Who's forbidding scams? You? Surely not me. I'm pointing out the fact that a player can steal from a corp billions to trillions of assets and literally not face any recourse for his actions. We're giving the risk to trust, but not letting scammers risk anything. Scammers can just stay docked or use another account. That's not realistic at all, especially when you are weighing the time and effort of hundreds of players against 1 thief that has access to everything. There are all sorts of scams, the problem is most have no way for players to seek revenge. If you're okay with scams, you damn well better be okay with revenge. Otherwise, you're being a hypocrite. Currently, there's far too many ways for revenge to be circumvented by the scammer. Thus... "scams are a disgusting scar on this game."  You people need to think before replying with bullshit. 
---
Rough guess? 104,000 human beings. How did I get there? I used the amount of people subscribed to this reddit. Now, not everyone that plays eve goes on this reddit, nor does everyone that is on this reddit play eve. That being said it should about balance out for a 'rough' number.

---
Limited time so you need little or no activity requirements=Horde
---
NC. in your history=Horde
---
Want to jump into the game and instantly get action=Horde
---
Honestly, right now more than half of eve (goons+test) are screwing around in Horde space so there is lots of action to be had. The only people purged by Horde are generally people who are dicks, or people who don't login for months, so you won't get purged or ridiculed for limited activity. You can also fly alongside NC and Pandemic Legion. If you know any goons/test, you can kill them or be killed by them regularly. Win win.

Sorry I'm not taking this seriously after you complained about feminists in Star Wars, lmao.

Also:

I would expect a person who likes star wars this much to know about the Tarkin Doctrine and it's effect on the Empire's ship design.
---
Death star lost to a single x-wing because of a design flaw and relying on TIE-fighters instead of point-defense: I sleep.
---
A freighter making circles around an Imperial Star Destroyer because of insufficient point-defense: I sleep.
---
The pride of the Imperial Navy, one of the few biggest ships in the fleet, the Executor, lost to a crashed A-wing because of a design flaw and insufficient point-defense: I sleep.
---
Death Star II lost to a single freighter because of insufficient point-defense: I sleep.
---
A ship derived from the Empire's design book of "Intimidation = big guns &gt; all-roundness and point-defense" losing it's insufficient point-defense to a modified X-wing able to get under those guns: REAL SHIT????????????
---
That's a great offer and I might have taken it up if I had been able to log in
---
Wouldnt it be nice.
---
If you are okay with scams, then explain to me how a player can seek revenge on the scammer?  Because, you can't be okay with one and not the other. And current game mechanics far benefit the scammer. Right now, there are probably thousands of players given trust to corp or alliance assets and can take it all away with a few clicks. My stance on this is that anyone who gets scammed should be able to seek revenge, however you and all of Eve know that's not true. It's near impossible. So yea, bud... I disagree with you too. I'm not against scams, but I think you should realize they get zero recourse. That's broken and goes against everything Eve stands for... thus, it diminishes the game.
---
Because it says that another alliance owns the system skill urself lives in. You can also see it ingame by visiting the system, or by viewing the system's show info window.

The way you keep a F2P MMO profitable is you attract whales, to attract whales you need low effort at high cost p2w mechanics and a theme park that rewards how much you spend vs how good a player you are. It’s clear to see that skill injectors were the first step down that path with a bunch of restraints to placate the angry bitter vets long enough until they all were replaced by new players born on skill injectors addiction. The cerebral booster is the next step now the class of 16 is hitting the limits of what they can inject, the bittervets are gone so they’ll do away with skill extractors and brain farms and straight out sell you omega injectors from 5 USD to 500 USD on the store. Of course you’ll need a big enough incentive so getting a Titan or mommyship should take care of a good 25m injector sale opportunity, and what better way to encourage you than seeing all those dank ticks you’ll be earning in your new lolmobile. Then you’ll be so happy with your new lolmobile you’ll want to buy a new skin for it, and maybe a matching pilots suit. We can’t have any of the non-profit making alpha scrubs upsetting our whales into quitting, so we’ll buff the ever living shit out of it so the whales can farm them for content because let’s face it, they didn’t pay anything so why should they have any fun? We’ll let isk inflate so only our big spending injector whales can afford anything useful, thus converting more frustrated fish into big spending whales. Player count doesn’t matter because we can just create more theme park npc attractions that amuse our whales, upping the difficulty to keep them buying those new skill injectors.   
---
They’ll fudge a little nerf here and there to keep people from raging but look at where we started and look at where we are now and tell me seriously CCP isn’t looking at all those titans and skill injectors and thinking LOOKS LIKE 1000 USD MONACLES ARE BACK ON THE MENU BOIS.    
---
Tldr: CCP no longer cares about isk inflation or balance, it’s about providing whale buying opportunities to meet that 450m USD valuation bonus using the Rockstar School Of Money Printing shark card model. The alpha F2P was to shut up all the ‘but muh free game time from isk grinding’ brigade allowing them to do what they wish they’d done in the first place - charge for SP in injector packs so we could feast our brains with that lovely dopamine hit of instant rewards. Rat bounties are cashback for whales - the more SP you buy, the more isk you can make to buy shiny things, just not the shiny things you’ll pay cash for.
---
This is the reality of Eve’s future, and it was EA lootboxes and GTA sharkcards that got us here, because let’s face it, if Rockstar can get people to spent 70 odd dollars on a black fucking horse then CCP must be thinking ‘I wonder if we could actually get 1700 real dollars for selling a in game Titan....’
---
akshully gankers use neutron blasters, they're and they're called catalysts.
---
&gt;If you're okay with scams, you damn well better be okay with revenge.
---
Of course, everyone here loves a good tale of revenge. And revenge plots are more than viable for someone who is determined enough. It sounds to me like you'd rather have a third party like CCP keep you safe than take steps to ensure your own safety. 
---
Either way, I'm sure nothing I say will ever change your mind. I'll drop this discussion now, rest assured that it is in almost nobody's interest to have CCP interfere with the various cloaks and daggers of New Eden, and enjoy watching fools get separated from their money. Have a good day.

you are making it sound far more involved and deterministic than it actually is, it is vastly more likely that the thing dictating wheter you can or cannot get 2 volleys in one activation is how well the other side is coordinating their shots(ironically being better the sloppier they are in this case), and not how clutch your adc activation is. In fact i'd go as far as to say that it's impossible to do what you are describing with any consistency due to latency and the UI only updating once every 30 years(and the grid updating on a different time than the overview to boot), making far more likely that nerds will just die before activating their adc, many times for no fault of their own.  It's a 15 sec bubble in a game that runs at 1 second ticks, not ryu's parry.

Id play a bit first get a hang of the basic then if u can afford it cash in some plex buy some ships/skill injectors and get into af/dessies and cruisers. Ull have fun and be competitive make sure u train for the gunnery and tankin skills to go along with whatever path you choose.

This is a very fun and competitive game when you get in with the right bunch of people.

I just don't feel like PGL salivating over high-sec market-share for Injectors is something that would make it into the next 'This is EVE' video. 
---

---
You can be competitive (in PvP terms) soon after starting because most of us aren't very good at the game and an alpha frig/destroyer can be quite effective. Get somebody to mail you an invite for 250K free skillpoints.
---
wrt PLEX: you might buy 240 or 500 to use on your first raft of ships. If you do that, I would allocate some of the ISK to get your ships &amp; fittings hauled to a place with active PvP (or to your group's staging). You'll die a lot, and flying back and forth between trade hubs and PvP hotspots is boring as fuck.
---
Dunno about specifically-Polish new player groups, but you look to have enough English to get on alright in any of the big new player groups (Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Brand Newbros, Karmafleet, etc) and they'll all have people around in your timezone.

I do fishing in Red Dead Online. It’s exactly like mining in Eve, in that you find a nice spot and have a relaxing fish then some passing cunt headshots you, kills your horse, steals your fish and runs away.

You can be competitive, but not against everyone and everything (logically). Eve isn't a PvP game like Starcraft or Dota, you will face people more prepared and more skilled than you and it will be unfair. Actually most of Eve PvP rely on putting yourself with unfair advantage towards others. That being said you can also be the one more prepared, as it required good understanding of the game mechanics and their application, and you can also be more skilled than others and win that way. I'm 2 years into the game, and I still struggle to manage my modules and ships when I have more than 3 active modules to use.
---
Eve is really complex and offers a lot of possibilities. You won't be able to reach them all starting now as skill points are really slow to grind when you starts you, but with farming (and/or RL money) you can close that gap. That being said, skill points don't buy you real skill, only practice does. Once you get the bare minimum skills, SP became more about specialization and less about +5% damage or some stuff like that.
---
There are several videos of PvPiers showing off ships and fits for brand new players and doing great with them, you should look at them.
---
Also fair warning, get into a small active corp in low sec or wormholes. It generally is the best way to end up with skilled players ready to teach you if you show the will to.
---
Yeah, Highsec for TEST is such a colossal failure, we're only making 300b a month out of it lmbo.
---
I disagree. There have been several fights between us and test with even numbers and even logi where we held and they didn't. As an almost always logi pilot, I can tell when people hit their adc late or too early. In many cases the only ships we lose are people who didn't hit their adc or hit it late. It really does make a difference.

That’s fucking epic lol. If they basically reskin that with the pre-renders from Eve, drop in the L4 copy written by the beta work experience boy then I’d sit there all night watching that shit. 
---
Join brave my bro. All corps worth at least 1/2 shit use outside program for coms. going to have to rip that bandaid off sooner or later
---
Pretty much this.  The big thing about EVE is that it doesn't really tell you shit; it's content to let you do the same boring thing over and over.  You have to work sometimes to find what you enjoy, but there are so many things out there.  Once you find it, omega is definitely the way to go, but it won't make you magically find something to do, you have to figure that out yourself.

This doesn't do by time but is really useful and you can manually add /time/year etc http://mossworks.xyz/zkillsearch/

Come to huola / kourm / lamaa and join DnG or DHSJ or Schneckt, respectively. There's constantly fights going on in our staging systems or a few jumps away, and as a member of any one of those groups you'll have some corpies willing to help you murder people. 
---
I would do it for that reason alone :-)
---
I don't remember but I do remember this is how they paid me: https://i.imgur.com/OZDDouO.jpg

I was trying to figure out how to hawk goods in jita for two weeks after that
---
I don't agree that his character was ruined, but I agree that he was good in TFA, when he was actually on screen in his 3 minutes of time.
---
His speech in this video is probably my favourite scene in The Force Awakens.
---
How much have you got from it? 
---
I think Snuff's opinion on the usefullness of Dreads would differ quite siginificantly...
---
D'aww extra butt-touches from Schneckt to you next time you come hang in comms &lt;3
---
And for the record, the only sober thought I remember from New Years Eve was "I'll bet if I turn my MJD on, I can kill Dato's Slasher." I think that means I can tell people I caught your Slasher in a Proph with two plates and no MWD, but I'm not sure. That's my story though, and I'm gonna stick with it &lt;3
---
yes 19 assfrigs tend to kill a battleship
---
His Cheeks are not Red enough.
---
Miniluv did a few years ago
---
He lets other men have sex with his wife? 
---
Just join brave my man. Been flying with them for 5 years straight. Never looked back
---
Haaaaa thanks my man, btw i fkin dig your GNI fit &lt;3
---
I found/started eve through reddit, can I stay? 
---
I think there is no point from which it is not the moment anymore to join EVE. One way or another, you'll find a place eventually. Keep in mind that you'll not be able to be competitive with everyone (neither do I who play since 2011), but it's okay and it's the game. 
---
Ideally, start with the basics as an alpha, shall you prefer PvP or PvE is up to you, and once you feel confident enough, take the step and upgrade to Omega, that's all I can say. 
---
I'm not even worried 15-25% would be massively incorrect. It's probably too modest.
---
The only reason someone would say 1% is to downplay the problem.
---
&gt;You and I literally have no fucking idea what the real number is - and that's not a justification to just make it up.
---
I have a fucking idea actually.
---
What is your point? You wanna do nothing because "we just dont know how many"? That's basically the outcome your argument allows for.
---
Go back and point out where I said we should do nothing. I'll wait right here.
---
These guys will pretty much always cap escalate which is what we were expecting here, hence the size and comp of our fleet
---
Salvaging another's wreck incurs no suspect timer on you, so a player who shoots you for doing so will be under normal CONCORD rules (i.e. they get wiped from space in a hurry).
---
CONCORD response times depend on the system security level, anywhere from 5-20 seconds or so.
---
Right, because in EvE, PvP is about getting each individual member rich! 
---
I'll wait for your answer right here.
---
BOO THIS MAN
---
yes / depends on what sec you're in / 
---
I got 500b in Horde killmails rofl. How much did you get from defending botters in Branch?
---
Leshak pilots were SRP'd from the trillions in profit made in Tranquility Trade Tower.   
---
Wasn't Daras only like 9 supercarriers, anyway? I remember getting my Aeon out safely.
---
So I was ganked the other day in 0.8 system but his death to concord never appeared on zkill?  How would he survive that?  Not war decced.  I wasn’t suspect.  I did have a bounty... would that do it?
---
Hopefully she comes back at some point, i used to sell her all my DED site loot at decent prices and faster than market. 
---
You seem to have a habit of assuming things without any evidence. Read up on my original reply to you where I agree that there are a lot of bots. The solution to botting is to eliminate easily repeatable pve. Bots are a byproduct of an easily parsed UI and chain farmed sites, missions, or activities. I'm not a miracle worker, though - I've got no solution for you being a drooling moron.
---
1 Hyperion, 2 Devoters, 1 Loki, 2 Gnosis, 1 Legion, 1 Tengu vs 1 Raven (Bait) and cyno in Panther too, too bad for them, their blop didn't work out.
---
His lossmail will only show up if his toon/corp is API linked to Zkill
---
Tbh you seem like the common denominator of dogshit here. 
---
did i gank a freighter of yours? you've been following me around quite a bit salty buddy :)
---
Couple hours on most weekdays and even more on weekends isn't really that casual tbh. That's probably more than the average nullsec linemember plays (at least when not on campaign), so you should be totally fine. I think Goons are the only alliance that actually work with Pap links and those requirements are more of a "if you're afk for half a year we'll purge you" kind of thing. For example Karmafleet requires 3 Paps per quarter iirc.
---
You don't really need to join a newbie alliance / corp just because you've been gone for a couple of years either. Like you already know how the game works, you know how fleets work and all. Catching up on the things that have changed since you went afk shouldn't be that big of a deal and you don't need to be in Karmafleet / Brave / Horde with somebody holding your hand 23/7.
---
Regarding the Corp history: nobody really gives a fuck. if you can present any kind of reasonable story as to why you left, you're good.
---
TLDR: 90% of nullsec will accept everybody with a heartbeat, so stop worrying that much
---
We made you form on Christmas, and blueballed you. Worth it
---
Everyone knows it's bad luck to shoot at Signal Cartel. 
---
If you just got zkill points why dont you brag about that rather than a 2nd hand brag from your alliance bigwigs. 
---
Playing EvE for last 6 months, it made sense to me ;(
