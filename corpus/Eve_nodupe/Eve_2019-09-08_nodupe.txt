And corvette cynos wouldn't be useful in a fight because they’d be instablapped

rule #1 in an eve reddit fight, the second you mention how good your killboard looks you forfeit.
---
Sorry for triggering you bud.
---
When is your NDA up?
---
Ccp pls kill market esi
---
I see huge variety nowadays tbh. It's exciting when fleet comp can be so loose
---
but what if i don't want to get in the boy's hole?
---
only if you are willing to jump to notoriously squishy, expensive, easy to kill ships that might get insta popped and get half your fleet scattered all over the place resulting in a fleet welp before you fire a single fucking shot, what a "great" fight that would be... There's not an FC with a brain in this game that will roll that D20 post cyno change.

Great artwork.  Respect, friend.  o7

Is that 6 or 7 distruptors on a rorq that is in panic, with siege and cyno up? 
---

---
FFS you pvp guys are awful
---
Yes, I am the one triggered, not the one flying off the handle and calling people retards and cucks lmao. You are definitely 100% stable and rational
---
Thanks for taking the time, I really appreciate it.
---
Your post was very insightful! There is indeed a timezone issue, as I live on the east cost and they are on the other side of the planet. The corp I joined is based in North America but the alliance is not, and I did not know that when I joined. 
---
And yeah when I joined I didn't know much, and I still have a lot to learn. But they don't really have the patience to teach anyone, and I get that, but it sucks.
---
I'll find someone to fly with and I'll actively try to find a place that's a better fit. Thanks again!

And so you prove the point that it is not broken forever.

That's assuming there is no cyno inhib on grid.

Only ones who can shake up the PVP metagame is us.
---
Can't you read. Metagame means beyond the game.
---
You seem pretty invested in pushing for CCP to buff a ship you like though?
---
Pyfa. You should check it out and learn to fit ships yourself.
---
Welcome to EVE shitheel.
---
&gt;where people bridge their subcap fleets into system...
---
Do your eyes even work?
---
I too spend my time doing things I don’t enjoy....
---
Definitely not triggered 👌
---
I know goons haven't used them in a while... But the rest of plebian Eve knows about these things that used to be in the game pre-2017. *Gates*
---
You can't in the UK either, custom plates have to be a valid existing plate under the numbering rules.
---
OP is trying to suggest they pulled of some elite maneuver by jumping into panfam home
---
Maybe you could like make friends instead in whatever mega coalition your in and save your self an alt
---
bUt tHe bOtS
---
100 people who will love to wait hours to get 1 mn of rape... fun, sorry.
---
Seriously, there is no new ways to play the game in what you say. It is only how to do correctly the second job, but maybe it is how you see EVE even unconsciously.
---
I would rather shoot 80 POSes in each shockpoint system to get the sovereignty like in 2007, at least I would have the impression to do something and the enemy is more likely to come defending, so there would have a fight.
---
Yeah, I've been doing something similar with Retributions to get better at manual piloting. I still suck, but in a couple dozen kills I'll be on the all time top 100 list, lol
---
Ah yes the military arguement.
---
What the hell is that going to do
---
I know people like yourself who don't live or regularly fight in nullsec don't know this, but jumping through a bubble fucked gate in nullsec into bombers, caps and other pre-setup fleets is suicide. Which is why a lot of fights in null start by bridging in your fleet so you don't feed half of it just getting into system.
---
yea im saying the OP is delusional yes (i shoudlve mentioned that in the original comment sorry) , but people thinking frigates arent worth dropping caps over is false, since people are actually dropping caps on frigates
---
Not at all just responding to an intellectually deficient individual who is asking CCP to change shit for change sake.
---
Game has never been more balanced at the subcap level than it is today. Only thing that needs a look is Capital vs Subcapital relationship....which CCP has been working on and monitoring.
---
Create a friend?
---
And I know people like yourself, that haven't actually ever done any of their own pvp, don't know this, but there's counters to that. But goons are the best so I'm sure it won't be a problem :)))
---
😂
---
Ideally there'd be something similar... "If your cyno is fit to a ship, it stays a good ol' fashioned cyno (now covert-use only). If it is unfit or on a station floor it changes to an industrial cyno."
---
But then again, the carrier-&gt;FAX change was announced days ahead, in a dev blog *and* patch notes if I remember right. So odds of that now...
---
At minimum you will know where the NPCs are killed most of the time, so getting a target there is likely right now or the next days.
---
The Average players in 30 mn after few analysis also reveal where are the most populated area, and so the possible decent areas of hunting.
---
The preys can't benefit this intel as there is no way to see the hunters this way, as the time they stay in a system is well under said delay. Even the ships/pod killed in the last hour can't be really useful for that, as any home defense or bad encounter or any afk raped player can affect this number and make it meaningless.
---
The only intel it gives is where to shoot preys, while the prey lost the only interesting intel they had.
---
So the hunters is as the advantage now. In fact I shouldn't even say that it should be delayed. It should be fully removed, period.
---
They would have pushed some shit in for sure.  A non-spodbrained orca pilot can dish out some pain.
---
It's always Sunny in wormholes
---
Sorry for using hyperbole
---
Ah right, i like white elephants
---
&gt;also i could fit up a pvp bomber for less them most pve ships so don't give me that bullshit about cost
---
it's also very ineffective depending on the meta
---
&gt;nice try with the risk shouldn't count for pvp rewards
---
player driven rewards cannot be balanced
---
such information :O
---
Can you buy me an at ship so I can PvP ??
---
Yeah but that's eve basically. Otherwise you're just playing COD with a New Eden back drop.
---
You cannot do it at no cost to you, thus a rookie ship is a no no.  A t1 frigate however is fair game, since the tactic can be used on both sides.
---
it was semiafk gila btw ;-)
---
" that haven't actually ever done any of their own pvp "  
---
Because you know the names of all my alts and read them before making that completely off base comment right?

---
Great stategy there buddy.
---
&gt; and got caught by lucky 3rd party ;)
---
I will give credit to Ehefkae, if you have a hole connecting to theirs, they will have some bored dude cloaky camping in a Sabre waiting. It was no more than three weeks ago that I had one of their Sabres narrowly miss my DST with 4b in loot on board. I had to sit there cloaked, cheeks-clenched "calmly" asking for people to save my stupid ass
---
Yes! Youtube that shit!
---
You know, they make more money from people subbing their accounts via plex.
---
Okay, first of all, someone that isn't full of shit and *does* PvP doesn't reply with "dO u KnOw My alTs?!!?!" Secondly, your main doesn't have over 10 kills in anything non-doctrine lmao. Have some self awareness, quit while you're ahead
---
Some people are playing the players, not the game.
---
So that would be a no then, cool. [https://zkillboard.com/character/1254679313/](https://zkillboard.com/character/1254679313/)
---
The DST can haul things and you can put the cyno up before the inhib.  Also, it's easier to skill alts into industrials than recons, so you can have an industrial in every system and a couple of recons waiting at your staging, rather than recons in every system.
---
LMAO linking what, your cerb/Manticore al?t should mean what exactly? In confused on if you think that increased your credibility somehow
---
Orcas mine at max skill about 1/3rd of a hulk or covetor similarly skilled.  Your mileage may vary, and you sacrifice alot of tank to do so at that level.  Depending on the ore you are mining, you can get 100mil per load, but that will take all of 3 hours to fill you up.
---
BS lands 100 off just have t3 dessys ready to warp the another 100 and kill them
---
&gt;your main doesn't have over 10 kills in anything non-doctrine lmao.
---
I was answering your statement, did you already forget making it?
---
I love when seddow say: ahhh they'r all fucked :-D  when harpies die in bombs
---
When going to help someone in trouble, I learned that if you call primary, everyone on comms hears a urgent fight that can be winnable, and they will come from far and wide to get to your system and warp to you 
---
The call is 100% sincere but it results in a much better response than "I have someone tackled, probably going to die". I've learned to say "Okay I have point on the Ishkur. Primary Xerxes in the Ishkur." People are finding their suitable Ishkur killing ship and undocking. Even if they get there a little late and the Ishkur's get away, it's 100% better than them not undocking at all
---
I mine in an Orca/Skiff pair 'cause Corp rules say Procs/Skiffs only.
---
I'd like to take advantage of that Hulk efficiency in the pair,  but bossman doesn't want CODE to get used to the idea of available  squishies.
---
This game's lack of balancing disturbs me.
---
Argument ad personam. 
---
You should just drop the topic. Attacking your opponents killboard doesn't proves you right, and it makes you look like an bad.
---
Read it again, take your time little bee, I know it's difficult. I'll even help, your *main.* You linked a character with ~250 kills, most of which are in a Cerb, as proof you're a "pvper" and not another one of those dumb goon carebears!
---
By that logic, we should do away with stargates too. See what people say about jump freighters after making a run to Jita from wherever at 2 AU/s.
---
Bringing up his killboard to question the experience he has, with things he feels completely comfortable with talking about as an expert, is a pretty reasonable thing to do.
---
Just out of curiosity what part of space do you live in?
---
A) you have no idea who my main is, B) I linked a page with a lot more than 10 kills outside the doctrine fits flying solo... but go ahead and pick those goal posts up and move them a few miles if it makes you feel superior.
---
Sounds like a pretty fucking shit fit then. At least train enough for auto targeting if you are dedicated to being bad
---
No, it's not. This is literally argument ad personam.
---
Lack of experience does not imply that that his arguments are incorrect.
---
Been a long long time since I have heard that voice. Didmt know he came back to the game.
---
You do know what supercarriers used to be called, right?
---
Great job there.
---
You TEST guys, went godlike that night
---
o7
---
Actually, they were hauling stuff in. We connected to their static around 30+ minutes before this happened. They were pulling drifters of HS for 30 mins before that Bustard went out, pretty soon he came back, so we tackled him on on their static. We saw Thanatos on dscan as we tackled it, we held Bustard hostage for escalation (little did we know lol) but Thanatos never arrived and went mia. Good corpies, lol.
---
m8 your Reddit name and 1k kill toon that looks fairly active are the same. Just stop, it's pathetic, and I feel bad now so go ahead, reply, take the last word so you win
---
Grath isn't even in PL anymore.
---
No I left thanks for keeping up stupid.
---
&gt; code ganks
---
From what I hear, that's not an especially noteworthy feat. And it's funny how much you sling buzzwords like "risk-averse" (not adverse, BTW) around without even considering that risk comes into play the moment you hit the Undock button.
---
Except they are, and if he had and experience he would very easily understand why.
---
yea on the drone side, dont take 15 hobs, take 3 sets of drones, 5 hobs , 5 EC 300s, and 5 of some other type of drones
---
well shit if we're going by amount destroyed this guy would be my main. [https://zkillboard.com/character/287231935/kills/page/9/](https://zkillboard.com/character/287231935/kills/page/9/) I guess your whole narrative is falling apart.
---
You can also store fitted DSTs in the Rorqual in case they get the jump on you and explode one.  Or at least you could a couple of years ago.
---
I realy doesn't care who is right or wrong here.
---
What ticks me off is using logic fallacy to prove your points.
---
Too many false positives because ipv4 and nat.
---
Sensitive one, are ya
---
You probably read that 'delaying' CONCORD (from blowing up their targets in the prescribed amount of time) is naughty. This is relocating or "pulling" them away from the site of a future gank. The sight OP saw is an everyday occurrence where the large gank fleets operate.
---
You guys may benefit from having a more publically known list of cyno pilots know - i roam lowsec looking for easy kills (like indies) but i would not dare to kill a pushx cyno, purely out of respect.
---
So your friend just sits and watches you mine eith miner IIs for the single reason of popping a cyno then scooting?
---
As much as I'm compelled to be a typical goon and grr PL.. That was pretty damn nice to watch!
---
Kikis are my favourite ships to fly and wish there was more of a meta towards them.
---
Alpha relative to Alpha, not Alpha compared to Omega.
---
Yeah, and apparently CCP was going to add a new "Mothership" class to the game when they did, but it never panned out.
---
There is more to life then spod
---
Call it whatever you like. I simply don't like when people act like the way you did.
---
That’s absolutely the direction they’re looking in - World Arks, noncombat super-duper-caps that can act as a mobile base of operations would be a great thing, especially if they’re scaled more like structures (in pricing etc)
---
Come to amamake but i don’t live in a certain region. Why would i be limited to a certain space? Anyway, come to ama and bring lots of friends.
---
Does this mean we can bridge to industrial Cynos?
---
With Injectors sure. Of course since this info is by no means definitely presented anywhere, a new player especially wouldn't know any better. Hell, I'm not a new player by any means but I couldn't find the info either. But point being the Spree specifically ended up being worse for newer Alpha accounts than skilled ones. Some may not care, some maybe do.
---
But you know what, fuck it. Let's rather get back to bitching about the blackout, which even isn't something to bitch about.
---
Lmao I just wanted to clarify, you don’t live out in null sec so you don’t understand how vital they are to the logistics of nullsec alliances, of course you don’t mind everything going through gates cuz it’s all 8 or so jumps from you anyway
---
Asking CCP to develop new things in 2019.
---
Well good luck with that. Looks like all they can do now is to play with database switches. 
---
Asking anything that requires development effort is simply too much for them.
---
i fucking wish they were alts
---
Because risk doesn’t come into play when you hit the undock button and you’re a fool if you think that. When you undock, as long as you dont move, you are invulnerable for 10 seconds. Second when you’re in a JF, as long as you’re out cyno is lite, you can jump. When you enter another system, you are invulnerable for another 10 seconds. So where is the risk here? This is basic eve mechanics btw.
---
You mention evernus (which I still use) has a hotkey to go through each order and copy the price to clipboard if undercut - was this effectively the same as just clicking each order and having it copy the new price to clipboard? Or does it actually paste it/modify the order for you somehow as well
---
Either way, keen to try this out as an evernus replacement!
---
It's more like: "I'm not giving you any more money until you make things better, or at least commit to the effort of making things better."
---
Wtf, ive played this game for years. How the fuck do i know understand living in null when several years of my game play been in null? Are you a moron? Majority of my kills are in null because thats where majority of the bad and easy prey is to begin with because safety, cyno, need local, bots, cringing crying.
---
Why hasn't CCp Rattati posted on twitter since 2018?
---
I didn't say they weren't worth dropping on. I said who cares about three frigates when they can't actually do anything.
---
Are we the only ones who use dics and hics as our 1st cyno with the cyno on the rorq being last ditch?
---
If you really want to prevent target from fleeing, fit your alt in a bomber with +4 points of scram and full tank (+8k ehp). For main character I recommend starting with a stratios as its cheaper than T3C's and it has a probing bonus. 
---
[Example stratios fit that can potentially fight solo T3C's](https://pastebin.com/2UiFNzVB)
---
It really ticks me off when people use flawed logic smh.
---
&gt;Asking anything that requires development effort is simply too much for them.
---
They definitely haven't added an entirely new ship line over the last year. Or made drifters come to wspace. Or make Triglavian Invasions. Or abyssal sites. Or a number of other things.
---
But keep being a hypocrite it's hilarious.
---
They have developed and been testing a new warp mechanic that puts a timer to bumping allowing you to warp despite being bumped?
---
I forgot, you're right. People buy good plates and get to transfer them though right?
---
It doesn't modify the order, it just copies the undercut to the clipboard and opens the in-game market page via ESI (just like Evernus did).
---
EVE is a sort of game where you have to remain attentive. Even if you are AFK mining now.  
---
I love it :)
---
It's just one example. Other examples could include finance getting tax auditors to deal with, programmers and crunch time, lots of things that can result in real life leaving no time for EVE.
---
I think you mean "I find your lack of balance disturbing"
---
That cuts both ways.
---
Nice to watch. Our FCs shouldn't have jumped when you had that gate camped. Well, mistakes were made. Nevertheless, GF.
---
P.S. You should have added what happened latter, when you docked up when what caught your fleet on it's way back, in 46DP.
---
ok fair enough
---
I’m impressed that someone can so consistently portray the opposite of his own flair. Show some fucking initiative and get out there and do something useful instead of bitching all the time.
---
Thank you very much.
---
Well, yep. That's why I could survive.  
---
Three NPC frigates were standing on the landing point and I just thought they are guristas. Dropped drones and start locking ores. Noticed something wrong that my shield breached in few seconds. Moment, I pushed warp button again and again.
---
Yes no shield modules but 3 x core defense field extenders.
---
Most of the things they added aren't that much resources heavy. I would argue that only changes that required development effort are triglavian stuff. Flex structures are old things given new form, and some tweaks to work along new system. And all of that in about 14 or more months.
---
You didnt have a mining permit noob
---
Yes, let us gank in HS without even taking a shot!
---
And if you flag the bumper, well, how about I just park my ship in your path.
---
Tieracide CCPlease.  Just finish it.
---
Alienating 97% of potential users in the first week is also core gameplay.
---
&gt;Looks like all they can do now is to play with database switches. 
---
You're a moron. Try to say someone is using logical fallacies by questioning someone's knowledge of a subject, yet you have zero problems making outright wrong statements of fact because you're a bitter bitch. I actually laughed when I saw you were the same poster.
---
Or alternatively, good luck getting through any gatecamp with any cloaky ship, be it either hunter, blockade runner or explorer.
---
But still misserable as ever.
---
let me know where to buy the permit, thanks.
---
I'm one of the happiest nicest dude you can meet, did you ever think maybe its you thats the problem?
---
\#ERAOFCHAOS
---
If that's a big concern, I'd be OK with this concept being modified so that it's a script you put into the WDFG that reduces range a bit so that it doesn't cover a whole gate by default. 
---
If you have a super-bubbled gate + proper gatecamp already, it's not a guaranteed escape for those ships you've listed anyway. Plus, so few gatecamps have HICs now anyway, which just goes to show how something like this is actually needed, for a ship that should by design be the "best" ship for a gatecamp.
---
Widow uses ECM
---
It was super effective... nothing changed.
---
Lolololol
---
congrats you juyst made blockade runners useless
---
- Still high risk for the 'defenders' (the HIC's fleet) - you are bubbling your own fleet so if not done by a skilled pilot/FC, could just whelp your whole fleet instead
---
That's already a "risk" of having a HIC, or using Bubbles in general. And people seem to manage just fine. So you aren't adding any extra risk that wasn't there before.
---
- Gives a reason to actually fly HICs in subcap fleets
---
Again, people use HICs and Bubbles all the time. Clearly there is plenty of reason already, such as "stopping people from warping".
---
- Doesn't kill any opportunities for good bomber play, and doesn't instantly make HICs a requirement for every fleet - just gives an option to deal with them
---
If you can park a single ship on a Gate and prevent anyone from warping to or from the gate, as well as prevent anyone from slowboating through under Cloak, then Hell Yeah they're going to become a requirement.
---
&gt; the fact that ~12 bombers can delete a Muninn (or other) fleet in 15 seconds with (potentially) no counterplay is pretty dumb.
---
lol what, theres definitely counter play to bombers, people are just too lazy to use them.
---
if that fleet had the tools it needed to deal with bombers, it would have, but it didn't, so it ate shit.
---
&gt; If you have a super-bubbled gate + proper gatecamp already, it's not a guaranteed escape for those ships you've listed anyway
---
Cause total safety is bad.
---
But with your idea, every camp will have a hictor, and they will be guaranteed killing the listed ships.
---
if you're paying attention when playing, you'd see someone parking their ship in front of you
---
thats intended for ships getting stuck against large collidable objects, like stations and such in mission pockets.
---
Maybe he was being pointed as he lit the cyno and they hadn’t de cycled yet??
---
Crazy idea: maybe a special probe or script that decloacks everything in a wider range, but no warp disruption.
---
&gt; That's already a "risk" of having a HIC, or using Bubbles in general. And people seem to manage just fine. So you aren't adding any extra risk that wasn't there before.
---
This is HIC specific. And the risk is, before there would've been no scenario where you just HIC bubbled your fleet with noone else near, because it wouldn't have done anything.
---
&gt; Again, people use HICs and Bubbles all the time. Clearly there is plenty of reason already, such as "stopping people from warping".
---
Bubbles yes, HICs no. About 1 in 10 doctrines actually have HICs in them.
---
&gt; If you can park a single ship on a Gate and prevent anyone from warping to or from the gate, as well as prevent anyone from slowboating through under Cloak, then Hell Yeah they're going to become a requirement.
---
As above, I'd be open to this being a script that also reduces the bubble range so that it doesn't cover a whole gate by default. Could even use a lot more cap so it's harder to just perma.
---
I’m sure there are plenty of people enjoy missioning in high sec.
---
How do people keep adrenaline pumping for the 15 minutes between the primary being called and you actually being able to hit f1?
---
Exactly unsubscribe
---
I agree
---
The counterplay would've been to turn on their ADCs before the void bomb hit them, which is very hard to call when they were already fighting a 3rd party, or not have had their MWDs active. Once that void hit them with their MWDs cycled and us bombers in bomb range, they could do literally nothing else except watch bombs fly towards them and explode.
---
Having a dic with them to bubble us would've done literally nothing to save them.
---
EVE attracts a high percentage of people that don't get metaphors.
---
They have been working on some things since forever, and we still haven't seen any effects. I'll believe that new system works, if it would really work as intended.
---
With the range dropped to 12k or so (ie. 50% of default) with a script that did this, still wouldn't be guaranteed with just 1 HIC.
---
What? Ive been playing this game for 7 years and I have never, ever understood why the fuck people care so much about KB stats, especially stuff like "yeah I was 1/300th the kill of this unfit athanor! Im so cool!"
---
You gotta pay the troll toll to get in this boys hole
---
Not a bad idea, could just decloak and not warp disrupt!
---
No counter play to bombers? Is this thing called defender missiles, might help to read up on them before making a reddit post claiming is no counter to 15 bombers.
---
Graphs are fun okay?!
---
CCP kicked a lot of dev's who spoke up to Hilmar and their intern handling of eve. So we lost the dev's who would announce big changes like cyno or blackout 3-6 month before and who pushed for big balance changes. CCP didn't invest any real devwork beside skelleton crew since crucible into eve. Even now they want to hire a new game director for a new unnanounnced MMO so you see the PA money and our subscription money is still not put into eve but into a new MMO. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
When CCP changes stuff mostly break stuff they say they will adjust it later, but they never do thats why you had all from Nullsec spoke out against the recent and future changes, while wormhole and wannabe PVP'ers made a big downvote/upvote campaign on reddit. This backfired in a lot of people stop logging in or lose trust, and a mmo like eve survives only in trust from the playerbase which actually speeds up the recent stagnation. 
---
The last big balance change was frigate and ADC changes, and that wasn't even hard to implement to begin with. Here are dozen of lists of broken stuff but CCP will not acknowledge it since on iceland they life in a bubble of superiority over all other humans on this planet, atleast most of them are like this. Sadly CCP failed as company with any other projects than eve, any real smart manager and dev would put work into their product which kept them afloat, CCP is not like that. The Money CCP makes goes into new products which fail again and again.
---
And all those arguments for the recent changes where madeup bad and not even logical from a outside the box perspective since they missed all goals and had a negative impact on the playerbase and maybe future of this game. All people who are not narrow minded acknowledge that, the rest will circlejerk their arguments but as long as you preach the earth is flat and your group claps on your shoulder you start to believe that bullshit.
---
Level 4 missions.
---
I made 170mil off a high sec drop last time I played. Do it if its your thing.
---
There's dedicated mission runners, and so Triglavian Incursions are hi-sec based. Worth looking into if that's you're thing!
---
www.minerbumping.com
---
Fair call on the defenders, not all fleets have defenders in them though, and they're a direct counter to bombs, but not actual counterplay to cloaked bombers/other cloakies.
---
I love you cassie
---
It's 4 weeks now, and they are still very much blue.
---
OK, thanks guys.  I'll have to check into missions, I forget how that all works.  What is considered a good ship for L4 missions?
---
Level 4 missions can get the job done. Reject the few bullshit ones and just run the easy ones.
---
doesn't matter, freighters don't have the agility to avoid it
---
:Clap:
---
Ah i see, i usually have no problems with rats, but when i was assisting a mining fleet (in a wormhole :\\) they had high level rats drop on them as well as a legion drop at the same time.  
---
The legion got worse off, apparently a fleet of drones and a defense ship can wreck a legion.  
---
I find the best method to get rid of rats in highsec is to fit an adaptive invuln, also set your drones to aggressive, they'll attack the enemy first.
---
I find for sheer amusement the best thing to do is mine in a rokh with missiles :) (that is a joke)

Fuck Hyperion Shi. This is called karma!

Except that's not what they said, it was stated that super caps should not beable to engage subcaps. So that logically means a noob ship should beable to take on a super.

It may not have the largest player base... but its profitable and note... this list of the "perfect 10" 10 year old MMOs from almost FIVE years ago... it's still going.

&gt; thinking of coming back to EVE just for some relaxation.

Isn't easier to take a hot bath?

Man Hyperion doesn't have good luck with his rags, does he. First one he accidentally DDs, next one gets bosoned by Vily...

Poor guy, can't wait to see him lose a third!

Dropping shield supers in the TEST armor super response fleet :psyduck:

Are they really newbie friendly? The requirements seems to be pretty skill intensive.

Bless you CHEMK/SSTAT guys

Only good corps in Goons

i wasted time of my life with an ex... I should've used that time playing more eve

I don't see you on my Titan so all good ;)

Don't worry, everybody will now have a 2nd active account at all times just for their Force Recons to stand by for cyno.. LOLOLOL!!!

*\* Ganks notwithstanding*

&gt; not all fleets have defenders in them though, 
---
As not all fleet have HICs in them
---
&gt; and they're a direct counter to bombs, but not actual counterplay to cloaked bombers/other cloakies. 
---
Yes they are. Not cloacked, they're useless cloacked. But as soon as they're not, you can clean a momber fleet with jackdaws.
---
:P
---
*1 Hel
---
Goons see. We can be friends :)
---
We killed 2 hels. Zkill hasn't updated yet
---
I have been doing Combat Sites and DED sites that escalates from them, so far it's been dropping faction module that profitable for me and I could semi-afk it with my brand new Gila (warp to sites, launch drones, and let them finish all).  
---
Luckiest drop so far have been pithum c invul module that sell for 300m ISK from guristas ded 4/10, for only 10minutes clearing time. (clear first room then snipe the building next room and loot it)
---
100% ALWAYS AND FOREVER FUCK YOUR TITAN :)
---
The fuck is that gif?
---
I didn't see 2 hel wrecks
---
Thanks for fleet, Elo
---
Meh I am pretty much quitting the game soon when my subscription runs out. Might as well YEET things before I go
---
i literally watched 2 hels die.
---
Hey man, yeet as many titans at us as you want, we won't complain
---
Just for those who don't know the fun we have had together ;)
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/CautiousSpinelessCaterpillarNerfRedBlaster

I guess whoever got the kill and the pilot who lost it both don't have zkill authed.
---
Which Titan to YEET Next
---
http://prntscr.com/p394cc
---
I know man I do a bit of station trading too.
---
Rattlesnake is still pretty great for running 4s.
---
That Lif was the toughest opponent of the night.
---
250ish ships vs 50ish ships xD
---
4 years of highsec lv4s.
---
You can, but it can get dull.
---
Went bull, won’t go back to lv4
---
What's more likely neither corp does or he warped or jumped out. I know I've confused the two once or twice.
---
Machariel or Rattlesnake if you aren't running burners.  
---
  
---
If you are tho, then you should consult recent burner running guide. I'm not familiar with current meta.
---
Literally just getting out there and doing it does so much to get the PvP jitters under control and teach you how to subconsciously verify all the little things (that matter a lot), like ammo types and what your keep at range and orbit are set at and how much you can overload without burning out and being able to notice through debuff icons and overview ship speeds and stuff what kind of fit you're up against, etc.
---
1 Hel died, not two, no wrecks, no zkill and no one is speaking up on comms saying that they died in a second
---
Maybe try building some faxes instead?
---
"primary" indicates there are more targets.
---
DECEPTIVE. But effective.
---
Maybe check Vily's killboard for it?
---
I'd say at this point no second Hel died or it would have been posted. Just trying to give the benefit of the doubt.
---
He has a whole fleet of them, they just weren't in impass :(
---
The solution is having destroyers with defender launchers, accompanying your fleet.
---
It’s literally that easy.
---
I had my own FAX Cache. Sadly my 10 FAX alts weren't near them at the time :(
---
This feels like a legit press release for a real corp. eve is real!

i LITERALLY shot 2 hels and both died. This is the pilot that was killed. Zkill has not updated

CHEMK is still around?

Wondered what happened to them.

Welcome to Eve. Don't fly what you aren't willing to lose.

im sure well catch that dank AAR on twitch yeah?
---
Wow, Goons and FRT coming together against TEST. Only in Eve, we'll temp blue anyone for content, right?
---
We are growing more than ever!
---
Beautiful! Nice job on the kill. How'd it go?
---
I'll give you 10m

Subcap cap boosters, cap transfers, all subcap weapons except for light missiles and disintegrators, active and passive armor hardeners,  passive shield hardeners, local shield boosters, shield boost amplifiers, local armor reps, auto and passive targeting systems (lol), energised armor layering membranes and the non-energised type(lol), and local hull reps.
---
That was what I found trawling through Pyfa for a bit. 
---
The sad thing is, CCP really doesn't need to put much thought into any of these to finish tiericide very quickly. Capital cap boosters only have a compact variant, so do the same for the subcap variants.  Cap transfers would be the same as remote reps just without the enduring variant, so there would just be scoped and compact versions. subcap weapons just need to follow the proportions and types of the capital variants, so scoped, precise, enduring and compact (maybe add an expanded variant in place of enduring for missiles and projectiles if able). Local reps (including hull reps) could have enduring and compact variants like the capital counterparts.
---
Hardeners, enams, energised armor layerings and passive shield hardeners only need one meta variant, so just convert all meta mods to the compact version (equivalent to highest meta, except for meta enams, which should be halfway between T2 resistance platings and T2 enams). Non-energised Armor resistance platings/armor layerings only need to have a T1 and a T2 version (rats drop T1 version, equivalent to the best meta of now).  Shield boost amps only need a compact variant. Auto and passive targeters only need enduring and compact variants, and auto targeters need to have actual scaling fitting requirements between T1 and T2. 
---
Boom, tiericide finally done in like a month for a single dev (including writing the script to convert all deprecated types to the new meta variants). But apparently CCP only has like 3 people working on Eve these days, and new nullsec abyssal invasion sites and fucking with wormhole graphics are more important.
---
This isnt fake news. we literally shot and killed 2 hels, then moved to a lif before we lost all our dreads. I was literally on the field.
---
no
---
The people least deserving of kindness are the ones who need it most.
---
Why
---
except when you run 10 orcas at no cost cause lul extractors/injectors on the toons, in a system with 60 moons that you mine all of on a 60 day rock cycle.
---
Was nearly lucky enough to live. Tried Warping out when I hit 30% Shields. Just scraping warp speed when I hit hull and died.
---
Did u kill the wreck too cause u didn’t kill the 2 titans wrecks or the 1 held that died, but I was on grid too and only 1 hel wreck
---
Because "reeeeeeeee free intel grrrrrrrrrrrr"?
---
running alt accounts to fund my pvp habits.
---
don't you know that forcing your friends to just sit on field and watch you rake in isk is dank content?
---
Your phone browser?
---
I suggest you stop posting.   Please.
---
Why would I unsubscribe when the complaint is too many people are unsubing :big think:
---
&gt;  Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
---
I must say I appreciate the dedication to research.
---
I haven't checked for subcaps turrets, but I think we have enough variety there with all the sizes, ranges, damage mods etc.
---
The others could definitely use meta versions, it would at least help new players get into the fitting game.
---
I just hope they don't remove t1 meta modules (and other.. "extra", rarely used variations of items) altogether. Seems like the easier way out.
---
Oh. Yeah it makes tools nicer but I can see how it can also ruin any legwork someome put in personally to find a niche or a profitable item.
---
So then you don't actually enjoy the mining.
---
You're enjoying browsing the internet and watching videos.
---
I'd honestly be good if sites ratting sites acted the same as explo sites... you finish one, another spawns in the same region, encourages people to move around between systems and increases opportunity for hunters to catch careless baddies
---
Why not off-grid cynos? Genuinely curious.
---
lol...ya it may look like that at a cursory glance, but there was no temp blue...3 powerful entities came together and clashed in a fury...when we jumped in, we knew it was 1 way....We staged dreads and were hunting for titan kills.  Using the blops fleet as cover to first get at the rorqs, doing a little baiting til the titans came, other entities came to kill everyone...and we said fuck it jump in and grab all the titans we can....it was a marvelous disaster if I ever saw one....but no, dear reader...no temp blue donut went on that night....
---
You’re whole fleet will get perma bubbled and still end up losing the fight, warping caps to a fight isn’t a great idea unless you want to feed
---
I thought the point of recons were that they were D-scan immune. Wouldn't an off-grid recon be able to safely cyno in a fleet?
---
Are you working in a group or solo? Very few of them say "solo." Just curious, because that's a lot different than solo-roaming in T1 Frigs to learn, imo
---
Also, charge your phone.
---
Yeah they've reached Signal Cartel status.
---
It's really weird reading this.  My group does subcap gangs often.. it's normalized I guess?
---
Hey, let the newbie have his fun. You all remember that time it happened to you. That and sometimes I know NC. dropped a Titan fleet on a lone Venture, so... it could happen.
---
Ganking in HS has always needed higher penalties for the gankers. The progress bar for Warp after 3 min. is a good step in the right direction, but the Ship being Ganked should have some recourse. As it stands, there is literally nothing you can do until you are fired upon, and that's with or without being bumped. You wait to get fired upon, then you die in one volley... so where is the gameplay there? It is decidedly one-sided and does not promote action between parties.
---
I'd be totally fine with HS ganking if there were a way to combat it. The old "well, fit tank" does not always work and it isn't as if only AFK bots are being ganked, so being at the keyboard isn't the issue either. In the past, I've had CCP reimburse a ship because I did everything I possibly could, on a tanked ship in HS, insta'd by a Tornado while docking with a Hammer-Dock bookmark.
---
I'd be totally fine with that loss, if there were any way for me to participate in this "battle" and it was something that I failed to plan for. Losing something when you did absolutely nothing wrong and have no recourse, is just bad gameplay and prompts people to rage.
---
I feel your editing pain.
---
like in total honesty if thats the amount of money you have then i will gladly take a titan off your hands, i can fly one but i cant aford it so... but yea better to use them than not!
---
No he catches.
---
Month long effort finally coming to fruition! Great work.
---
Who cares what its intent is the fact is you can't be bumped longer than X minutes anymore without someone going criminal on you.
---
I second this
---
NS static is great for content.
---
Dominix
---
He's alive, went back and checked video we couldn't break him with what was left and swapped to triage for as many kills as possible.
---
Whine more krab boy.

Different kinds of content. If I wanted to fight in nullsec I would never have left Horde
---
&gt;What the hell is that going to do
---
I miss when goons didn't post on Reddit.
---
Yeah.. I don't get it.  Our phones work just fine on the site.
---
Reduce the need for multi-account setups?

Nice work!

Buddy ive been in love with art in hulls since 2007 ~ can find me zipping about in a dual-prop killeranis to this day.

Yup. I'm that dude bringing a AAR dual-prop scram ranis on the null roam.....
---
Funnily enough if I wasn't hit by that boson I could have lived. Didn't have anything tackling me so tried Warping to the fort when I hit 30% shields. Just about to hit warp when I died so an extra 3-ish seconds might have been enough to hit warp.
---
your pretty retarded if you think the boson wasn't spot on (as you hide your shield damage)
---
the rag was just as dead either way, but all your dreads being low shield/armor and dying quicker probably saved at least one super.
---
I'm not buying that argument... it makes the legwork a bit easier by saving some clicks but it is a publicly available tool anyone can use.   I am all for making the more cancerous aspects of this game a bit less AIDS-y to do.  
---
I really, really don't want CCP to continue to cater to the "reeeeeeeeeee I didn't think of that first so it isn't fair" crowd that has been screeching about things on Reddit lately.
---
But reddit told me goons and test are a blue donut, and reddit would never lie to me so this must be fake news.
---
Hitting warp and going into warp are very different. They were gunning for you.
---
nice you actually hit 5 dreads and sealed the death of a blue titan and soloed a test carrier, also neuting every one of yer faxes.
---
&gt;your pretty retarded
---
you're
---
At least he whored on them?
---
He means that he was about to enter warp. Not push the button. He HAD pushed the button at 30% and was nearly INTO warp when he sploded. Again. In another rag. Which is depressing. 
---
At least Hyperion isn’t as bad as that fella who keeps feeding vanquishers

even vily did gun for him.....

Well I was on the edge of the titan blob and wasn't bumping off anything (Wasn't bumped before hand either by anyone). So probably would have gotten into warp when I hit the speed.
---
Damn I forgot my own numbers ={

&gt; Meh I am pretty much quitting the game

he's kinda on and off, but it's a real treat to fly with him =D
---
Nope. They're will here.

I did press the Warp button at 30% Shields. Was just about to hit speed when I died. Was sort of beginning to align out before the Dreads landed.
---
&gt; I jump in and find all out the myrms scattered and docked.
---
So what's to keep enterprising people from ignoring said bots, heading to their space, and ratting themselves?
---
Bots scatter and you get your ratting isk.
---
You're posting this on a thread about cyno balancing...
---
Maybe bombers need an application penalty so that they'll be worse at dealing with sub BC response fleets....

Its almost like AoE designed to enable A-symmetric warfare will inevitably become the n+1 weapon choice once total numbers reach the inflection point.

Should CSM members use such words....

Yeah. And you can't hunt very well in a battleship. And I have to say, since I switched to wormholes, the rapid heavy raven has become my new favorite ship, so anything that would give me fewer opportunities to use it is a bad thing.

You want a private conversation use direct messages. You want to be a dong bag on a public forum expect others to chime in.

Nice thanks!

we have found a work around, just put cyno alts on your keepstars, jump to the keep star, and warp to the rorq, blow shit up easy fix.
---
elected by the people... for the people... or something
---
Oh I'm in agreement
---
I read somewhere that CCP employ economic advisors that try to track and maintain a balanced market economy. I personally think that if this is the case then it would make sense that their priority would be the economy, which would highly impact thr number of channels that a new change would need to pass through before making it to live, theoretically right?
---
Morelike "CCPlz give us easier access to eye cancer through our phones"
---
Our SNS fleet seems to be recorded in that but we weren't a part of whatever happened. We did shoot a bunch of sabres on gates though.
---
isk is not the same thing as content
---
Jokes on you I was in a Scythe.
---
Yeah, AAR please!
---
We were literally just passing through and had no idea what was happening and shot no caps. Or saw any caps. Except this one Rorq we tried to kill but got saved.
---
This is weird.  Not working at all.  Nothing seems to be fixing it.  Bizarre.
---
A) no one warps caps into a fight grid because of bumping, B) the second you light that cyno it doesn't matter how d-scan proof you are because the cyno shows up on the overview.
---
To boson his meat shield, it's ok I guess he calls them the same thing all the time
---
That moment when the invuls turn off and damage quadruples :ok_hand:
---
The dreads would have died to the supers before you died. If they just used guns and fibos. But your a meatshield it's why your expected to rat and mine there while test gets eso
---
But cyno up? fc wut to do?
---
If you know lowbies in high sec, they get 5/10 escelations from den anomolies. A fair number of them are in high sec and they can't run them. Pay them 20m each escelation. Make 43m minimum from OPE + whatever loot. Can be just 43m or can be 800m. All in high sec. Must know or have a connection to players who can't run the 5/10 escelations they get.

I'll take a look in the morning, evernus was amazing. My main complaint with most tools is that they don't track contract sales (importing doctrine fits etc)

Thanks for the help Vily!
---
You can't just do that to people dude. Poor guy has family.
---
You are also retarded!
---
Tbh thats a very interesting and coherent counterargument. I didnt expect this topic to go so deep but lets go.
---
Its my opinion, from my experience with depression, that i am watching myself somehow and judging  my reactions to hard situations, hoping not to be disappointed.
---
I therefore fear more lacking courage in my responses than ruminating bad thoughts, for this torments me the most. Whereby i deduced rule 1.
---
However, i also know how eve is deeply social and i believe you could be right by saying that opening yourself to others is a legit way out. Fits the rest of your arguments as well. Its certainly something i can get behind.
---
Contracts are one of the things I didn't get to yet, but I have planned.
---
Mixed emotions about this, being such a noble memorial n' all.  But it's done really well d('.'d)
---
Was about to enter warp before you killed him but he's the retard lmao
---
&gt;all your dreads

lol
---
Yeah taking 700k damage from a DD definitely didn't kill him lmao

lmao what is this shit

Wow, someone put my name in this thread.  But yeah, anyone in &lt;Karma&gt; can toss out invites, and we're using discord for voice comms, at least until we get so fat with members we start crashing Discord.
---
I'd rather swim dick first through an ocean of glass before playing WoW. Even if I did play that game, I'd never be caught dead wearing a pink tabard as a nelf.
---
Yes. Besides the obvious missions which vary a lot in profit dependend on how you run them. There are incursions, triglavian invasions, and also highsec combat sites. Highsec DED sites have been good isk in the past but people seem to report that this went down recently. You can also run abyssal sites from highsec.
---
If you're going to have a tabard it might as well look like you went to a caravel and vomited all over yourself.
---
You're perfect. Guild invite sent.
---
3......2.....1..... Fuck Murlocs!
---
Those mechanics serve only as risk mitigation, not cancellation. You're still vulnerable during alignment for warp, rigs or not, and all the hull integrity in the star cluster does you no good if you drop your guard just because the security rating is in the yellow or green. Competent pilots will still scramble you to hell and back and bump you off alignment just to get that killmail.
---
I agree, my group has already come across nullbears trying to setup farm holes and got some pretty good kills out of it. Blew up some shirtfit rorqual last week who was seiged up without rolling or picketing his statics.
---
Or maybe just jump to the cyno beacon in system?
---
Yeah and so has everybody else.

Any honest poster in this sub will have to admit the same :-)

How else would they be able to explore unless the UI directly told them exactly where the things they were exploring for are?

I don't
---
I can understand pixelating chat channels but why would you pixelate the whole video?
---
That's fine, we can adapt.
---
But cap PVP is quite possibly dead too. Was it worth killing that just to make 1 in 10 home defenders train and sub one extra account?
---
The agency shows that there are cosmic signatures in a system. In almost every system there is 1 or more cosmic signatures.
---
So your point is invalid, you are either unlucky or just bad.
---
The high sec combat sites pay much better than L4 missions.
---
3/10 and 4/10 DED sites drop 100+ mil every now and then.
---
This will require quiet area of space (competition), scanning and quite a bit of traveling. Missions are less effort.
---
&gt; they first buff rorqual to give solo miner a ship good enough to "compete" with multiboxer, they made it worth it to use by giving them insane mining yield, all in all it was a very good thing
---
If you want a single ship to be competitive against multiboxers, you need to not make it the easiest ship to multibox in the universe.
---
Ratting supers are difficult to multibox, they compete against multiboxing VNIs. Rorquals have both. Everybody at the time, except those miners who couldn't imagine the market ever crashing one day, said the Rorqual was insanely broken in that iteration.
---
Well, what's done is done.
---
I'd rather hire Bill Cosby as my personal bartender than hand a single ISK to CODE.
---
actually why don't we just go ahead and give them a battleship sized weapon system that is notorious for gimped application
---
Rags are in the same tank ballpark as avatars fyi
---
Hey, murlocs are awesome. Go play Murloc RPG for proof.
---
I think pirate should be better in their unique role bonuses and gimmicky shit. T2 better in that they're just statistically superior to their T1 counterparts. In the most broadest sense.
---
I bet someone smacked their fingers on the keyboard, generating those random numbers, when in fact noone got banned. What change, made ccp security team detect and ban bots? What stopped them from doing it  before the issue got addressed by the community on such a large scale? I really want it to be true, but i have a feeling CCP is just playing us like jackasses.
---
Wrong. They did fuck all for the whole month then decided on it in the last ten minutes.
---
some peoples unironicly already used recons to cyno :D
---
Too scared to adapt.. mate I post these every few months.
---
I give no fucks for null bears o.0
---
Yeah but then you accidentally hire someone like Hilmar to pull that trigger. Flavour of the month would be fine so long as the last meta wasn't nerfed to total shit. Everything needs to remain competitive at all times otherwise it sucks dick for those who can't change doctrines every month.
---
I played it a few years back. I know what it's like. Not interested.
---
hey ron hope you're doing well one thing you may have noticed in your many years of eve play is that 'gunning for' and 'tackling' are not the same thing!
---
&gt;EVE is a sort of game where you have to remain attentive.
---
Which would be fine, if activities like mining required an input more frequently than once every quarter of an hour.
---
I've had some good DST kills. Not quite that good. Maybe I should head up to a C5.
---
Machariel is probably the best choice if you have the skills and can afford it but all battleships should be able to do them.  
---
There's a chat channel "Fits for L4 missions" that has mission fits for most battleships.
---
the fit he used has got me like really
---
High effort people like near2 users, bots, rorq miners unhappy?
---
lol world of Warcraft?!

You are as naive as a 10 year catholic school girl. How cute.

...said no one?
---
Level 4 miszzzZzzzzZzzzzzZzz
---
Most attackers are non-retarded enough to not simply bring a couple of waterboarders to keep that shut down. Also, warping from something like a keepstar probably won't work as the attackers should also be non-retarded enough to have catch bubbles in the direction of the keepstar (or any other cyno they see pop up on overview) to stop help arriving.
---
But the Rag pilot says he was about to warp out?
---
Played that in 2004/2005, won it end of 2005. and every expansion about 1/2 a year after release, and no interest in playing with 12 year fornite-kids in an overhyped, grindy old Blizzardgame.
---
Only Camelot Unchained will get's me, since i am at it from start, and will consume my time at release.
---
No, supercapitals should not be effective against subcapitals. Balance among ship classes in the game is structured on a ratio, in my estimation, of approximately 5 of one lower class will decisively win against the higher class ship. That means that 5 battlecruisers should win against one battleship, even if the value of the battleship is greater than that of the smaller ships. This is crucial balance because it means that those who are entrenched long term high SP players can still be beaten by newer players, because otherwise if the higher SP player won every engagement there would be basically no reason to play for incoming players. That does not mean that a rookie ship, or a hundred, or a thousand should decisively win against a supercapital. I’m saying it’s unreasonable that supers are the only class of ship where the only reasonable counter is fielding supers. No other class of ship in the game has this silly level of imbalance.
---
would be to strong, and on every gate you would have a hic at all times, so that's no counterplay, but killing cloak!
---
the idea behind it to get some counterplay against cloak is wanted by most of the community, also to nerf bombers as they are today, together with jump destroyer.
---
Since ECM is nearly nerfed to death, make a moduel based on ECM, give it AOE Effect, only fited on a type of ship class smaller then BC that can use that module like a command bust with charges to effect a defined area around him to "jam" the cloak-technology.
---
It is. He just needs some arbitrary self-justification to play space pixels ;)
---
So.. Basically you complain that if you leave game for a bit you get out of the flow temporarily?
---
can i have one thanks  on advantage
---
Yeah have fun
---
Last I checked a bomber tops out at 500DPS (without silly modules), and applies up to 300 to below BC sized targets with a single TP. Sounds fine to me to be honest.
---
Great video as always!
---
There aren't any. Unless you're a doofus enough to not train diplo V.
---
Story?
---
alternatively the harpies could just go for a proper warpin and not land in bombing range.
---
All they need is to take BF2142 and make it EVE-related.
---
Just don't put it into the "EVE universe" or try to integrate it into the game. That's retarded.
---
Check the Fuzzwork planetary index, it has the profits numbers. Best right now is Broadcast Nodes and you can make a factory world that can produce them with only mostly P1 imports.
---
No matter how bad EVE will get, it will always, *always*, **always** be above themeparks just by the virtue of its genre.
---
That was a great game. Dust 514 PC please.
---
Do all the agent missions. You’ll get just about everything you need to start down the different paths of whatever you choose.
---
If you’re traveling to a different system, never autopilot.
---
Don’t fly a ship you can afford to lose.
---
Don’t assume you’re safe just because you’re in high security space.
---
I recommend you try pandemic horde, or any other null sec corporations that are new player friendly. They will give you cheap ships and  teach you the basics. You’ll be able to jump into all types of content from there. I stayed in high sec the first times I played the game but my experience as a player was enriched once I joined null.
---
Join a Corp. my suggestion for my neck of the woods is spoopy newbies, I guess. There’s not too many good wormhole newbie corps, but wormholes are fun as hell, and some of the best isk/hr in the game
---
Yes, you can still easily find corps that would gladly take a newbie in. Eve Uni still runs their stuff and there are still hisec and lowsec corps looking for warm bodies. I personally would but we might have a language barrier.
---
o/ EVE
---
It would make too much sense. But if you want it like that, wormholes exist and c1-3 have all the same sites.
---
The agency sig finder is so inaccurate it is useless for anyone that has any exploration experience.
---
It serves to guide new players to the career, the fears of it’s intel exploitation faded after it came out.
---
boson final blows should get the solo tag tbh
---
Thanks, I use Fuzzworks all the time.  Actually I should have mentioned Broadcast Nodes I was looking at them earlier.
---
Ah, odd.
---
Why would they do that?
---
The. What are the rorquals doing?
---
Sure, it just clearly hasn't worked well, because stukas can easily handle smaller targets still.
---
When 'fit xx number of t1 frigates' was said they meant to be used to solo PvP in FW space, then you'll learn certain things, to blob someone it doesn't matter what you fly.  
---
If the role you play is tackle in GE- might as well fly ship that fits better to the 'hit approach' skill.
---
I doubt even 10 of eve even knows what that is. Definitely not OP.
---
Basically he complains
---
Austria
---
The first letters are the district, after that it's up to you ;)
---
Would rather join skillu tbh
---
You joke, but that sounds like a fuckup CCP could actually make.
---
r/rareinsults
---
They are though. Unless the bomber fleet is retarded, they're not going to make a move against a well defended fleet
---
Wow was the first dead mmo
---
Find a better game.
---
Cheers for the advice man and yeh lol already have thermo V just need to get better at managing heat i was unaware of the 3 heat gauges in the cap ui so that is good to know also. all of the rest of advice is solid also cheers for that :) and i imagine we will spar at some point
---
Eve Online: Bad Company please.
---
You died a couple times trying to explore? Where were you trying to explore? Because gankers love going around high sec and low sec to gank anyone and everyone.
---
Are you sure you’re not getting ganked by people that scanned down the sites prior to you getting there?
---
Will be more of a PVP game than EVE once Hilmtard gets done chasing everyone back to high sec.
---
Depends on who you are going against. Theres always a work around
---
yeh man a lot of webs and fast abing frigate usually spell death if they are fleet fit with mwd its usually not as much of an issue or if you nuet out their ab but even then can sometimes be rough hitting em.
---
Possible. But this shit basically never happened before. Maybe more people are just out hunting now?
---
A few years too late for that...
---
Idk. I just got back from like 3 hours of null sec exploration and no body bothered me.
---
yeh is what i have set as my short cuts also although i dont use the num keys qwer asdf zxcv etc i am just finding difficulty visualising the key to the module if that makes sense just need to commit imagine it will come in time and like you mentioned.
---
Looks like Nereus fleets are back on the menu boys!
---
What was in 01 and 02?
---
01 check, check
---
02 is this thing on?
---
May I please watch you swim in this ocean?
---
Integrating into the EVE Universe is exactly what *should* happen. Otherwise its just another space-FPS
---
Yeah if you're quitting because of the cyno changes then wow probably is the game for you. I hope you enjoy the change.
---
use wormholes
---
&gt; EVE is a sort of game where you have to remain attentive. Even if you are AFK mining now.
---
He was warping in. AFK has nothing to do with it, it's just super-powered NPCs randomly in space that can kill you and you can do nothing about it.
---
More rampant CCP incompetence.
---
/r/evejobs
---
So he’s this salty that you boson’d his fleet on a gate once?
---
You know the eve forums are on discourse, right? Theres an app for that. Works just fine.
---
(It wraps your browser, but makes notifications better)
---
Click your portrait. Look for encounters in that menu.
---
Thank you, that helps :)

We live in a society

Your formatting is spot on but you could use some more dots ....

When I got my first solo kill, I didn't survive long enough to get a screenshot.
---
Tama: Where boys become men.
---
Don't worry about it. People will move on from blackout and cyno when asset safety and cap HP are nerfed.
---
Yes. And some obviously 'good' plates are held back by DVLA and auctioned off without ever having to be transferred.
---
hilmar turned it into a theme park, now he's turning into a run down shitty theme park.
---
lmao, how many fuckin reddit alts do you have? I am guessing 5. This is getting even sadder.
---
Not usually a fan of grammar naziing but when he's calling everyone else stupid ... yeah.
---
DED 3 and 4 can be worth it, either from escalations or scanning them down.
---
That signature browser is a terrible idea and I wish it had never been added. However it's also kind of broken and doesn't really help all that much.
---
My guess is a lot more people are camping those sites without local.
---
Those crewmen had families.
---
Awesome man! 1 down, thousands to go!
---
Don't worry soon death will consume your life and all the kills will blur together but the first one, the first will stay perfect in your memory. I still remember my first one years and years later.
---
Honestly I'm not sure what was up with the quality for this vid, I'll have to play with the settings and try to get it fixed
---
More Salty that I baited him in with a good fight (His 50man rupture fleet against my 12man spider tanking domi/nestor fleet). Bosoned him on stream while my fleet was on the other side of the gate.
---
They'd have to make it like Planetside 2 and find some way to appeal to the small minority of FPS players who aren't instant-gratification-420-noscopefaggot losers.
---
&gt; Everybody at the time, except those miners who couldn't imagine the market ever crashing one day, said the Rorqual was insanely broken in that iteration.

I remember Aryth saying on Meta show that he warn CCP if they introduce it he will abuse it, CCP did not listen him and now Goons are Mining Yield God

Oh, but they did and still do talk about "perfect intel" and insta super blob responses to every small gang daring to come into PVE pockets before blackout.

1. DON'T UNDOCK ANYTHING YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. (I personally don't like undocking anything I can't afford to lose at least 2-3 times over. That way if I do I can still make some money with the other ship.)
---
1. The tutorial missions are a decent place to start and give you a very basic introduction to the different areas of the PvE side of the game. You can use them to to see what's interests you. Once you figure that out you can look to Eve Uni wiki or youtube since players made way better explanations and tutorials than CCP did.
---
1. Jump in a Discord channel or even a random Corp and make some friends. Doesn't matter who it is, this game is terrible to play alone ESPECIALLY for a new player. Chat with them, ask them questions, even if they are wrong or don't know much. Finding someone who enjoys this game will improve your experience tremendously.
---
1.  Don't autopilot.
---
1. You'll be tempted to do some AFK activities to make some easy ISK early on, I suggest you don't. Stay tabbed into the game, fly around, look at pretty spaceships, look at pretty explosions etc. Later on if you decide Eve is for you than you can turbo krab 10 accounts or whatever pleases you.
---
1. If you want to learn PvP fit a frigate however you like, name it: TEACH ME PVP or something silly. Fly out to Low Sec or Null Sec space and try to kill someone. You will most likely die in a glorious ball of fire. Message your killer and express interest in learning how to pvp. Do this many times over there are plenty of veteran players that would love to help you out.
---
1. Ships are ammo and should be treated as such. Don't cry over losses they will happen, there is no stopping it. I lose upwards of 50 frigates a month at times.
---
Make Good lore and market it to Overwatch crowd. Given the HUNGER of a certain big part of it for this shit, there's a good chance it can get PCU better than one of EVE in less than a day.
---
You can do something about it. It’s called d-scan.
---
The roaming/raznaborg triglavians are definitely overkill for a rookie miner, but on the other hand they aren’t hard to spot. It’s a good thing players are incited to learn to scan.
---
"hey look we´ve had our annual monthly fight!! stop calling us blue!"
---
Why give "warnings" about ships categorized as shield or armor ships? People not allowed to fly them how they want to anymore? I for one don't want extra things on my screen just becouse i fly a shield brutix!
---
You're giving people playing eve waaay to much credit
---
Use search function instead of posting?
---
While the change itself doesn't change much in the terms of running, it do create a HUGE amount of annoyance. No one fucking likes the hacking minigame, but are now forced to suffer thru it.  
---
We all know how much ccp loves to annoy their players right?
---
Get your favourite battleship and go have fun with invasions. Sit on the gate and shoot and salvage, fun and good isk. You may even find peepz to fleet up with
---
it's nearly impossible to fit any kinds of defense modules for retrievers due to lack of cpu and powergrids.  
---
And there trigravian rats are entirely overwhelming other high-sec rats at all. Unfortunately over powered for avarage high-sec habitats. they are likely incursion rats.
---
I'm a doofus, apparently. :(
---
Kestrel too. Mah boi!
---
Don't trust anyone.
---
Stahp dots!!
---
You should ask for a refund 😛
---
You know the bombers are harder to set up and require more skill than an F1 Muninn monkey?
---
Not all fleets have defenders but if you're regularly getting bombed then take some. Adapt and overcome rather than trying to change the game to suit you.
---
True fact. Its safer to mine in null and more profitable.
---
what a faggot huh?
---
The problem is how this would interact with EVE. Sometimes there's no conflict in EVE. Sometimes there is, and it moves at a snail's pace. This isn't what FPS folk want.
---
Ah, yes, you *strategically* bosoned your own dudes.
---
So... you're playing wow classic. With extra steps?
---
When there are 100 nerds it doesn't matter that they only applie 300dmg when they bounce around the grid like mad kangaroos
---
Soon (tm)
---
I’d suggest not flying T3’s. That you’re “trying” WH hunting implies you’ve not done it before. If that’s the case you will die and you will loose skill points with every T3.
---
WH hunting takes a lot of patience and a good understanding of WH mechanics, scanning mechanics, skills and luck.
---
Hunting solo in WH’s means carrying a lot of tools. You need to scan yourself about, repair yourself, hide and overpower your prey. So your Going to need a ship that can do all the above. T3 would do all of this but the cost is too great. Your first kill will be bait! You will get jumped. You will die.  Personally I’d aim towards a bomber and hunt scanning/data/relic ships in C1/2/3’s with HS statics. It’ll get you use to scanning, setting up your own traps, the feel of WH’s and how more alert WH folk are. Bombers are cheap, can insta start locking after cloak and will likely kill its respective prey class and allow you to hunt data/relic frigs, PI runners, gas huffers, and haulers. A good starting point to me.
---
Do you really want to explain every. Single. Goddamn. function in the game? It's fine. Let players experiment with the stupid buttons in the UI, they'll learn. Or they'll learn after warping somewhere with no attempt at looking what they are warping into.
---
so the problem is not bombers?
---
20mil for a highsec 5/10 escalation? WHAT A STEAL! I know ingame channel that's dedicated to escalation trading and highsec 5/10 escalation goes 120-200mil even the lowsec ones are at 40-50mil price tag.
---
There's more than enough lore conflict in EVE. That's pretty much all you need.
---
100 anything vs 100 bombers will win, unless it is a coordinated bomb run. You can literally volley bombers with most ships they engage. Frigates moving at any reasonable speed will see more like 50DPS from the torpedos.
---
&gt; it makes the legwork a bit easier by saving some clicks but it is a publicly available tool anyone can use.
---
The real argument here is that the tool gives an advantage to players who know about it. There is no pointer from the game to the tool, you have to be in the community sphere for a while and happen to have someone namedrop it. *That* is unfair.
---
Another thing that's more or less BS is that there is no global market in game. Jita exists. There is really no point in obfuscating prices to "regional average".
---
And you believed them?

01 This is a bunch

3x medium traverse bulkheads  2  reinforced bulkheads 1 damage control.. sacrificng yield for survivability.. works in triglavian era.  this how my retriever survived
---
you can kill them  with  battlecruiser/battleship. just need web and scram them and apply missiles and drones
---
its sometimes worth to kill them... ofc  those  overkill rats not miners.
---
npc titans  bosoning jita undock?
---
&gt;Alliance
---
Kek no.
---
you cant bribe NPC, this is eve not no mans sky... all u can do is get friend  with bigger ship and kill bastard
---
The agency already provides delayed results. It's very much possible to see sigs in the agency, burn out to the system and the sigs are already gone.
---
If you were killed in an explo ship by T3Cs your just bad. If you were killed by a dictor there was nothing you could do he was camping there before you got there.
---
Don't bother with missions. Get a ship dedicated to running the anoms and DED sites. Get escalations and run DED sites and escalations.
---
I, too, am gay.
---
I would argue that most of the problems in Eve today are the result of diverting most of CCP's resources to other projects since 2009 when WoD and Dust began.
---
CCP _does_ need to ultimately develop a new product but they first need to both sort out their project management issues and put Eve back into a healthy place to prop up their company while they do that.
---
Join any of the newbie oriented nullsec groups. If you don't like it there, try the others.
---
Which works if they nerf it within a few months, not years.
---
yet....triglavians will   do this in lowsec soon and  eventually they will reach nullsec and maybe we will meet triglavians in wormholes.
---
&gt; it's nearly impossible to fit any kinds of defense modules for retrievers
---
That's why you use the Procurer when you don't know how safe you'll be.

So industrial players have an affordable way to light a cyno for their jf

---
Can it do that for non public Citadels?
---
Have you heard of evepraisal? It gives but and sell means, medians, mins, maxes, and top and bottom 5%ile for each of the major trade regions. That last word is really important because it doesn't work for the trade system itself so sometimes it's not exactly the same, usually on the buy side.
---
really u rate astero higher? But it cant fight anything big that is ratting..?
---
Tbh the market data really helps with seeding right stuff in the markets. Without those, you'd often have stuff running out and people unable to dock because shit didn't get seeded at right quantities. It also helps bring prices to equilibrium alot faster then having it done manually.
---
All of that in turn helps and keeps Industries churning right stuff across Eden.
---
Sleepers Rise Up
---
I find bombers cant really take any fights due to be so limited (u basically just avoid everyone cause u cant fight anyone lol)... So like why do u recommend hunting with a bomber?
---
Doing good work on this one, over last few years connected to them a lot, never ever have they undocked without faxes.
---
This is good base idea i would add on about the d-scan showing you the overview tab that it goes with
---
You can fit industrial cynos on T1 hauler (industrials in the patch notes). They are currently the cheapest ships that can fit a cyno.
---
Well I do not know for sure but if a chat monitoring program like near2 were to be of any use then many people would need to care, then make an effort to report  actual hostiles, and also not random blues when they do, in an Intel channel. It can only work well if many people 23/7 make the effort. So yes that would be high effort for the accumulation of people and time if not for the individual.
---
Bots? You tell me.
---
Rorquals, like anything it would be a case by case basis how much effort a mining operation required.
---
take your autism elsewhere
---
Hey can someone explain the uses of a command destroyer? they seem awfully niche but somehow there are videos online of solo magnus pvp even though ur jump field gen is kinda useless when ur fighting solo..?
---
It raises the cost to 1 alt with a corvette, so not that much. I guess it prevents that alt from ganking afterwards, but not much else.
---
I'm surprised TEST members aren't demanding the hot wings justice.
---
You can’t light a cyno with the new changes though. Also I have multiple carriers and supers so nah I’m not salty about a change that doesn’t affect me
---
PM me I have a shield one
---
Munins do just fine unless your fc is a mango and gets bombed by a non cloaky fleet.
---
That would actually be really funny. I might just crawl out of JSpace to watch that.
---
Kinda feels like only TAPI and Goons have been affected by this by all the posting happening. Did the carebears you've been courting stop logging in?
---
Rorq never should have left the POS.
---
Lol, doing everything for the bots except injection of the orders.  I am certain I’m fighting bots on market.  
---
I’m not sure ccp would ban them though because jita would be empty.
---
If you were really eager for a fight like you state in the video you wouldnt have brought stukas
---
Who's the bigger dong bag?
---
Me talking to another person about shit completely relevant to the fucking thread?
---
Or you chiming in with your stupid fucking uninformed opinion about "my general attitude toward life and other people" based on those three or four fucking comments.
---
What the fuck does "my general attitude toward life and other people" have to do with the number of people logging into eve any fucking way? Who the fuck are you to comment on it?
---
Burner in HS? I thought burner was only NS
---
can i have your stuff hype?
---
Out of the flow temporarily is a very good way of making 10 suicide recons seem like a nonissue. If you're acting like this change isn't a huge issue for returning players you're spinning as hard as GoonsTV.
---
Yes, it is weeding out the krabbrains that don't apply basic intelligence to their money making. Plenty of people including myself are finding it easier to make nullsec ISK then before
---
Only thing I can come up with is if the first recon gets popped, the DST let's you send in another. Not that I necessarily think that's a great strategy... lol
---
I would rather my F1 monkeys put points on when unnecessary than to not when they are necessary...

Triaging after everything is dead , lul

Sorry, I meant that as a progression, not actually "greater than"

Ah righty righty, Why do u prefer the legion? I heard lokis are better for hunting?... Just wondering for ur opinion
---
Hmm I knew of them but mostly just to see if contracts were priced correctly.  I'll check it out in more detail.
---
Thank you!
---
Okay, I laughed over here.

Here's your upvote you magnificent b@stard!

BuT iM nOT PaYiNg MoNEy
---
Presume they did this so if you camp an industrial cyno you aren't guaranteed a loot pinata. It could also be bait for a blops to jump to and bridge in other stuff.
---
Imo the npe is kinda patronizing. Click this, click that, activate guns etc. Granted it's not that intuitive so it should be explained in some way but it still is boring. Being called captain doesn't help either. Ideally the UI should make all that basic stuff intuitive but that's not going to happen.
---
What I think definitely should be covered is d-scan, bookmarks and invul timers. Those things are way more engaging and are actually the tools needed to navigate a pvp game.
---
Building a cyno takes minutes even from an entirely unresearched bpo.
---
But it from people who have never heard of that channel....
---
Wrong.  
---
If it was the fact, videogames wouldn't generate any adrenaline at all.
---
Nice strawman attempt.
---
Bonused neuts. In wormholes if you want to catch the bigger fish, they're often have MJDs so you need to fight in scram range anyways. Loki is good also, but not as good imo.
---
Ah right. But come how loki gets ussseed Sooo often. It's like one of the top used ships on zkill lol.
---
Have u got a fit btw? And what's ur opinion about the tengu for solo hunting?
---
That was a very consversative use of overheating. I usaly do overheat my cap booster and neut for the first 2 cycles.

These, and the ones you mention, all pull from the API and likely have similar data. Perhaps they differ in reliability, but I expect them all to have very similar, and accurate data.
---
funny thing, I did the opposite.
---
Did HS, NS and actually HS seems better to me.
---
Oh boy, no one let you in on the joke?
---
Your corpies are kinda mean :(
---
....how does black ops being able to jump and bridge to them accomplish that?
---
Blitzing highsec sites can turn a profit.
---
It's my "chill and watch netflix" acivity.
---
You arnt bothered about ticks. You are either scanning DED sites or farming escalations for DED loot.
---
A good day with good drops can not some great isk. A bad day just covers your ammo
---
So you're enjoying talking with your Corp or sitting there mining?
---
Do you enjoy mining alone? Just sitting there mining?
---
Because that doesn't sound like what you're doing.
---
The EVE universe is just not the best place for an FPS. I'm fine with a first person game, but I think it needs to be geared toward exploration and crafting to really be a good fit. I'm fine with some combat, but I think I'd rather spend a year building a land titan that I might never use than play a mindless deathmatch or capture the flag or something like that which has been beaten to death by a thousand other games. The fact that you're in an open world where losses hurt is what makes eve eve.
---
I hope you aren't actually a goon because that's a terrible post. Please lurk more.
---
Wow an idea that has never been posted before!
---
Good guy Vily
---
Well, how about making a unique game that works more like that? I'm not going to play a game where there isn't the option of being a pacifist. Conflict feels artificial without losses that have an effect and the option for peace.
---
And in the end you have one loot every 1h. Which means you reach 100M/h doing ded sites.
---
im laughing and crying and shidding it so funny
---
Trig invasions are the way to go for sure.

---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
No, I don’t. But I think d-scan is important enough to be covered when players are actively trying to learn the basics. Career agents are optional.
---
I thought he meant that he didn't hit warp. By gunning for him I meant that he was primaried, but I guess I wasn't clear? Sorry for the confusion.
---
yes.
---
1. Your only resource is your time
---
2. Eve is so complex that most people have no idea what they are talking about
---
3. Eve is dying. Nobody cares, have fun
---
Probably their way of saying "look guys we arent blue lol"
---
Pressing S now, sir
---
This is a pretty fair idea, actually... I played the game for actual years before really understanding how to effectively use d-scan and how important it is.
---
I am still shit at it but I am shit at most aspects of Eve, especially my posting.
---
"yes I'll take hyperspatial rigs for $400 Alec"
---
You can kill an inattentive ratting BS with a bomber, not gonna happen with an Astero.
---
Hilmar needs to make more money to please their Korean Overlords, so they are attempting yet another non-EVE project that is bound to fail.
---
Gives you a chance to escape in your pod if someone tackles you on a gate or whatever
---
i see you're fluent in sarcasm
---
Depends how inattentive, but yeah I mentioned there's certain things a bomber would be better at. Not a ton of totally AFK BS ratting in wspace though
---
Short of declaring war on them ourselves, is there anyway to assist a friends corp with a high sec war dec? I understand we can offer logistics to aid in moving ships and material looking more for combat options.
---
I love double-takes on killboards.  
---
\*\*Glance\*\* Ah... guy dies a lot. Clearly new  
---
\*\*Double-Take\*\* He's ISK-positive for absolute MILES!
---
Okay now I get the anger. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
There are definitely HS burners
---
More Teamplay now
---
Lmao
---
how much of said beer?
---
burners are in all space, but the amount of LP they reward depends on the security status of the system.
---
fair point.  
---
I wouldn't complain at all if only it were in invasion systems. Unpredictable rats with overpowered are randomly assaulting in normal space with no warning.  
---
Just feel wierd nullsec people, who had been crying for drifters assault is posting "this is eve" to this.  
---
same thing they had had in the null few weeks ago the highseccers are experiencing.
---
ccp never implements something, if there is some else who can do it for them (3rd party developer).
---
Are reactions supported?
---
You’re not listening, 
---
If you undock and don’t move you’re invulnerable, if you align and someone shots you, you can simply dock, most people use their own citidales so yeah, scrap all that because risk adverse. A noob pilot will fall for certain tricks due to lack of understanding, a knowledgeable pilot has very little change of dying(except what I mentioned earlier)
---
There is a JF that you can rep, I’ll let you do the research. That being said, good luck ganking it. Finally, you didn’t read anything previous. You completely disregard the fact you can insta warp your JF. Let’s say you bumped me and tried to gank me, you would be another hash mark to someone who tried an failed. To even catch me in the first place is extremely rare.
---
This is why JF need to be removed and everything should be gated.
---
Source?
---
Hmm ok.  I'll check again and post.
---
Do you know what the "Jita prices" above are?
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/Iu0zImo

I see you’re fluent in retard
---
So in PVP which turret type should be skilled first or is go-to version (that would fit most of the activity types, i.e. pve (missions, abyss) and pvp)? Lasers, hybrids or projectiles?
---
Imperial navy acolytes
---
&gt; against any other frigate
---
Try nergal mb?
---
You’re the bigger dong bag.
---
No.
---
aye.  only problem right now is pirates so cheap vs t2 (specially Battleships),   and typically have far better buffer tank and dps. in addition to gimicks.
---
Great work Xre !  Well done.
---
Kudos to one of the most easy going, honest, straight up guys I’ve flown with.
---
Recon cynos have allways been good in some situations
---
yeah i know, thats my whole point, this patch doesn affect my cyno dropping on any level.
---
&gt; regarding 1: battleships can't be regarded heavy tackle in cap fights. atm rorquals are often used as heavy tackle on cap level. 
---
BS definitely won’t be replacing capitals as heavy tackle. However that specific change definitely opens up the option a bit more to subcaps. At best it changes the number of ships needed to tackle a titan/super from 25/13 to 9/5. Not a huge change but a significant improvement. With the cyno changes coming up as well, the opportunities could grow a bit. Again, not at all a huge change, but opens the options up and could give some insight to further changes along the same line.
---
&gt; regarding 2: The neut amount of bhaalgorns is already fine... People know all this and already use bhaals to neut caps. Against a single capital that works very nicely. But if there are a bunch of caps the bhaals just die to quickly. No chance to even rep them because they just get volleyed.
---
You’re not entirely wrong, but my view on it is this: the current options for subcaps to cause significant disruption are fairly limited. Either having massive numbers (at which point DPS may be the better choice), or very specific/specialized ships. 
---
The idea is to make the ability more accessible flexible. Capitals already have pools we’ll out of proportion to the progression seen on subcaps, same applies to cap neuts. The bhaalgorn isn’t necessarily the best subcap option, it’s the only realistic option short of adding more pilots ad infinum. Higher accessibility means more doctrines can be used with having snowflake ships that don’t meld in the mix. Greater flexibility and higher overall impact from the ships in fleet. 
---
If the neuts on caps have any value, giving more power to more subcap options can give some of the same value as well. Just like how fitting a neut on your fleet ships can have some value, the same should work upwards as well. the gap from subcap module to cap module is just as out of proportion as everything else about capitals. Closing that gap somewhat can help.
---
Someone give this guy gold
---
haha now this is why i love this community.  Why did i use so many dots?  nope not over 40, not that it would matter.  less drinks next time i guess
---
just  boson  the astero off titan..
---
Highsec DED spam is 150-200m an hour.
---
Balancing? 🤣🤣🤣
---
It doesn't fit the jita price in this case that is true. I never look at those numbers and don't even know from where they are taken. Maybe the ingame item estimate or something like that? I only look at  sell (and buy) orders. Those are accurate except that it only updates every several minutes. I like evemarketer more because it's more responsive than eve-marketdata, which takes a while to load when I click on another item.
---
disgusting ship tbh
---
I stand corrected.
---
Stay in highsec until you know what you're doing. Don't join any corps because it's pointless in highsec. Don't listen to retardos saying you'll lose everything.
---
The market API for private structures is a bit different and I haven't implemented it yet. If there is enough interest it might be worth doing.
---
The public market API does include buy orders if the range is outside the station.
---
Had to apply for it a couple weeks back
---
All edge no tensile strength?
---
So is it possible to get solo fights in null anymore? I used to roam solo in AFs and cruisers and stuff. I would just set a destination with people in it and I'd usually encounter other people doing the same and get fights out of it. Consistent fights every unless it was some ass-end bitting region.
---
Now, I pop into null and the whole region is dark except for 2 or 3 systems. Those systems usually have a bunch of miners or ratters and they're relatively well defended. I'm glad miners and ratters actually have to defend themselves in space now so I'm not salty about that, but all of my most fun fights came from fighting other roamers on gates and stuff, and now that seems to be non-exist.
---
Ahahahahahah, how are you so bad after this many years of playing
---
Not yet, that's one thing I don't do so I didn't implement it from the start. A few people have asked about it though so it's on the list!
---

Your alliance has an interests in helping you out, they want you to come back after all.

Those are pushed back every time CCP makes concessions for pvp players

Warp speed isn't why they aren't used...
---
Unless your a shitty nano pilot
---
Very nice work.  Not sure if its my monitor, but the font looks goofy?  Otherwise very nice.
---
Thanks
---
I was gonna say this. 
---
We just need counterplay options to cloakys. They sit there, in perfect safety, watching and moving about; even warping around. Several dozen decloak, kill a ship and then cloak back up. Thrilling gameplay.
---
OP specifically said
---
&gt;   I'm a carebear, thinking of coming back to EVE just for some relaxation.
---
I mean it's a factor, but yeah, if CCP deleted the machariel tomorrow morning it wouldn't make people use T1 bs for anything

After the FW update and the munin rework

"Nerf one of the two vaguely usable BS and surely people will flock to use the the worthless ones!"
---
I think it has to do with tribalism and territoriality. 
---
Lindybeige would probably make a 2h video exploring this topic.
---
No, no, no, no
---
wut
---
nerf machariel warp speed bonus accordingly just means decrease their warp speed bonus so that they will still be 3 au warp speed instead of 3,75 (3 +50%)
---
and then you have less yield than a T1 cruiser, you are slow as fuck and you have as much EHP.
---
lol.
---
You could have had one done by now...
---
your friend is an idiot for playing in invaded system  and expecting to survive.
---
they literally wont be changed tho, just that every other battleship will have its warp speed increased
---
it's a troll, just block him.
---
TEST has spent months transitioning to armor to slowly change everyone over from us choosing the wrong FAX when they came out. We just can't tell our allies because then we'd have to admit armor superiority. As enough shield supers keep dying it will work out with nobody having to say they were wrong.
---
null pve is the punching bag for the moment
---
I 100% do not agree, look at games like dreadnaught. that control system would be brilliant with an eve game
---
I think I forgot to specify a fallback font after the main one. I'll fix that up
---
They literally don't have a balance team at all. There is no one who has their official job role.
---
Dealer’s choice.
---
This is what I needed. Been putting setting up my PI off because I wasn't sure how to set it up now that I have toons with CCU 5.
---
People like you will never be happy.
---
Should be 3au and +50% scan res. Their application should be their downside not everything other than their dps/tank.
---
like week ago we were at 2005
---
agree on the scan res, but not having them warp as fast as a cruiser
---
&gt; I think it's the worst
---
mlyp
---
Praise James!
---
Dumbest idea in the history of Blackout so far...
---
So you go after their drones first?
---
I mean, since we were at 2005 a few days ago it seems to be getting better ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Sadly, so much of the potential good that is D-scan is tied to how well the overview is setup, that a tutorial is a poor way to teach someone how to use it.  This is where in-game channels are a better route.  I agree that your intro would be a great way to showcase the feature.
---
Pretty much this. Another thing of note is that market trading doesn't inject new wealth (isk or materials) into the game, just moves and rearranges it across different characters.
---
It's one of the few isk making activities in the game that is not only self-adjusting and self-correcting for the most part, with little or no adverse effects on the macroeconomy of the game, but also scales in a very balanced manner in terms of risk/reward.
---
Sure, you can make billions without ever leaving a station, but you can also lose billions in the exact same way. You can go for low-risk, steady investments and take a few months to really build up your wealth, or try making the same amount in day in exchange for taking massive risks. You can even lose half a billion to a typo (been there, done that, twice in the span of 3 days, lol), just like you could lose the same amount by screwing up in a fight when flying an expensive ship.
---
I really see no problem with external market tools that facilitate this kind of gameplay, especially since the in-game tools are lacking and very bare-bones to a large extent. Nerfing such tools would be akin to nerfing things like Pyfa.
---
Welcome to the game!
---
For future reference, EVE doesn't allow "addons" like WoW, or even as many customizations, so color text and GM names are legitimate.
---
Here's the [official CCP scams policy](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203218892-Scams).  Item 2 says we cannot mimic CCP employees, so impersonating a GM or dev is bannable.
---
Here's a [list of common scams](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Scams_in_EVE_Online), on the EVE University (player run) site.  Gives you an idea of what to look out for.
---
It sounds like you need to join a more competent corp/alliance to properly teach you the game. 
---
HICs are commonly used, and amazing when used by a very good pilot. 
---
Defender missiles are your counter play to bombers. In your situation you had an Assault damage control, I don't know why you didn't use it, you don't always need to wait for the FC to call everything. You're a human being, not just a relay.
---
If your current corp/alliance doesn't adapt their doctrines to use the right tools, get in touch with the FCs and all, and not in an argumentative way, pick their brain on the fleet comps. If they don't want to adjust and adapt to current meta, then it might be a good time to leave them for a more learning oriented group.
---
You’ll fit in well here with that paranoia, welcome aboard!
---
Time for 50 T1 cruisers.  Have fun and good luck!

The only problem with that is that it can turn into free intel about PushX JF-flying alts, and their movements or incoming movements.  I know Black Frog uses in-corp JF characters, but I don't believe that PushX does.  If you see a JF jump to a PushX-specific cyno alt, it's free intel.
---
Ultimately and personally, I'd rather just eat the cyno losses - it's a valid kill, technically speaking, and it's the cost of doing business.
---
It will load your orders, no matter where they are. However, the price undercutting feature currently works off the public regional market data. 
---
It's a bit of work to support private structure undercutting because I need to load orders from all structures you have access to, and store those orders separately from everyone else's, then I need to match based on range, etc. Totally doable with enough time but I wanted to get this thing out there and see interest before investing more time.
---
&gt;"Is this a scam?"
---
did he convince you to continue playing?
---
infinite anoms?
---
Why don't you post references to kills or BR?
---
And this will "buff battleships" how, exactly?
---
by increasing their warp speed from 2 to 2,5 can you read
---
Always assume it's a scam.
---
However I pretty sure it's very against the EULA to pretend to be a CCP employee for any reason at all so anyone trying that would be insta-banned if reported
---
Jump freighters will be able to Jump to the Indu cyno how i understand it
---
For future reference, yes EVE is full of scams but they must be "in game". Anyone posting links to get your IP or DL maleware onto your computer is going to get banned. Its not just against the EULA its also Illegal.
---
Also impersonating anyone from CCP, be it a GM or CCP dev is not allowed and is insta ban.
---
So RL life scamming isnt allowed in Eve. Conning you out of your isk is tho. They just cant hack your client to do it. It must be Confidence tricks etc.
---
SKillu is EU or NA?
---
New_player#29046 story posted on r/Eve, bittervet commits sudoku from seeing the same shit too many times...
---
Don't feel silly. Keep that paranoia dialed up to 11 man.
---
Im more than interested as always to know what you think i did wrong.
---
Now keep this attitude up about anything in-game and you should fit right in!
---
Concords role is to punish not protect, people can and do shoot people in HS. If it costs less to destroy your ship than the likely loot you will drop then expect to gain the interest of gankers
---
Just decloak one of the recons already on grid with the rorqs man.
---
The roaming triglavs in highsec are having an extremely negative affect against new players and casual players. I don't know why people think this is a good thing. Most people killed by them didn't know they existed and don't know what they are so they just stop playing. New players killed by them (sometimes in the starting systems) won't be coming back either.
---
Yeah, like warping to a safe spot or planet and then warping to rorq etc.
---
Imagine having something called a microwarp drive on your Munnins so you could do advanced tactics like burning out of bomb range. I know this sounds very elite but I’m confident at least someone in your munnin blob can do it and all the dumbos like you can just approach him.

He's in TEST, of course he is

The ghost of Henry Van Dyke lurks in New Eden.

I can send you an official list of all the know Eve scams, just send me 200 million isk......

To be fair he didn't deface an image of the actual memorial.
---
If you find one let me know. I'm in the same situation as you. Very sporadic schedule and usually play solo.
---
We involved our newbros and we actively kill them. I use an Ikitursa and watch my mining buddies :)

What else can be said that others haven't said already in this thread? Send me 100m and I'll double it for you.

---
5 kills 2 losses idiot
---
&gt; we cannot mimic CCP employees
---
thanks for the DnD one-shot idea
---
Actually you are right. I live in a part of null which may colour my view on attackers as they tend to fall either side of a certain level of competence: either they get boson'd 5 jumps out or they are usually deserving of that much credit. The part I play in home defense means I tend to encounter the latter, even if they are rarer.
---
Just more lies and false promises from CCP.  Not even one dev could be bothered to write a quick post saying it was delayed or cancelled.  After all these years what do you expect from CCP and all there other failed or delayed promises.
---
Labia Face
---
Dredit is a Reddit based corp.  Also both english language heavy com
---
CCP probably have some contract with PS about releasing the game on another platform, even though we're almost 2 console generations removed from DUST.
---
Are you sharing your account with Valkorsia? This post is on his level lmao.
---
Hahaha, you'll do well here.
---
eh, wait till CCP wake up and give us a reason to go to war again.
---
population will spike.  right now...not really much to do with -high null sec-
---
It's the biggest scam of all ;)
---
So it adds a cost to being a cunt. Like I said.
---
With thinking like that, you'll fit in just fine here.
---
The mob is fickle....
---
First we get shield slaves, then a hull nerf, then back at square 1. Better stop asking for these things. I rather use my implant slots for something rather having to use shield slaves to have the same tank I have today without them.
---
Looks/feels really well done, while checking it out I noticed just how responsive everything was. 
---
One thing I'd like is the option to filter items by location instead of only by name while looking at market orders
---
They look like little [loaches](https://www.aqua-imports.com/shop/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Clown-Loach.png). So cute!
---
the long con
---
Yeah but 2005 there were no alphas.  
---
I really wanna know omega player numbers since they introduced alpha accounts.  
---
With the current skills an alpha can get (and the shockingly low amount of braincells (some) omega pilots have,) I can't tell omegas and alphas appart
---
Hard to hunt when those bears were churning out titans faster than we were gaining "new players"
---
"CCPls give me a win button."
---
You came away with a positive feeling toward CCP and Eve. It was a scam indeed.
---
I am honestly surprised by the number of bots this game has and how little real players really exist.  Wonder what that number would look like if we removed the alpha accounts.
---
Thanks! Shouldn't be too hard to add a station drop-down filter.
---
2006 neither but 2006 numbers would still be better than 2005 numbers regardless how many of them are alpha
---
Guys. Guys. Nerfing cynos will fix this.
---
This. The whole npe needs to be rebuilt. We need new default overviews we need new default d scans. our current defaults are practically useless get a guy who knows what hes doing to make a newbros OV. New Bros need to be thrown in with a community like eve uni to actually educate them. 
---
Eve has a tendency to ignore it's newbros
---
True. The problem is there are no clue for newbies what they are facing.  
---
Rats in incursions/invasions are fine because newbies are warned that hostiles are around there before entering the system.  
---
This new rats suddenly landing with no warnings and even sometimes they are awaiting there already.
---
I have fought with them and measured there DPS estimated 300-400 and they do respawn again and again.  
---
They respawned within one minutes after being wiped out, immediately. None of mining ships can tank this DPS btw.
---
I think newbies may feel it unfair, and will stop playing and will never coming back. CCP is eager to improve newbie experience but they have thing to do before that. They just have to stop this.
---
Lol you sound like a beta scrub to me. Although j4G goons are always like that lol.
---
Note that impersonating an ISD is also bannable, even though ISD aren't technically CCP employees. (rip barracuda)
---
That's not an FPS.. one could argue it's closer to a fighter sim than an FPS..
---
This is pretty much my go-to now.
---
*Laughs in T2 Gallente hull*
---
If my use case may be used, when I was on my market orders I actually had assumed typing the station into item filter would have filtered it. 
---
Why not build the additional filter into that? That way if someone else wanted to filter by region this addition wouldn't be a new dropdown.
---
Bannable? Well time to file a report and chatlogs
---
This.
---
I honestly think we should get some kind of factorio for PI production
---
Or an RTS style for PI ground control. An FPS dosent fit. Unless they're just ripping teamfortress.
---
It does suck to come back a few years later to discover all your ships are basically useless.
---
You are the right amount of paranoid. You should do well Eve.
---
Your diplos literally had a shitfit over this.
---
Ah, yea it could try to filter on several columns and go by the one with the most matches for that filter or something
---
The problem is the time needed to form to counter 100 bombers and just how easily bombers can get around the map with low risk.  If they double or triple jump the number of potential systems a bombers group could originate from is quite High.  This allows one group to effectively hunt several hundred systems if they have the eyes.
---
Ccu 5 is usless. Some people say it's usless without it but I've been running my pi for years with out it and it works fine for me. Some builds need it but it's usually not be extra building.
---
That  being said more planets means more resources. 
---
Pick a P4 item like wetware mainframes And build those. Unless your building fuel or implant stuff it's not worth the effort
---
I remember making a new account not very long ago, a GM found me as i was moving around in space, and they gifted me a Venture and a venture skin, to greet me to the game. So it does happen, This happened this year and i have been playing since 2010. So it took a while to happen to me.
---
Thanks.  Well I have it so I might as well put it to use when I need it (CCU5).  Maybe I'll just do P2's.
---
I think you misunderstood.
---
P4 mats are the only ones worth making unless you build your own implants and fuel. So pick a P4 and do it NOT the other lesser stuff.
---
Easier one is mortar applicators.
---
Buff cruisers to 4 AU then.
---
There's absolutely no reason to make travelling slow as fuck
---
You have some choice:  
---
\- Running Abyss sites in High Sec.  
---
\- Level 4 Missions inc. Burner Missions. (Only if you are Omega though).  
---
\- Completing '&lt;Faction/Pirate&gt; Refuge' Anomalies to get 4/10 DEDs.  
---
\- Running the 4/10 DEDs.  
---
\- Incursions/Triglavian Invasions (probably).
---
Pacifier says hello.
---
can you tight a PvP engagement though?
---
I believe the idea was to make things like Legacy's Friendship Cyno Fleet still work. 
---
Alternatively, I believe CCP may just be throwing a bunch of cards in the air and whichever land face up get cynos.
---
Cyno bit is a little less needed now considering the change but still a cool tool
---
I would start by serenading the market with some good 80s R&amp;B, then slowly expand each category before working my way back opening each subcategory. Save Pilot Services for last; you're trying to seduce the market; let it come first.
---
Now that amount of paranoia will make you fit right in :)
---
Eve is a game where you shouldn't trust even your own alts.
---
You'll have to provide a lot more information that if you want any meaningful help.
---
The age of chaos strikes again.
---
Did you post this on bsb?
---
I keep getting disconnects. So far I've lost 2 sets of Sisters probes as it happened while I was scanning my home wh's sigs.
---
Awesome!
---
Also very drunk at the time of writing. :cripes:
---
I started back in 2013 and still feel bad about ignoring the friendly GM trying to welcome me to the game. I assumed he was a scammer and just didn't reply!
---

Correct, ISD are volunteers (and have to suffer some really infantile shit).
---
I personally don't trust GMs since I discovered they support scamming through exploits as part of the Meta game.  CCP promotes their game play as part of the universe they have created so, don't you trust them blindly.  In my case, my bad experience was made even worst by GM Spartan, who took the side of the scammer and denied the exploit.  All I am saying to you is, as in the normal world, there are good GMs and not that good GMs, some promote the DARK SIDE of EVE Online and that could be frustrating for new and old players.

lmao found the CCP employee reddit account

you do know that you can just reconnect to them, right?

&gt; dishonorable conduct such as scamming, theft, ransoming, extortion and corruption are considered an integral part of EVE Online
---
The point here for the new dude, is dishonorable conduct such as scamming, theft, ransoming, extortion and corruption are considered an integral part of EVE Online and he can't rely in CCP to help him.  I think he did good on been cautious with that " CCP welcoming new players" trick.  That GM may want to be your best friend until he takes it all, like in real life.   The thing is EVE Online has no laws or cops to protect you for those scums.
---
I won't even jump my super to a cyno lit by my own cyno alt.
---
Is eve dead? how popular is it anymore. I've been playing about 10 years but haven't been active for a while? What's eve like these days?
---
Look at mr lucky over here who got to start with Paranoia V already trained phht.

someone should  evict  HK from their renal scamming wormhole and someone drop containers around  with this reddit link

Losing players with 10+ alts is only a loss for CCP. Long term health of the game is more important.

A mimic but instead of being directly killing you, it just makes it so you don't know who is in the room with you until they stab you

Hey mate thanks for the response, 
---
Take a look at that specific warning when it's released on Tuesday, hopefully you'll see its quite subtle and only presented as a cautionary recommendation rather than a things you are doing wrong.
---
That _is_ a concession to pvp players
---
Sounds like he should send another 7b i'm sure he would get it that time.
---
I think i was able to recover one set but it seems if you don't reconnect on the next login you lose them permanently.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Truth.  I gave my alt a few billion once, and that assclown lost it all on SOMER blink.
---
It can make reporting them harder, but lo local still puts them at greater risk than before.
---
Many times they can't for sure know if someone has left system so they reset and go back out, giving you the chance to kill them
---
This one will go far, I fear :-)
---
nonono they said summer, they never specified which summer. so summer 2029 seems realistic.
---
Like, trying to die quietly in a freighter rather than letting everyone in system/alliance know you are getting gang banged so that they can take appropriate actions? That kind of initiative?
---
Did you have a stroke while typing?
---
There is not one to give. Bots vary in complexity I'm sure, so behavior will vary. Was the myrmidon group a bunch of bots? A human using input broadcasting and a cloaked gate scout could do the same. Why were so many in one anomaly? It could have been someone testing.
---
As for are bots gone? No. It's a job and accounts and ships are tools to be replaced or changed for the task. Do they need local? Not likely as the chat protocol is not encrypted and shows the list, the client we use is what obscures it. Does blackout hide the problem? Somewhat but not totally.
---
What kind of sick individual scams potential renters?It’s an outrage!
---
You are going to LOVE this, ccp just introduced a new ship class in the game way back in 2007 called the "stealth bomber" so these things can just put a afterburner on and be completely untrackable by light fighters. I hope noone finds out about this and uses them exclusively to kill capital ships with 1/10th the isk risk.
---
Trolling doesn't suit you
---
It's not a troll, just remove pve it's so simple
---
So.... where will the ships come from if there’s no Indy? Are we just killing each other on corvettes? That sounds.... well...
---
Blackout has made this type of camp doable
---
The economy won't function that way.
---
It's a sausage party bro.
---
Bounties are useless. When you kill someone with a bounty on him, you gain 20% of is ship value.
---
9 times out of 10 they would have died anyway. Bounty hunting isn't a profession as such because your max payout is something like 20% of the value of the ship they died in minus what they dropped.

---
Belief has nothing to do with it. Although we do not have full and up to date numbers, according to Hillmar AMA on official forums we had 1.6 active accounts in the game per player. That surpass 30 percent. So out of 30k people shown online actually around 12 k are not people, not players. You can calculate your numbers from that. Out of 24k about 9k are not actual plàyers, etc etc.
---
You can make further calculations by using numbers from sec reports, not that hard.
---
Later on, not long ago but I forgot where and when exactly, one of the CCP stated that the game is slowly improving on this front and this number is now at around 1.5 accounts per person logged in. This was a few months ago and I haven't heard anything since on the subject.
---
Going further, they did state they'd rather lose players then have the game go in this direction. So they would rather make less money then have Eve become nothing but multiboxed afk accounts and bots.
---
Which is a good thing. So yea, if the owners of such leave then so be it. It's a really good thing even if we end up with a smaller player base. Your other option is to become Serenity 2.0. and this is not acceptable for anyone.
---
Why are you trying to scam honest, hard-working wormholers? What did they do to you?
---
HikikomoriRD has been killed and a bounty of the sum of 31,806,477 ISK has been claimed.
---
I'd kill someone for 31 mil.
---
Most EvE scams are based on two faults of the victim. First is greed. If it's too good to be true it probably isn't. The second is misplaced trust. Trust nobody unless you have real leverage over them
---
so what exploit were you scammed by?
---
Sounds good.  So this and that's it when it comes to checking prices?  Also, what does logging in with Eve allow?  I'm iffy about having my Eve info out there, of course.
---
&gt;am I wasting isk?

for skillfarm 6m SP char it is pretty good ;-) yes it miss auto targeting, because it needs to be import from hisec :-X

You dont like changes? Just quit.

You like it - pay them your monies.
---
Been a while since I’ve played, but you could probably do some guerrilla warfare style stuff. Quick hit and runs in mining ops, raiding logistical lines. Not sure if that’ll keep your identity secret. If not, contract a group of people to pirate them for you
---
Your jump field is the entire reason why you use it for solo PvP. You boosh your enemy off of the gate then tackle them. This way they can't crash gate, and you just seperated them from the group.
---
He's adorable, can we keep him?
---
Wait ... so nothing died in nullsec before the blackout? C'mon.
---
Because there is only one way to win eve.
---
How do you feel about suicide ganking? If you aren't part of the wardec, you can't legally shoot them, and they can't legally shoot you. So you could bring in a full DPS gank squad with jams or something in the mids to a fight. Jam all the logi and blap a primary or two before you go down. It won't be isk efficient, but it could cause your friends to hold field at the end of the fight.
---
They aren't. They ban people for exploiting.
---
Are you talking about visually or mechanically?
---
Dude i LOVED the part where you killed that afk ship. LOVED IT.
---
Nice dude. 
---
Dude.
---
NICE!
---
:thonking:
---
The jump field generator is extremely useful even when flying solo. It allows you to force enemies to split up. You can kidnap a target and 1v1 it while the rest of the enemies try to catch up to you.
---
Most of my experience with jump dessies is with fleets, where they're either providing links, defensively zooping friendlies out of trouble, or offensively zooping enemies away from where they want to be.
---
No, you are pushing the exploit thing without providing evidence of an exploit.
---
Is this Partridgian? Slightly edited?
---
Not the topic on this posting, just making a point.
---
No it makes perfect sense. 3 million ISK is nothing, they've been flying cheap ships and dying.
---
In my career in Eve, I have never, ever given a shit about bounties. I shoot at people or I don't, but bounties have never played a role in my target selection.
---
The Dominix and Raven (and their navy variants) are very effective and significantly cheaper than the pirate faction ships everyone is suggesting, though those are the *most* efficient. When I did L4s I found the Raven was decent but didn't tank very well, while the Raven Navy did slightly more DPS with a much stronger tank and was easily capable of handling any mission.
---
I mean it makes perfect sense to have scamming via in-game methods be perfectly viable. It's not like they're exploiting any bugs or anything.
---
A little common sense is able to see right through most of the common scams.
---
I don't believe you.
---
Killing PvE ships isn't PvP
---
I had a 4/10 drop 550mil the other day. Felt like CCP broke a loot table or something lol
---
the only use for bountys is to scare noobs by making them think they will be hunted for a 10m bounty..

According to Frigates of Eve, Atron has only one crew member which is the capsuleer I presume.
---
I agree with you completely and your thoughts are felt by many new players that have no idea what these things are. They're extremely strong npcs to face for a new player with no appreciable reward and their random nature makes it unpredictable if the the poco, belt, or gate you land on has these on them. After a new player loses their hard earned new ship two or three times to these it seems broken and they don't bother continuing with the game.
---
Well? Go on then, tell us the story.
---
Posted it, view to whole thread again to see.
---
Realistically how many high sec new bros have friends that strong to defend them?
---
Not enough of them.

---
Just because someone 'exploited' you via game mechanics, doesn't mean they used an exploit. You did not to provide any evidence or even anecdote of the actual exploit.
---
This but I wouldn't phrase it as he combats pay better. Your looking for deds and escalations NOT anomalies hs anoms are trash and for the newest of newbros. Honestly they need to be rebalanced IMHO

Looks like alot of people are agreeing with you, a few thousand more and we will all win eve when ccp shuts down tq!!

Doesnt matter dont think about it. Just understand you are playing your game wrong and you need to play it like me so I can have fun.

You have no proof of that. Play the game how I like to play or just unsub.

What do we gain by burning test space? We don’t need their space, and it’s a chore to burn raitaru after raitaru.   If we go t serious they’d just have goons end the fight before test loses anything of note

This is my only issue I think. I don't always move shit in fleets as most of my solo moves are just getting something back to staging after having to split from fleet for some reason. Losing a rookie ship was nothing but losing 200+ mil is unacceptable for a cyno. This won't affect corp/alliance level stuff but for the individual, it's a pain. I don't grind much and as such the easier option is not to participate. I feel this is a common scenario and conclusion. En mass this deminishes logins.
---
Sooo I'll throw my two cents in.
---
Orca is a good idea for your first alt. But honestly Indy is garbage unless your in a NS alliance or have access to a wh with Indy stuff. Hs and ls don't have high enough bonuses to warrant their use. Profit margins for T1 stuff is tiny so I actually suggest you run your main for combat explo stuff, and a few afk orca alts and just sell the ore till you can sustain the isk to invest in Indy.
---
Indy is like trading it takes isk to make isk. Yes T1 stuff is sometimes a better return on your T1 mats such as trit and stuff but compressed ore also has a decent markup.
---
So unless your building stuff and not caring about the profit side go ahead. But if your actually looking to make isk learn the system then move to higher profit items orca's other capitals. Then T2 and trig stuff.
---
It's not a scam ffs, I've been renting my C6 for the last 2 years. There have been two eviction attempts and my rental officer has organised a defense each time without me having to lift a finger. Every time you see these complaints it's either some poor fucker that can't afford one, or someone didn't read the agreement. Stop spreading lies.
---
i uninstalled after 2 weeks trying to this game got destroyed trying to do mining pve or ratting even trying to explore for a bit. lost what i earned mostly. time consuming and people trying to scam you everywhere. you better off not playing
---
Overviews being an issue is a common refrain, but it's also really hard to create a set that is good for all aspects of eve.  I had to change my overviews significantly when moving from high sec to null.  Are there specific things about the default overview that you think should be changed?
---
supers
---
You'll do great, kid. Always be suspicious.
---
I fully agree.  Not enough attention is paid to actually piloting the ships in the tutorials, and quite a bit is focused on how to do missions, mine, fit ships, and build stuff.
---
MFW animations don't render then you shit post. oof
---
Oh God yea. New ships on them being one. The default OV is literally usless IMHO 
---
There isn't a HUGE difference in OV if you have a good one to start with. I use UBLs unfucked with some tweeks and it works great. Make that default ffs. 
---
I understand not everyone wants the same OV that's fine it's still customizable we just need to make it very clear for newbros.
---
Yea the counter was the stuka simply not seeing the spool up animation otherwise they would've been fine
---
Imagine creating a throwaway account for something that you barely can call opsec.
---
Was nothing to do but laugh as we were squashed by titans
---
Nice try OP, good luck scamming people with your GM name and blue text.
---
yup, at least half of the horde fleet didn't see the animation before it was too late, including the fc
---
&gt;real life life
---
Looks good, i'll try it at some point. I'm still using the evernus fork a guy made after the original developer abandoned it, but i might migrate to an online tool simply because evernus loads up a lot of data locally if you fetch a lot of item orders across multiple regions and it gets kind of slow (lots of RAM usage i assume). In other words, you can't just pull a snapshot of the entire market across all regions in evernus. Having it server side would probably be faster and allow for fetching more data.
---
To the people asking about support for private citadels, unless they changed how the API works it's a bit of a pain to setup. Private citadel support was also one of the reasons evernus was so slow at times.
---
In simple terms, what happened was that the software had to query the ESI to see in which citadels you had docking rights first, in order to build a list of citadels you can actually access and do business from (no use fetching orders from structures you can't dock at/buy from/etc).
---
However, "try for access rights in citadel" endpoint in the ESI did not return a "yes/no" reply, but rather a "yes/error" reply. The problem is that in order to punish certain malicious behaviours (eg, querying an end-point non-stop with wrong data, like in a brute force attack), once you get a certain amount of errors the ESI throttles your requests. So, what usually happened is you'd start the downloading of data and the more citadels the software had to query for docking rights of your character, the more error messages you would accumulate and the slower the ESI would respond to you.
---
I don't know if this has been fixed (eg, changing the citadel rights endpoint to return false instead of an error), or if it is still an issue.
---
I’ve been evolved with every partisan deployment since the start and this one has been terrible, for the first time ever the numbers just didn’t appear, we got a few good fights but they were few and far between.

I don’t blame alpha or the fcs or even test lol they’ve all done a fantastic job, just seems the plays aren’t there, partisans has always been a popular group (especially in the beginning) just now now

No, you literally bitched about GMs allowing exploits. Please, back that up or retract your statement.

Tbh I'd listen to a straight up audio only version or the YT video that shoots to an RSS feed. But I do understand the problems of trying to schedule vidya gaem stuff. TiS is a meme at this point and they've all pretty much become caricatures of themselves. The last "CCP better listen to us null leaders!!!

None of which really matters in the current eve as resources are plentiful.

Territory is a pain to control more than you need

Politics is dead as no real grudges remain from old days and no one takes new ones seriously to invest time like the old guard.

Security.....welcome to null highsec. Where the effort to evict is so fking nuts and dull. With dmg caps and reinforcement timers for cheap. Easy to replace.   Gl evicting without an army of pvp bots to do it

***This is from the Spectre Fleet debrief channel***
---
Operation: Piñata
---
Operation Pinata began with DHS carrying out a blitz reinforcement of five structures; Three Raitarus, an Athanor and an Astrahus in a C4 wormhole.
---
After some minor resistance from the owner of the structures, I gave Maded intel on all five structures and informed him that there was a chance of a capital escalation from the owner of the structures. With this intelligence, it was decided that SF would be able to form for four of the structures and happily partake in the loot pinata.
---
The day of the first pinata came about, and upon my group engaging the Astrahus, the enemy undocked four capital ships to prevent the death of that structure; Two Phoenixes, a Minokawa and a Nidhoggur. With this escalation coming much sooner than expected, I sent both Maded and Mar5hy information on the entrance to the hole, the capitals present and their current status, and a plan was formed. Both blopsec and SF kikimora fleets were formed and proceeded straight to the entry system, standing by on the entry hole. DHS proceeded to once more return to the structure and began shooting it once more in the final ten minutes of it's repair timer, forcing the enemy to engage. Upon doing so, two DHS onyx pilots lit their bubbles; the trap was sprung and their demise was all but assured - both Kikimora fleets jumped into the hole and immediately warped to the capital group.
---
What followed was a veritable bloodbath, with all four capitals and the Astrahus dying one after another. After the capitals were killed, Blopsec gave their thanks, and proceeded out of the hole back to highsec and wished us good luck. SF proceeded to continue with the prior planned op, hitting their structures. During one of the bashes, we realised our own Astrahus in system had just begun a repair timer, and we discovered that an enemy HAW phoenix was hitting it; so while five kikimoras remained on grid to keep a raitaru paused, the rest of the fleet went straight to the Astra and the phoenix began quickly dying under the firepower. Just before said phoenix died, the enemy warped a Chimera in a misguided attempt to save their dying dreadnaught, and as such, the chimera also fell prey to kikimora and T3C force.

This marked the end of part one of Operation: Piñata - 1 billion isk lost, 40 billion isk killed, 15 billion isk loot from the assets in the structure dropped, making a total of 55 billion isk lost from the enemy side.

Operation: Piñata Part Two, Electric Boogaloo
---
Part two of Operation: Piñata came about once two groups, Trigger Happy and DHS successfully managed to reinforce the enemy's capital staging Fortizar and their industrial rigged Tatara into hull, with minor SF assistance with one of the two armour timers, in a two day operation that ensured the final timer would be on the day after the armour timer, Friday. Timers were given, and fleets were prepared to form. On the Friday, the enemy batphoned assistance from other wormhole groups, A Class Apart and Chain Smoking, both of whom formed and attempted to secure hole control early on. A flashform was attempted but ultimately unsuccessful, and Maded was given intelligence about the enemy force. This ultimately resulted in an impromptu drake fleet being formed, and what followed was the rapid reponse and quick death of the enemy Drake Navy Issue fleet, whom had no logi to assist them after they had rolled themselves out of the target hole.
---
Within an hour, the drake navy issues had reformed and came back to the hole and a battle for scanning begun, getting entrances and preventing rolling by the enemy fleet to ensure SF and Trigger Happy could get into the hole for the two final structures. With an entrance secured, half of the SF fleet made it in through a critical wormhole while a Tempest was attempting to roll it, and collapsed the rolling Tempest out of the hole before forcing the Drake Navy Issue fleet into a hard retreat. A new entrance was scanned, and the remainder of the fleet was brought in and staged. The Tatara timer came about, and a mediocre resistance was put up by the Drake Navy Issue fleet, who lost around six people, before being forced off and quickly followed with the death of the Tatara. An hour later, the battle of the Fortizar began.
---
Hole Control had been called in by the enemy group to assist, bringing the total enemy fleet up to around sixty in number with logistic, tackle and boosh support. Our numbers were around one hundred, with kikimoras, T3Cs, logi and boosh support. This lead to a drawn-out engagement on the fortizar, with both groups slowly bleeding numbers while the Fortizar hull percentage slowly dripped down. The Fortizar finally died, and both fleets did some short looting before disengaging from the grid. After roughly an hour or two of small battles and looting of the grid, the day was finally over; marking the end of Operation: Piñata
---
13 billion isk lost, 57 billion isk killed, at least 20-30 billion isk in loot from dropped assets, making a total of anywhere between 70-100 billion isk lost from the enemy side.

Massive thanks to all pilots who were involved, this has been nothing but fun for all groups, and definitely gave us some interesting fights and kills in the process.

Why is losing a 40m ship a "risk" to your operation? If you can't eat the loss, you're doing it wrong.
---
Doesn't make him less adorable
---
To bad you can't trust Panfam...
---
&gt; Wormhole space warriors will have to get good at killing caps with subcaps in C4 space.
---
That was a lot of words to say "As an entity that never had enough people to actually defend my space, I am an sad that my space got taken and the game is just going to stagnate even more because of it."
---
I have been saying for almost 2 years now this would be the conclusion of the changes being made in eve.  
---
Frigates vs Titans.
---
Extreme Power creep on both ends meeting as the only viable combat left.
---
same question to you but did someone hammer your head while typing.   have broken keyboard and  no funds to afford new. already copying   few letters due to malfunction,exacly 1/4 of keyboard is not working.
---
"exploit" has a specific meaning in Eve. It doesn't mean to exploit someone's trust. It means to take advantage of a known bug in the game
---
i think this Tl;dr is missing a "but muh space bushido" somewhere
---
Cracks forming, this is where chaos comes from not local.
---
good lord those comms....
---
Anyone who's run Stuka or Goku knows how fragile and memey it is.  Nobody thinks they "have no counter," they just exploit the natural home defense meta of "drop caps on everything."  When someone who knows how to play against it turns up in an AF or T3D fleet you generally just have to dock up the bombers or lose them all.
---
GitHub/Gitlab?
---
Shit, I knew I'd forgotten something! I should probably also add a 'Grr evictions kill content' as well.
---
Yes, the arms race of align time, I have also spoken how this is ruining eve.
---
6s combat probes and bombers killed 80% of fleet comps.
---
i mean, if you want to cover everything theres also "nullsec content will die because null mass exodus to wormholes"
---
The MER shows that WH is the biggest influence of ISK Faucet per Active Player.
---
Any economic whine about VNIs and null anomalies are misguided.
---
Ergo, A leads to B leads to C.
---
If you had a complaint about capital EHP levels, or Sub-capital Reps, or Align Time Arms Race, or MJDS, or combat probes, I would concur.  But most people massively fail to understand the eve economy, even though they use it as a fundamental base for their arguments and playstyles.
---
Basically this, and some added 'Spectre isn't neutral because they shot me!'
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
was it eviction?

Remind me who runs from the fights????
---
I agree. I was on Dust514 since beta release and loved it. Super sad they took it away and really think its original interactions with FW seemed fine. 
---
On the dust side, FPS was okay. Lots of hot fixes for bugs and correcting values for damage on guns and trying to keep DUMB AF tanky scout metas at bay. But it was still fun. All we needed was more maps
---
Eve side was okay with the interacriona. Kinda useless in the FW side except for orbitals but that was it. 
---
Wish they would just finish or beta release Legion or Nova or whatever its called now. (I stopped following it after seeing the trash gameplay) WHICH still had the Eve's great story.

This is "just a GAME" if it doesnt provide enough fun u know what to do.
---
Let CCP, CSM, bots, community adapt to new situation. Monies will take over CCP next year, u can be sure they will extend monetization to p2p or p2w to keep income for PA.

CCP doin cheap changes all the time. How they want to keep people ingame by nerfing everything whole year?::D

Counterpoint: I hate podcasts and videos.

One person on comms called it but they were drowned out by everyone else just talking about random dumb shit. Terrible comms discipline

Wait there arent players flying those PVE ships? I feel like acronyms arent your specialty

It's not paranoia when they really are all out to get you.

Huh a checked and it actually was a couple hundred words shorter.

Ha ha, I get it, you get it. I was replying for those unaware on here

If you find somewhere like that, let me know.

What?

There isn't many WH corps that could defend against what was brought.  I kinda feel bad for the guy.
---
Fuck off chadrick
---
Welcome to Eve. Make sure you purchase a Mining Permit by sending 10 million ISK to the character Empire Ganking Alt.
---
Not all players are male, theres a corspe or two or 20 of mine around, sadly i cannot stop dying. Good job we have the rebirth facility I say.
---
&gt;  A noob pilot will fall for certain tricks due to lack of understanding, a knowledgeable pilot has very little change of dying(except what I mentioned earlier)
---
That's the second time you've made that argument. I decided to ignore the stupidity of the statement the first time, but not this time. Any ship is relatively safe to fly for a knowledgeable pilot *who knows how to pilot that ship.* And why shouldn't it be? That's the reward you earn for taking the risk of learning to fly a top-tier ship of any class. Adrenaline? There are all sorts of ways to get an adrenaline rush in EVE. If you need the hit and aren't already getting it, maybe that's a problem with you and not the game. You've been talking about risk vs reward, and probably the biggest risk inherent to shipping has absolutely nothing to do with whether you personally get an adrenaline kick out of flying freight. Be thankful high-end contracts have collaterals in the billions for a service that pays out for not a whole lot, or you'd see a hell of a lot more jump freighters and other transports out there, and then you'd really have something to whine about.
---
The cloak campers and hunters with multiple accounts agree with you or not?
---
The group that started the eviction isn’t even a nullsec group, they take far more fights than your Corp does and actually add something to WH space. You also complain about NS players joining WHs to build caps in low class space but that’s exactly what you did, meanwhile basically bragging about being a big krab that takes no fights.
---
Spectre joining in is a bit bizarre but what did you expect? You basically gloat about adding no content to WH space. 
---
TL;dr 2 man krab corp gets evicted by npsi batphone, complains that “nullsec” will be moving in like it’s a worse replacement
---
Correct
---
SEE THAT EVERYONE!
---
TEST is sending people from command to try and silence me from spreading the truth!
---
For new account and to do some incursions/FW/Abyss/Missions (and later PVP), which turret type would be better to focus first? Hybrids, Lasers or Projectiles?
---
why record this
---
Hey remember that time I crashed out your entire fucking combat fleet and all our structures repaired to full? That kind of shit doesn't show up on killboards but fuck that was awesome.
---
Or all the times I reinforced your structures with 10 of you docked staring out the window?
---
CCP's nullify/stab bug is not my problem. But at least I undocked and tried something.
---
Cloaked until hitting f1 isn’t “activity” either buddy
---
Stagnation comes from lack of interactive conflict, and cloaking with nullification and zkill killed that
---
During the fort engagment , the Defending fleet lost like 1 ship. The Kiki fleet refused to engage and split into 3 diffrent groups all avoiding fighting and just shooting the fort. Even after the fort was killed the fleets refused to engage the Drake fleet and instead warped off with individuals staying to attempt to loot.
---
To clarify the numbers there were 55 defenders
---
- Vorlash, Reddit 2019.
---
Thank you, Mr. Captain Obvious, Sir!
---
Let's just remember how many experts declared Eve officially P2W.
---
Chaos era is working apparently.
---
Another failed deployment? After Branch etc ... =)
---
CCP is making it easier for newer players.  You gotta get up to speed on the Chaos era brah.  /s
---
Unfortunately all you're left with, if you cant get a name, is to report the system to the internal email system and that will require a lot of labour on CCPs part.
---
[removed]
---
If you give me 100m ISK I will gank the GM for you
---
I agree.  Null sec blocks, time to invade every single wormhole and eject their current residents then take up residence.  It will give you something to do while CCP throws things at the wall and see's what sticks.  /s
---
I kinda feel bad for all the ISD that have to deal with all the turbo retard trolls in rookie help.
---
I get what youre goin for but there is legit no reason to war in nullsec. You dont get loot like in whs. Resources are spread evenly (roughly) through nullsec so theres no reason to invade for better mats or anything. The way current null is setup it just really doesnt encourge large conflict other than for the sake of having large conflict, which is alot of work. They need to create some benefit for nullsecers to attack eachother and itll happen.
---
Had me until Gouda... some of the most vile cheese in existance.
---
hehehe, doubt you can kill their OP GM ship.
---
You can't even barely call it opsec, lol; it's a public SIG in a public alliance.
---
Normal Help channel is far worse, in my experience.
---
I do remember that, it was the first time i actually felt any kind of respect for you xxxxx  
---
I also remember all the times i woke up after a good nights sleep to see our throwaway raitaru had had its shield reinforced while we slept... only for the timer to go by uncontested what was it??? 3 or 4 times before you called for your 10+ Navy drakes and 10+ ravens as backup to deal with 10 T3C's and acctually kill it???
---
also you forgot to mention the POS that you killed.... was abandoned and offline when you killed it :) (just like all the other POS's on your KB)Love and stuff xxxx
---
 [u/birtzflap](https://www.reddit.com/user/birtzflap/) probably likely that there used to be no such thing as male and female corpses and all corpses in game were turned into one type.
---
What basically happened was that boson and Lance spooling animations never showed. 2 Goon Titans fired DDs, the first was a lance that missed, the 2nd a boson that hit. People in fleet assume it was some sort of desync. I'm not sure if we got it on video tho. Don't worry, CCP will claim the lack of spooling animations is a new feature. All welcome the era of chaos.
---
I do my part to make it terrible late night USTZ
---
You could consider adding this info (possibly optional / only for subscribed users, if you'll decide to go this monetization way):
---
1.Last kill made by this char (with a zkb link):  
---
1.1. Date/time of that kill
---
1.2. Ship type used in the kill
---
1.3.Amount of attackers
---
Depends on what your definition of win is. My winning is not playing. I'm currently not paying and not playing. So for me eve isnt p2w
---
That's not a complaint. It's an analysis of how the blackout is affecting eve.
---
Adapt or die.
---
Yet here you are on r/eve
---
I mean, there _is_ video.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5NN1KMBT-s
---
Realise that this was recorded by a spy and you are listening to both goon and horde comms. Also the spy is in horde main comms where people have a tendency to chatter while not on a stratop
---
Of course it was going to die anyway you made sure it would with 600k damage on your "valued allies" titan.
---
Spectre isn't neutral because they came back to the same objective 3 times.
---
Shooting people is what they do.
---
People on r/eve were both wrong and over exaggerating? ShockedPikachu.jpg
---
Ahh I see. I was going to say, if my alliance comms were like that i'd be looking for a new alliance.
---
Aaaand the post is meant as a warning of things to come for wormhole space.
---
Pretty sure the video shows exactly what you did wrong.
---
You're joking, right?
---
This is nothing to do with blackout you utter fucknugget. Lmao
---
There is a big difference between PvP and Seal Clubbing. PvP requires skill, killing ratters and miners does not.
---
Nope. Just find it strange for someone to claim they were scammed via exploit but refuses to expound on that. Sounds like a liar to me.
---
Also, the word you are looking for is "piqued"
---
I have a better idea. I think anyone in null should have a 75% chance of blowing up on undock.
---
If you survive, you have a 75% chance of the structure you dock in blowing up instead.
---
This will save the game, honest.
---
Not really, but ok.
---
any one stupid enouff to tag there self gm wouldnt be around long any way but your smart to be woried scams are legit game play and some of them are down right sneaky
---
Thanks for the grammar correction.  Again,  the details of what happened to me a couple of years back is NOT a topic on this posting.
---
I too think a 200 man responce fleet to be able to be able to save a capital from mining or ratting, from a single force recon is a great way to encourage roaming pvp content.
---
It's gotta be one of those dumb goon spies that thinks posting pings from a public sig group in a public alliance makes them a super good spy. lol
---
To be honest I agree with the GM, dishonorable conduct is central to Eve, it's what makes trustworthy friends so valuable in the game and it means people can have the choice of what type of character they are going to play in the game. It also means you gotta keep your wits about you. You could try and out scam the scammers too. It's all in the game bro.
---
They'll always be primaried first though
---
You're in the wrong game... 
---
Or just drunk af \_(") _/
---
goons losing their minds over killing 1 stuka fleet, running damage control in the thread, using a spy against said stuka fleet, and to top it off, boson was the "counter" against pandemic horde.

are you saying you can modify the client to show the people in local? did they really do that low of an effort blackout?

How do you call someone post while defecating?

Then why did you mention it?

It's a literal shitpost, but the question still stands.

&gt;CCP's nullify/stab bug

Imagine living in a wh for years and not knowing what a higgs anchor does
---
Cool :)
---
I'd like a passive drake like that. All hail the spacebrick.
---
What's the criteria for blops? Ive been in a single blops gang about 8 years ago and it flags me
---
Start*
---
I too come from the era of the spacebricks.  Drakes and Rattlers were the epitome of bricks.  Low but reliable dps, high but surmountable tank.
---
Set a stream delay of like half an hour or something.
---
I would like to make a correction it is not "PanFam" that drops dreads in delve. It is Marshy's NPSI group DPCI that has a couple panfam members that uses caps in delve. Panfam itself has not dropped dreads in delve (does not procure them nor srp them) and outside a couple gokufleets has done nothing offensively in imperium space.
---
Well, you’ve got to give them points for commitment to delusions.
---
You seem like a really fun person.
---
Either this is a total shit post or you need to retake 3rd grade math.
---
After PANIC went down I was getting void bombed into oblivion by their fleet. Even with 2 T2 Capital Cap Boosters I was having trouble cycling my hardeners.
---
Just watch / ask other streamers.  Most explorers like to hide data, most lowsec PVPers don’t care
---
$20 = 27bill o.O
---
Excuse me good sir can you be more specific about which part of the math is incorrect?
---
Do you think 82 isn't bigger than 1? Or is (255*4.5)/14 not equal to almost 82? The former I'm sure about it the latter you know is a relatively big multiplication and division so I used my phone's calculator but who knows try on yours maybe mine has a broken math module
---
have you tried not being poor already?
---
In theory, EVE has been play to win since time card code buying and selling for ISK was allowed, which has been around for years before plex.
---
Regardless, you can still farm up 80+ Titans without buying plex or waiting 1000+ days. Buying Titans is also not a guaranteed win because how you fly is not factored in your equation nor the environmental circumstances. Thus, you are flawed.
---
Vampire resistance=Nosferatu resist=small cap battery
---
Thankfully we're living in the boosh meta so they, like all other comps in the game nowadays, can just MJD and bail.
---
I assume he’s using RMT...
---
So many turbo retard troll posts today.
---
Yea still scratching my head about why that 7 is there
---
Dude, I think you need to recharge the batteries in your brain.
---
No matter how you fly 82 is bigger than 1, so Eve is pay to win and I'm not flawed. I have the math by my side, what do you have? "How you fly" is vague and differs from person to person, math is agreed upon by everyone.
---
With more time for remote-reps to land, this would be a big nerf to non alpha-strike doctrines.
---
Right after that October payout by Pearl Abyss, for your resubs based on CCP "announcements"... oh wait... they wont give a fuck after that...
---
This is a fact, no argument here, moving on..
---
Is that the one where Init pooped on hk?
---
Oof
---
I mentioned plex my good sir, rmt isn't allowed.
---
It's there for the calculations obviously
---
Someone still mines with excavators?
---
Or use a blockade runner and have a 50/50 chance of being locked and cracked open just to find out what you’re carrying
---
MASSIVE LOSSES endured by defenders BTW
---
Still 1k+ killed per month, lol
---
Yes
---
Breaking news: A 120 men Jackdaw fleet counters a Stuka fleet!
---
But 20$ is 2B isk not 27B isk if you buy from ccp I thought. Haven’t bought plex in a while
---
Ah there's your problem, you haven't bought for a while. Now with 20$ plex you can get 27B it changed
---
All of it.  $20 get you around 1.75b isk. I dont even know where you got the rest of the math equations from.
---
The next part is directly from a law you can't doubt that. Also it changed now 20$ can get you 27 billion isk when buying/selling plex
---
https://youtu.be/X09oxyIeGuY
---
It is much tougher to use without local that's true.
---
We could add a text field for manual name entry.
---
The main feature PySpy relies on is local so we will have to see if we can do something about that for nullsec.
---
TC - you did incredible work with that Vaga &lt;3
---
You are a fuckin moron, go away
---
The criteria is that you have been active in the last week and have at least one kill with blops ever.
---
We could think about changing that to blops kills last week but that would require quite a bit of backend work.
---
Wait I think he's angry, I might need some help here making it up to him, guys hop in
---
Depends how safe you want to be: 
---
Fully safety:
---
hide the models the ship
---
the overview and 
---
the system name as well as any chat channels.
---
Along with the capacitor and modules.
---
This is close to streaming a black screen tbh. 
---
Reasonably safe: 
---
Hide the overview and like your location as well as local chat. 
---
You can gank me but you have to put in work: 
---
Hide local and the system name. 
---
I don't care please shoot me: 
---
Nothing.
---
It lends itself to DPM rather than alpha, I will grant you that.
---
People say things like risk adverse... I don’t think they know what that word means.
---
I can't even fly a blops bs. I think it's counting bomber kills
---
If you think about it's scale, pacing and depth I feel something like ARMA would jive well with EVE. I also think theres a decent crossover in the two player bases. I always thought something where eve players would fund and supply ground wars to take over other players PI or something would be cool.
---
Breaking news: jackdaws did jack shit since one of the 2 fleets was bosoned and the other one was smartbombed.
---
I'll take that as a compliment thank you good sir
---
check the br.  they died to doomsdays, not jackdaws
---
I used a ~200m praxis. Took a little longer, but it also takes far less time to pay off when you invariably lose it.
---
If you have unlimited spawns, a faster-clearing ship will of course be better - you can clear more sites in the same time. Or if you have very limited time to play. But if you're only doing 1-2 combat sites a day, an extra ~20 minutes to clear may well be worth it.
---
At the same time, because it’s a sand box, holing up in null and amassing wealth is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, WITHOUT, the developer actively working against it.  And someone’s ability to do so in no way affects others ability to do the same thing.  Stop asking for an easy button.
---
As the only person who understood my math, I'm very thankful good sir
---
I know that good sir thanks for the link it's good to revise stuff
---
All I’m asking for is an actual development strategy, and a true expansion to the game, much like worm holes. CCP has been in balance mode for so long, they have forgotten how to expand.
---
What does this agreement entail?  You pay a stipend, or defense falls flat?
---
Fc where do I fit ammo to my drones?
---
seems like you're casually ignoring the fact he's retarded
---
Straight in the cargo
---
The time of spectre not participating in structure bashes/ taking sides in conflicts has long gone.  
---
These days it is hard to find the consistent content that npsi thrives on, so i can't really blame current SF leadership too much for that.
---
majority of eve players are male.... it is still somewhat odd
---
Yes, make sure you don't interact with your audience.
---
I heard it's good for the viewcount.
---
It's goon and horde comms at once
---
It's really sad how this is by far the most appropriate response.
---
there was a period of time where tickets were unread for nearly 4 months for non-billing shit
---
depends on the time of year
---
Loosing their mind is a bit of a stretch mate. And having a spy in horde is like the basic of nullsec lol even the beans joke about it all the time. You just make yourself seem really salty
---
What do you mean? The eviction protection I pay a set fee, if anyone comes into my hole I just let my rental officer know and he either scans a route in or failing that rage rolls (which is easier as there aren't many 6s) for a route. HK come and kill any attackers, they leave when the system is safe. They give me a discount on it now that I've been with them for so long. If you don't pay it, you're responsible for defending the hole, if it's lost you lose your deposit and may incur additional charges.
---
Hi. Horde FC here. 
---
There indeed was no boson spoolup effect. Had it been there, I would have booshed like any sane person would. Weird bug as it seemed to effect only half my fleet. 
---
Anyway see you next time o7
---
just go to quiet channel
---
55 defenders minus about 15 alts, we had max 30dps ships on field where the enemies had a fleet of 50 kiki's and some other random ships (100+ pilots total).
---
Seems like a pretty airtight situation, though impossible to enforce.  Though, you just stop paying entirely I guess if they reneged on their side of the deal.
---
Not really relevant to my point.
---
Thats a feature that is in the works to some extent
---
Someone explain how 20$ is 27bill...really curious.
---
Battle report is almost impossible due to the many different corporations involved.
---
It says right there in the post, 20$ = 27bil. You're welcome!
---
It's just as much in their interest to come and save me, they own the fort and other structures... If I don't pay I lose out on my isk making, so it's not worth it. Added bonus that HK don't attack their renters, so it's pretty safe.
---
Is there a way to steer your ship by keyboard and I had a thrust master can I set up for this game
---
Fair enough, though I'm still chuckling at the term "rage rolling".  All I can think of is a parking lot of megas and a dude yelling "GET IN THERE!" over and over.
---
I'm really confused. With 20$ you can buy 500 plex (source:  [https://secure.eveonline.com/PLEX/](https://secure.eveonline.com/PLEX/)  )
---
By looking the value of one plex it is \~3,45m atm. ( source:  [https://evemarketer.com/types/44992/sell](https://evemarketer.com/types/44992/sell) )

According to my calculations 500\*3,45m = \~1,72b. I'm not sure what are you smoking/injecting but must be good stuff.
---
It's to prevent ganks and stream sniping.
---
Might be the case in that particular instance. The point of the OP is that Stukas do have counters. Which is a trivial statement. Any subcap response fleet of that size (supported by a good number of booshers) can deal with Stukas. What makes these bomber fleets so strong atm is that most entities apart from Goons, Test or PH usually don't have the bodies available to flashform a respective subcap fleet thus try to even out that disadvantage by bringing in bigger ships. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.
---
Undock and get ~10 mil ISK and ~12k LP in 1.5 to 5 minutes per mission (plus travel time). It's not bad if you have massed L4 agents in a given area. 
---
A basic alt makes it run slightly faster for some burners.
---
I just quote "the players arent there".
---
Yes it s just that. No number , no content. Player ARE content in this game. For everybody.
---
We must all thx CCP to make it close faster.
---
The blops statistic is based around how many blops you have killed
---
Well corporations can set a time when their structures can be destroyed. Its not an "overnight" type of thing to happen. 
---
Best way to not get rekt is to not step on wrong peoples toes.
---
You can play with your corpmates as long as you wish. I.e. one actually cannot destroy your corp as long as you enjoy the game.
---
Ships and ingame assets are ammunition, not investment.
---
I just double checked and its actually blops bs killed and not kills with blops bs.
---
It's a warning to you being unable to figure out what bombers are, or to realize that heavy missiles suck and gilas exist :)
---
I'm pretty sure this is stuka online. Ccp agrees with me. Adapt or die
---
This isn't a shitpost. It's just a shit post.
---
Oh Im not saying Bombers are bad. Personally the first thing i trained into was a bomber when I just turned omega recently, they are awesome little ships. 
---
Its just i went to roam null with my solo bomber and found that i couldnt take any fights at all due to how squishy my nemesis is and that made hunting in null super boring cause i couldnt find any content that i could take on...
---
I would probably recommend an astero for hunting smaller ships that are commonly found in high populated exploration areas like catch, stain, providence. Then after that move to a Stratios running 2 neuts and 1 nos setup, and finally a t3 cruiser with covert ops config.
---
So... more like Planetside 1? Before the BFR's, obviously.
---
Ah ok, so if u ran a solo command dessie would u think running a burst in the high slot would work? or instead just another weapon is fine?
---
Thx FC
---
thats the idea but is it really that practical?
---
Pretty much the same here as well https://evepraisal.com/a/nk3m5
---
Imagine complaining about increased sp gains because it doesn't benefit you as much as it benefitted someone else. Just take the free shit and do what you want with it jesus christ...
---
Ahh a space I get it, because eve is in space
---
Quick everyone is requesting!
---
And the PVE side is analogue to that:
---
Rorq mining/ super ratting vs. throw away and/or semi PVP fit T1 mining barges/ T1 BC and BS. Anything in between is just not viable anymore.
---
Do GMs have opop ships with super stats? 
---
I remember seeing Falcon's Erebus on zkill that got ganked by like 50 titans or something stupid like that to kill it...
---
Oh man I know exactly where you’re coming from. I played Ark hardcore for 2 years and I promise its nothing like Ark. It takes at least a week to uproot structures you have placed with multiple timers that you can plan for to defend during. You dont have to worry about waking up and having your whole base wiped overnight. You can get your ass kicked and be removed from your space but you will have time to plan and mount a defense.
---
lul next time let them tackle you
---
Not sure if they have new ones but they used to fly the Polaris ships with insane structure stats.  Google them.

---
All of wspace was rolling to get in and I wanted a fair fight if they got in! /s
---
I mean, most people I know had 2 or 3 subbed accounts. As did I. Because I don't use my capitals anymore I just have 1 subbed now.
---
"Invest 20x the amount of ISK or effort as your enemy" isn't really a valid counter. Or, well, shouldn't be considered one.
---
Depends on the kind of space you live in, what's your operating model, what's your staging (NPC/Citadels). And so. 
---
If you stage from NPC structure, you are pretty much impossible to evict. Sure you can be camped, but I'm fairly sure people camping will get bored much faster than you do. 
---
For most of space, high, low and null there's thing called assets safety. It's mechanic that moves your assets from destroyed or unanchored player operated citadels to NPC ones. Your stuff will be frozen for some time, and you'll have to pay a fee to get it back, but it's not that big of a deal.
---
Assets safety isn't a thing in wormholes, so a corp can be evicted from it, and you would have to evacuate your stuff from there, or you lose it and there's a chance that attacker would get it when structure dies.
---
You need to understand that in Eve corps aren't killed, but they can die due to other reason. Dramas, AFK leadership, people simply stoping loging in. There are plenty of things than can kill a corp, but now, most things are rather easily replaceable, if you have money for it.
---
Think of this this way. Corp can have both material assets like structures and ships, and human assets, it's members. Well organized entity will survive losing it's hard assets, and after some time will go back to the game, possible in differ area of the the game. However loosing it's members, especially in big numbers is something that can effectively "kill" the corp.
---
I just hit a bil of isk and that dude it throwing around 7. Nuts, I need to buy more plex
---
It is impossible to "Destroy" a corp, but you can evict them from space. Its happened to even the most powerful groups. They usually relocate and come back stronger. 
---
If you want to operate out of an area that cannot be taken away, check out NPC Null - its space between Sov space (player owned) and low sec. It has NPC owned stations meaning anyone can dock and you can't really be evicted.
---
&gt; casually ignoring the fact he's retarded
---
happens
---
The only thing that can destroy a corp is poor management. Even if everything is taken away and people have had their heads crushed in if the people in charge keep logging in and having fun nothing can kill an eve corp. it takes a lot of energy to do that though and owning sov is a shitfest depending on how many active people you have to late night drink with. Try it out man .
---
bombers definitely can be countered, problem is that usually its a pain in the ass to counter 100+ man frigate based doctrines that can skip around the map with ease.
---
Shit happens when it's cut short by TAPI steamrolling ^totally not feeding Geminate.
---
You can still do it make sure you got the skills tho.

---
All marauders deserve is a jumpdrive like the blops but only for regular cynos. Other than that they are in a pretty good place rn for pve
---
We've never been against structures/timers. Our rule for years has been that it's fine so long as it's guaranteed content, and never allowed when it's purely for personal gains.
---
We've been doing this for at least 5+ years, but because he's the one being shot, he believes we're allied with x group now :)

Lawl grow up you nerd

Top line-do not read will hurt head

So in this scenario, if you can purchase your way into a Titan, does that mean you will win regardless? This is certainly the case in many other games. Feeding new players, as an example, with Titans won't make it so they'll win every single encounter they'll ever face.
---
Since I've been playing a game called War Thunder for ages (WWII-based(ish) game where you pilot aircraft / tanks) you progress down a tech tree, XP is gained per match towards your selected vehicle. Once you unlock and purchase a new vehicle you also have to play with that specific vehicle to gain a secondary type of XP, which goes towards the vehicle only. Allowing you to straight up upgrade it in many ways. Since the game is free to play at it's core you can also purchase a handful of premium vehicles. Either 'captured' variants fomr another country's arsenal or some prototype vehicle. Which also comes with all their upgrades. You can get a single vehicle and skip some of the grind I suppose, without going deeper. This might sound OP and totally pay to win, but getting to the bottom of that tech tree isn't the endgame either. In addition to you have no idea how to fly your new, let's say, aircraft versus who you face. It's not 50 bucks for a win.
---
you..
---
All these flavors and you chose salt
---
Smooth brains are everywhere. Some don't even know their brains are smooth
---
$20 is approx 1.7b or whatever the currenty price of PLEX is in-game.
---
Care to explain how your calculations are the correct ones, as you put it? Seeing as there's a set price on PLEX by the developer themselves?
---
my friend was about to rent   c6 hole  from HK but HK guys were changing rules during game,he backed off in last moment before he sent the isk...he was about to lose 15b  then  HK  guys  tried to use  non-HK alts for begging him to do this..he  blocked 15  random guys that tried this  shit...
---
Notice how he didnt say assault frigate.
---
Haha I'm glad.
---
you can still do it but  its obsolete...no bonus  in research/manufacturing... pos is good these days only for staging.. you plop pos then citadel,then raze pos.
---
Yea. If they were half as honourable as you guys, it would have been 2500 at least.
---
Eve 2019. Form for 45 minutes, jump 20 gates, sov BS, maybe shoot armor timer or some timer, maybe a fight or maybe not then jump 20 gates back waiting on aligns every warp, dock then check reddit hoping ccp hasn’t jacked things up worse.
---
Missed opportunity there.
---
My buddies run a successful screen printing business. You probably have someone local you could support as well.
---
IDK if there is a clear winner. Missiles are ez mode, because they pretty much hit no matter what. The generic min/max PVE boat is a missile or drone boat. Lasers have best tracking, blasters have best DPS, artillery best 1-shot damage, rails best range.
---
There's a lot to be said for blasters for novice PVP.
---
I give you the mighty DerpTron... x 10
---
I personally don't fly command dessies, but I know a couple of guys that do. If used correctly they can be very effective against solo and small gangs.
---
..still lost the fort. Bring more than 1 web, or a doctrine that can actually apply damage :)
---
You realize the NPSI fleet came long after we did right? So your whole comment makes 0 sense.
---
I think you've got a lot of growing up to do if you genuinely believe this. *shrugs*
---
&gt;doctrines that can skip around the map with ease.
---
Dont the defenders have the same ability around their territory?
---
Literally every t1 frigate...
---
So which one would be the best pick, out of the three? Like, if I would start playing now, from which type would i benefit the most in long run in terms of ship pool, usability etc (I omit the drones cuz they're pretty much a must on all of them).
---
wow nice cheating bro
---
You can see all the BR's of this op, in the linked debrief from the spectre fleet discord.
