If these were sold, I'd buy them even with the stupid ass shipping from the EVE store. The reason I hate the shipping on the store isn't the price, it's the fact that I'm paying like a billion dollars to ship a goddamn cup or something. If I was buying a ship model, I would be more willing to pay for the shipping. Goddamit CCP we just want to give you money for ship models. Fuck.
---
---
---
This isn't even a joke
---
The fact that you think you're self-important enough to respond to that just to say 'Yeah, but *especially* the thing that I said first' just proves the point even further.

What's your favorite ingame activity?

What’s your point?

Expensive ammo use means its cheaper to just use a dread tbqh.
---
3x Stratios or 3x Astero would be your best bet. A Naga is stupid.
---
the supers won't jump to save you unless you're on comms
---
and while Siri would be *far* more comprehensible than some of the people who yell for help in standing fleet, so far that hasn't happened
---
I would agree with this. No range rig and drawback is optimal. Either that or spool up time.
---
Curse, Huginn, blaster brutix
---
No, this is Patrick
---
Seems obvious to me. Clearly, CLEARLY, citadel upkeep is far too inexpensive.
---
Hmmmm...I'm not calling you a liar but I'm gonna need to see that....void deals 50/50 kin therm and no where close to the rate of fire on polarized weapons. Guristas are also weaker to kin than aero are to kin. Doesn't really add up...do you have a fit or video I could watch?
---
I also know that when you go through a wormhole then back through your ship gets polarized and you can’t jump through that worm hole for 3 mins
---
Yes it is please fix
---
Forsaken hubs don't have many eliminators in them. But when they do spawn you focus them first.
---
The order of events is still preserved, and things can happen more frequently than once per second, it's just that the server synchronizes your client with all the other players' clients once per second. So in your example the server would have a timestamp of both shots and would evaluate the first one successfully and the second one would fail because it's being shot from a nonexistent ship.
---
Turrets do not have to wait for ticks to activate. Source:
---
&gt; If you activate a turret module, it’ll immediately calculate the damage, and immediately apply it to the target.  It’ll send back a packet right away, telling you, “I activated this module for you.”  However, you won’t receive information about how much damage was dealt until the next tick!  And neither will the target!  Yes, this means you can be dead for up to a second (or up to 10 seconds, in the case of severe TiDi) and not know it yet!
---

---
Smartbombs I don't know though.
---
I appriciate that you're willing to atleast talk.
---
I'm not claiming to *know* if there were illicit in-game transactions. I didn't claim to know if Brisc broke the NDA.
---
I am, however, following the logic that CCP didn't hand out these bans without doing extensive research first. There's simply no way they do bans like this off vague statements from the other CSM members. CCP claims there were illicit in-game transactions. CCP claims Brisc broke the NDA.
---
 As an outsider, you must understand that understanding CCP is the most logical thing to do, right? After all, it hurts CCP to hand out bans like these, so they must've done it on a proper background.
---
--------------------
---
**Let me ask you a question, then**. Why were Brisc, you, Pando and Shines banned?
---
In a forsaken hub you load null in warp to the site, land, start burning toward nearest eliminator, pop battle cruisers, once bcs are dead change to void, melt the battleships while hornets kill frigs. Web the battleships that get out of void range.
---
From what I understand this is profitable but you might go days without finding a site suitable to run. Is this true?
---
Our enemies would like to give us bigger, better incursions so their Imperium spy/ISKmaking alts can make more ISK.
---
&gt; The Damavik does have 2 utility highs over the kiki, it just can't use both of them because the fitting is garbage.
---
Even if it could, 3 mids + 3 lows is pretty meh. Can't do any kind of decent tank unless you sacrifice all your dps (given that there are no rigs) and even then the tank isn't *that* great. I mean, I guess it can at least fit scram+web now? ...Yay?
---
As a newborn, I didn't see enough stabbers.  I feel underrepresented.
---
Given the Imperium is one of the only coalitions that know how to do incursions bringing it to Delve may not be such a bad idea
---
DarkShines is really a nice a FC to fly with.. guess he will be back
---
Blue Ice once pinged his 17 year old penis to all online with brave after he and some other fc (broodalpha maybe) helped Geemu fight test on the ge- undock, as brave had let Geemu dock there with out telling test, so they were helping non coalition blues fight coalition blues, many angry words were exchanged and then Blue decided to ping his penis to all online for Brave, despite again being 17.
---
Someday I should put together a big collection of hero stories, that coalition was such a fucking mess.
---
I finish most sites in 10m. Some in 12. But yeah
---
Some sort of advanced Triglavian incursion would be pretty cool. Sansha incursions when managed properly don't really ever pose a real threat but imagine if the rats began structure bashing or entosising if you don't reach certain objectives. Or Triglavian dreads start dropping on caps or something. You could still have CONCORD bounties and LP so there's a reward in doing it properly.
---
I imagine there'd be problems with coding more complex NPC AI but it's a fun idea to think about.
---
Its pretty sad when you are asking the game devs to pretty much just outright delete your opponents LMAO
---
Hello I would like to exchange currency for these items
---
Isn't that a dread in seige mode?
---
omg that would be so awesome
---
So your suggesting that npc should emulate what alliances do in null sec?
---
What the fuck?
---
Turned into? According to the whiners its all null has ever been, throughout the entire history of EVE.
---
Is that Perimeter?
---
No need to unplug, they would lose most of their playerbase in the process.
---
Most people don't own faction titans because of their abilities, they do because of the wank factor.
---
Now if it was really related to faction titans, my guess would be on them becoming easier to obtain, and consequently dropping in price. So anyone who'd sell one before changes are announced would profit on a large scale.
---
The only rule I know of is that it's considered impolite to drop an MTU during a fleet battle.
---
CCP should one-up them and give Triglav NPCs the ability to spam chat in triangle.
---
How awesome was Caroline's Star???
---
It was all the same, seriously fucked up dude.
---
i agree, stop playing eve, it sucks
---
Ah.  Seems legit.
---
This is intolerable!  I demand 300k free SP
---
I too want CCP to crush my enemies for me.
---
Hah! The joke is on you... We are the expert of Texas Law which is like a trump card.. defeats any other law in the world...
---
Just spend 1800 to buy direct during Fanfest. Cut out the shipping middle man.
---
CSM members can discuss things between themselves as they all signed the same NDA. He would've have to 'let slip' the fact that he told it to someone non-CSM

Loot goes to corp, corp provides Ceptors, Sabres, inhibs and a doctrine ship &amp; item pool, personal ships are sometimes reinburced aswell.
---
Are you saying they don't do that? I saw them rf'ing a citadel just last week

I mean I've scooped corpses in a carrier before, it shouldn't be too different from that. I assume Delve titans are fit for max speed in order to loot more effectively?

1.5b an hour in sites you can essentially run all day if you want is pretty Damn good. The only form of PVE that makes more money is multiboxing 10-20 rorqs, which requires autism and a supercap umbrella
---
Countered by if it's unpowered, it's still there, providing docking, storage and tether. 
---
For structures in use (and this shot is most likely from Delve) even doubling fuel cost would not impact them at all as the large population groups (mega alliances etc) have the internal economies and corps have their shit squared away just so, that it doesn't matter. The people that would get fucked over by increased running costs are the newer players in teh structure game and smaller corps doing low sec stuff or wanting to do production in HS.
---
I agree running costs are too low, even for a keepstart, sotiyo, several azbels and fortizars all powered the running cost is laughable compared to the services they provide. HOWEVER old stations/outposts provided pretty much all of these things too (except for reactions) and their limiting factor was not cost but the hard limit of 1 per system. Now limiting number of structures to a number just means the big guys spam structures till that limit is met, preventing an invader from putting up any themselves, so your in a shit spot
---
What do you mean?
---
Valid point

Then you're a moron. That's like saying "There's no difference between a slap in the face and being stabbed 87 times in the chest. They're both violence."

This is a quick PSA, as he’s been hitting up people post-kick.
---
Nocti Zedar has been blacklisted from Test, and his characters kicked. He actively engaged in an elaborate scam while in Test, going so far as to pretend he was in a motorcycle accident for isk and sympathy, then claiming that his friend was using his account to do that when it came to light. Avoid contact with him, and definitely don’t send him any isk. He is actively trying to scam you.

#### SENT BY Cornak Firefist to Test Alliance @ 2019-04-12 00:44:40 EVE Time ####
---
Well thank you, that was pretty much exactly what I was curious about. In the end how much do you feel it matters?
---
aye.  so basically 2 reps from each of the major coalitions (or maybe make it so the % of nullsec you control translates to number of members you get from a fixed number)
---
and then for small alliances, they could have an entire council of members,  who elect 2-3 members who sit with the larger alliances.
---
seriously we could go all Log Horizon on this =D
---
(Log Horizon, when they took control of the city, the council had 3 representatives that represented all the small guilds(members picked by popular vote of the small guilds),   3 representatives that represented the merchants(2 large, 1 small),  and 3 representatives that represented the PvP guilds(of various size).
---
The ones that are t2 and don't exist are the result of ships that CCP made in the past and haven't released.

The faction ones are AT ships

Cool. I am so used to seeing bad posts on r/Eve that I didn't realize that this was a circle jerk thread.
---
Carry on.
---
What is CCP's intended purpose for PLEX? If PLEX is a premium currency does CCP plan to intervene in the price of PLEX in game? Is PLEX's purpose mainly for purchasing Omega game time? If the rising price of PLEX deters players from purchasing Omega game time or from playing at all, what would you tell those players?
---
If I expected it to be the first question asked, or repeated verbatim, you would have a point. 
---
However, an experienced interviewer could find many different ways to phrase the question with an aim of getting the information, all of which would be dependent on the length and tone of the interview.
---
For example, if it's meant to be a hard-hitting in depth discussion, it would be reasonable to put it around half way through and follow it up with ample opportunity to go over various issues (capitals, projection, skill trading etc).
---
If it was more casual, it would probably be better left to the penultimate question and phrased more like:
---
"So, before we wrap up and let you tell us what you're most looking forward to, can we spend a few minutes to talk about the past? 
---
In our survey of what people wanted us to ask you, one of the most common things which came up most was EVEs existing features, and how many EVE players feel like those features are often left without iteration for long periods of time, even when it's known that they may be having negative effects.
---
For example, we know that you've only recently begun the process of changing the in-game war declarations system, something that most players would agree is long overdue.
---
In light of that, can you take a few minutes to tell us what the more unique challenges are when it comes to changing and iterating upon existing features vs developing new ones, and how you intend to respond to your players increasingly vocal calls for more developer emphasis being placed on improving and polishing what you have previously released?"
---
Thanks for the explanation!  Can I send you an in-game chat sometime?  Is your in-game name the same as the reddit "aimsucks"?  mine is Drynic Keller
---
We get it, you kiss girls. Smh

I feel it matters very little since the value of the salvage is merely a fraction of the other rewards for killing the rats. However, Gallente ice is also the most valuable ice, so there's that.

Nice video! Dual web arty thrasher is insane against frigs that operate in scram range. It is essentially unfightable in scram range in a frigate unless you’re in a double mse worm. Everything else dies.

&lt;3
---
And the limit on POSes absolutely was abused.
---
Technically we could, but the amount of effort to destroy them would be many, many times higher than the effort to deploy them.
---
Which is the basic issue with small citadels.
---
Were we talking about slapping people in this context? I was assuming corruption, since that is what we were (or at least I thought we were) referring to. Why exactly are you so hostile?
---
Got it, thanks, that's awesome, sounds like you had an experience, go out and have more (-:

If the rigs only shortened the max damage ramp up time they would be good. Its  Minus could be range.

The changes made Fountain rich in moon goo. It was basically the Dev's spinning a wheel and going "Fountain is going to have a lot of valuable moons". Which sparked the war.  
---
Either you weren't around back then, or you're willingly a retard. Or both.
---
Make sure you have her do the career missions so she can get a feel of the different kinds of things to do in Eve.  My ex dragged me across space and dropped me in an ore belt and said go.  And then he stopping playing 2 weeks later and left with a ok you’re CEO of the corp now with a bunch of very upset people.  I think the challenge of holding the group together is what made me stay and hit the learning curve with a battering ram. 
---
Point being help her some.  Help her learn what different things Eve offers and then step back.  If you hold her hand in game too much she might not stick with it.  Good luck
---
Trig dread pls

What's the armor save for a Titan?
---
How is forcing the same number of players in to a smaller area of nullsec asking the game devs to delete your opponents? I **WANT** more opponents - I want more conflict - and I want it in closer proximity.
---
the 2 timers is very good, i don't want to lose a structure the very day it gets reinforced.
---
remove asset safety and tethering and the 2 timers are suddenly not so important anymore.
---
RR Domis work as well if you don't want to run too blingy. We used to run some lower level WH fleets in t3ds and t1 logi. you can burn through em decently quick without my isk on the table until you get the hang of it.

Dont Fly What You Cant Afford to Lose.

dont fly what you're not willing to lose

Learned that the hard way in space citizen.
---
dont fly a ship that worths more than 40% of your total net worth
---
Don't bump the bridging Titan.

ships are just ammunition, don't worry too much about losing them

If you can't afford to replace it easily don't fly it.
---
Aside from shuttling from place to place, stay out of low sec until you're ready(you'll know when).

Don't buy anything advertised in Jita local.

If a deal sounds too good to be true it probably is.

To push the point further I was friends with this guy from my early teens to my mid twenties. The first time he went to gaol I didn't know why he had been locked up as I was living in another state at the time.
---
I had heard he was in gaol but had no idea why and was told a story that he had embezzled the company he worked for. Shortly afterwards I went to my sister's wedding and his younger brother was there.
---
As I didn't know the story I said hello to Paul and asked him how Glenn was and told him to tell Glenn I said hello. I knew I had done something very wrong when everyone at that table looked at me like I was the worst human being alive.
---
My sister has barely spoken to me since that day but she's a bit of a bitch anyway.

---
And that's not deleting people's space, is it? The players decided to wage that war. TEST decided to walk away from their relationship with the CFC. The Fountain War didn't just happen because CCP put moons there, it happened because of a sequence of events that were mostly player controlled.
---
Always fit a cyno.
---
Ignore the people who say "never trust anyone in Eve".  Trust is alive and well in Eve, and is one of the most valuable things you can have in the game.  If you never trust anyone even a little bit, you'll be missing out on a lot of fun.  Just never put so much trust in someone that if they violate it you can't afford the consequences.  Manage your risk.  Never make it so profitable to screw you over that the people you trust are tempted to do it.
---
&gt; Instead of delaying local, what if the Triglavians instead 'jam' local and translate it all into their trialphabet?
---
The whole point of the 20 second delay is to make it easier for wormholers to hunt.  Everything else is just window dressing.
---
Now I definitely have to visit Kamela. I don't think you realize how I roll these days but I'll be glad to demonstrate.
---
There is not too much space. This narrative is just true if you're the member of a big powerblock that holds too many regions for renter space denying smaller entities to actually live there. There are a lot of groups that would love to live in Null but can't, because cap superiority of the mass alliances .
---
Maybe release control over renter regions for real first and if Null doesnt get populated then you can make the argument for real.
---
We don't have to much space, the map is fine, YOU are the problem.
---
#5 is a great question. The critical thinking that can be required in EVE is something I would have loved back in the day in school.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bbwxnb/sad_to_say_goodbye/ekofkr7/
---
Dear CCP, please change to only 1 citadel per system(do constellation to avoid abuse), per alliance, can have a reinforce timer. The other structures have no damage cap and are vulnerable 24/7.
---
This means there will only be 4 relevant alliances or coalitions max at some point because anybody else under 10k members has no chance anymore. Players would never let control of territory go to benefit enemies which meand you just remove every single possibility for smaller and medium sized alliances to play the game basically unless they go npc null
---
We used to lose everything when a POS went boom and somehow most of us managed to get by. Don't put more in your station than you can afford to lose.

5a) group texter participant who “liked” or “lol’d” at every text message, causing a resend of the entire message text to everyone else in the group telling them that he/she “liked” or “lol’d” at the message.
---
It can be significant for newer players. Compared to VNI ratting following a super or a couple carriers around with MTUs in a destroyer is probably better isk when you get the hang of it. People just don’t like doing it because it takes more work.
---
Unless you cant afford to buy at least 10 more to replace it.
---
Triglavians upset with the resource draining out of delve?
---
I mean, it would make sense that they want to destroy the largest entity with the most firepower as a show of power v0v
---
I mean just make them incursions. The trigs already have the lore built in for how they'd just randomly pop out into any system (abyssal space etc). They'd just be super aggressive incursions on steroids.  Hell, make it super rewarding to clear them, but take like supercapital use to even have a chance to get more supers out in null in more vulnerable states.
---
Correct me if im wrong but CCP DID try something similar 2 years back with the whole Amarr navy VS Drifters.
---
Problem was that it lagged all systems ingame (tidi everywhere) because of how complex it was for the server to handle. And how fast they spread, eventually they had to control the spread rate on their end just to try and eleiviate some of the stress on the server. Then they removed it (eventually the AI got repurposed to diamond rats)
---
Is part of the Goon application process demonstrating the ability to be an insufferable prick?

Please remind me why the goons lost World War Bee and now live in the south. I can assure you a "titan battle" doesn't have to occur to win a war, even if the opposing side (goons) had more titans.

2. Trust No One.

Yes, I probably would have said something similar, but I noticed that OP specified 'empire'.

If goons n' pets wanted to take over the area in botland, they would have already tried. Right now it's just content, a feel good drug to keep the little bees in line. 
---
For how long this has supposedly been going on, it really seems like they just don't want the area. Otherwise, it would be that even with help, goons can't take the area. And that's not positive on the propaganda wagon.

Remember when the first revenant landed on grid and everyone acted as a single fleet to bring it down?

Remember how that chat channel was full of people on the inbuilt voice chat,and someone rickrolled them?

That was me.

Don't see much smugposting from goons in delve when we kill fleets with caps

I suppose your definition of moral integrity changes when you get bought by one of the greediest mmo studios out there.
---
Ive seen the Kikimora show up alot recently as a top killer on zkill, i havent done much solo/small gang pvp over the last year or so as ive been on evecation, whats the capabilities of this thing and its main weaknesses? (is it op? its kill metric would seem to imply it)
---
Would love to have that in the game.
---
People are gonna say don’t fly what you can’t lose. But it’s really not as important as people would like.
---
My top 5 words of advice would be.
---
1) Don’t let KB statistics get in the way of you having fun. People are gonna say don’t fly what you can’t afford to lose here often. I fly ridiculous shit on the daily. I AFK Paladins on wormholes. It’s good for eve and at the end of the day isk is irrelevant. Flying with people you trust to go out and pew alongside you is a hell of a lot more important than anything you manage to get your hands on. 
---
2) Always be prepared. - you will be outnumbered in eve. It is the way of life. Don’t let it get to you. Don’t be in the financial red line. Things can wait to be bought and sold. These ships we have can be replaced. But it would behoove you to know what ships you should be spending your isk on and how to fly them. For the love of god. Buy them many of them, but do not get attached.
---
They’re just tools.
---
Just watch these. Great ships to learn on.
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8HD7_-Ut78RWBa0SRnj9JpXUzZhubC7Z
---
3) You can literally do anything you want. Don’t let people dictate the game.  But don’t be mad when you don’t participate if the content isn’t to your liking. Be the thing that gets the content you want. If you can do this. People will buy you ships. Real talk.
---
4) Everyonems bad at PVP. Don’t let being bad deter you from a fight dying is a purifying experience.
---
5) People who say don’t talk in local are dickwads. Talk to as many people as you can. We’re all lonely neckbeards escaping reality.
---
Hey I got a girls number at the dmv today. Am I cool too?
---
my rule of thumb is to never trust someone with more than the amount that if they were to run off with it, you'd be more upset with losing them as a friend than with the amount they stole. So for example, dude i've been playing with for years? i'll trust him with just about everything but my account details. But some dude i've only known for a few months i won't loan him more than i'd be happy to welp in an evening.
---
so basically don't fly what you can't afford to lose
---
Do it in high sec and have large swaths become nullsec. 😄
---
yeah that's what I'm saying...doesn't really disprove Elowenn's tinfoil theory. Just a different version. He fucks up ---&gt; Goon CSM members snitch (or bravely come forward depending on how you want to spin it) in an attempt to keep Init from getting even cozier with Snuff and more independent of Mittens and Co.
---
My corp gets 100% of all PVP loot.
---
We offer everything else at 0% tax though. So it ends up paying for Sabres, Scanning awards of up to 2BIL, rolling carriers, sabres, enyos, sabres, All logistics frigs and cruisers, heretics, more sabres, and Jeff, the big gay devoter.
---
"Has gf" werid flex but okay
---
Lol if the scout isn’t not normally getting it,  Sounds like Posypy is just lying to itself like every other C4 wormhole corp. 😂
---
I think it's more think of your ship and fit like your weapon and ammo - not a precious possession. You will lose it at some point but you can easily get another.
---
But I agree - don't obsess over your killboard, fights will often be unfair, and you can do anything you want. Even if you prefer to do PvE stuff - do what you want to do.
---
My only other thing would be to find a group of people you like playing with no matter who they are.
---
&gt; no botters in the corp im a member of and if one of use is found out that person gets the boot.
---
Then you are definitely not the norm and I suggest your corporation look to join a real alliance rather than a renter one at some point.
---
vOv idk how much more oh want dude. How many trillions have been lost between Winter Co. and Legacy in the last few weeks?
---
Who makes these? I would like to talk to them about possibly getting an AT ship made for my office desk at work.
---
Ask him if he’s gay!?
---
You are consenting to PvP when you undock. Yes, even in high sec. Someone might decide to kill you at any time, just for fun.
---
Oh no...welcome to the Hotel Eve...you can check out but you never really leave. Unless you break the CCP rules.
---
Yeah but I know you fucks would manage a way to send her a dickpic so. 🤷‍♂️
---
Those jita isk-doubling services are a good way to get ahead fast in the game. Also, jita contracts can be a great deal on ships. Buy fast and don’t bother double-counting the zeros.
---
If you don't collect corpses, people will look at you funny.
---
Not for sale..... from a chinese design studio.........
---
Ssuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeee
---
ccp doesnt havent an active legal department. sell them and be rich
---
Just like trying to get back together with a girl you never dated.
---
These days probably not like she hasn’t gotten one already.
---
&gt;Also add a 20 second delay to local, just in case this gets any traction.
---
just remove local
---
there is no reason for you to know who is in your space, and this being in the game is a huge negative to all gameplay other than afk pve
---
The best ship is friendship.
---
&gt; Unless you break the CCP rules.
---
That's pretty handy.
---
Lovely
---
In my Corp, i get it all. Of course im the only person in corp but still counts riight?
---
oh my......... #AMT
---
Is it more questionable that you would know the original meme...?
---
Dont join any bouns rooms!!!
---
Not enough.
---
6+ months on and 0 progress. F
---
I really don't know about rigs being needed. I do happen to fly them fairly regular. I'd rather see tracking comps/enhancers apply for them first. That may be a good in between.
---
I thought we all agreed to be gay together?
---
You can always bring a Drake.
---
Never use local chat in wormhole systems, found that out the hard way.
---
Always trust ISK doublers.
---
I love orthrus but that shit is way too fast and expensive for inexperienced bros.
---
In my Corp anything you killed on your own was yours. If it was a gang op it went by each individual fc, usually it went to anyone who lost a ship. Then split evenly.
---
Situational. The less lucrative you are of a target, the safer it is for you to use autopilot, especially if you're primarily autopiloting through highsec in a corvette/frigate/shuttle.
---
Tbh im fucking rolling right now. I Really didn't put you to be this stupid nocti. good riddance i guess.
---
Most importantly, don't have corpses in your ship's cargohold if there are Autothysian Lancers by a stargate. They will shoot you down if you do.
---
What happens if I do
---
Odds are, someone’s going to blow your ship to pieces. Luckily, the guy who blew me up had the kindness to reimburse me for damages.
---
The real question here. Angel lives matter.
---
I can't replace most of the shit I fly. If I lose it, oh well!
---
Honestly null NEEDS to be a clusterfuck.
---
One of the biggest problems of EVE right now is content stagnation, pure and simple. High sec is boring, but that’s by design. High sec should have just enough content to whet people’s appetites. 
---
Then the lower the security, the crazier it gets. Rats competing for resources, large scale fights between humans and npc alliances.
---
It’s clear that the big mega alliances don’t really want to shake things up. In a way I can’t blame them - they have a good thing going. But, this screws over everyone else. The only way things will be shaken up is if there is content FORCING it.
---
Don’t be TOO hamfisted because we don’t want everyone to up and leave, but I feel like if the rats were good enough, it would be exciting for everyone involved. We could finally have big fleet fights that don’t rely on someone not paying their rent or shit talking the wrong rich guy.
---
Ships would blow up, stimulating the economy. Resources would become valuable again. The excitement of fleets would make more people actually log on. People might start subscribing again, maybe even buying PLEX. If more people buy and sell PLEX, prices can go down.
---
The reality is the game isn’t going to fix itself by maintaining the status quo forever. Things need to be shaken up, or people are just going to give up.
---
No one shows up in wormhole local chat unless you say something and if you do you show up for 15 minutes.
---
In wormhole space you only show up in local if you talk. If you don't talk folks probably don't know you are in system, especially if you are cloaked.
---
My titan and Super are sad now.
---
Simple. Their first target is the ones with the most influence and most numbers. Like it or not, that’s goons and friends.
---
Flair checks out
---
Lol I lost 300m in ships/modules/implants just yesterday and replaced it without dropping under 2b isk.
---
 When they add triglavian wrecks to be salvaged that's when

Just dont go and give her a probe.

It's more cost effective to buy a 3D printer and make your own

---
Pretty much spent all my formative teen years on eve.
---
stick around, you seem like the Eve-type. it's fun.
---
What if the devs made one region of nullsec have super good loot randomly each month. Sort of like a mini fountain war
---
you rent from shitlers
---
As a software developer, this is the kind of use-case that I dread, and I hope that the test-engineers would think of long before anything went to production.
---
Buy a mining permit
---
 Assault subsystem legion with those drone+missile dmg mod amplifiers was one thing I'd use
---
Nuke highsec, job done.
---
My flair, basically.
---
Implying I have a job🎊🍾🍾
---
Don't log in.
---
I’ll throw my backing in as well.
---
 Corp gets the loot and provides some ship types fully fit like logies interdictors recons ceptors scanning ships as well as ammo drones paste boosters. If someone dies in his own ship or multiple people die loot goes to them
---
I would be the same way, just my titan and Super would be a bit of a bummer.
---
It’s like 300mil??
---
Ah.  Just make sure that it wasn't the DMV help line, and you're good!
---
You can do C3 sites with a scythe, naga, and something to handle frigates/web and/or tp cruisers for the naga. Not the worst pvp trio either (but not the best either)

---
Don't get all riled up about losing your favorite ship that costs more than you can afford. Of course, don't fly willie nillie what you can't afford to lose, but doesn't mean don't fly it. I flew my 500 mil gila into a gang and died (500 mil is alot for my character, unlike some others). That managed to bait them into getting blown up by my corpmates. We lost like 600 mil total, they lost something like 1.2 bil. Was worth it in my book

Friendship as in companionship or is there an actual spaceship called friendship
---
Good because our corp was in WIDOT when that happened lol.
---
OP, here is a beautiful example of how eve’s history is freaky and complicated. 99% of jokes will go over your head and this sub is no exception.
---
Move to Delve
---
So uh, I've just downloaded the steam starter pack but I keep getting the "we are currently in the process of creating your EVE account" when I try to login through steam. I've have literally 0 game time, and their page about setting an account name for accounts created through steam is simply impossible to perform.  
---
Another probably pretty stupid question, is Omega time counted from the moment I login or from the moment I redeem the bundle? Thanks.
---
Is it better than a machariel?
---
I spent my first 250 million on a gila.
---
I lost that gila 20 minutes later to rats. Now i only fly herons.
---
Not hard at all, fit a tractor beam and scoop everything in range, with a 100k m3 fleet hanger, plenty of space for loot
---
You guys are NC. Every time you pay NC. Get stonger. goons can harass you guys because none of you will fight back.
---
trust no one , except those you can trust
---
Star Citizen?
---
Yeah that
---
friendship as in make friends
---
&gt;...and is one of the most valuable things you can have in the game.
---
Trust, imo, is the single most valuable commodity in EVE.
---
And why do you feel the need to report this here instead of placing a ticket?
---
Sadly this is a shit place 99.9% of the time.  Good luck to you all though and hope you enjoy Eve.
---
Don't warp the fleet to zero on the gate with a bomber fleet in system.
---
And cowert cloak capable
---
Remove asset safety, says the wormholer which that wouldn't an effect on. XD. I'm with you though. That, and remove all reinforcement if its in low power. THAT would clean up the spam at least.
---
Or, better yet, removed the reinforcement after its been low power for x amount of days. Say, 30 for example. Thats pretty ample time i would assume. It might create some interesting content if people got war dec'd and then tried to reduel their cits to not loose a timer.
---
Dang, you are right.
---
It's not dig down in Minecraft, its don't be stupid when you do.
---
E.g be able to see where you're going
---
Aaaarrgg might want to have a word with you on that one.
---
Absolutely listen to them.
---
If they're gonna say that, it's probably because they've betrayed someone or have been betrayed. 
---
Learn from their actions. In EvE, knowledge is power.
---
If I can replace it and have an extra, I really dont care about losing one.

Don't, under any circumstances, attempt to make isk by mining in highsec... No good can come of this...

High security space, it's where you start off in Eve.

This site will show you who lives where in the great universe of Eve. The black bit in the middle is 'Empire Space' controlled by the NPC factions. It's where you run missions and most people won't try to shoot you... It's a silly place

If you mine without a permit don't be surprised when the player police blow up and confiscate your equipment.

dont join HS corps or c4 corps

This is one of the reasons I quit EVE back in 200X.  Travelling 5 systems with autopilot took half an hour.

Because it is known that CCP doesn't give a shit about support tickets unless they receive additional traction on Reddit.

You pay your rent to a certain group. That certain group makes a significant amount of their money from rent. Goons don't like that group. So they attack their income source.

Do NOt start as a miner, as appealing as it may sound to you.

CooL Video \~ Shit alliance \~ Thanks for sharing \~

&gt;EDIT: The overall condescending responses and negative comments are a pretty good indicator of why Eve has new player retention problems. Basically, I was happy that I brought a new player to the game and everybody is shitting on it. Good job /r/Eve
---
you're getting negative responses because this isn't interesting. it's great that you got a potential new player into the game, but there's nothing particularly notable about anything that she's done so far in-game. this post just makes me think you're trying to get her handouts/free ISK, and also trying to bait negative responses by repeatedly emphasizing that she's a female. this isn't a place to post mundane progress updates, try the forums or twitter or something
---
How do they plan to fix nullsec sovereignty warfare, mixed with overpowered citadel mechanics that is making the game stagnate recently?
---
Players no longer bother to grind through hostile infrastructure, unless the other side failscades.
---
Has he tried to attend a few regular sov entossising fleets?
---
Can we not make Triglavians another regular race please, or fix underused, existing ships, by adding even more ships?
---
Read my first response. No hand outs needed. Just thought people would find it interesting, all this subreddit does is complain instead. I'm glad I wasn't stupid enough to show her this subreddit.
---
Generally, why would you? 
---
If you skill up while not putting any time in, that is infinite progression per time spent for you - all you need is to log on when your skill queue is about to run out to ensure continued progress, while not risking to lose anything. 
---
Winning eve is easy!
---
Cowanunga dude
---
Imagine being blue to furries :dagger:
---
Why was he warping in a capsule to the wh anyway? sounded like he wanted the fast trip to k-space ...
---
In lowsec there’s little to no regular corp income, so fleet/gatecamp loot usually goes to corp for fuel, free ships and stuff. Haven’t heard any complains about this.
---
Triglavians "resistance is futile!" 
---
I can get behind that!
---
Well I would implement a value for "Security Status" first. Ohh thanks random 0.0 alliance for killing all the rats and mining and building infrastructure. CONCORD DECLARES THIS SYSTEM AS LOWSEC. On the other hand you would have all the NPC fighting off Concord and the Empires. So as a alliance you should choose whise. And then add in the trigs etc to randomize the whole thing so that nobody can min max their position because if the wrong wormhole spawns you suddendly have the status quo messed up because that trig blew up one rat too much to hold your current status.
---
What's to imagine?
---
how does a good bait post attract attention mostly from the goon side hehe

So do industry skills that are available to an alpha. Have lots of industry slots running as often as possible with mats provuded by your main

SHARING AN ALLIANCE WITH DEGENERATES
---
Farewell dude
---
My 2 cents would be:
---
Expect to die. If you get blown up, understand its all a part of this.
---
Dont be afraid to join big corps. 
---
Tutorials have gotten better, they might actually be worth doing.
---
But the main thing is, dont get spooked by the complexity and feel of the game. Give it a bit of time (movement, structures etc). Theres a lot to learn
---
Bcs the developers don't really play the game or have taken advise from retards, playing the game.
---
Well, they can have their shitty astra for whatever reason they might, but those have to be able to die very easily. Forts even should die easily.
---
You certainly are.  More people know you than know you as a renter.  And it's not F1 monkeying, so much as maybe being present when the big events in the galaxy that make the news take place.

This extends to pods as well. Death is a means of transportation

And what was preventing me from doing that before the week of omega?
---
Cool thanks.
---
I will now give you some eve helps.
---
If you ever see anyone saying 'Killboards don't matter' or 'Killboards ruin pvp' -
---
This means that they are really crappy at pvp and therefore have a terrible killboard.
---
Killboards are your public score in eve and are how other players generally judge your abilities.
---
Private things that no one can check freely like wallet balances, skills trained can be lied about and mean nothing.
---
I think a good place to start would be Delve and Eso
---
Never leave something you don't want to lose where someone else can take it.

So, just to clarify that you have created the Eve account through Steam (ie you downloaded it through Steam and access it via your Library there), not via the CCP website. It needs to be that way first before you can add Steam-purchased packs to it.

Probably the best thing to do is fit a ship for buffer until you're comfortable with flying it enough, then take the handicap off once you know your way around it in exchange for better modules to incentivize careful but risky play.
---
&gt; NPC dialogue
---
"oh shit its sansha" followed by some spiky ascii tits
---
Those guys that do lvl 5s with carriers are doing kvk 5s with carriers for isk
---
I thought the corps make decent amount from taxes? Or is that only valid for Null-Sec/bigger corps?
---
diamond rats + incursion mechanics
---
Correct. For each level of strategic index on the ihub it adds 1 day to the anchor timer for non-ihub holders. That’s the disadvantage of not holding the sov.
---
IF the citadel gets defended (by ships) its already a content driver. So you simply cannot call that a mistake in the system.
---
Where I give you a point, is when only a single player takes over the citadel and defends it. That is pretty boring, but also easy to overcome with a small fleet already (as you needed with POSes)
---
Timing citadels, yes the last timer is annoying. But timing your citadel all at the same time (+/-2hrs) also means that you probably can't defend more than a few, and if undefended you can kill alot by just one formup.
---
Anyways, I don't see a problem in nullsec (SV5 is a perfect example). You can anchor hundreds of citadels and you will very unlikely be kicked out. BUT that needs alot of time, and the cost accumulates alot. And don't forget, to man-up a citadel, you need to fit it, which makes the loot worth alot more. I have not yet seen a huge problem in the cleanup phase after the sov-change. The cits were undefended and were just bashed over weeks, which is boring but it goes very easy.
---
In summary, there are huge numbers in citadels, but are about as easy to kill as POSes, while they most of the time give alot of loot (salvage).
---
Do you mind sharing said spreadsheet? ign Lt Motion
---
I'd love to go help rid us of the menace
---
It depends. Some people run L5s, but many people survive off the LP gained from plexing to fund their PvP. Although not lucrative, it more then funds frigates to fight in. Other groups mine moons, as some of the best moons are in LS, you'll occasionally see ice miners as well, but the risk involved in mining in LS makes those much rarer. There is also exploration running DED sites, or hunting clone soldier tags. Finally, some people hunt JFs by blaping them with a super on an NPC undock, or by using bait citadels.
---
TAPI always starts slow, then gets to full speed and streamrolls through regions

Unless you're planning to die, which will happen a lot ^^

triglavian faction titan?    
---
I’ve also been playing 10 years and recently broke my quit to save my jump clones and evac my shit because I got kicked. Typical eve behavior to quit the game and not giving away is and assets because reasons.
---
In this case it refers to the polarized weapons it uses.
---
We don't know, it's your account. 
---
Have you hit 5 mil SP? If so, you can't train any more skills as an Alpha (and there are waaay more Alpha skills than that, think about 20 mil worth). Otherwise, it's just faster training speed.
---
5. Here in Tuskers we honour ransoms and that had been the case for at least a decade, if you happen to get tackled by any of us just remember that. Good eve Tradition that's sadly been lost.

Mini AAR from WC: WinterCo forming for Rorq kills. We jump on a group of 3, shortly after Mr. PGL jumps his Fax in with some buddies, Legacy fleet follows in soon after. We almost got a stray 4th rorq but he was successfully defended, and thus the exodus began. We mostly just started running and gunning on the FRT side, trying not to get Boson'd. Kinda got backed into a corner but ELO baited a good chunk of their fleet with his Titan and then gave one of the other titan's a kiss before miraculously disappearing while our fleet got the hell out. Ultimately still had to safe log on the way back and return after a break. GF Legacy.

It has absurd DPS for a dessie, reaching around 1000 while still being able to field a respectable tank. It also has a very ling range, being able to project over 40km with long range ammo. It's biggest weaknesses are neuts, as they can easily turn off its gun, as well as any ewar that can force it to break or switch target, even if only for a short while. It works by ramping up it's DPS, requiring about 70 sec to reach it's max DPS, and forcing it to stop shooting for any reason will reset this spool up.

FW missons, clone soldiers, dead space plexes  , PI
---
**Rule #0! Never, ever, ever, ever fly ANYTHING you can't afford to replace!!!**
---
Rule #1! You consent to PvP when you undock. Even in high-security. CONCORD takes time to show up, and if I can vomit out enough damage (typically via alpha-strike) to blast you before CONCORD arrives on grid to give me the good old CONCORDOKKEN, I can kill you even in high sec. **Unlike just about any MMO, there are no safe havens in Eve!**
---
Rule #2! Scams are *fair game* in Eve. Double check any deals before accepting, and if anything seems suspicious, don't do it. Remember: YOU can scam, too! See if you can scam a scammer.
---
Rule #3! Autopiloting will get you suicide ganked. You won't want to learn the hard way WHY you don't autopilot.
---
Rule #4! Bookmark wormholes! Your corporation will thank you for it. And while you're at it, use and abuse bookmarks. You never know when they may save your skin.
---
Rule #5! Someone, somewhere, has a bullet with your name on it. Just pray he's not coming for you.
---
Rule #6! There are no such things as fair or unfair fights. There's only fights.
---
Rule #7! If your ship is about to blow, pick a random celestial in the Overview and MASH THE WARP BUTTON!
---
And finally... Rule #8! Fly safe!
---
That would depend on the type of fit, as well as the piloting skills of each player. An active T2 tank that isn't ancillary tends to be very bad, but a dead-space slephnier can probably tank a drek, though maybe not with neut pressure. If the drek has time to ramp up it will burn though a buffer slep in short order, but that isn't a grantee. Neither ship counters the other, so you can't say definitively who would win without a lot more information.

Cache had a few month period where it didn’t have more than half a dozen ihubs.
---
I think it’s more why do players hate cache?
---
Damn.... how is it’s tracking? I’m wondering whether I can try to kill this thing in my favourite scram kiting ship (that can also do tight orbits if needed)
---
 Always have backup ships or isk incase you lose your main ship. Don't trust anyone with more than you'd be comfortable losing on your own.Avoid smacktalk as you can always be tracked down later and taught a painful lesson for it.Ask older players for tips on how stuff works if you have any around.Always plan ahead .Don't put anyone's goals above your own.
---
Try out the different career paths early on (but not extensively), and pick one to invest in: military, industrial, exploration, business, pirate. 'Unlocking' things to do in game is real-time gated by training skills, so dont spread yourself too thin, after you have decided, pick a career and follow it.

Join a corp that has a good chance to support your playstyle, if you find nothing else, join eve uni. Its like a new player friendly corporation that will teach you stuff -  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE\_Universit](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_University)y .
---
Dont trust people offering you things, if they want something back, they are probably trying to scam you.
---
Nothing ^^
---
I just enjoy the BRAVE hubris hasn´t changed since 2014.

fuckin CCP should have been selling stuff like this and EVE merchandise for 15 years and never have financial problems to begin with.
---
Fuck off
---
BTW. Does doing lvl 5's after the capital nerf is still viable ? If i remember most of those missions can be done by destroying one structure / ship
---
I'm using one now and it's actually better even though I can only store one tool, rather than 3 with the T2 versions.  I prefer it.  Can now fit a scram on my Astero :p.
---
Is this a PANFAM (we all known where Frat sits here) v Test situation?
---
Yeah, lvl5s are the way to go.
---
Also a good idea to keep your isk generation and pvp on separate characters. This way, for example, you can also do idk high-sec factory planet PI or wormhole krabbing while pvping in fw.

I was under the impression that CCP's tendency to ignore bugs happened regardless of them being announced on reddit. I certainly can't thing of any bugs that were fixed as a direct result of a reddit post. Unless you have some examples?
---
Oh no
---
Bring Sajuuk to bear!
---
less than krabbed
---
so, your critic is that the new structures finally are not extremely complicated to build anymore?!? Because they make something actually more player-friendly it's bad?!?
---
I don't know much about there use vs. their use in solo engagements like you are thinking. I mostly know of them being used to hunt targets larger then itself, usually with a small fleet. Trig ships have generally become the premier skirmishing ships for NS.
---
Or you can also remove asset safety from nullsec. :D
---
Better the getting "Judge'd" over night.
---
8 billion isk you say. 
---
good job getting the rorqs before they died to rats.
---
&gt; For the love of god. Buy them many of them, but do not get attached. They’re just tools.
---
fc i've grown attached to my hel and its healthy complement of kill marks what do
---
Try lots of different paths in EVE. Don't get stuck in a happy place concoon routine.
---
I looked up it’s tracking, it’s apparently an anti support vessel by design and has excellent tracking. It’s literally a hard counter to almost all frigs, this is terrible news for me as a hookbill pilot (I fly a dual prop dual web dual tank fit), I love the bill because it has such an incredibly flexible engagement range, but the kikimora might force me to start taking neut fit cruisers now....   :( ....good thing solo pvp for me is srped by both corp and alliance though ;)
---
you killed rorqs. OK.
---
That rule not all stick to it so i recommend who loot first own it.
---
Some Alliance say that blue loot should contracted to the FC , i also recommend not to give him that .
---
OFC if you are at level you do not need that much ISK so you can leave it from the start.
---
Oh come on please get it down title delve. I would love trying to fight that stuff in my supers.
---
I paid like 70 bucks as well... 6 years ago, but that’s fine my grandchildren will inherit this game from me, so they can play it on release lol.
---
Even if those drifters on the gate look tempting. No touchy
---
In a small wh Corp you need everyone to be available at a given point. CEO is just stressing that you are useless if you are not on comms. When ships comes into your wh you gotta respond fast!

bug reported in january, only fixed in august after the july reddit post

Exactly THIS ... sadly. People often think critizising Citadels means being a POS-code fanboy. POS-code was awful in many ways but some things that had proven well could have been migrated - FUEL for EVERY service (incl. Tether and Weapons), an offline POS had no Forcefield - From 1st reinforce to final timer 72 hrs - no asset safety on M-Structures ... etc.
---
How do I fight smaller ship in a bigger ship? Like a cruiser facing a faction frigate for example. 
---
For turrets for example, do I need to put some tracking enhancers on lowslots, or dual webs would suffice? 
---
And for missiles, let's say I have HAMs, do I need target painters, or webs, or missile enhancers? 
---
Asking in a solo PvP situations, with short range fit (not ranged like autocannons, beams or rails).
---
Carriers only apply worse to frigates now and the NSA doesnt let you warp so not much has changed
---
1. Don't be uninformed or expect the game to explain everything.
---
Bookmark https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page and look up anything you encounter (ships, locations, etc.) there. Then remember some of the pages haven't been updated since previous 'expansions' so take things like suggested ship fits or lists of NPCs in a combat site with half a sea of salt. Also, look up ["Magic 14"](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Magic_14) there for a good list of starter skills that you need for pretty much any ship type down the road (you will invariably change your mind on what you want to do within a few weeks, and better to have the generic skills than invest it all in mining skills then decide to never mine again and realise that training time was wasted).
---
2. Don't train skills without planning.
---
On that topic, download [EveMon](https://github.com/peterhaneve/evemon/releases/tag/4.0.11), and use that to plan your skills. Unless you're positive you're going to be a paid subscriber always, filter by 'Alpha trainable' and prioritise getting the best Alpha-accessible skills you can. That way, if your sub lapses, you can still use all the things you have trained (and if you get hooked and keep payments up, the skill are useful anyway for building on with Omega-locked skills). You can also do any attributes optimisation: your attributes (intelligence, perception, memory, etc.) are only useful for training, and are by default spread evenly, but each skill only uses 2 of them, so if all your first year are primary Perception and secondary Willpower, better to steal points out of Int/Mem/Charisma and pump up Per/Will. Saves you only a teeny bit on the first couple of skills, but over the course of a year it could save you about a month of training time. 
---
3. Don't fly lonely, but don't just join the first corp (guild/clan) that invites you.
---
You want to find a corp so you have people to help you out or advise you whilst you bumble through the exceptionally confusing word you just entered. But, there are many corps set up that use newbies as a revenue stream. The 'default' corps have an 11% tax rate (so 11% of any mission rewards, bounties, etc. get paid to the corp instead of you), which gets more annoying as you get higher numbers coming in. There are many corps with a 0-5% rate that accept people just sitting in them as a tax dodge, so that's a temporary option, but don't look at it as an end goal, just somewhere to sit while you vet different groups. Be wary of the invites from corps that have high tax rates - I've had alts invited to corps with up to 50% tax! - as they often are using it as free money for the corp director(s) at your expense. Some decent corps will have a higher tax rate as it funds SRP (ship replacement program, ie if you get blown up doing corp activities, they buy you a new ship) and private stations for the corp to use and whatnot, so high tax is not always bad... but be wary of anything higher than 11% until you know who you're dealing with.
---
4. Don't be scared of "24 jumps away"
---
Things like the SOE Epic Arc (you'll know it when you see it) are great to get in on early: that one you can repeat every three months for a good chunk of empire rep, which will help if you plan to run high level missions, or if you plan on going to null and working for pirates without being shot by the NPC faction police when coming back up, but is usually a good distance away. Trade hubs will also be better for selling stuff quickly (or buying stuff cheaply) than whatever backwater system you're based out of, so it's worth the travel time. But as said, ignore Aura's dumb "engage autopilot" suggestion (toggle it on and off to complete her tutorial, then never touch it again!). Also, bookmark [GateCheck](http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/) and see if there's any camping happening on your route, and if so if you can avoid that system. Even high security space has ganking - frequently in systems near Jita, again you'll know it when you see it - and it's often better to take a slightly more circuitous route than to risk losing your week's worth of cargo to some gang of cheap-fit suicide gankers.
---
Yes. You need to work hard and perform team work in order to build something significant as your home.

---

Logged in Account numbers were at nearly the double amount in 2013 (saturday standard 2000 ET was around 60-65k), considering that back then only a chosen few had more than 10 Accounts and that today even new starters inject into 10 Rorquals in no time it is fair to say that there are more accounts per player than 5-6 years back. So if logged in accounts dropped massively while the number of players per account also is sinking, what does the math tell you?
---
Because you're defending a party filled with literal nazi and pedophiles, whom protect their own against crimes, dismantle protections against people to allow actual poison to be dumped into our water supply and trying take away healthcare for over 30 million americans, removing protections for "pre-existing conditions" and that's just a drop in the bucket to the heinous shit they're trying to do. And you have the fucking audacity to say "yeah, but all parties are corrupt. There's no difference, don't be tribal. Fuck right the fuck off. If you can't see how much worse the GOP is, you're too stupid to function in society.
---
Do not -*do not*- fuck with the game client [in any way shape or form].
---
You fuck with the client, it’s adios muchachos.
---
the traditional answer is "don't fly what you can't afford to lose." it's good advice for new players who might save every penny and buy a shiny new destroyer, get killed dipping their toes in lowsec with a ship containing their entire net worth, and then quit eve immediately
---
i've died in ships i couldn't afford to replace lots of times. i lost a titan trying to kill bait, and while i didn't really want to buy a new one after that, i couldn't afford to either. it took me a few months of saving to get a new one
---
it's just a suggestion for new players to avoid putting all their eggs in one basket, because it's very common for new players who do so to lose all their eggs in one go, get mad at the game for letting them do that, and quit immediately before they've experienced the fun this game has to offer
---
so i suppose a more apt way of stating that maxim would be:
---
##don't fly what you can't afford [emotionally] to lose
---
that aside, my best piece of advice for you would be that while you're new, everything you can use is cheap and easily replaced. while you're new, trust early and trust often. join a corp. make friends.
---
know that if you buy a galaxy pack or $15-20 worth of plex, you will literally not be able to lose enough frigates/destroyers to burn through that money in a month. as long as you don't do anything silly like use that money to jump-start yourself into a battlecruiser or battleship, and you will legitimately find it hard to spend that much money while you're new
---
make mistakes when you're new. just try to limit them to small, inexpensive mistakes, and try to learn from them. when you're older and more experienced, your mistakes will be necessarily more costly, so it's better to get them out of the way when your top-of-the-line combat ship costs less than a mil
---
I’m wondering, why are TEST doing so bad the first few big battles? When I first started playing 2-3 months ago, I had the impression that TEST wasn’t as huge as pamfam or goons but they seemed to be a bit more elite and specialized in a way, is something wrong with the leadership or the FCs? I’m jus trying to understand the situation.
---
At first my impression was that goonswarm was a bit of a Zerg, plus the name itself and the HUGE amount of people they had. Panfam seemed a bit like test with PL that I thought are PH graduates so another elite alliance and test as I stated above.
---
Would be nice to find out more about the alliances because as of now, all I know is “They are good, they are bad” which is nothing really.
---
Thorax comes to mind, I usually run it with a scram + dual web to slow them right down, plus I use Electron blasters as they have higher tracking (At the cost of lower damage).
---
If you can get kicked in the balls like that, not overly complain about that [you can say you hate that it happened, of course you can], and you still come back for more, you came to the right zoo, my dude.
---
Welcome to EVE.
---
I mean, it would just default to the base jump range of the ship without any skill modifiers. So, it'd be like 3.5 lightyears I think.
---
Can you please ask them to start then? Gotta actually get going to build that steam
---
After all these years you still think it will release someday.... This mentality lost you the 70 bucks in the first place!
---
Literally all Upwell structures use them....
---
TD Vedmak fight is me
---
I had 10 minutes worth of strong exile left when entering the arena and forgot to throw in another booster exactly as pvp weather kicked in, oh well
---
I did stalemate a pretty legit-fit cerb later, AB does mitigate quite a bit of rlml damage it turns out
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75977574/
---
This fit was my last attempt at beating the noprop cancer Cerb which i claim to be the inventor of.
---
However, noprop cerb on a budget of about 2.5b (including pod) cant be killed by anything in the arena. Tanks 2 damage mod Vedmak, cap regens through hg talisman Curse with some booster management, all while putting out 850+ kinetic rlml dps.
---
Only weakness - rlml reload, which means it can be stalemated by comparatively cheap (think 400-500m) passive regen Gila fits
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75964313/
---
took 2.5b ransom here and unintentionally scammed guy out of his kill
---
And thats pretty much abyss meta in a nutshell, pretty stale at the moment.
---
Sorry to highjack this thread, but I was wondering, those with FW alts, do you plex them or do you leave them alpha? As I’m also about to finish training my t2 FW alt, which is alpha..
---
Only after you buy my 9.7B hangar clear out cause I'm quitting eve.
---
1) Find a good corp.  2)  Ask a lot of questions.  If they don't answer your questions, go back to step 1.
---
Thats what I thought, but some people keep telling me otherwise.
---
I never said that, hence the sarcasm. 
---
I took a gamble when I paid the 70 bucks and I knew it. I did it anyway in case it actually had a chance of becoming something.
---
It’s 70 bucks anyway, big deal. It’s not like I spent 7000 on it.
---
Yes I understand, however we are currently appealing through formal channels to prove that these bans are flawed.
---
FC wats sarcasm?
---
An idea I had a while ago was assigning a certain number of points to each system based on the truesec, maybe from 5 to 15 (base of 5, +2 for every truesec below 0.0), and then restricting structures based on the number of points, with medium structures (eg. Raitaru, Astrahus, etc.) costing 1, large structures (eg. Azbel, Fortizar) costing 2, and extra-large structures (eg. Sotiyo, Keepstar) costing 3.
---
Maybe it's a good idea, maybe it's a bad idea, but it's something.
---
Assuming you're all running one account each, for pve you can handle sites easily with RR drone boats.  Rattles are king, but for low class sites you could do domis with no problems.  I'd run 2x of those and then have your third keep an eye out in a cloaky scanner/salvager. You can always swap out roles if someone wants a turn doing something else.
---
PVP wise, I'd brush up on nano skills. Get 2x cruisers/anti tackle boats. Caracals are a good point for learning. The Nomen is crazy fun, but less forgiving. A RLML ScyFI is a good balance between the two. For your third, you'll want either a tackle pilot in a malediction/stiletto, or a support/tackler in a keres. You'll be amazed at the engagement profile you have with a double antitackle/support gang. A dps boat is fine if someone wants to do like an Oracle or whatever, but I find that double antitackle makes your gang much more versatile, and increases your self sufficiency by heaps.
---
TEST LITERALLY POST EVERYTIME THEY KILL A RORQ HELLO
---
Here is a repo of most of the models in the game, they are taken from the high quality game files, however many people who print these professionally usually do their own post processing to achieve a very high quality print which would include additional details which would normally show on textures.

Maybe have said incursions be more like an invasion? IE, if not dealt with they will start taking territory outside of the initial incursion area.

Don't autopilot. DON'T

Please make this happen. You were already selling a few models at Fanfast 2015, and since then I was always hoping to be able to buy more of these. I even have the Prophecy model on my office desk\^\^

yes I think Ill have some of that too please
---
Test was never ‘elite’. Tbh they were always the second in everything. Even in the competition of worst alliances they would score the second place.

But have to add that it´s high quality material. I was suprised when I bought your Prophecy model back at Fanfast 2015 and how high quality and heavy it felt when I held it in hands\^\^

a better question would be, "why hasn't ccp ever taken merchandising seriously? every attempt has been half-hearted and terrible. players would love to throw money at things like t-shirts, models, and other crap, but you won't let us. why?"

Steam app on your phone is awesome, and you can get it via that. It's useful to have if only for the Steam Guard function (mobile authenticator). Still have to do all the downloads when you get home, but at least it's 'owned' so you can take your time (and actually sleep before worrying about it!).

Well yeah that’s true, not a lot of different methods come close to that. So I General speaking it’s quite good but I am sure there are ways to make more :P

Since they introduced the Trig ships I thought that they should give them a fitting bonus for utility high modules. Like this you give people more reason to use them, while at the same time prohibit them from using their fitting resources for tank and other stuff

Problems:
---
My boyfriend and I live together. He actually got me into EvE.
---
1. His computer did a 'splodey at one point, so he logged in using my PC (ie my launcher) on his accounts until he was back up and running. I've also logged into my accounts on his PC when mine was in pieces. Sure, we don't pin the accounts to each others launchers (and it's only when no other option because we're paranoid about it flagging as account sharing), but accessing via the other's launcher is entirely possible.
---
2. Same house, same router, same IP address. We can both be playing on our own accounts via our own PCs and still have the same IP. 
---
3. What if he wants to buy me gametime as a present/help when finances are tight (or vice versa)? What if one of us got a super well paying job and the other became a lady/lord of leisure, with the former paying for both our accounts? Different people, same credit card.
---
Yeah, our situation is probably not reflective of 90% of the playerbase, but it's reasonable enough that it could be used as an excuse even by those actively trying to game the system, with no way to really tell the difference between the scadgers and folk like us.
---
I saw those.
---
I wanted to buy one, I didn’t have a way to easily carry it along or I would have gotten the Megathron myself.
---
The reason these were never made in quantity is that the injection mould costs crazy money. With 3D printing I believe they should now be able to make those faster and cheaper.
---
And there are so many nice ships to choose from :-(
---
Keepstars should have been limited to one per region and one per alliance.
---
Oh you poor dear. To be honest, I'd be surprised you remember your own name that deep into a shift like that, so very fair point! :)
---
4 to 1 nice skills
---
I tested all the drone boats. AFK VNI is the most efficient ratting ship. You have to factor in if you get caught and how long you have to rat to replace it. (There’s a youtube video that math this out already). I got excited when I got into my first Thanatos. I didn’t pass 25m a tick. You need many more months to train on the support carrier skills!! RS is a good option but if caught it can put you out a billion easily.  Vni get caught you can replace it within the hour of ratting.
---
If only. There's a fueled citadel that's timezone tanked that I'm waiting to hit low power before I shoot it. I have no idea how much fuel it has left (CCPLs let me cargo scan citadels to see remaining fuel/ammo/stored fighters) so I just have to sit and wait and hope they didn't stock it with 2 years of fuel.
---
Right before I died you brought me in armor and later a Sacrilege killed that Cerb lol https://zkillboard.com/kill/75977278/
---
I am curious to see what the T2 Ved can do
---
Don't talk in local
---
Thank you for providing Example 1
---
Cloaky ships are recommended. Astero/Stratios/T3c.
---
You can hide easly cloak and hide in wormhole if a bigger danger is comming.
---
Naga works solo for C2 combat Sites.
---
For a small fleet of cruiser, C3 sites is ok as long as you dont trigger all waves at the same time.
---
If i can advice :
---
Don't do relic/data with a cruiser, bring an Astero or a cheap heron.
---
Can we pls NOT get a BR for every fking Rorq kill in this game?  
---
If i wanna check them ill go and watch at zkill, not reddit.

I was in goons for a while but it was too big for my liking. That was my problem honestly, people stood no chance against a huge blob backed by a blob of supers, always winning is not always fun.
---
U mad bro? Cause i am not. :) Made my loss back in 2 minutes.
---
i guess they made siege module a % bonus and that means it doesnt stack with gyos etc etc as well?
---
Yours also barely tanks 600 vs. explosive (cold) post pvp-weather, which means it can be killed by a lot of things, including Vaga, Muninn, Sacrilege, probably even the standard 1 damage mod vedmak.

My last cerb was tanking 850 vs. explosive (cold)  and 1150 vs. em (hot), post abyssal weather.

---
Dont join TEST or Goons
---
No revs or Phoenix?
---
Nobody is going to be already formed in pvp ships just to save a Rorqual. They'll be out doing their own stuff as well. They might have their pvp alts on standby but the majority of time their isn't a "defence fleet" ready and waiting. My personal experience.
---
Biggest nerf was btw the carrier sig increase, which makes hunters significantly easier and faster to scan you down. I stopped doing lvl5s because of this alone.
---
Do the creative directors and people who are influential in the direction of the game actually play the game relatively hardcore? (Ie not mining in ventures in highsec like he does)
---
Who said anything about dying? You must be pretty weak if something like this can kill you. :D
---
TAPI ARE THE OPPRESSED UNDERDOGS FIGHTING AGAINST THE CHINESE BLOBBING BOTTER MENACE
---
Take *everything* with a grain of salt. Even this post.
---
Botting plexing/mission running
---
But honestly mission running is pretty decent ISK (Lvl 4s) if you chain them together. Its kindof like burners they give much higher payouts than normal lvl4s and they can be done quicker and with smaller ships (prot or tengu for gal/cal)
---
Wait... how? You don't *lose* stuff in the alpha...
---
Maybe if every other minor inconvenience wasn't posted about on Reddit, they would notice when something that matters was
---
Nothing in particular besides TEST being the embodiment of ‘theres always bigger fish’, in this case TEST being the ‘smaller fish’ always.
---
Goons are the largest threat so take them out first.

What does it mean when the PVP gate is closed ? You mean you try to jump through but it just deny it ?

Really hard to pull that off, cmon

We underestimated our opponent frankly.  There was talk about how Fraternity. couldn't lead fleets and they had to pay their FCs just to show up for fleets and in the first few engagements things went well.  However Fraternity. stepped up their game and most of our membership hasn't gotten as invested in the war effort as we'd like.  Many many people are just wanting a safe space to stay and make ISK and aren't going on more than exactly what is required so we're just not getting the people we need.
---
Don't use modifications and don't buy ISK from other people with real money. That should be it. You are allowed to shoot and scam people as much as you like as long as you manage to gain their trust
---
TEST has always embodied the "We're bad and its ok" mentality, which the top leadership is trying to change for a few years. 
---
In terms of doing bad in the war, both sides are rather even at the moment, both sides have had battles like this.
---
Instructions unclear, bumped titan with sieged fax.
---
This is how alliances die you know.
---
I preferred passive shield builds when starting out, but yeah I agree it's best to fit tank over dps when you are new.
---
Never join a high sec mining corp.
---
Dont buy a Super
---
There is little substitute for experience.
---
Remember that sometimes information which tells you nothing can be just as valuable as something that tells you everything. (e.g. if they're not doing X then what could they be doing?)
---
Most importantly: Understand what motivates people.
---
Some people are just in it for the isk. These are the easiest to handle, but also dangerous... if they see a better, more lucrative offer they'll turn on you in an instant. You'll need to drip feed them properly *and* make them understand that there's always more isk to come as long as they keep playing ball.
---
Some people want revenge (or to settle personal vendettas). Easy to turn, difficult to handle. You're a means to an end for them. If you're too "slow" in their opinion, they'll take matters into their own hand and out themselves. They're also liable to boast about their own deeds or otherwise raise their profile. Not great.
---
The best, of course, are those that believe in a cause. But for that reason they're also the hardest to turn.
---
Propaganda and psyops are their own branch of fuckery which doesn't overlap much with espionage, although a little espionage can make them much more effective.
---
I use this method too. It works. But you only get like 1-2 Thera wh near you a month. Patience is key. Just keep hoarding and Thera stocked with the stuff you want in.
---
If it’s a fair fight - you planned it wrong 
---
(A gross over simplification, but generally - if you don’t have a good plan as to how you will win, then you are very likely to lose)

Already replaced, still a dick move
---
I picked the wrong day to go to work!
---
F
---
Yeah I'm well aware.  We've got people like the guy in the posted BR losing 3 Rorquals because he left them completely unattended while he went on another fleet.  We've got people running incursion fleets in caps for no good reason not 30 minutes before a strat op for the perimeter keepstar.  There is no cohesion and the reigns have been let slip in the relative peace we've enjoyed farming Esoteria.  I'm hoping the alliance has an awakening and people get engaged but honestly I don't really have much hope.  Just gonna keep keepin on while I still can and see where the future takes us.
---
If you like Gilamilas then check out abyssal stuff. Idk about that much but people buy Gilas for me and lose them there. I guess the rest survive and make money.
---
the NC one if I remember even had a personality test etc
---
GF frat and friends. Got lots of kms in my carrier and extracted in low hull. Thanks for bringing it.
---
&gt;Killboards are your public score in eve and are how other players generally judge your abilities.
---
There's two ways to interpret this.
---
If you interpret this as 'killboards let you judge someone's role and ship set' then this is a legitimate statement and it's valuable information for judging them before a fight.
---
If, however, you interpret this as 'killboards are how I say my dick is bigger' then no, killboards are meaningless and you're an asshat.
---
2 nestors &amp; a leshak !
---
You can scan down 3-4/10s in Lowsec.
---
Use a stratios with a mobile depot, run a scanning fit and have a combat fit in your ship. Scan down a site, switch to combat fit using your depot and run it.
---
Be careful, people WILL gank you while running sites in lowsec(0.5 and under sec status) so either join a corp in low sec or find empty systems.
---
Using my phone, but there are plenty of stratios fits and guides to do this, I did it for a month, it can be hit and miss on the amount of idk you ear , some nights I'd make over a billion in green loot, others nothing but I was getting better isk than when I was doing explo overall.
---
That's impressive, how did you get so rich
---
I see there was a ceremonial [chemoing of harpies](https://zkillboard.com/character/2113650154/) to kick things off.
---
^(fuck harpies)
---
NSA? No Strings Attached?
---
Pgl doesn't like his cap fleet anyway.
---
The corp in charge of the NC one, later joined TAPI.. I ask, how did they get access to release it :thinking:
---
So there are 22mil sp available to alphas but you cant train past 5mil as an alpha. So if you have max alpha sp you can get a week of training you wouldnt otherwise get that wont revert as long as ypure training alpha skillz. Also omega trains at twice the speed of alpha so if you have focused training you can get an extra week out of training faster of you wanted better FW or null standing fleet frigs/dessies faster or w/e if you want. Or if you didnt want to pay you could boost your exploration or incursion ships if you wanted to try to plex with isk (not recommended unless you live in a country with weak currency or bad minimum wage laws because otherwise just mow your neighbors lawn for 15 bucks and play eve for a month)
---
I was going to save TAPI must  be having nightmares, but I guess that isn't accurate after that fight.
---
Is that what they did in Geminate?
---
To be honest, 3D printing never has the same quality than when using mold, or at least I until now never saw a real high quality 3d printable plastic, hence why those models do have such high quality
---
it is a fight involving hundreds of players.
---
It’s true. I believe we’re going to get there in a few more generations of 3D printing. This technology has not come of age yet. I expect great things from that in the next 10 years.
---
ur wrong
---
This is like the 4th nightmare fleet test has welped so far, thankfully they poor fit them.
---
This isn't always entirely accurate due to the nature of how missile application works. But this should hold true in most situations so it's useful as a ballpark; if you were not applying full damage to a target before the patch because of sig/speed, you now apply roughly 30% less DPS to that target. So if you were doing 3000 DPS to a target before, you're doing about 2100 DPS now.   
---
The guy in the thread has 1 omni for tracking, and was shooting my completely untackled retribution burning in a straight line at max speed which also has a Coreli A-Type MWD (The lowest sig/highest speed) deadspace module in the game. He was applying about 140 DPS to me, before the patch that would have been 180 DPS tops. So not exactly sure why he thinks it was nerfed so hard.
---
I'll take 46% efficiency being as outnumbered as we were.
---
Lot of fuck ups with the subcap fleet on my part, probably cost us the isk war by losing like 20-30 nightmares there at the end, but otherwise we did pretty well all things considered.
---
\&gt; PVP-ing aint cheap 
---
It can be, especially if you are doing FW pvp. Check out the vids by Blights Wretch, most of his vids use ships that only cost around 10m isk fully fitted. A single large plex will usually pay back at least 20m in tags alone, and a hefty chunk of LP on top of that.
---
I mean, it was 53.5% efficiency for you guys when you outnumbered us by 50%.  I wouldn't call that a welp.
---
Yes he is wrong. 
---
1. He used a shit fit
---
2. He expects to be able to kill anything thats smaller/cheaper than his ship
---
It depends on what you're PVPing with. If you're struggling with ISK, Generally speaking, the loyalty points you get from capturing a novice or a small plex will pay for a T2 Fit T1 Frigate. So just O-Plex in a ship like an Algos that still has good chances against most of the FW meta, play passively and don't take anything you're uncomfortable fighting until you capture 1 plex and then play more aggressively and your wallet won't take a hit and you'll still have fun.
---
After all that blob ree we've been hearing from them, dont tell me they are bragging about bringing a bigger blob??
---
Now with added strings attached.
---
im not in either side
---
With how much piggles hyped this you would expect a better showing from Goons and their pets.
---
You called 47% efficiency a "welp".  I think it's clear where your bias lies.
---
\^\^ Example 2.
---
Thank you for your participation.
---
&gt;I'll take 46% efficiency being as outnumbered as we were.

---
i'm not sure ...
---
&gt;  but otherwise we did pretty well all things considered. 
---
Well, looks like both side liked this fight.  I wasn't here infortunatly :'(
---
worst looking br tool ive seen in a while
---
Join Test.
---
Yeah, the cruiser models we sold (Stratios and Prophecy) were sold for around Kr. 16,000 or so (around $130) and they sold REALLY fast (like, within 10 minutes they were sold out). 
---
These came from Kisaki too. We have a few of their models in the office, and they're really good quality.
---
There's a lot to consider with setting something up like this, including logistics, so I can't promise anything, as it's not really my decision to make.
---
Really hope ship models become a thing at some point though! :)
---
&gt; With how much piggles hyped this
---
Not much at all?  I notice that BR has Pandemic Horde, NC, and what's left of PL, but doesn't have any goons.  Weird.  I've always heard that panfam comes because goons come.
---
2 pings in 24hrs is "hype". Lol
---
I mean goons and TAPI are pretty much one and the same.
---
Always seems to be more accurate and faster to update than zkb so fuckit.
---
You can try to scan down 3-4/10s in highsec or lowsec, however they likely will be quickly ran by anyone paying attention due to their profitability. 
---
You can also check this [list of anomalies] (https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites#Anomalies), and look for combat sites that are in your region, and determine which ones escalate to which sites. For example, if you have Guristas Refuge / Guristas Hideaway sites in your region, you can see that these sites tend to escalate to 4/10 DED sites, while 'Den' sites tend to escalate to 5/10 sites.
---
RLM is good for a cruiser size to kill AssaultFrigs.
---
HAM are good but a kite frig like a garmur will be unreachable.
---
In every case, laser, autoc or missiles, webs are very useful. TargetPainter is good is you use missiles.
---
Selling PLEX
---
Not really? For anything but a major major timer goons don't help us and we don't help them.
---
You have the wrong fight there buddy.
---
Waaaaarriors .... come out to plaaaay!!! Way to go Wloo compsci!
---
Oh its no secrets I hate all the blobs,
---
Im just saying that test lose more than half of its nightmare fleet, which means that they whelped it, regardless if you were out numbered for the first time in your eve career.
---
i am not realy happy about goung low sec with my stratios. since i would hate to lose it. i was not over joied by losing my gila... :/
---
With how much piggles blames the fight on his fleet its any wonder that he has ping rights to begin with.
---
Sorry I meant Goons and Goons lite.
---
Looks more like Frat called in their pets in NC. to come help them.
---
Oh I see you're just here to talk shit
---
Please stop using this br tool, it's beyond awful on mobile.
---
I don't care if the titan is tethered on a keepstar, you don't bump it.
---
First rule of eve is to fly only what you can afford or are willing to lose.
---
Stratios/Gilas are the most efficient 3-4/10 site runners, you can always just scan the site and run it with a different ship if you want. Up to you man.
---
Me talk shit, you must have me confused with Ov3rdose.
---
Even worse: Switching clone closes your assets / inventory window :&gt; I hate it.
---
Test hasn't really done THAT badly.  Its been roughly even in off-tz.
---
honestly - a few years ago Test was a mid-level entity without many close friends.  For anyone thats been in Test for several years....things are just fine.  Not being on the bring of being invaded used to be good.
---
I give... everyone... about half a day before someone cracks the code from alphabet into Triglavian, throws it out there and people have learned how to read it. Maybe a week before someone has written something that converts it back for you on your second monitor

He literally admitted he fucked up at the end of this NM fleet (look up in the comments) and the bombing he also blames on himself. Mate you need to check your comments. You have reached sino brain posting and I promise you its not nice down here
---
Good news Bliss ;)
---
i don't think anyone should take advice about how alliances die from someone with a PL Flair...
---
TAPI has shown they should move back to Caracals until PGL shakes the rust off.
---
not my problem
---
First, why are you replying to me?  Second, that's not this fight.
---
No shit its not this fight thats why i said "meanwhle in USTZ"
---
TAPI is the literal whipping boy of EVE. If not being used by Goons they are being used by NCPL.
---
the BR is provided in the OP, test was out numbered 470 to 295 so yeah only losing 155 bil while killing 135 bil is a pretty solid outcome
---
I see that’s a good little insight thanks
---
What does that make it one apology for the literal hundreds of times that he has fucked up and taken it out on his fleet.
---
Never is a long time. Wrap urself in a gravitational bubble and jump right in.
---
You might, with how much of this sub that TAPI controls it's no wonder half of it is regurgitated swill.
---
This only opens 1 page?
---
That’s interesting, so brave was in place of what is PH right now? I wonder what was the reason, I find Eve politics rather interesting
---
this was already posted
---
Failed attempt at r/all bait
---
sleep &gt; eve
---
I mean as long as there is content, everything should be fine, right?
---
A couple of fitting rules:
---
1: Don't fit more than one kind of tank. Shield or Armour. Pick one. (There are a few ships where a hull buffer tank is appropriate. And a few situations where dual tanking makes sense. But these are few and far between. You're probably not going to hit them)
---
2: Don't fit more than one kind of weapon. If you're using railguns, use all the same model. Don't mix and match them. (Some ships are designed for split systems. Like guns and missiles. This is fine. but no fitting Artillery and Autocannons. Pick one. If you don't, you'll cripple your performance. You'll be bad at all ranges, rather than good at one.)
---
All rules are made to be broken. But if you have to ask if it's time to break it, it's almost certainly not.
---
I was originally creating this as a reply to another comment but it grew into its own thing so I'm going to leave it as a top-level reply.
---
&gt; Ignore the people who say "never trust anyone in Eve". Trust is alive and well in Eve, and is one of the most valuable things you can have in the game.
---
This is huge. There is *absolutely* a point to be made for exercising caution when it comes to trusting other people in this game (as anyone *can* screw you over at any time), especially with assets, but not everyone is acting in bad faith all the time. It's to the point where some new players are afraid to even ask for advice because they've heard so much about how everyone in EVE is out to get you in any way they can (which is true in some aspects, but not so much in others).
---
As a general rule, advice given is given in good faith, even when (especially when) it's being given by the person who just turned your ship into a pile of salvage. There's a person on the other end of that gun, and most of us are all too happy to help point new players in the right direction, provided they ask nicely.
---
Don't get salty. Save for a few rare exceptions, there are no victims in EVE, there are only people playing a game. In any game you're going to have winners and losers. If you get salty after being killed, everyone, including the nicer players, is going to take great delight in drinking your sweet, salty tears.
---
Complaining about how much skill it must take to kill a "defenseless" miner/hauler/explorer/what-have-you is a popular one. You're not defenseless. You have functioning eyes, and you have a warp drive that lets you move faster than any ship can hope to catch. Make use of it. Learning how to avoid fights you don't want to take is a skill on its own, and one of the most important skills to learn in EVE. There are going to be people hunting you no matter which profession you choose (unless you're station trading), and preventing those hunters from catching you is as much a part of the profession as anything else. **Don't fly anything you can't afford to lose.**
---
Is the coke good?
---
Quick question:
---
281vs336
---
133b vs 157b
---
508 point lost vs 336 point lost
---
how the point are calculated ? why test lost less point while losing more iskies ?
---
Tbh it's closer to a welp than glorious victory.
---
Hail our new Ming overlords
---
ccplz stop ruining the game thx
---
Well i just find it little more objective to add to your rorq kills your failed attemts.
---
Because it looks good on paper when u kill 2-3 and make ego boosting thread about it, but when u add to it 20-30B in losses in failed attempts when u run and let TAPI loot the field, it's not so heroic anymore.
---
he is making a point of progod saying he was outnumbered but that BR he Acia linked is what they formed for a 74 man fleet.... " i was outnumbered" only way test fights is if they outnumber the other fleet...they just got a taste of their own medicine
---
we'll never know because this guy linked a screenshot instead of the BR, probably for spin reasons.  All he had to do was put the URL in instead of the screenshot
---
cause FRT lost Ihub? maybe
---
Your on drugs mate, thats a PL br killing rorqs, it isn't my thread either. Lets talk about bombers vs 100 TAPI nighmares. Over to you
---
Alliance built around the meta of krabbing, finds that half of their alliance only wants to krab, im shocked
---
Basically nothing. You can do whatever you want. Just be sure to handle the conseguencies 😜

 https://zkillboard.com/related/30000478/201904120800/
---
When mining in Minecraft (shocking I know), there are all sorts of hazards you can run into. Dungeons, ravines (with drops far enough to kill you with fall damage), creepers (suicide-bombers, basically), and, of course, lava. Most methods of mining let you see what you're digging into before you head into it, so if you come across something dangerous you can prepare first. If you dig straight down, however (digging the block directly underneath your feet), you won't be able to stop yourself from falling right into whatever it is you're digging into.
---
If you die while in lava, all the stuff you were carrying will fall into the lava and burn, meaning you can't retrieve it.
---
It's not really about the quantity of people that know me. Due to the corp and alliance being small, in this alliance I talk to the corp CEO every day and we do lots of stuff together, and I occasionally talk to the alliance leads too (though admittedly much less often), and if I had a problem with something or an opinion about something, I do believe that that opinion is taken into consideration. I don't suppose that if I were to join Dreddit/Brave/PH/Goons, the CEOs and alliance leads would give two flying shits about what I have to say.
---
Nevertheless, I might give it a try just to see how it goes. Partially because /r/eve seems to vehemently despise small renter alliances for some reason. Which is odd because they also don't like blobs and capital PvP and want more small-gang PvP...
---
to be honest there is only like 100 TAPI from 230 on one side of BR, so there is more players from other Legacy alliances than from TAPI, but hey, it's propaganda thread so name it TAPI vs ****
---
Cool. Thanks for that big response.

They don't, no.  They're autocracies, not democracies.  But what do you have to say that's so important anyway?  You undock, you hang out, you go on fleets... it's no different in big blocs, except there's usually more to do.

Not exactly.

Brave was huge back in 2015, TEST had just suffered massive losses and were camping on the couch in Catch. PL evicted both Brave/TEST and the coalition we had "HERO". Brave also had massive internal problems at this point in time, there were a few coup's and everyone was trying to hold onto power.
---
PL saw the use of a huge meatshield alliance and to provide a place for new players on the N3 (which was PANFAM at the time) side of the war. PL poached key members of Brave and used them to set up PH. Previously Goons/TEST/Brave had massive numbers but N3 had superior ships/isk/etc, this worked for awhile but superior ships have been outclassed by sheer numbers these days. 
---
TEST has been on both sides of the war over the years.
---
never because imbalanced
---
Got reffed....and the same shit that happen in IAS will happen again...not holding my breath but...CN TZ will rekt again...
---
Actually , br is pretty 50/50 ,test outnumbered,chinese at home with possibility of endless reships.Saying that Test is in bad position is not seeing the big picture as we got fresh MER where detorid mined 2000kkk and esoteria 6000 it show that test can fight this war forever in 50-50 battles and their possibility to replace loss is much higher than for FRAT, plus perimeter keepstar with isk boost...think again who is doing bad.
---
Got a link?
---
You can scan down 3-4/10 in Highsec too. Of course don't do it in The Forge because stabbing yourself in the balls is more fun than compete with 2 other gilas and a jackdaw for every site.
---
How many times has PL come down to farm Brave? 3 or 4 now?
---
Even if I personally don’t like the whole lying&amp;betraying part of spying in Eve; thank fuck it evolved away from Kugutsumen just breaching everybody’s forums and feeding PL leadership with admin accounts.
---
Some awesome numbers from TAPI pets here
---
Bad advice. Go to low sec ASAP. It’s a game, who gives a shit if you die? That’s the fun part.
---
Points come from numbers and ship class.
---
If you kill a Dread with 10 BS, it's worth more points then if you kill it with 10 dreads, or 20 battleships.
---
Basically Test lost fewer points because we were outnumbered.
---
and wasn't there same ago boosting thread about 2-3 killed TAPI Rorguals two days ago?
---
And when I post your failed attempt to kill TAPI rorq loosing 11B in the process I need to be on drugs. 
---
OK then.
---
I kinda like this. A massive Triglavian assault into huge swaths of null. 
---
Don't make it impossible, but make it so that if players want to take it back, they have to *take it back*. As in push them back out of systems at huge cost in ships and time, smashing trig structure and ships, then hold that territory against counter attacks. 
---
It'd also be an interesting time to introduce things like Trig capitals and the like. Atm we've got what, 1 frigate, 1 destroyer, 3 cruisers, a battlecruiser and a battleship? Maybe even Trig freighters and mining ships, etc. Effectively create a 5th empire, but ones the players can actually materially affect.
---
Thanks a lot for this little back story, I really wish I start playing eve sooner it would of been interesting to see things evolve. I feel like things might have stalled at this point, I mean I hope this frat/test war turns out great as Brave attends the fleets too, and there is no such thing as too much content haha, wars are healthy for this game.

he did not take it with phone tho

Why do people use this fucking trash BR tool.

Some of the best FW PVP Pilots can fund themselves by blowing up others ships.

---
Here's a fun idea. Put the greenest guy in a brick tanked frig with tackle and a relic module. Have him slowly do a site. Have the other in a cloaked cruiser and somebody in a cloaked saber or another cloaked cruiser. Now just wait for someone to take the bait.
---
A war is a marathon not a sprint.
---
agree
---
You're really picking the wrong thread to push this narrative.  
---
Lemme help you out.  You want to spout this bullshit when goons show up and panfam doesn't.  Not the opposite.
---
nice spin on losing o7
---
I like how every narrative they're trying to spout doesn't apply for this fight.
---
You'd think they'd pick a better time to push a narrative.
---
if they could get help of goons
---
There’s lots of quiet lowsec out there. Also try skilling into a t3d because they are super slippery and you can do a lot of sites in lowsec in one.

They are allowed to play the game and join any alliance with any account they created after joining ccp, but only as long as they don't reveal to anyone who they are, this includes a ban of using anything that can reveal their IP (think forums, mumble, irc etc...). Which offcourse makes jounong most bigger alliances a problem. A commenly used work around is using a csm member as vouch so non off that is required by the alliance you're joining.
---
You are consenting to PvP when you log in. There are dozens of ways people fight wars, battles and duels in this game without ever undocking (mostly doing market PvP and scamming).
---
Off topic, but OP....
---
did you remember how to cast the fireball?
---
No, they had to "set free" the last one as he pointed out implications to ingame economy for some stuff CCP needed badly to make investor numbers look great. That is why all the "infinite-scalable-afk-Rorqual-farms/Skillfarming/Injector-Shit" happened
---
Ihubs reinforced with a decently even fight. Weird definition of losing you have.
---
crying to be outnumbered when you guys rage pinged for Elo's 74 man fleet....that was a 200+ vs 74.... and now you crying about getting slapped with your own medicine? dang....this 2019 cry me a river stories...reminds me of Telemundo Novelas yo!
---
Nowadays you can make yourself more isk with fw than with super
---
Pest Alliance Please Ignore, please stop the bringing up the "rest of EVE coalition" narrative again, just because some random dudes bombed the f**k out of you because you are bad doesn't mean they are in some kind of a coalition.
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose twice.
---
It slowly starts to look like ... that you need to learn Chinese
---
This BR tool is beyond awful.
---
&gt;only way test fights is if they outnumber the other fleet
---
Considering that we took the fight this thread is actually about outnumbered, that statement is verifiable false.
---
From my very first day playing... don't shoot the gates.
---
Had to down vote for the godawful br tool used.
---
I hate this br tool but it works better than others :s
---
you've never had the thrill of seeing a titan bridge off a raitaru then, have you?
---
also you can activate it set for jita 4-4 after in warp to your station instadock bookmark so that it doesn't matter if you lag loading grid
---
Do you what is an "escalation" ?
---
in a way, even reddit is kind of pvp, as obnoxious as that may be
---
What the fuck is "do you what"?
---
If FRT had an escalation, we knew about it
---
Your narrative is shit. Work on it.
---
Your need to try and farm imaginary points asap is no excuse.
---

---
I dont really think you got the point of my comment :D
---
Looks like NC is actually pushing this narrative.   
---
And if TEST is so bad, you should have done far better with number advantage you had.
---
&gt;[https://br.inyour.space/](https://br.inyour.space/) works and looks fine.
---
Please make one more accurate than mine, and i'll replace it
---
Mate, "we" were the "random dudes". It's 2019 and you still believe in the flair?
---
talk in jita local.
---
this guy has leaks we should ban him
---
They show up to timers and shoot only us.
---
We don't do this bullshit where "oh, they are/aren't in our/your coalition so it's lame/ok".  That's your narrative when it comes to us and Goons, and it's a shit narritive.
---
I used to save up all my stuff to sell because the trade hub was 4 jumps away, which took about an hour round trip.
---
I dont think you got mine....so we even?
---
What are better ways?
---
Considering Goons weren't there, what the actual fuck does this stupid ass post have to do with anything?
---
"an moron"
---
Very Awesome
---
Missions in highsec, factional warfare in low or pirate anoms in null.
---
No.. that literally does nothing beneficial because they're still there
---
Don't share NDA information.
---
Well it had a 3/2/4 layout before and that was also meh. The thing just doesnt have enough fitting for what it needs to equip
---
How many more programs/employees does he need to cut to make EVE more profitable to make the new owners happy?
---
How many dumb ass side projects is CCP going to pursue (and sink capital into) over the next 5 years?
---
Networked Sensor Array :)
---
You said you took the fight in outnumbered, but you were first in the system, and the fight escalated. Damned I must explain everything ?!
---
It looks like CCP has finally removed the on-demand deadspace safespots that you used to be able to generate using the agency introduction missions.
---
They have been restricted to high-security space.
---
&gt; Introduction content is not available in your current system. To resume the introduction, move to a high-security status system and activate the introduction via the Agency.
---
Create an alternate personality and essentially role play that in a corp of your choosing. Make new email addresses, discord handles,  you can get real wild and have a separate PC for mumble/TS3 to minimize risk of your address matching should anyone ever get that.
---
At the same time, decide what you want to accomplish. Do you want to embezzle isk? Do you want to destroy the corp/alliance from the inside (move up through the rankings) or just want to supply intel to your masters to help the Good Guys in their ops?
---
Start somewhere easy to get into and see what you can do then work your way into a smaller target if you want.
---
No, you just need to stop being stupid.
---
We knew what you had formed.
---
Letting that dude go was one of the worst decisions they have made (for that time).
---
Its been a downhill tumble since.
---
Lol no, Panfam flashformed, the fight already started my dude, stop telling bullshit.
---
"Catch up mechanic"
---
lmao
---
Well, in this corp/alliance, if I can be frank, the doctrines are shit, the FCing is shit, the coordination is shit, the high-level decisions are shit, etc. This sounds bad, but we're all thinking about ways in which we can become slightly less shit. Which is fun. Not everything is figured out yet.
---
It's like in deckbuilder card games, you can either build your own deck or simply look up good meta decks from the internet. The latter will be significantly stronger, yes, but the former is a lot more fun to do, because the fun in a deckbuilder game is for the most part... the deck building!
---
So, back to Eve, figuring out fits and fleet compositions and how to fly them is much more fun than simply using existing doctrines and being told what to do by an FC who's done this 1000 times before.
---
oh please cry me a river....didnt you guys outnumbered Elo's fleet earlier?? 250+ to 74?? stop making TAPI the victim here ya hear?? and before you say "Elo could had taken the fight" he didnt had to...they still isk positive :)
---
You know you can just leave if you see the enemy is coming with a bigger fleet right?
---
Join PushX with an alt :)
---
There are still other employees at CCP he can fire, thereby redirecting cash flow for his own benefit. He'll go when he is the last person standing.
---
They chose the bot name to humiliate those who rent from them.
---
Brcat's been having issues lately which is why some people use this one
---
is it though?
---
Isk is a non issue anyway. It's all about morale.
---

---
Well a 3/3/4 layout would help (nealry all faction frigs have a x/3/4 or x/4/3 layout...)
---
If you go for a tanky version the retribution is way better since it will do more dps on better range and tank better
---
If you go for a dps version the retribution is probably still better...
---
PANFRT posters:
---
Let me help you out here. You all seem new at this spin shit. 
---
You can't just toss all your narrative points in a hat and just randomly pull shit out.
---
You can't be all like "Test is Goon pets", on a fight goons weren't at.
---
You can't say "Test only knows how to blob" in one of the few fights we're outnumbered.
---
It's not accurate to post about how bad Test lost in a basically 50/50 fight in which we won the timer.
---
If you had gone with "LOL Test feeds Nightmares again", ok. That has wheels here.
---
But posting a BR From a totally different fight in another region and another time zone?  Come on. You're better then that.
---
We should really ask CCP/CSM to change this.  Competent people do it by hand anyway, and it's just a pita for no real reason.
---
Are we that scared of travel ceptors or freighters auto-piloting?  Who cares?
---
What does that have to do with this? 
---
Also, who's crying? I'm only stating facts.
---
That doesn't even mean anything. And it's clear without the flair.   
---
Also, only absolute losers try to claim they're flair baiting when something doesn't go their way. I have no words for the level of sad insecurity you'd have to reach to claim flair bait for your coalition mate.
---
I know what you mean but from my point of view it's a game and I want to be able to pick it up and put it away whenever I like.  I can do that with current setup.  I don't have to worry about making the rent or making the plex.  
---
I can also learn from real experts, e.g. in the use of caps, supers and titans (Jay et al), from really good mainline subcap FCs (hello Apple\_Pear!), etc.  I don't know, I would say it's probably better to have been a bloc line member and then go off on your own, than to start that way without having absorbed all the knowledge and institutional experience the big blocs have.
---
All loot to Perunga
---
Everyone in Eve knew Panfam would form, and about what they form in that time zone.
---
So yeah. I guess learn the game better
---
Thank you for the AAR. Good to hear the other side of the REEEEEEE. You are 100% correct.
---
Nice site, just ordered 2 t-shirts for 55€ including shipping to Denmark...
---
Sell your body to your Sugar Daddy!
---
I can concur with this as it's how I've been doing it. Capture one or two plexes first and then start getting more books about the fights you take. Eventually you will end up really wanting to lose your ship in a fight and taking anything that warps in.
---
make more sense with the related link now. thank you
---
Use 1-2 neuts + 2 webs, they completely disable a frigate.

All I see is that one side was too cowardly to field phoenixes and the other side wasn't.

Nothing todo with drones anymore, but i remember badfellas merging directly into bots instead of a spearate milita alliance. That's *probably* who the CTAs are for, if i had to guess.
---
Gf. I didn’t realize until reading the br that I outnumbered you by nearly 200. About that muninn fleet.
---
If you don’t blob elo I promise no batphone alright
---
wow, who would've thought it would be fixed only after the reddit thread and not the feedback posts on the official forums :thinking:
---
Still safespots in highsec. They should delete those “missions“ alltogether.
---
Killboards show your playstyle and to a degree your attitude towards loss.
---
If you value your killboard, it matters. If you don't, it doesn't. If you have stupid losses on it, expect to be asked why they are there - proabably by people with a different attitude than you have.

There is no general black-and-white "factually correct" answer.

You can't hit 5 mil SP with indie skills, hell you don't even hit 1 mil unless you also count hauling as being indie in which case tanking a hauler for hauling missions might fill up 1m
---
Maximum whore gun setup engaged.

That's not really that rich at all lol, but I run combat sites farming faction spawns and escalations.

I’ve had others who didn’t do it right before concord got there. Some ppl don’t have all the skills or timing.
---
Paco are you telling me that MCAV doesn't care if you talk in local?! Never liked the no talking in local rule in jspace. I also know kspace sigs (that I've never joined because of it) that wouldn't let you in unless you agree to no talking in local or would kick you if you did.
---
Yeah ouch, all I lost was a VNI fit with a bunch of Corelum C-type modules.
---
was no point on yours either :)
---
It most definitely is not. However this is a chill place for chill posters to discuss the finer points. We’re all cool folks here my man.
---
Hi O/
---
 Your level of stupidity is too high for me to talk to you .
---
And the spiky asciii is translated only if you have corpses in your hold.
---
There are a few spies here you should study.
---
Example, u/stainguy is obviously a spy for the sanshas and wants them to access HS more easily.
---
Same, Themitany is obviously a Gobbin's alt and reciprocally. 
---
Nothing specific to be warry of, just remember it's a game.
---
OK so now, why is there spies ? Because if someone does not delegate when its corporation grows, he will eventually burn out. Delegating is the big thing in Eve.
---
people who can't pull off suicide ganking in highsec probably lack a pair of chromosomes
---
Learn to question WHY instead of focusing on what or how. Figure out what they want and how they could achieve it, then focus on why they want it and why it’s in their best interests. 
---
Once you understand the WHY its much easier to manipulate the person in question and be ahead of them.
---
Its the same with anything, until you make it a very visible problem it can be safely ignored in favour of other stuff.
---
I mean they openly ignore sisi reports and just push the thing to TQ until enough people scream.
---
Unless it isn't. But until you can easily spot the difference, assume its a scam.
---
&gt; It most definitely is not.

The speed of an orthrus is the issue for someone who isn't experienced. Keeping proper kite range is easy to screw up and the orth tank offers little wiggle room for mistakes.

There is not much benefit to having a "good" safe-spot in high-sec in the age of citadels.
---
The main use-case I've seen people use these for are for getting their bridgers safe, and moving capitals.
---
If you do FW missions properly you can easily make 1bil/hour with an ishtar and 1-2 puller toons, granted it's seasonal as you're somewhat reliant on FW tiers, but farmers that know what they're doing have puller alts on both sides. It's genuinely one of the best ways to make isk relative to the initial investment and the time it takes to get it, you just gotta have a decent setup and know how to do it.

I just realized yesterday after a roughly 9month break I've been "playing" Eve for around 3 years. I thought I was big time when I first started carrier ratting....got bored so I started dropping it on all the things...now I'm training into a rorq. I'll probably mine space rocks until I break even then bore myself into quitting again. So here's me signing out ahead of time...
---
Had fun eve. Good times and bad...(insert more useless garbagehere)
---
Insignificant Signing out
---
Dont lose a grip on reality
---
It really is amazing how obvious these guys are about it too.  I mean, they don't even attempt to look like real players.
---
I started at like 12, it's definitely taught me alot of useful things, especially how to deal with people and helped develop alot of organisational/leadership skills that I wouldn't have learnt otherwise.
---
Granted I woulda liked a social life but meh, cant have everything /shrug
---
With FW it is simply lvl4 fw missions, I ran two hecates and just stomped a full batch of missions in two hours including pick up time in my Dramiel. 
---
At the time Gal was tier 4/5 most days so I was making bank.
---
I swapped to two heavy missile loki and had by other char in a Recon who'd camp the warp in so I could kill hunters while I did missions. 
---
Though Gal is tier 1 now so I am just running burners to fund my PvP.
---
What's going to happen is that the big groups are going to drop 100 Titans on the NPCs and just kill them, the small group can't pull that many resources and get evicted by NPC's.
---
Actually, it isn't their production and stuff that worries me...
---
It is the fact they are doing a lot of small group combat and winning against superior numbers.  Goons have gone from being all shit-tier and throwing ships at stuff, to having a really solid core of PVP pilots with a heavy industry backbone.
---
They are much scarier then I think people are giving them credit for.
---
"operating"
---
It’s not about repair it’s about docking up to change ships and if it’s repaired or not even if you did t shoot just overheated and turned off again you were stuck
---
Until you have a bunch of kill marks. Then the loss hurts.
---
Abyssal Running and a Hauler
---
When you do get blown up flying around, we all do. Try to convo the guy or guys that killed you and ask what happened and how you could improve. Most of the time they will talk you through and maybe give you some good advice.
---
They are going with full speed into concrete wall
---
I think they thought it would make running transport missions too passive. That's probably a very outdated concern.
---
You've scrolled through your own post history, right?

I have actually yet to play that one, I sunk too much money into X-wing haha.  
---
It looks awesome, and yeah, unless you limited the combat to a particular class of ships (frigs and dessies maybe) Armada would work way better.
---
I don't believe that this is a great mechanic to keep around, it heavily favors one side and attackers will almost never be able to gank someone inside these safe spots.

Don't buy isk, don't get caught botting, don't threaten to cut people's hands off, and don't break the NDA. Everything else is fair game.

  Probably 2 machariel or 1 Mach 1 gila or 2×T3 like tengu or loki or 1 Mach 1 noctis it really is up to you I only mentioned mach more cuz it warps and moves faster so people lean toward it more but alot of other battleships are viable,I personally use a leshak for example

The problem is if it’s something small enough that a medium sized alliance can still be able to keep their space without losing it to rats, which I think is something everyone agrees should be possible, then it small enough that NCPL/Imperium can farm it with Titans

Yes, I've never created an EVE account per-se, I've downloaded the client directly from steam and already downloaded the starter pack into my steam account too. The launcher I have in my desktop is a shortcut to the library. But when this steam launcher opens it brings up the credentials screen, I click on the green steam login button, and it just keeps asking me to login with steam and giving me that message.

Yep, bring back Quant .... and actually the F**k listen to what he says

about one and half year ago i started playing eve. 4 days after starting, i found my first coorperation. and i stayed with them till this week. i'm super thankful for the previous time, and for giving me a place where i can learn the basic mechanics of the game. on thuesday i left this group, cause they can't help me going further. but, i already found a new group of people, who are as crazy as me. and i'm super happy to be with them.
---
indeed, they look way better now.
---
left my current corp which was lot of fun to be with but sadly i'm not enjoy much the whaling anymore and i'm going to slow down on my eve activity so i moved back to low sec and found a corp that seems like chilling and fights.

I would ask the following: One of the biggest real estate EVE has is Planets, so far in EVE the only connection to Planets is PI, is there any thoughts on expanding into planets more?  I.E. Landing on Planets, Walking in Stations, Be able to attack other's PI installations from the ground.. etc
---
Why is it always TAPI alone versus the whole universe?
---
Players should be doing those things, not NPCs. If players aren't doing them then obviously the current game mechanics are not making them worth doing. 
---
I think it's a really short sighted road to go down, inventing new NPCs that act like players instead of focusing on making nullsec PVP better than it is now. *Especially* for all those smaller groups who used to cause trouble all over null without being on someone's leash. That's exactly what you're talking about with these NPCs, except it was actual players having fun together.

My problem with that is that you either have to switch between clearing out all of nullsec that isn’t under the direct protection of a large super umbrella, and worsening the problem of all null space being held my mega coalitions, or making it small enough that a medium sized alliance has a chance to hold space on their own, and then the giant alliances just farm the attacks with supers/titans
---
&gt; h offcourse makes jounong most bigger alliances a problem. A commenly used work around is using a csm member as vouch so non off that
---
Yeah, I thought it was weird when he said he thought 16 was too young. I was much older when I started playing eve back in 2006 (29); however, I definitely played with a number of people back then who were around 15 or 16--and who I know still play.

it's less "propaganda" and more the idea that it's just a different name for the same shit and everyone will remember the biggest and more famous name instead of specifying lawn cosplayers #15 thru 30 individually.

I do wish there more deadspace zones in nullsec that were available on the overview that you could warp to. Could be used to help separate groups or keep the less honest from cyno'ing stuff in during the middle of a fight (could still warp in). Basically would be like a large FW plex in random nullsec systems. Would be nice to have more "terrain" to utilize while roaming.
---
YOUR NOT MY DAD!
---
I love these - I think it was the first fit I got a few solo kills with back in the day. Also I don’t think I’ve seen someone who loves the dual web fits quite like you do haha
---
Contact support, I had to
---
Well I've never played Xwing myself, but key differences with SW Armada include longer games (approx 2,5 per 400 pts game, usually) and a somewhat more strategic approach. Definitely check it out if that's your thing, it's a very good game.
---
Give the NPC invaders the ability to dynamically respond to aggressors they same way literally every null entity does. N+25 blob drops.
---
Even on a citadel, if you are waiting to bridge directly into combat and someone bumps the Titan in the wrong direction, the Titan can bump a large portion of the fleet out of bridge range, which can really fuck up an op.
---
FW sites, FW missions, and L5 missions are the common ones. I've also had a great time running DED sites and besieged sites, especially with PVP ships such as marauders.
---
Horde is more unfucked than the rest of ncpl
---
Trigs just want goodfites.  Let them choose a region at random and go off wrecking the place up one side and down the other.  If the locals can defend themselves, the Trigs give GFs in local, then move on to the next region.
---
Autopilot is fine in high sec if you're not carrying anything expensive
---
3/10s escalate from &lt;Faction&gt; Hideaway and &lt;Faction&gt; Refuge anomalies, just run as many of those as you can and you'll get some. 4/10s only exist as signatures that need to be scanned.
---
Br.inyourspace is broken for big fights, at the same timeframe hours later than the fight, it gives a total loss of 85b when it is like 300b
---
As you've said, motivational strands are everything. Spend some time in an area, get to know people, be helpful but not too helpful. 
---
Work out what people are trying to achieve and see how you can help them. Any information is good information. 
---
But then, work out your goal. Spying is fine but to what end. You might choose to find a network of informants and information THEN decide what to do with it. Pick targets then approach middle men, never leaders. Leaders rarely turn. But then, this is Eve...
---
Nope its permanent and they be looking for fun!!!!
---
Most missions are about hitting structures, and you still volley or two-shot frigates with all IV skills and two omnis. The bottleneck of carrier missionning is warp speed and had never been DPS or application.
---
Or just create your instadock bookmark on the far side of the station, no gankers there.
---
auto pilot takes forever and leaves you to be killed, it is probably safer to autopilot in null...
---
Hey that’s only for the elite, print screen might lag out the other 20 characters.
---
Been there, done that, and it's by far the best effort/isk activity in the game. Not time efficient compared to most activities, but your APM is 10 to 100x lower than anything else. Except mining maybe.
---
there needs to be something to tax in order for taxes to bring income, the vast majority of lowsec non industrial moneymaking is based on LP payouts from missions and not bounties, you can't tax lp payouts, not automatically at least.
---
&gt; still smugs on reddit 🤣
---
FRT adopts TAPI habits.  TAPI wins cultural victory.
---
&gt;A content driver
---
Very few people consider 50 f1 blob high tidi citadel bashes for the sake of a single system to be "fun content", so that's right out.
---
With your shit about timers I can only assume you've never actually had to bash anything in a system with a half decent amount of structures.
---
The fact that you don't see a problem in nullsec only further illustrates the fact that you are almost definitely an irrelevant hisec retard without a single clue what shit he's spewing. Anchoring a citadel is very little input, the 1 day anchor time doesn't matter if it's your home space, and the "cost" is irrelevant to most groups that have sov worth defending like that. Tell me, have you ever been to 1DQ?
---
You don't "need" to fit your throwaway astras/forts because they exist to make your system cancer to take over and you'll already have large fleets up to defend it. If you do fit it you probably end up putting on 1 or 2 mods to make it more irritating and that's it. Bashing shitadels for weeks will drain morale a lot, and it's not engaging content (and I don't see any excuse for CCP to be creating dull, unengaging PVP content, do you?), so think about doing it on a larger scale and you've got one hell of a way to burn out an alliance.
---
There is literally nothing about citadels you can compare to poses. Every mechanic is different, even reinforcement, and they give far less loot while not having the limitation (1 per moon) that POSes had. Fuck out of here with your uninformed bullshit.
---
Thank Bob for this thread, I was wondering something.
---
I have an omega and alpha clone and was thinking about huffing gas in a wormhole by using my alpha as a miasmos pilot whom would fly in and log off on a pre determined safe spot and using my omega with a cheap venture fit to huff the gas. Is this a viable start or would you guys recommend I do it some other way
---
I have a jump clone in high sec doing lvl 4 burner missions. When my wallet gets low I’ll jump over there, pop a potency 50 booster &amp; decline every non burner mission (&amp; some of the worse burner missions). It is not the best money, I make around 200-250 mil per hour, but it can be done semi afk &amp; is basically riskless
---
[Stick to the script mate, TAPI fought alone against FRT, PL, NC, Horde, V0lta](https://i.imgur.com/e05Pqup.jpg)
---
Because maybe they were talking about Rorqs and a NM fleet ambushed by bombers has fuck all to do with the conversation.
---
  We'd be homeless, and we'd probably end up joining Goons. 
---
Joining Goons because you're poor made me laugh. Thanks.
---
Dude I love Polarized weapons.  They be like whoop whoop. One might say they are my Gospel.
---
addendum: if you can't afford to buy it twice, you can't afford it
---
I’m making 200-250 mil per hour in high sec doing burner missions. It’s not the best money but it is semi afk, very safe &amp; you only need 1 pilot
---
Pal Dave brought it up not me. I was asking why he dodged the question.
---
Let’s see. It’s not a detriment to chasing people, because if you’re on one gate and they leave local without showing up on dscan, you now know they left to a gate more than 14 au away. 
---
It’s also not a detriment to exploration, without local I’d probably either stop or just carry a ton of depots around and then pick up all loot with a ceptor, which would just be cancer. But it’s better than dying to every cloaked stealth bomber with a cyno. I suppose we can restrict exploration in hostile space to people with t3cs trained, because that’s basically what removing local would do. 
---
Or non-afk ratting, all the dscan in the world won’t tell you if that ceptor you see is a friendly traveling or an enemy scout. Or if there’s a covops Loki incoming. I don’t really rat anymore anyway, but removing local would effectively end all ratting not under an umbrella. 
---
It just seems like people who want to remove local haven’t been in a position where they need to rat in a subcap or explore in an astero/covops, or really do anything even somewhat risky to make isk, and instead just bitch about not being able to get free kills.
---
I find its best not to think about. Thankfully, I did not sink nearly as much money into it as some. Although I gotta give it to them, brilliant marketing, they maintain development while slowly making you forget about it!
---
I once tried to afk rat with FOF missiles. It was not as effective as one might believe. But I do love blood transfusions.
---
but he lost his rorq so he has to unleash his salt
---
Speaking of careers. How is yours going preaching the word? Have you eaten any good food lately? So jealous of you current experience right. Now. Keep up the work brother.
---
Oh your poor poor dps...  Ham and prop mod surely
---
Yeah they can :wink:
---
Lots of posts, and people missed a key one:
---
Bigger is not always better.
---
Maybe you could make local only work if you have an early warning structure which could be jammed allowing an incursion into that system without warning. Maybe give recon cruisers a bonus to allow a single ship to jam the structure or possibly black ops ships?
---
Nah bud. You spend half the time trying to get in range with HAMs. Heavies are way easier.
---
I went and got a job irl and just buy PLEX
---
The economy grew by almost a trillion isk per day in march
---
This is actually pretty accurate.  Another thing to note is that the best spies aren't in it for glory.  Ties into edit1 and motivations. 
---
If you've got a spy who is desperate to be noticed for the shady stuff they do, they're already unreliable; they're looking for big ticket stuff like how they can kill a titan rather than slowly gaining info that feels like it's useless, but forms part of the picture.
---
Not really a story but this is hall of fame level tears from the catch eviction at the hands of PL

3/10 - cosmic signature or escalation from "faction" refuge sites. Refuge sites are pretty much everywhere in high sec, just grind them until you get 3/10 escalations
---
4/10 - only cosmic signature. You will need to scan them down, lot's of people doing/searching for them.
---
3/10, 4/10, 5/10 escalations i've always done them in a navy cruiser, VNI mostly. It's the poor man choice for PVE and never let you down. If you die, it's under 100m....
---
To be fair, it doesn't so much create a massive advantage for the roamers as remove a massive advantage for the people in their own space. You too have basically invulnerable safespots in your sov: it's called tether.
---
rat in null
---
you missed out on the golden years of rorqual mining for one.
---
ships/caps are still dirt cheap 
---
T3's can swap rigs without destroying and you need one less module to assemble a T3
---
all the major alliances can loose trillions of isk without even noticing it these days. Making isk/mining is just too easy
---
You really can do everything you need to on one account. Most advice given is pretty bad advice or for those that want really scalable AFK income. This, the general advice is "just have ten VNIs".
---
You can make a decent living blitzing L4 burners on a single account. Granted, it will take you a bit of time to grind up the ISK for each of the burner ships, but in the meantime you can easily blitz L4 missions in a Machariel. Using the same skills, you can get a starter Machariel for incursions, and travel arouubd running those if you need sone liquid isk fast.
---
You can also run Tier 3 and Tier 4 Abyssal sites. Train for a Cerberus for T4 blitzing, and use an Osprey Navy in the meantime to run Tier 3s. Cheap ship, high return.
---
You can also join FW and run missions. This will eventually lock you out of some empire space (For example, if you join CalMil, you'll be locked out of Gallente space eventually).
---
What dps do u get outa heavies, hams are around 900 I think?  (my tengus under a dust sheet)
---
I was getting around 800 with really good skills and decent implants. Like the applied dps of heavies out weighs the paper dps of hams.
---
Or if it's Amarr. There's actually a local community there
---
Congratulations, rich/high SP groups farm the waves with Marauder's/Pirate Battleships to game whatever algorithm CCP uses, poor/low SP groups that can't afford bling hulls/bling mods get to eat a shit.
---
You can tell people to kill themself at fanfest though
---
Funny thing happen when an enemy titan gets bubbled in jump range of 08, even for just a couple seconds.
---
Oooo, shiny! 
---
*digs out old eft warrior hat.... 
---
...wonder if the drake n nighthawk actually have dps now?
---
Pb about to get hunted haha
---
Drake kind of does. But the nighthawk is still pretty lack luster. I actually have my tengu fit hold on.
---
It truly is a renters market in Period Basis! This is a deal of a lifetime!
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75258911/ 
---
This was travel fit obviously but if you look at the cargo that’s what I used to switch. I was killing serp rats.
---
TBH, drawing out the 100 titan flights is kinda the point. Make the defenses strong enough that a flight of 100 titan is even. But give some kind of rewards to make it so that it's worth the bigger guys trying to defend the smaller guys (make them ever expanding so that in theory they could start spilling into lo-sec or something).
---
Not saying I have all the answers, but I think that some king of Trig War could be a good long term event.
---
Imagine everyone just having highsec alts to run missions/incursions again because the risk/reward is trash.
---
Script? Legacy vs Winter, only one side has used the batphone for outside help so far but you know that already.
---
&gt;Props to the guys who know how to pull it off
---
Um, you press F1?
---
Hideaway will escalate to 3/10s as well but less often than Refuge.
---
This tuesday update is great. (✿◕‿◕)
---
I love the look of my ships in station. (✿◠‿◠)
---
I miss CPP Falcon's face on the launcher. (◡‿◡✿)
---
Au contraire mon Ami, I believe PL has an excellent knowledge and track record when it comes to dying alliances :joy:
---
I liked to fly lower cost frigates, and dessies, and run a couple plexes before looking for a fight more aggressively.  If someone slid into you then you got a fight without having to go hunting for one, and if you didn't, you got lost to replace your ship if you lose it.  Between that and picking up loot from the occasional win, or other people leaving wrecks unlooted, it was enough to keep me going in pretty low cost ships.bn
---
* Don't spend too much time in Highsec. Try to get into Nullsec, or Lowsec with a group as soon as you're able to. Noob friendly, and people who can teach you is actually recommended.
---
* Don't be discouraged. Remember that only you can make your own fun, and sharing it with other people might not make it fun for them. Is killing other ships fun? Like to make things? Both of these require plans and understanding of the mechanics. Planning/prepping/learning is the 80% and fun is the 20%. For the 20%, getting the shakes in combat is a thrill, nothing like it in any other game.
---
* Learning Frigates are the best ship in the game, and that Titans are not a goal worth having. They are the shackles of a players old age and these players should be treated kindly for they are cynical and jaded as fuck. They can also move you instantly into combat if you ask them nicely.
---
* Quit EvE when you've had your fill, but remember to keep your skill queue maxed, and your valuables in highsec.
---
Upvote.  How do you find the time for such great advice. I mean just wow!!!!. Has anyone told you that they think you are just amazing.  I am truly becoming your number 1 fan. I might even open a fan website on the indomitable Cactus Jack!!!
---
&gt;But give some kind of rewards to make it so that it's worth the bigger guys trying to defend the smaller guys 
---
Congratulations you've turned the smaller alliance into pets. Smaller alliances had some resemblance of Independence because there isn't excessive pressure on their space. If you add NPC pressure too high for them to handle and have to batphone a blob whenever the trigs come knocking, you turn them pets. They are dead without that batphone, which requires them to kiss a lot of ass, and the blobs know this so they can extract more concessions from their position of power.
---
Trust me once satisfied you're never more ready to testify.
---
Nice choice of music
---
If you want your own safe space in sovereign space, anchor a POS or drop a structure, using cheesy game mechanics to blops around without being able to get dropped/ganked is pretty poor.
---
is there a way to watch it without selling your firstborn to the Chinese nsa

To get hunted in the north under a landlord that doesn't care, while paying a ton of rent.
---
Or

To get hunted in the south under a landlord that doesn't care for other than their own structures there and paying little to nothing rent.
---
Choises choises
---
Please do. I'd love to get me some shiny blops kills.
---
There is a place where you have the terrain like that in every system: it’s called faction warfare. It only generates good fights in null for you because people don’t know about it. Not because it’s a good mechanic. same for event sites. It just had the flavour of the opportunity knowledge of a few vs the ignorance of the blob. You can’t reasonably argue that every system in eve should have deadspace on demand where you can’t warp and cyno. There is a lot of ways to abuse it including complete impunity for moving capitals. It’s just bad game design. The fact that it allows you to sometimes get good fights is just an accident.
---
u/jibrish is messing with my flair yet I appreciate our local modzis for keeping the subreddit more or less clean while brisc shitstorm was happening ◕‿◕
---
is the 1 bil monthly or a one time payment?
---
FC/Scout gets loot. 
---
If gank scout gets loot. If a fight FC gets loot.
---
BUT THE MITTANI
---
Easy fix is to lock these to newbie systems. Sure you can safe up in Cistuvaert, but why?
---
You?
---
Undocking without a fc?
---
Tell me more
---
"PANFART" is now the new name of their coalition
---
Imagine caring about hisec safespots
---
And then people would just stop following you there like they do in low sec because they’ve learned about it and have nothing to gain from following you there. The main reason it works so well with event sites is that it’s temporary and most people in the standing blob don’t know about it. Don’t misunderstand what I’m saying. I like it and use it but it’s good only because it’s niche and temporary not because it’s a good game mechanic.
---
I too want to lose content up north so the leadership in the south can benefit without passing down said benefits
---
Either sides linemember has to do the dirty work lol
---
Step 1 - Apply to Horde
---
Step 2 - Profit
---
What happened to "mug goon superior master race, rental system is out dated"
---
That 1b a month is going to be a massive benefit!
---
Obviously there's no way this is to deny rental income from the north
---
1) Take a T1 cruiser/BC/BS
---
2) Shit Fit it
---
3) Drop it somewhere in a system
---
4) Cloak ships 150km away from it
---
5) Wait for someone to come a pick it 
---
6) Kill him and shame his KB with a shit fit
---
North losing renters means you lose content.
---
You get that right?
---
North loses renters
---
No income
---
North has to get their own monies
---
They become content
---
You do know who boris is?
---
"lol we can deny rental income from the north" happened.
---
been dead a long time, my friend
---
We a neutral cap ship in our system and killed it. Fittings for the ship that dropped went to the corp. The two ships it dropped from ship hangar (fully fitted golem and rattlesnake) went to our scout
---
How are you arguing with thus .
---
THE NORTH IS ALREADY YOUR CONTENT, YOU HAVE A NET LOSS OF CONTENT IF THE RENTERS SWITCH OVER
---
&gt; Don't listen to Reddit
---
This sounds really jaded. 99% of comments I see in response to a newbie asking questions are always genuinely helpful (albeit sometimes a little misinformed). The bittervets usually stay out of these threads, and nobody would really go through the toruble of baiting someone on reddit just to get a Heron kill, although they sometimes might joke about it. 
---
The rest of your comment is solid though.
---
Yes
---
Imagine being upset about the north getting fucked.
---
I'm not entirely sure he knows very much at all, really
---
Imagine knowing how some other random guy on the Internet feels
---
A large majority of my fights have been in large FW plex. People will come if they want to fight.
---
If they just want to gank or immediately cyno 5 titans to kill a cruiser, then they wont follow and i didnt want to fight them anyway.
---
End result is, if people want you out of their space/system, eventually theyll need to put their big boy pants on and warp-in. Otherwise ill just setup base there and continue harassing them as opportunity arises. It creates terrain and some more interesting ways to fight people. Its not like its a necessay way to fight, but can help break up blobs or separate the fighters from the lazy.
---
Direct democracy would be voting on the specific issues. This seems more like the standard broken representative democracy. Of course it doesnt matter since the problem is CCP.
---
&gt;so the rights of minorities are protected from the majority.
---
More like the minority staying in power and not giving much of a fuck about the majority.
---
Fucking someone twice is more fun than fucking someone once.
---
If you're flying blind into this game and want someone to assist you for a few hours let me know. I find helping newbies more satisfying than actually playing the game nowadays.

All r/eve posters feel like neckbeards in a basement.

Want to give a shout out to Fleelo Knight for his great achievement of running around for over an hour trying to avoid getting caught. Next time, grow some balls. If you cant find them for some reason ask you wife of you can borrow them from the jar she stores the small things in.
---
I disagree. I can't wait to vonhole all the shiny blops people will be dropping on complex runners down there.
---
For hisec exploration Get yourself into a dual rep amarr stratigeic destroyer, add a probe launcher and run every anom you get. Its strong enough to run every anom and 1-3 ded, its able to also complete ded4 Sancha and Serpentis, and blood, but not guristas. I havent tried Angels in it. Thats the best hisec explorer at the moment. 5/10 can also be found in hisec, but the difficulty levels are off for what they are, 6/10 can be run in most t3c/ishtar but 5/10 serpentis/sansha/blood will kill those same fits.
---
You literally changed goal posts lmao
---
Here's the obligatory statement of how stupid your idea is. Here's an equally dumb idea. Make all of high sec sec. Status depending on the number of ganks in a 24 hour moving average. Dec status can range from 0.1 to 1.0
---
I don't even own a basement
---
Correct
---
Never said it was you paying the rent
---
Never trust someone you just met, ignore chat in jita, and never make a bet with a Sicilian when death is on the line.
---
Imagine actually believing content will get fucked because the north is getting hit again.
---
No one is saying that we didn't blob them but don't spin shit and say that test doesn't fight outnumbered.
---
Just because you have a lot of apples doesn't mean that when i take an apple away you have the same amount of original apples
---
You have the pvp acumen of a 2 day old hordeling
---
How about instead of just going "that won't work", you make actual productive suggestions? Because you're at 2-for-2 on unproductive vs my 2, admittedly not great, but at least genuine attempts to come up with an idea.
---
Narrative is important business
---
Trying to do this on your own is a fool's errand. Yeah sure there are tangible skills that would make you more effective, but what's most critical is the organizational infrastructure around your espionage and, indeed, your alliance/coalition as a whole that makes you effective. Think about probably the most famous example of "espionage" in this game: DisBand of Brothers. There wasn't anything particularly complicated or skillful by The Mittani or the directors (i forget which corp Haargoth joined - it wasn't goonfleet) that made that possible. The single biggest factor was the culture around goonswarm at the time. That's what appealed to Haargoth (I'm paraphrasing his own words - the chat logs of him saying this are out there) and that gave The Mittani an incredible lever by which to pressure him into disbanding BoB. I don't think any amount of ~spycrafting~ would have lead to the outcome that happened were it not for the organizational structure. You can see this again in the recent northern war, where Black Hand is flipping GotG members left and right by promising to get them out of the toxic alliance and giving them a home in Delve. The point of all those words is to hopefully illustrate that you should be starting this conversation with whoever runs your spying organization and understanding what advantages and disadvantaged that organization presents to you as a would-be-spy. So, the tl;dr is this:
---
Go talk to whoever runs your spy organization in the alliance/coalition you are in now. If they rebuff you because they think YOU are spying on THEM, then you misjudged your relationship with them and you probably just don't have very good spying instincts anyway.
---
Or they can just have a super cloaked 300km off and there is literally nothing you can do about it. Just because you can use it at your advantage to get good fights doesn’t mean it’s a good mechanic to create good fights. It also has a lot of broken aspects. Saying that it should be everywhere in null because it creates fights in faction warfare also doesn’t work because it’s completely different people that are there for a complete different purpose. You seem to be completely blind to the fact that it provides completely unreasonable safety not only for the people that want the good fights but also for the people that bait and blobs themselves. Try to think outside of your niche. Doesn’t take a genius to see how this can be bad.
---
That is an advanced start and a fine plan. If your pilots are both in the same corp you can drop shared corp bookmarks to make navigation easier. You'll be able to huff for a few minutes in each site before the sleepers show up and chase you off.
---
Keep the drama in the game.  Don't bring this nonsense to RL.
---
But I have plenty of apples and don't really mind losing one shitty apple. Helps that you can also just... grow more apples.
---
Yeah, that way you can be outnumbered and out shipped by Lazerhawks instead of nullbears.
---
I'm no familiar how other alliances handle their shit, but the benefits you get as an Imperium line member are pretty solid tbh.
---
For a bunch of assholes, we are actually very friendly!
---
Imagine being this retarded but thinking other people who actually pvp don't know shit.
---
There are less and less apples everyday because the planet is dying because of Icelandic global warming
---
When you only have a few apples left, you will be sad cus you so easily let others take your apples when you had loads.
---
Tell me more about how being a goon drone is a solid deal
---
lol wait, is the argument here "Legacy doesn't count?" 
---
116 vs 76 is still awful...
---
Ouch.
---
&gt; And those ships were replaced pretty quick
---
&gt;Implying there's actually someone in your chain
---
\*eagerly stages blops in Stain\*
---
My apples are in fact completely fine. Just because you're shit and your apples have worms in them doesn't mean everybody else is having issues making their apples sustainable.
---
New update is awesome. Just one little thing brothers me, can someone turn on station's light. I will pay electric fee, plz.
---
Just tackle the super...
---
The pvp gate doesn't appear at all unless there's a certain number of people running abyss sites at that time.
---
Just bait them?
---
I support this, already killed a few dumb people in PB when rolling into the area - feel free to get more so it's actually a decent place to get fights
---
Get rid of all the bots, though, ty
---
Oh, that’s why I often don’t see any when running T3 filaments. I guess that’s because I’m in a bad tz.
---
i used an old account to try "doubling isk" in jita, but found out it was a lot more fun to just chat. i ended up making 200mil just from making people laugh with messages like "selling one nothing for 100mil, buy fast".
---
I always thought it'd be great if local pirate factions started reinforce, kill and replace structures in systems with very low activity. Even take over sov and spawn like they do on sotyos, with some tweaks, when you go on the counter offense. Systems with high activity multipliers should be safe.
---
Ayyyy
---
I'm in TEST and in their citadel bashing groups. so i know pretty much about the stuff you say i don't...
---
and if you say a 50F1 monkey fleet has tidi, you should just go behind your rock again
---
I was there when the group in Tenerifis (can't remember the name) got killed and exterminated, even though they had more than 30 forts in their home system etc
---
I am regularly in battles against rogue azbels in perimeter etc. 
---
Honestly, you have no fucking idea how the war actually changed with structures, if you state that everything is bad.
---
What about the Jove empire? they need love too!
---
Again then start a war. We’re fighting. Don’t bitch at us.
---
vOv then push your dudes to a war or shut up.
---
F1 monkey fleets between large alliances are going to have tidi if they're fighting over anything remotely important. Shitadel mechanics do not make for engaging content and need changing. Asset safety removal at least in null and another timer rework would be nice, but at the very least a limit on the number in each system. But I wouldn't expect a dinobrain to understand why dull content is bad for the game.
---
Sure.
---
The main thing is to nail down the purpose of adding this, so you can design towards a goal. Is the propose to add content to null, is the purpose to make life harder for boots? Is the purpose just fuck with nullsec.

If the purpose is to "spice up nullsec" then the intrusion needs to have balanced targeting so everyone gets to have some without having to fly halfway around the cluster. It would basically be incursions on roids, with tougher enemies and perhaps a larger segment of the region targeted. Dynamic spawns are ok, but it should be balanced so that a medium size group can clear it without help in economical ships (T1 Battleships with T2 login), and have some easier spawns for new players to help in.
---
If the goal is to combat botting, then the trig invasion should be permernant, with increasing spawn rates depending on region utilization (time one adjusted mining, ratting). Trig fleets simply spawn on miners and ratters proportional to the ship they target, but also escalates depending on how many ships show up. They essentially act as NPC ratter hunters, but with a longer grace time between initial tackle and DPS rats spawning as to give people a chance to react. If you are active and at keyboard, trig spawns might not be immediately fight able, but there should be enough delay for corpmates to show up and help, with the max trig spawns determined by the initial ship targeted (ex, a spawns. On a VNI will cap out at a handful, whereas a spawn on a rorq/super/titan will have a much higher cap). Botters are plain fucked, as the trigs will spawn and tackle immediately, and since bots don't show up help each other, they just die. Players with an active alliance can call for help, and the rescuers are well awarded by NOC drops if they fight off the gank fleet.
---
If the goal is to just fuck with nullsec and force people to move, then the trigs just spawn in unreasonable amount of ships and wipe out a player held constellation and force the players to migrate. However, I don't think that's a position CCP actually wants. It also really sucks on the receiving end to just lose everything randomly.
---
Good question
---
That's a great deal. Who may I purchase a nothing from?
---
In the current meta there is nothing to gain from invading
---
I didnt say everywhere. Not every system would have one. There are already "lore" beacons in random nullsec systems. Those could be turned into deadspace.
---
Youre also using a strawman by assuming "every single one" would have a super in it because youre assuming i meant every nullsec system. I said it would be nice to have more "terrain" in space. Which means on a 20j roam, i might run into a system or 2 with this feature. Lure a fight away or get stuck in system and fight around the beacon or gates. Doesnt really matter or even if its used everytime. But at least its an option.
---
Are you really distressed about 1-5 guys being in a beacon and calling it unreasonable safety, when nullblocks have 20+ jump bridges for instant moving (protected by citadels to boot), super umbrellas, ESS in full spawned anoms or drifter observatories, and intel bots (sorry near2)?
---
Maybe not a genius, but it does take actual conversational skills to list all the "bad ideas" that you havent mentioned other than purse clutching.
---
No one did....but stop crying about "been outnumbered" when you guys do the same shit over and over....

I'm waiting to come back to Eve.  Been gone about a year due to a big move but I've got the itch bad.  I miss doing exploration what I will do beyond that I don't know.

National Security Advisor obviously.

Problem is when you don't know what is a good tank

Rest of Eve vs Most of Eve

You just literally said that test doesn't fight outnumbered on a post where we were outnumbered. What is hard to understand. Stop being a fucking tool.

One time payment as far as I'm aware.

SRP actually gets paid.
---
john battmann is the account i used, but you don't need to buy anything.

I mean it only took me a few days of reading and a few months of trial and error to figure out what makes a good tank. New players should stop slacking. /s

Wow gj CCP. [Who'da thunk it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b84kez/exploit_notification_use_of_ess_in_seeker/ejwhddo/?context=3)

that's a nullkrab post right there
---
Get a t1 industrial, slap a cloak on it and go to any heavily ganked area. Proceed to steal the loot of the gankers. Enjoy loot and prime salt.
---
I too can't replace feroxes and jackdaws
---
I thought neutral logi are now not allowed
---
This is the basic way.
---
I also know a lot of people run industry on alts and the FW toons are the fun ones.
---
Brisc can be innocent, it doesn't change a thing. He wasn't the target. INIT leadership was. Whatever they done = and whoever leaked the info and then framed Brisk, if that is the case - seems solid enough to CCP.
---
You work with what you’ve got, zkill’s is completely useless for anything bigger than a local skirmish, so this is the best option available.
---
Yeah exactly, it's just down to timezones and how many ppl are running that day.
---
Can't upvote this enough
---
"CCP sentenced him to permanently win EVE, the death penalty" is the best line I have seen in one of these.
---
No way.
---
Frankly, I never run large plex offensively solo. I find gank fit catalysts to not be that fun and nothing else really cheap can kill the rat in sensible time solo. Might just be the amarr warzone but it's a great way to get tackled by one of the usual suspect's alt and then killed by some kitey bullshit.
---
It's the only one that will give accurate breakdown and give a halfway decent
---
 "i would like toi get some pve i can acturly do with my skill's and isk."
---
We don't know your skills and ist ;) so nobody here will be able to give you a true answer.
---
But I can give you some general answers. First, if you can run a DED5 in an gila depends on the DED5 (which rats) and your fit. I've run many serpentis DED5 for example. In general you can bring battleships into DED5s so depending on your skills that might be better. But truly, join a corp and work together with other players. It's much easier to run such sites in a team. Also better ask ingame for help. There are help channels.
---
For other escalations try other anomalies. you can find a list of combat anomalies on https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites
---
It was a nearly 300 billion isk fight.  That deserves a thread and aar.

been having bit rough time because my brains are dumbo so i have been escaping into new eden lately (◕‿◕✿)

yesterday i was bit bummed because i died so ez to someone and because im foolish i tend to look at my kb red and get discouraged, but then a corp mate told me that if kb aint red you arent taking enough fights (✿◠‿◠)
---
so i ditched my risk averse playstyle completely for an hour and i managed to get 3 solokills! (✿◠‿◠✿)
---
i was so happy
---
one of them i was shooting some catalyst with my kestrel and got him into hull, then 5 his friends warp in but i managed to kill him off before i got torn apart, it was one of the most fun fights i've had and i'm addicted again (◕‿◕✿)
---
thank u for reading my post
---
i love eve
---
Because a lot of the advice is min-maxers min-maxing to fund 3-4 accounts.
---
You can absolutely do FW l4 with a single account. The "best" way then is to use all 3 slots on your account, 1 for the main and both other toon for pullers, 1 per side. You'll do OK isks. Not 1B per hour but probably 150-200m/h.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

We still have plenty of nightmares both literal and metaphorical

And the dudes chasing you with svipils ;)

I've actually had good fun running them in the past in a VNI (I know, hear me out though). Fit a 100mn AB and a web/scram and medium neuts, and the number of frigs who will try to tackle you and then die horribly is fairly high.

Brcat’s been having tons of issues with the changes to how zkill works so it’s not pulling all kills half the time.
---
I wasn't 100% sure about the t2 ones since I didn't remember any AT ships being t2, but I wasn't able to check.

So yeah, I may have been a little off, but I was still mostly correct.

Aw fuck I put an idiot previously then edited to moron to match the post rip

... wanta wars and isk outta the game... wint make the attempt to do so and asks WHY after stating discontent. My fuckin word.
---
Tackling a super 300km off without being able to warp to it, sure
---
Kind of assumed that's already how they worked lol. I don't pve at all XD
---
Lol you're retarded mate.
---
They could scale depending on the number of structures in the constellation maybe?
---
That's true, super botting really isn't the big problem though, it's the thousands of vnis.
---
To make a Hulk or Mack go pop is one of the best feelings in EVE, especially when the pilot is in the mood to argue about it. Did you get any Michi's pods?

Its really I problem man like an addiction :/

just adapt lol

Check out the nerds downvoting you for not being butthurt. :D
---
What?
---
I said fucking the north by taking their renters is fun.
---
I also said fucking the north after they need to fill the income the renterloss costs them is fun.
---
Yeah.... New Eden has a bit of an inflation problem... I've been [tracking it for a while.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w5mFsjkFNrTSmhh6FnkmnGOBxF7O2Gq7iaQjHCKiO6M/edit?usp=sharing)
---
Ok fuck thats not good, im glad i didnt play active the last week..
---
I can tell you right now. Whoever rents that regin is gonna be raped.
---
I was in small corps since I started playing, its not fun living in fear of n+1 either.
---
Its not 'great' isk, but you can do high sec DEDs in an assault frig, a lot of which can fit a probe launcher for easy - if not great - isk. Downside is competition and active isk generation. 
---
If you get comfortable with this (and bored) try low-sec. With two characters it is very safe. You can even run a cov ops frig with a recon or T3V and be virtually un-catchable if paying attention.

By "dynamically respond", you mean "drop caps on everything"?

Sounds like fun. I can just imagine rats lighting cyno and a rat titan fleet drops in system.
---
You’re talking with comparison to faction warfare and the tutorial trick without any further detail and then you’re surprised I interpret it as in any system. Obviously the main problem of the tutorial trick is that it’s on demand everywhere. Occasional terrain is fine. But you already have a ded sure every other system you can use
---
If you want good reading material, The Art of Deception by Kevin Mitnick will give you a counter Intel side view of the issue. The more you know about the human habits, the easier they are to play like a fiddle.
---
I liked to play a game when I would infiltrate corps where I would try and figure out the quickest path to roles in game or on whatever auth system they had. 
---
Sometimes the easiest way is to just play like a normal person and be helpful, be around and be ready to do shitty jobs like scouting or always dictoring (or whatever the current eve meta is, I don't play anymore)
---
Make "friends" and don't be an asshole (unless you are cutting and running). 
---
Learn how to move isk to your spy alts without setting off alarm bells when someone analyzes the account. 
---
Learn how to identify spies, work HR if you are in a big corp/alliance.
---
This is actually a good idea, would hamper the big renter spaces and small groups would be able to take space for themselves and keep it if they work hard on it..
---
&gt; PVP-ing aint cheap, are those guys do L5's in a carrier, plexing with alts ? What's the most 'standard' way for a FW guy to get his isk for pew pew 
---
There are quite a few ways to do it. For me it was a mix of things. In my LS days I did not live in or near FW so I did not get too heavily into it, only occasional neut roams.
---
For ISK I would do the following:
---
Some explo - this is very RNG in LS, or at least was when I was doing it, for some odd reason I would get weird "spawn bouts" where I would get some ghost sites which are very nice ISK, then nothing, then like 8+ WH spawns per nearby system, so I would hop into them and do some explo there then come back. I just used a Cov Ops T2 explo frig most of the time. 
---
Clone Soldiers - I used to swing by the belts in my resident and nearby systems and do clone soldiers if there were any, pop some rats on occasion to make them spawn. Bonus here is that this also provided me with great way to offset security standing losses from podding players.
---
DED sites - small ones I did by myself, usually in just a T1 or T2 ship, preferably long range sniper fit so I never sit by the gates and always have time to get out or do something when someone warps in on me. Large ones I would do with a corp mate and we'd split the profits, sell everything then go 50/50.
---
Missions - Missions in LS were too RNG for me because too often they would take me into hostile territory out of my "local" range and I did not have an army of puller characters so could not decline too many. If I got the right ones, great, I did them, if not, then I moved on and tried again another day.
---
Can confirm, the problem is you will enjoy the company and culture so much that you end up going native. Which in turn you will have to switch allegiance from your previous employer.

Suggest you start practicing by signing up at easy-to-join alliances with few security checks, Pandemic Horde is recruiting and is World Famous (TM) for training most of the spies in Eve today.

I have just read about a pvp gate into abyssal space in an other thread. Would you be so kind and link me to a wiki or explain how that works to me?

---
Tell me more about apple farming
---
Alphas can’t use Cynos. And idk why I would use one anyway lol
---
It's less that people learnt to deal with the Orthrus, but more that the Orthrus got power creeped out of the meta. They can't 1 clip a post-buff Jaguar, don't have as much ongrid control as a Loki, don't have as much anti-tackle DPS as a Kiki/Dreka, and don't have as much tank as a Dreka/Loki. Orthrus also can't really take RR so you can't really escalate with them either.
---
Interested aswell.
---
Not 1b a month. Just 1b.
---
Is this the new viceroy system?
---
He said he just downloaded it, and you're probably using terms he has no idea about:  "gila" "heron" "buffer" "take the handicap off"  "modules to incentivize careful but risky play."
---
Yes, you can catch up by using skill injectors.
---
But more importantly, in Eve Online, "Skillpoints" doesn't show how good you are in a specific field.
---
You can have 30 million skillpoints in mining and industry.
---
And if my character only have 15 million skillpoints in total, but all in pvp related skills.
---
My character, even though it has less skillpoints then your 30 million mining character, would still be better in pvp.
---
That's why skillpoints isn't a good value to compare characters with. Since it's all about in which skills those skillpoints are invested in.
---
YAY! More blues!
---
Pb is also a bot sanction area, part of the on-boarding process is links to the various programs
---
Has the game changed in a massive way to change training for new players ? Not really.
---
Is the game designed so that new players have a specific role in the game ? Yes.
---
Eve isn't a competitive game. It's a sandbox. It's about enjoying the mechanics and finding something to do you like. It's not a 1v1 game.
---
I love the way CCP is building up whatever-this-is.
---
You won't be once October gets here :)
---
You can be in some of the alliance's doctrine fleet fits in a couple weeks. And you can have lots of fun joining standing fleets and roams in cheap t1 frigs.

When you become a big boy and competently fly a titan knowing it’ll be covered under SRP, get back to us.   Meanwhile, your jackdaw is so cute.

Never is a long time
---
But what I found fascinating about the game was the whole war for null sec and the alliances that controlled that space. When I played I was however always told I wasn't skilled enough to join, is that the same perception that's ruling these days, that you have to have a pretty hardcore character before you can enter null?
---
Not my picture, would have loved to be there though.
---
English?
---
But I guess in any case it takes a lot of time to get to those 15mil?

Another one is Social Engineering: The science of human hacking by Kevin Mitnick.

I too don't mind putting up my own personal funds to go on dull tidi F1 blobs for an alliance that can afford to SRP

Why do i feel that you are talking about afk cloacky camping?
---
You don't have to participate, or even watch. This is just our way of doing something we love to do. No need to disparage it, it doesn't affect you.
---
So then you have something like simple farmers anchor a ton of astras in enemy space, and if they time it right and the enemy doesn’t bash them all in time, suddenly a giant npc attack spawns?
---

Says the one bitching about not enough isk in game dying, you want something but wont act in it. Start a war like countless others instead of begging ccp to remove others accomplishments that for some took the better part of 2 decades.
---
wtb gate 0m bookmarks
---
wait was trading bookmarks possible back then?
---
a super cheap industrial structure shouldn't be able to kill a dread.
---
When you choose to enter that gate, you're warped to a 1v1 arena with a single loot box. You are randomly pitted against another player in a fight to the death. To the victor goes the spoils.

If they are so dull then why do you go on them?

You're right, losing a 226 v 76 that badly is not in the slightest bit embarrassing or noteworthy

NOTHING TO SEE HERE MOVE ALONG
---
Of they have rock solid proof simply stating that fact would stop this shitshow, and be 100% safe.
---
Imagine not being able to replace your titan u drop on frigates.
---
Where did I say I do? By this logic I suppose you can't afford to replace feroxes and jackdaws?
---
Nah feroxes will bankrupt me, maybe when Jack's go down in price, fucking srp policy is so cheap.

I'm certain that we have, and our pitchforks got in the way of reason.

Elon's OverPropped 22MN Frigate fit
---
Yeah, i dont know why they have done it this way either. One could even argue whar niche it could even fit
---
C6 bastion solo with barghest. Yeah, it takes 1hr but still doable.
---
You can get 60,000 a day, but you can be a badass frig pilot at 3 or 4 million.
---
Its still worth getting into if its interesting to you, fuck i joined in 2012 and the game was already 10 years old at that point. 
---
Theres content for every level of player and a 7 day old character can be an important part of a fleet even with multiple year old characters.
---
&gt; But from my experience we would be so far behind because training takes so long that we really would never get to the cool null-sec alliance part of the game.
---
You can pretty much get right into nullsec straight away. I recommend one of the newbro nullsec alliances:
---
- Pandemic Horde
---
- Brand Newbros
---
- Brave Newbies
---
- Karmafleet
---
even better
---
That dread was already in system. 
---
Typically while mining, if you get a large wave count in a short period of time (9 in an hour is spot on) then that's an indicator that a dread is warping around in your system.
---
Someone probably spawned it while hitting havens but couldn't kill it, then didn't tell anyone.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;hey ho.  
---
&gt;i want to create 2 new toons for highsec to create income. but iam not sure which way i want to get with this or which ship i need to skill.  
---
&gt;any idears? if i w create 2 mission runners which ships i need ?
---
Alphas can't do L4s so you'll have to go Omega. Highest income in HS can be made by running T5 Dark / Fire Abyss filaments and L4 Burner missions. 
---
For T5 Dark Abyss I'd recommend Sacrilege. For Fire go Vedmak or active fit heavy DPS focused Gila, all damage mods in lows with Augmented drones, no DCU because rats in fire get huge buff to armor HP. You will also need at least mid grade implants and some serious boosters, so you will need to train for those too, not just ship.
---
You can run other filament types but your income will drop severly. Gamma and Exotic giving you least.
---
For burners, train into all faction and assault frigates except maybe drones because burner rats kill drones and do so real quick. Literally. You will want to have pretty much all faction and assault frigs at your disposal all skilled to 5s along with weapon and support skills. You can get away with some level 4 skills but it becomes a PITA and you will have some losses which can get expensive as you will need to bling at least at start until you learn them well.
---
Once you get frigates down, train into cruisers, again into combat faction cruisers and HACs so you can cover all mission types.
---
If you can dual box then burners become easy, especially the team ones but if you stay solo you gotta be on your toes otherwise any mistake you make will cost you your ship even after you have them on farm.
---
I hope you feel better man. :)
---
*semi-woosh*
---
I probably PVP as much, if not more than the next mouthbreeder in the Imperium. Love theorycrafting and small-gang stuff. I do however like to see open tournaments or it will still be a circlejerk among the very few, highly established entities.
---
Well first, kudos on an actual thought out answer. Usually, I say "how about making a suggestion?" on Reddit and get a "it's not my job to come up with ideas for them" response. Thing is, when I ask for suggestions, I'm genuinely looking for discussion.
---
I think the goal should be a mix of a shake up, extra content, and anti-botting, in maybe a 20/40/40 ratio.
---
First up, a shake up.
---
I don't think anyone would dispute that the larger alliances are pretty comfortably settled for a long time, and basically the only threats to the top 5 are the rest of the top 5 (like, I don't care how good I am or how much time I throw at it, I will never be a threat to Test or Hoard unless I join goons or brave or something (and even then, I'm not the threat, I'm just a grain of sand in a sandblaster)). 
---
I think an event which tries to shake up the larger alliances. Not necessarily drive them out, but destabilize them, put them on the defensive for a bit wouldn't be bad. 
---
Giving it some thought, it could be that the Trig's are in some way tuned to favour larger fleets over smaller. So if you're out there on your own in a destroyer, they might send a couple of frigates. If you're in a titan (or a 100-titan blob), they send a much larger, much more dangerous fleet. (Basically some kind of aggro or threat measure based on ships and possibly the skill level of the pilots (if you're flying an amarr titan with Titan 5, you're gonna get a lot more aggro than titan 3). 
---
Start it as an event, a big invasion with lots of trigs around of all shapes and sizes, and give some decent rewards (drops, but also possibly some LP and reputation adjustment depending on where you are - if you're in deep null, away from the empire, you don't get much, but take them out one gate away from Caldari space, you get some bonus with the Caldari for stopping Trig's from getting into their space. 
---
Maybe even use it to shake up more than null - make it so that the trig fleets are heading through null for places like Amarr, Jita, etc (the empire capitals and the trade hubs), if they make it to, say Amarr, some kind of world event happens and players need to defend Amarr, if they fail, something like a massive destabilization of Amarr space or something, possibly some changes in who owns some systems on the borders (all spitball, but you get where I'm going). The fleets keep coming until some trigger happens (maybe there's a trig command ship that makes a normal titan Impairor lurking around in Null that players have to find and destroy in some crazy epic battle, or a hidden base in a null system that has to be trashed or something to that effect - basically something that's strong enough that it would take more than just Goonswarm or Horde to take it down - a fight that will cost a lot of ships and resources from all the large alliances and the small to handle).
---
TBH, I'd be far more interested in an event like than Permafrost (I'm still not even clear what Permafrost was about). 
---
For content, maybe once the event is over and the trig's have been successfully driven back, then a couple of null systems (quick look at the map, maybe the 7-8 systems in the extreme north east of Cobalt Edge starting with either E0DR-G or 9-WEMC) become a small Triglavian Empire who you can build reputation with, maybe some harder than average incursions with them trying to expand into the rest of Cobalt Edge or something.
---
For botting, CCP are always trying to take down botters with bans and stuff, but ultimately, it seems to be a losing war. They could make it so that once the Trig Empire has been established, they try to disrupt the other empires' ability to produce resources, so they try to hammer mining fleets. Maybe they build special 1-way jump gates that send fleets to other systems 1-way but at far greater range than the normal 2-way gates (basically a big space cannon that fires fleets). 
---
Mechanically, basically, whenever you have a fleet or fleets with a lot of mining ships in a system, there's a chance (like 0.3% per minute per fleet per system, which works out to roughly 20% an hour in null, maybe reduce it to 10% in low and 1% in high), with a cooldown so that if a fleet drops, another can't drop for 20-30 minutes to stop you getting horrible luck and having 2 drops in 3 minutes) that a trig fleet will appear based on a similar threat measure to what I've mentioned above for the first wave event - a bigger fleet = a stronger drop. 
---
So if your fleet is an orca, two or three few skiffs, a hulk and a miasmos, you might get a few freighters and a couple of destroyers. If you're out there with 22 rorq's, you might get a few battlecruisers and a few battleships (pure example, I have honestly got no idea how much firepower it would take to distrupt and destroy 22 rorqs, I only hit Orca about 2 months ago). 
---
Thing is that a fleet which is botting will have things that a computer can identify - 22 accounts all logged in from the same IP, actions which are too precise, too synchronised. too much uptime, etc. If the system detects that kind of behaviour over a certain threshold (after all, it's not impossible that you might have 22 from the same IP if they're all on a university campus or something), then instead of a tough but proportional response that would probably necessitate a bit of a retreat and maybe a call for help, as above, instead the system drops a load of trig titans, supercarriers and interdictors on them. The beauty of that is that it punishes the botters automatically, rather than needing reports (though of course, reports can continue as well).
---
If would add a new dimension to factor into normal mining fleet operations, because the bigger the fleet, the more risk you run if a drop happens, so maybe you have to also bring bodyguards or have an emergency cyno fleet ready or something, but it would make life really awkward for these 22 rorq fleets that are mirroring their input and stuff.
---
Obviously the botters would find their way around it eventually, but even causing them short term pain would be good.
---
TAPI is the ugly girl at the dance. Every once in a while goons or PL come along and lift off her glasses, and they say:

Nope. She's still ugly.

You can belt-rat in a PVP ship and loot clone soldiers / NPC mining haulers. It's not optimal isk/hr, but if you want to combine PVP and PVE, I found this the best way to do it.
---
Can you read the thread or you just have no idea what deadspace means?
---
There are plenty of alliances in the game, some only want veterans, some are dedicated for new players and carved pretty large amount of space for themselves.
---
Don't worry about skill training too much. It's gonna be a bit rough for a few weeks until you have some proper core skills trained but it's probably gonna take you just as long to find out what you really want to do in the game. And from there it's all about specializing. It doesn't take much time to be good (SP wise that is) at ONE thing, it just takes forever to be good at all the things. Moreover, having most skills at level 4 is perfectly fine because you get 80% of a skill's bonus in like 30% or less of the time it would take to train it to level 5.
---
Yes, it takes a fair amount of time, but unlike a lot of games your stats don't determine the impact you can have in Eve. They certainly help, but a brand new player in a cheap frigate can get "hero tackle" on an enemy commander with 100mil skillpoints and change the whole course of a battle.
---
Plus a ton of the important stuff in Eve happens outside of the game itself. Nobody cares how many skillpoints or isk (money) Naz al Ghul has, but we all know him for his propaganda posts. Other people make motivational posters or videos to pump up their troops or demotivate the enemy. And spies can be effective at any skill level.
---
TL;DR - Eve was around for almost 15 years before I joined, and I'm still having a blast. You can too.
---
TLDR; &lt;koolaid&gt;
---
How is it possible to indeed steal a loot if you're cloaked ?
---
Doesn't it make you super slow so you have to decloak and therefore be vulnerable ?
---
Okay thanks, to be honest I was scared it would mean I would basically be instapopped
---
You need to stop krabbing all the time. It's bad for you.
---
Thanks! And how do you go about finding one?
---
Holding space should be a constant battle against the local forces (guristas, sasha, Angel's and serps) they have these massive anomalies but dont choose to attack the player structures? 
---
Introduce some scarcity, have the rats deplete belts and anoms.
---
A triglave invasion should be a full hands on deck defense force. But if they are too persistent then no one would ever deploy (not like they do now anyways)
---
But I like the idea of NPC forces deploying citadels and depleting resources
---
Sure lol, as long as all those structures get bashed with all the other shit v0v. I just want structures removed from space. I don't care how it happens. :P
---
But yeah obviously there's gotta be more thought put into the system than a few seconds to make a reddit post lol, but I'm not the game designer so I don't have to waste my time. Just throwing out ideas.
---
I'm perfectly well aware of what deadspace means. I was just pointing out that, even in non-deadspace, you can't just warp to a hostile ship 300km off without probes.
---
Just run an abyssal and hope!
---
Yes, I have also bridged from a raitaru.
---
Its not like subcaps would be able speed up a Titan to 1000m/s. I think Titan pilots are much more chill with that than everyone else. If it gets bumped too far I fly back to my original position, no reason to overreact or shout on comms.
---
We're so accustomed to o/, o7, and the memes and pictures of ladies made up of dashes and slashes that emojis feel like it'd take away from Eve at this point
---
pfft I knew how to tank as soon as I started playing the game https://zkillboard.com/kill/48497953/ :P
---
I love it. It all part of the game. Over 10 years of playing eve and I’ve lost a whole lot more than a little hulk.
---
If you hate capitalism so much why don't you move to Venezuela?
---
toiletpaperusa.com
---
Can any structure use any racial fuel block? Could you fuel one with a mix of different racial blocks?
---
It should be done via lottery with all interested persons putting their name in the hat.  There should be a hard limit of 2 per alliance/Corp.  You want a diverse group of reps?  That would get the job done.  People lose their ability to vote then...??  Yes, and gain an actual voice.
---
Bumping Mach and a web frigate. You bump something and offer to web on the alt, then shoot when you get a duel request.
---
don't you mean
---
Still bookmark the fucking wormhole, no use giving them an easy podmail
---
&gt;Um, you press F1?
---
Found the carebear who hates CODE. and Goons and has no idea how much effort and organziation goes into ganking. You should try it out sometime.
---
I have seen worse fits.  I think my first ship lost - the only "positive" was all the guns were small railguns - of various metas, sizes, and i think even ammo.
---
Braver than I am. It's always the fc telling people to stop bumping anyway. I don't think I've heard a titan pilot worry about it
---
We should demod whoever put this post back up
---
&gt; ... you can be dead for up to a second (or up to 10 seconds, in the ase of severe TIDI) and not know it yet!

A sampling of some of Origin's activity since joining Fraternity. Features: Rorq ganks, carrier kills, the Mifrata subcap brawl (related to Camal keepstar fight) and an attack on a TEST incursion fleet.  In just about a month's time, we have killed 22 rorquals, numerous other capitals and hundreds of billions of isk in assets. Stay tuned for part two!   
---
ORIGIN is recruiting. Join "0RIGN" (with a zero) in-game channel.

Thanks as usual to our FC Elo Knight and the leadership team, all the scouts, logi and multi boxers that make these fights possible.

Imagine being so retarded you bitch about not being able to krab 100% safe
---
More tears, please.
---
Eve online is a special game for a few reasons. Pve is not one of them. The day NPCs force alliance decisions like moving or fighting is the day I finally leave for a better game.
---
It's not without risk of course. What you might not realize is that a lot of wormhole systems are empty a lot of the time, especially the ones without a direct highsec connection. And since you're planning to use cheapo T1 ships, some hunters may consider you small fry not worth trapping.
---
We are here for you! Even though sometimes we disagree so hard, we always love you and CCP for making Eve Online reality (✿◠‿◠✿)
---
I support this product and/or service!
---
Welcome to eve ityool
---
Yes you can! Don't be discouraged by higher level players. It is tough at the start, but remember with better stuff gets you more isk generation ( maybe not for market trading that's easy to get into). Fly your skill level, cheap stuff sucks sometimes but it's cheap disposable fun, you'll be surprised on how a cheap meta thing can perform against "expensive" stuff
---
However, skill points doesn't mean "better" at Eve. There are plenty of examples of people credit carding their character to Titans then welping them cause reeee rich noobs. Or yeah, depending on if you get on the kill mail.
---
There are plenty of nooby friendly people/corps/alliances. People take out free noob ships and in enough numbers can take down expensive stuff.
---
Lussy Lou killed a bunch of stuff on a free alpha character.
---
It's rough, but you can make some amazing friends In Eve
---
This basically. Charge them for infrastructure upkeep and let them make some cheese. Everybody likes filling their wallets for easy pew pew
---
This. Wormhole combat sites get capital escalations... Null can just krab freely on sites that were never updated to reflect capitals farming them nonstop.
---
Oh look, more use of persons as "content generators" as a reason to not punish them for wrongdoing. Where have I heard this before?
---
Delve is one of the biggest sources of spodbrains though. That's why.  
---
Grr Goons.

GOOD JOB PRESSING F1 ON STATIONARY MINING VESSELS

---
It’s called manners. Lots of cap pilots, particularly ones who have been around since before the fax/carrier split and tethering have a mild “ohshit” reflex to getting bumped. The titan’s doing you a favor, you could at least be polite and not fuck up their paintjob.
---
You can be in fights and effective in null in less than a day of training. This is fact. Dont let the training wait discourage you. The wait is a good thing, a natural gatekeeper to protect against flying shit you shouldn't be. Good luck!
---
I would definitely suggest not so much never trust anyone, but until you get past the newbro corp level of corp something more like "take every promise with a grain of salt" or something in eve. There's no reason to just flat distrust anything someone says, but newbro corps are filled with spies and such so I wouldn't suggest blindly believing everything I'm told in there. Once you get in a better corp (or just have been in the newbro corp a while and know who's been around and is trustworthy etc) you can be a lot more lax with trust. 
---
In my corp, I'm happy to let someone borrow my rorq if they need one for the night or weekend in my corp. Completely new people to the corp not so much, but I trust the environment we've created to foster a mutual respect and trust between all our corp members.
---
How does someone run for CSM? is there a signup form to fill out, if so... link? or is it literally just posting on the CSM forum and running a campaign. ther seems to be no "Official" way to put your name in the hat.

What benefits are there that aren't getting passed down to line members? I feel like I have access to whatever playstyle I'm interested in offered up on a silver platter. I've got the opportunity to fund those activities, and logistics to get me where I want to be with little trouble. I've only played for about 2.5 years, all of which in KarmaFleet, but it's been really fun. Besides wormholes, what am I missing?
---
&gt; Please stop using this br tool, it's beyond awful ~~on mobile.~~

ftfy
---
The real question is how has nobody overlayed these on each other to see the wire frame more completely (assuming its the same model)
---
slowly turning towards pay to play? it used to be pay to play. Alpha and Omega is relatively new.
---
Actually being valued by your alliance than more than a drone
---
You already committed the first no-no by downloading the game.
---
Can I sublet a asteroid belt
---
meh.
---
Did you purchase a permit? No? That's probably why you were being bumped.
---
ikr. it's CCP being CCP.
---
Well, we had to allow the rest of the Galaxy to play.
---
innocent until proven guilty still resonates with me.
---
Or just dont violate the NDA. Simple as that.
---
Not bitching here wanted to kill it but it was gone after DT....nice to meet you btw..you seem really nice
---
Lmfao init still whining, it’s ok.... you’re still in stage 1 lmao
---
Yes, I do. Purge all turbokrabs tbh
---
Lol! 
---
Dreddit doesn't cover those interests as far as I know. Ex-Testie btw.
---
Apply to SIGS and SQUADS )))
---
nullsec blocks represent the organised player base of the game. I mean if Hi-Sec had a reason to unite it might be different, still don't assume that because they are all from null-sec that they share the same agendas or even like each other.

what's wrong with inyourspace
---
I mean, actions speak louder than words. I have been taken extremely good care of by older members in KarmaFleet. I can't speak for other parts of the alliance, but I haven't been treated like a drone. They taught me to fish, how to build a fire, etc, whichever metaphor your want to use.
---
I'm still playing the game almost 3 years later and not bitter(yet). What value would you assign to that?
---
what if he didn't?
---
Why not?? clearly you missing the point...at no point I was bitching that a dread spawned...hell I was fighting him and having fun....I am only complaining that CCP reset it after DT and it was gone....so you might need to get your reading glasses checked...didnt knew having fun in the game was "bitching" for you...your mom must not showed you love as a kid :'( I will keep you in my prayers.
---
That's because you're a retard applying some mental idea of a western justice system to a video game.
---
The only thing that's resonating with you is a high frequency dose of autism
---
OK I will bite. You stay cloaked 500km away from the gate and allign when you see the gankers. Decloak and warp to the victim wreck faster than the ganker's looter. Escape.
---
cOntrACT To UpvOte
---
not a whine, a public service announcement. You can only be banned this way if your e-famous. Cheating under the radar makes CCP revenue so they don't care.
---
Its a game...relax...get yourself a girlfriend or something might take that edge off
---
Imagine complaining about your low value citadel not being able to solo a dread quickly. Ban all turbokrabs
---
I think this is a somewhat common misconception about EVE, that because skillpoints (SP) are accrued only through subscription time and not through traditional MMO "grinding", there's no way to catch up to players who have been playing for years longer than you. While this is sort-of-kind-of *technically* true, it doesn't matter.
---
The way SP is distributed in EVE, it emphasizes breadth rather than depth. Everything is trained from Levels I to V, with nothing beyond. Someone who has been in the game consistently since EVE was in beta will still not be able to fly Caldari Frigate ships any better than your character once you spend the week (or month) getting that particular skill (or skill set) up to V.
---
Gobs of SP gives you breadth of choice and tactical options more than it gives you raw percentage bonuses to, say, DPS or HP.
---
What you probably want to do, and what others in the thread have recommended, is to find a new-player-friendly group. They'll be able to guide you in terms of what your initial few weeks/months of training should optimally be in order to be able to fly their alliance's preferred ships, and within a few hours or days after character creation, you'll be able to contribute meaningfully alongside a bunch of alliance-mates. Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, and Brand Newbros are all focused on helping new players along regardless of SP pool.
---
Yea, just look at how Abyss launched and all the bugs and shit we reported on Sisi. They pushed it to TQ without fixing almost anything then a few months later everyone stopped running Abyss and they had to make an event to collect data to find out "why" people stopped running them and on top of all that, once they ran the event and colelcted all their data it turned out to be the **exact same shit** that we all reported from Sisi and they ignored.
---
I mean, LOL, just fucking LOL, who the fuck manages this shit ? How retarded is that ?
---
And its like this with so fucking many things its just unbelievable. I have never seen professionals so unprofessional, and not just that, but doing it over and over and over again and again and actually expecting different results.
---
How’s the koolaid tasting?
---
[Zarvox Teaches Highsec Ganking](https://youtu.be/PA3FEgAwW4k)

Can you not do SV stuff along with GSF tourney stuff?
---
lol. Who are you? Don't act like a random f1 pusher did anything to get your alliance to where it is today.
---
I never said not enough isk were dying
---
I never said i wanted more wars.  
---
However its not like that isn't a common opinion in this community. 
---
There are no reason to go to war, you don't get anything from it. That is mostly because CCP changed the meta to a citadel spamming game.  Before there was actual conflict over moons and territory. 
---
For example, even if goons disbanded, there would be no reason for any big sov holding alliance to invade delve. Because that would mean disbanding your already fortified space.
---
Don't worry man, when you grow up you will probably understand a bit more of how the game works outside your linemember bubble.
---
&gt;instead of begging ccp to remove others accomplishments
---
What? Not only are you retarded, you are also illiterate
---
Aw

Eh, no...it's more like...

But he did and CCP banned him for it.
---
we don't have koolaid in the uk :/

&gt;putting yourself forward to improve the game 
---
He didn't though. There were lots of better candidates with better understanding of the game. He even said himself that he didn't understand that much.
---
what if he did?
---
Just ask them about the rage eviction.
---
INIT never leaves stage 1
---
I mean can you jump into comms anytime and know everyone there, be able to have a substantial conversation with them, follow up on thints they mentioned were happening with their lives. You know, actual friendships.
---
If you raise a concern about something to your leader (which I'm pretty sure urs dosent even log into eve anymore) will they take it seriously and actually work on it with you immediately or will they dismiss you or talk down on you.
---
There's a reason why your required to be on a set amount of fleets a month. They need numbers, and your just a number.
---
Imagine your failing attempt of trolling that you are making up me complaining about my structure not able to kill it...again...let me explain it to you barney style since it seems you cant comprehend simple verses...it spawned 11 minutes before DT, the structure is not fitted to fight Capitals but to kill small tackle "IF" anyone gets tackled in the belt, and this post was to show a nice picture I took and how much fun I was having trying to kill it...not sure if your game experience has been terrible or someone scammed you in Jita...maybe was CODE that ganked you and you still resented about it? Do you need the love of Jesus? I can show you the way!!
---
its like when they evicted HK and spendt a month trying to tell people it wasn't goons accomplishment
---
Never have I seen someone salt post about winning a fight 😂
---
Sure can, I do a whole variety of stuff. But being a director of my corp also eats some time.
---
I'd be happy to participate in tourneys representing LAWN in the future... :D
---
Thats what i asked on the last thread!
---
Yeah, pretty solid advice. I can't fault you on any of your recommendations. 
---
I just got burnt on it. Having 4 monitors up and logging in multiple accounts everyday just to try to stay competitive, it just got old. I sat there one day going "What the fuck am I doing"? Logged out and went for a walk. Haven't really logged back in much since.
---
Strong 👏 independent 👏 alliance 👏
---
i am greatful for the friends i'm making in the nullsec corp i just joined. diplomatic relations with our neighbors are a nightmare right now, so we're having to fight to get resources and live our day to day lives.
---
none of us are pvpers, so we're having to work together to come up with doctrines and skill plans. i could just go and play on one of my other carebear accounts, but having a common goal that requires teamwork is really fun!
---
thanks for making such a great game ccp 🙂.

Fuel blocks are a guaranteed, regular income. Used to power all citadels, POS, and used in moon goo reactions. No matter how much fuel you make, someone will buy it and fast.

---
An employee at CCP could of easily jumped the gun, put 1+1 together and made 10. Especially when said employee is a new hire with no working knowledge of how EvE works. Someone used to disputes in World of Warcraft (CCP Dopamine) would be woefully unprepared to deal with the level of deception and espionage that EvE players are capable of, as the blog post stated that the "evidence" was provided by other EvE players, its not far fetched to be a little sceptical of the validity of the aforementioned evidence.
---
Cross post this to r/imaginaryspaceships.
---
CCP did their internal investigation and determined he was guilty.
---
You're not entitled to see the evidence.
---
love it! Can you share any higher resolutions. Immediate desktop background. :)
---
&gt;So here I am sitting minding my own business mining some moon crap...and after 9 waves of rats in less than an hour bam!! a damn dreadnought spawn on the moon belt!!
---
&gt;I was like...oh kool...let me try to kill it with the stupid Athanor...so after fighting this thing for about 10 minutes I got him/her to 50% structure...but oh wait!!! DT is less than 3 minutes away, so what I do?? Log back in hoping that damn ugly ship still there...but nope, the thing was gone...good one CCP...good one!!!
---
&gt;good one CCP...good one!!!
---
Imagine trying to go from this to "oh i was posting to tell you how much fun i'm having". Maybe next time try writing up a post that doesn't show that you're just upset your antisub structure doesn't kill dreads
---
&gt;maybe was CODE ganked
---
Projection?
---
&gt;do you need the love of Jesus
---
I thought that was only given to small children by grown men
---
This is amazing, well done!
---
I mean, if at first you don't succeed, right?
---
You will still get nuked, sorry :(
---
Wow! What a deal!
---
Not sure if there is a trend being driven Pearl Abyss or anything, but sub+pay for pvp has basically always been an option in Eve. It is not a bad thing. If making isk and having fun playing Eve aren't the same activity for you, selling a PLEX is a much better option than grinding isk IMO.
---
You guys all have phones, right?
---
Best looking super ingame.. byfar
---
The 5 stages of grief and loss are:
---
1. Denial and isolation
---
2. Anger **&lt;-- you are here**
---
3. Bargaining
---
4. Depression
---
5. Acceptance
---
I have never heard of anything like that but now you have me wondering. I have seen some pretty silly moon fractures where we'll see rats all the time and then some where we wont for days. I just figure it was luck of the draw/random.
---
I've been having a rough month, but I spent last night munching moons with Corpmates while listening to the Anarchy Online OST and it was exactly what I needed. Feeling better today.
---
You guys all have drones, right?
---
Someone gave me at least 200-300 PLEX, seemingly at random last night. I have no clue who did it, but I certainly appreciate it (✿◠‿◠)
---
Get to know people and make friends ASAP. Very few play this game solo for long.
---
Yes...took a picture and I was having fun trying to kill it...till DT came around...so not sure what you trying to implying in here..and yes Jesus loves you...i can offer a ear so you can rant about your issues in life, I know people go thru hard times in life and come into the internet to spill your emotions, i can be that friend in need and help guide you thru a better view of life...of course if you are willing to open up to a friendship :)
---
Shit dude! How long did that take to do?
---
If they don't waste time and resources on other projects, they won't have an excuse for leaving issues in Eve unresolved.
---
&gt; Learn how to move isk to your spy alts without setting off alarm bells when someone analyzes the account.
---
Any idea how long API or ESI checks can go back? is it only a few months?
---
I don't think you do
---
&gt;despite project nova cancellation
---
Well hang on a minute, that's not fair. Let's be fair to Hilmar.
---
CCP will keep spending our sub/plex money on games that won't take off, despite World of Darkness, DUST 514, EVE Valkyrie, Project Legion, Project Nova abandonments.
---
i bought a new monitor right before the update and spent a minute not sure if they update the lighting or if my new monitor was just that good. haha
---
Sorry, 3000x2000 is the highest I have :(
---
https://imgur.com/a/BmFjynM
---
Please Clap
---
API is dead right? No clue about ESI. I quit long before that. A good guideline is like 1-2 years back
---
&gt;Which game mechanics does Hilmar currently see as the primary cause of rat-botting proliferation, and what does he intend to do about it?
---
The first part of this question is actually very good. The second part we already know, he will just point to the security team, new algorithms, new incoming processes for dealing with bots etc. We already know they are working on it.
---
But that first par, which game mechanics does the CEO think cause the most botting ? That is a good one and can be further expanded.
---
Which game mechanics does he as the CEO, think are most bot friendly, helpful for bots to "set up shop" ?
---
Which game mechanics drive the players to botting the most, what does he think ?
---
Sweet
---
alternate theory:
---
he did it. there's proof. you're crying because your alliance got deleted from relevance
---
You should hook up with u/fedorcallahan. He too loves touching children and complaining.
---
Given its track record, what will CCP fail with next before redoubling their efforts into EVE?
---
Shows what you know!   We approach :P
---
Minitru always does the best propoganda!
---
Sadus was the first Avenger.
---
You guys all have clones, right?
---
Well, they could always lay off a third of the company again
---
awesome render!
---
1 different script command, not hard
---
No wondering to it. If a system has no rat killing activity, you won't see any spawning on you. If there is an active belt ratter, you'll see them spawn at your location on occasion. If a dread is spawned, the rat spawn increases/targets player locations and you'll see a lot more rats spawning on you.
---
The only time this doesn't work is if there are active belt ratters and a dread spawns, you may not see that many rat spawns as they could be randomly spawning in on the belt ratters.
---
Anyone that attempts to speak out for or against things in the game that doesn't choose to use an alias to speak for their rather than using the name and/or alliance/whatever of their character already HAS people that hunt you down in eve, downvote your posts and even make threats to you and your ability to play the game. 
---
Being CSM doesn't change that.
---
If I wanted to attack random mining vessels and flee on the wind with Fleelo Knight everytime a good fight is brewing, then sure, I would join you, however, since you guys seem to run away at meaningful content, I must decline. Shooting mining vessels then running away when the defense shows up just makes the Fleelo Knight meme continue.
---
Your games all have clones, right?
---
You know, being "competitive" is only a state of mind. I gave up trying to be super cool with multiple caps and a supercarrier, sold that shit off, and now I fly cheap ass frigates in lowsec or a hecate when I am itching to kill some krabs in nullsec. I log in when I want, play as long as I want, and then go about my daily business. There's nothing saying you **MUST** have multiple accounts with multiple monitors up in order to have fun.
---

---
I kitbashed everything in octane render, took the ingame models and retextured them
---
Why so serious
---
Its not even really a playstyle, its just what obsessive players do with their extra alts so they can win fights and steal shit and what-have-you.
---
If my rorq gets tackled will you save it?
---
Running away and cat and mouse games is a elo special after all. 
---
And next time, the ragnarok will not escape.
---
Agreed, I was dipping into lowsec before my two week trial was up. Just be smart about it, don't take your shiny new cruiser there. Take a cheap frigate or a corvette/starter ship.
---
like 1,5h of work and 30min to render with volumetrics
---
No, if you're going to rent space at least try to be an alliance that isn't useless. Or better yet, rub 2 braincells together and just don't be a renter.
---
Ah I see. Yeah I thought the caracal model looked a bit too accurate to be hand drawn. But good art is good art. Great work!

So you do know that, relative to the Wyvern, that the Rokhs are upside down, and both the Rokhs and Caracals are heading backwards, right?
---
But why are the rokhs facing the wrong direction and are upside down?
---
I was in a similar situation to you 9 months ago when I started again with new characters because I gave my old ones away a decade ago.  You can now buy Skill injectors with in game isk and boost your sp to catch up to people who have played years.  In the 6 months since moving to a null sec alliance I was able to make enough isk to buy and fly a mainline dps ship in every sub cap doctrine my alliance has.  If you like the game and put in the time to make isk, you could do the same.  Or you can just specialize and fly just a few ship but to learn to become skilled pilot with them.  Skill points can be bought but experience and piloting skill cannot, you have to earn those.  Every time your ship goes up in the flames of despair,  you get a little better and the real gap between you and veteran pilots gets closer.
---
Fair enough, will you aid me if someone else tries to take over my space I rent?
---
You indeed need a friend...I am very sad for you. Hope all goes well for you and that your game experience goes well :)
---
&gt;will the alliance making money by owning that space do anything if another alliance tries to take that space
---
Surely even you could work that out for yourself.
---
Super cool!
---
Ya no one said anything...now I know for next time when that many rats warp in lol
---
I'm a goon, so there's only two options : 1st the whole fleet make it back. 2nd, we well, if I survive I will be an ass in the system until I get a pod Express.
---
Bonus, sometimes, I get bosoned by another goon xD
---
He was going down slowly...maybe CCP needs to update structures since that thing is not even fitted to fight capitals
---
Its not an issue with a leopard :)
---
It's space. Up and down are relative
---
yeah I know, aesthetic reasons. Its not really for the eve fanbase, more for my own training and r&amp;d in the program. 
---
I tryed them normal, didnt like, turned them around. 
---
Just imagine they bumped on some stuff and are flipped now. :D
---
Really weird flex but okay.
---
In space does up and down matter?
---
Most of my experiences were in systems with absolutely no one touching rats for hours if not all day, so perhaps there is more to it than that.
---
You dont need more than one, its just easier to do with an alt. And alot of isk making methods stack well with multiple accounts.
---
I thought the burner missions required active piloting and a semblance of skill? Or have they been theorycrafted and minmaxed such that you just copy the fit and you win?
---
Your games all have thrones, right?
---
Have you see anyone attacking Delve since goons are here ? That answer your question, we won't have to do it since no one dare hurt goons space
---
I can't wait for a mobile eve online to get canned
---
Well, if you are surrounded, the way you are facing doesn't matter at least. But being a calmil vet, this actually is pretty caldari.

Whatever this guy is smoking, give me 5 of them
---
Long time FW pilot here. Cut my teeth with Minnie in 2012 or so, and have been Gallente for a few years now.
---
One thing to consider is FW pvp tends to be cheap bc the meta leans towards frigs/dessies. Even their T2 counterparts generally don't break the bank.
---
So that said, I've never bothered with missions and can keep my head above water just plexing and hunting. Occasionally I'll run some DED if I really need the isk.
---
It's possible to earn 100+ mil/hr just plexing if you're uninterrupted. That should fund a lot of frigates to blow up.
---
please show where the muninn touched you
---
I for one welcome our triangle overlords
---
This is also a really weird comment...
---
BL did the same thing to us, hit our shit to draw out good fleet fights. Damn they were fun, I really miss those days back in O-V.
---
I'm 100% certain that will result in multiple pings, possibly including a couple of hundred supers.
---
Dont leak changes and than profit off them, pretty fucking simple
---
you're not my real dad, you can't tell me what to do, but if you insist i won't

I wonder why you'd rent to mine in rorqs when you can just join goons and do it for free (well, some participation requirements but nothing too extreme).
---
Speaking of merch I swear someone was making eve patches at one point.
---
pepelove
---
Huh??
---
It’s been suffering with recent zkill changes.
---
Thanks for the answer to my *real* question!
---
You should join a dedicated FW corp whos veteran members can give you more detailed advice.
---
Even at low tier, it is not difficult to fund frigate / dessie pvp from the LP you earn running FW plex.  
---
As others have said, missions are more lucrative (especially at high tier), but they do require specific knowledge of how to run them.  I run gallente FW missions solo (no alts) in a specialized Hecate fit that costs about 300m.  One set of missions gets me 800m-1Bisk worth of LP, and takes a couple hours, including zipping around in a Leopard to pull the missions. 
---
Keep in mind, that LP/isk conversion is a ballpark figure based on running the missions at Tier 4, then waiting to cash out till we fall to Tier 1 and prices climb.  If you are trading in your LP as you earn you can still get decent enough isk trading the right items to replace plenty of frigate and destroyer losses.  Especially if you are flying faction navy ships that are cheaply available with your FW LP.
---
Neat

Where do I sign up?

Just because you can't do it in the hull doesn't mean it can't be done...
---
I think the main problem with Gurristas is if you get unlucky &amp; 100% jammed out.
---
FYI The Steam Eve store page says that they're bogged down due to demand so maybe that's what's holding you up
---
Because I don't to pvp, and I want exclusive rights to MY belts
---
In fairness, that was pre brain-in-a-box which would now make the server load more manageable. They already are doing some things like this like the battle no-one saw where 2 fleets of rats attacked each other in a belt anom...

The sad thing is that people that retarded actually exist
---
&gt;CP will keep spending our sub/plex money on games that won't take off, despite World of Darkness, DUST 514, EVE Valkyrie, Project Legion, Project Nova abandonments.
---
Dust 514 probably would have been fine, and alive and well, had they made it for PC. In fact, if CCP took a look at Planet Side, they've got a model that could still work for the EVE ip. 
---
Here is the thing though, it either has to be cross platform or PC only.
---
Except there weren’t good fights. I’d come home ragged from eldercare duties every night to find Elo and his Muninns parading up and down in front of the Beanstar, with a Horde fleet formed but unable to engage because no warp-in. Elo would pick off a few stragglers and then fuck off when it seemed like we might actually, finally be able to fire a weapon. Rinse and repeat, ad infinitum, nightly from about 9 pm EDT to 11 pm EDT.
---
You mean in goons?
---
Too bad the model is so small
---
Are you saying CCP shouldn't make a console exclusive spinoff for their PC game?
---
&gt; You'll note the only thing remarkable about that story from the perspective of the media was how damn long it took you to prepare for it.
---
I mean it was pretty remarkable but
---
&gt; Shiva
---
Ah, that explains a lot.
---
No you 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; never get to the cool null-sec alliance part of the game.
---
You mean "start your own alliance and take over half of null?" Or "join an alliance and do null stuff?"
---
If the first, you really need good people skills and it would help if you and your half-dozen closest friends were comfortably well-off without working so you could make a full-time job out of organizing shit and poaching pilots from other groups. In-game SP would not be so important.
---
If the second, I think it's easier now than it would have been in 2013 when I started. 
---
If you mean "personally own a Titan and use it to stomp shit solopwn" I think you have some misconceptions.
---
They're one evolutionary step up from renters and all the other "i'm here in eve online and i want no pvp anywhere near me"
---
Yeah, but not at the same scale, before there were essentially medium scale fleet fights (up to 100 per side) on several grids and when there are several systems on the same node it caused massive tidi (really hard to mitigate that unless you have every system on its own node) because even if no one's watching he server's still doing the calculations (ontop of the AI math) 
---
currently the Rats vs rats battles at most constitute of aproximatly 20-30 ships total which isnt much and even then its rare and far inbetween
---
Not at all. Having Trigs or other really difficult NPCs controlling constellations would eliminate the ability of the large alliances to take and hold space and rent it out. Or at least it would make it very unprofitable. Large alliances would move and settle in areas that are contested by the NPC's with enough space to support their membership. Smaller corporations could take up shop in in the vacuum left behind assuming the NPC invasion didn't hit every system in a region.
---
but there is no drake :(
---
While the might not share the same "agenda" they share the same perspective, this leads to a CSM that's positively useless for anything that is out of the common perspective.
---
Actually, this is an artifact of the scum that is the iMessage design team. Most people have no idea it happens, because other iMessage users only see the "like" or whatever show up on their colorful message giving their lizard brains the social gratification it desires. Meanwhile, instead of only sending the info to iMessage participants (it knows who is who) it decides to send you that stupid, irrelevant nonsense. Because why not annoy everyone who doesn't use your product?
---
When we were outnumbered by 1:3 it's only rational to play hit and run.  
---
The moment we fought you with your terms in QRBN you guys said how retarded we were feeding to supercaps. Last night we killed 7.6 bil worth of your vessels while extracting under boson traps and only lost less than 4b.
---
the real question might be how you would spin this?
---
Hit me with that China C&amp;C Generals theme again bby.
---
it's just interest how you build your whole argument on the fact that I'm a useless HS noob. and now that you know that I'm in TEST, a group is used to deal with citadel spam, you suddenly change your narrative to "dinobrain doesn't understand"? That is weak...
---
Weaker (not none) asset safety in nullsec as well as a timer rework I fully support though. But thinking that POSes were better, is just... well, forgetful
---
The Gallente’s gate is down?
---
Ahh, makes sense. The good fights actually happened at 8EDT when you were still doing eldercare duties. 
---
Sorry my man.

CCP will write an article when CSM applications are open and being accepted.  [Here](https://www.eveonline.com/article/p5u73v/csm-13-applications-are-now-open) is last year's article.
---
Chad FC should be able to take on a 3x as many mouthbreathers.  Your argument is invalid.
---
I would add my voice to stainguy's question.
---
Actiblizzard is that you?
---
But the nyx is gallante. This is a caldari wyvern. I think you got them mixed up.
---
What a shit argument. It's like saying the Dev's made rorqs and excavator drones super efficient, but it was a PLAYER made decision to proliferate rorq mining. Ya of course it was player made decisions...made in response to dev changes and tweaks.  
---

---
Or at least sign an exclusivity on an end of life console line like PS3 when the PS4 was less than a year away.
---
Its my understanding ccp gives you isk everytime you cry about the fw mechanics or fw bots.

so you like to be TAPI?

Same. All of a sudden the space itch hit me and I think I’m gonna move into a world and meet a chill group and frag some nullbears. stoked!

I don't remember it being this bad a couple of years ago, though it was never 'great.'

I guess NC. really has a talent for making anything taste like shit.

How do you see CCP and Eve carrying on after your inevitable departure?
---
Not a lot of point in looting that slicer after you dropped your super on it. Gotta get back to your dank 4x rorq ticks.
---
The "try and fail" mentality is a positive. Iterating is a good way to develop a successful project.
---
That said, I have no faith in Hilmar being able to steer the ship successfully. I think the repeated failures are proof that he is not competent.

&gt; If I wanted to attack random mining vessels and flee on the wind with Fleelo Knight everytime a good fight is brewing, then sure, I would join you, however, since you guys seem to run away at meaningful content, I must decline. Shooting mining vessels then running away when the defense shows up just makes the Fleelo Knight meme continue.

Imagine having to repeat 'running away' 3 times in 2 sentences to make a point.

You fought the Fountain war over a moon change. But you won't potentially fight a war over condensing space in nullsec?

I mean at this point 1 employee might be 1/3 of the company.

Not the OP, but I've been meaning to get into T5 abyss sites, I've been running T4s comfortably for a while now. What is the vedmak fit and implants needed for fires or could you point me to a guide for T5s?

Fucking idiots. It'd be like watching jeep stop supporting jeeps because they're trying to make a sports car. They're just missing their entire customer base

They should focus on PC and make a good game.

Doing cross platforms always fuk things up.

&gt; the real question might be how you would spin this?
---
"You're only killing the dumb people so it doesn't matter and actually you are helping us"
---
The base burner missions are the hardest &amp; at least the one against the 3 x Talos requires active piloting. 
---
Apart from that 90% are the same. Accept mission, load right fit, warp into sight. Lock enemies, start modules, start shooting keep at range 1500 &amp; overheat guns (most missions can be done in a daredevil where you don’t have to fear that the guns can burn out). Every once in a while you chuck a cap booster. 
---
The team burner (1 frig &amp; 2 logi) is the same, except that you kill 1 or 2 logi before going for the frig...
---
I can do them without any worries while watching some videos..
---
I have only died 2 times. 1st time because I forgot to load cap booster &amp; second time because I loaded the fit for the Succubus against the Dramiel. So yes, they are theoriecrafted &amp; min maxed

Do you have a new ship type that can blops into PB from Stain?

CCP in tyool 2019 is just hilmar fozzie and falcon. It's been hard on them since Guard went up to that dev studio in the sky.

---
Better yet, focus on their current PC game rather than try shifting the money into projects that consistently fail
---
Oh, it seems he feels completely entitled to see the evidence lmao
---
Atleast you are not alone, wish you could buy braincells for some of these eve players that aint even new
---
People will do what is profitable. It is profitable to conquer, hold, and rent space. If you had an NPC force that made it more painful than it was worth to rent the space, large alliances wouldn't bother. Either introduce mechanics to force large alliances to spread out (reduced or finite anomoly spawning), or introduce a mechanic to condense the amount of viable nullsec space.
---
Yes way.
---
&gt;I think the repeated failures are proof that he is ~~not~~ competent.
---
-The poor bastards who invested in CCP
---
&gt; they won't have an excuse

as if they need any.

Wait when did Nova get cancelled.

That's "we didn't fuck up please believe us" speak for "cancellation". You can hardly expect a company, especially CCP, to face their failures properly.

I’m just now getting back into the game after a long break, long enough that I feel like I’m relearning the game, and I’m also starting fresh as I gave my old account to a friend (enjoying the fresh start though). I have two questions to start.
---
First, is there a certain corporation that is best to run high sec missions in Gallente space? I used to do Fed Navy back in the day, but I see a lot of folks talk about the Sisters of Eve.
---
Second, with the upcoming removal of POS’s, what is the future of player owned structures in high sec? I saw that there will be the new moon mining available in 0.5 sec systems, but what about for manufacturing, etc?
---
Thats the one
---
Isn't it always the smaller groups or Black-Footed Ferrets or Blue-Throated Macaws preventing change?
---
I want a shopping mall but noooooooo some fuzzy ferret wont allow it.
---
Seriously who are these smaller groups holding null sov without an umbrella?
---
If the space was worth anything they'd have been rolled over for the goo or ticks, not the structure prizes. 
---
Asset safety in sovereign null is too ironic yet WH space, which can't be claimed, has none. 
---
Something needs to drive conflict.
---
At least limit the ridiculous amount of structures per system.
---
nah, it's been slightly more active recently with the renters moving in - certainly not an active region yet, but that's why I want more people to go there
---
we bagged some smartbomb ratters + a moros
---
and a few days later a rorq + moros
---
What happened to cruisers crew
---
I should get myself a carrier.
---
&gt; You seem to be completely blind to the fact that it provides completely unreasonable safety not only for the people that want the good fights but also for the people that bait and blobs themselves
---
A nullsec player complaining about 'completely unreasonable safety'? I hope you want big nerfs to cynos, tethering, ratting aligned and local too.
---
Nice... but it emphasizes one pet peeve of mine about Eve. I wanted massive space fleets, arrayed in all their glory, organized and efficient. Epic scenery. What do I get? Pictures of capitals all blobbed together, pointing in different directions with no more organization that a bunch of green, plastic soldiers thrown in a pile. I am vaguely disappointed.
---
If someone ask's you to join an alliance and offers to move all your stuff where you will be safe in 0.0 space where you can make lots and lots of money, trust them completely, they have your best interests at heart and are truly trying to help you.
---
Some people will try and troll you and tell you its a scam, but those people are just losers and mad no one will invite them to 0.0 space to make lots and lots of money.
---
Contact Sadus in-game for more information on how you can obtain your very own piece of Period Basis!
---
Was going to ask if you have any more projects based on Eve up your sleeve that will fail. But I see that's already answered in another thread here, yes.
---
Yes to everything. There are so many social layers in Goonswarm that you can't just superfically say that there are 10k drones and like 20 FC and Mittens.
---
Mittani probably doesnt know me and honestly how could he know the ~10k real people in his alliance? The leadership structure is set up in a way so he doenst have to. 
---
Corp culture is actually really strong in Goons and so are Sig/Squads and specific social groups. I know people on reddit are seeing us as a homogeneous blob that presses F1 when told to, but sometimes you have look a bit behind the curtains.

Yet forward and reverse have some meaning.

No drake, no cigar
---
It all depends on where your motivations lie. If you want to enable your alliance through active intel, passive intel, spy hunting (althoug this isn't an entry level task), ect. Or if you want to expoit for your own gain. The latter isn't as popular because the age of alliances relying on 3rd parties for their intel is a thing of the past. When I first started I would study the way the original OSS operated in World War 2 or how the CIA fought the intelligence wars during the Cold War. You can take inspiration from history or study the feats of established spies and organizations to find your goals. The best advice I can give you is the best spies in history are the ones you never hear about.
---
Could you tell me more about this and how to get into it?
---
I mean, we will all probably laugh too because we don't really give a shit and its just more drama to enjoy.
---
What are you talking about it’s literally the easiest shit to fly.
---
30km defensive Scam keeps anyone with a MWD well outside your scram range.
---
You have rapid lights that can hit out to keres tackle range.
---
Speed is a very one sided value. If you can kill anyone that can catch you and fly away from anyone who can kill you. Thats a nano ship.

Get an LSE &amp; Ancillary in the mids.

If anything the microgang I outlined is bad against sensor damps. But you have a Keres for counter plays.

Yeah seriously I thought it was just being reworked
---
I like it, nicely done. The mood is perfectly captured.
---
Surely it's safer to just run Abyssals (frigate or cruiser) in high-sec and not in a wormhole so whatever you've found it's certainly not the safest PVE in the game. 
---
Who's going to wait up to 20 mins for 3 frigates in high-sec and then try and pop them coming out?
---
It has to be the easiest thing to test though.
---
What's the limit of the mental gymnastics you will do to vilify CCP for enforcing their policies rather than realizing that Brisc is lying and CCP did you a favor? 
---
You benefit from them removing people who cheat. The community benefits. The game benefits. 
---
But no... he's on your team so you want to go to bat for him for no reason.
---
So it got labeled an exploit after more people started using it, fair enough. But what about the bugs like the problem with T2 siedge modules that was first noticed on the test server a week before it was released. IT got a reddit post yet still made it to sisi. OR what about the numerous posted about jumping through a WH only to wind up at the sun, or the post about jumping though a mass stable WH only to wind up crushing it? There is also the graphical bugs you use to get when looking at something extremely far from you, which I would argue is closer to the category this bug falls into then the ESS exploit is. True, CCP might respond to bugs better once they start getting exploited because more people know about them, but that is more a result of knowledge being spread through the player base then a result of a dev seeing a reddit post.

If the slepnier is dual neut and fit with an XLASB, I'm tempted to say it has the advantage. Unless the drek pilot is able to mitigate damage through piloting he will have a difficult time keeping everything running, even with a cap booster. If the slep doesn't stagger his neuts properly it wouldn't be as advantageous to him though. The best I can say is that it is possible for either side to win, but the slep you described has the advantage as he can probably neut the drek before he fully ramps up. If he is using EC-300s it gets even worse, as even one successful jam restarts the dreks weapon rampup.

---
I see the cruiser traces on d-scan no problem. Are you saying the frig traces don't show on d-scan?
---
It is truly amazing how out of touch CCP is. They could clearly grow more revenue through game improvement and advertising. Its been how many years since a TV ad? CCp's current online adds don't look different than crap/bullshit mobile games. 
---
Its a private company so no one can tell them how to run their business. As a customer who enjoys the product and wants to see it improved and thrive this is very frustrating.
---
It’s going to be a local thing. There’s a lot of bad mojo going around. Please keep in mind that all this bad will accumulates over time. EVE does not reset. What happened 5 years ago still lives in today’s political reality. People overheat in EVE, not just the modules, and that leaves scars. It’s not going to get better from that perspective, it’s just how things run there.
---
My advice is: don’t take it all too seriously.
---
Fantastic work on this; looks beautiful!
---
Any plans for a Minmatar version?
---
and now I have my latest desktop background, very cool
---
Low rental fee and unrestricted access to anomalies in the entire region, to start. Couple that with the active and powerful defenses of the Imperium...I think you can figure out why someone would rent.
---
&gt; I’m wondering, why are TEST doing so bad the first few big battles? 
---
It's kinda what we do.  We were getting dicked pretty hard in the Meteor War for the first month or two, but we eventually managed to turn that around.
---
During peacetime we add a bunch of carebears, (as people tend to do) so when we actually go to war, there is a period where the carebears either learn how to F1 better, or they end up leaving.
---
Same thing with FCs.  At the beginning of these different wars/deployments, we start out with a group of FCs, and some are pretty good, and some aren't. The ones that aren't either get better, or end up not FCing anymore for one reason or another.  Our doctrines are the same way.  We start with some doctrines, and as we figure out what works and doesn't, they get refined or replaced.
---
And just to be clear, Test has never really been "elite".  We have been, and can be good, but the fact that just about anyone who is interested can join Test, and that our organization and requirements are pretty much tailored to more casual players kinda precludes us ever being "Elite", like PL or NC used to be.
---
At this point, I bet you're thinking: "Well, Horde and Brave are both pretty casual and have open recruitment, but they don't have that problem!"  Well, you're right. However they play the game a bit different then we do.  They are perfectly content to hang out in Geminate or Catch and let fights come to them, or to help out their coalitions in bigger fights, and there's nothing wrong with that.  However, this expeditionary style of war Test/Goons/PL/NC/whoever does is quite a bit harder, and has a lot steeper learning curve.  The fact that PL/NC is quite a bit more exclusive and elite then Test/Goons means that they generally work through that learning curve a bit quicker.
---
Sorry this got kinda long, and hopefully I didn't shit on anyone too bad, but hopefully I answered your question without too much spin.
---
Think you can still play Valkyrie. Last time I played it it was really realistic, almost entirely like eve: full of design flaws and almost everyone you see is a bot
---
Hell yes. Application at range is absurd with autocannons. Warp in blap so fast you laugh and bail.
---
I miss DUST 514.
---
i just tested it on sisi and added everything to d-scan and the probe filters and you cant d-scan or combat scan the frig trace...
---
so yes its super safe, you need to be scanned down before you jump in or when you come out
---
Because they can roll holes and keep other people out. I can hardly wall off a section of germinate from goons while I krab
---
Oh yeah
---
no plans, but maybe something different with minmatar :)
---
This.
---
time is a flat circle v0v
---
Things have been like this since the beginning of eve and with every project CCP has ever done, some might say if everything but the boss changes, but things stay the same, the boss may very well be the problem...
---
Have they done a card game yet like Blizzard's Heartstone?
---
frig traces aren't traces, theyre gates, which can't be combatted
---
I’m a wormholer. Do they get spawned by RNG or like drifters?
---
How much less could you care?
---
First, if you are looking for a corp to join in HS, I'd recommend EVE-University. They aren't primarily a mission running corp, but they do run missions and will give you the chance to get exposed to most parts of the game as well. The main reason to be in a corp for running missions is for the lower taxs, so most mission runners are in their own corp, though this doesn't exclude them from having friends.
---
As to your second point, there is already moon mining in HS. POSs are being replaced with upwell structures. The smallest ones are Athanors for moon mining, refining, and reacting. Raitarus for manufacturing and research. Astrahuses for cloning as well as being significantly more defensible. Any structure can do any of these (except for moon mining, which is specific to athanors), you just need to fit the needed service module for the service. The ones listed above however get a bonus to those services. There are larger structures as well, which give better bonuses and are more defensible, but cost significantly more. Thee raitaru, the cheapest medium structure costs around 500mil, where the Azbel, the cheapest large structure, costs around 3.5 bil.
---
I certainly don't disagree with your statement. But, I do think that, in this case, CCP may wind up harming their business unnecessarily. That is really my concern. I'd like them to choose to be more transparent in this case for the sake of all of us who wish to keep the game healthy. This is a special case and it deserves special treatment. Heck, I would even be in favor of a bit more transparency in the case of any ban of accounts older than a year or pick your time-frame.

tbh if they just dragged out some Dust 514 files from somewhere, used DevMagic^TM to make it playable on PC, I would play the shit out of it
---
Well, first you want to find yourself an empty C5. Vanilla, Red Giant, or Magnetar will suffice. C5-C4s are generally empty and there are 46 C5-C4 No Effects, 11 C5-C4 Red Giants, and 8 C5-C4 Magnetars. The magnetars will probably already be taken so just go for a no effect.
---
Once you do that, retain hole control, and drop an astrahus. Once it's anchored and online, fuel it and online a clone bay, and then bring in your paladin. If you're ultra paranoid, just wait until you get a direct high, shouldn't take longer than a week. Anyways, once you have your paladin in, roll all of the holes, scan down a your new static but don't warp to it. Due to wormhole mechanics, this means your system is entirely sealed off (but it doesn't mean people can't roll into you). Now you are ready to run sites. Get into your mid-grade asklepian pod, hop in your paladin, and run all of the Core Garrisons and Core Strongholds you want. Takes about 40 minutes per site, skills dependent. There's 253M worth of blue loot in each garrison and and 234M in each stronghold. Use Karr's Modified Rykki's Guide for the sites so you get used to the triggers and what you can handle each spawn.
---
Happy Krabbing.
---
PI is stored in the balls.
---
They appear in level 3 sites and above. They only appear if enough people are running abyssal sites at that time, so you don't always get one. If you enter and no one else shows after 15 min, then you can take the loot and leave.
---
Collecting killmarks is like collecting Reddit karma.
---
Pretty useless compared to the joy trolling.
---
Better then every moon having a inactive POS anchored...
---
Thanks for this info, it’s good to get to know other alliances/coalitions a bit more.
---
But about Brave you’re right, we mostly stick around catch as a lot of people constantly stop by for a quick fight, so most of us don’t really look for content as it comes to us apart from bunch of people roaming here or there, toasting and shit. But when a coalition ping goes off everybody seems to jump in for the fun, recently had my first tidi battle and it was rather interesting.
---
RNG. Can spawn in belts or in some sites. But i've never seen a dread spawn in a haven (in a site) leave that site. I know that belt rats can leave and go elsewhere but i didn't think they could go anywhere but gates and belts.
---
This is low key trash ngl
---
wat?
---
between 5-10% less
---
If only one or two frigates enter, it is still a gate and not exactly a trace, you may not have that added to you d-scan overview.
---
Snakes in general suck. You won’t get ganked in the site. You’ll get ganked on your way home.

Oh god, not the downvotes
---
We thought about the gate thing last night but CCP claims you can scan down cruiser &amp; frig traces. At least that's how I read it.
---
Filaments are the keys to Abyssal Deadspaces. Activating a Filament will draw the ship it was used on into the Abyss, leaving an Abyssal Trace behind. While no other ship can follow the trace into the Abyss (with the exception of the total of three frigate pilots of the same fleet for co-operative traces), these traces can be scanned out with combat scanner probes. As such, it may happen that other capsuleers are waiting for the ship that entered the Abyss to emerge again.
---
Beep Boop
---
&gt; Don't fit more than one kind of tank. Shield or Armour. Pick one.
---
Look at the mid-slot to low-slot ratio:
---
* more mids than lows = shield tank
---
* more lows than mids = armor tank
---
* same number of mids and lows = either armor or shield, but usually shield since damage increasing mods are low-slots, so shield leaves more room for them
---
&gt; Don't fit more than one kind of weapon.
---
Typically look at the weapon bonuses on the ship to get a hint what you should fit.
---
&gt; All rules are made to be broken.

Best way to learn is to try stuff, fail, and try something else.

Not a dreadnought. Basically a new class of supercapital ship that is bigger than the titans currently used by players (Promethean titans, as opposed to the far larger Iapetan titans that are kept exclusively by the empires).
---
come on .. at least explain what the picture is supposed to show

We added everything to our d-scan and overview during our testing. We could see the gate/trace if we were on grid but unable to see it on d-scan, nor were we able to combat scan it down.

GrAb some scanning skills &amp; PI skills
---
In wormhole space you want to be searching for ghost sites first and foremost. Never leave a data site un scanned especially in C4-C6 range. High class sounds scary but it’s mostly uninhabited &amp; nobody checks for teh ghostys. So they’re there. I’ve personally built a full ascension pod&amp; tons of wetus. 
---
Secondly you should be looking for C13’s mang. Frig hole only hole W/Wolf ray affects and C3 sites. Confessors do 1000DPS here, apply perfectly, are the biggest thing that can fit in here, are slippery, and carry a probe They’re like 100-200Mil tops. 
---
Other than that. The real isk in lower class space is PI. All wormhole space has the best planets in the game. My home hole being the best C5.
---
You can net about 2-3Bil a month from a good PI setup spread across 3 characters on one account. (Also cross train scanning skills incase you get podded out).
---
Use the PI as the base isk. Then hunt C-13’s and Ghost sites which can drop 5 Bil implant BPCs. 
---
Here you just wanna get familiar with scanning. Really familiar. And start injecting towards a Naglfar. So you can join us in C5 space. A C5 yields about 2-5Bil per week in blueloot and it’s relatively empty.

Once your standings exceed 7.00 you can safely decline any non-burner mission. You can also accept the interceptor ones (Recom 1 and 2) to keep standings up and stack the missions until you finish 16 and run a storyline that bumps you up if you get too low.

Well the T1 variant already has high speed and agility, low sig and decent armor res. But the shocking slot layout destroys it's viability. Now the potential for the AF version is immense! Along with DPS ramp up this could be a giant killer!.. but all depends on the slots, will ccp fluff this? A TAC fleet would be fun if they get this right even solo would be fun.

The most important thing about earning ISK in Eve, is that there are many ways to earn ISK, so make sure you participate in one you ENJOY doing!

---
The same mentality comes to Eve online. If you’re not flying the best ships for the role, You’re gonna lose your ship and all your isk man. You’re putting yourself at a disadvantage by flying ships that can easily be outclassed, and thats before the confidence boost that you get from winning fights.
---
At least New bros have a chance of winning a fight with ships in the Cancer tier. The Oracle bringing most projectable DPS than any other ship in its class and the Keres being the best EAS both being cancer ships too.

It’s a really good ship to learn the game from.

Well if you don't have do defense ops and your landlord doesn't bother either, will what are you paying rent for? It really sounds like you'd be better off actually being in an alliance rather than renting. You'd have to do CTAs sometimes but then you can make isk in peace the rest of the time, and bonus people won't shit on you for being renters.

Drifters roam planets so maybe they have similar mechanics.

“Reworked” was just their codeword for cancelled. Which sucks, I kinda liked DUST 514, even though it looked and ran kind of terrible die to the PS3. Maybe their slogan “EVE Forever” actually means “Only EVE, forever”.

Not helpful at all, but my favourite chronicle is:
---
[Jita 4-4](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/jita-4-4-1/)
---
&gt; carrying anything expensive
---
a logi alt is allways a +
---
RLMLs aren't OP. They can't even remove an AF from the field when they're supposed to be the dedicated anti-frigate weapon system. And once you can't one clip something, it's pretty poor DPS you get out of them.
---
imagine thinking things are supposed to look this way
---
Other way around. The dread-sized render was the scaling mistake. It's bigger than a fortizar
---
T2 hauler (to fly both DST and BR), to haul stuff (most notably: pvp ships) from Jita to your main, either to lowsec or a wh. (For nullsec, use JF services.)
---
If I were to start again, that would be my first and most important alt again.
---
it's bad when you try to diversify where you keep your money by scattering it into the ocean
---
I can't way to see what money pit CCP throws all of our subscriptions at instead of buying more eve devs.
---
....oh jeez.  well.....sansha is gonna die...again.
---
You can bubble the gates, in which case only an interceptor can get to you quickly.
---
The only thing you're really scared of is a cyno, and that's really the problem.
---
Autopilot = Death
---
I always thought the Wyvern looked way cooler backwards.
---
keep crying goon, they're done for
---
Cough Loki cough
---
They might even be going after the drifter hives
---
It being in-character makes it more annoying though.
---
One of it's biggest problems is that it only has 2 mid-slots, so it can't web targets to hold them in blaster range. Couple that with being slower then a saber and not getting more tank then a Heritic means it doesn't fill any role that another dictor can do better. The only advantages are its DPS, and the number of low-slots means it can just barely fit things like a 50mn or an expanded probe launcher, and none of these are useful for a dictor in most contexts.
---
Cyno alt x 10
---
Were you exploring in HS? The best money is in null-sec, though you can make good ISK in WHs as well. If you can fit a cloak it's great, but you can make it work without one as well, you just need a bit of experience and need to always watch d-scan.
---
He said the N word
---
If you mean a FAX alt, sure.   
---
But doing sub-cap logi isn't usually something most folks can multi-box, unless your main is a scout/dictor.
---
it's very much okay if you buy nothing.
---
It depends on what they are doing, but a hauler/trading alt is always good. Cloaky eyes are great for living in a WH, and a FW alt can be fun if you just want to spend a day whelping frigs but don't want to wreck you sec status/standings or move your main. There is also the obligatory cyno alt if you have somehow gotten into capitals without training any alts yet.
---
Also, if you bubble gates, you have to worry about cloaky Lokis hiding inside the bubbles and killing you when you enter/leave a system. 
---
So yeah, I guess you’d have a point if cloaks didn’t exist
---
Command Destroyer &amp; Skirmish links alts are great for elitepvp
---
You know if it was just him that was banned...maybe, MAYBE I could see CCP possibly mistaking something....but 2 other people were banned...from his Alliance...for profiting off something allegedly only CCP and the CSM would know about.  
---
EVEN IF HE DIDNT DO SO INTENTIONALLY....  
---
He shared NDA'd information with someone and got caught doing it. Whether it was another player...or it was CCP who did the catching is irrelevant...he and 2 other alliance members got banned for it. That just shows them being utterly stupid.  
---
Do that shit on alts out of your main alliance like everyone else who violates the NDA.
---
What time do you live in? Its 2019 - especially the girls!

---
ye pretty shit, going from a newbie clan to one of the strongest forces in eve... and probably you didn't realize, one that is all the time providing content
---
I had to wait until my shoulders stopped shaking with laughter.
---
Dude, against that, I’ve got nothing.
---
Mercy!
---
Oh god. Stop. Your terrible. Leave the spin to mittens.
---
It's not worth arguing. He hasn't had a kill in over a year. Probably doesn't even still play.
---
As far as I can tell, each article in the chain reference each other starting with “mothballed”, then “canned”, and now “cancelled.

Something tells me this is just a filler article.

Some assembly required.
---
I do. It's neat.
---
Vedmak has actually a couple variations. Here is the base fit that I use
---
\[Vedmak, \*Simulated Vedmak Fitting\]
---
Corelum B-Type Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane
---
Entropic Radiation Sink II
---
Corpum A-Type Medium Armor Repairer
---
Reactive Armor Hardener
---
Thukker Large Cap Battery
---
Tracking Computer II
---
Dark Blood Cap Recharger
---
Gistum A-Type 10MN Afterburner
---
Heavy Entropic Disintegrator II
---
Small Remote Armor Repairer II
---
Small Energy Nosferatu II
---
Small Tractor Beam II
---
Medium Nanobot Accelerator II
---
Medium Auxiliary Nano Pump II
---
Medium Capacitor Control Circuit I
---
Hobgoblin II x5
---
Vespa II x5
---
Tracking Speed Script x2
---
Occult M x956
---
Mystic M x887
---
Nanite Repair Paste x150
---
On this you can change some stuff out. I keep armor rep for drone repair between room jumps and a small NOS for faster cap recovery when on drifter or drone battleships. Tractor beam to pull occasional cache wreck but more often for drill site wrecks to pull them out of their asteroids etc. this saves me quite a bit of time on that. but you can really put whatever you like in your highs.
---
This is a really high DPS fit, its fly fast, often OH your tank and prop. Everything dies fast though but you gotta pay some serious attention to what is happening around you. Keep vedmaks at 24+km as much as you can and use Mystic ammo on them, so you'll need to OH your Ab for about 2-3 cycles at a time to give yourself the distance. 
---
On Leshak spawns, OH prop for 3-4 cycles but no more, you wanna save some heat and not burn out your prop. As you are closing in retain minimum of 270 transversal, meaning come at an angle or easy curve inwards if you use orbits. The ammo you can switch instantly from Mystic to Occult, so you can open up with Mystic at longer range and switch to Occult when you are close enough.
---
You can switch out 1 of the DPS sinks in lows for either a second EANM or a second rep. If you go double rep also switch out the nano accelerator rig for a second Aux Nanopump. the double rep fit has issues with full neut spawns. If you are not comfortable with cap management do not use it. You can also switch out the RAH for a second EANM but the resist loss is quite noticable but you gain a lot better cap stability making it easier on neut spawns.
---
When making fit adjustments it is important to keep active modules spaced out and not next to each otehr as much as possible due to the way overheating and heat damage works. Especially your prop and tank.
---
For implants
---
Squire Capacitor Operation EO-605
---
Ogdin's Eye Coordinator
---
Squire Capacitor Management EM-805
---
Lancer Gunnery RF-905
---
Noble Hull upgrade HG-1005
---
Rest you can fill out with mid or high grade Asklepian as you can afford them. Don't worry too much about the full bonus. These are jsut to give you a bit of a bonus while not leavign useless empty slots. Something useful is better then nothing.
---
Boosters:
---
Standard or improved Exile as your wallet can afford and as you feel comfortable with side effects
---
Hardshell II or Hardshell III as you feel comfortable and can afford - these stack with Exile.
---
Pyrolancea II or Pyrolancea III but only if you go double rep fit and you will not be using Hardshell as they override each other since they're both on booster slot 11. Otherwise stick with Hardshell.
---
I see, that makes sense.. Should of looked at the slots before questioning haha, so in other words it’s pretty damn useless..
---
CCP takes their fucking time to ban someone. What makes you think they jumped the gun this time?
---
Make sure you use a referral code, you get 750k SP now, saves you several weeks on training :)
---
They should make a separate team locked away from everyone else and shouldn't be allowed to release anything til its 100%😂
---
Wait...why is it to late to learn to PvP? Who said that?
---
I do have a few remaining specialized alts after over 10 years:
---
* Cyno alts
---
* Manufacturing &amp; research alts
---
* Holding-corp alts
---
All the other alts (I have 4 annually subscribed accounts), can pretty much pilot any ship, though some are a bit better at things than others.
---
My first alt I call 'my shadow'.  His job is to make my life easier.  He started doing that by hauling while I mined, and salvaging missions.  Eventually he became a perfect booster alt, rorqual pilot, and all things capital and jump drive (including Black Ops).  He was started roughly a month after I started playing Eve.
---
Don't make an alt unless you need an alt for something.
---
Wait is he dead or did he just leave?
---
There's LOADS of things to do:  
---
 [https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post\_img/eve-career-chart.jpg](https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg)
---
This is fun to watch, not gonna lie, Elo turning the Asians into the demons of the south is pretty fucking great.
---
https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg
---
The wyvern is a useless fucking super but goddamn does the hammer look good.
---
It can be fun solo, like an expensive catalyst. It is also the only ship that is comms tanked. "Guys, I've got an Eris on d-scan?", "An Ares?", "No, an Eris.", "What's an Eris?"
---
If you bring in enough bacon.
---
The workings of all the good spy programs are kept under wraps, thats why they work, part of the effectiveness is not knowing what they're capable of.
---
Example, the GIA was always very high profile, they got some good people in some wild places and had a hand in some really nasty crippling events, they were considered to be a threat to everybody in EVE.
---
In my time running PL's program they were quite literally my biggest threat, at least in my mind.  We even went so far as to put people in place to spy for Goons so we could try and get a look at internal programs but "handlers" were always a dead end point that stopped the flow of information.
---
We swapped to something similar after one particular spy went bad and burned a few other spies on his way out the door.
---
However, when Endie moved over to PL from Goons he shed some light on the GIA and its internal workings....or lack there of.  Turns out we were spending nearly 60 billion a month on spies and spying accounts around EVE to see everywhere, and in the end, we were literally the only ones doing that.  It turns out that there were times when he said it was actual effort to get even 10b devoted to that same cause over there.
---
So in the end we were fighting to stay on top of something that didn't even really exist.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/93583301/ 5/7 flair bait
---
Exactly this.
---
Most nullsec sovereignty warfare is boring blob-on-blob n+1 stuff. Specialization in EVE is the only way to feel like you're not a cymbal-clapping monkey. The mindless stuff (DPS, links, PvE and industry) is great if you're multiboxing or doing something more interesting in the background, but EVE always presents challenges which require more attention and skill (scouting, tackling, logi work, competent ewar, FCing, coordination, etc).
---
Take advantage of a new player organization (I like Pandemic Horde, obviously) which will teach you how to fly cheap ships. Learn to krab right off the bat (from the same org) or drop $20 on PLEX to buy a bit of SP and a raft of ships. Lose a load of them and learn about mechanics along the way. Being able to teach yourself is a big plus since the big groups have lots of searchable tutorials/info.
---
If you're socially skilled and make yourself useful then you can help in the decision-making and planning part of the game, too, if that strikes your fancy. It takes a while to build trust, ofc.
---
The most significant change in character progression since the launch of the game is Skill Injection:
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skill\_trading](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skill_trading) 
---
As several others have told you, though, SP only allows your character to *use* the relevant ships/modules/items, it doesn't teach you *how* you should (and shouldn't). That comes from reading (or watching, or listening) and experience.
---
yes, a different bug still persists
---
no, just remove local
---
local is trash tier counterplay
---
you can just dock up the instant anyone hostile shows up
---
bad gameplay
---
True, and yet, look at all the screeching from the old people about instanced PvP ... its not that it isn't hard, its the screeching.
---
I really wish they would properly do dust on PC so we can fight for resource allocation on planets. That was such a novel concept. PS3 exclusiveness fucked it alongside poor optimization.
---
Fair point about nullified T3C. I've edited my post. But even so, a nullified T3C is giving up combat capability for the nullification and isn't that much of a threat. In J space there could always be someone there in a cloaked ship and people still rat there.
---
If you don't want to PvP, mine or run missions, there are still plenty of options. I know people who all they do is market trade, there are also incursions, abyssal sites, or build stuff.  If you already explore just get an astero (or battle heron) and you can easily learn to hunt as you explore. As far as corps accepting alphas, it depends on the corp. Some don't as you what they do can't be done without omega skills, many corps are happy to accept alphas, particularly the biggest newbro corps.
---
1. If it looks too easy, it's bait.
---
2. The best and most helpful brand new corpmates are the ones that will totally fuck you over when they get roles.
---
3. More bling will not make you insta-win. It helps a lot less then you expect.
---
4. There's a lot more to flying then clicking approach or orbit.
---
5. Solo PVP is \*all\* about range control and dps/tank ratios, in that order.
---
As does life.
---
Thanks for the correction. I remembered it was between two of the citadels,  remembered the wrong 2 apparently.
---
The CEO changed as well though didn't he ?
---
&gt;But he did
---
based on the word of CCP? lmao
---
Made me chuckle, might as well give it a try.. Though can you even fit tackle on it?
---
I just recently got back into it after a couple years and have no idea what I'm doing. Would love the help!
---
Jesus Christ you pulled literally every word of that out of your ass, didn't you? Why even reply when you have so little understanding of the organization you're trying to talk shit about? You do know memes and Reddit sperg do not accurately represent what something is, right?
---
whatever you want
---
Because if you start camping a j space system, you have no idea if people are going to be ratting there in the next few days, let alone hours. If you run around certain nullsec pockets you plenty much guarantee you’ll find people. 
---
And while a nullified Loki isn’t that great at combat, it’s very good at not getting caught (even you you run bait VNI you’ll end up dual webbed and unable to get close enough to scram), and still packs plenty of dps to kill a normal ratting VNI. 
---
Stratioses are also a possibility, they aren’t as common now but without local they could slowboat out of bubbles while cloaked. They’re still good enough to kill a ratting VNI and neut out and escape a bait one
---
You loose isk on skillfarms atm.
---
I liked Dust 514 well enough and agree that it would have been much better off on PC, but I think the average age of EVE players is late twenties or early thirties. That's my demographic, and I'm not really playing many shooters anymore, and nor are my cohorts.
---
I'd be much more interested in a grand strategy or 4X or even an RTS or TBS set in New Eden. Or, fuck, a small roguelike thing like FTL with EVE flavor.
---
Does Nergal have something to do with SergalJerk?
---
Sort of, I've seen it fit with a MWD and web for hunting in NS, you rely on your bubble for tackle.  You can also fit it scram and MWD, but that is more for LS where you can't bubble, but still want to fly a dictor for some reason. I saw a video of it somewhere but can't seem to find it right now.
---
blueprints, send a ship to jita, buy minerals from 4-4 and sell it there
---
Tbh there are plenty of things you can do in eve, just depends what you are into.
---
- logistics, be it moving courier contracts, helping alliances get doctorine ships seeded where they are deployed when at war or on the offensive.
---
- 007, become a spai in alliances
---
- industrialist, craft modules, ships, drugs, structures etc, either in null, low or high sec
---
- pvp, join a pvp Corp and learn how to pvp and become a god in any ship
---
 
---
You can do all sorts really, without more info on what you enjoy to do it’s kinda hard to suggest things
---
&gt;  had no clue about PVP (it's too late to learn anyways) 
---
I still have no clue about PvP, and am still learning.
---
That doesn't stop me from doing it, nor having fun.
---
Exploration &gt; Fund PVP ships &gt; die in a fire
---
Rinse repeat until you git gud. At least that's what i'm doing, and i managed to get a kill with an imicus compared to literally dying every time i was locked up before.
---
And i'm sure any of the newbie nullsec corps would take you as alpha.
---
Once, 6 months into eve's release and its been downhill for decision making ever since, you can guess who was put in charge.
---
The age of making money on skill farms is gone forever
---
They should take the space, defend it, strip all the resources and leave, if they succeed then the resources dont respawn for a full month (scorched earth)
---
??? The guy I replied to isn't the same as the OP
---
And that automatically makes them botters?  Idiot.
---
It's not when every fail results in mass  downsizing/firings of their only successful project.  Esp when you keep doing it to the point you're on the verge of bankruptcy and have to sell out to some Korean cashgrab company.   That is the complete opposite of positive.
---
Dear CCP,
---
Take your existing minigames and turn them into games that don't require an eve client. Treading into the waters with minimal new game design, minimal new interactions with EVE, and a minimal investment.
---
* Make Project Discovery a phone game. I'd love to science while I poop.
---
* Make PI a Phone Game to set up and manage PI, with additional gamified interactions (think Fallout Shelter type game). Call it EVE Colony Simulator, Then when you play eve you can pick up your PI on planets. Allow non-eve players to 'sell' their PI to others for PI bucks to upgrade their space colony. Eve players still have to pick up the PI from the planet.
---
* Make a Web/phone puzzle game iterating on the mini-game for hacking. You are playing a researcher in hisec investigating whatever the new big bad is (sleepers/triglav/etc). The link to eve is you earn AI hack tools that can be redeemed on an EVE account that let you auto hack sites while data/relic hunting.
---
After you do this take a game concept and partner with a game studio that actually knows how to make games in that field. 
---
Your value here is your lore and art. Use it to make a game that fits in the universe and tells history of the game. This builds your brand and engages people in the world of Eve Online.
---
* Partner with someone like paradox to tell the stories of when the 4 empires were young with an engine like Stellaris uses.
---
* Partner with someone like Kalypso and make a game where you develop the economy of a new colony on the edge of known space. Balancing the needs of your corporate profits with the desires of the people.
---
* Find an Indie company to tell the story of the Thukker Tribe in a story in the vein of Homeworld with an art style of FTL.
---
Then and only then develop something grand internally. I don't want to be rude..... but your track record shows its not the best option.
---
Happens when you say grossly stupid shit.
---
When I lived in w-space, I would clear C5 gas &amp; mining sites with my alt.
---
I would warp-in solo, and start killing stuff.  I would then warp-in my alt to rep me, and assist in DPS.
---
The idea was to make the sleepers focus their energy neutralizers on the ship they were attacking.
---
That alt eventually became my heavy interdictor master, followed by all medium ships, and my primary PvP alt.
---
It was effectively canceled the second it came out and looked like Generic Scifi Shooter #43204582348234.  The time it would take to rebuild from scratch is not feasible, anyone with some sense saw the writing in the announcements that it was effectively dead.
---
if you could please warp directly into bubble and let me shoot you, I would very much appreciate it!
---
There's no trick to it. If the skills are in the Alpha skillset then they'll carry over; if not then they won't. I believe neither of those are Alpha skills.
---
SS fighters only do 1/5th the DPS to ships and structures. They are mostly used for killing drones and fighters.
---
It'd take some good AI to parse what elo says into actual commands to follow lol
---
Havens spawn dreadnoughts?
---
Do they have good salvage?
---
If you want to actually maximize your income from missions... https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/
---
You can compare isk/LP from every store and determine the most profitable. Keep in mind that the things you buy from the LP store have to actually have demand on the market, or they'll never sell and you never get your return
---
Never make the mistake of buying "things you need" with LP. Always convert it to isk through the most efficient goods and go from there
---
Wait what? Defending whom? There are pedos and nazi's, rasists, etc in both US parties? Where the hell do you get your information? When did I defend anyone? Calling people shit is defending people now? I will now ignore you, this is not the place to get political, nor are you capable of unbiased reasoning. Miner, please get help, you are a very angry person.
---
Die in a beautiful explosion or live long enough to witness somebody else’s ship explode 🙏🏽
---
is this video a cry for help? these fights are so horribly boring I don't understand how this can be fun.
---
That makes sense. I was thinking more from a strat-op fleet perspective.
---
No, WoD is responsible for them canceling their FUNCTIONAL WiS engine that was scrapped to make room for the tech demo they were trying to use for WoD.  The old old preview images of WiS were far better than the shite we got when they decided to go full retard and swap to the WoD "engine".  Not really even sure it can be considered an engine, since it is so badly optimized and resource intensive that it isn't really usable for anything except a dressing room.
---
Fake VHS overlay and grain looks bad 99% of the time and you can't change my mind.
---
Something most players agree on is that playing this game solo sucks. It gets boring and demoralizing. If you're willing to dip a toe back into EVE, I'd be glad to help you get back on your feet. If you want to fly with me and ask about whatever you want for a few hours, let me know. I like helping newbros more than actually playing the game nowadays.
---
No
---
For some reason the bubble went completely out of my mind, mwd and web doesn’t sound all that bad tbh, I’m actually interested to give it a try as I love the Gallente destroyers, thanks for the idea btw :)
---
Can you develop?
---
Gotta love that you keep trying
---
Or they could just fix some of the basic things that have been broken for 10+ years that badly hurt retention.  Like, the default overview, for the most obvious easy fix.  BUT THATS NOT SHINY ENOUGH FOR CCREEEEE
---
That's literally PVP over resources, my guy.
---
If incursion rats came in and started blowing up Keepstars because "the playerbase is refusing to fight eachother", that's when the magic will be extinguished and the sandbox is cemented over.  At least for me.
---
In that case yeah, this article is lazy at best. Just reiteration of what’s already been said before.
---
i'm in goons and i made a video praising the piloting of a pandemic horde pilot. does this count?
---
https://youtu.be/6-VM34GPygg
---
Both are alpha skills, but I’ve exceeded the soft 5 million SP cap, meaning I can only train them in Omega.
---
Oh don't worry, I fully expect them to jump on the Battle Royale fad bandwagon.  But its too early.  This is CCP, they don't start working on a fad game until after the genre has been played out.  Expect a PS4 exclusive EVE Battle Royal in 2027.
---
Going to tell you straight, I do this all the time and if I can do it literally any primate can do it.
---
Our creedo is to live fast, fight well, and have a beautiful ending." - [Saint Exmin of the Valkyrie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WklPABGo77k&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5263)
---
You are doing it now.
---
So, you can get all relevant skills to most frigates to IV or V after only a couple months. This means that you’ll be able to fly them at around 90+% as well as someone with max skills. Destroyers, the next biggest class, aren’t much worse. Obviously you’ll want some variety, but if you stick to t1 cruisers and t2/t3 frigates and destroyers, you’ll be able to become reasonablely competent in cruisers and have most destroyers/frigates mastered after a few months. 
---
And the way Eve works, big ships aren’t always the best for any given task. And even when they are, they need small ships to be effective. Bombers, antibombers (battleship and even cruiser sized guns will have trouble tracking bombers, so you have dedicated anti bomb ships, usually destroyers), electronic warfare (ewar), interdictors, scouts, tackle, are all important roles in a fleet that can be filled by new players. If you’re in the free to play state you’re a bit more limited, but you can still do ewar and tackle just fine.
---
Yeah, and I'm okay with that. Cool with me if they subsidize having multiple accounts, but shouldn't make you rich.
---
Yeah it seems like you don't really understand the culture in the KarmaFleet, or the Imperium for that matter. Theta is the spergy home defense for your big toys channel, but most people have their own Corp comms.  We are friends in KF comms, we all have things going on in rl and we meet up at the end of the day and hang out. Instead of having a beer together, we fly spaceships.
---
So our leader, Merkelchen runs multiple fleets a week, including a big drunken roam every Saturday night. He's also running the standing fleet to coordinate home defense every night and sometimes doing other sig/squad stuff. He's probably more active than the average KF member and he's chill as fuck. 
---
As far as raising a concern and having it addressed, I have a great example. I recently started reacting moon goo and found a nice low index system with a nicely rigged(T2) tatara. It was great but there was no cloning bay and I used those reactor alts as cyno alts as well. So I sent a ping to the gsol director in charge of infrastructure and asked how much it would cost to fuel the clone bay, and that I would happy pay to turn it on and keep it fueled, assuming it was offline because no one used it. He promptly responded back and said they'd turn it on and not to worry about fueling it. I thought that was pretty fucking cool and the next day, I had a clone bay to jump back to.
---
And as far as paps go, you could only show up to Saturday Night Swarm (our big Corp drunk roam) every week and have 4 times the required number of paps to stay in Corp. You don't ever have to go on a mainfleet op. You can deploy with any of the sigs and squads and do l33t peeveepee and have 10x as many as you need.
---
You should put an alt in KF and see how it really is
---
because it isn't a siege in any way at all and therefore is not beholden to siege module effects
---
&gt; What do you even do in this game? 
---
F5 reddit and spam troll posts
---
First the biggest blocs arent elite at all. Size nowadays just translates to the number of supers alliance can drop, which gradually decreases the number of sbcap action and average FC and pilot quakity.
---
Second is FRT proved time and again to punch above their weight - only this way they could climb the food chain ladder. Otherwise they would end up like GOTG or some other ratter alliance that feeds pretty average and downright bad fleets
---
Wait, a kill with an Imicus? Haven’t seen many of these
---
If there is even a slight range bonus, I'd love to see a 3/2/5 slot layout, similar to the Wolf or Retribution.
---
That's literally PVP over resources, my guy.  We didn't fight the moons.
---
I can go either way with condensing nullsec, I'm not smart enough to envision long term ramifications.  But I'm not fighting rats over space.  Game will have lost its magic at that point.
---
Nostalgia hitting me like a truck
---
Take regional gate, boom, you're in jump range of the entirety of PB.
---
Oh would u look at that my new background\~
---
Nice, I'm trying to understand it without any luck, let me check it more.
---
TRAIN. DREAD. ALTS.
---
It's more like the emergency hull energizer or whatever its called, not like the siege module at all fyi
---
You are giving Goonswarm a bad name by telling potential corps recruits they are on the Goonswarm blacklist and then extorting money from them as a deposit and then blocking them. Not smart at all boy.
---
Rhiload's video on the Talos is a fantastic answer to this question I think https://youtu.be/yMl9Xp4h-Fo
---
Thanks, I can learn the game there is no problem there but what do you do as a corp even if you join one? My main experiences with guilds in other MMO games were, higher guild members using me as a slave, I'm getting mad and talking shit to them and getting kicked.
---
Currently, the cost of using an ADC is that you only get the stats of a T1 DC when it is not active. Certainly, it can change the outcome of a fight if used properly, bus so can the webs of a dramial, or the point range of a guarmer. At this point it is a nice addition that make assault ships more then just a T1 hull with better resists, and a damage bonus. I don't see an reason that it needs to be nerfed. I can understand your complaint that it feels "free" but that isn't a balance problem as much as it is an aesthetics one.
---
No.
---
The ADC is a weaker capital hull energizer which you can use more than once. The CHE has no penalties. 
---
Do I think its too poweful? Not really sure, because it's one of the only reasons you would use HACs or AFs over battlecruisers or t3ds. Also it helps assault frigs act as a heavier tackle ship, while also helping both AFs and HACs resist alpha.
---
I ask myself that every day...
---
Here we are five years later, with a short break in between, and still loving the game.
---
I had no clue at first, it was just an opinion from encounters but then again I was bad and anything could of wow’d me. 
---
People say frat aren’t that good without their back up, but their recent bomber fleets seem to have been very well coordinated, not sure who was involved in them tho, didn’t pay attention to the BRs
---
Not solo kills, i put a hull tank and a expanded probe launcher on it and use it to tackle slippery stuff that warps tac to tac.
---
Sadus is a girl?
---
Neither I believe? He was removed from the public eye after the incarna debacle/monoclegate.
---
Which is sad, because to many he's probably still the face of CCP. He was like a mature CCP Guard.
---
It's a sandbox MMO. You do pretty much whatever you want within the means of the game.
---
The Jovian motherships were described to be over 4 kilometers in length, but the exact size is never specified.
---
&gt;*Because they were constructed at different times and have since been extensively upgraded toward separate designs, the motherships are not identical. They share the same basic design, however, each being over four kilometers in length with massive frames. They remain among the largest ships in the cluster.*
---
For comparison, Promethean titans have an average of 16.3 km in length.
---
Yep, FRT needed experienced FC who can guide the alliance
---
If the station is pushed into hull timer it turn off all the services. Usually it'll be in final reinforce for around a week before it's vulnerable again. At that point it will be destroyed or repaired. Not sure if modules are automatically onlined again if it repairs. Also not sure what happens to any BPOs that are in a structure that's being destroyed while researched like this.
---
I endorse this message
---
I don't believe you cna do anything until the structure is repaired or is destroyed in which case you get the BP's back from asset safey. Sorry! That's one of the dangers of using a player owned structure.
---
Does a player have to destroy or repair it?  Or does that happen on its own?
---
It was paused on 4/9.  So not a week yet.
---
The triglavians are theorized to be a subculture of the 2nd jove empire which maintained pockets of abyssal space (cuts in space time, little pockets) where they built entire solar systems and matter just like the talocans built anoikis. In this realm of the universe they constructed different areas to grow and learn by mutating themselves, like bacteria exposed to mini environments to drive evolution (ie mutaplasmids, jovian genetic engineering). 
---
The culture that became the triglavians watched over the "stasis people" of the 2nd jove empire, who went into anoikis and linked their conciousness to basically the matrix. After so many years, artificial intelligence formed inside that matrix wanted to be real and became the drifters, who basically farmed all the bodies of the "stasis people" to make their bodies now.
---
The triglavians have fought these artifical intelligences for generations, and sansha and his nation are technically the same route - AI that is basically programmed in human bodies.
---
For some reason, triglavians hate these AI. They have the rogue drones, sansha, and drifters coming into their space, and capsuleers now too. Its theorized that theres some "afterlife" the triglavians hint to being their abyssal deadspace, the "flow of viraj being threatened", as if they have some project that these artificial intelligences are trying to thwart.
---
As capsuleers have been entering "the proving", which means pockets of abyssal space that test capsuleers (triglavian culture again is focused on evolution, exposing to different environments to better create a new thing), the triglavians came to new eden to tell the capsuleers in these holoreels "this is our enemy, come help, this is what we are building". 
---
Thats what we know in a nutshell.
---
Alot of chronicles, the whole shit with jamyl sarum, the virus in semiki, they all explain how the artificial intelligence is starting to mess with new eden.
---
Really awesome scifi imho.
---
Agreed.
---
This is good advice imo
---
The attackers will have to show up during the period of time the structure is vulnerable to attack, then they can shoot the structure. If the attackers don't show up, or you fight them off, the structure will automatically fully repair itself
---
But what are your options, that's the question.
---
I had a calculus midterm today and I’ve been kinda struggling because it’s all this 3D stuff, but my friend asked me how I thought I did and I said alright and then he asked if I finished all the questions and I said yeah and he was impressed because all the other people he talked to who I think are smarter didn’t finish and I’m totally running on but it just made me feel kinda good
---
Well for me personally:
---
- Exploration
---
- Salvaging
---
- Ratting
---
- Some mining
---
- PVP as a tackler
---
What tends to happen is players directing newer players to activities who have lower income but need to be done to sustain an alliance.
---
Most activities sound pretty bad. If you take salvaging for example, you would partner up with a big combat ship and loot the enemies he kills. Totally a lame support role, right?
---
Wrong! In reality, salvaging is very profitable and is easy for new players to do. While it does not give much combat experience, it's a great way to get the hand of movement, targeting, spacial awareness and it provides materials for a portion of the market.
---
If you join a group that treats you as a slave, make sure they're actually being rude before talking shit. A lot of content in EVE is repetitive, and you might be treated nicely by your alliance mates.
---
If you want to form a fleet and fly with me for a few hours, no commitment, I'd be glad to help you get oriented to the activity you like most.
---
This is info based on ~7d, decided to share if someone curious about wh activity distribution.
---
You do stuff in space with spaceships and sometimes other people join in, but not all the times, sometimes you do stuff in a station with nobody.
---
For the past 2 weeks &gt;90% of the ratting in PB is a single buy running 4-6 groups of smartbomb ratters at once, and he's definitely a bit suspicious although he is at his computer a fair amount
---
GLA POSTAL SERVICE.
---
Get a probe or any T1 exploration frigate. Train up scanning skills. Put combat scanners on said frigate. Scan down t2 drones, loot wrecks, and salvage. 
---
You can easily make 100mil isk an hour if it’s a busy weekend in the militia zone. The hard part is stashing and transporting the goods.
---
I must be misunderstanding the alt rule.. so you CAN have alpha alts?
---
https://i.imgur.com/C9LW8vK.png
---
yep, definitely not brigaded
---
Great fight. 10/10 would die again.
---
Uhm, someone else sent that image too but I don't even understand what am I looking at. For example hacking, I remember finding sites by exploration, is that related to hacking? There wasn't hacking system when I played the game.
---
I won't PVP or missions so I can build ships and stuff but I guess that needs some money I guess.
---
it always feels like coming home when i get back into eve after a long break. always nice to return :D
---
Buy buy buy

Yes.  You just can't have them logged-in at the same time.

Oh my people having fun with their friends, this cannot stand. Thankfully we have you here to be a little bitch about it!

Trig themed mobile game!

AAR: formed Goku for a Horde Fortizar in Etherium Reach. They brought a BS fleet and quickly dropped carriers. With some more logi we might have tanked even better. But was a fun fight nevertheless.

Haha, the ELITEe

---
Removed for brigading. Sorry pgl!
---
Wow, that looks like a really friendly neighborhood!
---
Pore: `To gaze intently, `To read or study attentively` (usually used with *over*).
---
It takes a slot that be used for something else  and it has a cooldown. Two downsides right there. If you are the kind of person that doesn't think taking a slot is a downside then you need to familiarize yourself with "opportunity cost."
---
That being said, I could see some kind balancing involving resource costs (ammunition/fuel).
---
As it stands, it makes ADCs stand out on a mechanical/strategic level which is a good thing overall.
---
I thought items in research/production were dropped when a structure is destroyed, not put into safety?
---
Whelp I'm an idiot. Thanks for clarifying :)
---
I was on the edge of my seat during the whole video. Those fights could've went either way with a single mistake or missclick. Thanks for sharing.
---
You too can find a new life in the newly opened and protected systems of Period Basis! Would you like to know more? Talk to an agent today!
---
you can have all the fun you want, but asking for upvotes is just sad
---
I actually have (had) decent understanding of the game, I did some PvE, I even attacked someone (in Hi Sec and died) once. I also had some money so I don't think I will have much problem, I'm just trying to understand what would I do if I start playing the game again.
---
For example, what people do in corps, only PVP?
---
&gt; If you want to form a fleet and fly with me for a few hours, no commitment, I'd be glad to help you get oriented to the activity you like most.
---
Again, thanks, I really don't like bothering people, you probably don't get bothered by new players but I don't want to depend on anyone.
---
They have an alt in a nullsec corp
---
You and your corps are ripping people off in Eve, not cool bro.
---
Interesting data.
---
I know exactly how WoD was responsible for WiS.
---
It was a test bed for the features they planned on having. They had ZERO interest in allowing Capsuleers to walk around in stations, until they started the WoD project. And once it flopped, they lost ALL interest in maintaining or expanding on WiS. That's why it never went any further than the studio apartment. And why it eventually got deactivated entirely.
---
They have, however, discovered that people will still pay good money for the clothing. Even if it's only for dressing up your paper doll and posing for your driver's license photo.
---
So no, I am not happy they dabbled in WoD, and that let us have a glimpse at what WiS could have been. I'm pissed off that they only bothered to give us 1% of a feature people have been after since the beginning. And they took it away when they were no longer interested in it. Who cares what the player base wanted, they were done with it.
---
Yup, there's a little hacking mini-game.   
---
It's sorta like minesweeper.  You use a Data Analyser or Relic Analyser on the cargo thingy at the explo site and the mini-game opens. If you win, magical loot pops-out.  It can be a solid way to make ISK.
---
Bastion is subcap siege
---
So it's actually same thing with exploration but there is an extra minigame. Cool, I like that.
---
That is awesome that you have the ratting numbers for an entire region and you know it is a single guy.
---
Again, not proof of botting.
---
♥
---
It depends on the corp. And the people in the corp. A large corp will have people who do every activity in Eve, and so there will be PvP in the form of roams or gate camps, there will be group mining sessions (the best ones involve voice chat and alcohol) and there will be groups clearing combat sites together. If the corp is big enough you'll probably find a few industrialists sharing info and splitting market demands between themselves.
---
Almost everything you can do alone you can do with others, and there's a lot of stuff you can only do as a group.
---
Cool graphic, the bottom row could be labeled better though. I recognize the WH IDs, but have no idea what they are representing. I love to see stuff like this though.
---
Finally! An ad that tells who to contact! Mail Sadus, not CD! Lol.
---
Main account - on the 2 spare slots, a jita and amaar character. If you live in null, or plan to, your corp/alliance probably has a freighter service. Having characters already in the market hubs makes life easier for yourself. Put as little or much into Trade as you like.
---
2nd - on 2 slots i have 2 cyno interceptors. Both of mine have cyno5 and can fly Stealth Bombers. Train all races or just 1. Find a fit and train the skills to make it work. Throw some extra into Navigation to lesson the chances to get caught. 
---
The other slot you put what you need the most, salvager, freighter, capital, miner, etc
---
3rd? -  have 1 slot with a cyno ceptor. being able to move your Carrier/Super/Dread around if you miss a move op is very handy. Also another set of cloaky eyes is nice for alliance/corp.

I'm fairly checked out, haven't been playing in a while. Is that really the death knell of init? Surely such a large and by all reports competent group can survive? Was this jackoff lobbyist actually space important?
---
Over a decade, Eve still here. I think you have your head up your ass that he is not competent.
---
I think the fact we are still here shows he is.
---
Probably not. They just photoshopped "period basis" over an existing [box art.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a27205ef9a61e22d60eb049/5a2722039140b7dc522c0139/5ac277da0e2e72f80c535b6a/1522698178244/Welcome-to_Cover_Flat_1080.jpg) Original artist is mad talented tho.

so he'll be camping period basis instead of delve?
---
oh no, pwease don't interfere with our lucrative rental region. anything but that.
---
&gt; That's literally PVP over resources 
---
If the rats are almost Concord like you're not fighting rats over space. You are moving...and fighting other players over viable nullsec space. It's just now that space is the resource you are fighting over. My guy.
---
I breath goon penis but only ironically
---
Yes, did not think about it... Bottom row represents which statics wh had. So for Class 1 most of kills happened in C1 wormhole with static Z060(null-sec)

Well after alot of reserch i found that most of you are wrong.

Refuge and hideaway's give ded 4 escalations.

Hiden Hideaway's (and other 2of the same kind) give ded 3.

Then you cuck someone elses girl, ship, structure or space.
---
&gt;Period Basis will work somewhat differently. The rental arrangement is as fair as you can be with the tools available in EVE Online. Renters will pay a minimal fee to join and be allowed access to Period Basis. There will be no monthly fees for rental.
---
&gt;The Imperium controls the region’s infrastructure. This allows the Imperium to tax those corporations using Period Basis for ratting and mining just like Imperium member-corps. Goonswarm has long possessed the internal systems to manage a region in this way.
---
&gt;Based on this design, corporations residing in Period Basis will not be limited to stay in systems they chose to rent. They will have full run of the entire region. Goonswarm will maintain control of most if not all moons in the area for Locust Fleet.
---
Thats pretty amazing. Good job.
---
&gt;but I don't even understand what am I looking at.
---
I understand. The chart is huge and they use a fair amount of shorthand. Linking it to you was mainly to show you there really was lots of aspects to the game. If you don't understand what something means, ask in the 'no stupid questions' threads.  
---
One note about PvP - there's lots of different angles to the PvP game. Solo is different from small-group (3-10) stuff, and also very different from fleet-based stuff (50 up to 1000's or more pilots). EVE is also different in that it's PvP isn't very twitch-based. It's more rock-paper-scissors, and winning is a matter of figuring out ways to be both a rock and paper, while forcing your opponent to be just one thing.
---
I’d like it too ^

Please re-read my post and let me know where you find me arguing that he is conclusively a botter. You're going to struggle to do so, because I didn't. What I did do, is provide information on the situation so that the discussion can be more fruitful.

I don't think they were near bankruptcy or had to sell out? I think they built a company from nothing to being worth apparently 400 some odd million dollars.

it's crazy how small the fight are in WH, if you aim for small/medium gang battle, that's really the space for it, will save this graphic thanks dude :D

I believe the materials for the jobs in progress drop, but the BPO's get moved to asset saftey

Okay, cool. I've already downloaded the game it seems I have tiny bit of money and a Vexor, I will try some exploration if I can remember how. Thanks.
---
&gt; One note about PvP
---
Well If I'm going to PvP it will be in a corp, that's for sure. Probably I won't be able to do much still better than nothing I guess.
---
If they really wanted to do VR a homeworld-like VRRTS with Eve ships could be very cool.

&gt; The myth of rental consent:

What is his product competing against besides itself? Star Citizen and Elite haven't stolen nearly as many subs as boredom and frustration, and neither are even close to replacing Eve.
---
If it repairs, you’re jobs will continue as long as it still have fuel to keep the module offline, if it’s destroyed, you’ll have to recover the BPOs from asset safety.  You will lose the research progress from the current job and isk spent on the job, but that’s all.  If you were manufacturing something, you’d lose the materials.
---
Well, you actually pointed out why I wanted this data.
---
I chose which wh is best for purpose.
---
Nothing better than workforce housing, or as they say in the oil fields of Texas "man camps".
---
Crying about upvotes is even more sad.
---
Nah, still sounds dumb.
---
I THINK HE'S WAITING FOR YOU TO POST PROOF OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
---
Wouldn't want anything to threaten the krabbing
---
But then they shouldn't have bounty or even salavge material so they are only a pain in the ass and not another method to print isk.
---
Exciting. Thrilling.

This is my biggest weakness as a pilot. Lost more than one Garmur that way.
---
The article is misleading. Read further into the links, it basically just says what they said about it earlier; it wasn't ready to be put out to alpha after the gameplay video, and as a result they're continuing to work on it behind closed doors.
---
Just to clarify for you a bit, exploration is the process of finding relic and data sites to hack and loot for profit. Hacking is the actual process of playing the mini game to unlock the loot, so exploration is an activity, hacking is the mini game you play to unlock the loot :)
---
tl;dr: we will be milking and cripling EVE so we can spend your money on useless shit which we dont have any clue how to do it or why to do it.

One thing I'll say: I honestly really like going out with 100+ people in a fleet. There's something about flying with a giant swarm that's fun for me.

I seriously dislike this "contact xyz"-stuff. Why not just tell us what the deal is?

is it crying to simply point out that it happened
---
&gt; Also not sure what happens to any BPOs that are in a structure that's being destroyed while researched like this.
---
Asset safety covers all bpos.

Hello JebusPrice, i heared you are in search for a new Corp in EvE-Online- We would like you to join our Public-Channel to discuss your application.

To add on to this, Zkillboard is a great tool in wormholes for assessing the risk you’ll find in a given wormhole. You can look up there system name to see whether or not any activity has taken place recently. If there have been recent deaths, you can dig more to find out whether or not the hole has active residents and how inclined they are to kill an explorer.
---
My list:

Z
---
Cyno alt
---
Rorq alt(s) that double as reaction and hauler alts.  
---
Burner puller alts

Renting **is** outdated, which is why our advanced socialist state is offering low-cost subsidized housing to the oppressed proletariat. In period basis the poor tenant serfs will be liberated from their capitalist rentiers, freed from their oppression.

Even if a goon hates pvp there’s plenty of non-shooty things that people get papped for.
---
But grrr gons and all that
---
what if you plugged in longer time frames for this data
---
Nowadays it doesn‘t matter too much anymore. Just go for the one that appeals to you most regarding to lore or looks. You can fly all of the ships and use all modules regardless of faction.
---
That's not a bad idea. Make the reward the fact that they aren't there anymore.
---
but we're not talking about bastion
---
The ragnarok always escapes.
---
awww cute.. a feel good post by Tapi
---
Answer: Anything you f'in want(EULA notwithstanding). Use your imagination.
---
An out of corp alt that flies a DST that you can keep in a trade hub is a blessing.
---
Btw frick C4s
---
Honestly in the end it doesn't matter. It will affect your early-game (first week or so), so pick whatever you think looks best for now.
---
Because CCP is Constantly Counter Productive. I mean it's pretty much a given.
---
Reminds of of my 1st newbie industrial loss in Aunenen but way waaaaay worse
---
noob frigate versus capital ship
---
be funny first
---
caldari
---
Keep fighting the good fight globby, someday, someone, somehow will understand what makes you this way
---
Would be interested to see stats without evictions.
---
I'm thinking of coming back as well. Any big changes? I haven't played since the "cumming a fair amount mind you" meme was around.
---
Minmatar. Cute girls, ships with too many guns and no tank. That sense that everything you fly looks cool but is held together with duct tape.
---
Can't go wrong.
---
I wonder what the cost of all of those skins would add to the loss?
---
Thanks for so many tipps
---
If you have killmails for longer time frame - I sure can do it.
---
zkb provides only 20pages x50kills = 1000 last kills in wh. So I just daily saved content of this 20pages for ~7days to gather this 4413killmails I used.
---
C'mon man, no one ever bought anything that wasnt sold to them. If you're really interested it's a much better deal than the competition and the pricing is not some kind of secret.
---
Nice vid, nice song synchro.
---
Maybe this new trig Cannon is supposed to help take down citadels faster? :)
---
Sound sexy
---
A bunch of us in the r/eve discord were discussing this and an idea that we came up with was for the ADC to double or triple the mass of the ship using it. This would mean that you would need to think about whether you will need to turn after using it, would mean that ADCing could make you drift off anchor in fleets and could mean that ADCing could lose you kills as you are now incredibly unmanuverable.
---
C6 confirmed krabholes? I'm a bit surprised there is so much activity in C1 space, I thought C1's were supposed to be relatively dead due to the low payouts &amp; pain in the ass logistics?
---
Ammar get hoodies.
---
The one that looks best to you!
---
Kinda goes to show how much activity a Kspace hole adds to a wormhole.
---
yeah because sitting 1000 km away from a forced warp in point siphoning isk off people's ratting ticks in a nullified hull and just leaving when enough people to kill you show up is such great "content"
---
&gt;  And once it flopped, they lost ALL interest in maintaining or expanding on WiS.
---
What I get from that article is how the two basically flopped together, and how WiS was at minimum partially responsible for the WoD flop among other things it touches up upon, like shift in business model which has greatly affected game development resulting in a lot of the problems which are present today.
---
I can't upvote because it doesn't have Sadus talking as Grand Nagus.
---
&gt; the pricing is not some kind of secret.
---
So... um... where do I find those prices?
---
1- Determine what your primary eve career will be.
---
2- Spec your main accordingly (depends on 1 and what corp/alliance you join, as they will have specific doctrines that you will have to prioritize training for).
---
3- As a total newbro say joining a newbie friendly corp in nullsec, you would need a neutral alt in Jita to buy stuff and ship it to your main through your alliance jf service.
---
4- Once you start doing pvp and want to help the fleet more, your 2nd account character can ceptor-&gt;dictor, and take it from there.
---
Typically at end-game you will have dedicated characters for every facet of the game, something your career will determine, i.e your need will drive you not our answers.
---
some of them are the crap ones handed out in events like the christmas day long in thing, but a few of them should be pretty pricey.
---
New/small corps have an initiation fee of 1b.
---
Structures are provided for you.
---
Free access to the entire region.
---
Contact Sadus for more info!
---
There was a c1 eviction a few  days ago.
---
Looks like C4 is the class to be!
---
C1s only ever have Kspace statics which make them a lot easier to access, which tends to lead to a lot of activity since they’re used as transit points. This also makes them pretty good for logistics if you live in one, since you only have to scan the static to get back to Kspace, which also means lots of industrial corps, which means lots of easy evictions. Since this data is just over the last 7 days, it’s definitely inflated the numbers for C1 wormholes since Wormlife just got knocked over and all of their stuff dropped, resulting in over 1k kills I think.
---
Says something about goons and PL to keep checking if we are still traps. Come out of the closet already. Our dicks will still be here waiting.
---
You specifically said to get rid of the botters, then say there is supposedly a single guy doing 90% of the ratting.
---
Where, exactly, are the botters in Period Basis you referenced then?
---
&gt;Thanks! And how do you go about finding one?
---
The PvP gates spawn and open at the end of 3rd room of An Abyssal site. They spawn only inside T3 and higher filaments and not always, actually most of the time you don't get one. So you have to run T3 or higher Abyss filaments, complete them, and then hop into a PvP room when a gate spawns for you.
---
You can do whatever.
---
Let’s say John wants to do some PVP. Being a member of Horde, he has access to a market with ships, modules, and implants. He buys a cynabal, some mods, and some dank implants to make him go fast. Thats one thing you can do!
---
You could also be the guy that builds the modules John puts on his ship.
---
You could also be the guy that mines the minerals that the guy above buys on the market to use to build modules.
---
The cynabal is a pirate BPC. You can run escalations people get from ratting to get some of the BPCs and sell them to someone who builds those ships.
---
You can kill NPC pirates in anomalies for ISK and sell those escalations to the guy above.
---
You can run pirate missions to get LP which you then convert to the implants John bought before.
---
Some of the modules john bought are faction mods not easily found in Horde’s space. So, you could be the person that buys them in Jita and sells them in Horde’s market at a bit of a markup.
---
You could also be the person that ships the above person’s faction mods to Horde space.
---
You can do lots.
---
Leave my vigils out of this!
---
Just noting some corrections:
---
- LUMEN has not been deployed to Pator. Like, at all. This isn't about a debate over whether what we're doing is dangerous or not, LUMEN straight up *is not there*.
---
- LUMEN *did* have significant deployments to Anath; is it possible the writing confused these? We're sorry to see the humanitarian mission to Anath didn't get any mention.
---
Honestly, the GRRCONCORD thing is getting really old in general. It feels like this has long since surpassed any ration or reasonable basis and gone into "we want CONCORD to look dumb" territory. If this isn't your goal, can I suggest they take a more multifaceted approach to different capsuleer groups?
---
Hey you need 220 vigils per fleet to make fighters apply well these days
---
Operated by some of the sexiest voices in New Eden!
---
This has been the case since they launched it.
---
Hoboleaks shows they're re-releasing the monocle. Better dump now.
---
that's kalevala btw, not etherium reach
---
If researching in a structure that you don't own (sometime's even if you DO own it!), consider not researching the max number of benefits in one sitting.
---
If you play/stay close but, set it for one or two levels only then go reset it (or get remote skills) when it's done. It saves you potentially losing a lot of research time if the structure does run out of fuel or getting blown up
---
Kiki are high DPS high tracking ships. their tank is OK and varies vs what of course. A Kiki with a good tank will not be doing that 1k DPS, that is a glass cannon fit. If you breathe on it, it will die. But of course you have to live long enough to breathe on it. They use a ton of cap and require a constant fire in order to reach their max DPS.
---
You can shut them down using neuts, dampeners, disruptors, ecm drones. LOL Ecm drones actually reek havoc on them cause they only need to disrupt once in a while so Kiki can never reach its max DPS. if you are up against a High DPS Kiki then use Explosive / Kinetic damage, if its a tanked fit then it will have these holes covered, but it won't be doign that DPS.
---
Why has no one bright up the freedom and idealism that the Gallente Federation offer and practice?!
---
Clearly the best of options for the clear minded and driven pilots.
---
I think you went home a little too soon ;)
---
I do not see simple way to filter evictions out, and eviction is kind of activity too.
---
I guess if I save data for 2-4 weeks - it'll be more representative.
---
Are you still too dumb to realize that I'm not the person who made the original post
---
God it's like I'm talking to a rock
---
Yea, that's tough, if you do decide to go after a Kiki in a frig, might wanna use a kiting frig with a damp. Once its damped stay outside its range. But it might be tough even then if its an active rep, low DPS fit.
---
I'm not sure how much more they can realistically grow eve. It's so old now that the game's design and business model are really, really alien to people coming in to the gaming industry today ("wait I have to pay to play this game ? I HAVE TO PAY EVERY MONTH ?!! And I can only unlock stuff by waiting IRL for months ??? Isn't there a lootbox or something I can buy to make it go faster ?"). The game's saving grace from the beginning has been the niche that it occupies but this by nature means it'll never be a hugely popular game.
---
The most infuriating thing about CCP is that they've got a world that people *know*. Even if few people play it, many many more know about the stories of betrayal, scams and epic fleet battles of eve. On top of that the game has interesting and deep lore.
---
It's actually quite surprising that they haven't managed to make a single successful spin-off game with these kind of assets, that requires a special level of bad.
---
He was proven guilty. We are not the judge and jury, CCP is.
---
CCP Please make eve great again!!!
---
gotta remember that in an eviction the shitty small ships are ejected and killed resulting in KMs. This will skew the data a lot especially for the C1 holes.
---
Yeah yeah you're all weirdos :P
---
Depends how the Drek is fit. If he is fit with some sinks in lows then you will have the advantage. If he is fit with nothing but tank and cap then he will have a slight advantage.
---
Judging by how they have handled this exact situation in the past, you won't be getting your laugh in.
---
And your data showing that most players are in nullsec is from where?
---
I second the recommendation for exploration. If you hardly made any ISK then you were doing it wrong. It behooves you to learn since a good explorer doesn't need to be Omega.
---
You forgot to mention where you welped the entire goku fleet... but yeah.
---
Did FC say jump?
---
And we're all laughing *right now* that there's still dumbasses like you who won't shut up about how not guilty your boy was, as if you do anything more than hit f1 when your ~~three~~ FC~~s~~  call for it. Like you have any fuckin clue lmao.
---
Eve is not like other MMOs, what faction you choose doesn't define your character for the rest of its existence. So choose the faction that most appeals to you.
---
After that, you can train into any ship/role you desire.
---
**how dare you even put that out into this universe**
---
Just adapt.
---
It matters a bit when 1st starting out. Later on you can actually have salvage drones runing around and salvaging while you still have like 25% of rats to kill. Don't spend any extra time on it as at this point you are way better off just going for the next mission, it gives way better income. There are also some specific rats that you might want to salvage, especially any of the elite faction rats. if its a faction rats and elite wreck, salvage it. As time goes forward stop salvaging altogether. You will see when as you progress and your income rises.

Join KarmaFleet (null sec newbie frienly corp). Get yourself in a small ship and fly to Delve (region). There are activities with very different gameplay involed. Pvp sounds 1337, but its moslty down to few important things at the start :
---
1.Get in a good tackle frigate (These are given for free already fitted)
---
2. Then make sure you can use all the modules that are already fitted in your ship (you can quickly buy the skills you need from the pop up menus on the modules)
---
3. Listen carefully on mumble or Teamspeak for the Fleet Commanders orders (right click on FC\`s name and click Add to Watchlist). Make sure you have quick access to warp and anchor on your FC!
---
4. Orbit broadcasted or called targets at 5000 (use W+click on target), activate your MWD and Scrambler - do your job cannon fodder! 
---
5. Look at other fleet members roles/ships - ask around if you wan to know what different people do in fleets.
---
  I personally live in null sec for an year  and from there I got access to a lot of groups and activities that never thought even existed. PVP is not only solo roaming on your own trying to be the best - you can be a spy, scout, Awoxer, logistics guy, cloaky camper, moon miner, industrialist, researcher of BPOs and even \*Mining\* fuel is a job.  Alll of those are mostly out of fleet jobs that help your Alliance get stronger and prepare to lose ships and recover their losses and keep on fighting.
---
Totally agree that it needs more Drakes.
---
Dread Alt.
---
can be up to 30 mil worth but the real value in dread spawns in the faction cap mod BPCs they can drop some are shit some are worth over a bill when built. You also get the parts to build those CPS as loot drops from dread spawns.
---
** n o **
---
Most of them are worth a couple dozen mil, but the VNI skin, and the Vindicator Skin add up to 400mil or somewhere about that. Still, the sheer number of skins dropped probably causes the total to be like 1bil or something.
---
This. It gets expensive repainting those things. You lose 3 or 4 dozen "volunteers" every time you need to buff a cruiser out of the hull.
---
I don't want spin offs, I want one Universe, one war, ccplz!
---
I hear dreddit is recruiting.
---
knife
---
But the point is they can attract or retain a wider player base by broadening what it means to play EVE.
---
[Torfi left for Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/in/torfifrans)
---
You noticed the caracal model but not the fine details on the wyvern? okay.
---
Yes, but probably not in the way you're thinking. An example would be freighter ganking. You scout the pipe until a juicy target comes through, then PvP it and loot the wreck. Others do something similar but instead of paying for gank ships they pay for wardecs. But unless your target is an overstuffed hauler or a blinged out krab, PvP is usually a net loss.
---
Details can be perfected by hand if you're good and spend enough time on it, but ratio is something very hard to get right without reference or modeling.
---
Great info and tips y’all!!  I appreciate the help!
---
So it’s only been 4 days since the research job was paused.  Is there somewhere I can check the timer on the station for when it will repair?  Or is it always 7 days after the initial damage?
---
Only if you're good at it - as a solo player. Being a pirate, by gate camping and hunting ratters that are ill equipped to fight while usually flying around very expensive ships is a better way to do things, but it's very difficult to break even fighting against ships that are prepared for fights. 
---
Mercenary work, like being paid to kill structures of hunt in a certain area does have rewards but typically involves being part of an established group. Large corporations and alliances, like Karmafleet and Pandemic Horde (to name a few) are typically pretty generous to newbies and will offer to replace many things for free, or straight up supply ships and let you keep the insurance payout. Combine that with any circumstantial loot you may happen to find after battlefields, and you can typically make some money going on fleets regularly.
---
You will be sad when they will be all debanned soon.
---
probably some weird ass anti-us foreigner, with a license for common sense
---
Which is really, really dumb, he's been in the job 16 years and his only success is not dying, which was due to others decisions after he devestated the player base with his monumentally stupid incarna decisions.
---
I get that you're a fan boy but damn, you have a really really low bar for competence.
---
You're expecting too much thinking from the average r/eve tard
---
Umm.  No.

at least elsewhere on the planet u can drink tap water without the fear of getting leukemia from drinking it
---
I've heard you can hack the structure with a data analyzer to find out. But idk if that counts as a hostile action in hisec.
---
Or you could just not discuss things covered under the NDA with people who aren't on the CSM like you agreed to do when elected...
---
Poor Yan...
---
... actual bittervet Shia LaBeouf?
---
He more or less admitted to doing "something" when he stated on a pod cast that it was starting to make sense what happened when he found out who the third person banned was. He may not have meant to break NDA but he seems to have realized he did.
---
ok
---
Also very true haha
---
🗿
---
Always lock the broadcast
---
If it's reinforced you should just be able to undock and look at it in space to see the timer.
---
Spy alts.
---
Late to reply here, but his in game name is Rediah Uchiha. He's been kicked out of several corps for being bad, never listening, and causing problems. He finally realized since he doesn't get along with others, he can just create his own corp and give himself a bunch of awesome meaningless titles:  
---

it can still be done from the broadcast window
---
First. I have a lot more in depth information about what’s going behind the scenes right now than you do.
---
Second. I hardly log in.
---
Third. When I do log in to F1 monkey. it’s the F4 key for my DD and it’s usually on a Blue.

Gosh imagine feeling so triggered to be so compelled to reply on all the dumbasses who post about this topic. Like you have any F’n clue lmao

this guy is banned
---
What surprises me the most is the volume of kills in C4-with-C3/C5-static systems. Was there like an eviction last week in a C4 C3/C5?
---
Amarr are like ISIS imperial, but in space
---
Gallente are like Hollywood , drugs and hipsters, but in space
---
Caldari are the rich part of the Republican Party, but in... you know, space
---
Minmatar are Freedom, ugly ships, weapons and sheeit, like \_iggas in space.
---
Choose Minmatar, choose your \_iggas
---
Everything about this whole event is covered by the NDA, so short of a brisc suing and winning a court case there's never going to anything made public besides the fact that 3 people were banned. Even if they do somehow get miraculously unbanned we are never going to be told what they were accused of leaking/exploiting because that would fall under the NDA.
---

No in game browser. Is there a 3rd party app or a workaround?

E.T. is the primary!
---
Oh my god the list just keeps scrolling
---
Is it possible or was it ever possible to access the cargohold of stored ships in a ship maintenance bay? E.g., if you store a T1 industrial full with boosters in your bay, will you be able to access them in combat? Or is this trick used purely for hauling?
---
From what I've seen, the only way to access them without docking is to eject the ship, board it, jettison the boosters and board your previous (probably expensive capital) ship again, which doesn't seem very practical. :P Am I missing something?
---
I chose Minmatar, I chose my _iggas

Why
---
Drust's issue with capsuleer groups involved in Triglavian matters has nothing to do with who is and isn't in Pator. Additionally, though it's not strictly relevant to the Pator point, he's an in-world character with has his own perspective which, as with other characters, may or may not be entirely reliable.  
---
Your feedback on CONCORD is noted but while the goal is not what you suggest that organization has a certain core mission in the world.  
---
This isn't to get into a debate with you about anything. I'm just pointing the above out. We can have another think about CONCORD now we've a got another couple of divisions to play around with though.
---
the fuck?
---
Camp the subreddit.
---
i shit post better then this
---
yeah minerals and the other stuff as well as  bpc's might drop/get blown up but bpo´s (at least in known space) go into asset saftey.
---
Hopefully 0 soon
---
Link a fit?
---
well that was a waste of time
---
This is the best course for the wayward newbro without a corp.  
---
Pick a region and make it your home.
---
Pick a ship you love, and can afford, buy what you need to keep going.
---
Then pick a path to making isk, getting content, military, explor, indy.
---
Military Agents are by far the most fun, slow crawl at first but doing things solo eventually it gets intense / fun.
---
If exploration is your thing, start queuing skills for scanning / data sites / hacking... Find wormholes, go inside, and learn to be a slick snake in space. Learn to use tools like tripwire / deep-safe.
---
If your a industrialist, start mining, instead of selling ore, start building stuff! Rather than trade stuff directly to jita, maybe find a local corp who will buy from you! Negotiate! Communication is the best part of the game!
---
Pick a cruiser you like, and start training for that as well, have a goal in mind! Where do you want to be in a week, a month. You have to set goals for yourself in EVE.
---
\- I want to fly a destroyer with T2 guns.
---
\- I want to be able to max my scanning skills, and get into an astero.
---
\- I want to fly battleships.
---
\- I want to make at least 1b isk.
---
\- I want to setup a production chain
---
Lastly, and BY FAR the most important advice.
---
Your EVE is your EVE! Do not compare how you play, what you do, to ANYONE else. You will always feel bad, there is always old hats making 20b an hour, afk mining, or ratting, there is always mega corps with thousands of players. You need to focus on YOUR version of EVE, not what everyone else is playing.
---
I hope this advice helps you some.
---
Lost half while being out numbered 2 to 1 and pull
---
I'm wanting to get back in to the game. I have a character worth around 2.7 billion isk and a clean slate - is there any way to get a crash course in the different aspects of the game to figure out what I might enjoy?
