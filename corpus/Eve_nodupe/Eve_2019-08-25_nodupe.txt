Ah that makes sense. TBH I tried to form the fleet around your timers so it would be easier for you guys. Most of us on the goon side really loved the fight and are looking for fights like this in the future.

Just a few things I have to say about EVE and ED:
---

---
EVE is a game that rewards the patient. If you cannot wait long enough or persist you will feel a bitter taste in your mouth but if you keep doing what you are doing you will be rewarded very well and you will feel like you actually acocmplished. Also you feel like you are actually having an impact on the game. It is a rich wide and deep ocean. Most of the fun wont be in runnig sites, doing mission but meeting new people, fighting them helping them etc.
---
ED is more solo oriented. It is quite a linear experience. A wide but a shallow puddle.
---
Props for having a backup FC and not whining about being headshot.
---
I miss the nana drake era.  2009/2010 around molden heath was awesome.  PODLA in bosena, I was still new so I had meta launchers trying to match their drakes. Learned tons from them in convos after.  Good times!
---
What did it say?
---
See step 4.

Chances of that happening are higher in a C6 than a C5 since rage rolling C6s are more rare.

having trouble finding a functional instant undock for my astrahus -rotated it and have no clue where the "axis" of it is, any tips?

Its a game. Gotta enjoy the good moments when you can.
---
Tough seeing people dodge and moonwalk out from  those pesky super drops you guys complain about isn’t it?
---
Literally just heard in my head 04 sp to the site
---
That is good advice.  I have been here 15 years,  i suck at pvp, but i have died so many times that it doens;t do much to me anymore when i die.  I get the rush that pvp brings but i just shrug off my deaths and try again.just lose a a lot and eventually you won;t care.
---
Lmao my ass off
---
Isn’t there also a career agent mission that literally tells you “go kill one of them, then get ready to die”? They make it pretty clear that you aren’t meant to live in one ship for the rest of your time in Eve.
---
T1 frigate PvP is no joke, friend. There's a lot more going on than there is in much of the larger-hull PvP, and a t1 hull with t2 and meta mods is 5-15m isk a pop.
---
To survive, Eve needs a citadel module that projects a 100k by 100k green grassy field in front, and an AOE shotgun module that does 10,000 kinetic DPS. I’d be happy.
---
Complain........What? My job is to simply highlight mediocre posts on r/eve and win support with my go to catchphrase “meh”
---
does it have multiplayer yet?
---
Oh hey fellow goonswarm federation member
---
I get better groupings with .22lr at 200 yards..
---
Have you tried the new player experience lately - it's truly awful lol
---
(1) It's not clear what you are doing. 
---
(2) There are 6 million windows open
---
(3) The default overview that new players start with is garbage
---
(4) Window transparency is still not fixed so new players on lower end machines can begin with windows looking like this: [https://i.redd.it/c9xdbizfsne21.png](https://i.redd.it/c9xdbizfsne21.png)
---
(5) There's no clear mechanism for guiding new players towards missions
---
(6) The new player missions themselves and other intro-level PVE content hasn't been updated in like 10 years
---
You used an expanded prove launcher. Try a regular one
---
Who cares? Just use corms and stay at 100km :)
---
Best ship ever
---
Nobody lost significant sp by forgetting to upgrade their clone, relative to a new player catching up. It was just enough to be irritating and discourage casual pvp without serving any useful purpose. Injectors were implemented to address the catching up problem, but not *because* of the removal of forgetful skill loss.
---
Any sp loss or ship lockouts sounds like the same thing. Particularly irritating and a drag on pvp without serving any particular purpose. Maybe make moving your medical clone more difficult if respawning into fights is really a problem.
---
Yes

FUCK

What kind of alliance are you in if you need to stop mining during a strat op?

I once cleared a site in nullsec and got 2000 firearms from it, they're contraband in highsec. But I'm not giving up on those, gotta defend against the 50 feral wormholers popping up in my system somehow.

It's really sad to see this type of question just gets trolled responses. I'm an active player and love this game for its longevity and sandbox environment. If you google best mmorpgs nearly every single list for the last 15+ years says Eve Online. Skill Injectors weren't meant for breaking the game. They allowed people to try and catch up to the salty bitter vets flying maxed out T3C's and Capitals. With 45 comments you'd think one of you would have a decent idea other than random shitposting. I honestly think we can collectively come up with ideas to bring the average player count back up to 60,000 active players. I know we all want that. We cant get that if all we do on here is shit on CCP. Where can I go to provide good feedback to CCP?  Finally some ideas... the super umbrella had to be stopped, the carbear nullsec super and carrier ratting had to stop. There is way to much ISK in the wallets. Capitals should be for Upwell structure defense not making 100mil ticks. CCP is actively testing and trying to make Eve capable of bigger lag/tidi free with Aether Wars demo's.  I really think what we all need is some reason to go to war. A reason to be on the edge of your seat fighting for your space. A reason to get out and risk your shit in PVE or PVP. We dont play this game for some quick win and on to the next game. We play this for the adrenaline of fights, the longevity and hard work to obtain the next biggest or better ship. Triglavians are cool and all but what has been done lately to bring us to war???
---
ill unedit dw
---
 Battle ships take more than a month
---
She would like elite dangerous perhaps
---
Fleet ads?
---
The problem is nobody uses the existing system because fleets usually need more planning and organization. So there are chat channels. Those work fine, CCP just needs to advertise them more. Like they said, they need to compromise on their no favouritism policy and hook new players up with the educational and NPSI groups.
---

---
Highsec is liberal cuckland.
---
Did the evil hedliner call you a stupid retard for not having the braincells to turn on your mwd and anchor?
---
dont try n fuck with my narrative bro
---
Your giving PVP a bad rap. Sure, solo PVP sucks, but flying with a fleet solves most of those issues, the real problem is making sure that new players get into fleet fights instead of trying solo
---
Most ppl won’t see it bc of their injectors
---
The features created a bigger sandbox. Resource wars, triglavians, trig invasions, incursions, abyssal deadspace, moon mining changes were to increase what you could do. We do need features. The question is... once we get rich and have the skills we've worked years for... now what do we do?
---
If you expect to cash out on the first site you are playing eve the wrong way. You need to keep doing it and the rewards will start coming in.
---
Wtf the fuck
---
We need bubbles and bombs in low sec. Next....

Maybe a saftey mechanism for individual modules that can be locked behind right click, rather than hiding modules behind a transparent drone window
---
Looks like you need to tighten your shot groups, mang.
---
x counters y which counter z which counters x
---
Even some differences in it's looks could help. More design than "spreadsheet." I've shown many people EVE over times and a lot of them just see all the buttons and things on screen and go "oh god that's so many things I wouldn't know where to start"
---
Make it look more scifi-y and less spooky, without sacrificing the usability. Easier said than done, I'm sure.
---
I mean, you can, it's just that everybody active is going to be busy fighting somewhere important so if you get jumped there's no backup.
---
You fit out a misslie battleship (Raven, RNI) with fill load of cruise launchers and trakcing computers with range scripts and mostly range rigs and range lows. You then create like 300-400km warpins and then you just cycle your launcher. The range is so far away that it doesn't agro the rats and they never shoot you. You use several ravens for this and you clear the sites in a very short time. Rinse and repeat. It is getting reworked so it is not a viable tactic anymore. 
---
Now the choice of ships will be RR nestors with some RR dominixes possibly leshaks. Many WH groups run C5s like this as well as some Daytrippers. Advantage of the Nestor is that it is 20.000.000 kg or so compared to 100.000.000kg for a standard battleship. So for each battleship mass you can get 5 nestors in the hole meaning that many more guys can go and farm the sites. Also they provide very good damage and remote rep per hull and mass out of all ships available.
---
That's a bit...suggestive.
---
TBH, it's a testament to the willpower of the CCP devs that the whole company hasn't pulled a Jonestown, with how absolutely terrible the most vocal parts of their community are.
---
There are some unrated complexes that also have an overseer which drops the OPE and deadspace modules.
---
Also there are unrated sites that have a 100% chance of haivng a commander ship.
---
Yeah but I was in my space and they invited me to fleet, I dont know how this happened?!
---
For all of five minutes, until the sheer weight of wasted potential hit her square in the face.
---
This. Catering to old players is like a older community catering to retirees. Sure, it's where the brunt of their money comes from, but those people won't be around forever and when they leave if you haven't been providing enough for the younger people...your community dies with them.
---
It's not that hard to make sure the new player experience isn't terrible while also making sure vets can do the same stuff they can do today. Put brand-new characters in a Tutorial system that can't be accessed by the normal stargate network until they're ready to leave, unless they want to skip it. Give them the help they need there to understand the game, then give them huge disclaimers that people will try to screw them.
---
Then stop screwing with the vets. Stop messing with the systems of the game just to see what happens because you think it's unfair to HS/LS/newbies. Stop ruining NS just because whiners on the internet think it's not hard enough.
---
Balance the game thoughtfully, don't just throw ideas at it and see who yells loudest.

the more you handhold them at the start the bigger the chance they d turn into the mouthbreathers that complain about ganking and  wardecks in hs and about cloaky camping when they re penned into null by these charities/slave enterprises that are nullsec noob corps.

That would also be a great way to do this. You could sell the items to a buyback and the buyback guy would mass ship them thing to or where ever the NPC market is.

In theory, yes, but I dont know how yet, been playing a few days only, and from what I've seen the system is still clunky.
---
&gt;Long training plans are for alts you don't use till their training is done or for **good little soldiers** who join one's **massive "newbie friendly" army**. it's not for new players who you want to nurture and help figure out their own play style.
---

---
Basically there is no best ship as such in Eve, each ship is a balance between speed/tank/damage/range.
---
So as in the game of rock/paper/scissor, each fit has its counter. You can kill a 200m ship with a 10M one if yours is a direct counter.
---
*Range control among ships of the same size :* 
---
\- pure brawlers have good dps but bad speed and range
---
\- Scram/kiters have a bit more of speed and range. The brawler is out-ranged and so dies.
---
\- Web/Kiters fight beyond the range of scrams but still within web range. The scram/kiters can't apply its weapon and so dies.
---
\- Kiters have poor dps but very long range and range control thanks to their speed.
---
\- Anti-Kiters are brawlers sacrificing tank and dps for speed. They catch kiters and murder them at brawling range.
---
\- Pure brawlers murder anti-kiters because they both fight at brawling range while the anti-kiter chose to sacrifice tank/dps for speed. Pure brawler wins.
---
*Among different classes of ships :*
---
\- A battleship has big guns but has poor speed and doesn't apply damage very well to small targets. So a frigate can get under its gun or kite it. But a frigate has poor dps compared to a battleship.
---
\- So bigger is not better since the bigger you become, the worse range control you have.
---
\- You can fit your battleship to apply better to small targets ( with webs and neutralisers, tracking modules) but then you will loose against another battleship fitted to hunt other battleship or cruisers.
---
Add in the mix all the existing types of E-War ( weapon disruption for instance) and you get an infinite array of moves and counter-moves.
---
Hope it helps !
---
i call it bitter vet syndrome.  
---
after a while of playing the game, you know better than the devs. And you forget to absorb the beuty of the game.
---
You have no idea what I do.  But I appreciate your nullbear point of view on what you assume I do.  Shouldn't you be off crying about cyno changes, or blackout, or something else interfering with your "ticks?"  
---
If you want to talk about easy mode, tell me who has intel networks, standing fleets, titans on every gate, and PANIC modes?  Because what I do, I do alone and I'm damn good at it.  You need a couple thousand neckbeard brothers to be moderately competant.  If I moved your F1 key, you'd be hopelessly lost.  Get fucked.
---
Not really those blue shoots are invite only 😉

As a Knowledge Management Consultant, the industry term being described (dictionary is carefully curated) by the OP is a **Taxonomy.** Taxonomies are very useful to organize vocabularies and are maintained in a hierarchal structure. This is a good contribution to Eve :)
---
I'm kind of doing the same right now, and in the next few days am hopefully going to take some steps that'll allow me to produce similar items freely. If you want to talk about it I'm happy to share in a pm.

I don't see the logic here

That's because it offers something different from WoW, while still being familiar.

Parasitic Legion.
---
By commodity I don't mean something you sell to NPC orders, but something like LP or sleeper salvage or trig loot.
---
My "dream" is "Alliance LP" that you use to buy items in a tier between Tech 2 and Navy balanced to be maybe 3-4 times the cost of tech 2 Items. So things like Alliance issue invulns that give 33-35% resists to fill in the gap between the current Tech 2 (30%) and Caldari Navy (37.5%).
---
where's the NSFW tag mothertrucker!?!
---
Having recently gone through the same process as you, I disagree with large chunks of what you have written. There are parts that I agree with strongly though.
---
Player Strength: You can click on the info of basically any pilot in the game and find out how old they are. This doesn't tell you how much time they've spent earning ISK and buying injectors, and it doesn't tell you if they're an alt, but it's a reasonable starting point. I don't want to get perfect information, how would we get fights?
---
Overview: The default overview is bollocks. However, I don't have an issue with the spreadsheet aspect of it, more that the content displayed is often nothing like you'd expect. The customization is cumbersome and some of the objects you want to show are labelled terribly. 
---
Finding People: In Hisec I get corp invites relentlessly. It sounds like you have spent more time in Lowsec than me, so that might be a thing. The Corp finder seems pretty decent. Was equally disappointed in the Fleet Finder as you were.
---
Life after Death: Strongly disagree on this one. The punishment for dying is (usually) very small in the game already. 
---
Safe Havens: Unless you're carrying a bajillion ISK in a freighter, Hisec is basically safe. If you're asking why you can't walk into someone else's territory without being shot, you might be missing the point. I only very recently started dipping my toes into Lowsec life and the anticipation has made it all the more exciting.
---
Aimlessness: This was the thing that attracted me to Eve and the thing that sets it aside from most other games for me. Although there's a couple of issues with the mechanics of the career paths tutorials (mostly because of the aforemetioned bollocks Overview), I thought they did a good job of showing me my options.
---
Gate Guns: Not specific to the guns, as others have answered the point well, but I have failed to accidentally aggress anything so far. I always get asked "Are you sure?" (usually when for some reason I have an acceleration gate locked) because I keep the safety green. If you're taking the safety off green, there should be an assumption that you're not scared to die and either have a knowledge of what is going to happen to you, or a willingness to find out the hard way.
---
This reply probably sounds more passive aggressive than it is meant to be. I more wanted to show that my NPE has been reasonably different from yours.
---
Wow.
---
It really isn't. 30 isn't small gang. At all.
---
I've found a lot of the content to be old, but not so much outdated.
---
I was using a different approach with drones. I have detailed it [out here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ces8dr/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_july_18/eu5nbdb/). I have played once with missiles but didn't think you can get to those range's
---
a/s/l and location
---
I was an absolute God at flying dropships and my corp loved me for it. Haven't felt that important since.
---
I told them, they laughed.  They said i should call you kiddie diddler instead of pedo, its more user friendly.
---
1 - e^(-0.75 * 0.01) = 0.007472  *[TC Heat/s]*  
---
H * e^(-0.63) = H * 0.5323 *[Mid Rack Cooling/s]*  
---
At 93% heat, you would have:  0.93 * 0.5323 = 0.49531 Cooling/s
---
It is more likely that the first cycle had cooling because it was not registered as heated yet because the 'end of cycle' didnt happen yet.
---
Thanks, I had a basic idea of some of those concepts but not this in-depth. Where do Drones fit in all this? Can't a big anti-battleship battleship just send drones when fighting frigates? What about stuff like Smartbombs?

I'm a new player (been playing about 3 weeks) but had been thinking about joining Eve for a long time - many years in fact. I liked the idea behind the game, the open-ended nature and, of course, the prospect of participating in the kinds of events that have made the game famous.  
---
Unfortunately, the new player experience has been the opposite of that for me - dull and opaque in a way that only a technocrat could love.  
---
What new players get in their first hours of gameplay is the opposite of epic and it's barely fun - most of my time was spent trying to understand the worst UI I've seen in any videogame. The fact that newbies need to spend significant time out-of-game doing web/youtube research on game mechanics than perhaps any other game I've played is just appalling game design...and I'm in my early 50's and have been playing games since the original Pong and the first MUDs.
---
The UI, the time-gated progression, a crappy tutorial (I've done the agency missions, they suck and teach you just enough to encourage stupid assumptions and mistakes) are major problems but even more than that, the game lacks a "hook" to draw new players in and get them emotionally invested in the game. 
---
So the problem with the new-player experience is two-fold:
---
*  It's a complex game where the developers have dropped the ball (whether by design or not) so hard that players have invested heavily in dedicated corps specifically designed to teach fundamental gameplay mechanics to new players. People always state the game is complex, but that's not the problem - the problem is the lack of opacity when it comes to game systems and mechanics. Obfuscated complexity makes the learning curve so much worse than it needs to be. So new players basically have to join one of these (inherently temporary) corps or else spend hours on wikis and tutorials just to learn basic game mechanics without continuously spawning free corvettes.
---
* The lack of any emotional "hook" at the beginning of the game doesn't create an incentive for players to invest the time and energy needed to learn and grind through opaque UI and systems. If there's nothing built-into the new player experience to get newbies excited about the game in the first couple of hours of play, then that is a pretty big design flaw IMO. 
---
The result is that the game requires a huge upfront investment before a new player even knows if the game is their cup of tea.  With so many other games to play, is it really any wonder why so few stick around?
---
I bought the cheap first 30 days of Omega, so I'm sticking it out for that long at least.  
---
And the sad thing is, I really thought this would be my kind of game (and maybe it is!).  I have time, I have money, I like complex "nerdy" games, yet I'm struggling to stay engaged.  It's ironic because the main reason I kept myself from trying Eve for all these years until now is that I feared getting addicted to the game.  Instead, I find myself wondering if I should bother to log in.
---
Wicked fun fight.  Was surprised they threw that many caracals at us.
---
Not once did I say I had good member retention.
---
I don’t care about how many people started giving you intel. You did absolutely nothing with it, and I’m certainly not going to lose sleep over it.  I absolutely don’t care tbh.
---
Also, how many people are in your shitty Corp of trash? How many months have you been at the same low garbage numbers as always?
---
See that’s the thing with you, this dark skies dipshit, and Alexander shirking or whatever.
---
You guys haven’t run a successful Corp of note.
---
I simply don’t care about your opinions at all.

Jonn I literally handed you the keys to a 250 man c5 Corp and you were such a weak leader you couldn’t hold it together and it instantly imploded. I knew it was going to happen, why do you think I gave the shares to iso?

---
How many of the choices available when skilling an Eve character are objectively wrong in every situation?
---
Accelerating new player training doesn't help, CCP talked about that in the dev blog when they announced the death of learning skills, which presented the same "choice" as the Magic 14.
---
Training the Magic 14 to 5 is the correct choice to make in every situation.  That does not represent a real choice and contributes nothing to complexity.  All they contribute is a time-tax on new players before we can start making actual choices about what we want to do in Eve, and removing them does absolutely nothing to hurt older players.  Better examples of what you claim the Magic 14 do are represented by skills like Fuel Conservation, Cloaking, and Weapon Upgrades, skills that are helpful in an overwhelming number of situations but not for literally every ship and every activity performed while undocked.
---
I honestly wouldn't be so sure about that. 
---
I googled and took a quick look at some random parts of it, and it just seemed like commonplace pornographic content here in Japan. People from other countries normally wouldn't even want to read the most fucked up stuff here, which is why it's not spreading in the first place.
---
(Source: I work with translation, and some of the stuff the company has been involved with has been 18+. We sometimes find the absolute weirdest shit while searching for potential clients or projects. Some of it just won't work outside of Japan on any level.)

if only CCP would release the source and let PC people do their thing, or just allow us to port it at all
---
Watching you orbit the griffin at 5000m with antimatter and missing most of your shots hurt my soul. When going for max dps on something, you should always use the keep at range command to avoid out tracking yourself.
---
You also need to work on your heat management, you burned out everything in that fight for no reason.
---
However, props for making videos and putting it out there, its' one of the best ways to learn and improve.
---
PC only allows up to 32 players. PS and xbone are capped at 8? I think. I'm a pcmaster race.
---
But I've been enjoying the game with my friends, but it's no Eve.
---
0300 formation at the company for weapons draw, but the armorer wont be in until 0730. Donuts at the dfac today.
---
Orbiting at 1,500 with MWD on in a rail Brutix missing literally every shot. Top quality nullsec piloting.
---
If it's worth anything, GoTG had also been consolidating in Deklein which has been throwing off money making while that's been happening.
---
&gt; How many of the choices available when skilling an Eve character are objectively wrong in every situation?
---
Valid question, lets take them section by section from the EVE Uni Wiki:
---
CPU Management (1x, 30k ISK)
---
    5% bonus to ship CPU output per skill level. Starting Skill Level: IV - Alpha Clone Limit: V 
---
You're only getting 5% from finishing this skill, not really that important
---
Power Grid Management (1x, 30k ISK)
---
    5% bonus to ship power grid output per skill level. Starting Skill Level: IV - Alpha Clone Limit: V 
---
See above.
---
Capacitor Management (3x, 200k ISK)
---
    5% bonus to capacitor capacity per skill level. Starting Skill Level: III - Alpha Clone Limit: IV 
---
This is an important skill, you learn as you go that you need this skill higher, its basic functions and need to train help you understand the mechanics of your capacitor as you train it (unless you have a wooden brain)
---
 Capacitor Systems Operation (1x, 60k ISK)
---
    5% reduction in capacitor recharge time per skill level. Starting Skill Level: III - Alpha Clone Limit: III 
---
Again, another learning point for new players to help them understand how their capacitor works.  Not training it for some races (minnie) is viable, its a skill you can wait on, or not.
---
 Mechanics (1x, 30k ISK)
---
    5% bonus to structure hit points per skill level. Starting Skill Level: II or III, depending on race - Alpha Clone Limit: V 
---
This skill outright doesn't matter, you CAN skip it if you're not a Gallent pilot with almost zero noticeable difference in your game play.  I hate that this skill is even in the list of "magic 14"
---
 Hull Upgrades (2x, 85k ISK)
---
    5% bonus to armor hit points per skill level. Starting Skill Level: II or III, depending on race - Alpha Clone Limit: V 
---
Again, this is another squeezer, you're milking your amarr/galent set ups for every last ounce once you've maxed this.  Not having it trained is NOT a detriment to new players, and I'd even say its for more advanced players that have a better understanding of fitting and are trying squeeze every last percent out.  As in a learning moment.
---
Shield Management (3x, 170k ISK)
---
    5% bonus to shield capacity per skill level. Starting Skill Level: I or II, depending on race - Alpha Clone Limit: IV 
---
 Shield Operation (1x, 55k ISK)
---
    5% reduction in shield recharge time per skill level. Starting Skill Level: I or II, depending on race - Alpha Clone Limit: IV 
---
These are the armor equal from above.  Amarr pilots neither need nor deserve either of these, while shield based pilots that train these get a boost, one they had to learn they needed.  Again, these are "magic 14" skills that probably shouldn't be counted since they add quantifiable advantages in expressed in both in game performance and an understanding of the needs of the ships you're flying.
---
 Navigation (1x, 30k ISK)
---
    5% bonus to sub-warp ship velocity per skill level. Starting Skill Level: III - Alpha Clone Limit: V 
---
You think *this* skill should be eliminated?  Amarr and Caldari pilots can literally not care about this skill so its not a mandatory train, when you start to want to go faster, you start looking for ways to do that, this skill crops up.
---
Warp Drive Operation (1x, 45k ISK)
---
    Each skill level reduces the capacitor need of initiating warp by 10%. Starting Skill Level: I - Alpha Clone Limit: III 
---
This skill has huge implications if not trained and it adds suspense to things like chases for people that don't have it trained all the way.  Like this is an important thing where you're like 'man i can't make full warps whats going on' and then you figure it out.
---
**NOW** there are TWO skills which are redundant, Evasive Maneuvering and Spaceship Command.  Theres no learning component here, and most people literally wont notice the increase even after its fully trained because it came in those incremental increases.  It is definitely important because its integral in how long it takes you to get into warp but literally nobody thinks about that when training it, its an actual gate to get to somewhere else.
---
CCP don't know what they are talking about, shocker.
---
username checks out, reee you seeeded my c5 wow wtf hk i'm mad at u
---
There's literally no benefit in circumcision. There's little to no harm in it either though.
---
&gt; In your opinion is the experience difficult in itself or is this the lack of information which is hurting?
---
Speaking for myself, *presentation* of information is what hurts me.  
---
The tutorial tells me a lot of useful things, and outside of that, other players will fill me in (this community is really helpful), however, there's a vast difference in difficulty and complexity between the tutorial and being loosed into eve itself that you just sort of skip across.  That pacing could use some work.  It felt like I was set loose in a canoe in the middle of the ocean.  
---
When someone would shoot at me, it felt like I was getting tossed in a storm, and I had no idea what was going on.  All I had was a screeching noise, a little flashy thing on my overview and in space, and little numbers rolling overhead.  
---
Rather than little text boxes flashing red, can I get some other information?  Rather than an enigmatic set of overview settings, can I get something pre-setup that will help me in my career of choice?  Rather than memorizing the different looks of railguns and blasters, can something just tell me what an enemy is using?
---
Then the incursions stuff don't give me an idea of how difficult they are.  Like, are these events something I should even try to do?  Are they way out of my league (I just assume they are without older players' help).  Sleepers are a thing hanging out near a wormhole, but can I do anything to them in my little frigate?  I dunno.  There is no game-assisted presentation of that information.  (I will say that little things to explore like this are amazing.  I love these little things to investigate; it makes the universe feel more alive.)
---
There's just *so much* info in eve both in its overall depth and what happens play-by-play in a fight that I'm overwhelmed.  I need help to understand wtf I'm looking at/doing.  The sad thing is, while trying to juggle so many things in so many windows, I actually lose sight of the game itself because of the occlusion on the screen.  So not only am I scrambling to deal with all these things, I can't enjoy the aesthetics either.  I believe better presentation would help with this (because hey, even if I can't survive, at least there's a pretty pew pew show I can watch as I get blown up).
---
And I'll add the weird glitchy stuff with the current presentation of information that actually gets me killed.  I recall trying my hand at a combat site in high sec somewhere and a ship warped in right as I was trying to lock an enemy.  Because the new ship pushed all my content in the overview down, I ended up clicking something owned by a player and shooting it.  CONCORD came in and killed me.  Because of the UI.  The UI!  Maybe I'm locking things the wrong way, but I don't know the right way, and this is frustrating!

MTUs do give you suspect status fool. Pilots can freely engage as soon as any of us start shooting your shitty MTU. Are you that blind that you don't understand that's half the reason we do it?

Some people actually try and fight to save their helpless MTU. Some actually have more than 2 brain cells to rub together and realise they can just scoop their MTU and sit there staring at me without any danger whatsoever. 
---
There's no such thing as an honest pilot or honest living in Eve. It's a sandbox filled with immortal demi-gods and ships are just ammo.
---
Correction: CCP is covering for riding the rorq and skill injector changes for years and now having to find a solution to a problem they created, then ignored.
---
lol fuckin r swarm.
---
&gt; CCP CEO Hilmar has shown us a stunning lack of insight into how probably  the most iconic and awe-inspiring part of EVE Online actually works and  actually wants to get rid of it. It is insulting to the intelligence of  the EVE Online community. 
---
Just putting it out there, but I unsubbed because of capital and super capital proliferation. I've only just come back because of Blackout. 
---
I joined in 2011 at Incarna. Titans were rare as shit. A single titan itself was awe-inspiring. There was reverence in seeing a couple of supers in a staging POS.
---
Today, titans are *commonplace*. There is nothing special about them any more. 
---
The stunning lack of insight isn't with Hilmar and Burger. It's with you. 
---
Also, format the post better. Use headings. Put in a table of contents that describes what you're going to talk about ahead of time. It was just one long stream of consciousness. Even your TLDR is too big. For every seven words you wrote, you have one in your TLDR.
---
Lol trust nothing redline says.
---
Force, as in Force Multiplier you nancy.
---
It was actually cool talking to Dust players in local
---
Carriers without cynos, are literally just anti-carriers at that point haha.  Which is ironic, since there won't be any carriers, and you won't hot drop them anymore.
---
Nah some of them want to know why im being so nice to you.
---
I'm here from the future! A large chunk of rorq miners have switched, yes.
---
Cause they're awful lol.
---
yea, but you're a pedo so none of them care what you think
---
Honestly there is no reason to think it is more one than the other. Given what they do, I'd hardly regard them as a force multiplier. They aren't used enough to suggest people regard them as such.
---
It's either that or people complaining about development taking actual time.
---
Indeed a battleship can recall its heavy drones and launch a set of light drones. But then its dps drops.
---
A battleship doesn't launch more drones, there is an hard limit of five regardless of the ship. A battleship has a bigger bandwidth allowing bigger drones, that's their strength.
---
So if battleship fields five warriors II because its Berserker can't track, it's no better than a T1 Tristan with its own five warriors II.
---
The aim of a battleship is to have maximum damage but without application this damage is useless. That's why in arty fleets, newbros can fly with target painting frigates. Because the big guns need this buff to their tracking.
---
Smart-bombs indeed don't care about the size of your victim ( unlike bombs). But then it means that you sacrifice your high slots, powergrid and a bit of CPU that you could use otherwise.
---
drifters actually have a face. this dude dont
---
what.
---
Im not and they should? Congratz on them being dumb?
---
Mine the ochre, don't want to? Kill yourself
---
&gt;	it ain’t much, but it’s honest work
---
been annoyed by this for YEARS, its been there since day one of the new and improved™ skill window
---
Thanks!
---
What have you ever done that they should care what you think? 
---
Also yea, you are.  The lady doth protest too much, methinks
---
&gt;CCP CEO Hilmar has shown us a stunning lack of insight into how probably the most iconic and awe-inspiring part of EVE Online actually works and actually wants to get rid of it. It is insulting to the intelligence of the EVE Online community.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;While Hilmar likes to shift away any blame to his developers, he is still the guiding force behind the development of EVE Online and players should ask, if he doesn't understand what is involved behind a player owning and playing with a Titan, what other portions of this game is he trying to influence where he genuinely has no idea what he's talking about?  
---
&gt;Finally, if you look at the trends shown in the charts from Google Trends and EVE-Offline's Player Activity, what exactly does CCP have in mind that will meaningfully inject life into EVE Online? This is especially true if they plan on steering away from large-scale fights. While there is a general dislike of the Tidi lag-fests that are large-scale fights, at the same time, if CCP doesn't have them to stir up public interest in this game, then what do they hope to replace that with? The last meaningful jump for in activity due to CCP's direct actions was when they made the game free-to-play with Alpha accounts.  
---
&gt;Because late-summer is cyclically a weak time period, it is still too early to realize the determine the potential long-term impact of the most recent changes to nullsec's local chat. In addition, many of EVE's developers have also been out enjoying vacations. The CSM has also just started getting thing started. Either way, there is still hope, but I believe CCP needs to do a better job listening to the veteran playerbase to develop meaningful changes that might help encourage the return of previous players, bring in new players, and drive meaningful content that will encourage large player organizations to create as much chaos and destruction as possible.
---
Been playing everyday for the past ten years. Please tell me how I have no insight.
---
It's Reddit, I'll consider better formatting next time - maybe. You seem to have read most of the summary just fine.
---
&gt; taking actual time.
---
look, even valve would have out the door quicker, developing takes time yes, but the guy has a massive budget and 0 managing skills, making it the least efficient dev cycle since... Duke forever
---
It comes down to one alliance that basically succeeded too well. The vast majority of the game cannot afford to lose Titans or Supers or even Carriers.
---
Let's be honest here, even on PC it wouldn't be that great and standout of a game, which got released in an already oversaturated shootermarket.
---
On the other hand, NS peeps tend to have little knowledge on WH mechanics, which can cause issues...
---
They are frequently used hubs for frigate fleets
---
Well...Hilmar especially. 
---
I just noticed the thread from a few days ago that basically elaborates everyone's thoughts on this whole discussion that Hilmar had at that event.
---
The event itself seems to have gotten kinda awkward with the whole steam room - Hilmar naked thing.
---
While maybe well-intentioned, the Fanfest at Home thing is just kinda lame for a company that's been doing the large event in Iceland and Vegas for years ... now this?
---
I love everything Signal Cartel. Id join instantly if I wasn't such a piece of shit. And the no pvp bit... But keep exploring and making cool stuff!
---
yeah... the problem is I dont care what they or you think...
---
&gt; Also yea, you are.  The lady doth protest too much, methinks   
---
&gt;So you're describing yourself now?
---
Just wish they actually looked at balancing conflict drivers and the rate of isk pouring into then game instead of gimmicky game changes.
---
I understand it probably took a long time to write this much, but we already had the discussion telling you guys to adapt or die. Go see any of those posts
---
&gt; I ended up clicking something owned by a player and shooting it.  CONCORD came in and killed me.
---
I made this comment in my other reply, but I suspect your safety is not set to green! It is very hard to accidentally shoot something you shouldn't when that setting is used.
---
There are a few ships that can kite Warriors, but they tend to require Snake Pods.
---
This is what you get when you have an afk CEO, pissing away piles of money on failed project after failed project, suddenly given financial incentive to make something work that he doesn't understand yet has the power to change/destroy. My only hope is that he fucks off after October or PA fires his ass when someone in Korea realizes how monumentally he's fucking up Eve Online and causing players to flee.
---
Speak nit the name if that travesty
---
Just need some clever fuckers to do a eve/star citizen/freespace hybrid and we are gucci
---
Thanks for just verifying that there is a cost. 0.5% of say, 70bil is 350mil. Not much to someone like me, but still... just not without cost.
---
Thanks. Yeah, saw that after the fact. :shrugs: 
---
The adapt or die mantra is basically just the normal SOP for this game, so nothing new there.
---
You can't evict anyone from the drifter holes.
---
No bud, im talking to you, the kiddie diddler.
---
Also you're the one that thinks strangers should be nice to you and or care what you think, but suddenly you dont care what other people think.
---
Seems like besides being a pedophile you're also a hypocrite
---
Was more a reference to Star Citizen. A game of that scope being in development for 8 years or more is completely normal (mind you: We have known about it since the early concept phase, before they even had a company). Yet people are up in arms over it, acting like such a long development time is somehow unnormal, solely because all they know of are projects which only get announced after they've already been in development for years or are even reusing assets from previous entries of the franchise.
---
one does normal cap/subcap pvp, the other does industry/dread/fax
---
i have two unsubbed, one does a super another does a titan. need to buy a new titan.
---
Indeed! The month is not yet over but there has been a drop in Excavator Mining Drone kills compared to the first month of blackout. My opinion of the matter is that this is good. There is now a risk vs reward associated with Mining Drone choice.

Yes and no. I don't disagree that Goons/The Imperium have basically the defacto superpower, but there are definitely other groups, such as Test, Fraternity, PHorde, and even NC/PL still, who definitely have the firepower to match. 
---
I was streaming NC/PL/PHorde moving their super and capital fleet out of Tribute recently and have the video to support that they definitely could have done some serious damage to the Goons if they weren't already interested in consolidating into Kalevala and Malpais. 
---
The growth of the large Chinese alliances is even more substantial for the long-term though. The speed that they have developed their supercapital fleets has been substantial and Fraternity has the help of experienced supercapital FC's and pilots from PL helping to develop the remainder of their pilots.
---
Month is not yet over and  Excavator kills are past 1100. Seems people think that Excavators are worth the risk.

It's amazing how wel l you can describe yourself.

clearly you didn't get killed enough by PL/NCdot tracking titans like I did during incarna and later as a new guy.

yes

In my humble opinion, Titans shall receive a buff in future patches.
---
A good deed good increases Karma.
---
You just lined up the "im rubber you're glue" response?
---
I was there when ASCN and BOB went at it and Cyvok lost his Titan... After that it was slow down hill for bob.
---
Agreed. I guess the question is to which drivers they can use? Resource shakeup? I'd like to see them look into using AI to help stir up PVE to make it more dynamic. I'm afraid that, in order to see meaningful long-term growth in the playerbase, they might need to look into doing something on the same level of significance to the alpha clones. ... Seasons like Diablo? Maybe make the game entirely free-to-play and make money off of items like Warframe? 
---
There are options, just have to remember who CCP is competing against and realize that they might need to consider other options for the space MMO community.
---
To do an in system transfer you need another keepstar as well.
---
Titans in 2011 were also rarely used because they were so vulnerable. it was ballsy for PL to smartbomb with a Titan in lowsec and even that died to a dread bomb. Now you have haw guns and bosons and tethering.
---
For the most part, Gallente make the best drone boats.
---
- Tristan / Ishkur Frigates
---
- Algos / Magus Destroyer
---
- Vexor / Ishtar Cruisers
---
- Myrmidon / Eos Battlecruiser
---
- Dominix / Sin Battleship
---
If you have the money to throw around, you can sprinkle Worm / Gila / Rattlesnake in there. But those are more expensive Pirate Faction ships, and require just as much Caldari skill as Gallente.
---
If it fits the situation...which it does...congratz....you're still retarded?
---
Shooting that with a Ruger 10/22?
---
Honestly, you're right.  Hilmar has never played this game or grinded to get his own titan, he just sees a screenshot like that and gets edgy and mad because, well, it's what he wants to do.
---
Grind yourself a titan.  See the "ease" it takes to get hundreds, if not thousands of them. 
---
The issue isnt the amount or the design of titans, the issue is people dont lose them.  Maybe the issue is being able to asset safety them, who knows, but until you grind it out yourself you have no right to bitch because others have.
---
That's when you fire up kerbal space program and make a Hecate SSTO.
---
Can you link it?  People on mobile phones can't just copy and paste.
---
Get rid of Hilmar.

What are you currently doing? Perhaps some advice from others on how to improve your experience might be forthcoming if you say what you’ve tried and didn’t like.

---
The item names have been considerably simplified compared to what they used to be. The majority of items follow common naming themes:
---
-	“Compact”: fitting costs are reduced compared to other versions
---
-	“Enduring”: Capacitor cost is reduced compared to other versions
---
-	“Scoped”: Range is increased compared to other versions 
---
And so on.
---
&gt;The problem isnt rorquals and making big toys, large mining fleets did this for years.  
---
&gt;The problem is that eve is BUILT around avoiding unwinnable fights. the "smartest" pvpers and fcs "avoid" fights because there is almost no cost to just throwing away whatever will be lost by attackers and replacing compared to defending.  
---
&gt;This is true for roaming gangs, for defense, for anything.  If it's not a guaranteed kill, run.  Cloak. Hide.  Be "smart".    
---
&gt;And that culture has destroyed eve's economy to allow the smart to invest tons of time in effort into being invincible wealth wise because people like olmecca, hilmar, and (i love you man but its true) falcon who think "bringing risk" to pve will somehow change the fact that PVPERS DO NOT FIGHT unless forced.  Literally forced, or bored.  That will never fix the issue, and they'll learn this or keep making god awful changes until the game dies.  
---
&gt;That's just where it all is

If cloaks werent so insanely strong in this meta you'd have a point

Agreed. PA might come in and fuck up the game, but I'll take my chances. I'd rather they step in and take over managing development rather than allow this idiot to stay in charge of something he fundamentally doesn't understand.

---
So you're saying you're not constantly using arguments found on playgrounds because you got a thing for fucking little boys, but because of me?
---
The thing that really killed me is when he flat out admitted on his own twitter account that the success CCP has had so far with Eve was completely by chance and they have no idea how to replicate it. Suddenly 10 years of him flushing money down the shitter on one failed project after another that died either to mismanagement or simply not properly understanding the market they were trying to enter makes so much more sense.

We know how this plays out. It boils down to veteran players wanting to overwhelmingly be the top dogs where no one can challenge them and they can stomp anyone they want.
---
This is painfully obvious from your spiel here about not wanting titans nerfed/removed/just plain changed. You lament hard that something that disrupts the balance of the rest of the game is being looked at. You plead and beg for them to look somewhere else for changes. Titans are a problem, and you are part of that problem by wanting them to not change anything.
---
We don't have 40 Titans sitting on keepstar in the Kelvala Expanse. Stop attributing this problem to us.
---
There should absolutely be upkeep cost of Titan.
---
Give strategic assistance at the same time and ride free.
---
Go ahead?  You're wrong.  Great Talk
---
You're sentence literally made no sense.  Congratz on still being retarded.
---
In my humble opinion, you should never post here again
---
Don't blindly upvote it could be like a sneaky EULA trying to get people to agree to some obscure shit burried in their rant.
---
True, the above video applies to anyone who has a passing knowledge of something and thinks that's expertise.
---
Do share your numbers, we'd like to see how 20% of null matches 80% in Titan numbers.
---
They are not seeded. You have to build them.
---
CCP Hilmar represents so many examples of CCP’s errors.
---
Buy them for injectors on contracts, build them, or have them when the game mirrors
---
Doesn’t it take 6 months to build them?
---
Go to M-0 using the /moveme command in any chat, then either check contracts there or build there.
---
Contracts will be for ISK but a trade for Skill Injectors, don't know how many last time i checked it was around 40-50.
---
Bow chika wow wow.
---
No Man Sky is perfect for planetary sights!
---
Blue donut
---
There’s one for 80 billion in m-0. Ark insurance fraud time
---
I dont remember the build time but its quite a bit shorter than 6 months
---
VR too, and mods work in VR... with a mod!!
---
TLDR was too long, can someone please summarize?
---
About a month or so
---
Yeah, I’ve got this AB Heron fit that I’ve been wanting to try out... T1 stuff is some of the best fun to be had
---
&gt; Are you that blind that you don't understand that's half the reason we do it?
---
I was off-grid by the time he fired, dipshit. Or have you forgotten to read as a result of joining the no-stones brigade? You self-righteous pricks act like the reaction you expect is the logical one, despite the fact that
---
&gt; Some actually have more than 2 brain cells to rub together
---
and prioritize their ship over the MTU when unknown combatants drop in to lick their cockpit windows.
---
Wrong about what? That your response was the weakest? It actually was. Scroll up and see what you wrote lmao. That's your LIFE. ARE you YOU dude?!?1
---
I’m not surprised at how many titans or supers there are. Look at how old the damn game is. I’m not fully against skill injectors but then you can buy skill points and inject up to a titan if you really wanted CCP can’t really bitch that it’s a problem. They did it to the game. Not us.  If you want a titan or super and have the means to acquire one what’s stopping you?
---
You can't understand that sentence?
---
ED is garbage for going down to a planet. NMS would be a better bet. And Star Citizen for just going to look at a planet is probably the winner since that's one of the few things you \*can\* do right now in there.
---
You're still comparing the long game to the short game.
---
There is no need to commit to the long game before you're having fun.
---
You don't need to rush to t2 modules and the magic 14. You can just train the basics in the things you want to try, which DO NOT take months of training.
---
Same, the whole capital proliferation and devaluation is sad and one of the reasons I quit as well.
---
Thermonuclear take: Capitals aren't fun and I wish they weren't in the game. That is all.
---
Which aspects of each?
---
&gt; Wrong about what? That your response was the weakest? 
---
Literally wrong about that yeah, great talk.
---
&gt; There is no amount of skill or attention that will keep the krab from dying.
---
Maybe as an individual.
---
But we're talking about an organized group of players. They can have scouts on some gates, and call out combat probes, etc.
---
&gt;  Even aligned a mining barge takes a day and a half to get into warp and if you're mining really close to a gate you may not have enough time. It was a cat and mouse game.
---
No, that's not cat and mouse.
---
It was literally just hunter jumps in, has 3 seconds to pick something random to warp to. If they pick wrong, then there is nothing in this system to kill, unless the "mouse" chose not to do the only reasonable thing.
---
It didnt make any sense, have you realized you're retarded yet?
---
I just mean all of them.
---
like engineering complexes are like not even 1b.
---
There’s also the SOE Hulls and some Amarr Hulls that get fantastic drones, plus the SoCT hulls.
---
Hey man
---
I'm sorry first off. I read your reddit history and scrolled and scrolled. You have ONE YEAR of crying about video games! HAHAHAHA
---
But the best was

when you

---
Welp i can’t actually fly an ark, does anyone know the easiest way to get 80 billion isk in sissi
---
&gt; free two minutes
---
only 1 minute.
---
&gt; But I also know I could do everything right (in fleet, good tank, aligned, alert, drones out and ready) and still die every day to hunters.
---
This is only because of provi. This wouldn't happen if you were anywhere else.
---
It makes perfect sense, im asking you to clarify if you're blaming your use of school yard level arguments like "im rubber and you're glue" because of me, or because of your rampant desire to fuck little boys, which exposes you to them on a regular basis as you abduct and rape them.
---
You probably got one in your closet taped up right now
---
Shut the fuck up Braves a joke ... I should have just stayed in tnt
---
Main: Subcaps, Caps, basically anything
---
1st alt: Sabres, Bifrosts (Links or Booshes), Cloaky eyes/seed, DSTs, Covops Cynos
---
2nd Alt: Ceptors, Keres/Hyena, Bombers, Cloaky Eyes/Seed.
---
Can I have a copy of this.
---
Insurance on any capitals I think
---
Pretty sure arks don't have higher insurance payouts than providences anyway.
---
Ya I went on to abyssals and made a bil in a night. Almost lost it all in a t5 with 12 seconds left. Wewlad.
---
Looks like airsoft BBs.
---
Tjat may be, but eve is not a game of instant gratification
---
Yeah, it's like the opposite of EVE.
---
It has great moment to moment gameplay, but has not much decent systems for that gameplay to work within, so it gets kind of boring.
---
EVE has pretty awful moment to moment gameplay, but the systems in place to frame that gameplay are very interesting.
---
lol that was a good one, thanks for remind me.  Definitely deserved more credit, thanks for recognizing that.
---
&gt; I'm sorry first off. I read your reddit history and scrolled and  scrolled. You have ONE YEAR of crying about video games! HAHAHAHA
---
So what you're saying is you're retarded as well..got it.
---
Sure, but the Amarr drone boats aren't quite as powerful as the Gallente drone boats.
---
And the SOE are kinda in the same lane as the Guristas. You need both Amarr and Gallente skills to fly them.
---
A titan is meant to be an alliance asset, at most a corp asset. The second titans become things that a single player would obtain all alone the concept broke and the mistake was made. You're just too new to remember the days of when titans were distributed at a health level with a couple per alliance and each of them being a major strategic asset.
---
&gt; It makes perfect sense, im asking you to clarify if you're blaming your  use of school yard level arguments like "im rubber and you're glue" on  me, or because of your rampant desire to fuck little boys, which exposes  you to them on a regular basis as you abduct and rape them. 
---
Yeah, no, you seem to be having a breakdown, are you okay?
---
If You are brand new and trying to fly one then it’s been nice knowing you before you became noob capital pilot o7 I’ll remember these days with fondness

You know millenials are doomed when they start counting age in yeets.

What about anything there suggests a break down? Is English not your native language? I'm suggesting you either have or have recently had a minor held captive for sexual purposes.
---
Why are you confused?
---
I'm starting to doubt your innocence if we're honest.
---
If they could make Eve more like Star Citizen where I could pay them hundreds of dollars but the game never actually releases I could get years of my life back.
---
Yeah, I tried flying to planets. Got excited about DUST and the Orbital Bombardment stuff way back when... all of it was just so disappointing in the end.
---
I did fly to a planet and zoom in on it. "Its just a rock..." SO I found another one that was temperate "it kinda looks like Earth, are their animals there?" I'm sure there are, but we just can't see them... "oh..." :: runs off to play something else ::
---
I'd appreciate you not openly showing how disgusting you are as a human with your insults
---
&gt;I'd appreciate you not openly showing how disgusting you are as a human with your insults  
---
&gt;Thanks!
---
 
---
Right back at ya man lol
---
Conveniently ignoring that I just explained shooting an MTU does get you a suspect timer. You could have warped back and engaged. Did you? Well who's the one with no stones if you didn't? 
---
Concord will fuck you if you engage a ship first you twat. That's the whole reason for shooting the MTU first. To get suspect so people like yourself have a valid reason to shoot back. Then you get blown up.
---
You are very disconnected from reality clearly.
---
I'm just a casual member but I'm sorry you feel that way.
---
I had a few encounters with PL myself during that time period:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/21859910/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/21859910/) for example. IRC was an average-sized alliance at that time with  3,100 members at that time and E-BYOS was the main home/staging system ([http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Intrepid\_Crossing/stats/2013-03-23:2014-08-25](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Intrepid_Crossing/stats/2013-03-23:2014-08-25))
---
Other than PL, I remember only a few other groups, like Solar and Raiden, who also had relatively large numbers of Titans, for that time period. Don't forget that CCP had nerfed Titans and then reintroduced tracking Titans with HAW's. 
---
On the same note, Titans on their own were vulnerable to be killed then, just as they are now. Of course, you didn't have the same level of organization and numbers of players concentrated in certain areas like you do now.
---
While I don't dispute that there are significantly more Titans today, it's still hard to argue that Titans are disposable for most alliances.
---
What on earth makes you say something like that?
---
This post and the one above it go interestingly.
---
Everything you post lol.
---
You can online/offline modules in space. You just have to have &gt;95% capacitor to online modules.
---
I haven't posted anything that would suggest an altered mental state, I've posted lots though suggesting you finger fuck 7 year olds.
---
Battlefield x EVE was a great idea, and it would've been amazing if fully implemented. Killed before it could fully live, unfortunately.
---
It is silly to pretend our actions in space have zero ramifications on planets and we just exist in stations. Even if DUST were just Station warfare in a COD style instead of BF style... it would be interesting and lead to a greater feeling of universal connection.
---
That's part of the problem and also yes you have posted alot describing an altered mental state.  You should seek help.
---
The main problem with PC DUST 514 is multi-boxing players trying to do both EVE and DUST at the same time for profit/gain. Just throw Valkyrie in there and you'd have some poor (rich?) fool out there wearing a VR headset over one eye while playing DUST on 3 screens and EVE on another 3 screens.
---
I totally agree
---
[titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V2sBURgUBI)
---
I dont think i trust your mental evaluation.  For one thing you're obviously upset that I've outed you, thats bias.
---
For another you're a pilot, of both choppers and planes, a CEO that runs a company valued over 300 million, AND a game developer.  I have serious doubts to how much attention you actually paid during your psych classes.
---
We're gonna need a second opinion.
---
HAHAHA
---
Add this to your resume of weak shit
---
&gt;   For one thing you're obviously upset that I've outed you, thats bias. 
---
Lol thats a misconception.
---
&gt; We're gonna need a second opinion. 
---
Yeah...go to a psychiatrist lol.
---
You did not pick a bad time to start playing. In fact, it's probably one of the best times to start playing. People are whining, because they've optimized their isk factories to perfection and don't like it when CCP throws some unexpected wrenches at them.
---
&gt;HAHAHA  
---
&gt;Add this to your resume of weak shit
---
Again right back at ya.  This explains why your show is shit.
---
&gt; Yeah...go to a psychiatrist lol.
---
How do you know I'm not one?  Isn't it possible thats how i was able to spot your fetish from a distance?

So what you just said there was that I was right...got it thanks. :P

Holy shit hm u make a month off the SP farm?

How do you know my show is shit?

Unfortunately, Twitch video of the the 48+hour stream of SH1- when they were moving is no longer available.

ZKillboard is one method for approximating the numbers; however, bear in mind that it's reliant on titan/super characters getting on kills within 3 months to show up on.
---
He is literally doing anything he can, including potentially salting the earth, so he can make his bonus, and walk. I hope someone at PA will recognize this and stop him before October, because it may be far too late by then. Himlar doesn't give one fuck about the game or community. Himlar only cares about himlar.
---
I have 4 accounts
---
Main: Just my main character, lots of subcap skills, all 4 strategic cruisers, pirate, low sec, Currently sitting in an Ishtar in Lowsec

2nd: 1 Black ops, carrier, jump freighter pilot sitting in a Panther, 1 cloaky hauler pilot in a Crane
---
3rd: Black Ops, Dread, Tengu pilot. Sitting in a Stratios Right now.
---
4th: 1 Manufacturing Pilot that used to be a perfect boosting legion (so now she has like a million SP from that unused). 1 Dedicated Tengu pilot
---
In a proper day of playing EVE, I'd log in to each of the accounts and use them. So I don't really have any totally sitting accounts.
---
I’m more interested in doomsdaying concord
---
The best thing is i KNOW you listened to many of my podcasts
---
Guess how many podcasts of yours anyone in the world will ever listen to?
---
:)
---
This is your peak. You've hit the peak of you, just talking to me. 
---
Congrats man1
---
And yet, it literally doesnt matter lol
---
I can understand that
---
Wait, you read that i might be a psychiatrist and thought that somehow validates your pedophile shit?
---
Thats absolutely not what happened you shouldn't hurt children bud.
---
Looks kinda like that ship movement for that new fleshlight ad.
---
Praxis (lol) insure for more than freighters, for some reason
---
By chance!?!? The fuck it was. I have played since '07, and every fucking time that CCP did something right, it was because they listened to nullsec, and sometimes lowsec. I say this having been an only highsec player until November of 2016. Fuck Himlar. He's a narcissistic POS, and needs to be removed fully from the game, just like every other POS, especially the ones I sunk 7 billion isk into.
---
I’ve seen a super (Nyx) in rens in sisi so ik moveme works on them
---
So you're still delusional. hows that going for ya?
---
How do you know I'm delusional?
---
im gonna go with easily
---
Yeet
---
"it comes down to one group playing the meta too well"
---
Ok, Himlar. Get Gud
---
It also has what I call "No Man's Sky Syndrome", or what happens when your game has the breadth of an ocean and the depth of a puddle.          
---
The whole milky way, billions of star systems, and fuck all to do in each. Say what you will about EVE's paltry ~10k or so, there's actually shit to do in them.
---
&gt;Maybe make the game entirely free-to-play and make money off of items like Warframe?
---
this is how you get ore to be crapped out at rates that puts the first iteration of the excav rorqual to shame, every random with a half decent rig could run ungodly large barge fleets as they are stupid easy to skill into
---
there's always that one nerd who codes free stuff love it
---
Did you shoot this with your eyes closed?
---
is that the title of your show lmao
---
(sorry i know i'm punching down)
---
it's 3 weeks to make one with a 0-0 blueprint 
---
and as everything is seeded (aside from AT, supers, and officer) you can just buy a bunch of parts and a bunch of titan BPOs if you want a bunch to play with
---
Lol go try elite dangerous then come see how great the new player exp is in eve
---
More like the one yours should use.  Im sorry you think your punching down lmao.
---
oof
---
that's what being you comes up with eh?
---
tough to see
---
2 accounts. First is abyss runner and second is for everything else :D
---
Just go get a ton (and I mean a ton) tech 1 frig and start to fw plex in one system or a small group of systems. You need to start to understand that a lot of the time just seeing a ship on Dscan and running is a win. You will get to know some locals and you will start enjoying it
---
So you're retarded...got it...
---
And you are too new to remember when Titans didn't exist.
---
 The only good changes I saw as a highsec player from 2007 till 2016, happened on the extremely rare occasions that CCP listened to null, and low, and ignored highsec, and once they introduced it, wh space. The recent changes have literally made wh space "risk free krabbing", which null never had, and my accounts are back in highsec, because in HS i earn more isk with less risk than null. This should not be possible, but somehow it is. I can make an average of 450 mil an hour in HS doing incursions with filaments, or I can lock down a wh for 4 hours at a time, and make an average of 1.5 bill an hour. Both of these activities are NO RISK. They have nuked null to the point that only most of lowsec is now less profit, same risk. This isn't what Eve should have ever been, but Himlar doesn't understand that.
---
Play star citizen
---
Yup! You win!
---
I actually want to apologize to your parents lmao
---
For trying to speak to them?  yeah you should.  No one should go through your existence...
---
Time to play elite dangerous =d
---
Can your friend be my friend?
---
Thats not a complete thought young man, work on it and get back to us. 
---
What *do* I do for a job?  You're an expert, its pretty widely known what I actually do in the games community, so what is it.
---
Unless you can prove otherwise I'm a respected doctor and you're just a guy who spends 2 weeks a year in a hotel in Thailand with an assortment of young males.
---
I'm guessing it's a 22, the holes aren't big enough for a nine and they are not clean circles either.
---
Can’t transfer remotely.
---
Nicely done
---
Here lies our son,
---
He loved video games, 
---
And hated them,
---
He spent much of his time on a website called Reddit,
---
He posted negatively or sadly most of his time,
---
He couldn't get a podcast going due to his personal problems, but he did Reddit a bunch, too much even,
---
Rest In Peace, /u/Undeadhorrer 
---
Also your coffin will have the shrug emoji on it lmao
---
This seems more like an argument against the idea of the Magic 14 or for reconstructing the Magic 14 into something like 4 "racial basic skills" guides, but it's informative, thanks.
---
I'd argue if the bonuses from the fitting skills are so small, they'd be good candidates for elimination.  I'm also not convinced that Hull Upgrades and Mechanics 5 are really negligible or minor improvements for armor tanking, since T2 modules are gated behind them (which is a 20+% boost depending on the module).
---
I guess the other problems I have is that the idea of racial pilots, by every indication I've been able to find, is outdated, and using racial preferences to eliminate pieces of the Magic 14 just changes the formula from "mandatory for everyone" to "mandatory for everyone flying X race's ships," in which case, considering the glut of racial piloting skills that already exist, the choices added by the Magic 14 are largely redundant with the choices you already make when you decide whose ships you'll fly.
---
The gist is I don't see time-gates as preferable to player skill gates, and I don't think noob traps add meaningful complexity or contribute positively to the game, definitely not for skilled/veteran players.  I'm certain we could design a system that removes most of the noob traps and redundant choices without losing any of the game's extant complexity, freedom, or ability to royally fuck up fitting your ship.
---
You're. A. Fucking. Pleb. Who. Knows. Nothing. About. EvE.
---
Try playing, and not throwing your hands up. Then your opinions may matter. You're current opinion however is literally:
---
"I couldn't manage to do anything so I quit, and everyone should care"
---
Guess what? We don't, because many of us were playing before Titans or supers existed. They were good changes. Join an alliance that is actually decent, and maybe the game will be fun for you again, but I doubt it because your whole rant was: "I don't want to have to learn any new play meta!"
---
wew pando, shots fired @bbc
---
He apparently has, per his Twitter for the past two years at least, but who knows what exactly he's been involved in. I don't believe he's been involved in any level of supercapitals beyond maybe just the odd, mute line member who doesn't say a word. I can say this much, his voice is distinct enough that I would have known him speaking up on voice comms.
---
Eventually.
---
I backed day one.  I'm fucking bored.
---
you, you are part of the [problem](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77156836/)
---
So why are you describing yourself here?
---
I like how you babble trying to make complete thoughts :)
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Any change will have implications needing further balancing. I'd like to see CCP actually announce a long-term vision. At least with CCP Seagull, we were getting some of sort of insight into CCP's vision. 
---
I think the last major announcement like that was when they laid out the groundwork for citadels and the eventual removal of POS's. Of course, we still have POS's in the game.
---
You're missing an arm.
---
7: make them be used in more fights so they die
---
Yea, like they need to do something that isn’t knee jerk gimmick stuff but that idea is just asking for a repeat of what we want to get away from
---
Has star citizen even made any progress at all? I haven’t followed it.
---
As someone who literally started playing yesterday, my two cents on what has almost put me off are:
---
1) The UI provides loads of stuff, but no details on what it all means. I found tactical view by accident, the different views should at least be pointed out.
---
2) The exploration agent missions literally providing no information, I had to Google the basics of probes and found 5 year old posts complaining about the lack of information! Why doesn't the tutorial explain basic things like scanning, cloaks preventing probe launches, probe reloading etc. I still don't fully understand it.
---
So far I feel like Eve is poorly signposted, rather than being difficult.
---
I played this game for more than a decade.
---
You may be too sheltered by the small scale lifestyle of wormholing (or flair baiting)
---
But the issue isn’t that people figured out how to play the damn game.  It’s that there isn’t a reason to risk what they get from playing.
---
3 accounts.
---
My main is subcap combat (cruisers and below, though I'm working on command ships atm), porpoise/orca boosting and PI. 2 cyno/PI alts on this account.
---
Second account is a dread alt, rorq (not that I have ever had one), industry, exhumers and PI. Also technically my second best subcap pilot. Was also training some skills toward a Fax. 2 cyno/pi alts, one of which sits 3 jumps from Jita. 
---
Third account is carrier, fax, jumpfreighter, exhumer, and pi. 2 alts too (cant remember what they can do atm though, they may be cyno capable but are definitely pi capable), one of which I was starting to train toward a jumpfreighter.
---
2 alphas of undefined role that I don't typically use. One was maxed out under the old alpha skill cap for caldari ships.
---
i have a feeling you don't know or remember how crazy it was to see someone actually using a bhaalgorn, that was considered crazy talk back then, you would probably see only 1 single titan on your playtime and it was right next to a pos bridging people into the fight if even you saw one at all, it was the most important asset of an alliance so only used when it mattered a great sight for any player. idk if you remember when being a capital pilot was a big deal, training time probably on an alt and you where sure to be someone with enough game knoledge to afford it, hence YOU where an asset and not just someone with an archon, things have changed.   
---
Nowadays the ship that you fly means nothing, nothing about your experience, wealth nor anything. i can only think about it mattering if we talking about uniques and to a FAR lesser extend faction titans. And not even with these high price items as you can afford uniques quite easely with current isk values. no need to grind fro years or lean how to play, either krab in safety or rmt cheap, 6 months and you got your faction titan, a bit more and you have an unique, it's a sad state really.
---
You shouldn't see caps so long as you stay in Etherium and don't shoot important structures (jump gates).
---
New player here, how can I un-useless my UI?
---
#
---
I'm not sure when the last time you checked on it was, but you can actually play it right now. It's still quite early alpha though, it's more of a glorified tech demo than anything.
---
are you calling me a .1%er ?
---
how many titans and supers have you used? please post in-game evidence, tia
---
How long did that idea remain to be the case, 1-2 years? 
---
As with most things in this game, we see that if there's a market and a means for players to profit, they will figure out the most efficient means to do so. As an example, it was normal for players to compress minerals using railguns and then reprocessing the items because that was the most efficient means of working around the logistics of moving millions of M3 of minerals to where you were actually building. 
---
Keepstars are no different. It was thought that Keepstar BPO's were so expensive that only the most affluent alliances and individual players would be able to build them, not to mention the material costs involved. 
---
Now we have the beginnings for the proliferation of Keepstars - ignoring Goons who have basically carpet bombed Delve with them.
---
You can land on some of them now in SC.
---
You forgot that games are supposed to be fun.
---
If you just want to krab, sure, you can do that without training anything.
---
If solo/small-gang PvP is what you're interested in?  You don't stand a chance against competent players without T2 modules unless you're vastly more skilled than any genuinely new player is.  Enemies in the same ship, with enough time spent training for a similar build, can out-DPS you by factors of 2 or more while having significantly greater ability to mitigate your damage.  You as a noob trying to break into PvP face objective numerical disadvantages and inevitable player skill deficiencies.  Truth is you'll be lucky to survive long enough to even begin to learn what you're doing wrong.
---
You might argue their fit costs overwhelmingly more than your noob shitfit and obviously deserves to soundly kick your ass, but you as a noob have neither the option to equip ships to their level nor the option to choose a gentler introduction to PvP.
---
New player here, I agree with all these issues. The tutorials lack basic information. I had to google basic things like scanning and found five year old posts complaining about the same problems. It's insane.

The first system is nearing completion, it's slow but steady.

 You're missing an arm.

Titans 1000% are disposable
---
Maybe even 2000%
---
They DO represent the flaws of ccp in the game

Players are also the problem

Especally players that cant seam to underatand the problems of the game from a strategic level

Prove me wrong
---
You can queue up beyond 24h remaining now?  How fancy...

Lol, i just responded to the comment. I've been playing since 2007, so I've been in EvE since before Himler. Changes come, changes go. Hell, if you'd asked me at this time 3 years ago if I would ever leave high sec, I'd have laughed at you. My flair, obviously, tells how well that worked out.
---
Titan man bad.
---
CEO man bad.
---
When you say system, do you mean programming system or actual solar system? Coz I thought it was meant to be procedurally generated?
---
I dont think those words mean what you think they mean, which thought isn't complete? Try and be specific, like your taste in boys, only with words.
---
Please relax a bit. You are not really reacting to the quote you're giving anyways. The important parts are that
---
* they don't fit the "design pattern" (in their current form)
---
* they can be stored "in perfect asset safety forever"
---
* they don't "have any operating expenses"
---
I consider those as hints that he would like to change the second and third point. At another point in the talk he also said that let's other do the balancing work (very roughly paraphrasing I don't have time to find that part and someone made a reddit post to remind us that we should only look at the patch notes for changes because any other announcement can be changed. Especially, stuff which is just throwing around ideas in a rocking chair)
---
As a last remark, titans are much cheaper than zkill says. Titans are not traded enough in NPC stations and freeports that zkill can pull from those estimates. It also doesn't work to use the parts to build them because the capital components are also overpriced in empire. Go to https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/?typeid=671 and choose ME 7, nullsec and T1 rig then you have Job Material Cost: 46,104,417,792.02 + Install price of maybe a billion maybe a bit more. Of course you need the BPC over all you end up with about 50b. You would actually pay even a bit less as if you go to the single components and build them from ME10 BPCs in nullsec again you pay mostly less than the estimates. If you start to consider that you source from ores and not minerals, that ores are cheaper than minerals and that you probably have access to a perfect refiner somewhere it becomes even a bit cheaper but not orders of magnitude cheaper. This remark has gotten to long. The point is that the estimate of 73b for an erebus hull on zkill is much to high. It's rather 50b or less.
---
Nobody blames you for using the power given to by CCP but it's time things changed for the good of the game as a whole, you guys always crow about how quickly you can adapt and it's usually true so this shouldn't really worry you at all.
---
Who wouldn't love having a player base populated almost entirely of fat autistic neckbeards?
---
&gt; which thought isn't complete?  
---
All of them.
---
Come on BTBB we know his capital experience is limited to hi sec capitals.
---
You realize that you can contact PA directly with your concerns, right? 
---
Unlike CCP, I'm pretty sure PA's main goal is profit, and they would likely listen if a decent number of their customers sent them emails explaining how those profits are being jeopardized by the incompetence of one of their employees.
---
I think the scary part about this is Hilmar talking about the “operating cost” of titans.
---
The really strange and difficult part of EvE is that anything they do to try to balance the scales is going to impact everyone else(!) even more than the super powers that be. 
---
So he wants to make titans harder/more expensive/riskier to use. I really can’t think of a method or mechanic that DOESN’T effect the smaller groups more than Goons/Imperium. They are already ahead of the power curve so anyone behind them will have a much harder time adjusting to the “higher operating cost”
---
A lot. They are at version 3.6 currently. Stanton systems seems mostly implemented. You can Fly to all the planets and.moons. several landing zones with cities and mission types ranging from transport missions over dog fighting to FPS missions. Ships are now buyable ingame without real money. They also fixed the atrocious performance around... 3.0 or so? Its actually playable now and not a complete diashow. Progress is still reset with every new patch. But its coming together and you can finally see an actual game.
---
The SP campaign is scheduled for 2020 now I think.
---
They start with procedural generation, edit per hand and then put it into the game.
---
What are you doing with sentries?
---
The rattlesnake is probably the best platform for them, dominix, nestor, praxis (can be fit as a cheap rattle, may require fitting mods), and a few cruisers and BCs are all decent with sentries.
---
The problem is, what are you wanting to do with them? Sentries are stationary, it's like deploying turrets next to your ship. They don't move, but they have instant application, unlike other drones that have to move to their target.
---
But their attack range, despite what their optimal/fall off suggest, are limited to your drone control range. So unless you're fitting mods/rigs to extend their targeting range, they're mid-range at best weapons platforms.
---
They also don't move, so if you're in a ship that needs to kite or stay mobile, you'll move out of the range that you can quickly scoop them, so you may end up losing them if aggro switches or you need to run.
---
Despite those qualifiers, sentries are very useful for specific tasks. They work great with the rattle. They're good for PVE and have a place, occasionally, in PVP. They're best paired with a second set of non-sentry drones if hostiles/rats get in close to you.
---
Pay very close attention to their attrobutes, if you're ratting or running missions, be aware that the drone that has the best damage application for the situation may not have the right optimal/tracking and ends up being of little use to you (such as by having very limited range). So you may have to use sentries that shoot into the 2nd or 3rd resist hole.
---
Anyway, they're very much worth having, but they're not a complete package. You'll almost always want a variety of drone types in your bay.
---
A rattle will let you bring heavy, sentry, medium, and small (though only heavy and sentry benefit from the hull bonus) and you should bring a variety with you.
---
The downside of the rattle is that it is a shield/missle ship, while most of the other drone boats are armor/turret ships. So a skill plan that starts you off with a VNI or myrm and then domi will require skilling armor and turrets (hybrids or lasers), then to move to the rattle you'd need to suddenly train a lot of shield and missile skills.
---
So if your end goal is the rattle, it may be best to start with its little brother the gila. 
---
The gila/rattle route will require twice the number of skill points in space ship command than simply going vexor/myrm/domi. The first route requires both Gallente and Caldari ship skills, while the second requires only Gallente. 
---
The rattle and gila are, for the most part, the unquestionable kings of sub-capital PVE. They have ridiculous tanks and damage output.
---
"Noooo not my precious titan!"
---
Problem is it used third party code, otherwise they’d release it. The Dust514 discord talks about it sometimes.
---
I am using Z-S overview.  There are quite a few popular overviews out there that the overview experts made.  
---
People tend to choose one that they like and modify it at times to fit their needs.
---
As for the local chat channel, you have to have it on a separate window elongated so you can see everyone in the system.  (Doesn't work for Null sec now due to blackout and also doesn't work for wormholes)
---
I don't disagree that players might interject their own perspective and opinions, which may be for their benefit. 
---
That's up for CCP to be mature about and act like rational adults to consider when actively developing and maintaining the game. 
---
Please tell me again about my position on supercapitals:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/crsi4s/ccplease\_update\_capitals\_and\_supercapitals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/crsi4s/ccplease_update_capitals_and_supercapitals/) 
---
"CCP CEO Hilmar has shown us a stunning lack of insight into how probably the most iconic and awe-inspiring part of EVE Online actually works and actually wants to get rid of it."
---
That pretty much sums everything up in the long post.
---
This is so wrong in so many ways.
---
Veterans know how bad changes play out, people like yourself completely lack any ability to see a few days down the road. The majority of people playing this game are veterans - if you nuke what veterans have worked towards for years then you lose the majority of your player base. You're just another salty wannabe elite pvper who's jealous of the hard work and time others put into acquiring what they have. Stop being lazy.

Well see now you're just a liar, a hypocrite, **and** a pedophile.  Theres plenty of complete thoughts in here, and they've been being read and laughed at by other people all night long.
---
Theres literally a room full of people right now watching you get outed as a liar and a kid fucker.
---
We used to say it back when DAOC was a thing, it worked then and it still works now. :p
---
Solar system
---
Well I already get more brain damage  the longer I read your post. That should be enough ..
---
Yeah, and they're pretty well detailed. But SC is basically just a screenshot generator. There's dogfighting, shit cargo running, and the early states of mining. That all gets boring real quick so it generally ends up being you flying around looking at things.
---
If you don't nuke what veterans have worked for years to achieve then you will lose the majority of the playerbase. Stagnation is as bad as constant change. 
---
And i think its hilarious how now i'm an elite pvper when earlier was a turbokrab. Make up your fucking mind.
---
Personally, i'd make them useless against subcaps (through lack of damage application), make them better against structures (different damage caps maybe) and other capitals and watch the problem solve itself through the players adjusting to the new meta/usage the changes create. In the course of a few months people who don't like them would either take them out on risky fights and lose more of them to go out in a blaze of glory, or recycle/sell the materials and extract their SP. That's a lot of isk right there to plex for quite a few months (or even years) and still have leftover isk to do pretty much anything you want in the game.
---
It seems that all the players who don't want to rebalance capitals conveniently forget a very important point. Supercarriers and especially titans were never envisioned as personal assets or means of deleting subcaps from grid, but as strategic alliance assets used in capturing territory (mainly, structure grinding and fighting/supporting other caps). You know, something for a **group** of players to work towards as a team and have fun accomplishing stuff. They are weapons of mass destruction pretty much, not regular front-line units.
---
So all the talk about "what happens to the players who set this as their personal endgame goal" is pretty much null and void, along with the accompanying arguments in favor of asset safety and ability to dock.
---
You want to fly a titan? That's really cool. Get your friends together, build it, skill up a few alts or even your mains and take turns flying it if you don't want to coffin your characters. Everything else is just a case of "i want more shiny toys for me personally". And once you get them, since the investment is so big for a single player to shoulder, it is naturally followed by demands to make them more powerful, safer, etc etc etc, to the detriment of every other playstyle in the game. That's just bad game design right there.
---
Sure, it's CCP's fault for making it so and not fixing it earlier, but it needs to be fixed, they know it needs to be fixed and if i was in their shoes i'd prefer losing a few hundred or even a couple thousand players (referring to actual persons here, not their dozens of characters/alt-farms which artificially inflate the concurrent player metrics) in the short term, if it meant the long-term survival of the game, rather than pander to the "king of the hill" minority of the playerbase and just have the game slowly die in the process through stagnation (it's already happened on the Chinese server).
---
As for big fights, they are good for making headlines but they are not enjoyed by everyone as much as you think. There are other play styles besides pressing F1 in 1% TiDi that require less SP and isk investment, but way higher player skill investment.
---
For some people, end-game is industry. For others it's trade. For others it's being able to roam nullsec solo, pick fights, provoke a response, maneuver with good tactical sense to stretch it thin, get a couple of kills and get out alive (which tbh is probably one of the most, if not the most, skill intensive playstyles in the game). And guess what, they should be viable.
---
The fact that you need a few dozen million SP more to sit in a titan doesn't make your way of playing the game superior or inferior to anyone else's, so there's no need for special treatment. You choose your own adventure. Sometimes things get buffed, sometimes they get nerfed, and this may have a positive or negative effect on your playstyle. But the game is not just your playstyle, it's an ecosystem. You need both predators and prey (and layers in between where you can fall prey to something and still prey on something else). If you get too much of one and too little of the other, the whole thing just crumbles to dust and everything dies.
---
In all honesty, be glad you were there when the going was good and your ship was OP as all hell, take one on the chin and acknowledge that if it's bad for the overall health of the game, it's going to get hit by the nerfbat at some point. In the long run the maximization of your personal enjoyment doesn't matter as much as having a little less enjoyability, but for a lot more people. Because if it's only you who has something enjoyable to do, there's no reason for the rest of us to play and you can just play by yourselves with 3000 players on the server, half of which will be cyno alts.
---
well, you're talking about a company that threw millions of Euros out of the window and burned some other millions for games, that never made it to the market while laying off the complete customer departement and crippling their cash cow EVE through cheap and unsatisfying game breaking changes....

Drifter attacks on citadels
---
A big part of the reason why titans and super carriers are so awe inspiring is because they are orders of magnitude more powerful and tankier than most things an average player will encounter. This utterly breaks the game as the average shifts up and up towards having them available.
---
And something needs to be done to restore some kind of balance.

Also, I'm new to Goons. I played in high sec for a decade before I joined some corp I'd never heard of (ASCEE) and ended upstairs n Goons.
---
My worry, and some others here is that Himler will "salt the earth" so effectively with his random flipping of tables to try to get his bonus, that he will leave the game in a literally unplayable state. He has shown, very clearly, that he gives no shits about the game or us, he just wants his $100,000,000 bonus.
---
NC didn't use any titans or supers to defend their space up north recently.
---
We're so salty over this change that isn't even going to happen that I don't even know what we're gunna do with it all when the titan nerfs hit...
---
This is a great post, well done.
---
Titans aren't the problem, it's the extreme void between players who want to put effort into the game and players who don't want to do fuck all but believe they deserve easy mode.
---
This.
---
I know eve is spaceships etc. but also it needs to evolve to keep fresh blood. 
---
Some actual gameplay with planets would be really cool, even redone PI where player can land to take cargo for better ISK etc
---
Fucking broken records. Every one of you comes around suggesting maintenance fees and ship degradation. We use nanotechnology for everything. Why would ships wear out when a common armor or hull repair can spray nanites all over everything and make it brand new again. Besides, Minnie pilots are proud of their rusty ships.
---
I've got a friend who farmed a titan in a week.
---
If you get this emotional on a game discussion board you should go out more.
---
Its like Jade Constantine with a 1/16 of the talent.
---
Yes. There are three landable planets, each with multiple moons. Two more planets coming at the end of this year. Gameplay is slow to come online but the tech has really moved on.
---
Don't play stupid, please. You know that DD's only cost if you use them and that having a clone bay in a keepstar online is neglectable on a bloc level. You can create a titan stash which essentially doesn’t has any costs while being inactive.
---
At least my eyes won't bleed, just my ears

2 accounts

---
2 - Initially setup as a Cyno alt for my main and trained to be a perfect Leshak pilot, but not have to train some recon skills to be a Cyno I guess.
---
Common skills: Incursion running for both, I can run both accounts in High Sec Incursions to make the ISK. Spare toons on both accounts are setup for PI which is conducted in Null.
---
This is p cringe tbh and inaccurate in more ways than one but you spent the time to write so I won't correct
---
Having to go out of game to find pretty much anything of use is also a major PITA.
---
&gt;What droneboats should I be working on getting first/medium/end game.
---
Tristan - Vexor - Myrmidon - Dominix would be the cookie cutter progression.
---
Rattlesnake is not actually needed, it's certainly an overkill for L4 missions, expensive as hell compared to the Domi and overall its bonuses are more oriented towards heavy drones/Gecko than sentry drones.
---
&gt;From what I can tell rattlesnake soloing with a tractor beam is really profitable once you get high enough in mission levels.
---
Highest mission level in highsec is 4 and and any drone battleship can do it easily. All you need is 100km drone control range/drone range and a Micro Jump Drive Generator. Tractor Beam is really old stuff, we have Mobile Tractor Units nowodays.
---
Been able to do that for like 5 years now, only alphas have that restriction.

I’ve been running frigate abyssals with 3 hawks.

Did you tell her to donate all her allowance for Star Citizen?

I mean there are a few bad eggs, but have you looked around other scenes lately?  I feel like Eve's bad outliers have stayed about the same while some other gaming communities (particularly MOBAs and battle royals) have just gotten much worse than they used to be.

"I was firing from the edge of falloff!"
---
It's sad how long it took for CCP to understand it.
---
It makes sense as long as there is a range system to adding to the bounty.. Like you must be within 3 jumps (actually in system seems more reasonable) to add to the bounty.. It shouldn't be a case of just search info, right click drop bounty..
---
Did not include people shuffling. Literally unwatchable.
---
Here we see the Minmatar Stabber in it's natural environment.  The circle of life complete, it will now warp off to an empty local to die peacefully to a cloaky proteus.
---
It's typical CEO behaviour and nothing to worry about, the game has been in states far more unplayable than right now, crotchety veterans who despise change will no doubt tell you the sky is falling but that's typical crotchety veteran behaviour and also nothing to worry about.
---
The game hasn't shown this much promise since the build up to Incarna and although that didn't end well the new focus is far more realistic than pre-incarna proposals but if the entirety of null-sec spits their dummies out over nerfs to obviously OP shit they might decide it's less hassle to just make skins than any meaningful changes to the game...
---
In other words, if it all goes to shit I'll be blaming the "nerf everyone but me" crowd and not CCP or Hilmar.
---
Yeah, I remember Lumpymayo totally bollocksing up a BNI bombing run to the point where he bailed and left everyone to fend for themself
---
jfs iirc are pretty good

I feel you. It's every time.
---
A faster align time is probably going to save you more than a faster speed.
---
p sure he gets off on his own writing.
---
More like hipsters... one Yeats is 74 years.
---
Caps and especially supers shouldn't be able to one-shot kill frigates and maybe even dessies. Nerf tracking of all the fighters hard. That would fix a lot of current problems in EVE.
---
Titans were a mistake. It was becoming obvious in 2010, it was undeniable in 2013.
---
They're unbalanced and unbalancable.
---
Death to all titans.
---
Titans are absolutely the fucking problem.
---
You're not wrong. You're staying what's been obvious for years.
---
not really. EVE has some pretty set-in-stone definitions of things, as "small gang" is one of them. It's like Logi and Logistics.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Then in a week imagine what hunters could put together to kill said titan
---
It’s a two way street
---
At the time of quitting, I had five (non-super) caps. 
---
I quit because it was *the* way to play. The meta was, and still is, about having a fuckoff big pile of jump drives and projecting overwhelming force to wherever needed.
---
Theres a difference between disposable and trashing for no reason
---
You got me
---
It's still the second most-negative gaming community (and 40th overall) on Reddit, AFAIK. And battle royale communities have the excuse of being made up disproportionately of children who don't know any better, while the EVE community is mostly grown-ass adults devoting disproportionate time and effort to bitching about a *video game* as though it had real-life consequences while furiously masturbating to the thought of the game dying.
---
The wall of text from this thread makes me think there are still people that dont understand this Unfortunatly
---
So you could do nothing on your own for 8 years than became a drooling sheep and now you think your opinion matters somehow?
---
Completely agree. The question is how? 
---
You have some games, such as World of Tanks, which have continued to introduce more options to help counter certain play styles.

I believe that for Titans in particular, they should be not effective against Subcapitals, so removing AEO DD's, such as the Boson and Lance, and then removing their ability to use HAW's, is one part to that. I don't believe that increasing the damage output of focused DD's would be beneficial and that they are currently in a good place there. The DD cycle time could be reduced by maybe a second or two, which isn't much for normal fights without Tidi, but will increase the number of dead Titans during heavy/max Tidi fights. 
---
I think CCP did remove the unintended tether mechanic where Titans would re-tether immediately after a focused DD if the intended target is destroyed. Would have to double-check that though.
---
The greatest item of importance needed though, is conflict drivers to encourage Titans being placed into exposed positions when players might incorrectly believe there is diminished risk. I would prefer this to be a case of where players are blowing up each other's ships; however, not fully opposed to the idea of NPC's being able to kill titans. The latter of which would certainly need to involve careful implementation though, as we all know, we're good at breaking and exploiting things.
---
Upvoted because its true.
---
People whove never farmed, whove never anchored sotiyos or got the rigs and then mined up a TITAN's worth of ore to build it.
---
and then, never sat in a titan to try and fly it and see what goes into it...
---
Are whining the most.
---
it's seem to be too easy to capture., compare to TEST that actually bumped Nyx to death which are way much epic compare to this.
---
Yes, but not in either Goons or BoB. I watched from the outside as a quite newb player thinking it was crazy and interesting.
---
So you could do nothing on your own for 9 years than became a drooling sheep and now you think your opinion matters somehow?
---
And youre mad that overwhelming force wasnt with a lack of jump drives?  You're just salty to be salty man.
---
disposable is literally a term applied to something that needs to be thrown in the trash
---
How much effort should a capital pilot put in once they have their capital?
---
My views on capital balance is that;
---
1. the effort required to *first get them* is acceptable,
---
2. insurance payouts make replacing dead ones too easy, and 
---
3. there is not effort required from players to operate them. 
---
I think **jump-drives are easy mode**. If CCP set max range to 0ly, most of my issues with them would vanish. How many people are going to put the effort into gating Avatars around?
---
alright, you went too far, this friendship is over
---
Agree there should be more incentives to drop these in fights so they have a chance to die.  Otherwise you get a progressively growing collection of hangar titans and supers j til they deploy and eve takes a collective number 3 at the sheer number you’ve amassed.
---
the people playing the game are all people who have been playing for some time, the newer players who play remain b/c they have been brought into communities by veterans - you're severely misguided and out of touch with player beyond your bubble
---
Titans aren't a problem if they can't hit subcaps
---
Have you ever played this game or not?
---
Used to have like 6-7. main, couple cap alts, super, utility alt, something else I forget what. I've unsubbed a lot of stuff though. Down to just the main and I basically don't play anymore.
---
How cute, I have an obsessive fan.
---
It was nerfed already this year.  Trust me carriers and even supers can’t one shot a frigate or destroyer rat even
---
Doesn't *have* to be your Keepstar. If it's not your Keep, do you count that as part of the cost?
---
One does PVP. The other mines and goes to Jita.
---
This is a really well done video
---
I would have a lot of fun flying bombardment catalysts in low sec at the district beacons. The reason it was fun was because you got to cackle as scouts would keep trying to dscan you down without realizing districts were a thing. The actual bombing part was boring from above though
---
Why is your tldr so long? It was literally too long so i didnt read.
---
Also, remove asset recovery.
---
:(
---
&gt;they were not rare as shit, they were just used less 
---
That's also fine. 
---
If they're not used, they're not seen. So when they were seen, it mattered more.

Far more than you i’d wager
---
How?
---
You'll hate me for this but;
---
There is roughly a 10/1 ratio in PVE only vs PVP in every game that has a PvP option.
---
There's a small really stupid EvE group that demands killing anything anywhere anytime.
---
What that amounts to is killing subscriptions of people who can't abide PvP in any form.  
---
I PVP exclusively.  I started in 2003 pirating, then did war decs for 6 years then created Privateers Alliance which blanket decced EvE and got nerfed. Then I hunted alliances in null.
---
I don't think you could say I'm a carebear but I understand at 10 to 1 pve / PvP if we let people pve in relative peace that:
---
1 there's a lot more money for development
---
2 there's a much increased chance of some carebears going rogue and going to PvP part-time or full time.
---
If you can't find fights with war decs, in low, null, wormholes then something is seriously wrong.
---

My 9 yr old boy was exactly the same! Why can’t you go down there? What about walking around the station daddy can you do that?!
---
I moved to null with a net value of over 100,000,000,000 isk, eith no less than 3 full POS, a citadel, and 280 fully researched BPO. Three of which were BS BPO.
---
Now I own 600 fully researched BPO, and several of those are capital component, or cap ship BPO. 
---
I wouldn't say I wasn't able to do anything in high sec, I would say I took advantage of an opportunity to make isk faster when it presented itself.
---
Oh, and as a 12 almost 13 year veteran, yeah, I do think my opinion matters, because right now the game is still limping along. Take a look at the economic report for July and August. We don't know what August is going to say quite yet, but we can guess. July showed a 30% decrease in activity over the whole of Eve, but only a 10% decrease in Delve. That alone should tell you something. We don't like the changes, because everyone else docked up. We literally are putting out bait myrmidons, Dominix, and rorquals trying to get some sort of content, but it is barely working.
---
Then you'd know as much as anyone else that what is required to kill titans is completely unreasonable with their huge buffers and the strength of FAX reps.
---
It would be interesting to have ground teams brawl in citadels to keep them working at 100% efficiency in a siege. But alas, too much effort to balance, I s'pose.
---
I have to agree. Overall the EVE community takes some time to really dive into, but once you get there you feel at home. Going to meetups for this game and seeing people who have knows each other for decades flying spaceships, y'all are wholesome. 
---
I don't care and you won't convince me otherwise. Bad apples and nerd rage be it what it is. Y'all are still wholesome as fuck inside, if only when you log off.
---
Well that's just perfect for her, she's 5 so when she's like 15 or something she can just play the finished Star Citizen ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I've lost 50+ T1 frigates this month alone with what I consider not a lot of playtime. It might sound like a lot but I only spent approx 600mil ISK. The amount of knowledge I gained was enormous.

Do you have a special rorq rolling fit? Rolling holes has been quite annoying to do for me, even more while static farming because any new sig would mean going back and rolling the static. Like if you know there's people around, you can't have the rorq out, they'll never leave you alone?

I need 4.5M SP to get that rorq going. I don't really like the rattles that much anymore because the pith-x xl-sb really got too expensive

I started my entire Eve career in a big null Bloc alliance. Thought I was hot shit for a few years, I knew somethings about some ships and even a few things about some of the modules. I was a true F1 warrior. 
---
I decided I'd humble myself, bought 50 T1 Frigates and decided I was going to actually learn things about this game. I've lost all 50 this month alone and I have plenty of kills to show for it. But the first few days I'd die 2-5 times in a row. It took me a few weeks but I started to learn what I could and could not engage. I am starting to get the hang of on-grid positioning. Learning ranges of different weapon types and ships and their bonuses.
---
I still have tons to learn but one thing is clear. The road to becoming not shit is steep indeed. But it's a blast making the journey!

It's b. 
---
I even said as much in my top-level comment.
---
 I like your ideas.
---
I would suggest that haw stay on the dreads, but you are right Titans don‘t need them.
---
The ideas on carriers are good. Especially the idea with the nsa. Ppl will go into sebos but that will nerf their tank or makes them earn less isks. Both is better than the blackout and the cyno nerf.
---
Faux: well, they shouldn‘t be able to rep subcaps. But in terms of big super incredible fights they are not perfectly balanced but okayish.
---
1st offence in botting gives a 3 day ban I think
---
I never got a chance to bombard anything. Did you have to know exactly where a battle was taking place to actually do that?

I thought you hadn't played for ten years.

We're discussing Titans, not capitals.

then don't fucking come on here acting like you know what the shit you're talking about

it's almost like people don't understand things grow with time
---
I like the idea of seeing others activity tracker... kinda like comparing achivements in other games
---
Building and fueling the keepstar sure as fuck isn't neglectable, if they were there would be a whole lot more of them.
---
heyoo
---
Now who's salty lmao.
---
&gt;But I appreciate your nullbear point of view on what you assume I do. Shouldn't you be off crying about cyno changes, or blackout, or something else interfering with your "ticks?"
---
I would be if these mattered to me. Cyno changes I don't care for. I do dislike the fact that cloaked cowardice is such a strong playstyle rn though. Also you can't say I'm making assumptions then make a load of yourself. I'm not the one with a flair for a shit-tier noob killing corp. 
---
&gt;If you want to talk about easy mode, tell me who has intel networks, standing fleets, titans on every gate, and PANIC modes?
---
Idk, rorq miners in delve?
---
Iv seen 3 titans ever in game ever, plus an NPC one. No corp I've ever been in has had them on every gate. I've also never owned a rorq. 
---
And intel? As if you can't use also intel to find out how many people are ratting and docked or undocked in a system at any given time. Don't cry about intel when it has always been just as strong for an attacker as a defender. 
---
&gt;Because what I do, I do alone and I'm damn good at it.
---
Lmao and what is that? Bitch online? Call people nullbears? Gank ventures? 
---
&gt;You need a couple thousand neckbeard brothers to be moderately competent

I don't like neckbeards, nor am I one. That's a whole lot of projection.

This doesn't even make any sense. I also don't tend to bind my guns to F1, just FYI. 
---

---
Cry more. Did the venture bring backup? Why are you so mad??
---
hmm, I never tried with bombs, only torp. Well, let's try again I guess ! 
---
thx !
---
So it takes a lowsec alliance to bring fun super cap fights to null? Null must be in a very good state right now.....
---
I’m sure someone has mentioned this already but Star Citizen is a great game!
---
so it ALMOST seems like the general logical common sense nullsec-wide shared opinion that Titans shouldn't be able to hit subcaps would be the better answer vs you're mongoloid knee jerk sputterings?
---
I admit i've never flown a titan that part is ideas from the titan pilots in my alliance. Hell they were cool with going back to the old days of either logging in a safe or a pos.
---
I was referring to them making the game in the first place. He posted on twitter a few weeks back that their initial success with EVE was completely by chance. Which isn't even true, it was due to the much better devs they had back then which have since left the company.

When titans were released there were projected to only be a handful ever produced and in game at one time.  That was the aim.  Clearly it failed.
---
They were supposed to be undockable locking the pilot to the ship or requiring a holding character.  Clearly another fail in the original aim.

Whether or not you consider the changes good or bad since then Hilmar is correct in the context of the original design.

Played since 2003 and I think you're absolutely wrong.  The CSM, stacked with major null alliances completely decked EvE.

That's a pathetic amount of time, it should be at least a week or two, and a heavy in game fine.
---
Yes, that was the shitty thing. So I'd go to systems with dusties in local, then join voice chat in game with them. They'd start a match, tell me where, and I'd start racing through fw systems to get to their planet before the match ended.

Right? I don’t have any real want to be a titan or super pilot but I’m all for other people flying those beasts. I remember reading that titans were looked at as something almost unobtainable when the game first came out, but when you have Rorqs and the means for mining, refining, production and injecting skill points of wanted it’s not “if” you could own a titan or super but when you can own a titan or super. I’m ok with balance changes and stuff but what is CCP going to do? Just take Titans or supers from people to drop the numbers? Don’t think so. We are far far past that point of change.
---
They're chinese who have multiple vpns banning just doesn't really work sadly (russians too). Ccp as much work as it would be need to start using an anti-cheat program. In soviet russia bots farm you!
---
I mean Hilmar seems like a cool guy... that doesnt know shit about playing EVE Online.
---
You know that those "doctrine ships alliances" all consist of a lot of small corps who on their own do a lot of stuff? We do everything from drops, roams and hi-sec PvP - only difference is that by joining one of the larger alliances, making enough money to finance all the fun is facepalm easy.
---
Oh, and yeah, the larger battles are pretty fun too when they happen.
---
certain things need tweaking, minor changes that would even out the playing field - these mongoloids don't fucking understand how shit works though and are screeching for extreme game changes
---
CCP did have us flying above the planet atmosphere in the Permafrost event. The camera was wonky at first and it was all somewhat "slapped together", but some potential to flying closer to the planeta was there at least.
---
Sadly no more has come of that.
---
I don't know why in a game where they claim that botting is insanely rampant they don't just start throwing around 30-90 bans for first botting offenses.
---
\&gt; \[EDIT\] [Turns out OP only got his titan two months ago, and is salty that it might lose value in an upcoming balance change](https://zkillboard.com/character/126500275/ship/671/). 
---
get baited harder on an alt account lmfao
---
They are the perfect bot, you can not give any data away that you are a bot if you just sit on a gate and don't input anything for CCP to record.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
I agree that they need to be made useless against subcapitals and really need to be focused as anti-structure/anti-capital assets. You are certainly correct that there would be some natural attrition with those changes; however, most players tend to simply just retain the ships either logged off or, with Keepstars now, docked in storage. It's not really economical anymore for players in larger groups, such as the Imperium, because there's actually a large surplus of the hulls available, decreasing the value of the ship itself. 
---
I disagree with your mention about the original intent for titans.
---

Grid-wide DD's were introduced with Titans together. 
---
Interesting note, the first titan was actually finished building before CCP had completed the code for the ship to be launched from the Supercapital Ship Assembly Array. 
---

Funny to listen to the Soundcloud now of Cyvok's ASCN Alliance Meeting:  [https://soundcloud.com/peter-annabel/cyvok-ascn-alliance-meeting](https://soundcloud.com/peter-annabel/cyvok-ascn-alliance-meeting) 
---
Either way, multiboxing has removed the need for multiple players to be involved directly in manufacturing supercapitals. That said, it is more economical for supercapital producers to simply bulk purchase compressed ore/minerals on the cheap, so technically, a group of players is effectively utilized to work towards the production of supercapitals.
---
The fun part is arguable, as mining is a boring grind. 
---
The grind for building supercapitals is still a grind. For many people, there is a sense of achievement when they get their first titan.
---
You are correct that Titans are not front-line units. In the last major campaign involving Goons invading Tribute, subcapital fleets were required in order to clear the way for supercapitals to be used.
---
Titans as a bucket-list/endgame for players is something that comes from it being the largest, most powerful ship in the game. As ISK, and eventually skillpoints, have become more easily available for players, this has resulted in players becoming better able to individually acquire the needed resources to get into these ships. Granted, this is often through the support of alliances and corporations that help these players through the process. 
---
On the flip side, having less experienced players with Titans can also be to their detriment, where mistakes are made when risks are not evaluated correctly or simple errors are made that more experienced players might normally avoid. 
---
The irony about the argument that CCP should have fixed Titans earlier, is that they actually have been trying to over time; however, buffed Titans when they introduced the new doomsday weapons and the ability for Titans to use HAW's.
---
There are fundamental differences between Tranquility and the Chinese server, which means that, despite all of CCP's efforts, we will not see a single alliance take over the entirety of nullsec. The most important, the inherent interest between those actively involved in nullsec politics to not let that happen, as it would result in the death of the game.
---
And sure, the big fights are what draws the attention, but what keeps players is the engagement with the community. 
---
The actual daily gameplay will vary for each player and their motivations for what they want to get out of it. There are not that many big fights that involve titans in comparison to subcapital fights. This can be the lowsec faction warfare PVP to the nullsec mid-size fleet fights.  Point is, that this is why most players have defaulted to having a dedicated titan pilot, even to this day.
---
As far as the 'ecosystem' with Titans being at the very top - I agree that there needs to be balance. To the same end, they are the final tool/asset within PVP in this game as an escalating force. Even when being used in a group, they still require the support of other ships to prevent them from dying in a ball of fire. At the same end, the opposing force has the option to risk their assets in order to defeat that combined force. Sometimes the situation is not consensual ... the current point is that more Titans need to die. Period.
---
Rattlesnake is pretty much one of the Kings of level 4 security missions. It's great for doing full clears, awesome tank and awesome dps. Tank from shields and DPS from missiles and drones.
---
Depending on the corp you join it wouldn't stop you from still doing security missions. 
---
The Worm, Gila and rattlesnake are pretty great ships to fly in nearly all space, both PvP and PvE. And the skills needed to fly them well (Shield, Drones, Missiles) are very useful everywhere as well.
---
Drifter holes are used a lot for travelling by hunting fleets as they have many connections all over the place. Stuka fleets are quite popular for this hunting.
---
&gt;  The question is how?
---
we don't have enough data on our ends to really know. nor the impartiality to parse it. 
---
I do agree tho that if capital and subcapital gameplay is going to remain mostly unchanged they need to be seperated. either by making it so that caps cant punch down on subs or so that caps are actually vulnerable to subs. 
---
although i don't know what i do agree that there needs to be something active to push people to fight each other. a big part of the stagnation and wealth increase in null is because the amount spent on destruction is way way down. it's down because people have no reason to fight each other. people aren't just going to fight tho, they need to be given a reason to fight.
---
stagnation will kill this game as dead as shaking it up too much. But your crying for the maintenance of the status quo i think is a far more sad death for the game than for it to go out in a blaze trying to stay alive rather than gasping its last breath as people just give up.
---
Vexor straight to a hel lmao.
---
The normal progression steps such as a battleship, then a carrier were too much for him I guess?
---
If they were so disposable, why did NC and PHorde opt to move twice out of staging keepstars when Goons invaded Tribute and the western portion of Vale instead of trying to take a fight?
---
it used to be 30 days, but it got reduced to 3 days a few years ago
---
Check your characters net worth. Then check your assets. You may have a lot more than you think.
---
If you had R&amp;D agents accumulated over 5 years that may also be worth some isk now.
---
If you in 0.0 you most likely in an alliance and Corp ask them for help. If not contract fire sale your nul assets and jump clone back to hi sec and re group.
---
All major problems stems from Multibox'ed Rorquals...
---
its almost like they want to fight botting, but only if it doesn't stop them from getting paid by the botters to keep playing.
---
I currently have 6 accounts subbed. Each 'main' can fly specific subs + racial dread. I have 30ish accounts all together that are useful, split between mining subs and dictor/hauler/else. All accounts could fly VNI's for AFK bashing structures and do PI, though I'm fucking cursed and any time I setup PI whatever group I'm in/running almost immediately gets evicted, and I injected 6 additional accounts into Dreads for a total of 12. I have scaled back my time in the game significantly the last year or two, so now the max accounts I will have subbed is 6 unless I know there is a big bait op or something coming up in which case I'll PLEX the remaining dread alts to use. When I was in Wicked Creek/Detorid/PB I would pretty consistently group mine with 14 subs and rorqual boosts (Never got into excavator mining)
---
Skill farming is currently dependent on prices to go up over time. If you could buy and sell instantly it would be a net loss unless you sub for money
---
So your just stocking up on injectors or what
---
Yes, it's simple, compare the isk you need to sub and extract to injectors.
---
It's a station in a wormhole system, I'd like to be able to instantly undock so I can move my alts into ideal pew pew positions safely, ships im using are battleships with ~10 second align
---
So how are u keeping them all subbed?
---
Still not sure why it was a console exclusive. Seems like an absurd move to me. Wouldve been better on pc
---
Congratulations. What did you expect? A player who's been playing this game who doesn't have or has had a titan?
---
...the cube is small to you?!
---
How do you click on signature dots?
---
Do you have any thoughts on points (1) and (3) I listed?
---
It's very easy to say someone has no credibility, and use that as a basis to refute any arguments they make.
---
The RHEEE is strong!
---
&gt;I thought you hadn't played for ten years.
---
What made you think that? Be specific now, show your working.
---
&gt; You don't stand a chance against competent players
---
Sure in solo pvp against experienced people with good skills.
---
Nobody in their right mind would ever expect ANY mmo to allow that, so it's a really shit argument.
---
Solo PVP isn't a new player profession.

In order to react polymers for T3 production you will need a Hybrid Reactor fitted to an Athanor I am sure you know that you cannot online a Hybrid reactor in high Security space. The other options of Null, wormhole or Low Sec bring with them security issues can you defend your structure if someone comes to kill it (, you will also need to haul fuel and raw materials to it on a regular basis and be able to safely haul your product to market.  This might help with skills needed etc if you have not already seen it :[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tech\_3\_Production](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tech_3_Production)

Eve University Link: [(https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites#Cosmic_signatures)] this also has a ton of extra information as well including what you can expect from each site.

In your Astero or Stratios you should be able to to run sites in Hi/Lo sec
---
Hehe thanks Rote
---
I'm not op, but you either buy loads of plex when low, or you wait for prices to go up. 
---
The margins are tight, it's a lot of isk because it can scale indefinitely. 
---
Or sub for money, which I do. Instead of buying plex for isk.
---
You can make a ticket, and ask CCP to move you.
---
You can ask current regional landlord to invite you to corp?:D

---
Problem was around way before Rorquals in belts.
---
EVE Uni wiki has a lot of that information, zkill and look at losses for that ship to help understand what it was fit for. The large majority of the time ships will be fit according to their bonuses so checking the ship info page in game is helpful.
---
Odd question, is there a way that a copy of shortcuts could be added to this? (Or for some reason is this never going to be a thing? Idk much about programming)
---
&gt;CCP CEO Hilmar has shown us a stunning lack of insight into how probably the most iconic and awe-inspiring part of EVE Online actually works and actually wants to get rid of it. It is insulting to the intelligence of the EVE Online community.

I think the right answer is that you can get sent to any system in your current constellation and 1 constellation over.
---
YES PLZ
---
i spend so much time in help chat having to redo links because i cant use copypasta responses to basic questions
---
I mean for you it is yeah - you literally think capital insurance is a thing.
---
1. I agree with how much effort is required to get them. ALOT.
---
2. Operating the ship may be easy just as carrying a diamond in your hand is easy, but external factors and environmental attributes are things that need to be thought of.
---
If you are moving at all, no carrier is going to one hit you after the fighter application nerf even in a frigate.
---
dreads were best when they were nothing more than massive anti-cap DPS machines, HAW guns are not needed for that. This is the one time I will ever stick up for small gang content, because a HAW dread flown right can solo a gang without ever being in danger short of being counter dropped by other dreads.
---
Wat?
---
PvE has been nerfed into the ground in NS, so go to HS or join a WH corp. Both are 1000% more profitable than NS rn.
---
You prompted a chuckle.
---
The more money a company has, the less they actually do... thats why SC isnt out, thats why blizzard remakes games instead of making new games, thats why CCP is dying, thats why we never had atmospheric flight, which was actually once planned or prototyped but never delivered... 
---
[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pg1dzAvL2M**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pg1dzAvL2M)
---
Well this is a clusterfuck
---
Are T2 mods even worth it?
---
Context: It seems to me that that often T2 modules and weapons only have only marginal (1-5%) benefits over Meta 4 ones that are cheaper and easier to fit. So when its not about maximum crabbing efficiency, not fitting T2 appears to me the more reasonable approach?!
---
The CSM has argued against many of the things that lead us to this point in the game. CCP ignored them and the player feedback and did whatever the fuck they felt like. Now its somehow the players fault for figuring out how to exploit the dumb shit they put in the game.
---
HAW guns have been nerfed by 50% on Titans
---
lol I had the same experience, i was able to get  into the PI screen before she lost interest
---
since its in a WH I'd align it with the Sun or a planet as those are the most probable things someone would have warped to. (excluding WHs and sites as those are randomly spawned)
---
damn that's  shit ton of butt hurt for such a small post.
---
&gt;but external factors and environmental attributes are things that need to be thought of.
---
Are external factors and environmental attributes also things that affect subcaps too? Explain why this is something that needs to be thought of only for capitals. 
---
In any case, back when I was actively playing; that was outsourced to the FC. Dread pilots were F1 monkeys, just as much as subcap pilots were. 
---
Explain how things have changed since I've gone.
---
I've got four accounts.
---
My main can fly most subcaps, and Minmatar supercarriers nearly perfectly, though I don't maintain one for it.
---
Alt #1 can fly Minmatar dreadnoughts, sabres, ceptors, and is my covert cyno toon w/ bomber skills.
---
Alt #2 is mainly my fax alt, but can fly perfect shield and skirmish command destroyer links. 
---
Alt #3 is mainly my titan char, but ever since I got rid of it it's just a secondary dread alt. Minmatar, of course.
---
These are all my combat alts; each of these accounts has one or two T2 industry characters that fuel my PvP adventures. 
---
All told it's about 11 characters with differing purposes from HAC production to doomsdaying.
---
Lmao at test dropping caps on a fucking Drake fleet until being ordered to stop by another fc that actually wants a fight
---
I have always wanted to see what a storm world or a plasma world look like from the surface. I'd love to be able to land and manage my colonies and travel between the various modules. I wanna see what I've built, not just a holographic representation of it!
---
As a wise man once said, instructions are for pussies.
---
You could save alot of cpu on compact mods instead of T1 and T2 but it'll never be enough to run this, the normal probe launcher yes, but if you want combats on/off lining is the only way.
---
P.S. Don't fly the nemesis, it's shit.
---
That‘s true, but I don‘t see the point on titans having HAW weapons.
---
I'm not sure how to align my citadel or where the "axis" of the astrahus is though, which is the problem. I can't just put a bookmark where ever since it'll take the full/longer time to warp which is bad if the citadel's being shot at.
---
So because Titans and supers increases over time, your solution to something that was once "aweinsprising" is to get rid of them completely?
---
&gt; Are external factors and environmental attributes also things that affect subcaps too? 
---
Of course those matter but that's usually FC job, flying capitals requires attention to your surroundings:
---
* capitals are 10-100x more expensive then subcaps?
---
* capitals have shit alignment and warping?
---
* capitals can't defend themselves against a single dictor or HIC? (not a complaint, just statement)
---
* flying a capital will attract other capitals brough in by a small subcap?
---
&gt; In any case, back when I was actively playing; that was outsourced to the FC. 
---
Well that must have been 10 years ago... it's almost like things can grow and develop over time isn't it?
---
&gt; Explain how things have changed since I've gone. 
---
1. Muninns are the only subcap shit worth using.
---
2. A lot of people have supers and titans now.
---
3. Outside of fleet fights stealth bombers are the go-to meta b/c they are cheap, hard to kill, can be anywhere at anytime thanks to blops bridge and wormholes, and do battleship damage.

Thundokir - I salute you!
---
Titans haven’t been buffed
---
the issue is faxes, which is fucking ridiculous from any balance argument and the real problem
---
I don’t get how people argue against change and battling stagnation. We only have to look at the shitshow that is Serenity to see just how far this game can fall. 
---
This titan/superbloc meta/culture/era needs to die and never come back. Admittedly it needs to be replaced by something that will entice newer players and help the game to grow. Don’t ask me what that is, I don’t know. 
---
Plus people who harp about titans being big goals to achieve? Pff they’re like 50b right now...
---
i clicked that so many times
---
Bob, is that you?
---
That’s a valid argument, imho nothing should log off safe ina sandbox, but saying”titans op ccp nerf pve” is just ridiculous and nonsensical 
---
Titans and supers should be at risk even docked, having “coffins” wasn’t fun gameplay ... but it made the decision to train (before skill injectors) meaningful
---
Not enough are lost, and that’s the issue.  Nerfing then to make them used less is retarded, we need them used more and lost more.  Period.
---
And faxes... shouldn’t do what they do
---
same. farm bots for decent loot and then fight their mains who are almost all trash and all have pretty bad ping
---
The fight against the Griffin was one of my first fight, I'm totally aware that I did so many mistakes however I'm working on it ! :)
---
For example in this fight like this one I would:
---
\- try not to overheat my prop and others modules
---
\- disable the auto reload of the SAAR
---
\- keeping at optimal range with Void ammo
---
\- trying to kill him as fast as I can without trying to blap his drone
---
Thank you for the feedback o7
---
CCCP's compliance tram has to stop being a joke. In the past I recall they punished RMT far more severely. Like 1 month ban in first offence. Botting should be punished even more severely as it is the source of RMT itself.
---
217 accounts.
---
Had ~8 to begin with to do FCing/ISK making shit, but CCP didn't understand how MPTC skillfarms worked, so I made a practical demonstration, and I've never seen a reason to stop (except when they were briefly unprofitable).
---
How much isk would u say you’ve made off it
---
We should be able to orbit the planets, set ship to auto pilot and exit the ship. Let there be an access code game to pilot the ship where it takes certain amount of time and rounds to be able to do it.
---
Would be fun with all the content.
---
TBF Snuff did own NullSov for a while to grind up those Supers in the first place.
---
Not sure, if you realize it but the botters not only pay nothing over time, but penalize CCP with copious amounts of real money every day, once they are past break even threshold of their cheat investment.
---
Thanks, appreciate it!
---
A vargur can solo pretty much any C5 site. It won't do it quickly however , and it can't take on a drifter.  A solo Varguer is probably 350-400m an hour. Marauders are super high sp for something that is less useful than snakes. They were neat back in the day as a stepping stone, but they have huge disadvantages
---
You can go down to the planets with PI
---
You mean by giving them whole regions to bot in?
---
Nicely executed execution.
---
Not entirely sure, I've always spent the ISK on dumb bullshit the second I got it, but I dropped around ~60b on the tournament I planned and that was about 2 months of income I think.
---
NSFW
---
1st offence of botting should be permanent ban.
---
In some kind it is a proper side income and even full time job, if you are unemployed.
---
This sub will always seem discontent. It's its default state. Even folk who are completely happy like to jump on the bandwagon-o'-whinge just for funsies. Don't worry about it: you'll find yourself agreeing with some points and laughing at most, and that is fine, but don't put too much stock in what's posted here above your own experience.
---
There are skill plans that exist like the 14-hour Hero tackle. Within 14 hours you can be sitting in a ship that nearly every group will give you for free. At that point you can provide an incredibly useful role in a fleet, tackling an enemy ship. 
---
Will you die? most likely. Will you tackle the enemy ship? Most likely. Will veterans shower you with isk for being a one day new player? Hell freaking yes.
---
Outside of that there are things that are skill locked but every game has "end game" content that requires actual time until you can do it. In Eve there are players who have been playing for years still pvping in sub 1mil ISK Ventures.
---
my b for the last part of my post
---
e\^(−68×0.009 999 999 776 482 582) = 0.5066 it's actually the correct formula with what I found
---
There was no "first cycle" in my test of "cooling is done even when taking heat"
---
You OL your mwd, when it's almost burnt you OL your sebo. you then look at how the heat in the mid rack progresses.
---
I'd add injectors and excavators to that as well.
---
just give permanent bans for 1st offence in botting. That's like attempted murder of a game.
---
Remove HAW guns on Dreads and Titans and rebalance Marauders to fill that role.
---
If you do only small time PvP action, why do you need all that isk and alts?
---
A proper use of alts in a big alliance sov blob would be:
---
1. PvP
---
2. Bubble alt
---
3. Super/Cap alt.
---
4. FAX alt
---
5. Dread
---
Beyond that I have no clue why would people utilize more PvP alts. Maybe N+1 supers, if you are very rich or unemployed.
---
Well, HAW guns are made for capital ships, i.e. XL guns, so it would seem a bit arbitrary to not let them on Titans
---
When Warframe showed off empyrean and squad link I shed a tear for DUST.  This is what DUST could have been had ccp not fumbled so hard.
---
I agree that the new player experience is horrid. But damn is it way better than it use to be.
---
Than the dreads will loose their place. I‘m not sure if this is what we want.
---
But the Marauder definitely need a buff.
---
Yeah but through that you specialize the caps more. Titans for big cap/structure fights and dreads for smaller subcap/cap fights as an addition to the subcapmainfleet.
---
The trick would be a way to encourage titan/super brawls. The irony is these cyno changes might end up making brawls harder. Though this is just speculation atm.
---
Dreads won't lose their place. They should be for anti-cap work, not anti-subcap imo. They will still be used for dread bombs all the time.
---
Youd have to recatergorize all the guns
---
Anti-cap work is mostly done by supercaps. The dread should fill a midrole
---
go back to your room little tommy
---
the CMS should have just up and left after multiple cases of CCP just blatantly ignoring them and then did their best not to have anyone get elected, or just get elected and never do anything as a protest to CCP, but i guess people love their trips to Iceland...
---
Why not. It seems like CCP wants to change the whole game anyway 😄
---
A titan is dispensible and easy to build as if it is a frigate. Don't be silly, trying to defend the super blobs that are snuffing (no IG pun intended) this game out.
---
lmao it wasnt a simple typoh, you spellt it wrong fam.
---
another wonderful example of a europoor trying to be condescending, while still being fucking stupid
---
When Fozzie introduced the idea of Rorqs to us we thought he was trolling us. The OG version of that ship we saw was somehow even more cripplingly oppressive than what you got.
---
We argued against Cynos in PANIC from Week 1 - Not just me, the majority of the "nullbloc" CSM. We argued against AoE DDs pretty much immediately, as most of us remember playing in the AoE DD era and how fucking shit it was.
---
But, by all means, blame the CSM and not the people who're paid to design this game!
---
Apart from being boring af, highsec Missions yield suck ass as bits are driving the prices of faction store stuff to the ground.
---
If you are highsec bear, or don't want to live under nullsec umbrella, incursions are the best, followed by T5 abyssal sites.

Dear Diary  
---
Today, we beat unspoken because we stayed up for 6 hours till they went to sleep, fucking losers, they should stay up all day to kill stuff.  
---
They keep bluing everyone around them, recently they blued goons and snuff and trigg, i'd cite fleet numbers but it sounds so much more oppressive of them if I just list alliances not realizing HQ's are bullshit in sov warfare, but we're still winning, god I love how well we're doing I could suck each line member off.  
---
I just love how an independent small group like us that's also blue with 2 other alliances can continue to thrive in this unforgiving land.
---
When I am reading your  BR right, I see a slightly different story. 
---
\&gt; Only 8 dead muninns. If you were "volleying" them off the field, that means your entire fleet died in 3 minutes? Sadly BR.inyourspace has done some cert fuckery so I can't load up a nice timeline overview :(.
---
\&gt; Looks like 3/4th of your drakes died to dread(s) and the keepstar. 
---
\&gt; Your loki died to jackdaws GJ flying a 600m loki in a 75m hull doctrine, wondering why they shot you first?
---
\&gt; You came out ISK positive because of that blingy Gila (wtf was it doing lol).
---
So by no means did you "revive" Drakes. You took out Drakes and died in a fire. I hope you had fun though.
---
Why in the world would you have both dread and fax on same character/account? Just train it on a seperate account and SP farm it when it's finished. Way more efficient and not a lot more expensive.
---
Well, recently, CCP has been changing things that only require probably a config file edit, like what ships can use cynos and local being on or off
---
\&gt;whether its founded or not
---
lol. yeah let me spend my free time on a videogame trying to teach people to not be fucking retarded. if someone has a retarded complaint they get a retarded answer for being fucking retarded.
---
ill srp people who suicide gank OP
---
Yup, called it a while ago, 90% of the changes made since the announcement of the PA deal have been for that exact reason - getting a fat cash bonus...
---
Why can’t they just reverse all the transactions made by bots? Money has to go somewhere somehow. Wipe ISK from people that buy from bots. Even if it’s after 6 months. Let it widely be known that if you use Buy ISK at some point it will bite you in the ass. Remember that one time you bought 10bil on the black market one year ago? Yeah, here is -10bil to your wallet. Have fun.
---
I'm a bit dissapointed it wasn't "tackle"
---
If it's already worth doing, we don't need bounties.
---
Please point to where I said get rid of them completely. 
---
Don't worry, I'll wait for you.
---
Jesus, what is this? I'm upvoting goons... what has this game come to...
---
why
---
Pearl abyss should buy PlanetSide
---
Indeed. Unrestricted Injectors were so obviously harmful that I was amazed to see people I thought were sensible. As a mechanic to allow newer players to play catchup, they were just about excusable. If they'd been hardcapped at \~20M SP they'd have been merely questionable. 20M or so SP is *easily* enough for a character with a good T2 ship specialisation, plus a good spread of utlity skills.
---
But when that Ironbank guy (I forget his actual name) bought himself a "Literally all Vs" character in the first week, the writing on the wall was there for all to see.
---
Pearl Abyss should buy PlanetSide
---
That was an intense fight, espicially the 250k damage cyno inhib. I had a alot of fun!
---
Bring in t2 and t3 rookie ships.
---
When the killing starts, it's hard to stop!
---
I was in a major alliance for years. But we used to have to fight to keep our space literally every day, and we won and lost wars. Now with the caps and the "umbrellas" the chance of a major alliance losing is basically zero.     
---
Eve null sec was a lot more fun in the past. Removing local was a good start. But I have a feeling ccp is going to find some ways for the major blocs to actually have a chance of getting unseated.     
---
No offense to the major null alliances. But I come from a time when a POS siege at 3am was call to wake up 4 hours early and fight or you could lose everything. When you have alliances that have held space for a decade, there's something wrong with the risk vs reward system. Obviously controlling a region of null is a massive gain. But right now living in a bloc in null is safer than venturing into a low sec system with a tiny fraction of the gains. Eve was more fun before caps, jump fields, etc were a thing. It used to be a major alliance event just to move things from high sec to null involving dozens of people with scouts and escorts. Now you just jump a few times.    
---
The game grew stagnant. CCP is looking to fix it. All good in my book. Nullsec sov used to change every day before. Alliances conquered others and lost everything all the time. Now the same 3 alliances are basically untouchable for 10 years.. not exactly interesting gameplay.
---
They made a deal with Sony that forced it to be console exclusive.
---
FAX should get sig resolution applied to reps, so you can't repair subcaps for full amount and have to bring logis
---
I am willing to take instanced PVE, catgirls, and whatever PA can stuff into EVE over... This.
---
The changes are just making EVE "EVE, but worse"
---
agreed. no one uses them now anyways legit poointles
---
Something could be said about setting home station in a tiered priority and letting one jumpclone to any station anoikis or not because of the quantum entanglement.
---
ratting dreads are hella popuilar now
---
A trust rating for npsi fleets. Can be attached to a fleet leader
---
You've all been waiting for this, let the memes no longer be just dreams!
---
Nice meme
---
Small sentence means they can afford false-positive. I don't think you understand how hard it can be to prove botting from a dev point of view. This is not usual cheating like in csgo, this is harder. Valve's anticheat usually ban with &lt;0.1% false positive, it's simply not possible here.
---
Small also mean lots of small time botters will simply stop using bots and continue playing.
---
WOT. Answer? After 5 months back to EVE I made so much money to inject supercarrier skills in a 3M SP alt. Bought a carrier, a dread. Thinking of a Titan next. Safe and cool.
---
Design is just quite idiot.
---
The trouble with that is that after a long time that ISK has ended up in all sorts of places. Sold that deadspace mod you pulled from a site on the market in Dodixie to a guy that sold his fitted battleship on contract to a guy who bought isk? You're out 400m ISK even though you did nothing wrong.
---
I have played on and off for almost 10 years. Never been the hardcore player with 20 accounts. Normally one or maybe 2. I have never payed for plex, although i have payed monthly subscriptions through a lot of that time. 
---
Since I started I have want to get into the bigger shinny ships you hear about. And finally within the last year I have gotten Into a Titan on my main, and one for bridging. 
---
I personally find it Strange when a ship that I have worked towards for 8 years, and have invested more than half of my total wealth into is “cheap” and “to easy to get” 
---
Sure there are people that have multiples, and for who they are nothing. But there is a large number of players like me that have been working on getting these things for a long time, and invested a huge amount of our in game wealth Into doing so. i honestly don’t want to hour the hours of my real life time that have gone Into the isk required for that titan.....
---
For those of us that truely see our titans as the investment they are  these talks of remove asset safety, make titans just fleet support, is of course worrying. 
---
I will be really sad if what was for me the goal of many years of playing becomes obsolete because other players think it is unfair they exist.
---
As long as you are F2P you will have this problem. I wonder if CCP included the increased security team costs in their calculations when they decided to open up alphas.
---
So the average at least a year ago was 3-5 accounts per person so if we say 4, then Of the 27000 people online. about 7k player more like the reality .
---
&gt; New players have no at-a-glance idea how to tell if an opposing player is a threat to them and in what way.
---
This made me laugh. This is EVE Online. Every player is a potential threat in so many different ways that an exhaustive list would be hard to come by. It’s EVE Online. ’Threat’ is a concept that has very many different meanings.
---
Zkill needs a "bot" menu selector based off ships lost like this. Then characters are forever a bot from then on.
---
Just give only 1 titan limit for ally per example.. Make it not storable and give to it some love... Maybe make it dockable for sub capital ships.
---
I mean just neg wallet the guy that had first transaction with a confirmed bot. I understand isk is probably funneled through multiple accounts, but it would make sense to have some resources dedicated to investigate the trail. I think more focus should be on fighting the demand too, not just the supply.
---
Evemail me in game, same name. Maybe I can put you in contact with some people.
---
Pretty sure they got pissed a long time ago when players figured out how to beat Concord 100% reliably and decided nah Concord is just straight invinvincible.
---
&gt;. Valve's anticheat usually ban with &lt;0.1% false positive, it's simply not possible here.
---
We have no idea if its possible or not because CCP refuses to even attempt to create or buy any anti-cheat software.
---
pretty fucked up right?
---
I think its more if people who know what they are doing keep getting elected everyone once in a while CCP might listen. But if they just give up and we get a bunch of morons elected who are going to just play the part of yes men every time CCP comes up with a new bad idea it would even worse than it is now.
---
They do and they don't, all the botting rorqs, carriers and supers are paying a sub to be able to fly that ship, its the VNI, Gila and myrm bots that don't have to pay to play.
---
I get it, and youre not the only one, lots of people coming back just like you. But everyone in regular groups is seeing people leave more than join. It could be self selection of returning players to different areas/corps idk. Have you seen many people return/leave in your circles?
---
Why doesn't ccp just IP ban bot regions
---
lol
---
Players with shitty attitudes like yours are the reason that some of our rookies decide to just leave, rather than sticking around and tackling the learning cliff.
---
Botters create in game demand for Plex. And Plex faucet is CCP. At the bottom line CCP does profit from plexed (botting) accounts.
---
That's a real longpost for 'don't nerf my titan reee'.
---
&gt; On one end, the impression that I get from his mention about how Titans were essentially a mistake to be introduced into the game is just downright illogical.
---
That isn't what the quote says. He's saying it is a culmination of mistakes that there are 50 titans in a fleet about to be dropped on someone. He's saying that titans should be strategic assets with a high value, not just another ship type.
---
&gt; Hilmar's next comment is regarding his impression that Titans are permanently stored in perfect safety without any associated risks and costs.
---
Yes we all know how asset safety works but 0.5% is not a meaningful cost. You can even deploy your titan to a temporary structure in hostile space and retrieve it from lowsec for a 15% transfer fee!
---
&gt; Even CCP ironically portrays the awe of large ships
---
There's only awe if they are uncommon.
---
Also, 4 paragraphs is not a tl;dr
---
Hey man, thanks for the feedback - this is a really great thread.
---
Hopefully you'll find your feet in EVE - I'll pass this one on to our dev team for them to look over. Some great feedback.
---
To start with pvp you need to be oriented by a vet. Otherwise it will be too hard. 
---
You are not bad, eve pvp is very difficult, and maybe that's the cuase we love it.
---
You need to learn a lot of things, ships, tipical fits, situations to avoid....
---
I always recommend ( in FW space ) , to start with kiting fits, tristan, condors, breachers....
---
Kiter allows you understand the mechanics and the tipical fits without being the punchball of the system.
---
Eventually you'll win a combat, got the addrenaline rush, the shake, and dude you'll be hooked for years.
---
Well yeah I assumed you still had someone in the hole
---
Carriers are pure shit, light fighters need a tracking buff
---
How mature of you op.
---
I have 4 accounts, all are PvP  
---
Main does most of the work, the other 3 are pretty lazy to be honest.
---
&gt; CCP CEO Hilmar has shown us a stunning lack of insight 
---
But he is right and it look like CCP finally have courage to purge carebear space. 
---
If all those changes are so terrible for you, why don't you move to highsec?
---
Light drones do more dps than light fighters, its a fucking travesty
---
As one gets older and have more disposable income the number of accounts dwindles (until an interesting war occurs) due to ever less disposable time.  Am eagerly awaiting early retirement so that I too can have time to properly utilize ten accounts.
---
God pls no mainenance cost, that sound like the opposite of fun
---
Wow that's a whole new level for nullblob crying. "Waaah I can't farm with zero risk any more in an online game so literally fire someone from his job"
---
I can buy a rigged Titan for 41.5b just about any day of the week.
---
I like how hard you're trying :)

CCP Hilmar is right, fuck off OP
---
Petition to delete op (ingame)
---
No mans sky is fixed kinda
---
&gt; The recent changes have literally made wh space "risk free krabbing"
---
The recent changes did not affect WH space at all
---
&gt; which null never had
---
Local makes nullsec ratting as close to zero risk as it's possible to imagine in a PVP game.
---
&gt; in HS i earn more isk with less risk than null
---
There are some ISK fountains in HS that are too high, particularly high level abyssals. Incursions are a limited fountain you have to compete for.
---
&gt; I can lock down a wh for 4 hours at a time, and make an average of 1.5 bill an hour. Both of these activities are NO RISK
---
No you can't, almost no wormholes have enough sites to allow you to run for 4 hours. And there is always risk, someone can always roll into you. I know what you'll say, "you can just watch the probe scanner" - which is almost a valid point, but even that provides less safety than local did. And the static can get opened by something cloaky in the hole if you aren't paying attention for a minute while they scan it.
---
I would say that losing a titan could result in a ban on flying a Titan again for 30 days for that pilot. Possibly circumvented with a rare and expensive implant that is lost upon losing the titan as well.  
---
And/or a maximum limit on titans per corp/alliance/bluelist  
---
And/or introduce a resource requirement that is rare as well as region-limited, and you need multiple of those rare resources to construct titans.
---
This way you can limit titans being fielded, introduce more vectors of conflict. Especially if titans are limited based on blue-listed groups. This way it becomes a risk to add more people to your coalition, and you'd rather want to be as small as possible to maximize the amount of titans per player, so to speak.
---
But at the same time, introduce more region-limited resources, thus requiring you to have friendly relations (which generally results in more blues), or go to war to obtain those resources.
---
Looks like member of ELITE PVPers group.
---
found the new guy
---
That would also be pretty cool.
---
There should be some way to improve upon that.
---
&gt;. I don't think you understand how hard it can be to prove botting from a dev point of view. This is not usual cheating like in csgo, this is harder
---
I still don't think you understand what botting mean. It can definitely not modify the game client in any way and still be efficient. Botting is NOT a aimbot, a wallhack or whatever. Bots do NOT do anything a player can't do. The Eve server never trust the client and is thus pretty secure.
---
To put it simply : Botting will not be countered by usual anti-cheat softwares. Because they are not cheating. Very bad bots can be caught, that's all you can do.
---
Stage 4 Of Cyno change grief?
---
during the same period sony also released planetside...which was similar.
---
That was no longer true when I started playing in 2007. It took me three months of running escalations to grind up my first Titan back in 2012. The place we are in today was always inevitable, skill injectors just accelerated it.
---
&gt;Maybe consider the poor retention rate is due to the fact that your game isn’t for everyone and maybe you should just focus on well-rounded balance across the game and make eve playable for people who will actually sub for years on end.
---
You mean the player old enough to farm isk in the most optimized way possible and thus don't need to spend real $ to play at all?
---
Also, I can't believe you think you're outsmarted their player retention departement in two sentences. They have a little bit more information on the subject than you.
---
If only we could get them to bash the fuckin citadels in FW space. Put them to work on something useful. At least rats would have the patience for a week long timer that comes out at 4:40 in the morning.
---
A YouTuber named "Lasker Emanuel" used to fly around in dreads looking for small gangs to fight in his dreads and he wasn't usually dropped on. He'd rack up kills and usually get away. So I think your statement is pretty accurate. HAW guns really ruin subcap fun roams.

or you know, you could either destroy a citadel and hope for 50/50 loot, or try to capture it with elite dust bunnies and get full citadel loot.

Almost no harm but its still mutilation. If it's illegal to mutilate a child's vagina it should be illegal to mutilate a child's dick

---
This is true to some extent.
---
But an operating cost dissuades titan caching, and building ships that you don't need at the moment. That will target large blocs more than small ones who only have one or two big ships.
---
Hi chaun
---
Many of the problems have been solved by the players in ways not always available to new players.
---
Travel times? Older players have DST alts that can bring 40 frigate in one trip, or are rich enough to pay more to get everything delivered by someone else.
---
Not knowing the opponent? This is solved by external tools. You can get previous fits on zkill, put that into pyfa, see how you do against it etc. On that point though, I thing they fucked up. A ship is already very unpredictable thanks to the really fun module system, you can customize a ship in many ways. And then you can have boosters, okay why not. And then you can have implants that can boost up to 30-40% a stat of your ship, making your ship a counter to others just because you have those implants, uhh not really okay. And later one they then added mutaplasmid, now you really have no idea what you're fighting against.

but you realize that those things he complains about, if changed, would result in what i'm saying: changing the game experience for all, for the worst. 
---
for me, at least, the overwhelming complexity made me just give up and try to join a corp that would teach me. If those systems were more "forgiving" I wouldve probably ran "hisec pve fleets through the fleet finder" until I quit in a few months' time if anything. 
---
The npe should be about connecting the player to the more advanced members of the community, not put them all in a bucket and stir - probably like a better version of the isd, less like 'explaining gate guns better" or "making conflict more visible in thr system" whatever that even means. 
---
truth is, eve is made out of complex systems that in turn generates a harsher ux. Interface friction in this case IS a player performance check. Knowledge scarcity is what makes the game great - it gives gameplay in figuring out rats damage types etc, like this other gimp complained about in the thread. I fail to see how you fail to see that exposing more of the core mechanics would make it worse not better. 
---
let's hope the guy actually gets in a corp that would teach him, instead of a ns bloc that would cater to his lazyness and need for safety.
---
Said by someone who doesn’t understand how the CSM works.
---
not sure what you mean tbh :D
---
Well titans were bufed, HAWs, Bosons, etc are just rediculous - especially since CCP specifically removed AOE doomsdays before since it was just silly to have a fleet wiped just for warping to a gate.
---
Except this things have nothing to do with time as building capitals became basically free comparing to aoe dd times.
---
Exactly.
---
How do they create demand for Plex if they are all alfa virtual machines?

Check out Abyssals.

Dromis and Sirens need to be removed, whole point of caps was always thst they required sub cap support, yet these fighters allow Supers to tackle and kill things without any support at all.

---
Currently 38 accounts subbed

Some sub cap pilots some titan pilots some ganking pilots and a few miners and industry pilots :)
---
And they didn't manage to fix this in the following 10+ years? The cap rebalance and rorq are only 3 years old. Fozzie and his ilk are directly responsible for this, not local or cynos or whatever.
---
 I think it’s time for Hilmar to quit as CCP CEO
---
I just started again 4 days ago after 1.5yrs off. I live in GalMil FW, you should come give it a try. It's def not what it used to be (dominance of GalMil), but there are still willing pilots and lots of targets. 
---
Low sec life is tough and rewarding. Let me know if you're interested and we can play together
---
As often it depends of what you use them for. 
---
First of all some t2 mods are more than 5% efficiency over meta4 especially tank. 
---
Then some offensive mods have spec skills which allow you to push the dps 25% higher than meta. Plus they use special ammo that can lead to better range or less cap usage.
---
Id say generally not fitting t2 is going too cheap. Those 10% bonuses add up especially in solo pvp to give you the advantage you need over others.
---
They need to start punishing the alliance that allow it in there space for fuck sake
---
So I will ban you because my detection program told me only bots can be this stupid.
---
I guess that's one way to win at Eve.
---
Solution for RMT is simple. CCP have to became the best seller to drive the competition out. And yes I mean they have to sell on black market too.

Show her Star Citizen!!

It'll be released when she's old enough to play it!

Well played.

Dont fly what you cant afford to lose, even if you think you will never lose it because its an OP ship that almost never dies because one day CCP might just nerf it out of existence. I hope they do.

did you ever load that ancil with paste?

New titan pilot mad he made a bad isk investment.

You linked my ikitursa personally. Wow thank you.

Right now put in an anti-cheat software would make the MacOS version unworkable (officially supported), and all the Linux players  too (no supported and very few, I am one of them). There is still developing going on in WINE to support EAC and Battleye windows versions, but I don't know if this software is prepared for the kind of cheating happening here, also not one stops 100% of cheaters (you could see CSGO cheating almost on a daily basis in casual matches). Maybe they should create an in house botting detector (but as it was said here that should be complicated to develop).
---
[https://i.imgur.com/xw8UFU4.png](https://i.imgur.com/xw8UFU4.png) There is a fit for those. No booster, implants or black hole effect. No need to lock the targets because the missiles automatically fly towards them.

CCP have a history of no fixing their fek ups.  A long long history.
---
screw the Fedos
---
Just started, doing the career missions, but I'm curious what ships I should be working towards with the following parameters in mind.  I would like to stay solo(no corp) for awhile till I learn the rooes, with that said I'll be grinding missions, mining, scanning predominantly.  With that said, I'd like to be able to hold my own eventually while I'm out on these adventures, so decent PvP capabilities is also a requirement.  I was trying to read some guides, and it seems like the drake is a mainstay in most people's fleets?  Is that something I should work towards?
---
What people should (but won't be) be getting from this is that r/eve is a really poor representation of the average eve player.
---
"new"
---
oh, your "we don't backstab" comment called to mind the black wedding (snuff's awoxing of a few sc supers and a titan 3-4 years ago)
---
And to think the L4s I enjoy so much 'are boring as hell' and 'suck ass'. Why, how did I never realize this?
---
you're either new or salty af, or both lol
---
There are some good points here.
---
I don't agree about removing overview or standardised UI, the ability to set those up for different purposes and playstyles is good. But the default overview is bad and CCP should consult on how to improve it. Personally I'd work with E-Uni and take most of their overview settings as the default - Z-S is great for some people but I think it's a bit confusing.
---
Being able to tell how strong another ship is would be a big help. Enyo and Merlin both show as 'frigate' on the overview and in brackets, but they're completely different in terms of engagement profile and strength. A T3C, or HIC, is a completely different type of ship with different abilities, yet they both show as the same as a Thorax. Until you know all the ship names you have no idea what is what. The overview and bracket indicator for a ship should have some kind of flash or overlay that shows what role and tech level it is.
---
&gt; Maybe you should be able to get back into a ship you have fitted elsewhere warped into the same system where you died
---
I don't like the idea of teleporting a ship you have elsewhere into the system. That can easily be abused to remove the risks associated with travel. But I do think it should be easier to move fitted hulls around, and you should be able to choose to stay in the same system if you get podded (though I guess you'd have to exempt J space from that which would seem arbitrary).
---
&gt; Safe Havens outside of Corps
---
NPC stations? You have those in all of empire space, and in NPC nullsec. I think it's fine that you don't have that in all space - sovereignty should mean something.
---
&gt; Gate Guns
---
Yeah they're terrible. I don't really understand what their purpose is. If it's to protect people from gate camps then they need to actually achieve that: (i) pre-emptively engage flashies, (ii) re-engage people that warp off and (iii) project tackle on aggressors. If they're not supposed to protect you from gate camps then just remove them because they have no purpose at the moment except to meme people who don't know the mechanics.
---
Battleships were meant to be used for mining. 
---
I mined my first battleship in a thorax and recall the belts at the time was the abode of the mining Apoc.
---
There were no specialised mining ships other than frigates if I remember correctly, you fit miners to the ship with the most turrets.
---
bug id ID EBR-181405 if that helps
---
what are you smoking? can i have some of that?
---
Ccp going to “fix it” by removing local
---
If you look at other classic syfys like battletech or 40k they both have themes of extreme technological regression.  Before this era of chaos the null empires have enjoyed a golden era of growth and expansion. Battletech in particular would be a great inspiration for eves future. What eve needs is its own succession war. Give the blocks the ability to properly wage war on one another and salt the earth behind them. Id like to see titans become relics of a lost era and the general powecreep we have suffered under for the last years pulled back. T2 modules becoming something like lostech would be pretty badass as well.
---
"chaos" for everyone :-)

&gt; I would also like to have a tool to somehow verify someone has a microphone

Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!
---
Is newbies' safety not set to green by default? It really should be.
---
CCP gets bonus $$$ if they hit certain targets - or something along those lines.
---
The suspicion follows that all this "chaos" and SP events and such, is intended to fudge the numbers.
---
I have 5 accounts and I never log in, it's the only way to win the game.
---
I love how people scream THIS GAME IS A SPACESHIP SIMULATOR YOU \*ARE\* A SPACESHIP even though planetary/station exploration is one of the biggest hype concepts possible.
---
RIP Dust
---
blackout stoped botting guys.. go back to what you were doing .
---
Is that true, can someone confirm this? Because if that's the case then holy shit **why**
---
Check if you still have SPs. There is a risk they have been extracted.
---
To create more "chaos" you can now roll Chat like Wormholes by writing enough lines of text. Once you do the chat changes to a different system.
---
CCP just needs to introduce exclusive mounts for subbing for half a year, once every six months
---
Working as intended! Enjoy the chaos! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
---
Guess i'm following your example.
---
It's almost as if there should be game mechanics that prevent that kind of asset accumulation, such as:
---
 - no alts
---
 - inability to log out in space and thus forcing to create staging areas for ships
---
 - stack penalized logi so that battles aren't as one-sided
---
 - a reason to actually risk titans by making them more than just jump portal generators
---

I won't pretend I know how exactly do cheaters 'pay', if they ever do. Bottom line is - your bot pays out its sub in say 10 days. The rest is all profit and goes to the Chinese's pocket in the form or RMT after they sell it to someone. Or in their allaince's warchest.
---
That's a very long shitpost that boils down to "Reeeeeeee leave my Titan alone"
---
Fun and engaging gameplay!
---
It’s fairly safe to say that on some level ccp considers learning game mechanics and skills like scanning for yourself to be “engaging gameplay”, but yeah no explanation for the UI is pretty bad.
---
Didn't even care to read all. But when you think having fleets of hundreds of titans isn't a problem where the only counter is having even more that stagnates the game then probably you lack the insight.
---
Sorry for the ambiguity, with regular groups i refer to normal nullsec entities who krab, hold space, and pew.
---
The others would be hunters / roamers / etc
---
Haha, no worries. I interpreted it in a completely different direction.
---
No this is wow
---
I'm suddenly tempted to buy some skins for ships. Even ones I don't fly.
---
Oh dang I gotta login and change up my money machines this wknd actually! Thx for reminder.
---
Hilmar said it was their fault, so I'm not sure what you want by pointing out that it was their fault. But there aren't a ton of titans and supers now because the game is old. There were relatively few titans and supers a few years ago. Rorquals, citadels, and injectors made them much more common. 
---
Maybe Hilmar is being generous and a bit obtuse and means that titan proliferation is an outcome of wrongheaded CCP policies. Maybe he means he likes things like injectors and citadels and not titans and supers. Maybe he means that titans and supers are incompatible with the current state of the game. But "Eve is old" really misses that these changes have accelerated in the past few years.

Planetary Flight was a concept in 2004. Sadly scrapped.

---
What butt ton of garbage.
---
lot of salty folk in here, HOBOY
---
why only ingame?!
---
They still weren't commonplace. They were just concentrated in two alliances.
---
It's cheaper (~0.6) to buy enough plex from rtm than to buy 30 days from ccp + in some countries (like Russia) plex from ccp cost  twice the amount of 30 days.
---
They became complacent, lazy, and entitled.
---
Is there anything new about mudflation?  When Titans were introduced, a large alliance was lucky to have one, turned into a few, turned into dozens, hundreds, what we have today.  It's completely predictable for anyone who understands MMOs at all.  Give players the biggest baddest thing to grind for, and they're going to grind.  That's what pays the bills for the MMO company, but it also leads, inevitably, to lots and lots of the biggest, baddest thing.
---
If CCP wanted to make and keep Titans as rarely seen awe inspiring doomsday weapons that can both turn the tide in a battle and crush the morale of an entire alliance if they are lost, they could have.  They just didn't.
---
It's pretty simple.  Make them require an extremely rare drop to build.  Some Jovian thing that any random NPC might be carrying in its cargo, so that specific content can't be guarded and farmed.  One that can, rarely, be salvaged if a Titan is killed, but otherwise might only drop a few times a year.  
---
Titans were cool when the location of the yards that built them was a closely guarded secret.  They were cool when seeing one on the field was an experience.  They were cool when losing one really was newsworthy.  CCP could have kept it that way.  They just didn't.  It's probably too late for Titans.  Titan killers, anyone?
---
Last time I didn't add this, I was banned for 24h
---
Obviously.
---
Sounds like a toxic relationship.
---
There's no normal progression on an alt.
---
Yes because false positives never happen
---
What do you mean by shortcuts?  If you are talking about EVE shortcuts, they are automatically copied over when you do the "Account Copy"
---
I’ll sign it if you provide proof of biomass.
---
Obviously, that's why we dropped 12k active people a day, All the bots quit.
---
Those are not-obvious use of autopilot, that's cool.
---
Only Matari ones
---
I love the salty armchair CEOs that have probably never developed anything or run a business in their life. Get comfortable in-game and cry about unspecific ideas of inevitable and needed changes and balances. 
---
WoW classic is coming, go play that and delete your account on the way out.
---
you're using a lore argument, OP is talking about gameplay, balance.
---
Citadels have maintenance cost.
---
You deal with that on case by case basis. There is a rule, and there is an exception.
---
Ban should be the rule, but ccp could decide not to enforce it, if it's unclear, if it was a person or a bot.
---
Mp
---
l
---
Depends! In solo semi-mirror fights, a T1 fit frigate will get eaten. In small gang stuff, you can get away with it as you'll outnumber the enemy sometimes.
---
Capitals like dreads? You lose tons of dps have T1, but it can be worth it.
---
Also consider place like wormholes where you don't really want to lose and every ship count. People there don't even use T2, they commonly use deadspace stuff.
---
People need to talk to other pilots more. From talking to some of the guys in capf the panic module  provides so much needed challenge for fc's, some thing that they enjoy.
---
Rorquls can be balanced if they are op, but don't remove why they are fun to hunt. Carriers are currently a free kill, get a lock on it and it is dead for all intent and purpose. Only rorquls and titans are challenging to kill once you get on grid.
---
Rorquls you have to hold grid for 5/6 mins and use FC skills to dodge the umbrella, get back in and get the kill before bailing.
---
Remember this changes are completely pointless if the guys killing this thing are unchallenged and get bored of the game.
---
And any rule which allows arbitrary exceptions is an entry for corruption .
---
It's never clear when you do detection. It's based on inference, which IS always wrong. False positive and false negative are not 0%.
---
I am only recently back to the game after being gone 13 years, don't have access to the old accounts.   
---
So I have 3 accounts from day 1 that I returned.   
---
Account 1 = Exploration character, cov ops stuff, wormhole and scanning stuff
---
Account 2 = Missions at the moment, but just leveling up your typical shit.   
---
Account 3 = Faction Warfare / frigate pvp shit.
---
No, but people that drop them on any lone cruiser that comes across are a big reason why their proliferation is perceived as such a massive problem. Something like that was never intended to be their use and CCP never imagined that would be possible at some point.
---
Each one of those covetors, without boosts, will mine 11 billion in a month if they mine 23 hours a day. That is just mining spoud. That is a serious problem.
---
I have 6 characters but only 2 accounts.  
---
3 pi characters on one account, only 1 has combat skills tho, other two are full passive income, research, invention, reactions. anything that can make is while not online.  
---
Other account is the same, but only focuses on subcap instead of capital.
---
I heard he is a simple miner with a simple plan. He's quite edgy, he believe you shouldn't compress your ore.
---
That's a good idea! 
---
Though I'm going for skins of ships I can fly.
---
I've seen the other topic where the guy c/p'ed the some goons posts. He is either GSF troll/propaganda account or just stiupid and acting as their tool to spread their word.
---
No, OP is talking about ships gathering dust and rusting over time if not used often enough. Because everyone seems to think the way to fix Capital proliferation is to assign fees so they're prohibitively expensive to maintain.
---
But as I said, we use nanite magic already to fix grievous battle damage in seconds. So any amount of wear and tear could be mended instantly. And our ships have crew members besides us Capsuleers, and they maintain the ships while we're away.
---
There's no justification for maintenance fees other than "if we make them too expensive then people won't play with them". Which was true about 15 years ago. Back when they were mythical and legendary. When there were only like 10 Titans in existence. And when a month of game time was worth about 100 mil. But these days, inflation has grown due to ISK faucets, botting, and cash for PLEX, and now everyone has a Capital. So adding an extra fee won't hurt anyone except the noobs who try and build a small ship collection starting out, who can't afford their fees.
---
You can't escape the risk of arbitrary ruling, so it's a non-issue here. You have it now as well. So if you are not convinced someone is guilty leave him be, but if you are, than perma ban him. 3-day-ban solves nothing.
---
HS mining bots are a problem, sure (and unaffected by blackout). But much less of one than NS VNI bots.
---
3 things: 
---
1: nice kill, well done    
---
2: why are you running eve w/ unlocked fps?   
---
3: is that a filter you have on your video? it looks like it has too much contrast
---
It won't be popular but I reckon the next chaos changes will be:
---
1. Asset safety revisited, maybe made more expensive or only partial
---
2. Cap and supercap EHP nerf to bring them more into line with progression steps of lower classes 
---
3. Supercap maintenance costs added
---
&gt; Also, 50 SP farming accounts
---
CCPls this surely isn't what you intended when you brought in injectors
---
You are not "convinced". You use automated checks to find out who is botting or not. If you let people decide on a case by case basis, first it costs too much time, secondly that person WILL become corrupted.
---
You always have the risk of arbitrary ruling, just like you always have a risk of accident in a car. Not a reason to increase that risk.
---
So no, using a "prove you are not bot" on first offense is the best way to reduce corruption and avoid excessive punishment on false positive, while reducing the cost of human checks to the least .
---
3 accounts (one on steam), 9 toons
---
used to run a 5 toon sp farm but stopped when it was not working.
---
now i run the 3 main on the accounts, main has everything maybe 1-1,5 year till all subcap/some cap skills are at 4/5 levels. i keep him pure by not injecting/extracting sp from him
---
other 2 toons are basically orca+abaddon i use for corp pvp and structure bash
---
Main character, a couple of trade hub station traders, one in FW and a number of basic 5 mil SP alpha characters for seeding wormholes or using on fleets when my main is busy.
---
well we don't want that to happen, at all it's just a game and the op may never played that game in the beginning, and just being a reddit-troll.
---
To be more specific about that since there's a lot of nullsec crying at the moment: Local chat acts like J space in null now. The actual PVE has hardly changed, particularly if you were in NPC null, but you can no longer immediately see when someone else comes into system.
---
Very little amount of people actually farmed for something like keepstar as it's pretty pointless and waaay less have built something resembling an empire as it's not a thing f1 monkey is capable of.
---
Get No Man's Sky, I've heard that that game has more players than Eve nowadays.
---
Titans and supers killed so much other game content at this point that they simply killed the game, and yes everything about them is wrong, they are fun for few FCs, but not for the majority of "drones" that fly them, these are hard facts tbf
---
You mean broker fees? And also fuck your idea of ccp stepping into the sandbox.
---
5 accounts.
---
1 main + 1 Jita alt + 1 joke char
---
1 Titan/Dread alt + 1 JF alt 
---
#1 FAX/Dread alt + #1 ganker alt 
---
#2 FAX/Dread alt + 1 market alt + #2 ganker alt
---
1 Ghost alt + #1 cyno alt + #2 cyno alt.
---
You think now the decision on banning is solely done by machine and that actual person is not involved in the process and cannot overrule it? Also you seem to think that the function of temporary ban is to mitigate the risk of banning innocent player, is that correct? 
---
My point is that you need to have sufficient amount of evidence to ban someone, until you have it, don't do anything, but if you do, don't be soft.
---
Lastly, how do you think criminal procedure works? Using your assertions, one could say, all our judges are corrupt.
---
:context: I never want to own a Titan.
---
The issue for me is that owning a Titan at all is seen as being in the natural progression of players.
---
let us equate a null sec alliance to say Apple. Tim Cook can afford a private jet And so can Apple. But if Apple buy the jet TC is the most likely user of it but it is available for the whole company. Other execs use it sometimes 30 devs go for training training I don’t know but it is to the betterment of the company not just one person. I guess this is the not I am trying to make. Individuals should have no need to own one. Just like an individual should not own a city. A Titan is a moving city. Millions of people.
---
A Titan should need a group of people to build run and maintain.
---
The power and force projection should be to the benefit of many so it should cost and take the many to maintain it.
---
Highsec blackout
---
No it is not.
---
Nice Roleplay stuff.
---
Ahhh thanks! Now I'm down to 148% over CPU
---
Before it was 2.25+1.  Now it's 3.5 base taxes.
---
Thank you I appreciate the feedback!
---
Regarding your questions: I do not see any reason to lock the FPS in Eve.
---
Also I agree with you on the contrast. It looked way better on the source file, than uploaded on youtube. Contrast is too high and some colors even look funky. That is something I will have an eye on in the future and surely will try different settings.
---
\o/
---
afaik that was the case in the past but since the flood of bots they changed it to permanent
---
Chat has been broken since the blackout
---
&gt; I do not see any reason to lock the FPS in Eve.
---
it would reduce temperatures in your system    
---
(and room, going from 100% gpu at all time to like 30 or 40% is in some cases up to 200w difference wich is a small space heaters worth)    
---
make framedrops from 280 to 80 a thing of the past (less jarring when you enter grid)     
---
and make your pc a little happier by not having parts pegged at 100%
---
Good Job CCP. Another 'chaos'?
---
&gt; You think now the decision on banning is solely done by machine and that actual person is not involved in the process and cannot overrule it?
---
https://www.eveonline.com/fr/article/pwp24p/monthly-security-report-july-2019
---
777 bans related to bot. on one month. That's 777/20 = 38 bans per day. So yes it is automated.
---
&gt; Also you seem to think that the function of temporary ban is 
---
Not "the function" , but one of the reason it's this way. Don't try to oversimplify things.
---
&gt;My point is that you need to have sufficient amount of evidence to ban someone, until you have it, don't do anything, but if you do, don't be soft.
---
And sometimes you have enough but you are wrong (AKA false positive). That's exactly what I was saying before, including the part where I affirm I should ban you.
---
https://litigation.findlaw.com/legal-system/what-is-a-judges-role-in-court.html
---
Judges are not the one who actually decide of someone being culprit.
---
The other issue with it is this:
---
1) bot
---
2) get caught, wallet is penalized
---
3) open up a trade window with your alt
---
4) accept extractors, use them, trade back your injectors 
---
5) biomass the negative wallet character 
---
6) bot more
---
I accept skill points in the form of redeemable items.
---
me too, gj CCP
---
&gt; But as I said, we use nanite magic already to fix grievous battle damage in seconds. So any amount of wear and tear could be mended instantly. And our ships have crew members besides us Capsuleers, and they maintain the ships while we're away.
---
That's a lore argument
---
&gt;There's no justification for maintenance fees other than "if we make them too expensive then people won't play with them". Which was true about 15 years ago.
---
Now you're talking about gameplay and such.
---
You can't defend yourself with "but it's contradictory from a lore point of view" and then talk about inflation and botting, cash from plex which has nothing to do with lore.
---
I'm just pointing it out, confusing lore and mechanics won't help anyone. And lore often has no say in mechanics, "lore finds a way".
---
Jita seemed screwed, other systems seem ok
---
All channels just disappeared besides local, corp and alliance tabs.
---
F
---
Chat is borked again yeh. Lost all my channels too but thats okay i didnt really want to talk to other people in a massive multiplayer game :p
---
The opposite side of jump drives is lack of mobility in combat and shift towards dps/tank race instead of tactics. Overall gameplay got dumber almost as much as isk has devalued.
---
yeah, everything is gone. #literally\_unplayable
---
nope, this is from W-space. shits fucked up here as well
---
It was, but now all crash
---
Hilmtard is the example of an error that just won't go away.
---
But it’s that whole “catch up” argument right? Like when people throw out the idea of just making them harder to attain whether it’s by increased building materials or whatever, it doesn’t automatically take away these giant caches of titans the large groups already have. It just makes it harder for up and coming groups, that don’t already have large caches of titans, to catch up to the big groups that already have the infrastructure and economy to maintain that.
---
fun fact, back in the day ships would trail smoke and flames when they got damaged, making it extra cool
---
It gets even better: Local is showing for some users in Wormholes.  
---
CCPlease
---
Yeah, I thought I was slowly getting kicked from channels, since I feel like I asked a stupid question in one .. haha.
---
&gt; I'm just pointing it out, confusing lore and mechanics won't help anyone. And lore often has no say in mechanics, "lore finds a way".
---
That's my point. If they tried to add fees, they'd have to back it up somehow. And there is no way to back it up, other than just outright saying it's a fee for no reason. They would have to say that ships cause pollution or something, and that's why they have fees. If they try and use the maintenance argument like OP (and so many others) have suggested, it's going to get shot down by their own established setting.
---
Which would actually be a good first step if they were committed to hard,  meaningful changes.  But in pure CCP fashion, Hilmtard is totally clueless and just throwing bandaid-wrapped balls of shit at the wall and hoping some sticks.
---
yup attack another’s play style save your own right

Also apparently local was fully removed from highsec.

IP bans aren't really practical.  They're both easily bypassed via VPN, and have huge potential for collateral damage.  People whose ISPs use carrier-grade NAT will share public IPs, people in college dorms will typically share public IPs, etc.

Finally

Don't worry, it works great so they have no reason to roll it back.   Hilmtard says so.

I guess asking CCP to fix their fuckups is too much. GJ CCP. cHaOs Era working as intended.

\~80+ Characters. Mostly Crabbing and pi.

Dunno why anybody would actually welcome that.

Just makes it easier for those inclined to be carebears in WH to adopt the NS strategy of "See a stranger? Dock and afk!"

CCP is like Texas Sheriff, Shoot first, ask later.
---
I'm new to the game but why does it focus the chat text box when you minimize or close another window? half the time my keyboard shortcuts just don't work because of this. Is there a way to stop it?
---
Well if they remove titans and supers I'll just "win" Eve and go play a better game, like Fallout 76.
---
&gt; EVE is a hard game. 
---
It really isn't.  The hardest thing is finding something to do that is interesting.   All the actual activities in Eve are pretty fing simple.
---
Was this shit coded 15 years ago by interns or something?
---
How the fuck is it always broken?
---
Investment vs upkeep are very different things. I can only again say please don't play stupid.
---
30 and might have to get another 10 becauses no one  want to come ganking with me and I have to do it solo hence needing 30 accounts.
---
Unless it's an alpha account, botters pay CCP. PLEX is never free. They themselves may not have paid the money for PLEX but that money has already made their way to CCP. And it costs more money for PLEX than it does for a subscription may I remind you.
---
Oh, thats all? Im sure they could dedicate a dev's free time to it and we'll see it soon.
---
Keep repeating this and maybe it will be true.
---
Not a freighter in img.
---
Triglavian gank + afk mining + freighter lol
---
If you don't let the module fully decycle it has for as long as i remembered reloaded the previous charge. No idea why it does that but it gets me regularly in my legion.
---
I think it would be cool to combine the effects.
---
Awww, poor Waffles pilot can't afford a titan. Boohoo.
---
It's a good thing they went back to the drawing board on Nova when they did. It would be seriously disappointing for them to fuck up DUST for such an obvious stupid decision, then fuck up Nova for such an obvious stupid decision.
---
I never had the best grades in maths, but it seems yo be something completely foreign to you.

They should change the nature of PvE while they're at it. Drastically reduce the ISK of all day farmable activities. Move PvE closer towards activities like short but large cash injections. Like moons for example, only way to get them sooner is decrease the cycle time or get more moons. You can still run a bot on it but you can't do it 24/7 which reduced the gap between what a player can do and what a bot can do. I'd like anoms to remain in a form that you can farm but most of the income, comes from running the escalations. Activities like Abyssals and rolling holes for Sleeper sites aren't something you can easily bot. Bots are here to stay I think that needs to be accepted. Instead of hopelessly removing them ourselves, activities need to be shifted towards mechanics that highly discourage it and reduce it's efficiency with minimal effect to the primary playerbase.
---
Hey, even mIRC had a bad day.  Oh wait it never did...
---
i can afford a dozen titans and sold my last one yesterday
---
please fuck off retard
---
not technically the freighter class ship, but it does function as a freighter by definition
---
They didn't quit they moved. And now they're starting to adapt to null sec again. We weren't short 12k players before botting became rampant.
---
Working as intended.
---
I was being sarcastic
---
Another game having an even shittier npe doesn't make this one's any less shitty

But should only be able to be watched from inside of a marauder, in bastion, on a gate, while assets are ejected from the citadel you live in. But during commercial breaks add a hacking minigame where you can unlock viewing from twitch as long as you can gate a super through 30 low sec jumps

AT is shit.
---
Everything you need to know about fitting a bomber (and plenty you don’t): http://media.karasutengu.co.uk/EVE/TorpedoDelivery.pdf
---
They need to put less resources into removing bots. Banning them never actually thins their numbers. They need to change PvE at its core. Time restricted restricted resource gathering means you can make a lot of money in a short period of time. Doesn't stop botting but brings the total weekly work load closer to what a real player can achieve. Take moon mining for example. Having more bots can't make you more money. Only way to do that is to have more moons.
---
Summer without AT has actually been nice.
---
No, maintenance costs are different because you don't pay them when you don't have the asset.
---
OK daughter: Launching Warframe!
---
Whether intended or not, it was probably welcomed.  I am not an injector fan, but every SP account, even if it is subbed with PLEX (which, no, is not a $ generator for CCP) generates $ because extractors are needed.
---
777 bot related bans in July, that's 388,500 PLEX no longer being consumed by them or $15K in PLEX revenue no longer being realized for CCP. 
---
That's supply that now can sit on the market that much longer and bring the price of PLEX down due to competition.
---
&gt;777 bans related to bot. on one month. That's 777/20 = 38 bans per day. So yes it is automated.
---
I didn't say it's not part automated, I'm saying you have a person inside of this system. Most likely the person decides on appeals, but it could also decide before ban is given. Anyhow you have this element no matter what. I said it's a non-issue because you have it currently, and you would have it if you lost temporary ban for botting.
---
&gt;Not "the function" , but one of the reason it's this way. Don't try to oversimplify things.
---
I'm not oversimplifying, my point is that botting should not fall under any kind of temporary ban, because the function of temp. ban is to make a player comply with the rules, and you won't achieve that with bots. 
---
&gt;And sometimes you have enough but you are wrong (AKA false positive).
---
How is this different now? 
---
&gt;Judges are not the one who actually decide of someone being culprit.
---
That's true only for Anglo-saxon legal system. In Continental legal systems judge(s) decide on whether a person is guilty, as well as punishment. 
---
To summarize; all I'm saying is that we should lose the temporary ban, and have a person make final judgement on the issue, not the machine. If there is not enough evidence nothing happens, but the "file" stays open. If the ban is issued, player can appeal, and someone other that the person who made the initial judgement, takes the "case" and gives final verdict.
---
If it works for legal systems it can work for Eve too! And I don't think it requires too much resources.
---
&gt; it would make sense to have some resources dedicated to investigate the trail
---
This is the reason that's harped for why it takes so long to ban bots.
---
Banning them doesn't actually resolve anything. I think they need to realise this can't be the solution. Rework the whole PvE system. Use moon mining as a rough example. The advantage to a bot is that it can work for far longer than a real player can. If it can only bot 'x' hours a week and that number of hours is closer to what a real human would realistically achieve. Then you've drastically reduced that advantage that a bot has over real players. More botters would not increase your income unless you can get more moons. Moons are finite, take time to cycle and there aren't enough of them to go around to share between half the population of China. 
---
This won't remove botting, but it begins to level the playing field. CCP can look to other activities they already have for inspiration. What activities do botters not do? Hole rolling for Sleeper sites? Abyssal sites? Make botting less practical or necessary the botters may even remove themselves. If not then at least we can reduce the impact they have on our economy.
---
You can play another game.
---
RIP Mintchip
---
They also reduced the number of bans from three to two.  One warning ban, then permaban now.
---
Hopefully it makes our ISK worth something - the opposite of what the last two years have done, which is make ISK completely valueless.

I just started a couple months ago and chat has already broken three times like this. What's the deal with this? Has this always happened and the chat servers are just super unstable? I feel like having local or not is pretty critical to the game, seems like that should be a focus.
---
So you're both an arse hole and an idiot. If the botters PLEX then it creates a demand for PLEX. A demand for PLEX means a supply for PLEX will be... supplied. More PLEX. More money for CCP. That means CCP got their fucking money. Do you see how this works sunshine? I bet you're one of those fucking morons who thinks he gets all his shit for free because he mined the ore. You weren't very good in mathematics and it seems you weren't particularly good at reading comprehension, reasoning or critical thinking either.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
What do you mean that billion isk I farmed in two hours singleboxing isn't worth $20 anymore fuck you ccp
---
That got dropped
---
Assuming 777 banned bots weren't replaced by 778 bots.
---
How is an account subbed with PLEX not an $ generator for CCP ?
---
I would consider it if my system would behave that way but it is sitting at around 34°C with peaks of 56°C under typical triple AAA gaming title load. Eve does not stress my system enough to benefit from locking the FPS. Only thing hitting 100% is my GPU VRAM when I multibox 4 accounts on high quality... and that is something that I really only did to test the hardware limits :)
---
its a feature not a bug
---
I don't see why it can't be perma bans tbh.
---
I'd feel embarrassed but it's hard to tell when people really do think this way. Oopsies.
---
That is not an accurate statement at all.
---
Considerably more than several hundred dollars. Developer time is extremely valuable at any company.
---
A fleet in being is a concept, see PL pre-Phoebe at their height.  No small group could use caps for fear of PL suddenly appearing and helicopter dicking their 3 dreads.
---
&gt; Because they [bots] are not cheating
---
That's exactly what they are doing.
---
&gt; Or building the other half of the Aeon hull so it doesn't look like shit?
---
Hear hear! That ship looks like ass. Like someone looked at a cross-section diagram and took it literally. Yeah, I get that ships don't need to be symmetrical. But that ship just looks terrible.
---
Again, I will write it slowly - somebody pays for that plex to be supplued, but it is not the botters. Further explaining how that leads to RMT and how it hurts CCP's interests is another even more comex topic, that you are too dumb to understand.
---
Sometimes in-game definitions are wonky. It really bugs me that repair/battery/medical ships are categorized as "Logistics." When I hear that word, even in the context of fleet engagements, my first thought is haulers bringing ammunition, fuel, fresh hulls, and fleet hangars to the battlespace. I think a more accurate category for the repair/battery/medical ships would be "Support."
---
Pretty sure it's just spaghetti coding.  
---
Update something and it breaks something else
---
Whoosh!
---
In space...
---
Hyperboles just make you look dumb.

Or you're just ignoring everything that was originally said and moving the goal posts.

No.

I agree. It is hard to tell
---
I'm just happy my potato runs EVE without exploding.

Now we need to wait for PA vision on New Eden.
---
Local is back on in null. I am surprised nobody has QQ'd here about that yet.
---
I definitely brought an iteron V to a fleet when I started out when they wanted logi. 
---
No one corrected me and no one ever asked for ammo/charges.
---
oh, right :)
---
Makes it easier to whale and collect the tears of NS carebears, but it's not a big deal to me
---
Teonisude usually has about 70 people in Local with the same portrait, all with Latin and biblical sounding names. I'm positive that's all one person driving the market there.
---
I mean, I am not going to argue with the pros and cons of the blackout, other than to say for weeks a lot of people on r/eve have been singing its praises, and singing CCPs praises for it, and defending it like its the second coming of christ...
---
And local is unannounced turned back on at downtime and there isn't a single thread complaining. I find this shoking.

Must be a slow morning
---
Perhaps I'm missing the point of the video, because it offers nothing for the original claim that Panfam supcap and Titan numbers are comparable to Imperium and Legacy.
---
You can buy PLEX for ISK. So it seems that what HaliJones means is subs bought for PLEX from ISK, rather than meatspace money directly to sub or PLEX for meatspace money.
---
Afaik last i heard there was supposed to be some follow up game for dust where your characters would be ported.
---
Its a shame the game never really took ofg as there was so much cool possibility for cross platform interaction
---
&gt; Like every other system, each wormhole system belongs to a region. That's mostly pointless in wormhole space, because the wormhole connections are completely independent from the reagions. But it affects the respawn mechanic: If a signature despawns, it almost immediately respawns in ANOTHER system suitable of the same region. 
---
This pretty much covers it. If people aren't running sites in your region then you aren't going to get many new sites spawning. In higher class space groups set up farm holes in the same region so that they can expedite site respawning.
---
You said that botters being removed means less botters. Prove that. You said the decreased number of botters means decreased demand. Again. Prove there are less botters. Every comment made post claiming there are less botters hinges on the assumption that there are less botters. The assumption there are less botters hinges on the belief that they do not get replaced. A belief you chose not to justify. So forgive me for logically deducing that your statements are not waterproof.
---
Also get a fucking dictionary. I neither exaggerated anything nor did I make any disprovable claims. I alluded to the fact that botters get replaced by botters. We know this. Prove that it does not. I alluded to the fact that not only are bots being replaced but they grow larger in number. We know this. Prove that they do not. I'm dumb because you said so. Prove this. We've gained at least one more bot over the number of bots banned, is exaggeration to you? Forget hyperbole, you either don't know what it means or you don't understand how to use the term. Let's talk about what really makes people look dumb.

Wormhole sites respawn somewhere in the same wormhole region, not in the same system. I believe the respawn is effectively immediate, but this doesn't help you much.
---
They are cheating but they aren't hacking or changing anything that can be detected by an anti cheat. The only real way to do it would be to see if they click the same pixel everytime but I'm not sure if that is shown server side
---
It didnt help they moved chat to the cloud. Ever since they did that it seems local screws up every few weeks.
---
Only lazy easy changes have been made. Actual development time has been spent on yet another NPE.
---
Thought PA bought the whole studio.
---
This only started when CCP decided to remove the chat as processing overhead by moving chat to a chat protocol that's been proven reliable on Amazon servers. 
---
At one point recently they said they would revert back if they couldn't fix it and then went back on what they said(you'll learn CCP words have little weight) and acknowledged it's broken but that it's staying.
---
Never not huff, clear your sites and pray to Bob.
---
Just say high sec ran out of more of that radio juice.
---
Added to my list of things I didn't know that I urgently needed
---
You are thick if you think that was my point 😂
---
It's not like fires can't happen on space ships, the O2 required would have to come from the ship itself but it would burn all the same.  
---
Smoke would be visible as it slowly expands, until it becomes too thin to see.
---
american girls generally don't want to suck on your slimy stinky worm.
---
Judge how you want, but its still true here.
---
Yes?
---
Good job CCP. Keep collecting tears.
---
"I totally have a good point but I'm not going to make it."
---
Must be that I missed the giant multi-hundred titan slugfests in all those wars huh
---
Already has been made, no need to repeat it since it's still there.
---
Can't hurt, might help
---
And besides that, a good bot developer probably already uses rng to select a pixel inside a range to be clicked. That's relatively simple in the context of my limited automation scripting experience.
---
To be fair i think the more toxic members have social development issues IRL
---
Injectors were a mistake.
---
Does this apply to signatures as well? I was under the impression they were independent of region.
---
Thank you all very much. I wonder, is there a way to determine what region your hole is in?
---
Remember that you will be using different ships for different tasks. As a dedicated solo player, you will have very narrow PVP engagement windows regardless, but one of the overriding requirements you'll have is the ability to run away if you get blobbed. (I mean, you don't *have* to, but the alternatives involve constantly losing ships.) Drakes are cool, but generally aren't good at getting in and getting out. They're good fleet ships, but what you need is a good solo ship. The Hecate might be worth looking into, and a variety of cruisers can be fit for mobility to avoid blobs while taking the fights you can potentially take.
---
Depends on the type of module that you're fitting. For PVP, my general rule is:
---
Guns: always T2
---
DPS modules: compact for general pvp, T2 for gank
---
Scrams, disruptors: meta
---
Stasis webifiers: meta
---
Propulsion: meta
---
Damage control: T2 (much cheaper than the compact version)
---
Shield Tank: T2 (T2 medium shield extenders are much cheaper than the compact version)
---
Armor Tank: T2
---
Rigs: T1
---
This is just a general rule. Some T2 modules are cheaper than their meta versions, so in those cases, I'll try to fit the T2 version.
---
They've been converting it to a cloud based system.
---
Project Nova. Which we haven't heard anything about it since October 2018.
---
So, effectively :CCP:
---
This is all moot. If your not using bombers your doing it wrong. Higher DPS than dreads or marauders, faster than any of them, booshable for added evasion, undetectable, highly escapable, and best of all 50m a pop.
---
If your not playing cloaks online what are you doing?
---
Maybe so, but it's fucked. I'm in Venal and I can still see local chat from our staging system in R1O.
---
that girl is going places, and i support that. sadly EVE is more in line with space sims like the X series (or at least up to X3) or Avorion (minus the build your ships/factions part) so there's a lot of shit happening in space to compensate not being able to land your ship on a planet. and no, DUST514 didnt really get the planetary part right. it did well with the power armor and vehicles thingy but otherwise it was just a glorified FPS in planet based escenarios.
---
an EVE with planets as an integral part of the gameplay mechanics would be something akin to Shores of Hazeron but prettier.
---
*aroused*
---
I already have no faith in the education system. Nothing said, could lost them more.
---
Bombers are already superior to these other ships in a anti-cap role. Climb under the perfect safety of a 50M undetectable ship and get with the program.
---
Okay, I'm confused here. So why is NSH in Vale defending No Visual citadels? Also, why does this seem to make Rote shitpost more than normal in here?
---
search it on dotlan and it'll show the region.
---
real turbokrabs will seed other holes in their region with alphas and use those alphas to initiate warp to the sites to start the despawn timer to force more anoms into your hole.
---
Krab sites are signatures. It doesn't apply to wandering wormholes wormholes, if that's what you mean.
---
Did you anchor it already? If so, just undock, let your ship coast for a bit, and drop a bookmark. Since you have tether, you don't need an off-grid instaundock bookmark in the same way a station might.
---
If you haven't anchored yet, look for the light patterns of the undock. It'll be hard to see, but you're looking for a set of parallel chains of blinking lights coming out from one side and stopping in space.
---
Interesting tidbits: 
---
Legacy is kinda closing the gap in mining and bounties compared to Imperium.
---
TAPI alone mines and rats par or more than entirety of Panfam.
---
Water in balls however seems to be stuck at 2014 levels.
---
Ahh, yes. Thank you for that! Forgot about dotlan. Can't wait to morph into a turbokrab!
---
Perhaps
---
If mining were somehow better then bots would have a harder time.
---
7. 1 Orca mining booster, 1 Orca shield booster/hauler, 4 miners, 1 combat (main), all free slots loaded with PI slaves.
---
Because they botched the implementation and focused on micro transaction clothes instead of actual multi-player interaction, resulting in a six-month patch cycle being wasted on what amounted to a vanity feature with no added content or functionality.
---
I did enjoy being one of the first with a free monocle. The irrational responses that thing evoked were priceless.
---
I played with them a month ago myself. For me the problem was that they are immobile. Which limits their usefulness substantially.
---
I only ever once cared much about an AT match, but it's easy enough to ignore if you're not interested.
---
Make the process kinda automated so everyone can participate and kinda make it like a league that runs quarterly or biannually. Limit bling value until quarterfinals.
---
You already have instanced space...

oh nooo i cant mine as much as i could before
---
An account subbed with PLEX does not generate $.  What it generates is a demand for PLEX (by buying the PLEX with isk).  The PLEX is generated with $, IOW, the person who buys the PLEX from CCP is the one who gives CCP cash for the PLEX.  
---
It implies a possibility that if the demand for PLEX in game is too great it can inflate the value of PLEX to the point that RL $ buy too great a value of in game assets to suit CCP.  A good way to see this is to compare the price of a titan or super against $ over time.  What you will see is a long downward sloping graph over time.  It used to be up to 200 months of game time to buy a titan.  Now it is in the low 10s.
---
So again, the person who subs with PLEX is not generating $.  YOU are not the focus of the company.  They will make decisions that maximize $ from the people who do spend actual $.  While that might mean catering to you, as a way to increase PLEX demand, it might also mean nerfing your style of play.
---
Ctrl+F
---
It may be cool, but there's no air in space, so that would not happen.
---
Iirc you cannot extract from chars that have been banned for botting.
---
We can go back to yelling at each other when CCP gets their shit together. Yelling at each other was half the gameplay and now we don't even have that.
---
Air escaping into space, however, is it's own fuel source.
---
That would be nice but when your opposition on the CSM gets up and leaves then you're wasting a perfectly good opportunity. I'd be astounded if the community as a whole could unite in protest of CCP.
---
Show me on r/Eve where the bad man touched you. Do I need to turn r/Eve over?
---
Lmao are you for real

&gt; No small group could use caps for fear of PL suddenly appearing and helicopter dicking their 3 dreads.

developers don't normally decide what to change though, thats the game designers or hilmar

It will get worse until enough shit is on fire for the community as a whole to finally unite in their hatred for CCP.
---
Gotta wait and see what Panfam can do as they establish their own setup.
---
Hilmar is obviously motivated by money though
---
Not enough for smoke/fire to be created.
---
So what am I if I don't mine nor rat but still think he's stupid. A liar?
---
Isn't this the guy who ran countless projects into the ground then said he sees Eve as nothing more than a cash cow to fund even more of his projects?
---
Well I'll be damned, somebody's thinking outside the box. And a good thought at that.
---
This was #1 item WH space asked for. glad we got it done so quick.

Inb4 Upwell Wormhole Generators let's goons jump a supercap fleet into your home hole

---
600 here bro
---
We broke the game
---
When I started blowing through my ammo while running missions, I bought a BPO for the type I was using. For me, one Procurer hold full of rich pyroxeres was enough for two magazines of ammo for every gun on my mission ship plus a bit extra, with a bunch of minerals left over to put on the market. Whenever I finished a production run I'd take a break from the missions to hit the belt real quick. Between the periodic change of pace and not cutting into my mission earnings for ammo, most of my time there was pretty enjoyable. Never even occurred to me to ungroup my guns, just because popping a frigate within two seconds of entering weapon range is always so enjoyable.
---
uh.. yes? plenty of it
---
Looks more like a bitter vet \*g\*
---
Guess they truly ruined Eve after all.
---
What if instead of being powerless to subcaps, lock times were so long that it would be impractical and very inefficient to rely on supers to clear subcap blobs. Not saying there shouldn't be tracking penalties but there are other things we can do to titans and supers to discourage using them against subs.
---
Shorter Hilmar: Titans were supposed to be a strategic weapon, with benefits to match, and now they're a tactical weapon.
---
You're hung up on the "disposable" part, as far as I can tell, and the problem is, while a titan wouldn't be disposable for me, and maybe not for you, the fact of the matter is that, in aggregate, there are enough of them out there that nullsec blocs now sometimes use them as a line battleship.  Remember when B-R5RB was this astonishing titan supercap battle that got a monument?  We now routinely see more titans than were in that battle deployed so often that people barely notice anymore.
---
If I am wrong, please explain how else PLEX $ get to CCP, and/or how someone who subs using PLEX gets $ to CCP.  I am genuinely interested to learn more.
---
It’s the same principle though. A large bull bloc with exponential economic power will feel the burden of “operating costs” (in whatever form they take)  much less than the up and coming groups that are trying to build that economic foundation. 
---
That’s just the way of EVE is. Whatever restrictions you put on the large groups it’s going to be felt more by smaller groups. Anom nerfs, for example: large groups that own whole regions can afford to spread out and still support swaths of ratters because of how much space they own and how many players they have to support standing fleets as well as infrastructure to help them move around their space quickly and efficiently. If you own a small handful of systems that you pack your Corp/Alliance into you’re going to feel that nerf more than the large bloc. 
---
  There’s a hundred other examples and of course there are exceptions but the point is it takes very careful and measured implementation to make a mechanic that slows down large alliances without crippling the growth of up and coming groups. 
---
But we could nit pick it to death if that’s what you want to do.
---
Join a Corp that does what your Corp should do one day. Learn how they run your Corp and at some point make the switch to your very own Corp.
---
They do inflate the price of Plex tho and I feel like more new players would be playing if the idea of plexing ingame was more feasible for a new player and the "buy sub with $ because paying isk will burn you out" narrative was slightly less true
---
At the same time though. Needing to join an alliance that is actually decent is what put people on either the Imp/TEST side or the Grr Gons side. The necessity to win gives people no reason to not join the winning side.
---
It's on sale atm as well, or it was.
---
Yeah imagine tousands of players logginf into twitch to watch the matches!
---
Maybe one day, when people stop buying pictures of promises of spaceships, and CIG actually have to produce some software to sell instead
---
But today is not yet that day.
---
are you serious.
---
it should be perm bad/ip ban
---
fuck that
---
It’s true. The alliance tournaments were popular.
---
Same with key presses. In Corsair's software (used to make custom keybinds/ lighting profiles for their keyboards and mice), it's macro making tool let's you set pauses between actions to be a random time between two ranges. So like you could make a macro to cycle d-scan once every 3-10 seconds and have a really wide range and likely never get flagged as using a macro
---
Right. Otherwise Goons would have no reason to be careful with them. In this day and age it is an absolute necessity to be on the winning sides. It's eat or be eaten. If you can't exist at the top. You can't exist at all. There are few exceptions to this. This absolutism has driven most players to Gons or Grr Gons. Eve null sec can't accomodate losers as it is now.
---
Yes, please bring back this exclusive club, the trickle-down coolness will save the game
---
1. 100+mil sp combat focused main

This just ends up as a nerf to wormhole groups who frequently need to rely on fax logi for fights.
---
just wait until nov
---
An alpha strike also means firing every weapon you can all at once. See Mechwarrior (and probably Battletech) for a great example of this exact term. Your definition is correct, but so is the other one, and in the context of a 1v1 engagement I would argue that the other one is more likely to apply here. However if you're talking about an asymmetric fleet engagement, your definition would likely be better applied, as in "We need X amount of ships to drop on-grid in order to Alpha the target."

My only regret is that I have but one upvote to give for this post.

CSM members from all sides have vocally denounced CCPs decisions for years and have actively warned against them. These are the veteran players CCP should have listened to. The people they brought on to listen to but then never actually listened to.

Too scared to use it? Poor Waffles. Can't play with big toys because they are too risk averse.

Hi, it wasn't permanently cancelled. It is not the reason no one plays. It also has a finite limit on number of participants, so you won't see a bunch of people coming back and we're to participate in it.

I've only participated in one AT but it was fun, I'd like them to bring it back.

If nothing else esports get a bit of attention from gaming sites, and more attention brings new players.

Unfortunately this is why CCP doesnt listen because its plain too see eve has become full of Immature people who have to be angry all the time. Keyboard warriors

---
One group says the torpedo launchers are OP because big stuka fleets keep killing their Rorquals.

Another group says the bombs are OP because they keep losing their excavator drones.

The last group says that bombers are OP because they can cloak 24/7 and reduce ADMs.

Oh nice. Elite:Dangerous is really fun in VR with a flight stick and throttle. Gonna have to give NMS a try again.
---
Rock, paper scissors isn't the only option. I've said this one a lot and I don't know how good an idea it is exactly but I hope it can serve as an example of how else we can make changes. If super capital lock times were so severely long against sub capitals, then you wouldn't need to reduce capital damage application or make them vulnerable to subcaps. This may even resolve Fax being so oppressive in sub cap brawls. If it takes a full minute just to lock a BS. Then all of a sudden your Fax is ineffective logi. Or your super is ineffective at clearing subcaps. I mean they'll eventually win and will technically always hold any grid against subs provided you have enough of them. But you're so inefficient at it that all of a sudden a sub capital presence is so much more crucial. Especially when subs can warp off and you have to start that lock all over again. Or the increased lock time makes subs capable of defanging faster than supers can kill subs. Reducing capital to sub capital interaction is also a potential solution over the traditional rock, paper, scissors mentality.
---

It's not the time it takes to change certain values, it's trying to determine what effect that will have on the rest of the game.
---
Since the dev who did it manually left years ago, CCP can't put new ads in or get them out.
---
Maybee soon^((C)) there will be tools to handle this...

---
&gt;Carriers i think are ok they can be easily defanged and are not terribly tanky. Perhaps make it where when you nsa you can't get reps. I'd even argue to give carriers like a +2 to warpcore stability so a single interceptor can't hold you down. I'll likely get alot of flak for that bit i know.
---
I agree with this.
---
Carriers apply fuck all DPS to small targets now. They can also be held down by a fucking ibis with a point, and haven't got a whole lot of health. It's pretty ridiculous. If they can't do a lot to small targets, It should at least take more than one frig to pin them down. I'm not of the opinion that a carrier should be helpless without a defence fleet, cause I'm not an idiot who cries that his T3C/ lone bomber can't solo one. 
---
Carriers should be more equipped to deal with small, fast moving targets than dreads, supers, or titans.
---
if you're not a retard or a 1 year old player you can easily see the changes a 2.5% effect on a statblock will have on the meta/ships
---
And carriers for what..? Looking nice in your hangar?

Sure buddy, keep telling yourself that.
---
Best part is the 15 year old chat actually worked.  Its the new shit that's fucked, like most of the stuff in game.  #TopTierDevelopment
---
Multi boxing logi is incredibly difficult during a real fight, especially armor brawls
---
The real reason is players got mad at CCP and made them stop making walking in stations.
---
5% here, 5% there, adds up pretty quick. And a lot of the bonuses are bigger than that... Range bonuses on T2 neuts are like 20% I believe, and also on T2 points.
---
Most people will prioritize T2 weapons and then look at the fitting that's left over. 
---
It did used to be true that there were some M4 modules that were objectively better than T2 but I think that's been fixed.
---
Are you having fits of rage when a new patch erases your login details from the launcher?
---
Because I do.
---
You don't specifically need air for something to burn, what you mean is that you need an oxidizer. How do you think rocket engines work in space? They bring their own fuel and oxidizer with them.
---
4 accounts 2 pilots each all for PVP. Fly all t3cs on ateast one pilot per account. Ones a cap pilot. One sits in whatever null sec alliance let's me in to profit off their market until I get kicked for not participating.
---
Yeah but no one looks at Jita chat, it gives cancer.
---
Yeah, we caught and reported these guys a few days ago.
---
Fuck you for baiting me into clicking on an INN link
---
I mean this simply would make all supercaps safelog instead.
---
Caps should never be vulnerable to subs in sizeable numbers. There aren't many sci fi universes out there that allow small numbers of significantly smaller ships to exist as the counter to considerably large assets similar to titans. So if a super blob is going to exist as an unstoppable force and immovable object. Then the interaction that it can have with subs should be severely limited. They're used to win strategic objectives and kill capitals. Though I suppose there needs to be more incentive for the capital side to also bring subs if they're already going to win the objective... like subs being able to halt unsupported super fleets from automatically winning objectives but not actually kill the super fleet?
---

NSH was in Vale in smallgang shit and saw a fleet next door after traveling around. Trying to provoke a fight with someone, anyone.
---
NSH also isn't blue and we shoot each other when the opportunity rises, though we do have a history with unspoken and would help them if they ever asked. (They haven't asked) I don't even know who No Visual are tbh  
---
We didn't come to Vale to Blue up to shoot some weird roleplaying neckbeard's alliance. We came here because it seems the area is a content magnet at the moment.
---
Only the FCs know bro
---
Sure. Not saying botters are good for the economy. But pretending CCP doesn't get any money from them like some people do is foolish. If someone is Omega, CCP got paid at some point.
---
Minor nitpick.  Titans weren't in the game until a few years after release.  At launch, the game only had Frigates, Cruisers, and Battleships.  Everything else (including T2) has been added in patches.
---
You are right that titans were designed to be unobtainable.  They failed on that front.

If they really wanted titans to be group assets, they could have just limited them to 1 titan/corp or something.

So fuck that noise.
---
I dont mind NSH being here. Benzmann is a close friend and always talked highly of you guys. Just so far we have only seen you try to shoot us and our friends. Look forward to the good fights.
---
You gotta get over how you feel about loosing shit.
---
My perspective is, the minute I buy and fit a ship it's a countdown until it's gone and I look forward to that glorious death, even if it's to a gate camp or smart bomber. No matter the price of my ship. The level of player on player violence in this game is far beyond that in any another game. The fact that you can die anywhere at anytime is what gets me coming back. I just take don't use it if you can't loose it too a new level. The beauty of it all is the more often you fight the better you get at not dieing.
---
Sadly, I have to support adding local in W-space
---
"Fun" and good fights should be the main drive here, not fighting for lands. Otherwise it's just endless grinding for what ? space pixel real estates ? That's worthless

to be fair, reviving does not mean a swift return to the burial happened afterwards

Fires can be a problem otherwise they wouldn't take measures against having fires.

I need to write up an article on the "Crab Bucket" mentality and how it applies to EVE some day. It's been on full display lately, and not just from the anti-NS groups, but equally from the NS groups back into the wider community - Wishing for nerfs and the removal of tools from HS and WH's.

It's almost like everyone is cheering on an era of reverse development, and it makes me very sad to see, even though I'm not particularly adverse to most of the changes that have been made.

Ever had friends on AT teams? Obv not.  
---
I've never flown in one, never been interested. But the two teams with players I had close relationships with, those guys were practicing almost every damn day or brainstorming fits for months and months before AT.   
---
AT players are some of the most dedicated, knowledgable people in this game. Not having an AT is a direct gut punch to anyone striving to do more than super rat or rorqual mine in this game.  
---
Keeping people like this in Eve is important for the game. If you don't believe the same, well, you're just too ignorant or arrogant to see it.

They could get more subs by uploading a video of falcon shitting in a bucket

The bots upped their game. Back in the day they would have just been named 001,002,003,etc. Guess CCPs algorithm can't detect the new naming scheme.

Sorry I worded that badly, I meant WH space is now the only truely sage option and out produces null by about a factor of 3.

There is no local. I've been flying within no local for ovwr a month. That was Himlers first flipped table.
---
C5 wormholes. Also if you roll all the holes, you have a 4 hour window where noone can get in, or out, and you'll know instantly if someone rolled a hole in.
---
You have one scout maybe two and you have complete coverage on that hole.
---
My point is thay maybeHimler should stop flipping tables, and ask us, the players, how it would be best to balance things.
---
One idea that would cause a lot of titans and supers to actually be used and lost, would be to get rid of jump fatigue, jump timers, and set it back to the old way, so the big alliances have an incentive to really fuck with each other's stuff
---
Getting rid of asset saftey is another half baked idea that, while I personally, and much of goons wouldn't even care about, wouldn't have the intended result, because you still aren't getting people to undock.
---
People are complaining about 45bil isk avatars and Erebus? The prices wont go back up until they start getting blown up.

I'll agree that goons are currently the strongest force in the game, but here is what all you other guys forgot: WE ARE NOT GOOD at this game. We are just currently more organized than anyone else. If you asked Mittens if Goons are good at EvE, i guarantee he'd laugh and tell you "fuck no, we suck. Y'all just suck a little more"
---
An idea that I think would work well I open Jove space, and make a special team at CCP that has to defend Jove space from the rest of us. We will start losing Titans and supers again
---
That's the point. These people are suggesting simply penalizing a botters wallet instead of banning. I'm simply stating why that wouldn't deter
---
Make local great again
---
If we had someone in the hole this wouldn’t be a problem at all lol...
---
People have been saying Eve is dead since it came out. People just get mad when someone messes with their sandbox or at least their personal ideal sandbox. It's a game thats meant to change over time. How I play, the changes only make things better. How someone else plays, changes feel like it make it worse for them. It is what it is.
---
Eve players wanted chaos. CCP holds a meeting. Out of that meeting came the plan of no local chat. Implementation steps: do nothing, it's broke anyway. Saves CCP money.
---
They need to make bigger ships if theyre not satisfied with how they’ve proliferated over the years.
---
The community will baulk at the idea but if theyre designed better they can be beneficial to a healthier vision of EVE.
---
Ah, yea the No Visual part is the weird thing for me. Went and looked at their KB and basically it's just Rote/Unspoken defending No Visual's strategic objectives. Vale is a weird place.
---
The meme is too never talk about JAG, event if they are our greatest ally ever and the reason why Prothean have die off during the Quiet War.
---
It's not CCPs fault it's random people who manipulate the market and bot
---
sounds like an extractor problem, not injector
---
Or you know, suicide gang them like everyone else.
---
Just find someone willing to give you their Titan on sisi. The server is mirrored every few months so it’s not really an issue if they don’t use it on that server.
---
&gt;Not necessarily. Real world is a sandbox.
---
and in the realworld there are no more "great wars" like WW2, WW1 ...
---
Only proxy wars. Real world nukes are pretty much the SCAP fleets of eve online.
---
It is, but he mentioned he tried some PvP so may have not set it back.
---
stories tell he's the only goon that can hold tackle
---
What did they do before FAXs? Do that again.
---
While the logic train is a bit unsound, I agree with the general premise.
---
AT as it was before was, honestly, more of the grand finale that the entirety of the season. It would take a much larger workforce for CCP to manage a proper season with the AT being the final event. It's not impossible but I'd be shocked if it happened.
---
On a side note, everyone in here poopooing on the AT are probably the same ones that think blackout is killing small alliances.
---
That was a good read. Ive found the drop in ratting and increase in mining interesting considering the massive increase in excavator kills. The drop in ratting could be attributed to the increased difficulty of botting due to blackout. Though we have seen instances of bots implementing rudimentary work arounds such as watching the gate and tracking incoming players. For the most part the drop in ratting is probably due to people down shipping, switching activities, or simply quiting. Which leads to my next point. 
---
I too, expected an increase in destruction with the arrival of blackout but I think that expectation dismissed the effect players switching activites or quiting would have. With blackout it is easier to catch players by surprise which increases destruction. However, the play field may not be as populated so that negates the benefits of easier pickings. Also, the significant increase of excavator kills might be inflating the destruction values quite a bit. 
---
Thus Blackout has decreased the target richness of the enviroment whilst increasing the effectiveness of hunting resulting in a smaller playerbase maintaining the same level of activity as before. Who knows what else CCP will do. Maybe they will rein in the citadel menace.
---
Inb4 Seddow and Seiku find a use for this XD
---
Ah I was wondering if signatures spawned independently of region ( eg, one data/relic site cleared doesn’t help influence another ), or if both signatures and anomalies fell under the same regional spawn. 
---
I was always personally under the impression that all signatures were random spawn, and anom spawns were region based. Good to know if it does work otherwise for signatures though.
---
"Fun fights" are rare, even if there is not any "land" to fight for, look at WoW.
---
For fun fights - just add some arenas. 
---
"But why should they be able to fight 1v1 in safety, I want to gank them with my bigger ship, or with my 100 friends!".... Then why complain about the current state of the game, where fun/balanced fights are rare. These balanced fights will not happen without an incentive for balanced fights, or whithout arenas.
---
I don‘t like the cyno changed neither.
---
some of it was kind of alien to me but was worth a read, thank you.
---
From what I read into these numbers, my guess is that a LOT less people are bringing out their Rorquals. Some have opted to use Exhumers instead while others have stopped to log in.
---
I wonder what this would do in the long run to the game. Even before there were places in 0.0 where you could literally roam around for hour(s) and not see a soul.
---
You don't throw away a disposable razor before you use it though..
---
Destruction has never mattered much anyway. Creation has always vastly outpaced it.
---
Inb4 people open t4/t5 in jita in shit fit cruisers just to get waves of trig ships into jita to mess with everyone
---
They used triage carriers
---
Bonus points: When a ship drops below about 2/3 Structure, all the lights on it start to flicker as well. Just to really get the point across that you're in deep.
---
Only bring it back of they get rid of the rules that prevent this happening:
---
https://youtu.be/jy2PJpmwoYc
---
Cause you can’t have one? Titans are only effective against capitals and structures. Ever watched titans try to fight subcaps? Only the doomsday’s MIGHT hit and that’s if the subcap pilot is retarded
---
To my knowledge they actually do that to some extent, mostly in the form of corp taxes. Corp taxes that were paid with RMT/Bot funds get subtracted, resulting in the extremely painful situation where the corporation has negative ISK in its wallet.
---
In extreme cases, billions of negative ISK.
---
6 month bans have actually proven more effective in other games.
---
People are more likely to just create a new account for a perma-ban.
---
If the world has gone 10k years of constant wars and then stopped last 50 years due to specific reasons then a sandbox game should be able to provide the constant war environment for as long as it wants. If it stagnates, remove the specific reasons for stagnation.
---
Evejobs is that way
---
Plex $ get to ccp any time someone spends the money to acquire it
---
T4s and t5s should never have been available in hisec.
---
Lol no they won't.  The AT was barely watched after they got rid of betting.  I love the AT too but stop being dumb
---
I've called him Himler in every comment I've mentioned him in.
---
Why do you keep spamming this thread?
---
I don't know about "many". It was never popular.
---
65% of players have 1 account. 20% have 2 accounts.
---
A new T2 battlecruiser. A heavy bomber that uses XL torps. :)
---
Those are the engine exhausts, the vents are closed in warp mode to avoid getting them durty :P
---
To be honest. If it helps tidi a bit in big fights I personally dont mind the occasional (lol) hiccup. Especially since we have the blackout now anyways
---
before WW1/2 there was not global communications so wars were localised.
---
Plex is not a item sold by NPCs.
---
In order for there to be plex on the market for someone to buy with ISK, someone first had to swipe their credit card and give CCP 19.95 for 500 (less per 500 if they buy the $100 pack).
---
In other words plex doesn't exist until someone pays CCP real money.  CCP then makes a database entry to give the person the plex the purchased.  Now the player can put it on market for sale.
---
Selective memory for ~the narrative~
---
I still can’t cyno to Jita tho
---
I do love the ship damage :)
---
First one got removed by auto mod due to account age and I wanted feedback.
---
Sigh. Isk has had more buying power in the past 2 years than in the years before. The only exceptions being plex and tech 2. The latter being due to moon changes.
---
Dont believe me? How much did a titan or super cost 4 / 5 years ago? How much does one cost today? ISK buying power has increased, not decreased for nearly all ingame assets, since mineral production has well kept up. 
---
You are mixing up inflation with powercreep, which is a different issue
---
CCP honestly needs to incorporate more into the base engine of the game. Third party tools and services should be used as examples of things to bring in.
---
In game fitting was a great idea, but still has ways to go.
---
Betting would be another but there's some major legal hurdles that you have to get over that make it mostly dead in the water.
---
been a thing for... a decade now
---
HTFU whers!!!!1!11!One!!11
---
Well, I’m glad my ISK will be worth more. Right now 100 bil doesn’t feel like a lot.
---
I’ve got 15 bil in compresses ore, wondering if I should sit on it or dump it into the market.
---
Russians (xix) had a super/titan blob. Hell, solar/-a-‘s  solo superblob was only toppled by pl/ncdot/nulli. -A- before the fall is where PL’s later titan crew in B-R came from.  NC. before the fall n3. Raiden.
---
Do I even need to go on? 
---
Co2 doesn’t really count for much.

You really dont know what youre going to get day to day to be honest.

Purpose in EVE: conquer space. After a long time, someone wins the game, then there is peace, or big blue doughnut. What do you want to remove? The pupose of the game? Maybe make it so that nobody can own space, or it's not profitable to own space, then we fight just because we can without added "consequences". But for me, that would just make it like any other space game. 
---
The reason I became insterested in EVE was this "space conquering" stuff. EVE appealed to me more as an RPG game, not as an action game. If that is gone, as I said, for me 90% of the appeal is gone.
---
Actually, I do have friends on my Alliances AT team.
---
The AT does not provide content for anyone other than the participants. Provides zero ingame content for anyone other than rewards. 
---
They literally missed one AT, it isn't the end of the world. If anyone quit over not having the AT the game is better for it. They should go to WoW if all they want is instanced arena PvP. The rest of is will stick around for the game that isn't just on a test server.
---
2 accs one dps the other scanny,support, logi
---
What was the highest viewer count the AT ever got on twitch?
---
If others enjoyed if so much they maybe should bring it back, personally I never gave a crap about it given given the stupid rules, although in the more recent editions they finally started limiting the wallet factor a bit, in the favor of skill.
---
botters just increase the price of plexes on market...fuck off ,defender of bot
---
I don’t see a problem w/this.
---
so what should I use in place (also I've died three times since posting that post and lost 7 mil worth of stuff to Ai. mostly so what should I use?)
---
I think with faxes it's too hard to kill supers especially for subs i would like to see them more vulnerable to subs when they are caught out of positions where they can be supported. Obviously not if you have more caps on grid than they have subs but a single titan should still need to actually be saved it shouldn't be able to wipe the floor with a sub gang attacking it.
---
Sure tell me you in-game name and i'll send you mine. I'm new(ish) too just above 2 months, but i,ll be happy to help
---
Wait, you're seriously arguing that because XiX had a super/titan blob (though notably many fewer than panfam), and -A-'s super/titan blob eventually became PL's titan blob that titans and supers were as common then as they are now? I think you might be embellishing just a *bit* don't you?
---
&gt; Co2 doesn’t really count for much.
---
Certainly not any more. But they were about the same strength as TEST, give or take a little. Care to explain how TEST went from plucky underdogs to having a titan/super fleet rivaling everyone but Goons in, oh, 3 years? Surely you're not going to pretend that all those pilots *already* had those supers and titans, right? You're going to admit that they sucked every rock in Esoteria dry for a few years to build &amp; train into them, _right_? Or are we persisting with this insane notion that super and titan proliferation isn't really that bad; those of us who don't like it are just forgetting that titans and supers have always been common?
---
Sorry, but giving that mouthbreathing smoothbrain a platform is dumb.
---
 players {paying for that plex with real money {gona invest dollars in a game infested with botts,u wrong

&gt;The reason I became insterested in EVE was this "space conquering" stuff. EVE appealed to me more as an RPG game, not as an action game. If that is gone, as I said, for me 90% of the appeal is gone.

Except that I do.
---
Yeah sure it's not like highsec wardec groups are willingly to take any more risk ja?
---
Actually it is 100% CCP's fault. The game mechanics they put in place enabled isk faucets to vastly out-do the sinks, thus causing rampant inflation.
---
None. But I like to have a reason for fighting, this is the RPG element. Having a "story" to take part in, makes the game something else.

I don't recall CCP banning any of our corps

Some classes of products are largely immune to inflation.  
---
Money supply is most significant when there is the possibility of investments to be made.  In this sim, the linkages are really loose, and investments have little bearing on supply of products.  In most cases, it's a buyers' market, so margins are generally thin on anything that moves at all.
---
It would make the ships feel smaller.

Only fought in it once, watched every year though, no betting killed is what kills the AT.

---
Besides what else is said here also consider fleet fights. Even if you have same numbers in the same ships. Having an extra 5% damage over your opponent is a huge advantage.
---
Activating someones T3 AB was my favorite saying
---
Are we gonna pretend TAPI didn't give/rent out Omist to the botting army? or this is something Vily doesn't tell the line member dinobrains, thus it never happened? And before AOM, this region had another botting alliance (-KWG-) that lived there uninterrupted and paying for years...
---
 I think you need to call for reinforcements on your downvote brigade. Even ping in alliance if you have to.
---
You will have to pardon Lolmeca. Having him listen to us is a privilege, he has CCPs ear now, our opinions do not matter to him. His words, not mine
---
worth
---
While I too want CCP to develop and balance things (namely by iteration and not massive nerfs/buffs once every 1-5 years), there are a few things in your post that make me not take it seriously.
---
1) Assuming CCP spends "hours and hours" on something while completely ignoring something else.  We only know the results, not the full process.
---
2) Stating there is an "easy fix" for something.  Rarely the case in a game this complicated.  How long before your gimmick-drive fix is exploited by someone?
---
3) I think your understanding of what it costs to develop features is woefully underestimated.
---
The only outcome is a winner. Then the winner may decide to blow up his ships because peace in a game is boring, or whatever. Yes, peace is boring in a game, but fighting to obtain that "peace" in fact fighting to "win" the game is what makes the game interesting.
---
I'm still waiting for rise's promised "last year of botting removals by alliance" chart.  I think you'll find I cleared the botting corps out of KWG when we took over, and AOM is not the botting haven you give it the credit for being.
---
Because those are the only valid opinions? Ok, he is correct.  And before you ask, GSF diplo.
---
CCP's weak excuse for a horrible chat system.
---
The Drake fleet FC asked our FC to not kill the fleet because they were on a “memorial roam”, so much to our chagrin, our FC ordered us to warp off.
---
We could have easily smashed the fleet. It had nothing to do with them somehow evading us.
---
Hi, arenas already exist, and few fight there.
---
I've never once seen it. Don't people watch it over twitch?
---
So bringing the tournament back will only bring the few players back, if they've even quit to begin with.
---
That happens because of internal combustion.
---
Listening to him talka bout "the problems of playstyles in eve" and "bringing danger to nullsec"
---
Olmecca just wants to kill things, capital ships makes it harder to do that casually so he wants it nerfed to be easier for him.  
---
I'm tired of the "SOMEONE HAS SOMETHING BIGGER &gt;: (" circlejerk.  Mine your own capitals. Grow up and compete, or do what frigates can do when capitals blob on grid.  
---
Leave. Find something your size to hunt.
---
Eve is as dangerous as you make it.  Defenders have used umbrellas to bring actual danger to hunters for the first time in history instead of roams being roflstomps until caught somehow (by choice) 
---
The "problem" with krabs is that hunters don't krab and thus cannot compete economically.  It's long term effort for macro gameplay, and whether Olmecca, hilmar, or any crying angry people like it or not... that's how sandboxes are played. The "elite" who focus on efficient kills... and the "krabs" who make enough to not give a damn about that efficiency.

Really excellent write up /u/Robbbin_Hood ... On point 100%, imo. Thanks for taking the time to put this together.
---
you are so wrong it hurts, but it's not worth debating someone with such a bad grasp of the game. just fyi, when people say "ISK is meanginless", they mean that losing it doesn't matter. because of the increased buying power. sure, I can welp 10 titans now, and get them back in a week! but the ISK is valueless. look at PLEX price versus ISK, or AT ship versus ISK, for things that have a fixed value (or semi-fixed, because yes, USD does fluctuate) and you'll see just how shit inflation is.

This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  You can only push your "I'm smart because i kill things" agenda so far bro

---
They were not that cancerous, because lack of capital capboosters and 3200s
---
Exactly what we've always wanted............
---
Take my upvote friend
---
I completely agree with ccp and completely disagree with you. Massive capital fleets that create umbrellas have completely stagnated Eve with the same alliances holding the same space sometimes for over a decade.     
---
They want null sec back the way it used to be where there was no "safety" in null space and if you wanted to reap the rewards of nullsec you need to fight for it every day. Maintaining and defending a capital fleet should be a HUGE investment considering the power they weild.    
---
They have been making it pretty clear they are unhappy with the stagnation of nullsec and are going to be making a lot of changes. No one believed they would actually black out null local; done. More is coming, and a lot of people out in lowsec/highsec/wh are just waiting for the days of the invincible umbrella to end. Then ns will be fun again and real wars will resume, hopefully.    
---
Personally I wish they had never even created caps. Null PvP was way more fun before them. Now if you attempt to invade a major power Bloc, unless you have a capital fleet that can rival an alliance that's sat in their region for a decade amassing their fleet (which no one can, it's simply logistically impossible right now), no matter how many people you round up they will drop their cap fleet in and annihilate everything long before you can drop a single POS.
---
&gt; It is well that war is so terrible, or we would grow too fond of it.
---
The AT prizes were fucking stupid
---
What are you even on about
---
Do you moan about low powered structures in space?   I happen to know that blowing up low powered structures is fairly profitable, the more that do it and get rewarded by the people moaning about them the better.
---
Having the ability to apply a bounty on a structure which is used as a war HQ makes a lot of sense and entices more people to chance their arm.
---
Also I know that a particular war decker looks for suitable structures to blap, a bounty will add to its desirability in their eyes.    I am assuming you have no idea who I am referring to, but that is your issue.
---
Those times you could easily neut out triage carrier and get it rekt, now try do it with ninazu even after capbooster bonus nerf
---
How about we just cancel local chat, we call it the age of chaos, because we can't fix it?  Hopefully a nice little interview here and there and a podcast will get some upvotes and hide the incompetence behind coding proper chat channels.
---
A question how is exploration a highly profitable career? 
---
With the build you see I would just jump into Guristas sites and kill them and salvage I would get 500k to mil from loot and salvage.(I had mixed result sometimes I would get owned sometimes I would they would own me (I've popped 2 times by now).
---
But on youtube and other places people can to earn 50-100 mil in a day so how do they do that?
---
I've heard that they go to relic and data sites? (jeez it feels like decades since I last saw one) but I've never found one other the ones they give you at the training career missions.
---
Also what is this tactic or strat of getting started. As you can assume even with the money that starting career mission you can't play the game properly you need higher level stuff but it's astronomically higher than the money received from the training mission.
---
Are you sure that you are covering all the angles here?   Your detailed rebuttal might have missed something?
---
Still tl;dr
---
Looks like the income from ratting and mining is settling down to be more in line with other means of generating isk, meaning the other options are more viable now. Perhaps more people will try new things to generate isk.  
---
I've always held the view that the Ratting numbers and Rorqual numbers for isk generation were through the roof.
---
So for me, and my Bias view, things are just now "Returning to normal state" which is **GREAT**. This is a good thing.
---
It's just harder to take away candy from a kid once you've given it to them, the kid will cry, but it's for their benefit in the long run! EvE will once again have a clean dental record. *(I'm bad with metaphors)*
---
You know, I'm tempted. How much time per week do you expect would be sufficient?
---
They are openly saying they fucked up basically, and are gonna fix it.
---
wtg, when servers malfunction and players are happy
---
I always say NMS is basically minecraft in space.
---
no
---
I say this because almost university, the actual people that create those "storys" for you, say that current game mechanics need to be changed to avoid stagnation. (this is not a reference to "chaos era" changes, more cap application, fax and citadels to name a few)
---
Downvoted because you asked for people to stop downvoting. You're welcome
---
And then the combustion leaves through a hole
---
Others had the idea of limiting structures. I think that's smart too. Spamming them all over was certainly not the vision when the feature was introduced. If the ratio was something like 1 XL : 5 L : 25 M per constellation that would be more than enough. Would certainly force some interesting judgment calls between refineries, engineering complexes and citadels.
---
I'll second that no
---
From the massive amount of stuff from CCP I've read lately, they don't hate caps etc, but the way things worked out making the major null alliances invulnerable and nearly 100% safe is the problem. They have said repeatedly the risk vs reward of current nullsec is way out of whack. It's safer in alliance space than jita.
---
I don't know that OP is saying that he doesn't like the fact that people like other stuff so much as he is oblivious to it, or just isn't considering it.
---
I think it's a thing where some people define a game as something with a "win condition" and other people define a game as something that is "fun".
---
There’s actually quite a few cases in history of announcements or changes shifting entire markets, mainly through announcements of pending new technologies or technology changes (nerfs/buffs)
---
Look into drone components, t2 materials, and even the blackout and cyno changes to monitor specific values from the dates before and after.
---
Of course it can get a LOT more complicated than buffs and nerfs, but market speculation has made many a trillionaire and moved them into big plays as well. 
---
Even the current changes with blackout and the cyno changes have moved supers to being firesold, titans and their bpos to be dropped by prolific owners and producers. It’s a living market, so good luck!
---
I say we have a titan that fires a DD that makes everyone within its AOE prolapse at their computer screen. Real risk!
---
You mean:  [http://www.torpedodelivery.com/new-products/torpedo-delivery-guide-wingspantt](http://www.torpedodelivery.com/new-products/torpedo-delivery-guide-wingspantt) , right? I don't know who Karasu Tengu is, but it is most courteous to link to the delivery guide in context, I think.
---
By admitting to and addressing them? Everyone who hates his views are ns people who don't want to have any risk. Yes ns alliances PvP, but never risk anything core to their money machines. It seems that is going to be changing.
---
CCP has a player represented counsel that they dont listen too.
---
Not much. Be self sufficient, be active regularly and don't be a freeloader. We respect rl commitments, so there are no participation quotas or something like that.
---
Technically the CSM just costs them money....
---
No, but they are way more valid than dinoposter_npc 5000 because they actually are "empire builders".
---
I would agree we are not at the blue doughnut yet, 2014 was way worse.
---
1% chance of all items in hangar spontaneously combusting upon login.  Training the Thermodynamics skill reduces the risk by .05%.
---
I would agree with that. Yet this is a solid resource that CCP for the most part seems to ignore. Vily's 100 thing list was pretty solid ideas.
---
Didn't see that list. Sadly CCP only listens to random ideas from what i've seen. Like all the suggestions about injectors and mining rorquals fell on deaf ears, here we are now with a titan in every hanger.
---
BUT THEYLL KILL THE EVIL CAPITALS THAT EVERYONE HATES

Taking active people from actually playing the game to sisi practice fighting for 3months of the year isn't productive.
---
high : covops cloak / sister probe launcher
---
mid: mwd / data / relic (or the integrated zeugma) , remaining slots to your liking . I'd say shields or scanning helper mids
---
low: damage control / inertial stab
---
rigs : polycarbon engine or scanning.
---
you should be good to go. But I recomment using the covops frigate or T1 scanning until you get the hang of it. Losing an astero early on can be quite a hit on your finance
---
Pretty sure "blatant" botting is instant permaban.  This is more for a normal player who tries to automate something, not an account that only bots
---
No Vis is a means to an end: Fights.

They don't hold any status with us. LS tries too hard to lump us in with them to make it seem like they are achieving more than what's happening here.
---
Playing the Reddit game is a drag, he should put his efforts into being better at the game.
---
The whole concept of multiboxing is a reason I pretty much gave up on EVE after 5 years of playing.
---
A true EVE trailer should show a WoW guy from South Park warping his ~~bot~~ alt miner fleet to the belt while covering them with few super alts.
---
If you want to play  with a single character, EVE is definitely not your game.

100% correct.. Here is vily's post.

Thanks I'll have a read while I sit here leading 350 other Goon Rorquals to grind a region worth of moons.
---
Ok, as a diplo for the largest bloc in the game, he is right, you are wrong.
---
Yawn
---
Just recently, with the cyno changes, black ops and recons all went up in price.
---
But that's speculative in nature.
---
But o think your example with brexot isn't really accurate. Even in a rational market, the prices of some stocks would change.
---
As the implication with brexot is that the UK will no longer have favorable trade agreements with the EU and this will affect UK companies profitability in those markets.
---
And as stock are valued based on potential future dividends that come from profits, the value of those stock could drop.
---
Just the fact that the future is uncertain doesn't make all speculation about the future fundamentally irrational.
---
Seems really odd that you felt that nothing about the UK stock market changed with that announcement. The future changed. And that's what stock represents.
---
It’s very convenient to say that viewership was diminishing and ccp had to cut it after removing betting. But causes and consequences are not that straightforward, in reality ccp fucked up so hard on AT announcement and support after the betting era that viewership and participation went downwards hard. Btw AT is still supposed to come back next year. Falcon even said that he would resign if it didn’t lmao.
---
I dunno, I feel if you want a Masters degree you should do your own research.

I got distracted by Hilmar’s naked butt.

---
Ban the bot and penalize the receiver of isk. There has to be a penalty for buying/using ISK from the botter. I mean ccp should have enough of data to recognize the patterns how rmt is done. If end users knew there is a high chance to get caught for using ISK from a botter, it should reduce the demand. If you risk losing your account for getting isk illegal way it would be not worth it. Just create new acc? It should be quite easy to flag new acc that increase assets without official plex financial transactions.
---
Part of it falls on the players.  Fighting is fun, but to win a war the easiest way to get your enemy to stop fighting.  Blue balls is a player driven problem.  That isn’t the only hinderance to wars, but its certainly one of them.
---
So much this.
---
A sandbox game can maintain a balance between growing large and keeping small. Current Eve is far from that balance but it doesn't mean such an Eve is impossible.
---
AT isn't gone.
---
They just skipped it alongside fanfest this year
---
The loss of betting wasn't the only reason of course.  It definitely had other issues.
---
***gs_isk would like to know your location***
---
Maybe CCP realized command economies are shit.
---
A very tough 5 Minot ADC though would be a similar challenge, but allowing more options than just "wait"
---
Edited to say "Remove the Magic 14" instead of implying that I meant to remove Skills entirely (lol).
---
And what are the three things that you need for combustion?
---
&gt;  Ive found the drop in ratting and increase in mining interesting considering the massive increase in excavator kills.
---
The biggest thing here is likely because rorqs can fit cynos and PANIC, allowing them to easily survive until the umbrella comes.
---
i concur , i can't tell who knows less him or hilmar
---
Yes. The oxygen is used up. Please remember that that gas, unlike fluids, tends to fill the entire volume of the container given, only stopped by external forces. As there does not exist enough oxygen to fill the entire practically endless void of space, they would spread at such a distance so that there would not be enough oxygen per cube meter of space for external combustion to happen. The physics of gasses would also force the gas inside of the exploded compartment to leave the open area, forcing the combustion to stop. Thus smoke and/or fire would not be able to continue, unless resources would be provided by some external force, like the ship. This, however, is wasteful and would be prevented by the ship's engineers.
---
Though I never participated in the AT I watched it religiously; fascinated and intrigued by the setups, tactics and flying. The Leshak made the last one utter shite though.
---
Christ /o\
---
&gt;It is well that EVE is so terrible, or we would grow too fond of it.
---
 -- /r/eve
---
It takes time for the gas to spread, and for it to leave the ship through a hole. You could get fire for a time until you run out as you say
---
&gt;They literally missed one AT, it isn't the end of the world. If anyone quit over not having the AT the game is better for it. They should go to WoW if all they want is instanced arena PvP. The rest of is will stick around for the game that isn't just on a test server.
---
Yes. Losing some the most involved players in the game is OK and isn't a problem. And they obviously only play for the instanced PVP, they are never the guys and gals behind the content generation you otherwise enjoy the rest of the year, nope. AT players are a bunch of scrubs that just want instanced PVP. /s  
---
Just wow.
---
One account, one character. I do have an unsubbed alt account that I used for cynos and covert ops bridges but lately I've been relying on my Corp and my alliance members.
---
Yuuuup
---
Does the game still have a way to get security status back? Coming back after 5ish years and sitting at -10 in a afk old corp won't cut it. I think I need a reset.
---
No.   The elite small-gang-elite-peeveepee-downvote-brigade says that ratting, mining and most other non-PvP play-styles aren't valid in this internet spaceship submarine simulator Eve: Online so delete this please.
---
Me using another PC and back account says hello.
---
You'll never win the fight with 0 alt rule.
---
This is the right answer tbh.
---
Let t4s be in lowsec/wh space.
---
Let t5s be okay in nullsec and wh space.

---
irssi ftw.
---
&gt;This basic level of chemistry and physics.
---
I mean, it's pretty clear that you don't understand it, so why should you expect anyone else to do so?
---
Idk about you but my ideal Eve is a game with good balance between multiple playstyles. It's definitely not a farming simulator. If many playstyles aren't viable then only the dominant playstyle keep subbing and playing the game which is where the current stagnation is coming from.
---
The balance is something that is maintained by the game. Nullsec isn't this lawless blank slate which people can do anything they want. Null is actually full of laws and mechanics that ensure the balance. What's the distance of a jump drive? How much farm spawns in a region? What happens in the process of capturing sov? These mechanics arent randomly generated. They ensure a balance between playstyles.
---
If as CCP you give people license to farm safer than hisec as long as they have the largest blob of ships then you disrupt the balance and make people leave and unsub. CCP Did that by allowing empire builders to theoretically stack half of the null in a single region and make farmers virtually immune to attacks. I argue for a change to that.
---
PS: I do krab. I am richer than many of the titan owners in a generic mega empire. Since you derive your Eve sense of worth from what you own, you are mirroring that sentiment as if I want my relative value to be similar to yours, so I must hate the Eve rich. In actuality none of this has anything to do with my lack of ships and assets.
---
if ccp played the game and wanted to make the game interesting they would do this:
---
T4/5 give suspect timers
---
T4/5 lure trig fleets into system 
---
T4/5 activations lower your security 
---
T4/5 get  loot spawn tables fixed so they're good compared to the "safe" T2/3 ( triple frig farming)
---
As if the PvE part is not hard and potentially losing billions to trigs.
---
I think Scotty should have no beard and occasionally wear glasses. He should have an English accent with a slight west country tint. This would give him an air of authority with slight undertones of sheep fucking
---
look for concord offices 
---
it costs some isk tho, maybe the regional marked it stocked with those badges you need.
---
An MCT is too expensive for what it offers. It is better to spend the effort in 15 extra plex and have the advantage of another account than an alt. CCP needs to look into it. I have 13 accounts and only use MCTs for when I need a PI alt trained.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_strike
---
When you only have the damage capabilities of one vehicle versus the damage capabilities of another vehicle with no COC options to utilize a larger or smaller force to maximize damage on a target, the definition as a synonym for a one-shot kill makes no sense. At that point, referring to a volley using all available weapons as an Alpha Strike would be a more accurate use of the term.

---
Well... you've got a few good ideas, and a lot of bad ones.
---
New Players
---
- Overview could use some work. It's one of the reasons everyone called Eve "Spreadsheets in Space".
---
- There are tons and tons of videos out there explaining stuff. Nobody watches them. Or if they do, they try and watch all of them, and get a bunch of conflicting info. What they really need, as you suggested, is to join a teaching Corp and learn by doing.
---
Skills
---
- I agree the Magic 14 are kinda dumb. If they're SO necessary, then why not give them to everyone? But at the same time, Eve used to be a time sink as much as anything else. These days you can Inject your way to glory. But before you had to wait for the SP to build up, which forced you to play slower and learn as you went, while you waited for the ability to get further in life.
---
- Not sure why everyone thinks T2 should be accessible at Level 4 instead of 5. It's only one more level.
---
Cloaking
---
- Cloaking, ah cloaking. Everyone cries about cloaking b/c it's so unfair. Always calling for some extra measure of balance, never admitting that cloaking IS a balance. If you can't stay cloaked, then it's impossible to spy on your neighbors. It's impossible to sneak up on people and stab them in the back. Every game has their version of stealthy Rogues, and cloaky ships are ours. Nobody says "Hey, the Rogue is stealthing too much. His thighs should start to burn after a while if he stays crouched down like that for too long."
---
Wrecks
---
- Why should wrecks have extra HP? Are people shooting your wrecks before you get a chance to loot? It's a pile of scraps left behind after a ship was shot full of holes until it exploded. How much life do you think a floating pile of scrap should have left in it?
---
Interdiction
---
- Shuttles are the most basic ship type, why would Warp Jammers not work on them?
---
Weapons
---
- What if Hybrids, Lasers, and Projectiles all performed the same across the board? And the only difference was ship bonuses. Why does one need to be better than the others?
---
ECM
---
- ECM was an iWin button for small group PvP. Now it's a tool in the arsenal, but it doesn't instantly ruin the game. And no, we shouldn't have self guided Bombs that seek out ECM boats.
---
Warp Stabs
---
- I would get rid of passive Warp Stabs. But I'd add an active module that slowly builds warp strength every cycle until you get free.
---
- - Damn, this is a long list. Lol
---
Sov Null
---
- No, the Blackout is perfect and should remain in place forever. Intel is not free. You shouldn't be able to program bots that know to instantly warp at the first sign of a stranger's name in Local chat. If you want to live out there in Lawless Space, then you'd better be ready, willing, and able to defend it yourself. That means stationing your own guards on the gates. Patrolling your own borders. Watching your own asses. If that means you can't solo as much, and you have to rely on fleet activities so everyone is protected, then good. That's how it should be. The only people crying about Blackout are sissy Care Bears who shouldn't be living in Null in the first place.
---
up in flames eh?  Maybe they focused the laser too well.
---
What. The fuck. Are you talking about? NASA has multiple fires in systems over the decades, plenty of which produced smoke. A vented air system would easily cause jets of fire, and the carbonized remnants would form smoke, it would just act differently than it does under atmo.
---
If you’re referring to NASA balancing the internal air, they were trying to avoid oxygen fueled snap fires like what killed the crew if Apollo 1, but any oxygenated air will support some degree of combustion, and any air oxygenated enough to be livable for humans will support self-sustaining combustion until the air runs out of oxygen.
---
+1. Suspect timers are a dumb mechanic, just limit shit by sec level.
---
No it doesn’t actually. It happens because of liquid oxidizer mixed into the fuel. Internal combustion has nothing to do with it.
---
Sum up in one sentence...  This is what you get with autistic pilots, bringing out rorquals with excavators with no thinking about said autistic pilots, and doing a money grab with skill injectors.  Fucking duh.....
---
"What would an autistic pilot do with this?" should be part of the thought process in keeping this game alive.
---
not the blackout we need, but the blackout we deserve
---
It is a lot and I love it!!!
---
People like to play games. Every game is a kind of "war game".
---
Is that REALLY what we have come to as far as CSM Members?  Holy Fuck, it's like Hilmar thinking he knows what's good for Eve
---
Every game is a kind of a "war game", and people like to play games.
---
Peace is not the natural state. Resources have been spread across the universe so there is no need to alleviate a lack of resources by conquering next door. The moon changes messed things up.
---
are you literally 10?
---
Holy Fuck! get over yourself "Annointed One".... get bigger ships or go play WoW
---
It's also great for reminding you to repair your ship before undocking  :)
---
Nothing wrong with bombers. Learn how to use dictors and destroyer screens.
---
Your Ideal Eve game is any metric as long as it starts with Grrrrrr Gons Hat Gons...
---
actually you can just remove alts and addition accounts and the game fixes itself without nerfing the crap out of a ton of playstles
---
Cringe
---
He clearly doesn't make a video of the boring times when he does get dropped on. If you think he never gets dropped on you need a reality check.
---
ohhh no thats actually not what i meant lol
---
shut up retard
---
Bots could definitely roll holes, as long as you know the mass and variance its not hard. You could even program them to rageroll a c3 static until they find a c3 with no other j-space connections, put a bot scout on the k-space holes, and then run the sleeper sites with bot dominixes.
---
Bro 20 people watched you get outed last night, then somebody wrote you an actual obituary. It's not me convincing myself of anything
---
The excuse I've seen is that it increases armour on one side, making it harder to kill.         
---
The people saying that have no answer to the question of what happens if you just burn to the other side of the ship...
---
this is not the chaos you are looking for
---
Then what is this post...?
---
meh
---
Which would almost be logical, if facing were a thing in the game. If you could turn broadside and take the brunt of the damage on that heavily armored side. Or better yet, if you could turn broadside to shield the smaller ships hiding behind you. But we all know that Eve uses magic bullets that pass through everything to hit their targets. And the ships don't have any strong points or weak points, just hit points.
---
It's an ugly ship, no doubts about it. =)
---
Does anyone have a precise eve time for when this free SP weekend finishes? Am away all today (sunday) but will be back Monday evening, after maintenance. Just need one more day to get last tier of freebies!

2,450,000 SP in that image. ~5 weeks of training time.
---
3 accounts:  (1) primary subcap and dread pilot; (2) utility/industry/fax pilot; (3) super pilot.
---
So what is that, 2.35 mil skill points?
---
Heat, oxygen, and fuel, aka wood or anything that is able to be burned.

I find it hard to believe a dev leaving means you can't work with it anymore. Sure, pos code, but billboards? Surely it can't be that hard. I think they're just being lazy.
---
Thanks for the answers guys! I surely am gonna make my Astero nice now. And I know that I could have stayed with T1 frigates but then again, with more shield, and over all hitpoints i might have a better chance on escaping if from  exploration site with unwanted NPCs. I bought some PLEX (yeah, I actually payed CCP nicely in the past week :P ) so I dont mind loosing it "too much". Nevertheless in order to learn to fly an Astero I think I have to just fly one. Even if it gonna cost me.

---
Read my other reply where I explain it, retard.
---
Yeah but it also only seems to be broken for a couple hours at a time in there. Honestly it’s not so bad, just kinda whatever when it happens.
---
We are talking about fires outside of crew cabins, in space, where there is no air to supply the fire.
---
Like those ideas
---
who care about isk?
---
That's what is called combustion. When you make fire. Oxidizer is just liquid oxygen, something that does not exist in space enough for fires to burn outside the ship, unless supplied by some force.
---
This isn't allowed here, chief.
---
&gt; Nobody in their right mind would ever expect ANY mmo to allow that, so it's a really shit argument.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Solo PVP isn't a new player profession.
---
Other MMOs prevent new players from fighting against experienced players using vastly superior equipment, with relatively rare exceptions in twinking/smurfing and ganking, and there's usually an indicator to tell you whether you're heading into a fight you have no chance of winning in the open world.
---
Other games manage to ease new players into solo PvP.  I'm not saying Eve should as well, but "no one expects other MMOs to help new players in PvP" is so ridiculously off the mark I question whether you've ever seen another MMO.
---
I too post entire novels on reddit
---
A lot of good idea's, just do something as well to make AHAC's great again !
---
Currently I have my main with about 40m SP, thats pretty much a combat pilot. Then I have a second subbed account that mostly does Indy. Well T3 and Rig production mostly.
---
I really like these two:
---
* The security level in nullsec is now organic and will be higher the more NPCs are being killed in the system.
---
* HAW-Guns are now polarized ~~on titans~~
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKie-vgUGdI
---
Then I'd like to ask why you are so adverse balance changes as a concept? Are you ok with citadel mechanics as they are for example? Was the Space AIDS patch that broke up the previous, actual blue doughnut and in part allowed current TAPIrium supremacy a mistake?
---
Shhh, these are actually good ideas. Can't have any of this shit!
---
This SS is after redeeming stuff that was about to expire aka 40 days.
---
ever since horde abandoned them to goons, that was the mindset.
---
Red Frog my dude.
---
You'll always tell this story though
---
#memories
---
Well if we want to get nit-picky..
---
We don't necessarily need to consider a material "fuel" for it to act as a reducer in an oxidation/reduction reaction (burning)--you don't even necessarily need oxygen either. All you need is something that wants to give up electrons badly enough and something that wants to take electrons bad enough. For example you can burn solid metal (fuel) with fluorine gas (oxidizer). 
---
You don't even necessarily need a source of ignition either. For example highly energetic propellants we use for space flight, monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO), combust on contact without an outside source of ignition.
---
It's a spaceships game, but my point is, that things can burn in all kinds of ways you wouldn't expect. That includes in space, you just need the right materials, so who's to say if our internet spaceships have the right materials on them, it's all make believe. But it is possible.
---
What if it was a snub-nosed revolver at 50 yards? Ehh?
---
wormholers REEEEing in 3... 2...1...
---
Then we'll have yet another event to "collect data" to find out why everyone stopped running them. Just like the last time and they will be abandoned again, full circle.
---
Trig's popping out of their holes to cause some extra havoc once in a while following a capsuleer would be kinda nice though. They could fuck with abyss runners as well as anyone waiting on them, or just bolt it for the nearest mining ship or gate and cause some drama.
---
Dude, you are mixing up powercreep with inflation.
---
Let me tell about this little shooting club called NYPD...
---
Black out should have been implemented in the very beginning. It's not realistic whatsoever to have your shit broadcasting non-stop in dangerous space and on top of that it kind of ruins immersion. 
---
Having to actually scan makes the game much more nuanced. With the technology available in Eve there would certainly be an IFF auto-scan feature on ships, so that detracts from the realism a little bit, however.
---
Yeah I was taking about the key binding ones.
---
whats the rule ? this is before my time
---
Fuck off.
---
Naturally. People want what benefits them and dicks their opposition. The community is unwilling to have a discussion and CCP is unwilling to listen even if they were. Spite for one another carries over outside of the game and CCP won't learn from mistakes. As much as I love discussion, I get tired of trying. I don't think I'm the only one on the verge of giving up. People won't change their minds willingly until they hit rock bottom. I'm never optimistic so that's where we're headed. In my eyes.
---
The height of my interest in this game wasn’t Alliance Tournaments, but when they attempted to combine two games into one across different platforms. I’m talking DUST 514. I would like to see more pioneering stuff like that from CCP. That would bring me back in a heart beat.
---
Idk if I agree... plus it is pretty hard to enforce that.
---
i actually thought maybe 50% polarized on dreads would ok... but i didnt want to put wild guesses in there as i wasnt 100% sure what would be best
---
Some of these are good, others are terrible
---
I'll take it for 1b
---
I like how you quoted me at the end and just deliberately misquoted me.
---
Yes, other MMOs don't expect new players to be able kill more experienced and better kitted players.
---
We both agree on that.
---
The only difference is that other MMOs often don't have true open world pvp.
---
But none of them make new players just as capable as older players.
---
Lol
---
You are literally in Jita man. You should be able to get it sold just at the market.
---
Well. Half of Eve is Goons and the other half is Grr Gons. Bound to see a lot of 'selective' drivel all over the place.
---
HAW dreads in wormholes really aren’t used as much outside of ratting, where the massive amount of HP you are already repping won’t really be affected by losing some resists.
---
Perhaps not, but it's still a fight worth having.
---
ReEeEEEEeEeEeee.
---
lol which one did you misread?
---
Man I miss that
---
A SB isn't designed to run an expanded launcher, you need a regular one. Expanded launchers really go on ships with a reduction to launcher cpu.
---
There are ton of fitted pvp ships, I don't wanna strip them them down and lose the rigs =(
---
The polarized one. For whatever reason I didn’t see it say titans at the end
---
This honestly isn’t bad.
---
Did you think about calling the post ''My wishlist to make stuka fleets stronger''
---
That's just standard for Winmatar ships.
---
Sell the rigged ships just the ship and rig.
---
You 6.89b valuation include rigs nobody can actually sell
---
&gt;and much more will login to witness it!
---
You mean into twitch?
---
**Suspect timers will remain gone until the true, endgame and better at killing those ships than you culprit is resolved**
---
So whenever disconnecting and/or server loss doesn't = ship loss
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
Its almost like someone was trying VERY hard to make the cHaOs era as successful as they had imagined it would be.
---
I still vehemently believe that supers should be near untouchable to to subs. So in return, subs should have their own degree of immunity to supers. If they get caught alone then sure. The use of specialised sub capital equipment for killing goliaths is believable to me. But then again. Believability is something that matters heavily to me and not necessarily everybody else. Though I think CCP could learn a lot by taking inspiration from other sci fi universes.
---
Getting rid of them in tact is gonna be hard man. You may need to eat the cost of the rigs to make a clean break.
---
Solid point
---
I dont get it Big Dan
---
Seems I will need to suck down the rig costs =/
---
You are right it seems I will need to suck down the rig costs
---
Some good ideas, some not. Others are halfway to a good idea. Posts worst than this are very common. 
---
I can tell you're a pvp player. If a pve only play went over your suggestions and stuff was revised to be more common ground on a few ideas, you'd be well on your way to being a good CSM candidate.
---
They put some limits on how many of a single ship you could bring
---
seems like someone is forgetting the seven year war or ww0
---
I don't see how what you're saying about Brexit is evidence towards EMH being invalid
---
I think they were worried that if they called it support nobody would want to do it-- probably correctly.
---
Point is. Fire can exist in space. Certain somebody seems to be so vehemently attached to the notion that there is not enough oxygen inside a fictional island sized space ship to make this possible.
---
Yeah, IIRC the old fire+smoke effects were triggered by hitting a certain % of hull, 80% maybe? The new hot/melting effect is triggered by any amount of armour damage and covers more of the ship relative to the % of current armour damage, so they could be combined with a ship venting hot gas/smoke if it has hull damage in addition to the current armour effect.
---
No, cause that would be a lie since there are no changes on the list that would make stuka fleets significantly stronger and every bigger subcap doctrine (so almost all other subcaps) would profit from these changes way more
---
Even if you sell the ship fitted noobe will pay for rigs unless they need exactly yours which is probably not the case.
---
Mind. Blown.
---
That's gamable though.
---
With so many people leaving hardly, tbh i am waiting for my subs to expire and ill wait till end of October to see if the game will be still there.

Someone forgot that game should be **fun** first not annoying before any thing else.

They were made with a philosphy that isn't how they made the rest of the game, and the bandages they've tried to fix it with in many ways haven't solved the issue, and may have made it worse.
---
Inside the spaceship. Not the practically endless void we call space.
---
Thanks for the chemistry lesson but oxidizer doesn’t actually have to be liquid oxygen. It usually is but it can be anything that turns into oxygen under specific conditions.
---
Meanwhile *internal* combustion is combustion that takes place entirely inside an enclosed space. Rockets aren’t *internal* combustion engines.
---
You’re wrong factually on many of your statements here, or only partially correct.
---
Or they just push the stick further down the road.
---
New bigger ships could just fuck everything up even more.
---
 Sure buddy, keep telling yourself that.
---
They have had comments about them a long time.
---
They've been bandaging the issue for a while.
---
Yeah I know. Like I said you can't stop botters. There are plenty of very smart people out there. But it does make it less accessible. And not every Chinese alpha account under the sun has access to infinitely spawning free anomalies. The idea is to discard the belief that we can achieve total victory and instead strive for creative ways to reduce their practicality as much as possible while having minimal negative impact on the remaining community. CCP is very fond of amputating the entire leg with a chainsaw.
---
That sounds really reasonable, the vast majority of it at least.
---
No we are talking about venting gases actually.
---
And there’s lots of fires in space, many of them external where there’s nothing at all. They come from vented gases that have enough oxygen to support combustion, which isn’t a high threshold.
---
Wormhole gens should be tied to strategic index. But otherwise yeah.
---
Add:
---
Low power Citadels have no damage cap or RF timers.
---
+25m/s base speed for the ahavs
---
There was never an actual blue donut. I think current iteration of Citadels was not implemented properly, however, I also believe that kneejerk reactions by the devs are always bad.
---
There are areas that to me are fine, but small gang folks hate, and vice versa when it comes to balance.
---
It's not inside the spaceship if there's a big fuck off hole in the side of your bedroom.
---
i think you suffer from the calimero complex
---
AKA Someone buy my shit that isn't selling plz
---
I was expecting some bs, but there's some really good ideas in here. Like be actually compromises on Asset Safety in a way that everyone can live with.
---
I'm surprised you're even on here talking to us, since you have CCP's ear now.  
---
Or maybe you're still on Reddit as a favour to us?
---
&gt;Lures trigs into system
---
And jita was never the same again
---
Valid points TBH. Multibox Rorqing seems to be the only viable way for an alliance or coalition to grow. Seems kinda limited.
---
CCP: Too complicated, lets instead nerf something to force people to buy more skill injectors.
---
CCP destroyed by kid logic.
---
From my side: I was always switching between 2-3 games during the week: some Eve, some shooters, some HOMM 3 :)
---
But I never had PS3, and it was a huge disappointment for me to be not able to even try Dust 514...
---
I'd like to play Eve shooter between Eve sessions, but that damn exclusivity didn't allowed me to.
---
It would be a good idea to revive it for PC players.
---
why? pvp dreads are cap gun fit, and krabbing with sneks is easier and cheaper than dreads...
---
Everyone enjoys things in their own way. I personally have no use for reddit but understand its usefulness in getting your name out there. Most of the time though its getting your name out in a negative way.
---
Daymmm, there's more salt generated here out of Imperium Krabs than spod mined in Delve.
---
Keep on chugging Olmeca.
---
Wrong. An Alliance can only field one team. CCP has only recently expanded the number of entries allowed, it is still limited however.
---
i was gonna make a snarky comment but these are actually p reasonable. +1
---
I'll add to it. wormhole anomalies are now finite and dont respawn in that system for one week.
---
Some idiot asking other people to give him the answers. We get this every few months. It's like they don't know how to use the search function, therefore, they don't deserve a degree.
---
The the air would have had left the said opened container at the speed of around 322 meters per second, aka the speed of sound (it would be a bit different under given conditions though), thus ending said combustion.
---
few months ago your vendetta was against nullsec burners. now it's wormholer blue loot. 
---
:thinking:
---
Structure damage has the onboard lights begin flickering, intensifying as structure drops.
---
A nice compilation of some of the better ideas I have heard about.
---
It should be fun!
---
But please, do not revive Abaddon fleets :)
---
No, I believe this post is what most would call "research".
---
I feel your pain, before i got my pc and was able to plae eve online truely, i played on my ps3 or xbox but was always restricted to disk and having to go to stores. So when i looked through the ps3 and seen DUST514 and seen that it was a part of eve, i got hooked to it, and always wanted to play eve, but never could for years till 3 years ago
---
Jeebles, how do you fund all that?
---
Scam.
---
&gt; a LOT less people are bringing out their Rorquals
---
The difference is in Rorquals downgrading from Excavators to Tech 2 drones, which just about halves their mining yield. With how expensive excavators are and how easy SB's can pick off excavators it's a big gamble on whether they live long enough to pay back their cost. Tech 2 mining drones pay for themselves in under an hour.
---
Losing all resists is a bit more than losing some.
---
Yeah I was talking about the key binding ones. The ones as part of the "shortcuts" tab
---
The best is trying to unsubscribe one only removes one account and not all.
---
CCP breaking shit as usual nothing to see here
---
If that was what caused them to quit then my point stands. Their actions speak for themselves.
---
Oh no, trust me i hate what burners did to NPC null.        
---
But fact is that if a small group a players can out perform the 'biggest ratting coalition ingame' .... like what else you need to see that something is wrong.             
---
Blue loot is broken and it need to be fixed.        
---
CCP have all data - they can see where is the most generated and what is the issue.            
---
Maybe there is no issue - who knows, maybe there is actually like 10.000 people farming this blue loot and it is not like 200-400 people having bigger part in this isk generation.
---
Good. Time to resub my 7,335 toons I unsubbed when they killed my krab lyfe. 
---
REeEeEeEeE
---
I think part of the fluctuating security would be a natural decrease in profits from the sites that populate it. The idea being that you're scaring away/killing the pirates or mining all the currently available ore - until rats/people coming back "discover" more belts or "repopulate" their strongholds
---
I think the observatories would need to have 1 timer like the other flex structures. Otherwise you end up having them killed daily outside of your time zone. That would be fine I guess for entities large enough to absorb 500m per day per system.. but would end up being a very expensive cost of living for anyone below a certain threshold.
---
Olmeca and Hilmar.
---
Hilmar and Olmeca.
---
Olmeca IS Hilmar!
---
*Violently Retches*
---
Man, don't be upset. Just GIFT the ships to me, and I will have this headache instead of you!  :)  :) 
---
I'm always ready to help people :)
---
Strip fittings and just sell the ships with rigs for a little over hull price. I had to do that with an orca a while back
---
What a load of shit. Keep those nullseccers in her vote brigading like you think that's going to make a difference.
---
Or you do frigate sites in a 65m hawk
---
Make the unachor on then 45 minutes so it's NBD to take them down when your done for the day but still no timers
---
That's fine but it doesnt fix the issue, right now 0.0 is going to be way less safe than wormholes with the upcoming cyno changes. 
---
 Yet there is not increase in isk making potential from the increased danger. People are even advocating nerfing the isk potential. When you have a group of players that work hard to make the most out of their area with empire building suddenly not seeing any point in continuing doing that the who game suffers. 
---
If krabs in delve dry up so does all the content for roaming gangs. Perhaps you should find other ways of solving the problem than fucking over null sec I.E your biggest player base.
---
Huge props to people who bling the fuck out of ships that rarely get that kind of treatment
---
Curious though that he has basically an empty killboard aside from two Rorqual kills
---
but why?
---
The only thing I liked about nullsec was the deep rooted Us v. Them attitude, and they took that away entirely with the last few nonsensical patches and its just heart breaking to watch.
---
How about this you can see how many people are in local but not who is in local and its delayed by 10 min. 5 min if your system.
---
Make D-scan auto (cycles every 5 seconds) and the range of d-scan is based on ship type and role. (no longer hard fixed at 14.3 au) maybe introduce mods and rigs that effect d-scan range and cycle time)
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2115407043/
---
p2w!
---
One of the better ideas I've heard actually. Well done OP.
---
1100
---
You can use clone soldier tags to get your sec status up.
---
i had 30min on my list but yes both works fine... long enough so it can quickly be saved from a roaming gang but short enough so its not the end of the world to take down at the end of the day
---
Because they refuse to even try and implement an anti-cheat, and the anti-cheat team is ridiculously understaffed which results in everything being a judgement call resulting in false positives, and its easier to wrongfully ban someone for three days and then let them back in automatically then it is for them to perma ban and then have to re-investigate later.
---
Loot fairy said yes.
---
The thing you're missing is that only t2 weapons benefit from specialization skills and t2 ammo.
---
In terms of mods though, everything is a game of marginal benefits.
---
there is no reason to log in to watch it at all... i wouldnt log in, if we would have nice pvp streams, but 90% of all streams are carebears...
---
ok yes strat index maybe... but atm its military index which leads to the problem that wherever you have a high military index you dont want wormholes to spawn
---
with this change it could give use to otherwise useless systems
---
Its like you've never even heard of sov bills, or Ihub upgrades, or well anything to do with living in sov null and building and own titans or supers. This shit ain't free.
---
just in time for cyno changes :joy:
---
An inconvenient truth they will just ignore because it doesn't benefit their point of view.
---
Does ccp reimburse loses when you spammed the dock button after a fight on a station at 1000 meter range? My aggression timer was over and nothing happend about 60s till I died in my BS. Spammed the dock button like an idiot.
---
Nah, put up a new astrahus every time a new wormhole opens that points to it.
---
Eventually you'll have an astrahus for every new one that pops up ready to go
---
The idea isnt to nerf isk making really. If anything id say there will be more "good" ratting systems in most regions. The low security status once wont really be in deadend pockets in the arse end of nowhere but most likely on the edge to lowsec on a pipe.
---
Yeah I did that but I didn’t really get how it worked so I’d just warp to districts and hope there was a battle going on lol
---
thank you kindly. The area of space would be devoid of any permanent structures so no citadels and no pos as they would be destroyed by the environment they are in. It would almost be like 0.0 was when eve was 1st introduced before any kind of sov and player owned structures.
---
eve 2k19: bragging about killing drones
---
Your logic doesn't add up. It appears you just demonstrated quite effectively how bad of an idea excavator mining is in the blackout. Why would you think that makes them more valuable?
---
If anything this will make T2 drones more in demand.
---
Why would it lower your security status? Concord wants the trigs destroyed.
---
prior to the last few changes, I could hop in my stealth bomber and with a short cruise through the drone regions or winterco space I could find THOUSANDS of people out mining, ratting, hauling or doing PI to try and hunt and kill. Now I'm lucky if I can find a single target in a few hours of hunting in what are now mostly empty regions. They didn't just kill isk printing, they have out right murdered the solo nullsec hunter style of play.
---
plslogin
---
So, you jump from discussing titans to sov and ihubs? And again you're aware that you don't need any of those for the upkeep of a titan or to keep him safe in a keepstar.
---
This should be its own thread.
---
Well there is also the option of not using an observatory in the first place since its just speeding up the local and nothing else. Nobody would ever touch an observatory if it had timers and especially roaming gangs wont waste their time.
---
well do it in Vagas? let their gaming commission figure our the logistics.
---
I never played Dust... I wanted to. Its existence was one of the things that got me interested in Eve. Eve had everything....including an FPS game crossover that interacts with its original game world? Wow guys, Eve is really cool! 
---
But....a console only companion to a PC only game wtf? I swear somebody at CCP was smoking PCP that day.
---
Krabbing with dreads is wayyyyyyy quicker and easier, I can clear a c5 site in 10 mins easily. Leaving more time to actually do enjoyable stuff (PvP)
---
Suspect timers would be fine if I didnt loose 12 billion in the last month to disconnects in trig space. It would be fine if you couldn't get fucked by RNG and get a spawn of 20 nueting cruisers. Or 25 weapon damping frigates. That's another reason to loose billions. 
---
Then I have to worry about some jack ass wanting an easy kill on ship that isnt fit for pvp because you cant do t4/t5s reliably with a pvp fit.
---
There literally is a benefit to circumcision.
---
Easier hygiene. Circumcision makes it simpler to wash the penis. However, boys with uncircumcised penises can be taught to wash regularly beneath the foreskin.
---
Decreased risk of urinary tract infections. The risk of urinary tract infections in males is low, but these infections are more common in uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later.
---
Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections.Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.
---
Prevention of penile problems. Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.
---
Decreased risk of penile cancer. Although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men. In addition, cervical cancer is less common in the female sexual partners of circumcised men.
---
This is why you won't be a doctor.
---
Yeah but also prevents someone from taking a single system then slamming a WH gen in to max.
---
" And again you're aware that you don't need any of those for the upkeep of a titan or to keep him safe in a keepstar. "  
---
Do you even know how building supercaps works? And yeah I dare you to drop a keepstar in a system you can't cyno jam and put a super/titan in it and see how long it takes someone to come reff it. You ignoring the entire process involved in getting a titan because it doesn't benefit your argument.
---
I have a lot of alts  because I was a capital pilot before citadels were a thing.
---
hey guys, a room full of people didn't really laugh at me last night.
---
honest.
---
yes we will just ignore asia to make you look like you have a point
---
Not seeing how the proposed changes would lead to that. If we are changes fighters agian who about we fix fighter tracking so fighters can hit stealth bombers.
---
HAW dreads would literally never be used and would be useless, they’re fun when people solo in them for both the person soloing and people engaging them e.g. this guy who took about a half hour to kill https://zkillboard.com/kill/78625293/
---
Also highclass wormholes would take much longer to farm = less time for PvP and more cancer
---
Not only were the battles random, but once you were on the right district, it'd take 2-5 (cant remember exactly) minutes to connect to the 'satellite', then finally you could target dust players on the ground and fire. 
---
after every salvo you'd have to wait and reconnect to the satellite
---
Those are bots. Can confirm.
---
All of it is this super 3lite hisec group that goes by Hogs Collective too. They're really trashy.
---
If it's a misquote you'll have to elaborate on how what you said is meaningfully different.
---
&gt; But none of them make new players just as capable as older players.
---
In regards to player skill?  Yea, sure.  In regards to mathematics?  Many do something to close the gap or control the number of engagements with 
---
Other MMOs also offer compelling alternatives to solo/small gang PvP, while most of the Eve community agrees krabbing and tidi-fests aren't what make the game worth playing.  It's stupid to put every possible obstacle in front of new players to keep them from engaging in the fun part of the game and then act like you're dumbfounded when you've got a 90% attrition rate.
---
Only if you don't really think about it.
---
For the empire builders, it's simpler to just set up trade relationships for missing resources, rather than try to conquer the entire universe so your group can personally harvest it all.
---
The only way to force conflict based on resources is to eliminate trading.
---
i am not an expert but i am pretty sure the  East India Company (aka india) is in asia and took part in the war
---
If something is worth doing, it already has an incentive. Another is redundant.
---
True. Depends how big the hole is on how much that matters.
---
i of course hate carebears like everyone else, but dont touch my lowclass blue loot, thats all pve i ever do and not even much, cuz i cant be bothered to close 6 connections on some days, would just lead to other peoples having content on me
---
nerf highclass as you like, i dont even go there, there is nothing of importants
---
Hah some of these are not t.bad.
---
1. At least we get stuff out of other citadels (i think you would be surprised)#
---
2. The idea is that half your shit drops (similar to wh space) to give incentive for attackers to go out and find juicy targets
---
3. I think you misunderstood me there tbh. It would be the exact opposite (higher security level meaning worse for ratting obviously).
---
I don't agree with everything on this list, but I agree with most of it.
---
Yeah not only that,  but on a console that was to be outdated in a matter of months due to the release of PS4. Their timing was all bad. Would love to see this type of risk taking again though. I don’t think I’ve seen a company attempt something like that to date...
---
Someone who doesn't understand asset safety and only wants wormhole hunting to be stronger. That is all this list it.
---
You and CCP are just reeeeing at nullsec.
---
You used "No mmo helps people into pvp" when I said "no mmo makes new players good against experienced players."
---
EXTREMELY different ideas.
---
&gt; put every possible obstacle in front of new players to keep them from engaging in the fun part of the game.
---
So just get rid of skills entirely then.
---
Every skill is just a roadblock.
---
We already got rid of training skills and the need for rig skills. Fuck it, we don't need any of them anymore.
---
Could meet halfway and make the first timer 24h vulnerability and if it gets reffed, it's turned off anyway?
---
fancy words, noone cares
---
thanks for your input :)
---
Oh look another "i hate the black out" player.
---
2nd offence is permaban. There used to be a 3-strike rule but it got tightened up on account of CCP finding that botters either stopped after the first warning or were truly unrepentant.
---
Yeah, I mean I totally agree on some points, and mildly agree on the rest. But CCP likes to apply what I call "mallet balance"; a small thing that sticks out, which could be corrected by applying small pliers, just gets whacked with a mallet until the whole house is in ruins.
---
Yes I did misunderstand, but that would also have the benefit of reducing the local delay that you mentioned
---
Never mind tho, I guess I just misunderstood on 2/3. And now that I think about it 1 makes sense, as we’ve seen GSF/ TAPI can just roflstomp any keepstar they want after the glassing of Tribute, having 50% asset safety on those keepstars would be a big buff to them as theirs will never die
---
thank you for your input :)
---
East india company was an extension of the British Navy.
---
Many of these ideas are pretty good. Some are bad.
---
Am so proud of this.
---
where is the bus?
---
Not objectively worse the way that T2 ewar used to be... Doesn't the T2 MWD at least give you a slightly better speed boost? Or slightly reduced sig bloom or cap penalty?
---
Something, something, blackout will fix botting.
---
This. If people don't mine with Excavs as much the price will only go \*down\*, not up. If people are replacing all of them immediately it could make the price go up, but if your assumption that mining in certain areas will drop it won't increase the prices at all.
---
That said, I can't stand how easy it is to bomb miners now. There's virtually no way to stop someone from doing it. The ball has swung \*\*way\*\* too far to the hunter end of the spectrum now with Blackout, and the Cyno changes will only make that worse. Here's a suggestion: Maybe put \*\*SOME\*\* type of limitation on cloak, considering it's one of the only modules in the entire game that uses no capacitor or consumable to operate and can be run literally servers-up to servers-down every single day, with no way to combat it.
---
You can say Crab bucket but you yourself said nullsec has more often than not tried to improve the game. Now the wormholers have finally dragged NS to their level and people are acting all shocked that since everyone wants to fuck with us we decided its best to laugh when they get fucked back. It is stupid to expect NS to be the bigger man as they keep getting fucked on by an incompetent CEO.
---
r/wallstreetbets
---
Who hurt you?
---
Are you me?
---
You're honestly just some moron sperging out on reddit, with some insanely bad ideas formed through cherrypicking stats to suit your rants.
---
pretty sure that still counts considering they owned parts of india and fighting took place in india. But if not the mughal empire surrely counts as a asian entity that took part in an world conflict
---
two accounts, 6 skilled characters, instead of 2 overskilled characters, who can then only be used at two places... you have 3 slots per account, you know? why not use it :D
---
i use 3 in wormhole (scanner, rattle, viator)  
---
1 for pvp  
---
1 for highsec logistics  
---
1 is gonna be fw mission puller
---
Sometimes i wish i would stop using two accounts, but i only play solo and solo pvp is very hard to get, unless you just gank, which isnt pvp. I hate multiaccounts/boxing, i hate PVE, but when i pve i actually do something, even when its boring. Still better then a solo roam of 45min with 1 fight.
---
It's in detorid picking up pandas and taking them back home where they can bot in peace.
---
No confidence
---
not being able to lock something is annoying - like EWAR and shit should totally be able to still be used, but the damage application needs to be gimped
---
Why would you be expecting bs?! :(
---
I call a vote of no confidence on your posting
---
only they have no trust left to trade on with the player base to make them think their fix won;t be just as shitty as the current version of the game.
---
this is full retard, never go full retard man
---
That isn't even remotely true. In no way is alliance space safer than highsec and anyone who repeats that literally doesn't understand the game. Nullsec is constantly working to defend their space and highsec is automatically defended by unstoppable NPC police.
---
Here add this to your post https://fleetcom.space/campaign/wnBsubg5KpfSBdEbY
---
3 sneks are the same clear time as 2 dreads. Of course if you either turbominer it and spam snakes &amp; nestors, or spam dreads its gonna be faster, but lets talk about what reasonable people do.
---
It was over 3mil before i pulled down 1st batch
---
I disagree. Most of the time a haw dreads lands the fight is basically over and people are forced to warp off or never engage. Yes they can be fun for both sides but what people dont see are the fights that never happen sadly.
---
wut
---
Unless you are an Omega customer, your opinion does not matter. If you are Omega the only way to vote no confidence is to remove your subscription. Your opinion now does not matter.
---
I have 7 subbed accounts. Main, 2x dread alts, spy, and then 3 ganking / frigate alts I use for abyss multi boxing. That get extracted + reinfected when the newbie booster expires
---
I already hanged myself several times.
---
The worst problem is that fuckin stupid problem when you cant add any more accounts and need to clean every account already added.
---
No sharn!!! Lets not waste an opportunity to bring something into the game that potentially creates content right away pls!!! ♥
---
The prices have already plummeted for excavs, they were selling for about 350m the other day, I’m sure a lot of the 130+ rorqs affected will be buying new ones
---
It’s not, but it’s also not really any different than before on the bazaar. Just stream lined
---
It's not about being the bigger man, it's about fighting the bigger man, CCP. The Summer of Rage didn't happen because Nullsec willed it, it happened because the community could rally around the idea of CCP not fucking them in the ass, and that encompassed every aspect of the community.
---
By my reckoning, we need a Summer of Rage, or we're going to have an Autumn of Apathy.
---
We did that once (jita riots) and it actually worked, the problem now is Hilmar has convinced himself that we have no idea how to play eve and he has to save us from ourselves by making all the people playing the "Wrong" way quit the game so it can go back to what he thinks eve should be juuuuuust long enough for him to cash his check and go back to being AFK.
---
Great idea!
---
Someone light the cyno for CCP guys, they need to read this!
---
You also passively gain sec status based on the bounties of rats you kill.  It’s not much but if you run combat sites and collect bounties you’ll notice it slowly start to tick up.  The clone soldier tags are the fastest and most direct option though.
---
Unless something changed while I was not playing for that short time, can we also make it so that if you're pointed/scrammed you can't go back through the same fucking jumpgate you just came through?
---
What depends?
---
til ccp is a democracy instead of a company
---
oooh I'm an idiot - I thought that moving your ship would break the tether, didnt realize It didnt, thanks!
---
I find these changes to be rather reasonable and a lot better than most shit that gets suggested in this sub. Wormholer BTW.
---
I actually made myself laugh pretty hard with that response if you dont mind me tooting my own horn
---
Well the same was said about hard knocks... you got any idea how juicy 1DQ would be? Probably worth throwing some dreads at i would think ;)
---
So it goes both ways really. If you want to catch up with the wealth that has been accumulated by certain groups there needs to be a way to take that wealth away (to some degree) too.
---
Sorry, I'm a bit dumb. I thought tethers broke once you started moving, I see what you mean now. Thanks!
---
There is no such thing as "the best" anything in Eve. There is only "the best" in a specific situation.
---
Do you want to get up close and personal? Do you think you'll be able to tank incoming damage while probably being webbed and scrammed? Then go for HAMs. They're short range, but hurt more.
---
Do you want to keep your enemies at a distance? Kiting them along while you throw missiles back over your shoulder? Hopefully staying out of reach of most EW. Then go for HMs.
---
Can someone who understands this shit explain something to me; Why would this whole situation increase the value of ISK as some people seem to think it will?
---
From what I understand; the argument for presence of inflation is hella bots are/were creating hella money through bounties which increases supply of money consequently decreasing its value. Now less money is created and more is leaving because of blackout and increases fees respectively so supply of money should decrease and consequently value of money increases. The "value of money" is measured in buying power, meaning when value of money is low things cost a higher number of money because the value of individual  money bits is less to you have to pile more on there to reach the value of the thing you are buying. So hypothetically things should appear to become cheaper in the sense that the number of money the cost is lower because the value of the individual money bits is higher. But blackout should reasonably also decrease the supply ore, moon ore, deadspace items, faction items and faction ships. Decreasing supply usually means a value increase in those items. So then it sounds like actual value of things should increase while apparent price decreases due to deflation?
---
signed.
---
I enjoyed watching AT tournaments, but never thought it was really good for the overall game until it didn’t happen. 
---
Let me explain: I play Eve on TQ, the single shard server where everything that matters occurs. So much of the AT occurs elsewhere and my perspective is that actually removes content from TQ. Good teams spend hundreds of collective hours on other servers. You cannot see it, you cannot participate in it, and it doesn’t flip a needle towards what occurs on TQ.

I love running into “AT teams” roaming around out in space on TQ. That doesn’t happen very often when the 20-30 people who participate in the AT from each Alliance spend two months not on TQ. I recall with particular fondness having an AT team gang hand me my ass up in LIWW (Fountain) a few years ago. I tried FCing and triple boxing Scimitars against them with a kitchen sink shield fleet. It wasn’t pretty. But it was fun.
---
I also kind of hate the AT ships themselves because the presence or absence of the AT ships often makes the difference in defeat or victory in a given match (not always, but often). I generally dislike having limited edition items in Eve. Or maybe I am just salty that in 2016, I wasted 140b plexing my accounts for a few months instead of buying a Fiend.
---
Additionally, because everything happens elsewhere, the AT feels like watching the playoffs and Super Bowl without seeing the regular season.
---
With all that said, I know there are those who love the AT and it will be a good thing when it comes back next year.
---
Righto, understood. Figured it was something along those lines, just making sure I'm not missing something. Thanks for your input!
---
so to Esoteria?
---
This is a question best suited to our [No stupid questions thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ctx62l/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_august/)
---
Is there a way to lock fps in Eve besides the interval option?
---
You mean minutes right
---
I see what you mean, so I should explain a bit more about what I'm doing. While the stock market does have a lot of data to be analysed, I'm not using that exactly. I'm looking at the FOREX market data (More specifically two different markets; USD/CAD and GBP/USD). Where the US/CAD is the base set and the GBP/USD is what I'm comparing it to. I've used the spot prices for them and then also the futures prices (For 1,3,6 and 12 months) to paint a better picture.
---
While  I do expect some prices to change, there is a "range" in which they need to be. Hence why we use the USD/CAD as a base. We know for a fact that the GBP/USD will fluctuate, but it's rather that the volatility of that specific pair is statistically different when compared to its USD/CAD counterpart. This means that either that pair has always been volatile or it's linked to consumer sentiments. I also have a proxy for the volatility (Using the FTSE implied volatility Index). Anything statistically different than the norm has other purposes and that links to the Brexit announcement. Generally speaking, EMH in whole isn't fully true and there are other things at play because the core assumptions behind the theory are something that we all know is not fully based in Truth. On such assumption is that everyone trading has the same goal (Which we know is not true as some invest in the market for immediate profit while some invest for gradual wealth accumulation).
---
This is one part, the other part is the Behavioural economics to explain some of the inefficiencies we see (As I'm a Behavioural economics student). I'm not saying that Behavioural economics can explain 100% of what we see in the various markets nor am I saying that EMH completely breaks down. I just need more examples of consumer sentiments and their thinking affecting the prices of a good that on a fundamental level has not changed much. 
---
Hope this makes a bit more sense and I do really thank you for your input :)
---
You can't fly decent ships if you don't learn to fly the weaker ships first. You will miss a lot of the potential of the stronger ships because you don't understand why they are stronger.
---
Injectors are created through extracting though lol, can't have one without the other
---
lol. Leave it to an eve player to make it more complex than it really is. I'm just fuckin with ya. I appreciated your post and wasn't part of the downvote gang.
---
It's literally a "bring back local" post with a bunch of other shit thrown in to make it loo like it's not. I thought we were past this point of whining.
---
but stealth bomber gangs bring in player numbers! 
---
lmao EVE is in a recession boiz, time to grab puts
---
THank you:). I was also thinking that these systems would be 7 ly away from any solar systems thus making it impossible for super capitals to reach them.

Ahh... 'tis was a long time ago indeed, that 1% of the playerbase cried so loud that the developers have been jerking them of ever since....
---
I did think about putting "and 50% on dreads" in there but i wasnt sure so i left it out :)
---
your comment makes no sense
---
the last of a civilization... genocided

I agree. Canceling is the only true metric they will care about.

now add a nerf to fighter application on top of that and im happy. just wish other subcap doctrines than gokus would somewhat relevant when supers are on field

delayed local is fine tbh

About a year ago CCP moved chat from a format that has been proven solid for several decades (IRC) hosted on their own servers, to XMPP on AWS.  Apparently CCP needs to hire someone that actually has deployed XMPP to make their shit work because it has been a disaster over a year.  It was often joked that they should just removed local since chat didn't work right anyway.  Here we are now.
---
Maybe listen their latest interviews. They are finally starting to fix the stagnation.
---

I replied to the post above with this, so I'll just reply to it here again. I admit I didn't fully explain what I was doing.
---
No local is better.
---
Hm, maybe they can do some arena stuff, like weekly pvp 2v2 where you can fight for some sweet rewards, like every mmo have. Not just 2v2 it might be 1v1 or big fights like 50v50, that might be cool :)
---
Mostly reasonable, but asset safety is still kind of important and should be prevalent for all non-supercap assets.
---
Remember that there's no feature parity here with stations. You could theoretically get your stuff back by recapturing a station with your stuff in it. If you remove asset safety, this is no longer a thing, and people will absolutely quit the game if they come back to find all their stuff gone.
---
Quality of life should supercede "hardcore sandbox" in this instance.
---
Other than that I'm more or less in favor, though I don't mind constant citadel defenses since the main BS is things like keepstar doomsdays and those can get their own nerf. POS guns can fire at any time too, and those longpoints dont ever turn off unless incapped.
---
Almost like you have no idea how wormhole anoms work... Big thinks.
---
&gt;Easier hygiene.
---
I suggest to cut your ears then: there's dirt which can get behind them. Of course you can be taught to clean them, but who has time for that?
---
&gt;Decreased risk of urinary tract infections.
---
False.
---
&gt;Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections.Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.
---
&gt;Prevention of penile problems. Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis).
---
False. If you get phimosis, you get treated for it.
---
&gt;Decreased risk of penile cancer.
---
&gt;This is why you won't be a doctor.
---
This is why you don't listen to American, Jewish, and Muslim propaganda. These are the main 3 groups which mutilate penises.
---
How do you get to the planet *to* light a cyno?
---
There are numerous articles written by experts. This idiot asks Reddit. I would fail him based solely upon that.
---
Because most suggestion posts are "burn caps and stations to the ground".
---
My my where Do we Start on you?
---
Lets go with "massive cap fleets make null stagnand"
---
Thats a pure NO! for you there. Everyone has cap fleets still goons went north and still test is fighting Winter Co you are just missing the issue in the Same reason as ccp does.
---
Why should we fight is the Real question to ask here.
---
"Maintaing the cap fleet"
---
This actually isnt too bad of an idea it would resolve the issue of every troll has a cap but its too late as those fleets already exist and any changes now would only marginaly harm the big Blocks and punish the small groups.
---
"changing more so real wars will Happen again"
---
Aaaaand another straight NO!
---
The only Thing they are achieving right now is that a metric Ton of veterans will leave without the influx to replace them
---
You ever Heard about already replaced? Well guess what ccp cant say and all the data we have available are proofing this.
---
"never invented caps"
---
Why should we be in null then in the first place?
---
This is what makes null special the massive brawls with cap Support and the ability to create said caps and scaps. Whilst caps can be build in low the standout points for null are the flag with your Name on it and the ability to create and wield the most power full ships in eve if you wanna take that away then enjoy your ls 2.0
---
"your chances of getting destroyed in a -1 System are Zero"
---
Aaaand thats the thrid NO! youre out better luck next time.
---
There is various Situations where rorqs supers and even Titans get killed under the umbrella. People crying are actually just Not trying Hard enough!
---
You know whats coming so why didnt you prepare?
---
You know there is an active umbrella in KE ESO or DELVE still you decided to engage that rorq or super Well knowing you dont have the means to pull this off in the time you have so why are those people helping each other are now the Bad guys?
---
Lets just flip it around and See what happens if random Corp #2000 invades a wormhole.
---
Suprise! HAW dreads Fax machines and pure blob is the answer but somehow null is at fault when they just brought these tactics to the next Level.
---
Tl,Dr git fuckin gud and adopt to what you are trying to Do instead of crying cause your damn pride doesnt allow you to form pacts with other guys!
---
So cancel. Then your opinion is no longer valid and we won't need to hear from you.
---
So bye Felicia.
---
downvoted.
---
It's almost like you don't even know anything about the things you comment on
---
Ohh wait...
---
This will be a good stock response to olmeca cheers
---
This is a list of things that makes people hunting from wormholes stronger and nothing else. 
---
Additionally anyone cheering for the full removal of asset safety doesn't understand player retention. If a player has to leave for a reason and comes back to all their assets being destroyed they will not return to the game. And before you say that is how wormholes work, that is how wormholes have always worked. Nullsec has never worked that way and people have dealt with that. Even in the era of stations there were processes of getting your shit back or selling it for isk to rebuild off.
---
The irony is that intercourse with a man with an anatomically complete penis is more enjoyable for women http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/ohara/
---
They'll get used to it.
---
I have listened to both talking in station interviews and the fanfest home discussion.
---
Except nullsec beats the drums of "CCP THESE CHANGES ARE BAD" and everyone else cheers the demise of nullsec. Its not a group of crabs pulling each other down its a group cutting off their nose to save their face. And now nullsec still beats the drum of bad changes but is more than willing to laugh when the pendulum swings the other way.
---
unstable wormholes...
---
in a way. yes.
---
Right now it's a sellers market -&gt; prices go up
---
Buyers market -&gt; prices go down as the demand is not as much as the supply. The buyers can then dictate a lower price.
---
Theoretically.
---
If you can rat yourself blue in the face you'll don't care if 500plex is 5b ISK. If you cannot rat yourself then even 500m ISK might look like a lot.
---
But it is one HELL of a gamble from CCP!
---
I see you spent the morning at the local kids park again....you really need help man.
---
The problem is, their loot is so shit compared to proper 3 frigate t3 farming.... It's not even worth the extra "risk".
---
Its a good stock response to most of the drama queen posters on this sub tbh
---
That's cool, I have never noticed, but will watch out for it now, thanks!
---
&gt; HAW-Guns are now polarized on titans (0 resists) 
---
Might as well remove them from titans completly, which should have been done in the latest balance patch.
---
Great changes, if CCP implements only 10% of them I would be happy.
---
Did I do it right?
---
Astero won't be as good as a T2 CovOps frigate at straight up explo. The covops can get higher bonuses for scanning and hacking iirc
---
Remeber that this Monument also got introduce with the New wreck Design? 😉
---
Im saying you're telling one of the main FC's of a several thousand member strong null alliance he's just reeeeing at nullsec lmao.
---
It's become something of a running joke on CAS fleets when we go to J5A that there will be the same few people undocking in a HAW dread, regardless of what fleet mix we bring...
---
"*Ah yes, of course we're going to engage that Moros with a dozen dessies/frigs and no logi!* (not)". 
---
Polarising the guns, or bringing the gap between dreads and battleships down would be a nice touch.
---
10/10
---
Remove skill injectors. Get rid of fozzie sov and asset safety. Make all capital ships more expensive to maintain while undocked. Implement an actual delayed local in null and that player count will slowly rise again. Mark my words ...
---
Then probably make them cost like 100 or 250 if they are so easily killed. Maybe a decent isk and ore sink. But easily replaceable while creating content.
---
How is it worth it to dump 100mill on a combo scanner just to use the midslot on a cargo scanner? The combo scanners look shite in stats and the cargo scanner does what, tell you some cans aren't worth hacking? Those are the super easy cans anyway where it's almost impossible to fail the hack. The good cans on the other hands are where a real analyzer would be useful so you fail the hack less, rather than cargo scanning it to see what you just missed out on.
---
1. The Internet goes crazy over huge NS empire battles.
---
2. CCP makes changes that makes NS empires less likely to fight each other
---
3.???
---
4. EVE population increases!
---
It's almost like wormholers dont know anything about the null sec changes they are advocating for.
---
something like battlegrounds in WoW, damn i would play that every day :)
---
All I'm seeing is "Lol we're going to the pre-botting era RIP EVE"
---
Just use nados like everybody else. Jeez.
---
Us vs them, turned into, all of us vs him.
---
64 teams and 10 pilots each but usually more.  
---
Its over 600 participants.
---
No, the chat we had 15 years ago, which was based on now 25 year old IRC code, worked perfectly fine, yet this was deemed derelict for some reason, so they replaced it with a “‘Rock Solid, Massively Scalable, Infinitely Extensible XMPP Server” (their [words](https://www.eveonline.com/article/p4i0qx/new-chat-backend-coming-with-the-march-release) not mine)  Ejabberd solution from AWS in 2018... ever since then EVE has had broken chat, players have gotten skill points gifts to endure it, and now they even tried to make the bug into a feature (the blackout).
---
Gr Gon.
---
I don't think getting rid of fozziesov is a good idea
---
Or asset safety as a whole. They both solved issues that stopped people from playing at all. POS sov was horrid. But both of them need a very very close look, and asset safety should be a bit more punishing and not able to evac an entire super fleet for sure.
---
How bright would the ambient lighting on your ship be if there was no stars within lightyears of the planet. Then again all the light that we see is just simulated by the sensors of our pod (same goes for sound).
---
This is the correct answer.
---
What the OP is actually asking for sounds like “I want NPC’s to guard my exit.”
---
A know a lot of players who voted for him. In lowsec or in small alliances.
---
What would be cool is blocking people from voting for their alliance representatives. To stop the largest groups just pushing in their own spawn by sheer numbers, regardless of their agendas or ability to do anything.

Nice strawman, but you still look like a dumbass that doesn't know anything about spawn mechanics, yet wants to suggest changes to spawn mechanics.
---
&gt;Waaah I can't farm with zero risk 
---
Your comment would be more meaningful if you weren't parroting every reddit echo chamber idiot who posted in the last two months. Its has nothing to do with Zero rsik and everything to do with the incredibly stupid shit that has been tumbling out of hilmar's mouth in one interview after another showing just how little of this game he has played and understands. One of the best one's was when he commented on how much he dislikes warp core stabilizers and thinks they should be removed because there were a mistake, a mod with a mechanic that has been in the game more then 10 years that was expanded to T3C's and certain interceptors is just NOW something he has found out exists and thinks is a bad idea..... He thinks titans are free and don't cost anything to jump/use, He wants to make moving through WH's harder than it already is because somehow in his head he thinks that will generate MORE fights not less. He's open to the concept that losing a ship makes it impossible for you to fly another ship for a short time. He has no clue what he is doing and he thinks throwing the whole  fridge against the wall to see what sticks is the best way to move forward even if it kills the player base. We are getting down to 16-17k people are PRIME TIME in the
---
Assumes wide stance and aggressively points finger.
---
Why are you assuming everyone plays with friends? It doesnt matter if I am in an alliance or corp. I'm mostly solo.
---
U/uwutranslator
---
Not being able to hit anything is also annoying. Isn't that kind of the point? We can do all of these things.
---
"Why"? What schmuck wouldn't understand that tougher hulls, more cpu/power grid, higher top speeds or smaller turning radius are all better? 
---
You're vastly overstating the intellectual aspect. There's barely anything challenging at all about understanding the hows or whys. The difficulty in flying, and where your point still stands, is if you can't fly worth a damn, flying a good ship isn't worth the extra expenditure because a noob in a Hecate will lose to a veteran in a T1 tackle.
---
A lot of people seem to think the Astero is a quick and cheap toy they can fly around. But it's a Faction ship, just like any other. And to really make good use of it, it's gonna need a rather expensive fit. That's why I suggested mostly all T2.
---
The combo scanner does save you a Mid slot. And it performs almost as well as having a T2 scanner of either type. Especially if you have the skills to go along with it. Like I said, not meant for a 1 day old rookie.
---
Yes, the Cargo scanner is for looking inside the containers. Why bother hacking it open to find out it was empty. If you scan it first, you can tell what is in each (if anything) and then hack the ones you want.
---
Yes.
---
Fairly sure he's on record saying Eve is his cash cow to fund his other projects he ran into the ground time after time. Me thinks he doesn't actually care about Eve.
---
Pay me 5b and i'll take it
---
Who the fuck cares what the meme candidate has to say?
---
Yeah but in terms of ratting the base HP the shield booster repairs is enough
---
Sounds a bit like drifter WHs and shattered WHs tbh
---
&gt; Citadel defenses are only active if the citadel itself is being attacked (in repair mode and at least 10% shield missing) 
---
I think we may have talked about this earlier. I thought about it some and maybe instead of only active if attacked, it should only be active when "sieged". Basically just give the citadel a button to activate defenses at a cost. Otherwise, in theory, couldn't attackers just dance around the citadel killing your fleet without any support from the citadel?
---
So defenders should have the option to attack at any time, but a sieged citadel should have drawbacks, such as a very high fuel cost (quadrupled current cost) and maybe offline certain services/functions. Such as:  
---
Astra/Fort/Keep = Market offline
---
EC = invention/manufacturing put on hold for 12-24 hours
---
Refinery = Reprocessing center offline/can't use moon mining laser/beam 
---
Once the citadel is sieged, it has a cool-down period until it can be turned off again, so essentially sieging is only something you want to do when the citadel is in danger, not for when 2 dudes are on grid looking at your undock.
---
it is, it just didn't get enough traction, if you can help spread the word here's the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cv6tni/petition_to_fire_ccp_hilmar_without_a_golden/)
---
still 20k bots left
---
It’s learning stuff like this that keeps me interested in Eve. Thanks for sharing.
---
Fuck off you ignorant pathetic excuse for a wet fart.
---
Also I think it would be neat if the stars had some sort of function other than just a warp beacon.
---
Did you ever use polarized weapons and got shot at by anything?
---
Agreed its too easy to get into but thats Not the fault of any Block thats ccps verry own fault for setting the requirements as they are.
---
I am happy to see that we could agree on something.
---
When did you build your last Titan?
---
This all comes down to what definition you're going with but something that's just involving tiny portions of continents cannot be classified as a world war
---
All ships now deaccelerate from warp in relation to their warpspeeds
---
This is a very hard post to reply to but, to do my best:
---
Tethers solve a problem, so I'm okay with them being kept on high powered structures only.
---
Cloaking, magic 14 and such changes. You have genuinely good ideas here, I hope they gain traction.
---
I think you'd need more than 1 keepstar per NPC null for it to be useable as a mechanic.
---
Most of the capital changes I agree with. They need less EHP overall, but most of that has to do with supers being able to tank a huge fleet until support arrives.
---
Stront timers were pretty annoying when implemented on a POS. I'd suggest introducing a new sort of module that has a form of counterplay to TZ Tanking. I don't have great ideas but maybe adding in an entosis mechanic? Win the nodes and you can change the RF time for a week into something more advantageous.
---
So basically give the victim zero chance of survival? Smart.
---
Tbh I would prefer to try and kill something on grid with an armed keep than try it on a deathstar POS, at least you need a gunner for the keep
---
So less than 1% of Eve.
---
Structures that can't defend themselves would need at least one timer to ensure that the owners have a chance to defend it, a short 10-20 minuet structure timer would be a good way to get fights and to ensure it doesn't need to be continually watched. You would probably also want to make the first RF short so compensate for this and not force an attacking group to shoot a structure for 15 min only to wait an additional 15 just to shoot it again (overall It shouldn't take more then 30 min to destroy an undefended but fueled observatory). 
---
&gt; Cynojammers, Cynobeacons and Jump Bridges have to be anchored at least 500km from other upwell structures   
---
It seems redundant to do both, you could probably just restrict citadel guns and not worry about anchor distance. This would also allow for the strange centenarian of an attacking group defending a structure from it's owners as they shoot a jump-gate. Overall by restricting citadel guns but not increasing the minimum distance for flex structures makes fighting and defending one more complex then just removing structures as a factor altogether. Also, it may be better to change the requirements to unlock the guns from 10% shield to 2.5-5 minuets of shooting the structure worth of damage at the DPS cap. I admit it is just a different way of saying shoot it to x% of it's shield HP before it can shoot back, but measuring the issue in time instead of damage is more useful for looking at the issue.
---
Must have been when I left the sov blob, some 11 months ago.
---
I am glad CCP finally recognizes the real problem, igniring the vocal carebears, whi are clinging to the status quo, autistically screeching and killing the game.
---
Sounds interesting until you find out that goons will kill anything that tries to kill it, good luck sustaining a few thousand dreads so they all don’t get instantly deleted by DDs
---
Well its in nebulae so the light would be luminescent from them
---
so ww1 and ww2 will struggle being called world wars considering the very little if non combat seen in south america. And if i am not mistaken even though multiple countries declared war onyl brazil actually send troops. And combat was only naval. So by your definition that hardly counts
---
About tree fiddy.
---
And now they are swinging to the crying small Gang guys who want a several Billion kill with 0 input? Its a shame that a dev can only react Binary
---
Yes there are a fuckton of issues with null and its meta but this way is the wrong one in the long run
---
And Yeah even if you multibox rorqs it takes some time to get a Titan done you should know this yourself
---
Indeed its half kspace half wormhole mechanics like a hybrid system
---
Because CCP didnt balance them to allow for a diverse meta... We could have arenas if they were given the attention they need. That being said the sandbox needs more attention right now. 
---
Good fights and claiming territory should be one and the same. Less mechanics that enable risk averse playstyles (infinite cloaking, warp stabs, panic, timers, asset safety, in space logout vanishing), resource scarcity to break up umbrellas, low mobility for larger ships, ...the list goes on. 
---
Active piloting of ships and static defenses should be the primary mechanic available for both attackers and defenders. Timers do little but delay conflict and stagnate the game! 
---
Want timezone tanking? Recruit people from other timezones who can hold the line while you can't play. 
---
Smaller groups dont have a way to fight larger groups? Larger structures should have less/no timers. Larger structures provide more functionality and stats than small structures. An entity large enough to anchor big stuff has more available people to actively defend said stuff. It should be a risk and a test of your groups commitment and solidarity to anchor these structures. Large groups should have their power challenged by the game mechanics instead of rewarded with more safety. If your group can't handle maintaining structure under these conditions you don't deserve to.
---
Want asset safety? Don't move your stuff to a dangerous area without thinking!?
---
Want to travel across the cluster at great speed? Use a fast ship and/or wormholes. Cynos should be highly limited (maybe more limited in low sec than null?), there's no reason to allow the largest class of ships the highest mobility.
---
If your group can't downsize to smaller, faster ships/fleets you don't deserve to fight small fast groups.
---
are you quitting eve ????
---
I'd like them to bring it back, but the culture surrounding it got a little gross so I don't blame them for its removal.
---
Titans were supposed to be rare and hard to maintain. Period.
---
They are not fucking caracals.
---
Well since its a planet you can do PI stuff
---
Well a 0 resist titan is killable and therefor potential content. If nobody want to use them with haws anymore thats obviously fine too but at least some crazy people have the option and options are great.
---
go ahead and post the receipt screen shot.
---
Sorry havent seen a fleet of 200 Titans Roaming our Space lateley so cant refer to your Statement.
---
Titans are still an asset most alliances dont use if they are Not Sure that there is below 1% Chance something might get lost
---
This sound like a fun lore explication for introducing new systems or areas with different mechanics. For example something like this would be a more sciencey way of introducing trig pockets then what we currently have (though it might have been a great explication for the current visuals of the pockets).
---
It took me way too long to realize that venture mining and high sec mission running in a Vexor is not a very good way to play.
---
See now your are getting it!
---
The people who sold their controlling shares of CCP get a bonus, which at the time was hilmar and the private investors they had.
---
C1's are a bit rubbish to be honest, OK if you are into Industry building small things. The size of the wormhole restricts you to a DST at most so you wont want to be churning out ships that are to big to fit in one. They don't have a J space static so you end up farming the home hole and the returns on blue loot from a C1 are a bit crap. Also with a high sec static you can get loads of day trippers which is ok for some light PVP but once you pop that N+1 heron or other T1 scanning ship it gets a bit boring. Find a Empty C2 with a good J space static and a low sec or null sec K space static you might make some ISK.

Unfortunately the nature of eve makes streaming pvp ill advised.

man those were good times.

I don't think you have been in too many null regions or have seen Zkill, filtered for titan kills.
---
Lol no.
---
The yardstick is the value of isk to the dollar. That’s what the guy I’m replying to doesn’t get.
---
I think it would be better to get rid of local everywhere, but make cloaks require more capacitor (or charges).    Nerf every aspect of d-scan.  
---
Vary the number of rigs between hull sizes.  No more multipliers, or add in missing diminishing returns and penalties.  Hyperspatials could be a fixed amount instead of a percent.
---
Add in diamond npcs for every faction, and phase out others.  If NPC infrastructure is destroyed, it takes a long time to replace compared to defenders.  Like invasion, NPC factions should always have a couple of core hubs, with peripheral systems.  Buff every npc ship to be the equivalent of a player fit ship for its role.  NPCs will escalate to a mixed fleet hotdrop proportional to infrastructure.
---
He hasn't cared about eve in years, and he still doesn't, the only reason he is getting active is he is afraid that CCP won't hit the mark they need to get him and the other investors his full check for selling the company to PA, once that date passes he'll go right back to being AFK and not talking to players or even playing the game.

oh shit.

yeah chat is just broken again. this isn't intentional.
---
Yes in preparation for the last csm election we might have talked about a few of the points on the list.
---
Not sure if i like drawbacks if the citadel is being attacked. And yes the attacking fleet could "dance" around the grid the same way the defenders could as long as the citadel is not being reinforced seriously. The idea is to bring back station games ofc.
---
I dont think you have read the kills correctly there cause these Titans rareley leave their home regions and have shit on standby.
---
You happened to be in a low Tier drone regions alliance that you dont know how this works?
---
Bots, krabs, miners.           
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
Thank you, I will look into that. Probably need some more skills to use t2
---
You really would have killed yourself one of the other 2 or 3 times they completely reworked titans.
---
You bought one bud, you have to live with all the crazy shit they do to them now, and they *will* change them over and over and over.
---
Never forget the titan roam the night before the removal of the sub capital targeted DD where like 20 PL guys roamed half way around EVE in tracking titans looking for things to shit on.  My last kill was a Raven.
---
Sometimes Titans are worth having, other times you spend 3 years with your titan doing literally fuck all.  Then they give you a whole bunch of aoe shit nobody asked for which is wild and crazy.
---
Just wait it out, it'll come around broken again no matter what they do to them this time.

The current visual dmg actually just uses weapon size and weapon impact direction. You could enter hull with only one tiny hole on your battleship if you were getting shot by a light railgun and your ships were both stopped.

If 6 large blasters volley you it generally covers half your ship with the damage effect.

I can support these changes. strontium armor timer made me gasp in how much sense it makes :D
---
When everyone uses an alt for their Titan pilot anyway, this just means you’d make a holding Corp for each Titan.

Ah, just better scan bonuses then. Still better for outright explo

T4s and T5s are already pretty risky, what are you trying to solve with that? It sounds like you want easy pvp where you play with the advantage. Also remember others can't defend someone who is suspect. So it's completely out of bound in terms of fairness.

the more you'll find that actually happening even more and as you think about that and realize I'm right, why not try now? Just because.

Observatories proposal needs some work. Maybe combine them with an ESS-like mechanic? Defender gets better local but in exchange attacker gets a genuine target if the defender just runs and hides. Obviously don't just copy&amp;paste the current ESS mechanic that's exploitable as fuck. Also anti cloaky-camper functionality, please?
---
Only 50% asset safety is too punishing. With such a high rate of loss you force people who need a break for any reason to invest significant time and energy making sure that their assets are safe, either by liquidating them locally or by shipping them to a npc station. Or they come back and suddenly are 50% asset poorer. In any case the change only increases frustration and tedium. It's hard to estimate how badly this would affect people and groups, but I wouldn't be surprised to see less EVE-winners coming back and small to medium sized groups effectively stage out of NPC null/lowsec stations because of this when they would normally have a normal sov-null staging. Do we want that? Seems to me a step back from occupancy sov. 
---
Personally I would like to see a 10% drop chance for every single item in the structure instead of the ISK ransom (or maybe in addition?). That way you incentivize the killing of structures and don't alienate veterans coming back to half-empty hangars. Or hell not even just veterans, also losers in an eviction that now really need to step up their evacuation game, taking away man hours that could be spent on fighting to the last.
---
Or just remove asset safety for supers only and leave the rest as is. 10% ISK ransom and a 18 day access-restriction is punishment enough. Go play in wormholes if you want a more punishing experience.
---
Polarized HAW-Guns on titans are stupid. The goal shouldn't be to penalize fits to the point of irrelevancy but rather give them a honest place in the meta - or remove them outright. They are not a huge priority in my opinion either. I would rather wait to see how the cyno changes affect the use of capitals in general before doing any more nerfs to capitals/supers.
---
Cynojammers need a lot more work than just pushing them a little further away from structures.
---
Your last point about fighter cooldown is just pedantic. What you actually seem to want is a cooldown increase but you frame it as some sort of bugfix. Why?
---
This is the part that makes me smile.
---
And they cost peanuts when they explode
---
I do run webs. You come out nearly in jump range when going through, making it nearly impossible to kill anything that you can't insta-blap.

You know what you get when your only sources are published experts? Echo chambers that become disconnected from reality.

---
Yeah does seem like a dick move that goons got 2+ years of supercap umbrella and when Panfam finally go to try, CCP nerf cynos :D
---
Removing the magic 14 and reducing requirements for hacs isn't going to happen nor should it. New players not doing stuff isn't because of the magic 14. The game grew fine with learning skills for god's sake, the 14 argument is a red herring.
---
You seen to be missing one thing. Jita 4-4 Caldari Navy assembly is self destructed and all assess contained within are destroyed, no asset safety net.
---
HAW guns polarizing titans sounds hilarious. +1
---
That would literally just make people stop using caps. They have been nerfed into fucking oblivion especially after the cyno changes. Maybe and just maybe you could have arguments for supers and tits to be nerfed but carriers need a major buff.
---
Correct me if im wrong, but arent citadels considered force multipliers for a fight? So an attacking force could just not shoot the citadel to remove it as an obstacle during the fight and wipe out the dedending subcap/capital fleet, then reinforce the citadel at leisure (at least on the initial timer).
---
The drawbacks would have largely no effect to actual fights though. No one would be mining/reprocessing/marketing (hopefully) during a critical engagement. I would expect the defenders would have fleet ships already made in preperation so replacements can be grabbed from contracts/fleet hangar instead of needing to build off the market. The only drawback would be increased fuel consumption, which could be less severe than what i proposed.
---
The purpose is to not have people activate seige on every little thing that shows up on their grid. If they do, they are punished for it. But also not remove a citadel as a force multiplier in fleet fights by just ignoring it until the defending fleet has been pushed off/destroyed.
---
"The security level in nullsec is now organic and will be higher the more NPCs are being killed in the system.". How is this not in the game already? It's an excellent idea

As if doctors weren't ever wrong.
---
I like it all except for the delayed local. I’d prefer to see no local be the standard at all times. 
---
But if CCP does introduce Observatories, I hope they are at least this vulnerable to roaming gangs and don’t offer a complete intelligence picture on their own.
---
So, you want someone that gets caught to have zero chance of gate crashing? Ever. ?
---
Hold my JavaScript...
---
Then with that logic, why should it give a suspect timer?
---
3 frigate t5 farming is not that risky...
---
All ideas are shitty, because they're enacted by the actions of EVE players.
---
&gt; But then again. Believability is something that matters heavily to me and not necessarily everybody else.
---
I think that game balance should be paramount at this time. They have gone for believability for a while at this point and it's hurt the game imo.
---
This idea isnt shitty at all because it is actually a fact!
---
Blue loot isn't an issue for ccp because it moves isk between players, it's not adding more ISK into the game. VNI / Carrier / Super ratting adds more isk into the game through bounty payouts which led to inflation.
---
When CCP started dropping Geckos rarely in some event missions (A time limited event), the market in those tanked because people overreacted to what they thought was going to be a flood of these items to the market, even though there was no evidence of this.
---
or make it have a 1-4hr timer, forces control of the battlefield or a enables an organized defense.
---
You talk about a lack of insight, and then go to great lengths to justify the proliferation of titans and the affect that the goal of flying titans has on new players, but I don't believe that your argument demonstrates a lack of insight on CCP's part.   
---
I also believe that CCP need to do more to listen to veteran players, and I've been very encouraged by the fact that the large majority of veterans are very supportive of the changes. I don't think I know a single pre-2010 player who is anything but enthusiastic about the change in direction, even if there is some disagreement over the details.   
---
I think your very long winded post shows a very clear lack of appreciate of game design. Yes titans a great, yes they cost a lot and yes, the dream of one day flying a titan does attract players to the game. However a game in which everyone could own a titan, and keepstar grid fights just come down to n+1 titans is not a healthy game.   
---
Capitals and super-capitals in their initial implementation were always designed to be center pieces for fleets, flagships that played a supporting role but were not the main force. We are at a point now where in many cases titans have usurped the role that battleships were designed to play. Titans are used as mainline ships for contesting structures, titans are used for killing npcs, titans are used as a response to a small group of roaming subcapitals. A change to how titans are used does not mean that large scale fleet fights will no longer be a thing. I guess you're a relatively new"veteran" or you'd remember the many years where large fleet fights did not involve capitals at all.   
---
Unfortunately your long analysis is lacking in important insights, and while it does a good job of addressing the personal economics of a titan to a single player and the potential affect titans have on new players, it also completely neglects the role of the titan in the game as a whole and what might constitute good game design and a healthy role for the titan to fill long term.
---
Pando &gt; Hilmar. Some great ideas there. If only...
---
Your ratting fits have 4x the rep power required?
---
? not really.
---
Agree with it all pando. Let you and me just continue to cause havoc
---
Lost me with the “blackout ends and delayed local”
---
Maybe more drifters and NPC vs NPC action will increase population guys...
---
Iirc they did this when they made the warp changes and ceptors and other really fast warping stuff basically just appeared on grid because of how hot they came in.
---
Lot of good idea here are my views and/or counter views/ideas
---
"Blackout ends but local is forever changed. The local counter is back but the system takes up to 5 minutes to recognize who is in system (30 seconds per -0.1 security level)."
---
Coiunter yes who is in system no but see next point.
---
"Observatories are being introduced. If onlined in your own space the local delay will be cut in half. They can not be anchored within 500km of other upwell structures and can be killed without a timer (15-20 min). Cost should be around 500m."
---
take the who from above 5 minute update no time cut and should cost more.
---
"The security level in nullsec is now organic and will be higher the more NPCs are being killed in the system."
---
i think this is a good idea but pve in null sec needs to be harder but with more rewards and risks and really should be team based.
---
"Citadel defenses are only active if the citadel itself is being attacked (in repair mode and at least 10% shield missing)."
---
i don't fully agree with this but an powered up mode if under attack could be better citadel does 25% if it isn't under attack does 100% under attack and the mode lasts 10-15 minutes
---
"Asset safety is now limited to 50% in nullsec and 75% in lowsec. Only in headquarter citadels asset safety remains at 100%."
---
Who's Headquarter pilots, corp or alliance?  I also don't agree with this i do think asset safty should stay Rl happens and you might not be able to log back in. yes i would put Asset safty in WH space but the cost should be way higher.
---
"If a citadel that you have assets in is getting unanchored or reinforced you will be notified"
---
yes should be this way also service modules should have a power down time so you can arangements you should alsao be notified if it is going into low power and you are a client of a service there i.e clone or industry job
---
"Defenders can only determine what time and not the day a structure comes out of reinforce."
---
I'm more in favour of going back to the older stront style but with say a max of 3-4 days
---
"All citadels only have the initial reinforcement and another structure timer. However Large and X-Large citadels gain an additional Strontium armor timer."
---
x-large structures get 2 timers but has 2 stront timer bays and between both days the reinforcement should last more than 6 days
---
"Cynojammers, Cynobeacons and Jump Bridges have to be anchored at least 500km from other upwell structures"
---
5000km 
---
"Battleships get +0.5AU/s warpspeed and Battlecruisers get +0.25AU/s"
---
i'd like to see faster travel for sub capitals and less time coming out of warp for all ships
---
"Information bonus "Electronic Hardening" now also help against painting"
---
ok why not
---
"wormhole generators or “Quantum Flux Generators” (ihub upgrades) are now active no matter the indexes in system"
---
sure sounds cool, also how about a new wornhole generator module that creates a wornhole could juse the jump portal skill and be a module for black op ships
---
"HAW-Guns are now polarized on titans (0 resists)"
---
i'd be more infavour of 1 of 2 things 
---
titans can't fit HAW or titans get a siege module or there dps is a joke apart from its DD
---
"Dromis and Sirens roles changed to damps and paints instead of point and web."
---
this could be really good 
---
"Fighter MWD cooldown now starts at the end of the cycle instead of the beginning (20 sec mwd cycle then 60 sec cooldown instead of 20 sec then 40 sec cooldown remaining)"
---
would like to see something like thuis for fight MJD
---
I cant wait to see how the further nerf  titans (SARCASM)....I hope i quit by then cause I know I will be raging like a mfcker knowing how much i worked for mine just for it to be made a hangar paper weight
---

---
Well since its kspace so u can move ur capital around and to engage in pvp and pve.

This MER 12T from blue loot.              
---
In comparison bounties for whole imperium 7.1T (delve, querulous, period basis and fountain together)             
---
All the rats killed in Higsec, lowsec and nullsec injected in comparison 29T.            
---
So from the guy hunting in a corvette to all those ratting suppers and titans we got 29T in bounty aaaaaaaaannnnnnnnddddddd **this 5% or eve population that live in WH generated 12T in blue loot**        
---
Tens of thousands players on one side and well less than a thousand on another.          
---
Do you see the issue?
---
Imo they should pair it with reducing ore amounts in areas with a lot of mining going on, since I could see people just resorting to mining if they couldn’t rat as effectively.

Depending on who you are it broke it for over 5 months. A friend of mine could see anything in chat besides from like 3 characters for that long ccp didn't even know why it could be happening.
---
Sure CONCORD wants the trigs destroyed, but there's a difference between stomping a World Ark class invasion and "who the hell let this Triglavian fleet into a secured area!?"  
---
So unless CCP decides to unleash the roaming Triglavian fleets on the 0.9-1.0 systems because chaos, it would make sense to figure that CONCORD and the local Navies would be actively working to keep the Triglavians OUT of their stronghold systems.
---
Weaker ships are also a lot cheaper to lose. You can buy 100 t1 frigates with 1 bil. Once you have lost all of those you will be a lot better at flying ships.

Or if you really want to learn how to pvp in expensive ships you can go train on SISI.

Jesus christ, spreading this muck is what is causing issues within the sexual-health realm. 
---
Let me make this simple.
---
Not having a foreskin means your penis head receives more air, meaning lesions and abrasions are likely to scab quicker. A foreskin keeps these openings moist, and causes friction, which may reopen or take longer to scab. Your penis head is quite absorbent, the epithelial tissue within your urethra is also quite absorbent. The issue arises when you have an individual that has multiple STIs, having open lesions on your penis makes you far more susceptible to catching further communicable diseases. Whether you have a foreskin or not doesn't matter, your risk is the same as the absorption factor of your tissues are exactly the same. The statistics are simply down to manipulation of data based upon people who already have STIs. 
---
Use a condom if you sleep around. Whether you have a foreskin or not. Not having a foreskin is not going to protect you and spreading this bullshit doesn't help.

Ah yes a man of cultural I see
---
Again, I'll repeat myself, you couldn't gate crash on the old jump bridges. Why the fuck can you on the new ones?
---
He forgot to tell you that C1 are great for PI. You can make some great isk in a P1
---
I wouldn't.
---
Holy...fucking...shit....EVE is so amazing.
---
&gt;OK if you are into Industry building small things
---
C2s are better for industry. Better sites and the possibility of a good second static.
---
agree on the bots but krabs and miners as you put it are still valid players and give hunter targets cos we all know humans make mistakes and those are the ones the hunters get not the bots.
---
Beware you might actually lose some ships in your 100 man bomber fleet.
---
&gt; I didn't say it's not part automated, I'm saying you have a person inside of this system.
---
No point for that, as it combines the issues of the two separated.
---
If you can detect bots by an algorithm, it's very unlikel ya human could add a specific knowledge
---
&gt; ban is to make a player comply with the rules, and you won't achieve that with bots. 
---
Well if a bot stops working once he knows his account is disabled, it works.
---
&gt; we should lose the temporary ban, and have a person make final judgement on the issue, not the machine
---
You can't do that.  Not enough person, too many bots. A human can't get more insight than a detection algorithm can, so it's a waste of manpower.
---
There WILL be false positives, and in those cases the human are needed - but otherwise not. And false positives need to be from persons that have been punished already.
---
Olmeca rambles too much and really needs help at least just putting together a concise statement. 
---
I'm in agreement that there needs to be more destruction, but it has to be implemented in the right way; otherwise, then CCP just risks creating a situation where players simply avoid that obviously risky situation because the risk is not worth the reward. 
---
His comments on the cause of current Supercapital proliferation in the game are short-sighted, as he fully places the blame on multiboxed Rorquals. CCP is the primary culprit, as they have allowed time to work against them - where the production of Supercapitals has continuously outpaced their expectations since when they were first released to the game. As an example, the first Titan, Steve, was finished building before CCP had completed the code for it to be launched from the construction array.  CCP introduced Rorquals with Excavator Drones, despite the CSM being against the idea. Unfortunately, the natural ecosystem for consuming large quantities of minerals is through the production of capitals and supercapitals.  We will all continue to wait on CCP on this matter, until then, adapt for die.
---
i mean, logins are always lower in summer. nothing new there
---
not o mention, we're the one making those ships you like to fly in
---
Agreed.  There is a clear playstyle permeating a number of these suggestions which is not my playstyle but there are a couple of good suggestions in there.
---
I also hope you quit. :)
---
Yes your right (smh I'm agreeing with Stainguy), this blue loot is defacto bounty payments, with an extra step involved but same result adding isk in to the game at a disproportionate rate
---
You're so full of shit.
---
Yeah afaik.
---
Also didn’t they introduce that ‘boom-out-of-fast-ward-effect’ after all these changes aswell?
---
why is he a stock photo?
---
Lowering sec status if activated in highsec or in sight of Concord in lowsec would be a good compromise without needing to leave a trace.
---
If we are lucky maybe our dreads and carriers will get a nerf also. I don't want to use those anymore either.
---
I had 6 omega accts...recently went down to 5.   Looking at going down to 4 if cyno changes effect capitals being put into fights.
---
Rule if thumb is that most eve nerds have about 3 accounts. Plus a gaggle of alpha accounts for various purposes, i dont know many people with less than 3 an i know only a handful with more than 15.
---
Never bring back local.
---
Observatories should have normal reinforcement like citadels but have no damage cap, offer no docking (except for capsules to configure the thing) or tethering, and be the only structure on which cyno beacons and jump bridges can be anchored.
---
Idk. But that is the only reason I posted this because I found that interesting.
---
Yep, once you've hit a good site you have to resist the just-one-more feeling
---
Well, the non-trivial approach would be a material that is required to build a titan/super and limit the total amount of that material in game (same like the Palatine Keepstar can only exist once).  
---
50% chance to salvage it from the wreck of a titan or super, if it doesn't drop a blueprint can appear in any data site (super low chance ofc).  
---
But like Zodiac said: We are faaaaar past the point where this can happen.
---
Ah, yes!  Thanks!  I must have set it to red for some reason a while ago.  Probably during my earlier visits to low/null sec.  (I need to remember to set it to green when I head back into high sec.)
---
I did that today. Waiting on CCP Customer Service for a thing and I'm off eve for the foreseeable future. And no, my stuff went the Brave Dojo already.
---
&gt; Maintaining and defending a capital fleet should be a HUGE investment considering the power they weild. 
---
it really is. thing is, you get megablocs liek GSF, whose organizational structure and leadership, has attracted enough people to where it doesn't seem liek a huge investment, because the load is spread across so many people. doesn't help that panfam only recently pulled their head outta their behind and consolidated.
---
So observatories as a deplorably instead of a structure. That sounds interesting actually. Assuming they cost enough that you are incentivised to defend them and not spam them it could work.
---
Just quit the game please.
---
bye bots
---
God yes, but pls not for t3 cruisers
---
Ha 2 l8 m8
---
bye
---
Nah... there are pretty good ideas out there but CCP decides to take the worst ideas.
---
... In which case what you said was entirely unrelated to what I said originally.  You can't conflate player skill disparities and raw, boring number disparities.  The people less likely to make mistakes should be able to win without relying on having more freedom to make mistakes.  Sounds like it's just a cover for people who aren't any good after playing this game for over a decade.
---
&gt; So just get rid of skills entirely then.
---
&gt; Every skill is just a roadblock.
---
&gt; We already got rid of training skills and the need for rig skills. Fuck it, we don't need any of them anymore.
---
That's not really what I'm talking about, but if it was done well, it would probably improve the game.  The most likely problem is you could now stick everyone in supercapitals and T3s, but if the tiericide did its job you'd have plenty enough reason not to just stick everyone in the biggest, blingiest ships your alliance can afford.  Skills do run directly counter to the idea that Eve is a sandbox, but pure sandbox would probably not make the game better.
---
In line with what I actually said, you can have skills and not make how long one player left his account sit idle be such an enormous factor in his engagement with another player.
---
Eve Is dyong
---
i sunsubsbc
---
Help, I am having a coma
---
Are you talking player stargates or all gates? I think that's the confusion here.
---
If player stargates I agree. 
---
If all stargates then gtfo, gate crashing and agro games are perfectly valid ways to split up gangs, and make for interesting small gang fights. Plus that would be a death sentence for my little bubbly bois.
---
Thank you u/Lil_thott for your submission
---
sorry you're stuck in the panfam nursing home....
---
" boo! hoo! someone changed something on my  16 years old game. now i have to learn and adapt. "
---
man that salt is just delicious.
---
There’s that, but we still manage to kill a HAW dread now and then. On the other hand, when somebody brings a FAX to a small sub cap brawl is when we’ll nope out 100%. I could go either way with HAWs being polarized, but I’d love it if FAXes repping sub caps suffered a sig radius penalty. So full reps to supers and titans, then proportional reduction in repping power as ships get smaller...
---
CCP made the mistake of actually listening to eve players.
---
Look at my posts, they reflect this subreddit, they're all shit and really fucking stupid. 
---
I wouldn't listen to me or anyone on r/eve or the forums.
---
Sometimes I just warp into a system and just think. "goddamn, this looks nice,"
---
I just hate that they took my dank vni content away. My isk making is fine tho. Still make my safe asf 500 mil an hour.
---
I'd like but I need to train Caldari Cruiser V before :(
---
Yeah that’s wrong. 2 dreads can do it in 10 minutes + drifter if you’re good. I doubt 3 snakes come close
---
You know eve has a great lore that could span many a game but these games keep failing.  As ceo he has to take the blame.
---
Dust 514 on the pc i would have played it.  
---
stand alone game based of the eve IP a mass effect mets eve   
---
So much that could have been done but yet each one they putout failed imo
---
Too bad if it takes longer to farm, isn't this whole thing about isk being too easy? So harder everywhere but wormholes is the real goal then, good to know
---
But this could be not a bad thing
---
It's not potential content creation. Anchoring 500m for something that takes 15 minutes to kill isn't a reasonable economic strain.
---
In fact if you improve it like Sharn is suggesting then people will deploy it more, while retaining the reason to attack them. If you're trying to make them artificially scarce then do so with a hard limit that applies to everyone; like a limited range but only being able to deploy one per system, or only X number per constellation.
---
I ironically got the money for my first HAC while I was in S2N in the Delve days, making bets on every match with corpmates. Good times.
---
I'd actually probably come back if AT+Betting came back simply because it'd be a lot easier for me to fund my PvP habit
---

1 char with 2 old chars i dont use anymore but want to keep as "memories" + 1 char that keeps my iron reserve money in case of emergency plus all my collection of random skins, loot, corpses, old ships that i retired and dont fly anymore because killmarks or history or anything. it's practically a mix between a museum and a bank.
---
+ at least 10 scanning accounts with scanner alt chars. more incoming
---
Same here tbh
---
I'd add it to a monthly report, use a weird metric that makes it look outstanding and claim it meets 90% of my annual KPIs.
---
I think most of us are more than welcoming to changing up eve, but the reality is that the 'chaos' they are trying to implement is anything but lackluster. Removing local didn't really solve anything, bots might have hated it but they are adapting. This was already predicted before the removed local.
---
The same can be said for the upcoming cyno changes, yes whalers will be happy on the first month that so many people that shouldn't have caps will feed hard. They will be happy that supers need to invest more, I don't think most of us are against that. The problem arises when CCP makes REALLY lazy changes because they don't want to invest in dev time, or at least I suspect that to be the case. People will then just rorq mine more than rat because ratting just won't be worth it anymore putting aside economics. 
---
What is going to happen next? Nerf rorqs again? For the fourth or fifth time? Nerf everything? These changes are REALLY LAZY of CCP. They know what the real problem is, and that is called injectors. Will they ever address it? Hell no, who cares about the game if it hurts their wallet. 
---
I suppose you could call this wall of text 'salt' but it's actual criticism and I hope that you can respond in kind if you so felt like it. The TLDR is, we want REAL CHANGE, not this lazy bullshit. We all want a fun game not chores.
---
This guy businesses
---
A quality shitpost in a shit of high quality indeed
---
Not worth it lol. There are plenty that are empty
---
Have you been through Detorid, Immensea, Cache or Etherium Reach these last two months at all? There used to be thousands of crabs spread across those regions, now each has 2-3 system with a dozen or so people in them and the rest are a fucking wasteland. The more you post on the topic of recent eve the more you look like a sock puppet for hilmar.
---
Storage and production is fine. 
---
Shitloads of capitals are being built because they have such high dps/click. 
---
Bring back combat refitting. Christ, I can't believe I'm advocating that. Make them require loads more attention and apm to use effectively, and to navigate with.
---
Chaos era can be sumarized to “fuck pve lmao”
---
&gt;I wouldn't listen to me or anyone on r/eve or the forums.
---
unfortunately that's exactly the place Hilmar seems to think all the good ideas are.
---
Oh wow!  A dev reply!  You're very welcome.
---
Considering what I read on these forums, your job may be a little thankless, so I want you to know that I do love this game.  The CCP team has done some great stuff that I enjoy.  Just so you don't get bogged down in what seem like incessant complaints from everyone, here are the things I really like:
---
**Exploration** - So much fun!  I wish the game felt like this all the time.  The hacking minigame is also great!  It feels like my success is guided by my skill, and the risk - even with invisible hunters - is exciting (as opposed to the risk I feel when going through lowsec where everyone wants to murder me!  Not sure why it feels so different.)
---
**Trig Roams &amp; Procedural Events** - This is a new thing I've discovered and love.  The game feels more alive, and I have definitely lost ships to them, including mining pirates in lowsec, which I didn't know was a thing.
---
**SKINS** - I don't know how the rest of the player base feels about these, but I love cosmetics, and giving CCP money to keep this space game without being pay2win (which eve is certainly *not*) is perfectly fine by me.  Police skins for Amarr when?  takemymoney.jpg  
---
**Wormholes in General** - Yes!  These backdoors into the universe are so unique, and I actually like having no local chat, because then people have to actually hunt me down.  It gives me time to do exploration-y things and panic a little on the inside.  I feel so sneaky when I go into wormholes looking for sites; it's the boost I need to take risks.
---
**Depth and Skill-based PvP** - I am so bad at PvP; just the worst.  But damn I love the depth and different ways I can go into a fight.  All the different calculations and subtle things like the ability to fly so fast I can't shoot people effectively is downright amazing.  You can tell everyone.  Shout it from the rooftops.  AMAZING!  Because it's skill-based, I know that I can succeed through hard work and not "gear"/"loot", which only seems to give a slight edge in your favor.
---
Thank you CCP_Falcon.  Thank you to all of the CCP team.  This is one of the greatest games :)
---
I have an idea nerf everything to be worse than a corvette lets make it happen lads the days of corvette mining are close
---
Aren't the player stargates called Jumpgates? That's what I'm referring to.
---
Of course! I like to show my respect to arguments here on r/eve
---
Nice going
---
If you made it have a relatively short deploy &amp; removal time (with, say, an hour cd on removal after initial deployment), couldn't that also work? Basically, if you want to have this thing, you better protect it; if you don't, you oughtn't cry when it dies?
---
If you gonna polarize the titan haws they should atleast get a boost in damage and appliance. No one uses em and for good reasons
---
Won't the POCOs get burnt by the intergalactic radiation?
---
K-Space is the _known_ and explored systems that have had gates built.
---
Then why post lmao
---
I don't think this is a bad thing even. Honestly even if you let supers dock in keepstars but just took away asset safety for supers that'd be an improvement - and I say this as an owner of multiple super hulls.
---
Q:If you die, could a ship be locked and you couldn't fly that ship again?
---
&gt;A:This is one of many mechanics we could look at.
---
Why would you ever want this?
---
Because this is my enjoyment now. Not all of us could be a part of elite alliances.
---
Sorry, I left just after they were introduced and came back pretty recently. Didnt realise what they were properly called, we still call them jump bridges.
---
Because they would literally be making less than the local gas station located too far off the highway for anyone to even bother finding it for gas.
---
&gt;"Big fights are won by the side who has the most rorqual multiboxers" 
---
I'm fuckin' rolling.
---
It would hurt their bottom line.
---
I'd like to know what the evidence on both sides of the argument looks like.  What suggests 200-400 players and what suggests 10,000 players?
---
The idea sounds cool but I don’t like the idea of cynos. Some mega-alliance will just find the place and bring caps in then camp it. Log off caps in there or something. Wormholes only, subcaps only, then we’re talking
---
I haven't undocked in a week. Losing 1.1billion in ratting ships that haven't paid for themselves makes me not want to rat. I really tried to give eve the benefit of the doubt but sadly unless things change I'm gonna be going back on hiatus. Didnt even last a month before ccp drove me back out.
---
SLOPS FOR THE SLOPE GOD
---
Oxygen isn’t the only catalyst, things can still burn without it.
---
No, you.
---
No worries at all mate!
---
Yeah, its that darn summer slump that started in January this year... followed by those darn kids going back to school slump. Let us not also forget the slump from the winter holidays.
---
That would be mitigated by less people running  then
---
Congrats. Good work.
---
Yea, I guess it's easy to fall into that trap. I fully understand that they probably have the best intentions for the game. Seriously. But maybe they should get some hearing protection before listening to us :/
---
Can you please help me out, so if I have multi char for my second char for training and my main char  subscription finishes does my my 2 char continues training within the same account.
---
Yeah, they should make it an endgame PvE challenge that requires a super or a well composed fleet to do, kinda like raids in WoW or something.
---
Not that we don’t have lategame PvE options, but I don’t think they’ve ever been a draw factor for new players, and something like this might be.
---
Oxygen isn’t the only catalyst for combustion, fluorine and chlorine work as well.
---
thats the thing you cant do that in this space... as if you leave your ship there too long it will die due to the radiation... so you cant just perma log off fleets there for camping... maybe max like a week before you have to leave and then come back.
---
more over one of the effects could be that after a while the system will disappear and then you have to find a new one... so they are not fixed and will go away .
---
What do you think is going to happen when eves players stop mining in null? Cuase tv hats happening right now. My corp is mostly pve. We have over a 100 players spread over a good 600 tunes. The amount of us I have seen online since black out is appalling. Used to be 60 of us on at any time. Now I'm lucky to see 20 of us. We arent mining. Lot of people arent mining. Eventually the stock pile of minerals people have built up over the years is going to run out. And when it does destruction is going to outpace creation by a significant amount. The economy relies on the indy players in null. Players who either arent logging in or arent undocking. Players who are very unhappy about these recent change. Ccp has two options. End black out or witness the death of the player driven economy.
---
Wow it's just like the real world inflation everywhere. It is shit I know but just think of it as them making it more realistic
---
yup you got to launch it with out them. would be neat if they added PI for the moons too that way would could get some fast tech II components.
---
No one here is arguing that inflation is inherently bad. But 20-30%/yr inflation is **not** healthy for the game.
---
Neither do noob astero pilots.
---
Nice, thanks jin and olmeca
---
Hope the summit is productive :)
---
Nanofag is the term you are looking for
---
I wish I got as much hate as you did ;-; I wanna become a bad guy!
---
I'm fukin contacting CODE. to be allowed to sell salt mining permits.
---
&gt;you like to fly in
---
Lose
---
eeddfsf and sjdfuisf, classic eve players!
---
In other games cloak/stealth has a direct counter either in the form of a decloak like flare in world of warcraft of a short duration with a cooldown in many fps with cloaks. 
---
Or another option increase the decloak range or otherwise make it possible to lock cloaked ships from a longer range than decloaking them, like how overwatch balances cloak.
---
No matter what tho in these other games you cannot get the best value out of cloak by sitting cloaked up in one spot for hours waiting for the the best target of opportunity.
---
Congratulations fren.
---
He Killed my cat! I saw him multiboxing whilst he did it!
---
Ah I didn’t understand you meant it would affect logged off ships as well.
---
The big thing is just making sure it doesn’t become just another mega-alliance crab-box. They have enough of those
---
T2 MWDs are faster and have less cap penalty deactivated.
---
Still mostly meta modules are used since you either need sigbloom, CPU &amp; power or active capacitor usage. You only fit T2 if neither of those is an issue so its mosten times only used in PvE since for PvP you allways take less sigbloom.
---
Also any ship comming  through a wormhole sustains 50% damage to shield and armour and has a 5 min recalibrate time to targeting.
---
Who cares? CCP doesn't get much out of Twitch. They care about how many people log on to EVE.
---
I honestly don't care about the argument or which side is right, you're just a douche. Enjoy the downvotes lmao.
---
Imagine spodbrains stop mining.. naaaah.
---
Sounds like a drifter wh with pve content.
---
Because that's where Concord operates... They have control over all of empire space.
---
It needs to hurt for people to give a shit and undock to defend it tho. If you dont think you can form an defend a 500m structure you dont get to have one :)
---
Congrats &amp; welcome to the club!
---
Err no
---
What's funny is lorewise, Jita apparently ran out of asteroids due to all the mining that went on there xD
---
I know you didn't ask for it but I'm going to provide a fit suitable for hunting explorers. The idea is that you scan and bookmark the sites in a constellation and then wander about until you see someone hacking. NPC null is best but lowsec works too. Of course, you will occasionally get a fight with someone doing the same thing but that just adds to the excitement. The rewards are pretty good:
---
\[Astero, Explorer Hunter\]
---
Small Ancillary Armor Repairer, Nanite Repair Paste
---
5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive
---
Initiated Compact Warp Scrambler
---
Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier
---
Sisters Core Probe Launcher
---
Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I
---
Small Nanobot Accelerator I
---
Nanite Repair Paste x100
---
&gt;wormhole generators or “Quantum Flux Generators” (ihub upgrades) are now active no matter the indexes in system
---
Just because you want easier content for your little bomber fleets as well as safer krabbing for big ol' nullblocs doesn't mean it's a good idea.
---
&gt;The security level in nullsec is now organic and will be higher the more NPCs are being killed in the system.
---
Defeats the point of some systems being worth more than others. 
---
&gt;Defenders can only determine what time and not the day a structure comes out of reinforce.
---
Let's chill with the Chaos memes. Start with low power structures getting this treatment, and move from there. If I want to be able to ensure my defensive timer comes out on a weekend, that's not the worst thing in the world. Although to be perfectly honest, the better solution for low power structures is the reverse. Timer comes out at the time of attack, on the day of the defender's choosing.
---
The entire point of Null is that it is not controlled by the massively populated / wealthy Empires that helped create CONCORD.
---
While it is an easy goal to reach, another important aspect is that it's a desirable goal to reach. 
---
Why is it desirable? I think that's where focus needs to be put.
---
Don't forget jfgjgfkjikl
---
And null pays for that control. You would think they wouldn't want to piss off the guys paying there salaries.  I'm not proposing more Concord in null. I'm just saying what the fuck are we paying Concord for if they aren't even maintaining chat now. why should we pay sov charges when Concord has so little power in null they cant even maintain the comms network. Just having a semi rpg take on blackout
---
I am well aware reread post.
---
\&gt;  Blackout ends but local is forever changed. The local counter is back but the system takes up to 5 minutes to recognize who is in system (30 seconds per -0.1 security level).   
---
They're having a hard time trying to fix chat in the past two years. I really don't know if it's possible for them to modify it slightly and make it work in scale.
---
&gt;the crying small Gang guys who want a several Billion kill with 0 input
---
Point to those people. Name names. 
---
I don't believe they exist. I think you're making up an invisible boogeyman to cast as the enemy.
---
The economy wouldn't die if mining drastically dropped. We would just use less mineral intensive ships.
---
The mineral costs for something like a Carrier are massive compared to a battlecruiser.
---
Interest in the AT can be looked at directly by the viewership gained on twitch. Unless you watch the AT some other way
---
Hrm. A year's worth of experience doing both argues otherwise.
---
Then why are abyssals engineered for  SOLO cruiser running, its instanced so you can just jump in without organising a corp op just so you can run a site.
---
Then you have a years worth of experience running sites wrong
---
Okay bud. A year's worth of running a c5 farmhole with sneks + hobodreading it says otherwise though.
---
Okay.
---
Again, you say it if I care for some internet currency. And yes, I am a douche, because I am disgusted of people's basic lack of coherent thought and understanding of things. Because of ignorant people like you, the planet is dying.
---
You're asking why a national coast guard doesn't go into international waters. They don't have any responsibility over nullsec since that's player owned space and they are run by npc polities to protect npc-owned space.
---
The majority of minerals come from null pve. Without the null miner t2 and t3 doesn't exist. The economy will collapse if mining in null doesnt start back up again. Your faith in eves economy is laudable. But ultimately nieve.if you remove the things that give an economy value such as the back bone of said economy ore trading. That economy will then continue to work until resources start running out and then we have a collapse. If most people could see it coming it would happen. What's baffling to me is most of us do see this coming and are very vocal about it. Yet ccp insists on doubling down rather the fixing the issue.
---
It's all a conspiracy! Concord doesn't care about capsuleers and just want to milk AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE from us!
---
Why don't they prevent ganks?!?! BECAUSE THEY GET MORE MONEY BECAUSE OF MARKET TAXES THAT WAY
---
WAKE UP SHEEPLE
---
jokes aside good point. Maybe there's some sov-holding tech that only Concord has control over and keeps a secret from us capsuleers to have some control over us demi-gods. I have a feeling that if all of null is allied then Empire space stands absolutely no chance against the godlike capsuleers armies.
---
*Sovember
---
IMO it should be like the unfocused jump drive from the X3 games. It would transport you to an uncharted sector where you could find both free loot and horrible death.
---
This could be a wonderful PvE and exploration instance
---
Damn sharo, quick AF
---
TUMBLING DOWN
---
TUMBLING DOOOOWNNN
---
Your missing the point.
---
Null is lawless and relatively sparsely populated compared to the Empires. 
---
Null does not support the Empires, therefore Null does not support CONCORD.
---
Thus when resources are scarce CONCORD ignores Null and focuses on the population centers. That’s pretty damn logical.
---
If the citadel has lost at least 10% of its shield and is in repair mode it would not have any defenses
---
meaning only on the initial reinforcement of the citadel the force multiplier would be missing for the very beginning and after that all timers would have the full force of the citadel
---
if the citadel itself is not being attacked there should/would not be any force multiplier ofc
---
Because its the bfg and people want the bfg so you are about 5 years too late for that the only Thing to fix Titan issues is introduce Titan Killers but thats a massive pita to balance
---
Why wasnt it fit with anything?
---
This has been the biggest spaghetti fiesta I have witnessed since the Pospy eviction.
---
but why? dont tell me you guys are roaming around finding all those great targets/fights since blackout... we could have a middleground that helps everyone and is even better
---
Lore-wise null is absolutely meaningless in the eve economy, just like your shitty opinion
---
this is BEFORE wow classic too
---
Except it's not player owned space. Its player rented space. Null alliamces pays Concord a large sum of money every month to maintain sovereignty over null. That rent was justifiable when Concord maintained fluidrouters and made sure that the person the system owned the system. But now they dont do either of these things. Why should null pay rent? The simple answer is they shpuldnt. So it doesnt make amysense in game for Concord to drop support of the chat beacons.
---
How do you undock and defend it if you are asleep?
---
Sov bills are paid to concord, is his point. So yes they are supported by null.
---
Director-level spy
---
Ohh that sucks for them hahaha!
---
Oh look a troll not contributing to the conversation. I'm just gonna block you kay?
---
We had a functioning economy back when people were jet can mining in battleships.
---
We could easily cut mining 90% and the economy wouldn't "collapse".
---
Of fucking course Sharo gets it

Woah woah woah, slow down.... I don't wanna offend actual fags by grouping them in with these degenerates.
---
SOV bills are likely tiny compared to the cash influx provided by the Empires.
---
And when all the smoke cleared only the smell of cheap vodka, filterless cigarettes and the sight of well over 70 Adidas tracksuits remained. Blyat.
---
i didn't say anything about location of combat. Mughols were a small faction that controlled territories around India, India as a sovereign state did not participate in the seven year war.
---
Brazil as a sovereign state declared war on Germany in 1917 and 1942 which means as a country they are at war.
---
I like a lot of this stuff, but I'm going to go ahead and disagree with anything to do with local. It's purely anecdotal, but today we were trying to run entosis in a bunch of Legacy systems. We had a small jackdaw fleet, and they formed 4 different fleets. It was actually really exciting having to track where they were, and we lost them a few times.
---
I just think it adds a really interesting dynamic to having to actually keep eyes on them rather than automatically knowing who is in system.
---
If you must reintroduce local, I'd actually suggest the opposite of what you have, and make local a function of gates. When someone comes in it's broadcast, and then the person goes away after X time. If you come in through a wormhole or a cyno you won't show up.
---
Then I'd make the Observatory effectively a D-Scan structure that you can anchor that "pings" periodically and shows stuff in a fixed sized radius, so you'd need a few of them in a system.
---
At least 50% of those who complain about umbrellas right in this thread and yes the 2 Main threats to null people right now are other null people and wormholers and while null people aare successful to a certain degree ( Looks at gokus and stukas and Hordes 100% fleets)
---
Wormholers struggle to adopt outside of BB and a small Portion of "high end" wormhole groups ( hk, lazorhawks, inner hell, etc.) most fail to adopt and try to bite bigger then they can chew and thats what a Solid Part of HD content is these days
---
Back when can mining in battleships was a thing the eve economy had a lot less on it. I agree that 10% of the economy will survive. But it still collapsed at that point even itmf it isnt a total collapse. Back in that era t2 was still extremely new or not even out yet. Most of the meta we have today the vast majority of the content on the market will collapse. A tenth of the market isnt enough to support the games pkayerbase.
---
&gt;**INTERDICTION NULLIFICATION**  
---
&gt;Add it to shuttles  
---
&gt;Nerf all Frigates/Interceptors to make it impossible to achieve below a 2.1 second align time.
---
For being so annoyed at CCP letting things fall through the cracks, you not realizing that a lot of ships besides frigates and ceptors can get to insta-warp (some can even go below 1.0 second align time) is amusing.
---
Congratulations on killing a Faction Fortizar.
---
And the empires have a seat in the inner council. Why should we be paying concord if they don't provide anything to us?
---
It would change. Thats not the same as collapsing.
---
 Cynojammers have to be anchored at least 500km from other Upwell structures.
---
And the gates are operated by the empires.
---
If ccp doesnt undo the changes they have to remove Concord sov. Yachts what in wanna see. I want null to be completely independent if Concord isnt doing anything for us.
---
By this logic it would also be fair to let asian and african economy realease co2 unrestrained for another 70 years because the west did it for that period before they've been able to
---
It was interesting to listen to.
---
I can assure you that you're probably the last one to catch on.  
---
This was a satirical post
---
I was just about to post this... insane to watch.

Battle Report
---
They were all handguns - bunch of different goons using a bunch of different guns - we all got to try all the different ones :D Was a ton of fun.
---
Doctor CAN be wrong. You ARE wrong. You see the difference. Moron.
---
There is lots of content in Eve which doesn’t require a gang to run, but which requires friends to do safely.
---
Welcome back to the action paced game called eve online. Stay as long as you wish.
---
As said elsewhere, bunch of different goons with different handguns, all sorts of experience levels and skills :)
---
Gotta do something about tethering. I think it should be a module and should require fuel. At the least, a non-fueled; low fuel Citadel loses tether capabilities.
---
Also, I'd love to see drifters taking up a cleanup role, any structure out of fuel has 1 week to be fueled or it dies to drifters.
---
You are so wrong it's funny. Where does this misconception come from that women dont like dicks that look like dicks? You realize they're hardwired to like it right?
---
Why did you comment this? XD
---
So this is lore wise reasoned
---
Concord is the universal high sec police force and tasked with securing the Space alongside the respective navys but also it got this burden when they got handed the jovians.
---
Also in accordance with the lore concord watches null as an infestation where lawless rogue corporations run by capsuleers without any loyalty to the empires reign so in lore null is the wild west of New Eden and any law arbiting person should Not go there.
---
If 90% of the housing market collapsed it would still freak havoc on everything else. Same will eves economy. If a large enough portion of the market disappears we enter into a recession. Which is already going to be bad for eve. A recession means less content.  Loose even more then that and you have partial economic collapse. Suddenly you cant only buy basic stuff. And at ludicrously over inflated prices. Loose even more and total economic collapse happens. People can still put stuff on the market. But if no one's buying then they are wasting there time. Total economic collapse happens when either demand is no longer present or supply is no longer present. I doubt that will happen o eve. But I do know for that the economy cant sustain itself as things are now.
---
We are all fags, but we aint nanofags
---
The fleet was fun.
---
Yet we pay Concord rent. I dont see why we should bother when Concord isnt doing anything for those of us who live in null.
---
Unfortunatly its a good deal more agressive than previous years.
---
Guess Concord should just keep those bounties you get from ratting then...
---
But we have Black Out, all the small gang pvp'ers are coming back in droves.... nothing to worry about right?
---
That particular isnt lore backed
---
We could aswell pay to ccp alliance as the "rent" is not backed up by lore at All afaik
---
I never got tossed around to so many different comms so fast before...
---
We have had player made stargates on the lsyt of incoming content for 6 years now. Null becoming completely independent as a result of this would be a good excuse to give us those player made gates.
---
big sad
---
How could anyone forget it's the non-contributing krabs favorite phrase.
---
They should. I'm talking about open rebellion against Concord.
---
The refried bean special.
---
Yeah that's true. However whether its lore backed or not it has been in the game for a significant amount of time. Even if there isn't a Book explaining why it's there doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
---
He does get dropped on. He posts those too, but he states he is usually gone before a response can be formed. Though to be fair, he usually fights Brave and PH. He doesn't attack delve. You should watch some of his stuff. I think you'd like it.
---
Thats a fake
---
I can 2 cycle an C5 site with two nags. Mag is ezpz, other effects just take more effort but its still easily doable
---
Yuri was a completely clueless FC. Asking for a kitey anchor as we're landing and primaries should be being called. Then he splits our fleet with a boosh and we welp while he continues not calling primaries. It was a total shitshow.
