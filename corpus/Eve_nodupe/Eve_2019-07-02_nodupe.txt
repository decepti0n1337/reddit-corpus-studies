a few of the normal drifters seem to still be out there in a few places so the occasional DD on a player may still happen, but these huge swarms that are running around nullsec don't seem to be using DD's on players for the time being, who knows if that's a bug or intentional.

With little follow-up on the part of the drifters, this has been one heck of a damp squib of an attempt at trying to fuck up anyone's game, though alliance logistics people certainly had a bit of a run around that first day..
---
Hotel?
---
The chance for them to appear is based on how many abyss sites are being run, unfortunately with how it works at the moment it seems that abyssal PVP rooms just don't appear in low population timezones.
---
Except we're humans. We can fuck up, make mistakes, jump instead of bridge, grow fat, welp fleets because the FC was tired... it's all part of the player interactions in the sandbox universe. And don't get me wrong, I'd love it if there were more interactions with NPC. In the lore, the empires are supposedly losing power rapidly against the capsuleers, yet the most interaction we can have with them is FW. What if we could declare war against the Amarr ? What if we could hire the Guristas to show up to a timer ? That would become a possible choice, a part of the sandbox.

---
What's happening right now is forced upon null, we don't know shit about it, and it doesn't feel like a sandbox experience, more like CCP imposing a gameplay upon us, with no communication outside of "it's not broken". Even if they said "it's an experiment that will be over in a month", they could have avoided most of this shit. And if they had talked to the CSM about it, the CSM would've told them.
---
I'm sorry I'm not sorry my friends are better than yours.
---
 I for one welcome our new overlords.
---
We should only refer to 'The Bee Man' as 'The Bee Man'.
---
Find new friends, and fly with them :)
---
same.  propah.
---
I’ll start the bid at 420.0 isk
---
Do they drop from the Zoryas that spawn in the incursion, or the world ark?
---
&gt;The drifters are not a serious threat to killing a structure. Check.
---
&gt;If left unchecked they will create timers. Check.
---
Which has no chance of happening, because they're so easy to keep in check. 
---
&gt;Timers are vulnerabilities that if left unchecked would allow another alliance to take advantage of them. Check.
---
If you actually play in null, you would have to be *impossibly* ignorant to believe this.  If you don't actually play in null, I suppose it's understandable how one's imagination might lead them to this conclusion, but the practical realities of the game basically preclude this from ever happening.  
---
Is it a medium structure?  Nobody cares, I wouldn't walk across the street for that.
---
Is it a large structure?  Is it across the proverbial street?  If not, it's still basically a who cares.
---
In the impossible scenario that they let a keepstar be reinforced to hull by trivially checked NPCs, unless you're *already* deployed there, good luck with your MAX DOODZ travel op red pen.
---
420.69 isk
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Wat? I’ve flown so much kity bullshit in holes idk what you’re talking about.
---
Drifters are actually Skill-U, they never really left they just were absorbed into the code, so its all a moot point
---
Please bug report this, if you haven’t already.  (Press F12 and click Report Bug, then fill out the form.)  Feel free to PM me the EBR number it gives you and I’ll make sure the right team takes a look.
---
TFW Templis is highsec dudes
---
There isn’t one.  Like I said I avoided you.
---
I’m struggling to understand how you landed here with that conclusion
---
Umm, did I need to point I my post was sarcasm?
---
If it was the TISHU supers than I'm sure it was him, I was there too. Good guy, sad to see him quit Eve.
---
Zarms spool up reps just like Leshaks, it makes them vulnerable to fast target switching, but Leshaks are kinda garbage at that anyways.
---
As for Neuts, keep logi a decent distance from your Leshak blob and have a better Bhaal pilot (and more ECM EWAR).
---
Sure showed that flex structure
---
All the people in here saying some variation of "you're just salty you can't mine and rat in your &lt;insert expensive thing here&gt;" have no idea they are making themselves look stupid. Do a modicum of research on how drifters work and maybe understand how stupid the statement is. It doesn't slow down the nullsec money facet in the slightest, it only puts undue pressure on a small group of people who already put in heroic effort to make shit tick. I'm 100% sure none of you care about those people, which is fine, but if you're going to herfderf and stroke dicks about what this is doing to null...actually understand what it's doing.
---
Even at 0 spoils the zar is the equivalent to 1.5 guardian reps
---
One of mine is, it’s how it worked out.
---
If the gates stop working on sisi we know it's because "eliteBonusCoverOpsCruiseExplosiveDmg1 (1400)" was removed.  (not even sarcasm, it's ccp FFS)
---
What is the high pop tz? Because I just want to shoot some internet spaceships and don't have a lot of time unfortunately
---
&gt;it seems like there's not much depth to it.
---
That's because you haven't really explored the theorycrafting then. Lokis and damnations were the most brainless meta that Wspace ever had. Range control, weapon disruption, jams, damps, and dread blapping were all essentially useless; the only thing that mattered was having more lokis and switching targets fast.
---
Stay out of range on things that are affected? Shaks are really, really slow if they have a heavy neut and actual tank.
---
Can't tell if post is ironic or unirionic but I can tell op is missing some parts of his brain
---
Do you or anybody know the story of CO2?  I've just been watching a video about how they were essentially defrauded by a very clever machiavellian type of player and it was thought they may not recover.
---
We’re just shit monkeys with anxiety and taxes
---
the salt must flow
---
That instantly get 1 shot at any range. Also you can't probe the drifters so its impossible to get a warp in on them. So they dictate range, have massive tank, and infinite tracking and can 1 shot most subcaps.
---
&gt;Personally if I were to start and was interested in combat specialisation, I’d invest in the combat skills like gunnery and ship skills (perception and willpower), plus engineering skills etc (intelligence and memory).
---
Would these skills be compliimentary to mining at all or do they two not really coexist very well would you say? I've a feeling that mining can be quite profitable
---
:salt:
---
&gt;I can honestly say I love cruiser sized ships MORE than Titans.
---
I'm guessing your a combat vet or maybe a marauding raiding style pirate?
---
Of all the perfectly good reasons to call NCPL a joke....you chose one that makes less than zero sense
---
unspoken tears best tears
---
Fair, I was just curious.
---
I was not by any stretch of the imagination arguing the merits of that meta either lol.
---
Did war dec changes in the last year change much for hi-sec? I haven't played in awhile and I remember joining corps in hi-sec awhile back just to find any major crossing camped by groups that were at war with dozens to hundreds of corps. Made hi-sec seem kind of pointless at the time with hardcore pvp accounts just beating on anything that moved and running away the moment anyone showed any sort of teeth. 
---
Basically has the pointless seal clubbing actually been addressed or is that still part of the welcome to EVE experience?
---
The problem I have is instead of demanding cit warfare becomes more fun, we are celebrating a work around to not doing it.
---
as soon as highsec gets the same bonuses, sure
---
That was it. This is that day's fight.

Jeeze you drank far more of the koolaid than i originally thought if you are this far deluded that you are still holding out and no longering throwing out arguements and instead are just resorting to insults. a clear indication of having no more intelligent arguement to throw forth. I will take this as a victory since you are incapable of continuing forth with the conversation with facts and evidence :).
---
Bruh the drifters have allready reinforced 1 keepstar, not that hard for panfam or anyone to store a shit ton of dreads or something in npc delve or anywhere nearby in anticipation lol.
---
A bunch of dudes hanging out in voicechat with a histrionic dude whining.
---
Whoa there Nelly, the statements by the fella above me didn't account for any of that.  It was just, "Don't anchor what you aren't prepared to put the effort in to defend" and "HTFU".  Let's take the skates off those goalposts and put 'em back where he left 'em, okay?
---
It's perfect.  Don't undo it.
---
Oof call in more goons next time I guess
---
within a few weeks or so you can get in a starter battleship for incursions (starter as in, really basic stuff but you make money so quickly for such a new player that you can inject SP's or buy into a better fit).
---
google the various communities like Warp To Me or TDF or some of the non english-speaking ones.
---
Mining would be closer to engineering skills in the tree breakdown. Personally I wouldn’t recommend mining as it’s boring as bat shit. Just my opinion though.
---
Nobody cares about k/d ratios on a tombstone :V
---
GG. Great content. 44th Recon deserve a lot of credit.
---
literally you could jus tup the size of the amount of people. its not heroic to force that small group of people to make this game a second life job its despicable lol. spin more little bee spin more.
---
so you require everyone to use ALL THREE of their character slots on deployment? I think not.
---
There's a lot of space to explore in this meta still, and its more than a 1-dimensional meta like the lokis were. Maybe not quite as good as pre-citadel, but we're never going back to that with faxes this strong anyway.
---
That's exactly what someone with a bad k/d ratio would say.
---
I'll take a wild guess and say they didn't form 400 people to shoot 20. You probably ran into them on the way to doing something else, or from something else, it happens.
---
leave some home? Like wtf is this real? holy shit you are deluded
---
except the ability to install system mods, and build supers, and all that other stuff(like jump gates) that requires you to be the sov holder...
---
none of you wanted to deal with the war in the first place, every single goon i talked to was bitching non stop about grinding structures and thats it
---
How many of his balls can you fit in your mouth at once? Just curious.
---
literally, high sec has massive armadas of ship that put any capsuleer fleet to shame to stop that from happening, purely from a story perspective lol.
---
Lol...... removed your post because you realised it was too salty HA HA HA
---
Plus your spelling is BAD!
---
My play-style is actively killing it off?
---
Okay so first off, that. 
---
You dont even know me, or my play-style 
---
Second, the way you do it in any other area in 0.0, WH, or Low is to D-scan before you warp to something. 
---
*big,bold text*But you can’t with drifters*big, bold text*
---
As for small corps? There are plenty in null, living in NPC stations and conducting business as usual running things like lvl 5’s and Burner missions.
---
And just like me, they do deal with null being dangerous, to an understandable level. But NPC that appear out of nowhere, instawarp, instalock, and, frankly, instablap anyone they come across and are undetectable.. isn’t really engaging or helpful in anyway. I imagine that most of these guys now have to resort to going back to low or highsec for the time being until the dust settles. Especially with their expensive burner fits.
---
And since you seem to know so much about null.. what would you do to fix it?
---
Leave it barren?
---
Aka misery..  What do you honestly think would change? Say let's hypothetically say ccp hit reset and 90% of the player base didn't quit on the spot, yay every pubbie is happy they go back to mining in highsec happy days, goonswarm still remains a organisation with years of rebuilding history and same numbers, they fly back out to delve and within less than 2 weeks (yes that's all) they are ratting every system afk and re-establishing everything only faster, likely much faster than any other alliance because 30000 people with a 51 frigate beats 50 people with one.. Nothing changes everyone loses everything this is why it would be a game killing decision to listen to this
---
I see them often in late USTZ.

Indeed he has achieved exactly what he wanted to achieve haha

Hell yeah it's sexy

Please raise it up! My plex supply with love you, I have 30k sitting here
---
Hopefully CCP can understand why they are so popular. For years now structures have been far too spammable and tedious to remove which in turn has put a damper on other’s willingness to engage in prolonged war. A notable exception of course is when one side has such overwhelming resources and numbers as in the latest conflict in Tribute. With one’s ability to spam structures where even the relatively cheap Astrahaus can take a massive time investment to destroy make it almost impossible to conquer space. Furthermore this has had effects in contributing to the increased safety of krabs rendering most losses as easily replaceable. In short structures are too plentiful, make space too safe, and are too tedious to remove.
---
The Drifter Invasion could go one of two ways. Either it could be another iteration of Incursions gameplay, or an opportunity for CCP to address some old null mechanic issues that are currently hurting the game. If we remember, the Drifter appearance was the initial catalyst for developing Aegis sov/structure damage caps. So how could the Drifter Invasion address structure spam?
---
Limit structure anchoring by having them need a celestial to orbit like POSes had. Small structures would be limited to moons, medium structures on planets and large structures on stars. Suddenly each system is unique and the “geography” of the system in terms of celestials and where they are matters. The in-game justification could be that due to the Drifter attacks on structures, the Eve universe developed some kind of anti-Drifter shield generator or weapon that requires celestial basing (or in the case of the star, using the heat off of the system’s sun) to fend off Drifter attacks. People could still put structures up in different areas, but Drifters will be much more destructive in taking those structures out while leaving celestial based structures untouched. This would cut down on structure spam, while still allowing attackers to put forth a forward base if no celestial is open to do so.
---
The structure issues are numerous including the amount of safety it provides for krabs which in turn causes inflation and lowers the prices of capitals not to mention dissuades small gang raids into bloc space. The Ansiblex Jump Gate providing even more safety than jump bridges, perfect intelligence via local, and not least of all the resource density of space are all massive issues that could be solved. The Drifter Invasion could be used as a pretext to solve all of these issues.
---
and here we have the obligatory salt

Let's see that km

I read the whole post and i'm still trying to figure what this post is all about ? Where's the punch line ?

---
Telling you that you're ignorant of the realities of null isn't an insult, it's just a fact.  You're making suppositions about the way null works that don't actually mesh with the reality of it. 
---
Such as...
---
&gt; Bruh the drifters have allready reinforced 1 keepstar, not that hard for panfam or anyone to store a shit ton of dreads or something in npc delve or anywhere nearby in anticipation lol.
---
You mean the one they reinforced when their existence was a complete surprise and everyone was deployed, which is now effectively impossible because it's no longer a surprise?  You can tell PanFam viewed that as a real golden opportunity by the way they deployed... literally nothing? to exploit it.
---
But hey, I'll indulge you.  Let's pretend it could happen again.  In fact, let's pretend Goons are completely asleep at the wheel and it gets reinforced TWICE down to a hull timer!  Oooo, exciting stuff!
---
Except, not really, because unless you're assuming goons just remain entirely AFK, oblivious, and unaware of their own structure timers, step two of your plan is... apparently feeding a dreadbomb into a titan/SC/FAX meatgrinder?  Which is good for a laugh I guess, but it isn't going to result in a dead keepstar.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
he kinda does, according to latest ping  [https://pastebin.com/q53cn4tx](https://pastebin.com/q53cn4tx)
---
To be fair there's quite a few players who've commented that mining can cause "burn out" and boredom
---
That was a fun day \^_^
---
XD
---
No one was deployed at all. In fact it was their staging keepstar. 
---
It could literally be any fleet comp that attacks. 
---
Keep spinning little bee keep spinning this is entertaining shutting you down lol
---
So the 2 groups that accept members based on having a pulse are finding it hard to find enough people to gun citadel's. Oh how my heart bleeds.
---
I'm a liar because I think bureaucracy isn't fun? Paps, mandatory forum participation, multiple website registration, third party apps, designated ratting systems with their own sets of rules and priorities, approved ratting and explo space, renters, on and on and on. The sandbox idea resonates with my ideas about personal freedom, and the goon (and probably most null blocs) attitude towards that sandbox is one of governance and restriction. It's all the most tedious and stupid parts of being in the military, with none of the tangible perks. I don't really see how I can be called a liar over a stated BELIEF or opinion, but alright. I think allegiance to a band of cringey losers and the sacrifice of personal autonomy in a video game is sad. I was in the imperium at three separate times, spread out over a few years, and I think their model is shitty and tedious enough that someone enjoying that actually speaks poorly for who they are.
---
I am very interested in learning the retention rates of players who join an active corp within a week of creating their first character.
---
Yes
---
Haha yeah that was a good one mate! I'm rubber, you're glue and all that?
---
They should tax your isk wallet when you post tbh.
---
we are having a ton of fun fleets flying out of our c2 with a nullsec static.
---
&gt;No one was deployed at all. In fact it was their staging keepstar.
---
&gt;It could literally be any fleet comp that attacks.
---
You just said dreads tho?
---
I mean it kind of seems like you want to just change your own fabricated scenario every time it's pointed out that the supposition you've just made is entirely infeasible.
---
How does this even work do both people need to run a site?
---
By spawning "structure maintenance" rats in set systems for days on end. :Thinking:
---
A bunch of goryn Clade (hydra reloaded etc) dudes are in CODE.
---
They show up and people just go “oh lol code in Nullsec let’s go squash them” and proceed to feed.
---
Spod does shit to the brain dude.
---
Too bad FW is dead, and events like this can't happen because of that.
---
Titans should be changed to a fleet support ship period they should only be used to move large amounts of fully fitted ships to a battle grid and for jumping fleets. They also could have support features like a mobile cyno jammer.
---
I know what you're saying, but they're a little more than 'slightly more aggressive' than regular rats.
---
Jump clones dood.
---
If defending space is the pinnacle of the game how the hell did you end up in Goonswarm?
---
I joined Sniggwaffe many years back to have fun. As was my luck, BoB lost sovereignty the next day to their oversight, then Sniggwaffe went from flying around doing whatever to help train pilots to sitting on ON- 24/7 doing whatever the goons told them.
---
I unsubbed for 2 years after that. Every part of the game was being taken away by the Goons. They were also in their "burn Jita" bullshit at the time suicide ganking miners and whatnot. The boards and chat comms were all Goons this, Goons that. Every other player in the game was getting scammed by Goon "recruiters".
---
Goons get so much press when Eve University gets nothing.
---
Is it possible for a new player to get an Alpha account?
---
You run the site, finish the third room and if there are enough people running them you get a choice of the origin conduit (back to new eden) or the proving conduit (arena)
---
I fucking hate agreeing with querns . The guys a complete fucking snot rag, but I have to agree with querns here.
---
Yes, to have war declared on you or to declare war, your Corp must have a structure.
---
Oh well that won't work, that's my wake up time pretty much
---
Did anyone actually think this wasn't going to be temporary? It might become a regular-ish randomized event, but CCP knows that it'll get boring soon so they won't keep it going forever.
---
Yes actually it is crazy to think that.
---
  
---
"Oh our newest iteration of sov isn't very engaging what should we do?"
---
"Iterate again to make it fun and stimulate PvP which is what it is designed for?"

"Nah, let's throw some tedious, unrewarding PvE at them, that's sure to make the lives of our players better."

Your posting is worse. Trust me.

I really like the idea of these drifters. At the moment, they are not super powerful or focused, but I think CCP is going to improve them further in the future.

This is a good post with a showing of how and why sovnull has gotten so stale most other post don't acknowledge BUT I don't really think it's the real reason why some people like Drifters
---
Looking at Neocom 2 it’s actually equivalent to 2 T2 Large reps on a perfect guard, it’s still only half a Guards worth and it takes a full minute to be as effective as a single guard.
---
Implying thats not literally the highest demographic of eve players.

Smooth way to guide over the fact that you have literally no knowledge of what you are talking about lol. Not really. Keep spinning little bee. Keep spinning.

Ok

Apostle, Revelation, Retribution, Guardians, etc all common part of null meta.

Yeah but muh 250-400k tank on the Damnation...
---
TAPI diplos have been furiously trying to get a NIP with the drifters, but they can't seem to join our discords or respond to convos.
---
There’s like 5 comments how did you not read the other one that says verbatim the same thing?
---
Ganking for a living
---
The reason people love the drifters is because of one particular person who is acting very salty.
---
High-sec players are barely vocal? Have you seen the number of salty posts on this thread? Nevermind the rest of r/eve?
---
sov holders: 
---
&gt;but the four people who we trust to gun our citadels are getting burned out and there's **literally** no other alternative
---
Have you actually fought these things? The majority of the posts lately scream "I have no idea how buggy stupid and useless these drifters are but you shouldn't hate them even though you do know how buggy stupid and useless they are!!"
---
They are pretty much useless at actually killing structures. If they don't bug out they are pretty easy to kill.
---
They do however bug out and will get stuck out of range of a structure and will obliterate any ship that gets near them. Once bugged you have to make a fleet and go kill them.
---
They are stupid because they one shot practically anything with their doomsday so if you fight them you take the shittiest cheapest doctrine you can find and just soak the kills while killing the bugged one.
---
The reward for all the buggy shitty useless fleets is basically nothing, they drop jack all and salvage for jack all.
---
Perhaps CCP will actually fix them, perhaps not. So far though this even is just stupid
---
Good point, still worth buying day one to get the most out of the booster that comes with it. (Max pilot age 35 days) The boosts to damage and learning are huge, especially if you get hooked in a week and end up trying your hand at PvP. 20% damage boost can bypass some of the "required learning" to be any good in FW.
---
o/ we do! 
---
GoG (Guardians of the Gate) are a Gallente fw Amarr rp corp

5 man group show up to kill your 4 man group and you still call that a blob you guys are a joke and deserved to be removed from the region maby one day actually do a defence fleet of your own inste asd of allways calling goons/volta/snuff

In eve? Disappointment lies ahead.

Why do you have people in alliance who would want to pull your rigs?

If you are using karat H in the joke, there is no way it's too soon.

---
Sorry, my post was vague. it was meant to support what you were saying to the guys your comment is responding to.
---
We are all taking notes on how we can bring 100mn, Halo'd, Linked, X-Instinct, TD Sacrileges, so that no shak will ever hit us again.
---
so CCP did a good job then?
---
Or get ur compressing rorqual killed while theta is deployed :((
---
Heavily agree with all of this but especially:
---
&gt;. What this has done is kill off a lot of the drunk caracal roams, solo roaming and small-scale fleets, and pushed everyone into the same doctrines, and consolidated a lot of small PVP groups together, this also means that for an alliance to realistically defend they also need to be able to get together 50+ people, which has further consolidated everyone. No-one gets 15 caracals together to defend because no aggressing alliance is going to be in something that 15 caracals can fight because if they are they can't kill anything that isn't an AFK VNI or Rattlesnake.
---
Fuck this hurts so much to read.
---
I mean what you say is true...but that was like 10 years ago. Yes goons do mostly the same stuff now (as you do), but I struggle to see the relevance. Unless you are a bitter vet that just venting. If so pop by sometime and we can get weird 🤗
---
Are you asking why do spies exist in eve?
---
go ahead and make the video of you reading that wall in 60 seconds. I want to see this.
---
I keep forgetting that eve has sound.
---
I did the testing on pyfa earlier today. 
---
Your numbers are wrong.
---
I can't imagine an Eve where being blue to as many people as you are is fun or satisfying. I get the sort of content I want, regardless of the shape or size of your blue baked good. From small gang fights to mid-size timers, I can log in pretty much any night and get frags with my bros without having to worry about what some fuccboi wants me to do with my time.  
---
See that's the thing - all of my alliance mates are my friends. Not someone I lord over or collect taxes from or rage post at when my form-up isn't big enough. I don't have operational expectations for my homies. I just want to enjoy my time logged in knowing that I'm hanging out with my bros, and my time not logged in chatting and sharing the joys of my life with said bros.
---
I don't have some complicated political machinations or a region-spanning industry empire or whatever. I don't have to hide shit or snark-post or kick people for inactivity. That doesn't appeal to me in the slightest. That sounds like work. I'm not getting paid for this. 
---
Feel free to slurp whatever koolaid your dad's feeding you, but know that there is another way. There are thousands of other ways. That is the beauty of this game.
---
Because I did it on purpose?
---
Underrated comment.
---
not that easy. this are cit gunners... you don't generally hand that out to just anyone
---
Have you checked the contracts?
---
It’s hard to not agree with him after spending an hour in a cormorant fleet chasing around drifters.
---
Sell on contracts, or invent T2 copies and sell those. Sell in bulk packs.
---
You can sell the ammo bpc on contracts. The weapons/modules as well but they might not be worth much.
---
Shove the meta versions into a can, maybe they'll be useful in the future (lol).

You can use the base Tech I version as invention fodder for the T2 versions of the guns, so those will be the ones you should keep an eye out for selling via contracts. Especially the T1 Smalls and T1 Mediums. I don't know if there's enough of a demand for T1 Larges given that supply is pretty huge for them already.
---
Ship hulls are whatever, toss 'em up for a couple mil below what the rest are selling in Jita contracts for a quickish sale.

I don't know what the Goons originally thought when they began this campaign in 2006. The game is like a casino: the house always wins.

Then dont lol. I'm sure there are more than 2000 well qualified people to man citadels in a 24,000 organization.
---
People sell blueprints through contracts, usually in Jita.
---
I just love these threads and view them to see the comments from goons in the 3 stages of the bee in nature  
---
1- the Rare level headed bee who makes levelheaded discussion and points on the matter
---
2- the Koolaid juiced up bee who Copy/pastes what his leadership has told him to do/his corp culture is
---
3- the Rage enthralled bee who has become the living embodiment of The bee Koolaid and goes into fits of salty rage post's that make no point to them  
---
this is typically the final stage of the Bee, it's death sentence, as soon their remaining brain matter is overtaken by the Koolaid flowing through them
---
Being copies, there will be no market information.  Search for them on contracts to see what others are selling them for.
---
You need quite a lot of shaks to kill an Apostle that can tank 65k cold and cap-dry.
---
Stop it! Stop this logic!

I've seen NCPL, Goons, other nullbloc alliances say they dont like it... Reddit is an echochamber by design and does not represent Nullsec as a whole.

...you literally said they could just "keep dreads nearby" because you're so ill-informed that you think a dreadbomb is going to threaten a goon keep.  I pointed out that dreads simply can't get the job done, so now it's "It could be any fleet comp".
---
Now I'm going to point out that panfam literally just let a couple of keeps die undefended because they couldn't form adequate numbers **in their own space**, and you're laboring under the delusion that they're going to somehow seize upon some NPC-gifted opportunity to form up and burn down a goon keepstar through 1000 titan home defense fleet on short notice.
---
You're not wrong there. Really the only way to "boycott" would be to stop playing. At all.  And I think we both know that's not going to happen.
---
No, he's correct. its ~0.5 guards @ 0 and ~2 guards @ full spool
---
Small enough until you stop whining that your space is too big to defend against Drifters. Oh, I never said you needed to diffuse your elite super cap umbrella. I just think if you're going to have that many, you should be able to protect yourself. Obviously you can't.
---
Okay...    
---
So how is adding this drifter thing helping with those 3 issues you mentioned in this post? It does not stop nullification, not helping gatecamping. Not sure if it will cause more Proactive defense but don't see why it will.     
---
Yes it makes nullsec more dangerous that's for sure.
---
!remindme 16 years
---
And you are still spinning away from the fact that you thought it was a goon keepstar that got reinforced lol. Dude put your shovel down man. You really arent making yourself look good here.
---
Explain how dreads are going to kill a goon keep.
---
I'll wait.
---
I can't agree with this enough.
---
Can you change your support later on? Has this ever been done where another corp takes control?
---
&gt; The Drifters embody and represent this chaos and destruction that has been pushed out of the sandbox in the recent years of focused empire building and strategic bloc level content. The drifters aren't perfect and I agree with a lot of complaints about them from the nullsec entities, I think why people love them so much is the ideas that they represent. That nullsec should be dangerous, that change and the chaos that it brings should play a bigger part in nullsec. 
---
It's not helping, it's projected frustration.
---
HTFU pubbie!!
---
The CEO can declare support at any time. I don't remember any timers restricting how often it can be done. I don't know for sure it's happened, but I would imagine so, given the game's 16-year history.
---
16 years?

Agree with you on all points. Drifters are a reminder of when the game was scarier and far less predictable.

No, it makes it WoW. There's nothing wrong with throwing in a spanner by CCP, but for pvp'ers who just want to play against other players, this unwanted pve 'excitement' is a tad annoying.

Most moon goon has already doubled or tripled and we haven't even done anything yet.

&gt;Watch as your idiot self  delusional leader inadvertently starts market PVP that’s gonna lower the  amount of rorquals you can field.

The number of rorquals we field has nothing to do with HS market.  They are built with minerals sourced in delve.  If anything the price will go down because we're not exporting minerals anymore.

I'm with this post.
---
1) People are hyped about drifters because for once things for static nullsec alliances are unpredictable, more dangerous, and going at a direction that caters null PvE players less. Lots of players have seen their activities invalidated over the years, and people like a change.
---
2) UNLESS it is a one-time event, the Drifter event is indeed mechanically oppressive and not that engaging.
---
3) PvE and NPCs will never be the ultimate answer to make space more dangerous. PvE mechanics will always get minmaxed and repetitive, and overall they will just be workload rather than fun. Meanwhile, every ship dying to drifters is a ship that could have died to players, in genuine emergent player interaction.
---
4) I can see this event turning out positively if its frequency is balanced. It can be an additional "effort tax" to having too many citadels, like organizing refueling. But for that the NPCs will also need to be balanced, and doable by non-capital fleets of about 10 man size.
---

I think almost any veteran PVPer can relate to some if not all of this post. Especially the bit about how the game has forced groups to consolidate into larger groups to protect their crabs or space. I think Omelca  hit the nail on the head in the whaler where he talks about groups dying off because they couldn’t protect their rorqual assets. Now we’re left with 3 or 4 major null  blocks with nothing in between.

Sure, set up a kickstarter or gofundme page. What sort of budget are you needing?  I have no context for such things
---
On behalf of all Eve players and CCP: No thanks.
---
Anyone of your 'connections' that know anything would realize that this is going to flop hardcore and probably wouldn't want their name attached to it. 
---
You'd need multi-millions of dollars to make sci-fi not look cringe-worthy and putting unprofessional actors into this movie because they paid for it is asinine. Combine that with the fact that, historically, video games are garbage, I'd think anyone with common sense would rather just leave this one at rest.
---
My taints nasty as fuck but my hands are washed every 10- 30 minutes depending on how busy the day is at work. :p
---
Haw damage on Titans was a huge problem. A single Titan could shit on a fleet by itself and still be able to warp away whenever it wasn't bubbled. Perhaps it wasn't enough for some, but it was absolutely a step in the right direction.
---
Similar for carriers, you can't track most things designed to sig tank, feels pretty appropriate to me.
---
Assault damage controls for freighters
---
I agree and I've always said that the meat and love of this game is in small fleet roams. 10-15 people in a variety of t1 and t2 ships. Not this 100+ alliance doctrine fit of all the same ship. Capital ships have a place, but when used to stomp a small roaming fleet it becomes quite a moral drain. CCP needs to somehow create cap and sub-cap gameplay into two very separate mechanics. 
---
I miss gate camps soooooo much. That needs to be brought back as well. 
---
One final thought... I think Drifters are meant to simply stir the pot. CCP is testing it out. It would be nice if Drifters would raid random constellations every week and destroyed half of it. This would make players think twice about putting down another station just because you can. Something needs to put these alliances in check. Null has become way too comfortable and the wealth just grows and grows. There's an obvious reason the Drifters are there. CCP has more data about null space than anyone. I have a feeling they're trying to level the playing field a bit.
---
Yes that is exactly what I said, thanks for saying it again?
---
Yes. Please.
---
Nobody cares about this. Burn Jita is not about killing every high sec player. I think you’re completely missing the point here.
---
The folks that got in wouldn't be allowed to ruin it. That's why I clearly stated "SECONDARY ROLES". Secondly, it would be based on the book, not the game....

---
&gt; Secondly, it would be based on the book, not the game....
---
Which is, funnily enough, based off the game. Cute how things work out like that.
---
Eh, you don't need to listen to me. Not like this would ever be made in the first place lawl.
---
I aggree that burning stale null may not be the right thing to do. But i'd rather ccp do the wrong thing and cause havoc with drifter fleets than just watch it in fear and just "what should we do?"
---
Designated ratting systems - liar.
---
Renters - just happened, so calling liar on this one as well, as they don't share same space
---
Approved ratting and explo space - liar 
---
Mandatory forum participation - liar
---
Multiple website registration - corp ESI and Alliance ESI, not difficult, quit being a bitch.
---
Third party apps - liar because that is every null group, not just Imperium.
---
Basically, you have very obviously never been in the Imperium, as you are wrong on pretty much every point. And that is what I called you a liar about. Someone who has actually been in the Imperium would at least know a few of the things you listed were wrong, definitely would not screw up so many.
---
no
---
Amen
---
Yeah, see when I said it, I was quoting Hilmar about "shaking up" nullsec.  So, you really didn't need to reply.
---
Because he stated that he DIDN'T read, not that he couldn't, which was you claim you fucking smoothbrain.
---
Day face!
---
I was too quick to comment, my bad
---
I actually need this
---
Awhile ago we had a great thing going in the US TZ for a couple months, then I dunno wtf happened.
---
Giving players Drifter Battleships
---
Yes, they made that as a requirement. I'm asking if the changes they made actually changed how the game plays out. It seems like it's still common for any modest corp to have regular war decs and I'm just wondering if they actually play out like wars now, or if it's all still just a game of avoiding choke systems on corp characters.
---
Very old, and not actually terrible idea:  
---
Add new lowsec and npc null constellations that will make ALL sov null reachable with blops/dreads.
---
Like the Capital DC that lasts 15 secs. It would make gankers cry but I'm better helping the space truckers
---
And a new guy who happens to be in comms for the first time, what is he to think? This is one reason why new folks nope the fuck out. Always know your potential audience.

It's my understanding that ihubs do not require the tcu be in your name. Has this changed?
---
i see you have some tinfoil, care to share with the class?
---
More or less. Check the base stats and bonuses on that hull, the thing is DAMN hard to kill. Battleship tank on a frigate signature at cruiser speed. Intended so you can have an FC be given no tools to directly impact the battlefield, but also not worry about getting headshotted, so they can devote their full attention to giving orders and leading the fleet (literally).
---
I dunno, I haven't been there for every Shak fight we've had but we haven't gone on a FAX first once - a couple times we've pressured the dreads first but now it's more about splitting dps into squads and putting pressure on the FAX pilot rather than the FAX itself as you can see in this video.
---
The thing is that wormhole FAXes tank so much right now (thanks to the 20b worth of fitting and the 2-3 extremely experienced pilots for each big group) that a proper lesh fleet with FAX + Dread cannot break one in a reasonable time, so it's more efficient to win the subcap battle first and then finish off the stragglers and capitals once the subs try to disengage.
---
Regardless, it's a more enjoyable meta than the drawn out fights of the Loki/damnation meta. Makes a really good FAX pilot very valuable too.
---
Skill Injectors - imagine how detrimental directly injecting skill points would be for the game
---
Yeah, but the game really doesn't.
---
What sort of ships do you intend to be hunting with this Gila? My recommendation would be to remove one of the Large Shield Extenders completely, and replace it with an EM Ward Amplifier II; or a similar module that blocks the damage of the targets you intend on fighting
---
Makes sense, you were always one of the more small gang oriented PL duders who didn't seem to like the renting empires as much. 
---
Have fun gwath.
---
Like so many of these nullbloc videos its all footage of a large number of titans shooting at things that don't shoot back. Such skill. Many funs. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
That being said I do like the editing and production on this one.
---
You can't reasonably bring enough leshaks to reliably break an Apostle (which is the popular FAX in this meta) through a 3.3b hole, since a well-fit Apostle will, besides being exorbitantly expensive, be able to comfortably tank 70k+ cold, even under cap pressure.
---
Incursion Beacons, which forcibly attract the Triglavians to invade a specific system
---
:'(
---
They haven't had a good time with it so far. They'll get there, though. Better than the Loki/Damnation meta.
---
"Mittens is charismatic" that's all that you had to say  man lol. 
---
If you think hes charismatic and not psychotic and delusional. Then you are drinking the drugged up koolaid hard
---
Would this item be called... A *binocle*?
---
And how do drifters that can spawn on gates and one-shot caracals work into all of this? This whole drifter thing seems like a CCP poorly coded Hail Mary attempt at keeping sov holding major blocks line members entertained and distracted
---
Eat a dick sandwich idiot.
---
What tips the balance of this fight isn't the fitting of the Leshaks, or even the Leshaks themselves, it's the chaos all the ancillary ships in the fleet are causing. Smartbomb Vindis, jamming Kitsunes, booshers, etc all play a huge part in these fights. Of course, good Leshak FCs with split squads like this are chaotic enough because you're forcing the FAX pilot to keep up with DPS all over the show, but it all adds up.
---
Not saying the Leshak couldn't use a bit of a nerf, but it's probably not as bad as you think, and more importantly it broke away from the stale Loki/Damnation meta we had before where fights took 3 hours because nothing would break until someone made a mistake.
---
Hahahaha highsec forming up, hahhahahaha
---
Believe me, it would have been better for the whole game if Mittens would have stood deployed. Do you really think loosing a few structures changes anything on the fact that Delve is and will be always the Powerhouse in EvE ? It maybe gives you fuzzy feelings in your tummy if you sit in a retriver in highsec, mining Veldspar that "these white toxic alpha males" now loose a few structures. Fact is, it wont change anything in the political landscape.
---
Yeah, PL maybe has to log back in from Fortnite to protect their last remaining dignity, sorry that I have to shit on your dreams.
---
Ah yeah, and the Delve Squad that was farming Pubbies in Delve all day long can not be happy that the whole Supercap Fleet is back.

Skill extractor that could be sold on market
---
I don't disagree, but am hoping it's like the moon mining. At first everyone hated it (most still do) but it has created content. If the drifters do keep at least taking one timer out of the process it could lead to an advantage for a beach head.
---

Oh, go lose a draugur about, you harlot
---
This^
---
Wouldn't you like to know..
---
This statement is true, it saddens me that so many people have trouble separating fantasy and reality.
---
Every player organization would loose the material war. Can PanFam risk a complete holocaust of their supercaps and Titans ? How fast is a Dreadbomb SRP'd from some random entity ? 
---
Some Wars are paid with blood and tears, we are paying for our wars with a shitload of Spergs.
---
This would make sense if the drifters actually took sov, which AFAIK they definitely don't, and I'm not even sure they hit IHUBs or TCUs anyway
---
Omber? Eww!
---
aren't they?
---
Im not going to recognize this arguement anymore lol. 
---
You are trying to argue something which is incredibly clear that you have 0 actual knowledge of since you refuse to stop spinning away. 
---
Good try tho. Maybe next time you wont fail in such a colossal way, seriously any and all credibility you had flew out the window when you made that error.
---
I'm going to assume you're exaggerating with "psychotic and delusional" since there is no way you could know a thing about a stranger's mental health through just their persona online, so I'll treat that as you think he's wrong about literally everything he talks about. Even if that is true, one can still be very charismatic while being wrong, and on top of that not be a bad person.
---
You forgot to add 'yet'. Do you really think that it will be hard for CCP to tweak their spawn areas and make them pay more attention to certain structures? Or they could get triglavs to do the work
---
You know I want to know......so badly ....must have corpses!
---
Can't share, the mods removed the post
---
but what if I only have 5 PG and CPU left and *literally nothing else* seems good enough
---
&gt; There used to be a time where standing fleets actually mattered and alliances proactively defended their space by camping (see above) and roaming and dealing with intruders, this gave daily content to the campers and also to nanogangs/roamers who came to fight them. Now, that never happens anymore. Instead everyone just sits on their staging keepstar in capitals ready to jump to whatever gets tackled. I think there needs to be some kind of rework or balance around cynosural field mechanics, the cyno inhib, or the power of unsupported capital ships vs subs, to make proactively defending space important again instead of just being alt-tabbed out waiting for a ping on discord as the best defence strategy. 
---
So you complained and complained until fighter application got nerfed to the ground and now you are complaining that people don't use their carriers to derp around and get into sticky situations, you must be a special kind of remarkably alternative intelligent person
---
Do you also have a Fortnite Clan like PL ?
---
&gt;yet we all know is the most dangerous
---
can't take you seriously after writing this, just because it's more densely populated, does not make it the most dangerous
---
And after the fight you docked up into your Rage Keepstars... oh wait
---
OK then, are we also gonna allow capitals in highsec as well, to properly balance it?
---
&gt;&gt;it takes a full minute to be as effective as a single guard.
---
This is what threw me off in his statement.  I agree with your clarification.
---
You're hanging your entire moronic assertion re: "this makes null blocs vulnerable" on "but that one keep didn't belong to goons!"
---
You sound like an infant trying to claim that directly addressing the things you said is "spin".  Hell, I'm not even the only person to tell you it won't work that way. 
---
If you *could* imagine a credible scenario, you'd just... present it.  The trouble is, there is no feasible scenario where this results in some "back door" to delve, which is why you're trying to duck the very pointed question directed very specifically at the thing you claimed.
---
lol eat a dick.
---
Imagine an AI has to do a job, nobody is able to do anymore in EvE. Maybe we should get Hedliner into the Drifters ? That would weaken them drastically!
---
Who's whining that our space is too big to defend? Got any examples of territory or structures we've lost due to drifters?
---
He said, while being too scared to own any infrastructure or space.
---
absolutely.  My argument was that it was even worse then what you just said, because they could just specific resist tank and reactive armor hardener and end up being absurdly high resists as leshaks are all th/ex
---
You've crafted a quite impressive fortress of justification, there.
---
Guess you got your wish
---
&gt;I'm looking forward to what comes next.
---
Mittani fixes the cable??
---
Nobody cares that people are suffering in null. 80% of r/eve is celebrating the fact that null is burning. It’s so ironic because the same people that burn jita is getting burned by ccp.
---
Back to your rorqual, random line member!
---
&gt;Not saying the Leshak couldn't use a bit of a nerf, but it's probably not as bad as you think, and more importantly it broke away from the stale Loki/Damnation meta we had before where fights took 3 hours because nothing would break until someone made a mistake.
---
Agreed, but I didn't say that the leshak was this massively OP beast that can't be dealt with.  I was just saying out of everything, I just feel like the neut bonus is the straw that breaks the camels back.  Its too much given the strengths of the hull already.
---
&gt;What tips the balance of this fight isn't the fitting of the Leshaks, or even the Leshaks themselves, it's the chaos all the ancillary ships in the fleet are causing. Smartbomb Vindis, jamming Kitsunes, booshers, etc all play a huge part in these fights.
---
No doubt, wasn't my point.
---

It could happen.  There are some pretty organized high-sec groups, like.... uhm... uh...

---
Lol let's talk about organised highsec groups shall we.. Code - mostly nullsec players wanting to see the world burn,  PIRAT - a bunch of risk averse highsec wardec players who will pick off stragglers but never engage in an actual fight.. Rvb? Lol there numbers are a shadow of their former selves,  eve uni? New bros rise up n will likely get beaten down, I doubt the mentors (who are mostly nullsec players) would take that fight
---
I mean besides not having fitting tied to gunning, so people can't rip out 30b rigs.
---
Yes, that was the joke.
---
Get use to those undock buttons boys, you’re going to be staring at them a lot pretty soon
---
I realise I just wanted it there not for you..  But for the actual high sec players who think it's possible

I remember being a complete noob, in SMASH alliance, living in TDE. Back when systems had meaning to them. I remember the systems I lived in with the old outposts. Now they mean nothing.
---
Anyways, there weren't jump bridges, and I remember taking a Badger II and hauling goods from Jita to TDE and marking them up 100%. Yeah, I was that asshole, but this was in 2007 or so and my alliance didn't police it. I remember standing gate camps in BWF to keep the pipe clear. I remember roaming gangs who would come from EOA or Vale and infiltrate the pipe. I remember defense gangs going in to take care of the roaming gangs, in sub caps (sad I need to even clarify that now). I remember this solo pilot who ran a cloaking Taranis and he was a fucking legend. The dude was like a guerrilla warfare specialist, hitting our ratting Ravens and Myrms and some how rarely dying. 
---
I miss that EVE. You had the carebears who produced for the line members and gave discounted ships. You had the line members ratting up as well as defending their space as needed. It was just a mix of subcaps, all races, not just one uniform comp of Cerbs, Tengus, Feroxes, etc. It was a gate camp of a Raven, Thorax, Harbinger, Abaddon, Tempest, etc. The kitchen sink, and it was glorious. I get we can't get that old feeling of the kitchen sink back completely, but there are things that can be done to help promote subcaps in EVE again, and reduce the safety of nullsec.
---
It's a sad state of affairs when nullsec feels safer than highsec.
---
These are not the first NPC's in the game. They are just the first conflicts you can't really game, cry or meta you way out of.
---
Not due to a lack of tears however.

Oh.  Well in that case, don't forget about that one guy in (some Gallente ice system) running 60 number-named procurers.  Why, he's practically his own army.

That's actually not at all the OPs complaint. There was a time before interdiction nullification existed. During this time major choke points would often have small gangs sitting on them shooting anything that jumped through. These provided a source of small gang content for junior FC's to break up. Now that they're dead there is nothing in the PvP food chain between vni ratters and rorqs with a supercap fleet ready to cyno in.
---
Right now those camps that provided small gang content don't really exist since anything big is moved via jf and pilots looking to move clones or very small shit fly around in ceptors that can only be killed by pipebombs.
---
As a result the PvP ecosystem in null lacks something for small fleets to do between clubing afk vnis and trying to harras a supercap fleet
---
Try bigger ships
---
These exist kinda
---
Caps should not apply like a battleship. Period. Titans should apply worse than dreads that are sieged. These are not true.

Zarmazd armor repairs spool up faster than Leshak damage. 90s for a Zarm to hit full repair power, 115s minimum for a Leshak to hit full damage; and a fully spooled Zarm repairs equal to 5 Large Remote Armor Reps (most Guardian fits use 4 Armor reps, so after 60s of repping a Zarm is "stronger" than a Guardian). Zarmazds also have extremely long range (72km) making them resistant to hostile attacks (rangetank) and surprisingly durable and defensible (extra Low slot; 3 utility highs which can include a Smartbomb to kill EC-300s).
---
However in exchange for this, they become much more vulnerable to ECM than other repair ships, as a single jam breaks the repair spoolup, and much less efficient at handling enemies *other* than hostile Leshaks because of target swapping.
---
I personally welcome them doing so. It'd be the first time in a long time Goons ever tried to engage in any real warfare content where they cant blob supers and don't have a big safety net.

The danger you feel from a player is much different that the danger you feel from an NPC. We all want space to feel dark and dangerous because a player is gunning for you. The Drifters do the opposite, they actively dissuade player from going after one another. 
---
The past few months has several wars raging. We can debate how good the wars were but its not a question that there were wars in  SOV Nul. This event has stopped all of them. In many ways SOV Nul is safer now thanks to the peace making Drifters. Is not a good sign when all the SOV Nul leaders are talking instead of fighting. 
---
I live in SOV Nul. I wish we had more PvP fight not less and thanks to the Drifter it is now less and that saddens me.

You're a propogandist, it doesn't matter what I say or how true it is, you will deny or minimize anything someone says against your group. If I had not been in the imperium I would not feel strongly enough about any of this to have even commented. And no I am not a member of some rival group, I'm essentially solo right now, there is no reason for me to speak out against the imperium except my own feelings on the matter. If you think it's all lies, which it is not, then you do not know your own coalition and it's member bodies as well as you think you do. Arguing with you guys is like trying to argue with flat earthers or climate change deniers: pointless. You have your view, or are willing to have your view dictated to you from above, and all information that falls outside your narrative will be dismissed or morphed through some crazy mental gymnastics to somehow CONFIRM what you already believe. It's interesting to see anyone, let alone a large group of people, embrace this kind of behavior in a damn video game. A near cult like nationalistic mode of thought evolving in a spaceship game. Almost funny, but not really.

&gt; I remember standing gate camps in BWF to keep the pipe clear.
---
BWF is still pretty much perma-camped/bubbled.  A lot less content in Geminate (and especially that pipe) since PH moved from O-V.

&gt; 80% of r/eve is celebrating the fact that null is burning.
---
it's really not - that's literally the problem.

I'm well aware of that, it's just not the same kind of camp though. Back then there were reinforcements, but it wasn't a massive never ending stream of blobbness that it is today.
---
No please don’t

No, I need more BRs

That's the point suitonia is making, it's not logical really. People like them because it represents some danger being added back to null - even if it's not great content that is meaningful in its own way.

---
Isn't it specifically that it forces **Goons** to waste X hours each day? I know everyone has to deal with it, but the general sense I get is that most people (at least on reddit) are okay with it as long as goons are salty. If goons weren't salty about being pulled back from a deployment I suspect this would be seen as a horrible addition to the game by almost everyone. 
---
I've never heard anyone call for more immersive and challenging PvE, only people saying the game is dead because PvP is dead. Maybe this will all shake up the blue donut, maybe not, who knows, but for now I'm not sure I've seen anyone saying they like the new content because they like doing the content, just that they like that their enemies are forced to do the content.
---
&gt; Is it feasible to improve scan times with skills now, or are they fairly pointless beyond a certain level?
---
Yes, but also Yes.
---
There are of course scenarios you want a max scanning alt, but I find that for me personally its not worth the payoff. For me, I can scan out a sig in at most 2 scans to either 100% it or identify it high enough that I can ignore it as being uninteresting or know that I need to scan it one more pass to get that 100%. If I had implants (because I do already have max skills, wormholer btw) I would certainly eliminate more sites on the first pass as being uninteresting but its just not worth it for my situation.
---
&gt; What is the fastest way to scan down a system with a ton of sigs? 
---
I actually start at the outermost inner planet and work inward. Divide and conquer. After the second I just scan at the sun and then finish off the system working outward, keeping in mind that probes have to warp around the system so I don't want to ping pong them back and forth if the planet layout is goofy.
---
&gt; Simply, any advice for scanning like a whippet?
---
Don't ignore maximum scan deviation. At some point reducing deviation pays off more than increasing scan strength when you try and drop 3 steps instead of 2.
---
Don't let your additional scan acquisition bonuses get eaten by server ticks. 5.01 seconds is 6 seconds.

You may have missed the one hit wonder segment.

Schadenfreude (/ˈʃɑːdənfrɔɪdə/; German: [ˈʃaːdn̩ˌfʁɔʏ̯də] (About this soundlisten); lit. 'harm-joy') is the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another.
---
Schadenfreude is a complex emotion, where rather than feeling sympathy towards someone's misfortune, schadenfreude evokes joyful feelings that take pleasure from watching someone fail. This emotion is displayed more in children and EVE Onlline players than adults; however, adults also experience schadenfreude, but they are just better at concealing their expressions.

Smells like highsec to me.

Sadly this is very true in many cases and has contributed to the pingwarrior era.
---
We still go out and make trouble in small gangs, get kills, get good fights, and sometimes even threaten an objective or two, but it's not easy, and we're not the norm in nullsec. Which is sad.
---
And highsec is super low risk.  What can you possibly lose? 40b?  Doesn't really compare to losing a cap fight.

I disagree that nullification is a bad thing, often in delve there’s gatecamps with titans and supers on grid which without nullified cyno ceptors would make half the region 100% safe for PVE. In fact I think nullified t3cs need a buff to be brought back to where they were. I gate-camp offensively in delve a lot and we still get good kills, plus smartbombing in BSes is a fun and rewarding mechanic imo, with people thinking they’re mostly safe sometimes they transport blingy stuff in their ceptors (ofc can’t do this offensively like gatecamping in delve)
---
Also PDS and keepstars are a big issue for how effective capital umbrellas are, everything you outlined there I agree with but people often forget that you used to be able to bubble a fleet on a pos or especially an outpost/station  undock, now just run PDS and goodbye bubble. Keepstars allowing super docking allow people to not need dedicated alts for supers in empire builder alliances which very very significantly lowers the bar required to access them, making them very prolific in alliances that have access to a KS and don’t have an alt requirement for them (because they’re a massive blob filling up multiple subcap fleets anyways)
---
There was a kid who tried that decade ago and he was really talented. Good editing, sound work and decent script. But then he vanished. In fact time to time some one pops ups, does episode one or two and then vanishes. So good luck, but as soon CCP Games smells or senses that you might make money on it, they are like a unpaid pimp at you. Got my vote, go for it.
---
Mechanical changes have lead to ecosystem changes which have repeatedly made this harder to do over the last few years. If there's less stuff to shoot, and your 15 man small fleet is just going to get its teeth kicked in for poking most groups going on fun roams starts to feel like a chore. 
---
Case in point, I had an atron fleet doomsdayed not too long ago. Just t1 atrons.  I mean yeah, I guess we shouldn't have harassed people on their ansiblex gate, but we couldn't find them anywhere else.

Yes, but they can't really participate in any major player groups in any meaningful way.

Estimated value comes from market data. Blueprint copies aren't sellable on the market, so they will always show 0isk value. You can manually check contracts to see what they are selling for.
---
Why are you whining about Goons undeploying? I thought you wanted us to 'just go away'? If you want, we can come straight back after the drifter menace and do it all over? Would that make  you more happy? Losing Keepstars is all the rage these days in Tribute? Maybe Gobbins would like some of that action too?

Get rid of all kinds of jumping via cyno.
---
Nothing jumps, not JFs, carriers, not Titans, they can use gates. 
---
Now it matters where they are, big ponderous powerful assets.
---
Maybe leave Ansiblex jump portals, but make them very fragile (or not) and bulky enough to require an industrial ship to move. Allow set up where sov isn't held, and connect if in range to bring your fleet in, provided the portal isn't destroyed by the defenders.

To add risk, allow anyone to use it, blue or red, hold the field or give the enemy a path straight to your staging system.

One thing I really miss is having my dad sit cloaked in space while I mine or rat or do normal carebear things in low/nullsec because I had him as protection, if I saw a guy fly in I could sit there and hope and pray that he actually pounces because I know my dad is there to protect me (and I'm not flying a weak ship either if I'm ratting, he is there for assurance) but now I can't do that, if someone flies in there could be a group of 5 more people a jump out and this dude is scouting or whatever, I don't play and neither does my dad anymore because we cant even think about flying into low/null since everyone has a fleet right behind them. As of right now I log on to aggressively rat ded sites in high sec with random noobs and give them tons of money since I've got nothing better to do. My dad and I have been playing since 2012 I believe and having ccp cater to the "empire building" players as op called, has killed the solo game, forcing small groups into bigger ones as op stated

---
Sort Dragon also agrees with us Goons. I think most nullsec entities are battening down the hatches and riding out the Drifter storm. Goons aren't singled out in anyway, this affects all of nullsec.
---
Well ccp could just delete goons assets because in the eula they can do that if they really wanted to, but if it's so easy to beat the fleets with the station guns that just one alt sitting on a station defending it no need for other people, I think the real thing that they're mad about is they don't know stuff about it, that it's hard to game the system.

who is salty here ? let's take them downvotes but here goes:
---
\- drifter event attacking nullsec empires (mostly the biggest ones)
---
\- drifter ships DAMN tougher than triglavian in hisec
---
\- drifter ships don't give a fuck about structure damage cap (should be a structure thing, not an attacking entity perk, right ?)
---
\- drifter ships in nullsec "event" do NOT drop valuable loot (compared to a C5 site to say) or comparable to the salvage trigs drop in hisec events.
---
\- drifter ships are not organized in a normal "incursion" style event like Sansha or Trigs
---
\- drifter ships instalock you and delete your ship before reacting event to click warp button or other action.
---
I know that 90% of you guys hate goons, legacy, and the big empires because you cannot roam anymore in those areas without being bosoned all the time, BUT, what is fair is fair, bring this event to a more hardcore mode because it will be in nullsec, with proper patch notes and rewards for killing them. Then i will stop carrier ratting (which i only do for escalations BTW) and hunt drifters down.

&gt;There used to be a time where standing fleets actually mattered and alliances proactively defended their space by camping (see above) and roaming and dealing with intruders, this gave daily content to the campers and also to nanogangs/roamers who came to fight them. Now, that never happens anymore. Instead everyone just sits on their staging keepstar in capitals ready to jump to whatever gets tackled.
---
This is false. Standing fleets are a thing. How about you stick to your frigates Suitonia... Uh boy. 
---
Credibility lost. oh wait its just Suitonia " why cant my frigate solo a titan, CCp fix".

You are telling me that out of 240000 people you've got 20 guys that can be trusted to man a citadel? You dont see that as a problem? Lmfao
---
Feeling pretty meh toward this argument.
---
For me, Eve is a grand-strategy simulator, where to be successful you have to incorporate all the elements of power, be it military, industrial, espionage, diplomacy or propaganda. For that it's absolutely unique because any other game that touches on it relies on hard-coded scenarios (e.g. HOI4). I guess that makes me an "empire builder" playstyle-wise. If arena PVP is what floats your goat, there are better options out there, including WoT, WoWS, War Thunder, or the FPS of your choice. I put a ton of time in past years into WoT and Battlefield and thrived there, but have moved on.
---
A major part of Eve's marketing problem stems from the fact that YouTube and Twitch are huge components of marketing for games these days and Eve's gameplay simply doesn't translate there in the same way WoT or Battlefield or the flavor of the month does. If you have to squint at the screen to figure out what's going on, most folks are going to change the channel.
---
I'll skip over the gate camp discussion to the question of proactive defense. Have to say I'm a bit puzzled by the argument that Suitonia is making because it seems to assume that Rorqs and carriers are the only things in null worth attacking. What Horde's done in Geminate shows that an alliance can run a thunderdome in its sov, if it wants to. But ... note that Horde set up on the doorstep of The Forge. Goons, TEST and FRT are relatively inaccessible because it's a commitment simply getting to their space. You don't go 50+ jumps on a casual drunk roam with Caracals. Looking at the map, short and manageable roams are a matter of rounding up the usual suspects ... Geminate, Pure Blind, Tribute, Cloud Ring, Syndicate, Provi. Who's based there, and who aside from Horde can and will give a good fight? There's a reason why these are the systems folks like Bjorn go to repeatedly.
---
As for citadels, I find the complaints about them overrated. People want to strike at them first when the way to attack someone and grind them down is to start with an interdiction/denial-of-use strategy that shuts down their income. Make it so they don't want the space anymore (like Goons did to Horde in Pure Blind and Fade) and you don't necessarily have to grind out a bunch of citadels. And that strategy requires a lot of small-gang work, and space adjoining the target of the attack that's either yours or an NPC corp's.
---
As for the Drifter, a lot of the null alliances are shitting themselves at the moment but I suspect there's a lot of playacting going on. They're complaining not because what's occurred to date amounts to a serious threat, but because they don't want CCP to go further down this road. The giveaway for me is that my alliance hasn't pinged or formed a single anti-drifter fleet. With the present mechanics, they're merely an annoyance, not a threat.
---
would make suicide ganking way more profitable :)

Nice scam, although Jita is that way friend &gt;&gt;.

Proving Conduits need love. They usually only happen following DT, lasting until 1900 Eve time (though they can be off/on during that time). Gustav Mannfred made an awesome forum post addressing a lot of the issues with Proving Conduits recently, which I can't link at the moment because I can't access the forums on this computer.
---
[Ask and ye shall receive.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74140441/)
---
Yeah, but it'd also let you bring supers/caps places where you shouldn't.
---
I agree with most of what you say, very insightful, but this statement is just not true, \`\` gatecampers provided a source of content for local alliances to fight with ,\`\`  In my experience, when a properly organised response fleet turns up,  Gate campers, in most cases run away, and understandably so, especially in Delve.  When faced with overwhelming numbers your not going to hang around and whelp.  Good fights are not their want, easy kills is the menu of the day.
---
I like the "we don't care about losing structures, we just don't want to get burnt out defending the structures"
---
Then...don't defend the structures. Just let them die.

Extractors can only be bought with plex.

The drifters aren't even a "conflict." It's the moral equivalent of doubling the number of clicks required for PI. It's a brain dead game mechanic.
---
That's... That's why you use a dozen cheap cats.

We figured out how to counter drifter fleets literally five years ago. 
---
Adapt or die.
---
Oh no, citadels aren't risk free anymore!  
---
The horror, imagine if the game was Eve Online, where ship death, even by NPCs, results in item loss.
---
Who said anything about it being because it's more densely populated? If you live under a supercap umbrella like a large majority of nullsec does, you are only a cyno away from a huge number of reinforcements. This allows you to mine, relatively, in peace. So much so that many nullseccers run multiple Rorqs at once, and can do so fairly carelessly because help is only a cyno away.
---
Compare that to the standard experience of a "high-sec miner". At best they are in an Orca, perhaps multiboxing a few other mining ships, but they face the threat of a "mini-dreadbomb" in the form of catalysts/etc (although much cheaper), without the safety of a supercap umbrella/cyno to call in.
---
Honestly that's just one example "mining". Which situation do you find to be more dangerous?
---
Oh god, can we have fun already and show some spine? Like their is a difference in calling your friend that you play with 'a motherfucker' while calling x or y or z from anywhere else could be crossing it. Like seriously, you are listening to the standing fleet, half of these dude just like to fuck around you know!
---
And we know this "event" won't evolve like the HS counterpart "invasion" because....?
---
At what risk to your 1000 man Titan fleet though? Come on. Is that the "content" you think CCP wants to see in nullsec? Massive Titan blobs?
---
There are only 2 null blocs, Imperial Legacy+GotG+Friends, and PanFam+WinterCo+Friends. There are more Coalitions in name than that, obviously, but at the end of the day there are only two real sides to be on
---
qq more goon
---
I didn't realized Null had some magical game mechanic that made citadels there unkillable compared to citadels in high or WH.
---
I mean, how many Keepstars have died in wormholes in total, 3?
---
I'm not whining about anything, and i don't care what goons do either way.
---
Thing is you dont need to destroy every cita, only the ones where the money runs.
---
&gt; Don't **structures** aid player alliances in defending Sov? Or am I confused about their in game purpose on a meta level?
---
How is my statement about sovereignty? It's quite clearly a question about the use of **structures** in defending sov?
---
I'm not sure I'm the one who's confused here.
---
California
---
So you use fleets that instantly die to stop them? These are not the same drifter fleets as before. A dozen catalysts wont stop them.
---
The dude you're responding to lives in a wormhole, but I get that every time you look up you see NC. spooky demons because that's what Mittens told you to look for
---
&gt; I'm sorry that you find it "a chore" to own **some of the most **lucrative, yet lore-wise, most dangerous space in game? And large quantities at that.
---
Please re-read my statement if you need to.
---
It quite clearly did account for that.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/articles/dev-blogs
---
Ansiblex networks should be on this list as content killers. It’s safer now more than ever in Null because of them.
---
literally like ten days away (next week on Saturday I'll be returning from the first leg of my summer holidays)
---
I think you missed the part of your post where you explain how Drifters change any of it.
---
Exactly 3. One killed in 2017 by Hard Knocks, the other two... owned by Hard Knocks, killed last December by INIT.
---
you mean seeing target everywhere target who no cap support?
---
Tldr: schadenfreude
---
(If you wonder why the original post got so long for that, he feels the need to justified why he feels that feeling.)
---
They're the same drifters. Same high DPS for the few seconds until the doomsday nukes you, same 500km scram range, same tanks, same ships. 
---
We used to farm these things for loot with a massive profit margin. If you can't accept that sometimes playing this game means you lose your ship, I don't know how you managed to make it past the first 90 days.
---
Wait people play eve? I thought we just ESI linked our spreadsheets to play with data
---
Did you just say that goons are too lazy for sov warfare ?
---
They are famous for structure/sov bashing like no one else does.
---
lol
---
mutaplasmid ALL the things!
---
"We have to push players out of highsec for their own good" was always a strong theme among the null-handicapped.
---
"anchor" skirmish links. Makes you immune to booshing, 100% max velosity penalty.
---
I haven't read any articles about EVE Online, yet, but I won't let them deceive me. Thanks for clearing that up though.
---
If you ever wanna travel south LMK and I can setup a similar sized frigate brawl against you guys. Normally late-ish USTZ
---
You can check out whenever you like.
---
So EVE is kind of like real life, right? Where you're just one small fish in a huge galactic sea.
---
Need capital ship pve to the fucking ground.
---
As the recent events show
---
Sort has been suck the dick of The Goon’s and their leadership for almost a year now. So Your statement carries no weight. If Goon leadership said the sky was purple he would agree and slurp some more. Honestly, I hope CCP keeps it up. Well run alliances have been dealing with it because it’s part of the game. If mittens can’t adapt to the games growth them maybe he needs to take his hurt pussy home and unsub.
---
granted, you can do a lot as f2p, so it's not worth dropping cash until you're definitely sure you want to keep playing.
---
I'm honestly glad to see Waffles getting their footing and growing again. I miss you dudes but with me going back to school and the bad hours I work I had to accept that it's not doable anymore.
---
See, THAT is the Harley I know
---
He once apologized ahead of time for possibly peeing on my shoes, he never peed on my shoes but it was the perfect meeting.
---
Allow players to dock Titans in Titans.
---
So does CCP apparently :)
---
3+pg to the Ibis!
---
What if they made drifters attack alliance structures purely based on the size of the alliance?
---
&gt;In psychology, frustration is a common emotional response to opposition, related to anger, annoyance and disappointment, frustration arises from the perceived resistance to the fulfillment of an individual's will or goal[1] and is likely to increase when a will or goal is denied or blocked.
---
The more you know.
---
This is a thread about *bad* ideas, not *good* ones.
---
A boson module for marauder class ships.
---
I stand corrected. Didn't think we had THAT many
---
A lot of medium to small scale PvPers have felt that the game is moving away from them, and as illustrated here they're not wrong.
---
Less wormholes, more nullified ceptors and in part Jump Freighters. I wouldn't advocate for cutting JFs from the game, but travelceptors are honestly too accessible.
---
And in under 1 week of this bull shit 'event' all null leaders have teamed under 1 banner with #nullfirst
---
Welcome home! (in advance)
---
Alright. I've been considering buying one, but I'll hold off for now, and do it later when I'm more sure about my opinion. Thanks. :)
---
I don't know the hard numbers, just a rough estimate
---
Nibbletek
---
Just filter it out. "You cant jump this wormhole because Random season. Please empty your cargohold or drop the hull"
---
Well said OP. If CCP ever brings NullSec back to her glory days I'll be the first bro to abandon wormhole space and come back. Please listen to this dude CCP.
---
Look at the history of features added by CCP and ask yourself if they have a reputation for finishing what they start and properly balancing their changes.
---
Or a half-decent but stopped caring about it altogether.
---
What is "risk averse", Trebek.
---
Ah, you're right. .... Everything jumps anywhere! No fuel costs!
---
Right, so while the pros of joining a large corp would be ships, tutorials, and a helpful community, the cons would be missing out on learning some skills and being a disposable part of the 'whole'.
---
Would that be right?
---
[Damn.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HoBa2SyvtpE)
---
I would agree. I was counting winter co. And panfam as separate but with the disappearance of SkillU.. winter co. And panfam team up out of necessity
---
I think JFs are too easy and should be looked at. But they are not really contributing to the current major issues, so they should be left alone until the rest is fixed and the impact can be better observed.
---
But you can never Nibbletek
---
T2 Siege
---
It's not a boycott of CCP but actively refusing to trade with a particular market is a form of boycotting ( it's an in-game boycott but it's still a boycott ).
---
Boycott defined: "withdraw from commercial or social relations with (a country, organization, or person) as a punishment or protest."
---
Where not trading with Jita because of drifters yeah that's a boycott.
---
Alright, I understand. So I shouldn't get ahead of myself and should take my time by trying to learn the early aspects of the game myself, instead of skipping past most of it using the points.
---
2 dots means that the sig was in range of exactly three of your probes. In order to have that be true, it has to be farther away from the cluster (because if it was closer in, it would have been hit with four probes and been seen as 1 dot.)
---
I have a good personal idea: MJD cant boosh more than 3 entities, excluding the command ship.
---
Thanks, this is rather sound advice. I've been wanting to find a game I can truly commit to, but have never managed so far. It's one of the driving points as to why I want to play this game, having heard the countless experiences of people who've played for decades, or so. 
---
I'm hoping EVE is the one.
---
Ark for capsuleer use
---
Did you notice if any of the more recent Athanors and Raitaru's had any defensive mods at all or not.    I was talking to a number of people who have stopped putting any defensive mods on those structures because they do sweet FA.    Put them up with the required module to do their job, the only real question is the rigs which are tediously expensive.
---
Might not be, but I'm willing to try it out.
---
just leave it to drifters ;)
---
I will certainly try to put in as much time as I can afford. I've heard that the learning curve is steep, but if I just take one step at a time, and keep my grip, I'll eventually reach the end of the rollercoaster knows as the learning curve of EVE Online.
---
Burn out my ass. That statement is an excuse. 
---
EVE is dangerous. 
---
About time you remembered your place, Mittens. You’re customer. Now take you salt, your hurt vagina and your ball home and unsub.  
---
CCP keep it up.
---
Oh get off your high horse. Null is safer than Amarr these days. Then all of a sudden something comes along to stir up a little and it's all "woe is me" and "I'll show *them*".
---
If you can't cut it in null now that there's a teensy chance you might actually lose a ship, go back to real hisec instead of trying to make your own. 
---
Risk is a part of the game. Harden the fuck up.
---
Too busy with that rorqual?
---
They’re not a threat, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t extremely annoying. Especially now that they respawn you just have to spend an hour per system warping around trying to chase and kill them all.
---
And now we don't even have the AFK VNIs anymore, either.
---
I liked grabbing a Retri and roaming enemy space to gank krabs. But thanks to this idiotic VNI nerf everyone is just going to use Ishtars and Dominixes instead. Does nothing to impact the bots, just moves everyone up to a more defensible ship class.
---
Who the fuck is coming up with these ideas? CCPlz fire them.
---
I've had my eyes set on either: 
---
Industry
---
Scanning
---
Planetary Interaction
---
Hauling
---
and
---
Market Trading
---
I, for some reason, just kind of find these to be my cup of tea. Although I'm sure PvP is fun, these jobs kind of give me the sense that I'm making a difference in the world, by getting an item onto the market, or getting materials to a corporation. 
---
It also kind of helps ground my belief that EVE is very much like real life.
---
What do you think of these choices? Are there any reasons I shouldn't consider one, or more?
---
Thanks.
---
JFs are actually really difficult to use and extremely punishing when done incorrectly. How they affect logistics lines is something that would be very dangerous to shake up too heavily. Better to iterate on other problem sources.
---
Allow titans to use Covops Cloak again!
---
Fit adaptive nano plating
---
The thing is, from Mittens speech we know Horde (also confirmed by gobbins), Frat, and Gotg are all on board. Its unlikely Test or NCPL is going to not work with everyone else, and that is going to be 90% of nullsec working together on this. Mittens is the most vocal about it because he’s mittens, but nobody thinks this is fun
---
great job
---
Dominixes are much slower to warp which is an advantage, alphas can't use MJDs on them. Ishtars aren't useable by Alphas, they'll probably go to Gilas and Myrmidons which is similar-ish gameplay to VNIs.
---
All of these options already existed, too.
---
It’s not woe is me.. as I said before.. I didn’t loose a ship.. we are actually getting quite good at responding to them. (Check our Inperium News Network).
---
But I see you have run out of anything of substance to debate.. resorting to insults like a child.
---
Christ this is like talking sense into /r/sino but somehow even more depressing
---
&gt; extremely punishing when done incorrectly.
---
You lose them if you fuck up. Ship and content can be blown up. How is that any more punishing than any other ship in the game? They are more expensive, but that is it.
---
ATM I’m just of the opinion the spawns were manually designated, and until CCP says otherwise, it’s the only thing that fits.
---
JFs don't really have a way to save themselves when caught out, unlike other ships that may at the very least have a fighting chance.
---
IDGAF about alphas. They're not a relevant factor in my gameplay.
---
If that was the case 1DQ, SV5 &amp; 9UY would be spawn locations. 
---
They are not spawn locations.
---
Think about Jita...
---
i formed for salt on reddit since there was already some nice salt i figured we can manage to extract more. worked i guess
---
Then you're just mad you aren't being specifically catered to. You'll get no sympathy from me.
---
Hey 
---
we use amar ships and i do it mainly with my alt.  [Mea Culpa. ](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98592854/)is a fairly young EUTZ lowsec corp  If all that sounds interesting, come by our [discord ](https://discord.gg/szwsSU6)or join our public channel in game: Mea Culpa.
---
Maintaining monopolies is a really bitch when there are new challenges. 
---
“nobody thinks this is fun”... sorry, you don’t speak for everyone and either does Mittens. There are a lot of players out there that thing this is one of the best things to happen to the game in 10 yrs. 
---
Let’s face facts here. Mittens is unhappy because he was stupid and took everything North to try and win EVE. It disrupted his little plane so now he has to think outside the box and try to handle getting his ass pounded by Drifters. 
---
EVE NS has been stale for a while with the same 4-6 alliances playing musical chairs except the music doesn’t stop. 
---
Give titans a stacking aura of 100km that reduces shield&amp;armor&amp;hull resistance by 10%. (supers 50km and 5%)
---
and make it stack.

oh gosh, u had a fight . what a time to be alive

you mean star bound?
---
Flair checks out.
---
they are not cause they have a FC as well and lot more player based stuff like pings and such but unlike what happens in high sec they drop jackshit
---
Jump Freighters are some of the easiest ships I've ever flown. Once you get yourself a good cyno route, you're essentially indestructible, even from PornMaker &amp; copycats.
---
Well, it’s obviously not a bot in that case, just someone going afk. If it was a bot it would have done something to survive
---
Yeah I get mates chilling shoot the shit, all I'm saying is that Brave comms has definitely had a change of tone since I left after coup attempt 27.
---
I mean. Talking sense would be you giving any good argument at all. But all you do is goonbash and insult my playstyle that you seem to have no idea on what it is.
---
I think I need to check your mining permit.
---
Doesn't stop a dozen cats from blowing them up. 
---
Sorry y'all suddenly have to deal with having to fight for something that *isn't* ratting income.
---
I'll vouch you for 5b.
---
I agree with most of what you've written Suitonia but the Drifter invasion thing is not a solution to it. Real effort by CCP is, but instead they give you a "you must login everyday" requirement to protect your citadels. I hate that stuff so much I'd love for CCP to fix the game, but this isn't a fix.
---
I don't think you're telling the truth here, Dran.
---
Non-afk ratting is just not worth it for the rewards you get. Even covetor mining in a r32 moon is better isk and less risk
---
That is the kinda disappointing thing about the Heron &gt; Astero &gt; Helios upgrade path, you really don't feel like you get much out of the Helios. Especially without CovOps V and that's a train time.
---
If you want to go absolute balls to the wall with scanning, set up a Tengu. (Why Tengu? Most mid slots. Loki also acceptable though.) Full scanning mid slots, Gravity Capacitor rig, Virtue implanted pod, RSS Core Scanner Probes. Expensive, but you can break over 200 scan Strength and minimal Deviation. 8AU Pinpoint around planets for the first pass, then 2AU on each individual sig. 16AU range is a trap, never use it; 4AU range can be a trap and you can probably skip straight 8AU&gt;2AU. I only ever use the Spread pattern for system-wide Combat probes, and even that's a one-off gimmick. Trying to scan 2 sigs at once is also a trap and you'll burn more time in trying to place the probes properly than you would on just hitting both on their own. Also, if you already have \[Minmatar or Caldari\] Cruiser V, it's faster to train to Defensive Sub V than CovOps V, and then you can also say you can fly a T3C which are just bitchin' as fuck ships in general.  
---
(Note: When I say "balls to the wall" I mean absolute balls to the wall. 300mil ship but 2.2bil pod. Also RSS probes bite, don't lose 'em. Scans at 213.8 Strength, with 0.0412 deviation, 4.05 \[so really 5s\] cycle. 
---
If you want to be significantly less out of your brains, you can drop 1x Rangefinding 1x Pinpointing and take Interdiction Nullifier, which drops you to 213.2 Strength with 0.0465 Deviation but also bumps your warp speed and gives you +17% Chance to Survive Sabres)

Winterco was never separate from PanFam. NC. have been supporting Fraternity for years. Before the fight between Legacy and Fraternity (now Winterco) kicked off I used to watch NC. jump freighters going to and from their staging system in Curse.
---
Drifters don’t warp to anomalies, though. And since bots don’t usually move between systems, they aren’t going to have a chance to kill any bots.
---
Dangerous space is dangerous news at 11
---
Obvious comment is obvious.
---
Are they even that much worse than a VNI? I've killed several of the TEST ones solo in a cruiser just fine, a few in a Wolf that admittedly were semi AFK, and stealth bombers can handle them pretty well too. Their heavys don't track as well and bs5 is a much more rare skill than cruiser 5 so I doubt the average krab lord is going to have maximum power from it.
---
Tbh I'd rather have pve ships that are easier to catch but require 2-3 guys to kill as a mostly solo player.

There are dozens of us!

oh yes please! and those capital drop massive Loot and then the whine will start that nullsec only gets the good stuff......

It’s more that the logistics are super easy. Form feroxes with a few ospreys. Fly to objective, reinforce it, and mark down the time it comes out on a spreadsheet. When it’s about to come out form more feroxes and hit it again. That’s all you need to do to burn hisec to the ground. 
---
You don’t need moveops. You don’t need to seed ships on contracts. You don’t need to worry about bridge titans, cyno jammers, or bubbles. You don’t even need to worry about any resistance, because what is some hisec Corp going to do against even a half assed nullsec fleet? Even if they win a few times it just makes a actual FC form HACs and then there’s going to be no way for them to win. 
---
The sooner this event ends the sooner we can get back to fighting each other properly

T3 bs, covert ops, 'mighty' interdictor with probing bonus's,
---
Noted, I don't think running my ass off to make a quote is an experience I want to embrace. I have done way too much farming in World of Warcraft from too many years to do it again.
---
Remove asset security from nullsec.
---
while i agree with the general thrust of your post, i think you might be mildly out of touch, here are some points you missed the mark on
---
&gt;I think there needs to be some kind of rework or balance around cynosural field mechanics, the cyno inhib, or the power of unsupported capital ships vs subs,
---
unsupported capitals have been hit with 3-4 successive nerfs over the last year. they're currently gimp at dealing with anything smaller than a battlecruiser
---
kikimora gangs, not drekavacas, are the current doctrine of choice for whaling rorquals as they do enough damage to threaten rorqs with a relatively low number of bodies in fleet (~30-40), while being virtually immune to capitals and requiring a niche subcap doctrine response *in addition to* a capital response to save the rorquals
---
&gt;Citadels have 3 timers
---
citadels have 2 timers now. initial vul windows are gone. this has been the case for a couple of months
---
points where i hard agree and would go further than you:
---
&gt;CCP has focused a lot of the daily content now around Rorquals and Ratting Supers, but all of these require very large groups in order to effectively threaten.
---
in particular here, ratting supers, even with the nsa nerf and fighters in space preventing tether, are still almost completely unassailable without a network of cloaky camping alts. i hesitate to say supers should be nerfed more than they already have been because there's barely a point to use them in pvp against anything other than dreads atm (and why would you use a 30b super that gets diminishing returns on fax reps when a pair of 3b dreads do just as much dps and insure well), but there's got to be some room to create more danger. poses are part of the problem, and their eventual removal will help, but citadels are still dumb strong and there's more or less nothing anyone can do to kill a super once it hits tether
---
&gt;the fact that you have [...] often several days to prepare for the final timer means you can batphone almost everyone on your blue list and have them be able to make the timer. This means that a citadel bash is more likely to lead into a grand strategic level contest
---
don't i know it. unspoken alliance, a group of roughly 15-20 real people, has been stalemating panfam over a few astrabutts in the spire and cache by batphoning goons/gotg/volta/snuff for every final timer. last night we brought over 400 people to a fortizar final timer because they had 7 days notice to batphone anyone they wanted. fortunately for us, only volta showed up this time, but still... fuck a whole lot of week long timers
---
Right, the people in hisec who get to just watch from a distance do enjoy this a lot. I’ll be interested to see how they enjoy it in s few months when all their stuff is on fire
---
It's the price you pay for being goon pets I'm afraid. GOTG will soon find this out.
---
Yeah, this is part is the frustrating part. 
---
Currently, I cant rat properly because my highest DPS Algos is rather weak and my Kestral, Algos and now Caracal research has some time to finish. And before you ask I am a sucker for ships.   
---
Exploration might be the best plan while I wait
---
Stealth bombers are the one upside, it's more satisfying to catch a Domi than a VNI. And they might give me a reason to use combat blops (despite how rough shape those are in), but that's up in the air.
---
I'm surprised that you got some in a solo wolf. The one I ever lost was to a roaming gang. They can usually push off a solo frig/AF/destroyer easily enough, and can tank a T3C long enough to get backup.
---
The Drifters aren’t the way to solve the problems though. CCP needs to fix the things that make nullblocs the only viable way to play, not punish them for succeeding in a play style they made overpowered.
---
More shit designed ships that are op and easily available so that they make the old and better thought and designed ships and industry obsolete.
---
We should get super for reading your comments
---
&gt; less emphasis
---
Less means less not none.
---
Reverse all system security status randomally on down time. 1.0 -&gt; 0.1
---
Doesn't sound *that* bad
---
there's literally a pos role for gunning (starbase defense operator) and a role for fitting (config equipment)
---
i'm not sure why ccp thought it was worth getting rid of this granularity but generally they are huge proponents of the strategy of stupid unannounced changes for the last couple years so v0v
---
You clearly didn't get the point. Op even says it in his post: Rorqs are already dead for smaller entities. And even if you cannot see it, but Rorqs can be a really good content creators, the problem is that the current content is to drop 30 supers plus a few titans, because you can fit a 30k man alliance of rorq mining dudes into one region where a majority of systems is in jump range of one system. That's the problem, being able to stuff 20 Rorqs in an enormous and it works. So what should be nerfed is the empire building like op said. Anom respawns are ridiculous and before there were these ihub upgrades, sec status mattered, which made specific regions in space more desirable. More content creation.
---
So the problem isn't rorqs, it is that there are four big entities in the galaxy and they all fit into one region, maybe two while the rest of null is mostly empty
---
The dude literally got banned on his state from being able to practice law. Good people dont have that happen to them lol.
---
&gt; smartbombing in BSes is a fun and rewarding mechanic imo, with people thinking they’re mostly safe sometimes they transport blingy stuff in their ceptors (ofc can’t do this offensively like gatecamping in delve)
---
use a black ops and have an out cyno ready. fit mjd, 2-3 cap flux coils, ecm burst, and have a heavy cap booster with a 3200 loaded as a panic button. if anything dangerous lands on you, ecm burst it, mjd out, and jump to safety
---
Grath is actually a nice guy just PL wasnt a nice a alliance where you had to be a full on fuckwit constantly.  This will.be like a retirement home for Grath

Alternatively, just mute eve in the sound control panel on your computer. Problem solved. Not like the sounds in eve are otherwise that great, or helpful.

Weird spot for your self-reflection, but ok.

https://i.imgur.com/tMRIRZN.png
---
&gt; Kill rorqs mining ability, make panic 60 seconds
---
one or the other imo
---
if you gimp rorqs to the point where they mine maybe ~10% more than a hulk with max skills and t2/t2/t1 mining rigs, people will shift toward a rorq or two plus a barge fleet. the original intent of panic was to protect subcap mining fleets, not the rorq itself, and for that purpose it's relatively balanced - panic'd barges can't warp out or do damage iirc
---
Come fly an hour with us once or twice a week. No worries bro. Miss you &lt;3
---
Triglavian ships and bombers seem to do pretty well at dealing damage to things that don't move or move slowly
---
It is meant to be sensational.

It was during the monocle and gold bullet riots.

Now? It is a tool that has been used to death.
---
It is nothing now.
---
As a doomchinchila move op
---
The range of fits on citadels is huge, just like with ship fittings.  From 1 or no mods, right through to full highend kit.  We haven't noticed any particular change in strategy.
---
there are potential niches for t2 titans. imagine a t2 black ops titan that can jump to a covert cyno, but can't fit a damage dd and has a substantially gimped gun damage bonus. the upshot? it has a special t2 titan dd that offlines random modules on the target capital ship, one at a time, every 5 seconds for a minute, one minute cooldown
---
oh and it can offline a green cycled cyno
---
How exactly are tech 2 titans a bad idea? Unlike ore belts, moongoo IS limited in quantity, and can't be mined by rorquals. Furthermore, tech 2 ships often serve a different role, not a power increase. Look at interdictors for example. effective damage output wise, the sabre is going to do less than the thrasher, but it plays a very different role. There's no reason to expect that a tech 2 titan couldn't be further specialized into fleet transportation, or some new role that isn't imbalanced en-masse. Perhaps really build on the spatial effects idea, of slowing every ship in a huge radius down a bit, or blooming sig radius, or similar effects.

I rly hate Mittens. But he didnt say "i attack the HiSec because CCP attack us" he say:  
---
"We will attack hisec because all hisec carebears are "OMFGG NULLSEC GET WHAT THEY DESERVE!! OMFG!!11!!!1!""  
---
So if you want to show your balls - do it in the right way.
---
Generally I scan at 8 au then drop to 2 au. I can generally drop by a factor of 4 without missing anything.
---
The following is an old forgotten trick.  It still works, though not nearly as well as it used to (read on).  Great when there are many sigs to probe, like 30 in a w-space system.
---
I always get a lot of hate-mail about this, but you can try it for yourself and see if you find it useful, or a waste of time.
---
1.  Remove all probes from your launcher.     
---
2.  Load a single probe into your launcher.    
---
3.  Launch the probe.     
---
4.  Set the probe to max range (works best with combat probe at 64 au, which can cover some systems with a single scan).    
---
5.  Scan the system.   
---
6.  Sort results by sig strength %, lowest to highest.    
---
7.  Note the relative sig strengths.     
---
There are 3 easily discernible signature sizes:  small, medium, and large.  Large is 2x bigger than medium.  Medium is 2x bigger than small.
---
So if you see 6 sigs, 1% 2% 1% then 3% 3% 4%, you probably have two consecutive groups of sigs, either small &amp; medium or medium &amp; large.  Check the smallest ones first.
---
The more 'valuable' the sig, the smaller it tends to be.
---
Wormholes tend to be large, but there are some medium, and small ones are fairly rare but do exist.  This is sig size, NOT mass capacity nor ship size!
---
Why this doesn't work as well as it used to:  one used to be able to nearly determine the exact sig type based on its size (we lost the decimal precision in the gui), and there used to be weak 100 au probes that were great for covering almost any system with a single scan.
---
You can use your in-game notepad to keep a log of signatures to prioritize (and other useful stuff you want to remember).
---
Trivia:  sigs used to be visible in space.
---
Small wormhole gang fleet wants some content. We have maybe 8 people and we're wanting some nullbears to form up.
---
Lost story short, they drop a massive fleet including 3 titans on an 8 man fleet. Just hilarious overkill because they wanted zero risk.
---
Whatever, 3 killed Sabres were worth more than my HAM Prophecy.
---
Fucking read this Hilmar.
---
&gt;unsupported capitals have been hit with 3-4 successive nerfs over the last year. 
---
This is why CCP's feathery touch these days is so dangerous. They make tiny changes that hardly have any impact on the problems and then people go "but look, it's already been nerfed like 3 times and now you want even MORE nerfs?!"
---
But yes, obviously you keep making changes until the problem is actually solved.
---
There's going to be a *lot* of those too, though. And it's not like it'll actually make that much difference for the average highseccer if they do, as it's mostly the "1%" that truly have huge sums to lose on the NPC taxes etc.
---
you're repeating mittens by the letter, his brain washing did obviously work.
---
The zombie bee horde is made of many parts and we need to find ways to split the coalitions down into alliances again.
---
Yeah so, that total Q length is 43 Days. and I am doing CPU and power management 5 and doing all the rockets to 5 as well. I found a basic fitting and recommended fitting.  The recommended fitting is what I am shooting for as to try not to waste my investment.
---
system security status increases or decreases according to how many npc pirates are killed, adjusts at downtime. watch as delve becomes 1.0
---
I'm talking deliberate on-demand wormholes, not just "Eh give me some more wormholes sometimes". Instant-ish access to anywhere, ANYWHERE in the cosmos. Including the COSMOS, because goddam some of those agents are in weird places.
---
literally ._.
---
&gt;oted, I don't think running my ass off to make a quote is an experience I want to embrace. I have done way too much farming in World of Warcraft from too many years to do it again.
---
I am hearing this a lot and will make peace with the fact that it wont happen
---
i dunno man i've fought caps a few times since the last round of nerfs, and i've fought subs with caps since the last round of nerfs. they feel truly gimped and ineffective
---
Bug reporting doesn't seem to work, so I rebound f12 to something more useful.
---
We already can though?  It's just VERY, VERY expensive to do so. 
---
To be clear, I'm saying that you can get your assembled, rigged, fully fitted titan from outside of a station, inside an npc station in lowsec, intact, completely within existing mechanics and without any exploits.
---
Probably works in nullsec too, but given the enormous cost, I highly doubt anyone is going to do it intentionally.
---
New ECM modules. For exemple
---
- one that can force overheat on your modules
---
- boarding pods, full of the marines, militant etc .... (at last some use for them) : launch them to a ship, order them to power off random modules. HAHA ! tough luck, that was your armor repper that just went offline !
---
Remember when you used to see macks and hulks in space? Another thing of the past.
---
pretty sure he said BAD ideas.
---
Thanks I am looking into this
---
So... putting the current 20% damage faction ammos in the plex store, then?
---
Maybe true but Until recently NC. And pan fam rarely intervened on behalf of winter co. with the exception of big fights such at UALX
---
They can be traded on the market.
---
why not just let people pay their subs with in game currency.
---
Finally, someone coming forward with a fucking horrible idea instead of a bunch of stuff that actually could be decent if implemented right.
---
You are going to have to pitch better than that.
---
- do you have a potential distributor - if not then how do you propose to recoup investment. A friends recent film gained 4 star reviews and just financially tanked on its opening weekend.
---
- you want to be the screenwriter - what experience do you have? It’s not an easy gig.

&gt; Bad ideas thread
---
*hmmm, he probably meant good ideas, not bad ideas, better submit what I think is a good idea*
---
You realise the size of goonswarm right without INIT in wouldn't be what your after I can assure you 😂
---
One of the big concerns I have about T2 capital ships is that almost all T2 subcapital ships have an innate bonus to two damage resists. Apply that innate resistance to a capital ship HP pool and you're suddenly looking at a ship even more stunningly durable than its bulk already implies. A weapon to surpass It Would Have Lived If It Were A Shield Super.
---
Dual box dominix also works.  Probably cheaper post insurance than 2 praxis.
---
We already have them, they're called titans, and their jumpbridge feature mimics the role a stargate plays, allowing ships to portal from one destination to another.
---
\- issues while importing fits from the game (import fitting screen stays on forever, if you refresh, the fittings are there. PS: i have a LOT of fittings)

\- issues while browsing imported fittings, works very slow at times.

you might want to distribute your servers via a load balancer  / dockers with traefik LB and sql cluster if the data becomes too much. PM me for more info
---
Stargates stopped working on tq once for about a week. It was glorious.

Seriously though, was it so hard to read the part where he said BAD ideas?
---
Yes like all those mining ships and transport ships with their gun hard points and free high slots.
---
T2 bastion

Objection. This thread is for *bad* ideas.

reduce all ISK faucets by 90% of current values.

where ? i roamed over 50 WHs during the last days searching for something different than nullsec and i only killed an afk magnate ... where is everyone ? No MTUs left, no drones , now forgotten SMAs , no unanchoring/low power structure to steal/destroy easy, zero.
---
I put in a load (8) of bug reports, and was told it was either not able to be reproduced, it wasn't in the logs or it was lag at my end. So I've stopped putting in bug reports...
---
This is the most worrying thing. Instant alliance. This is telling me the game is dead. They should burn the sov ns to the ground, and cleanse the filth of EvE.
---
Tbh, DEQC left brave and where IMO the classiest bunch of dudes BRAVE ever had. Most of the people you hear now are ex-horde people. The dynamics are changing but the moto stay's. It's not applied as hard as it was but the idea remains. We ask that most people keep it on the line and stay respectfull. But yeah, you might not get the Brit with a cup of tea on our coms that much anymore sadly. :-(
---
That's nice but they're still being used as often and as effectively for just about everything, so we've still got the same problem.
---
And how often did they *need* intervention of that scale before they went to war with us?
---
It's not that it wasn't there, just that it wasn't necessary to activate it.
---
The olmeca's of eve are partly responsible for pushing people to said empires.

This truly is the end of days tbh.
---
E-Uni varies between campuses. The three campuses outside of HiSec (Incursions does their own thing) generally prefer armor doctrines. HSC is probably the one with the least Amarr stuff, since basically every doctrine fleet out of HSC is either Merlins or Caracals. WHC (and wormhole people in general) loves Amarr ships. One of the two frigate fleet doctrines (used less often than the Merlins/Bursts doctrine since this sort of thing generally runs out of HSC, but there was a roam of it a couple of weeks ago) is Punishers and Inquisitors. One of the two doctrine frigates for LSC is the Tormentor, but most of the ships for heavier doctrines than frigates are Gallente. I'm not actually sure if AMC does doctrines, since they focus more on industry. Solitude is an isolated region where you have to pass through NullSec to get to the main area of HighSec, so its people seem to have more overlap with LSC and NSC, PVP-wise, than HSC.
---
Here's that buffer tank Punisher doctrine, for example (I'm not really giving away any secrets by linking to our publicly available wiki that basically everyone uses to some degree):  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Golden\_Horde\_Punishers](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Golden_Horde_Punishers) 
---
Basically, the way that it's usually done is the same as the Merlins doctrine but with armor. HSC is right by FW space, so there are plenty of PVP opportunities nearby. Scouts go through the gate, find someone (usually a lone frigate in a plex, but juicier targets are always appreciated), tackle him, then a bunch of short-range slow, frigates jump the gate, warp in, and blow the crap out of him. And it it's something blingy such as a HAC, you get to read some entertaining insults against the corp in local (if the people who beat me really did suck as much as these people seem to claim we do, I wouldn't tell everyone else in Tama that they beat me).
---
And another thing. Basically anyone is allowed to organize an event. So if you want to do an Amarr fleet with us, just put it up as an event (although you need the Sophomore title for in-game calendar access). And then you can do another form and you can arrange for ships of whatever fit you are running to be set up on contract at the staging area which you indicate. Regarding armor fleets: if you build it, they will come.
---
And armor tank in general seems to be more popular for PVP fleets across NullSec.
---
Thank you sir :)
---
Yeah this is one of the better summaries of what has me burnt out and tired with EVE. I've ran Spectre Fleet for a pretty long time now, and seeing the content go from being easily able to stir up some defense fleets - to praying to god to come across some other roaming gang - it's a sad state of affairs for smaller content.
---
Well - if you aren’t active enough to defend the citadels you currently own, cant an argument be made that you should not have that many citadels?
---
More power creep with T2 Titans, T3 Battleships and T3 modules?
---
You are all giving them ideas to either put into the next expansion or sell when they decide Skill Injectors aren't making them enough from the game altering item section of their shop.
---
&gt;.
---
fanx fam :3
---
Everything about this post reeks of naivety and ignorance.
---
I mean, he did say that rorquals are still too hard to kill and require very large groups.
---
Any disruption that even ***might*** cause drama or tensions within a coalition is a necessary thing at this point.
---
Then alliances would just split into smaller entities ruled by an out of game umbrella.
---
“Kikimora gangs are currently the whaling ship of choice”
---
It’s funny that you call someone out for being out-of-touch, and then proceed to write garbage.
---
This is a worse pitch than Goonswarm's rewritten history kickstarter book.
---
CCP changed boost mechanics and pushed rorqs onto the field. This was a change I loved but it turned out a double edged sword. I mean, sure, I guess you can blame the whaler for whaling. That’s sort of like blaming a snake for having fangs. I think you’re blaming the affect and not the cause.
---
That's a fine argument. I'm going to implement a mechanic that requires you to do the hacking minigame daily or you will lose 1/20th of your wallet. Do you think this is a good mechanic based on what your criteria?
---
Expected a meme, got a wall of text. Thanks.
---
I think you are mistaken there ... it's a casino ... ;)
---
Mh okay, that is true, the problem is, if you nerf them now to die instantly, no one will use them anymore and then a lot of content will dry up. When people are spread around more and if it happens that the big groups will split then you can think about nerfing their tank.
---
My wallet has nothing to do with the fact that you have an issue with citadel spam. Not sure how you made that connection tbh.
---
meh, l only love them because l would love to fly there ships that's all l care about and a set of cloths to my a alt look like a drifter
---
Don't know when you tried to upload a fit or browse through them. But we had to restart EVE Workbench due to a small bug which can cause the system to feel slow. Please check it again.
---
About the load balancing and sql cluster with Docker: this is very nice to have indeed.. But as EVE Workbench is just a private funded project it currently is not an option to have multiple servers running it. And its not needed as the servers can handle the traffic just fine with occasional spikes.
---
will try again and report. i can sponsor some VMs if you need, when you need.
---
Yeah I get it, however people will always mine. Not everyone can afford to multibox 3+ toons to hit the same level of ore mined as a rorqual, so there will always be guys that use them. 
---
I’ve always been against the PANIC timer as I don’t think any ship should be entirely immune to damage for a long period of time. Even with the recent nerf, 4 minutes hasn’t really effected the safety of rorqual sitting under an immense capital umbrella.
---
It has everything to do with a compulsory non player system that forces you to login to defend your assets is bad game design that I didn't sign up for.
---
yeah it’s hard to defend against drifters when you have too many citadels.
---
When you have less citadels, though, it will be much easier. You’ll see.
---
CORPSE FOR THE CORPSE HANGER!
---
Change all NPC stations to have full Citaldel mechanics with npc hauling fuel etc, enemies in opposite fw can kill them without concord etc.

Instead all ccp has managed to do is unite nullsec as 1
---
* Skill Injector Multiplasmids.
---
* T3 Mining Barges
---
* Drones with finite ammo supply.
---
Its telling me they should burn r/eve to the ground because it was literally the spergs reeee'ing on here and patting ccp on the back for implementing broken mechanics that caused it
---
You can't Enlarge that sorry
---
Get people back in the belts
---
How long have you been sitting on that screenshot....
---
When you get a response like one of those, we didn't have what we needed to be able to take action right away, and the responder (who could have been an ISD volunteer or a CCP developer) let you know some common causes for similar problems that can occur on your end.
---
But, what's I want to emphasize is that bug reports like that are not a waste of time.  As a software engineer at CCP, I'm often trying to track down problems that are impossible to reproduce, and being able to dig through bug reports (including closed ones) to identify other cases of the issue occurring is a tremendous resource.
---
Your bug report that may have been initially closed as impossible to reproduce could later be the key one that offers an important bit of information to an investigation.  Maybe you alluded to something you did just before a thing happened, or maybe your machine configuration fits a specific pattern, or maybe the original responder missed an important detail in the logs.
---
My point is:  A bug report's value doesn't end when it's "closed," nor is it ever normally deleted from our system.  We could do better at communicating this.
---
People have moved into wormholes as a response to travelceptors and jump freighters eliminating nullsec traffic.
---
They're not more powerful really, and nullsec groups very rarely use them on an individual level. It's just the only way to touch the various groups living 50 jumps into nullsec who JF all their goodies and travelceptor when they need to move.
---
I don't get it, if there are literally hundreds of "overstretched" structures out there why didn't players themselves blow them all up in the past two years?
---
seems like a great work, wanted to ask something tho, the paradigm to program a bot is something like, you create it to answer certain stimulation?
---
I mean, if user inputs this, then bot does this and that, in case theres no implementation to answer certain input then nothing happens, that kind of behavior?
---
Hope I made myself clear.
---
There was a NC. Chinese corp that worked with them closely since the start, but NC. as an alliance hasn't been too involved until recently.
---
&gt;It's been great content warping around in a system with 50 dudes for 90 minutes to clear out zero isk/zero reward rats.
---
The real reward was the retards you chatted with along the way
---
Doh! 
---
Either way, still pretty funny :p
---
The drifters are like all the rest of the shit that will visit deep sov space, tiny, fast, and powerful for its size.  This makes any response gameplay unfun, inefficient, and uneconomical.  
---
The player versions of these ships are designed to run away from anything dangerous and kill anything that can keep up.  
---
The drifters are the same way.  
---
The result is the same.  Ignore them until they become annoying enough to death with through efficient or fun methods.
---
Middle-Earth: Shadow of War was one of my most anticipated games, until I learned it had microtransactions and a grindy end game to force you spend money. I didn't touch the game. It would have been a launch week purchase from me but Warner Bros. ruined it. Fortunately, about a year later Monolith removed ALL microstransactions and rebalanced the entire game. I finally purchased it, severely discounted as well, with all the DLC (all quite good too) and had a great time, put over 80 hours in and wholeheartedly recommend it today.
---
Its almost like perception is more of a factor than reality...
---
/r/eve since the drifters is a prime example.
---
Ok lets be honest the moment capital smartbombs get pds animation i will mount them on my titans
---
I havnt brought it yet, same reason I didn't touch it, I loved the first iteration and was eagerly looking forward to the second
---
Applying only to subcapitals of course
---
Jita and peri 0.1 ... Trust me we will do the work
---
Hes not wrong.
---
There is a long and storied history of this type of 1v1 or small scale pvp in a larger environment being impossible to balance without killing the larger environment too.
---
WoW Arenas are the headline example, but there are others.
---
Nah, carriers are relatively well balanced now, an extra nerf would make them useless. Fighters ave a hard time applying dmg on small targets (like kitey cruisers etc), so if you want them to be effective you'll have to go for a full dmg application fit which is pretty much paper tank, this is a relatively good compromise imo.
---
The main problem with capitals is the cyno mechanic that can instantly bring +50 capitals to save any krab within range of the super umbrella. That mechanic needs to be seriously nerfed (make cynoes limited by mass like wormholes for instance), that way the only effective way to save a krab will be rushing there with a subcap fleet. 
---
It won't change the blobbing as people will always tend to get more and more people to ensure kills, but at least they have to come and get you, not click on jump and faceroll their keyboard.
---
That's not how it always was. Campers in delve run because they know if they don't they're going to get pasted by supercaps. Before, back when drunk caracals were a thing, gatecamping was a way to force a fight to happen and get content.
---
Every point you’re making is true and has been told by you and many others to ccp countless times. But all of this has nothing to do with drifters. Drifters are not gonna solve deeply damaged game mechanics. Like structures, capitals and timers. Throwing npc creep doesn’t answer to any of the points you make. It’s of course always fun to see other people getting shat on but nobody is winning anything over nullsecers being forced to gun citadels. It’s just creating anger for no benefit and will make real necessary changes so much harder to push. Overall everyone is at a loss here because throwing random shit at people that doesn’t change anything but just annoys them only makes stagnation worse.
---
Doomsday for t1 destroyers.
---
There were no titan blobs defending delve at the time but there were no real threat to the structures there anyway after the first week of the war. This argument that they had no way to defend against the imperium are just an excuse. They did just what they needed to do the first week of the war, harrassing in Delve and picked off/attacked anything they felt they could handle and they even somewhat won encounters but 3 weeks into the war Tribute was more secure to travel than Delve are in peacetime because NCPL gave up and went off to bully someone smaller.
---
The reason Null is stale is because theres little incentive and it's way too much hassle to attack anyone.
---
Drifters aren’t solving anything for them though.
---
How often do we get responses about bug reports because I made an audio related one about a month ago and never heard anything back. It was easily reproducible but I didn't use the F12 menu. Could this have been the problem?
---
Be careful what you wish for though.  
---
Removing nullification would make turbokrabs that much safer behind their bubblefucked gates
---
was a damn good fight and [s-b-a] was there almost in full strength. this makes me rly happy :)
---
Yeah, the successive light nerfs have to go. The response to every rorq/fax/capital nerf has been to get more. No single nerf has been large enough to be paradigm shifting and now after years of little nerfs with the response to each one being to get more, the problem is only worsened
---
i'm not sure it's quite as insidious in eve compared to mobile games - at the moment. i'll be honest i watched about 2 mins from the timestamp you linked. about the ice breaker.
---
eve is a subscription game, so i'm fine with paying - i always have done. however i'll never buy pure plex packs (that's my "wall"). the "dlc packs" i have purchased - however they have to be seriously good value. 
---
lets take the recent starter pack as an example. 1m sp for £4.25 or something like that.
---
£4.25 is about 15 days of game time. That equates to ~1m SP.
---
£4.25 is about 110 plex. that equates to 450m isk, which is... 60,000 SP.
---
As you can see, plex itself is an absolutely piss poor way of acquiring SP when you're over that 80m SP threshold like myself.
---
the starter pack, on the other hand, provides me with the exact same amount of SP for my cash. after that i'm just trading omega time for the accelerator/skins/apparel and convenience of having that 1m unallocated. 
---
If you wait for the sales, CCP's micro transactions aren't actually that predatory when you line them up against what you get for your subscription money.
---
let me be clear, i don't fucking like micro transactions and we all know CCP hasn't got it right in the past. however if you wait for the sales then the packs aren't realistically any worse than subscribing.
---
i think if you set your barrier appropriately with the right mentality you won't fall trap to insidious micro transaction practices. as it stands right now though, ccp's micro transactions may leave a bitter taste in people's mouths in some regards - they aren't quite as far gone as to be called "predatory" imo.
---
This doesnt have nearly enough upvotes as it should have.
---
I think that's the way to go with a lot of games.
---
I did the same with fallout 4, if you wait then you can get the base game + all the bundled DLC cheaper than the base game's release day price.
---
hell, look at the witcher 3 right now - it's £10 for the game + all the DLC on steam.
---
it feels like developers have completely forgotten that if you just produce a solid game at an unoffensive price point - people will buy that shit up without question. once you start loading a game with obscene amounts of overpriced DLC/micro transactions then not only do you lose customers for that game - it erodes faith in them and customers won't return for future titles.
---
Haha, that's adorable
---
Firework launchers that do AoE damage

---
&gt; fighter application got nerfed to the ground
---
they still apply extremely good/to good to nearly anything. hence they are still the go to caps/doctrine against everything that drops/roams through your space..
---
so explain me please, how did fighters get nerfed into the ground.
---
Agreed. The fact that CCP deemed it necessary to do this only shows how broken this game really has become. I don't like the fact that they now try to annoy players that have succeeded by using the tools that CCP gave them.
---
I think resource scarcity and region locked resources (possibly even completely removing some resources from nullsec) would have been a much better approach.
---
Snakes be snakin my dude.
---
&gt; It can be an additional "effort tax" to having too many citadels, like organizing refueling.
---
I like this and it's something sorely missing from the game.
---
People complaining about having to protect 60+ structure timers all over place, makes you wonder if every single one of those 60+ structures are actually important enough, or if it's just an overreaction.
---
A user can input anything indeed. And if there's nothing to handle the command nothing happens.
---
The handling of the input can be found in \`DiscordConsumerCommand.php\`.
---
Just delete rorqa altogether, they have to go.
---
Lmao they wouldn't dare show themselves in highsec.
---
Exactly spodbrain!!  YOU wanted to live in null, have citadels and reap the rewards.  YOU have to work for it now. 
---
Don't like it?  Go back to HS and mine low value ore.  Don't like that?  Go back to WOW
---
It may not be a waste for you, but it's a waste of my time.
---
Love seeing stuff like this. Really excites the old brain.
---
Great post, right on the money with my worries as someone who enjoys flying smallgang.
---
Couple of bugs for ya, drifters don't obey damage cap on structures, drifters also have bugged engagement, falloff &amp; optimal range's, they engage and kill anything on a grid.
---
Shit, I didn’t know I was Phenod
---
haha ur losen war in highsec need me 2 call mom 4 u?

something, something, happy pride month

Maybe not, but it is something being done by CCP which isn't catering to the nullblocs so it feels like a sort of progress for some people.

excavators are the problem. rorquals as a sieged, super-powerful mining boost and ore compression platform is a great idea, but until excavators were introduced and links were forced on grid there was never a reason to actually put them in a belt
---
if rorq links (and compression) are strong enough to justify sieging a rorq in a belt over using an orca instead, but excavators aren't strong enough to justify using more than one or possibly two rorqs at a time to cover a belt with boosts, i think that's the sweet spot
---
letting the rorqs mine *some* helps offset the cost of heavy water to siege them, which helps offset the cost of the ship in the first plce
---

&gt; The main problem with capitals is the cyno mechanic that can instantly bring +50 capitals to save any krab within range of the super umbrella. That mechanic needs to be seriously nerfed
---
i was with you until you said this. there's no solution for the problem of "cynos are overpowered because you can bring in infinite caps through the same cyno" that can't be solved by a large group with a good logistical backbone
---
limited mass through a cyno before it turns off -&gt; initial cyno with a ceptor, jump in a brick tanked rorqual full of ozone and just keep hammering the cyno button while titans pour in
---
limited number of ships can come through one cyno -&gt; light initial cyno with a frigate, jump in light a cyno with a fax, repeat ad nauseum
---
you can keep listing proposed "fixes" and i'll keep shooting them down with simple things large groups will do to circumvent your fix, while smaller groups will struggle to ever use caps again because of them
---
nice ,you probably have a heart of gold that benefits so many people in your life :)
---
FAXes are incredibly big as well.
---
i like eve a lot and i've had this discussion a zillion times with smarter people than you

"nerf cynos" is an old, bad suggestion. let's move on
---

---
good bot
---
Oh for fuck sake tristan don't make me resub after 3 years
---
Yeah but you need to have at least 2 BSes to kill even some no tank ceptors and 3 to kill any reasonably tanked ones, some fits can even require 4
---
If you fit a cloak you increase those numbers
---
mad man
---
Umm trig ships are basically anti capital subcaps
---
So far, you've been dismissive of Sort Dragon, Gobbins, Mittens, which is essentially saying that nearly half the players in the game, under those leaderships, are wrong. Hmm....now let me think...
---
I don't really care what asteroid belt he's crawled out of.
---
You had the choice 2 years ago. You choose money and power over fighting with friends. Now you reap what you sow. Stop trying to put yoursef into the victim role for once k thx
---
This should be downvoted to the bottom of the thread
---
The thread is about *bad* ideas.
---
If only there was some kind of end-game small gang content to keep them hooked.
---
And horrifically destructive, when you think about it.
---
Thanks, I see that it's better to have a full Omega account. I think I'm right in saying that if you pay your subscription with in game earning then it is an Alpha account which still is limiting.
---
I think everyone could agree with you, now let's try to find the real cause and fix it.
---
For many people the cause was capital/super proliferation, including rorquals.
---
Let's be honest, this is a consequence not the cause.
---
In past you have to train a lot to even out your ass on a capital.
---
Those who wanted a super or titan pilot had to create a dedicated toon, forget about it for years and train it until the final goal was reached, and then they can't get out of the ship until was destroyed.
---
So what's the real source problem of this capital proliferation? Skill injectors.
---
My suggestion:
---
- remove skill injectors or limit them to alpha toons
---
- turn injected SP back to injectors (at least for capital related skills)
---
- give a free SP remap for toons who had their SP turned to injectors
---
Rorquals.
---
Moving rorquals from static boosting ships to active mining ships imho was one of the best decisions from CCP.
---
Before that mining and industry  was useful only for people with a ton of accounts, this opened these extreme (imho) fun aspects of the game to everyone.
---
The problem with rorquals was the same as all capitals, excessive proliferation because of injectors.
---
I disagree with statements about Rorquals too difficult to kill or the need of new nerfbats.
---
First of all they are the biggest industrial ships in the game, they should not be easy to kill.
---
Second they are freaking expensive compared to the income they give (think about it related to a ratting super).
---
And what's the point on yeld nerf? People will scale up and put more rorquals on field thanks to injectors (meh...).
---
Make rorqual training hard and long as in past, and not a matter of minutes and credit card and you solved also this problem without affecting the opportunity for people to enjoy mining and industry.
---

Smartbombing battleships are not a good gatecamping mechanic, it requires the gatecamper to dedicate ~3 accounts to ships that cannot fight back whatsoever, completely removing the content you would once get from busting the camp, since they'll warp off when threatened. At best you can hotdrop them and get an easy kill, but you won't get the interesting fights you used to.
---
What? Seriously, you think that defence just grew on trees? It's taken a lot of players cooperating with each other, to get safe in nullsec just to go out and do some ratting and mining and even then, there's still a high chance of getting dropped on. Put your own effort in and stop crying about our successes.
---
You don't need a cloak, the main advantage of a BLOPS is being able to hit your bombs with your finger over the Jump To . . . button.
---
If you don't want wardeck, don't have structures. If you want structures, be able to defend them but don't complain if they die. You're playing Eve Online, not Wow.
---
I was just briefly talking on the same vein to someone yesterday. The wars I had from the second half of 2006 to the first half of 2008 were great (some fleet lag-outs notwithstanding) with lots of roams even with just frigs and whatnot. I really want to do PVP now again, but 0.0 really doesn't seem to be the place for it anymore, and FW... still very conflicting (hah) reports about how it is.
---
And why can't you do just that in nullsec? Yes, because half the galaxy is blue. And maybe cap umbrella?
---
You are your own worst enemy. CCP is trying to act for your own good.
---
I kinda thought half of hisec, were just null sec industry and market alts anyhow?
---
Given how long respawns take, unless you have a million accounts doing it in different belts I don't see AFK-ratting as particularly lucrative either though. With a "normal" player's average available login time, I'd be surprised if you got anywhere near renewing subscription via bought plex. Or alternatively earnings per spawn has gone WAY up from when I used to kill stuff in 0.0.
---
```and who aside from Horde can and will give a good fight?```
---
If you don't see the fact that only one group in the game will even consider giving a subcap fight, and that's out of choice rather than necessity, as an issue then you're beyond help.
---
I mean they destroyed the whole game when citadels were released so ya
---
You got it wrong, we went North, because we got bored of mining and needed a change. WE actually didn't need to deploy to Tribute at all. It gave us something to do and of course, we need to keep NCPL from getting big again so they were the obvious choice of target.  
---
We're not getting smacked by Drifters. They're dying now our fleets are home. So maybe remember your place, when we come for you pubbie?
---
calling it now - most likely it will just cover more systems than before, still sticking to the same mechanics as before... or they will just move to highsec or some shit, people will ride that CCP dick nonetheless, but citadels wont get killed.
---
You'd need a looooooooooot of smaller ships to do it. I can't really say how many, I've never fought a titan personally. But even a regular carrier or dreadnought takes a decent gang. But as said even if you had the firepower - and self-repair capability - to do it given time, most likely the capital ship has allies on hand on land on you when you're engaged. It's a common trap tactic.
---
Can you read and comprehend the english language is a better question lmao
---
Flair checks out as what? Do you not know what a meme is?
---
The problem isn't the ship they're flying, it's the response group and all the issues discussed by OP are pointing to that. Ships with slower warp times is a good thing for catching ships, especially bots - however small of an improvement it may be. You'll find both Domis and Myrms have that.
---
Just sounds like you're salty that it'll be harder for the afkers to feed you free kills. You want to talk about flair, go get some of your 17,000 toon friends to come with you. Test is just as much part of the problem as every other megabloc.
---
I'm actually glad we got rid of bubble citys on gates. They were the worst and prevented movement through nullsec, locking everyone down into a few systems, unless in a fleet (boring).
---
You mean like Occators or Mastodons, which have room for burst jammers? Or Procurers with drone bays? Have you done any thinking at all about your argument before you made it?
---
the already did NOT do that, so might as well leave that H word at the door...

Except player's wallets doesn't need to be defended and never had been. It's the things people buy with their wallets. And that has been a reality since day 1 that if you undock anything, prepare to lose it.
---
Hello there...
---
It isn't. You have to be a corp director of the citadel's owner to modify fittings aka rip rigs. Gunnery is access list based. You can assign gunners who are unable to change the fit.
---
I mean most of what you said was not true. That's kind of the definition of lying.
---
Either you are lying, were missinformed or you were in a very odd corp enforcing those rules.
---
You're right, this is only a fix to put sticks in wheels of defense fleet, but in the end it won't prevent the cap umbrella to drop on your head. It will just give attackers a bit more time to either kill their target or leave, 1 or 2 minutes can make the difference between successful gank or a welp. I don't think there a magic fix, but i'm sure there's a bunch of thing to do around cynoes/inhibs etc

No obviously you bring 150 slaved, blinged and linked Ikit’s and all of you spool on the fax and you auto win lmao u dummy
---
TBH the implication I've gotten from this - and a few things I can't talk about due to the NDA - is that CCP thinks the community is to blame for the game's current state, not their shitty game design decisions, which is incredibly troubling to me personally.
---
yes exactly
---
And the 100 ferox/supers are not looking for easy kills?
---
It's what everyone does, the difference is that there is almost no reason to camp in the first place now. So no one is getting their kills.
---
Capitals won't be balanced until they occupy a different niche to subcaps altogether. Change my mind.
---
Right now caps are just bigger better subs.
---
No, it's increasing their activity, how they engage, as well as introducing drifter capitals.
---
I miss low sec pirating and that oh shit feeling when 3 ships blinking red ships showed up on your overview. Now it's all just gang gang bang bang.
---
Rorqual is still ok against gank. A lone super or carrier is still shit and you know why.
---
Yeah peraps they should put a timer on a cyno.
---
And remove the timer for not XL structure and just 1 for XL, i totally agree with this!!! Structure should be treat like a big ship, you must kill it in one time.
---
but drifter are shit : if you rat and they warp to you, you have no time to gtfo, it s really a punishment and something wrong, you should have some time.
---
Local channel text to speech in the voice of Every college dudebro who's assured a job at his daddies law firm.
---
Whatever you listed in this big wall of text, has no impact on the fact that people will always group up and consolidate - you can tweak the mechanics however you want, destroy all titans and citadels in game, whatever - people will still adapt and keep grouping up and consolidating because this is very much in human nature and no game mechanics will prevent it.
---
Actually this would be kinda cool. Use it to drop evil bastards in a region to shit up a places (Goonswarms) mining and ratting.
---
Would that make the taking down of a Titan a rare event that's almost never actually occurs?
---
Me no as a solo player i really prefer to see vni in space than domi or arma that are very good BS.
---
As long as empire builders are blamed for empire building, leaders for diplomacy, crabs for crabbing and all this stuff  I don’t think some should be protected from this.
---
Because I've played eve long enough to see the trend of half-baked features?
---
Should I ever be concerned about which race's systems I'm in? I'm a newb Caldari messing around with some hauling, I occasionally end up going into Gallente systems. Is this basically just fluff is it something I should be considering when I take contracts or trade?
---
CCP needs to    :        
---
* lock how many skill points you can extract. Alts need to start generating costs again. Like at most 50% trained SP is good direction               
---
* lock how many SP can be injected per  char and make injectors later work as accelerated training and not let you have new rorqual alt on day1            
---
* boost mining barges and or remove excavators. Game were you can build capital fleet  only as a member of big block will die out          
---
* Boost NPC stations that they offer same bonuses like T2 riged M structures .  But reasonably like name of the station specify what specific bonus it have. Taxing can be higher but it will let smaller players compete with others
---
... at the same time still keeping strong incentive to own structure. You can have specific bonus in area you want.              
---
* Boost NPC nullsec income so groups like old BL can come back and harass sov areas around            
---
* remove all frigate burners from null agents for the same reasons
---
Of course it's completely different than Rainbow Six Siege :) 
---
&gt; I’m just trying to figure out what I even want to do. 
---
Yes that's exactly what I'm doing. Investing time and energy researching a bit before joining gives you a head start in game so that you make best use of your time starting off with the areas of game play best suited to what you're most likely to enjoy. I think it's also worth remembering that "burnout" are issues regularly mentioned by the more experienced players suggesting those people might have had better results if they'd chosen a different perhaps more suitable game pathway
---
Was that "ppl" really necessary lol
---
People stop crutching on 12 year olds internet slang to make points in 2019
---
It's not really particularly rare anymore, since there are so many of them and most fights that involve them involve a LOT of capital ships. You can take a look at https://zkillboard.com/ - in the front page you'll currently find 4 titan kills in the list of most valuable kills from the last 7 days.
---
You know with the 10-15 man gang you are killing the game to solo player like 100man are killing yours.
---
so you jump to your cyno as you see a ceptor jumping thru the other gate up the pipe, assuming you have 2 blops that means 4 accounts now, and then you sit there in system with an aggro timer for at least 2 minutes by the time you can drop a mobile depot to refit a cloak. assuming that the black screen isnt too long and that you land close enough to the cyno and not too close to the gate to actually get the inty...  
---
seems pretty impractical
---
and goons are mainly pvper's ? LOL
---
Heres a semi-relevant story: 
---
This starts around 2017. My corp and I were a mid-tier "small gang" corp. We weren't the best but we definitely had a handful of stand out players and enough enthusiasm to get other people out and playing.
---
Mind you the game was already in a pretty bad state for corps like us at the time, but Horde really revitalized us because one of our big initial activities was playing around with them when they were still in fade. Horde was still reasonably new and we did a lot of small gang around fade and pure blind when they were still staged out of the keepstar there. We staged in X-7 and sometimes went up to visit darkness space but horde was good content most of the time. 
---
We flew your usual mix of mid-tier nano-trash, nospreys, gilas, jackdaws, some nano BCs, and some meme-ships you get the idea. We fought outnumbered vs MJD BS, lots of cheap T1 tackle, recons, sniping Nagas, etc and overall it was pretty fun. We occasionally fed, but overall did pretty good on isk and fights. Not only did they fight in subs but they also weren't comfortably capital capable yet (some amount of correlation there probably, they didn't not fuck us out of the goodness of their hearts I'm sure).
---
So that was us, a small independent corp, part of the sandbox, trying to do shit.
---
Skip forward about a year, we joined an alliance that we then left, and we gave a serious go at going back to our roots. The game had continued to go down the road it had been going down over that year that we were totally lost. Horde was not the alliance we remembered, and good for them, they evolved and changed and did what they had to do. Capitals were a constant and our nano-trash just didn't work anymore. We had people in nomens who simply got volleyed by SS fighters going 10K m/s, 5-6K m/s invincible ramjags or max tank tackle stabbers that a 3-4 man nano gang was totally unable to deal with. We sorta beat our heads against this for a while but it was a pretty sad state. We couldn't really do the thing anymore, our activity went down as a result.
---
So in a pseudo "last hurrah" we tried something pretty different, we planned a big raven roam. We just totally scaled up what we usually did and our fleet was pretty solid (for us), 6 to 7 ravens, 2 vultures, 3 scimis and some assorted secondary stuff (think we had a huginn). We figured that we needed to scale up to be able to engage the new threats, ravens weren't ideal but we didnt have the sp/isk to go big on leshaks. We knew we would be vulnerable to fighters but with good piloting, MJD play and logi we were confident we could at the very least exist on a grid for an extended period of time and attempt outplays.
---
Happenstance meant we took this roam to brave space. First of all, roaming in battleships is total cancer, this is something that we knew, we weren't strangers to nano BS and often fit 1-2 hypers and 2-3 nanos on them to make up for it. But man moving an actual group of people in battleships through is total actual cancer. We spent hours just going through the motions, seeing absolutely no one through extended parts of null-sec.
---
When we finally got there (it would have been GE-), well, nothing happened! We killed a thing or two that we caught with inties, but an entire alliance stay docked as we sat 500 from their staging fortizar. They had plenty of people in local, probably significantly more ratting in nearby systems. We hanged around for 30-45 minutes jumping back and forth until we just gave up and took the long trip home, during which we also saw nobody. We didn't really have the mobility to shotgun and split up, we were fat and predictable and outside of a proper fight, couldn't really do anything at all. In many ways we were expecting a ferox form or something like that, we probably would have fed the whole fleet for 0 kills but we got nothing. In the end we spent about 4 hours doing absolutely nothing. 
---
We then also tried C2 rage-rolling and did alright. Unfortunately while its true that we got to places a little faster with wormholes, it rarely actually resulted in good fights on the other side.
---
Whats the moral of the story? Idk, but when people ask me why I'm bitter I'll link them this post. We tried existing in the sandbox, doing things at our scale, and even adapted to the gameplays that we needed to engage in to exist (not everyone in our corp was a small gang piloting god, but everyone accepted that small gang type gameplay was our main avenue to be able to engage in the sandbox with our size). It really feels like we've been beat over the head with where the game has been going in the past 5 years (slowly but surely). But hey, we're trying really hard at this "adapt or die" thing people keep spouting and we really like our community, so now we're in fucking high-sec trying all this war shit. At least there's no caps even if citadels at small scale are total cancer.
---
I'm sure CCP will get us eventually and we'll quit or join TEST. Thats what the cool kids do right.
---
I am glad for the drifters. I never knew how bad people were foaming at the mouth to see null fail until now.
---
r/eve: POS suck, give us citadels

also r/eve: Citadels suck, give back POS

Wait, whats happening to the VNIs?

Get CCP to agree and *then* ask for founding mate.

Wouldnt delve become highsec with genocide inflicted upon the npc pirate population? No more null ore or anoms. No cynos.
---
Nerf incoming, you won't be able to launch 5 heavy drones anymore.
---
Rip 20m ticks when ratting
---
A working FW system that doesn't revolve around PvE and has no access to missions for crashing lp markets.
---
Reason this would be bad for CCP to implement? The devs who did it would have made everyone else look even worse at their jobs.
---
Amen, I love fozzie sov but there is 0 reason why goons with 30k+ 24/7 tz coverage should have the same vuln windows as a 1-2k alliance. Right now being a single tz alliance isn’t viable in a game where people can change their sov in a week and completely control citadel exit timers. Large alliances should be subject to wider rf windows (in both sov and citadels) and the attackers should have input on them.
---
RIP AT
---
Veldnoughts....veldnoughts for everyone!
---
Looks like on Steam it says it's until July 9th, so there's a fair chance it's the same for CCP's store.
---
never understood people who take drone ships to conduits.
---
do people not read the system affects?
---
After a BB drop in delve I got split up from the fleet and had to gate back alone... then this shit happened about 6 systems away from the drop, going a different route than our in-hole too.

Yes not one... but two titan boson on a gate for one measly steatlh bomber! tbh I was flattered more than anything despite it being polarized. ;*(
---
Cynosaural fields should have a rule which is tied to the Star of the destination solar system. Depending on the type of Star would give rules and restrictions to the type of ships that could use the Cyno along with mass restrictions and a time delay.
---
??? you just sit on a gate decloaked, with an alt leaving a covert cyno always running in a deepsafe nearby
---
if whatever you smartbomb is bait you click jump to and bail

now they are only there to (begrudgingly) vacuum up mercoxit

It's even funnier now that Gobbins has told us we agree with goons 🤭
---
/r/eve integration.
---
Just saying but to me it sounds like weakness and everyone should take this chance to attack goons with ccps help.......
---
But such a bonus. Like when your bonus is bigger then your salary.
---
&gt; but they are just better at concealing their expressions.
---
until they become EVE online players, or Reddit posters. Or even worse, both.
---
You have no idea how fast goons can headshot an incursion
---
procurers are spooky, especially for light tackle and even AFs. Battleship-level tank, bonus to drone dps, and possible scram/web in the mids.
---
industrials like the clownshoe nereus are used as either cyno bait or cyno logistics ships too because of their retarded regen.

Low Sec gate to Stain

What is “use all the tools and mechanics available because that’s how this game works”
---
It's only an issue if your [faction standing](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_standings) is below -5.0.
---
And we didn't have to work for it before? Tell me, highsec-kun, how nullsec works.
---
come to INIT, we fly well Abaddon ;) With Arty on it :D
---
Post 'em if you got 'em.
---
There's a problem with permissions when it comes to citadel gunning rights. Granting gunning rights also grants the ability to refit (sabotage) citadels. Also, you need the CEO to kick somebody that's afk in a gunner seat from said seat.
---
Removing injectors is a fantasy, it's never going to happen and we shouldn't even be wasting time on it as a possible solution.
---
The real question is *why* is everyone injecting into supers and rorquals? It's because they're flat out better than everything else. You can't have "end game" ships that are flat out better AND have injectors, that's fucking broken in a way that we normally call "pay to win". Injectors aren't going anywhere, so these ships need to be reduced to a specific, niche role to ensure they're not the best choice for every situation. Then proliferation doesn't matter anymore.
---
Jesus christ you're retarded
---
That's a serious loss though! For instance I read in a well known Forbes article that these "Titans" cost or are worth in real world money close to $3,000, the article was from 2014 so may be out of date but even so it gives an idea that these are very valuable ships so I can imagine the players would suffer enormously because of the loss of this type of ship
---
So basically you're telling me that CCP, for 3 years now has been buffing nullsec to the point where its so overpowered that it threatens the health of the game, often to the detrement of literally everyone else and now they're blaming the playerbase for it? That's about as disconnected from reality as you can get.
---
On point 4.
---
Is that because people who are not simply line members have been working their arse off trying to manage this 'feature'?
---
yes, but the ACL is mindbogglingly (thats a great word btw) inefficient, and really needs a change.
---
Lol what bro. Maybe you should cut some blues before acting like eve is too easy and theres nothing you can do.
---
Is this Jita local?
---
Aw man, the first few weeks after we moved to gem initially were awesome. Everyone and their mothers came to fight us, it was content central
---
Yeah shadow of Mordor has about the greatest tutorial sequence in any fantasy game, possibly any game period. Moved you so fluidly through the mechanics while telling the introductory story. Perfectly done together.
---
&gt; Boost NPC nullsec income so groups like old BL can come back and harass sov areas around
---
&gt; remove all frigate burners from null agents for the same reasons
---
Boost NPC nullsec income but also delete the most lucrative form of NPC nullsec PvE? What? How is that supposed to work?
---
Because they want silver too silly. That is how it works right? Zero effort copy paste and get rewarded the same.
---
True but the other side of the coin is that instead of making unpopular but necessary changes to the game you alienate a portion of the player base for no benefit. There is little to rejoice in the fact that ccp shits on everyone equally instead of fixing known issues that are highlighted in OP’s post
---
I hadn't thought of it that way, so an average citadel density of 7 per system in HS.  Wow
---
This makes a lot of sense regarding all the nonsense we see from Ccp
---
&gt; https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008988/
---
CCP isn't very good at balancing Eve or creating incentives for multiple types of game play at once. This should be pretty obvious by now.
---
So what would be wrong with Anticapital subcapitals?
---
Are they features If they aren't the stats the npcs have?
---
Yes, they are.
---
Do it

For the longest time mining was primarily a corp activity. People mined in groups toward a goal, like building an outpost. Or people mined in groups and sold the ore to the corp industry guys, who then built stuff with it. Corps held regular mining ops because mining alone was very risky. And wow, the whole economy worked just fine.
---
Now people got so spoiled with overpowered shit that they think the world is going to end if they can't park 4 of their own rorq alts in a belt by themselves and mine in complete safety under a super umbrella. But I guess when your only reason for playing is to fund yet another super alt with another two dozen injectors then not being able to print isk on the regular becomes a real problem for you.
---
You are looking at the wrong stat. They've killed 200b total during this event.
---
i would be interested in seeing how a bot corp would react to being hell camped
---
Also adding turrets and gun bonuses. Pretty much turning it into an under powered Vexor
---
I can't believe im upvoting this guy.
---
Few more things to add:
---
Add NPC POCOs in NPC null, that cant be killed, subject to 10% tax but that can be lowered via standings with the faction?
---
Get some better mining missions?
---
Overall I think a lot of people are forced to join in null blocks, because sometimes this is the only option... If you can beat them, join them...
---
And to make some kind of income you need to join big ass block that can hold space to enjoy some of the benefits or get some decent income. NPC Null really needs some love...and improving it might drive more people there.
---
Damn. All those perfext drone skills.... Wasted

The junior FC comment hit me in the feels. Gone are the days I can hand out a fleet and go do something meaningful. I’m not going to go shoot astrahaus 1 out of 50 for “fun”. I feel there’s minimal things I can do to try and generate content with under 20 people. So now instead of trying to make content I just wait for big fleet pings.
---
Even better coming to a store near you. A trinocle for only 5x the price. It's like getting 2 for free if you waned a monocole. Only $240.
---
fuck goons
---
T2 ships also only have 2 rig slots
---
Have you heard about the mighty Ishthar. and or the gila
---
It's completely fine to only do industry related stuff or whatever, that's up to you. I use my main account to do PvP and fleet stuff with my corp, and I have a second account sitting around Jita/Perimiter (A big trade hub) to do trading and manufacturing for profit.
---
I would honestly just get started and try out to see if you like it. 
---
Something I'd do right away is create a second or even third account (Use your referral link! It'll give them 750k SP) and start training them by filling up the queue for 24 hours. 
---
Especially if you start doing a lot of industry it is nice to have alt accounts with 5-10 extra industry slots for example. Worst case is that you have extra accounts you don't use when it only costs a minute to log in and drag some industry skills into the queue
---
This is an awesome idea ... but :
---
It would be reasonable to look at other crowdfunding done to get a idea of what you can expect. 
---
Judging by the very successful crowdfunding for books by Andrew Groen ([https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sciencegroen/empires-of-eve-volume-ii](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sciencegroen/empires-of-eve-volume-ii)), it seems really hard to believe that a kickstarter would be able to reach funding for such an ambitious project. 
---
The second kickstarter was done with full support of the community, and with very high confidence in the result (as everyone was able to see the quality of the result of the first crowdfunding). As such it seems to me impossible to get more money for a new project with lot of unknown regarding the result.
---
So, in the very very best case you get around 100k$ for your project what can be realistically done with that ? (I have no idea but I guess looking at similar kickstarter project and look at the result might give one some expectation). 
---
A more probable outcome is that this would turn very quickly into a debacle such as the foutain war kickstarter. And that kickstarter which began with support of a rather important part of the community.
---
Another point that might be problematic in your project is the choice of "Templar One". I believe the community is rather divided on that one so you may encounter unexpected opposition (see : [https://imperium.news/all-i-want-for-christmas/](https://imperium.news/all-i-want-for-christmas/)). 
---
More importantly the story is about the immortal soldier of dust514 and not a story about capsuler (what the player incarnate in eve online). 
---
Although it is interesting, the game sadly does not exist anymore and that will make it harder for you to find an audience. If you like Tony Gonzales the  “The Empyrean Age” would be a more logical choice (and begining with the first part of the story would be kind of logic :p).
---
In my opinion the main problem of going for those book is that you will need to have interpretation for very (very) charismatic and complex character such as Otro Guriashi, Jamyl Sarum, Muryia Mordu to cite only a few. Every eve capsuler have very strong opinion about those characters. I do not believe it is achievable to manage to get such interpretation with realistic funding. You are looking to a project as ambitious as Alejandro Jodorowsky's Dune !
---
It is reasonable to think there is real possibility for a nice short film. 
---
CCP has already made a great number of "trailer" that were well receive (from my perspective at least). 
---
And there is a number of fan made video that were rather successful. Taking inspiration from that you could make a (very) short film in the same spirit. That would serve as a base to show what you could do and what you would like to do and then you could launch a kickstarter for a more ambitious project (while still being reasonable like a short animated film ... ).

&gt;Thanks, this is rather sound advice. I've been wanting to find a game I can truly commit to, but have never managed so far. It's one of the driving points as to why I want to play this game, having heard the countless experiences of people who've played for decades, or so.
---
there is a lot to learn, so focus on fundamentals and basics, be ready to lose things. losing things is part of the learning curve. id train for frigs/destroyers and determine what you want to do for money. faction warfare in lowsec is a place to learn PVP and earn money.
---
&gt;I just see it as CCP giving NCPL a lifeline so they don't die a quick and fast death due to having their regions completely glassed.

eve online is suffering.
---
Being a solo PvP'er I tried to continue playing Eve for awhile. Even when they removed links and OGB's I would roam around and some of my last nights playing I would roam around null for 3/4 hours and get absolutely zero content. Unless I went into someones staging system (often suicide) nobody would bother with me.   
---
Got pretty shitty, after a 3 hour roam and nothing accomplished I kind of looked at my time investment and said screw the game. Lack of gatecamps and citadels practically merging everyone into hub locations, a lot of null seems dead.  
---
Another thing that should be mentioned, is the moon mining rebalance...  
---
POS's used to be used as moon mining, in NPC null they were all frequently fought over. About every 6 months an alliance would roll through, burn everything, drop their own towers, then they would become fought over. etc. It generated content. I've never seen anyone fight over the new moon citadels. It's just too much of a time investment for no reward.
---
I personally don't think the Drifters are doing much of anything, they hit random citadels and have yet come back to hit one they've reinforced.  But the reason people were gushing about them early is because they represented a departure from CCPs empire-building direction of the last three years.
---
Remove local you pussies.
---
I agree  the nullblocs are the ones killing the game for a big part   they will probably be the last to leave eve with all their wealth and their docked up ships   because there is no one to fight all they do is filling their wallets  and buy ships they never undock with      all the nullers will cry to me when reading this and denying it
---
Legit. Ran out of Thorium and almost something else, can't remember. Was goood. My ship visually exploded after the bombing run but was fine :D
---
Coming from the nullsec perspective I don't think anyone actually realizes how much effort is required and how complicated it is to establish an effective defensive response. I guess us in Goons have become so effecient we make it look like "*all you do is light a cyno and more ships come*" but there is a metric fuck ton of work that was put in to establish such an environment, and there are plenty ways to exploit / get around it I won't elaborate on.
---
We essentially make it look easy, but I can promise you it takes more effort and behind on your game to save people than it does to sabre bubble something and light a cyno for dread bombs as I have been on both sides of the ball. There are many MANY moving parts that go on behind the scenes and I feel that if you pulled back the curtain and observed some of the hard work put into establishing an extremely effective \~umbrella\~ it would surprise you, and Delve still loses supers / rorquals.
---
I truly believe if people put a little more effort into the \~elite pvp\~ aspect of the game they would reap the rewards, but no one wants to do that - they would rather complain about how 'x' is overpowered vs. actually laying the ground work and foundation that would yield the desired results. Everything can be blown up in EVE - you just gotta figure out how.
---
It's safer than a mach and costs about the same?
---
I think... You were just trolling... Right?
---
mhhh Dominix :) please bots adapt to that
---
The CSM has been shit since CSM 8 or 9. It was full of null bloc candidates who see eve as a 1 dimensional strategy game and empowered CCP to bulldoze half a dozen other play styles so that coalition scale pvp and industry became the focus of game development.
---
Unfucking goddamn roles is probably one of those things I remember being requested non-stop since I started playing in 2012. Has anything changed since then? Because I guess if it has, then clearly not enough.
---

---
Because now few guys can drain value of LP just by running those missions. Pirate stores are mostly implants and we sooner get those missions removed than rework of those lp stores and introduction of new items. Look what is  happening at the guristas mission hubs. Like 95% people running those missions dont relate to the area in any other way. If we want return of those npc nullsec hunter alliances we need to allow them to have minimal control over those mission hubs again. Like old BL dread fleet was named 'crystal  fleet' for a reason.
---
And ?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the reason was that CCP understood very little can hurt organized groups outside of some backstabbing venues.
---
Eve will die also most because of the blocs   and we all know it
---
You are way too pessimistic
---
&gt; -Anticapital subcapitals.

So basically injectors and rorqs?

Lol there are already lots of not dominixs before they even announced the Nerf.

---
This isn't true is it.  What they know is they can be out-escalated, yes.  Otherwise a few harpies is usually enough to scare them off.  At least for a while.
---
If you think this is bad, you are going to have a very hard time in this thing called life, or Eve in this case. One can easily tell these people are fucking about and having some laughs.
---
It's exactly what CCP is doing. Blaming players, not shitty game mechanics. Listen to this and Hilmar and he flat out says it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr3JwrR7GBs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=131
---
You should post this in Jita local.
---
Its a good thing we have the CSM to explain to CCP why it is wrong. Do you get the impression that they are listening?
---
jesus fuck
---
Calling it now, this will be the only feedback thread in years that they actually listen to.
---
It would be broken on day 1 and let you carry anything anywhere.  They'd acknowledge it was to be fixed "soon".  In 2022, a fix will be shown at Fanfest to the 3 guys still playing EVE.
---
Lol fair point. :)
---
They have not spoken to us since they launched this event, and did not speak to us about it before hand. It has been radio silence since Wednesday outside of a single PR person.
---
Regarding the order vs chaos. I'd much rather see a strong buff to player created chaos than npcs. Titans needing to siege, nerfing doomsdays vs subcaps, mobile cynojammers killing all hardcynos on grid, reffing a structure into armor affecting the structure in some way, no notifications, services, weapons and timers for low-power structures.
---
Good thing about the drifter menace is that time zone tanking is not as attractive (you want timers in your best timezone vs the enemies worst), at least I hope that will be effect and I think it would be a very welcome change.
---
What the fuck do you mean you don't care about alphas? They make up 95% of the bots and afk ratters. It's literally ALL of your gameplay. 
---
Fucking dinobrain bitching about bad balance ideas but has no clue what the fucking issues are in the first place.

me and two buddies took our 75m fit t1 bc's out the other day and they literally dropped 15 titans and 5 faxes on us... And then they probably came and bitched about how ccp is killing the game, well frankly players are killing the game as well in their own way

I'm both highly successful in life and in Eve, but thanks for playing.
---
They're gating the changes to stain ! I'm scared !
---
inb4 they also give them damage caps and completely nullify any remote danger that they could possess to citadels...
---
Has anyone tried scanning the WHs, anoms, or or previously undetectable anoms/WHs in systems where Drifters or Triglavians invade?
---
1. Has any player run down all the connecting anoms/WHs to see if there is a Drifter turn-off switch/defensive objective that the players can neutralize and affect, without going toe-to-toe with marauding Drifter fleets?
---
2. Has anyone thoroughly scanned an invaded system, AU by /AU, to see if there is any probable Drifter structure keeping them local?
---
Most of the counter play I have read on site addressed PvE fights and in-system probes and d-scans. I assume the most effective Drifter counter play is a combination of citadel-based baiting and smaller, kitey fleets
---
I enjoy some of the Invasion salt... but I do want to know if there is absolutely no way to affect or divert the Drifter swarms. It could be a matter of win a semi-local defensive objective and the Drifters go somewhere else.
---
And nah, I have not done it: I avoid the wife aggro by playing maybe 3 hours on weekends.
---
Thank god you took the time to correct me on something that slipped my attention and everyone was fine to ignore or not notice.
---
Rorquals remove available targets for small gangs to roam around and hunt. Noone mines in mining barges any more, and even if they do, it's next to a rorq so they can be PANIC'd and then the inevitable cap/super fleet comes in. This is their issue.
---
Don't know my coalition? That is hilarious! Not only am I a recruitment officer in the largest corp in the Imperium, but I also hold a Coalition level space job. To say I don't know what I'm talking about and some random pubbie fuck who has obviously never been a member has is hilarious.
---
I totally agree.
---
Would be fun if they were actually clever NPC.
---
But that would not fix the overall problems of EVE/null sec, as some people appear to believe.
---
I still can't get over the fact that the final boss was a QTE
---
You know u/StainGuy, even if this is a supposed to be a shitpost I agree with the sentiment. I think the changes were good and reversing them is stupid and nothing more than pandering by CCP.
---
I was thinking about:
---
&gt;CCP thinks the community is to blame for the game's current state, not their shitty game design decisions
---
This seems very dangerous and more of a long term thing. Have you told them that this is not the case and are they listening?
---
This 1000x. It's not an issue if everyone in the game skill injects into HACs. Rorqs, supers and titans are inherently unbalanced and cause issues because for some stupid reason they're only balanced around hoping that there's not many of them in the game.
---
Unfortunately not in Fade yet :(
---
No, it's just immaterial to the statement.  You didn't say, "Don't anchor what you aren't prepared to defend in especially lucrative space."  You said, "don't anchor what your aren't prepared to put the effort in to defend".
---
Well, the problem i see is that it´s random.
---
Imagine you (your alliance or whatever) is fighting another alliance and your side is doin well in that conflict because you are smart at the wargame. Now, drifters show up and kill you beachead, or staging cit, or crucial ansiblex, something like that. And suddenly the other side might have the upperhand because of RANDOM ROAMING NPC. 
---
(atm it appears they are random)
---
Gr gon hat gon right?
---
Quit being a little bitch and learn to read.
---
I mean, obviously?
---
NOOOOOOOOO
---
BALLLLLLLLLLLLS
---
In reality their try to help frat and skillu did actually kick off the first northern war (did we have a name for that?) - the one with x47!
---
The reason imperium deployed was that IF test would fall to these guys (Winter+Skillu+panfam) who would be next? So forces were originally deployed to force them to stay home with their supers and giving legacy a chance to hold, which they did.
---
I am not a fan of any of this coalition bullshit on either side but ccp/the game is forcing everyone into this just as suitonia wrote. The fact that you can counter everything with a lot of caps and therfor have almost no risk is the worst dynamic in the game. Capital application needs a STRONG nerf (btw there is a bug with ewar on fighters that we have been reporting but...) and dromis/ need to be removed or their role changed.
---
then again they also took out the advanced audio settings because "who even uses those lol"
---
a PVP opt out
---
Maybe they changed it back to foil attempts to test bots on SISI?  (he says with fingers crossed)
---
Not really. Drifters create an infinite amount of work for you if you own no more than a single structure in space.
---
That kinda sounds like what we know of CCP opinion on the matter. You know, the folks who introduce current mechanics as they are and proceed to blame community for not wanting to burn themselves trying to maybe wreck someone else's shit.
---
Tbh I think it's not very sustainable to expect someone to do sub-optimal stuff on purpose, just so that more people could screw around. Because at some point someone who refuses to do so will just replace whoever we're talking about.
---
Game needs to support desirable gameplay the most, that's first and foremost.
---
Yeah I was worried that the iki might have dominated, shame
---
I bind mine to Z and X respectively, I find it quite a bit faster and easier compared to using ctlr-mousewheel.
---
Not yet. I've always tried to be a collaborator with CCP and get away from the adversarial nature the CSM has historically had with them. I now kind of see why it's necessary, and I feel dumb for not seeing it before.
---
This was the most comprehensive and informative comment yet. I like your ideas, especially regarding splitting it into two projects, a short film as a prelude to larger project. 
---
The reason I picked Templar One is the exceptional storyline, and the fact it is not in fact based around capsuler storylines. It is my opinion that movies from games doesn't generally do well, but a properly produced movie from a book is far more successful. There is lot more to the EvE universe and it may help it appeal to people's outside the game if the film isn't focused on the players, but instead the world. This also makes rights a lot easier, imo. But yes, might choose other settings. 
---
I totally agree with your ideas for the most part. Thank you so much for the links. I'll be trying to get the project on the way over the next few months.
---
Good point. What I was planning on. Still trying to figure out how best to contact them.
---
It would literally only serve to enrich them.
---
Here's a suggestion - Maybe Titans shouldn't be able to kill T1 BC's efficiently, so they're forced to bring things you'd have a chance of fighting?
---
Well you’ve proven yourself to be retarded.
---
And still they supported alliances with large amounts of isk and other things behind the scenes the devs are biased
---
I don't know what class of wormhole you're looking for, but often starting out in low sec can lead to discovery of empty wormholes as they get a lot of wormhole signatures. It's not unusual to find an empty c2/c3 with low sec statics. Sometimes scanning deeper you'll find an empty c4 too. Of course, some of these holes may be less than ideal if they have a spatial effect that conflicts with how you would like to play, but some of the effects aren't all that important if you adapt.
---
  Well if that is true, that topic should be on the frontpage and EVERYBODY should talk about that!!!  
---
And i have to say they are completely wrong on the one side but also right on the other side.
---
Imagine as a company you would have to deal with those megalomaniac and narcissistic null leaders, like mittens and gobbins.
---
Eh, one thing is losing something to a player who outplays you (this time), another thing is to regularly pay tribute in throwaway ships and less throwaway hours to some NPCs who, despite their appearance without warning, still fight in a rather straightforward and uninteresting manner.
---
im sure other alliances have rorqs too, it will be ok

**Pwoactive defence is no wongew needed fwom sov howdews, and now defence is mostwy aww weactive.**   
---
dewe used to be a time whewe standing fweets actuawwy mattewed and awwiances pwoactivewy defended deiw space by camping (see above) and woaming and deawing wif intwudews, dis gave daiwy content to de campews and awso to nanogangs/woamews who came to fight dem. Now, dat nevew happens anymowe. Instead evewyone just sits on deiw staging keepstaw in capitaws weady to jump to whatevew gets tackwed. I dink dewe needs to be some kind of wewowk ow bawance awound cynosuwaw fiewd mechanics, de cyno inhib, ow de powew of unsuppowted capitaw ships vs subs, to make pwoactivewy defending space impowtant again instead of just being awt-tabbed out waiting fow a ping on discowd as de best defence stwategy.   
---
wowquaws and PVE capitaws tie into dis too, whiwe in de past a handfuw of tech I cwuisews couwd shut down sevewaw systems of an awwiances space if dey did not come to fight dem. wowquaws wequiwe a vewy heavy, expensive twigwavian doctwine ow a fweet in de size of 50+ in owdew to weawisticawwy kiww. What dis has done is kiww off a wot of de dwunk cawacaw woams, sowo woaming and smaww-scawe fweets, and pushed evewyone into de same doctwines, and consowidated a wot of smaww PVP gwoups togedew, dis awso means dat fow an awwiance to weawisticawwy defend dey awso need to be abwe to get togedew 50+ peopwe, which has fuwdew consowidated evewyone. No-one gets 15 cawacaws togedew to defend because no aggwessing awwiance is going to be in someding dat 15 cawacaws can fight because if dey awe dey can't kiww anyding dat isn't an AFK VNI ow wattwesnake. Again, dis is anofew smaww scawe escawation chain dat has been wemoved and Juniow FCs have had deiw wowes diminished heaviwy in nuwwsec. dewe awe no wongew much objectives fow a yuwng aspiwing FC to take pawt in, so what we have is a bwain-dwain and heavy focus and buwnout on existing content cweatows and FCs, and it's much hawdew to bwing new bwood into de fowd.

wowquaws awe stiww faw too effective at mining, and I weawwy want to see capitaw ships abiwity to PVE be diminished. CCP has focused a wot of de daiwy content now awound wowquaws and watting Supews, but aww of dese wequiwe vewy wawge gwoups in owdew to effectivewy dweaten. dewefowe again, pushing evewyone to consowidate fowces, de empiwe buiwdews consowidate fow defence, and de PVP pwayews must consowidate to even be abwe to bweak de wocaw tank on a wowquaw ow kiww a 16m EHP\~ avewage non winked watting Hew in a weasonabwe timefwame befowe de umbwewwa can save it.

**Citadews** \- Citadews have 3 timews which means yuw must pwan a week in advance to attack one, dey awe often timezone tanked and de timews awe put into de mid-week whewe it is difficuwt to commit to fow an off-tz awwiance. on top of dat, de fact dat yuw have 3 timews and often sevewaw days to pwepawe fow de finaw timew means yuw can batphone awmost evewyone on yuw bwue wist and have dem be abwe to make de timew. dis means dat a citadew bash is mowe wikewy to wead into a gwand stwategic wevew contest, ow simpwy a Wednesday mowning 4am wocaw time gwind if it's not going to be defended. It awso means it's hawd to manipuwate de scheduwe of a specific awwiance.

Anyway I just wanted to say my piece and foughts on de dwiftews and cuwwent diwection of de game. uwu  
---
Ctrl-MouseWheel spreads the probes out more, Alt-MouseWheel changes the range.
---
Nice to see you're still up and running!
---
Erm, Rorqs mine goo dumbass.
---
maybe they realised it wasn't 125mb bandwith on the VNI that was the issue.
---
it was the fact that drones still have a mechanic that will engage targets until there are none remaining which requires ABSOLUTELY ZERO in put from the player?
---
When do you have the lobotomy booked for? Pi is the most brain numbing thing in the game.
---
Never said it would actually happen, just said it would technically be smarter lol
---
Walking in stations.
---
Too soon?
---
I don't know what gave you the impression I don't shoot at those too!
---
it appears to me as like goons used this drifter invasion as excuse to withdraw from structure bash in the north which burned people out, while saving their face.
---
The last sisi patch had some things we usually only ever saw on Chaos (such as the wisBehaviourClass attribute), and the VNI changes were only in the client's data but not on the server's. 
---
It is likely that we simply got a little accidental sneak peak at some internal branch with last week's sisi patch, and that the VNI changes were not meant to be put on Singularity yet. This patch reverted most of that last patch, bringing things back to "normal".
---
So no need to panic yet, we'll get our VNI changes soon enough I reckon.
---
He already hand drew that on orange paper, then photographed it, what more do you want? :)
---
Oh ... we will go to HS! Don't worry about that.
---
They dont oneshot caps tho nor do aoe. This is what he means and it would be a fitting idear!
---
Not really, most of the CSM are chill as fuck when you get them in a room, it's just fun to pretend to be an asshole on the internet.
---
&gt; It gave us something to do
---
Eve 2019: Where you take a break from rorq mining to go shoot undefended structures.
---
Sounds like fun being in goons.
---
i thought this was a serious post until i read "roaming in 2019"
---
Honestly this comment gave me cancer
---
Might be able to arrange.
---
Well that's why you use your computer's sound mixer to mute eve like he said
---
It fit with the game, and it wasn't totally QTE.
---
The combat itself is QTE just with freedom to pick the QTE you want
---
You're way to pessimistic, enjoy things more my dude.
---
Link these threads?

Bionicle lmao

A lowsec gate to Stain
---
Surprisingly accurate
---
Sec status still matters though.  The ihub upgrade is a multiplier, not a replacement.  -1.0 is better than -0.5, though of course whether it's significantly better is moot.
---
People used to complain that their orgs had to spread out and that they wanted to hang together.  That's why CCP made a single system better able to support many players.  
---
Even now it's not huge.  A couple or 3 supers can make short work of the anom list.  Rorqs destroy the belts pretty quickly then wait hours for a respawn, etc. etc.  It's not like a single system can support dozens of players.
---
just search for lifeblood
---
I would counter that the real content was the legion of high sec carebears mouth breathing on FB/Reddit how null is finally getting the ass beating it deserves that they never could do themselves.
---
This particularly hit home for me too, Hear hear.
---
The issue with citadel isn't the core changes, it's the way it's balanced. You could vastly increase the health of the game by nerfing the damage cap, removing a timer for non fort / keep structures, removing guns on refineries, and/or reworking defender TZ tanking. Any or all of these changes would be good for the game.
---
The only big issue is for LS which tbh was already slowing down and yet manage to have a few brawls still, despite moon mining on a valuable scale being impossible (still laughing at people thinking moon mining in LS is the same thing as in NS). I would be fine if refineries in LS just had no active mining just like before, but yielded half or only a third of what you would get with active mining.
---
This is also killing corp-level content.  The only effective fleet comp that doesn't require massive bling or mass numbers is the assault frigate, but even that basically restricts you to hunting the VNI, which is about to  be phased completely into cyno domis.  In a couple of months even semi-afk ratters are going to be calling in supers.    
---
&gt; ...and burnout on existing content creators and FCs, and it's much harder to bring new blood into the fold. 
---
How is a new FC supposed to learn when the minimum effective doctrine is 100+ HACs?  Even if we went back to Covetor mining to create potential targets in space there are still 12+ places to tether in every system so pickings would be slim.
---
The forest fire to thin out goons and actually open up some room for everyone else is long, long over due! 
---
Keep it up CCP!
---
I wouldn't waste your time, the writings on the door. CCP are making a new mmo, I hear the ff expansion is really good.
---
It is a notable loss. The killboard actually gives a real money value estimate for kills, that one being $743. Of course, many people earn the ISK in the game. Not many would outright buy such a ship with real money - though some certainly do. But 89 billion is a lot - I certainly couldn't buy it. If I sold a LOT of my stuff, I'd be able to buy a supercarrier with somewhat reasonable fittings, but considering all the things I'd have to sell it, not currently worth it. Especially since I'm not in a corporation/alliance where I'd have a keepstar to store it in when not using it. A carrier or dreadnought I could buy easily, though I've extracted some of the skills needed for them so it'd take some training to be effective.
---
-if roaming a bs, fit a hyperspatial if you dont have the patience and self-control of a 80 year old buddhist monk

---
Limit citadels per constellation, reduce passive moon mining by 50% with an option to actively mine
---
Why? The drifters have been added as forced unfightable and bugged pve for nullsec blocks. I'm all for new content and new npcs, but the tools for knocking over the sandcastles by players should be made easier not the addition of overpowered and bugged npcs... Smacks of CCP half arsing it.
---
What the actual fuck is going on here??  48 hours prior you post about how the drifter lords were all your work and how it’s wonderful now you’re 180 around to big-null?  
---
So being on the CSM has opened your small brain a little?  Seeing the bigger picture now a bit better?   I think you’ll start to find some sense that big-null doesnt like the blue donut as it’s memed about but are merely adapted to a current mechanic in the citadel era.  
---
If ccp can put the effort needed into fixing citadels and creating some resource availability conflicts associated with sov(isotopes are the closest thing we have to this) you’ll start seeing more conflict naturally.  Not this manufactured drifter shit that fell way short of whatever goal they may have set for it (and not told us...yet).  
---
How bout... slice the R64/32 pie a bit?   
---
How bout... go back to certain citadels require certain isotope fuel blocks.  
---
How bout... ihub upgrades limiting structure counts (outside of athanors on mining beacons because the mining game is active content and definitely triggers PvP.)
---
CCP making life hard for goons, like usual.
---
Drifters are an very old NPC that has now been switched on to spawn in null sec and engage everything. They are old content and very bugged and broken.
---
&gt; Drifters ignore structure damage caps 
---
If they do, it's a bug you should report:   
---

It's not about the direct capabilities of the ship generally.
---
It's about the ease by which the large coalitions can keep them safe, which exponentially increases their power.
---
&gt; Thanks for reading this wall of letters.
---
No a wall of letter can turn into sentences that might have a goal. This is just a pile of goo that looks like letter and doesn't go anywhere.
---
&gt; 48 hours prior you post about how the drifter lords were all your work
---
That was a joke/troll post. Tell me more about small brains lol.
---
That's on you then.

You consider last week to be active? Yikes.

INIT does NOT run kikimora fleets... we run stuka fleets that include kikimora and on top of that haw dreads and carriers would run through kikimoras if they wouldnt focus my beloved command destroyers first :( i believe the same goes for tapi but not sure

why not link all those rorquals you killed with 30-40kikis?
---
Burn down -&gt; gold rush + greed = conflict?

Btw, when it was updated did they copy over the characters?

I still can't login on my characters I reactivate 2 weeks ago

What are the general penalties when you are attacked and your character "destroyed and expires at that moment".
---
[About a month ago](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/new-mirror-for-singularity-2019-06-03/163984), bad timing I guess :(
---
Wow, hold your horses there pal! 
---
They are nerfing the ship, not drones in general!
---
They still are one of the best weapon system in game, and no skill ever invested in drones was a waist! o/
---
I'm having some encounters with the third type further down in this thread right now.
---
&gt;sorry, you don’t speak for everyone and either does Mittens. There are a lot of players out there that thing this is one of the best things to happen to the game in 10 yrs.
---
I have yet to see someone explain why this is good, other than "it makes goon cry".
---
How long in does he say that form the link? Him saying they made the mistake of adding to much tools to increase comfort and removing the old way of mineral distribution doesn't sound like blaming the players to me.
---
But i don't have enough time to listen to more right now, unfortunately.
---
Bring back in station walking around, but only in jita 4-4. Catch is you can only walking around and interact by VR.
---
Yeah that's true. But it takes a few days to setup, and then like 20 minutes each day. So for 2 hours of work for 1b+ is worth it
---
How can they sell loads of extractors doing that though...
---
As a leader of a coalition; if you have 150 timer at home against a threat that you dont know anything about , it s a smart moove to come back home.
---
Of course after he is whining really too much. Also HS has nothing to do with the drifter. It s just a narrative. Stupid narrative of course.
---
Think by yourself one minute and you will understand what the narrative is covering and why.
---
What level player would you be if you're able to buy a super carrier. I've just been doing some Eve online research on youtube and have watched a video showing the relative sizes of ships and a supercarrier is not a small ship and it looks to be in the realm of elite or hardcore players.
---
That's not a ship that someone who hasn't spent significant in-game time could own unless they used a plex shortcut of course. Would you agree?

How Rorqs were imagined originally... a mobile mining platform you could take into deep null, running its clone vat bay so mining characters could jump to it, hop into their barges from the ship maint bay and mine away.  This was back in the day where outposts and pos were rare and null was kind-of empty.
---
The economics of it weren't very good though, especially given the jump range and the risk.  That's the problem with Eve in a nutshell.  There's no way to small group or solo such content.  The universe is way too small.  So the content died (was never used).  You can see the intention there though.  I dreamed of doing just that.  In the end the Rorq was used as a JF (before JF existed).
---
I think what should happen is the universe gets radically resized to make it larger, with hugely more systems.  So big that small entities can disappear, more or less, into it.  You then make resources move around.  The locust either follows the crop or if it hunkers down in one area, pickings are kind-of sparse but you can get by.  You make it possible to live out of a carrier or some other kind of mobile platforms, instead of only within fixed infrastructure.  Kind-of like Battlestar Galactica.
---
Of course again you've got the problem of the biggest locust swarm snowballing evermore and smaller groups being unable to compete.
---
I think null would be better if all groups were like tribes of nomads; a constant moveop. 
---
Anyway.... I haven't thought it through.
---
BS need their base warp speed upped to 2.5 AU/s, but that is a different topic. 
---
I had decent success finding at least some people willing to pew in GE- if I bring a T1 frig. Certainly worth the effort compared to the other 90 percent of dead-ass nullsec regions. 
---
They will generally also form for a smaller gang of people, and most of them are pretty nice, just gotta ignore the few trashy trashtalkers and trolls.
---
You are a recruitment officer, it goes entirely against your interests to acknowledge anything negative about your organization, so I shouldn't really expect you to - in any way - argue in good faith.
---
This is the time when we remember gatecamping fondly. Just let that sink in.
---
This is pretty inaccurate and not very useful to actually help people get fights, but I suppose it's decent as a sarcastic look at how bad roaming is in EVE 2019.
---
I'm pretty useless when it comes to fits, how does this look?

I've been in three different parts of the imperium and I've encountered all of those things, not necessarily all of them in the same place at the same time, but there's a lot of overlap. And no I will not get more specific about where I've been, based on the behavior of the other guy responding, there are probably people obsessive and weird enough to try and figure out in-game names and all that.
---
Damnit...
---
How come they can have 2 factor auth replicate in 24 hours but can't replicate Omega status more frequently?
---
His ping os pretty honest for one time.
---
It's just business, CCP are in it for the money, their meetings that you won't see will be about making cash from features, increasing sales of extractors and dlcs by adjust game mechanics, adding new ships. Keeping that sp shifting around. While hiding that by releasing skin sales. Getting stuff out for paydays, optimization of whales.
---
whats your take on these regions and how good they are for roaming?
---
Yes i confirm nobody. The real blue donuts is coming :/
---
As a person with very addictive personality, that have had problems ranging from gambeling, alcohol abuse and drug abuse,   
---
i honestly see no problem in the way CCP run their transactions, i have been abel to keep myself on 3 accounts, the "DLC" packs are locked to once per account and the Plex packages are rather easy to control. i simply dont buy plex.  
---
can recomend.  
---
although the time put into the game was problematic for me at... well serval times through the years and cost me probably 2 good relationships.
---
I dont see any decrease in DPS in the fitting window though
---
No, if you pay your subscription at all it's an Omega account. The problem is, doing so is a lot of work, and for most people not a lot of fun.
---
I don't think the original phrase was aimed at CCP though. Was it?
---
I'd be glad to look into the Initiative, do you know of any corporations that are recruiting?
---
Cruise missiles for stealth bombers - It is boring that a ship is limited to only half of a weapon system.
---
Civilian hulls  - We already got civilian modules.
---
Doing all that would effect the companies profit and growth.. you really think they will do that? Stop thinking like CCP care about the health of the game, they care about profit, that's why they killed sp farm alts, why they keep rebalancing ships, gotta keep the sp moving around to sell extractors.
---
You don’t do belts, you do anomalies
---
almost every corporation i would say.
---
*shrug* maybe it's broken.
---
but your drones should be slow and doing shit dps according to the system affects.
---
Hear, hear.
---
.... You can just buy plex on sisi, they're 100 isk.

All pretty much accurate to what we see. But except for the insmother/cache area.
---
Lately, we have been sowing and reaping the rewards of what is called "iron crown" they are Chinese renters and boy do they feed hard and fast. We've gotten some good escalations from them but eventually frat comes in with munin support to force you out.
---
Otherwise good write up Fabi...i mean not Fabio
---
lol, Seems like someone read the memo from "CCP Finance"...
---
I agree, but how do you limit growth? No one wants to be told they can only have x amount of this or that. Otherwise, the first alliance to achieve the limits of everything basically wins Eve. 
---
What if the number of sov systems you could hold was based on the number of members in your alliance?
---
We have been doing some awesome farming of iron crown the last month in cache and insmother. Eventually it becomes too many frat munins..
---
I know NSH is having a blast kicking SMAs teeth in querious since goons were gone. We will see if anything changes though.
---
Okay so.  
---
* People will randomly send new players money. 100m isn't that much, even if you're only moderately not space poor like myself.
---
* The guy probably put a bounty on you so he can see when you lose ships, cos he wants to see what you do with the money - ideally learn the game and have some fun and see some spaceships explode. :)
---
* Welcome to danger
---
So yeah this James dude makes some decent tutorials, so that's a good start. The "Eve is Easy" series by Suitonia is a good start to learning to fight. Signal Cartel has some great tutorials for exploring and moving around dangerous space - they're pacifists, so they'll teach you the art of avoiding combat when you're flying something that can't fight.
---
Get out there, fly dangerous. :)
---
If you cant even spare a single Gunner for a citadel you probably don't deserve to keep it.
---
Yeah I don't tend to sit on a lot of doctrine ships either. If we're flying it a lot I'll have it around.
---
This was aimed at botting. If they can program a bot to use fighters, I would imagine they could program it to attack with drones and that sort of change wouldn't impact bots.
---
Drifters are fine. Sure, they bug out a little, but event aside of that is fine.
---
Adapt. Its a fun way to prevent citadel spam.
---
Yeah that's uh...not actually happening, fwiw. We shit up local a ton and one of my regulars on my gangs is Chinese. It's fun because he can shoot back against the frat guys' insults and help us translate. :)
---
I know memefleet spews some racist shit, and I think SPVG has its disgusting moments, but that's not all of TEST, those are the views of 2-3 people being forwarded through the empty heads of npc spodbrains.
---
Imagine being this angry at someone on the internet.
---
As an example: Tenerifis is not nearly as bad as this post makes it sound like. Avoid the areas where XIX will blob you and roam [PATRIOTS/UNREAL ALLIANCE/etc. space](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Tenerifis/50-5UD) which can give pretty fun fights. Don't bring too many people or too shiny ships, they fly pretty cheap.
---
Prove that, because all fights with them have gone differently than normal drifters, they behave more similarly to diamond rats and 1 shot without their doomsday.
---
That sounds like a fun meta shift to me to be honest.
---
Time to disband I guess.
---
What's the usual return timer on bots these days? I haven't been out hunting since frat stopped running the 3 minute return timers. :)
---
Hey, just so I'm understanding this correctly, for the first point, you mean that if someone has 10m sp, they can only extract up to a cumulative 5msp? If I extract 5m sp over a few months, I would need to train up to 11m sp to extract again?
---
I don't think it would prevent farmers, all you need to do is to create alphas that you skill up for 6 months, then pay for omega, extract 5 skill injectors, then biomass. It would make it harder to skillfarm, but the current skillfarms will continue, just using a different method.
---
Fun fact, transaction history (except contracts) and messages are gone after 90 days. Assuming messages are deleted
---
Personally not sure whether there's any one reason -- or reasons -- why people are getting behind the Sleepers, but it seems to have united the community behind a collective recognition that the game has become stale and needs a shake up.  It seems like everyone's opinions vary wildly about what is bad and how it should be fixed.  The exciting thing, of course, is a huge collective appetite for change.
---
Broadly agree with the problems you've identified, but not sure about your proposed solutions. *Really* not sure I agree about your nullification &amp; gatecamping point.  For me, gatecamps have always represented one of lamest parts of 'PvP' in Eve and I was surprised to see you all of all people reference that!  I get it... nullification means people are almost invuln and there is nothing to shoot.  But *surely* there must be other ways to encourage (or force) people out into space and situations where they are required to take a fight at some point. Gatecamping is not going to revive EVE...
---
And that for me, at a very abstract level, is the biggest challenge that EVE faces at the moment -- the game does not force players into situations where meaningful and/or fun PVP can happen.  It's either the robotic big fleet stuff, or trying to force a fight against people who can easily avoid it if they so choose.  Personally, I think now is a time for innovation and new ideas about how that could be achieved...
---
First ship to jump light his cyno when the first cyno has reach limit. Have another dread or two in reserve with cyno to take the change. Just a slight pain in the ass for big cap battle but no changes at all gameplay wise.
---
Did you even read the part about cheap cats.
---
People will just use more cynos, not sure what you think this would achieve.
---
Soo, 1 overtanked [insert capital size-vessel here] jumps in, lights a cyno, another 4 jump in and light their cynos, the rest jumps in?

T2 Supercarriers with drifters as fighters. 
---

---
CCP Falcon is forced to bash strictures for 7 hours straight every week.
---
CCP Hilmar forced to mine in a Rorqual,  watching his excavators get booshed and bombed again and again and again. No cyno inhib by default in overview ofc.
---
CCP Dopamine permaban himself from CCP.
---
Add Gold Ammo for a prize of one T1 Carrier pet shot.
---
Make any interesting content for null sec.
---
This morning I noticed a cloud that resembles something from EVE. I wish I took a picture of it so I can get some reddit karma.
---
Yes did you read the part about 1 shot without the doomsday? These have more tank/dps/tracking than normal drifters combined with diamond rat tactics.
---
If you have any evidence about devs supporting alliances with large amount of ISK post-T20, feel free to present it instead of blindly accusing people.
---
The rest of us who are NOT retards know that devs cannot participate in any major player group PRECISELY because of T20.
---
Personally I think the main thing they need to do is A) increase the power of small gangs, which they've done a bit w/ Trig stuff but really need a way to deal w/ Fauxes/Dreads efficiently &amp; B) Reduce the impact of Supercapitals on Subcapitals, in order to force defending alliances to bring a fight that the attackers have a chance of winning.
---
You're still going to get blobbed, but blobbing was a thing in 2012, and roaming was fucking awesome in that period.
---
It's an awkward position for them. Trying to support a major playstyle they can't really experience directly.
---
then you'd need 1 extra injector for your cyno alt and nothing would change.
---
Yes, but its slow warp speed and ongrid speed can lead to getting blobbed.
---
They will kill the ansiblexes and cyno jammers, and if left alone long enough they’d get lucky and start killing citadels. Plus if they hang out on gates it means you can’t fly through the system without an instawarp ship. 
---
I mean, Horde isn’t even forming for the stuff outside bwf, but we need that ansiblex online for strategic reasons, so we do need to defend it
---
So in reverse Steve has to be a supervillain irl since he is so nice and helpful on the internet.
---
What if you flip the coin and it lands on the side?
---
"but but but some people threw their credit card at those titans you can't possibly expect that they shouldn't be able to do literally anything they might ever want them to do it's supposed to be END GAME geez!" -some other idiot thread sitting in new right now
---
MFW when CCP use this thread as a feedback source and implement all of the changes mentioned =\
---
Tears.
---
Yeah it fucking is
---
woooosh
---
After they were launched I watched the jumps per system across regions I was hunting in plummet. I gave up on my previously fruitful bubble camping :(
---
Is this how people have shit accomplished in EVE these days, by leaving it to NPCs?
---
Only one solution : EWAR titan :=)
---
All Hail Tyrannos!
---
It's sad because all of this fun comes from the feeling being special. If you look at it that way you could be also vegan, or lactose intolerant. Or own an Iphone. Feelings are bullshit, friend !
---
I got enough ishtar to last a lifetime during the "ishtar online" years.
---
a slimy guy going by the name of "NEAR2" opens up his umbrella and walks down the street lauging hysterically ...
---
It's not about CCP's tradional monetization model but the recent stuff. The starter pack mentioned in the title for example. Also the login rewards. It's the concept to give people the feeling of missing out if they don't turn omega. It's very similar to one of the examples just that the created time pressure is in the days instead of minutes. That difference softens it a bit but still doesn't make it ok.
---
it's not self-serving with a sprinkling of random changes
---
Ok thinking and behaviour, not ok to take the bait like that and be lazy.
---
We're explorers which means we're the prey, frequently a piñata at the same time.
---
See folks sitting and the gate, GTFO, it's often a scout party for folks from the other side.
---
The fact you ran 2 sites in null with people in local makes me nervous on its own.
---
hey guys, from 2 days in a row, when i try to rat with my vexor (not vni) i got my heavy drones killed by the first npcs in the pocket.
---
did ccp changed npc/drone mechanisms?
---
if there are 3 people with one dictor or 2 people with dictors you're just screwed.
---
I like that insult.
---
You can't really avoid bubbles in nullsec unless you have an interdiction nullified t3c or other ship that is nullified, like interceptors for example.
---
You can also make your ship so fast that it's uncatchable by most ships and maybe able to kill those that can, fast enough.
---
An Astero with t2 covert ops cloaking device could also sace you from most bubbles.
---
You need to choose direction out of the bubble then cloak+mwd and hope that they won't be able to decloak you until you warp off.
---
With Heron your only advantage is the low cost of the ship
---
Just jump in like 4 master race or local tanked dread for perma in cynos. This doesnt really do anything besides staging jump ins and possible reduce bounces. Which helps super cap blobs. Bounces are a good thing bc they can kill things that bounce hard
---
Mostly on Reddit so far, tbh.
---
They don't. It's projection. That's the whole point of the post.
---
Orange square means you are targeted by the ship red square means he aggressed you already. Next time, wait for them to aggress and then jump the gate the guy who aggressed will have a timer and will be unable to jump gates. The problem is with guy on the other side.  In this situation you need to be lucky where the gate spawns you, near him or on the other side.  To be able to escape you need a fast alin ship. I personally do relic sites in hostile space in a ceptor (ares). S-o, immune to bubbles and also can be fit with under 2 seconds align time
---
Yeah, lets drop 15 dreads on 50 Titans. 
---
They move in herds now.
---
Laziness and greed will get you everytime my friend :) You had good thinking but shouldn't have taken the gate with dudes on it. 
---
The orange light is the bubble yes.
---
Train covert ops and get yourself into an astero or covops frigate (ie cheetah) to explore in, you can warp while cloaked in those ships so that you can pulse your mwd once while cloaked in the bubble and hopefully escape without being decloaked. It's always a butt puckering maneuver though.
---
Keep trying.
---
For every wormholer that suggests a cyno change there should be an equal thread posted suggesting that cynos work inside wormholes.
---
Is it worth it farming to get Barghests bpc? Compared to other pve activities in the game, I mean
---
I thought about such things myself too. But cynos are not only used to save a rorqual or super but in normal fleet movements. Such a change would be hurtfull there and not outweight the use as in the QRF/ blobbing scenario each new ship could light a new cyno. (Would still be a nerf if a good part of the QRF is stuck immobile on a grid)
---
Nah he's also nice.
---
well looks like fun in querious is over :( https://zkillboard.com/related/30003968/201907010300/
---
Fuck him, you guys do good. Granted I didn't bug report for.. well, years, but I'm yet to have a bug not fixed after reporting it and passing the EBR to someone in CCP 
---
Even some niche-as-fuck bugs were resolved, that nobody bothered reporting in 2 years.
---
Jesus this is sad. But yes I've seen a share amount of small groups dying like this. CCP wake the fuck up.
---
Please spawn more incursions I need CONCORD Bpc...
---
You fighting against all the EVE again?
---
I know that it's a multiplier but still it makes pretty worthless space quite usable.
---
It is still somehow possible for 30k players to life in ~90 systems and being the strongest alliance to date. That shouldn't be possible, that's just plain stupid if you ask me.
---
Try disbanding.
---
Yellow square.
---
Do you skip every system you see people in local? 
---
I usually still scan down sigs when theres people in local but im always d-scanning.
---
Is that something more advanced players dont do?
---
Respec certificate for your attributes for... idk maybe 50 PLEX?
---
HAHA what did rorqs ever do to deserve this treatment ??? :-)
---
Rorquals aren't real caps so its ok
---
The only wardeccers active right now simply camp Jita and the areas around it, so you'll probably never be attacked by a wardeccer as long as you avoid it. Otherwise, there seems to be fewer wardec corps than before, the frequency of wardecs you will receive is essentially dependent on how often they see your corp hauling stuff to Jita.
---
Get back into your scram kiting kestrel.  No one has seen a drifter since ccp removed this new and exciting mechanic recently.
---
You are very good at teaching people how to fight frigates at 9500 M and 0 M and little else.
---
Can you explain this part
---
&gt; To be able to escape you need a fast align ship. I personally do relic sites in hostile space in a ceptor (ares). So, immune to bubbles and also can be fit with under 2 seconds align time 
---
Dont you have to scan the site down before you can warp/align there?
---
It'd be ok with even a 25%.
---
I agree.
---
I can see that the risk of in-game activities have been greatly diminished to the point of too safe, but not sure nullification and gatecamping are an acceptable alternative..
---
heavy neuts yo
---
PHReeeeeee. Srsly?
---
A Badger in syndicate? Guy doesn't know it's a Tayra named forward, clearly a meme post.
---
they make a big boom, not as big as a titan but it's harder to catch those with their pants down.
---
I like big booms and I cannot lie!
---
I think that wa the week my Corp made a minecraft server and we forgot about eve for like a month. Building to scale models of ships was a lot of fun
---
You should be thanked more often. So thank you!!
---
Cyno in the Cynos so they can cyno in the Blob. pretty funny
---
I don't get this.  You can still catch things if you camp.  A nullified T3 if there's a hero decloaker on grid, etc. etc.  When I used to camp in Provi most of the ships passing through were bombers, T3s and covert ops.  
---
The issue isn't nullification, it's the fact that most people don't need to gate all that often.  Since they moved to Delve my characters have never been in high sec.  Null is now pretty self-sufficient.  That's the *real* reason gate camping is a bit crap compared to how it used to be.
---
Wow, I didn’t realize one side of a coin could be physically bigger than the other. What kind of wizardry is this.
---
You will make CCP gamemasters laugh and that's about it. There are very few bannable offenses in the game, actually. Griefing new players in starter systems and botting are the ones that come to my mind.
---
Scamming, killing players for no reason, insulting other players, those are all fine and dandy.
---
With T1 exploration ships you are better off looking for a lowclass wormhole and do sites there, or find a wormhole that leads deep into nullsec so you don't have to borther with the camps on bottleneck entrance gates.
---
Eventually you'll be able to use a Astero or other covert ops ships, then you can align out of the bubble towards a celestial, cloak and MWD at the same time, they will see where you spawned after jumping in but not where you are going, so most won't be able to decloak you and you can savely warp off once out of the bubble.  
---
The trick with cloaky ships is to not just activate your warp cause if a sabre opens a bubble in that moment your ship will stop and sit still, easy prey cause they know where to decloak you.
---
You can even fit a prototype cloak on your T1 ship, can't warp with that one activated but it can still be a livesaver and you are compleatly save when sitting on some celestial.
---
You can also do bookmarks while warping and then use these spots as savespots instead of celestials.
---
Anchor like 100 of them. Just toggle the on-off switch. Roll into any hole in a matter of seconds.
---
You forgot Curse. Again. :(
---
Surely, it's a weird place with turbokrabs, a handful of PvPers and some of the worst baiters in the history of EVE who either jump your titan on you instead of bridging or feed cynobait heretics to solo Garmurs. Time seems to stand still as people still camp the same places as 10 years ago but fun fights can be had. Maybe. If you don't turboblob or bring a 30-man HG snaked gang with Tracking Computer fit Ikis.
---
Just calling out bullshit kiddo
---
I don't remember any complaining about POS besides from the people who actually had to manage them.
---
- Remove PANIC
---
- Half the cost of citadels. Give them 2x 48 hour timers. 
---
- Low power citadels have one timer
---
- Remove HAW from Titans. Make it nearly impossible for Supers/Titan to hit subs. The meta should be subs &gt; capitals &gt; supers &gt; subs.
---
- Introduce a new Cruiser class bomber. These are capable of fitting 3x Citadel launchers. A subcapital class vessel capable of destroying capitals that don't have anti-sub support. 
---
- Make dreads true glass cannons, increase damage multiplier of Siege module. 
---
- Local in null sec is controlled by a anchorable "radar" structure. Without that structure local operates like WHs.
---
So congratulations? You have to get a bit more creative with cat swarms. A bunch of hisec role players figured this shit out in a week, that the largest power blocs in the game are complaining about actually facing something that's slightly challenging for once is just sad.
---
yikes
---
It's actually not that unusal that a fast moving frig drops the first cyno for a FAX or a Carrier to jump in and light their own cynos for the rest of the fleet.
---
Cyno mass limit can be countered through more cyno's, true, and it's more of a pain in the ass, true. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it just doesn't fix the issue on its own. Whatever mechanics change to fix it has to be a bit more intricate, though. Not sure if that's expanding the 'landing area' exponentially with the amount of mass coming through, or otherwise condense it and majorly increase the crazy bump factor to break up fleets, but with Eve it's very rarely changing one thing to fix an issue. Perhaps part of the issue is splitting cynos further, into straight jump to cynos like we know, covert cynos, and specific bridge point cynos. 
---
Hard to say for sure. no matter what gets suggested, the answer, in Eve terms, is always have another alt. So do we not pursue a problem because we can just log in another alt? *Shrug*
---
Fit a cloak. After jumping decloak hit MWD and cloak. Change direction and slowly move away from the gate and the hostile ship (its an interdictor btw). Either stay cloaked until they get bored or until you're far enough away that you feel save to decloak and warp away. But honestly probably just stay cloaked while moving away from the gate and get a coffee.
---
Also search for some videos showing that stuff. It's not like you can escape everytime but you can at least try. Also check MWD + cloak trick. Doesn't help if bubbled though.
---
okay you're retarded but just to satisfy your idiot curiosity, i had a busy weekend of structure bashes and haven't had a lot of time over the past literally 5 days to run a whaling fleet
---
sorry you twat, we're not all therabois, some of us do shit other than rage roll, whale, and shitpost all day
---
ps if you're reading this starfleetcommander - stay out of the spire, last warning
---
Ok, so you had some good thinking here, couple of things :
---
- no need to check dotlan, the kill/pod in the last hour is available on the ingame map ( under statistic)
---
- a heron is cheap, but try and move to an astero or the T2 version (buzzard right ? ) The covert ops cloak will save your ass
---
- as a rule, never warp gate to gate, and scan befor goring there. If no one is in local, use the time to make some perch above said gates, but you got that already
---
- in the event you got caught in a bubble, you can use a variant of the mwd+cloak trick: once cloaked, you get one free mwd cycle. The trick is to use it to get a boost of speed while cloaked, go in one direction, then once you are cloaked, change direction to confuse them. Then slow boat out of the bubble. Sometime it works, sometimes it does not.
---
- if you have a covert ops cloaking device, do the same, except you'll go faster.
---
- if you still land in a bubble, you should still be cloaked as you landed at an angle. Just slowboat to the gate
---
- important:  once you jumped a gate, refrain from hitting "warp" at once, or do anything. Remember you have a cloak reactivation delay . Align then cloak, then warp. Got killed once because a bubble went ou of nowhere and just canceled my warp, and I was too confused  wondering what happened and I could not cloak because I was still under the 5 second delay. Lesson learnt.
---
Wait...for what
---
That's just old-school torpedos
---
tldr: go play something else
---
WALL OF TEXT CRITS!
---
Can players fight CONCORD and win? What would happen if like 1k players suddenly went to highsec and started attacking npc structures and ships? Are the npc ships and stations like op untouchable?
---
But, why would I want to be a bitter vet with a guy who won't even tell me his favorite ice cream?
---
LMFAO okay that's clever
---
It's quite hard to do. You need to roam around lowsec belts until you find a lonely Mordu's Legions ships (Garmur, Orthrus or the graal Barghest) and actually defeat them. They're not your regular belt rat apparently, but I can't say more as I never hunted them myself.
---
Once taken out, each ship has a 100% chance to drop a blueprint to the Mordu's ship you just destroyed. If you destroy a Barghest, you then have a one run Barghest blueprint.
---
I don't really know if it's worth it to farm them. But eh, if you do find one, build it. 800m isn't something to spit on.
---
&gt; I think what should happen is the universe gets radically resized to make it larger, with hugely more systems. So big that small entities can disappear, more or less, into it.
---
the only problem with this is, the only way you get conflict is if people have to compete over resources. the past 3-4 years of nullsec wars have just been over personal grudges and funsies, and those are getting pretty stale
---
I’m out of the loop, why is Great Wildlands so bad nowadays?  And whats happening in Omist?
---
Fairly accurate.
---
In general, TEST ally/renter space has been the most consistently high quality NS I've dealt with in USTZ for about a year running, mostly because they're too dumb to breath.
---
There was some changements in abyssal deadspace concerning drone aggression mechanics, but I don't know if that got exported to known space too. One good thing to do is to pull out your drones when the rats are there, pull them in quickly, and then send them out a second time once they start focusing your ship.
---
Answering the pureblind question, you may be shocked to know that most Barghest bpcs come from lowsec belts.
---
indeed. Welcome back!
---
To be fair, you bitch when drawing that card in actual monopoly if you own a good bit of the board.
---
&gt;&gt; Do you skip every system you see people in local?
---
I use https://localthreat.xyz/ to see whether they are PVP pilots. A character with only PVE losses is unlikely to attack you. If I'm even a bit unsure I'll pass.
---
DScan is fine, but you can't see ships cloaked in site or warping in with a CovOps cloak.
---
My guess is that you are an Alpha. If not: fit an improved cloak(no, not the Prototype) and learn the MWD-Cloak trick. It gives you a chance of survival.
---
And finally: Avoid taking gates with people on them. You never know what's on the other side, but if there is someone on your side they definitely do, robbing you of the element of surprise.
---
&gt;INIT does NOT run kikimora fleets... we run stuka fleets that include kikimora
---
i'm gonna go ahead and call this a weak-ass semantic argument
---
&gt;haw dreads and carriers would run through kikimoras if they wouldnt focus my beloved command destroyers first :(
---
our experience has differed, although i think that's more of a question of tactics; but at this point i know better than to give you a freebie on reddit
---
&gt;why not link all those rorquals you killed with 30-40kikis?
---
i'm at work, remind me in a few hours
---
Holy shit I didn't even know it existed. Amazing!
---
Recruit about 15 more active US amarr and it may be possible for minmil to hold onto a single US pilot for more than 2 weeks.
---
You assume way too much, my dude.  
---
&gt; That attitude will turn around when the idiot Goons start swarming highsec for a few weeks, murdering everyone and everything they come across.
---
Good.
---
Reminds me of my time with m0o and M3G4, back in the glory days.  I hope you guys enjoy it.  It's fun, sometimes.  
---
&gt; That's the thing...you ~~HSers~~ **wormholers** think "this is what we deal with", but you have no concept.
---
Sorry, dude.  I got bored with Null in 2015, and came back about 9 mo's ago to live in spooky space.  I likely have a firm grasp on every single concept you reference, having been a carrier 
---
You know what I've learned, after 13+ years of playing EVE since 2003?  The single worst thing for this game is **stagnation**.
---
EVE has stagnated for years, especially in Null.
---
This is different.  This is good.
---
&gt; We're used to dealing with super groups dropping on us while we're flying 10b ships, just to have virtually no chance of getting away and hoping our alliance has enough people online and within jump range to come join the fight.
---
Yeah, the Nullsec Meta has changed.  Adapt or die.
---
&gt; The problem here is that the enemy doesn't live by the same rules that we have to, as players. They don't adhere to damage cap, they have DD on battleships that do 800k damage a pop, and you can't track them coming in.
---
CCP is sending a msg, with this:  Nullsec is no longer "safe".  For anyone.  If you want to say you "own" Nullsec, then be prepared to fight for it.
---
I've been around in EVE... awhile, since before the beginning.... and if you think that the drifters will behave this way past their initial 'Incursion' of throwing their hat into the NullSec ownership ring by ROFLSTOMPING all the NullSec "Sovereigns", well... you're about to learn something.
---
All the salty tears and WTFOMG! reactions from Null leaders is pretty damn amusing, though.  Their reactions when the "Drifter Menace" tapers back down to realistic threat levels will be equally amusing, I bet, as their re-act to their own over-reactions.
---
tl;dr - STFU and enjoy CCP's pagentry.  They clearly have a plan for NullSec, and since the new CSMs haven't all quit in protest, it's probably not a shitty one.
---
Not players.  Characters.  Divide by 5 (IDK what the average is).  A lot of us hardly ever undock though, so divide it by 10 again.  It's about 7 players per system, which is kind-of correct (I would say 10) in terms of what a typical system can support.
---
I cant wait to buy an Astero it looks amazing! But Its 50mil without a fit..
---
Yeah the thing I love about Heron is that it's a solid ship for around 300k. 
---
When I die I always log why I died(what I did wrong)  &amp; dont worry about it because I know I still have enough money to buy another
---
Reproductive purposes
---
Because she sold her ass for a job at CCP
---
My first though scroll to delve. No mention of expecting to be bosoned. 0/10
---
Oof
---
meaningless numbers.. if your Abso is getting shot at, you already lost anyway, 200k EHP or 900k EHP
---
on the flip side, Abso can do 600+DPS... pretty handy in 12 man fleets
---
Pro-tip for anyone that spents money on microtransactions: Write down each transaction you make (supermarket products, entertainment, rent, whatever) and reflect on your poor financial choices at the end of each month. You'll be shocked at how much those  "it's just a few dollarydoos" microtransactions actually cost you.
---
You just lose your ship and any loot you were transporting
---
&gt;people still think this is the issue
---
As someone who managed pos fuck that we dont want them back at all. Only strucutre in eve that showed all settings correct and still shot blues. They had so many issues.
---
Reminds me of the CFC vs N3 days. Null has pretty much always been like this. But I agree that the updates over the past 3 years have exacerbated the issue.
---
I miss your videos they're some of the best
---
... is it wrong that I want this?
---
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed the 2019 guide to roaming hisec.
---
We literally know what it takes to fight them, as I have already laid out. You were arguing that a dozen catalysts will do it and I am saying it will not. Now you have changed to implying I have no idea what to use to fight them.
---
nullsec is dead come to low sec
---
\- T2 salvagers that salvage active ships (been thinking about this for a loooong time)  
---
\- Tractor beams that... actually tract ships from 40km away  
---
\- T3 jump freighters, cause we're really missing nulli/cloaky freighters to make the game more balanced  
---
\- Mining lazers that can do serious damage and have perfect tracking, who needs a kikimora anyway? come and get me you noob ganker, SPOD IS LIFE  
---
\- T2 doomsday, like the doomsday of old, erase anything within 250km range, friends or ennemies. This would have ended x-47 in a couple of minutes instead of a 7h long shitty tidi/laggy/buggy fight.
---
The resources move around, wax and wane.  Imagine what happens on a PI planet.  That's the main conflict driver.  You want them you've got to fight for them.  And if nobody's challenging you, NPCs will.
---
Things I hate: sovereignty - who cares who's name is on the label.  Scrap it.  Ban renting too.  Then there's no reason to earn by proxy, chase the resources like everybody else.  Fixed infrastructure of any kind: stupid idea - player groups should live out of carriers - their "flagship" so to speak.  They can move it around.  It's kind-of like a citadel but you can warp it about, gate it.... whatever...  it's a big risk but sometimes you have to do it.
---
If I were making Eve 2, it would be more like this and less like the kind-of game a boring accountant would play, which is pretty much what it is now.
---
There is a YouTube ad, problem is, you can skip it before anything is actually said.
---
I swapped for a Jackdaw and all was good...
---
Plus @caspae\_Hadano - that wasn't the mission.
---
Adding to Syndicate:
---
If you want to find the definition of (Brain)Overkill go to VeGa pocket. Unless you fly something cheaper than a meta fitted Kestrel the residents, after you killed the always present sleeping Hulk in icebelt, will greet you on the Deadend pocket outlet with a surprise party of a Cyno-HIC but no webs at all. The cyno lit on your arrival will present you with a variety of Capital-Ships, half of them not making the killmail of the cheap T1-BS that they caught.
---
But muh ell pea
---
Only mistake was thinking the other side was safe.  In this situation the correct play was to take the detour.
---
T2 Salvage Drones
---
On proactive defense fleets:  
---
It's correct that it's no longer needed, but mostly because it's no longer effective.  This really ties into your point on nullficiation and gatecamping as well.  
---
With the larger threats coming in via nullified targets, cyno from already seeded alts, or via wormholes, camping a static location becomes less efficient of a defense mechanic then being on standby ready to bridge to whatever gets tackled.    
---
There's no reason to defend the gates when people can easily just go around them.  Even if it might catch a portion of things coming 'behind the walls' so to speak, your fleet being 'proactive' can't be as reactive against interior threats as a fleet waiting to react can be.
---
Yeah he’ll fit them wiry probe scanners
---
As much as I hate to say it, but Big bloc-fights get into the news. 
---
Soooo..., *clenches teeth* CCP should push players further towards big alliances. Then they have to get their shit together with their new cloud tech and bam, another big News story.
---
The problem is not that people don't try out eve. As seen on the invasion tour slides the player retention is abysmal.
---
IMHO this is mainly due to the game being totally different from the expectation you get after seeing the trailers. Especially the older ones. These were all about how you can change the game, can carve a bit of it for yourself, and influence stuff. That's not how the game works, at least not anymore.
---
And your point is? There is still a 30k character alliance sitting in one region
---
Really? I do seem to remember noticing gunning rights in a random neutral hisec citadel, I could steal the ammo, but couldn't unfit any mods.
---
Explorers are easy targets, so fit yourself a cheap ship (for your skills) and don't carry hundreds of millions of isk worth of loot in the ship. You can drop stuff off at any citadel: if you can dock, great, just unload and put into asset safety; if you can't warp to the citadel at zero, right click on the structure, unload, then use asset safety.
---
Avoiding gate camps/bubbles involves strategy and foresight. Know the region and its typical choke points, as most camps use the same gates over and over. Use your map to show where most ships have died recently and consider avoiding. Never warp directly to a gate, instead go to a celestial and dscan. If it's camped, make a perch and the see if you can find a route around. 
---
If you jump into a gate and the other side is bubbled, it's important not to panic. You're cloaked and have thirty seconds. Look for the edge of the bubble and once your cloak is up you re-cloak and burn toward it and start aligning to the nearest celestial.
---
Try to have nanite paste in your hold to repair modules, and a good repairer can save you. ECM drones are also cheap and useful, as is an ECM Burst module.
---
And if a system is too hot/camped for you, and there's no way out, just make a safe spot and log out for awhile. Most campers don't stick around to wait for a single ship unless it's super juicy.
---
Munnin fetishists....
---
Dude you have no idea.
---
I heard you like cynos so lemme cyno even more cycnos to your cyno party dawg
---
Thanks for the info. I def need to look into bookmarking for savespots
---
Man you need a hug.
---
Might be a 1B astra but they dropped it in *our* backyard, uninvited and without the appropriate permit!
---
Will anyone please think of the Children?????
---
if you want to get rid of afk ratting - get rid of the mechanics that make it possible instead of rebalancing 1 ship which won't change a single thing about afk ratting other than which ship is ship du jour.
---
Get your ass around Eugidi, fight will be provided.
---
I think what you're describing is not this game my guy
---

&gt; The part that strikes me the most about these "salt" posts is the existence apparently very large population of players who get off on CCP making other people's lives miserable. Like, people are genuinely happy that CCP added a mechanic that forces people to waste X hours each day citadel gunning for no rewards besides structure maintenance.
---
I mean, there's a reason tales of divine retribution hold their place in folklore and religion since like forever. The very idea or even promise of some unstoppable force delivering vengeance upon those more powerful than you that wronged you, disagreed with you or offended you in some way is enough for some people to get off on that. Nothing matters as long as you can at least imagine this someone feeling as helpless and frustrated as you did.
---
CCP supposedly intervening to poke those big bad blobs is probably closest we have to this idea as far as EvE goes. That, or literal lightning suddenly striking Mittani personally or something, I'm pretty sure some people caress these sort of thoughts.
---
If there was only a way to swap OP with comment...
---
Get one star next to your name
---
Tested this... a corp can declare support to another any time or as often as they like. What is odd is that the alliance or current chosen executor doesn't get any notifications of this and the choice seems to always remain secret. This seems like an easy and powerful way to secretly ruin an alliance.
---
Have a MWD and a cloak. When you jump through start moving in a direction away from the gate and hit your MWD then cloak. Once you cloak has activated change direction, 90 deg off course works best. Unless there is a large camp with lots of frigates they probably wont catch you.
---
You're not wrong.
---
Im not using a cargo scanner bcs I think Ill just get too picky with the cans. But It would def save a bit of time.
---
Will def read about cloaking when I get home.
---
And yeah im still without a corp. Dont know if I should wait a bit until what I actually want to do in the game..
---
Welllllll people are marginally less likely to run away if they see core probes on dscan.
---
It’ll take you about the same amount of time to train early skills normally as it would for you to get a good handle on the mechanics of the game itself.
---
Using the free skill points you would get right away is like starting a race with an explosive sprint, without making sure that you’re running in direction that you want to go.
---
&gt; If they are wanting to see a "dynamicness" to Sov, yet they aren't seeing it happen via PvP, is it crazy to think they'd consider using PvE mechanisms to force a change?
---
I mean, that's a way to sidestep a problem, but that is just that, sidestepping it.
---
Besides, I doubt drifters will do something meaningful as far as what kind of change people seem to want.
---
Solo BS isn't too bad.  Nightmare is fairly ok with little or no support and vargur is also super hard to catch if you know what you are doing.  The fact that shiny BS kms invite capitals or a blob are not necessarily a bad thing.  I'm happy to roam in kitey BS with just a few other people, but now I just let the rest of my alliance know that I will probably be pinging for Dreks and Guards in about 30-45 minutes :)
---
gwl is mostly dead except lsh remnants for some reason still live there. there aren't people in space to fight, but if you try to move a super here, you can expect it to die unceremoniously to the 5 people who are still active in lsh
---
99% of people will run once they see any probes, i would rather use combats to find them and get on top of them asap then cores for the slight chance they might not run
---
Capitals are in a good place right now. 
---
They need to have support with them.
---
Why are anticapital subcapitals a bad idea again?
---
Also, t2 Rorquals
---
All of those choices are perfectly fine, but remember that you consent to PvP when you undock from a station. There are no dedicated PvP zones, and you can be attacked at any time in space (with what level of space you’re in determining the response from NPC police.)
---
What fucking idiot drops 15 dreads on 50 titans - no wonder you can’t accomplish anything
---
I wish this was a meme and not real life. Roaming is just feast or famine. 
---
P.S. when you do 40 jumps looking for anything and end up taking a fight you know you will lose... Only to get that sweet sweet embrace of death... To a roaming WH gang that is looking for the same thing...
---
I bet there's bunch of people who would gladly fund a can of napalm and a time fuse...
---
I mean, fair, but as a rule of thumb of you're scanning a person down you never drop probes until you have their exact distance and dscan within 5 degrees. One pass every time.
---
I mean there are like... a lot of ways that you could offset the two "workarounds" that you posted. You could very easily just make a 1 minute cooldown where you can't use/take a cyno after jump-bridging, and limit cyno mass. Yes you could still burn in multiple cynos to a target but that's inherently a lot harder and would reward better setup.
---
Or you could use the same mass limit and make it so cynos disrupt the surrounding space and stop cynos from opening within 50km of an active cyno. Again you could spread out a grid and bring in multiple groups of however many capitals are allowed by the mass but it would require a lot more planning.
---
Gate camping is dumb as shit, go fight someone that can shoot back
---
&gt;Branch/Tenal: “North China”
---
shitloads of vni bots if you're into that kind of thing. a small enough gang often won't merit a response fleet and you can catch some mouth breathers gating
---
Put a cooldown on using/taking a cyno after you use/take a cyno (say 1 minute), and limit mass that can jump to a cyno. Would inherently limit the number of caps on field unless you gated them which takes much more prep.
---
I’m pretty sure the executor Corp can see who has declared support for whom. Can’t remember if there’s a setting to make it public.
---
Even a DC II might get the gankers hate \*g\*
---
Wow thanks for so much info man will try to do better the next time I undock!
---
I went into GE yesterday and just orbited the fortizar waiting on someone to come say hello, but like 6-7 came out to blap me instead of 1-2 :(
---
Look at it the other way around, getting into a corp helps you to figure out what you want to do. If you relise you don't like what that corp does move on. You now know more about what you like or dont like.
---
Seriously though, it's amazing how many people get baited by a free cyno.
---
I don't think CCP needs more bad ideas - they got those covert \*g\*
---
All of them?
---
Magic 14
---
More of those dumb *fake gamers playing with friends on comms" type ads
---
A big fucking sign that tells everyone their starting faction doesn't matter and they it's only for cosmetic purposes and give everyone access to T1 Frigs and small weapons asap
---
We don't need to "appeal* to psuedo intellectuals, they're the types who will more likely than not come in, expect one thing then pontificate about how eve doesn't cater to them
---
Introduce more pick up and play type shit even though bitter vets will reeeee about it
---
Give starting events new player LP instead of straight up isk or triglav salvage, make it as gross for vets to try and farm as possible while still giving new players a way to upgrade to T1 cruisers ezpz
---
Being back as dailies but only for characters under 30 days old with stacking bonuses every 5 days so they have an incentive to log in each day but requires them to do something "scary" like going out to lowsec to complete
---
I never really know when to stop exploring.. Whem do peoplw usally go back? at 50,100,300mil?
---
Ive been doing about 80-130 before going back but it feels kinda bad if I land in a bubble on a way back.
---
Isnt the cloak timer 60s? I might be wrong
---
+Didnt know that you can logoff in space and dont lose a ship. will need to read about it.
---
It's not sitting in one region really is it.  It's spread out over 3 or 4 regions.   And it's not 30k people.  It's far fewer.  And who cares anyway.  If you spread people out and make umbrellas less powerful, you'll have fewer whales to target, because you know, nobody wants to actually be a target, with no recourse.  
---
People don't get this point, which I think is because they lack an understanding of basic Human psychology.
---
You're more helpful than you realize : )
---
They added fueling rights. didn´t they?
---
&gt; No one is pulling Goonswarm back from the war other than their leadership. That's a choice they are making. Only Goonswarm leadership chose to allow so many citadels to go down in their space. No one, other than Goonswarm leadership is choosing to only allow a few members the ACL rights needed to help defend your space?
---
Let's be honest here, when attacks occurred, noone had slightest idea on what's going on and what kind of response will be required to stop those things that are known to evaporate caps and counter almost anything on demand the moment CCP wants them to.
---
"Home's on fire, everyone come back" seems to be natural reaction I can't blame people for exercising.
---
Yeah. What this guy said plus training. Buy something cheap, get into cheap clone and go scan something, die there few times and read about wormhole mechanics. The learning process can be (and I'd) really fun!
---
Again the "nullblocs the only viable way to play".    Play what?  There is no high-sec? No low-sec?  No PvE?   No exploration - no other viable game style?   
---
This nothing but typical null-bloc mindset - we are Eve, we own Eve, everyone else playing are just meaningless and they don't count  - we are the only ones who pay subs ...
---
Go have another drink from the fountain of your self-importance...
---
No, don't cherry pick the cans. You earn more by taking them all regardless of what's in them. The advice to cherry pick is so bad and tired of seeing it.
---
Did most of the people in GE move out for a war or something? In-between visits a couple of months apart there's been quite a drop in numbers.
---
Ai, someone's salty about ECM griffins? Same people who brought two scorpions full of jammers and put 2 ECM jammers on all their cruise phoons the day before and brought basically only EC-xxx drones (we packed Smartbombs this time around...)
---
&gt; you could still burn in multiple cynos to a target 
---
you can literally just light new cynos on a fax or whatever every time one goes down
---
&gt;make it so cynos disrupt the surrounding space and stop cynos from opening within 50km of an active cyno
---
you mean a 10 minute duration 50km radius cyno inhib? *that* sure won't get exploited
---
Not always the case, if you roll into someone, wich for me personally is how i catch most of the things i catch, time is the most important, and simply dropping combats is always faster
---
LoL
---
Was thinking abou EveUni since I listen to a lot of their classes but I might benefit more(in terms of practical experience) in a normal corp..
---
While I don’t think you’re overall point is wrong, I’m also pretty sure that OP isn’t claiming drifters are solving anything.
---
&lt;3 just 4 u bby
---
"Outer Ring: “Why am I being shot by 3 INIT. Hels in Outer Ring”
---
Accurate
---
&gt; Stop trying to put yoursef into the victim role for once k thx
---
Honestly, I think being the perpetual victim (in their mind) is part of test's identity.
---
I agree with everything you stated here.
---
It's a bucket list item to run the gauntlet through great wildlands in a nyx
---
Also better fitting.
---
Completely wrong. You are asking to be ganked in high sec without a tanked arc with slaves and boosts.
---
BHahahahhaahhahah
---
Hahahhahahahaha
---
Ha haha ha haaahahaha
---
I love how you use the term "out of touch" and then try and say that calling a fleet that is 10% Kikimora a "Kikimora fleet" is semantics.
---
Also spoiler alert on the Rorqual thing, there are a lot of kills with Dreks/Leshak on them but in the last like ~35 losses there are 2 with Kikis on them and they're both in Drek fleets.
---
cool i'll ask the boss if i can go home earlier too
---
&gt;I actively want changes that make my alliance's playstyle harder because it makes the game more interesting.
---
It's kind of a hollow statement when your alliance acts in such a way to make their gameplay style as easy as possible.
---
I think for the next stage of the event, every time a drifter npc is killed, it should split into 2 more, of equal size and power.
---
Instead of reworking npc behavior (make them shoot drones)
---
or just anoms in general (add more frigs that point and web or randomize it so its harder to bot) they are doing the easiest fix ever and screwing up a ship that I felt had its place in pvp. I'm happy we are screwing up bots and forcing them to adapt but I still feel like this fix is lazy.
---
Thank you Sir for supporting newbros!
---
We salute you
---
o7
---
What dumb idea is this lmao. Randomly destroy half a constellation? How do you even come up with this garbage?
---
What's a good frig/destroyer so solo hunt vnis/ishtars?
---
I am not NCPL and I never was. I just see how it looks from an outside point of view. You cant fight modern capitals applying perfectly and supported by 250 man subcap fleets with Ravens. The levels of power are a whole different level. Its of course deserved, Goons have superior organization, but at some point, its time to call the "winners of EVE" and then do something about of, so that the game doesnt die like Serenity did. And Serenity DID DIE, "EVE is dying" is a nice meme, but it can ni fact happen.
---
The fact that people still think this is the result of Drifters is disappointing
---
I should have clarified; In Nullsec - I miss the days of smaller, independent alliances, instead of massive coalitions with Blue for 50 jumps.
---
no comment on moon mining as i got 0 clue.
---
but agreed limit citadels.   a war should focus on you taking their citadels down, and taking those slots for your own.
---
bit like old sov where most number of POS controlled system.
---
and bigger citadels could take up more citadel slots for the constellation
---
What are hidden zenith ships?
---
Next time I get a T1 frig smallgang fleet, we'll make our way there ;)
---
Excuse me sir, this is the BAD idea thread.
---
That's because killboards can tell you a lot about a pilot, just not the numbers in the top right.
---
I do agree with the first part about the need to rework anoms (and PVE combat in general), but to be honest I think they were so focused on screwing afk-ratting that they turned and already strong PVP ship into a probably OP ship.
---
I haven't run numbers on it, but the VNI was already a great PVP ship and all those changes only look like will make it even stronger.
---
Goons just have stable media outlets for everyone to see that those with access to them are visibly displeased. If people had access / were as interested to listen to some *alliance_name's* out-of-fleet comms as they are in firesides, they would probably hear same grumble.
---
Dude...
---
Uh yea, in your first point there is a mass limit. The fleet could get exponentially bigger, the point is not to shit all over people with fleets on standby, but it would cause a fight to escalate as opposed to just having the hammer drop in the first 2 seconds of a cyno.
---
Cyno ship goes on field, lights cyno. 3 capitals come in (they have a 1 minute cooldown on activating cynos of their own), originally cyno is now massed so it can't be jumped to but goes for it's full duration. 1 minute passes, those 3 capitals can now cyno. 3 more capitals jump to each cyno, you now have 9 new capitals with the 1 minute cd, etc...
---
I agree the second example isn't a good idea, my point is that you're being super limited in your thinking if there are 0 ways you can see to rebalance cynos in a way that doesn't make them useless but removes some of the feel bad mechanics they currently have.
---
Drifters
---
You used to be able to tank Concord and also destroy NPC structures years ago, but CCP made Concord deal essentially infinite damage and NPC structures invulnerable because of the problems this caused.
---
If 1000s of players did that, they'd all get concorded ans that's about it.
---
Nope. If you train 2mil sp you can only extract 1 mil sp. To extract next milion you need to train again 2 mil sp.
---
I dont want to necro post but youre totally right with this. There is nothing fun in joining a corp of 100+ people only to find out theres about 6 guys in it running 20 accounts each. I've never ran more than mine, maybe I'm crazy but its just game breaking for an MMO. Literally should be a decision thing, have more than one character sure but to run multiple account is non-sense in a game health perspective.
---
okay bye
---
Providence is special in that the locals are NRDS (not red dont shoot) which means they wont attack you unless you have shot them first. you can check if the pilot sitting on the gate (or in local) is a local or someone likely to shoot you.
---
https://kos.cva-eve.org/
---
if the person you are checking is KOS to CVA they are also more likely to shoot you. Of course if you check yourself on that site and you are also KOS then all bets are off.

They can take their API checks and shove them right up their arse.  Nobody tells me what to do - except my wife, my boss, my kids, my dogs...

Further testing has proved me incorrect. Worst they can do is offline the mods or attack blues. Random people not understanding how pervasive spy culture is can't seem to grasp why stuff if locked down though.
---
Cmon now, are you serious? Of course not every character is sitting in delve holy moly, but an alliance is mainly financed through one region. Yea, goons probably make money somewhere else too but if you turn on your brain you know what I mean.
---
If that is so, why is the player base complaining about content drying up?
---
&gt; Whem do peoplw usally go back? at 50,100,300mil?
---
Depends on their wallet. Someone with a few billion won't miss 300m isk and a cheap ship. Someone with cargo worth more than their wallet ought to be more careful.
---
&gt; Isnt the cloak timer 60s?
---
Yes, it is. My mistake!
---
&gt; I might be wrong +Didnt know that you can logoff in space and dont lose a ship. will need to read about it.
---
You can log off in space so long as you are not cloaked or aggressed. And you will not lose your ship.
---
The thing is, goons thrive on content, even if they lose. Most have had years to build up warchests.
---
Ok that I do understand...  Meanness retracted.

The problem with solo hunting them is that as soon as you jump into a system they warp off, so it’s really really hard to actually connect with them into a fight. Which means your limited to dictor/cepters to warp to the anom super fast. Then you just have to hope you’re faster than the drones
---
That's a legit kill. Even ignoring the difference in ship classes, IP has a fair number of players who are pretty good at small gang pvp. GG.
---
LSH =\= NSH.
---
For minors, it's actually somewhat viable. Even with nerfed drones, the Rattlesnake has so much DPS at any range and sufficient tracking to chew up Damavik/Kikimora swarms that it's a little faster than marauders or a Vindicator/Machariel combo.
---
Major fleets usually have enough webs that the frigate-tracking issue goes away.
---
lmao a salty retarded goon!
---
Presumably you play eve at some point, so of sleeping conflicts with work, when do you even?
---
Pockets would be prime space, only capitals can come in so super safe and not really issues with logistics
---
But do not come in a kite fit as this is cowardly and unsporsmanlike ....
---
BTW it's easier to farm Barghest BPCs hunting mordus rats in lowsec than missioning. Either/or tho.
---
This is more or less correct with a few caveats.
---
* Immensea is TEST frontline staging, ie where all our pvp-inclined people are. I don't even go to fuckin Esoteria unless I'm bored out of my skull and feel like baiting gankers.
---
* Eso tells you to go to GE- cos that's where Brave lives and where their pvp nerds are. Yeah you'll probably only find 8 test guys there lol, we live two regions away.
---
* There are approximately 40 guys who pvp in TEST.
---
* You can definitely get fights in Detorid. There are groups there and in Scalding Pass that will form small gangs to kick other gangs out of their space. This can lead to great like 5-10 vs 5-10 cruisers down fights. Expect about a 1 in 4 chance this will happen on a given roam? They might bring a fuckton of Drekavacs with no idea how to use them. Also you could just fight one of the 123890483120 test gangs that are always roaming their space in cruisers down. Sizes range from like 50 fuckin Nospreys to 5 guys in frigs, just don't fight shit you can't fight.
---
* Some of the Scalding Pass nerds aren't blue to Frat anymore. Frat just can't deal with the peasant rebellion because they're too busy getting hit by us in every fuckin TZ and having 5 test gangs in their space at any given time.
---
* Pure Blind and Venal had guys to fight like a month ago, wtf happened?
---
* Omist both is and isn't full of bots depending who you ask. When I scrape zkill for likely bot kills there's a lot less than most other regions, with a fairly decent number of ratter kills/hr. Either the guys that hunt bots in Omist REALLY suck at killing bots, or there's less bots. You pick, and if you're finding bots go screech at our fuckin diplos, they don't have enough space work to do.
---
TLDR: Seriously just come roam detorid. You're more likely to run into a small/medium gang from Test than from Frat, but why do you care unless you're blue to Test?
---

Feelsbadman.jpg
---
Deklein - dead&amp;co. usually drop a 50+ retri fleet on any passing solo or small gang roamers.
---
Yeah BS aren't fun to solo in. Detorid seems to be good roaming space for anyone because I'm always out there with a small gang or solo myself, and I always see other blue gangs (and I do get fights from Frat as well). So you go out there and you either fight frat or you fight test.
---
Thanks, Rump.
---
Sig tanking and speed tanking wife aggro are essential skills I learned while playing EVE.
---
Byf coverage would be AMAZING.
---
Brave undocking or even doing things in standing fleet seems to be a rare thing these days. :(
---
Can I just be in the background somewhere licking an Ice Cream cone?
---
you cannot expect a playerbase to artificially handicap themselves.  I think [this article](https://www.designer-notes.com/?p=369) explores the phenomena well.
---
This post is soo good. The most fun eve-related content right now,- posts like that on r/eve. Eve itself is worthless
---
Eh, that's normal. You go into somebody's staging and you really can't expect them to limit how many uncoordinated derps undock in standing fleet / "solo" to try to kill you. They may not be on comms with each other or in the same fleet lol. These kind of fights are guaranteed clown fiestas.
---
AFAIK the entire game has had "quite a drop in numbers." Except for Chinese bots.  Those seem to be proliferating in the wastelands of nullsec just fine.
---
Seems right lol, set the stage for a fight then bring a fleet to the party.
---
OP: Pretend Great Wildlands doesn't exist

---
&gt; Basically has the pointless seal clubbing actually been addressed or is that still part of the welcome to EVE experience?
---
Nice turn of phrase.
---
Not thoroughly enough to put a complete stop to it, but as long as your corp doesn't insist on owning a structure you're now immune.
---
The best advice has always been "don't be where there are gankers." This is really quite easy to accomplish (I spent years in E-Uni, which is basically permanently wardecc'd, and never encountered a wartarget I wasn't looking for after about the first week). Just keep to the 99.9% of the map where these lowlifes never go.
---
Depending on the time of day you can get great fights in Curse or nothing. Go to the mission pocket in late USTZ, go to the hisec side in EUTZ/very early USTZ. Wraithguard and Winged Hussars are not in fact dead alliances, but their USTZ goes to bed at 7pm. :)
---
Yup, Daddy is home, was about time. Some QFC Alliances were on the verge of internal collapse due to being trolled by xtrasquishylol and his maybe 5 guys in Parasitic Legion and NSH being able to take space without big resistance.
---
That’s absolutely true and that’s certainly a discussion to have, but I don’t think advertising for the game is a waste of time at this point.
---
Good list, although i must say Omist is not nearly as bottey as the rest of China space. Most of the Mangos are either too low SP or actually listen to their leadership when they said no botting. 
---
They are all forced to train minmatar for thier doctrine ships, so expect lots of Munnins for any defence fleets they bring.
---
... I hate that it makes sense, but I don’t think that’s good for the game long-term.
---
In provi ur new. Ur probly true neut. Which means they wont shoot u. Trust me as someone who lives under NRDS...paying that fine is no fun.
---
Sorry I meant something alpha clones can fly
---
You have failed to provide even a scintilla of evidence to prove me wrong.
---
If Player A and Player B are fleeted up, and Player A launches drones, assigns them to B, and cloaks up, do the drones stay assigned? If so, can B use them?
---
'Finally, enemy fleet eliminated, time for a bathr...' *ping* *ping* *ping*
---
Incredible. and a couple of others are in Scalding Pass taking Sov from Frat.  Quite a few others moved operations down to Impass to build supers.
---
I’m more talking about sponsored content.
---
Tldr: go-to Geminate
---
The statement was to point out how off base you were in your statement. Rarely do you see a single Titan that you can drop anymore. Sure, you may catch a stray Titan here or there from some outlying player that happened to be able to skill in to and buy their first one, but that's not exactly what's being addressed in this thread. 
---
Citadels made it so groups can consolidate where Titans are being stored, which makes them more easily defensible. It also means you hardly see them move solo anymore. 
---
Players like you keep playing the game that was rather than the game that is. Your tactics and how you see the battlefield are old and outdated.
---
The player base is confused.  The "Goon problem" is more about the sheer size of the group and the force it can bring to grid for any escalation.  It's currently unassailable in that regard.
---
When it comes to "content" (ganking Rorquals) the equation balances itself.  The less powerful that ability to escalate is (the umbrella), the fewer people you'll find in space flying Rorqs, carriers, supers and so on, in PvE.  The number of viable actual targets will go down, as casuals/people who aren't really paying attention aren't going to be undocking anything shiny.
---
Anyway it's quite simple.   The game needs a radical redesign.  All these "solutions" aren't solutions to anything.  I would start on Eve 2 if I were CCP.  Take the ideas that worked: (the economy) and throw everything else away.
---
PvP flags. Players can only engage in PvP if they're explicitly PvP flagged.
---
Ok how bout I modify it to be a ship mod that lets you jump to any gate within 5ly range.  That would be horrible!
---
How so? You proved that you cannot read, so I called you out on it. Your responses only serve to further prove it as you can't seem to understand what it is you explicitly stated that I called you out on.
---
fair
---
i never really solidly grasped the difference, and i also never really cared that much - similar groups, different sides of eve
---
kinda like hydra reloaded and vydra reloaded. doesn't really matter which one is which, they're basically the same group anyway
---
With every post you reinforce how lame you are.
---
The T2 version of the heron is cheaper than the astero. Less bonus but can also fit a covops cloaking device. Of course, unlike the stero, you need the caldari frigate 5 to sit in one. But it is only a week if I remember, and if you are short on isk it does the job
---
Of course, what is nice with the astero is that it has teeth, and you have the possibility to hunt yourself the competition
---
Ok so your playing "change the subject" game to appear that you not wrong. Fine, your correct in whatever the hell your talking about. You win! I hope you feel better
---
Guess we would use them to inject more incursions in our systems in delve
---
Hit your cloak, then your mwd and crash the gate. Don’t try and juke your way to freedom. They will decloak you if they’re not complete trash.
---
When the jump through with you just repeat until you can get out
---
Kind of true, there are a lot of bad ideas that are popular on reddit. However, citadels came out and I don't remember a single person that thought they were even close to healthy state. One could say CCP has a tendency of ignoring stuff for years and then massively overshooting what players asked for.
---
I don't run explo with people in system. Even if I fly covops astero.

I don't feel like testing my luck.

Surprisingly, the only thing common between LSH and NSH is the name and I guess the gameplay style a few years back. LSH are the lowsec super hunting Russians, and NSH role play as Russians (95% American), and were known for super hunting in GW.
---
Current NSH, except for a few OG members don’t do much hunting anymore, as i would assume it isn’t the same anymore, with super proliferation and farms to fields gameplay.
---
:shrug:
---
Wallymarts is running NSH now if that gives you any indication how much they have changed.
---
Red/XIX have no fucking clue how to tackle anything.
---
Cap Boosters removed from the game. Capacitor regen removed from the game. Capacitor now refuels from the cargo via PLEX.
---
Capsuleers in pods can be targetted with a Nosferatu type module that syphons skill points.
---
You can show info on a biomass to see what implants it had in at the time of creation. 1% chance to unplug and recover an implant. 
---
Large Skill Injectors have no fall off. %chance to fail on injection equal to 10% per month old the pilot is. Failed injection consumes injector with no skill points added.
---
Jump fatigue removed from game. Jump drive now takes 1 plex per light year of jump fueled from cargo.
---
Any and all modules that used to use Nanite Paste now use Plex instead. (Please overheat your trig weapons)
---
Asteroids can now be destroyed with damage. Damaged asteroids provide no ore. Mercoxit AOEs on despawn.

If you see this region in the top left of your screen, x your client and go to bed. Trust me, sleeping in your desk chair is horrible for your back.
---
Also - if you want to fight Test nerds don't bother going to Esoteria. That's just krab/pseudorenter/pingwarrior space. Bot aspirants and nothing else. Go to Immensea or better yet go to Detorid and fight the gangs we're already out with to fight Frat. We don't care that you're not Frat, just have some kind of plan for when Frat third parties our fight.
---
Then it is poorly conceived and/or written. Either way it's a fail.
---
travelled through Dek recently with a gang of about 4 dudes and a couple of tackle alts. Shit you not dorkness undocked 20 muninns, complete with 5 logi and FC monitor to 'pvp' us. Fuck GOTG.
---
I had a rorqual once. It died. Rest in Plagioclase
---
yes come to detroit its a lot of fun
---
This, but they never read "how not to get smartbombed 101", fyi.
---
That's a pretty fair assessment yeah. If you had aspirations to be a larger part of the whole, those opportunities are there, but for the most part, yeah. As for learning, the opportunities are there, as well as the people to assist you. There's just less pressure on you to learn them because you can get by just fine without them most of the time, whereas in something like a small WH corp or a small FW corp in lowsec, you have to learn to pilot like a boss or you'll be turning over ships constantly.
---
NSH is Russian speaking and LSH is much more Russian speaking.
---
Thats sort of the point of the nullsec rage it's a buggy poor written pile of shit
---
Yes, he has tightened it up a bit after editing.
---
EU is the high population time zone, as in all games. 19:00-20:00 is peak server population (EU evenings) so your best bet is probably around then.
---
It's a numbers game. Bring more in bigger ships. It won't take long until attackers realize they need to bring more in bigger ships, then defenders bring more in bigger ships. Then we're back where we started. The only solution is to separate the tasks of caps and sub-caps completely. Caps should be a vs other caps and structures option only. There's a place for cap warfare, and it's not hotdropping on small destroyer fleets.
---
We need small, medium, and large objectives for sub caps to perform in null space. Similar to faction warfare. I would even implement objectives in separate areas of space that need to be achieved simultaneously in order to limit extremely large engagements. Sort ofioe Star Wars when one group takes down the shield generator and the other group gets a limited window to attack. 
---
The options are endless, but we need to make the task of taking over space equally as difficult to hold the space. Holding more space should increase your difficulty to defend it while making it easier for enemies to take it. This would eventually lead to a balance. As for how to implement all this. That's CCPs problem.
---
most people roaming aren't looking to engage 180 dudes in a comp with logi which are pretty much all you bring to frat space
---
Barges and exhumers are in a good place with max boosts. I don't think we need more ore entering the game by increasing their intake. I also don't know how we can fiddle with rorquals much more with the dynamic of 5 minute siege time/tank/cost/amount mined being the movable metrics. I have rorquals. Lots of them. I currently use exhumers with 1 booster rorqual though, it's easy off grid. So the changes to rorquals would need to be something that keeps people using them.  
---
The changes I would make to a rorqual:  
---
* Reduce max mining amount to 1.5x a max boosted hulk from 2x.  
---
* Remove excavators (change them into t3 salvager drones!)  
---
* Add mining lasers  
---
* Same tank as current  
---
* Same siege cycle as current  
---
* Boosts affect mining lasers  
---
You still get sieged targets that are worth 2-3b. People would be more likely to put them out in space and get caught and killed if it's not a 9b loss locked in place.
---
This would only serve to treat a symptom... poorly.  Try curing the disease.
---
Before Lifeblood forced our small group to consolidate into a bigger Lowsec-group, we did non-planned roams nearly every day. Living in a LS-constellation being completely 0.1 we had a large variety of Wormholes everyday. Sometimes we jumped one NS-WH and took 30-40 jumps to the next WH leading back to our pocket. Or we just poked through the surrounding systems trying to escalate something. Today all you find is Subcaps that are magically warping out as soon as you enter local chat or stuff you need 50 people for. Also citadels negated one of the biggest possibilities to get a fight, bubble their station undock. Now we are pingwarriors too in our alliance, as our old corp level roaming FCs have burnt out and see no point in this anymore.
---
Nah, I've done and watched a lot of abyssal PvP and he's right. It's literally a chance based encounter most of the time. You're either in the counter to what they have, or you're not. There's like 5 ships that are commonly used, all of them counter each other except for the Triglavian HAC which just auto-wins all matchups unless the pilot is trash.
---
Yeah, I'm not feeding you a breadcrumb trail of clues to find my identity in game, which is probably what you're going for. I've said enough.
---
Just join and move on soonish. Not joining any corp doesn't benefit you at all. Not really sure what a normal corp is ;P
---
I was fully afk. I have another afk domi loss somewhere that I soloed a confessor in the gang lol.
---
I vote for April fools next year ccp make ships land at exactly 0 on the cyno. Hilarity ensues.
---
Yes you are proving my point, goons are to large, pretty much what I meant in my other comments. The problem is, goons can fit 30k characters in one region under one umbrella, if they need to spread out because there aren't enough resources then those big empires will be weakened, not just goons. So Yea their size appropriate to the space they take up is the problem, as they can farm safely under that umbrella, the thing I said the whole time.
---
The reason, there are mainly rorqs as content generators is that empires can sit safely in their one region and protect everything. Once again, if they have to spread out they become vulnerable. How do you get them to spread out? Right, not by nerfing the rorq, but by nerfing anom spawn rates. The thing I said a few comments ago. Imagine that goons cannot just drop supers on the rorq to safe it, but have to take jump gates with sub caps, booom, fleet pvp, content, easy. And that is possible because rorqs won't get nerfed but the fact that they cannot be safed in an instant. Hypothetically of course, because rorqs got already nerfed and what happened? Small entities cannot use them, because they do not have the infrastructure to defend their rorqs, now only the big blocks can safe their rorqs. Which just proves why the rorq itself wasn't the real problem, Yea sure the triple ancillary shield was broken, but not the concept. 
---
EVE 2 would literally kill the game. So many people would quit, Yea sure a few would stay and start again but I definitely wouldn't, just not worth the effort. And EVE 2 would never be like EVE as it is the missing knowledge that made EVE what it was. Now everything is min/maxed to infinity and would never be the same experience.
---
Uh...no? That is generally a strat fleet attacking an objective. I have never seen a "roaming gang" bigger than about 50, and even that's pretty rare. Usually you get about 5-20 guys, sometimes they have logi. Usually my guys are out in like, 10 T3Ds and shit, or retributions.
---
You have either not roamed deto ever, or you've gone exactly once, run into a stratop fleet, and tried to engage and ate shit.
---
Yay
---
i don't even
---
&gt; IDGAF about alphas. They're not a relevant factor in my gameplay.
---
But they really matter in the grand economical scheme that also affect your gameplay experience. Soapboxed-Alpha-VNI-Farms are a real economical problem, even more so since we have welcomed new "gaming cultures" on TQ.
---
&gt; -Iapetans available to capsuleers.
---
But as structures in deep space (outside of solar systems).
---
You then need to establish a jump bridge network to get to them, effectively turning them into islands on the map.
---
Anticap subcaps are neut tempests iirc.
---
For getting in and out of null without running into bubbles, consider scanning down wormholes instead of using gates.
---
why do you think titans should die every day? They use to never ever die
---
Player vs plagioclase
---
Im proud of geminate
---
Yeah I REALLY fucking hate shitadels and not being able to force a small gang fight on an undock anymore. There is a trick to it though. Just put a bubble in line with their shitadel 499 off the ansiblex. They can't pos gun that as it's out of lock range and it will catch nerds warping to the JB.
---
Who would wear that? Admitting to being a dirty goon pet? 
---
Also who goes out in public and admits to playing eve full stop? 
---
Wait eve players don’t go out in public we can wear eve merchandise in our basements xo
---
&gt; EVE 2 would literally kill the game
---
It would kill Eve 1, yes.  That would be the point.  It may attract a bunch of new players though.  Also I remember when Eve 1 started.  It had about 2.5k players.  Nullsec was *empty*... it was exciting to explore around it.
---
&gt;That cannot be muted
---
sounds like fun in non-umbrella-areas
---
Yeah bot dominixes are going to rat aligned out at all times and you'll have to luck out hard to catch them right at the end of a site while they're aligning / warping to their next site. If you're very familiar with domi ratting you might be able to time a logoffski.
---
In all seriousness that looks pretty cool but I can’t approve of snuff xo
---
I suggested adding capital bombs to bombers that have increased damage and a bigger exp radius so that they were only effective against capitals. That way when you have a huge deathball of Titans trying to DD and lance everything in sight you can do a couple of waves of bombers and apply a not insignificant amount of damage to the whole group. Combined with whatever DPS you're already applying, it could turn the tide and allow you to start taking them off the field. 
---
The Reeeeee that was expressed about this idea was significant. Apparently everybody agrees that super capital proliferation is a huge problem, but nobody wants to do anything that could risk theirs being destroyed. It's a common theme in Eve. "Nerf shit to balance the game as long as it's not my shit"
---
Oh interesting..
---
I need to finish welping my current VNIs so I don't have to refit...
---
yes m8
---
Wow Dave, who would have thought any ship was vulnerable when isolated and completely outnumbered. You're so smart Dave, that's why everyone likes you  /s
---
The bubble that appeared is from the warp disruption probe of an interdictor. They appear fast but aren’t permanent, nor do they drag you in like stationary bubbles.
---
So rude of the slaves, thinking they own space.
---
I can't believe you ate poutine and ding dongs chased by JD and Crown Royal.
---
Brave must be tougher than I thought.   Respect.
---
why should you ever be able to avoid the response fleet? 
---
or is it just the krabs who are supposed to be at risk, never the mighty hunter?
---
every time I hear this mentality of wanting to PVP without accepting risk/loss makes me angry as hell. you should absolutely be able to roam and get kills, and you should also lose your ship as the cost.
---
So you say you could, but that means more risk, so nope.
---
The secret is all of them. Now you know

There never used to be fleets of 1000 Titans either.

Play the game that it is, not the game that it was
---
Excuse me, I was led to believe that all of nullsec is sacred, and the NPCs bashing structures are ruining the game. 
---
I have it on good authority that null blocs are entitled to this space, how else would botters and ratters possibly be able to play this game?
---
Lowsec fights 2019, Wormholer fights 2019

&gt;Citadels - Citadels have 3 timers which means you must plan a week in advance to attack one...
---
&gt;This means that a citadel bash is more likely to lead into a grand strategic level contest...
---
I think this is more important than people give credit for. Every single structure now has the exact same time advantage as the rest. This has caused a massive decrease in the pace of play for the average structure contest. 
---
If you want to look even further, take a look at some major battles and you can see a trend. X47, B-R, Asakai, M-O, UALX, and I’m sure many others; all of these major battles peaked over a relatively short period of time. X47 and B-R are great examples. Both gave very short prep times to one or both sides and the rush to rally caused the escalation that cumulated in those battles. 
---
But besides that, the 3 timers over a week was a massive kick in the nuts to lower-scale and faster paced warfare. Every timer now grants the maximum amount of time to rally forces and mobilize, and creates a pretty decent time-sink for attackers and defenders. And I won’t even get into offline structures for that matter.
---
Ewar blob? Lol
---
Ah yes I got the name wrong!

Leshaks are better and less skill intensive than rattles and nestors.

 "Fuck the British"

Imagine a place, named J space...not only are there high end corps, but low end ones too!
---
Command Battleships, but with a reverse MJD. Everything within a 6-12km bubble out at 100km from the ship is MJD'd onto the command battleship. (extra points if crew shouts "Get over here" when it fires).
---
:heart:
---
Don't join wingspan. They aren't even a WH corp.
---
I'd like to add that the small gang people who adapted "properly" to this new meta mostly went to Skill Urself, where they also started to roam about in supercaps and eventually took sov. As we all know Skill U is now gone, with a big chunk of their playerbase quitting the game. Not because they couldn't adapt, but because the gameplay they were forced to adapt to is objectively bad. *Especially* for people who mainly play for PVP.
---
Even in the umbrella you just warp off, find another ansiblex system, and keep trolling them. If they want to rack up jump aids on their super pilots for shooting t1 bubbles cool great awesome lol. Most of they time they will actually try to do something about your gang.
---
If it looks like a hard cyno it probably is.

Frigate pilot can apply?
---
Never flown anything bigger than a cruiser in 9 years.

Just curious though, you were in Provi.  Do you use the KOS checker and/or are you known in Provi (green), neut or red in Provi?  Provi is NRDS isn't it.
---
They are missing out if they don’t Omega, they game is and was a subscription MMO, alpha is totally like a demo, train slow to 5m SP, and you hit a hard wall.
---
If you want to make omega via isk in game, you have to work for it, Eve is a habit for me, but I like it, if not for Eve, I’d be playing some other tedious game like Factorio.

---
I think that answers your question.  PvE'ers will pay more and support your game more than PvP'ers ever will.  EVE is an aberation as far as MMOs are concerned.  Look outside the bubble and players here will see that.  Most people, if they want combat, will go for shooter games, MOBAs, or Fortnite.  One guy with ten alts does not a vibrant population make.

Well they are on alert already :P gauge the interest and make a proposal and see where it goes from there
---
as someone who's currently training a titan pilot (the old fashioned time based way) I completely agree with this. I don't want to dunk on cruisers and frigates. I want to doomsday bloody carriers with a titan.
---
The boson and HAW guns are the worst modules ever added to EVE online, convince me otherwise.
---
(Titans and dreads should never be able to take out a frigate without support.. the whole concept is just stupid)

it's about assets. abstraction is a useful tool.

Querns said:

&gt;Drifters don't attack Sov tho. They attack **structures**
---
To which I replied:
---
&gt;Don't **structures** aid player alliances in defending Sov? Or am I confused about their in game purpose on a meta level?
---
I quite literally have been talking about structures and their usage in holding Sov since my first reply. I don't really care if you choose to continue to engage or not, but at least present the context of the discussion accurately.

A bit of a noob.
---
How does your comment relate to above comment?
---
They primarily focus on operations in wormhole space.
---
This does kind of point out the problem with Null though. Most of Null is dead and unused but some of that unused space is guarded so heavily for some reason that the high sec population is scared to go anywhere near the unguarded space. I take wormholes into null to rat and explore and honestly the place is usually dead as Everquest 2.

It cant be; ccp makes money on injector for these ships.
---
While you still have a t1 cloak, if you’re stuck in s bubble, what you want to do is burn perpendicular to the direction the enemy ships are approaching you from. Bind cloak and mwd to f1 and f2, and as soon as you decloak press both of them at the same time. 
---
You can’t dodge everything this way, like you could if you were flying a covops ship. But if you are lucky they’ll miss the decloak and you can just wait until the bubble despawns and drop cloak to warp off. If you do get decloaked burn for the gate with mwd heated and if you can jump, try again on the other side. 
---
I recommend trying a few gatecamps in a t1 ship, because if you can get past a gatecamp in a t1 cloaked heron then when you upgrade to a covert ops ship you’ll be able to run pretty much any gatecamp using the same tactics.
---
Do "spaceships" allow you to hold/defend space (or at least act as an obstacle to taking that space) when they aren't logged in?
---
Because structure ownership greatly aids in defending Sov, especially so when you don't have the manpower to cover/defend the whole area (timezone tanking for example).
---
If structures aren't any more useful for holding/defending Sov than spaceships, why is there so much citadel spam in NS blocs then? Atleast try not to be disengenous with your replies and argue/discuss with actual logic, yeah?
---
I dont use KOS. I dont really even know what it is exactly.. 
---
I dont know how to check my standing but I never killed or shot anyone.
---
But I really want to learn how to pvp
---
I’m busy driving, but I’m about as good at posting as I am at the game,  needless to say the bars not set very high
---
And any new skills that would be needed would be trained/injected
---
Spaceships only aid you in holding Sov when you are logged in. Structures allow you to hold Sov in an area simply by setting a timer to a specific point in the day....
---
Totally not a disengenous comparison on his part, right? I mean surely if spaceships were as useful as Citadels, we wouldn't have all this structure sprawl/spam, correct?
---
It's not a coin, it's a cone
---
It’s not the concept, it’s fact, that CCP wants or expects people to Omega, Alpha came later, as a extended demo, and to pad the universe with extra bodies.

All alpha skills should be excluded from the 5 mil minimum needed to extract. Then CCP could grant new players some of the Magic 14 skills as mission rewards in the NPE/career agents. Like "complete this mission and receive Power Systems Operation level 4". 
---
Back when I learned all that stuff the skill tree was like 1/10th the size it is now. It makes no sense to force new players to train all that shit before they can get into training new ships/weapons/industry stuff, which is actual content.
---
FW depends on system, TZ, local boredom, phase of the moon, etc. You can get lots of frig 1v1s, you can get damaviks and worms in every plex, you can get nobody undocking for 5 retris, or supers dropped on your solo battlecruiser.

It depends on which sites you are trying to run.  C5 sites, for example,  can be run with a pair of 4/4 leshaks.

In reference to what ships you should train for pvp, it depends on the Corp.  We rarely fly t3cs at all,  whereas some lower class wh groups fly them frequently.

Have you taken a look at PHP at all, in the past say....3 years, out of curiosity? It's gotten a bad wrap in the past, but it's come a lonnnnggg way in the last few versions as well as with changes/additions to frameworks like Symphony and Laravel. It's also still the most popular server side programming language, and used quite heavily by the industry.

Looks good, would buy a flag

did it look like a Fedo Roadkill ?

&gt; The rest of us who are NOT retards know that devs cannot participate in any major player group PRECISELY because of T20.

And the rest of us, ACTUAL "not retards", knows that humans are humans, and will do shit regardless of the "rules".
---
Pretty sure there were "rules" in place to prevent the T2 BPO lottery from being jacked the way it was too, but those were ignored.
---
Keep saying 'they can't join groups, there are rules they have to abide!' like it's some magic defense.  It's funny.

Oracle and Microsoft want to know your location.

Ah, that's a smart tactic! I'll surely try it out once I'm deeper into the game.

Your right. This is why I don't care about folks who say Templar One was "fanfic". It has the potential to engage a wider audience, beyond players, former players and the few hundred folks who just like the lore and watch the happenings from a distance. 
---
It has the potential to capture the attention of the general scifi loving public.
---
You can use a cargo scanner to find the bad cans, activate your scanner and then close the hacking window immediately. Do this twice and the can will blow up. If you blow up all the bad cans there will be no evidence you were there and you don't have to be stuck in the site wasting time hacking worthless cans.
---
&gt; they give you a "you must login everyday" requirement to protect your citadels. 
---
Says the solo, small-group player.
---
Oh, way.... you're in an alliance with thousands of people.  Fuck off with your bullshit.
---
Delegate, dumbass.
---
CST is my time zone as well. I normally get home around 6-7-8ish. I’ll add you when I’m off work tonight
---
Any ship can fit a probe launcher. Only ships like the heron, buzzard, and tengu with a certain subsystem fitted are bonused to the scan strength.
---

---
Lord no, it would not be. Honestly get someone to team up with the guy doing histories of EVE and do a youtube miniseries or something. Plaster that everywhere for advertising.
---
1. You’re talking about safety of ships based on ship mechanics. The PANIC module, which is the reason rorqs can survive long enough for the standing fleet to get organised and cyno in, isn’t directly tied to nullsec.
---
2. Even if it were, you’re still comparing apples to oranges. Comparing rorquals to orcas is a massive stretch at best, considering the overall cost difference, as well as the SP difference to not only fly them, but to fly them effectively.
---
I wanna see Zorya Triglav and Strategos coming t each other in local
---
If they're not AFK, there's really no reason an AF threatens them, yeah.
---
I'll have to look some more. I didn't see any options to make my choice public, but even then unless you're always looking at these options you'll never know.
---
Allow Jump Drives that don't require a cyno to jump to.
---
And sarcastically nowadays you will find more action in delve than anywhere else
---
Guess Goonies have to play the "bad guy" role grrrrrr
---
Fleet ops from Immensea and save ops in Impass, not sure what purpose GE- has except making sure Simple Farmers don't suddenly own Catch.
---
Non-FW lowsecers' cash flow
---
I kind of feel the same way about how large alliances have turned PvP into nothing but bullshit Cap fights, and are their members are generally gutless fucking cowards when it comes to risking ISK in space.  
---
Carebears with guns.
---
They also use the fleet buffer pulse retris in solo PVP. They're, um, not great for that, which provides good fun when they trickle in instead of arrive en masse.
---
*faps in minmatar
---
There's no reason to fight over the new moon citadels, they can just anchor more.
---
No matter what you guys do or don’t do there will always be REEEing
---
I'm ratting under my sweet umbrella, what are you talking about? :D
---
Honest question. What?
---
Bob will visit. Soon....
---
Roamers, small gangs and wormholers come to TEST space all the time and get fights, usually in well-known choke-point systems and usually handled quietly by whichever corp is resident in those rather than becoming an alliance matter. But if you light a cyno or drop an inhib, it’s game on, and you really shouldn’t be surprised if the hammer drops.
---
Gudfights are definitely to be had in Provi, I know from having rolled there a few times with Spectre Fleet and getting designated KOS for having flown a hunting Sabre. I can’t speak to what’s happening in Pure Blind these days but even Horde only held half that region. The gatecamps on the pipe in from Torinos were handled by other groups. Horde rarely engaged until hostiles got to KLY.
---
Like I said, if you want to set up a thunderdome, you really need to be on the edge of hisec. If you wanna roll to TEST space from Devoid, for example, you’re passing through Provibloc and Brave before you ever get to us dinos. Or you set up shop in a place like Stain, accepting the logistical difficulties involved. Back in the day, I’d say the bulk of Horde’s fights were against neighbors GOTG, followed distantly in some order by visitors like Bjorn, INIT booshers and blopsers,, Goon newbie fleets and solo roamers.
---
Part of it also is fleet comps and target choices. A 100-man bomber fleet can murderize a carrier before any response arrives, no matter if the carrier lights a cyno. But that same fleet isn’t going to do squat to a Rorq assuming the Rorq pilot isn’t AFK and has both a pulse and functioning brain stem. Yet Bombers Bar keeps going after Rorqs because certain FCs are being paid to.
---
Buffing rorquals.
---
&gt; (make them shoot drones)
---
This would just make drones completly unviable for nullsec ratting. Drones are not consumables like ammo. Not a nerf as much as complete removal of them essentially.
---
That Drifter seems pleased with your offerings.
---
A few days late for the party, but sure, praise Bob and it's drifter sons!
---
yup
---
I do not believe you are not Fabio.
---
Praise Bob. May his sons multiply until they blot out the stars!
---
Proposing to send a Napalm bomb to people is NOT ok.
---
Hulks are better than rorqs now. Im seeing a lot more of them, and ive been running a squad for mining myself for a while now.
---
Ah, gotcha. I guess it can't hurt to both train the alt while saving up, and once i reach the point where i can purchase, make the call to inject or buy. Thanks man
---
This amused me a lot more than I thought it would.
---
Bravo.
---
Another isk faucet (though indirectly through an NPC) is exactly what the game needs. Oh wait, it’s not.
---
Not sure anything is happening in Omist. There used to be "renters" that paid anyone that would take isk to leave them alone and now it is inhabited by the new Chinese wave from Serenity. 
---
Don't know if they pay anyone, but Legacy is blue to them afaik. Meanwhile Winter Coalition got some other deal to leave them alone. I think they used to show up to timers vs Frat but that stopped, so maybe that is the deal?
---
So really, has anything changed? Debatable
---
Are drones all that much of a concern to a fast frig/dessy vs heavy drones?
---
what the fuck are you blithering about?
---
Imagine having to produce the jumprange data for all WH systems. Sounds like a wet dream for anyone wishing to weaponise the autism.
---
You can use a citidel to cargo deposit your stuff to get it back to hs safe.
---
Someone is proposing to do it?! Wow!
---
&gt; Do "spaceships" allow you to hold/defend space (or at least act as an obstacle to taking that space) when they aren't logged in?
---
Yes, they do, actually. Look up a concept called "fleet in being."
---
([:O](https://youtu.be/CvBfHwUxHIk?t=73))
---
ever heard of drones :P
---
Nice.
---
Tbf, I like the hg snake pod suitonia flying a retribution through my space more.
---
Ass-blaster notsure
---
Put on a wizard hat.
---
I don't get it....
---
When people say BoB are they referring to the old alliance?
---
I think they are refering to the Defunct "Band of Brothers" alliance that ruled over early nullsec. Only issue with all these comeback attempts, SIR MOLLE AND EVOLUTION ARE IN NC.
---
&gt;	It's always a butt puckering maneuver though
---
Especially if the defenders are flying Hecates. Those will run you down and decloak you right quick. Given that this happened in Provi I’m willing to get two Hecates and a Sabre were involved.
---
 [https://imperium.news/bob-god-wormholes/](https://imperium.news/bob-god-wormholes/)
---
&gt; bit like old sov where most number of POS controlled system.
---
Negative, nope, fuck no. Never again.
---
Citadels need to be moved to 48 hr timers and 1 timer unless it's a keepstar at which point it should be 2. Limited to 10 meds 3 large 1 xl per constellation. 
---
Moon mining needs to be both passive and active. Sov mechanics are aids and need to die
---
Which is exactly why they don't do any damage to frigates
---
TIL goons don’t understand markets, supply, or demand.
---
Oh there he is, I thought you died or something.
---
Amen to this part of the thread.  
---
If you enjoy proper, dynamic, open-world PVP, this game is completely fucking barren.  FW is a poor alternative and big fleet Ops combat is dull as dishwater.
---
Lmao
---
We need to make them harder to fit and cycle to spool up. Meaning you cant just fit a frig with it to call your fleet in. Youd actually have to get a tanked cyno ship in there to cyno. Just a min or 30s something tho something thats not instant.
---
The mass change is usless I would prefer to see higher distance after the jump than just light more cynos. A titan takes a cyno he shouldnt lad at 0 on that cyno. Larger ships land farther from the cyno.
---
Beyond this im honestly not sure how else we could change this other tham making spefic ships cynoable. Or able to light one. And thats a bit much.
---
Thank god, then this means that I am still and elite PvPer
---
That's why its always a good decision to quickly change direction right after you cloak to through them off your trail.
---
I've been running small gang out of Dreddit and getting decent fights about 1/4 the times I go out. Shitadel update did a lot of damage to the game and was the final nail in CCP's rep.
---
Hopefully the clown fiesta in Detorid continues, and more corps realize it's a great place to roam to and fight frat, test, or both.
---
I absolutely agree that the anti-kiter meta right now is a bit too far in favour of the tackle, but long webs are the answer. Bring that Huginn or triple web Hyena. Yes people will call you cancer, but fact is, ECM and webs are the only counterplay to assault frig tackle in a kiting gang, and ECM is pretty weak right now. You can say "bring that nosprey or the anti tackle daredevil" but in the real world that doesn't work, it's not 1 jag, it's 3, or 5, or 70, and they have links.
---
I don't bother bringing out nano shit anymore without links and EAFs. At that point it's really a tossup whether something will even fight us, but if you bubblefuck a system or start fucking with an ansi, you can get a response, and if it's in renter space or w/e it probably won't be like 100 fuckin muninns. Maybe.
---
Oh just wait for your markets to be so screwed it costs half of your wormhole loot to run your jump freighter
---
Fuck snuff
---
Sounds like we meed a new player entity to move back to barleguet so people can park squads in tmz/syndicate.
---
ha now thats a meme!!!
---
That's because HS is safe amirite
---
The hunting group I’m thinking of knows that trick and pilots accordingly. They’re really good at their job.
---
&gt;Who says that they get to know in advance what we are flying?
---
It's an arranged wormhole brawl 1j from home it's not super hard to ship in that alt in that alt in painter once they see HACs ongrid if they were actually viable as a counter.
---
Do wormholers even know how to light a cyno? 🤔
---
I killed this autistic screamer the day before and he raged in local hard.  
---
This guy is obviously having some issues IRL :(
---
 That's not it. Non imperiun people don't seem to understand.  The market in 1dq is huge,  I've never seen another alliance even come close. We can operate outside of jita if need be.
---
I would hope so, I mean they've done so much damage to the game, their rep, and their valuation since 2016 that anyone with any business sense would pull the plug sometime around the fozziesov update and reconsider their direction. Retooling Dominion sov and never allowing this "unlimited anchoring of anything anywhere with no ability to force fights on these grids" mechanic would have kept a lot more activity and probably kept the 2014-15 intake momentum going rather than tanking it, and summer 2016 being the worst low point in the game's population history.
---
Glad you enjoy your 3 button anchored ferox fleets bashing undefended astrahus
---
You might have underestimated the glorious power of goon autism.
---
Sure.
---
Then I get to bring in a bomber wing as soon as I realize its a leshak fleet? I mean its not super hard to ship in an alt in bombers is it?
---
these "arguments in a bottle" are hilarious tbh.
---
"when you're under 900 99% abysal webs, and 10 bonus painters from rapiers that we all log in on alts with, you can't beat us!"
---
Weird when I come to test space y'all gatecamp in supers for 3 months and spout in local about how it's your home and whatnot. So basically it just looks like you're clueless.
---
You can accomplish a lot of you get enough rifters together.
---
If it calms you, this year i'm learning Python too!
---
Hopefully a response to this threat would be Angel caps. All hail le krab titan.
---
Right but raising plex prices in one market is a literal motivating factor for people to sell in that market. 
---
So the market will equalize at a higher price everywhere.
---
detorid  unironically is pretty good for roaming/gate camping in EU/UStz, but if you stick around too long sleepy chinese might come blob you :)
---
~~Is that a No Game No Life reference~~
---
So I just loaded a 200 point battery into my new small cap booster, but the “ammo” bar on the fitting screen isn’t completely full? ( And it won’t let me top it off by shoving another one in there.) What’s wrong? What’s the exact number this thing is supposed to hold? 
---
No, I don’t know why this is bothering me. It just is.
---
Sorry jin but stop being deluded, roaming in 2012 was just as cancer as it is now, it just then you had less to deal with blocs being as organised as now. If you think otherwise then please take off the stupid retarded suit and rose tinted specs.
---
Bringing in one alt or getting one dude to reship is much more realistic than forming a 16+ man bomber wing btw
---
No, I want you to provide evidence that the list of things I called you are true as you state. Otherwise you are just a sad person who got their feelings hurt and is now lying to make themselves look better.
---
Been in TEST since the spring and been all over Eso now, haven’t seen a gatecamping super. I have seen people dumb enough to try to engage one without having the mass to make it a fight. Besides, it’s not the super that gets you killed at a gatecamp, it’s the Sabre. Result’s the same if the Sabre’s backup is a few T3Cs or HACs.
---
Vexor Pirate Issue: sansha afterburner bonus with gurista drone bonus.
---
Or just make a new cyno that only works in WH and can drag anyone from a system with a connecting wormhole open. No more math
---
I think you might actually have brain damage.
---
Is that all you have? Your salt over getting called out is hilarious to me.
---
Shield arty is what I meant to say, oh well
---
Lasers are the second least uses weapons in wspace, only blasters are rarer

---
&gt;&gt; "while these people in highsec are jacking themselves off..."
---
&gt; Wat. Seriously, how are highsec players to blame for this. This leap of logic defies reason.
---
Probably because the entire claim you're making; that such a clearly flawed leap of logic is being made at all; is a strawman of what Mittens is saying. I never once understood any of what he said to be blaming highsec for anything.
---
What I understood the sentiment as: is that the highsec players are pointing and laughing at the struggles of nullsec players to counter the drifters, collectively cheering on the drifters to burn down a part of the game that they themselves are too afraid or unskilled to partake in. Meanwhile they live in nearly complete safety, enjoying the exported resources from nullsec, and they don't have to worry about their home being ripped out from under them because their home is owned by invulnerable NPCs. These highsec players are sneering towards the players who went out into the most hostile and challenging parts of the game to call it home, praising when they are forced to play whack-a-mole against NPCs that break the established game mechanics, instead of going out and causing conflict/content against other players.
---
It's less blaming them for anything than it is "talk shit, get hit" kind of situation.
---
"Yeah, point and laugh at nullsec from the safety of your care bear playpen, goodluck with doing any T2 production once we stop exporting raw materials since you can't get any of it yourself without leaving your softly padded nursery."
---
If you don't think Supercapitals are better at killing subcapitals now than they were then, then that's an opinion you can have, but I'd vehemently disagree. Generally, you needed support to bring the big toys, unless you loldropped carriers on people, and even then they only did 2xBS DPS - Which if you weren't PL meant you were at a decent risk of getting dunked on by PL, as that was the time of the infinite cyno chain, although that's something that can fucking stay in 2012.
---
Don't need a JF with highsec connections. What even are DST's?
---
You can take my blaster megathrons when you pry them from my cold dead hands.
---
...what? Wolfpacks can easily take down battleships.
---
He scans from the Ares.  using various help (scan upgrades, "virtue" implants, rigs, sisters scanners and sisters probes) plus high scanning skills you can increase the scan ability of a regular ship.  
---
The 2s align time means he is pretty much uncatchable.  An interceptor is immune to bubbles and a fast align means you warp before they can lock and warp disrupt.
---
The sma farm has been pretty brutal, our tactical mach feed was pretty funny though. We killed a fort the other day without them even putting in the effort to gun it/be in system. It's basically only goons coming down to contest citadel timers for them.
---
its used for brave to feel like they're still relevant
---
Honestly would it really be NSH without some unexplainable turbofeeds
---
Came back from a break to play. Have roamed now for a month and can confirm that this is very accurate. Sad state of affairs for roaming in EVE 2019.
---
This sounds right. The other day I took a ship through most of the south, I didn't see a soul other than some ratters. Eventually I hit Delve, someone tried to drop a carrier on me and I got away. I slipped through a random null sec WH that led to drones. Drones was *empty*. The occasional system with ratters and nothing else. 
---
I eventually caught a VNI and killed it, that was the highlight. No one else formed, no one came, there were no actual humans for the most part in drones or in the south. The game is populated by bots and people waiting to drop capitals on anyone and anything. 
---
Recently I tried to get a fight in a low sec but it was just people baiting gate guns, campers with much larger fleets than me, LP farmers, and the occasional frig-only-PvPers... oh and lots of nothingness.
---
What problem is this a solution to?
---
How you enjoying OTEC 2.0?
---
Scalding pass has the frenchies alliance, come say hello! :p
---
Fuck passive moon mining. That just keeps ISK in the hands of the few.
---
Is it that time of the week for this thread again already.... ?
---
I could swear I JUST read this like 3 or 4 days ago....
---
You heard it here: Dunk prefers the chocolate ding dong.
---
Sure we do.  But they don't show up on the overview for some reason...
---
I don’t like goons as much as the next guy. But I fully support this initiative.
---
Let’s do something interesting in this so/called “sandbox” before CCP finally changes it to theme park MMO.
---
This comment is under-appreciated.
---
Wormholers are very strange people.
---
Small ones can hold 400
---
Not everyone is though and they only have to guess wrong long enough for you to reach the edge of the bubble. Never been caught like this but have had some scarily close calls with ceptors skimming by at like 3k with Lokis or some shit on grid.
---
As long as some players have fun and others come to forums asking for CCP intervention this is not waste of time.
---
If you cloak, you lose control over any drones. They are then lost drones and can be scooped, etc. Given that they are no longer under your control, they are no longer assigned to anyone, so no, they cannot be used by your fleetmate.
---
No you would just have to micro manage them like you're supposed to you lazy fuck
---
Can't you run missions?
---
LMAO one guy in a breacher. GJ. Big man balls on this dude.
---
You technically can. However, a lot of players actually know about that, and since the Mordu’s Legions own very few stations, all of them in nullsec, your ratting ship is going to be ambushed as soon as you undock.
---
Whats wrong with wanting to get some killmails in your titan?
---
The problem is that they feel completely secure dropping titans with impunity under their umbrella. 
---
They have to have something to fear. The only thing a bunch of titans fear is a dreadbomb. 
---
Sooo. Either allow a dreadbomb to come thru the wormhole with you, or we need more NPC null stations to cover null
---
Dreddit
---
Haw dreads are fine. HAW titans with boson are a mistake.
---
Collectible hats.  For ships.
---
&gt; pvp'ers who just want to play against other players
---
In a focused and specific way, you mean.
---
I'm a PvP'er.  Fuck your blobs.
---
Impressive, tbh. I assume y'all are still full of intolerable wingnuts tho?
---
God, I hope it's painful for you to be this stupid. If not, the universe has no balance, because it's sure fucking painful for the rest of us.
---
Apparently the retention is at 4%(?) after 30 days. Its basically join a blob and farm or gtfo. The actual core gameplay is basically fucked. Seems impossible to market it in this state.
---
*checks Delve* 
---
Fair.
---
point to the part on zkill where bob touched the ratters
---
Moving a small gang corp into an alliance that gives multi week blanket orders to stay docked and just run your bots is death? Who knew.
---
At least they're allowing their small gang corps to fight right now.
---
Ohh yeah definitely worth it.
---
When NULL is this broken, yes.
---
No but if they have light drones they very much are
---

Oh the old rorqual ratting on a gate. right
---
Brilliant! That way megacorps can train their alts to fly Rorqs day-1 using their ISK stockpile!
---
gobbins looks like a fucking crybaby in this ping tbh
---
In a T1 scanning frig you've got very little chance of surviving a trip through null without extremely good knowledge of  who's active when and where.  TBH, you're probably better off wormhole diving in that ship. You'll still encounter the occasional bubble on a hole, cloaky anom camper, etc, but overall you're much more likely to make it out with your loot. 
---
For long term exploration you want to look into covops, astero, and for null particularly, ceptors.   
---
Good luck!
---
*yawn*
---
Wake me when Jita, Amarr, Rens, Dodixie and Jek are blockaded. 
---
Otherwise, STFU with your stupid threats, carebear.
---
Does Sid also play EvE?
---
Hmmmmm Cat Ears!!!!!
---
Our current ship of choice in provi right now is the Muninn.
---
There's a ton of depth to it. If there was just a brainless n+1 meta, HK wouldn't have lost while having 27 Leshaks compared to AFK's 20.
---
It's the opposite of a stale meta, considering things are still evolving on a week by week basis, and I can guarantee you every big group has some things up their sleeve they are going to bring/try next time they fight a certain group. The evolution continues.
---
Praise be to Bob!
---
But Bob giveth, and taketh away, don’t assume we will not be tested as well!
---
imagine any citadel large and down (not keepstars) being rf like poses used to be, that would be so dope
---
Not Bob's fault he was in the right place.
---
&gt; So maybe remember your place, when we come for you pubbie?
---
hahahahahaha
---
Dude, you sure have a high opinion of yourself.  
---
Fucking hilarious.
---
Praise Bob and pass the ammunition!
---
Seriously, I do not understand why the Proteus still doesn't have the sub-systems to support being a fully fledged drone boat.
---
Personally I think I would use the report a bot functionality.  If you have pages of logs, so does CCP.
---
With a dozen npc battleships on grid your drones MWDing back to you get blapped instantly.
---
&gt; Nullification and gatecamping 
---
Smartbombing Battleships. Problem solved, next.
---
&gt; Proactive defence is no longer needed from sov holders, and now defence is mostly all reactive.
---
Nope. I've just this week been apart of pipeline camping keeping people from freely moving through our space unmolested and keeping them out of the krabbing pockets. The only -reaction- going on is when a super or rorq gets tackled by a log-in or cloaky camper. Otherwise there's plenty of people going around in small gangs enforcing the borders.
---
&gt; Citadels
---
Yeah, why should we be able to build up the cities, towns, highways, guard posts that comprise the infrastructure of our sovereign territory? Why should we be able to set our vulnerability windows for that infrastructure for time slots that we're able to defend them that don't happen to align favorably with our enemies? I agree, we could make it convenient for our enemies to come and attack our stuff, how thoughtless of us to do otherwise!
---
&gt; It also means it's hard to manipulate the schedule of a specific alliance.
---
So, your argument against "timezone tanking" is that you can't do the opposite to the enemy by choosing to attack them such that a timer would be inconvenient for their timezone? It looks like your problem is with CCPs design decision to allow players to make their vulnerability period to a time in which they are able to play the game. Since people have, you know... lives and real life responsibilities, like a job, family, sleep. You know, that stuff.
---
&gt; Ansiblex gates being in range of a keepstar doomsday
---
How is that any different than jump bridge death-star poses of old?
---
Your entire post is fucking stupid.
---
Gobbins lost whatever was left of his dignity with this post

Which is why I identify with Zorg.

Who the fuck are you again?
---
Fellow bunny pirate, I salute you!
---
&gt;CCP: lets annoy nullsec people  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Nullsec people: let's pass this onto somebody else  
---
&gt;Highsec pubbies: ~~get their shit pushed in, and quit~~  Get annoyed at Nullsec people and side with CCP on their annoying mechanics because instead of trying to get the Highsec people on their side or doing something to actually affect CCP, Nullsec threw feces at the wrong people.  
---
&gt;Nullsec people: &lt;pikachuface.jpg&gt;
---
FTFY
---
Ok, but this change in the mining mechanics made possible for everyone to enjoy not one, but two (mining and industry) whole new ways to play Eve to basically everyone in the game.
---
Someone will argue that even before it was possible to mine with barges and exhumers, the point is that without a rorqual boost and A LOT of accounts mining was useful just to make a bunch of small/medium subcaps, even build a BS was a big project for a single miner.
---
And why invest into an industrial toon if you only can make T1 small/medium stuff? It was a waste of time, better to rat in a VNI and get your dirty money immediately without waste time in BPOs and BPCs, refining, moving stuff all around etc etc...
---
Now all this stuff is open to everyone, even a single guy with only one account can train a rorqual pilot to build amost everything, and thanks to this he will be pushed to invest into an industry alt to refine, maybe a freighter and JF pilot, a second account for another neutral JF pilot and cyno alt... and so on in a positive spiral that was one of the most beautiful aspects of Eve imho...
---
...well before injectors :\
---
One last thing, killing rorquals does not need a huge fleet nor expensive ships.
---
And not all the rorquals are well protected by a capital/super umbrella, if you try to gank in renting areas you'll find a lot of badly fitted rorquals which die quickly and most of the times nobody try to defend them.

Greetings capsuleers!

As we discussed in a presentation at [EVE North](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/442644023?t=03h09m01s) a few weeks back, we’ve been working internally on a very early prototype for a concept we’re currently referring to as “ACL Bookmarks” or “Shareable Bookmarks”. Today we want to start a conversation surrounding the existing bookmark system and how aspects of it are currently used, as well as getting some feedback on some potential use-cases for the new system.
---
First off, lets start with an outline of the new prototype as it stands right now:
---
**Shareable/ACL Bookmarks**
---
This concept would be a replacement/extension of the existing bookmark or saved location system, allowing you to create links to locations in space that can be navigated to (through the right click menu or places tab of the People and Places window). Whereas previously, capsuleers could create bookmarks accessible to either themselves or their corporation, this system is designed to be less restrictive and more flexible. In almost all other ways these new bookmarks would be functionally identical to the existing system (for example, we do not intend to change the rules about what you can point a bookmark at).
---
**Bookmarks are stored in folders, which are accessed through** [**Access Lists**](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/208289645-Access-Lists)**.**
---
* Those folders can be shared with your corp, alliance, coalition, friends, whoever you want!
---
* Folders can contain sub-folders to allow bookmarks to be further organized (Existing bookmark folders would be converted into sub-folders).
---
* Sub-folders are just a one-level organisation tool, they cannot be nested and do not have individual permission settings.
---
* Shared folders must be “subscribed” to - they do not pop up automatically.
---
* Shared folders can be linked to allow anyone with access to subscribe.
---
* There will be limits for how many bookmarks are permitted per folder and how many folders you can subscribe to at one time.
---
**Bookmarks can be set to expire automatically**
---
* We plan to add the option for a bookmark to be set to expire automatically after some time (from a set pre-determined choices).
---
* The option to expire a bookmark may be either at the Folder, Sub-folder or individual bookmark level.
---
**Use-case Discussion**
---
Now that we’ve got the fundamentals of the prototype explained, lets jump into the use-case questions! Please feel free to answer any or all of them, as they apply to yourself. Whenever possible, please try to give us as many specifics as you can about your personal use-cases (Remember that everyone plays EVE differently and no one’s personal experiences are less valid 📷)
---
&gt;**Question 1 - Bookmark Vouchers**  
---
In the current system, bookmarks can be extracted from the People &amp; Places window and converted into “physical” items that can be traded with other players. In what ways do you currently use this functionality that would not be covered by the system detailed above?  
---
&gt;**Question 2 - Bookmark Expiry Lengths**  
---
As mentioned above, when setting a bookmark to expire you will be able to choose from a pre-determined set of choices (e.g. 4 hours, 1 day, 7 days). If you were to choose three options for expiry length, which would you choose and why?  
---
&gt;**Question 3 - Setting Bookmark Expiry**  
---
As mentioned above, we are consider whether bookmarks should be set to expire at the Folder, Sub-folder or individual bookmark level. What use-cases do you foresee where you would utilize bookmark expiry, and of these options, which do you think would be the most appropriate level at which to set this expiry?
---
Thanks for taking the time to read and respond to this thread, we look forward to the discussion!

ill add one more thing to the detorid part: don't engage 1-2 afs that look like they want to fight, especially if it's spvg, they have a minimum of 10 guys waiting to jump/warp in the moment you get tackled.
---
FYI, a forum thread has been posted to discuss details of this feature proposal, following the discussion here:  [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/shared-bookmarks-use-case-discussion/171216](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/shared-bookmarks-use-case-discussion/171216)

Dope, do want.
---
Holy shit.
---
I went into this thinking I would need a pinch of salt, now I know I need a bucket
---
post the pages of logs
---
And now titans die multiple times a month, seems like thing work themselves out.
---
You may or may not be surprised to know that CCP doesn't need your logs to investigate anything. They have that covered. Report the incident and move on with your, and our, lives.
---
Yes but nobody can figure out if it actually dies anything, the general consensus is that it is broken to some degree
---
oh? that's cool.  I do kinda hope this spreads to low and high sec as well, then maybe Null will realize this isnt just targeting them and is just a story line arc that is most likely temporary.
---
Nobody is gonna use a Combat blops given there price vs reward, like in most regions you might as well use a dread ( yes i'm serious ), unless your target system is perma jammed ( most are not ) a dread is cheaper then your average blops fit before insurance.
---
“Just don’t get rammed by the Jag no-fun police.”
---
Whoops that be me.
---
Did nobody tell you? ... We play REEEVE Online!
---
You may or may not be surprised that when somebody is doing something that can potentially create loss for another player, and not just as a benefit to themselves, that it should take a higher priority than the hundreds of "report bot" reports a day.
---
"The logs show nothing"
---
RIP, didn't even look at the name to see they matched, lol. No compliment for you!
---
Meh, my feelings aren't hurt, but I try to warn people away from experiences that aren't rewarding when I can. As for evidence, "eyewitness testimony" doesn't count as evidence with you, so that's out. And I like my privacy, more substantive evidence would compromise my privacy and identity, whether you say you care about that or not. I say the bureaucracy and micromanagement within the imperium is not rewarding, you apparently think it is. I can't disprove your feelings about it, and you can't mine. vOv
---
People don't use blops for min/maxing, they use blops because they're sexy and they bypass cyno jammers.
---
Maybe. But it's not like CCP are going to trust someone's attached .txt files over whatever they have logged.
---
How long till ACL Hangars?
---
&gt;Question 1 
---
I like sending "urgaypwnd" bookmarks to my friends.

---
Alright, I can live with that.
---
I don't think the loss of a few ships outweigh the potential damage to the economy caused by botting.
---
You can replace ships. Botting erodes your capability to replace ships.
---
I'm not saying that PVP input broadcasting isn't a big issue, I'm just saying that so is botting.
---
As somebody who's never tried to roam in Null, I genuinely couldn't tell until the comments if this was serious or a meme.
---
If I ACTUALLY want to roam in a 3-5 man Cruiser/BC fleet, what would be peoples top 3 places?
---
Nice Kills !
---
Thanks, looks like a fun fit.
---
you know, you could also just do it :| Not saying shared bookmarks isn't a very good thing either but ACL Hangars are the dream
---
No, Syd doesn't play.  He prefers Scrabble, and kicks all our asses when we play.
---
i made more with different logos on it but thats the first one
---
That and the timers.... no Corp hangers to kill or possible loot to scoop. Man me and a close friend would harass towers and kill fuel haulers. Force them to offline and scoop them. We would often be able to siege medium and small towers by ourselves with a close eye on the enemies staging system. Theres no point to killing citadels.
---
What is the use case for ACL bookmarks? Is this much of a priority for EVE?
---
Everyone having gate pings across regions probably isn't a good thing for game health. Having a subscription for WH bookmarks is kinda nice, but it's never been that hard to get them anyway.
---
never realised we had trouble killing titans. that's news to me.
---
99.9% of the people dont know its a eve online logo and i dident put EVE ONLINE SPACE GAME on it either so yea, i think the logo looks good and me and my bois wanted to have a hoodie to wear over the bike gear :P
---
&gt;well of course you can't have fights HERE, you have to go to GE- on a Thursday when Mercury is in Retrograde and less than five stratops are scheduled for the next week
---
Lol, too real.
---
Was in impass recently and was told by brave that this is a no fun zone (30 people camping in one retri, too much cancer to list here)
---
The remains of brave might as well join test for a proper pve alliance
---
Nothing that gives a paint bonus will survive a real fleet encounter, and if you bring in vigils at 70 they won't do shit and are glass.
---
Thanks man.. I've thought about making more but I just cant get back into Eve, I may hop game genres and try elsewhere.
---
Truth is I'm a horrible gamer now, since I spent close to ten years playing Eve I suck at FPS games now
---
Not the mission NPCs, no.  The payment bonus is based on the system's security status and applies to the mission payment, not bounties.
---
It's a pretty hard ask. A ton of stuff about hangars is hardcoded right now. You'd either need to touch a lot of systems to make it work, or you'd have to have a very strict valve on item transfer, to prevent items from getting lost or misappropriated. We don't want to allow someone to, say, take the force field of a POS and stick it in an ACL hangar. Those are for injecting into your personal skill inventory, after all.
---
We never asked for such oppressive safety though. We were quite against the safety citadels would offer from the time they were announced.
---
This. Fuckin asset safety.
---
Well most people dont recognise it as a EVE onlien thing, and i tried to keep it in a way that its not instantly seen as a gaming realted thing.
---
ok, with or without cum stains?
---
We had less than 10 people and a 70-100 man muninn fleet was formed for us
---
Not sure what you are on about
---
This doesn't require input broadcasting.
---
They have a whole second to get those all through.
---
Yeah, obviously there's always the potential of a couple guys baiting for a bigger gang, and gangs that you can't fight, and gangs that won't fight you.
---
Yeah if you're a couple jumps out of 08 I'll probably jump in a solo cruiser or something to fight you but good luck getting me to notice before half the god damn alliance blobs you lol.
---
He bought me so many shots in Toronto I spent the night hugging a toilet. So he's pretty nice irl too.
---
Question 1 - leaving a random bookmark in a jetcan hoping that somebody will stumble upon it, and writing things as a bookmark and having it in the ship cargohold     
---
Question 2 - mainly need 24 hours option for wormholes    
---
Question 3 - individual bookmark for individual wormholes as they are probed
---
Not to put too fine a point on it, but I can go to the goonfleet dot com forums and buy gate ping bookmarks for the entire fucking game, right now. That ship has long since sailed.
---
Well thats why i designed a couple more, so you can be what ever you want :P
---
False Bob, as this one doesn’t do anything to ratters.
---
Yes, that effect is bubbles from an interdictor.
---
No, but when things are so consistent and transparent it goes from "we think this guy might be doing something shit" to "We can show with relative certainty that this guy is doing something shit". We can guarantee every times hes on that his either going to be in Muninns with a Huginn, or canes. No other ships. No tackle no Logi. Because those would be rough to broadcast eh?
---
There's a mission chain where you have to pretend to be a pirate, so you pretty much attack the lowest member of the group which happens to be Phenod's Broke-Ass.
---
Some types of rats will be more likely to fire on certain sizes of drones.  Off the top of my head I think it's generally 'anything bigger than they are', so light rats will swap really quickly to medium drones, cruisers will shoot your heavies, and advanced NPC frigates like swapping to light drones.
---
1. Does the system support a way to keep local copies of bookmarks? For example could you join a BM ACL and then decide you don’t need to be subscribed anymore and want to free up a subscription slot. Or on the flipside, you join an alliance BM ACL and copy all the BMs shortly before selling them to hostiles? Nothing against either practice, just curious how it functions.
---
2. Are different BM folders able to be turned on and off on the overview like they currently do?how detailed can that choice be?
---
3. How would the defaults work? Does it remember my last setting? Or would it go based on what list I’m adding the BM to?
---
4. I believe Fleet bookmarks were mentioned at North, how would those work?
---
&gt;Question 3 - Setting Bookmark Expiry
---
If possible, there should be an option to set a default/requirement at the folder and ACL level. “All bookmarks in this folder should expire in no more than 24 hours” would be great for wormhole folders and such. And while it’s not something I use/need now, I could see it being useful for things like having a folder to BM completed NPC sites for someone else to come salvage later, without it filling up constantly.
---
&gt;Question 2 - Bookmark Expiry Lengths
---
I could see myself using that mirror when actual objects in game expire. Wormholes, wrecks, pings around Mining anomalies, etc. would it be possible to have an option to tie the BM to the lifetime of the item being bookmarked? It doesn’t need to be %100 accurate, but if your making a lot of bookmarks regularly, it would be helpful if bookmarking a wormhole defaulted to 24hrs or a wreck to 2hrs without having to select that every time it changes.
---
&gt;Question 1 - Bookmark Vouchers
---
Only time I’ve ever had to use this is when sharing locations for fleet actions and such. For example if a scout goes out and finds POSes or pre-makes pings for key areas. Other than that, buying and selling bookmark packs is where I’ve seen it be very useful.
---
Without widow's it's really not worth it anymore. 
---
Like a small group of blopses can't protect themselves at all, while the sexy factor is still there it's barely motivation at the current price point, like if you want them to be in the meta there has to be rational reason to pick them ( and getting around jammers was way more of a selling point when defensive cyno's where less common ), these day's defensive cyno's cause most groups not currently being invaded to not have jammers up in a majority of there systems.
---
More cynos isn't actually that hard to do.
---
Hunter lights cyno, people.jump through and light more cynos.
---
doesnt that system basically already exist with corp-hangars?
---
Yeah, our standing fleet likes to sit there when nothing else is going on.  TBH I'm not a big fan of it and wish they wouldn't, but there's not a lot else to do.
---
I agree on occasion it could be possible. every single time getting it on the same second without fail? Nope.jpg
---
TEST is not going to form a 70-100 man muninn fleet to gank a roaming third party gang in enemy space. Was it FRAT that formed that? Sometimes they get bored enough to do that. We had em do that for some jackdaws last night, and then they chased us around, so we bubbled them and dropped haw dreads on em lol.
---
&gt;large population of players who get off on CCP making other people's lives miserable. 
---
It’s not miserable.  The game needs balance.  There always was supposed to be a balance to keep empires to some reasonable size.
---
1) When contracting Escalation bookmarks to other people who want to run them, I wouldn't be able to do that with the new system if I underdtood it correctly. Only instance where you actually sell bookmarks to others that I can think of.
---
2) I would set 6-12-24 hours, and an extra option for "Never". If we have to stick to 3 options: 6-24-Never.
---
3) Why not all?
---
This sounds like a great system btw.
---
With, I need it as authentic as possible
---
Worked for me for a good while.
---
My body is ready.
---
But seriously just *having* alliance bookmarks alone would be incredible! AND you're going to let them auto expire AND we're even going to be able to control them via access lists?!?!!!
---
I wish I could send team 5 O a beer, nice work guys!!!!
---
Why even wait? You'd know about how many cynos you'd need, so you make sure you have that many and have them jump first, then the rest of the fleet freely jumps to any of the fleets cynos.
---
Stop being dumb, a 10-20 man multiboxed fleet will never hit every shot tick perfect.
---
They are shared, yes, but they're still hardcoded. There are only seven possible corporate hangar locations. Adding more would require the developers to touch a lot of code, to allow a theoretical eighth hangar to exist. ACL hangars imply allowing an *infinite* number of separate hangars to exist. The entire inventory system would probably have to be touched for it to be seamless, or there would have to be a single point of entry and egress for items in the ACL hangar, which would severely limit its utility.
---
Why does this exist
---
Yeah I was in the Toronto audience when they showed that. It’s pretty startling. I know they have a bunch of stuff planned to shake things up and retain players, but it’s not going to be ready right now.
---
Yes that's what I was trying to say
---
I'd take input broadcaster pvper over 24/7 ratting bot army any day, thanks. And btw I lost a ceptor and almost lost typhoon to this guy and just shrugged it off.
---
The thera chain would be a popular one I'm sure.
---
Npsi groups using bookmarks.
---
Easily sharing bookmarks on the fly with alts.
---
This is an infinitely better system.
---
But 10 people with 2 computers in the same room could.
---
Not nearly as flexible. The biggest issue being that often blanket roles need to be given/created instead of individual assignment. 
---
Also, can’t allow anyone from out of Corp to access them is a pain.
---
&gt; Domi are a fucking good bait too, i have killed a lot of people that thought it was a domi afk pveing.
---
that sounds like a win win, the guys hunting have more interesting targets and the ones being hunted have more options to engage in pvp
---
why are they fine? 
---
why do dreads need to counter subcaps? 
---
dreads already had a role as an anti-capital dps ship. so why is a single pilot in a dread able to counter frigates when most battleships can't without gimping their fit? (scram/web/grapple)
---
so, i dont have any programming experience. but to me the ''system'' already exists!? i dont want more! hangars. i just want to be able to ''rent'' a office just like a corp can and give access do different players just like a corp already can. i dont care if its 7 or just 1 hangar. shouldnt this be possible?
---
Will the person who gets a folder shared to them have to accept it first? 
---
Minor concern about (potentially maliciously) cluttering up someone's bookmarks without their approval.
---
Hey nerds, it's yah boi as usual. Any feedback, comments or corrections are welcome - Thank you!
---
If you had rote tshirts I would buy one for old times sake...
---
Mostly just Tyrion
---
Yes. Supercarriers are the second-biggest ships in the game, after titans. With regular skill training and no injections it indeed takes quite some time to learn the skills needed, and of course to get the ISK as well.
---
Flying without tackle or logi isn't really a smoking gun.  Hit and run alpha comps don't really need tackle.
---
Several ships activating guns on the same server tick is also not a smoking gun unless you know for a fact they are all being run from the same machine.  You don't know that for a fact, but CCP can.
---
Maybe just submit the bot report and stop whining.
---
extremely well done. behold: the power of AB-only in nullsec (if you can get away with it :)
---
I agree with this. That way people arent chilling in space ready to jump a cap to a cyno.
---
First
---
Was thera just undesirable?
---

---
Ah right, I see your point.
---
If only there was an in game function to report bots.

It's not that a fleet can alpha a ship in one second. It's that 12 characters clearly belonging to a single person - based on naming convention - are landing all their shots in the same tick. I think it's possible on 4-5 characters with an excellent hotkey but the minimum keys presses to do this is 23. One to fire one to switch characters, that's essentially 1400apm 3-4x the top ranked Starcraft players.
---
Some more fun with the NPCs around New Eden. Hope you guys enjoy!
---
Ejecting items in space doesn’t show up either
---
Lol this is great 🤣
---
Asher would wreck any fleet you feed him with even numbers.
---
It's kinda hard to explain. I'll try with a hackneyed metaphor. 
---
We're going to pretend like inventory locations are a deck of cards. A deck of cards has 52 different types of cards. (Jokers are an abomination; get that shit out of my face.) Each card has its own separate identity. Hangars are like this: they have an identifying factor describing what they are and how the game should handle access to them. A corp office is like a deck of cards: It has all the types of cards in it. If I go to another station and rent an office, I get access to a new deck of cards, but the types of cards inside that deck remain the same.
---
Adding ACL hangars is like defining a *new kind of card entirely.* To allow support for types of cards with infinite variety, we'd need to go into the rules of card games and modify them to be able to support the Five of Querns or whatever. Therein lies the problem -- card games, like Eve itself, could not really handle Five of Querns without significant reworking.
---
Is that John macaffee back there?
---
We have already submit several bots report too.
---
lol yikes.
---
typicalgoons
---
Yeah, I'm not sure why I said belts - old habit, I suppose. But do the anomalies have "endless" respawns within? I've only tried high-sec anomalies, didn't seem much respawning happening in those, just the x waves of enemies. If you have to hop between - and even scan down - anomalies, it wouldn't be quite as AFK as I've gotten the impression.
---
I've really enjoyed the last few episodes that you've done.
---
That is all.
---
&gt; why should you ever be able to avoid the response fleet? 
---
what's wrong with that if you outplayed them? its not their fault most response fleets are downright vegatable levels of bad at the game, even with absurd crutches such as ramjags.
---
&gt; or is it just the krabs who are supposed to be at risk, never the mighty hunter?
---
nobody ever claimed that.
---
&gt; you should absolutely be able to roam and get kills, and you should also lose your ship as the cost.
---
can ccp add an automatic self destruct then whenever you get a kill? would sure save me the clicking if that was to ever be the case.
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/character/645875798/](https://zkillboard.com/character/645875798/)
---
Thanks, I hope I don't disappoint here. It was super hard to do research on stuff that people weren't sure about, was bugged, and then CCP turned off, but I wanted to try and capture a snapshot of what happened for the future!
---
I like the doomsday option
---
Bot reports from a couple of people appear to do very little, and I shouldn't have to hunt down a list of the guys characters so I can report them across all of my characters just to hope that CCP notices that this guy is botting **an actual combat fleet**
---
Yeah though I haven't seen it in a while.
---
ACL bookmarks is an amazing idea, far better than alliance ones. I have to say, for all the problems Citadels have caused, ACLs are one of the best QoL things CCP has ever added to the game for people with leadership roles. Thank you!
---
&gt; It's that 12 characters clearly belonging to a single person
---
That's an assumption. Probably a fair assumption, but an assumption none the less.
---
We really don't want CCP banning people based on assumptions.
---
Just move to Tama.
---
imagine being this dense \^
---
That taste of sucking your own dick?
---
It seems not more the reasonable to me if you did the majority of the work by flying to there staging and showing your comp to form something that comp can reasonably fight rather then something that go's for the sure win sadly eve is in such a shit state right now that really you have no option but to pick a group that does exactly that.
---
i cant imagine anything more crushing to your soul than:
---
1.seeing someone place an ess disrespecting YOUR alliance in YOUR system
---
2. being fueled by patriotism warping headfirst to ~purify~ the enemy 
---
3.being memed by a bunch of rats
---
A dread absolutely cannot counter frigates any better than a battleship, so im not sure what youre taking about?
---
I lived of Mordu's BPCs and Clone Tags for a pretty long time, I used the same PVP fitted Cynabal I was using to roam around, so that was great.
---
Gotcha. So y'all are the part of panfam where the non-skinheads hang out right now?
---
No that’s factually incorrect.
---
Wormholes have an entity called bob. He is like our davy jones. Once an explorer of old who got lost and never found his way home. Bob reigns over all that which is devoid of local. He was there when the drifters first spawned.

Bob takes sacrifices of booze, strippers, and quafe at the sun of anywormhole. 
---
You see. Once HK got evicted. Novac and all the other major wormhole corps upped their sacrifices and prayed for deliverance.
---
Bob has answered our prayers. He has unleashed the hordes of drifters and smiles upon non-conventual pve. 
---
May your ships get wrecked and your adrenaline spike. Praise bob.
---
oh so you think we didnt do that ? its just pointless ... also sending tickets gets you the same response from CCP like a default message.
---
DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR ZKILL?!
---
&gt; JFs are actually really difficult to use
---
you still have time to delete that comment
---
It seemed worse than the C2. We used thera a lot before that just for mobility but we Weren't crazy about staging out of it.
---
masterful bait tank and point management with the jag!
---
Took me a while to get around to watching it, and this is a quality production if I've ever seen one.
---
&gt; The TL;DL, is that goonies (and perhaps other huge nullblocs), have had a pretty rough time with these drifter fleets 
---
Literally what? Goons haven't lost a single cit. Nobody has, because the drifters don't come back for timers. I'm not defending mittens and his overly emotional reaction, but saying that the drifters are a threat is pretty silly. 
---
But hey, free reddit points. Just make a thread "bee man bad" and watch the karma go up. You even got gold. Amazing lmao this sub really is full of NPCs.
---
That abit one sided
---
[PARSE ERROR. FALLING BACK TO BEST EFFORT]
---
Yeah, if I see some nerds in our staging, I might ping a small gang to fight them, but I can't stop other random idiots in alliance from undocking and trying to jump you, or another corp from forming a fleet, etc.
---
That's always been the case, and always been the risk of fighting near somebody's staging, more random shit showing up and joining the fight.
---
Ty for this work
---
True, could be an elaborate troll with 4-12 people all coordinating perfectly timed alpha strikes to make it look they're input broadcasting. /s
---
To me, it certainly seems like enough evidence to report.
---
Bernie made it to eve. Free pings for all
---
Dont sell scanned sites, run them yourself at your own risk, selling scanned sites is stupid asf.
---
Every major fleet op I've been on in the last 2 weeks has been fucking Munins. Munins Online.
---
Why do I even own any other fleet doctrine ship goddamnit &gt;.&lt;
---
All the americans stopped playing because it's dead as fuck in that timezone.  The only thing to shoot at for the western US is the early rising chinese farmers
---
They'll be in a basket next to the chicken tendies and the state-issued gf.
---
It didn't disappoint, at all! That was a very good episode.
---
I must admit, ever since the drifters turned up a few years ago i was intrigued to their back story and i was very disappointed when the drifter incursions were bugged and removed without any real word and then seemingly ignored as the triglavians became the focus du jour and we heard little to nothing about the drifters beyond piggybacking on them to tell us how cool triangles are.
---
Lol

That's quite a high barrier compared to a simple subscribe button.
---
Depends what kind of comp. Nano cruisers or linked nano BCs: Geminate probably. Go kite some horde beans around until they remember what a Jaguar is, then put a drag bubble on the sun and do it some more.
---
Brawly shit maybe same but you'll get blobbed fast, I might try NPC Mordu's space in the north. Depends what time, though. Curse could be good if you're at the right time of day, Detorid maybe. Those would be my top 4.
---
I was out in a solo retri about a month ago, I think I dodged about ten bosons?
---
3) Folder and sub folder expiry would be useful for bigger publicly accessed folders that allow players to share signatures, wormholes, pings off anoms, etc. 
---
Given that there are a ton of locations in space that are only relevent for 1-12 hours, being able to group those catagories and have the system automatically clear out is certainly important.
---
Individual expiry is less usefull, unless the users dont want to bother with a ton of folders to manage.
---
Amusingly enough, they did change.  Cit gun/dock/fit/tether rights are managed via ACLs, a ground-up implementation that came along with citadels, but CCP somehow didn't see the need to separate gunning from fitting in this shiny new system, because as mentioned they don't actually play.
---
Good thing, then, that one, as a hunter, can also subscribe easily to this bookmark set, and use it offensively against people too lazy to make their own pings.
---
As somoene who has reported super ratting bots for months on end only to see none of them removed from the game : 
---
Aww, cute.
---
Oh boy, a fun tetanus infection!
---
What balls? The drifters don't actually blow up structures. They're zero threat to goons, because who's gonna take a fleet into delve to blow up a drifter-ref'd structure?
---
Derp i got bored
---
I mean, if you're not flair baiting, and have ever been on our fleets, you've heard PGL count down to weapons activation.  I would be willing to bet more then 4-12 of those people are all hitting on the same tick.
---
That's how alpha comps work. The names are more incriminating then the fact they all hit on the same server tick to me.
---
The reason you see this is because your cap booster (the module) has a certain capacity, as in volume, of charges that can be loaded in it. For most small cap boosters, that capacity is 12m^(3). A regular (non-navy) cap booster 200 charge takes up 8m^3 of space, so you can't fit two of them in, but you're not taking up all the space with just one. You're taking up 8/12=66.67% of the available space. 
---
Navy cap booster 200 charges, however, take up 6m^3 each, so you can fit in two of those. 400 charges take up twice as much space (16m^3 for regular, 12m^3 for navy), so you can fit 1 navy cap booster 400 charge, but not the regular kind.
---
one hit wonder would suggest people stop playing once that 'wonder' ends
---
No, the way that you are probably imagining this system does not exist. 
---
For whatever reason, it sounds like it was not built to accommodate what you want.
---
Think about a cup. Say you have a cup that you think would look way better upside down. Conceptually, you could just remove the current bottom of that cup and attach it to the current top. Now, that cup can be used upside down, relative to its original shape. But can *you* actually do that? 
---
That cup was built to exact specifications to do a very specific job in only one configuration (sitting upright). Do you have the tools to make the change? Do you have the time? Would it be worth the effort?
---
Probably not. 
---
Now compare this to a cup that was built with a detachable bottom that you can reconfigure whenever you want.
---
CCP made a very specific cup that is not easily changed. Taking the time to change the old cup or build a new, better cup is probably not really worth it since the current cup is good enough.
---
The proof is, as has been stated, in the fact that if you manage to kill his input broadcaster for that particular day all the others stop firing.
---
Fair enough not my best writing ( reddit comments and working at the same time don't mix ). 
---
It's more of a thing also calling it a risk seems to ignore the reality of well the majority of the time if you don't you can roam for 4 hours and find like shit, meaning you forced to try in staging systems leading to getting dunked by random dudes joining in. 
---
Leading to my conclusion to just plan stop fighting in k-space.
---
It's good isk and you get fights
---
Yes interested
---
Gaara's Sniper was caught on video input broadcast firing cynos on his Rorquals when PL hotdropped him.  Still took 2 months for him to be banned (2 months in which he continued to multibox several dozen rorquals).
---
CCP Security team be slow as FUCK.
---
Being ready to catch stuff on a gate is better than also having to camp 3 tacs on a gate unfortunately.
---
Also worth mentioning - as far as I know, getting around CONCORD mechanics is a bannable offence. So even if you find some way to evade or defeat them, you're risking a ban.
---
i fail to see the relevance, but, yea, it would be awesome
---
"Small" fight including a muninn fleet and a super carrier. I really want to come back, but there's nothing left for me to play I'm afraid.
---
You sure you needed that many Dreads TEST?
---
They make Alpha’s log in every couple of days just to keep their skill que full. Alpha maintenance is a job.
---
Someone was saying alliance bros buy them
---
I'll try and do a lore video w/ Ashterothi some time next week - That man is a font of knowledge, and it's high time I tap into it, especially for stuff that's so shrouded in mystery.
---
Ok, that was really fun to watch.
---
Where's that guide to increase standings with Pirate factions so those little guys help me?
---
No but it gets the faxes down faster.
---
Yeah, well, we like you.
---
Im really new yesterday i bought my First Procurer plus eq for 30 Million. Today i want to Test it. At the jumpgate it got destroyed by the drifters before i can escape. Im pissed.
---
GO FOR CSM, i will vote for you  :)

“Botting”
---
Horde standing fleet will chase anything that moves.  Doesn't matter how many ships or how big/small they are.
---
Oh, cool, I started worrying I missed out on a multi million Isk heist.
---
To be fair advertisement won't help that much. Isn't it normal that before you start a new big game you google about the state of the game and how it works? And the most posts you will find about eve are "eve is dieing" "eve stagnates nothing happens". How do you want to attract more players with such things?
---
Still are, although *if* and *what* they undock are both highly variable.
---
Need to go swing up to north insmother and see wtf undocks. What TZ are you hitting? Last time I was there around 0100 it was completely dead.
---
The TTT Sotiyos in Perimeter right off Jita gate are All Rigged. Best ones I know off.

Most of them were waiting for the supers that never dropped to sve the rorqs.
---
Aren't those private ones?
---
People have been saying “eve is dying” for over a decade. Doesn’t seem to have much impact lol
---
meh go flex somewhere else
---
Killboards mean nothing. I have seen 50,000 kills from ecm bursting ceptors in big fleet fights 😑
---
They are open to the public, and the rigs will get you the best bonuses in the region.
---
It's possible. Depends where you hit. Hitting corp staging citadels and smaller groups like 1-P in Detorid early USTZ or wherever the hell in Immensea/Tenerefis FEDUP staging is now, can get you smaller numbers in that inevitable blob.
---
When in doubt, go set up some stop bubbles towards citadel and go shoot an ansiblex and see what comes to stop you.
---
Miss you bby
---
Dumb question, what's going on with the modules in the video? The doomsday icon and warp core stabilizer? Does he actually have a WCS fit, and what is the doomsday icon?
---
So basically there’s 3 types of Nullsec
---
Delve: a million braindead people. Have fun
---
Other places: Fair fight? You mean a 20-man blob vs. a solo ship *isn’t* fair? (Actually a blob’s combined IQ is probably equal to the solo ship so nevermind: it’s fair) ~~Wait isn’t this just Delve?~~
---
Other other places: if you like ISK- then sweet; go explore/mine/whatever here, because nobody’s home
---
it's probably an overlay he has for the video
---
Oh. Ok. That’s.... weird, but at least I get it now. Thanks!
---
It's a pretty fair description tho. Stain is just Mach SB camps every half a dozen jumps or so. If you're *really* lucky you'll run into that group that does dictor drag bubbles instead. But it's not like you're gonna catch any of them.
---
Im at alpha skill cap so i dont know if i can train into a new ship
---
imagine still trying to plan a dreadbomb when every null bloc is full of spies
---
work out the timers and hiw long it would take
---
4.2 tril is 2100 GBP ?
---
wut?
---
You're waving your e-peen around and you haven't even actually gotten to 10k yet? Like, why do I care that you have 9909?   
---
I still won't care when you get to 10k, but at least that's a milestone number.
---
So how do you get the diamond rats to warp to the ESS grid?
---
You bring the ESS to them.
---
&gt;It's not about the direct capabilities of the ship generally.  
---
&gt;It's about the ease by which the large coalitions can keep them safe, which exponentially increases their power.
---
There is only 1 book where David won over Goliath, and most people are wise enough to not blindly believe in everything written in it.
---
Oh? I go out to deto in 5-10 man gangs all the time and get fights. This guy was just making fun of /r/eve.
---
Well said, this is similar to the story of Furnace/Mafia Redux as well. Most of Furnace stopped playing apart from a couple of dudes. We've reformed and are all playing again, not because EVE is fun suddenly, but because no other game gives us the same feeling. It has become more difficult to have the desire to roam each day though as 9/10 our nullsec static is dogshit. We get to pick from botting VNI's, real VNI's, getting blapped by caps, or the small tiny chance of a fight. Depressing really.
---
That was random AF.
---
The WCS, cyno and doomsday are pretty clearly overlays.
---
Lovely fights - now this is the kind of NPC/player interaction I like to see - rats complementing rather than replacing players.
---
There's no amount of marketing that makes EVE online more attractive.  You'd need to blow up a ton of the core mechanics of the game to update it to modern standards.  
---
The core problem remains the primary big-ISK drivers of the economy do not rely on interacting in globally warpable space, and all the incentives involved do not reward cooperative play.  
---
Step 1 needs to be to populate space with people playing the game.  That has always been the primary driver of conflict and every economic iteration has failed to address that most economic activity does not rely on a pilot doing a thing in space in any sort of engaging manner.
---
The problem right now is the massive disparity in skill needed for each side. For the hunter to have a chance at killing a target and evading the response fleet, he either needs lots of bling and medium skill or just a fuck ton of skill. Meanwhile response fleets just need to q click in a 40m frig
---
Hunters dont want it risk free, but they want it to be viable. Risking your 600m+ ship for a 50m ratting ship and possibly a few tackle fraga if they arent flying jags simply isnt worth it
---
And thats if they even decided to use sub caps over just dropping a bunch of carriers on you
---
That sounds suspiciously similar to the way F1 monkeys behave when you headshot the FC.
---
I bet you would literally start screaming if you saw any of my code, it's all hardcoded with no place for expansion, and when I do need to expand it gets nasty. Like 20 almost identical functions, instead of a proper one that just takes variables just because when I started I only needed 2 functions.
---
Thera sucks for staging unless you are in VOLTA or blue to VOLTA. In addition, Thera connections are on a public website that everyone uses. Also thanks CCP for putting signatures on a list everyone can see from station. One more nail in the coffin towards the nomadic c2-n-c5.
---
Production wise. TTT sotiyo in perimeter. But job cost index I think theres a few 
---
.5 systems nearby that could be better to build there and pay red frog to ship back to jita
---
We must see things differently.  Would a one hit wonder band not still play in clubs and get annoyed when people demand that they play their one song?  Because that's CCP in a nutshell.
---
Only one? I thought this was EVE.
---
ADCs for HICs
---
This. Rock paper scissors pull a gun on the guy.
---
Yeah I've also dealt with this guy and he 100% input broadcasts. If you spend enough time following/fighting this dude and his army of alts it becomes clear as day that no human can activate dozens of weapons at the same time, every time.
---
I've beaten someone with more in a straight 1v1 and i was always shit at pvp so have a *meh*
---
I legitimately had a crane that died no less than 4 times to my own POSs that shouldn't have been able to shoot them. CCP was kind enough to reimburse "USS Lazarus" all 4 times.
---
The final time was when I was taking a pos down and all the guns were offline and had no ammo. Still shot me. 
---
RIP USS Lazarus, you got jumped by instalock destroyers from wormholes shortly after the 4th Resurrection.
---
&gt; where it is difficult to commit to for an off-tz alliance
---
uh, attackers get to choose the first timer. that solves this problem 100%, remember?
---
Eliminating passive moon mining was the best thing ever done to the game. The issue is rorqual invulnerability and shit citadel mechanics.
---
You must be new to Eve.
---
##FuckSov
---
But other than that good video. I also managed to watch a few of your previous ones that I had missed the past months, glad to see you are still doing great informative videos, keep it up!
---
I'm bad at geometry or whatever that falls under but with the sides of a coin having different symbols one propably has a bigger surface than the other. (No i'm not fun at parties, i'm never invited. Don't know why)
---
people would start hauling supers into wh's lol
---
I would see this as an opportunity to reinvigorate a dead part of the game. drone durability. Forcing you to use those drone durability rigs, stay near your drones and not let them wander 100km from your ship (especially heavy drones that are slow) bringing back sentry drones in the meta or even using tech I drones because they are easy/cheap to replace. My point for the pvp part is that it was already good and now people say its going to be even better
---
We are an all inclusive community of internet spaceship gaming Christians spreading the good word one day at a time. We even let Wood Vulcan stay in here
---
/^ also a member of TTT's owning alliance, fyi
---
So what you’re telling me is that my spai toons can now provide warp-ins without dropping fleet?
---
Pff, literally the only kills that matter are solo kills with a Thrasher.
---
I forget we have also a apoc doctrine for home defense; with laser ;)
---
A quick view of you killboard makes me think you are an F1 pusher.
---
Also, zkill doesn't matter, so noone cares.
---
Still factually correct :P
---
"We were all told "use the report a bot function". We all replied that this guy has 30-40 different characters and we weren't going to do that,"
---
You said yourself you weren't going to do it. If you think it's pointless don't do it, but don't then come crying on here.
---
Whats with that "on a gate meme" always? Have you been there or do you not know how locations on killmails work?
---
Change the refinery mechanics to mirror that of POSes and allow them to be passive mined at a penalty. Then we can have some content drivers back.
---
Pretty much the state of Eve since day one
---
It wasn't so much a dread bomb as it was a 'these rorqs are dying unless you want to escalate'
---
Yep that's some top level hardcore solo bait memeing right there.
---
That Mach pilot at the start getting [dumpstered](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/357998030940798989/595473625084198922/2Q.png)  by a stabber with full meme fleet on standby...
---
Yeah, that's not right.  4.2 tril is 2100 OldPlex.
---
I don't know what 500 nuplex/1 old plex cost in gbp but multiply by that.
---
It's a system that forces those wanting to do PvP to grind PvE first. I honestly can't think of a better way to guarantee the failure of a PvP arena feature than that.
---
That's a pretty naive statement. The world is far from black and white.
---
I think I might have missed a 0 in my calculation, RIP.
---
gf, kiting noob
---
***biomasses for you***
---
itt:
---
* yeah that's probably an input broadcaster dude, did you know there's a function in game to report that and that reddit isn't the official channel for that?  
---
* okay yeah we did but KARMA
---
Your confidence is refreshing, and there is no question as to why you are so self-assured :)
---
Yeah but I am not a fan of super blingy BS roams, tight budget and I just don´t take the risks I would normally take in a T1 BS.
---
Let's take the complaints in turn.
---
 &gt;Nullification and gatecamping
---
If nullification made gate camping less useful, then CCP buffing J-space-&gt;null connections killed it deader than a hammer.  There's no point in parking a defense fleet on choke points when the hostiles are sitting in a wormhole with a null static dialing "w" for content and can appear unexpectedly anywhere.  When this became the meta, it meant that standing fleet and cynos became the only way to protect PVE ships.  Which leads to the next complaint...
---
&gt;Proactive defence is no longer needed from sov holders, and now defence is mostly all reactive.
---
To which I heartily disagree.  The nature of what you are facing has changed AND YOU TAUGHT IT TO US.  Roaming nano gangs have over grazed Eve's farms and fields for easy kills for years, and that meta has now passed.  The average nullsec pilot knows that undocking and trying to chase you down only makes things worse, because giving up easy killmails only guarantees more visits by the same crowd and others like them.  The solution is to stay docked unless a real response fleet that can counter is formed, which is more and more likely because of the consolidation caused by wormhole rolling fleets, cyno ceptors, and escalation traps making anything less than a standing fleet with capital umbrella near suicide.
---
Special mention:
---
&gt;Rorquals are still far too effective at mining
---
Do you even own a Rorqual?  Or even mine at all?  With the latest nerfs a Rorqual mines about the same as two high skilled Hulks with boost.  Does this sound like a fair trade for sticking a 6 billion isk loot pinata in place for 5 minutes at a time with a character that needs to train 30 million + skill points just to get there?  I'm not talking about sitting in the ship, I'm talking about being able to use it well enough to even think about balancing risk and reward.  Let me tell you where my calculation landed: my Rorqual now has hyperspatial rigs instead of drone mining rigs and I don't even fit an industrial core, because the only thing it does now is boost and haul for Hulks like an oversized Orca.  The time of the excavator drone has passed, prices prove it, all that fuss and training for a ship that an Orca can do the job 90% as well.
---
Riddle me this: if Rorquals mining anoms to completion and respawning them over and over has caused the crash in T1 build cost then why is Tritanium as expensive as it's ever been?  Most of the reduction in building costs has come from the crash in the price of nox, zydrine, and megacyte.  That comes from high end ores and there is a pretty low limit of that stuff that spawns in anoms, compared to spod which is literally the most ubiquitous ore in null anoms AND ALSO THE MOST VALUABLE RIGHT NOW.  I'm doing a statistical analysis on the overall  mineral cost ratios of building T1 ships and capital parts, and while I'm not finished yet the preliminary data points to CCP oversupplying ABC ores into the game via the moon mining changes.
---
&gt;Citadels
---
Look, everybody is tired of strategic citadel spam wasting the time of twenty or thirty players for 1.5 to 2 hours three times over a week to deal with something that cost the other side 3-5 man hours and maybe a billion isk.  The math doesn't add up.  But making citadels more vulnerable will just create more consolidation which is the opposite of what you want to happen.  You want to mess with null empires and force confrontations?  Try bringing entosis links and start reffing ihubs in high ADM systems.  Do enough that they will need to spread thin to protect them all, and then show up occasionally to kill a few of them.  That will likely get you fights, but it might not be the easy kills you are looking for.
---
EVE has evolved.  Your prey has gotten tougher, and now you are going to have to evolve too.
---
Makes sense, thanks.
---
Why don't you think regular caps should apply like a battleship? I could probably get behind a Titan application nerf though.
---
Thank you for teaching me.
---
I've been reporting input broadcasters for a couple years now and CCP doesn't do shit to them. Good luck!
---
&gt;Over the past 3 years 
---
More like 10.  10 years.  Arguably longer. CCP has (perhaps inadvertently) been proactively killing off what few reasons existed for people to be in space for a very long time now and replaced in-ship in-space activities with mechanically better options in stations and structures, moved them outside of globally accessible space, and/or given an option to jump direct dock-to-dock for any logistics. 
---
It used to be that if you wanted to make any sort of money at scale you had to commit time from a group of people to be in ships in an asteroid belt.  It wasn't great back then, because it was still mechanically boring as fuck, but it drove content and got people out of dock and in places and situations where they were forced to interact with the community.  EVE has managed to prop up the community off the foundations that were laid back in those days, but it's only been crumbling since.

190 vs 110

When it comes to being able to practice law it kind of is

It's ~2,100 PLEX purchases of 500. This is what I get for being old. I forgot to then multiply that by 15. It's £31,500~
---
I've spent 95% of my career as a software janitor. I've seen some shit.
---
youre an idiot pls neck yourself in game k thx bai
---
Lol yeah I don't think you know much about practicing law.
---
Yeah it's been doing it for a while. Since the industry window got redesigned I guess? Few years at least. ow only if it would also simulate an approximate job cost it'd be gucci.
---
I wouldn't call it "fucked" rather than "extremely difficult for a beginner to learn" unless that's what you mean when you say fucked.  If so, then yes, it's fucked.
---
Yeah, you have to wash between anomalies after they finish, and also watch out for the npc dread spawn. And you have to watch local or you’ll wind up dead to roamers. So it’s not completely afk, but you can easily do it while watching tv

Eh...

HG snaked frig fights in novices ain´t quite there up my alley.

In this video we can see the talent and skills in goons when they are not in a 200man fleet or a titan. Any low sec pilot &gt; goons.

wow fighting 20 retributions sounds like a blast dude

Come back to Kinakka, it beckons you. I miss Puchoco Wolf fleets, Reza whelping his expensive Golem in the large, and the perma-gatecamp on Onnamon.
---
Oh and martoh crew
---
Environment vs Environment would be the mechanism by which the map changed. NPC factions, lowsec, True-sec, all wax and wain with the actions of the major empires and pirate factions.
---
I want to like all of this but I did a double take at the end:
---
&gt;Boost NPC nullsec income so groups like old BL can come back and harass sov areas around
---
The big blocs have the power projection to make this a new farming ground for themselves. So probably make sure it's not TOO lucrative
---
I don't see that as a bad idea. But the drones aren't getting 100km away. More like 20km away is too much. And you have to be that far to maintain the speed tank required because the actual site damage is absurd. 
---
Trying to change drones without changing the sites is going to break them for PVP making unkillable drones.
---
Man i used to go rile them up when they were pretty active.
---
Anshar would like to know your location
---
Just something I've managed to totally miss being in the game, until it was pointed out to me, when I mentioned something like that would be a good idea. Hence feeling dumb.
---
Is there an active crew who camps people in the stations?

It's a national holiday week in the U.S.  Due to the holiday on Thursday, and the recent influx of drifter shitposts the weekly posting cycle had to be bumped up a bit to squeeze it all in.  We had to push the "AFK cloaking solution" post to Monday but after that we should be back to the normal shitpost cycle.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
---
Seriously, he is doing this wrong. It's possible, actually easy to setup so that when one ship goes down in a fire you simply switch to another and continue broadcasting. So he is either using video FX to manage his fleet, therefore unable to switch characters to continue fighting, or he is not input broadcasting, which would be hard to believe. It's actually fairly simple to split your fleet into logi/shooters and also have a round robin broadcasting setup on both groups separately. This guy.....hasn't done much setup
---
I suppose that makes sense. When is the cyno spool up thread expected?
---
It's still not about that though.
---
It's about how exponential this effect is. And games also aren't the same unfair that real life is.
---
1) Currently members can share bookmarks even without the CO role, by copying to personal. As long as bookmarks could still be copied and moved to personal regardless of roles, i see no issues with removing the physical item
---
2) I would prefer it to be something along the lines of 27 hrs, 53 hrs, and a month. Maximum WH lifetime can exceed 24 and 48 hrs by a bit, so would be nice to not have them die before the WH potentially does. A week is too short for OP tacticals, as those usually are made in advance. A month should give you the time to prep and not have them expire mid-op. 
---
3) Would prefer it to be at folder level with an option to override. Having to pick an expiry on every WH in the chain while bookmarking would be more of a pain that just manually purging them like we do now.
---
No, undock.
---
Go shoot something.
---
There is so much to learn that isn't just SP
---
No, don't get on that waiting train because there is always something to train next. Done with magic 14 and you want to fly your cruiser but damn, cruiser only level 3 let's wait to 5. Then you notice your medium weapon turrets only sitting at level 2 and it repeats. Do not do this. 
---
Just go out and do stuff, skills help you over time but never wait for them.
---
lol yeah ive been warned about this one, some of the locals find him hilarious
---
we're very territorial, like old mountain rams.
---
I found his report of killing one and the rest immediately stop firing to be more damning, actually.  But I always appreciate the immediate defense of botters and input broadcasters people like you launch.  CCP can prove it if they want.  Dude reported it, no action was taken.  It gets frustrating after awhile...
---
not sure if you are trolling but  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Scams\_in\_EVE\_Online#The\_Margin\_Trading\_Scam](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Scams_in_EVE_Online#The_Margin_Trading_Scam) uses buy orders
---
What downside would there be to having cynos give -100% to lock range so you cannot lock anything when fit?
---
Exception for covert cynos of course.
---
Yeah, that makes more sense.
---
Oof, in my defense, I wrote it in an insomnia-induced fever dream at 4am.
---
Can't wait for the public ACL Thera BMs that go to bubbled citadels for free kills. :D
---
The potential of Thera relies on the state of nullsec be healthy, unfortunately it isn't :(
---
People moved into c2-n-c5 in order to get their own mini nullsec PvP farm WH. Thing is nullsec sucks so much that it doesn't matter where you live. The best region to roam in the game is Provi. Kind of telling when that's the case.
---
Skilling is passive, so you could do this. However, you'd be paying not to play a game. There's plenty of things you can do with little or no skills. Just do things you find enjoyable, rather than waiting just for the sake of being "optimal".
---
Video games are a destructive investment of time and I suggest you take an 80 year break to train your irl skills
---
Fair enough. It‘s not really hard to forget about Curse. It‘s like the small city on a highway exit everbody kind of know but nobody cares about and just drives by.
---
I tried Eve a year ago and stumbled upon here after hearing about the latest drama, but I am curious about why you consider the time investment as no barrier but see the subscription as one. Answer that and you'd be some way along into seeing what you are looking for. I was personally into many of the same roles as you (industry, trade and logistics) but just saw the time investment as too large as I didn't want to dedicate daily blocks of 30 minutes to do anything but station trading and wanted something more immersive than I could do while alt tabbing.
---
If the money isn't an issue per se, definitely feel free buy some ISK and skillpoints though if you have an income. I would have gotten more out of my foray into EVE if I hadn't had to wait so long for skills and had some initial capital to make mistakes with.
---
LOL. Last time I fought you guys in Tama was hilarious, I ended up killing a couple of T1 fit frigs and by the time the 50th or so guy landed on grid I died.
---
I was in a 5m dragoon. gf. 10/10 would get blobbed again.
---
Is joining an alliemce srp team a good way of learning fitting theory and getting into understanding fleet comps, hopefully setting myself up to become a good FC?
---
Getting carriers dropped on your cruiser is not a learning issue.
---
Your Galmil allies are doing pretty ok in USTZ 
---
Hit us up
---
I, for one, appreciate yalls structures for my indy alts
---
smart observation dude i dig it :)
---
Very nice guys.
---
MinMil, your friends in GalMil are always interested in some fun. Hit us up.
---
Period Basis sounds like a nice place
---
No.
---
"Skill Queue Online" is a game we all play sooner or later, because life happens, other games happen and burning out is a thing, but this fucking addictive game keeps pulling us back. 
---
But doing it because you "want" or because it gives you a (false) sense of security is stupid; just undock and go play the game ffs.
---
You can't fix someone's addiction problem by eliminating addictive activities -- that just makes people dependent. 
---
I've played a lot of hobby style games and it is clear that EVE belongs in that market. The problem with hobby games is that thousands can be spent, and needs to be spent to keep the game moving and adapting. Magic, the all-time king of addictive games and the gold-standard in card games, will always be both a dangerous addiction and a masterpiece of gaming. 
---
CCP will need to learn to navigate this space with wisdom and intelligence to avoid turning into a succubus, but that is not a terrible challenge to be avoided. Those who call for the end of all hobby-style monetization of computer games are simply saying players can not be responsible for their own actions -- and that is just garbage.
---
A lot of salt in this thread. I’m happy that you are excited dude. Glad you are enjoying what you do. Keep on keeping on. 
---
o/
---
Damn that would be nuts.
---
We just make bad decisions. A lot.
---
Calling us panfam at this point is a bit of a stretch tbh.
---
I've bought some VNIs now that the price went down. At the current prices I might actually end up using them for PVP at some point!
---
soo anyone knows a good one near amarr ?
---
Its ok man. Thanks for the offer anyway.
---
Open map, set it to active pilots in space. Open the map on Zkill as well.
---
Damn, that's nicely hidden in plain sight.
---
I see three ships there, you filthy blobber.
---
Why are you always so fucking toxic?  Were you not loved enough as a kid?  Loved too much?  If you post, it's always angry, and it's always over the top.  You're a clown.
---
Good talk
---
slander
---
idk we do USTZ fleets pretty much nightly in BR.
---
There is one old anomaly thing in hisec which does have infinitely spawning waves, apparently it’s technically against the rules to leave a ship orbiting it 24/7 but I wouldn’t be surprised if CCP didn’t actually enforce that
---
Wormholer btw.
---
Obligatory: OMG agreeing with Olmeca
---
Also, I am holding out thin hope that this is merely a disorganized phase 1 to a much more substantial shakeup, where when your empire expands too far (define this as you will), it starts getting more and more drifter attention. Ideally supplanted by player attention after the drifters make some sort of foothold etc (or whatever. You get the idea). Because player versus player is always better
---
- An attack battleship that can fit capital guns similar to attack battlecruisers and using battleship guns.
---
- T2 battleship than can fit a jump portal generator to bridge other subcaps (not limited to recon/covops role like the covert one).
---
- Capital-sized strip miners for Rorqs.
---
- Super-titans that can have a rack of doomsdays.
---
- Sub-capital doomsday weapons
---
- New kind of cruiser-sized bomber that can use guided bombs.
---
I'm not defending anything, it's obivously all very suspicious, but hardly 100% dead nuts smoking gun guilty.
---
Also, I would rather CCP prioritize actual botting over PVP input broadcasting.  Both are hugely shit, but one affects a small number of people, the other fucks over the whole economy.
---
I'm not basing my findings on feelings though. You said designated ratting and exploring areas. That is a flat out lie. This can be proven by checking the ratting rights page on the GSF wiki.
---
The things I called you a liar on were not based on feelings, but verifiable facts.
---
Kinakka is a blast but rolling out the nullsec static is way better than roaming 30 jumps. Only takes 4 battleships and you're teleported to a new area.
---
Unironically got a cloud ring hole last night and fed in black rise \^_^
---
The problem with the unused space not gather folks is that pvpers like to over fish. They shut down people so hard that players have flocked to safety on numbers. The problem isnt the game, it's the players.
---
Terrible numbers and positioning for the Eagle fleet. Muninn fleet could have gone practically afk and still mopped up. Dropping faxes the definition of throwing good (ships) money at bad (situations). 
---
Do better is all you can hope for.
---
Too bad he doesn't like games you can't just jump in and be good at right away.
---
You might want to look more closely at some of your member alliances then.
---
I don't think that adds to "retention" since those people are probably not even to the point where they'd know what you are talking about.
---
classic pl, showing videos of the glory days of may 2019 cus they ded now
---
I surrender! If u kill me I'm reporting you now.
---
thetering with agression time(pve or pvp timer)r should not be possible,give hunter a chance to probe down the bear
---
The sad thing is that we downvote it but we know its true. These days, a new player CAN'T just go roaming in a cruiser in null. There will either be insta-align VNI/Ishtar/Gila bots which use POS bookmarks because coders are lazy, or nyx's that will blap you on contact which you can't kill without an expensive trig doctrine or a 50 man+ fleet.
---
sure not the ones palying the game...idiots at work
---
EVE will always suffer on Twitch because it’s not a game that has that minute-to-minute excitement. Also opsec lmao
---
oh
---
Querious is lit, Evicting SMA is fun.
---
At least it looks pretty.
---
It shouldn't need to be 100% justice systems convict based on a preponderance of evidence l, which the OP seems to have demonstrated clearly. If it's good enough for actual courts it should be good enough for our bot detectives
---
This isn't even true...
---
I wish that was enough. I have no idea what you could do to EVE to make it more Twitch-savvy.
---
aye, I live and prefer Thera now too but every so often I log into my FW alpha and go shoot some shit with a rifter.
---
Doesn't matter to this conversation. Now fuck off little kid and let the adults talk.
---
ty
---
Mmmk
---
What the hecc is that Stabber fit
---
Time is something I'm able to invest more readily than money, at the moment. That's all.
---
I'll see what I can do, though! Buying ISK and skillpoints is gonna be something I'll consider going forward; and I'll test out the industry, trade, and logistics jobs before fully delving into them, to see if I would actually enjoy them. Anyway, thanks for sharing your own experience, it's actually given me some important insight into this whole situation.
---
Clearly on the test server.. PL can’t have fun with titans and super capitals anymore
---
Isn't that what they call the butterfly effect? Ultimately, all the small things add up, and the result is basically an empty game. This is clear in amarr/minnie FW space.
---
It seems to me that external marketing is not the problem, though there's always room for improvement. It's not new players that's the problem, it's player retention that's the problem. The game (product) simply doesn't market itself. 
---
I gather an aimless, slow-paced point-and-click reading simulator doesn't garner a lot of staying power. And the demographic it likely appeals to, at least initially, probably aren't generally the most social lot either; so you're probably looking at a niche within a niche (Social intellects).
---
Thus the only way to really expand the New Eden universe is, I dare say, another Dust514 done properly (Or perhaps an actual game like a well developed FW) in order to invite a wider audience into keeping it alive. And no, the current PvE implementations hardly count.
---
It's not though, every single thing OP has described can be explained without input broadcasting.
---
Hits on same tick: not hard at all with a cordinated fleet.
---
Stops shooting when you headshot FC: pretty much the same behavior as your average Test fleet. No target caller, no targets.
---
No logi/tackle: you wouldn't need logi/tackle in a hit and run alpha comp.
---
I'm not suggesting that this isn't a case of input broadcasting, I'm just suggesting that if I were accused of something, I would hope CCP looks a bit closer then players can with the tools at our disposal, and I would hope that they take the time they need to get it right.
---
Who's goona make me? Not a sad snivelling shit Lord like you. Now go suck on a shotgun you cunt.
---
Would be interesting, but presumably access lists would not allow everyone to make and edit bookmarks.
---
If eve scout made it, then it would be credible.
---
T2 small assets.
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
Other than trying to refine a bit at each, can anyone tell me which is rigged with the t2 hi and null refine rigs? Used to use a cit 1j out but it was gone last I checked.
---
Using a titan is cheating.
---
Question: are you a goon?
---
well i guess it was a successfull test of thing to come for null (at least i hope it). think of it waht you want but at least you cant say that null was boring for the time it lasted.
---
I've never been on a fleet with that many losses from a single destroyer (in fact, I've only been on a couple of ISK-negative fleets despite generally more losses than kills, one because some people decided to pay our cruiser fleet a visit in capitals), but I can see it happening. Generally, we find some sort of T2 ship which alone puts us ISK positive for the entire roam.
---
If you want to take a break from the game or are thinking of quitting but unsure if you will come back, definitely leave your account subbed with a long queue if you can afford to. But don't stop yourself from playing if you want to. The game used to encourage this kind of thing much more back when we had Learning skills and such, it's definitely a good thing that all that is gone. No reason to subject yourself to it.
---
You’re absolutely not wrong.
---
when you afk orbit a site and let the drones wander freely, they can kill what ever target they wish it doesn't make a difference. you dont get hit (because of your speed tank) drones dont get hit (cuz npc AI is dumb and never switch). this is a problem. First your speed tank should fail as you get tackled by frigs (npc frigs are too slow and dont web enough) and a vni should be forced to manual focus frigs as primary on every wave in order to maintain this speed tank. or simply use something slower and tankier (rattle/domi) or even range (100km sentry ishtar). 
---
TL:DR : changing NPC behavior or anom themself could fix pve rather then changing the VNI.
---
Why would that matter? It’s a corny fucking mechanic with no counterplay. A shitty mechanic is a shitty mechanic regardless of who it’s used against.
---
I don't think those are mutually exclusive.  A very large portion of the playerbase refuses to play this game, or any other, sub-optimally.  If you make the optimal gamestyle either harder to find, or more engaging (even if it's objectively harder than the optimal ones today) you make a more interesting game.
---
Suppose that you could just print ships for free without mining the minerals or acquiring the blueprints.  Push button &gt; receive ship.  No cost.  How much of the playerbase would continue to mine and build ships?  or would most people just push the print button?  I'm suggesting that supercap umbrellas and near-perfect intel are eve's equivalents of that button and that while they're here, everyone will press them because it's optimal, even if it's less fun.  I'm also suggesting that their removal would make for a better game.
---
No, but I have seen the positives and negatives to camping. 
---
As positive whenever Fraternity formed we knew about it.  Its good for us, as it made it easier for us to respond. But is it bad the game lost that element of surprise?
---
I have also seen the negatives which is Delve Pest Control camping almost a whole region. No content was created, they just camped all our systems to make ISK.
---
Question : are you a Dino?
---
Dual prop xlasb. Super fun frigate.
---
Will do!
---
“Called out” yup you sure did wooo baby I’m roasted...ROASTED!!  Holy fuck shit the bed.
---
Have no idea what that even means, I run highsec incursions.
---
No :P
---
A large number of Horde members are of the opinion that it will be a cold day in hell before they take orders from mittens.
---
Haha, alright! Sounds great, thanks.
---
don't forget the Empires of EVE trailer video! I made that one with Andrew Groen. I wrote the music, filmed, and produced the thing. Andrew wrote the script. Hit me up if your interested in original music. Obscurity X in game.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WkYqWn3HSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WkYqWn3HSQ)
---
Should CCP intervene? 
---
If Jita is being camped; shouldn't HS adapt?
---
Did you blur out the jump to destination just to link the kill where it happened anyway
---
I started to play EVE hard after the "I was there" trailer. Still my favorite. :)
---
Not sure why there are so much salt in this post
---
This dude is good
---
Hm? Only killed I think 2 guys lol, the next 10 killed me but by the time I died there was like 50 nerds on grid lol.
---
Not sure I understand this comment, the point of this discussion was about counterplay... isn't that what you just said we need? The way you commented makes it sound like you was cloaks to be removed? If so that would remove a fair bit of fun content. Cloaking is super important for the game, we just need to make sure its active cloaking and not AFK cloaking.
---
Agreed.
---
smoothie spotted
---
I see, hmm. Well, that's probably good, since last time I was interested in anything pandemic flavoured y'all had a bit of a nazi problem.
---
Or you can scan with out of Corp toon :p
---
TEST's icon is a dinosaur
---
I mean, if you knew the meaning of called out you would know that is exactly what I did.
---
Were you shaken as a child? Is that what is wrong with you?
---
Make EVE actually interesting and no multibox needed.
---
Yeah kind of like in laws
---
Wow, that escalated quickly. Hope you enjoy your ban.
---
It's managed to unite the out of touch circle-jerking leadership as 1.
---
Bro I did this last night. Noticed a few missile skills low with some other things, 106 day queue...
---
Stop this crying about AFK cloaking. We dealt with it for 16 years. Stop being a pussy and begging for help. Learn to fight people who decloak on you and or bait them out. Thanks.
---
so what was this about skillpoint deals which were broken shortly before this drifter invasion?
---
I miss the days when people would pay for access to an online game and then everyone in it was on a level playing field to succeed or fail on their actions, without being able to throw a credit card at the hurdles.
---
What if i just take a permanent break from irl instead
---
The us tz content revolves around tama and timer fights between snuff/wangs and everyone else lol
---
Go get that shotgun boy
---
thats a super neat poster dude, GJ
---
*raises hands* 
---
Random thought... What if plexes were based on ship value vs type? Like novice is 12mill small 24mill medium 50mill kinda thing.
---
Yeah, i find the keys to be faster than the scroll wheel as well... to each their own
---
Gotta keep it opsec lmbo
---
Cloaks should use fuel. Easiest way I could think of to change them for the better.
---
TBH, that would make a degree of sense: QN- meant little to legacy until a week before the invasion started when it became the only place you could titan bridge to our new system in detorid. I am not quite sure what the ethos behind the targeting would be though. FRT and horde both got their main staging hit while 1DQ, L-5, 08- and D-P are all outside the invasion. In immensea it's the 08- JB target that got hit while 3 krab heavy systems around D-P got hit. Maybe the drifters just want to carve out their own little empire in delve? ;)
---
I wasn't trying to be toxic, sorry if it came out like that.
---
But please do elaborate how a quick glimpse at his killboard doesn't show that.
---
So basically Geminate takes the cake again
---
There’s a difference between working together and being pets. You just have to read Gobbin’s ping to know we’re open to working with anyone else
---
Absolutely. If the only realistic use of a capital was shooting other capitals I think it would be a big improvement.
---
Then we'd get some serious market manipulation
---
I'd give it a try. There's still space, as always, to make your own fun and content. If you like smaller stuff, there's space for that, and even within bigger blocks there are corners of space and Corp (or sigs within corps) out doing their feeding and trading in kills on smaller numbers. 
---
Brave is recruiting, btw ;) - and as you know, we definitely don't have big toys.
---
"Cloaky camping with 20 accounts is a bad mechanic with no active counterplay and should be changed" is my opinion.
---
Nobody has even been shot by a ship that was cloaked.
---
Gold for you
---
Targets.
---
All that means is weak and hobbled alliances are good fodder for pvp.
---
Hmmmm, doesn’t quite work that way lol
---
Very cool looking
---

I emailed [security@ccpgames.com](mailto:security@ccpgames.com) about Iron Crown's corp "404 Corporate Not Found" \[404.C\] on ***March 4***\*\*.\*\*  I used the Report a Bot function at the time on every single character of theirs. Excerpt from my email:
---
&gt;*The player corporation 404 Corporate Not Found \[404.C\] has been observed for some time to perform incredible feats of coordination, including taking wormholes, decloaking, firing their guns, and activating sensor boosters at exactly the same time.*  
---
&gt;*Today, they were warping 29 Tornados in perfect sync around their system of J100858. The moment one of us\* pokes our head outside our POS bubble, all 29 immediately warp on grid, align out and warp out in perfect sync. I and Lhut Ameist also personally witnessed \[404.C\] activate sensor boosters simultaneously at precisely Monday 03/04/2019 13:22 EVE Time.*
---
\*I was in POS Party at the time, other corp members witnessed it firsthand. I also attached this image: [https://imgur.com/a/2BXo8hC](https://imgur.com/a/2BXo8hC)
---
No response came from CCP. I didn't expect one, but... I am sad to see that the "--Thera" broadcaster is still running around unopposed. Fighting them was downright unpleasant.
---
I should add, at the time, all of the "Thera" ships were flying Tornadoes named ***Tavaril Fays' Tornado.***
---
As seen in my screenshot, that character was present in the March 4 fleet.
---
Perhaps it may be presumed that they are the character which originated this broadcasting group.
---
CCP installs loudspeakers powered by [RTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator)'s in the walls of every subscriber's home.
---
Have you actually stopped and taken a look at the raw dps output of the NPC in Havens and Rally Points?
---
Power to them if they will do all that to fit a jackdaw in a novice
---
Cloaky camping doesn't bother me. It's a valid tactic to attempt to suppress the economy of an area that is otherwise heavily fortified. A countermeasure to an umbrella.
---
Your options are:
---
- Risk it and keep doing what you're doing.
---
- Bait the camper and take them out.
---
- Let them win by going elsewhere or stop earning entirely.
---
EvE is supposed to be a dangerous game. Get over it.
---
Near Anamake seems to be the place I get blobbed the most.  It other systems I get 1v1s or I use my d-scan, see multiple ships in a plex and then nope the fuck out of there.
---
\&gt;guy stares at screen for twenty minutes

Do you know what this sounds like almost 1:1? PIBC's excuse for botting. "It doesn't get punished so we have to do it because everyone else is doing it since it's optimal". PIBC killed Serenity, take from that what you will. 
---
(I'm not saying that you are the only ones that should maybe overthink their stance, but Test as an entity and you in particular Dran have one of the biggest impacts on the current stagnation)
---

---
The bigger issue is that a very small roaming gang can kill a battleship fairly easily if they know what they're doing. There's no counter-play to a HAW dread without upshipping and just getting dropped by more caps/supers.
---
What are you talking about? I'm actively encouraging people to fight... You like cloaking, that remains... you like fighting, that remains... I honestly don't understand what your comment was against, just seems like salt to me.
---
Might leave horde so I can have something to shoot
---
Good idea, so you could remain cloaked for a period of time. But would at least need to resupply.
---
Why are you such a whiny piece of shit?
---
Nope. As well it seemed like they did it on purpose. He warped back to gate and aggressed. Probably trying to bait in some capitals or something. Word has it there was a Frat fleet waiting in the wings.
---
T3 frigates, t3 battle cruisers?
---
AFK camping and automated local intel sharing are two sides of one crappy coin. You can't fix one without the other and not send the overall balance further down the shitter in the process.
---
Lmao I read this as you jerking off in a mirror hahahahaha
---
No, what it means is massive nullsec empire coalitions are not good for PvP. We need something in between, which is what we used to have.
---
What alliance did you think he'd be in?
---
We still love you Seddow. We must all shower our content providers with much love and affection &lt;3
---
Oh yes.. This. ACL Hangars set between your characters, regardless of station/structure would be absolutely gold. \* No more contracts!\*
---
Looks like someone ran out of new players to blob then laugh at. That is the real issue with FW. It isn't a mechanics issue, it's an asshole issue.
---
Abyssal fits would screw with that idea blinded to tick but no way to putt an isk value on it
---
I love triggering r/Eve.  It's honestly to easy.
---
Faction ships have a  bonus to LP earned from plexs. I.e if you are fighting for the Caldari State and capture a FW complex in a hookbill you get an extra 50% LP
---
Why yes i'm doing that. Adapting to the post ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah, no. We don’t need local chat be buffed to an even more powerful proximity detector. AFK cloaking stays I’m afraid, as it has for all these years, until CCP gets around to tackling how local chat and intel work. 
---
It’s just a name in local chat. A name can’t hurt you.
---
Honestly we would survive, you would have to pay attention to if you are in dscan range of any holes, use combat probes, cloak only when you need too.
---
I would expect some stuff in return, like real-time dscan and combat probes, along with expanded launchers fitting on more ships.
---
A lot of people saw how these would affect the game.  And told CCP.  Repeately.  But REEEE GATOR DON'T GIVE A FUCK HOW CHANGES WILL BREAK THE GAME
---
this is 100% awful advice.
---
God yes there must be something wrong with me cause there’s CLEARLY nothing wrong with you at all
---
They probably are input broadcasting but complaining about them warping around in a coordinated way... it’s called fleet warp and regrouping.
---
Moving, not living in NPC stations, etc ...
---
... I can only imagine someone riding the cruise missile in like in [dr. strangelove now.](https://youtu.be/snTaSJk0n_Y?t=106)
---
Thankfully, contrary to popular belief TQ's botting problem is orders of magnitude less impactful than Serenity's is.  But you're not wrong, I suspect that Serenity's problem was one of policy enforcement than it was one of culture.  If you put TQ players under the same set of rules I think 95% of the player base would choose to bot or quit.
---
For the record, I'd be in the quitting boat, unless it was genuinely interesting to write eve bots, then it would just be a more fun screeps and I'd be 100% for that
---
Botting as a mechanic sucks only when it's generally understood that the players are supposed to be playing themselves.  Botting can be hella fun when it's a core mechanic to a game (factorio, space engineers, screeps, etc) and I think your comment about the state of serenity is actually a great argument towards the point I was trying to make.
---
to be fair, curse should really be included in "China south". All the same comments apply
---
Weird, to tell you the truth i think the minnie frigs are overall the best frigs in the game right now. :)
---
&gt;I use   
---
&gt;https://localthreat.xyz/  
---
&gt; to see whether they are PVP pilots.
---
I'm a newbie explorer too. Thanks for this tip. It's saving my ass right now!
---
But in reality what happens is...
---
\- You setup a response fleet to bait the camper only to realize they do nothing but camp for ISK wasting your time and those you play with resulting in no fun. Even if you do get to go back to normal activity once you know. You still wasted peoples time. 
---
\- You gain intel on your enemy before they attack you leaving little room for surprises. Many enemy alliance Supers are already docking while larger alliances undock after forming. Its not that you can't surprise an enemy, but it reduces the element of surprise and reduces content by making nullsec safer. 
---
So in reality it does the opposite of making EVE more dangerous. It actually makes it more safe and less spontaneous. I don't get what your issue is considering cloaking isn't going away. You just need to actually put some effort into it.
---
I'm honestly debating on finding a nice WH Corp. Last time I played (2009-2010) WH were released but I never bothered with them
---
Good post and hopefully CCP realise that if they don't provide mechanics that encourage hunting, roaming and risk for incumbents and ISK generation, then Eve stops being a fun game and people will stop playing it.
---
People are applauding the drifters because, however badly, they are making the defensively stable nullblobs worry about their stuff. What we really need is game mechanics that allow players to do that.
---
The one big thing you missed out is local. Drifters are an unknown threat because they don't appear immediately in local, and if that were true for players too, you'd see a lot more guerilla hunting.
---
Normally, I would agree with you and would always want to give someone the benefit of the doubt, but these pilots were doing far more simultaneously than just fleet warping. 
---
They were activating modules in literal perfect sync, just like in the OP. 
---
They moved as one.
---
Shot as one.
---
Activated modules as one. 
---
Unless they are
---
1. A hive mind
---
2. Have inhumanly good FC-to-line-member fire control discipline that transcends lag and space
---
* ... yeah, no, I'm going to go with saying they were input broadcasting. If it quacks like a duck...
---
In the current meta, you will never fire your boson on another capital in Eve as GSF. No one will do engage in a Titan brawl with GSF. You're wasting your time. Part of the reason I sold my supers and left GSF this week. You're fooling yourself.
---
Good tip for those that have missed this. However a word of warning.
---
About 50% of the time bonuses are not being applied correctly, so the material amount / time are not showing the correct values. If you only need the me bonus without using a structure it'll work just fine. But as soon as you need the values with structures it will show the incorrect values.. I think it has to do with rigs.
---
&gt;multiboxed fleet
---
Learn to read idiot
---
BUT ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO KILL RORQUAL!!!!!!
---
It would make w-space less easy to escape... that doesn't seem like a bad thing for me. I would prefer cat and mouse. Not pressing d-scan only to realize the cat is care bear.
---
What i meant wasn't about botting in general, it was just the same excuse they used. "We do X because if we wouldn'tdo it others would do it and beat us with it". There is different "optimal gameplay" within the rules on TQ, but the outcome seems to be effectively the same.
---
This would be awesome, I like combat probes. But have only found them useful for scanning down static ships with no mobility. It doesn't feel like they can be used for cat and mouse gameplay as much as I would like. You depend a lot on visuals looking at directions enemies warp and scouting the direction with d-scan rather than probes. I think revamping probes and d-scan could really mix things up and create better content alongside cloak changes.
---
I'm not the one who said someone said they couldn't read, when that clearly was not what they said. I mean, it is blatantly obvious you are a moron.
---
The fact that this guide exists means Eve is in a bad state.
---
Wouldn't that give gal mil with the comet a huge advantage over say min mil with the firetail?
---
Neither you nor I can fight human nature, it's up to CCP to weaponize it into something fun
---
yeah i agree let's get rid of supers
---
Riiiiight.  Ok then
---
You cannot hit on the same ticks consistently like that. Coordination doesn't matter. Everyone has their own latency to the server, and if you combine that with the difference in reaction time everyone has, it will never happen. 
---
The only way you can get that kind of consistency is if the commands are issued almost simultaneously, such as when input broadcasting is used, and you have the almost exact same time to server, such as if they came from the same location. 
---
I know you're trying to be the Devils Advocate, but you're out of your depth trying to argue this point.
---
Magic 14 is a trap, especially trained to 5 before you train anything else.
---
You will waste month or two training them, and your ship still won't deal more damage or hardly tank more, you will still only be able to fly frigates, and use t1 guns, cause you rather trained that skill increasing your shield recharge rate by 5% (which is neglibile outside specialized passive recharge tanks) instead of small guns.
---
And then you will sit afk another 2 months to train some skills that actually help you more.
---
I have to say ... if they're not going to enforce the rule, why does it exist? 
---
I am not saying this is at all an ideal solution, but if CCP can't control the situation they might as well legalize input broadcasting again so that input broadcasting can once again be legally fought ... *with input broadcasting.* Because as things stand, the ban only hurts legitimate players who have to suffer through this bullshit.
---
In cyno opsec?
---
Careful all that spooge doesn't clog your keyboard
---
My point was not that they weren’t broadcasting but that you can do both things. Speaking from a documentation perspective, you want to focus and hammer on things that provably input broadcasting, and not muddy the waters with “... and they were warping together!”. People are eager to catch broadcasters, and I understand why, but if you want the security team to respond effectively (not that it should be this way, just addressing the practical reality of the situation) then you have to be concise. Don’t give them examples that require lots of legwork to prove it was or wasn’t broadcasting. The above combat log is a perfect example of good proof - a bunch of similarly named characters all hitting at the same second.
---
Very nice and perfect for phone wallpapers.
---
I'd rather be prepared for the worst rather than be disappointed when  expecting something else... 
---
Maybe it's some past psychological trauma but hey, if it works, why change anything...
---
If by that you mean camping high sec holes. Then sure.
---
boohooo !!
---
Yeah. In FW sites, it's a bit different because not everyone realizes that you have to slide the plex due to having so many first-timers on the fleet. But the hardest thing that FC's have to learn is not to order a jump without the scout having tackle because our frigate fleets operating out of Amygnon invariably have enough people that anyone outside of a fleet watching local who isn't a complete moron is going to dock up unless it's a system like Tama where people go with the intent of dying.
---
You don't need t2 guns. Get 4/4 gun and ship skills, and use a faction gun. It works just fine.
---
I get what you're saying. That's why in my email to CCP I specifically mentioned the Sensor Booster activation and the timing of it.
---
Simultaneous Sensor Boosting is not a thing that is built into the game mechanics.
---
I mean yeah but galmil fight against the Caldari and the amarr in fw and the hookbill and crucifier ni are good counters to a comet. And it wouldn't just be for frigs but all faction ships.
---
Magic 14 is a requirement after a certain point. But I do agree new players shouldn't feel the need to train all of them to V before anything else. Perhaps CPU and PG.
---
Hell, my 32mil alt *still* dont have Warp Drive Operation V
---
This "hurr durr it's all on CCP" is getting incredibly stale. It's up to you how you play the game. CCP doesn't force you to Blue/NIP anyone and anything you can.
---
That sounds like a good plan.
---
Lots of things in Eve function strangely, get used to it
---
As always, TEST wouldn't engange if the numbers are equal...
---
Nope. You're all done. PLEX up
---
This idea doesn't change the fact that currently, for a fleet of 200 thirsty nerds to jump/bridge, each pilot only needs two mouse-clicks to land within scram+web range of the cyno. 
---
Don't change the cyno, change the jump mechanic.
---
Citadel, in concept, was one of the best expansions ever.  The new carrier RTS mechanics are awesome.  The death of the slowcat and spider caps was a great move.  Faxes were an excellent addition.  QOL was vastly improved compared to living out of a pos... Etc etc.
---
In implementation though.  Oof.  I can skip over the list of faults you all already know about and say that the real failure was the lack of iteration.  Issues galore were ignored for months or years and each passing day makes the core problems harder to solve as proliferation continues.
---
You've gotten several answers, but I just want to say this:
---
In Eve, you're not a space pilot. Go play Elite Dangerous for that.
---
In Eve, you're an immortal spaceship *captain.* Your ship is expendable, as is everything in it.
---
Interceptors/Dictors have best chance of catching one, but a friend of mine uses Retributions to good effect. I have a similar setup with Hawks, but I haven't actually tested it out yet so all I can say is that it works on paper
---
Heard!
---
What do you mean? My Worm is totally equivalent to that guy's shield tanked atron.
---
Where are the Drifters now? They're like, gone now.
---
Smart move by CCP, ensuring that EVE will truly last forever. After the last human player has left, the AI will keep fighting itself.
---
It would hardly have an effect.  More skilled players will keep preying on them until they learn, no matter how much you change the mechanics.
---
Tho plex sliding oughta be brought back.
---
Being ‘blobbed’ by 197 characters in your own space.
---
Just forget about it. The post is sadly incredibly accurate as to the state of PvP in null.
---
&gt; [cite multiple examples or ...](https://youtu.be/V8XTpCwicwE)
---
Cloaks need fuel. AFK cloaky system campers are by far the least risk vs the effect they cause. This game should reinforce the concept that humans need to be in front of the computer. Maybe possibly use charges like fleet assistance modules. In either case, something that limits their use to 3 or 4 hours if you choose to run a cloak non-stop.
---
Looking at the killboards, around a dozen died within the last month. Most of them were to smaller entities like I said in my previous post. Only a couple were to big blocks. Given that there are now fleets of hundreds to over a thousand Titans roaming null space, only losing a handful a month is a drop in the fucking bucket. That's the problem you so conveniently want to ignore. 
---
I'm sorry you finally got in to your endgame ship and are now terrified of losing it. That's Eve though, and what we have going on now is counter to what Eve is supposed to be about
---
Killing **players** is not condoned and that will likely result in jail irl
---
Killing capsuleers for no good reason tho that's the good shit MMMMMMMMM
---
Oh that's bullshit. Suitonia's post provides some clear reasons as to how CCP contributed to (if not created) the problem by heavily incentivizing empire building and consolidation. Players are just hyper-optimizing as they always do, but it's not the players' fault if the optimum state is the current one.
---
just use this ONE WEIRD TRICK
---
Get off your phone jackass.
---
Remove the missions from FW.  
---
Remove the shitty PvE LP from FW for plexing.  
---
Only systems next to enemy faction can be captured, making a front line for the war.
---
If you are not in a militia then you are flagged suspect when you use the acceleration gates and while on grid. (The suspect flag time keeps resetting to max while on grid)
---
LP rewards only for capturing a system, enemy militia killed (anywhere) and ships killed in plexs that are not your allied militia.
---
Allow people to sign up to pirate militias and capture systems for them - ZERO LP rewards at all from the pirate factions. You want to pirate then you have to fund yourself from loot or something else.  
---
Upwell structures owned by a militia corp only allow allied militia members to be on the access list. In FW space Militia members can not use Upwell structures that are not in FW.
---
Yeah they feel a lot less effective at least
---
Can i just send Exotic Dancers to disrupt the capsuleer
---
Oh you’re [still responding?](https://youtu.be/LVnEkYtUgKk)
---
1) Wormholes are random, safe logged cloakies and nullified ships are not. Wormholers generously bring you content and you decide to shy away from it or regard it as a threat to your sandcastle empire and unleash a "standing fleet" of assorted capitals. Disgusting.
---
2) You're playing a PvP game and you're gonna tell line members that "less PvP is better"? How about endorsing solo decision making and taking risks for once. This is how FCs are born. Roaming nano gangs is what most of us signed up for, few of us decide to actually go out and do and are more often than not punished for it by either straight up denial of confrontation or smugposting about how we weren't good enough to deal with a 50 man blob for 3 AFs roaming through your space. The nerve to tell us that the meta has shifted while you're just too shy to admit you're too risk averse of undocking and fighting on fair terms is absolutely baffling.
---
3) A Rorqual is safer at mining because it is worthy of an alliance wide response. PANIC while allies form up, light cyno when FC tells you to, suddenly there's at least 30 friendlies on field. This will not happen for an Orca and 2 Hulks. The fleet required to take on a Rorqual is also much more of a concern than the fleet required to take on an Orca and 2 Hulks. These 2 factors alone make Rorquals difficult to engage and therefore make them more productive. If I jump into a system in my Enyo and there's an orca mining fleet out, they will dock up. If I jump into a system with my solo Enyo and there's 5 Rorquals in a belt I will see "we're at the colossal" in local chat.
---
4) So you're saying we should be participating in sovereignty warfare just to get small fights? Nullblocs already treat 5 RLML Caracals roaming through their space as a potential threat to their existence and respond with assorted capitals. And here you are suggestion for us to dedicate big fleets to contest sov just because we wanted to fight, only to get blobbed into oblivion? Lol
---
I suggest you fit up a couple hundred ships, undock, and lose them before you even try to assess things as "meta". You seem to lack a lot of experience on a lot of important matters.
---
Well. A sorry state of the game. I still remember going down to catch getting into V-3 or GE-8 and having fun fighting brave 1 on 10. Sad to report it is hardly the case lately. They either just undock in hurricanes and blap you or just do nothing and avoid you. 
---
Querious used to be kinda good. Delve only if you can fly booshing dessies and just boosh the excavators off. Yesterday I went through tribute, tenal, venal, pure blind, branch and the whole north for like 60 jumps and nothing happened. Only a few interceptors going places but that is all.
---
Had more fun in LS trying to catch people doing FW
---
You're forcing the cloaked person to fight more or less _immediately_, not when they get into position, not when they judge the situation to be favourable. 
---
There's a downside to the cloaker, and zero downside to non-cloaked PVE'ers floating about.
---
We are somewhat sure they had to be manually reset each DT to keep spawning, and uh - Someone decided not to press butan.
---
Cloaks should use capacitor like every other active module. Why they get to ignore this principle is beyond me. Granted it should be a relatively small amount, but somebody shouldn't be able to stay cloaked indefinitely unless they are fit to be cap stable.  
---
Cloaky recon and T3s would be fine most of the time, but small frigs shouldn't be able to maintain unless they fit modules to be stable
---
Wouldn't it make more sense to just restrict faction/navy hulls and fitted modules then?
---
Just make Local behave like w-space. 
---
Push *everyone* into Constellation or Region chat.
---
why would you have to do that? I dont live in an NPC station
---
One simply never leaves Horde. You always keeep a toon there as a spai
---
Usually 0400ish
---
This is great
---
Vouchers are obviously used by escalation runners and DED sellers. We also use them to transfer bookmarks to temporary blues to get people in and out of wormhole chains, but that use case can be replaced by an ACLd folder.
---
Common expiry lengths would be 'until downtime' (wrecks), 18 or 26h (wormholes, with the ±10% on their 16/24h life), 3 days (combat sites). But 1/2/3/4/5/6/7 days would be good enough I think. Only 3 options? Why? I guess I'd go 1/3/7 but there's no reason to restrict so much, or to not allow a free entry time period.
---
It would be good to be able to specify a default at folder level and then override that on an individual BM.
---
Haw dread counterplay is just fucking warping away.
---
I still fail to understand what your point is. What are you trying to kill where you get dropped on by dreads?
---
If I visit Boston I make sure I buy British Tea and dump it in the arbor
---
Threadly reminder that CCP wants botters in the game, if they didn't they would be gone. 
---
Also threadly reminder that if bots go away, things will be very different in game. Less resources available will be felt.
---
Youll just get a bunch of rookie ships on dscan in your capital instead
---
Repeat on other account until your CC overheats.
---
... anywhere in fucking null? Are you seriously surprised to hear somebody being dropped by caps regardless of what they're flying? Are you fucking serious?  
---
The point being that nobody can get any fights because people either don't undock or just immediately escalate to caps. And there's no counter-play to that unless you want to escalate/upship. That's small gang roaming in null dead. Which was the issue being discussed. At least if a defense fleet came in battleships, which you fucking mentioned, you would have some way to counter that by *playing the fucking game* instead of warping off and fucking off to somewhere else for hours with nobody to fight anyway.
---
Oldplex calculations..
---
You are so old.
---
Oh well, better not drop caps then unless it's within 1dq super range 😜
---
I adore Dunk Dinkle's videos
---
Currently there is zero downsides to the cloaker. You cloak and you are gone from overview. Noone knows if you are afk or not.
---
But will they reddit post?
---
Care to provide your own advice then?
---
You never stop ratting/mining. You stop your alliance dies. You always have a standby fleet that will save you at a moments notice. Or yeah you just move on to somewhere else.
---
So my question is why?
---
What is that system, being camped so effecting your style and why cant you or your froup counter it?
---
Okay but I'd you HAD to, which region would you choose?
---
You don't actually live in wormholes, do you? Adding cloak decay and making it impossible to just sit cloaked indefinitely would make wormhole space more difficult by requiring you to manage your cloak and hunt more intelligently rather than sitting around all day waiting for a barge with no stabs to undock. It would also make it more difficult for people who are living in a system because they can't just sit cloaked on wormholes indefinitely.
---
And unlike how things are in nullsex, wormholers actually *want* the game to be *hard*.
---
stop posting
---
A name can call down absolute cancer at the push of a button.
---
And this would be a perfectly fine feature if local was removed or delayed. Like, say, CCP has already hinted at doing.
---
What a completely pointless waste of time post of completely zero substance.
---
Your character will be skilled if you go that route, but you won't.
---
I have 16 in queue until May of next year.
---
So your mad that people drop caps on roaming gangs in thier space instead of E-honrurabru pvp? 
---
The reason they are dropping caps is because you are disrupting thier farm so they can go do some empire building. 
---
The other option is you just get blobs bridged on you that you also have no chance of fighting. That's what happens when you poke the hornets nest of big nullsec alliances. 
---
I'm not sure what your'e expecting.
---
That's not at all what is being suggested. What is being suggested is that cloaks have a limited time of effect, perhaps several minutes or even a few hours. Cloakers still have plenty of time to get into optimal position under this suggestion, they just no longer have an unlimited amount of time to do so.
---
Surely we should be making this game *harder* and not *easier*?
---
“EvE” Online, nothing out of the usual here
---
His own, paranoid, right-anarchist-themed alliance. I think this js pretty obvious.
---
&gt; o why is a single pilot in a dread able to counter frigates when most battleships can't without gimping their fit? (scram/web/grapple)
---
haw dreads still need shit like grapplers to apply, and you can deal with them by just staying out of range. While i'd prefer it to not be something in the game HAW dreads are easily the least problematic of the caps when it comes to applying to subs.
---
We already do.
---
I mean, THEY do.
---
what are you talking about?
---
Harder for *who*?
---
I daresay it's currently hard enough for hunters, and not hard enough for ratters.
---
Its been mentioned in other comments, but basically less intel gathering for larger alliances. They would need to actively spy or have active spies in other corporations instead of a clocked AFK ship of all the enemy alliance formation Keepstars. 
---
Additionally it would reduce those profiting from leaving alts in systems, its common for groups to take ISK to put a character in another alliances systems and leave them online and AFK for days and sometimes weeks.
---
EVE is all about rock, paper scissors and risk. There is no risk involved in staying AFK clocked in a system to gain intel or grief others because it doesn't require an active play style and can't be countered.
---
Can't activate *any* modules while cloaked. 
---
I'd call that a downside.
---
Because some redditers just want to watch the world burn.
---
Praise be to CCP Habakkukmarks
---
Sounds good to me, give me something to chase and create content for me is better than nothing.
---
No Passive moon mining. Only active. The slot mechanic for constellations seems interesting. Would mean you would have to pick a constellation for industry the other for staging etc etc. And it would be maybe good to have the sovereignty of the system determined by the people who own more points. Also definetly no POS mechanics as the bashes were horrendous. But I would welcome if the structures had only 1 timer. 48hrs long and only the keepstar would be the one that had 2 timers. Maybe each 48 hours apart. That would maybe make a bit more of a risky gameplay and actually make deploying citadels a tactical deicsion and not just whoever can drop more and secure the grid faster. 
---
Suggestion: Maybe also make corp assets never go into asset safety and if the structure has been reinforced you cannot take out assets from corp hangars so you would have to have spies/reliable intel to tell you where the enemy will stirke. Probably isn't the best idea but whatever. Lets make eve more risky cuz it isn't atm.
---
If you select the structure, after selecting the blueprint, I _think_ it's right.
---
Pearl Abyss's track record is pretty shitty, but CCP claims they are still in control of eve... Which isn't very encouraging because they aren't that much better than PA at running their game.
---
" Did CCP truly change their attitude towards the players and start  listening to them after 2013 when the players rioted? I've just watched  the "Eve documentary shot in 2013" in Iceland. " 
---
they backtracked for a few years, waited for the noise to die down and then went right back to focusing on the in-game real money store, and have now reached a point where they are selling 1 million skill point packs in the "Starter" kit to the game and running events that involve loot boxes and daily log in rewards.  Theme park MMO status here we come.
---
Could you pls share the fit on that Cyna ?
---
Haven't been active with that ship in ages.
---
I'm not trying to be the devil's advocate, I'm just not going to be involved in the outrage of the day today.
---
And yeah, you can hit on the same tick. You don't know that there aren't 12 dudes in the same room, or on the same campus or whatever with the same latency.  You need to make more assumptions to say they definitely can't all hit on the same tick.
---
No u
---
Ok. But really what do you want to do while cloaked. Yes you cannot activate them but do you need them in the first place when cloaked?
---
I have no idea what am I looking at. They somehow escalated highsec FOB to diamond dreads?
---
I'm not, actually. Did start playing when I was 12 though.
---
They have agile pvp entities inside these empires. They just happen to snuff out all comets.
---
Hello! Regarding Expiry:
---
Options for both 2 hours (Salvage sites) and 24-48 hours (wormholes) would likely be ideal for most K-Space groups. I'd also use it for relic/data sites that I want to have bookmarked but might not be perma-watching so a scanner might come sneaky run it and an expiry would help in that regard.
---
WH space.
---
Yeah that's a great way to get yourself kicked out of an alliance, while the enemy has paid neutrals in system and they have a fleet op out just keep ratting and mining in those caps and supers. Most larger alliances have capital fleets on standby, but if you want to win a battle you plan to win. Not responding to some tackled rorqual. Don't get me wrong, I love response fleets they are actually some of the more exciting bits of content. But when the intel comes in most larger alliances will begin to mandate people pull in supers. That's as standard as standby fleets.
---
*so old*
---
Its one thing for 12 people out of 200 hitting the target on the same tick, but 12 people in a fleet of 12 (with similar names) hitting the target on the same tick? Somewhat less likely.

It's two NPC groups fighting each other without players involved. AI vs. AI

I'm not sure what direction you're looking at it from. I'm the hunter hunting the cloaked ship... It makes hunting more fun, and both parties are involved in a cat and mouse situation.

---
When you can sit around all day waiting for the perfect time to strike and just drop a bunch of bombers or a capital fleet with no counter, hunting is too easy.        
---
Every strategy should have counterplay. If there's something you can do with no ability for others to counter it then there's something imbalanced there.
---
Takes a serious pussy to care about what other people think about what you do in your free time.
---
I don't know anything about Pearl Abyss but if they are South Korean isn't that overall basic fact a potential positive as the Koreans are possibly the most serious kind of MMO people on the planet?
---
Someone needs to start unironically asking "what's your fun per hour?" Cause this game is getting super boring with lack of unscheduled content.
---
This could be mixed, small gang kind of depends on you knowing enemies are in system. If you're looking for a fight quickly its nice been able to jump into a system and go to the next knowing you don't need to waste your time. 
---
I like the idea of w-space local all over, but CCP would need to do something better to encourage and make small gang easier to find targets. Faction PVP has potential, but not sure how many people actually do it.
---
ha ha good joke fellow human being
---
If you're not flying covops and you aren't nullified then a good gate camp will kill you. If you don't have a cloak at all then even a part competent bubble camp will kill you - you just have to accept that as a risk of exploring with such a cheap fit (or as an alpha).
---
The tactic with a bubble camp is to MWD-crash the gate, if you don't have a cloak. With a cloak you can cloak+MWD and try to slowboat out of the bubble, but a sabre can decloak you if it's on the ball and you are unlucky.

I'm guessing some of it at least is dissatisfaction with the current state and direction of Eve, as discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c82xno/the_real_reason_why_everyone_loves_the_drifters/esjevh5/).
---
Eve Uni is a great choice and you can move on when you feel like you're not getting anything out of it any more.
---
OH dude!! You are a GOONSWARM member! haha I've been watching a video about you and your friends and how you had a massive online battle! You and your fellow GoonSwarmers are famous! Even I know about you and have read about how you don't give a Fxck about things and just say it like it is with an aggressive gaming attitude that's made you famous!
---
The video I watched was called The Fountain War! Even as a non player it was exciting to know about it and watch it!
---
Lmao holy shit only 16 😮
---
Eve is dying is a meme.Nothing serious.
---
Wait, how are these npc? They are actually real people.
---
My combat probing Hecate disagrees with them not being useful, dscan is for sure the first line of tracking something you see warp off though.
---
Literally the server fighting itself
---
I told you! Total control over their lives first!
---
*Then* reveal ourselves.
---
Start fixing your logic bug immediately!
---
I think you have that backwards. You need to make more assumptions to say that 12 people have every one of those aspects in common than not. That's like saying that a planetary alignment is more common than not.  
---
I think there's been more than sufficient evidence put forward to say with almost certainty that this is a case of input broadcasting and your motives for continuing to argue against it in light of overwhelming proof is suspect at best.
---
IIRC real time dscan is too CPU intensive on the server
---
Please don't
---
I fought one in the PvP abyss room. That's a good use for them I guess.
---
Absolutely fine with making drone boats be much less effective in PVE. At the moment it's a no brainer decision to use drones and the other three weapon systems don't get a look in.
---
The site damage isn't absurd. What's absurd is expecting to be able to run the combat sites in nullsec in a solo cruiser.
---
Koreans are the most serious pay-to-win kind of MMO people.
---
I don't believe PA is doing anything that results in the ruin of Eve-O. I have enough faith that top-level CCP execs are more than capable of ruining it on their lonesome.
---
CCP does need to make more adventurous changes to Eve right now. 
---
I doubt they realise it, but they need to accept that large portions of their development budget has to be burnt on trying shit and seeing what works. Making changes, then rolling them back isn't as bad as what the pencil pushers in Accounting will think.
---
The thing is I believe players have a right to know what they're investing in with their time, love, passion and money and I totally would be so angry if my beloved game was changed into something beyond all recognition!
---
I mean for instance let me sum it up in one word!!! STAR CITIZEN!!! Whatever has happened with that but ...just imagine how you would feel if you had given thousands of dollars six years ago and believed in the dream. For me that would be a dream game and I've been on their sub and it's full of people who have invested in the dream and live a hopeful life. I hope that the people in charge are genuine and they are all not being played I really really do!
---
Games are real, they are composed of real people giving their most precious commodity of all and that's their time that they'll never get back so I really want to know what I'm investing in and if it doesn't look right I'll not be investing. I'm not going to be a STARCITIZEN sitting around talking STARCRICITISM
---
I thought Khimi Harar are some Amarr roleplayers? Or is that the joke? I am so getting whooshed here...
---
Sometimes I wonder if CCP security team is just three guys who are extremely overworked.
---
Where is proving conduits?
---
10/10 fine cuisine
---
We are roleplayers. We fought the Blood Raiders to a standstill just now. They were attacking our Fortizar for reasons unknown though we have our suspicions why.....
---
Hey I wanna be a bit more practical - can I SEE you scan? all the blah blah about skills and stats are nice but there's more to it than that. Hit me up and I'll let you in on some tricks.
---
I honestly can't see how it's even remotely true or based on anything. To me it looks like a normal healthy business curve because the past five years it's "stable" I'd say wouldn't you? There's no decline at all it's matured and maybe can go through another growth phase but it's increased from the days when I first became aware of it back from 2005 to 2009 and not only has it increased it's stabilised so the "Eve is dying" really is kind of strange....
---
Zkill classifies it as NPC because the losses belonged to NPCs
---
Reality: Not attacking rental space
---
Conclusion: afraid not.
---
&gt;     INIT does NOT run kikimora fleets... we run stuka fleets that include kikimora
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; i'm gonna go ahead and call this a weak-ass semantic argument
---
fucking hell you're right, elo's been running scimitar fleets all this time and we didn't notice
---
Nope. All we know for certain is that several accounts with similar names missed on the same server tick. That's it. Anything other then that is speculation and assumption, and there are ways for that to happen besides input broadcasting.
---
It definitely could be and probably is input broadcasting, but without CCPs logs, we don't know that for sure.
---
So maybe we let CCP (with their access to way more data then we have) do their thing.
---
ah, so it's one of those live event things like Kahah, gotcha.
---
Start training up now, and either play or don't play depending on your preference at that moment in time?
---
Wrong
---
Confirm Diamond Rats are hitting High Sec structures?
---
You’re not to a get good answers here, the joke is Eve has always been dying, the game continues to be developed, my corp in WH space has stuff going on, we get in fights, there would be more if we sought that out.
---
I’ll add, because I’ve seen it other places, Eve isn’t some match based RTS, the server that runs  Eve is a very specific type of server cluster that can’t just be offloaded to AWS, Eve will not run without cash and expert upkeep.
---
Hardeners.
---
Prop-Mods.
---
SeBos.
---
Three things I would find useful while cloaked. 
---
Yes, I technically don't benefit from two of those while cloaked, but activating them immediately is added load for me while hunting.
---
People are just not going to do them then because the payouts are tiny.
---
such a small world
---
This amd give covert ops ships a small fuel bay. Amd reload is a min. Basicly make them the same as command links/bursts.
---
&gt;A month of subscription is worth about 1B isk.
---
Since when? 500 Plex is 2 billion+ now.
---
No they jist cant sit in system all day cloaked. Only a few hours at best.
---
Then move on.  All you’re doing here is 10/10 trolling or contributing to a narrative you yourself can’t understand.
---
Drones have the best application to rats. Tracking and signature isn't as big of a deal. You can't really hit frigate sized rats very easily with battleship weapons aside from drones. Plus ammo cuts significantly into the tiny payouts. 
---
But making the rats aggro drones full stop like how sleepers do doesn't just nerf drones, it makes them a non starter because of how high the site damage is and the fact that drone bays aren't big enough to use drones as ammo.
---
Immensea deserves a bit more love. Frat skews the perception a bit. FEDUP, Warp... they'll give you good, well balanced fights (for the most part).
---
So you're bait. You're not hunting. You're waiting for a hunter to bite on you.
---
Don't try to spin it like you're off prowling around.
---
If you bought all the packs did you just sell off the MPTCs and extractors for isk or did you train any accounts/alt toons into something that makes revenue?
---
So this is known as a “bitter vet” and would benefit the community writ-large to simply follow thru with his threats to quit the game that he claims to hate.  
---
You ignore these sorts of idiots here.
---
Oh really! Ahh yes that was one of the really interesting things about Eve. There is a central shard concept where everything and everybody is running in real time and they can slow down time? That seems pretty epic.
---
So can you see it ever being possible to close it down? The thing is that fans don't give up. Let's look at another situation that you might know about. Does anybody here know of a very famous band called Rush? Well they were never main stream and nobody ever really knew about them, they were never talked about much in the main stream press and they were never played on radio stations around the world but they were one of the biggest and best selling bands of all time and it was because their fans were the most loyal.
---
I see some corrollaries here... I mean I've been researching Eve for a day or so and I've not stopped reading blogs and watching videos here and that just shows the draw of Eve. I think it's similar to WoW but in a different level 
---
The video I watched was really good and it said you can make other players cry with emotion when you destroy things they've build up over years! It's true! 
---
Even the "steroetypical" Goonswarm who are like the "gansgters" and Neer dowells of Eve online seem to be true as the first poster who posted on my unpopular thread was a Goonswarmer and I've been told they don't give a monkeys about what anybody thinks..
---
Now I've been downvoted 17% so nobody is going to comment but he did! Like a typical gangster
---
Careful who you idolize there kiddo
---
What's your fit?
---
I've recently been running l4's with a leshak, got T2 disintegrator and training for battleship 4 currently, it seems pretty decent. 
---
Not sure it beats the rattle, but it definitely seems to require fewer skills. I'm having fun with it at least.
---
Even the player characters are in a npc Corp that cannot get into with legitimate means
---
Plus a CCP dev was present, so must be some dev event or role playing
---
Well based on my logic would you say that it would be impossible for Eve online not to be here for at least another 10 years?
---
They definitely have one of the most loyal fanbase and are owned by a profitable larger company so irrespective of the direction or the in game money making which is everywhere now wouldn't you say it's going to be futureproof?
---
Uh
---
Yeah, and the guy next to the burning house with a can of gas and a pack of matches could have started the fire, but lets not presume anything since we didn't 100% see him do it
---
Provi. Also known as the Farm land.
---
Those are players. I'm like 99% sure those are players and Squizz is taking the piss. Just look up their KBs.
---
I find ways to make fun :)
---
Praise be to Bob who art in Anoikis.
---
This man playing eve with multibox more than 5 years and ccp dont give a shit.
---
&gt; Capital Command Processor I  
---
Jesus wept...
---
Do eve shows and host public events where opsec doesn't matter, tbh. I'm not a good public figure, but I'd be more than down to support behind the scenes for more events and shows.
---
Hey guys! This has to do with an ongoing story arc involving the Amarr Empire and some potentially traitorous elements within it.
---
**What happened today?**
---
Around 18:47 Eve time, we (Khimi Harar) received word that our Citadel in Tanoo was being attacked by Blood Raider NPCs. This is unusual even with a Forward Operating Base in-system, but we didn't think much beyond getting a gunner on-station - until the initial gunner reported that there were in fact Blood Raider dreadnoughts among the attacking fleets!
---
We pinged hard for defenders and managed to get a modest defense fleet on-station in due time, being joined early on by fellow Amarr-loyalist alliance PIE. I got to fleet a bit later, but turned up within ~15 minutes of things getting started. What followed was an hours-long slog as we chewed through mutliple waves of Blood Raider NPC dreadnoughts and other subcapitals. Later, Phoenix Naval Syndicate also turned up to assist us.
---
By 21:00 Eve time we had wrapped up most of the attackers on-station (some had been delayed reinforcing a nearby Azbel), and a Khanid Navy NPC character arrived. Some terse but 'friendly' words were exchanged with the Amarr defenders over story reasons, during which we also wiped out the FOB in system.
---
Special thanks to all those who came out to lend us a hand!
---
Hunting is hard. Dropping a fleet on something is easy.
---
It's part of an ongoing RP storyline. The devs spawned dreads in the system and RPers responded when we noticed. It has to do with all the blooder attacks on the planets and the discontent between the Khanid Kingdom and the rest of the Amarr empire. We've also done things like pay 200b ISK for an auction for an escaped criminal and turn them over to Lord Sarum. The whole thing is really quite fun.
---
Yeah but I mean they are "infamous" I should have said.
---
I agree the game will persist many many years.  Some will hate the way it evolves, others will embrace it.  The community will ebb and flow.  Thing to remember this game is what YOU make of it.  Don’t like blue donuts... don’t participate with them and fight them instead!   Want to join the ranks of the vast mega coalitions and wage wars over huge swaths of space... you can do that too!   Want to learn the ins and outs of markets and corner commodities in whole regions of space?  Do that!
---
No.  
---
Just join any active corp/alliance, and go fly/kill/die.
---
:D
---
Oh they’re infamous.  Dig deep in to find out why.
---
The irony being it was the smugposting (likely from mostly highsec/lowsec) about drifters burning down goons/null that sparked this "embargo" in the first place XD
---
&gt; Immensea deserves a bit more love.
---
not really tbh
---
Quality contribution, definitely needed its own stand alone post
---
That makes perfect sense! Yeah and as you say everything changes and evolves. They have those loot box things everywhere in all of the most popular games such as ... battlefield and also GTA V so that's nothing that's going to spilt the enjoyment of the game.
---
The only thing that did cause me to pause was that you can buy your way into success. Gareth Vlox from Goonswarm said that you can buy skill point packs!
---
If money can buy you an advantage to me that's a fundamental rule  that can't be broken because then that means it's not a level playing field and there's no fun, no game left it's the legal version of hacking and essentially it's cheating to win which is pointless to play as it robs every single player of authenticity.
---
How many Capital ships did Goons take North? Eve is what it is.
---
Yeah you can have fun.
---
But if you don’t wanna log in it’s also not the end of the world.
---
Please keep fighting in scalding pass, TESTes is boring as fuck.
---
Stay the fuck out of Covryn.
---
Excuse me I am not a NPC and Khimi Harar is very much a player corp
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility  
---
If there is no decline in the past 5 years how come theres give or take a quarter less players on average now than 5 years ago?
---
&gt; Geminate: “You didn’t bring enough ammo” 
---
Made my day, lmao
---
Oh really? Well I saw a chart based on MMO playership so let me check yours
---
That's dope, dude. I'm glad you kept it Triglavian.
---
Some people just have to be shitters and blob everything that comes in sight, ELEET PEEVEEPEE
---
You’d have better luck recruiting miners in high sec
---
Thanks for proving my point.  You offer nothing, ever, as far as I can tell from your posting history.  Do you get a special award for being so edgy on Reddit?  Or does it just fill some void in your psyche?
---
&gt;So this is known as a “bitter vet” and would benefit the community writ-large to simply follow thru with his threats to quit the game that he claims to hate.
---
Other than the part where didn't say I hate the game and didn't threaten to quit you're spot on... you must be one of the classic CCP defender players who thinks everything they do is well thought and implemented and vets are just too stupid to appreciate it.
---
So exactly like I said?  
---
Power creep on both ends kills the middle...
---
Why is this so fucking hard for you morons on /r/eve to comprehend...
---
"EVE is dying" is a meme that is around since 2003 that can't be denied, but the game is past it's peak nevertheless.
---
&gt;The whole event appears to a purely punitive design where large null blocs are forced to deal with tedious waves of the same npcs every day, several times a day without any reward. From a customer point of view, this is purely a time waste inflicted by the company on null members for playing the game along the mechanics they themselves implemented.
---
Wait a second... So when CCP fucks up Null mechanics to the point where we end up in this mess to begin with, it's cool. But when CCP adds new mechanics that tip the scales the other direction, it's a punishment to people "just playing how mechanics allow"?
---
Hmm...
---
Titans? Lame. 
---
[I just used a Loki.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74140441/)
---
Oh are they the group responsible for corrupting one of the employers of the company and somehow got a judge to steal lots of players stuff? OMG!!! That was not game play that was I don't know what! That I don't feel I can comment because I don't know enough about it but was that them who did that? 
---
The people who stole other players stuff through foul means and essentially it was like hacking really that wasn't game play and I don't know how they did it but none of that stuff is game play i mean even what little I know if that chapter I know that it's not good, admirable or even a strategy it was just plain theft and breaking trust of friends...That's the lowest of the low.
---
If you start with minmatar, you spawn with a free roll of duct tape in your cargo bay.
---
You have a mwd which means you can try the ckoaky mwd trick. It's more suited for larger ships but may save your ass when gating into a bubble. 
---

---
I'd like to buy a SNUFF hoodie so I can staple the bill for a certain astrahus onto it and send it to Razer.
---
Goonswarm are quite awesome!
---
Yes it possible to close down, CCP runs out of cash and looses control of the IP and someone else will not deal with the system and they will remake it and it’ll be better, or worse, definitely different, hope there are enough people that stay subbed that that doesn’t happen.
---
Yea, Eve is kinda a underdog game, it’s always been around, has a cult following, and the people not into it think it’s too hard to get into, too hard, or space Excel.
---
Never have or will play WoW so I don’t know.
---
You are getting downvoted because you are asking a lot of questions and you don’t play, play, try the game as alpha, then ask questions, you’ll actually be contributing to the game, there are too many posts like yours here.
---
Honestly, mining and selling the raw ore will be one of your best money makers as an Alpha pilot. If you can find a friendly Upwell refinery structure which allows you to compress the ore, then it’ll be easy to move it to market and sell. Until your reprocessing skills are maxed (or nearly so), you’ll get far more Isk for the ore than any minerals you can reprocess out of it, especially if you’re in High-Sec.
---
They were spawned directly by someone in CCP for an event. It's not a new mechanic.
---
yawn at this RP nonsense.
---
This isn't exactly the same thing, but yeah, more or less.
---
Maybe he was fueling his lawn mower and accidentally started some shit on fire. Who knows.  Maybe we should figure shit out for sure before we thrown him in jail.
---
Yup you can basically spend real money to obtain a special in game currency known as PLEX, which has value in the in-game economy and can be sold for ISK, which is the basic fundamental currency type.  Using ISK, you can buy special items from the player market known as skill injectors, which contains 500,000 skill points.  So by paying real money you can in theory “gain an advantage” but all that really buys you is time.  The skills you obtain from injectors are no more or less powerful or impactful than obtaining skills the usual way, by queuing them up in your training queue and waiting.  
---
New players like yourself should avoid this trap and learn the game mechanics and allow you queue to progress naturally.  If you inject your way into dreads in the first week you’ll know nothing of the various other ships and compositions that will easily kill you.  And then you’ll be left with no knowledge of the game or able to replace your blown up ship (the old give a man a fish vs teach a man to fish tale).
---
If I'm cloaked all day, then I'm not actually playing. 
---
If I'm not playing, then I pose no real threat to you. I pose a *possible* thread, but not a real one.
---
Have you tried doubling your ISK in Jita's local?
---
No, I haven't.
---
Or you could go buy in jita. Will probably get a lower price.
---
Someone, several years ago now did the maths on what would be needed to gank a single CONCORD ship, one of the smallest one. 
---
The maths said it was possible, with enough players and enough alpha. People laughed and said it couldn't be done, that everyone would get banned. CCP remained silent.
---
A massive fleet was arranged, people from all over New Eden, null, low, wormholes and even highsec all piled into a system with tornados, catalysts, talos, vexors, brutix you name it, people brought it. 
---
the initial CONCORD wave was triggered, the target was called, the countdown to volley was passed and dozens of played fired. 
---
Sadly, not many actually fired at the CONCORD ship. Predictably, many were only there to loot wrecks, to pad killboards by shooting at gankers, many failed to fire such was the instant lag caused and the CONCORD response was swift. 
---
The attempt failed due to so many players turning up to sabotage it, typically EvE. But the maths, the maths said it *was* possible 
---
(disclaimer, this was a good while ago so my memory is fuzzy and things may have changed)
---
fair play. afk?
---
Nah I just choose to see positives and enjoy things rather than shit all over them constantly.  
---
When I feel it’s no longer enjoyable I’ll just quit like I did with WoW after 8 or so years.
---
:doubt:
---
Also, sounds like fucking *great* news to the wormhole and empire space industrialists. By all means, drive up our sale prices.
---
Well I wouldn't have guessed that. I suppose because it's so sophisticated it requires special management and can't just be popped onto any old server as I was thinking in the same way that CSGo.
---
Thanks for answering the questions and your opinions though!
---
yall should be able to stunt on tenal and branch eeeeeeeeasily. props for bringing this playstyle back. its about time someone grew some balls and brought it back.
---
Sure, i would say the same if i was an NPC.
---
It is correct.  I have used and tested this feature extensively while developing 3rd party industry tools.
---
Knowing where enemies are works both ways -- the defender is less likely to know where the attacker is. Constellation chat will likely promote a more active/roaming *defence* of space. 
---
If I'm roaming around in some other fool's space, I will gladly fight their roaming defence fleet.
---
Sounds like that button is the problem, not the name that's pushing it. 
---
Change jump drives!
---
&gt; I don't get what your issue is considering cloaking isn't going away.
---
Just posting my opinion from the perspective of a large null block line member who has to deal with being on the receiving end of cloaky camping, and that I think it's fine how it is. It's just another facet of EvE-life.
---
Emergent gameplay, a viable EvE "career" (as you mentioned people being paid to do it, in addition to being one of the few ways to impact very fortified umbrellas, by suppressing the krabbers and making them move elsewhere or choose not to undock that day for fear of getting a bomber fleet dropped on their carrier before anyone can come save them.
---
they (r-r) actually dropped a keepstar and moved their supers into tenal to prevent getting stunted on
---
that and they have a hard krab fleet cutoff at like 1700 so all that's left to frag when i get home from work is vni bots :smith:
---
All the shit stains who stopped playing eve and post on reddit instead need something to do :(
---
Beep boop error error 
---
Terminate program
---
.
---
Please do try the game as alpha, r/Eve is not the same as the community inside the game (you actually have to play), its chat channels, forums, and all the corp and alliance Discords hidden within. This is all memes and shitposting on reddit.
---
Ok I didn't realise the numbers were going down it looked like they were holding steady.
---
I don't know why game development companies don't focus on the players. Why don't they listen to the players who love the game and play it! That includes listening to the new players and seeing what they like and slowly evolving it into the correct direction.
---
Eve have something unique there's no question about that. You used the word "cult following" and they are probably the most loyal type of players around but I think you have to listen to them....
---
I think the fact that it's a paying subscription model would be it's saving grace. Numbers don't really mean anything in terms of business because it's about profitability and profit comes from players.
---
I'm not sure but I don't think there are many subscription based MMO's any more, maybe WOW and a few others but not so many and that alone is a good thing as Eve can always put up the fees per month and if they listen to the players those hardcore players will pay the extra. 
---
If I was paying something like 20 hours a week paying £20 per month would not be a problem which still represents good value when you can't even go out with your partner to a pizza hut for that amount. So in one fell swoop they could still function on 1/4 the population size by just increasing rates if they had to
---
He’s showing you how little he cares, duh
---
I want to clarify that we drifters don't specifically hate those bee people, but their leader seemed very upset, and in the sprit of eve we must respond in kind.
---
That's what I said when I counted. I used to keep it at the 50 max, but have that guy just about "done". Not looking forward to skilling another.
---
&gt; Is it possible for new members to become high level players in relatively short periods of time
---
not without paying quite a lot.
---
Wormholes aren't power creep, it's an alternative playstyle. It is in no way superior to harassing a choke unless alliances are allowed to safely build up 50j deep into nullsec.
---
Nobody moved into C2/NS wormholes because they were `stronger`, they moved into C2/NS wormholes because the alternative was patched away.
---
So aside from the non-pvp ships being fantatic bait ships, and some sporting borderline broken base stats (similar to HAC cap time), what I said is still true ya?
---
The deal WC has with the mangos is not to hunt them in Omist, but anywhere else is free game. They still show up to timers and sometimes come into detorid.
---
You know that drifters haven't spawned anywhere in 2 days, right?
---
Anyone time someone uses 'burst jammer' in their argument, it fails all credibility on the spot.  
---
Also when was the last time un-bonused light drones did anything to anyone?
---
You'd need to undock for more than pve for that
---
What you are saying is not gonna happen due to other areas in space i do agree tho why not a module for certain ships that emit a sort of pulse that would destort cloaked ships
---
Ahh so in reality these don't actually help the person because they won't necessarily know how to use them.
---
Well as long as it works that way and they still don't have a super advantage then I guess it's something you could live with right?
---
Or conversely to be brutally honest is this the reason people have left Eve? I for instance am not that keen on WOW and I was a hardcore WOW fan and many of the people left it and didn't return because they "dumed it down" and allowed people to pay their way to goals. 
---
I worked hard to earn a horse and it took me weeks and weeks,yes that's right I mined, I fished and hunted and fought to earn a horse and man when I had my ride I was so proud!" Really proud. I was fishing at 2 am in the morning to earn that fricken horse......then they just allowed some newby 12 year old kid to buy a horse for like 10 bucks or whatever?
---
How does that make me feel? If I'm going to be so disrespected then I'm going to find another place to put my money. Now I shared that because I know that people on here will know what it's like to metaphorically "fish online" at 2 am in the morning because you all do it in Eve....
---
If I feel angry then I know for sure other players must have felt angry about that. So it doesn't take rocket science to put two and two together...
---
The only other question is did this "paying to win goals" start at the time of player number decline? If the answer is yes then I'd say it has at the very least something to do with it.
---
The perfect place for null anomaly is that they should be relatively easy to do in the right ship that’s actively piloted but impossible to do profitably in a bot. 
---
Not exactly an easy line to find but it’s possible.
---
I am going to play the game as a subscriber but I wanted to ask a few hard questions that were nagging at me before I jumped in.
---
On balance it seems OK and the pay for advancement is not something I like but it's something I could live with but I now think this is a reason why people have left.
---
At one point Goonswarm were the most powerful faction. Are they still one of the most powerful?

So what happened was I had a null hole in the area and since I lived in Oasa and Omist before the bots came I decided to do a little trip through to see how they massacred by boy. Found these guys on an ice site and snuck in...
---
Only to find that they were sitting there. Doing nothing. Not mining, not moving, nothing. Knowing that alliance, it was probably because the bot they used to run it all crashed. 
---
So I start popping mackinaws left and right, pulse in my ears thinking this could go south at any second, but it doesn't. Pop the pods, and then send a rageping that I have a rorqual tackled. 
---
Problem is, that hole collapsed behind me, and the nearest route was 30 jumps. That, and we had like, two guys online. 
---
So I keep shooting at it, firing the mjolnirs in my hold first to deal with the shield, and let me tell you that tool a while. About 15 minutes in I'm thinking, "ok, they won't make it here even if they did come, but I might not have the ammo to do this." 
---
Fortunately, a corpie was willing to burn his ass over with a hold full of boompipes for me, and the hope he could get in on it too.
---
After about thirty minutes or so, I have him down to 20% hull, when suddenly, it happens. 
---
Someone takes the wheel. 
---
Instantly, hardeners go on. Drones go out. Neuts land on me. I'm pointed, facing a rorqual, in the middle of krab space and with no backup anywhere near close. 
---
Feeling ready to set something on fire, I start to beat a retreat. My tank is pretty solid, my speed ain't bad, and my cap is pretty resilient, but I just can't break his tank, and his shields are already nearing full once more. I eventually burn out of range and warp to the next system, hoping against hope that maybe, just *maybe*, this dumbass might stay where he is, and I might just be able to come back and shoot him again. Or, at least, get some more mackinaws. 
---
Five minutes later, I poke my head in. Immediately, I see it again. A rorqual on dscan. Wormholer btw, I totally forget about local for a moment, but when I check, it's a rush of relief. I know it's not guaranteed, though. He could have logged off tethered, or in a force field. I need to know.
---
In seconds, I've got him narrowed down, exact distance and within five degrees. Way above the plane of the system. This guy actually did it. 
---
The dumbass logged off in space with a combat timer. Despite all the structures nearby, he just logged off and left. 
---
Probes go out, and this time I'm on this guy like a fly on shit. Overheat everything, pray to our mad Bob, and thank my foresight for maxing overheating related skills. It takes another few minutes, but this time, he's mine. 
---
The rorqual explodes, and my corporate jumps into system. I check my ammo count. 
---
Three volleys left. 
---
As a thank you for the resupply, I hold the pod, and though the loot fairy said no, I went home that night grinning like a goddamn jackass. 
---
For shepherds we shall be, for Thee, Mad Bob, for Thee.
---
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our fleets may swiftly carry out Thy command.
---
And we shall roll a chain forth to Thee, and teeming with wrecks shall it ever be.
---
E nomini Apollo, et Artemis, Spiritus Cloaky.
---
Amen.
---
Making industry profitable is much more reliant on being able to to mine and produce in a Wormhole or Nullsec (with rigged Sotiyos) than it is on skill points invested. Join a null corp or a WH corp that has industrial players who can teach you.
---
Bring on the wrecking machine, brother.
---
I used to play WoW as well for a long while but I'm not sure why the numbers have gone down in that game but they've probably gone up and down. I just know that overall I've never bothered to go back because everybody has said it's been dumbed down too much.
---
Huffing gas and looting wrecks.
---
What?? Really? 
---
Is this why people are leaving Eve?
---
Yep i am a Wormholer just look at my stats [https://i.imgur.com/64r2crn.png](https://i.imgur.com/64r2crn.png)

Don't. Anyone claiming to double your ISK is a scamming cretin.
---
\&gt; doesn't like RP
---
\&gt; doesn't ignore RP
---
Got it
---
&gt;alternate play style 
---
LMAO
---
So are titans, and rorquals, and nullified t3s and nullified ceptors, and burner missions, and cynos, and all that shit you fuckheads whine about.
---
praise bob
---
ITT: People are still confused whether PIE and LUMEN are NPCs or real people. Even after people from both alliances respond, no one is convinced.
---
I can't speak to spectre policy, but that would probably be a good policy if it isn't.
---
So if the wolves run out of rabbits to eat, its the rabbits fault?
---
Spectre is a group of FCs though, you can pick the ones you find fun and like and stick to their fleets.  Can't really group all the FCs together.
---
A war criminal.
---
For pretty much everything in life, if you are blaming people for acting like people, you are blaming the wrong thing. The incentives of the game create player behavior.
---
good luck for new player to get to low sec, i still dont know how to not get instantly destroyed after decloaking after gate jump
