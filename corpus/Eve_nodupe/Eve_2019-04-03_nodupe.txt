so was there a region faster burnt down than Spire ?
---
---
---
I'll be the first to admit that it wouldn't be applicaple for every situation. But please do explain why it wouldn't be applicable for creating small raiding parties of AI?
---
###Unpopular opinion
---

---
&amp;nbsp;
---
What the fuck are you on about?
---
CCP didn't give us "farms and fields".  They literally gave the community an environment consisting of thousands of systems, each presenting numerous moons to be claimed and fought over. They gave us a hierarchical building scheme where virtually everything of use is built by players. They gave us a complex tech tree with a variety of different ships with unique bonuses, the majority of which are combat focused.
---
And what did we do with this unparalleled capacity for freedom in our super cool sandbox game?  We fucked it up.  We took that freedom and constructed pretty much the most boring political and geographic landscape conceivable.  The vast majority of active "pvpers" in the game have coalesced into just a handfull of entities lead by individuals who's personality traits could practically be lifted directly from the DSM-5. Winning by way of outnumbering your opponent has gone an indication of a hilarious lack of skill to something that is bragged about and cherished by the majority of the game.  Any criticism of this playstyle is met with the nauseatingly predictable low effort retort of:
---
&gt;its a sandbox I can play eve however I want 
---
Despite the fact that any engagement that involves double digit percentage participation of eve's major entities will buckle the integrity of the system's node faster than potato eleet can pick up a batfone.  No, it's not an opinion.  The game literally cannot be played how most of you apparently want it played. Why the fuck would you expect it to?  It's not CCP's fault that half of the players online want to try to derp around on the same grid.  This simply isn't realistic by any standard. 
---
Don't get me wrong, CCP hasn't helped things as much as they could have.  The fact that CCP does balance passes with the frequency that Donald Trump utters complete sentences definitely doesn't do must in the way of fostering an engaging pvp experience.  Real talk though, if you're really wanting to sling some fire at those truly responsible for the state of this game, your quarrel lies with the risk aversion and short nearsightedness within this community, not with the developer. 
---
Good that you’re learning you have much to learn still. Next time you’ll fight that guy you won’t win either (provided he’s not an idiot) even if you have more cap boosters. You know why? Because if he can’t break you he will just leave because you sacrificed one mid slot for a cap booster and have no web to keep him around. Or he could just tackle you while staying at the edge of scram where your unbonused blasters do nothing and call a friend or bring his alt to burn you down fast.
---
&gt; take the spire weeks ago 
---
We started 12 days ago. There are 6 b0t ihubs left in the region that have not been destroyed.
---
If you think I'm not acknowledging that then you're not even reading what I've been writing. We are having a discussion, and the only one to ignore anything, so far, has been you.

"If I see another god damn frigate broadcast I'm dropping Warriors and letting them rep you"

It's not impossible, it's just not going to happen, no matter how much you try and flex lol
---
 
---
Work with a small team, in an extremely difficult industry, on a legacy codebase of 15+ years and you'll understand why writing factories isn't going to solve anything, lol. And maybe deliver some code and scale it before spouting on Reddit
---
Could I get some proper ships without them? Or is the only thing I can do now go around the galaxy and see the views?
---
Thanks for your response!
---
I wanted to do basically everything except the Gila, but it may be worth a shot. I wonder if it will still be viable after the nerf.
---
The Zealot does fine in Electricals, even under cap pressure. I ran AB, the full high rack, and dual reps without sweating. Mine was purely T2 fit, so that may also be the issue.  My Cerb also had MGC with application script instead of a web, so that may be why I failed on that one
---
Sabre has two caracals fitted, I'm dying hahaha
---
&gt; Why not smaller stuff that can more easily be destroyed (as well as replaced) just to get smaller gangs out there doing stuff and driving content?
---
Because small gangs don't drive content. CCP handed one thing after another to small gangs -- siphons, ESS, entosis, nullified inties, etc -- and small gangs had a couple weeks of enthusiasm and then gave up. I think CCP has said fuck this and isn't listening anymore.
---
Most small gang people don't want to make content, they want content handed to them. And when big entities respond, they scream about it and go home. That's what happened with all of those tools, people said "at last the big guys will be *forced* to fight us" and then found out that big groups aren't stupid.
---
You're sitting on more swords and torches than you can shake a stick at, but using them is effort.
---
&gt; Says the sales team to the engineering team... Lol
---
you're right. I should just make comments like this?
---
Man, I don't even know what to think tbh. This isn't you. Either that or I'm just the worst judge of character on the planet. 
---
Long con my ass. Unless you are as sociopathic as Patrick Bateman combined with the acting chops of a 25 year Hollywood veteran, there's no way in hell this was a long con.
---
I wish I knew what you were really thinking.  Political differences with certain people aside (which you knew I agreed with) I still can't fathom why you would have done something like this. I'm personally not aware of any rl stalking shit but it is true you kept your location on all your social media.... (still waiting for a response to my disappoint face on snapchat) 
---
I still feel responsible as I was part of the push to get you directorship, and of course you still had it after so long because you were our fuckin brother.
---
What a waste...  If you're looking for validation or attention you won't find it here.
---
wtf you forgot about us
---
you should be using an instadock bookmark anyway
---
mcav were always decent kiteyboi fights, I enjoyed them back in my drunkendis order-ly days. I'm sure they'd be happy to help an up-and-coming pvper, most pilots are if you've a mind to learn.
---
I too don't fuel/fit my structures, during a war, then complain when they get blown up.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I mean its almost like Goons have been running around for the last month, finding the any un-fueled ones, and scanning structures to see the fits... what could they possibly be doing?
---
Wanna know why it has upvotes? Because anybody that actually works in the industry will understand the joke
---
Step 1 :  Locate the rattle ,  get the player name and look him up on zkill.  This will help you figure out if this pilot is solo or with a bigger group. Also if hes loss a ratting rattle before it will give you his fit.
---
Step 2  Fit up a ship good enough to kill him. Or neut him then kill him. 
---
Notes :  step 1 is extremely important unless you can bring a insta blob to wreck the rattle under 5 min . Because if not , and if its his corp tz.  That tanky rattle will be  the accidental bait you wont kill and will bute back . 
---
so it is not worth protecting renter structures is what it seems like you are saying. 
---
This is true.  We'll strap you into a Maulus and hurl you at the armor blob until you think Chessur's sunglasses are cool.
---
id be extremely happy if just one of whese things would get implemented.
---
just give us a reason to shoot/invade each other instead of farming and fighting over meaningless sov/bash aids-citadels for hours.
---
i slowly but surely loose interest in this game. which is kinda sad... it could be so awesome...
---
Absolutely gorgeous
---
Corny but dead accurate. Friendship is the best ship. In hindsight it's hard to believe some players join up expecting to have a good time playing alone. We make jokes about how outdated the PvE is. M**M**ORPG stands for multiplayer. And the other players are not just for ambience, you're intended to do stuff together lol.
---
pospy-flair explains alot...
---
Seraph you are the kind of mother fuck who will whine that ccp gave us fire and swords and then goons burned out everyone who didn't kiss the ring with zero self awareness about how you asked for it, just like how people don't like to admit that the fucking letter most of nullsec signed inspired this shit.
---
I'm just going to leave this here if were gonna talk about structures getting blown up. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75916392/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75916392/) 
---
If your not gonna fuel them, at the bare minimum, fuck no.
---
I agree with 50% of an Olmeca post, WTF. 
---
(Bosons should just be removed entirely. AOE doomsdays were shit in 2007 and they're shit now. Fighters should need a web and scram squadrons to fight small ships. And the asset safety collector is an interesting idea though nightmarish to implement.)
---
Your #4 though, that will not work out the way you think it will. Low-density nullsec existed in the past and it wasn't a small gang paradise. It was the drone regions everywhere.
---
Preach it!
---
Help to happy.
---
You should be learning as much as you can with the skill you got 
---
Make POS's great again!
---
[removed]
---
A TLDR to compensate for the wall?
---
Uh, faction forts are like mini-keepstars in EHP.
---
so they have time to farm shiny killmails but not to protect their renter infrastructure, good to know.
---
You brought nearly twice as many people to kill that Fortizar than their alliance has members.
---
Its true, anything that can be done to goons by small groups can be done 100x more effectively by goons to other groups.
---
ok which structures are yours so we can test this theory?
---
*grumbles in documentation*
---
"No moongoo huff gas loot sleepers fly Astero and Nestor build Tech3 ships hit DScan M U R D E R B R A W L"
---
Whats the value in protecting morons? why waste the effort?
---
You cant be bothered to give us 2 fucking timers, we give you a walk on the one get. I think thats fair?
---
Great music choices 
---
Combat ready is all you need to start making an impact in fleets. 
---
Other online games have longer grinds to be "competitive" for most paths in eve. In eve you can pick up a frig with basic skills and make an impact in fleets (tackle). If you're looking to do everything or be the best 1v1 player it's going to take a long time.  Even in wow a fresh character cannot kill a mid level character, and a fresh level 60 (or whatever it is now) shouldn't be able to kill a fully BIS raid character. 
---
Yep what the majority of the people that whine about this really want is risk free dank ratting and rorq frags.
---
Awesome information, and couldn't come at a better time. Thank you.
---
It’s dead coalition.. I worked hard on the fucking logo ... 
---
Calling us GOTG is like calling Paul “the Beatles” because he still sings ... let go of the past move with the herd 
---
😬🤗
---
BY all means, they are all fueled.
---
If you do find a low power one, let me know.
---
Didn't want those renters anyway.
---
oh sweet summer child, like fueling will save them. 
---
You'll want missile skills and run HAMs for the pve. Also med lasers and drone skills. 3 weapons systems for the pve fit i use lol!
---
I'm not going to go that far, becuase I know for a fact that we missed a lot of krabs becuase we put like 5 campers in some systems and totally ignored others (I'm in init, /u/jibrish decided to mod abuse my flair)
---
Goons bitching about too many members coming to fight, thats a first.
---
Quick assemble another 60 man fleet to roam renter space, I swear it will be a fair fight.
---
Depends if they learned anything. 
---
I mean, they replace the structures with more 1/3 fit, unfueled ones. Yeah they are probably better left to their own devices and a wet paper bag.
---
I mean if anything its content, im enjoying this war so far.
---
Been building shit for a few years, time to let it all burn. 'tis the cycle of EVE.
---
Shud be no skills eveyone can fly everything. 
---
Yea, running the logistics of an alliance uses its original meaning, generally moving this from that or organizing this or that etc etc, but its how the word is used;
---
I do logistics for snuff != I fly logistics for snuff
---
Also, pretty much all the time, if its reps being talked about, it will be called logi, not the full "logistics"
---
thank you!
---
This is the angriest message I've ever agreed with.
---
Thank you.
---
What the fuck is this imposter Postcard from Poitot? The only postcards in Eve come from the only named system in Syndicate.
---
Are you auto replying this with a Reddit bot?

Aww did i hurt your feelings, tell me where i touched you, so i can call CPS.
---
You don't have to train all of the subcap skills evenly. Figure out the current meta and train those ships and skills then you are ready to be elite. My main has over 115 mil sp and still hasn't trained gal dessy to 5 because it still hasn't really been in the meta much since I started playing, over 2 years ago.
---
Training straight up one race only is kinda retarded, as it means you can't do pirate ships at all, which is why you are unhappy in your pvp probably, as they are op and kick your butt. Also, while Amarr is beautiful ships, they are locked into Em/Therm damage which limits you as well. If you are going to train just up a single race, you should have chosen Minmatar. In rust we trust. Capless guns with selectable damage, wooooo.
---
TLDR: Train into specific ships that are op in the current meta= shorter time to be highly effective. 
---
That's a lot of words for an n+1 and tidi whine...
---
You're literally wailing against human nature there. 
---
It wasn't *coincidence* that saw almost everyone in the game start playing a certain way. It wasn't leadership either; I wasn't dragged kicking and screaming into my current playstyle. As a matter of fact, no one was. 
---
What happened was the same exact thing that has happened since the very first day the game was released: evolution. 
---
People realize they can do more things with friends -&gt; they form corps 
---
People realize they can do even more things with even more friends -&gt; they form alliances 
---
People realize they can survive in Eve and not have a cancerous time eating shit 24/7 if they have still more friends -&gt; they form coalitions 
---
People realize they like killing people -&gt; they make friends with like-minded people -&gt; groups form made of dedicated killers whose raison d'etre is killing other players 
---
These groups hunt weaker groups relentlessly -&gt; the weaker groups join alliances or coalitions, or just leave the game 
---
Killers succeed constantly and gain prestige and notoriety -&gt; the groups of killers get bigger and bigger as they attract more like-minded people -&gt; these groups start farming bigger and bigger prey groups to coalitions or death 
---
Dank skin. 
---
Never :-) goons, tnt, jag, hawks, pyre etc have all been a godsend and made this whole thing possible.
---
The OP is a former unspoken member, and likely doesn’t know the extent of the landscape.
---
Picture is pretty dope though.

And not really as lots of those skills are required fitting skills for all ships

Novice FW complexes are your friend. And smalls. And complexes in general. And being able to swallow the loss, learn from your mistakes, and try harder next time.
---
Yes, you'll always be at a disadvantage against that 300m sp officer fit machariel dude that has 20 trillion isk on his killboard, sure. But that doesn't mean you can't try your hand at killing that vexor navy issue that happens to be in system.
---
Can I get an Amen?!
---
&gt;trillions
---
Not even an exaggeration either. The index in 1dq1 is like 20% right? That's insane lol
---
You're missing the point.  The "problem" with the big ratters/miners (i.e., Imperium, and those emulating that model) aren't sov constrained.  They aren't holding a lot of sov given their numbers.
---
You want to know my secret?
---
They’re all Brisc posts. 
---
Wow. Just.... WOW!
---
Whats going on in the Spire, I see bot sov going from fine to ALL contested in one day and a bunch of Etherium reach alliances have said 'INVASION!!!"  I know most of em are Wormhole alliances and such and I just wanted to know what's up without a PILE of propaganda and shit.  I haven't played in 3+ years and I still watch Dotlan and such almost daily as my own little 'guilty pleasure' I know just the basics, BOT is the NC. and I think PL joint rental alliance that rents out space in drone lands.  I watched those wormhole alliances kick the crap outta some I think Russian corps that had made a new alliance, then died as I believe I keep hearing rumblings that the Russians have finally put aside the tons of differences and might be ready to invade their traditional lands again.  
---
Any news, background info or whatever would be great.    
---
And please remember, I don't have a horse in this race, I'm just happy to see more and more fights, alliances and people getting involved.  Thank you!
---
I'm just pointing out that you made this post 4 times in a row and it hasn't gotten better 
---
He's right, its supposed to be a small upwell structure with limited capabilities but able to dock in and refit, so better than a mobile depot for small expeditions, etc and meant to finally replace the POS. But in the meantime , the pos can still be used for this smaller fleet actions.
---
I just want small citadels with no reinforce timer and no asset safety. 
---
yea can you like, stop? [http://puu.sh/D9gFZ/5c81604dec.png](http://puu.sh/D9gFZ/5c81604dec.png)
---
You dont need to be an elite pvper to join wormhole space. Its helps of course but all you need is a willingness to improve, a thirst for combat and a good attitude. That's what I look for as a recruiter for Pos Party. Number 2 wormhole corp in wormhole space
---
How serious do you need?
---
Sorry i thought it wasnt posting
---
Yeah... I'm not going to lie, when I was first heard people saying "logi" ships, I assumed they meant transport/Indy ships.
---
fair enough then :)
---
Yeah, as confusing as it is initially... I am very glad we don't call them "healer ships". haha
---
Some of us like to express ourselves in complete sentences and don't view it as a vice.   Regarding whining, this is nothing compared to the  interminable river of tears that comes flowing through this subreddit regarding a lack of content in the game attributed to CCP. 
---
Well, at least some of these forts are going to die. 
---
But without the ability to dock supers or doomsday
---
:whoosh:
---
:)
---
Dude, you are on fire tonight!

ok call me when your super fleet is inside one

Railing at the futility of the human condition is so satisfying though. It doesn't need to be constructive.
---
&gt;Look at my upvotes 
---
LOL
---
You might as well go back to high sec.
---
Well shit, did I just get a promotion to management? 
---
Does it include a raise?
---
Perception is truth. Propaganda is perception. Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past. Ergo propaganda is truth. 
---
idk we burned a fuckload of structures in the north and it was pretty fun
---
Haven’t played for awhile, but am returninng to EVE. I ran some NPC bounties, and it said I’ll be paid in the next bounty payout. I’m more used to Elite right now where you cash out, but couldn’t find that option, so I looked it up. I found that bounties are paid in 20 minute “ticks.” Is this true? However, I was charged upfront for repairing my ship and was immediately given ISK for Project Discovery. Would ticks pay me when I’m offline? Thanks! :)
---
A goon linemember personally dropped the highway of citadels out of the north? Man, that's crazy.
---
fucking you sweetie
---
I think it's still the responsibility of CCP to create/develop the proper environment of the game. I can't "blame" players for spamming citadels. You can't balance a game on the expectation of good will from players. It has to come from the developers.
---
Fine then. I shall mend my ways.
---
The fuck... i've never had anyone agree with me in a reddit comment.. i mean.. this is very confronting that you're a nice person and agreeable...
---
I think i broke reddit :D
---
This is what happens when you do too many drugs and let syphilis go untreated. 
---
Agreed, you would have expected more of a behind-the-lines role of logistics, not a frontline combat support.
---
You could gift one to each voter when you run for CSM again.
---
"Stop. Broadcasting. For. Bomb. Damage."
---
Wormholes is just something else, you need to experience it.
---
*cough* FW *cough*
---
And people didn't want "Moon Sov" back in the game...
---
Mechanics don't work in logistics, even if they bring the part to your car before they repair it. Bringing what you need for your job isn't shipping things.
---
&gt; You cant realistically avoid cynos anywhere.
---
Yes you can. Any gated deadspace site is cynojammed and covert cynojammed. For example FW plexes. Can't use cynos in highsec or wormholes either. And if constellation has an incursion then all those systems are cynojammed. 
---
&gt; In the absense of that, a cyno block in FW space is better than nothing. 
---
FW space is only place where you can realistically avoid cynos because you have plexes in every system easily available to any ship. No need for cynoblocking there.
---
&gt; Instant travel is overpowered and must go.
---
It was already nerfed several times. It used to be a lot stronger without much restrictions. If subcap vs capital balance is tweaked it will be ok again.
---
O I see, well, either way, if they investigate then that will be the conclusion they come to, and having some sort of mental issues or not, it is better to err on the side of caution, cause if it does turn out to be real from someone and CCP takes no action, no investigation, nothing, then they may end up being in deep shit from publicity of it alone if not far worse.
---
Sure it may take up some time of some CCP employees which may be spent elsewhere, but with stuff like this, the risk of doing nothing is just too great.
---
Gee Billy, how come your mom lets you have three keepstars?
---
Exceptional minimalist song, do you have name of song? 
---
Pulse Emitter Array doesnt sound as cool tho
---
What. Number two in what criteria, bodies in a fleet? 
---
Yep. You don't need to be a director to drop asshouses, you know. My in-space gimmick is being sneaky and doing stuff on my own, then surprising everyone with the cool shit I got up to.
---
Moral of the story, stop being a fuck boy sally and just play the game...
---
When trying to join a nullsec Corp/alliance the whole recruitment thing is like a real life interview, that takes days to complete. Asking background information, I don’t have enough kills, and pulling up random characters with similar names as me thinking I’m a spy? And being rejected for that reason. Is this normal when trying to join a larger group in nullsec? 
---
yes. and please use supers/titans  to shoot them with, i need a reason to log in
---
And to add on to this before someone argues "but you can dump time into - INSERT MMORPG HERE - to powerlevel, in Eve you just have to wait!".
---
While the above used to be true, with skill injectors you can dump time into earning ISK so you can purchase skill injectors and use that to "powerlevel" - without needing to powerlevel.
---
You could get a fresh character, spend \~2 months training it (I know, groan!), and then earn 1 skill injector roughly every 2-3 hours in WH space (there are various other ways as well, I just can't speak for them all).
---
Why CCP nerfed Miasmos Amastris Edition?
---
you cant even defend your own, who the fuck would be afraid of your threats, lmao
---
I run a cap stable, active tank Golem and I hoover up all loot and salvage. A bit blingy and skill-intensive, perhaps, but every L4 mission is dead easy.
---
ITT, moron mouth breathing NC member doesn't realize that rental income is used to fund alliance wide things.
---
2 years? I was getting smart bombed by supercarriers within 2 weeks of playing. And as far as i know that's already the pinnacle of Frigate v Super combat.
---
Damn, so I'm part of management, and a member of NC now. Damn, my Eve career is going great today.
---
Man i got promoted to management, AND NC, this is a great day for my eve career everyone.

I don't _expect_ good will from players. I'm not suggesting that we all gather around a campfire, talk about Jesus and sing kumbaya.  What I am saying, is that a large portion of this community is complaining to CCP because they perceive a deficit of *meaningful and engaging gameplay*, meanwhile, these same players have taken actions that all but ensure that the kind of gameplay they desire is scarce (i.e. pvp starved GONs bosoning everyone who roams their space looking for fights and then crying because no content). 
---
What I do not expect but what I would _like_ is for frustrated leaders of this community to make some modicum of effort to help themselves by striking out on their own rather than snuggling up to huge megablobs.  Sure, the cost is relative safety and using supers with impunity and loss of infrastructure.  Yeah that's a lot to lose for sure.  However, if on the other side of the equation is a set of circumstances that makes the game so tedious and boring that you cry to CCP every week on reddit about how they're ruining the game for you and your blob that consists of 60% of the games actives, idk how to help you.
---
Yeah CCP can make changes that lead the community to water but [this is how that seems to be going so far.](https://i.imgur.com/X17puIB.gif)
---
Or CCP could come up with some engaging and interesting gameplay to take them down. 
---
But this is CCP we are talking about so in regards to structures this will not happen. 
---
Are the names just the system where the structure used to live? A decent gimmick, but it's no "The Lmao"
---
I mean we are paying ccp to entertain us.
---
It isn't up to the community to run the game.
---
Hurt feelings? All it says is i accepted your challenge that fit and fueled structures wouldn't die. I guess we will see what happens wont we? :)
---
I like the detail of putting that loki in the background.

I've been camped by them multiple times. They like to remote sebo frigs and give them Logi support so it looks like a solo kill

I think you're right in that [lots of people](https://tenor.com/view/lots-of-cunts-got-hound-gif-5607499) in the community favor winning above all else and will do absolutely whatever is necessary to do that. 
---
For the rest of us that aren't smoothe brained, tryhard, skillless, witless, risk averse, fun averse, challenge averse cucklords, I'd suggest a different metric of how to have fun it eve online. It may surprise you to learn that most of us don't consider "piloting" our ship in 10% TIDI (failure of dynamic interaction with UI for minutes at a time) to be fun and engaging, I'd suggest that there exists an alternative paradigm for how to have fun in eve online.   So no, when you say that "There is an optimal way to play the game no matter what you do", I must concede that I compelled to implore you to *go fuck yourself*. There may be an optimal way to play the game but I promise you, spending 4 hours in a 'fleet fight" where you manage to successfully activate 3 modules isn't it. 
---
By your standard the _optimal_ way to play the game is to be in the largest group, a move that will ensure that any actually serious engagement involving your organization *will* result in a node failure. Thus, by your standard the *best* way to play the game is to behave in such a way that you can't really play the game at all. I admit that I don't think the ultimate conclusion here is too far off, but the manner in which you get there seems a bit off. 
---
&gt;"No specific modules, but (as per usual) do not fire unless ordered to by your FC!"
---
  Have they not flown with null players?
---
The name stuck since the tech 1 versions used to BE the hauling ships in game, no industrials.
---
Is tgere a character limit for replys this gunna take awhile
---
Sweetie fuck me
---
OK!
---
By that same token, DPS ships transport damage and ammunition to enemy ships.
---
that is also an unfueled sotiyo for months before it was attacked, the owners didn't even say it was under attack.
---
Aura: Your ship has been destroyed.
---
I mean, maintenance usually doesn't happen while the thing is still being shot at.
---
A lot of the big corps have hardcore krabs in them. You just really don't need to krab endlessly to pay for your ships in WHs. One site = one leshak. Most of them only require a willingness to PvP and try to learn, no need to already be an expert. A lot of the null dudes that join have fun, but it really depends on your personality. The corps are much smaller, so how you mesh with your group's sense of humor matters a lot. 
---
And all my titan components. :(
---
CO2 went from "everything is fine" to everything but like 2 TCU/IHUB burned in one cycle (36-48h). There was probably like 400-600 people sovwanding with impunity. I put a sovwand on my sabre even.
---
This is burning pretty fuckin' fast though
---
Not everyone has Customer Service V though.
---
Yes and no. Some groups are less selective. Large alliances often have a particular corp catering to noobs that pretty much take anyone, then have smaller corps or special interest groups that you can apply to, but more than likely would be invited. 
---
Didn't want that 40bil item anyway.
---
you can lose every thing! 
---
and a lot more complication being added to a system that is already a pain in the ass to use.
---
It's a sandbox. that's literally the entire point of the game.
---
honestly just call them DARKNESSdoxx tbh
---
Sounds like you set your flair prematurely.  
---
I remember being asked by the recruiter to put my associations and past actions into context. He asked lots of followup questions, probably to ensure my story remained consistent. And personal questions about my goals, aspirations, and expectations. And they took full APIs for all my characters and insisted I keep them valid in perpetuity. 
---
Techniques will vary but most corps put a good deal of effort into curating their applications to make spying harder and to ensure a good cultural fit. They'll remind you not to take rejection personally if they determine you'll be *happier elsewhere*. 
---
Answer me these questions three...  
---
What... is the mascot of The Goonswarm?  
---
What... region do they live in?  
---
What... is the hyperspatial de-acceleration of a fully laden max skill max clone triple hyperspatial rigged, absolutely untanked nyx warping straight into a bubble trap live on stream?
---
Im confused. Is this by fail coalition to panda or by panda to fail coalition?

If you like fleet fights, don't join them.
---
It's true. Scientificly proven. If you are a high Sec miner you are more likely to be over weight, have diabetes, neck-beard, have no significant other, no kids, and be depressed. Not to mention the inability to separate a video game from real life which leads to anger issues and high blood pressure.

So the spire is a somewhat mountainous and desolate part of Africa?
---
Oh no I left goonswarm about 2 months ago, and most nullsec have denied my entry, and I just get labeled a spy. That part of the game never interested me, and more interested in finding a good group to do some pvp with. And I was in horde for a year before I went to goons
---
Here are the two videos The Scope put out related to this:
---
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Mj8g4k2Gs
---
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJC5jQSXn6U
---
Yes this has been a thing for a while now. Triglavs are building a capital ship. 
---
Yeah, this ridiculous Leshak spawn is guarding a constructing Triglavian capital ship
---
My thought exactly. 
---
They also have positive attitudes, and are super cool!
---
A few weeks, or longer than that?  
---
EXACTLY this fucking thing. The FIRST RULE of communications when nobody can see anyone: 1st person DOES NOT EXIST. You are not 'I'. You are not 'me'. You are your goddamn character name of the pilot flying the goddamn ship. You will speak in the third person. You will Hulk speak if necessary. If it makes you feel better about yourself, you can hallucinate that your pecs are even 0.1% as good as his, whatever it takes to say the name of the pilot and HIT THE BROADCAST BUTTON.
---
And in EVE this rule goes double because you're fucking multiboxing four dudes and you say "i'm getting hit" Yes which one of your many multiple personalities is actually getting hit HMM? oh I guess he's dead Oh well that'll free up 0.25 of your brain cell so that across your remaining 3 guys you might have enough mental fortitude to figure this out before the next gets shot
---
That doesnt spell "GOONS"
---
Well said. I'll add one thing, which is that you can set "jump clones" in w-space, but you can only jump to them if you're already in that citadel. If you get podded, you're making the trek back from k-space.
---
it's a 50/50 chance that you die in his fleet, and a 50/50 chance you die to his fleet. pretty bad chances if he's around but when he nails it, he really does nail it.
---
You're drastically overstating the number of tidi fights (let alone node-breaking levels of tidi) members of a large alliance usually experience, but that's something of a digression. 
---
The manner in which I arrived at my conclusion is as follows: losing is *designed* to suck in Eve. Like, that's one of the most fundamental tenets of Eve, that losing sucks. We can whinge about the affordability of titans these days, but realistically even in the best case you're usually out 10-15 minutes of in-game fun while you boat a pod to a new ship, or a new ship to the fun. 
---
So, losing sucks, but there are people in the game who play the game solely to kill things. Content, right? I mean, you'd stop playing if there stopped being content, right? So, losing sucks, but in order to have fun, *someone* has to lose. Of course, if you lose too much, you're liable to go broke and quit, or skip the "go broke" part and just quit. 
---
People have banded together into ever larger groups to protect krabs and what not, but alongside that, pvp in Eve has gotten fucking retarded. Unstoppable supercap armadas only a few 5+-year-old alliances can afford, mass cloaky camping covering an entire region (and the resulting synergy with blops bridges), spies that let your enemies know about every single trap you set, etc.
---
You're whinging about people banding together to survive an *unbelievably* hostile universe, that all of us have created. Every last one of us bar Signal Cartel has made this happen. Hell, you're whinging against *natural selection*. You know what happens to a small group when a powerful alliance moves in nearby? Ask the people who lived near Snuff in lowsec. Ask anyone who met NC/PL before last year. And you know what happens to a content-driven group when the prey gets stronger than they are? The same damn thing. 
---
I mean... eh....
---
I'd rather other wh corps. Namely ones that don't live in a c4 - fuck rolling c4's 
---
Yep! Ticks from bounties pay when you are offline. :)
---
This too.
---
Two weeks into EVE and it was the corp I joined. I can't say if it is the best... except that it is.
---
I mean sure. But I also want CCP to develop the game in such a way that it makes alliances go to war more. Everything is so bubble wrap safe now and full of F1 low IQ blobbing. We need resource scarcity and shit we can blow up easier. CCP needs to make this.
---
[Can confirm.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/awzsfo/why_eve_is_always_the_best_mmo_even_during_rough/)
---
You probably should have mentioned ex-goon in your initial blurb. Most of the alliances that aren't already in the Imperium harbor a spiteful grudge. Too bad you left the swarm only a month before you would have become eligible to join the secret squads and SIGs that do the sort of PvP you crave.
---
Crimeny that's alot of responses. I guess I just had the image of 'space trucker' stuck in my head instead of battlefield medic. 
---
Hope you dropped a "gf" in local, at least the 2nd time.
---
Lol. C4 living with a C5 connect doesnt suck. But Pospy are awesome folks
---
It’s awesome! Looks like it’s breaking through the clouds and entering clear skies. Definitely a good environment for this wonderful ship.
---
Funny narrative, but boat is a really good fc and very very frequently he is successful at what he sets out to do. Maybe some people die in the process, but you can be sure he will cause havoc and destruction in the ranks of the enemies.
---
Hey mom we're famous
---
Exept TDF is
---
Show me on the doll where boat dropped bombers on you.
---
No, we're paying CCP to be have access to more items within the sandbox.  We aren't paying them to make us enjoy the game, we're paying them to give us a chance to enjoy playing their game the way we want.  Whether it be PvP or PvE or mining or freighting or etc, it doesn't matter.  All giving them money does is give us more options inside the sandbox they created to figure out how to play the game in our own specific way.
---
It was....
---
They are currently looking into expanding their US timezone playerbase, so they are mainly EUTZ, but I have seen US HQ fleets around all the time basically.  
---
Average ISK/h is about 260mil ISK/h with LP, but most of the time they get 270-80milISK/h.  
---
Good site spawns and another inc community running the sites and contesting them that number just rises, because they will win 99% of the contests.  
---
That's why every WTM guy will tell you on here that TDF is not as good. They don't like it when someone steals their sites constantly :P
---
The actual value of the rigs puts it a bit higher than 40b, but :zkill:
---
For the Sotiyo, it had been full power for 3~ weeks prior to it being reinforced. When it did go low power it was usually fueled within 24 hours.
---
Those missions are \~10-15 year old content. My advice would be to leave highsec and figure out what is the current fun stuff to do. And finding a cool group that does that fun stuff together.
---
I don't go on boat fleets to die, I go on them to live life to the fullest, until I die.
---
Even as a vet its confusing terminology.. do the wh dudes mean logi as in healers or logi as in infrastructure work? :Thonk:
---
"combat repair ships" 
---
Eve has the best in game economy of any game ever made and maybe ever will. 
---
The game completely revolves around player made and found items. And the reason things are constantly in demand are because of the permanent loss that occurs when you lose a ship. 
---
The permanent loss thing is huge and what other games are seriously missing to have a great economy. 
---
An alpha player should have no problem making shittons of isk from exploration or getting good fights in frigates in faction warfare.  There are also megahuge alliances that accept alpha players for a taste of large fleet warfare.  All T1 and pirate subcapital ships are available to you, and a total of 22mil skillpoints, despite the cap being 5mil.  If you are committed to playing without paying, it might be an option for you to create a number of different alpha accounts, so you can maximize your skill point gain for different needs on different accounts.
---
&gt;rapid delivery ship
---
&gt; This is how you drive content. Not smaller cheaper destructible structures.
---
Indeed. Structures equals timers and that will always lead to pile-ons. The best small gang fun is not planned but happens ad-hoc. You get something or get cought and then it escalates.
---
I think the issue is not as much of a game development issue but a balance issue. What can small gangs hunt and kill right now? VNIs which are cheap and a bitch to catch. And capitals. Also hard to catch (though easier) because they can rat aligned.  But can they be killed? If you have a very free definition of small scale. Does that still work the moment the capital escalates? No. Because they can easily bring fewer and way stronger stuff than the attacker. More capitals esp Faxs. Same with miners aka Rorqs. As predicted when they announced the cap changes CCP has created a game where capitals are the best or at the very least a very good option without real drawbacks. So there is also never an incentive to drive a roaming gang out with subcaps.
---
Always have as many boosters as you can fit. And fighting comet in a incursus is really hard, comet is one of the strongest brawlers. Using a standard exile booster will make your reps 20% more stronger so you need to run them less often which saves cap. That might be the only option to kill a comet. Or just using comet yourself also :D
---
Simple solution... Open new 0.0 space... only NPC stations... No structures... No anchoring... hull restrictions on certain gates. 
---
Battleships and below... Cruisers and below... Frigs and below.
---
The deepest new space is frigs only yet has the most rewards. 
---
i agree chevis
---
it's not really a rape cage when you online them to use as stagers
---
when you do that it's more like one of those inflatable bouncy houses
---
"I'm being primaried!" "Who is being primaried?" asking for a name or broadcast, answer: "Me" ... its ok, we lost another one
---
&gt; Low-density nullsec existed in the past and it wasn't a small gang paradise. It was the drone regions everywhere.
---
I have to disagree with this one. The drone regions always had the "advantage" of being remote. But with more people using wormholes, different Wh spawn mechanics and people keeping capitals hidden in the region it became way more accessable.
---
While other regions were very different. I´ll use AAA HED-GP as an example. That system saw action all the time. Because AAA knew if they stopped those pesky 5-10 man gangs there their ratters were safe. But if you got through there you could run amok in the fields and always go home with a few kills (or die in a ball of fire because the defenders bridged in front of you an cut you off).
---
Why did noone really want to live in Delve for a long time? Because the whole region was accessable from NPC null or low and even in black-op jumprange. But if you counterjumped on those black ops you could have some nice and really bloody fun too.
---
how could anyone possibly be expected to understand that it's an exploit after every single other use of an aoe mechanic to circumvent an area of invulnerability has been deemed an exploit
---
obviously it should be permissible until CCP spells it out word for word, it's not like using a throwaway NPC alt in any way suggests awareness and premeditated intent
---
Appropriate. Especially the huge Legacy bomber that dropped that bomb...
---
Wizard hat 2012.
---
So with a minmatar bs, i might go with artillery and an mjd and then just kite and alpha everything. I doubt the npcs are gonna apply much damage when your at 100km range.
---
It had two meanings, wild. 
---
There has been a post about this every other day for like 2 weeks or so....
---
 I thought logistics drones would rep me when I began playing
---
I have drone skills already, and some training in Missiles wouldn’t be too long since I already use a Stealth Bomber :)
---
However, lasers on a Loki ? Maybe you’re talking about a PVE Legion ? Because I don’t see why somebody would want energy turrets on a Minmatar ship ._.

how's your whining on r/eve that you're not able to speed roll to ez noob farm?
---
that seems to be the current w-space meta
---
Nope. That was my first thought too. Later I thought it was interchangeable.
---
Reducing drone hp by 250% is a shame but should not impact the Gila to much. Just adds some drone management and probably add two minutes to the Battlecruiser sites. 
---
Since they are the only spawn that seems to apply any damage to my drones correctly.

Amen

Yeah, it does. 6 battleships to roll a static is miserable.

let small gangs to to shoot ihubs but not to destry but to turn off all anomalies for x time example 1hour, so no mining and ratting in this system if u dont want to fight

---
like 5% of total slaves on market comes from drops, without even considering the slot layout - like a lot of the drops is slot 1 &amp; 2 implants.              
---
People have no idea what will happen when armor implants go to delve.     
---
Price will skyrocket as soon as the stocks burns out - as 3 agents sitting in separate system ... well nyx will be cheaper than full set of implants for it. 
---
Also it's okay if the tickers are literally "BOT" and "RMT" because then you're being ironic and definitely not openly advertising your complicity
---
they just roll some alpha clones and it be good
---
So how many full sets did you got from drops.        
---
You know that you need to have full set - right?
---
You took none of mine, sir. :D
---
Is the speed enough to tank the damage with 10MN?
---
I feel like Repair or Engineering would be acceptable synonyms
---
If you re on eutz, give paranoia overload a call too, see if we fit.
---
we re a bunch of old people, we re all learning everyday, we re not afraid to throw stuff at people and we make inappropriate jokes.  
---
also if rl takes precedence everyone is really understanding 
---
wh space is awesome, even if a little slow sometimes, but the community at large and also individual corps are more tightly knit because of the general adversity of the medium. I for one love it and will probably never leave it.
---
All alliance should use bots,and make this game die soon.
---
If you refuse bot,yeah,you are noble, and you will die before the game.

Due  to me being deadly sick with the horrid man flu a friend posted this, my first real poster, in my stead, however i will read feedback to try and get better  at making eve propaganda in the future as it is a fun tradition in my view.
---
as someone who was in tishu at the time, with members actively watching those citadels (particularly the ones in placid), dreads midded and on standby, and hictors on a bridge titan for weeks
---
you're retarded and it's terminal sorry
---
when people say that goons have weaponized autism they're not joking
---
y'all have found a way to convince your line members that bashing structures unopposed for hours at a time is fun
---
Yea, it should shake things up a bit, just as well. I wasn't intending to deny your point about the availability of the implants, was more just wondering if u/Juwo53 was correct and they weren't going to be available as drops. Thanks bud.
---
Well they will be - but it will take time to build full sets from drops, while loyal Sansha supporters will get them 1min after DT. 
---
Let's hear more about how buffing supercapitals and titans will "help fight the blob" again.
---
That one is always good for a laugh.
---
aye, go make some money, my dude.
---
The closest to the event have to pay much less for travel.

oh dang permaband tour merch, neat 
---
Use to be in Scary Wormhole People ( WHBOO ).  
---
Amazing bunch of people. 
---
Very helpful when I first joined, from doctrines to seting up farm hole.   
---
All in all very positive experience.   
---
Sadly I left the corp due to combination of RL and large ammount of salt after geting fist bumped in farm hole.   
---
Simply took a break from EVE and all things connected.  
---
Wanted to come bakc some 6 months later. 
---
Use to be one of the recruiters, but forgoten just how paranoid brethren in WHBOO can be. Had to go through same process as any new recruit and could not explain my connection to a toon that was sold in 2009. Now, I have bought and sold over 30 toons, probably more in over a decade of EVE.  Dont remember most of their names. Buy a low toon, train for 6 months, sell for profit. Explanation and attitude during explaining was considered unwanted and WHBOO shut its doors to me permanently.   
---
Reason I am mentioning this is to be aware, if you do choose them as your EH corp, getting in can be a task. Be prepared for a line of questioning, should you stutter on any of answers or have a defencive attitude you will be declined.   
---
Still, if WH-s is what your heart desires this is an amazing group of people. 
---
i didnt even know it existed, its not like its broken or anything as i never saw one anywhere
---
Which time?
---
Thanks man!
---
You need to put more faith in duct tape and baling wire.
---
I agree it is weird. 
---
Thank you for these facts. 
---
lol dude
---
it wasn't that terribly long ago virtually everyone in nullsec with a functioning brain had a copy of h-bot npc hunter and bloc-level rmt was a common driving forces of conflict in null
---
it wasn't destroying the game then, nor did darius johnson first strike banning like 20% of the game suddenly usher in an era of equality and dank frags for all
---
CCP doesn't care beyond the lowest hanging fruit / requisite service to the victim mentalities because botting doesn't fundamentally shift any of the key economic equilibria -- if the mechanics are not resilient to widespread botting they are going to be at most a factor of ~2x more resilient to concentrated autism
---
Uh my small 80 man bomber gang can kill them l2p retarded
---
okay so your original point was...?
---
You forgot NC., PL, MC, XiX, BL, KWG, E-UNI, pretty much ever group out there has them.  The trick is finding them and expelling them, something that many folks may claim is easy, but they don't know what they are talking about.
---
There was none
---
smugging about getting spies into horde and renters, the black hand has fallen so far
---
gotcha
---
This is a good post
---
&gt; Is this normal when trying to join a larger group in nullsec? 
---
yes
---
trust is the only currency of any real value in eve. if you don't have a vouch and your recruiter doesn't trust you, you can expect not to be let in anywhere worth being
---
okay dude, this is moderately epic.
---
meme rated 7/10 maybe you can fuck your grandma instead? i'd rate it higher.
---
Apparently, Triglavians and new upwell structures took priority as that affects far more players. If you look at the high end capitals of the pirate factions, you'll be forgiven thinking they're attainable within a year due to skills training. This is not the case! Faction pirate capitals are vanity capitals, only ever used on the field of battle, in reality by the Imperium (because we can afford it) and are silly expensive. They are end game capstone ships for the rich n' infamous. :) Most titan pilots cannot afford a Molok and even when they can, the blueprint drops are very rare so getting hold of one is quite an effort too.
---
yes it is. It's sorting wounded people on a scale of if they are able to be saved or not and if they are able to be saved, what priority they are in order ot be saved, most serious chest wound to the top, people with an ankle sprain down the bottom.
---
  
---
 In a war setting some people are simply unsavable like being eviscerated by shrapnel, massive internal concussion trauma from artillery, unrecoverable head wounds, massive blood lost/about to bleed out, acid or chemical agents etc. Others have just got injuries like head lacerations that can be bandaged up, others lost limbs that can be patched up so they don't die of blood loss etc. These take priority and so on. I honestly lost my point, I blame coffee and lack of sleep

Just the beginning, next up Tuzy will spell out "Palatine Keepstar" out of Keepstars, with the actual Palatine Keepstar as the I in Palatine, and it will be slightly tilted to where it won't align properly with any gate.
---
Well Goons will be able to control the price of the Armor implants.  
---
50 agents with multiple mission hubs in Stain vs 3 agents and no mission hub in Delve.         
---
Armor implant set quadrupling in price soonTM ^^when ^^current ^^stocks ^^are ^^burned           
---
Very good video. Solo is one of the best parts of this game. I will make the fit and give it a try myself.
---
yeah, almost all the aliiance.
---
Cleaning bot is hard for players, its CCP duty.
---
CCP can confirm most bots in backstage, by they only kill several bot and perform as anti-bot.
---
thank for fight along side with botters!!!
---
That applies to anything - if you are to give someone tools to do something, you should always assume the most wrong, exploit-like, improper and abusive use of said tools, regardless of anything. Because it happens every single time - someone will take what was intended to be used well and will find a way to abuse it for their own gain, one way or another.
---
Allow citadels to be anchored everywhere so they can be like outposts? You'll have a citadel grid somewhere. Make timers set by clock instead of interval so people don't have to 4am alarm clock for battles? You'll have timers set in the most annoying uncontestable way for your enemies. Allow skill extraction/injection so players can fine-tune their characters and don't need to wait for years to fly some ships? People will notice that with PI/manufacturing it's easy income if you have hundred of accounts and will set up SP farm. Make sov system built around multiple single ships sitting in space around a constellation for some time? Sov warfare switches to instawarp ceptors headshotting those ships across entire constellation.
---
All those mechanic abuse methods were clearly stated before said changes came live, and they were quite obvious way to do things for a lot of people. I don't like the word "responsibility" here, but it was clearly CCP mistake to not balance for the worst most abusive use case of new features and changes. Even if we consider majority of playerbase to be goodwilled, there will always be someone to abuse given mechanical tools, and then everyone else, to keep up with them, will effectively be forced to do the same.
---
Wait wut O.o
---
CCP is actively removing content like POSes that could be done within a weekend, you know, by people who have a job. Looks like that isn't the target audience for their new content
---
Depending on the mission bots running in the WEQT area.    
---
If hey are burning and not stockpiling LP then it will be possible.      
---
While many people have LP stocks it translates still to quite small full implant sets.       
---
10 full sets require 6mil LP. I can pull 40, people i know +- 30 based on current LP stocks.         
---
Assuming that current LP levels can generate on fly 600 implant sets - it is still smaller than number of titans that require them - not mentioning supers and those people who will want to get one on a subcap.             
---
I agree with you, but you cant let CCP off the hook! They made the current environment possible. Things like multiboxxing 20 Rorquals or VNIs or SP farms with hundreds of accounts shouldnt even be possible. Also, why can a single region sustain the largest coalition in the game? In a game with infinte resources, the player who PvPs loses ... (because skill doesnt matter anymore if you can always field n+1 supers thanks to your endless krabbing).
---
How much LP do you have? for 10-20 sets? or 2-3 sets?    
---
Sure people having lp &lt;10 sets will throw out LP fast - no one cares about those people as they will not change much.      
---
“Rate only up to 20 minutes!”
---
I was WAY more confused when I first heard "reinforce"
---
Or you could join an alliance in which you actually play the game, makes me laugh seeing the amount of autists who join goons then cry boredom
---
BS Guns? Heavies is a cruiser sized weapon my friend.
---
Who cares about higsec bud.        
---
CCP did a mistake letting trade citadels be a thing - all trade should be in NPC stations as having 0 tax let big and wealthy players abuse new people in ways it was not possible before.          
---
Higsec should be for higsec people **as they never will be able to compete with nullsec organized blocks**      
---
Exploits are bad regardless of who uses them, I didn't think that was a controversial stance?
---
But hey, cryposts on reddit are funny regardless.
---
The group using loopholes excessively is Test Alliance by the way, just check how you were constantly dropping alliance with your keepstar before you put it in alliance. Great job finding a way to not have to fight to kill an azbel, most people especially linemembers, wouldve preferred the brawl. 
---
I just feel like TAPI command is filled of little gremlin content thieves trying to find new and abstract ways to get out of having to push F1.
---
People who have a Semiosis Conduction Console somewhere in their inventory get occasionally spooky mails from the Triglavian collective.

**N O T   O N  T H E  R O A D M A P**
---
Excusez me what the baize
---
It's not an exploit to let a wardec lapse. Horde can wardec test if they don't want to get dumped as an ally from another war.
---
Hahahahhahahaha ur a funny little boi.. It was ok when u used these mechanics and forced us to take the TTT into the alliance, but now u complain about others using stupid highsec mechanics?
---
U made my day, thanks kid.. :) 
---
DECLARE 👏 YOUR 👏 OWN 👏 WARDECS
---
&gt; BOT is the NC. and I think PL joint rental alliance that rents out space in drone lands
---
b0t belongs to ncdotto, pl have no stake
---
&gt; I watched those wormhole alliances kick the crap outta some I think Russian corps that had made a new alliance, then died as I believe I keep hearing rumblings that the Russians have finally put aside the tons of differences and might be ready to invade their traditional lands again. 
---
on a longer timescale, yes
---
volta, skillu, lazerhawks, lumpy and hard knocks evicted xix and their coalition from basically all of the drone lands, from oasa down to scalding pass. then when they evac'd, they ambushed the supercap move op and did about a trillion isk in damage to them. xix were offered a couch to crash on by tapi
---
tapi and frat had a nip since the war last summer, and it recently expired, though not before skillu staged a small play into immensea using frat citadels, giving tapi an excuse to terminate it early. xix have now publicly claimed they're going to take frat's space and move back to their "ancestral homeland," which detorid really isn't
---
but i'm not super optimistic about what they're capable of. frat is *big* in their tz, and they krab about as hard as anyone else in eve. i don't think xix have the muscle to contest them and i don't see this war going their way
---
I would respond to the 'points' you have made, but to be fair I think your comment does enough to make you look like a fucken muppet.
---
Gunna kick your shit in just for being a retard tbh
---
&gt; F2P-unfriendly
---
your mistake was thinking that eve is free to play. eve is more like free to *try*.

TIL: Indulgence

---
Large or medium rigs?
---
... with Launcher Rigging 5.
---
For full clearing missions Minmatar hulls (except Vargur and maybe Sleipnir - both are T2 ships and at 6mil SP you're probably very far away from them) don't really offer that much - for clearing missions you want your ship to be able to easily tank all incoming DPS for long/indefinite time, and deal as much damage to as far away as possible. This makes Rattlesnake the ship of choice for clearing missions - decent shield tank and full battleship level DPS with both missiles (range) and sentry drones.
---
For Minmatar battleships I'd look mainly into cruise missile Typhoon, by not using guns you get the freedom of not having to care about your tracking when positioning, you get decent tank and quite good damage application. Have microjumpdrive fit in case you start getting too much damage (so you can jump 100km away and kill some stuff before they catch up to you again), and check mission descriptions to know what resist modules to use - always fit mission-specific tank.
---
\&gt; exploits they have been using to try do anything but fight in hisec   
---
We were waiting for Horde to come and fight in Perimeter earlier, where were you guys?  
---
Oh that's right, you **SOUND THE HORDE RETREAT HORN** instead.  Y'all have no standing to talk about 'trying to do anything but fight in hisec' if you won't show up for the timers you make.
---
What all 5 of them, for being as large as they are on paper Darkness continues to under perform and proves why they are just a pupped alliance.
---
Pretty sick dude! Gj
---
Swap damage control for reactive armor hardener, it's same stacking penalty group, and in missions you usually get quite consistent incoming damage profile, so reactive hardener will give you much more effective value.
---
I could give you the logs of our #war-office that clearly show that todays 'abuse' was just fontunate timing. You could have easily avoided that by just declaring war youself.. So it's hardly an exploit if there is a very simple couterplay.
---
Regarding to the Keepstar save: That happened once, when we were new to high-sec and had no idea what was going on. However, Horde has used these loopholes many times to safe their Azbels, and tried many more times.
---
&gt;  am I the only one this happened to?
---
In EVE the answer to that question defaults to ‘no’.
---
It takes longer to kill a 1M isk mobile depot than a pos with no stront.
---
It's for sure not how the game was intended to be played, do you think this seems like something that shouldnt be fixed? Imagine being in test alliance and making a whole reddit thread about how the enemy reacts to your cheating. Blows the mind.
---
You are a saint.
---
I am legit curious, how is it cheating if they simply let the wardec lapse and everything worked as intended?
---
This bot posts some weird shit
---
How is giving high-sec players a safe trade hub in the Keepstar with 0.1% fee (instead of 2-3% fee in a station) an abuse of new players?
---
You know you can destroy ships, right?  
---
But well, kinda agree with the idea behind this. More "infrastructure" that is more or less useful and impotant. And easy to destroy according to the usefulness etc.  
---
Do you have proof of this?
---
This is how EVE Online works.
---
Getting your boat blown up from under you is an integral part of the process and should not be decried.
---
TLDR: Test finds a loophole that lets them avoid a fight, exploits that loophole, smugs on reddit.
---
Solid 5/7!
---
Its a 'feature' with the new mechanics where the aggressor can put the war into a 24hr cooldown, but can redec during the cooldown whenever. When the 'redec' happens it sheds all the defensive assists that the target. The target then is alone in the war for four hours during any time of the aggressosors choosing no matter what, as thats the amount of time it takes for alliances to assist the war. This is how its laughable that they are claiming it's an accident as the cooldown has to be initiated and the redec done to make in the perfect window. It was very obviously done on purpose. Obviously we will have to straight up dec untill this gets fixed.
---
I kinda agree with the thing that it's not on CCP alone, but it's more complicated than just "we fucked it up".   
---
Banding together is somewhat a natural thing, as well as many other factors that lead to the current EVE meta.  
---
On the other hand, the current geopolitical and diplomatic landscape of EVE is everything else but boring. Yeah, there should be (even more) conflicts and fights, but it's not that nothing is happening... Look around, a lot of shit is going on in almost every corner of the galaxy.  
---
But the CSM told me this new wardec system is for helping the little guy not for the big alliances to find ways to avoid structures being killed. 
---
LOLLLLL. MY BATPHONE DIDN'T WORK YA FUCKEN CHEATING PUSSIES
---
I might just do that, been a lowsec pleb for a year,  and WHs for 2 years before that so it’s been a long time since I’ve had some null shenanigans. 
---
True, though in 99% of cases of structure bashes that isn't a thing. Maybe a few bill here and there.
---
Let's face it, people coming to successfully shoot structures in 1DQ1-A (or anywhere in Fortress Delve really) without a massive invasion armada, compromising of the entirety of EVE at this point - isn't realistic. :p But it would be fun if they tried!
---
Happy cake day!
---
Do you realize that we have only a few people who can do a war dec in TEST? Do you realize that these people also have a life and can't be online 24/7?
---
So how is doing a war dec after you come home from work cheating and an exploit?
---
Yea exactly that - logistics seems used in a very loose sense of the word just to steer away from the "healer" idea when in truth that's what they actually do. 
---
Enginnering/Repair/even support ships i think would be more appropriate 
---
Speed does affect the bomb damage calculation slightly - but not much. What you are seeing is different bombing skill levels and different bombers used.
---
WHs are dope simply because you never know what the next day will bring, who you will run into, or the hectic spontaneous fights that happen out of nowhere. Also, if you like isk...
---
i agree, now why are FW players trying to make FW cearbeary by making it easier to defend. 
---
like the nullblocks,
---
all it would do is lead to stagnant frontlines that dont move.
---
I think they kill a lot more bots than you realize.
---
Awesome work on the heist, but the fact that some people took it too far is bullshit, people forget it’s just lines of code we’re fighting over. 
---
Just performance.
---
Expected something line 9/11
---
Yes it happened by accident.
---
Are you saying you never used any loophole to defend your Azbels?
---
what in the world is that bomber pilot doing. im constantly slamming my head on my table. jesus christ.
---
'Doing a wardec' mate are you trying to act dumb on purpose? The dec was done, then it was put on cooldown and redecced purposefully to exploit this bug. Then you made this retarded thread about how smart you are for cheating. Good on ya mate.
---
Most of the CSM are in goons. For them Test _is_ the little guy.
---
Cute whataboutism ya fucken cheater.
---
Banana you'd have an ounce of respect if you weren't intent on projecting what a shit tier virgin you are daily on this community. Least we don't have to hear that fucking voice on here yikes. Also fucking lol you hyprocrital karma farming faggot, stick to the pot noodles fam [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ael8dw/reve\_really\_lets\_the\_game\_down/edr1j1s/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ael8dw/reve_really_lets_the_game_down/edr1j1s/)
---
Yeah so about that whole putting a whole generation inside the same package ? The new generation are playing more and more, doesn't mean none of them are interested in what Eve has to offer. And you have plenty of ways to not worry too much about Eve stuff for weeks (hello it's called LS CCP, please save it).
---
If this was a real painting, I would love to place it on my wall.
---
Sounds like a reasonable mechanic. Stopped a bat phone blob fest and allowed a honourable 1v1 at the sun between test and Horde? 
---
&gt; The era of marathon gaming is coming to a close
---
no
---
wow the salt
---
Yeah, like PH wouldn't do the exact same thing if they were in a situation like that, lol....
---
If horde could fight them it'd be sweet, the 1v1 was between Test Alliance Please Exploit and the azbel however.
---
As a millennial/gen z myself, I can tell you that eve has reached this generation. I know a couple other people roughly my age that play eve as well. Personally I think that eve is (and has always been) a little bit of a niche game, which is why there is a relatively low amount of new players compared to new games like apex, fortnite, etc. 
---
So Horde never used an loophole to safe an Azbel?
---
These kids have been exposed to technology all their lives. They are really damn smart. That, combined with how many games *arent* punishing and how rare and wonderful it is when you turbo dunk something, along with the streaming potential, make eve a prime area for that kind of experience.
---
Besides that, eve gets *more* niche. You have a market jam packed with instant gratification shooters dumbed down, and when people pull off something amazing the game is then worthwhile. The complexity and deepness of eve give a whole nother world in the gaming sphere today.
---
Eve is that rare, beautifully *eve* outlet that nothing else even comes close to anymore. Thats why it has its pull. Just like always, not many people get hooked into that niche, but those that do stick forever.
---
it should be "Medics" 
---
During Evesterdam they said that they get 10k new players every week.
---
The problem is retention.
---
TAPI smugging on Reddit about the shitty war dec mechanics in high sec is peak dinoposting in TYOOL2019
---
What's that matter? Two wrongs don't really make a right. If I see someone steal a bag of chips, that doesn't mean I'm allowed to steal the other bag "because they are doing it tooooooo".
---
This thread is about how smug you are from cheating, remember? I guess if we did use any loopholes I should be posting threads and smugging.
---
 You reap what you sow . People wanted empire building and safe farming they got it at the cost of conflict 
---
CCP has done quite a bit to make the game more stream viable in the past few years but like you said I believe the game is just too niche to appeal to the microwave gamer that has umpteenth choices. EVE is a game where you can hop in and play for two hours and be good IF you already have it setup to do that. The setup is the grueling part that most don’t have the stomach for.
---
I got a pretty large following on other platforms and I’ve tried to get people into the game. Either it’s too confusing even after I give them guides and step by step videos or it’s just not engaging enough to trip that dopamine. Personally, I’ve never felt anything that compared to space jitters in a 1 v 1 except running from the police lol 
---
I image he posts it for the salt.
---
Some people just dont prefer the expansiveness of it all. That, or it just doesnt ever fully hit them. Thats just how it is. They dont know the party we got goin on.
---
if only wardeccing TEST itself was an option, "thinking"
---
Reeeeeeeee.
---
That's what I'm trying to say the whole time. I don't smug because we used an exploit. I smug because the guys who used loopholes excessively for months now cry because they think we used a similar loophole against them (which we didn't).
---
  Well said
---
StainGuy Wardeccer confirmed. Fuck StainGuy. Long Live ProvidenceGuy! Make Providence NPC!
---
Dont snowball your account. Stick to what you love and it will be faster than you think.  The wait is just a part of the character growth.
---
 Or just spend real life money.
---
CC is best tank.
---
I for one find solace in the fact that a lelveli3ng system has gone so far out of its way to break the players balls in a "mandatory time sink".
---
But if we did that, wouldnt it be too... cookie cutter?
---
But you're the guys that use exploits? You've even proven it with this thread. (Which you did).
---
havent played for a while so maybe stupid question, but how is this possible, isnt citadel anchoring restricted to 1000km from each other?
---
Wardeccer? Bud i am pirate, not some shitty guy chasing newbie cruisers using pimped out T3 cruiser with 3 guardians.    
---
I dunno man. Can horde afford 500m a week?
---
But ccp promotes risk aversion by giving us PANIC............
---
Yes and they have distance between each other
---
The thread isn't really about the smug from the "exploit". It's more about how smug we are from how salty you are about it.
---
Who'd use them if they can just get blapped and lose you everything?
---
Because big and wealthy players use 0% tax to fuck up the newbies that cannot compete with them as :             
---
1. They don't have 0% tax             
---
2. They cannot throw in 500bil on buy/sell orders of few items to close the market.      
---
3. They have no idea what to do and are still learning.          
---
This 2-3% base fee made many market shenanigans not possible as setting orders always costed you.       
---
Just a hint. Dont overdo it with PI Chars. 
---
It can get  really annoying to login logout etc and once in a month or so you should reset the mining-head of each planet (forgot the name of the thing with the 10 mining....heads hehe) to keep the ammount of Materials up. I would prefer 1 or 2 day cycles to reach 1.2-1.5b.
---
  I personally have them set to 24h right now and try to reach the ammount of over 750k raw Materials (in my case felsic magma). 
---
For 24h, 750k and above are okay (i often reach 900k-1m). For 2 days everything over 1.2m raw are also okay because ammounts get less with more time in cycles. Also depends on the material. Felsic magma is (one of) the most expensive on the market and manies seek for it so theres not too much to get.
---
Hope i could help you with that and theres something in my text that you didnt already know. If u have questions regarding pi, mail --&gt; Eutereule. 
---
A weekly tithe for new players and perhaps they can!
---
Yeah, it was a joke about the narrative, I respect Boat a lot.
---
Best relaxing eve Video. Many thanks
---
That's why before fatigue was introduced eve was at it peak. Deleat fatigue and you can get into those fights much quicker. Fatigue only helps slow the game down and make it a longer grind 
---
What LP rate are you isk to reach those numbers? It seems like TDF is better than WTM anyways if their rate is 2-3 times higher than WTM’s 100-150m/h
---
No, we smug because the group that excessively used loopholes, accuses another group of using loopholes and is crying about it.
---
This has been a feature for years people just didn't know about it but ofc now you do since controlling the plex market is the only content in this game.
---
nice local channel changes
---
Not triangle scaffolding. very disappointed 
---
Thank you for a genuine guffaw :-).
---
No. The Newbie pays 0.1% in the Keepstar.
---
A lot of TAPI are bragging about the salt. The reality is I'm disappointed that I had a posted op, with what might have been a good fight, cancelled because of TAPI exploiting this new loophole.
---
Obviously this doesnt reflect on the average tapi linemember who I'm sure would rather have a fight than a boring bash, just the scared and EVE averse tactics of their command. 
---
It bothers me more that people who had planned around attending this op had it come to nil rather than the actual exploit. 
---
Gotta fix this shit for the boys.
---
Dumpster Fire Coalition

WE COME FEED YOU
---
This is stupid. Citadels are so broken. Systems should have calibration number based on upgrades and only allow certain number of citadels.
---
&gt; For the rest of us that aren't smoothe brained, tryhard, skillless, witless, risk averse, fun averse, challenge averse cucklords
---
smoothe brained. That's one to add to my list of things they are.
---
Agreed, 100%.
---
&gt; Who cares about higsec bud 
---
People living in highsec.
---
I do not have a problem with trade citadels. One could argue they give their owners a lot of ISK due to taxes, but if you don't like it, there are enough NPC stations to handle your business, last time I checked Jita still had more people then Perimeter.
---
Regarding big and wealthy players abusing new people, I would say there are a *lot* of other areas where this happens, though I would love to know more about how you think 0 tax trade has opened new areas.
---
About highsec people not being able to compete with nullsec orgnized blocks: currently nobody can compete with them, which is another box of issues, with highsec citadels owned by them only an item that got recently to said box.
---
Resource scarcity and more tools for content generation would be a good start. 
---
(Example: remove jump freighters=haulers are now a source of content)
---
Some other ideas:
---
Modual tiericide and simplification of needless complexity, modernized UI, default overview that isnt trash, remove abyssal space because instancing in a sandbox is a terrible idea and new eden is already to large of a game for its player base.
---
Eve in concept is something that gamers of all generations are craving but what we have right now doesn't deliver the level of immersion and stimuli younger generations are used to (and deserve). Instead we have a mostly empty universe where a new player has to submit to a corp just to experience some pvp they have a chance of getting kills in. If participating in the game on a basic level could be achieved by pressing undock and flying around we would have people playing eve instead of league, fortnight, etc.
---
On top of all, because of unrestricted camera perspective pvp consists of scrolling out and staring at dots move around on a tactical map which is so fucking boring to watch if you arent a huge EVE nerd already. RIP twitch audience potential. When I signed up to play EVE it was because of the cinematic trailers but they're a total lie. Dreadnaught has the right idea as far as camera perspective tbh. 
---
Here was a good one too:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b80m0t/pros_and_cons_of_wormhole_corps_vs_null/
---
&gt; Most small gang people
---
Most people want content handed to them. Fact is, though, that people in small groups are more likely to create content than lemmings who only ever go outside when there's an FC holding their hand.
---
It is knly an exploit if ccp calls it an exploit until then its a game mechanic. Anyway why not dec test directly instead of playing the cheap ally card in someones elses war?
---
Eve will always have terrible retention. It's per definition a niche game.
---
Are Razor even allowed to point with thier Fingers to others ?
---
Why are these Azbels not in Horde to begin with? Then something like that could have never happened. But YOU choose to use alt corps to exploit loopholes. And now you are mad because it backfires.
---
Just purchase more alts to handle the contents.
---
Citadels were a mistake
---
TLDR: ccp could fix the game?
---
We actually use alt corps to stop you from exploiting loopholes, but potato potato.
---
If they know to use it or want to use it.     
---
Newbies read that they need to go to 4-4 and buy/sell stuff there. 
---
You are using keepstar only for high value items - high volume, low value items go by 4-4.         
---
They put the Azbels in alt corps to use these loopholes themselves. Now it backfired and they cry.
---
New players quit the game before they even know what fatigue is.
---
if only anchoring an Azbel as Horde was wan option , "thinking"
---
Kek
---
No, but that just makes you a hypocrite when you start whining like Steadyo is doing...
---
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave...
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaanddddddddddd this is what i am basically saying for the rest of the post.     
---
As for the final part of your post - nullsec blocks should compete with other nullsec blocks.      
---
Simply not in higsec.        
---
&gt; Why don’t they change the skill system to be better for new players 
---
Don't need new players anyway. Unless they are the kind of new players that can afford some injectors every week to satisfy themselves.
---
Dad?
---
Do you have a suggestion how that gameplay would look like? You'll want to give defenders a chance if not only to get some proper fights. That's the reason for damage cap and timers. So, if you have a suggestion that would actually work and isn't just "remove damage cap" or something similar, we're all happy to hear.
---
They should be called space mechanics. :)
---
More and more stuff is seeded in Perimeter now. I wouldn't call Tritanium a high value item, yet you can buy billions in Perimeter.
---
Horde wanted to fight? Oh right, but only if their friends could help.
---
Does it though. 
---
the only cheat i see is the botting and the exploiters.   
---
plex is a essential part of the economy, it has to come from somewhere.
---
you are actually pretty fucking dumb arent you
---
Just have the Azbel in Horde. The only reason you are using alt corps for them  is so that YOU can use loopholes. You saved that same Azbel with loopholes before.
---
Look at faction warfare. A fw plex may not be the same as an entire system/region but it has the mechanics that you suggest. Most of the time, when you warp to a plex you'll find either some frig farming lp, or a bait ship with a bunch of cloaky buddies around it. And that's not taking into account the ones that are just empty.
---
TL;DR Horde puts Azbels in alt corps to use loopholes. It backfires once, and they cry.
---
Because :        
---
If you import ore from nullsec and want to reprocess it - it is better to do it in T2 rigged tatara (sitting on the keepstar grid) - then it is simpler to move it to keepstar than jump the gate.            
---
If you look at the sales - this will be huge volumes dropped at once as big orders. 
---
That is actually a nice write-up about evolution in EVE.
---
The only problem I have: There is no room for the 2nd best in the long run. Which leads to everyone else slowly becoming part of the groups that play the game the "optimal way" or quitting.
---
So what would be really needed for CCP is to change the "optimal way" frequently and by that I do not mean "people have to dock up ship x for a while and use ship y unti x becomes good again".
---
The dinosaurs were the big winners of the evolution, until the environment radically changed. Suddenly small mammals where the kings.
---
I seriously doubt that such a drastic change might hit New Eden soon though, even though it would be the only way to really open the game to new players and yes I am aware that after a while the EVE community would have adapted to the new environment and found a new optimal way. Let's face it, we have become masters at (ab-)using game mechanics to our advantage.
---
The major problem is CCP refuse to make any mechanics that cater to small gang. 
---
Things such as the Ansiblex gates not being anchorable on a citadel would mean small gangs can harass travel of larger groups. It would force groups to protect their highways, instead of just gunning a citadel.
---
CCP said they wanted feature parity to continue, yet we have citadels that are oppressive to the grid they sit on. No one lived in pos's on a large scale, so if anything this is a buff to stations and not feature parity at all. 
---
Deployment. "Hey guys we'll be staging in this citadel for the night" or something like it. Say if you're deep into hostile space with a fleet.
---
Just have the Azbels in Horde, and TEST has to pay for the war bill.
---
that was the one i was talking about :&gt;
---
But you're the group that excessively used loopholes, now posting a thread while you use a loophole again. I mean it's pretty easy to see you're the one in the wrong here, while trying to muddy the waters by referencing historical unspecified loopholes that horde have used. 
---
And UR MOM
---
Are you actually developmentally challenged? It's your azbel that's using the corp fuckery mechanic to avoid war decs not TEST.
---
zkillboard says otherwise
---
You can't talk about EVE history without mentioning Andrew Groen and his literal history book about ingame events. Look up Empires of EVE (vol. 2 currently being worked on) as well as the podcast with the same name.
---
Nah we saved it by killing your ships. We have to use assist mechanics to stop you using your loopholes. Its a shame but it's just how it is. Nice try on trying to edit the narrative while literally posting in a thread you posted about yourself exploiting.
---
In EVE everyone competes with everyone.
---
The only way to seperate highsec and nullsec is to have them on different servers.
---
I personally hold plex responsible for the ridiculous state of EVE's economy these days, but that's another discussion in itself. Have you tried fighting people using deadspace fit pirate ships with 5+b pods? I have, and no matter how dense they may be they have a massive edge over anyone. I also doubt you've seen people camp entire regions with injected cloaky characters.
---
Bring the azbels into Horde and this will never happen again.
---
You got it. If they wanted fights, they would have them in Horde directly.
---
I'm currently in a coalition that does quite some small gang stuff (~15/20 peeps). Hell, our training fleets for newbros are basically a small gang roam in null.
---
I think I have a hard time agreeing with your point when we go there and get dropped caps or supercaps on the face. I don't care that we don't get a "fair fight", but at this point it's beyond ridiculous. Sure we expect a response fleet. Sure we expect that we don't have the numbers or ships blingy enough. But that makes no sense to go crash stupidly in a one-dimensional fight.
---
Before we changed our roaming grounds, we had some big fleet whelps to CVA and co in provi. That didn't involve being dropped caps on, and even if the fight was lost, even if we didn't score a single kill, that felt like fun anyway, die trying, and if we got a couple kills that was awesome.
---
In that sense I think I'd enjoy that suggestion somewhere else in the thread about null regions limited to subcaps. Sure, that wouldn't prevent blobbing by a 25 to 1 force. But that's more than fine IMHO.
---
When people say the map has been controlled by just a few coalitions before, show them this
---
The game is designed around it and it's still challenging.
---
You would need a very thick credit card to do something major with it alone.
---
You've seen how they can appeal to people that want instant action. It's called abyssal space and skill injectors. 
---
They did do the same thing. That's how the out of corp Perimeter Tatara died.
---
Hey there, sorry about your bad bad case of dinobrain, but we have to use the assist mechanics to stop test abusing loopholes. Unfortunately they have just found one more to abuse.
---
Not really. Skill injectors are affordable for so many, and it gives you huge advantage against others.
---
Nice vid, apart from the horrible background music
---
Everyone involved on both sides should deleted their reddit accounts in game, because the posting is Dino/Spod/Steadyo-Brain levels of dumb. 
---
lol. You are literallt retarded
---
Wait, you actually believe using alt corps is an exploit?
---
Are neutral cynos an exploit too?
---
Fuck off Harvey, take that wilmore cunt with you.
---
...why not just declare war on TAPI directly? *MIND BLOWN DUE TO 200 IQ MOVE*
---
Put the Azbel into Horde, and you don't need to assist. Your attempts to use loopholes backfired. And now you cry about it.
---
If you were watching "for weeks," that means you didn't even try to drop on stragglers. We used those structures within a week of them being deployed. (Some of them within 48 hours after my decoy route got leaked here.) This means that you continued to watch them after the bulk of our dudes had left.
---
We were also using POS for a safe logoff point. POS are a lot more engageable than citadels. Why didn't you shoot the POS and moonlock the system, especially in Pynekastoh which only has 15 moons and was the only system on the route with no NPC station?
---
Also, if you were watching the ones in Placid in particular, that necessarily put you out of range of NCdot. Why would you be so dumb and throw away your numbers advantage, especially after we'd killed four of your titans earlier?
---
It's like you were putting effort into being completely ineffective at Eve Online. How did one person (me) outmaneuver an entire 60,000 man coalition with orders of magnitude more FAX?
---
Realistically, why the hell would you want that?
---
Let the young generatin have their Idle Heroes and whatever p2w shit game they want. 
---
&gt;  They wanna hop right into the shit then log out a couple hours later not having to worry about game life playing on in their absence.
---
I want the absolute opposite of this. So let them stay on the other side of the fence. Because i will defend this side with weapons if necessary.
---
Do we want microwave gamers playing oyr game? 
---
NPC incursions are actually a very good idea. The problem is the way they are now is that they are really easy to get rid off, if you use titans and supers and that they disappear on their own if you just spin your ship long enough.
---
What is needed for the game is incursions that *stay* and *scale*.
---
What I mean by this is that if you do not do anything about Sansha, Blood or whatever NPC in the first stage, they will tear down your space. Removing citadels, customs offices, ihubs, claim units and replace them with their own.
---
The current incursion sites should be moved into a harassment section, which means if you do them as a smaller group, the NPCs are less likely to take over, because who wants to live in a region where you are killed all the time?
---
Throw in a couple more variants of incursion sites like NPC mining operations.
---
Also I think it is time to add some more smarts to ♦ NPCs, they do a nice job at warping to pings, logi, etc.. They still fail to use their capitals correctly however, please let them be smart enough to drop them at 0, like everyone else does.
---
No I needed this, I didn't know I did, but I do 
---
Is this post approved by INIT?
---
One would think that someone from TAPI would know basic reddiquette, but one also remembers that PGL does the exact same thing.
---
&gt; 2019-04-03 09:14:00:  Bambulko: Act 1: Horde puts their market Azbels into alt corps to abuse loopholes.

Yet until trade citadels nullsec blocks didn't care about higsec for years.

Finally, someone gets it!

Oh, are you a pirate? Or perhaps, P I R A T 🤔
---
Is it viable to join a WH corp (to try out the 'lifestyle') when you have a limited amount of play time each week? say like an hour or 2 on weekdays and a few hours more in the weekends? 
---
With ham you should use javelin missile for the mob that kite at 30k + missiles guidance computer 
---
But yeah c3 in a T3 is not as a good as in a gila (or rattle snake)
---
This is not true. Many groups found all sorts of ways to manipulate highsec markets to their advantage long before citadels. This is just obvious and open.
---
Rarely do i agree with an anarchist, but this deserves slow clap. :)
---
Leviathans... are not titans!
---
Have you ever been to 1DQ, I'm impressed the spodbrains there manage to fit their ships without dying to a hostile gate camp.
---
I'm not sure if you've realised, but years ago EVE was nowhere near a marathon game. There used to be a time when you could play a couple hours 3-4 days a week and actually get places and achieve things. Gate camps got traffic, gangs roamed around and shit got blown up, while isk held way more value.
---
EVE became a marathon game, it didn't start out as one. In fact, marathon gaming became a thing when companies realised they could put out half baked grindfests and call them games, just so they could milk our wallets. I was born in 96. Not a single game I can think of before 2012-14 really demanded my time. Nowadays, it seems that every game, even single player ones, wants to be a part time job in itself.
---
You want to know what CCP can do so EVE stops bleeding players? Start making actual decent promotional material, stop waiting for the next massive blob fight to advertise, and unfuck the meta and the economy so people actually undock and do shit other than krabbing. If it takes 3 hours for anything remotely exciting to happen, you bet your ass any sane person will quit.
---
“I just want static loot piñatas.”
---
Well that has to do with the max safe krabs. There is a ton of isk being generated in game. And no sinks. Plex is the one constant sink right now. 
---
Ccp assumed the abyss would be of such a sink but the turbo Gila face dunked it. 
---
And everything in this game has a counter. 5 bill pod or not. And there is no jack of all trades ship. 
---
It all comes down to picking your engagement wisely. Doesn't matter if you have all purple perfect rolled turbo credit card insurance. Smart people are gonna mop the floor with you.  
---
The average age of EVE playerbase is 32. Those are millenials.
---
Generation Z is between 9 and 19 rn. It is very likely they don't even have the money to pay an omega sub or a gaming pc.
---
PLEX is at the same price point it has long been (if not always).  Folks  have been using PLEX to fund characters for a long time, just like folks buy it to be able to play for free.  It is not the cause of the economic issues with the game.
---
Vu que c’est un jeu de niche,
---
Il faudrait peut être aller recruter à la SPA
---
Ok je sors 
---
I forget 20-25 year olds are millenials. I feel so much older than kids these days like I'm in a completely different generation. 
---
That might depent on the site. Obviously because of raw dps they do but also how big your orbit is while still trigger drones (npc gun range).
---
If you fly a close orbit ypu won't get near topspeed of the 100mn anyway.
---
I would just try it out and watch the tank closely for a couple of sites, if you want to.
---
Ignore 99% of what this subreddit says. It’s a hive mind with no real direction except to shit on everything.
---
Us rusing you guys about 93PI was probably one of the funnier parts of 2016. Y'all saw five guys staging out there months ago and think it's where we kept all our supers, fuckin lol.
---
You can't really argue that something's not balanced because someone doesn't do research/know what they're doing and take advantage of the citadels that are available to everyone.
---
seems abit salty that the very loopholes they use has been used against him, pretty funny tbh

Because when you just start you are totally lost with all the information to learn

---
Seriously, this thread is like watching WWE midget wrestling if the midgets were also retarded.
---
No. Using alt corps is not an exploit But Horde used alt corps to use loopholes. Now it back-fired on them.
---
The kernel of truth is that one of the main reasons eve struggles to get new players is that it does not offer instant gratification like many other games do.
---
This is actual spodbrain in action.
---
I might try it, but apart from when i need to leave fast, i am content with 100nm... In fors. hubs i orbit a rock at 30 (real orbit is about 35km with about 90% of top speed) and come back in 15 minutes to check and then in another 20 to change sites. Unless Near2 intel alarm goes off. :)
---
So? You're not allowed to link a post?
---
be honest now, if you saw a player named "sniggle snake" would you assume the player is wily and enjoys vexing other players, or would you assume this person was at a cross burning ceremony last weekend? Falcon is rightly saying that words similar to offensive words are not offensive. you just feel offended, and thats okay as long as you understand that being offended does not actually bestow on you any special power or privilege and no one else actually cares, wants to hear your pleas, or is in any way required to hear your complaints. 
---
Space priests.
---
&gt; take that wilmore cunt with you
---
Gladly :)
---
In extreme cases CCP said they will, and indeed did in the past, punish players who clearly exploitet a bug even before they put it on the list. Like the infinite stacking of drone dps boni.
---
Most of the time they take it as clever use of game mechanics until the point in time when they declare something a bannable offense. But i wouldn't generalize it...
---
In this case they will probably do the latter, though.
---
&gt; you didn't even try to drop on stragglers.
---
without using the ecm burst exploit, none of the stragglers were ever lockable. they jumped into instant tether, then warped into safe poses. we tried putting a ship in line between the citadel and pos to smartbomb them in warp and give them red timer, but couldn't get the timing right
---
&gt;Why didn't you shoot the POS and moonlock the system, especially in Pynekastoh which only has 15 moons and was the only system on the route with no NPC station?
---
because snuff, EE and INIT were all watching us at the time and doing anything in black rise or placid would have gotten all of them dropping on us
---
&gt;if you were watching the ones in Placid in particular, that necessarily put you out of range of NCdot
---
&gt;Why would you be so dumb and throw away your numbers advantage, especially after we'd killed four of your titans earlier?
---
you killed one tishu titan thanks
---
anyway it doesn't take much of a numbers advantage to kill a supercap move straggler. just a handful of dreads and a hictor or two
---
&gt;It's like you were putting effort into being completely ineffective at Eve Online
---
goons 2004-2019
---
&gt;How did one person (me) outmaneuver an entire 60,000 man coalition with orders of magnitude more FAX?
---
not sure how the fac part is relevant, but instant tether on jump-in was bullshit overpowered and we both know that's how you got out safely so i'm really not sure why i'm still typing this post. cya
---
&gt; this would be relatively easy to implement
---
&lt;3
---
also the idea is garbage too
---
Your mechanics ignorance is showing. They're able to surrender the war with no consequence, and if timed properly, can make offensive timers uncontestable.
---
Both sides abused that mechanic before resorting to the defending corp/alliance (whose structure is being attacked) being the one being 'assisted' - as that guarantees you are able to fight at the same times.
---
They really are dumb mechanics but there you go. I personally think a surrender should be on a 7 day cooldown, but if you pay a war fine (like 1B per day) you can bring it down to 0 days.
---
kilogramm of spod, or a kilogramm of salt
---
shut the fuck up lmao
---
The video game industry is in a terrible state right now in any case. Games that are released have stupid or even no narrative arc, they're derivative and no fun to play.  Even Metro Exodus, a game I played recently, seemed a poor quality Half-Life 2 rip off (basically a road movie with set-piece action scenes).
---
Eve is kind-of shit right now too as there are no major wars ongoing and when there are, people get burned out after a month and there's a ceasefire.  
---
You're wasting your talent on a  9-5 job....
---
if only there was some way to disrupt the process of pointing a ship precisely towards its warpout point without locking it
---
&gt; Address gate bosoning ... There is no way to circumvent a boson titan at a gate.
---
if local isn't empty, ping before warping to a gate. this is so easy even asher manages it holy fuck dude
---
hey look it's the guy who the law is named after
---
That's what a INIT poster would say!
---
you can shit up a wormhole all you want, but it effects the mass of the holes that spawn (or the ehp of every citadel, the more citadels, the less ehp they have, sorta a "max hp" for the whole system) 
---
Try it in a region with 3 Titans on each gate in 5 systems across your chain. Because there are such regions.
---
You can't even kill a mobile depot without an appointment.
---
&gt; The reality is I'm disappointed that I had a posted op, with what might have been a good fight, cancelled because of TAPI exploiting this new loophole.
---
Imagine posting this, after Horde went home in pods instead of fighting the Keepstar timer they made.
---
Make them cloakable
---
I have fun flying bhaalgorns and caps to bash citadels.

I did that in Northen war of 2018.
---
Will do it again any time

Based on wikipedia : [Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a (...) area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties. Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy)

Low an high would have there own npc public adms.

J space would be interesting if you could actually claim but. Why not just give them a ihub off there own. Could call it "deep space logistics structure"
---
Hell you could do this for sov space to have your system station limited baced on logistics structures an maybe local planet colony's that can provide it to.
---
End up with alliances having capital world's / colonys.
---
Maybe you should... I don't know...put the Azbel in horde?  Oh wait, then you couldn't keep trying to exploit to avoid fights.
---
We were taking a trip to Insmother delivering thermal energy to the needy when we came across something peculiar. The moment our stealth bombers cloaked up, the rorquals would put their excavator drones back out. So we delivered more thermal energy and they put their excavators out again, and again ultimately saving 11 drones from their inattentive overlords before we ran out of bombs.
---
Special mention goes to the stiletto of YeQui who tried to save the rorquals by tackling one of our bombers. We knew for a fact the rorquals did have capital shield reps because they repaired the drones while we were killing them, however YeQui died his heroic deaht without a single rep cycle while getting very slowly killed by torpedoes. YeQui notably is one of the FCs of Fraternity, here is their conversation:

i disagree with the general sentiment of new eden being "too big" - It's hard enough for a small group to find a place called home, shrinking that space would make it near impossible to find space yourself without joining some large blue blob. It's pretty much impossible already in Low and Null.
---
We rather need to solve the problem of renting space being too lucrative. We have vast regions of space that are almost completely empty, but power blocks hold power over them for the sake of renting income. If THAT gets fixed, people would flood space to find a system or constellation to live in. If renting space would all be relinquished today, I bet that 95% of the space would be occupied in a month with groups actually living there.
---
THAT's the way to go imo, not reducing the space and thus EVEN MORE helping the already super large mighty blocks by removing ANY possibility for smallergroups to target.
---
You might be surprised I can't speak for the whole of GSF but i know in our skirmish commanders groups atleast 5 of the more well know names are 19 and under. 
---
it s exactly this, they should stop the timer and we should be able to kill it straight away not with 2 or 1 timer
---
then they just safelog and wait us out holy shit you're dense i'm done
---
exactly
---
mobas are really out nowadays, you're out of touch man. It's all about battle royals and collection games.
---
in a weird way, that's hardcore itself. only 1st palce wins, everyone else is a loser and you never have a complete collection of everything epic. that's not instant gratification right there.
---
I actually think that this is a sign that people are saturated with instant gratification mmos and search meaningful ways of gaming again. The market is definitely there.
---
if only there was some sort of way to not only disrupt the alignment of a ship utilizing the tiny surface area available to it by dint of jumping to a hideously undersized structure, but modify its position as well 
---
It's been going on for a couple of years now if I remember right :)
---
I am not sure what you mean by the question, but after they finish a focus (killing the last site called The Kundalini Manifest) the TDF guys are at the top 10 of the LP leaderboards. Havis (the main HQ FC and the mastermind behind all fits and techniques) has about 600-700k+ LP I think. Maybe more so I am gonna check ones I am home. LP sells for 1300ISK/LP in highsec, so selling all your LP after hardcore grinding sites in a focus, that's 1Bil extra per focus. A focus is up for 3-5 days I think (from memory so I might be wrong).  
---
TDF is elite. They make a habit of checking on peoples ships to make sure they upgrade when they have the money, but you can get into an "Elite Fit" after 2-3 Weekends and after that they don't care what you do with your ISK.  
---
The Logi's are more then Elite. TDF had only lost 5 ships in 2018 as far as I remember, while WTM has lost significantly more (21 ships from the last time they got ganked alone.)  
---
The list of the strong points of TDF goes on, but it would be best to see for yourself.  
---
I talk about WTM like they are not good, but that's just my personal opinion. Check out TDF. Check out WTM. Check out Armor1. You will see for yourself which community is the better for you.
---
Give me your IGN, i'll send you some isk for posting. :D
---
CSPA has been around for ever and was always set to on (2500isk iirc). A few years ago CCP set it to off for everyone by default but you could opt to turn it on.
---
&gt;Try those and come back to me.
---
alright you drooling fucking retard buckle up
---
i was roaming when aoe dds were still in the game and on more than one occasion had to dodge an aoe doomsday on every gate for 10 jumps in tribute because some bored, rich asshole had decided it would be fun to chase a small gang with an avatar. i actually lost my first rapier when i tried to tackle a broadsword on the taisy gate in m-o for my gang who were two jumps behind me, he hic pointed me, and it turned out he was the alt of the avatar pilot who had already been chasing us. he fed his broadsword so that he could kill *just my rapier*
---
the simple fact of the matter is, you can avoid a boson by pinging off the gate to make sure it's clear before warping down. if you have to do that on every gate, you have to do that on every gate. if you're too fucking stupid to figure that out, you should try an easier game, like maybe world of warcraft, or maybe super mario n64. or maybe try modifying your fleet composition to all be covert-bridgable ships and just ignore gates altogether. the possibilities are endless. it's a sandbox. figure it out
---
if you find that mechanic to be frustrating, you're not the only one, but you are the only one loudly complaining for ccp to nerf it because you're the only one so completely lacking in self-awareness that you don't realize the hurdle you're tripping over isn't the mechanic, but simply how fucking bad you are at eve online
---
Considering nothing in Eve lasts forever, it's going to be one hell of a day if this system ever burns.

I made a bunch of specialised alts to try out things without killing my rather split-skill carebear main and it's own/corp's rep:
---
* My mining/indy alt was awesome instantly because I had experience in that.
---
* My trading alt was awesome instantly because I had experience in that.
---
* My PI alt was awesome instantly because I had experience in that.
---
* My PvP alt sucked balls because I had no experience in that.
---
Obviously, I'm spending time on the last one because I need to get better, but honestly, I could inject my miner into a rorq and be good at it because I've played that style almost to the point of being able able to do so via 'natural training' on my main, but if I inject my PvP alt into a carrier, I'll just get more expensive losses because I will still be shit, just more blingy shit. 
---
Injectors only work if you already have the (pilot) skill. Otherwise, skill injectors are just paying for someone else to get a fancier killmail out of you.
---
This was...... mildly disturbing. :)
---
Ever heard of neutral logi and gank fit catalysts/coercer/etc ?
---
Just go paperpush some more fights out of existence scrub.

One XL per system (Keepstar, Sotiyo), one large per planet (Fort, Azbel, Tatara), one small per moon (Athanor, Astrahus, Raitaru) and rework the Palatine to make it build able, and limit one per Region, so its the regions Capital system if you will.
---
I remember a few years ago I tried to run a scam with this, but the max amount you can ask for is about 2m ISK iirc. Additionally, you do not receive the ISK, it goes to CONCORD.
---
I still ran this scam for a few days though, at least highsec people burned some isk. I was a living isk sink.
---
The point is not how you can't be lazy and direct warp to gates. It is how you can't take the gate when it's not clear. 
---
Imagine being that retarded to offer pinging as a solution vs gate bosons in 2019.
---
I'm not haggling over the names? ... my response was to CCP that  instead of writing 115 lines to basically insult, you could do it in much less and achieve a better result. The above is just a case of "stfu 'customer' prove it or gtfo' attitude.
---
Which i think is immature... its one thing for reddit to be in the sewers of player sentiment ..but CCP shouldn't meet us at the tide mark on maturity levels either...

Imagine being that retarded to offer pinging as a solution vs gate bosons in 2019. Yeah we have never thought of that you fucking Einstein.
---
That's been there since 2003 LOL
---
That’s an awesome painting sir 
---
Lol. No new player is putting down trade citadels or trying to corner a market.

Interested in why he chose plex and not injectors to point the finger at

The only stuff that he has is someone telling him how it is in texas? He makes one video and screenshot about it. Wow.
---
What do you want ccp to do something with it? It a not a bully or doxxing or whatever.
---
Someone in init said that they saw he was in texas because of public photo about social media where this man show off. There s no tracking about this guy

Some red knows i m living in iceland, and sometimes asking me how it is going in iceland? Oh well should i worry for my life? :D I think texas is bigger than iceland :x

Pandemic Fever has started to boil their brains it seems, if only they got vaccinated
---
You weren't a living isk sink were you.  You like to think of yourself as that but really you're just a bit of a jerk.
---
*at fan fest*
---
Yeah. But that's their point and always was. A super small 1-man base a player could come back to.
---
What it was not intended to be initially, is an invincible excavator safe. That will at least in part change soon.
---
inflation is huge, alot of money enters the game but destruction is minimal.

This is eve dude, wrench your dick back out of your pussy

IIRC they started off saying ther were going to be small upwell structures, which turned out to be the new gates and beacons.
---
I'm not sure how concrete they were on what structures will follow them.
---
why are exploits marked w/ a picture of a couch 
---
why you no show for the keepstar fight??????????

&gt; Y'all have no standing to talk about 'trying to do anything but fight in hisec' if you won't show up for the timers you make.

Just this! ^

aight here's the part where you're stupid

at the time, bumping a ship out of tether while it was safe logging was an exploit and would get you banned and the ship reimbursed
---
or did you not remember that part?
---
I'm not out of touch. I know mobas are out now. They were just fotm before battle royales.
---
Unless shitty niche space mmos becomes the next fotm, eve will never be popular.
---
From what i remember Tishu was too busy getting a "high" wanted level in its little pocket of space
---
And getting deep dicked for all the titans they had every time they dropped as well as having them stolen from POS with standardised passwords
---
Then autistically screeching about "reeeee people jewing"
---
What are you even trying to fix? Stop trying to force people to do shitty pve and go back to mine your spod. Renting is not a problem in eve it’s a solution: Pvp entities get non pve income and others get content that is not protected by a massive super umbrella. Eve doesn’t have a problem with renting eve has : - to easy and to fast defensive force projection, - to much (usable) space. Renting is just a solution found for all this unnecessary but usable space. Your shitty incursions will do nothing about the real issues.
---
They didnt even make dek dangerous after Goons left, it was so empty you could literally solo jump supers out without coming across anyone that could shoot you
---
We have set naming in our wh corp and thankfully everyone follows it.
---
First 3 letters for sig, class and &lt; for outgoing/incoming&gt; st for static and in brackets if it has any effects, eol ect.. and HS if it's the route to Highsec
---
Eg HGT&lt;C3-ST(mag crit-hs)
---
All wormholes leading home are "homeward" and home is always labelled "home" 
---
Sorry, I still don't get your point. 
---
I can't write a similar story like this:
---
"One day I travel to hostile space, when we enter the system, all the miners run away immediately, so they are bots
---
The other day when I travel to hostile space, the miners do not run, so their bots are broken."
---
in the incursion i was part of i learned to say "space reptile in the vindi getting primaried" instead of "im getting shot at help"   
---
while i still used the broadcast, giving a vocal reminder can help
---
Don't talk shit about Initshitive PD, we'll come to your wormhole and solo you with all our friends
---
except ccp's own support page says ["lol just dock idiot"](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/207568639-Upwell-Structure-Ship-Tethering)

and it's said that [since july 2016](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/6565833/#post6565833)
---
The negative impact of all these "ur bot" speculations is that they undermine the credibility of the real botting problem.
---
energy pulse weapon(skill name), or "kinetic/em/therm/explosive discharge pulse" would go well 
---
Did you read the story? They stealthed up in bombers (so the rorquals saw them go stealth) instead of leaving the rorquals just went back to mining. The bombers shot at the excavators and then cloaked up again and the rorquals still elected not to leave but to go back to mining. 
---
Yeah, once we finally figured out how they were hunting supercaps (logserver cyno pings in IRC + shared hic accounts) it became trivial to sneak supers out under their noses. 2016 taught me that hostiles are fuckin' lazy.

If you see it that way you have to add another lower half, showing an unemployed neckbeard that can afford to EVE 10 hrs everyday ... but maybe you should ask someone with half a brain about economic systems ....

When i unravel my VNIs i use 10km orbits on the rock right above the warp in.  Rarely scratches the tank.

---
Psychotic Radakos representing all of EVE - now that's something to laugh about.
---
Using your own analogy, what you are asking for is for them to remove the "castles" and "moats" and "standing armies of knights and armsmen" so that your "barbarians" can roam around and kill "peasants".  
---
You are asking for CCP to develop some mechanic where your 20 people can go and successfully engage someone else's &gt;20 and win, but in a manner that those &gt;20 can't use the same mechanic to win. The only way that's possible is arena style gameplay similar to premade 20v20 matches of Call of Duty, World of Tanks or some other arcade style game.  
---
Any single mechanic put into the game that will make your 10 or 20 people powerful will be usable by the groups that include 40 or 50 sets of 10 to 20 people and you still won't be able to win if they resist. The problem isn't the numbers, it's that there are groups of people that believe that they are so badass that they can win most/all fights but when they run into people using the same mechanics and opportunities in games, they don't win these fights and then they have to face reality and it's at THIS moment that narcissism kicks in.  Outside of a premade match of team vs. team, any mechanic that will benefit a group of people will also benefit MULTIPLE groups of people working together.
---
Except we was still war-dec by all of Tests friends but lost our allies.
---
Welcome to EVE, we love to see more new players joining our community!
---
That's what happens on serenity and those poor souls are still suffering.
---
No thanks.
---
Regarding point 5, I'm on the fence. I currently live in a wh and do roams through null with the static and it is frustrating having to watch the mass, which limits you to small gangs (small in comparison to the 200+ pilot response fleets we often get). Having bigger mass and bigger max jump mass would be great. I'd love to be able to take more pilots or bigger ships through.
---
BUT there's just something I can't quite put my finger on about it that feels wrong. I'll probably realise what it is in the shower tomorrow. Or maybe I'll realise it's a good idea and I completely agree.
---
Agree with all your other points. I'd also add one point that FW systems should be cyno inhibited, which can't be deactivated.
---
I must say, this Steadyo guy cries like a little bitch
---
Fix: Event that destroys/removes ALL structures, including NPC ones, in 1/5 of low sec systems.  Inject some resource required for something important. Put it behind a barrier (giant heavy radiation cloud) that does damage based on sig/ship size and is grid wide. No capitals would survive the damage tick for more than 10-15 seconds, at all. Subcaps even without reps would survive for 10-20 minutes or maybe even not take damage at all from it. You now have a contestable resource that cannot be mined by rorquals, cannot be turbo dropped by capital escalation and no one will own the systems or have any ability to really own it aside from literally keeping players at the gates 24/7.
---
CSPA charges were all zeroed out a few years ago, if people hadn't changed them.
---
If you doubt my story, ask YeQui, he was there and saw it all.
---
There are people with more money than sense. Those make fine trophys on anyones killboard.
---
&gt; and murder anyone who bounced
---
Now there you see the prime knowledge on how to move supers, but as you said already, when having a Super included having some skill you were not around ...
---
You want T2 light drones to get rid of small stuff - a few days training. A Thyphoon is quite relaxing, sniping 70-80 km away. Some Sentry Drones may clear incoming cruiser. 
---
A 1400 mm Arty Machariel may be boring, but is also quite relaxing. With Faction ammo you hit from 80 km away - slightly out of optimal. It has the highest sub cap alpha damage - roughly 10 k will finish BC with one hit.
---
A Marauder is very handy, but how long will you grind to get it - the ROI is incredible. A carrier is cheaper and more effective. A CTG (caarrier to gois signifficantly cheaper than a half way effective T2 Battle Ship. You will sit earlier in a Loki or the caldari popper ship. 
---
I used my Vargur only a few times. In Null Sec it could be useless. You earn even in high sec more ISK with different approaches. 
---
You should consider a combination of mobile depot, MJD and prop mod to be mobil in your misson. A MWD will drain your cap already before undcocking. With a MJD you are able to escape any situation unless you have jump cap - so no need for a secons prop mod. So loosing your mission boat will be a serious atempt. 
---
And keep in mind, Mini´s are not the best ratting options. The Raven was already mentioned and to have missile skills is a no brainer for Minmatar. These rust buckles shine when you have a buch of skill points. A decent minmatar ship will apply damage when all other races are jammed or left behind on the field. But that is for PVP - in hisec others have better ships for PVE. Drone boats are still valid, Vexor Navy will handle many missions for a small budget. The amazing thing is that the large drones are useful on many ships and ship classes (T2 heavy for VNI, Myrmidion, Dorminix). Sentry Drones are usefull on any cruise missile ship.
---
Lol 
---
A long time ago, Eve had a problem with spam bots in game. (this was pre my time)
---
So CSPA charges were added, and defaulted to 2950isk (I think) It's a pure sink, not going to any player.
---
Now that those bots are not a problem, they've been set to 0 for everyone who hadn't touched it.  (this was something like 3 or 4 years back) But people can still set it
---
More like Vietnam 
---
that's not gratification for me, but i dont care, really, because i hate these games. not gonna defend them.^^
---
That is even better.
---
I killed a bot earlier too, he launched drones and then pulled them back when I shot them, when I stopped and switched back to his machariel the drones engaged me AGAIN!!

What evidence are you basing your statement on regarding "young millennials and Generation Z || era of marathon gaming is comming to an end"? If it is your opinion then fine however I suspect it maybe limited to your experience or exposure to/of this so called generation Z etc.
---
However I personally love the thought of this game continueing to excel and attract new and old players alike.
---
What is crazy in that, plan a route, buy 10 Astras and anchor them.
---
If you choose the right systems, nobody will even notice. I did that with Raitarus for my corp 2 times when we were moving our supers/titans from one alliance to another ... 
---
Citadels, especially in the timespan when you had insta-tether, were a 99,9% safe way to travel even without a brain...

During WWB there were some regions that burned down pretty damn fast. Aegis has changed for the better since than so it's not 1:1 comparable anyway.

When I go, I get 100% alliance attendance. But I never get anything for it :'(
---
Once the region was abandoned it was burned down quickly? Huh.

lol rekt nob go play wow

That feature is ancient i.e. has been in the game since the early years :)

Sounds more like Vily led cowards smugging on reddit about loopholes.  need to paint a yellow strip on the back of all your ship skins.

I hope you're not talking in local, we aren't allowed to talk in local unless FC says so!

I agree with Haber’s response 
---
Serenity had nothing to do with ccp
---
MY BAD
---
Lol retarded much?
---
A bot would read local. You don't leave local by stealthing up. It is just an idiot player.
---
Tbh that's still too ****n many. Being able to dock should feel like a luxury
---
this is a good post
---
That is not indicative of a bot, but instead of an idiot player. Bots generally pull drones and warp when you enter local, has nothing to do with you being cloaked or not.

We're here, we're queer, and we're still recruiting

You are right, nobody ever used POS as you could blap them in 48h max and loot them .....
---
No, I just want an incentive for grinding 7 days of timer.
---
&gt; “I just want static loot piñatas.”
---
How people could have assets in over a decade of POS ?
---
Anything that discourages neutrals (apart from perhaps cyno inhib in FW systems) will only make lowsec quieter and FW less fun. 
---
Hmm, then you lied on other posts to me, where you said you dont care how it was before citadels as you were not around. Molding your narratives to the need errrday ?
---
Yeah, he has fallen out of favor even within horde and other FCs because of his behavior. He's probably going to attempt to do something big and showy only to fail hard at it and then sell his character. 
---
To expand my other comment:  
---
TDF does 270-290Mil ISK/h  WITH LP
---
WTM does 100-150Mil ISK/h WITHOUT LP
---
One HQ site gives you 6500 LP per site.  
---
150mil/hr is 4.8 sites per hour so if we take 5 (let's be generous) we get 32.5k LP/hr which is 42.25k ISK/h.  
---
Therefore WTM acctually makes 193mil ISK/h WITH LP.  
---
TDF does 270mil ISK/h on average, dropping and rising sometimes WITH LP.
---
"Happy speed" of WTM (like another commentator put it is 200mil ISK/h WITHOUT LP.  
---
Using the same logic that 6.3 hours per site so ~42k LP/h which is an additional 54mil ISK/h.  
---
That makes WTM "Happy speed" 254mil ISK/h which is still below TDF.  
---
Plus you should forget that a stronger fleet wins more contests, so with WTM and TDF using the same focus and contesting sites, that number drops significantly for WTM and rises for TDF.
---
There is currently no FC from another community that even bothers to contest TDF, because even if they come on late on the site, they win.  
---
Reason for that are multiple things, but if you put skill out of the equation (so we don't offend anyone here) TDF still rules the playing field. Why? Armor Incursions are better then Shield. Nestors, Vindies, Paladins, Leshaks. That and the fact that armor Nightmares are better then shield Vindies.
---
Because a lot of it is farmville in space, they need to push the industrial side to mobile or something of the sort.  Basically make the planets a mobile game where you do PI, attack other bases etc.  sell your stuff to the customs houses, get support from EVE, blah blah blah.  And then it becomes a gateway to real eve. 
---
Yeah the kernel I was going with that the skill and complexity curve is pretty steep.  And the new player experience is a little rough, as even admitted by Hilmar on TiS lately.  There is a considerable investment required in terms of time and effort by the player and to your point they don’t hand out eye candy to create an addiction to instant rewards like some other games have evolved.  
---
But it’s exactly this complexity that is what makes this game more of a hobby and one that rewards players who make the investment into their own skill and knowledge and this should be celebrated instead of berated by less skilled/quality players who just want loot/achievement handed out for log ins.  
---
I for one enjoy the challenge of choosing skills and spend the time in skill queue actually learning how to play the game.   Taking a longer term view of accomplishments also helps.   
---
Do ALL of these keepstars have 5 Star nightclubs and resorts? 
---
Pretty much, I made a thread years ago telling all the dead ass publords they need to invade delve before it's too late. 
---
We dropped muninns on rorqs in immensea the other day. One of them dropped his excavs while we were on grid - guess he was a bot. We bombed about 40 excavs off a moon in Delve while rorqs were out when they shouldn't be during a max CTA. Bomb, warp, cloak, come back. Must have been bots. Right? Is this the level of fucking stupid we're becoming now? Any kill is evidence of botting?
---
I agree with a ton of isk being generated and no sinks. I however do not agree with Plex being a sink (because it isn't, you are buying them from other players, thus merely moving isk).
---
Abyss never was an isk sink, because everything you put in there is made by players, which you paid isk for. If your ship dies in Abyssal space, you get insurance, in other words isk gets generated.
---
Ofc everything in eve has a counter, which essentially boil down to "bring better, bigger stuff" or "bring the same stuff, but more of it" (not factoring in the complete spodbrains who lose shiny stuff because of not having any clue how the game mechanics work, because they are not a threat to anyone).
---
Also while smarter people with more game experience have the ability to mop the floor with you, it gives you an advantage over players with the same amount of game experience, but without a credit card (for example new players, but who wants them in this elitist hardcore PVP game anyway, right?)
---
If you are all about letting go of the past does that mean you are voting for me now?

48 hours is a lot more than "no reinforce timer."
---
no please stop posting
---
wormhole space is the last wild west of this supposedly free game. dont introduce alliance and coalition bullshit there.
---
I dunno let's go look at how many 50,000 unit PLEX buy orders in 0% citadels are up right now. It makes it trivial to manipulate prices.
---
A POS had a 48 hour reinforcement timer. I am all in favor of having shorter reinforcement timers, but no one will use a structure with "no reinforce timer and no asset safety" as long as there is an alternative.
---
Imagine being this retarded. 
---
I like that idea. Let a small gang spend something like 15 minutes doing entosis to an I-Hub and have it shut down all benefits from the I-Hub for an hour.

TLDR of the answers:
---
"Its not P2W because after 1 year of skill training and lots of grinding you will have the same skill points and gear. The time factor is totally not important!"
---
"Its not P2W because people who buy stuff with real money are always big noobs and can be beat by a 10 year veteran."
---
Dont u bully my friends IDIOT EURO
---
Dude, you are so 2011. Get in the 2019 mindset! Its only P2W when you can buy a literal "I WIN" button! Paying for advantage is fair and balanced!!!
---
If you have the chance, when you escape something hunting you, go back and give them a fight if you have any chance of winning.
---
NO reinforce timer is not a good idea, thats right. I would give M-Size 48hrs max like POS, L-Size 96 hrs max and Keeps can keep the current system. 
---
 10000 people try EVE weekly they said and most don't stay.Fact is EVE is boring

That mean you are progressing in the slow way to become a bit vet, gz, it feels good when someone tries to gank you and you live to be ganked another day
---
Right?! Isnt that the point of doing something like that? haha
---
Urm, elaborate. 
---
No me
---
Agreed. This shit started with injectors. 
---
Uh, I've been playing this game since 2010. Care to link a post of mine that says what you claim?
---
Don't do drugs, kids.
---
Or, perhaps, do them. The ones your doctor prescribes.
---
Was gunna say, ask frat lol
---
Ordering an eviction to your home right now for not taking up a fight.
---
ok smartass, if it is 'ownable space' go take it over and make your own rules, oh wait you cant, because it is not ownable. 
---
you mistake plexing for a systems stat as earning ownership, its not. its a silly thing to think you OWN as players those systems with your faction warfare's name on them. 
---
say a caldari faction system is taken over, all they have to do is make an alt corp, join the enemy faction, and remove and add people onto thier ACLS as they want. then they continue to have small structure costs, but only allow caldari factions to dock even though the structures are in the opposing teams side.
---
i am saying if you faction war dudes want to decide rules for an area, the idea of the game is to go and do that in your own space. one that you actually own.
---
if you do not have the ability to do that, FW space is there but you gotta deal with the ups and downs.
---
PM me if you still need someone to talk to and play with im Open for suggestions :)
---
lmao fuck of ya strange cunt.
---
i second this
---
I'm more disappointed I wasted a jumpclone and a million ISK to replace it.
---
Isn't the point of using several alt corp for these Azbels just to make it a pain in the ass for the attackers, aren't they the ones that have to pay for the war after all? Which means they'll have to go looking for the corps, wardec them all, etc, etc.
---
Imagine that with equal Pilot skills, SP become the tipping point!
---
Congrats bro. Domi lives matter
---
I believe the implication is that the rorqs don't care about local (to some degree), only what's on grid. In case you missed that.
---
I don't get it :/  
---
Can someone explain?  
---
that would be really cool actually
---
While I couldn't care less about this highsec drama, what's the point of having them in a main alliance or whatever? Seems to me that they're just trying to have some up to stop your Keepstar from generating all of the income. If that's the goal it's way more work for whoever have to comb through all the corps on TEST's side I'd imagine, in comparison to just deccing Horde and nothing more.
---
Hotel ?
---
Completely agree.
---
Imagine not understanding the value of time outside of a video game. 
---
Rating and mining and market trading and PI and scamming and manufacturing and ganking  take time unless you are using real cheat codes like botters do. 
---
PLEX lets people who have better shit to do than grind in a video game actually enjoy their limited time playing while making it cheaper isk wise and free IRL to play for those that do put the time and effort or enjoyment into a video game to do so. 
---
You’ve mentioned horde using loophole about 50 times now, care to elaborate on what loophole you think we’re using? Surely it can’t just be the fact that we’re using alt corps, so what is it?
---
Is it though? The limit would be **reached** by this point.
---
Also, to build your structure, groups would have to populate un populated space, and spread out to build their structures.
---
The whole list that CCP had to fix recently because of months of abuse by horde... hard to miss I guess.
---
I still don't get it :/ Is that an American thing?
---
Basicaly the add goes like this : "Hotel ? Trivago " it became a meme. So I adapted it to eve 
---
Don't forget Repeaters and Threepeaters
---
Correct.  It's precisely 48 hours more.  
---
Darkness need Purge Jacob Deen as FC. Has No business been in Monitor , give’em a Cormorant let him tag alone.
---
np links are just there to help prevent brigading, not as a get out of jail free card if you do
---
&gt;I cannot see bomber therefore he is not there.
---
so we're dealing with Pakled-levels of stupid here?
---
Ah, it's based on an ad -.-   
---
Never saw that one! But it makes sense now ;)  
---
You can't dock Rorqs in Athanors so there is that going for you...
---
The gloves are off, StainGuy used the trigger "bud"
---
How much you have to pay the chinese botter mercs to do all the work for you? You have to feel very lucky at least that snuff decided this time not to shit on you like just a few weeks before.
---
Yes , but you can't expect people to NOT talk about eve things that happen on Reddit , especially with a corp that is called dREDDIT.  So we use NP links for that.  
---
I call my plexing "Krabbing IRL". I work hard, and I work a lot! I don't have the time to devote to EVE like I once did, and I have the disposable income to PLEX. It helps me enjoy the game and support CCP, it helps the markets gears stay lubricated, and it means that my ships are providing content for someone. It also means I can devote my multiple accounts to content, rather than some half-AFK freighter alt doing couriers, my AFK ishtar doing sites, and so on and so fourth. It means everything is content!
---
So for now, I shall keep krabbing IRL to fund my EVE enjoyment. Because it's a net positive for the game, and most importantly myself.
---
And in k-space, that alternative is NPC stations.
---
thanks cant wait for your next review
---
what would you rate it if he fucked his dad?
---
Did you just assume a whole generation? 
---
So... you want to create something that feeds lots and lots of NPC ships into a waiting fleet so that their wallets explode?
---
And where did I say introduction off alliances coalition "bullshit." ?
---
Because plex is what made multiboxing, mass PI and skill farms viable. Before plex sure, you could pay with isk for a time code on the forums. But that took effort browsing the forums and carried the risk of fraud. Nowadays with plex you always know what you get and you just click a couple times on the market window.
---
Injectors are part of the problem, but by themselves are not nearly as important. Imagine EVE with just injectors. A few players can afford to have maybe 10 accounts subbed at a time, but the vast majority are limited to 1 or 2 because of RL reasons, which is really, really far from today's absurd average of 13 accounts per person. Those accounts may have characters with absurd amounts of SP on them, sure, but 10 VNIs&gt;&gt;&gt;1-2 max skill rattles or what have you. Without plex people would be forced to shift from making tons of minimum skill alts that contribute no content and inflate income streams infinitely to a few high sp characters. Nullsec empires would deflate and become a tad bit more vulnerable, wormhole space would gradually become healthy again with all the farming holes now clean. I struggle to find the negatives really.
---
I doubt ally shedding is anything other than unintended. As such, I'd expect a fix for it at some point. 
---
Dinobrains showing their true IQ
---
The CSPA charge has been around longer than I can remember. It's set to 0 by default now, but it can still be turned back on.
---
Yes the OP is stupid , welcome to r/eve
---
7b is chump change in this case though.
---
When I say "economy" I don't mean the price of plex. There's hundreds of commodities in the game, and every single one of them is affected by the fact that plex is a thing. Ships, rigs, drones, guns, everything that is part of the meta is directly or indirectly affected by plex and its availability.
---
If by whole list you mean
---
&gt;To prevent exploits surrounding wars, it is no longer possible for a defending corporation to join an alliance that has an offensive war against their aggressor.
---
then that's not a lot. It isn't even a list. I also don't see how this would even be used to gain an advantage, if CCP hasn't fucked up majorly and spaghetticoded something in to help with that. All I remember is us beating TAPI's ass on every possible occasion. Do they consider this an exploit, because they think fighting without your goonie overlord involved isn't EVE?
---
Considering returning player here, what do injectors do?
---
they arent
---
the generally accepted cutoff date for millenials is 1996
---
i ain't wrong about this tho
---
which would win: a 60,000 man coalition with functionally infinite funds, an order of magnitude more fax and a bigger number of supers
---
or one asshouse boi
---
to this day i still don't know what you people were so scared about that kept you from destroying our shit
---
Eve is kill?
---
So... Thera?
---
Yeah, I didn't exactly prep for a screenshot.  Just did it quickly when I realized what it was.
---
Man was d-scanning. I think he deserves a pass.
---
That is what destroyed the "high accuracy" combat flight sim business I think. I'm talking things like Falcon 4.0, Jane's F-15E and Jane's Hornet. 
---
The current "youts' don't have the patience to learn a game that takes learning a 500 page manual+a separate 500 page gamer guide to do really well at. 
---
Therefore you get dumbed down arcade crap masquerading as "the most accurate flight model ever!" and the noobs don't know or care you can't pull 9gs in a Strike Eagle with bombs loaded and even if you could.."over g!...over g!...over g!!!"
---
Even has the same problem ultimately. Plus I've noticed most "youts" literally don't like to think that much. "Math is HARD and so is EVE"!
---
i know :) Most of the amswers were the second type. Isk is not Skil. But i come from a old time in EVE. Where if you wanted an industry alt you had to train and be patient for months and years before being able to use it properly. Now if a new ship is released with a new trend , credit card warriors can instantly access it. 
---
I guess I don't understand how this game is pay to win. I mean sure I understand you can get like 1b for 20 bucks but... you're getting that money from other players so someone had to work for the isk right? Would you feel better about losing to a bling fit pirate faction ship if you knew the guy spent his own time farming the brazillions of isk to fit it?  
---
Would you feel better if he collected/built the mods himself?  
---
Would you feel better if he looted the mods off of someone he beat in pvp and set them aside until he could field something outrageous?  
---
It's not like CCP is just selling isk for cash. Someone is doing the work.  
---
If anything it's the botters and SP farms that are the problem, not PLEX.
---
They give you skill points.
---
So everyone complains about high plex prices, but also about the people who buy plex irl to sell on the market 
---
Any character with more than 5.5million skill points can use a skill extractor on themselves to remove 500k skillpoints.  The loaded extractor becomes an *injector*.  Skill point injectors can be used by a second character to inject anywhere between 500k - 200k skillpoints.  The more SP the injecting char has, the less benefit they see from using the injector.  Diminishing returns.
---
Injectors can be bought and traded on the market.  and are currently priced around 950m each.
---
With deep enough pockets one can literally instantly roll a day one toon capable if sitting in a titan.
---
You, I like you
---
You are wrong here.
---
Pvp takes time.
---
I just want to shit up comms while mining and station spinning. 
---
The more complicated your naming system, the less people will scan... KISS. Zero benefit to a 'very descriptive' naming convention.
---
The 2 Idiot system is here to stay!
---
No he won't, he'll just stop scanning or join a less retarded corp.
---
Like hell I do, the price for selling them piecemeal will still be a pretty penny
---
Who says they're injected? I feel like you're exaggerating here.
---
A cloaky camping toon is super quick to train, and you can even use them to condition the systems you're operating in before you get the skills.
---
Imagine this;
---
You make a new character, train it into a t1 frig and put a shitty cloak on there. Park it in a system while you slowtrain the proper skills for the cloaky camper.
---
Now, either the locals respect your presence (and your job is fufilled), or they keep ratting and ignore you, and when your skills finally finish, you can reap the free kills.
---
I'd say that injecting a cloaky camper is foolish for these reasons.
---
&gt;With deep enough pockets 
---
Due to diminishing returns, I'm assuming **very** deep pockets, though?
---
And Eve needs more of those. No region should have zero NPC stations within jump range.
---
This is truth
---
All i see is a lot of grabbing and not a lot of action.
---
Its looking pretty gay.
---
&gt;Capping out a jag at t=1 for the jags mwd cycle means that the Jag will still travel at retarded speed for another 9 seconds and land that scram on our poor battleship pilot.
---
Not really, right? Can't scram if you're neuted.
---
You are looking at the consequence of plex right there. Max safe krabs are possible because it's trivial to also have an alt in the standing fleet to bail your capital assets anytime, which is trivial specifically because of plex. Injectors only exacerbate a problem that exists without them.
---
I'm not going to analyze why plex or the abyss is not a sink, u/_Shalmon does a good job on that in his response. But my problem isn't noobs flying purple Nestor's or whatever getting blown to smithereens, it's people who understand how broken some mechanic combos can be and use their wallet to gain access to these combos and break the game for everyone.
---
Yes.
---
What does people being afk in esoteria have to do with anything?
---
Euro???
---
\*stands up at work desk &amp; claps\*
---
good job on the dscan but you got some rookie hunters there too :P   
---
What i like to do if they don't disengage immediately is to find out where they come from, put a bubbler on their hole and then scare them off with combat probes :P  
---
9/10 way easier and less messier than if you try to get tackle on top of them on the site - you even get them grouped:)   
---
So, as your first instinct told you - you see something flash on dscan (probes is already too late usually, but still) - it's usually hostile, you mjd immediately, warp to a safe and get ready to bounce around :)
---
Low sec has very few t1 industrials.
---
Maybe camp systems with ice belts to find ninja ice miners
---
But PLEX do not make multiple accounts possible. You could have multiple accounts long before PLEX were available.
---
I started playing 12 years ago today. Within a month I had three accounts. Eve has always encouraged multiple accounts.
---
Pretty sure 13 accounts/person is fake news. I think CCP has said the average is more like 2. Maybe creeping upwards slightly in the past few years. But in 2015 it was 1.5 accounts per player, which is nothing like 13.
---
PLEX just lets people without time kill other people who don't have time who don't have PLEX, and it also lets them not care about losing stuff to people who do have time with or without PLEX. Clearly a P2W situation. 
---
I don't mind testing those items by reediming them on TQ
---
Let me know if you need my help with that CCP
---
I quit the game when I kept losing "friendly" fights in RvB to people who had $40 clones and was told to just buy PLEX when I confronted them about it. 
---
Then Test will surrender so that the war ends within 24 hours of a timer
---
pvp :) It s harder in alpha because of low skill but totally ok :D
---
Then Test would surrender within 24 hours of a timer
---
You'd stick to wh space, hunting explorers, miners or other hunters 
---
If you nees to go cheap a dual rep autocannon Tempest or shield arty MJD Maelstrom both work fine for clearing. A marauder is quite exoensive and it will take a bit making your money back doing L4s even if you take advantage of its salvaging bonuses.
---
I am 1 step ahead, got an adjustable standing desk last week :)
---
Good hunting in low-sec are people in exploration frigates. You can scan down the sigs in a system, then move farther down the pipe scanning everything. Then fly back up the pipe and see if you can catch anyone in the pre-scanned sigs. The downside being that one of you has to fit a probe launcher, and probably fly a scanning bonused ship. Alternatively you could reship for the second half of the "roam"
---
I wanna know what's going on here?
---
Careful, the verbal contortions you are using are Olympic level acrobatics. They might hurt you unless you are specifically trained in shit shoveling.
---
how do i get them
---
oh god, there's a new monocle
---
Working as intended and a lot of butthurt is what I am reading.
---
Thats not how surrenders work lol.
---
He has much better scanning and I much better combat so he will be scanner and tackle and I'm DPS.
---
If Horde and tapi were directly at war tapi would surrender so that the war is on cooldown during the timer. This is why everyone uses third party corps for structures 
---
In your logic these are all bots, but yeah, I guess logic is not a thing for you, so cheers.
---
When we find them, stopping people actively jumping is difficult. Would the best bet be having a fast ship on gate to bump and tackle?
---
The REEEEE is strong with this one.
---
Any tips on WH hunting for 2?
---
Probably could have taken them if they were used in this case, too. 
---
But how do you know which hole?
---
Yup.
---
That was from the CCP presentation a week or two back, think it was the same post that talked about the new implants and the new trig ships. I'll see if I can find it and link it. Not sure if CCP is bullshitting us, though I doubt it in this case.
---
Jump through and check structures or just bubble everything.
---
They are just getting ready for the inevitable consequences of keeping the current chat system... in about a year or so those will come in handy.
---
Well there's also the factor of those who enjoy the PvE aspects, be it going nuts in a C5 farmhole or multiboxing incursions (I'm guilty of the latter, but not enough to run a solo fleet)
---
Are you guys both newer accounts? Sometimes the scanner can be a Strat if going big, or an astero if going small. And the backup combat could be like a combat recon or something, remember choose your engagements! 
---
Not if you're the declaring party I don't think.
---
Abyss is an item sink. It deflated stockpiles of rare loot, thus maintaining the value of ded sites. The main isk sinks in the game are lp, and manufacturing t2+stuff/bpo research. 
---
#👀
---
Honestly, how is this worse than POS spam? Other than people can actually dock in these? 
---
lmao [no u](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/941683695168622163/566EBC940703D5952609A94DD193B8398FF7822F/) lmao
---
&gt;Then Test will surrender so that the war ends within 24 hours of a timer
---
But you dont have to accept their surrender offer, right?
---
Bring a cloak
---
u/CCP_Falcon what you boys are planning on doing with these? 👀
---
Since I'm in dialogue with a current player, can you give me your view on the state of the game right now? I dunno if I wanna play, main reason is it's friggin expansive since you need several accounts to explore more than 1 aspect of the game.
---
That's exactly it, actually. It sucks for us to fly around and dec all these alt corps in an attempt to maintain market superiority, but it's the cost we pay. It's totally acceptable for them to make it difficult for us, but after all of the fuckery they've pulled with abusing wardec mechanics (mostly being the defender in a war against us, joining an alliance that is the aggressor against us, and then leaving, effectively swapping to the aggressor and cancelling the war when it's convenient for their timers), you can't blame us for choosing to renew a war at our discretion. They can pull the azbels into Horde and eliminate the issue, or they can be on the wrong side of a wardec mechanic for once.
---
If you're declaring the war you can't surrender. You can end your wardec but only defenders can offer a surrender.
---
So someone spends cash to inject a toon, fit a shiny boat with a bling fit and undock... only to end up as a dank killmail for some other player who has taken the time to learn how to play. And CCP gets paid to make more video game to boot. 
---
I don't see a problem with this.
---
Some of us vets remember a time when the biggest ship was  tech1 battleship... when time had meaning and owning a bad ass ship had prestige. Something needs to change the game's current direction drastically. What do you suggest?
---
Ah forgive me, I was mixing up the two, my own knowledge on this is clearly limited.
---
In any event it will trigger a 24 hour period end to the war, which has the same effect.
---
[:thinking:](https://gph.is/1gnTOy5)
---
I've set cspa charge to max on my hunter alt when I was actively hunting, made like 10mil ISK from mad krabs. Good times
---
Are data/relic sites (no rats) in C4-6 wormholes or only C1-3?
---
Pretty cool. Clean it up some and it would be one heck of a r/sbubby . 
---
To put it in more simple terms: every isk you pay to NPCs is a sink.
---
I would add NPC office fees, unclaimed insurance, skill books and blueprint originals to the main sinks as well.
---
Running DED gives you a nice bounty as well bt, so more isk in the game :)
---
Man with that character name I'd try to kill you every time I saw you too.
---
Congrats on the achievement though!
---
Yes, multiple accounts were promoted from the start. But you and I both know that this wasn't mainstream until way after plex. I've been in the game for 9 years, I know that back then people like you were the stuff of legend, like cap pilots. Wormholes were held by corps, not individuals. Standing fleets were almost nonexistent because people had to choose, do I want to make some isk or do I want to shoot things? And I've clarified what I meant, plex doesn't make multiple accounts possible, but it makes them a hell of a lot easier to acquire.
---
you might have noticed that talks about the elite top players not the average. 
---
Tremendous post.
---
Learn to read or think before posting. Of course he has a scram already, but he uses the third mid for a cap booster to have a tank incursus so he doesn’t have a web. Anyone with scram web (90% of his opponents that are not straight up kiters) and a brain will be able to disengage within 10 seconds.
---
If he can't follow a simple bookmark structure hes the retarded one. 
---
Like i've switched Bookmark systems and really disliked the new system but i've still fucking done it. 
---
I complained about it, but still did it. 
---
Yes. And they are 1000km from each other. You're looking at a zoomed-out view. It took me a while to drop them all.
---
Something that shakes up the space we already have. I too played when caps were like magical unicorns, I loved it. But we need the game to stop becoming a cookie clicker with spaceships, and space that emulates fw won't help with that.
---
check eveonline streamers on youtube, they also running Abbys and you could have more hints about fits and how to select it properly. And yes, they are also dying there.
---
V
---
Well I had to match you in saying something equally as stupid as claiming that I have had more than one asblops loss. 
---
Just wait for when whatever alliance you are in stops joining your fleets once again, because you are a rage filled, condescending cucklord of an FC. Just like when you were in NC. , PL, BL, and AAA. 
---
P.S.

should be a bug, click again pls it'll work
---
Ah, its you guys. Gz for getting away for once :P
---
nullsec data/relic sites in C1-3 only
---
What? I think you still don't understand how wars work.
---
If horde declares war on test and pay their bill every week their war will continue until either: 
---
- horde stops paying the bill
---
- the servers shut down
---
- TEST has 0 structures in space anywhere in eve.
---
At no point is TEST asked how they feel about the war or given any say in whether it should end or not.
---
Oh shit Goons lost several billions worth of stuff
---
How will they ever recover
---
Hello,
---
Annoying genZ fortnite kid checking in with you. In the past 4 months after downloading eve it has become the only game I play. It is the most fun and challenging game I've played and a plus side is that it also has a great community. I think eve isn't appealing to all kids, but enough kids since its a niche game anyway. Ty for reading
---
i remember friends and family play games like empire earth, gta 2, civ 2, blobby volley, age of empires 1 + 2 (playing 2 myself still), starcraft brood war like it's yesterday.
---
Ha, plot twist boys... This is the new addition to the upcoming cash shop :)))
---
We are moving from Spodzilla to Skillzilla?
---
If you actually knew how to do a BR you'd see goons lost 130m. Darkness lost 5b.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=2433&amp;b=8548600&amp;e=110&amp;t=b
---
Almost certainly SP purchase.  What else.
---
Well I guess the war is over. Time to go home. They’ve lost way too much isk. 10b total  loss battles are starting to happen. Totally unsustainable and worth posting about.
---
Press V to save you live
---
I’m a newbie but doesn’t a bubble just prevent warping out? So if I warp to the hole at 0 I could still make it through, no?
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=2433&amp;b=8548600&amp;e=110&amp;t=H
---
Only C1-C3
---
I'm talking entire systems and constellations. Jump gates that only allow certain hull types. I think it's a start. We need new space and we better be careful how we implement it. Along with a list of other changes, including removing Plex for game time and all pilot services like skill injectors. 
---
Oh noo, what are they going to do now? Seems like they’ll have to disband...
---
Actually, according to CCP the game is bringing in thousands of new players all the time. The issue is retention, and this has always been the case. It's kind of a survival of the fittest thing- only people with a pretty deep sense of curiosity, patience and appreciation for complex/deep mechanics are going to be naturally inclined to play EVE. That's a small % of the total population, so it makes sense that retention is low. It's not a generational thing either- EVE has never had mass appeal.
---
Ironically, the gaming industry is in such a state of disarray right now (look at recent releases like Anthem, Fallout, Metro, etc.) that EVE is actually looking like a breath of fresh air for a lot of gamers. I recently came back to the game after a couple years of low activity because to be quite honest, the gaming industry has completely lost its touch. A game like EVE will probably never, ever be made again. Look at EA's business model: they only give resources and time to studios that are expected to make big returns (games like FIFA and anything else with huge monetization streams (games as a service)). A game as mechanically deep as EVE is so, so, so far away from any developer or publishers (and more importantly, investors) vision of the gaming industry. Games that get made today by big developers are essentially all cookie-cutter remakes of games that have been played a thousand times before. Anthem is probably the most glaring, uninspired heap of rushed-out-the-door trash in a long time- and that's a game that was made by Bioware. If you read [Jason Schreier's account of Anthem's development](https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964) you can see everything that's wrong with the industry: lack of direction, poor management, lack of resources for innovation, reliance on pre-existing tech and no willingness to innovate. His article puts a lot of focus on the management or corporate issues, but really what I what read throughout the article was a total lack of vision. They wanted to make a ripoff of Warframe or Destiny without actually coming out and saying it (he even mentions in the article that they were discouraged from even talking about Destiny). So you get this tension from some devs who want to do something new and other devs who want to steer the game into a cookie-cutter loot shooter- and neither side can resolve that struggle until the dreaded "crunch time" and the game has to be forced out the door because EA set a hard deadline.
---
EA and every other big developer wants to pump out these cookie-cutter games because its safe and easy to sell to investors. Naturally, most of these companies who are publicly traded become addicted to their stock returns. And what investors want to see is this: instant gratification, easy monetization, feel-good, safe, all-ages friendly, lowest common denominator games. Take a game genre (loot shooter, COD, BR, etc.) copy its best elements and try to iterate on it. That's the safe investment. A game like EVE, where kills and deaths have real consequences and mechanics are deep and punishing- a sandbox game where players actually control the  game environment to an extent- that is sooooo far from anywhere these developers are thinking. 
---
TLDR: gaming industry is in a zombie state right now and games like EVE are always going to continue to attract new players because it is so far from the current industry trends of instant gratification and cookie-cutter designs.
---
They were not AFK. They would all instantly pull their drones the moment a red showed up on grid. Then they would instantly put their drones back out the moment there was no red on grid and they'd do this over and over even as they were losing excavators, replacing each lost excavator with a mining II drone.
---
I believe that implication is stupid as shit
---
I don't doubt that you saw it. I doubt that you know what you're talking about.
---
If you're in an older generation, you're embarassing yourself by lumping all Gen Z/millenials together.
---
If you're in one of the generations you described, you're even more of a tool.

About as much as it does for Frat in Detorid
---
This is pretty much the FLEX structure "Forward Operating Base" they teased, is it not? Although as a flex structure it would have 1 ref cycle if powered.
---
TDF is still very active, we get HQ's up every day. Currently Armor is actually the best, shields simply cannot compete with the Leshak and the Nestor. 
---
The WTM Leshak fit is really funny because they actually tried to shield fit a Leshak. We put down way too much dps per boat and get 2 logi boats in 1 with the nestor. 
---
You can't realistically expect EVE to last forever.
---
Alright, you made me watch the presentation and it does indeed concern these incredibly nebulously defned "elite players". However, looking at my personal experience over 9 years, 4 of which was me actively playing in every kind of space besides lowsec, I can say with certainty that the average player now has at least 5 accounts, and 10 doesn't even sound that absurd to me.
---
How is direct SP purchase any different than the millions of skillfarms that are direct skill purchase by proxy through extractors? I mean - how is it different?
---
That's because this story is what, 2 weeks old?
---
The state of the game is fine. Do not be greedy with Eve. Do not spread yourself too thin. It’s a huge universe. Even after twelve years, there are still huge parts I have not even touched. Don’t try to eat the whole smorgasbord at once. Taste a few things and gorge yourself sick on what you like. Once you are sick of something, move on to another thing. Remember that there are many viable paths in Eve. There are people who have played in high security space for 16 years and are still happy there. 
---
A focused character can compete with a veteran on a pure SP basis fairly quickly. I can fly vastly more ships than a new player, but once you get the core skills done, we are on the same playing field in terms of SP. I will still have advantages from knowledge of game mechanics, but once again, a focused player can learn those as well.
---
Everything in Eve is easier with more characters, but only if they can work together. You can play Eve as a single account, it simply requires joining a corporation and working with other people. Or playing Eve on Very Hard mode (like Stitch K).
---
If I started Eve now... I would start my main account and subscribe it from Day 1. I would also start an alt or two as Alpha accounts. I would actively play on my main in Faction Warfare, High Sec, exploration, or a new player friendly 0.0 corporation. Whichever one I thought sounded like the most fun. On my main, I would focus one training up to Cruisers for a given race and core skills. Never fly what you cannot afford to lose. I would train only core skills on the two alphas until they got to 5m SP. (which should take about six months). At that point, I would assume I have enough experience to begin shaping my Alpha accounts into characters who complement my main’s play style.

Grab the pitchforks
---
Why don't you shut the fuck up
---
I remember gas factory, you guys aren't ninjaing gas in null no more or? 
---
And why not. We didn't fight injectors and direct SP sales are a natural follow on. The time to fight this was 3 years ago but people wanted the quick and easy path so here we are.
---
Pick 3-4 connected Systems that you want to actively hunt (if you are truly set with Lowsec) Scan down ALL the sigs in these systems and BM them. Since you are a newer players, use a separate ship designed for scanning only to make this less of a nightmare to fit it onto your PVP ships.  Also if you dont restart your client, the sigs will remain in the ALT+P menu, which is handy for identifying new sigs.  
---
Roam around these connected systems and look for ships out of place, a heron, an Astero, maybe even a rattlesnake (in the odd case of someone running a site) cloaky miners, etc. Use D-scan to estimate if they are possible at one of these sites. If so, warp, tackle, repeat.   
---
Given this is a VERY simplified way to get started, but from here you can expand to checking out some of the WH sigs you have scanned, maybe start flying cloaky ships, the list goes on.  
---
The truth is it will vary from area to area, day to day. Sometimes you get dumb luck and find an Orca (that is not bait) some days, you get 1 heron kill, some days a WH corp decides to invade your area and kill you, that's Eve. Just keep evolving your strategy to fit the area and the action/lack-of at the time.  
---
Good-luck, and happy hunting! o7
---
Yes officer, this is the guy
---
That expansion was literally a joke though..
---
You didn't really look, did you?
---
geddons and bhaals are such fun-stoppers:(
---
Star Citizen is as "playable" as it is ever going to be: you can fork over cash, and C.I.(lack of)G. has absolutely no fucks to give about anything else.
---
Where to buy these friend ships?  About how much to they cost anf what are their fitting layouts?
---
Will you eat hot wings on stream too?
---
true but I was specifically thinking Judgement day, It's true that it was largely undefended but that region got basically completely toasted in one cycle, sans a couple items that got missed due to spreadsheet fuckups.
---
You are pretty much talking out of your ass without knowing the game mechanics.
---
some probes are also usefull
---
I think you're the one misunderstanding now.
---
Putting a war between TAPI and Horde isn't the subject of discussion, and it's largely irrelevant (though yes the mechanic for unilaterally ending the war is as we discussed above in the thread).
---
In practice, TAPI uses Perimeter Police Enforcement/Patrol/Department corp whatever its called this week for the bashing, and hops characters between them declaring war on the structure owners only. The structures are not owned by Horde, who agree to come in to assist the owning corporation.
---
Pulling the plug on the TAPI/Horde war doesn't stop the structure still being hit if a new vehicle has already been set up for those alts to redeclare war in.
---
The problem is assist (like many other facets of highsec war) is kind of broken. A solution would be to have the structures to be defended in Horde (this is what TAPI ended up doing when they fumbled the timer previously and managed to get their Keepstar reinforced uncontested because they couldn't shoot at the aggressors). It doesn't really work for Horde though given they are actually assisting other parties with their wars, and (most of them) aren't their structures.
---
Hope that clarifies it a bit now.
---
There's definitely skills that should be eliminated. A skill should unlock some new module or ship and feel rewarding when you get it. Most skills in Eve are a small % increase and feel almost meaningless. Fitting skills absolutely should go, they take like a full year to max out and just miserable. 
---
I've never liked the skill system in Eve. There isn't a good way for new players to catch up like there is in other games where your friends can power level you and you can play with them at their level. You only get 2 skill injectors for $20 of PLEX so you would have to spend thousands of dollars to catch up which is BS. I'm sure it's a massive turn-off for prospective players.
---
Yes the game has mission system for PVE, exploration sites, DED complexes, plain old vanilla belt ratting etc.  If you stay in high security systems for a while you will be more or less immune from pvp unless you join a corp that is at war.
---
However, more or less immune is not the same thing as *exempt* from pvp.  You are same from low security pvp squads, yes.  If you run your mouth, fly super blinged out ships, afk travel with expensive cargoes, or just generally make a nuisance of yourself, then people can and will sacrifice their own ships to law enforcement in order to blow up your space pixels.
---
#eveforever?
---
While it's possible that you're not far from the truth (with an average of 4-5) - I want to point out that the majority of the newbean corps are comprised of people owning a single account which drags the average down for sure.   
---
If you add the alphas in, that would drag it even lower.

Look, you're very clearly offput by what I typed. That wasn't my intention, but it seems the joke was instead right on the money. Now if you could go after systems that aren't minimum ADM, that would be great. 
---
But it doesn’t make it any easier. Multiple accounts simply required multiple subscriptions. 
---
I made the mistake of using PLEX for my accounts for about six months out of my twelve years in Eve. It turned Eve into a poorly paying job. I ended up burning through billions of ISK in savings because logging in just to grind ISK to keep playing to grind more ISK to keep playing was awful. Now, every December I make the decision to re-subscribe my accounts for the year. I play Eve whenever it seems like a fun thing to do.
---
The “Eve is free if you PLEX your account” mindset is as dumb as the “the minerals I mine myself are free” and worse by far for Eve. It burns people out doing horrible tasks. 
---
Spend the $130 per year and play Eve the way you want with some limitations. Or, $260 per year and have the entire universe open to you.
---
&gt; I can say with certainty
---
That you're talking out of your ass.
---
well done. Needless to say that Core Probes are never harmless.  Combat scanning 2 Battleships is so fast that I am really impressed you got away.  If they had a Sabre, you'd be in trouble... 
---
I always press v before opening Reddit at work
---
&gt;Not to make a “Get off my lawn” post
---
And then proceeds to do just that
---
Servers moving to North America.
---
u seem really upset. are u ok?
---
Maybe it's not direct SP purchase-related. Maybe CCP is just getting ready for the next catastrophic failure of the chat system or some other in-game functionality. Have a little faith guys. 
---
Guys?? 
---
You need omega accounts and create characters and invest in implants to milk as much SP from them and then buy skill extractors and turn them into skill injectors.
---
This takes some effort, dedication and time from the one(player) doing it.
---
Now you are telling me you can/will acquire SP by simply swiping a credit card?
---
I\`m sorry but that\`s just fucked up.  
---
Man I would love to but I've been unsubed for a while and I double I'd have enough time to dedicate. But keep going, because that kind of experience is just thrilling. 
---
I pointed these out the other day they popped up on april fools. 
---
Good point, I always forget about the stratios as an option for a scanning ship.
---
The least enjoyable time in the past twelve years of Eve was the six months I spent using PLEX for my accounts. PLEXing your account is not free. For most players, it is a horrible waste of time and a sure fire way to make people hate Eve. I could mow my neighbor’s lawn for an hour and make more than I would grinding ISK.
---
I don't think it's a crazy idea that the bot takes local and intel channels into account and doesn't dock up for a few reds in the local. If I imagine myself programming a bot I think I would include an option to ignore a few reds passing by in case they're just explorers or whatever. If that's an option then it's easy to imagine someone using it, intentionally or not.
---
Please give me your reasoning why it's "stupid as shit".
---
God you might have to get a life now! I'd be panicking too bud.
---
1M SP? what kind of catastrophic thing do they expect? Their hosting center burning down and no EVE for us for 1 month? :O
---
Lmao, this has to be a late April Fool's.
---
Player swipes credit card to make omega account. Swipes credit card to buy extractors. Sells extractors. You right.. much different from swiping credit card to buy injection.
---
dam son since your whole reddit persona is based on white knighting and defending ccp actions (that are usually harmful to the community) at every step, are you unironically a falcon alt?

dam son since your whole reddit persona is based on going out of your way to shit on ccp for things you think they might do at every step, are you unironically a gevlon alt?

The only thing you do here is undermine the credibility of actual bot posts for cheap wanna be propaganda bullshit.
---
Fun thing I didnt even have to click the link to know it would be test. 
---
V is you’re pulse in all space forget to check it and you could be dead in the next few seconds
---
Remove plexing - that will sort most of the things out (and probably sift the playerbase a bit) 
---
I found RAZOR!
---
Plus wormholes love content, even if it’s not a ratting ship. 
---
They are not going anywhere with that +800mil pod though.
---
What's your explanation for a group of about 8 rorquals that all synchronously pull their drones when an enemy is on grid, then all synchronously put their drones back out when the enemy isn't on grid and keep doing it even as they lose their excavators over 4 seperate bombing runs, the last of which was after a lenghty skirmish with two stilettos?
---
It's not. It's not functionally different from buying PLEX for money and then buying injectors with PLEX. It's merely a QOL improvement at this point.
---
OTOH It does ruin game play in unintended ways - if you don't work for something you don't value it.
---
if it's deployed at your destination (short version) before you initiated warp, you will be stopped at the edge of the bubble not at your destination.   
---
And even if you managed to warp before and land at 0, the dictor will jump and bubble on the other side too. 
---
The way I look at it, if I ever hit the point where I have spare ISK to buy plex to cover a month, great, I'll buy some plex and use it for a month.
---
If not, I'll use cash and be fine with it.
---
They will get back to you in about a year
---
even ccp will have to shut down the servers once the heat-death of the universe occurs 
---
How is it different from current skill injections in regards to ruining the game?
---
Not sure if my IQ is high enough to laugh at this.
---
It certainly is. Just goes to show that one decent insight will carry you through a whole career.
---
Time to fight was when GTCs became sellable for ISK.
---
mtu kill says they were in a c3 - the tinker domi (i assume it's not a shield rr) can handle c3 signature sites (the scannable ones).   
---
Or maybe, since they were in the third wave - the anom marker was gone (since it goes away at the beginning of the last wave).   
---
Last possibility ofc is the hunters were green
---
&gt; If I imagine myself programming a bot I think I would include an option to ignore a few reds passing by in case they're just explorers or whatever
---
no bot works this way. they have a whitelist of neutrals that they don't dock/pull for. The cost to pull excavs when neuts come in local is extremely low. The typical pattern for bots is to "reset" to a safe state when someone enters local and only resume once local is clear for a sufficient amount of time. 
---
You're not thinking like a software developer. You have two options - weigh the cost and benefit.
---
1) Create a feature that scans three channels (local, intel channels, and the overview) for neutrals with hierarchical logic for determining exactly when to safe up and when to keep mining based on what is reported in intel, what is present in local, and what is on grid
---
2) Safe up whenever neutrals/hostiles come in local
---
The first option has _many_ failure states. What about logoff traps? In your condition no gang is reported nearby, therefore there's a good chance the bot just straight up dies. Wormholes? Same thing. Blue lighting a covert cyno? Same thing. It's stupid as shit. Bots safe up when neutrals enter local. 
---
i can because hilmar said EVE Forever is a thing. checkmate, beeman.
---
What if we can escape the heat-death of the universe through a black hole and go into another universe, does CCP have a gameplan to expand to such a new lucrative market?
---
I’d much rather see Eve 2 than play star citizen.. 
---
Star Citizen is going to be the the DayZ of space games, in case you didn’t know DayZ was in alpha for about 6-7 years and just recently they finalized everything and it’s still fucking shit.
---
That’s just my opinion tho.
---
You guys just jelly because they are not in their system so shut the fuck up
---
I appreciate this. 
---
My apologies, Sir!
---
Better have an infinite source of SP where all you have to do is Swipe a card and boom, instant ratting carrier or rorq with a fixed price from CCP rather than depend on a stock created by players where people regulate the price, supply/demand all that.
---
I have seen the error of my thinking.
---
It doesn't make the sp farming eve nerds fat and wealthy.
---
Adversity 
---
What's the diameter of the PvP abyssal arena?
---
You do understand what anecdotal evidence is, don't you? It's the same "evidence" that anti-vaxxers use to say that vaccines are bad - aka, valueless.
---
Unless you've got some way of actually viewing the IP address used to log into every active Eve account, you know, like CCP do.
---
Insignificant story? Well sure... but a fantastic lesson on how useful Dscan is. So many folks just ignore it and pay for it. Well done
---
Do you believe we don't already have an infinite source of SP right now with skill farms?
---
Oh, that would be a real shame wouldn't it?
---
Could it be the 2m sisi SP everyone’s getting who participated in the test yesterday? 
---
Skill trading in EVE was  a mistake, change my mind.
---
Keep at it, my dude. 
---
The first option has many failures, which you can remedy with a well written config file that each bot user can modify to suit their needs perfectly. If a config file allows for bots to not safe up when neutrals enter the system (not that they can in industrial core anyway) and keep the drones out until enemies are on grid, then it's not outlandish that someone would use it that way. It doesn't have to be the developer coding the logic in, it can be the user or the botting community itself.
---
You say it's unlikely the bot doesn't hide its excavators when neutral enters local, I say it's more unlikely a real person will resume mining after a bombing run because they lack object permanence and think that since they can't see the bombers anymore they don't exist.
---
Oh wait, I know the answer to this one. Hold on, let me go and find it...[here it is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/atig63/fraternity_just_lost_100_mining_barges_to_a_5_man/eh1q9n1/)
---
my explanation is that input broadcasting, botting, and cheating are rampant, and no one gives a shit unless their enemy is doing it. Your claim was that these players were botting - that's stupid as shit. Input broadcasting is much easier to buy. But you didn't make that claim. Because you have no idea what you're talking about, and like the rest of /r/eve you see players in a Chinese alliance and scream BOTS out of pure reflex
---
I would absolutely stay and rebuild my old alliance. LEX forever!
---
Obviously a low sec pleb response.
---
I recommend you start by joining a C2-4 corp first.  Generally those use subcaps for sites and PvP.  
---
* Site running is hit/miss. Generally the home hole of an active corp is farmed out casually but dedicated PvE nights chain roll their neighbors for opportunity to run sites in the static.  A C2 with a static C4 for example is pretty sweet.  
---
* WH income can increased by PI.  In general, the POCOS are owned by the corp and cheap/free.  The corps may even have a purchase program for fuel etc, so no need to haul.  Its quite good, afk, nearly risk-free ISK. 
---
* Mining:  I have no idea.  I think moon mining is a real thing now but I have never done it.  
---
* Hacking / Analyzing.  Can be really good ISK.  Needs good skills / implants or it gets frustrating.  
---
So, how to find a good WH corp?  In my very biased view, take one that has an active killboard in your time zone with a good mix of red/green.  You can see fleet compositions (2-20 is fun), what kind of ships they are flying and whether they frequently have their own industrials blown up (thats a bad sign).  Other than that, don't be too keen on joining the "biggest" corp, you'd just be a F1 monkey again, may as well stay in NS.  Medium-size, active corps are much more fun.  
---
As for skills, everything "Astrometrics" needs to be 4 or 5.  Solid frigate skills, all the usual armor / shield skills maxed or near max.  Scanning &gt;&gt; Tank &gt; DPS.  Low class WHs tend to fly cruisers a lot these days.  Including T3Cs.  As usual, if you can't fly a fleet doctrine ship, don't "improvise" without FC knowing about it.  Unlike in NS, every pilot in a fleet matters.  If its a T3C fleet and you can't fly it, you'd be very valued scout / tackle / logi whatever.  Just don't show up with a Drake in an Armor T3C fleet (unless you have been volunteered as "bait"). 
---
Don't be shy to ask. WH life has its own weird rules and procedures and people generally fall over themselves to help a newer member.  
---
*Source.  Low Class WHer since 2011.  PM me if you want more info.  I also write* [a Blog](https://splatus.wordpress.com/)*about WH life (remember those? They were a thing before Reddit)* 
---
&gt; You say it's unlikely the bot doesn't hide its excavators when neutral enters local, I say it's more unlikely a real person will resume mining after a bombing run because they lack object permanence and think that since they can't see the bombers anymore they don't exist.
---
yeah well and yet [here we are](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b8w06y/fraternity_another_one_of_your_bots_broke/ek0k8ec/). People can be really fucking dumb. They can also be [really fucking AFK.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aaq19n/goons_lose_43_excavators_in_40_minutes/) You're spinning a very complicated tale involving bots that don't exist and are written completely differently than existing bots in order to explain away something very simple - most players are very bad at this game.
---
Id bitter vet reddit for years but continue to play lol
---
If you want quick action, go run abyssal sites.
---
I hunt Fraternity all over detorid, most of them act pretty normal and are also the most chatty people in local I've ever come across. However this is the only time I've ever seen a hostile rorqual fleet synchronously put their drones back out to mine within minutes of being bombed, not just once but three times in a row.  These were not AFK, they pulled them and put them back out again each time.
---
It wouldnt change shit, 2 years and its at exactly the same point as now.
---
Well if i still would have my SKINs and my ~10k PLEX(or get money for from ccp) i would continue for sure.. Hell i would be even more hyped again :D
---
You should never get to that point. That’s all ISK you could spend having fun in game. PLEXIng does not make Eve more fun, so I won’t spend my time on it.
---
My self-imposed rule is that I only spend RL money on subscriptions or character training. That keeps my hobby within my entertainment budget. 
---
I prefer to earn all ships and items by playing the game. This gives me some purpose in this otherwise pointless game. It is what helps fuel the sense of meaningful loss that keeps me coming back to Eve.
---
you'd pretty much have to mine
---
like, even more of a requirement than right now
---
also oh god the PI, you'd have to either defend NPC customs offices with your life until you got enough P4s to build a POCO
---
Honestly I don't care to distinguish which exact software he's using. My theory is that he made a simple script to make all the rorquals start and stop mining and it malfunctioned on him. We bombed him again today and he appears to have fixed it to make them switch to mining IIs.
---
You little debbie downer. Doom and gloom lol.
---
Cheer up dude.
---
Yes, you need several accounts to explore everything, but as you get three characters per account, so long as you stagger them, you can cover three things per account. I've got an account with a miner, a ratter and a hauler on it that train in stages. I trained the miner up to a barge, then set the hauler training. Once I had a reasonably viable hauling ship, I started training up the ratter. Then I trained the miner up to an exhumer, then the hauler to a blockade runner, and right now I'm training the ratter up to some more potent combat ships.
---
I also give my alts a secondary role. My miner also has some limited hauling skills. My hauler also does refining and manufacture, my ratter also has exploration skills. So I'm basically covering 5 things on 3 alts.
---
I'd still play and it would definitely be interesting, but this would just destroy the newer players and smaller corps/alliances who dont have the infrastructure of mega null blobs. The blobs would just conquer all of eve and hold it with an even tighter fist than beforehand.
---
Depends. Would Sarum Prime be lowsec again?
---
At first I was a bot, I was minified  
---
Kept thinking I could never login without a bot by my side  
---
But then I spent so many nights thinking how to script along  
---
And my bot grew strong  
---
And I learned how to get headstrong  
---
And so you're back  
---
From wormhole space  
---
I just logged in to find you here with that bot look upon your face  
---
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your auth key  
---
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to botter me  
---
Go on now, go, walk out the door  
---
Just turn around now  
---
'Cause you're not welcome anymore  
---
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with downtime  
---
Do you think I'd crumble  
---
Did you think I'd bot down and die?
---
Oh no, not I, I will survive  
---
Oh, as long as I know how to bot, I know I'll stay alive  
---
I've got all my life to live  
---
And I've got all my bot to give and I'll survive  
---
I will survive, hey, hey
---
Currently seeding hundreds of posting alts.
---
Maybe they have them ready for when they switch the server over to the new engine that we just tested for them.  I know it will work out but it could be bumpy to start.
---
Lol you were actually paying attention and you saw the results. I'd have personally gtfo immediately the first time I saw probes, but this is still good. Living in a wh makes it much easier to control the territory. But yea good job :)
---
Yea ccp is to blame that horde was allowed to cheat and didn’t suffer consequences. We agree there.
---
AFK rorquals don't pull their drones when hostiles are on grid and put them back out again however.
---
you're still allowed to say fucking, sweetie
---
finally! PA showing its true colors, just had to wait 7 months for it /s
---
Maybe if they randomized the systems and regions.
---
A fast locking tornado (or similar gank ship) maybe. It will need to tank the gate guns for some time.
---
If they aren't in range of npc guns, put tackle modules on a mining or industrial ship so you are much less suspicious, get close and apply tackle. Jump in system with dps and warp to tackle.
---
It was amazing before they did the first big balance pass on the carriers/fighters where they changed the way the camera worked. Now its pretty shit for us. The new cam is cool, i just wish they would add the old functionality to it. 
---
&gt;50m
---
YIKES! You are correct. I meant to say "per account per day" and I have edited it to say that. Not sure how I didn't catch that...
---
I'm literally not spinning anything, I read a story about a rorqual that would resume mining whenever bombers would cloak and I used my limited but above average knowledge of programming to figure out that a bot that behaves this way could very easily exist, while a player behaving this way is incredibly unlikely.
---
Your examples are beautiful, but in neither case did the rorqual resume mining once the hostiles cloak, and stop when they uncloak. This is several levels above someone starting to mine after being dropped, it is unrelated to people losing 40 excavators, and it literally can't happen to an afker.
---
So was it an accident or did you abuse the loophole? You're kinda claiming both in the same comment chump.
---
Shhhh, you're gonna get us banned. According to TAPI that's "exploiting loopholes"
---
Then even less people will run these horrible dev resource hogs.
---
&gt; My theory is that he made a simple script to make all the rorquals start and stop mining and it malfunctioned on him. We bombed him again today and he appears to have fixed it to make them switch to mining IIs.
---
Your theory is wrong and stupid, and you _only have that theory because he's in a Chinese alliance._ Sorry, you have exactly zero evidence that this guy is botting. I have no doubt that there are botters in Frat. I have no doubt that many pilots in Frat are input broadcasting. I also have no doubt that every alliance is chock full of botters and input broadcasters (TEST being a bit of an exception; you really only tolerate obvious botting in your pets &amp; renters). 
---
You can talk about "writing a simple script" all you want, all it does is reveal that you have absolutely no idea what goes into writing software like this, or how bots in eve online work. I know that you think you're making a really clever point, but to anyone who actually knows what they are talking about, it is extremely obvious that you do not. 
---
No, T3 are cheaper because they're far more common than T4.
---
My point is, you basically cannot cheat with that exploit, except if CCP fucked something up big time.
---
yeah because someone with skill can shit on someone without skill. don't mind that this comparison lacks in every regards possible.
---
peOpLe fEeD eXpEnSiVe sHiT alL tHe TiMe
---
Maybe if they got rid of Skill Injectors and promise never ever to implement such a game-wrecker mechanic I would do it, and only because it would be fun to shoot everyone knowing that at least for some time noone would be able to drop shit on you.
---
But being serious, the only thing they would achieve by doing a reset of the servers is losing a really big part of their playerbase (which is pretty small as it is).
---
Of course its a real painting!
---
I have to say it; this is a terrible narrative push by Steady.
---
Horde along with ICY have been exploiting the wardec stuff since TAPI took control of the market. ICY even admitted to using and having more "unknown loopholes" on a TIS podcast.
---
This doesn't excuse the latest move (if it's in fact an exploit), but post like Steady's just mock the intelligence of the average bean and reduce the quality of discourse for us all.
---
This whole "gud fites" narrative is cringy and to be frank; I'm getting sick of the depth people will go to rally the troops, perhaps I'm just getting old and sick of this game.
---
those are far and between. whats much more common are the people with more money AND sense.
---
The chinese literally did that by escaping to TQ from Serenity
---
what if both opponents skills are at the same level? money still don't matter mmmh?
---
I mean, it still doesn't work properly over a year later, so...
---
Even though I just started recently this would still put me off the game, so I can only imagine how the vets would feel.
---
People have invested money and time into this game and having it go all to waste is not a very pleasant experience imo. Imagine, you spent months to train up to a titan then you finally made enough isk to afford one, then *poof* all gone in the blink of an eye, not that some tard wouldn’t drop it in the middle of nowhere and have it disappear anyway, lmao.
---
&gt;You should never get to that point. That’s all ISK you could spend having fun in game. PLEXIng does not make Eve more fun, so I won’t spend my time on it.
---
To each their own.
---
TBH, for me, it's entirely hypothetical at the moment. I'm still working in the \~100m ISK, "god I hope I don't lose my destroyer" range, not the "I have 2b ISK spare" range. and TBH, I'd be more likely to use that plex to get the extra training queues, not the time.
---
Yep. I'd be into a wormhole on day 1.
---
Unironically. It's not only about good innitial conditions. PROPER constant maintenance from CCPs side would be missing aaaand we would be back to where we are now
---
Given their history and their current owner, it's more likely they will than they won't TBH.
---
Pssshhhh good thing I’ve never done this... nope... not me..... not once...... 
---
&gt; I used my limited but above average knowledge of programming to figure out that a bot that behaves this way could very easily exist,
---
Anything could very easily exist. It doesn't exist that way, but don't let that stop you - by that logic you could argue since software _could_ exist that supports any behavior, everyone in eve is a bot. After all - it _could_ exist. 
---
Players behave this way _all the fucking time._ They gate jump freighters. They aggress at 0 on the undock. They fly blinged out Vindicators with officer mods through highsec to the next incursion system. People in this game are often incredibly stupid. Why is it somehow more parsimonious to explain stupid behavior away as botting? Or is it just because they are Chinese?
---
We (whsoc, violence is the answer) have gotten so many players from the nullblocs lately its insane. Was just having a convo last night with a bittervet thats been playing over a decade, all in null. He said hes been having more fun in the past 2 weeks with us than in the past 10 years in null.
---
If you get in a decent group that share similar values with you, have the logistics figured out and are there to have fun, wormhole space is infinitely more enjoyable than nullsec. You actually matter, as a pilot. Your structures matter. Your assets matter. Shit actually means something. And the fights are important. Its not a whelping 500 moas to a boson. Theres no hotdrops. You're flying more fun, pricier, more capable ships in fights where a single pilot in the right ship at the right time makes a massive difference.
---
The biggest difference I've found from null to jspace is that in null, you're literally just a number. Whoever has the biggest blob wins.
---
In jspace, you matter.
---
Uh ask [this guy](https://zkillboard.com/character/227535700/) who did exactly this while we killed his friends. He pulled his drones then dropped them while we were shooting his friend. Nevermind that he panicked when we shot him and was clearly tanking - must be a bot. Or is it that only Chinese players can bot? 
---
the point is they lost Muninns to 20 rattlesnakes
---
I couldn’t find a main link through the App Store but https://tagn.wordpress.com/2017/11/03/neocom-ii-for-eve-online/amp/ works as a great app if your unable to log in 
---
I mean I enjoy mining and PI when I feel lile it, but I also enjoy PVP. I just don't want the PVP to be dependent upon the amount of PVE I do.
---
time to feed 1000000 corms :*(
---
Lolololol
---
I'd probably play more. Things have gotten out of hand.
---
It's not. I didn't really mean "ruin the game" in a global context. It just makes the game 'less' for individual players... now, I've used injectors, sure. I've trained HopelessGrind to level IV and now there's a billion day train to level V... yuck. Sure I'll drop an injector on that. Did I value that? No, it was pretty meh when I got it. Now when I trained all the mining skills up to a rorq without injectors - there was happiness, a sense of achievement. Christmas isn't fun when you buy all your own presents and open them early. If the game replaces true achievement with purchased achievement - that's the road to boredom, burnout and being a bitter-vet. Just my opinion. YMMV.
---
I come from that time we well, but I also have a decent job, as should the rest of us who are complaining about a game we've been playing for 8+ years. Fuck waiting for isk, and skills. If I want to fly a Kiki I don't want to wait a year to fly it with perfect skills, by that time CCP with have dropped 5 other new ships. What's the point of that!
---
&gt; deadspace fit pirate ships with 5+b pods
---
still dies to 5 thrashers on a gate
---
Since the Nestor cannot warp cloaked, you generally will have a bad time using it for exploration. I'd certainly start with an Astero and then a Stratios, and steer away from the Nestor until you really know what you're doing.
---
I do not have any concerns at present.
---
No, I can't explain why.
---
Wasn't this similar to the lady weekend just in higher amounts? 
---
Someone in BRAVE kept mining while my small gang was on grid, eventually allowing us to kill one of their Excavators (they'd pull the one that was getting shot, but not the rest.)
---
I didn't think they were botting though, I just thought they were monumentally stupid.
---
The Nestor is not an exploration ship. There are spider-tanked setups for higher class whs, but it wont work solo.
---
An Astero might be able to run C1 sites, but it is not really good at that. Have a look at the Confessor for these and while you are at it also at [Vulfpeck fleets](https://vulfpeck.space/)
---
You can also visit the ingame channel "EvE-Scout" for more exploration info and talk.
---
&gt;Anything could very easily exist.
---
I strongly disagree.
---
&gt;It doesn't exist that way, but don't let that stop you
---
I don't know that, I am not familiar with EVE botting software. I am familiar with how it works in general, which is what I draw my conclusions from. There is nothing to stop me.
---
&gt;by that logic you could argue since software could exist that supports most behaviors in eve, everyone in eve is a bot.
---
Well, if those behaviors would be extremely unreasonable from a human (which is the biggest part of my argument which you chose to forget about), and people would be exhibiting those behaviors, and a bot could reasonably end up doing those behaviors, then it would be more likely that those people were botting, yes. It's very simple logic, and it doesn't lead to the crazy scenarios you accuse me of unless you conveniently forget part of it.
---
&gt;Players behave this way all the fucking time. They gate jump freighters. They aggress at 0 on the undock. They fly blinged out Vindicators with officer mods through highsec to the next incursion system. People in this game are often incredibly stupid. Why is it somehow more parsimonious to explain stupid behavior away as botting? Or is it just because they are Chinese?
---
I have addressed this point before (multiple times actually), but I'll do it again just for you.
---
I never said this is botting because it's stupid, I said it's botting because it's behavior that a human would not do, stupid or not. Imagine a human trying to walk through a doorway, getting stuck because they carry a wide object, walking 3 steps back, and then trying again, over and over for 30 minutes. This is not human behavior, no matter if the person is stupid or not. Same can be said about a person repeatedly releasing and hiding their drones depending on a stealth bomber's cloak/decloak.
---
Maybe this time you will engage with what I wrote instead of arguing against something nobody is claiming.
---
On the plus side people wouldn't have dreads to bash them down quickly.
---
Thera to null.
---
All. The industrialist, miners, ratters you can have. 
---
its neither.    its a logi boat.    with bonuses that aren't really used (large energy range, and exploration).
---
if you want explo.  go Stratios.
---
if you want ratting.  dromi,  rattle.  heck even armageddon...
---
Most of these changes point to Upwell structures.  Neutrals living in stations would not see any changes.  Most who ARE living inside Upwell structures won't mind the 3-4 extra jumps it would take to bring them into prime hunting grounds, rather than being able to shoot the buffalo heard from the deck of their porch.  We can also argue the case that the target rich environment of FW lowsec is often the main attraction for neutrals wanting to reside here.  
---
As for the suspect flag.  Who, being a neutral, activating a FW acceleration gate to engage a target, is not already willing to take that suspect flag?  There really is no other reason for a neutral to be inside a FW objective plex sight seeing.  He's there for the fight.  
---
The cyno inhibition was a big deal with large lowsec operating non-FW entities like PL, who could be disrupted in any of their operations by a cyno inhib activated at the right moment just before a bridge.  It could be very injurious to them.
---
The ad-homs are cute but irrelevant. Not that it's in any way relevant but I am a software engineer and I know exactly what it would take to write a script that would emulate the behavior I saw.
---
The reason I'm calling out this rorqual fleet is not because it's chinese it's because this obviously dysfunctional behavior can not be explained by normal gameplay by a human player. No human player is ever going to synchronously pull their entire mining fleet when hostiles are on grid and they're getting bombed, then synchronously put all excavators out again and repeat this over and over.
---
*Cries in 2bill pod and 2bill Cerberus*
---
So if you are anti botting, why dont you hunt kwg in omist?
---
Yes really. Scram activation cost is very low. The jag can easily Regen enough cap in 2-3 seconds to get the scram. Mind you that it's the only thing it needs to activate since it's already traveling at 5-8k for the duration of the med cycle time.
---
Did you report him?
---
It's a niche game. It's not exactly designed to branch out to every type of player. And honestly the main reason for less Gen Z players is that most people don't even know this game *exists*. I didn't know about it till 8 months ago, and now I'm sad I didn't find this game years past. And I'm 17.
---
I'm not allowed to hunt blues. How about I hunt all the bots red to me, and you hunt the bots I can't hunt and together we hunt all the bots?
---
The tinfoil in this thread is incredible.
---
Don't panic guys, these were authored for something that's upcoming (as was the monacle) but don't worry, we're not going to be selling them for cash.
---
No spoilers.
---
I’d still play
---
you know your arguing with a guy whos been deployed for pure spin right?
---
Combat site wise using the least amount of toons:
---
C1 &amp; C2 = solo Gila or Myrmidon
---
C3 = solo passive or active Rattlesnake
---
C4 = duel box RR Nestors
---
C5 = duel box Tinker Rattlesnakes (will need more if you want to do the optional drifter boss)
---
C6 = Never fucked with
---
you dont need dreads when you have hundreds of attack battle cruisers
---
Why would we report him? For being stupid? This is a massive waste of time. Reporting him would be abusing the reporting system without evidence of bad behavior. 
---
You are retarded and should delete your account. 
---
It seems so weird to think BS like a Armageddon going into a wh. So I'd fit a Probe Launcher on her? Id take a Rattle, but I lost one in Sanctum the other day, so I don't have a decent fit. 
---
&gt; I said it's likely botting because it's a behavior that a human would not do, stupid or not.
---
Citation needed. They do it all the fucking time. You're hearing hoof beats and claiming a herd of zebras is heading our way. 
---
First rule as a older man, don't act like you understand young people. 
---
No Eve will never have 1m players, yes Eve will have a steady stream of new accounts. 
---
The declaring party can only end the war when the war bill is due (once a week), not at a time of their choosing. In this case it just so happened that the war bill was due at a very convenient time.
---
HORDE are bads and should have their own war against us if they really want to fight, not rely on assist piggybacking.
---
Hey guess what, I, too, am a software engineer. If I asked you in an interview to write software that would protect someone while mining in eve online, and you came back to me with that overly complicated fallback logic - I would end the interview. 
---
&gt; No human player is ever going to synchronously pull their entire mining fleet when hostiles are on grid and they're getting bombed, then synchronously put all excavators out again and repeat this over and over.
---
Input broadcasting. _Input broadcasting._ **INPUT BROADCASTING**. You're claiming it's a bot when this is a classic result of panicking while you are input broadcasting. You pull all your excavs, then try to drop drones on a combat ship or from your rorquals only to realize you have misconfigured your screen layouts. You're claiming this is software without _any_ evidence when this is more or less what you expect to see when someone who is input broadcasting spaghettis. 
---
I should have mentioned the suspect flag - I’m totally for that, and no standing hit for FW members if they attack first (inside a plex). 
---
The citadel thing is personal to my situation I guess, I’m a neutral pilot who likes living in my citadel in a single system, not for the targets but more because I’ve got to know the locals and made some friends (yay). But I wouldn’t mind paying double the fuel for the privilege to be honest. 
---
Overall I think a lot of your ideas, and those on the forum, are excellent. I should weigh in on discord perhaps, as a devil’s advocate )) 
---
Cyno inhib would be awesome to stop snuff soloing my astras in Titans as well ) 
---
So the problem here is that you don't know what the word Script means. That's ok, we all learn new words.
---
Wave two of that site has the highest DPS of any C4 site. While C4's can be run in a solo rattle, it takes an expensive fit and isn't very efficient. C3 sites are far better for a solo rattle.

---
You're not paying attention; its not a war between Horde v TAPI that would dictate the structure.
---
It would be a TAPI v Structure Owner, Horve v TAPI, PPD v Structure Owner, Horde v PPD style arrangement you would need to adequately defend.
---
The problem is both sides have proven adept at alt hopping corporations so you can catch the other side off in a brief window of just X vs Structure with no opposing force to fight them.
---
Like what happened earlier today; after the fight between TAPI and Horde, people in Horde had to have characters swap corporation directly into the wardecced person's corp so they could fight off PPD.
---
That might have been the thing... 5 years ago?
---
I'd like to see the gila fit that can rule the T5's
---
Here's how it worked:
---
1. TEST declares war on ICY (Horde-aligned azbel holding corp). TEST is the aggressor in the war and can extend it indefinitely if they so choose.
---
2. ICY moves into an alliance that is the aggressor in a war against TEST. Since you can't have a wardec against a corp that is in an alliance, this makes TEST's wardec drop.
---
3. ICY then drops out of alliance. When a corp drops out of an alliance, it inherits that alliance's wars. ICY is now the aggressor in a war against TEST. ICY now controls how long the war lasts.
---
4. In particular, ICY can time things so that the war ends at a time that is convenient to them. Due to war cooldown and spool-up, TEST will not be able to redeclare war in time to hit an azbel timer that ICY wants to protect.
---
In order to fix this loophole, CCP (a) made it so that ICY would not be able to join the alliance, preventing step (2) and (b) introduced instant war spool-ups for renewing wars that were on cooldown, so that even if the war dropped at an inconvenient time TEST would be able to immediately restart it.
---
I consider a rorqual releasing and returning drones in direct reaction to red bombers on grid cloaking and uncloaking, as if the bombers stopped existing and never have existed upon cloaking, to be computer behavior. Such behavior is incredibly unlikely to be demonstrated by a human player, similar to a person trying to walk through a doorway carring a wide object, repeatedly.
---
An even better and more direct comparison would be a person freaking out at gunpoint and returning to normal behavior when the assailant hides his weapon, over and over, on command.
---
I don't have a study on human players reacting to stealth bombers in eve online I can quote. If you don't find it obvious and disagree, and find it more likely that a human was hiding and releasing drones repeatedly in reaction to bombers cloaking and uncloaking, then I guess we can leave it here. I consider your opinion to be extremely unreasonable, maybe you think the same about mine, if that's the case we can't really move past that without bringing in psychology (and basic logic, in my opinion).
---
Says the guy commenting on every botting thread possible trying to cover the fact his precious alliance just had to join a botting ring, (DESPITE BRIGADING ABOUT IT FOR WEEKS LOLLL) yikes fam, I'd be this triggered if I widot'd this hard too
---
You get killmails now for bubbles, mobile depots and tractor units. Are you not pleased!?!?!?!
---
Highest rated character on zkillboard is **disconnects**, followed by **high latency**. 
---
RemindMe! 2 years "Is this still the case?"
---
The aggressor has to agree to the war surrender, TEST can't just surrender unilaterally.
---
LPT: learn game mechanics before posting, you'll look like an idiot less often.
---
I still remember running escalations in my first Tengu, when 7red enters local and as I was chipping away at last commander they started to show up on the 2Au Scan.   My heart was pounding as I looted,  when the first ceptor showed up on grid.  I warped, bounced a safe and entered the pos.  Congratulations on feeling the rush of getting away safe. ;) just don’t make it a habit of cutting it close.  
---
Is it bad that I was kind of hoping ya'll would start selling a monocle for cash again? The meta scene is a little slow right now and we need a good drama to tide us over.
---
Hm, TEST is aggressor.
---
I'd imagine because it's in what looks like a gift box it's not a purchasable item. Especially since the 500k one isn't bronze colored and the 750k one isn't silver colored. 
---
That sucks didnt know they changed it after carriers. Obviously not a content creator lol. I really hope they do something to address this.  As you guys are a BIG reason why eve is how big it is. Yea the fleet fights get the mainstream attention but its videos like *this is eve* yours and markee dragon that keep players around.
---
well, first off i'd demand free sub time equal to the time i've had sub thus far.
---
but long as i got that. sure i'd still play.
---
basically yeah, though keep in mind its no better than nestor, just more cost efficient and with more fitting powergrid.
---
I have no idea what lies in those holes. I don't know why the hole is a triangle. I don't know what happens when you enter or what fresh hell of EWAR awaits on the other side. I do know I like it that way, and I'm absolutely positive I know that I want them to stay in their weird holes.
---
Then TEST certainly isn't surrendering so everything you said is just nonsense?
---
Only the defender can surrender a war.
---
Impressive flying with that Jag. 
---
Usually when I fly AFs I try and save the ADC for oh fuck moments, basically trying to rep to full and get a round 2: I noticed you use it aggressively instead (ie: when ramming that loki) in order to have a good start and not get crippled by alpha strikes, as you're fighting mostly kitey stuff that stands no chance once you setup a proper AB orbit. Very nice indeed, and some food for thought for me. 
---
on a serious note
---
how do you people live with a strategic coordination chat room which is not the requisite Strangelove reference ?
---
Maybe HORDE could just put their azbels in alliance and solve that problem :thinking:
---
I find it incredibly likely that this is exactly what it has been every other time I've seen it - either a completely stupid person who believes themselves to be completely safe, or someone who fucked up when configuring their UI for input broadcasting. You are talking about whether this is likely human behavior without considering who would write a bot that waits until the enemy is on grid before reacting, then doesn't even check local or have a refractory period before dropping excavs again. Literally zero bots in eve online work that way. No human would write a bot that way. The point you are making makes no fucking sense. 
---
Aggressor has to accept a surrender, the defender can't surrender unilaterally.
---
We don't do high sec ganking anymore, but have a some dudes that could probably steer you in the right direction.

To be fair to them, they were doing it right. The towers were online, but with the shields down, lots of warp disruptors, and bubblewrapped. However, they were trapping maybe a dozen? supers. We'd relocated all of our supers to Saranen months before hostiles even thought about 93PI.
---
Heaven forbid people who play a game heavily focused on mechanics should exploit those mechanics
---
What is this naturalist whining bullshit, like what if we just kumbaya’d hard enough Carriers would stop applying stupid dps to small ships again?
---
I think a lot of people would be very upset about losing their hard earned space-things. Maybe if they gave out free skins based on your pre-reset net worth and skill points, the outrage would be somewhat lessened.
---
Personally I'd love to experience a hard reset of EVE and watch how the economy would re-establish itself, but I suspect that it wouldn't change much in terms of which groups would dominate. It would be a good opportunity for major balance changes as well. The removal of skill injectors for instance.
---
In the end I think this is never going to happen, but it's a mildly interesting thought exercise at least.
---
Having never run one of these sites of any variety, cannot confirm or deny.
---
It's almost as if people tunnel vision on trying to save their 800m drone instead of the friendly on grid that's not on their overview.
---
Well ... Better stay away ... Once you jump inside, you keep on coming back again and again and again ... Until that critical Time... The ride were you loose it all ...
---
Honestly though I'm tired of seeing the 'whataboutism' argument abused to dismiss direct move/countermove sequences
---
It's not whataboutism if the maneuvers are in a dependent sequence, whataboutism is a fallacy which occurs when the unrelated act of a second party is used to deflect from an act of the first
---
Pretty much everyone is fully aware of Horde's ongoing cheating and abuse of mechanics in regard to trade citadels
---
In that context It is both necessary and justifiable for all sides to sink to the level on which the contest is actually occurring to compete fairly
---
So, what about you shut the fuck up and take your licks
---
Yes, that would de-complicate the situation somewhat. Except I don't think every competitor market hub in Perimeter is actually Horde owned.
---
It's also a poor solution to what obviously still is an exploit around how the assist mechanics work, but I doubt we'll see a proper correction at this stage.
---
No
---
Your point was another satirical turd in the face of r/eve, I got it, don't worry.
---
Goes hand in hand with all the rest of the filth.  Either r/eve is CAOD, or its newbie help, it cannot really be both well.  Take your pick.
---
seeing as all my past shitting about hurtful ccp actions have actually proven to be bad as (everyone said, besides PR alts and players out of touch with the game) we can see by the current state of the game and its populace 
---
my reddit sperg holds more value than the consistent strawman arguments made by anyone (like yourself) attempting to defend CCP actions, or even presenting the element of doubt over their love for the playerbase and the long term vitality of the game
---
which really shows who is the real gevlon/falcon alt on the reddit spectrum 
---
Nestors are way better for highclass ratting
---
My ideas to fix retention.
---
1. Interaction with other players early on has been shown to increase retention. Ironically you're more likely to be retained as a player if some other player blows you up when you're only a newb. So, add a couple of player interaction missions to the advanced military career agent: A mission which matches up two players to fight a duel. Another mission that matches up two players to form a fleet to run a PvE mission. 
---
2. Add some very explicit suggestions of possible things to do next as the final message from each career agent. For instance the last interaction with the advanced military career agent should suggest Faction Warfare with directions on how to join and where to go for PvP minded players. Running security missions for PvE minded players, or a suggestion to join a newbro friendly PvP corp (with a link to the corp finder with the appropriate filters preset)
---
3. Along with #2 add some intermediate options for "what to do next" that provide a more defined path than just dumping them into the world with "do whatever you want". These should also allow/encourage interaction with more established players and groups that share the same interests. I'm thinking a few NPC corps focussed on particular types of activities paired with a default chat channel. Basically what you get in the Faction Warfare NPC corp and militia chat. 
---
The idea would be to get players interacting in meaningful ways right away, and to bridge the gap between the NPE missions and "Do anything you want"
---
&gt;You are talking about whether this is likely human behavior without considering who would write a bot that waits until the enemy is on grid before reacting, then doesn't even check local or have a refractory period before dropping excavs again. Literally zero bots in eve online work that way.
---
Yeah, that would be a pretty silly bot, I agree. Who did you hear saying that?
---
The bot I imagine does react to enemies in local, but it's in industrial mode anyway so it has to wait it out for a bit. If it can recover excavator drones fast enough, it may not do so until enemies are on grid. Before you were complaining about my idea of a bot being too complex, but not you complain that it's not complex enough and doesn't have a refractory period. I think a human would write a bot that way.
---
The messed up input broadcasting is also a reasonable explanation, probably more likely than just a human doing it.
---
aye,  but in groups.
---
a solo nestor.  is a free kill
---
It's fairly common.  I wouldn't say it has nothing to do with shipping and receiving though.  Large alliances do have logistics arms in the more conventional sense, but the game doesn't support that directly.
---
The ones that are not HORDE-aligned disappear pretty quickly.
---
Wardec mechanics are a mess. We've been dealing with HORDE/ICY wardec fuckery for months. We moved the keepstar into TEST precisely to avoid these kinds of issues because they were pulling this kind of shit on us. I don't have much sympathy for them when they get the worse end of it for a change.
---
&gt; so no mining and ratting in this system if u dont want to fight 
---
Small roaming gangs don't want to fight either. They will run away at the first sign of resistance. What they really want is easy frags against PVE fitted ships. 
---
Pretending that they want anything else is simply that. Pretending.
---
Stop pretending.

But if they steal a bag of chips from you, you are well within your rights to take it back
---
The second act isn't "wrong" because the actor is an aggrieved party with a claim to the property
---
It's pretty much an open secret that Horde was using bots to target new competing citadels and has never met a wardec loophole they didn't immediately fall in love with
---
Thanks for the explanation. It seems I was wrong.
---
Blood for the blood go wait that's not right. 
---
mobile depot that doesn't need anchor time
---
Yeah for me it s the same too
---
One of my typical questions about people looking into wh space is that to get the most out of them our play sessions are a little longer. You can play as infrequent as wanted but you generally want to have a per hours per session.
---
My average play time per night is about 2 hours. It works. It depends on your corp and what they will allow.
---
Some WH corps are very hard core and demand a lot from their players. Others are more chill.
---
It can be done.
---
Ehhh... [citation needed]. I'd like to agree with you, but of all alliances, *Horde* is not the one I would suspect of botting.
---
The problem is that you're shitting on CCP for something they haven't even hinted at doing. Something they surely know is a line too far for the playerbase, even after SP trading. 
---
You're outraged at what you think they might do based on speculation regarding an effect that has appeared on the test server.
---
If they ever announce this, I'll be right there in the threads adding my two cents, explaining why I think that directly selling in-game assets for $ is bad. But before? That makes you look like a whiny bitch looking for something to be upset about.
---
I'm fine with you gating around your officer fit titan you bought with a credit card by injecting skills after only playing EVE for 2 weeks. because you some how think that you can possibly buy your way into being good.
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
---
Sure. But why would they pull all their excavators and put them back out again 4 times in a row? With the dead excavators replaced by Mining II's.
---
It's fine so long as you don't get a bad orbit and bump one of the rocks (I do sansha sites). I do not do this AFK because you have to kill the webbers right away when they spawn.
---
I do go deeper into armor than I did with 100MN but the drones kill stuff fast enough that I never went below ~40% armor before reps caught up with DPS.
---
It's all horrible. Their narrative is horrible, our narrative is horrible, high sec is horrible, war decs are horrible.
---
The fact that pure statements of facts get downvoted is horrible.  I could literally post "The Highsec Keepstar is in Perimeter" and be -11 because of my flair.
---
So yeah, I'm with you. I'm kinda sick of the game and this sub right now.
---
"I'm quitting this shit alliance I never get reps"
---
or you can use a maurader instead of having to dual box
---
&gt; might try it, but apart from when i need to leave fast
---
This is the reason I dropped from 100MN. I barely got out from a cyna gank because I'd was halfway through a cycle of the AB when I shut it down. Intel hadn't reported him next door so I'm guessing WH or something. He landed the second I hit warp.
---
The only one in this thread that has understood the process ;)
---
Armor repping in Sansha sites.
---
how in hell did all those krabs manage to derail this thread so quickly? 
---
OP doea not need to learn the ways of the krab. 
---
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm right on the border between the 2 generations and I love this game...
---
It's been the NC/Panfam modus operandi for as long as I can remember to flagrantly cheat then spin a "Big Lie" smoke screen narrative
---
I think it's reasonable to conclude that any "beans of intelligence" recognize this and are entirely comfortable with it, having been at the forefront of cheating innovation themselves in this particular area for rather a while
---
But you're right that it's disturbing to see the depths of dishonesty being so regularly plumbed
---
True.  
---
The only exceptions are shatered WH and some ghost sites.
---
And has a fax :p dont forget the fax ;D
---
We are just over a month from another Eve anniversary.  Is it possible this could be one of the ccp gifts, or some kind of in game event and these are the rewards?
---
So basically your mom
---
Hope it works for you! My tackle alt is almost always in either that ship or a sabre, they both have really specific uses. That purifier is amazing for vnis though lol
---
Please do that. I love finding someone ratting in siege mode as it make catching them easy. Mauraders are some of the worst ships to rat with in a wormhole because of siege. The cost of two RR nestors is 1/2 a maurader and they don't require you becoming a unmovable brick to do good DPS.
---
An NC. corp onlined the last GSF-aligned POS to be killed for use as a stager
---
This was naturally the POS with the highest concentration of active supers as everyone left in 93PI by that time was either hard AFK or there for a reason and responding to the situation as it evolved
---
&gt; only named system in Syndicate.
---
Which one is that?
---
I have lost in T5s.  Oh yes.
---
But for real they are easy after you do like 10 of them.
---
*greed intensifies*
---
The only thing killing me is seeing how many people refused to use the cycle menu which allows for more actions at the same time and don't have to refresh all the time. EWAR usage is better then on usual recordings.
---
Make sure to use 483 keepstars while doing that
---

---

---
YESS the best meme for abyss space! Such a great scene! 
---
What the fuck...
---
I'm probably weird here, but T5 are so worth the losses for me. They're why I'm playing right now. I've always been mediocre at best (shit trash dumpster fire would be a better descriptor, at least that's how I feel) at PvP, mostly just going forty minutes to an hour between fights before just getting shit all over by groups massively better than me at the game (yes, outnumbered, but also clearly, and regularly, outplayed). But I've also always been bored by PvE, from missions to anom ratting to incursions to exploration to burners. T5 Abyss lets me have the fun of risking my ship against a challenge, piloting manually, adapting to different situations, learning and picking appropriate targets, making risk/reward decisions on the fly with the extra extraction nodes, etc. Plus, it lets me jump right in and have a decent chance of good action quickly. Even during the boring parts of endless drifter battleships or lucid deepwatchers, I'm still making money. But occasionally I get one of the hellspawns, like 4x Starving Vedmak, 4x each Starving, Ghosting, and  Tangling Damas, which are so fun they're worth the risk and all of the losses. Or, the worst one I ever faced and lived through, which was spawning with an ab cerb deep in a blue cloud with an assault karybdis boosted by TWO tracking pylons, and a whole mess of ephialtes cruisers with NONE that weren't entanglers, illuminators, dissipators or confusers.
---
I never thought I would be successful enough at any part of this game to say this but my problem now is I haven't died in the last forty or so hours of abyss sites. I desperately want a T6 filament with a similar jump in difficulty as from t4 to t5. I want to fight against nine leshaks of which six are starving, or against six vedmaks + damavik support, or have to grind through three rooms of four or even five deepwatchers to see if I can pull it off. And no, proving conduits won't scratch the risk itch for me until forced stalemates are removed via ramping up the resistance debuff over time. They might never properly scratch the itch for me because, like I said before, I'm pretty lousy at PvP.
---
Wow I ranted longer than I expected or intended. Oops.
---
No that died because TTT war decced a random corp on accident, opening them up to getting killed by assisting corps before Test could respond. Would not have happened if not for TAPI leadership incompetence.
---

I've seen a lot of good EVE art, but this might be the best. 
---
i mean 1/3 of this post is gibberish. 
---
Then you should quit your alliance.Since your Alliance know there have so many blue bots and let them do what they want.
---
More like... One station to rule them all and in the darkness BIND THEM!  &lt;evil laughing starts&gt;
---
Oh comon ... You Can Do so much better than that dude ... 
---
Let's get some things straight.
---
First, a bargain or trade is a statement of equivalency. You're agreeing to swap something you have for something you need. Maybe the price is marked up, and you feel it's not worth that much. Then either you buy it because you need it enough to be worth the extra cost, or you don't because it's not worth the cost. Or maybe you buy off a sell order instead of a buy order 30% lower, because you need it now. In this case you agree that the time factor is worth the extra cost.
---
This is universal. If you have a job, you're agreeing that your time and service are worth what you're paid. If you buy a subscription, you're saying it's worth $15/mo to you to shoot nerds, rats or rocks. If you buy PLEX from CCP, the conversion rate is worth it. If you buy it off the market and PLEX with it, then your game time is worth however much ISK, and associated grinding, that PLEX cost.
---
Here's the trick. PLEX allows game time to be expressed in terms of money in the real world or in-game. Which (as noted elsewhere) permits people in 3rd-world countries to play, while absorbing the excess from first-world players. CCP expands it's market and nets a bonus from PLEX cost vs. subscription cost, the in-game economy has more players to support it, and everyone's happy.
---
Well, not everyone. Losses are supposed to hurt, but if in-game is worth enough to you, they won't (pride excepted). Rich players can fly shiny stuff, beat players on their skill level, perhaps buy influence on the global scene.
---
This doesn't usually work out in their favor because a lot of these guys just throw money at the game and expect to win without knowing basic mechanics (hisec, damage application, bigger fish &amp;C). It biases in favor of players who are rich and smart, but we don't hear many stories about them. (Probably because we can't ridicule them).
---
On the flip side, PLEX establishes a dollars-to-ISK exchange rate. Thus the temptation exists to convert ISK back into dollars. However, this is not the fault of PLEX but rather a reflection of the fact that to most people, in-game assets have value. I'd argue PLEX curbs RMT by providing a legal exchange.
---
All things considered, I'm happy the way it is.
---
On to other subjects that always fet brought up in these discussions!
---
Bots are cheating, and hated, because they compete directly with us in the economic scene, and they're better than us. A bot that buys PLEX is going to make much more out of it than we ever could. They take effort to program, but little if any to maintain; effectively, its owner is feeding off the market while our grind worsens.
---
Skill injectors substitute time played for money. Both smart players and dumb players use them.  Dumb players just use them to get hilarious losses.  They are disliked because they allow smart players to leverage unbalanced mechanics immediately and destabilize the game (notably the market, but not limited to that). Sure, we'd see alarming trends without them, but we wouldn't see 50 rorqs in a belt.
---
Injectors are not all bad; they provide a psychological boost to new players. It's important to realize that you won't always be outclassed by guys who've been playing for ten years. However, they are tremendously expensive compared to starting income. They probably help retention, but most of their users are not new.
---
I'm not going to propose fixes. They're usually bad, always controversial, and with few exceptions entirely irrelevant. However, I am going to pass judgment.
---
TLDR
---
Bots: Bad.
---
Skill injectors: Bad, need fixes.
---
PLEX: Good.
---

How can I find a good WH or Null corporation to join? Where should I be looking for posts?
---
The "no SP out of thin air" went away a while ago with alpha injectors. At least injectors came from a skill farm of a player who was paying, even if alts in bulk. They rode that out of thin air deal for a while, now I'm guessing they would have never said that.

TAPI can't win HS
---
-&gt; Since this is going on you killed 1 Tatara and only because someone wardecked the wrong corp and we could not get a wardeck in time to defend it. 
---
Batphones? So Frat, NC, PL etc showing up helping Horde is what exactly? 
---
Lol hey best form of spam reduction is to make the spammer pay for it
---
At least you generated some content for the gangs that salvaged your wreck
---
This alone should be key that this post really needs to be taken with 55 gallon barrel of skeptisism
---
To be clear, batphones are to be expected for major timers. Anyone who does not expect them is deluding themselves.
---
What is curious to most is why TAPI prefers to batphone Goons (aka literally another coalition) than their own allies.
---
For all their "HS Content Generation", they seem to have generated for more content for Goons than BRAVE.
---
what is the exploit

I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.

---
Personally, I don’t think training multiple characters on one account from the start makes sense. Later on, it does. But you don’t really gain anything from having a hauler or miner alt on your main account. You are also better off with specialized alts, not generalists.
---
Yeah I'm still learning when to use it optimally. I've been trying to use it early on in easier fights simply to save on cap charges but in close fights it's often hard to tell when is the best time. 
---
Against a kikimora for example you would want to save it for as late as possible (something which I didn't do here) since it ramps up its dps and you will mitigate more by using it later. 
---
Spod Bless you good man
---
Now I’m not so sure, noticed that adds up to 2.25m SP, so guess it is either a joke or preparation for future test bonuses. 
---
You can solo c3 with active tank Gila as well
---
There are limits like 1000km away from structure etc but for the rest no.
---
Now that sounds like fun!
---
It's not without its many faults... but put it next to most other MMO's economies and it puts them to shame in terms of complexity and enjoy ability. 
---
Biggest problems I see are Inflation of isk coupled with things like flat rate payouts (Incursions and Isk rewards from missions)... As time goes on and the price of everything goes up, incursions become less and less lucrative because it's simply a flat payout of about 30 mil.
---
ooc wat fit you usin? for wat filametns?

ive gota  2bn shield ishtar for elecs but would reaaaaly like to find a cheap way to do exotics reliably
---
Its a pilotable mobile depot for supercapital pilots. Change my mind
---
I have a pod parked in a Keepstar specifically for when I fly these. This is an activity I have not only done, but encouraged others to do.
---
Please don't make me to fucking PVE Abyssal shit for sp. 
---
Please...
---
I dont think they're losing HS if the Keepstar is up and running.
---
&gt;At that point, I would assume I have enough experience to begin shaping my Alpha accounts into characters who complement my main’s play style.
---
Thank you for your insight!
---
I think this is my problem. Now I don't play them together, but I enjoy both PvP and some of the PvE aspects such as mining as I would like to explore it. Back in my day that would require a new account with a subscription if you didn't want to stop your combat training. I can see on my alt that I can train some of the stuff on alpha but not exhumers so I think maybe I'll start some mining with a smaller rig and see if I like it in which case I'll see how long it takes to plex my main.
---
Very true but you need really good skills (the OP said his skills aren't the best) and the duel battleship waves can get hairy in a Gila. Rattlesnakes are far more efferent in a C3 then a Gila.
---
I'm Gen Z/ a millennial and I used to play DCS world and loved reading the manuals and guides on how to actually fly the airplanes... It's not a matter of "the youths" it's a matter of interest.  There's no way in hell that I could sit my father down and get him to play to play either, he just isn't interested. And I don't think many people today or in the past really want to read a 200-500 page manual on how a virtual plane works... Unless you like reading a 200-500 page manual on how a virtual plane works. People like arcade like games because people want to pick up a game and start playing right away, put it down and then come back when they have the time. You can't really do that with eve, and that's perfectly fine. Eve is going to attract a special type of player, and that player isn't the masses.
---
apparently if you turn off, then turn on a highsec wardec, it drops the allies the defenders invited, if you do this with under 4 hours before the timer (which is how long it takes for a defender assist to go active), then the wardec allies won't be able to fight for the timer.
---
No fanfest this year....

ask noraus and all the shit he feeds cuz hes trash
---
&gt;  agree with me in a reddit comment
---
please file a bug report
---
Essentially, an agressor is able to negate the assist mechanic which is especially problematic for important timers. Putting aside the effect on large NS entities, this exploit will allow groups like PIRAT or similar to wardec a corp and then negate whatever assists that the defender may call in.
---
They do this by letting the original wardec lapse (eg. by not paying the bill) and then re-wardec during the new 24h cooldown period. This drops all assists and defenders will not be able to help for at least 4 hours. 
---
If the agressor re-wardecs 3.5h or less before an important timer like what was done twice today, the new assists won't be live until after the timer. 
---
It's mostly a stalemate atm as far as I can see. TAPI's keepstar isn't under serious threat but they are also having serious issues holding the necessary market exclusivity.
---
Yes because everyone loves fighting in tidi in hisec of all places. And this being imperium you WILL have one guy who doesn't set safety to green and fucks everyone
---
We're losing so bad, we can't find a way to make the keepstar isk faucet turn off. HORDE please help us.
---
Fair. Edited TLDR for clarity.
---
Unfortunately OP has hit a soft spot and lots will jump up to say it isn't so, or that it doesn't apply to their generation. And I feel it's more then just an age thing now, it's a "what we are use to playing" thing. We have tons of games to play and every one of them wants you to grind, people are tired of it. If we really want player retention then things have to change and evolve. More disappointing is that CCP knows this and their plan is to manipulate the game in a way that grinding isn't effective, but buying plex is. Its bittersweet. 
---
I have three teens at home, they all like Eve and have tried it, but it's too time consuming for their tastes. They want instant gratification, that's what we as a society are moving towards.
---
I feel like we should be focusing on the new player experience, focus on getting them to the point where they can jump into short but sweet content. Right now all of that is provided by the community and you have to look for it. Make it more appealing and rewarding, and make it more accesible. Just my two cents. 
---
doesn't redeccing have a 24 hour timer 
---
A good way to have better retention could be actively managed newbie corps from CCP. Instead of just career agents, add the option to join a newbie corp straight away with PVP, Industry, or Exploration in mind. And by that, I mean separate corps from the NPC one, exclusive to new players.
---
The point would be to have a more newbie friendly environment where new players wouldn't have to risk getting recruitment scammed, or scammed in general, and one that doesn't spit you in one of the big power blocks straight away. Maybe even setup comms, so players can have a better understanding of how the game is actually played. 
---
sure, but any market share is more than nothing, which Horde is getting atm. The stated goal was always to take away Hordes income first and wory about making own money second. 
---
It is instant if done during the cooldown.
---
Profitability has gone down the shitter though
---
Data/Relic sites...in a carrier. I am not "up" on capital ship but is this something that people do? It's seems to me that it would be painfully slow to burn from can to can.

this was a dumb post, even by my standards
---
That joke is so old the first time i heard it i fell off my dinosaur!
---
I’m surprised they don’t have an in-game combat simulator you can play that doesn’t risk your ship or isk for new players but I guess it’s hard to replicate real player movements in PvP. 
---
Saw title and thought you were proposing a SoE capital.
---
Disappointed now :(

---
I would not at all be opposed to an SoE Capital, but I expect we won't see that until after the Angel Titan.
---
when i lived W-Space, every Maurader was considered bait, but boy they are fun to fight
---
Stated goal of the Geminate invasion was to get horde out of high sec or they wouldn't leave... so I'd take stated goals with a grain of salt.
---
As much as TAPI probably enjoys denying horde income, I highly doubt they would put this much effort in if more income for them wasn't a main motive.
---
People? Yes. A lot of people that know what they are doing? Not so much.
---
go run a t1 to check it out. pretty sure anything can burn through it. I did it in a caracal. 
---
To be fair, that's not really something they have a monopoly on. There's plenty of koolaid to go around. I am in test and some of the dinoposters make me cringe, and I don't know how goons resist awoxing some of their reddit posters. Though in this case claiming that test was just trying to avoid a fight seems a little silly after all the blueballs I have been through in perimeter.

Not quite sure what you are trying to say? Don't remember any person getting anything beyond the standard eve corp response of friendly ribbing to getting ganked in the past few years.
---
If you had such a track record of flipping characters how could you not explain your connection to a character that was sold (presumably by you)?
---
Okay I concede your point on TIDI. I probably did focus too much on the drawbacks on TIDI given that this is something that occurs only in a minority of engagements, even among the larger entities.  
---
However, I contest your other points.  I actually think the opposite as far as "losing" in eve.  Eve is probably one of the most forgiving games when it comes to losing.  Capsuleers are immortal and after losing a ship and being podded you simply respawn (almost) good as new.  This is even more true since the removal of clone upgrades that resulted in loss of SP on occasion.  Consider also that T1 hulls have very decent insurance payouts when they die, and that citadels anchored in K-space kick the contents of their hangars into asset safety when they die.  So no, I don't think losing is designed to suck whatsoever.  
---
You're correct though that there's _something_ that encourages players to sacrifice autonomy, relevance, and engaging gameplay in the name of joining these megablobs.  I think the reason for this is risk aversion, laziness, and a general failure to understand the consequences of our actions.  Yes joining goonswarm means that you can crab in peace and your shit is SRPed and you won't have to go much effort to get in on some seal clubbing, but your membership also means that a huge portion of the pilots you will encounter in the game will be blue.  It means most fleet engagements you're involved in that lack TIDI will be an absolute stomping and required little skill.  it also means that your individual contribution is completely negligible in the larger context of roles filled in your fleet - simply due to the size (unless you're the FC).  By joining a "relevant" entity in eve individuals become irrelevant.  Pick a random person in goons or NC. or PH and disable their accounts such that they can never log in again.  Would anyone notice their absence?  Would it affect the function of the alliance whatsoever?  It is ironic I think that it's always individuals in the largest alliances that accuse others of being *irrelevant*. 
---
These are the costs of joining large blobs, and i'm tired or wading through the river of tears that saturates this subreddit flowing down the soggy pink cheeks of individuals too dim-witted or delusional to help themselves.  This has nothing to do with natural selection and it *really makes me want to fucking die when I read shit like this.*  It's just a dysanalogy that people try to use to insinuate that their conscious decision to try to win more fights by joining a bigger blob is some super creative dynamic strategy. It's a copout. Natural selection is a mechanism by which a heritable trait becomes more prevalent in a population due to the competitive advantage that trait provides.  Corporations and alliances do not make progeny in eve, nor does there exist a substrate that embodies the *essence* of a corp that can be transferred from one corp to another. I don't know what it is you people think *adaptation* and *natural selection* is, but these terms don't mean what you think they mean. 
---
The actual situation here is much more simple.  Entities that get their shit memed on coalesce into bigger groups so they can't get memed on.  This can escalate to an extent where there's literally no one else to fight (look at the Chinese server) and makes for really really really shitty gameplay.  There are definitely changes CCP can make to help prevent this but I'm just pointing out that no one actually _forced_ you idiots to do this.  The UI is a bit convoluted but the *drop alliance* menu and *manage standings* menus aren't that difficult to find. They're far easier things to locate than the balls of most people in this community, which seem to have shrunk to the size of something requiring the large hadron colider to study. 
---
It's basically like this. Not that complicated.
---
&gt; stopping people actively jumping is difficult
---
One of you attacks, the other doesn't so can jump with them. 
---
Well, it's not cheap so I don't know if it will help much, but it's fun. I'm on my phone so can't post it exactly but I use a ham cerb (kin bonus is sweet for exotics), a-type medium booster + b-type invul + thukker large cap + deadspace ab + serp web. 3 deadspace ballistic control, adcu for if I take wrecking shots. Rigor ii + em resist. Crystals, blue pill, crash, and a hardshell in cargo in case I need it. Whatever combo of implants and boosters you use, aim for 500 DPS Omni tank and hopefully more against triglavians (exotic is nice for this since they don't do kin damage). To me it felt undertanked at first but it kills stuff *really* quickly, especially with the kin resist debuff, so the incoming damage drops off fast. Just be careful of neuts+red cloud or drifter assault bs + blue cloud. Especially the neuts if you're used to electricals.

I'm certain someone here will bring the salt.  Excessive amounts of salt.  If you want sugar , you'll have to bring your own though.  
---
Wow I guess this means delve has hundreds maybe thousands of rorqual bots because I have killed tons of excavators there doing the same thing. Clearly there is no way a player watching netflix could be culprit for such a low apm activity.  
---
There was a vid a couple of weeks back of a couple of players running bombers killing excavators and the like. Looked fun but requires bomber skills and about 40-50m ships

Hey now, tinfoil has its uses. IIRC, a tinfoil ball in a microwave is the power core powering most Minmatar ships

(In response to questions on the use of the exploit)

Radamere:Yea we dont plan on doing that regularly

Radamere:That was because this was importannt and we wanted an extra edge

Bambulko:Actually, we could try this with PPD itself in the future

I was in Provi for a long while.  When I was burnt out of my home, and joined a big strong power.  For a while, felt really good to be on the winning side the vast majority of the time.  But when I really thought about it, being in Provi was a lot of fun.
---
I would not want to live there IRL, but it's fun to play as the underdog, and you can do that in Eve if you so choose.
---
The roaming red gangs are literally the draw to life in Providence.

Where is this labeled an exploit? 
---
I feel like the only way to PLEX safely is if it costs only a small amount of your total income to cover, definitely shouldn't spend countless hours grinding for it.
---
Though if you're in a place where you're making billions monthly without even trying, you've probably already sold your soul to this game anyway, so..
---
that was a benefit of geminate not the goal

Test server is what they would say but I really like this idea. Kind of like the training room in world of tanks.

So a ganker, it's ok boys he's clear!

Happy Cake Day LegbeardCatfood! I hope this is the beginning of your greatest, most wonderful year ever!

So you believe humans are stupid enough to mine knowing there are stealthed bombers on field but that its so unlikely as to be almost impossible that people are stupid enough to write a bot that is so stupid it mines with stealthed bombers on field?
---
This is some sage advice. Wish I could pin it to this sub.

Yep. Account management is kill.

Someone should make a time machine so we can go back in time and gank that guy so we don't hear about it so often, I mean I get it, congratulations but ffs

Skill up!

Nah, horde has nowhere near sunk as low as tapi. You're posting in a thread dinobrains posted themselves and are bragging about the results of their exploiting. You talk about all these exploits people know horde do, yet I havent seen anybody specifically describe even one. Maybe if you learn some more you will start to form some coherent logic, but all you're doing right now is regurgitating brainless tapi spin. 
---
Sit the fuck down in the peanut gallery.

Guard leaves and the other shoe drops...

I hope people that complain about cloakies will meme this into the game.
---
I can't wait to abuse it on blockade runners et al. while gatecamping.
---
Holy shit this is absolute fucken  gold. Are you sure your handler gave you permission to post on reddit? Horde using bots in hisec?? Lmao check that tinfoil on your head isnt getting cracked mate.
---
sounds to me like the guy hates tidi.  goons wrong place to go then, when jumping a gate with an average fun roam fleet for them induces tidi.
---
Yes. Probably just a number value for yes/no. However, unpublished doesn’t necessarily mean doesn’t exist. Not 100% sure on the distinction, but some things in game (especially like environment assets) are “unpublished” but still there.
---
People are people.  Eve didn't appeal to most of the older generation either, it won't appeal to most of the younger generation.
---
I think published just means it shows up on the market and stuff. Not that it doesn't exist in game. I know lots of old items are marked as "unpublished", like the old mines, but copies still exist in the game.
---
or the result
---
What /u/m0rzor said. You'll be caught at the edge of the bubble. If you know where the pilot is coming from, you can drop a stop bubble far off the gate/hole and make them land several hundred km from their destination.

What? I support my local Concord Officers.

Both of the fits I'm about to link cost around 500mil and have the same DPS. The active tanks better, but requires you to actively pulse your shield booster when you need to rep (if you try to run it 100% of the time you will cap yourself out due to the sleeper neut pressure). The passive is a little easier since you don't have to manage your booster, but your easier to kill if you get jumped by some hunters. I recommend using Caldari Navy Scourge for your ammo and toss a mobile depot, probe launcher + probes, a Agency 'Hardshell' TB9 Dose IV and a cloak in your cargo in case you need them.
---
Eve Scout has done it for stream views. Rorq, dread, carrier etc...not for serious exploration.

Define "main account", because you're acting like "main account" and "first account" are synonyms, when in reality, "main" is a pointless distinction.

I have an account which I'm using to figure out what I want. In a while, I can create an account with something more dedicated for combat. Then I'll have a mining/hauling account and a combat account. Not a main and not-maim.

Was it cap stable tho?

You are a bilbo douche baggins

Who cares? If someone else wants to play that way go for it. The only issue I see is a game balance one, but that's up to CCP to control. We're just arriving at equilibrium more quickly now.
---
The alpha injectors are, basically, because turning on Omega for a single day would have unwanted side effects. And reworking training to allow for omega training, while on alpha, would have been a lot more work.

Those dreads stand no chance... Wait

If so it needs to be careful not to be OP. Something that causes a very slow overheat on your cloaking mod until cycled would trip up AFK players without effecting bombers and blockade runners. They can just turn mod off and on again in the 10 mins it takes to overheat, or jump a gate. That would be balanced. Something that immediately decloaks everything around you would be unbalanced.
---
Yeah these kinda things are difficult to prevent when you're ratting in a very populated system, and the only way we find out that you're tackled is when somebody in in-game intel channel reports it.
---
This guy did so many things wrong.
---
At least [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76028431/) happend lmao

Maybe they should just fix the high sec mechanics.

Except no, you didn't.

You are wrong, character bazaar is very much contained by supply. Say, you want 5 rorq alts but if no one is selling a rorq pilot you can only wait. Nowadays, people can just inject 20 cyno cloaky campers in a matter of minutes.

ok

Instant gratification does not mean `takes less than 5 hours to actually play the game`. If you think taking hours upon hours to achieve the most mundane task is a positive you're dumb.
---
It's a ratting fit. It's used to preserve cap so you dont need injectors.
---
&gt; **can we nerf awox** 
---
if only ccp gave us tools to see if characters have connections to hostiles
---
instant gratification means i can log in, and have fun, and log out again in a short space of time.
---
literally every game but eve offers that.
---
The salt thing
---
I got ganked 3 times in a week. 
---
No one in corp gave me flack. Because you have an alt corp that is not connected to your main corp in your farm hole.
---
It was 2 farm Rattlers + high grade crystals.
---
My own damn fault, no doubt. Got my panties in a twist over that. At same time had RL drama, the bad kind. It was simply too much. Quit the game there and then.
---
Not blaming the corp, sure they would help if I asked. 
---
As for the character, I had no recolection of the name. Char transfered ISK to my toon. The way you do it is - buyer sends ISK to chat being sold and that ISK is transfered to another char. As per CCP rules.
---
Explanation was not accepted.
---
Never really used the guy, forgot the name. Got drilled about the char, that for the life of me could not remember, went on defensive.
---
WHEBOO is still one of three best corps I had the pleasure of being  a member of in past 12 years.
---
But, rejection was blessing in disquise.
---
After a bit of stumbling managed to find a great corp in Test. So it all worked out in end.
---
This is even better: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76028431/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76028431/)
---
Jumped in with an empty fit dread to kill a titan. :D
---
How? Did you buy injectors with real money
---
Why?
---
&gt;can we nerf awox
---
um excuse me sir but the levi was in our fleet. we did as snuff does and shot purple
---
Same way I look at it. Someone paid 10 or so grand to bring me a titan kill. What a kind person.
---
5 days...guessing they not in any of the horde cap groups.
---
so its unlikely horde had any idea this person was under attack.
---
birdsquad is indeed number 1
---
it would have been trivial to cyno in bumpers, and getting a good cyno-in bump off on a supercap would have easily doomed it
---
sorry you guys couldn't figure that one out
---
*laughed so hard I fell off.
---
Unless you were implying it was funny the first time either.
---
In which case you get first prize for wit
---
blurple is just a color :honk:
---
&gt;Yes you can. Any gated deadspace site is cynojammed and covert cynojammed. For example FW plexes. Can't use cynos in highsec or wormholes either. And if constellation has an incursion then all those systems are cynojammed.
---
I could also log off. What do you think about that mechanic? Fucking uncounterable!
---
&gt;FW space is only place where you can realistically avoid cynos because you have plexes in every system easily available to any ship. No need for cynoblocking there.
---
No. They are very oppressive. Every part of the game except some bullshit f1-drone space has a massive need for cynoblocking by default.
---
&gt;It was already nerfed several times. It used to be a lot stronger without much restrictions. If subcap vs capital balance is tweaked it will be ok again.
---
A 5 min delay could fix it somewhat. You could change cap damage as much as you want, but it wont matter as they just switch to blops if caps become ineffective. 
---
Ooo, makes sense, didnt think about that, thanks 
---
really? you wanted a good fight?
---
\*Pats back\* there, there I'm sure you'll get it next time
---
we're just colourblind ok
---
Word, I understand. We'll we're alpha friendly if you ever feel like playing casually and just hanging out with us. :]
---
Who will be the first who takes out Fraternity from TQ?
---
nothing of value was lost
---
Thanks so much, this is great stuff. 
---
its healthier to be a whiny bitch who wants things to change for the better,
---
 instead of being a socially engineered conformist who is quite literally part of the problem with his blind subjugation to either a game company and/or the unhealthy norm of the masses that has corrupted eve in all of matters that make eve, eve
---
It would be super awesome on gatecamps if it behaved like a smartbomb without the damage and had a longer range. 
---
Combined with smartbombing ships you'd be able to almost completed cut off travel.
---
you dont accept the surrender
---
Was in a hurry. I should fix it, but I wont because I care about the context of others' posts. 
---
It's pay to win when a player can pay to get an advantage over a player who didn't pay. You cannot get that in eve no matter how much plex you pump in you can't get something that another player could not get with isk they got from some other source.
---
You already can. :P
---
480mil ticks , dang!
---
&lt;left&gt; &lt;right&gt; &lt;left&gt; &lt;up&gt; &lt;right&gt; &lt;up&gt; &lt;down&gt;
---
most probably themselfs
---
Also do we want that many new players? Imagine if eve actually became the most popular game it would be chaos 
---
&gt; 10 or so grand
---
wut
---
NGSA will make sure this gets fast tracked into TQ... if DBRB would unleash us already
---
It also applies to a few day newbies flying blinged battleships in lowsec; so generous of them to spend all that money on PLEX so I can get decent loot for a change.
---
10 grand? Is that really the total cost of a few injectors and enough plex to buy the titan?
---
wow nice narrative 
---
All hail hypnotoad! :)
---
They don't put the structures in horde because they want to do loophole bullshit.
---
This one time it backfired.
---
where is the fucking problem?!? It's no different than if the character was 5 years old... absolutely ZERO difference
---
all our enemies are already docked havnt you seen the MER? not much for us to camp....
---
Nice 
---
Calm down this is for next time they spend 2 weeks ignoring all sisi feedback and push to tq anyway
---
and said, in perfect unison, YEah they use asic miners these days
---
The ESS is good, it just needs to be stronger now.
---
I highly doubt it. Looks more as if someone earned tons of ISK boting and just used it to inject supercap alt.
---
imagine being horde
---
Even better when you barely survive to find Spectre fleet has been camping your trace the whole time
---
T3C brick tank fit with 2k ehp/s and with a good +50 cap/s overcap and a faction battery for the neuts. That should allow you to do it all on 1 account i.e. scanning, relic sites, data sites, combat sites up to c5 (albeit extremely slow and inefficient).
---
You'll run out of cargo space though
---
quick someone napkin math this how much real life $$$
---
&gt; TLDR: TAPI can't win HS timer even with exploits, will have to continue  batphoning Goons (instead of their own coalition) for timers. 
---
underrated truth 
---
The loopholes are mentioned in the Devblog for the March charges. Basically before that you could invert a war from being a defender to being the attacker, by joining and leaving an alliance. This was used many times by ICY (just look at the alliance histories of many of his Azbel corps).This loophole got closed with the March release.
---
 But today we learned that there is a new 'loophole' when the defender gets assistance. This is indeed a problem. However, in this case it could have been easily avoided by putting the Azbels into Horde, or declaring war on Test directly, whole there was basically no counterplay to the old loopholes.
---
Huh?  Surely the passive regen is enough?
---
I'm not OP but if new players actually join a reasonably well established group and listen to the elders on how to make money, they can do well. A common example being salvaging behind supers or in very busy area. You can make a lot of money really quickly, though it's really tedious. If you put lots of time in you can make lots of money and afford those injectors to move more quickly towards capitals.
---
Don't have 2 ships that can do all the roles needed. Split them up.
---
Nice outrage buzzword salad. I'd ask you to point out specifics of what you're accusing me of, but we all know that'd be a waste of time. Feel free to look at my post history and you'll notice that several few of my created threads are complaining about stuff CCP does.
---
In this case CCP hasn't done anything that warrants complaining about (yet). For all we know it could be mass test rewards for Sisi, further chat system reimbursements, an anniversary event, a big in-game event, etc.
---
It is on my Avatar
---
You tell all that from those two images, eh?
---
Why not have more teams?
---
Is there a lack of participants or is it that non one has enough time to organise a bigger tournament?
---
Is salvaging behind a super. salvaging sanctums? Or is there another site supers do?
---
nobody cares if you need assists. if you cant defend your citadels dont drop them. There is no exploit or loophole in letting a war dec die, its their wardec they do whatever they like.
---
Hey everyone, just an update on the tournament! We've got 6 of the 8 teams up here, as 2 of our original participants were unable to finalise their roster in time - Brave Newbies have graciously stepped in to take one of those spots, and we are discussing with other teams to round it all out.
---
I hope you guys are as excited for this as I am!
---
Idk, say you can burst once or twice a day, that would be pretty neat.
---
Cue the drama that if you don't let him play he'll take his ball and go home because he didn't want your stupid alliance anyway. Perhaps that such recruiting practices are discriminatory and newbie-unfriendly and will be the nail in the coffin for EVE?
---
They just did a tournament a few months ago. Doing these consistently is  a lot of work for a fan run thing.
---
I limited the tournament to 8 teams, as running a 16 man tournament is a massive step up in people management and time requirements from myself - It's something I'm mostly piecing together on my own, and I do have my limits. 
---
This is the second tournament I've run this year, and I hope to be able to squeeze in a third in October, so hopefully teams that miss out will be able to join in on that opportunity instead!
---
You overestimate our cap team efficiency.
---
not a narrative. a common sense warning to people in horde.
---
be in an API group before ratting in a cap.  that way you have access to propper channels to call for help.
---
cause standing fleet wont save you from a dread bomb.    and it takes a while to go from standing to the proper channels and verify where htey are.
---
holly hell. this might be too dumb to even be a bait post :( guess ill wander on
---
Cyno bomber and a super 
---
This is the longest smug post about a 30 man fleet being blobbed that I've ever seen
---
salvaging is a general thing where a site has been cleared and all that's left are the wrecks, full of meta modules, which can then be salvaged for parts. one part isn't worth much but a lot of them are worth a lot, as they are used for rigs on both ships/citadels.
---
usually ratters like to do one monotonous thing at a time, as it is a lot more consistent on the experience just warping site to site, therefore they just leave all this stuff there. salvagers go in and drop an MTU, then salvage the wrecks.
---
the reason you would salvage behind a super, is that a supercarrier will clear a lot of sites very very quickly. this means you have a lot more sites to salvage, which increases the amount of money you make. so say they clear a site and make 30m in a few minutes, salvage of that site might be worth 5-10m. the super will want to just clear the next site, whereas you can go and drop an MTU, come back later and salvage the wrecks, pick up the contents of the MTU, and repeat. you can make a lot of money doing this.
---
lets go CALSF!
---
when do they play?
---
Cool feature
---
The tournament will be on the 20th &amp; 27th of April, starting at 20:00 and live on CCP &amp; Streamfleet's Twitch - I don't have exact times of matches yet as we've not done the bracket draws!
---
I have died in the abyss a few times, will still go back, t5's own
---
I think the game could definetly use some serious streamlining when it comes to structure timers etc. Especially the small and medium ones and double this if / when they are powered off.
---
I also think the game as a whole is heading in the wrong direction with increasing huge wide area content denial mechanics. Just too much shit for average player that is not a part of specialized group or a blob to deal with makes it completely not worth playing. Sure you can, and things do go down once in a great while, but these are not average occurences, just exceptions, they need to be average or at least much closer to it.
---
I believe in both cases natural selection will weed out people who mine knowing there are bombers on grid, and bots that need to see hostiles on their overview in order to react. It seems extremely unlikely that the latter would ever see the light of day, considering there are relatively few botting software available at any given time.
---
Then you’d need the isk to buy the ship n fit too so...
---
When people are silent, this cannot really be prevented. Titans die in delve because they're silent.
---
This guy would've died no matter which alliance he was in
---
They give data on such. Could they do more, perhaps, and they know this and budget for it. Botting has the possibility of bring down the whole game (and has definitely degraded it) in a hurry. Sure they may have missed the trends leading up to this problem but they are not blind (no turning a blind eye) to it now. You, however, offer absolutely 0 data, nor any useful opinion/insight. this post was the least intelligent expression of botting frustration ive seen yet.
---
Granted, and you are correct, still, CCP should look into it for pure purpose of having recorded due diligence in case some sort of liabilty issues creep up in the future.
---
Ok you made me go scroll through 2016 transactions on that alt. Never noticed that. Good point sur
---
Who the fuck is spooky action, what a dumb name
---
Does anyone else find this to be ironic coming from Snuff? The alliance who drops supers and titans that outnumber the subcap fleet they are dropping on?
---
Something like 200km range, pulses like a links module does currently. It should scramble cloaking devices and prevent them from reactivating for the duration of the cycle time.
---
Range should be modest so it’s not OP, and if you don’t get hit by the initial cycle (e.g warp in after) then it doesn’t do shit to you.
---
Maybe two grand if they injected reaaaaaaalllllllyyyyyyy nice skills.
---
Well, sorry about that, it's just every time I see Chinese character buying some expensive in-game item I always assume they must have been either farming for in-game money, or running a bot. In case of Eve I would assume second is more realistic. 
---
Naturally.
---
Botting is the root of all evil you know.
---
 *Zimbabwe Dollars
---
lmao nobody's forgotten the flagrant abuse of unintended mechanics throughout Horde's entire involvement in highsec dude
---
You can be as toxic and dismissive as you want, the examples including statements by your own leadership are cited repeatedly in this very thread and they don't cease to fucking exist because they aren't stapled to every reply
---
Nobody has any sympathy and you aren't drumming any up like this
---
Mmm no, that would just further incentivize N+1 gameplay.
---
You deserve to be paid more for the shit storms and fires you put out at the speed at which you've done here.
---
Am I right in thinking that they have a single low slot mod?
---
I think someone discovered this in like 2012, so I do not think it will ever happen.
---
is it really that different from just buying a titan pilot from the bazaar?
---
don't forget the cap stable cap recharger!
---
So missed an opportunity to call our team Ghostbusters :/
---
Eh, this is EVE. 
---
Just because you can buy into something doesn't mean you know what to do about it. Big reason why I disagree with "eve is pay to win"
---
What makes you good at eve really good, not just +1 good, but lets fight 2 to 1 out numbered and win good. Experience. Skill injectors and isk just make people who understand and know how to play the game that much better and the underdog noob that much worse. Not saying injectors are perfect, they are just not the "pay = win" model.
---
Nice kill
---
This corp seems to be top tier PvP'ers, basically nothing but lossmails.
---
epic
---
Bunch of nobodies. 
---
The "virtual plane's" back then were allegedly as close as you could get to the real thing beyond limits imposed by the tech of the time and classified information. 
---
I didn't pull that 500 pages figure out of my ass. The Falcon 4 main manual was about that long and there was a smaller secondary manual. The game guide as another 500 pages or so. One of them was. There were at least two of those.
---
I haven't played DCS but watching DCS vids extensively is actually part of what lead me to my thoughts on the matter.
---
Other than being much prettier. Mostly...Ok MUCH MUCH prettier than the ancient F4.0 and the even older Jane's games, they just aren't as accurate as the old warhorses. For every cool point I give DCS for stuff like properly moving air intakes, I have to take some off for stuff like launched missiles still visible on the rails although to be fair this may have been fixed since last I looked.
---
Agree about EVE being very niche and always will be.
---
it's the only counter to 24/7 permanent intel that is local chat
---
That point I often make when people say its broken. This is just a way to buy a high SP toon that has your own name and avatar and a clean corp history. Albeit (I believe) a lot more expensive.
---
You're joining Darkness?
---
ok nazi
---
yep, and lets be honest - name and corp history aren't particularly important.
---
Yeah, new players need caps. Can CCP justify the need for this?
---
yeah so only new players would not know about it :)
---
How?
---
Dont worry he has already report this to ccp and really nothing appear because no need. Yeah we try to have clean ass in init if someone is doxing you can be sure that he will get kicked.
---
take my upvote
---
If you look at the war history between Test and DWSC- (the Azbel Corp), you'll see that Test declared war in October. How on Earth should we know in October that a final kill timer would be exactly today? In facts, we learned from the ping mentioned in the OP that Horde can't shoot us.
---
&gt;Titans die in delve because they're silent.
---
The last titan to die in Delve was August 2017.
---
Yeah, especially corp history in this case, being as it is horde. =P  
---
But seriously, it really isnt all that different. And I highly doubt this was this persons first character only 4 days into Eve.
---
Who are Starry Armada?
---
I thought Horde only had select corps, like Vanguard, and foreign corps.
---
Lol
---
Keep in mind the filament leaves a signature that can be found by other players, who can then camp waiting for you to get out of the site.  I'd recommend dropping a safe and opening there or in a quiet system.
---
Most people i find complaining like that seem to not understand the limitation of small gang setups. 
---
Yes sometimes you have to run because fighting it would put you at mercy of the hostiles and past experience leads me to believe they absolutely will drop the hammer if the chance presents itself. 
---
because when you can't use it you just pull out your decloaker alt
---
or decloaker alt #2 / #3 etc etc
---
That doesn't make it any more balanced, it just means more dude is linearly better
---
Other than being able to have character name that the dead titan pilot actually chose, skill injectors did nothing to improve the game (or enjoyment thereof) in anyway that wasn't already possible pre-injectors.
---
Wipe front to back or back to front?
---
One day hopefully soon
---
I lol'd
---
I believe this is correct; similar to the way all the high-meta modules, faction and above, had to be sold via contract back in the day...
---
Aces! More hisec market drama!
---
Horde started accepting corps couple months or so go.
---
That's par for the course.  Market citadels are cheap, and having to constantly kill them is just, imo, part of running a major highsec market.  
---
I have never heard about that. How would you even use bots for that?
---
Lol they wouldn't even accept a trade between removal of only cloaky ships from local and a system wide decloaker.
---
The emperor protects.
---
You have not experienced peak Karmafleet posting until you have witnessed "The gate is green"
---
Oh weird seeing that, thank you
---
Strawman and no one is even debating you 
---
I believe in maintaining my innocence and do not read that thread
---
Is Horde recruiting? 
---
Pesos? Idk
---
you guys live in highsec now, cloaky camping has no effect on you :D
---
No clue. Honestly the only real downside to injectors is losing the ability to go oh a week old char they cant be a cyno. Beyond that buying injectors doesnt mean you magicly gain the skill to use said skills/ship.
---
No loophole there , you know when the wardec ends. Get your assistes to dec them .. dont be cheap
---
The Titan died so what to complain?
---
True, even longer then your campaign.
---
So here's the thing. I agree that the balance of the game is fucking over small roamers. And I absolutely agree that a small gang like yours should be able to accomplish *something*, even in the face of a response fleet. That something might be something small -- trade your 20 guys for one HAC kill, or blap some T2 fighter squads before being chased away. As long as a small gang person is ok with small victories, I'm all for it.
---
But these things are separate issues from a post like the OP where it's just "give me win buttons". Some people literally believe that an individual should be able to cripple an empire.
---
______________________________
---
Caps and supercaps are fucking up the game for lots of stuff beyond small gang. Capships should not be able to destroy small supcaps, AOE doomsdays are retarded, CCP unlearned the lessons of the past. The days when subcap fleets were more important, because unsupported caps were easy kills, were much better for 1st-year players.
---
The logi repair meta has been OP for so long that most active players don't even remember what it was like back before all fights had logi wings. Logi are fun and cool, but they also are extremely suppressive to taking risks on uneven fights. If your 20 guys are fighting 50 guys with logi, you get wiped with zero kills and it sucks. I've been advocating stacking penalties to logi for years, CCP finally did it, and I went nuts. Right now it's not enough, but I finally have some hope that logi eventually will be less dominant.
---
you are.  While in shield, the Rag gets 0 armor reps.  By the time it hits armor, it only has 9 million ehp left.
---
The Bus gets double reps while it still has 45 million EHP left.  
---
Don't think anyone in Horde seriously considered Horde to be "Elite". 
---
krabs will never give an inch, they don't want a healthy game, just a brainless one
---
Supers die pretty frequently though, and for the same reasons. Point being, you can't really mount a response when you don't know stuff is happening.
---
I still believe my statement is true. No matter which alliance this guy had been in, he'd be dead.
---
Pretty sure I fit this to my rattles
---
It's a Chinese corp.
---
I guess the corp managers do not tell those new immigrants the differences between the two servers.
---
so the goal was to gauge test's dread building ability?
---
the big shit fit : recharger instead of cap booster and only DC in low ... lool
---
Yeah they are entitled to effortlessly knowing a cloaky ship is in their system yet also decloaking it on demand.
---
What if its just another structure like a cyno jammer?
---
You can’t 
---
I agree. The best bet would be have it as a structure, similarly sized to a cyno jammer or jump gate, and someone has to activate it in person.  
---
What we are looking for is parity of effort between the campers and the camped. Right now it is wayyy in favour of the campers, but better to ease it across than hit it with a bludgeon.
---
Ok, disappointing but clear ^^

STOP SPELLING IT DUEL. A duel is a fight betwixt 2 persons whereas dual is means 2.

I licensed it through Artlist.io

Mmmm I think that would be fine then, or at least it wouldn't lend itself to "SPAM MORE ALTS"
---
I liked the idea of it slowly turning off cloak, which would only kill the incompetent and AFK.
---
It's actually Poitot! Out of all the systems in Syndicate, the only one that's named is Poitot
---
This confused me as well, but it makes sense because it's a bomb that explodes right on top of your ship, but somehow avoids damaging it. So it's smart because it focuses its damage outwards somehow. 
---
Post JU-OWQ fortizar please and thank you :P
---
Wow my entire fleet is logi, finally
---
That's a stupid post even by your standards.
---
Ya it makes sense to me, if I own the sov I should be able to see what’s undocked in my system. Maybe a once an hour timer or something like that, or pulses something that decloaks you if you don’t reactivate cloak within 60s or something
---
What was he planning to do tho? Bump the titan to death? God I love this game..
---
Can't decide if this or MER warfare is worse.
---
Mainly USTZ, but our EUTZ is getting damn close.

Yeaaa booisss Brave newbies!!

That translates to: "As soon as CCP gives alliances access to the GM tools, then and only then can you complain about alliances allowing bots.". 
---
^(I am a bot. I'm sorry if I ruined your surprise.)
---
GIST X-TYPE X\_LARGE SHIELD BOOSTER O.o
---
They're a mostly Chinese corp from Serenity that was recently added into Horde.  One of the former member-corps of the alliance PIBC.
---
You really dont want to eat shit in another rattle fleet, do you
---
On one hand, I'm glad CCP prioritized the various recent changes to wardeccs.   
---
On the other, I wish they'd played-out more scenarios as thought experiments prior to coding them.  
---
I mean, this is EVE. We're going to find every damned loophole/exploit/trick that's possible. 
---
This is what I did as I am newbie myself, I first trained a little bit of everything as I wanted to try different types of ships, guns, etc.. Then I focused on what I enjoyed the most, corps usually have doctrines for their fleets so I kind of prioritized that.
---
When it comes to corps and how they are or as some may say every Corp/alliance has a different “culture” What I would suggest you do if you’re looking for the right Corp or group of people to play with, do a brief google or reddit search on specific corps and read posts from them and about them, you will get a good idea of what kinda people they are. That’s how I found the Corp I’m in right now and I honestly couldn’t have gone wrong with my choice.
---
This is also just a personal advice, go for a Corp that’s not too small so at least they can defend themselves and not too big to the point that you’re a nobody, or another fish in the pond if I may..
---
I think a lot of people are really turned off by the fact that loss has consequences, combined with the fact that most of Eve pvp for the solo or small gang player is about the hunt which a certain group of people love but another segment hate and want instant action.
---
Yea, better content than Dockness. 
---
I mean just ask GSM, I'll put in a word, should be out next patch or two
---
The mega alliances (alliances are corps that band togther) will have specialized corps (specialized in pvp, industry, mining, etc.) within them plus casual corps for the casual player. There will be many people in the alliance that could be considered experts in perticular aspects of the game.
---
Smaller corps will generally specialize and potentially band together with like minded corps.
---
To learn, I would use Google, you tube and play the game. DON'T BE AFRAID TO LOSE SHIPS. You will learn much quicker by taking risks. Just don't blow your bankroll on one ship. Read up on stuff and then ask fellow corp members specific questions. 
---
Once you get a feel for the game and what you want to do, you can start developing alts and/or adding accounts. Plan this well though. 
---
All sorts of topics are discussed on comms. 
---
\^This!
---
TimeTravelMe! 2 years "Hey guys we should just let CCP sell skill points directly, trust me injectors are not going to work out like you think."
---
How can it be unpopular if you're so updooted
---
I don't believe you
---
Wow thats so cool!
---
topics outside of game generally don't get brought up (like politics) as a rule because they cause drama and infighting.
---
corps are NOT usually full of like minded, but rather people who had committed to working toward a common goal.   this goal can have different parts to it.   for example a person looking to make a profit may like the security provided by the people looking for a fight and buying ships.
---
how to become a member of a corp that needs everything?   just apply.
---
you can start with a newbro corp,  like Karmafleet, BRAVE, or Pandemic Horde.   these corps all lead to all the parts of EVE,  and need any and all.
---
Pandemic Horde accepts any, and is fast about it as no API is required (API = a sorta background check on your character).  like its name implies, we rely on numbers to grow.
---
Karmafleet takes a while to get into, but is part of the largest power in EVE atm, and is a good place to make profit.  not to mention do some of the more....risky parts of EVE like highsec ganking.   fun time.
---
BRAVE also requires an API, but is the more....casual of the 2.  it aims more at fun and the individual rather than the corp. and we have a joke about BRAVE in EVE, they the ones who salvage ships even as the battle is going on.  not entirely true...but not false either.   good guys.
---
honestly you can't make a wrong choice, and all can introduce you to all parts of EVE.   if you don't like the atmosphere of one, you can try another. eventually you'll find one you like and grow in it.  graduating to one of the more experienced corps, or sticking ot the original to help it grow.
---
you guys were right, actually doing the thing helps learning the thing
---
shocking i know
---
Nice
---
Edited it into the comment you replied to! Will produce another teaser with the bracket draws + date/time in the future to share around, just excited to bring some good tournament news to the Reddit for a change.
---
I used to be a capsuleer like you but then I took an arrow in the knee.
---
We're going to sell all the unnecessary waste salt we harvest from comments like yours.

We'll be rocking five billion a year in bulk shipments alone. Keep it up.

/r/evejobs
---
but imagine actually joining horde
---
In order to do that you’d need to flip your security setting to yellow or red which you can’t do in an upwell structure.  You can kill yellow or reds in high sec under a green security setting (aka doing God’s work).  But you cannot aggress.  In low/null it’s unneeded to flip settings to aggress.  
---
Thinking it thru... concord would show up and would need to kill your structure which I’m not as certain what game mechanic would overrule.  The structures shield/armor/hull timers would in theory cause concord to have to return for each timer to fulfill their obligation.  
---
&gt;titans die
---
&gt;supers die
---
is frigs die next
---
Just cut to the chase and join Goons. 
---
So what does this prove? That we are thinking about using the game mechanic to our advantage, like Horde die for months?  And yes, this is a bad loophole and it should be closed.
---
And I stand by my point that the Mahtista timer was pure coincidence.
---
There's a 4 hour window where this is impossible...hence the exploit.
---
Is your assumption that the Person behind this character is new to the game ? because id be willing to bet that he's probably been playing the game for years, has vast wealth and creating a character for a single specific role is something within his means.
---
Its possible he didn't spent a single penny of real world money as well.
---
Yes, it's ok I got one a few hours after where they tried the same thing lmao.
---
The exploit is shedding the assists...
---
I wish, i could do just about ANYTHING and make them look better than they currently do.
---
Snuff honorable alliance.
---
Mystery code? (please, please, please)
---
Saying that F4.0 and even Falcon BMS is more accurate than DCS world is just wrong. I can tell you for a fact that F4.0 and even BMS for that matter does not compete with the engine of DCS. Remember, DCS World is basically just the engine that the sims fly in, you buy specific planes to fly INSIDE that sim. The warthog's manual for DCS is 670 pages long, [link](https://srv13files.eagle.ru/dcs/manuals/DCS-A-10C_Flight_Manual_EN.pdf), and most of the fully modeled aircraft have manuals with 100+ pages. In DCS you can even fly semi-modeled aircraft like the F-15, which does not have a interactive cockpit or detailed systems, but is great for newer players. I know that there are diehard BMS guys out there because of how good that sim is, but saying F4.0 or BMS are more accurate than DCS is not correct.
---
No, we are losing badly as you can see from 60 dead Azbels and 0 dead Keepstar.
---
FWIW the only way this was possible is because Horde+co have been exploiting the assist war function to not have to pay a single war dec fee in the entirety of this high sec war. They've also brought ICY alt corps that had TEST decs on them into Horde to get free wars. If they just pay the dec fee and declare a proper war against TEST nothing can stop that because the recent patch allows any war to be restarted without cooldown regardless of why it may have dropped. Between Panfam + Winter Co, 6 major alliances involved in this high sec cluster fuck, exactly zero of them pay a war dec fee because of the assist feature.

It's proving that you were lying about it being an accident. And obviously still are.

Welcome to Skill Injectors Online.
---
Honestly I'd be down for that. Concord blowing up structures in HS. Ccp really need to look ever low power some more and hopefully come up with a way for npc's to kinda deal with them 
---
Got a fit?
---
If I had to take a guess it is probably only used by GMs and CCP for testing or debugging. Like someone guessed above, this was probably discovered years ago and has not moved since, and that is probably why.
---
I'm assuming you will be requiring buyers to sort their own shipping given the current shipping costs on your t-shirts
---
What the fuck.  The only kill in the last week was a sabre the titan did 1200 damage too.
---
There is a few times they welped pods into gate camps half a dozen times in 2 minute intervals.  Thats not suspicious...
---
Sooooooooo if phorde wants to fight TEST, why are you not keeping TEST perma-wardeced yourselves rather than fucking with joining on defense?
---
If you want to fight, you have an easy way to make that happen. If you want to play footsie with war mechanics and altcorps, don't bitch when it bites you in the ass.
---
Want content for your homeless Corp ? Take a look at J102655, we’ll be waiting to welcome friends in our alliance... Or enjoy some space fights with foes :)
---
Are you messing with me or do people actually rat in Titans?
---
I don't know what disgusts me more, the idea of new players picking up scraps behind the "elders" and organisations who encourage it or the fact that this might actually be best thing to do for new players.  
---
This is coming from a guy who spend all the SP he got when CCP reimbursed the learning skills into salvaging and a Noctis, so it's not like I don't enjoy salvaging, I just think it should be a task that is a bit more rewarding and less tedious. Like having a minigame to get modules or salvage parts out and if you fail all you end up with are metall scraps.
---
Ah yes, the wardec fee :dinobrain:
---
Ok, again. The time of the end of an war is fully determined when the war starts. The war always goes for a full week until it has to be renewed. We started this war in October. How would we know in October on what day we have to start the war, so that it ends just in time for this timer in April?
---
R/evejobs has recruitment posts
---
There's a lot of things this game needs. This is definitely not one of them.
---
One thing you have to consider about the Nestor is it's mass.
---
Every other battleship in the game cannot fit into a C1 WH because of the mass limits into C1 space. Nestor is the only BS in the game to fit in a C1 with roughly 20 mill mass unplated.
---
This actually makes them very good for traversing a Nestor fleet through your chain to run some sites.
---
They put much less mass on wormholes.
---
That's a lot of wasted effort... 90% of that should be taken care of by your mapping tool.  
---
We appreciate the invite, but a C1 is not for us. We only live in C5 space.
---
Oooh... Well, upper class wormholes do look interesting, to be honest... 
---
But eh, what can I say ? I’m a dirty miners, and you have the same moons as we do (strangely) &gt;.&lt;
---
And I don’t really want to train a Dreadnought just to pew pew some rats and DIAF
---
Could we all just agree that the plural of Ferox is Feroxii?
---
Have you.......what? People have been talking about boson ratting for months 
---
Next time make a post about your Thanny hacking relic sites in c2-3 space. I thought that's what this would be about - not just a capital with a bad rig and a probe launcher trying to run combat sites...
---
Yes, and I'll do ya one better:

Not sure if things have changed much since late last year, but that's what I have done them in, and those are my results.
---
We're a real pvp corp. Ofcourse we also need some ISK to fund out losses, but most of our people have found a way to achieve that without having to lock down home for PVE. We usually make ISK and be bait at the same time. Fun to do :)

You can do c3s in the same time as a rattle in  machariels, vindis, nightmares . C2s any of the tanky bc can do them as well.

I think that's your issue. You're talking to people who don't want ex-Goons.

I've only recently gotten back into the game after nearly two years away

I thought that’s what those HS war dec corps were supposed to be doing?  Oh right all they do is shoot at the jita undock and Gates.

Apologies I figured you were a No lifer such as me. Yeah people boson rat with HAW guns to finish off whatever boson doesn’t

If a bigger, stronger corp is bashing a structure of ours (small 300 member carebear corp in NPC null) and we're going to lose it, is there somewhere I can post for a "bigger fish" about possible capital kills?
---
A desperate batphone "come kill these shiny things that are trying to kill me" kind of thing.
---
Just whatever you do don’t buy into the notion that you’re required to buy a mining permit.   Just please don’t.  If you see anyone from the CODE alliance trying to extort you and others in local leave immediately.  Don’t talk to them.  Not a word.  Quietly leave system.  
---
It must be super nice being this ignorant of reality lololol
---
80% of Chinese characters are likely bots.
---
That actually sounds pretty awesome, but how much more efficient is it than carrier ratting?
---
Evidently you just take the fit from your c4 rattle and slap it on

Goon is a word with a generally negative connotation.... I don't think I'd fit in. Thanks for the advice though.

Riiiiight.  That’s why so many people join.

Has to be on structure, one per system, can be pulsed once/week.

very few people care about an alt's corp history, especially when the main's story checks out and there's proper documentation in form of a character bazaar post

Even shorter TLDR: Test used exploit, Lied about it. Got caught.

ACTUALLY... it's moar like ... log in ... fail ... fail ... fail ... logout, switch toons ... fail ... fail ... fail and so on.

Or is it still Ferox?  One ferox many ferox.  You’re right tho it’s definitely not Feroxes.

Well I mean at first you would tho k that just knowing to do X would allow you to perform X correctly
---
Is there a sensible strategic reason for this or is it just the EVE equivalent of Mr T going all out with too much gold around his neck?
---
Is CCP anticipating another "boot.ini" type scenario with the summer roll out of the 64bit client?
---
Horde managed it for an extended period.  Granted, we weren't dealing with another major power, but I'm still waiting on the "we're gonna do this better than horde" to kick in.  At best we're preventing each other from monopolizing the market, a far cry from TAPI's original boasting.
---
If you put politics and culture aside, and just look at Goons from a perspective of member benefits and support infrastructure, the Goons are far superior to all others.  Also the Goon intelligence &amp; web services are pretty frickin' amazing.
---
However, their politics and culture are the biggest downside.
---
Nope, planets and structures are stationary
---
Provided you have enough havens, it's as good or better than super ticks
---
So many people join because it's currently the safest place in eve to afk krab and not actually have to *gasp* pvp at all. The negative connotations surrounding goons are there for many reasons, and those reasons haven't gone away yet.
---
He's definitely making the right call not joining.

No, I meant if i was the hunter, I would've bubbled your return hole

It's shit content. Basically low tier mongo knuckle draggeru content. Wait....that's all that's left in Eve....nevermind. 😔

I just don't like the idea of being referred to as a 'goon'. I think batman-esque gangsters when I hear that word.

Eve jobs is a good place to start.  Look at some posts and most have in game public channels and public areas on discord where you can chat and ask questions and get a general feel for them and if it seems like a good match.  I think Eve is not great because of what you are doing but is great because of who you are doing it with.  And yes corps will talk on coms  about everything.  Heck our discord has channels like shitposting, Indy, PVP,  food and Cats (or any other pet).  Had a bad day at work and there is usually someone to vent to.  My current corp well .... we know stuff about what everyone does for work and about their kids.  Some have had a medical scare and felt like I can’t talk to my family about this and instead come online and talk to their corp family.  
---
One suggestion though is don’t join too many random corps and then leave right away because then it looks kinda iffy when you apply to a new one.  Again do your best (even if it takes a day or two) to get a feel for the group.  
---
Also never be afraid of asking a “stupid” question.  If they will not help you to grow or learn then probably not a place you would like to be long term.  
---
Fly safe
---
This... This is exactly right!!!!

Here are more dank leaks, that your spais can verify:

&gt;wars were declared  
---
&gt;sorry for the delay
---
As you can see we asked the war to be re-declared at 8:20 yesterday, 2 minutes after it was invalidated. And I reminded them 2 hours later. That would have given Horde plenty of time ro renew their assist. The war dec only cam ein later, because PGL was traveling and Sappo was at work.
---
Because TEST uses alt corps to wardeck the alt corps the Azbels are in, so Horde has to join as an ally to defend it.
---
FINALLY SOMEBODY WITH SOME SENSE AROUND HERE
---
Welcome to the wonderful world of EVE.
---
To be honest, I’d be surprised if anyone big and serious enough actually come. And if they do, whoever have the upper hand when the smoke fade away will probably kill the structure.
---
This is more along the lines of what I was curious about. So the corps aren't just different uniforms to indicate what team you play for. They are living breathing communities, right? These Goon fellas have been brought up three times now. None of it has been all too positive.
---
I think it lets new players compete at a higher level more quickly... A good thing.
---
Ok? The current war dec fee formula makes it cost 500mil/wk to dec a large alliance so it's not exactly nothing. 
---
Example of all panfam/winterco wars vs TEST which are all assists and no proper decs: https://i.imgur.com/csNqRsY.png
---
Example of a corp that got moved into Horde after a TEST dec so Horde gets a free war: https://i.imgur.com/BInrGjz.png
---
Few more examples of Horde getting free defensive wars (we've never aggressively dec'd Horde during this time, these were all ICY corps that got dragged into Horde for free wars):  
---

---
https://i.imgur.com/wVlzyPB.png  
---
We've been at "war" with these ~7 panfam &amp; winterco alliances for 6 months now, so that should've been a 92bil war dec fee in that time. 460b if you want decs on all Imperium alliances as well. But in reality, roughly 0 isk was spent on decs on their side. 
---
ah, not much we couldve done then tho, hard to hide battleships
---
You'll need tackle and damage.  For tackle, you want something that can fit a cov ops cloak, most likely an Astero.  Have it do the scouting.  Your damage will have a cloak fitted, but doesn't need a cov ops since it will only be warping after tackle.  A dictor is usually a good choice since it can hit hard while also bubbling the pod.  You can either choose to roam around and see what pop up on D-Scan, or camp pirate relic sites for explorers.  Check any industrial structures to see if they've got moon ore.  Could be good for a mining barge kill.  The key to WH hunting is patience.  Sometimes you have to lay a proper trap before you get a pay off but the feeling of being a spooky WH pirate is well worth it.
---
thx :)
---
Join a New Player Corp. Most have welcome packages, interactive learning fleets and teaching classes to introduce you to many different aspects of the game.
---
Pandemic Horde, Karma Fleet, Brave Newbies or Eve university are all good examples.
---
I kinda just wanna fly a spaceship by my lonesome for a while. Explore things, but joining a corp seems darn near required for stuff later.
---
Scam artists I assume?
---
there were a lotof anoms in the system, is there any modules or anything that increases dscan range? i cant think of another way to find which 1 without being spotted and us warping off
---
Well, since TEST trade citadels aren't blowing up, and horde ones are, I think TEST has already "done this better".    
---
95% of corps are full of bads without a fucking clue. But just as in RL incompetence times n gets the job done. So that´s what most meatbags go for. 
---
No, but a covert cloaked ship can warp while cloaked so will never been seen.  You can warp around the system until you have the targets on dscan and then use the camera + the dscan tool to narrow your angle from 360 degrees all the way to 5 degrees and point your dscan at each anom.  The one that shows ships is the one you want.  At that point you can warp into the anom cloaked and as long as you don't bump into something, you can get as close as 2.5km from target and your entire fleet of buddies can warp directly to you and onto a target.
---
The title literally says skill injectors are good for game, how is that complaining?
---
Making eve a cryptocurrency is a terrible idea. It would also mean "legalizing" RMT, which I doubt will ever happen.
---
Damn I have wasted a lot of time then, lol. Thanks for the clarification.
---
They're bad for the game because they serve as rich-get-richer force multipliers for groups that can use these assets well. Of course they're not going to go to much in the hands of Horde. The whole point is that Horde couldn't catch up now even if they did become a competent group.
---
I've seen multiple people say this person is complaining, but did you even consider he wasn't being sarcastic?  The title literally says they are good for the game, and he's posting a juicy kill from someone skill injecting.
---
Putting down a keepstar is not even half the battle.  PLEX and injector markets, the two main profit drivers traded in offshoring cits, regularly shift back and forth.  We've already forced the keep down from .3% to .1% to even compete at all.  Compared to uncontested market dominance for months on end, I'd say TEST is substantially behind where Horde was.
---
Lore supports warping through mass, and that would be RMT, so no, and a drink would be worth more than a few million, like 300-600m.
---
If this would be one of the "normal" games, where you'd simply re-spawn somewhere in your fitted titan after you die without losing anything, it'd piss me off so much I'd quit the game. 
---
IMHO it's not that much of an issue in EVE because he just lost a fucking titan for good. 
---
I don't know what any of that means, but it sounds chaotic and terrible.
---
The anti cloaking Pulse is in the game for a very long time... going by the name of "smartbomb". The decloaking radius is a bit of a bummer though...
---
Factual, that's why nobody will sell me the lore items. Nobody can actually clear the damn sites. I think that's amazing and a good thing for the game is the PVE is hard enough that people who have been playing for longer than I have can't handle it. 
---
Is there a possibility to make a desktop wallpaper version for purchase?
---
Adding planetoids/obstructions to combat warping would be pretty sweet. Would add another layer of tactics to battle.
---
This is disgusting. 
---
The title looks sarcastic 
---
Noted, thanks.
---
This shitpost is beautiful. I was confused, angry, back to confused, amused, and confused again. Spodbless
---
If only there was an item that allowed you to "rent" time in a system before the faction navy would show up to bash your structure in low power. Perhaps a "charter" of some kind? Maybe since it is faction based they could be sold in LP stores? 
---
Tongue and cheek aside, having faction dreads bash structures would be a really cool way to expand on the ai that the mining fleets use and give HS players a chance to see dreads at least.
---
I know you don't want to hear this but calling people "cunt" won't make you a good FC. 
---
If only there was an item that allowed you to "rent" time in a system before the faction navy would show up to bash your structure in low power. Perhaps a "charter" of some kind? Maybe since it is faction based they could be sold in LP stores?
---
It's much different. Before training that titan pilot would take x days. Now with say, a 10 character skill farm, it takes x/10 days to train and sell that sp. It's much, much faster.
---
Its a kill in freaking O-V and last i remembered thats their staging? So well its like someone comes to the great idea to start ratting in 1DQ because that would result in the same hilarious killmail and a lot of people laughing. but well everyone already expects goons are only rich noobs so that wont make any news xD
---
Only downside is you can't judge the threat of a toon based on age in game.
---
A character a week old was never much of a threat where as not it might have a trillion skill points 
---
Am I missing something or are there only six teams?
---
Stop trying to re-hype crypto.
---
People like you are why it turned into a bull market in the first place.
---
c6 is mostly dreads. maybe some stupid expensive snakes if you want to spend more on snakes than on dreads.
---
Yes. There's a really limited supply of characters for sale with the skills to fly titans, and they can't be magicked up overnight. The reputation that goes with them also used to mean something.
---
There might have been a few people playing the super long game to train characters for the bazaar over two years, but nothing like skill farms today.
---
Ironic? No.  
---
Snuff does this all the time?
---
What they really need to do is get rid of asset safety for low power structures so people have a reason to bash them. 
---
I always **EVE University** to new players. They will show you the ropes. 
---
Don't recall being able to really do more than a C3 efficiently with a T3C. Used to be able to do C4s fairly well until they fixed the remote rep. Now you can't break the tank on a lot of the sites. Since the T3C nerf I've been under the impression that they are slightly worse off than before
---
and a dagger
---
uh..no
---
O-V is not staging anymore. that was moved to BWF a WHILE ago.
---
and the O-V jump bridge to BWF was changed as well.   its no rather convoluted to fly from BWF to O-V.  its nearly faster to fly straight there.  
---
Tfw you guys literally did this for months lmao.
---
Oh damn ok then i seem to be totally out of touch lately with the game. Should visit you guys more again 
---
That's just hyprviper being hyprviper.
---
Horde never had anybody contest them, and their citadel fell as soon as somebody did.  
---
Thanks - I'd read all the other news articles about it but hadn't seen Polygon's own particular take on the story yet. This one seems pretty accessible to non Eve players too. Reshared already to someone on my Discord.
---
I hate to break it to you but 22/23 year olds right now were born in 96, so some of them are
---
feel old yet?
---
Sideways.
---
Crypto is trash and this is advocating RMT. Piss off.
---
Just goon alts
---
You know, the fact that someone would invest stupendous amounts of ISK to by them injectors is one thing. But how autistic do you have to be to inject them all *and* apply them to the proper skills, times V in most cases? 
---
Smartbomb doesn't decloak. It gives you an idea where the target is though as you do get/refresh your agression timer when you got someone. 
---
O-V is pretty deserted this last weeks, tops like 10 in local, most socked alts.
---
I agree with the long overheat mechanic, it already has good balance baked into the idea because cloaks have already high module HP and take a long time to repair with paste.  They are also huge modules, a bomber could barely carry a second cloak if the first one burnt out and if you wanted to swap it in hostile space that would have to be done from an anchored depot.
---
We reported the 3 BBC cloaky sabres for like 30 minutes before the kill. 
---
If the pilot disregarded the intel, fuck it, pure darwinism at work here.
---
i think they were official ccp concept art
---
I just grab out one of my solo cruisers I got for christmas and fly round a bit. Most likely i die and have to grab another one of them but maybe I find some contend for everyone.
---
Content is always welcome. But, yeah, O-V area is pretty deserted nowadays. You may get some content in BWF area or Tribute, a lot depends on how the jump gates are aligned.
---
oh... ok, I didn't know that. always thought it decloaked. thanks for the info!
---
wtb good bot
---
And my axe!
---
the botters win again
---
shit tons of botting vexor navy issues lost and then a titan.. this game.
---
&gt; 80% of Chinese characters 
---
Nah they just rolled Archura for the great stat line
---
You could just solve the problem like we did by putting the structure in your alliance.
---
But you get no income without sanitizing the market area of competing citadels.  Getting a cit up is the easy part, getting yours to be the ONLY market cit is the hard part, and how you actually secure an income.  In the era of PLEX vaults and remote injecting, there's no reason for traders to use the keep over the azbels except tax rate, which isn't lower in the keep.  In terms of money made, which is the whole point of this convoluted hisec rules fight, Horde was far more effective.
---
god I love you new players, keep it up man i hope you enjoy the game and have some fun. Are you mostly in Highsec? because I would suggest you try Lowsec and Faction warfare for a bit or maybe just pirating and stuff. You can earn decent isk and have a lot of fun there with cheap disposable ships
---
pretty naive to think that they would buy the ISK from CCP. from quick googling 44B is something like $200 from RMT.
---
**literally** months
---
I feel this is a bold statement. Fit is valid.
---
I always forget how skewed the view is for those of you who have never been on the inside. 
---
Let me leave it at this: The creation of new botting software given a list of hooks is not nearly as difficult as you might think it is.

I'll keep you guys in mind for next time!

really should. we need more people to fight

Us bringing all the blues is brave but when the other guys do it it’s cheating.  Just grow up?
---
The guy have forgot Lazerhawk, Just a Game, Bow dow and many more in fact.  
---
If you do a search on r/fittings there are some good starting points for ratting fits. My preference is doing c3 in a passive shield myrm with mobile depot etc. it’s a very small loss after insurance if you do lose it so you can afford to take some risks. Risks are how you get better the fastest IMO. 
---
It was fun that day, watching you forming 500 dudes and a entire supercaps fleet, punching a a faction forti for 45 minutes, without a fight.  
---
And that BOT support fleet warping directly into the Point Defense, thinking they are doing the right thing. It was inspiring.
---
Well as I clearly disclosed regarding DCS, in the spirit of fairness, I have no direct hands on experience with DCS, that's why I said that , in essence that it "appears so" based on observations rather than "it is so" based on experience.
---
Goons outnumber the next biggest alliance by a factor of 2.
---
They just kinda dick on everyone and cause a massive blue donut which is less interesting that loads of smaller corps fighting. 
---
Being the biggest they have a lot of hate and being the biggest they have a lot of politics issues as with most large groups. 
---
And yeh corps can be completely different atmospheres, some are really relaxed with others being kinda strict, some jokey some serious.
---
Some might all be of a certain political or social persuasion and others might be more varied. 
---
It usually takes people a while to find a corp you like, i've been playing with the same 2 guys since 2013 and we just kinda mong around doing different things. 
---
They brought 500 dudes that day.  
---
We were 20 ish.  
---
And they complain we didn't samurai fight them or something. They can't event complain about batphoning anybody that day, since we didn't.  
---
Panfam are never satisfy )o:
---
There’s a thing I don’t get in the injector discussion: my character is 5.5 years old, but I only have 16M SP and about 150 hours of having the game open (much less of actual playtime).
---
I would guess that my case is somewhat uncommon, but if I log in tomorrow, fix my ass full with injectors, get into a cap and go die stupidly as I am inevitably bound to because I have no idea what I’m doing, no one will bat an eye.
---
But these seemingly purpose-crafted just-out-of-the-pad toons that people find in killmails always get so much attention. Why? It’s not like they have just joined the game and going crazy with money, is it?
---
I have lost a ship in the abyss to a bug (couldn't turn on and off my propmod). Upon contacting ccp i got a totally bullshit answer that their logs show no issue so i can go fuck myself. Turns out a lot of other pilots got the same answer... So ty but no abyss sites for me. 
---
so a 60 man fleet getting blobbed then
---
Do all the tutorial missions also. Aside from learning the basics you'll make some money and get some free ships to use or sell.
---
It may be an accurate misnomer, but this device matches the description given to it: omnidirectional pulse. 
---
Smartbomb may just be a nickname given to it. Seems to match CCPs pattern of “yeah that sounds cool”. 
---
Its funny that your argument hinges on them not wanting to pay 500m. 
---
Like honestly, not even involved in this and your whole story of "THEY DIDN'T WANA PAY 500 MILLION ITS AN EXPLOIT" seems retarded as hell.
---
They were effective because nobody bothered to contest them.  That's my point.  They did the easy bit, and never had to actually bother with the hard bits because nobody else wanted to deal with it.  
---
Its like claiming you're "more effective" at darksouls because you never died once.  Except you don't mention that you never went past the first level.  
---
They should just fix it or allow it. Leaving mechanics like that in and have it bannable to use is just lazy.
---
have you guys decided yet what the goal of the invasion is, or when it will start? 
---
Waited for my mates to perfect their t5 methods and fits before I even tried a t4.

---
Should have just bought a Levi pilot on the forums so it doesn't have that fresh body smell. 
---
Hey buddy! Doing the tutorial missions just to get a hang of the basic basic mechanics first is the way to go. They also inject some useful skills for you automatically as well as giving you little "quests" that help you learn more stuff. After that joining a newbie friendly Corp in nullsec is likely the way to go, get coddled for a while learn more complicated aspects to the game and maybe even try other areas of space out long term. I'm going to send you a dm as well with my discord information 
---
Yikes
---
whereas if you bring a few hundred dudes or so to kill a bunch of undefended citadels, that's practically canadian national news worthy 
---
My two cents: if I hadn't joined KarmaFleet(3 years ago?), I probably wouldn't still be playing today. I met a lot of cool people ratting, mining, and flying around defending other people doing the previous activities in homedefense standing fleets. I could sit in comms and ask noob questions all night and have them answered and more. I lost a ratting Ishtar one night and someone dropped 400mil in my wallet. I was shocked at the lengths people would go to help me out without really knowing me.
---
That being said, the larger the group of people, the lower the average iq gets. Stay to the smaller groups within alliances and you'll have much better interactions. Goons have tons of smaller groups, sigs, and squads.
---
Keep in mind though that what may be good for me might not be the same for you. You're not locked into anything in eve. If the first, second, or third group isn't a good fit, move on and try another. Make friends, the most powerful ship in eve is friendship

---
In my opinion, which I admit is heavily biased by my experiences, you are probably not going to find an 'everything' corp that accepts members that don't want to actively PvP just for the sake of PvP.
---
However, there are endless possibilities for corps if you are interested in pointless PvP + anything-else.
---
After that, it is a matter of picking a group of people you like spending time with, and are willing to fight alongside of.

vthis is what my chat always looks like

---
So, GSF [CONDI], which is generally known as simply Goons is the heart of the Imperium Coalition. They are enormous, three times bigger than the next biggest alliance. As a result they’ve developed an extremely fine-tuned system to manage and provide for this huge member-base. They own several regions of space, which members may use as they wish, have a ton of Fleet Commanders who take out fleets pretty much as they fill up, and ‘special interest groups’ which are designed to provide specialized content for whatever niche interest a group of players may have. Their ‘ship replacement program’ is (I think) the oldest and perhaps best in the game, and frankly they have funds to replace pretty much anything you could possibly lose. For newbies, I’m fairly certain they just hand out fully fit ships (someone confirm?). They have the manpower, the organization, and the funds to provide an enormous amount of support and mentoring to new and experienced players.
---
Their reputation is rather less wholesome. They are known to be deeply involved with scams (including their invention/popularization of the ‘recruitment scam’), espionage (including against allies if you believe the keynote speech a top GSF diplomat gave at fanfest), all manner of betrayals, a great deal of edgy attitudes/language, chaotic voice-coms/chat, and a battlefield culture which emphasizes simply vastly outnumbering their enemies as opposed to seeking out challenging encounters (and a negative opinion of ‘elite’ pvp).
---
Keep in mind that both the reputation of both their player-support abilities and their ‘negative politics’ are the subject of propaganda from both pro- and anti- goon partisans, and quite possibly nothing I’ve just said is actually strictly accurate.
---
IMO it’s probably not a bad place to go to get on your feet, but you might find yourself feeling like just a tiny cog in a very large machine, in which case, hey, lots of smaller corps/alliances out there.
---

Yeah it's all good. Might be different in low class (been a while since I low class krabbed) but in high class most people skip em. 
---
For some corps, a disconnect between your in-game persona and your real-life persona is required.
---
I hope at least.  [The alternative is too scary.]
---
What the actual fuck?
---
Thanks! I have a whole group of members that only log in for tournaments and with the AT being canceled they have no reason to log in this year!
---
80 is not small
---
Nah mate, that was your glowybrained paper pushers impotently shuffling people into a corp you had shed decs from while the timer ticked down. Now that was fucken desperate.
---
This. E-Uni is, by far, the best choice for a noob.
---
Oh it is all taken care of but it also easy for people to navigate without having to tab out if they're on one monitor
---
If citadels had targetable sub-systems like outposts had it would be a start. Combine that with a way to defang them too.
---
Target their weapons systems, destroy their modules once you have them into armour. Turn Mobile Siphons into citadel fuel drainers. 
---
Ccp actually said they were developing this along with all the other small upwell structures. They are just releasing them in a slow trickle. (Don't crush our hopes for these!)
---
The answer is spod! because spod is heavier than salt
---
On a scale of 1 to Wallymarts how coherent do you believe your post is?
---
Who ya gonna call?
---
Ah. Btw, can t3c use covert cloak?
---
grrr!
---
Ok, but only because you said please. ;)
---
According to Gobbin’s ping they’re a small Indy Corp focused on supercap production originally from Serenity 
---
Imagine being afraid of a color in local
---
Everything you need to know about exploration. Nestor? No.

praises bob!
---
&gt; The mega alliances (alliances are corps that band togther) will have specialized corps (specialized in pvp, industry, mining, etc.) within them plus casual corps for the casual player.
---
In my experience, those are called 'alt-corps', and you won't get in one without a PvP main somewhere, unless it is a 'renter' corp.
---
I do currently have alts in a mega-alliance 'alt-corp', without any PvP requirement, but the benefits there are limited to "we won't shoot you on-sight if you undock" (no use of any blue space).
---
You don;t get it. They used honorable loopholes. We use evil exploits.
---
its not an exploit, as CCP stated before they enacted the change. Wars that get re-extended, will be seen as a new war. A new war means u have to recruit ur allies again. 
---
As a defender u only need to win 1 of the 3 timers, the old war dec trick allowed u to block an enemy during 1 of these timers. 
---
The current war dec system, yes, u could remove the allies for a short period, BUT that's still only 1 out of 3 timers they would need to win. AND simply deccing the hostile alliance itself would have not blocked you out. The current wardec system is not broken, just pay ur dec fee.
---
On the note of Goons: they arent there for us, they just really like pissing of the north. Its like 1 of their favorite things to do.
---
Can you write a sentence without insulting everyone?
---
That must have been the true EVE experience then
---
Could be worse. You might have to mine like 100 event sites and get the BPC as a reward from max event points to have to build it.
---
You can already just drop a million drones around the gate so that no cloaking near it is possible. Combine that with bubbles and nothing but a ceptor is getting through 
---
I'm Canadian and newish (only a year abouts of actual game time) , but have the basics handled. I'm also a recruiter for a pve, mining, and exploration focused corp that has very low tax, lots of active members to help out, and good opportunities, with no obligations.
---
I'd be happy to drop you an invite if you'd like! Even if not feel free to PM me and I will happily field questions. 
---
I believe it came from evolution corp?
---
the tax went down to drown the competition. It worked, competition now has to go 0.1 and make barely no isk, or go 0 and make non.
---
Most people are more satisfied with a 0.1 tax and security the keep gives. The plex market is mostly in the azbels, but those are easy to move over to the plex vault and are mostly owned by the azbel owner and his friends. 
---
Let's not blame Vily for a PGL move, now. But lol.
---
rattle easy.
---
It's almost like you are just opening your mouth for the narrative your TAPI leaders are feeding you.
---
realistically who the hell cares
---
Hey I think my reddit is broke.
---
I cannot read ant of the comments, they just all read as..
---
"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
There are some areas that aren't available not because they are leased out for the dank space, but because living there as a small group would be close to impossible. Period basis has like 4 actual people it, it's making almost no money for goons in terms of rent considering what they pay for sov and structures there. But no one wants to live sandwiched between goons, test, and stain, with no reliable logistics route that is even vaguely viable.
---
Cobalt edge is similarly awful.
---
But for real tho a stratios CAN do everything.
---
As people have repeatedly said on reddit, goons and test are not blue. Actually, the dude you responded to is ENCOURAGING you to bring your blues instead of """""""""neutral""""""""" people.
---
Yep. Totally not injected though, right?
---
If you are interested in solo 'exploration' (the activity), you might consider Signal Cartel.  It is a good corp to knock-around hostile space in, but it is not an 'everything' corp.  [I have an alt in SC.]
---
I do have respect for both Brave Newbies Inc. and Brand Newbros, and encourage everyone to consider them when corp-shopping.  
---

The hell you fucked up this time?
---
Xenuria you are legit retarded.
---
It was their motto but adapt or die predates even EVOL tbh
---
It’s the single eternal truth about playing Eve
---
Of course, you don't have to stay in any corp you deem is 'full of bads', unless you also really enjoy your time there.
---
If you are not having fun and enjoying yourself, no matter what you are doing, you are playing Eve wrong! ;)
---
I fly a 10b fit + pod. Its cake
---
Agreed - they should save it for when you feed them 270 dreads.
---
Then what, pray tell, is the actual reason that a nullsec alliance would be unwilling to pay a 500m fee to wardec someone?
---
"Learn to adapt more friends" - Sun Tzu 2016
---
Yes. They have a covert defensive subsystem 
---
do not fucking move until i get back or else
---
spent so much time moving from 7rm that I got burned out and applied for jobs at UPS instead
---
Was it really though?
---
Why a POS and not a citadel? There isn’t much a POS will do better than a citadel or engineering complex now. 
---
Switch for chimera or nid, more mid slot
---
A solo c5 rattle is a few billion
---
Might as well use a dread and clear it way faster
